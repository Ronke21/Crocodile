<text>Fields of the Nephilim are an English gothic rock band formed in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, in 1984. The band&#x27;s name refers to a biblical race of angel-human hybrids known as the Nephilim.
== Career ==
=== Early years (1984–1991) ===

The band&#x27;s debut EP, &quot;Burning the Fields&quot;, was released in 1985 by Situation Two records (an imprint of Beggars Banquet Records). The band &quot;upgraded&quot; to Beggars Banquet in 1986 to release &quot;Power&quot; and &quot;Preacher Man&quot;, and their first album, &quot;Dawnrazor&quot;, which topped the Indie chart in 1987. The next release, &quot;Blue Water&quot;, was the first Fields of the Nephilim single to reach the UK Singles Chart (number 75). It was followed by &quot;Moonchild&quot;, the lead single from the second LP &quot;The Nephilim&quot;, which reached number 28 in the UK chart.

&quot;Psychonaut&quot; was released in May 1989 and peaked at number 35; the ten-minute track indicated a slight shift for the band toward a more experimental and intense sound. This single/EP was a precursor to the polished and highly produced &quot;Elizium&quot; album (1990). Produced by Pink Floyd / David Gilmour engineer Andy Jackson (taking over from previous band producer Bill Buchanan), the album was preceded by the single &quot;For Her Light,&quot; which clipped the British Top 40 in its first week of release. A remixed version of &quot;Sumerland (Dreamed)&quot; (this version is on the CD single only and differed from the 7&quot; vinyl format of the same release), released in November 1990, peaked at number 37.

In 1991, the band played their final gigs, a two-day &#x27;Festival of Fire&#x27; in London. The final releases of this era are the live CD &quot;Earth Inferno&quot; and the video &quot;Visionary Heads&quot;, followed by the compilation &quot;Revelations&quot;.

=== Departure of McCoy and hiatus (1991–1998) ===
Frontman McCoy left the band in 1991. The remaining members, together with singer Andy Delaney, chose not to continue with the &quot;Fields of the Nephilim&quot; name and instead recorded under the name Rubicon. The band released two albums before disbanding: &quot;What Starts, Ends&quot; in 1992 and &quot;Room 101&quot; in 1995.

Meanwhile, Carl McCoy formed a new project called Nefilim in 1991, after the disbanding of Fields of the Nephilim.

The band played some gigs in 1993, showcasing new material. According to McCoy, the release of their debut album, &quot;Zoon&quot;, was delayed for several years due to disagreements with the record label. &quot;Zoon&quot; was eventually released in 1996 and featured a distinctly heavier sound than McCoy&#x27;s previous works.

=== Reunion and &quot;Fallen&quot; (1998–2002) ===
On 15 August 1998, McCoy and original bassist Tony Pettitt held a press conference at the Zillo Festival in Germany, announcing their future plans to collaborate under two separate monikers, Fields of the Nephilim (along with the Wright brothers) and The Nefilim (an altered spelling of McCoy&#x27;s solo project).

According to different original band members, the band was rehearsing and writing the next Fields of the Nephilim album (with the exception of Yates). However, the anticipated reunion of the original band line-up never happened.

In May 2000, McCoy released &quot;One More Nightmare (Trees Come Down),&quot; the first Fields of the Nephilim single with their new label, Jungle Records. It contained newly worked versions of &quot;Trees Come Down&quot; and &quot;Darkcell,&quot; both originally released on the &quot;Burning the Fields&quot; EP in 1984. Between June and August 2000, the band made four live appearances at European festivals: Woodstage, Eurorock, Roskilde, and M&#x27;era Luna music festivals.

In 2002, Jungle Records and Metropolis Records released the album &quot;Fallen&quot;. The release was not authorized by the band and consists of unfinished recordings from 1997–2001, the 2000 reworkings of &quot;Trees Come Down&quot; and &quot;Darkcell,&quot; and a previously unreleased demo by The Nefilim. The release has been disowned by the band for many years, and only one song from it, &quot;From The Fire,&quot; has been performed live.

=== &quot;Mourning Sun&quot; and &quot;Ceromonies&quot; (2005–2014) ===

Fifteen years after &quot;Elizium&quot;, McCoy released &quot;Mourning Sun&quot;, his fourth full-length studio album under the name Fields of the Nephilim. The album had seven original songs, with a cover version of Zager and Evans&#x27;s &quot;In the Year 2525&quot; included as a bonus track on the first 5,000 copies.

In interviews following the release of the album &quot;Mourning Sun&quot;, McCoy mentioned collaborating with ghost musicians, but only John &quot;Capachino&quot; Carter is officially credited on the album.

In 2006, some European venues announced that a tour was to take place, although this was never officially confirmed. In spite of high ticket sales, none of the gigs occurred. Through the band&#x27;s official website, McCoy emphasized that he had not confirmed these dates with promoters or venues, and reiterated that people should not buy tickets for such events until official announcements through the band&#x27;s website confirmed that such live performances were to go ahead.

In May 2007, McCoy performed as Fields of the Nephilim for the first time in seven years, at the London Astoria. According to the band&#x27;s website, the event was filmed by video director Richard Stanley, who had directed videos for the original band&#x27;s singles; however, due to quality issues with the audio recording and filming, it was abandoned.

&quot;Ceromonies&quot; was the culmination of a two-night event sponsored by Metal Hammer magazine in which the band played material spanning their career. Performed at London&#x27;s O2 Shepherds Bush Empire, the band performed to sell-out crowds. The &#x27;Ceromonies&#x27; line-up for this event that featured on the live album and DVD was McCoy, Carter, King, Edwards, and Newell. Highlights of this period included the band&#x27;s biggest-ever headline show to date at the 2008 M&#x27;era Luna Festival, where the &#x27;Ceromonies&#x27; line-up performed in front of over 23,000 people. The rapturous encore from this show, &quot;Last Exit for the Lost,&quot; was also included on &quot;Ceromonies&quot;.

In June 2008, a DVD entitled &quot;Live in Düsseldorf 1991&quot; was released. Sacred Symphony released the DVD and double CD box set as well as a double LP vinyl version of &quot;Ceromonies (Ad Mortem Ad Vitam)&quot; on 16 April 2012, consisting of recordings and footage from the two concerts. The vinyl version does not come with the live DVD. It was also released as a collectible box set coming in a wooden box with the Ceromonies logo and title branded on the wooden lid.

=== 2014–present ===

On 1 July 2014, Carl McCoy announced that the band was back in the studio &quot;...recording and compiling the most important elements created and gathered.&quot; In December 2014, the band debuted two new songs live onstage, &quot;Earthbound&quot; and &quot;Prophecy&quot;. &quot;Prophecy&quot; was produced, engineered, and mixed by Carl McCoy and mastered by Maor Appelbaum. The single was released as a 7&quot; vinyl single and as an online single on the Sacred Symphony label, available only as a download on iTunes on 17 March 2016. It was promoted as a band single, but the track did not feature Pettitt. News reports said that a release on both CD and vinyl, containing exclusive artwork and bonus material, would follow, though this did not happen.

Tom Edwards died in 2017 from heart failure while touring in the US with Adam Ant.

Drummer Lee Newell announced that he quit the band, citing personal reasons regarding a move to the US.

M&#x27;era Luna organizers announced in July of 2023 via social media that Fields of the Nephilim would not be performing at that year’s festival.

==Musical style and imagery==
Fields of the Nephilim&#x27;s initial sound incorporated elements of hard rock, gothic rock, heavy metal, and psychedelic rock, and comprised a bass- and guitar-driven sound underpinned by McCoy&#x27;s growled vocals. Lyrically, the band incorporated themes concerning magic (specifically chaos magic), the Cthulhu Mythos, the Sumerian religion, and the works of Aleister Crowley.

Bassist Tony Pettitt cited musical influences including Joy Division, the Velvet Underground and dub reggae, however, McCoy has also stated in interviews that the band &quot;wasn&#x27;t influenced by other musicians&quot;.

The band had a &quot;dust and death&quot; image, associated with characters from Sergio Leone&#x27;s Spaghetti Westerns and often wore cowboy dusters with a weather-beaten look during photoshoots. This weather-beaten look was attained by dusting themselves down with, by their own admission, Mother&#x27;s Pride flour. This also proved problematic for the band as in May 1988, Nottinghamshire Police detained the band while a suspect substance was tested for drugs. This was later determined to be nothing but flour from the stage set.

== Legacy ==

In 2001, Nod and Paul Wright formed a new band, Last Rites. They released two full-length albums: &quot;Guided by Light&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Many Forms&quot; (2005).

Pettitt performed in The Eden House and NFD.

Cian Houchin has performed and recorded albums as the frontman for Saints of Eden.

Fields of the Nephilim have been cited as an influence by musicians including Watain, Katatonia, Gatecreeper, Enslaved, Harald Nævdal of Immortal and Old Funeral, Nergal of Behemoth and Mille Petrozza of Kreator.

=== Parody ===
From 1988, during the band&#x27;s period of mainstream attention following the release of &quot;Dawnrazor&quot; and &quot;Psychonaut&quot;, the music newspaper &quot;Melody Maker&quot; published various spoof articles about the band. This culminated in a regular feature called &quot;The Nod Corner&quot;, which purported to be written by Nephilim drummer Nod Wright and which took a satirical view of the band&#x27;s baleful and dramatic image, usually portraying McCoy as a prima donna who exploited and bullied Nod. Wright appeared to take the spoof graciously.

<text>Prose poetry is poetry written in prose form instead of verse form while otherwise deferring to poetic devices to make meaning.

==Characteristics==
Prose poetry is written as prose, without the line breaks associated with poetry. However, it makes use of poetic devices such as fragmentation, compression, repetition, rhyme, metaphor, and figures of speech. Prose can still express the lyricism and emotion of poetry, and can also explore many different themes. There are subgenres within the prose genre, and these include styles like deadpan narrative, surreal narrative, factoid, and postcard. Prose offers a lot of creative freedom to writers, and does not contain as many rules as some poetic styles do. Many writers have different opinions on the form of this genre because it is so open, which makes it harder to objectively define. The prose genre has been used and explored by writers like Walt Whitman, Franz Kafka, Naomi Shihab Nye, and Anne Carson. Almost every form of art can be categorized under either the prose or poetry genre. Poetry covers forms like song lyrics, different poetry forms, and dialogue that contains poetic characteristics like iambic pentameter. On the other hand, prose includes novels, short stories, novellas, and scripts.

==History==
Although the Bible is written in prose, it maintains poetic features such as rhythms and lyricism. 

In 17th-century Japan, Matsuo Bashō originated &quot;haibun&quot;, a form of prose poetry combining haiku with prose. It is best exemplified by his book &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot;, in which he used a literary genre of prose-and-poetry composition of multidimensional writing.

In the West, prose poetry originated in early-19th-century France and Germany as a reaction against the traditional verse line. 
The German Romantics Jean Paul, Novalis, Friedrich Hölderlin, and Heinrich Heine may be seen as precursors of the prose poem. Earlier, 18th-century European forerunners of prose poetry had included James Macpherson&#x27;s &quot;translation&quot; of &quot;Ossian&quot; and Évariste de Parny&#x27;s &quot;Chansons madécasses&quot;.
At the time of the prose poem&#x27;s establishment as a form, French poetry was dominated by the alexandrine, a strict and demanding form that poets starting with Maurice de Guérin (whose &quot;Le Centaure&quot; and &quot;La Bacchante&quot; remain arguably the most powerful prose poems ever written ) and Aloysius Bertrand (in Gaspard de la nuit) chose, in almost complete isolation, to cease using. Later Charles Baudelaire, Arthur Rimbaud, and Stéphane Mallarmé followed their example in works like &quot;Paris Spleen&quot; and &quot;Illuminations&quot;. The prose poem continued to be written in France into the 20th century by such writers as Max Jacob, Henri Michaux, Gertrude Stein, and Francis Ponge.

In Poland, Juliusz Słowacki wrote a prose poem, &quot;Anhelli&quot;, in 1837. Bolesław Prus (1847–1912), influenced by the French prose poets, wrote a number of poetic micro-stories, including &quot;Mold of the Earth&quot; (1884), &quot;&quot; (1884) and &quot;Shades&quot; (1885). His somewhat longer story, &quot;&quot; (1888), likewise shows many features of prose poetry.

In 1877–1882 Russian novelist Turgenev wrote several &#x27;Poems in prose&#x27; (Стихотворения в прозе) which have neither poetic rhythm nor rhymes but resemble poetry in concise but expressive form.

The writings of Syrian poet and writer Francis Marrash (1836–73) featured the first examples of prose poetry in modern Arabic literature. From the mid-20th century, the great Arab exponent of prose poetry was the Syrian poet, Adunis (Ali Ahmad Said Esber, born 1930), a perennial contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature.

The Modernist poet T. S. Eliot wrote vehemently against prose poems. He added to the debate about what defines the genre, writing in his introduction to Djuna Barnes&#x27; highly poeticized 1936 novel &quot;Nightwood&quot; that it could not be classed as &quot;poetic prose&quot; as it did not show the rhythm or &quot;musical pattern&quot; of verse. By contrast, other Modernist authors, including Gertrude Stein and Sherwood Anderson, consistently wrote prose poetry. Poet and critic Donald Sidney-Fryer, a leading scholar of the works of American poet Clark Ashton Smith, praised &quot;the extremely picturesque or pictorial character of many of Smith&#x27;s typical, far-ranging, and most polished fantasies, his extended poems in prose.&quot; Canadian author Elizabeth Smart&#x27;s &quot;By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept&quot; (1945) is a relatively isolated example of mid-20th-century English-language poetic prose.

Prose poems made a resurgence in the early 1950s and in the 1960s with American poets Allen Ginsberg, Bob Dylan, Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs, Russell Edson, Charles Simic, Robert Bly, John Ashbery, and James Wright. Simic won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for his 1989 collection, &quot;The World Doesn&#x27;t End&quot;.

Since the late 1980s, prose poetry has gained in popularity. Journals have begun specializing in prose poems or microfiction. In the United Kingdom, Stride Books published a 1993 anthology of prose poetry, &quot;A Curious Architecture&quot;.

<doc id="174387" wikidata="Q4746911" url="?curid=174387" title="Tree of life (biblical)">
<text>In Judaism and Christianity, the tree of life (; ) is first described in of the Book of Genesis as being &quot;in the midst of the Garden of Eden&quot; with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (; ). After the fall of man, &quot;lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever&quot;, cherubim and a flaming sword are placed at the east end of the Garden to guard the way to the tree of life. The tree of life has become the subject of some debate as to whether or not the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is the same tree.

In the Bible outside of Genesis, the term &quot;tree of life&quot; appears in Proverbs () and Revelation (). It also appears in 2 Esdras () and 4 Maccabees (), which are included among the Jewish apocrypha. 

According to the Greek Apocalypse of Moses, the tree of life is also called the Tree of Mercy. Adam believed the oil of the tree of life would relieve him of his ailments and sent Seth and Eve to the doors of the Garden to beg for some oil of the tree of life.

== Number of trees ==
Karl Budde, in his critical study of 1883, proposed that there was only one tree in the body of the Genesis narrative, and that it had been portrayed in two ways: one as the tree in the middle of the Garden, and two as the forbidden tree. Claus Westermann gave recognition to Budde&#x27;s theory in 1976.

Ellen van Wolde noted that among Bible scholars &quot;the trees are almost always dealt with separately and not related to each other&quot; and that &quot;attention is almost exclusively directed to the tree of knowledge of good and evil, whereas the tree of life is paid hardly any attention.&quot;

==Religious views==

===Christianity===

==== Catholic Church ====
In the Catholic Church the Tree of Life in Book of Revelation verse 2:7 is the Eucharist.

====Eastern Christianity====
The Eastern Orthodox Church has traditionally understood the tree of life in Genesis as a prefiguration of the Cross, which humanity could not partake of until after the incarnation, death and resurrection of Jesus.

====Western Christianity====

In &quot;The City of God&quot; (xiii.20–21), Augustine of Hippo offers great allowance for &quot;spiritual&quot; interpretations of the events in the garden, so long as such allegories do not rob the narrative of its historical reality. Enlightenment theologians (culminating perhaps in Brunner and Niebuhr in the twentieth century) sought for figurative interpretations because they had already dismissed the historical possibility of the story.

Others sought very pragmatic understandings of the tree. In the &quot;Summa Theologica&quot; (Q97), Thomas Aquinas argued that the tree served to maintain Adam&#x27;s biological processes for an extended earthly animal life. It did not provide immortality as such, for the tree, being finite, could not grant infinite life. Hence after a period of time, the man and woman would need to eat again from the tree or else be &quot;transported to the spiritual life.&quot; The common fruit trees of the garden were given to offset the effects of &quot;loss of moisture&quot; (note the doctrine of the humors at work), while the tree of life was intended to offset the inefficiencies of the body. Following Augustine in the &quot;City of God&quot; (xiv.26), “man was furnished with food against hunger, with drink against thirst, and with the tree of life against the ravages of old age.”

John Calvin (&quot;Commentary on Genesis&quot; 2:8), following a different thread in Augustine (&quot;City of God&quot;, xiii.20), understood the tree in sacramental language. Given that humanity cannot exist except within a covenantal relationship with God, and all covenants use symbols to give us &quot;the attestation of his grace&quot;, he gives the tree, &quot;not because it could confer on man that life with which he had been previously endued, but in order that it might be a symbol and memorial of the life which he had received from God.&quot; God often uses symbols; he doesn&#x27;t transfer his power into these outward signs, but &quot;by them He stretches out His hand to us, because, without assistance, we cannot ascend to Him.&quot; Thus he intends man, as often as he eats the fruit, to remember the source of his life, and acknowledge that he lives not by his own power, but by God&#x27;s kindness. Calvin denies (contra Aquinas and without mentioning his name) that the tree served as a biological defense against physical aging. This is the standing interpretation in modern Reformed theology as well.

===Judaism===
According to Jewish mythology, in the Garden of Eden there is a tree of life or the &quot;tree of souls&quot; that blossoms and produces new souls, which fall into the Guf, the &quot;Treasury of Souls&quot;. The Angel Gabriel reaches into the treasury and takes out the first soul that comes into his hand. Then Lailah, the Angel of Conception, watches over the embryo until it is born. 

==== Jewish Mythology ====

The tree of life appears in Asherah iconography, particularly on the Lachish ewer and Pithos A from Kuntillet Ajrud, where it is flanked by ibexes. The tree’s design, with buds, flowers, and possibly almond drupes, resembles the menorah, which is thought to represent a stylized almond tree in Exodus 25:31-36 This suggests a continuation of Asherah’s cultic representation in the temple. Scholars have explored these connections, noting parallels between sacred trees, Asherah, and the menorah.

====Kabbalah====
The tree of life is represented in several examples of sacred geometry and is central in particular to the Kabbalah, where it is represented as a diagram of ten nodes called sefirot (singular sefirah), or the ten emanations or attributes of God. It portrays how God, the Creator, demonstrates his creative energy throughout the universe, via angels and then to humans. Each of the tree&#x27;s branches (sefirot) represents a different category of creative force that is overseen by a different Archangel. Believers claim that by focusing on the various energies one by one, people can develop a closer spiritual union with God. Kabbalah is an esoteric method, discipline and school of thought in Jewish mysticism.

==In popular culture==
The tree of life is mentioned explicitly in the 2006 film &quot;The Fountain&quot;; it is discussed in connection with the Hebrew Genesis book.

In the 1995 Anime &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, beings known as Angels possess the “fruit of life”, which provides them with infinite energy, enabling regeneration and shapeshifting, among other abilities.

<text>The Clinton–Lewinsky scandal was a sex scandal involving Bill Clinton, the president of the United States, and Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern. Their sexual relationship began in 1995—when Clinton was 49 years old and Lewinsky was 22 years old—and lasted 18 months, ending in 1997. Clinton ended televised remarks on January 26, 1998, with the later infamous statement: &quot;I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky.&quot; Further investigation led to charges of perjury and to the impeachment of Clinton in 1998 by the U.S. House of Representatives. He was subsequently acquitted on all impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in a 21-day U.S. Senate trial.

Clinton was held in civil contempt of court by Judge Susan Webber Wright for giving misleading testimony in the Paula Jones case regarding Lewinsky, and was also fined $90,000 by Wright. His license to practice law was suspended in Arkansas for five years; shortly thereafter, he was disbarred from presenting cases in front of the U.S. Supreme Court.

Lewinsky was a graduate of Lewis &amp; Clark College. She was hired during Clinton&#x27;s first term in 1995 as an intern at the White House through the White House Internship Program and was later an employee of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs. It is believed that Clinton began a personal relationship with her while she worked at the White House, the details of which she later confided to Linda Tripp, her Defense Department co-worker who secretly recorded their telephone conversations.

In January 1998, Tripp discovered that Lewinsky had sworn an affidavit in the Paula Jones case, denying a relationship with Clinton. She delivered tapes to Ken Starr, the independent counsel who was investigating Clinton on other matters, including the Whitewater controversy, the White House FBI files controversy, and the White House travel office controversy. During the grand jury testimony, Clinton&#x27;s responses were carefully worded, and he argued &quot;it depends on what the meaning of the word &quot;is&quot; is&quot;, with regard to the truthfulness of his statement that &quot;there is not a sexual relationship, an improper sexual relationship or any other kind of improper relationship&quot;.

This scandal has sometimes been referred to as &quot;Monicagate&quot;, &quot;Lewinskygate&quot;, &quot;Tailgate&quot;, &quot;Sexgate&quot;, and &quot;Zippergate&quot;, following the &quot;-gate&quot; construction that has been used since the Watergate scandal.

==Allegations of sexual contact==

Lewinsky said she had sexual encounters with Bill Clinton on nine occasions from November 1995 to March 1997. According to her published schedule, First Lady Hillary Clinton was at the White House for at least some portion of seven of those days.

In April 1996, Lewinsky&#x27;s superiors relocated her job to the Pentagon, because they felt she was spending too much time around Clinton. According to his autobiography, then-United Nations Ambassador Bill Richardson was asked by the White House in 1997 to interview Lewinsky for a job on his staff at the United Nations. Richardson did so, and offered her a position, which she declined. &quot;The American Spectator&quot; alleged that Richardson knew more about the Lewinsky affair than he declared to the grand jury.

Lewinsky confided in Linda Tripp about her relationship with Clinton. Tripp persuaded Lewinsky to save the gifts Clinton had given her, and not to dry clean a semen-stained blue dress to keep it as an &quot;insurance policy.&quot; Tripp reported their conversations to literary agent Lucianne Goldberg, who advised her to secretly record them, which Tripp began doing in September 1997. Goldberg also urged Tripp to take the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and bring them to the attention of people working on the Paula Jones case. In the fall of 1997, Goldberg began speaking to reporters (including Michael Isikoff of &quot;Newsweek&quot;) about the tapes.

In the Paula Jones case, Lewinsky had submitted an affidavit that denied any physical relationship with Clinton. In January 1998, she attempted to persuade Tripp to commit perjury in the Jones case. Instead, Tripp gave the tapes to Starr, who was investigating the Whitewater controversy and other matters. Starr was now armed with evidence of Lewinsky&#x27;s admission of a physical relationship with Clinton, and he broadened the investigation to include Lewinsky and her possible perjury in the Jones case.

==Denial and subsequent admission==
News of the scandal first broke on January 17, 1998, on the &quot;Drudge Report&quot;, which reported that &quot;Newsweek&quot; editors were sitting on a story by investigative reporter Michael Isikoff exposing the affair. The story broke in the mainstream press on January 21 in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. The story swirled for several days and, despite swift denials from Clinton, the clamor for answers from the White House grew louder. On January 26, President Clinton, standing with his wife, spoke at a White House press conference, and issued a denial in which he said:

Pundits debated whether Clinton would address the allegations in his State of the Union Address. Ultimately, he chose not to mention them. Hillary Clinton remained supportive of her husband throughout the scandal. On January 27, in an appearance on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; she said, &quot;The great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.&quot;

For the next several months and through the summer, the media debated whether or not an affair had occurred and whether or not Clinton had lied or obstructed justice, but nothing could be definitively established beyond the taped recordings because Lewinsky was unwilling to discuss the affair or testify about it. On July 28, 1998, a substantial delay after the public break of the scandal, Lewinsky received transactional immunity in exchange for grand jury testimony concerning her relationship with Clinton. She also turned over a semen-stained blue dress (which Tripp had encouraged her to save without dry cleaning) to the Starr investigators. The FBI tested the dress and matched the semen stains to a blood sample from Clinton, thereby providing unambiguous circumstantial evidence that proved the relationship despite Clinton&#x27;s official denials.

Clinton admitted in a taped grand jury testimony on August 17, 1998, that he had engaged in an &quot;improper physical relationship&quot; with Lewinsky. That evening he gave a nationally televised statement admitting that his relationship with Lewinsky was &quot;not appropriate&quot;.

On August 20, 1998, three days after Clinton testified on the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Operation Infinite Reach launched missile attacks against al-Qaeda bases in Khost, Afghanistan, and the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum, Sudan, in retaliation for the 1998 United States embassy bombings. Some countries, media outlets, protesters, and Republicans accused Clinton of ordering the attacks as a diversion. The attacks also drew parallels to the then-recently released movie &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;, which features a fictional president faking a war in Albania to distract attention from a sex scandal. Administration officials denied any connection between the missile strikes and the ongoing scandal, and 9/11 Commission investigators found no reason to dispute those statements. The missile strikes also caused anti-Semitic canards to spread in the Middle East that Lewinsky was a Jewish agent sent to influence Clinton against supporting the Palestinians. This conspiracy theory would influence Mohamed Atta, the ringleader of al-Qaeda&#x27;s Hamburg cell and the September 11 attacks.

==Perjury charges==

In his deposition for the Jones lawsuit, Clinton denied having sexual relations with Lewinsky. Based on the evidence—a blue dress with Clinton&#x27;s semen that Lewinsky provided—Starr concluded that the president&#x27;s sworn testimony was perjurious.

During the deposition, Clinton was asked &quot;Have you ever had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, as that term is defined in Deposition Exhibit1?&quot; The judge ordered that Clinton be given an opportunity to review the agreed definition. Afterwards, based on the definition created by the Independent Counsel&#x27;s Office, Clinton answered, &quot;I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.&quot; Clinton later said, &quot;I thought the definition included any activity by [me], where [I] was the actor and came in contact with those parts of the bodies&quot; which had been explicitly listed (and &quot;with an intent to gratify or arouse the sexual desire of any person&quot;). In other words, Clinton denied that &quot;he&quot; had ever contacted &quot;Lewinsky&#x27;s&quot; &quot;genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks&quot;, and effectively claimed that the agreed-upon definition of &quot;sexual relations&quot; included &quot;giving&quot; oral sex but excluded &quot;receiving&quot; oral sex.

Two months after the Senate failed to convict him, President Clinton was held in civil contempt of court by Judge Susan Webber Wright for giving misleading testimony regarding his sexual relationship with Lewinsky, and was also fined $90,000 by Wright. Clinton declined to appeal the civil contempt of court ruling, citing financial problems, but still maintained that his testimony complied with Wright&#x27;s earlier definition of sexual relations. In 2001, his license to practice law was suspended in Arkansas for five years and later by the United States Supreme Court.

==Impeachment==

In December 1998, Clinton&#x27;s Democratic political party was in the minority in both chambers of Congress. A few Democratic members of Congress, and most in the opposition Republican Party, claimed that Clinton&#x27;s giving false testimony and allegedly influencing Lewinsky&#x27;s testimony were crimes of obstruction of justice and perjury and thus impeachable offenses. After a delay due to a brief bombing campaign in Iraq, the House of Representatives voted to issue two Articles of Impeachment against him which was followed by a 21-day trial in the Senate.

Clinton was acquitted on both counts as neither received the necessary two-thirds majority vote of the senators present. Between 45 and 50 senators voted to convict, depending on the charge, short of the 67 votes needed for conviction and removal from office. All the Democrats in the Senate voted for acquittal on both the perjury and the obstruction of justice charges. Ten Republicans voted for acquittal for perjury: John Chafee (Rhode Island), Susan Collins (Maine), Slade Gorton (Washington), Jim Jeffords (Vermont), Richard Shelby (Alabama), Olympia Snowe (Maine), Arlen Specter (Pennsylvania), Ted Stevens (Alaska), Fred Thompson (Tennessee), and John Warner (Virginia). Five Republicans voted for acquittal for obstruction of justice: Chafee, Collins, Jeffords, Snowe, and Specter.

President Clinton was thereby acquitted of all charges and remained in office. There were attempts to censure the president by the House of Representatives, but those attempts failed.

==Aftermath==
===Effect on 2000 presidential election===

The scandal arguably affected the 2000 U.S. presidential election in two quite different ways. Democratic Party candidate and sitting vice president Al Gore said that Clinton&#x27;s scandal had been &quot;a drag&quot; that deflated the enthusiasm of their party&#x27;s base, and had the effect of reducing Democratic votes. Clinton said the scandal had made Gore&#x27;s campaign too cautious, and that if Clinton had been allowed to campaign for Gore in Arkansas and New Hampshire, either state would have delivered Gore&#x27;s needed electoral votes regardless of the effects of the Florida recount controversy.

Political analysts have supported both views. Before and after the 2000 election, John Cochran of ABC News connected the Lewinsky scandal with a voter phenomenon he called &quot;Clinton fatigue&quot;. Polling showed that the scandal continued to affect Clinton&#x27;s low &quot;personal approval&quot; ratings through the election, and analysts such as Vanderbilt University&#x27;s John G. Geer later concluded &quot;Clinton fatigue or a kind of moral retrospective voting had a significant impact on Gore&#x27;s chances&quot;. Other analysts sided with Clinton&#x27;s argument, and argued that Gore&#x27;s refusal to have Clinton campaign with him damaged his appeal.

===Collateral scandals===

During the scandal, supporters of former president Clinton alleged that the matter should remain private, and called some supporting Clinton&#x27;s impeachment hypocritical. A highly publicized investigation campaign actively sought information that might embarrass politicians who supported impeachment. According to the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot;,

Henry Hyde, Republican chair of the House Judiciary Committee and lead House manager, also had an affair while in office as a state legislator. Hyde, aged 70 during the Lewinsky hearings, dismissed it as a &quot;youthful indiscretion&quot; (he had been 41).

Republican congressman Bob Livingston had been widely expected to become Speaker of the United States House of Representatives in the next Congressional session. Then just weeks away after Flynt revealed the affair, Livingston resigned and challenged Clinton to do the same.

Bob Barr (R-GA) another Republican House manager, had an extramarital affair. Barr had been the first lawmaker in either chamber to call for Clinton&#x27;s resignation due to the Lewinsky affair. Barr lost a primary challenge less than three years after the impeachment proceedings.

Dan Burton (R-IN) said, &quot;No one, regardless of what party they serve, no one, regardless of what branch of government they serve, should be allowed to get away with these alleged sexual improprieties...&quot; In 1998, Burton admitted that he himself had had an affair in 1983 which produced a child.

Newt Gingrich (R-GA) US Representative, Speaker of the House and leader of the Republican Revolution of 1994, admitted in 1998 to having had an affair with then House Agriculture Committee staffer Callista Bisek while he was still married to his second wife, at the same time as he was leading the impeachment of Bill Clinton for perjury regarding an affair with intern Monica Lewinsky.

Steven C. LaTourette (R-OH) US Representative, voted to impeach Bill Clinton for the Lewinsky scandal while he was having a long-term affair with his chief of staff, Jennifer Laptook.

Republican Helen Chenoweth-Hage from Idaho aggressively called for the resignation of President Clinton and then admitted to her own six-year affair with a married rancher during the 1980s.

===Personal acceptance===

Historian Taylor Branch implied that Clinton had requested changes to his 2009 biography, &quot;The Clinton Tapes: Wrestling History with the President&quot;, regarding Clinton&#x27;s revelation that the Lewinsky affair began because &quot;I cracked; I just cracked.&quot; Branch writes that Clinton had felt &quot;beleaguered, unappreciated, and open to a liaison with Lewinsky&quot; following &quot;the Democrats&#x27; loss of Congress in the November 1994 elections, the death of his mother the previous January, and the ongoing Whitewater investigation&quot;. Publicly, Clinton had previously blamed the affair on &quot;a terrible moral error&quot; and on anger at Republicans, stating, &quot;if people have unresolved anger, it makes them do non-rational, destructive things&quot;.

==Legacy and retrospective assessment==

The Clinton-Lewinsky scandal was subject to widespread media coverage, resulting in considerable difficulties for Monica Lewinsky later in life as she attempted to find employment. In 2014, she publicly re-emerged as an activist against cyberbullying and public shaming after writing the essay &quot;Shame and Survival&quot; for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. Subsequently, several prominent media figures who had covered or mocked Lewinsky during the scandal expressed regret at their role in it. David Letterman remarked &quot;I feel bad about my role in helping push the humiliation to the point of suffocation&quot;.

<text>The Bohr radius () is a physical constant, approximately equal to the most probable distance between the nucleus and the electron in a hydrogen atom in its ground state. It is named after Niels Bohr, due to its role in the Bohr model of an atom. Its value is 

== Definition and value ==

The Bohr radius is defined as
formula_1
where
* formula_2 is the permittivity of free space,
* formula_3 is the reduced Planck constant,
* formula_4 is the mass of an electron,
* formula_5 is the elementary charge,
* formula_6 is the speed of light in vacuum, and
* formula_7 is the fine-structure constant.

The CODATA value of the Bohr radius (in SI units) is 

== History ==

In the Bohr model for atomic structure, put forward by Niels Bohr in 1913, electrons orbit a central nucleus under electrostatic attraction. The original derivation posited that electrons have orbital angular momentum in integer multiples of the reduced Planck constant, which successfully matched the observation of discrete energy levels in emission spectra, along with predicting a fixed radius for each of these levels. In the simplest atom, hydrogen, a single electron orbits the nucleus, and its smallest possible orbit, with the lowest energy, has an orbital radius almost equal to the Bohr radius. (It is not &quot;exactly&quot; the Bohr radius due to the reduced mass effect. They differ by about 0.05%.)

The Bohr model of the atom was superseded by an electron probability cloud adhering to the Schrödinger equation as published in 1926. This is further complicated by spin and quantum vacuum effects to produce fine structure and hyperfine structure. Nevertheless, the Bohr radius formula remains central in atomic physics calculations, due to its simple relationship with fundamental constants (this is why it is defined using the true electron mass rather than the reduced mass, as mentioned above). As such, it became the unit of length in atomic units.

In Schrödinger&#x27;s quantum-mechanical theory of the hydrogen atom, the Bohr radius is the value of the radial coordinate for which the radial probability density of the electron position is highest. The expected value of the radial distance of the electron, by contrast, is .

== Related constants ==
The Bohr radius is one of a trio of related units of length, the other two being the Compton wavelength of the electron (formula_8) and the classical electron radius (formula_9). Any one of these constants can be written in terms of any of the others using the fine-structure constant formula_7:
: formula_11

== Hydrogen atom and similar systems ==
The Bohr radius including the effect of reduced mass in the hydrogen atom is given by
: formula_12
where formula_13 is the reduced mass of the electron–proton system (with formula_14 being the mass of proton). The use of reduced mass is a generalization of the two-body problem from classical physics beyond the case in which the approximation that the mass of the orbiting body is negligible compared to the mass of the body being orbited. Since the reduced mass of the electron–proton system is a little bit smaller than the electron mass, the &quot;reduced&quot; Bohr radius is slightly &quot;larger&quot; than the Bohr radius (formula_15 meters).

This result can be generalized to other systems, such as positronium (an electron orbiting a positron) and muonium (an electron orbiting an anti-muon) by using the reduced mass of the system and considering the possible change in charge. Typically, Bohr model relations (radius, energy, etc.) can be easily modified for these exotic systems (up to lowest order) by simply replacing the electron mass with the reduced mass for the system (as well as adjusting the charge when appropriate). For example, the radius of positronium is approximately formula_16, since the reduced mass of the positronium system is half the electron mass (formula_17).

A hydrogen-like atom will have a Bohr radius which primarily scales as formula_18, with formula_19 the number of protons in the nucleus. Meanwhile, the reduced mass (formula_20) only becomes better approximated by formula_21 in the limit of increasing nuclear mass. These results are summarized in the equation
: formula_22

A table of approximate relationships is given below.

<doc id="174397" wikidata="Q1189255" url="?curid=174397" title="Computer addiction">
<text>Computer addiction is a form of behavioral addiction that can be described as the excessive or compulsive use of the computer, which persists despite serious negative consequences for personal, social, or occupational function. Another clear conceptualization is made by J. J. Block, who stated in a journal entry for the &quot;American Journal of Psychiatry&quot; that &quot;Conceptually, the diagnosis is a compulsive-impulsive spectrum disorder that involves online and/or offline computer usage and consists of at least three subtypes: excessive gaming, sexual preoccupations, and e-mail/text messaging&quot;. Computer addiction is not currently included in the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)&quot; as an official disorder. The concept of computer addiction is broadly divided into two types, namely offline computer addiction, and online computer addiction. Offline computer addiction is normally used when speaking about excessive gaming behavior, which can be practiced both offline and online. Online computer addiction, also known as Internet addiction, gets more attention in general from scientific research than offline computer addiction, mainly because most cases of computer addiction are related to the excessive use of the Internet.

Experts on Internet addiction have described this syndrome as an individual working intensely on the Internet, prolonged use of the Internet, uncontrollable use of the Internet, unable to use the Internet in an efficient, timely matter, not being interested in the outside world, not spending time with people from the outside world, and an increase in their loneliness and dejection. 

==Symptoms==
*Being drawn by the computer as soon as one wakes up and before one goes to bed
*Replacing old hobbies with excessive use of the computer and using the computer as one&#x27;s primary source of entertainment and procrastination
*Lacking physical exercise and/or outdoor exposure because of constant use of the computer, which could contribute to many health problems such as obesity
*Backache
*Headaches
*Weight gain or loss
*Disturbances in sleep
*Carpal tunnel syndrome
*Blurred or strained vision
*Depression and marital infidelity

==Effects==
Excessive computer use may result in, or occur with:

* Lack of face to face social interaction
* Computer vision syndrome

==Causes==
Kimberly Young indicates that previous research links internet/computer addiction with existing mental health issues, most notably depression. She states that computer addiction has significant effects socially, such as low self-esteem, psychologically and occupationally, which led many subjects to academic failure.

According to a Korean study on internet/computer addiction, pathological use of the internet results in negative life impacts such as job loss, marriage breakdown, financial debt, and academic failure. 70% of internet users in Korea are reported to play online games, 18% of whom are diagnosed as game addicts, which relates to internet/computer addiction. The authors of the article conducted a study using Kimberly Young&#x27;s questionnaire. The study showed that the majority of those who met the requirements of internet/computer addiction experienced interpersonal difficulties and stress and that those addicted to online games specifically responded that they hoped to avoid reality.

==Types==
Computers nowadays rely almost entirely on the internet, and thus relevant research articles relating to internet addiction may also be relevant to computer addiction.

* Gaming addiction: a hypothetical behavioral addiction characterized by excessive or compulsive use of computer games or video games, which interferes with a person&#x27;s everyday life. Video game addiction may present itself as compulsive gaming, social isolation, mood swings, diminished imagination, and hyper-focus on in-game achievements, to the exclusion of other events in life.
* Social media addiction: Data suggest that participants use social media to fulfill their social needs but are typically dissatisfied.  Lonely individuals are drawn to the Internet for emotional support. This could interfere with &quot;real-life socializing&quot; by reducing face-to-face relationships. Some of these views are summed up in an Atlantic article by Stephen Marche entitled &quot;Is Facebook Making Us Lonely?,&quot; in which the author argues that social media provides more breadth, but not the depth of relationships that humans require and that users begin to find it difficult to distinguish between the meaningful relationships which we foster in the real world and the numerous casual relationships that are formed through social media.

== Cyberstalking ==
According to Prof. Jordana N. Navarro et al. Cyberstalking is known as a behavior that includes but not limited to internet or technology use to stalk or harass an individual over time and in a menacing fashion. Cyberstalking has been on the rise since the 1990s. These cryptic behaviors are also noticeable. Many of the cyberstalking cases are from people that do not know each other. Cyberstalkers are not limited to geographical boundaries, research has suggested various impulses in cyberstalking aside from excreting power and control over the target. Internet addiction and cyberstalking share several key traits that should lend support to new investigations to further scrutinize the relationship between the two disorders. Studies have shown that cyberstalkers can have different motives, but these results are not necessarily indicative of mental health issues. A cyberstalker is usually an emotionally damaged individual, a loner who seeks attention, gratification, and connection and in the process becomes infatuated with someone (Navarro et al. 2015)

== Diagnostic Test==
Many studies and surveys are being conducted to measure the extent of this type of addiction. Kimberly Young has created a questionnaire based on other disorders to assess the level of addiction. It is called the Internet Addict Diagnostic Questionnaire or IADQ. The questionnaire asks users about their online usage habits as well as their feelings about their internet usage. According to the IADQ sample, Internet Addiction resembles that of a Gambling disorder. Answering positively to five out of the eight questions on the IADQ may be indicative of online addiction.

According to the article &quot;Validating the Distinction between Computer Addiction and Engagement: Online Game Playing and Personality&quot;, the authors introduced a test to help identify the differences between addiction and engagement. Based on similar ideas, here are some ways to distinguish between computer engagement and addiction.
==Origin of the term and history==

Observations about the addictiveness of computers, and more specifically, computer games date back at least to the mid-1970s. Addiction and addictive behavior were common among the users of the PLATO system at the University of Illinois. British e-learning academic Nicholas Rushby suggested in his 1979 book, &quot;An Introduction to Educational Computing&quot;, that people can be addicted to computers and experience withdrawal symptoms. The term was also used by M. Shotton in 1989 in her book &quot;Computer Addiction&quot;. However, Shotton concludes that the &#x27;addicts&#x27; are not truly addicted. Dependency on computers, she argues, is better understood as a challenging and exciting pastime that can also lead to a professional career in the field. Computers do not turn gregarious, extroverted people into recluses; instead, they offer introverts a source of inspiration, excitement, and intellectual stimulation. Shotton&#x27;s work seriously questions the legitimacy of the claim that computers cause addiction.

The term became more widespread with the explosive growth of the Internet, as well the availability of the personal computer. Computers and the Internet both started to take shape as a personal and comfortable medium that could be used by anyone who wanted to make use of it. With that explosive growth of individuals making use of PCs and the Internet, the question started to arise whether or not misuse or excessive use of these new technologies could be possible as well. It was hypothesized that, like any technology aimed specifically at human consumption and use, abuse could have severe consequences for the individual in the short term and the society in the long term. In the late nineties people who made use of PCs and the internet were already referred to the term webaholics or cyberholics. Pratarelli et al. suggested at that point already to label &quot;a cluster of behaviors potentially causing problems&quot; as a computer or Internet addiction.
There are other examples of computer overuse that date back to the earliest computer games. Press reports have furthermore noted that some Finnish Defence Forces conscripts were not mature enough to meet the demands of military life and were required to interrupt or postpone military service for a year. One reported source of the lack of needed social skills is an overuse of computer games or the Internet. Forbes termed this overuse &quot;Web fixations&quot;, and stated that they were responsible for 12 such interruptions or deferrals over the 5 years from 2000 to 2005.

<doc id="174407" wikidata="Q960840" url="?curid=174407" title="Goodbye, Columbus">
<text>Goodbye, Columbus is a 1959 collection of fiction by the American novelist Philip Roth. The compilation includes the title novella, &quot;Goodbye, Columbus,&quot; originally published in &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, along with five short stories. It was Roth&#x27;s first book and was published by Houghton Mifflin.

In addition to the title novella, set in Short Hills, New Jersey, &quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot; contains the five short stories &quot;The Conversion of the Jews&quot;, &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot;, &quot;Epstein&quot;, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Tell a Man by the Song He Sings&quot;, and &quot;Eli, the Fanatic&quot;. Each story deals with the concerns of second and third-generation assimilated American Jews as they leave the ethnic ghettos of their parents and grandparents and go on to college, to white-collar professions, and to life in the suburbs.

The book was a critical success for Roth and won the 1960 U.S. National Book Award for Fiction. The book was not without controversy, as people within the Jewish community took issue with Roth&#x27;s less than flattering portrayal of some characters. The short story “Defender of the Faith”, about a Jewish sergeant who is exploited by three shirking, coreligionist draftees, drew particular ire. When Roth in 1962 appeared on a panel alongside the distinguished black novelist Ralph Ellison to discuss minority representation in literature, the questions directed at him became denunciations. Many accused Roth of being a self-hating Jew, a label that stuck with him for years.

The title novella was made into the 1969 film &quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot;, starring Ali MacGraw and Richard Benjamin.

==Roth&#x27;s own retrospective reckoning==

Roth wrote in the preface to the book&#x27;s 30th anniversary edition: &quot;With clarity and with crudeness, and a great deal of exuberance, the embryonic writer who was me wrote these stories in his early 20s, while he was a graduate student at the University of Chicago, a soldier stationed in New Jersey and Washington, and a novice English instructor back at Chicago following his Army discharge...In the beginning it amazed him that any literate audience could seriously be interested in his story of tribal secrets, in what he knew, as a child of his neighborhood, about the rites and taboos of his clan—about their aversions, their aspirations, their fears of deviance and defection, their embarrassments and ideas of success.&quot;

==The novella==
The title story of the collection, &quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot;, is an irreverent look at the life of middle-class Jewish Americans, satirizing, according to one reviewer, their &quot;complacency, parochialism, and materialism.&quot; It was controversial with reviewers, who were highly polarized in their judgments.

The story is told by the narrator, Neil Klugman, who is working in a low-paying position in the Newark Public Library. He lives with his Aunt Gladys and Uncle Max in a working-class neighborhood of Newark, New Jersey. One summer, Neil meets and falls for Brenda Patimkin, a student at Radcliffe College who is from a wealthy family living in the affluent suburb of Short Hills. Neil persuades Brenda to get a diaphragm, which her mother discovers.

The novella was adapted into a film of the same name in 1969.

===Its title===
The title “Goodbye, Columbus” is a quote from a song that was sung by the departing seniors, including Brenda&#x27;s brother, Ron, at their graduation from The Ohio State University at Columbus. Ron dearly enjoys listening to a record of the song that evokes his years as a varsity athlete on a campus where sports are important. By listening to the record for a few years and later having Neil listen along, he is given continuing proof of the Patimkins&#x27; success at assimilation. As the story proceeds, Neil finds that his relationship with Brenda is falling apart. Thus, the alma-mater nostalgia of the novella&#x27;s title can be heard as a choral parallel to Neil&#x27;s saying goodbye to the affluent, assimilated world of the Patimkins and, in his unreported future, remembering, re-evaluating and possibly, in low moments or periods, missing it and them.

A New York Yiddish theater song of 1926 (seven years before Philip Roth&#x27;s birth) includes lyrics whose translation is &quot;I’m going home...I’m going to Palestine...Goodbye, Columbus.&quot; The rhythm of this Jewish song is that of a march. The novella’s title restates or points at the proud and emotional rejection of assimilation that was belted out in this song by an East-European Jew who had immigrated to the U.S. This song&#x27;s Columbus is not a campus but rather the well-known explorer who induced Europeans to follow him to America, and its &quot;Goodbye&quot; (unlike the one in the college song) is neither a sentimental summation nor a grateful or admiring one.

The title functions as a trick: to tempt and enable a reader to simultaneously hear the point that is made by &quot;Goodbye&quot; in each of the two songs (two incompatible points), while watching Neil ambivalently and uncomfortably tip back and forth between the two of them, and to simultaneously feel those attitudes and Roth&#x27;s attitudes toward them, in order to see, among other things, the incompleteness and distortedness of each of the three goodbye-sayers&#x27; view of what he is saying goodbye to. It is a magic trick, though not of the kind that stops the members of a magician&#x27;s audience from glimpsing what is happening two feet away from what they have all fixed their gaze on. Quite the contrary: The trick illuminates what is murky and unconscious.

==Short stories==

===&quot;The Conversion of the Jews&quot;===
This short story, which first appeared in &quot;The Paris Review&quot; (issue 18, Spring 1958) — deals with the themes of questioning religion and being violent to one another because of it.

Ozzie Freedman, a Jewish-American boy about thirteen years old, confronts his Hebrew school teacher, Rabbi Binder, with challenging questions: especially, whether it is possible that God gave the Virgin Mary a child without having intercourse. Rabbi Binder interprets Ozzie&#x27;s question about the virgin birth as impertinent, though Ozzie sincerely wishes to better understand God and his faith. When Ozzie continues to ask challenging questions, Binder slaps him on the face, accidentally bloodying Ozzie&#x27;s nose. Ozzie calls Binder a bastard and, without thinking, runs to the roof of the synagogue. Once there, Ozzie threatens to jump.

The rabbi and pupils go out to watch Ozzie from the pavement and try to convince him not to leap. Ozzie&#x27;s mother arrives. Ozzie threatens to jump unless they all bow on their knees in the Christian tradition and admit that God can make a virgin birth, and furthermore, that they believe in Jesus Christ; he then admonishes all those present that they should never &quot;hit anyone about God&quot;. He finally ends by jumping off the roof onto a glowing yellow net held by firemen.

===&quot;Defender of the Faith&quot;===
The story—originally published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on March 7, 1959 (online) — deals with a Jewish American army sergeant who resists the attempted manipulation of a fellow Jew to exploit their mutual ethnicity to receive special favours. The story caused consternation among Jewish readers and religious groups, as recounted in chapter five of Roth&#x27;s 1988 memoir &quot;The Facts: A Novelist&#x27;s Autobiography&quot;.

===&quot;Epstein&quot;===
The title character goes through a crisis, feeling at age fifty-nine that by accepting the responsibilities of business, marriage, and parenthood, he has missed out on life, and starts an affair with another woman. His wife believes he has syphilis so she wants a divorce, then he has a heart attack.

===&quot;You Can&#x27;t Tell a Man by the Song He Sings&quot;===
An unnamed narrator recalls the events surrounding his meeting with Alberto Pelagutti, a troublemaker, in high school.

===&quot;Eli, the Fanatic&quot;===
The assimilated Jews of a small community express fear that their peaceful coexistence with the Gentiles will be disturbed by the establishment of an Orthodox yeshiva in their neighborhood. Lawyer Eli tries to calm things down, his wife is about to give birth and Eli is suspected to be having a nervous breakdown.

<doc id="174409" wikidata="Q1463237" url="?curid=174409" title="Račak massacre">
<text>The Račak massacre () or Račak operation () was the massacre of 45 Kosovo Albanians that took place in the village of Račak () in central Kosovo in January 1999. The massacre was perpetrated by Serbian security forces in response to Albanian separatist activity in the region. The Serbian government refused to let a war crimes prosecutor visit the site, and maintained that the casualties were all members of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) killed in combat with state security forces.

The killings were investigated by two separate forensic teams, the first a joint Yugoslav–Belarusian team and the second an external Finnish team representing the EU. The first team&#x27;s report, which was commissioned by the Yugoslav government, concluded that those killed, who included a woman and 12-year-old child, were all separatist guerrillas and not civilians. The findings of the second team sharply contradicted the Yugoslav investigation&#x27;s report, determining that the deaths constituted killings of unarmed civilians. The lead Finnish investigator, anthropology expert Dr. Helena Ranta, called it a &quot;crime against humanity&quot;, though refusing as a scientist to directly label it a massacre or assign blame to any specific party. Details of the Finnish team&#x27;s findings were left undisclosed for two years. At the time, reporting of the incident varied from publication to publication and country to country. Media outlets covering it more definitively described the event at Račak as a gruesome terrorist atrocity by a repressive Serbian government.

Bill Clinton, then president of the United States, condemned the massacre as a deliberate and indiscriminate act of murder, and the administration sought to convince the American people that intervention in Yugoslavia was necessary. Public support for intervention among Americans remained at only about 50%, even after the extensive media attention on Račak, suggesting that war with Yugoslavia would be less popular than previous conflicts and interventions the US had undertaken in its recent history.

Regardless, the actions taken and bloodshed at Račak represented a &quot;turning point in the war&quot;, drawing sympathy from several nations worldwide, and ultimately played a role in NATO&#x27;s decision to mount an organized military operation known as &quot;Operation Noble Anvil&quot; against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. NATO&#x27;s involvement in the Kosovo conflict in the months following the Račak incident altogether lasted 78 days and consisted of a series of tactical airstrikes.
There is a memorial to the victims of the massacre in the village, where an annual ceremony to honour them is held.

==Background==
Račak is a small Albanian-inhabited village in the Štimlje municipality of southern Kosovo. By 1998 it had become the scene of activity by the Albanian separatist organization the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). It had a population of around 2,000 people prior to the displacement of most of its inhabitants during Yugoslav military activity in the summer of 1998. By January 1999, around 350 people were reported by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to be living in the village. The KLA was highly active in the region and almost certainly had a presence in Račak itself, with a base near a local power plant.

On 8 January 1999, the KLA mounted an ambush on Serbian police units near the city of Suva Reka, resulting in the deaths of three Serbian policemen. The ambush was followed by a further attack on Serbian police units near the city of Uroševac two days later on 10 January, killing one policeman. The village of Račak had served as a staging area for these ambushes and in response, Yugoslav security forces established a security cordon in the area of Račak and the neighboring communities of Dulje and Caraljevo. At 06:30 on 15 January, the assault on the village of Račak began when Serbian police and KLA units began to exchange fire. Some residents of Račak were able to escape to the nearby village of Petrovo, while KLA units fought their way out to positions outside the village. KLA resistance lasted a number of hours with Serbian police units finally securing the village in the morning, later departing the village at 16:30.

==Reports==
On 15 January, reports were received by the Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM), an unarmed observer force from the OSCE, of civilians being killed in Račak. KVM monitors attempted to gain access to the area but were refused permission by security forces despite strong protests. Instead, they watched the fighting from a nearby hill. They later gained access to the village, where they found one dead man and a number of injured people and received reports of other deaths and of people being taken away by the Serbian security forces. They were denied permission to interview the villagers or explore the area around the village.

The monitors finally gained access to the surrounding area on 16 January. Accompanied by a number of foreign journalists and members of the European Union&#x27;s Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission (KDOM), they found a total of 40 bodies in and around the village. Another five bodies had allegedly been removed by family members. In all, 45 were reported killed, including a 12-year-old boy and three women. All had been shot and the KVM team reported that it found several bodies decapitated. KVM head William Walker later described what he had seen:

:&quot;In a gully above the village, I saw the first body. It was covered with a blanket, and when it was pulled back, I saw there was no head on the corpse — just an incredibly bloody mess on the neck. Someone told me that the skull was on the other side of the gully and asked if I wanted to see that. But I said, &quot;No, I&#x27;ve pretty much got this story.&quot; [Three more bodies were found.] They looked like older men, with gray hair or white hair ... They had wounds on their heads, and there was blood on their clothes. [Then a larger group of bodies.] I didn&#x27;t count them. I just looked and saw a lot of holes in the head - in the top of the head and the back of the head. A couple had what appeared to be bullet wounds knocking out their eyes. I was told there were other bodies further up and over the crest of the hill, and I was asked by journalists and inspectors if I was going to go up and see the rest. I said, &#x27;I&#x27;ve seen enough.&#x27;&quot;

Walker immediately condemned what he labelled &quot;an unspeakable atrocity&quot; which was &quot;a crime very much against humanity&quot;. He told the party of journalists accompanying him: &quot;I do not hesitate to accuse the (Serb) government security forces. We want to know who gave the orders, and who carried them out. I will insist that justice will be done. They certainly didn&#x27;t deserve to die in circumstances like this.&quot;

The journalists also provided first-hand accounts of the discovery of the bodies. One of them, the BBC&#x27;s reporter Jacky Rowland, reported that the dead &quot;were all ordinary men; farmers, labourers, villagers. They had all been shot in the head.&quot; The dead were aged from 14 to 99 years old. ITN&#x27;s correspondent Bill Neely was also present and described how other KVM monitors reacted at the scene: &quot;A Swedish monitor notes that the dead are all in civilian clothes and unarmed and that there are no signs of a battle... After working for two hours one monitor, a London police officer, tells me he believes many of the victims have been shot at close range.&quot;

Two days later, on 18 January, the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Louise Arbour, attempted to enter Kosovo to investigate the killings but was refused access by Serbian authorities. On the same day, heavily armed Serbian police entered Račak under fire from the KLA, and removed the bodies, taking them to a morgue in Pristina to await a forensic examination.

A joint Yugoslavian-Belarusian team of pathologists conducted post-mortems at the end of January. A Finnish forensic team working for the European Union subsequently conducted a second post-mortem, which was more detailed than the first, but conducted after a greater time from the actual killings. The bodies were finally released to the families and buried on 10 February 1999.

==Investigations==
The killings at Račak became the focus of an investigation by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. In its indictment of Slobodan Milošević and four other senior Yugoslav and Serbian officials, the ICTY&#x27;s Chief Prosecutor stated that:

Eyewitness reports from the surviving villagers unanimously supported the account of a massacre. The British journalist Julius Strauss, writing for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, described how he had &quot;spent more than a week collecting evidence on the Račak massacre from Albanian witnesses, Western monitors and diplomats and a few Serbian sources who spoke privately and at some risk.&quot; According to the survivors that he interviewed, &quot;a small group of men dressed all in black and wearing gloves and balaclavas ... co-ordinated the attack on the village and the subsequent executions.&quot; Men had been separated from women and children before being led away to be executed. One survivor told him that &quot;some of the Serbs were in blue, some in black. The men in black appeared to be in control and wore balaclavas over their heads. Some had uniforms with insignia which included a Serbian flag; some had none. They carried automatic guns and, as we were led up the hill, both units started shooting us.&quot; Strauss speculated that the men had been from the Specijalna Antiteroristička Jedinica, the Serbian Interior Ministry&#x27;s elite anti-terrorist unit. Some eyewitnesses told reporters that &quot;Serb troops shot and mutilated their victims, and the six-hour orgy of violence ended with a nationalist song.&quot;

The Serbian government rejected this version of events. On the day after the killings, the Serbian Interior Ministry issued a statement asserting that its police units had come under fire from &quot;ethnic Albanian terrorist groups ... on routes leading to Račak village in the Stimlje municipality.&quot; In the subsequent counter-attack &quot;several dozen terrorists were killed in the clashes with the police. Most of them were in uniforms bearing the insignia of the ethnic Albanian terrorist organization calling itself the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).&quot;

They received some support from the French newspapers &quot;Le Figaro&quot; and &quot;Le Monde&quot;, which suggested that the KLA could have fabricated evidence. A film crew working for the Associated Press accompanied the Serbian forces in Račak for part of 15 January. Two French journalists from the Agence France Press and &quot;Le Figaro&quot; interviewed the cameramen and saw at least some of the footage, from which they concluded that it was possible that the KLA could have staged the massacre, and that &quot;only a credible international inquiry would make it possible to resolve those doubts.&quot; According to the paper,

:&quot;It was in fact an empty village that the police entered in the morning, sticking close to the walls. The shooting was intense, as they were fired on from KLA trenches dug into the hillside. The fighting intensified sharply on the hilltops above the village. Watching from below, next to the mosque, the AP journalists understood that the KLA guerrillas, encircled, were trying desperately to break out. A score of them in fact succeeded, as the police themselves admitted.&quot;

Another French journalist writing for &quot;Le Monde&quot;, Christophe Chatelot, gave an account from the perspective of the two AP journalists:

:&quot;When at 10 a.m. they entered the village in the wake of a police armored vehicle, the village was nearly deserted. They advanced through the streets under the fire of the Kosovo Liberation Army (UCK) fighters lying in ambush in the woods above the village. The exchange of fire continued throughout the operation, with more or less intensity. The main fighting took place in the woods. The Albanians who had fled the village when the first Serb shells were fired at dawn tried to escape. There they ran into Serbian police who had surrounded the village. The UCK was trapped in between. The object of the violent police attack on Friday was a stronghold of UCK Albanian independence fighters. Virtually all the inhabitants had fled Račak during the frightful Serb offensive of the summer of 1998. With few exceptions, they had not come back. &#x27;Smoke came from only two chimneys,&#x27; noted one of the two AP TV reporters.&quot;

The Serbian President, Milan Milutinović, accused the KVM head William Walker of fabricating the killings &quot;by securing the co-operation of his protegés in the Kosovo Liberation Army&quot;. The Serbian media took a similar line, arguing that the Albanians had removed the KLA uniforms from the bodies and replaced them with civilian clothes. Unnamed French diplomats also criticised Walker for publicly blaming the Serbs for the killings, arguing that he should have waited for a more thorough investigation. The Yugoslav government declared Walker to be &quot;persona non grata&quot; and demanded that he leave the territory of Yugoslavia within 48 hours.

At the end of January 1999, the United States was reported to have leaked telephone intercepts that were said to prove the role of the Serb government in the killings. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the intercepts showed that the Serb government had ordered security forces to &quot;go in hard&quot; to the Račak area. Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Šainović and Interior Ministry General Sreten Lukić reportedly expressed concern about reaction to the Račak assault and discussed how to make the killings at Račak appear to be the result of combat between government troops and KLA rebels. On the day of the attack on Račak, Sainović was aware that the assault was underway and asked how many people had been killed. Lukić replied that as of that moment the tally stood at 22. Following the international uproar about the killings, Sainović told Lukić to re-enter Račak and retrieve the bodies. He also told Lukić that the ICTY prosecutor Louise Arbour was not to be allowed into the country.

===Forensic reports===
Three forensic examinations were carried out on the bodies, by separate teams from FR Yugoslavia, Belarus (at the time an ally of Serbia) and Finland (under the auspices of the European Union). All three examinations took place in controversial circumstances; the Yugoslav and Belarusian forensic teams carried out their autopsies against the opposition of the KVM and ICTY, which had demanded that the outside experts from Finland should be the first to carry out post-mortems on the dead. The Yugoslav and Belarusian autopsies were conducted on 19 January under the auspices of the Pristina Forensic Medical Institute. Its director, Professor Saša Dobričanin, stated that &quot;Not a single body bears any sign of execution. The bodies were not massacred.&quot; He told the media that he suspected that the bodies had been mutilated posthumously to fabricate the appearance of an execution.

The Finnish (EU) team, headed by pathologist Helena Ranta, began its own autopsy on 21 January and released its initial findings on 17 March. The introduction to the report stressed that it was Ranta&#x27;s personal view, and not the position of the team. The report concluded that &quot;there was no evidence that the victims had been anything other than unarmed civilians and that they had probably been killed where they were later found by the international monitors.&quot; Addressing the claims that the dead had been killed wearing KLA uniforms which had then been replaced with civilian clothes, the report states that &quot;...the clothing [of the dead] bore no badges or insignia of any military unit. No indication of removal of badges of rank or insignia was evident. Based on autopsy findings (e.g. bullet holes, coagulated blood) and photographs of the scenes, it is highly unlikely that clothes could have been changed or removed.&quot; Ranta testified at the subsequent ICTY trial of Slobodan Milošević, stating that retrieved bullets, bullet casings and entry and exit wounds indicated that the victims were killed where their bodies were found and at approximately the same time. A later Finnish report indicated that only one victim had provably been shot at close range.

The report from the Finnish team, however, was kept confidential by the EU until long after the war, and the team leader, Helena Ranta, issued a press release at the time containing her &quot;personal opinion&quot; and indicating different findings. Ranta stated that &quot;...medicolegal investigations [such as scientific analysis of bodies] cannot give a conclusive answer to the question whether there was [in fact] a battle [between the police and insurgents]...&quot;, but she leaned towards the victims being non-combatants in part because &quot;...no ammunition was found in the pockets&quot; of the bodies she investigated. The report was widely understood as saying that the Finnish team had disproved the finding released by the Yugoslav and Belarusian pathologists, whose tests had shown a positive for gunshot residue on the hands of 37 out of the 40 bodies.

Criticism was levelled against the paraffin method used by the Yugoslavs and Belarusians to test for powder residue on the victims&#x27; hands, since it regularly gives false positives for many other substances, including fertilizers, tobacco, urine and cosmetics, and sometimes provides false negatives. The test is still used by the police of many countries who cannot afford more modern methods, but has been described since as early as 1967 as &#x27;of no use scientifically.&#x27; 

The international reaction to the Yugoslav and Belarusian report on one hand, (which supported the view that those killed were KLA fighters, not civilians as claimed by the Kosovo-Albanians and NATO) and that of the EU expert team on the other (which did not find any evidence to suggest that the dead were combatants) differed considerably, not least in the NATO-countries who were preparing to intervene to stop widespread human rights violations in Kosovo. The former was ignored or dismissed as propaganda, and the latter was accepted as evidence of a massacre against civilians. Several pro-war activists and writers wrote about, and quoted, the Finnish team&#x27;s press-release. Both reports were used as evidence by the prosecution and also by the defence of Slobodan Milošević at his trial, until the Račak case was dropped from the indictment because of lack of evidence.

The full report of the EU team was handed over to the ICTY at the end of June 2000. An executive summary was published in 2001, but the full report has never been released.

In October 2008 Helena Ranta stated that she had been asked to modify the contents of her report, both by the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and by William Walker, the head of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Kosovo Verification Mission, in order to make it more explicit, she had refused to do so, saying this was &quot;a task for the war crimes tribunal”. According to Ranta, in the winter of 1999 William Walker, the head of the OSCE Kosovo monitoring mission, broke a pencil in two and threw the pieces at her when she was not willing to use sufficiently strong language about the Serbs.

==Consequences==
Many western governments, human rights groups and international organisations insisted that the Račak operation was a deliberate massacre, conducted in defiance of earlier Serbian agreements to end the violence in Kosovo. The OSCE, Council of Europe, EU, NATO and the UN Security Council all issued strongly worded statements condemning the killings. On January 22, the Contact Group of countries with an interest in Yugoslavia (Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States) issued a joint statement condemning &quot;the massacre of Kosovo Albanians in Račak on 15 January. All members expressed their revulsion at this act of mass murder. No amount of provocation could justify it. The Contact Group condemns UCK [KLA] provocations which can only contribute to rising tensions and further violence... The Contact Group also condemns the decisions by the FRY authorities to refuse entry into Kosovo by ICTY Chief Prosecutor Judge Arbour.&quot; The Contact Group also called for Yugoslav authorities to &quot;work with the International Tribunal to ensure that those responsible for Račak are brought to justice [and] suspend those VJ and MUP officers operating in Račak on 15 January pending the results of this investigation becoming available&quot;.

According to Edward S. Herman, media collaboration assisted the Račak massacre in serving as a &quot;casus belli&quot; for the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Ranta&#x27;s news conference on 17 March 1999 during the final days of the Rambouillet Agreement talks, coupled with media outlets failing to mention the circumstances of the Serbian offensive in the area, helped to justify NATO involvement in Kosovo.

The UN Security Council and Secretary General on January 31 described the event as a massacre perpetrated by Yugoslav security forces.

===ICTY indictment===
The ICTY issued a sealed indictment on 27 May 1999 for crimes against humanity and violations of the laws and customs of war against a number of senior Yugoslav officials. These were Slobodan Milošević (President of Yugoslavia), Milan Milutinović (President of Serbia), Nikola Šainović (Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister), Dragoljub Ojdanić (Chief of the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army) and Vlajko Stojiljković (Serbian Interior Minister). The Račak massacre was added by the ICTY prosecutors in an amended indictment, but was subsequently dropped from the case, to &quot;improve the expeditiousness of the proceedings while ensuring that they remain fair&quot;.

==Aftermath==
On June 18, 2001, a court in Pristina sentenced Zoran Stojanović, a 32-year-old police officer, to 15 years&#x27; imprisonment for murder and attempted murder in Račak. Stojanović, a Kosovo Serb, was convicted by a joint UN-Kosovo Albanian panel of judges (two United Nations magistrates and one ethnic Albanian). Stojanović&#x27;s trial was highly controversial. It was speedy, one of the first trials by a hastily organized new court. Stojanović was alleged to have killed one man and wounded two more by firing one bullet. During the trial, according to one UN legal officer, both the international judges and the Albanian judge had considered dismissing the case, but did not do so, allegedly for political reasons. During the trial, some witnesses allegedly presented testimonies that contradicted the forensic evidence.

The reconstruction of events in Račak for the trial was prevented by two men, who chased off court officials, telling them, &quot;we don&#x27;t want any Serbs in our village.&quot; The second reconstruction was prevented by an angry mob of Albanians. A subsequent reconstruction was held without the presence of either the defendant or his lawyer. The prosecutor, Tome Gashe, told the court during the trial that unless Stojanović were found guilty, the people would &quot;take justice in their own hands&quot;. The trial and sentencing of Stojanović was criticised by the United Nations and Amnesty International.

Zoran Stojanović was pardoned in 2007 and released from custody. In late 2009, President of Serbia Boris Tadić pardoned Zoran Stojanović, declaring that the trial was unjust, which opened the question as to whether he had jurisdiction because Stojanović was sentenced by an international High court.

===Denial of the massacre===
Kosovo Serb politician Ivan Todosijević denied the massacre took place and said that the story was made up by &quot;Albanian terrorists&quot;. In 2019, he was convicted of incitement to ethnic, racial, or religious intolerance and was sentenced to two years in prison by a court in Pristina for making the claims. The Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić, supported Todosijevic, claiming that the massacre was indeed made up. This was met with stark reaction from Kosovo Albanian politicians and the civil society. The president of Kosovo, Hashim Thaçi, said that peace in the Balkans would only be established when Serbia expressed shame, and not pride, when discussing war crimes. There were reactions by the former prime minister of Kosovo Ramush Haradinaj, former Kosovar minister of foreign affairs Behgjet Pacolli, and the European Commission. The European Commission stated that “Denial and revisionism are contrary to the values of the European Union and are contrary to the project of integration of the Western Balkans into the European Union. Sentencing has to be proportionate and take into account all elements of the case”.

In October 2022, Todosijević&#x27;s conviction was upheld at his retrial. Kosovo&#x27;s Court of Appeals upheld the verdict in March 2023, but the Supreme Court of Kosovo overturned it in July 2023, acquitting Todosijević of inciting hate.

<doc id="174410" wikidata="Q328720" url="?curid=174410" title="Armillary sphere">
<text>A armillary sphere (variations are known as spherical [[astrolabe]], armilla, or armil) is a model of objects in the sky (on the celestial sphere), consisting of a spherical framework of s, centered on Earth or the Sun, that represent lines of celestial longitude and latitude and other astronomically important features, such as the ecliptic. As such, it differs from a celestial globe, which is a smooth sphere whose principal purpose is to map the constellations. It was invented separately, in ancient China possibly as early as the 4th century BC and ancient Greece during the 3rd century BC, with later uses in the Islamic world and Medieval Europe.

With the Earth as center, an armillary sphere is known as &quot;Ptolemaic&quot;. With the Sun as center, it is known as &quot;Copernican&quot;.

The flag of Portugal features an armillary sphere. The armillary sphere is also featured in Portuguese heraldry, associated with the Portuguese discoveries during the Age of Exploration. Manuel I of Portugal, for example, took it as one of his symbols where it appeared on his standard, and on early Chinese export ceramics made for the Portuguese court. In the flag of the Empire of Brazil, the armillary sphere is also featured.

The Beijing Capital International Airport Terminal 3 features a large armillary sphere metal sculpture as an exhibit of Chinese inventions for international and domestic visitors.
== Description and use ==


The exterior parts of this machine are a [or framework] of brass rings, which represent the principal circles of the heavens:

# The equinoctial &quot;A&quot;, which is divided into 360 degrees (beginning at its intersection with the ecliptic in Aries) for showing the sun&#x27;s right ascension in degrees; and also into 24 hours, for showing its right ascension in time.
# The ecliptic &quot;B&quot;, which is divided into 12 signs, and each sign into 30 degrees, and also into the months and days of the year, in such a manner that the degree or point of the ecliptic on which the sun appears, on any given day, stands over that day in the circle of months.
# The tropic of Cancer &quot;C&quot;, touching the ecliptic at the beginning of Cancer in &quot;e&quot;, and the tropic of Capricorn &quot;D&quot;, touching the ecliptic at the beginning of Capricorn in &quot;f&quot;; each circle 23 degrees from the equinoctial circle.
# The Arctic Circle &quot;E&quot;, and the Antarctic Circle &quot;F&quot;, each circle 23 degrees from its respective pole at &quot;N&quot; and &quot;S&quot;.
# The equinoctial colure &quot;G&quot;, passing through the north and south poles of the heavens at &quot;N&quot; and &quot;S&quot;, and through the equinoctial points in Aries and Libra, in the ecliptic.
# The solstitial colure &quot;H&quot;, passing through the poles of the heavens, and through the solstitial points in Cancer and Capricorn, in the ecliptic. Each quarter of the equinoctial colure is divided into 90 degrees, from the equinoctial to the poles of the world, for showing the declination of the sun, moon, and stars; and each quarter of the solstitial colure, from the ecliptic as &quot;e&quot; and &quot;f&quot;, to its poles &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot;, for showing the latitude of the stars.

In the north pole of the ecliptic is a nut &quot;b&quot;, to which is fixed one end of the quadrantal wire. To the other end is a small sun &quot;Y&quot;, which is carried around the ecliptic &quot;B&quot;—&quot;B&quot;, by turning the nut. In the south pole of the ecliptic is a pin &quot;d&quot;, on which another quadrantal wire is situated, with a small moon &quot;Ζ&quot; upon it, which may be moved around by hand. A mechanism causes the moon to move in an orbit which crosses the ecliptic at an angle of 5 degrees, to opposite points called the lunar nodes, and allows for shifting these points backward in the ecliptic, as the lunar nodes shift in the heavens.

Within these circular rings is a small terrestrial globe &quot;I&quot;, fixed on an axis &quot;K&quot;, which extends from the north and south poles of the globe at &quot;n&quot; and &quot;s&quot;, to those of the celestial sphere at &quot;N&quot; and &quot;S&quot;. On this axis the flat celestial meridian &quot;L&quot; is fixed, which may be set directly over the meridian of any place on the globe, so as to keep over the same meridian upon it. This flat meridian is graduated the same way as the brass meridian of the common globe, and its use is much the same.

To this globe is fitted the movable horizon &quot;M&quot;, so as to turn upon the two strong wires proceeding from its east and west points to the globe and entering the globe at the opposite points off its equator, which is a movable brass ring set into the globe in a groove all around its equator. The globe may be turned by hand within this ring, so as to place any given meridian upon it, directly under the celestial meridian &quot;L&quot;. The horizon is divided into 360 degrees all around its outermost edge, within which are the points of the compass, for showing the amplitude of the sun and the moon, both in degrees and points. The celestial meridian &quot;L&quot; passes through two notches in the north and south points of the horizon, as in a common globe: if the globe is turned around, the horizon and meridian turn with it. At the south pole of the sphere is a circle of 25 hours, fixed to the rings. On the axis is an index which goes around that circle, if the globe is turned around its axis.

The globe assembly is supported on a pedestal &quot;N&quot;, and may be elevated or depressed upon the joint &quot;O&quot;, to any number of degrees from 0 to 90 by means of the arc &quot;P&quot;, which is fixed in the strong brass arm &quot;Q&quot;. The globe assembly slides in the upright piece &quot;R&quot;, in which is a screw at &quot;r&quot;, to fix it at any proper elevation.

In the box &quot;T&quot; are two wheels (as in Dr Long&#x27;s sphere) and two pinions, whose axes come out at &quot;V&quot; and &quot;U&quot;; either of which may be turned by the small winch &quot;W&quot;. When the winch is put upon the axis &quot;V&quot;, and turn backward, the terrestrial globe, with its horizon and celestial meridian, keep at rest; and the whole sphere of circles turns round from east, by south, to west, carrying the sun &quot;Y&quot;, and moon &quot;Z&quot;, round the same way, and causing them to rise above and set below the horizon. But when the winch is put upon the axis &quot;U&quot;, and turned forward, the sphere with the sun and moon keep at rest; and the earth, with its horizon and meridian, turn round from horizon to the sun and moon, to which these bodies came when the earth kept at rest, and they were carried round it; showing that they rise and set in the same points of the horizon, and at the same times in the hour circle, whether the motion be in the earth or in the heaven. If the earthly globe be turned, the hour-index goes round its hour-circle; but if the sphere be turned, the hour-circle goes round below the index.

And so, by this construction, the machine is equally fitted to show either the real motion of the earth, or the apparent motion of the heavens.

To reset the sphere for use, one must first slacken the screw &quot;r&quot; in the upright stem &quot;R&quot;, and taking hold of the arm &quot;Q&quot;, move it up or down until the given degree of latitude for any place lies at the side of the stem &quot;R&quot;; then the axis of the sphere will be properly elevated, so as to stand parallel to the axis of the terrestrial globe, if the globe assembly is to be aligned to north and south by a small compass: once this is done, the user must count the latitude from the north pole, upon the celestial meridian &quot;L&quot;, down towards the north notch of the horizon, and set the horizon to that latitude. The user then must turn the nut &quot;b&quot; until the sun &quot;Y&quot; comes to the given day of the year in the ecliptic, and the sun will be at its proper place for that day.

To find the place of the moon&#x27;s ascending node, and also the place of the moon, an ephemeris must be consulted to set them right accordingly. Lastly, the user must turn the winch &quot;W&quot;, until either the sun comes to the meridian &quot;L&quot;, or until the meridian comes to the sun (moving the sphere or globe at the user&#x27;s discretion), and then set the hour-index to the XII, marked noon, the whole sphere will be reset. Then the user must turn the winch, and observe when the sun or moon rises and sets in the horizon. The hour-index will show the times thereof for the given day.

==History==
===China===

Throughout Chinese history, astronomers have created celestial globes () to assist the observation of the stars. The Chinese also used the armillary sphere in aiding calendrical computations and calculations.

According to Joseph Needham, the earliest development of the armillary sphere in China goes back to the astronomers Shi Shen and Gan De in the 4th century BC, as they were equipped with a primitive single-ring armillary instrument. This would have allowed them to measure the north polar distance (declination) a measurement that gave the position in a &quot;xiu&quot; (right ascension). Needham&#x27;s 4th century BC dating, however, is rejected by British sinologist Christopher Cullen, who traces the beginnings of these devices to the 1st century BC.

During the Western Han dynasty (202 BC9 AD) additional developments made by the astronomers Luoxia Hong (落下閎), Xiangyu Wangren, and Geng Shouchang (耿壽昌) advanced the use of the armillary in its early stage of evolution. In 52 BC, it was the astronomer Geng Shouchang who introduced the first permanently fixed equatorial ring of the armillary sphere. In the subsequent Eastern Han dynasty (23–220 AD) period, the astronomers Fu An and Jia Kui added the ecliptic ring by 84 AD. With the famous statesman, astronomer, and inventor Zhang Heng (張衡, 78–139 AD), the sphere was totally complete in 125 AD, with horizon and meridian rings. The world&#x27;s first water-powered celestial globe was created by Zhang Heng, who operated his armillary sphere by use of an inflow clepsydra clock.

Subsequent developments were made after the Han dynasty that improved the use of the armillary sphere. In 323 AD the Chinese astronomer Kong Ting was able to reorganize the arrangement of rings on the armillary sphere so that the ecliptic ring could be pegged on to the equator at any point desired. The Chinese astronomer and mathematician Li Chunfeng (李淳風) of the Tang dynasty created one in 633 AD with three spherical layers to calibrate multiple aspects of astronomical observations, calling them &#x27;nests&#x27; (chhung). He was also responsible for proposing a plan of having a sighting tube mounted ecliptically in order for the better observation of celestial latitudes. However, it was the Tang Chinese astronomer, mathematician, and monk Yi Xing in the next century who would accomplish this addition to the model of the armillary sphere. Ecliptical mountings of this sort were found on the armillary instruments of Zhou Cong and Shu Yijian in 1050, as well as Shen Kuo&#x27;s armillary sphere of the later 11th century, but after that point they were no longer employed on Chinese armillary instruments until the arrival of the European Jesuits.
In 723 AD, Yi Xing (一行) and government official Liang Ling-zan (梁令瓚) combined Zhang Heng&#x27;s water powered celestial globe with an escapement device. With drums hit every quarter-hour and bells rung automatically every full hour, the device was also a striking clock. The famous clock tower that the Chinese polymath Su Song built by 1094 during the Song dynasty would employ Yi Xing&#x27;s escapement with waterwheel scoops filled by clepsydra drip, and powered a crowning armillary sphere, a central celestial globe, and mechanically operated manikins that would exit mechanically opened doors of the clock tower at specific times to ring bells and gongs to announce the time, or to hold plaques announcing special times of the day. There was also the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031–1095). Being the head official for the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo was an avid scholar of astronomy, and improved the designs of several astronomical instruments: the gnomon, armillary sphere, clepsydra clock, and sighting tube fixed to observe the pole star indefinitely. When Jamal al-Din of Bukhara was asked to set up an &#x27;Islamic Astronomical Institution&#x27; in Khubilai Khan&#x27;s new capital during the Yuan dynasty, he commissioned a number of astronomical instruments, including an armillary sphere. It was noted that &quot;Chinese astronomers had been building [them] since at least 1092&quot;.

===Indian Subcontinent ===

The armillary sphere was used for observation in India since early times, and finds mention in the works of Āryabhata (476 CE). The &quot;Goladīpikā&quot;—a detailed treatise dealing with globes and the armillary sphere was composed between 1380 and 1460 CE by Parameśvara. On the subject of the usage of the armillary sphere in India, Ōhashi (2008) writes: &quot;The Indian armillary sphere (&quot;gola-yantra&quot;) was based on equatorial coordinates, unlike the Greek armillary sphere, which was based on ecliptical coordinates, although the Indian armillary sphere also had an ecliptical hoop. Probably, the celestial coordinates of the junction stars of the lunar mansions were determined by the armillary sphere since the seventh century or so.&quot;

=== Hellenistic world and ancient Rome ===
The Greek astronomer Hipparchus () credited Eratosthenes (276194 BC) as the inventor of the armillary sphere. Names of this device in Greek include &quot;astrolabos&quot; and &quot;krikōtē sphaira&quot; &quot;ringed sphere&quot;. The English name of this device comes ultimately from the Latin &quot;armilla&quot; (circle, bracelet), since it has a skeleton made of graduated metal circles linking the poles and representing the equator, the ecliptic, meridians and parallels. Usually a ball representing the Earth or, later, the Sun is placed in its center. It is used to demonstrate the motion of the stars around the Earth. Before the advent of the European telescope in the 17th century, the armillary sphere was the prime instrument of all astronomers in determining celestial positions.
In its simplest form, consisting of a ring fixed in the plane of the equator, the &quot;armilla&quot; is one of the most ancient of astronomical instruments. Slightly developed, it was crossed by another ring fixed in the plane of the meridian. The first was an equinoctial, the second a solstitial armilla. Shadows were used as indices of the sun&#x27;s positions, in combinations with angular divisions. When several rings or circles were combined representing the great circles of the heavens, the instrument became an armillary sphere.

Armillary spheres were developed by the Hellenistic Greeks and were used as teaching tools already in the 3rd century BC. In larger and more precise forms they were also used as observational instruments. However, the fully developed armillary sphere with nine circles perhaps did not exist until the mid-2nd century AD, during the Roman Empire. Eratosthenes most probably used a solstitial armilla for measuring the obliquity of the ecliptic. Hipparchus probably used an armillary sphere of four rings. The Greco-Roman geographer and astronomer Ptolemy () describes his instrument, the &quot;astrolabon&quot;, in his &quot;Almagest&quot;. It consisted of at least three rings, with a graduated circle inside of which another could slide, carrying two small tubes positioned opposite each other and supported by a vertical plumb-line.

===Medieval Middle East and Europe===


Persian and Arab astronomers such as Ibrahim al-Fazari and Abbas Ibn Firnas continued to build and improve on armillary spheres. The spherical astrolabe, a variation of both the astrolabe and the armillary sphere, was likely invented during the Middle Ages in the Middle East. About 550 AD, Christian philosopher John Philoponus wrote a treatise on the astrolabe in Greek, which is the earliest extant treatise on the instrument. The earliest description of the spherical astrolabe dates back to the Persian astronomer Nayrizi (fl. 892–902). Pope Sylvester II applied the use of sighting tubes with his armillary sphere in order to fix the position of the pole star and record measurements for the tropics and equator, and used armillary spheres as a teaching device.

===Korea===

Chinese ideas of astronomy and astronomical instruments were introduced to Korea, where further advancements were also made. Jang Yeong-sil, a Korean inventor, was ordered by King Sejong the Great of Joseon to build an armillary sphere. The sphere, built in 1433 was named Honcheonui (혼천의,渾天儀).

The Honcheonsigye, an armillary sphere activated by a working clock mechanism was built by the Korean astronomer Song Iyeong in 1669. It is the only remaining astronomical clock from the Joseon dynasty. The mechanism of the armillary sphere succeeded that of Sejong era&#x27;s armillary sphere (Honŭi 渾儀, 1435) and celestial sphere (Honsang 渾象, 1435), and the Jade Clepsydra (Ongnu 玉漏, 1438)&#x27;s sun-carriage apparatus. Such mechanisms are similar to Ch&#x27;oe Yu-ji (崔攸之, 1603~1673)&#x27;s armillary sphere(1657). The structure of time going train and the mechanism of striking-release in the part of clock is influenced by the crown escapement which has been developed from 14th century, and is applied to gear system which had been improved until the middle of 17th century in Western-style clockwork. In particular, timing device of Song I-yŏng&#x27;s Armillary Clock adopts the early 17th century pendulum clock system which could remarkably improve the accuracy of a clock.

===Renaissance===

Further advances in this instrument were made by Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546–1601), who constructed three large armillary spheres which he used for highly precise measurements of the positions of the stars and planets. They were described in his &quot;Astronomiae Instauratae Mechanica&quot;.

Armillary spheres were among the first complex mechanical devices. Their development led to many improvements in techniques and design of all mechanical devices. Renaissance scientists and public figures often had their portraits painted showing them with one hand on an armillary sphere, which represented the zenith of wisdom and knowledge.

The armillary sphere survives as useful for teaching, and may be described as a skeleton celestial globe, the series of rings representing the great circles of the heavens, and revolving on an axis within a horizon. With the earth as center such a sphere is known as Ptolemaic; with the sun as center, as Copernican.
A representation of an armillary sphere is present in the modern flag of Portugal and has been a national symbol since the reign of Manuel I.
== Paralympic Games ==
An artwork-based model of an Armillary sphere has been used since the March 1, 2014 to light the Paralympic heritage flame at Stoke Mandeville Stadium, United Kingdom. The sphere includes a wheelchair that the user can rotate to spark the flame as part of a ceremony to celebrate the past, present and future of the Paralympic Movement in the UK. The Armillary Sphere was created by artist Jon Bausor and will be used for future Heritage Flame events. The flame in the first-ever ceremony was lit by London 2012 gold medallist Hannah Cockroft.

== Heraldry and vexillology ==

The armillary sphere is commonly used in heraldry and vexillology, being mainly known as a symbol associated with Portugal, the Portuguese Empire and the Portuguese discoveries.

In the end of the 15th century, the armillary sphere became the personal heraldic badge of the future King Manuel I of Portugal, when he was still a Prince. The intense use of this badge in documents, monuments, flags and other supports, during the reign of Manuel I, transformed the armillary sphere from a simple personal symbol to a national one that represented the Kingdom of Portugal and in particular its Overseas Empire. As a national symbol, the armillary sphere continued in use after the death of Manuel I.

In the 17th century, it became associated with the Portuguese dominion of Brazil. In 1815, when Brazil gained the status of kingdom united with that of Portugal, its coat of arms was formalized as a golden armillary sphere in a blue field. Representing Brazil, the armillary sphere became also present in the arms and the flag of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. When Brazil became independent as an empire in 1822, the armillary sphere continued to be present in its national arms and in its national flag. The celestial sphere of the present Flag of Brazil replaced the armillary sphere in 1889.

The armillary sphere was reintroduced in the national arms and in the national Flag of Portugal in 1911.

<doc id="174412" wikidata="Q108779" url="?curid=174412" title="Birefringence">
<text>Birefringence means double refraction. It is the optical property of a material having a refractive index that depends on the polarization and propagation direction of light. These optically anisotropic materials are described as birefringent or birefractive. The birefringence is often quantified as the maximum difference between refractive indices exhibited by the material. Crystals with non-cubic crystal structures are often birefringent, as are plastics under mechanical stress. 

Birefringence is responsible for the phenomenon of double refraction whereby a ray of light, when incident upon a birefringent material, is split by polarization into two rays taking slightly different paths. This effect was first described by Danish scientist Rasmus Bartholin in 1669, who observed it in Iceland spar (calcite) crystals which have one of the strongest birefringences. In the 19th century Augustin-Jean Fresnel described the phenomenon in terms of polarization, understanding light as a wave with field components in transverse polarization (perpendicular to the direction of the wave vector).

==Explanation==
A mathematical description of wave propagation in a birefringent medium is presented below. Following is a qualitative explanation of the phenomenon.

===Uniaxial materials===
The simplest type of birefringence is described as &quot;uniaxial&quot;, meaning that there is a single direction governing the optical anisotropy whereby all directions perpendicular to it (or at a given angle to it) are optically equivalent. Thus rotating the material around this axis does not change its optical behaviour. This special direction is known as the optic axis of the material. Light propagating parallel to the optic axis (whose polarization is always &quot;perpendicular&quot; to the optic axis) is governed by a refractive index (for &quot;ordinary&quot;) regardless of its specific polarization. For rays with any other propagation direction, there is one linear polarization that is perpendicular to the optic axis, and a ray with that polarization is called an &quot;ordinary ray&quot; and is governed by the same refractive index value . For a ray propagating in the same direction but with a polarization perpendicular to that of the ordinary ray, the polarization direction will be partly in the direction of (parallel to) the optic axis, and this &quot;extraordinary ray&quot; will be governed by a different, &quot;direction-dependent&quot; refractive index. Because the index of refraction depends on the polarization when unpolarized light enters a uniaxial birefringent material, it is split into two beams travelling in different directions, one having the polarization of the ordinary ray and the other the polarization of the extraordinary ray.
The ordinary ray will always experience a refractive index of , whereas the refractive index of the extraordinary ray will be in between and , depending on the ray direction as described by the index ellipsoid. The magnitude of the difference is quantified by the birefringence

:formula_1

The propagation (as well as reflection coefficient) of the ordinary ray is simply described by as if there were no birefringence involved. The extraordinary ray, as its name suggests, propagates unlike any wave in an isotropic optical material. Its refraction (and reflection) at a surface can be understood using the effective refractive index (a value in between and ). Its power flow (given by the Poynting vector) is not exactly in the direction of the wave vector. This causes an additional shift in that beam, even when launched at normal incidence, as is popularly observed using a crystal of calcite as photographed above. Rotating the calcite crystal will cause one of the two images, that of the extraordinary ray, to rotate slightly around that of the ordinary ray, which remains fixed.

When the light propagates either along or orthogonal to the optic axis, such a lateral shift does not occur. In the first case, both polarizations are perpendicular to the optic axis and see the same effective refractive index, so there is no extraordinary ray. In the second case the extraordinary ray propagates at a different phase velocity (corresponding to ) but still has the power flow in the direction of the wave vector. A crystal with its optic axis in this orientation, parallel to the optical surface, may be used to create a waveplate, in which there is no distortion of the image but an intentional modification of the state of polarization of the incident wave. For instance, a quarter-wave plate is commonly used to create circular polarization from a linearly polarized source.

===Biaxial materials===
The case of so-called biaxial crystals is substantially more complex. These are characterized by &quot;three&quot; refractive indices corresponding to three principal axes of the crystal. For most ray directions, &quot;both&quot; polarizations would be classified as extraordinary rays but with different effective refractive indices. Being extraordinary waves, the direction of power flow is not identical to the direction of the wave vector in either case.

The two refractive indices can be determined using the index ellipsoids for given directions of the polarization. Note that for biaxial crystals the index ellipsoid will &quot;not&quot; be an ellipsoid of revolution (&quot;spheroid&quot;) but is described by three unequal principle refractive indices , and . Thus there is no axis around which a rotation leaves the optical properties invariant (as there is with uniaxial crystals whose index ellipsoid &quot;is&quot; a spheroid).

Although there is no axis of symmetry, there are &quot;two&quot; optical axes or &quot;binormals&quot; which are defined as directions along which light may propagate without birefringence, i.e., directions along which the wavelength is independent of polarization. For this reason, birefringent materials with three distinct refractive indices are called &quot;biaxial&quot;. Additionally, there are two distinct axes known as &quot;optical ray axes&quot; or &quot;biradials&quot; along which the group velocity of the light is independent of polarization.

===Double refraction===
When an arbitrary beam of light strikes the surface of a birefringent material at non-normal incidence, the polarization component normal to the optic axis (ordinary ray) and the other linear polarization (extraordinary ray) will be refracted toward somewhat different paths. Natural light, so-called unpolarized light, consists of equal amounts of energy in any two orthogonal polarizations. Even linearly polarized light has some energy in both polarizations, unless aligned along one of the two axes of birefringence. According to Snell&#x27;s law of refraction, the two angles of refraction are governed by the effective refractive index of each of these two polarizations. This is clearly seen, for instance, in the Wollaston prism which separates incoming light into two linear polarizations using prisms composed of a birefringent material such as calcite.

The different angles of refraction for the two polarization components are shown in the figure at the top of this page, with the optic axis along the surface (and perpendicular to the plane of incidence), so that the angle of refraction is different for the polarization (the &quot;ordinary ray&quot; in this case, having its electric vector perpendicular to the optic axis) and the polarization (the &quot;extraordinary ray&quot; in this case, whose electric field polarization includes a component in the direction of the optic axis). In addition, a distinct form of double refraction occurs, even with normal incidence, in cases where the optic axis is not along the refracting surface (nor exactly normal to it); in this case, the dielectric polarization of the birefringent material is not exactly in the direction of the wave&#x27;s electric field for the extraordinary ray. The direction of power flow (given by the Poynting vector) for this inhomogenous wave is at a finite angle from the direction of the wave vector resulting in an additional separation between these beams. So even in the case of normal incidence, where one would compute the angle of refraction as zero (according to Snell&#x27;s law, regardless of the effective index of refraction), the energy of the extraordinary ray is propagated at an angle. If exiting the crystal through a face parallel to the incoming face, the direction of both rays will be restored, but leaving a &quot;shift&quot; between the two beams. This is commonly observed using a piece of calcite cut along its natural cleavage, placed above a paper with writing, as in the above photographs. On the contrary, waveplates specifically have their optic axis &quot;along&quot; the surface of the plate, so that with (approximately) normal incidence there will be no shift in the image from light of either polarization, simply a relative phase shift between the two light waves.

==Terminology==

Much of the work involving polarization preceded the understanding of light as a transverse electromagnetic wave, and this has affected some terminology in use. Isotropic materials have symmetry in all directions and the refractive index is the same for any polarization direction. An anisotropic material is called &quot;birefringent&quot; because it will generally refract a single incoming ray in two directions, which we now understand correspond to the two different polarizations. This is true of either a uniaxial or biaxial material.

In a uniaxial material, one ray behaves according to the normal law of refraction (corresponding to the ordinary refractive index), so an incoming ray at normal incidence remains normal to the refracting surface. As explained above, the other polarization can deviate from normal incidence, which cannot be described using the law of refraction. This thus became known as the &quot;extraordinary ray&quot;. The terms &quot;ordinary&quot; and &quot;extraordinary&quot; are still applied to the polarization components perpendicular to and not perpendicular to the optic axis respectively, even in cases where no double refraction is involved.

A material is termed &quot;uniaxial&quot; when it has a single direction of symmetry in its optical behavior, which we term the optic axis. It also happens to be the axis of symmetry of the index ellipsoid (a spheroid in this case). The index ellipsoid could still be described according to the refractive indices, , and , along three coordinate axes; in this case two are equal. So if corresponding to the and axes, then the extraordinary index is corresponding to the axis, which is also called the &quot;optic axis&quot; in this case.

Materials in which all three refractive indices are different are termed &quot;biaxial&quot; and the origin of this term is more complicated and frequently misunderstood. In a uniaxial crystal, different polarization components of a beam will travel at different phase velocities, &quot;except&quot; for rays in the direction of what we call the optic axis. Thus the optic axis has the particular property that rays in that direction do &quot;not&quot; exhibit birefringence, with all polarizations in such a beam experiencing the same index of refraction. It is very different when the three principal refractive indices are all different; then an incoming ray in any of those principal directions will still encounter two different refractive indices. But it turns out that there are two special directions (at an angle to all of the 3 axes) where the refractive indices for different polarizations are again equal. For this reason, these crystals were designated as &quot;biaxial&quot;, with the two &quot;axes&quot; in this case referring to ray directions in which propagation does not experience birefringence.

=== Fast and slow rays ===
In a birefringent material, a wave consists of two polarization components which generally are governed by different effective refractive indices. The so-called &quot;slow ray&quot; is the component for which the material has the higher effective refractive index (slower phase velocity), while the &quot;fast ray&quot; is the one with a lower effective refractive index. When a beam is incident on such a material from air (or any material with a lower refractive index), the slow ray is thus refracted more towards the normal than the fast ray. In the example figure at top of this page, it can be seen that refracted ray with &quot;s&quot; polarization (with its electric vibration along the direction of the optic axis, thus called the extraordinary ray) is the slow ray in given scenario.

Using a thin slab of that material at normal incidence, one would implement a waveplate. In this case, there is essentially no spatial separation between the polarizations, the phase of the wave in the parallel polarization (the slow ray) will be retarded with respect to the perpendicular polarization. These directions are thus known as the slow axis and fast axis of the waveplate.

===Positive or negative===
Uniaxial birefringence is classified as positive when the extraordinary index of refraction is greater than the ordinary index . Negative birefringence means that is less than zero. In other words, the polarization of the fast (or slow) wave is perpendicular to the optic axis when the birefringence of the crystal is positive (or negative, respectively). In the case of biaxial crystals, all three of the principal axes have different refractive indices, so this designation does not apply. But for any defined ray direction one can just as well designate the fast and slow ray polarizations.

== Sources of optical birefringence ==

While the best known source of birefringence is the entrance of light into an anisotropic crystal, it can result in otherwise optically isotropic materials in a few ways:
* &quot;Stress birefringence&quot; results when a normally isotropic solid is stressed and deformed (i.e., stretched or bent) causing a loss of physical isotropy and consequently a loss of isotropy in the material&#x27;s permittivity tensor;
* Form birefringence, whereby structure elements such as rods, having one refractive index, are suspended in a medium with a different refractive index. When the lattice spacing is much smaller than a wavelength, such a structure is described as a metamaterial;
* By the Pockels or Kerr effect, whereby an applied electric field induces birefringence due to nonlinear optics;
* By the self or forced alignment into thin films of amphiphilic molecules such as lipids, some surfactants or liquid crystals;
* &quot;Circular birefringence&quot; takes place generally not in materials which are anisotropic but rather ones which are chiral. This can include liquids where there is an enantiomeric excess of a chiral molecule, that is, one that has stereo isomers;
* By the Faraday effect, where a longitudinal magnetic field causes some materials to become &quot;circularly birefringent&quot; (having slightly different indices of refraction for left- and right-handed circular polarizations), similar to optical activity while the field is applied.

== Common birefringent materials ==
The best characterized birefringent materials are crystals. Due to their specific crystal structures their refractive indices are well defined. Depending on the symmetry of a crystal structure (as determined by one of the 32 possible crystallographic point groups), crystals in that group may be forced to be isotropic (not birefringent), to have uniaxial symmetry, or neither in which case it is a biaxial crystal. The crystal structures permitting uniaxial and biaxial birefringence are noted in the two tables, below, listing the two or three principal refractive indices (at wavelength 590 nm) of some better-known crystals.

In addition to induced birefringence while under stress, many plastics obtain permanent birefringence during manufacture due to stresses which are &quot;frozen in&quot; due to mechanical forces present when the plastic is molded or extruded. For example, ordinary cellophane is birefringent. Polarizers are routinely used to detect stress, either applied or frozen-in, in plastics such as polystyrene and polycarbonate.

Cotton fiber is birefringent because of high levels of cellulosic material in the fibre&#x27;s secondary cell wall which is directionally aligned with the cotton fibers.

Polarized light microscopy is commonly used in biological tissue, as many biological materials are linearly or circularly birefringent. Collagen, found in cartilage, tendon, bone, corneas, and several other areas in the body, is birefringent and commonly studied with polarized light microscopy. Some proteins are also birefringent, exhibiting form birefringence.

Inevitable manufacturing imperfections in optical fiber leads to birefringence, which is one cause of pulse broadening in fiber-optic communications. Such imperfections can be geometrical (lack of circular symmetry), or due to unequal lateral stress applied to the optical fibre. Birefringence is &quot;intentionally&quot; introduced (for instance, by making the cross-section elliptical) in order to produce polarization-maintaining optical fibers. Birefringence can be induced (or corrected) in optical fibers through bending them which causes anisotropy in form and stress given the axis around which it is bent and radius of curvature.

In addition to anisotropy in the electric polarizability that we have been discussing, anisotropy in the magnetic permeability could be a source of birefringence. At optical frequencies, there is no measurable magnetic polarizability () of natural materials, so this is not an actual source of birefringence.



== Measurement ==
Birefringence and other polarization-based optical effects (such as optical rotation and linear or circular dichroism) can be observed by measuring any change in the polarization of light passing through the material. These measurements are known as polarimetry. Polarized light microscopes, which contain two polarizers that are at 90° to each other on either side of the sample, are used to visualize birefringence, since light that has &quot;not&quot; been affected by birefringence remains in a polarization that is totally rejected by the second polarizer (&quot;analyzer&quot;). The addition of quarter-wave plates permits examination using circularly polarized light. Determination of the change in polarization state using such an apparatus is the basis of ellipsometry, by which the optical properties of specular surfaces can be gauged through reflection.

Birefringence measurements have been made with phase-modulated systems for examining the transient flow behaviour of fluids. Birefringence of lipid bilayers can be measured using dual-polarization interferometry. This provides a measure of the degree of order within these fluid layers and how this order is disrupted when the layer interacts with other biomolecules.
For the 3D measurement of birefringence, a technique based on holographic tomography can be used.

== Applications ==

===Optical devices===
Birefringence is used in many optical devices. Liquid-crystal displays, the most common sort of flat-panel display, cause their pixels to become lighter or darker through rotation of the polarization (circular birefringence) of linearly polarized light as viewed through a sheet polarizer at the screen&#x27;s surface. Similarly, light modulators modulate the intensity of light through electrically induced birefringence of polarized light followed by a polarizer. The Lyot filter is a specialized narrowband spectral filter employing the wavelength dependence of birefringence. Waveplates are thin birefringent sheets widely used in certain optical equipment for modifying the polarization state of light passing through it.

To manufacture polarizers with high transmittance, birefringent crystals are used in devices such as the Glan–Thompson prism, Glan–Taylor prism and other variants. Layered birefringent polymer sheets can also be used for this purpose.

Birefringence also plays an important role in second-harmonic generation and other nonlinear optical processes. The crystals used for these purposes are almost always birefringent. By adjusting the angle of incidence, the effective refractive index of the extraordinary ray can be tuned in order to achieve phase matching, which is required for the efficient operation of these devices.

===Medicine===
Birefringence is utilized in medical diagnostics. One powerful accessory used with optical microscopes is a pair of crossed polarizing filters. Light from the source is polarized in the direction after passing through the first polarizer, but above the specimen is a polarizer (a so-called &quot;analyzer&quot;) oriented in the direction. Therefore, no light from the source will be accepted by the analyzer, and the field will appear dark. Areas of the sample possessing birefringence will generally couple some of the -polarized light into the polarization; these areas will then appear bright against the dark background. Modifications to this basic principle can differentiate between positive and negative birefringence.

For instance, needle aspiration of fluid from a gouty joint will reveal negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals. Calcium pyrophosphate crystals, in contrast, show weak positive birefringence. Urate crystals appear yellow, and calcium pyrophosphate crystals appear blue when their long axes are aligned parallel to that of a red compensator filter, or a crystal of known birefringence is added to the sample for comparison.

The birefringence of tissue inside a living human thigh was measured using polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography at 1310 nm and a single mode fiber in a needle. Skeletal muscle birefringence was Δn = 1.79 × 10−3 ± 0.18×10−3, adipose Δn = 0.07 × 10−3 ± 0.50 × 10−3, superficial aponeurosis Δn = 5.08 × 10−3 ± 0.73 × 10−3 and interstitial tissue Δn = 0.65 × 10−3 ±0.39 × 10−3. These measurements may be important for the development of a less invasive method to diagnose Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

Birefringence can be observed in amyloid plaques such as are found in the brains of Alzheimer&#x27;s patients when stained with a dye such as Congo Red. Modified proteins such as immunoglobulin light chains abnormally accumulate between cells, forming fibrils. Multiple folds of these fibers line up and take on a beta-pleated sheet conformation. Congo red dye intercalates between the folds and, when observed under polarized light, causes birefringence.

In ophthalmology, binocular retinal birefringence screening of the &quot;Henle fibers&quot; (photoreceptor axons that go radially outward from the fovea) provides a reliable detection of strabismus and possibly also of anisometropic amblyopia. In healthy subjects, the maximum retardation induced by the Henle fiber layer is approximately 22 degrees at 840 nm. Furthermore, scanning laser polarimetry uses the birefringence of the optic nerve fiber layer to indirectly quantify its thickness, which is of use in the assessment and monitoring of glaucoma. Polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography measurements obtained from healthy human subjects have demonstrated a change in birefringence of the retinal nerve fiber layer as a function of location around the optic nerve head. The same technology was recently applied in the living human retina to quantify the polarization properties of vessel walls near the optic nerve. While retinal vessel walls become thicker and less birefringent in patients who suffer from hypertension, hinting at a decrease in vessel wall condition, the vessel walls of diabetic patients do not experience a change in thickness, but do see an increase in birefringence, presumably due to fibrosis or inflammation.

Birefringence characteristics in sperm heads allow the selection of spermatozoa for intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Likewise, &quot;zona imaging&quot; uses birefringence on oocytes to select the ones with highest chances of successful pregnancy. Birefringence of particles biopsied from pulmonary nodules indicates silicosis.

Dermatologists use dermatoscopes to view skin lesions. Dermoscopes use polarized light, allowing the user to view crystalline structures corresponding to dermal collagen in the skin. These structures may appear as shiny white lines or rosette shapes and are only visible under polarized dermoscopy.

===Stress-induced birefringence===

Isotropic solids do not exhibit birefringence. When they are under mechanical stress, birefringence results. The stress can be applied externally or is &quot;frozen in&quot; after a birefringent plastic ware is cooled after it is manufactured using injection molding. When such a sample is placed between two crossed polarizers, colour patterns can be observed, because polarization of a light ray is rotated after passing through a birefringent material and the amount of rotation is dependent on wavelength. The experimental method called photoelasticity used for analyzing stress distribution in solids is based on the same principle. There has been recent research on using stress-induced birefringence in a glass plate to generate an optical vortex and full Poincare beams (optical beams that have every possible polarization state across a cross-section).

===Other cases of birefringence===
Birefringence is observed in anisotropic elastic materials. In these materials, the two polarizations split according to their effective refractive indices, which are also sensitive to stress.

The study of birefringence in shear waves traveling through the solid Earth (the Earth&#x27;s liquid core does not support shear waves) is widely used in seismology. 

Birefringence is widely used in mineralogy to identify rocks, minerals, and gemstones.
==Theory==

In an isotropic medium (including free space) the so-called electric displacement () is just proportional to the electric field () according to where the material&#x27;s permittivity is just a scalar (and equal to where is the index of refraction). In an anisotropic material exhibiting birefringence, the relationship between and must now be described using a tensor equation:

where is now a 3 × 3 permittivity tensor. We assume linearity and no magnetic permeability in the medium: . The electric field of a plane wave of angular frequency can be written in the general form:

where is the position vector, is time, and is a vector describing the electric field at , . Then we shall find the possible wave vectors . By combining Maxwell&#x27;s equations for and , we can eliminate to obtain:

With no free charges, Maxwell&#x27;s equation for the divergence of vanishes:
We can apply the vector identity to the left hand side of , and use the spatial dependence in which each differentiation in (for instance) results in multiplication by to find:
The right hand side of can be expressed in terms of through application of the permittivity tensor and noting that differentiation in time results in multiplication by , then becomes:
Applying the differentiation rule to we find:
 indicates that is orthogonal to the direction of the wavevector , even though that is no longer generally true for as would be the case in an isotropic medium. will not be needed for the further steps in the following derivation.

Finding the allowed values of for a given is easiest done by using Cartesian coordinates with the , and axes chosen in the directions of the symmetry axes of the crystal (or simply choosing in the direction of the optic axis of a uniaxial crystal), resulting in a diagonal matrix for the permittivity tensor :
where the diagonal values are squares of the refractive indices for polarizations along the three principal axes , and . With in this form, and substituting in the speed of light using , the component of the vector equation becomes
where , , are the components of (at any given position in space and time) and , , are the components of . Rearranging, we can write (and similarly for the and components of )


This is a set of linear equations in , , , so it can have a nontrivial solution (that is, one other than ) as long as the following determinant is zero:
Evaluating the determinant of , and rearranging the terms according to the powers of formula_2, the constant terms cancel. After eliminating the common factor formula_2 from the remaining terms, we obtain
 
In the case of a uniaxial material, choosing the optic axis to be in the direction so that and , this expression can be factored into

Setting either of the factors in to zero will define an ellipsoidal surface in the space of wavevectors that are allowed for a given . The first factor being zero defines a sphere; this is the solution for so-called ordinary rays, in which the effective refractive index is exactly regardless of the direction of . The second defines a spheroid symmetric about the axis. This solution corresponds to the so-called extraordinary rays in which the effective refractive index is in between and , depending on the direction of . Therefore, for any arbitrary direction of propagation (other than in the direction of the optic axis), two distinct wavevectors are allowed corresponding to the polarizations of the ordinary and extraordinary rays.

For a biaxial material a similar but more complicated condition on the two waves can be described; the locus of allowed vectors (the &quot;wavevector surface&quot;) is a 4th-degree two-sheeted surface, so that in a given direction there are generally two permitted vectors (and their opposites). By inspection one can see that is generally satisfied for two positive values of . Or, for a specified optical frequency and direction normal to the wavefronts , it is satisfied for two wavenumbers (or propagation constants) (and thus effective refractive indices) corresponding to the propagation of two linear polarizations in that direction.

When those two propagation constants are equal then the effective refractive index is independent of polarization, and there is consequently no birefringence encountered by a wave traveling in that particular direction. For a uniaxial crystal, this is the optic axis, the ±&quot;z&quot; direction according to the above construction. But when all three refractive indices (or permittivities), , and are distinct, it can be shown that there are exactly two such directions, where the two sheets of the wave-vector surface touch; these directions are not at all obvious and do not lie along any of the three principal axes (, , according to the above convention). Historically that accounts for the use of the term &quot;biaxial&quot; for such crystals, as the existence of exactly two such special directions (considered &quot;axes&quot;) was discovered well before polarization and birefringence were understood physically. These two special directions are generally not of particular interest; biaxial crystals are rather specified by their three refractive indices corresponding to the three axes of symmetry.

A general state of polarization launched into the medium can always be decomposed into two waves, one in each of those two polarizations, which will then propagate with different wavenumbers . Applying the different phase of propagation to those two waves over a specified propagation distance will result in a generally &quot;different&quot; net polarization state at that point; this is the principle of the waveplate for instance. With a waveplate, there is no spatial displacement between the two rays as their vectors are still in the same direction. That is true when each of the two polarizations is either normal to the optic axis (the ordinary ray) or parallel to it (the extraordinary ray).

In the more general case, there &quot;is&quot; a difference not only in the magnitude but the direction of the two rays. For instance, the photograph through a calcite crystal (top of page) shows a shifted image in the two polarizations; this is due to the optic axis being neither parallel nor normal to the crystal surface. And even when the optic axis &quot;is&quot; parallel to the surface, this will occur for waves launched at non-normal incidence (as depicted in the explanatory figure). In these cases the two vectors can be found by solving constrained by the boundary condition which requires that the components of the two transmitted waves&#x27; vectors, and the vector of the incident wave, as projected onto the surface of the interface, must all be identical. For a uniaxial crystal it will be found that there is &quot;not&quot; a spatial shift for the ordinary ray (hence its name) which will refract as if the material were non-birefringent with an index the same as the two axes which are not the optic axis. For a biaxial crystal neither ray is deemed &quot;ordinary&quot; nor would generally be refracted according to a refractive index equal to one of the principal axes.

<text>Steve Lewis (March 19, 1896 - c. 1941) was an American jazz pianist and composer.

Lewis was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1910, he began his career as a member of the Silver Leaf Orchestra. He joined the Olympia Orchestra and toured with Bill and Mary Mack in 1917. When he returned to New Orleans, he spent the next ten years in bands with Armand J. Piron. During the 1920s, he taught piano to such students as Luis Russell. He worked as a bandleader and a freelance musician. His last days were spent in a mental institution in Louisiana.

Lewis was an eccentric character. He drove a Ford Model T which he had custom painted in bright multicolored polka-dots. He played the piano without using either of his middle fingers; these he kept extended straight while playing (in the manner of the rude gesture known as &quot;Shooting the Bird&quot;).

Lewis was influenced by the piano stylings of Tony Jackson and Jelly Roll Morton, and became the premier pianist in Storyville after those two older musicians left town.

<text>Roland Gérard Barthes (; ; 12 November 1915 – 26 March 1980) was a French literary theorist, essayist, philosopher, critic, and semiotician. His work engaged in the analysis of a variety of sign systems, mainly derived from Western popular culture. His ideas explored a diverse range of fields and influenced the development of many schools of theory, including structuralism, anthropology, literary theory, and post-structuralism.

Barthes is perhaps best known for his 1957 essay collection &quot;Mythologies&quot;, which contained reflections on popular culture, and the 1967/1968 essay &quot;The Death of the Author&quot;, which critiqued traditional approaches in literary criticism. During his academic career he was primarily associated with the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS) and the Collège de France.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Roland Barthes was born on 12 November 1915 in the town of Cherbourg in Normandy. His father, naval officer Louis Barthes, was killed in a battle during World War I in the North Sea before Barthes&#x27;s first birthday. His mother, Henriette Barthes, and his aunt and grandmother raised him in the village of Urt and the city of Bayonne. In 1924, Barthes&#x27; family moved to Paris, though his attachment to his provincial roots would remain strong throughout his life.

=== Student years ===
Barthes showed great promise as a student and spent the period from 1935 to 1939 at the Sorbonne, where he earned a &quot;licence&quot; in classical literature. He was plagued by ill health throughout this period, suffering from tuberculosis, which often had to be treated in the isolation of sanatoria. His repeated physical breakdowns disrupted his academic career, affecting his studies and his ability to take qualifying examinations. They also exempted him from military service during World War II.

His life from 1939 to 1948 was largely spent obtaining a &quot;licence&quot; in grammar and philology, publishing his first papers, taking part in a medical study, and continuing to struggle with his health. He received a &quot;diplôme d&#x27;études supérieures&quot; (roughly equivalent to an MA by thesis) from the University of Paris in 1941 for his work in Greek tragedy.

=== Early academic career ===
In 1948, he returned to purely academic work, gaining numerous short-term positions at institutes in France, Romania, and Egypt. During this time, he contributed to the leftist Parisian paper &quot;Combat&quot;, out of which grew his first full-length work, &quot;Writing Degree Zero&quot; (1953).

In 1952, Barthes settled at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, where he studied lexicology and sociology. During his seven-year period there, he began to write a popular series of bi-monthly essays for the magazine &quot;Les Lettres Nouvelles&quot;, in which he dismantled myths of popular culture (gathered in the &quot;Mythologies&quot; collection that was published in 1957). Consisting of fifty-four short essays, mostly written between 1954 and 1956, &quot;Mythologies&quot; were acute reflections of French popular culture ranging from an analysis on soap detergents to a dissection of popular wrestling. Knowing little English, Barthes taught at Middlebury College in 1957 and befriended the future English translator of much of his work, Richard Howard, that summer in New York City.

=== Rise to prominence ===
Barthes spent the early 1960s exploring the fields of semiology and structuralism, chairing various faculty positions around France, and continuing to produce more full-length studies. Many of his works challenged traditional academic views of literary criticism and of renowned figures of literature. His unorthodox thinking led to a conflict with a well-known Sorbonne professor of literature, Raymond Picard, who attacked the French New Criticism (a label that he inaccurately applied to Barthes) for its obscurity and lack of respect towards France&#x27;s literary roots. Barthes&#x27;s rebuttal in &quot;Criticism and Truth&quot; (1966) accused the old, bourgeois criticism of a lack of concern with the finer points of language and of selective ignorance towards challenging theories, such as Marxism.

By the late 1960s, Barthes had established a reputation for himself. He traveled to the US and Japan, delivering a presentation at Johns Hopkins University. During this time, he wrote his best-known work, the 1967 essay &quot;The Death of the Author,&quot; which, in light of the growing influence of Jacques Derrida&#x27;s deconstruction, would prove to be a transitional piece in its investigation of the logical ends of structuralist thought.

=== Mature critical work ===
Barthes continued to contribute with Philippe Sollers to the avant-garde literary magazine &quot;Tel Quel&quot;, which was developing similar kinds of theoretical inquiry to that pursued in Barthes&#x27;s writings. In 1970, Barthes produced what many consider to be his most prodigious work, the dense, critical reading of Balzac&#x27;s &quot;Sarrasine&quot; entitled &quot;S/Z&quot;. Throughout the 1970s, Barthes continued to develop his literary criticism; he developed new ideals of textuality and novelistic neutrality. In 1971, he served as visiting professor at the University of Geneva. In those same years he became primarily associated with the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS).

In 1975 he wrote an autobiography titled &quot;Roland Barthes&quot; and in 1977 he was elected to the chair of Sémiologie Littéraire at the Collège de France. In the same year, his mother, Henriette Barthes, to whom he had been devoted, died, aged 85. They had lived together for 60 years. The loss of the woman who had raised and cared for him was a serious blow to Barthes. His last major work, &quot;Camera Lucida&quot;, is partly an essay about the nature of photography and partly a meditation on photographs of his mother. The book contains many reproductions of photographs, though none of them are of Henriette.

=== Death ===
On 25 February 1980, Roland Barthes was knocked down by the driver of a laundry van while walking home through the streets of Paris. One month later, on 26 March, he died from the chest injuries he had sustained in the crash.

==Writings and ideas==

===Early thought===
Barthes&#x27;s earliest ideas reacted to the trend of existentialist philosophy that was prominent in France during the 1940s, specifically to the figurehead of existentialism, Jean-Paul Sartre. Sartre&#x27;s &quot;What Is Literature?&quot; (1947) expresses a disenchantment both with established forms of writing and more experimental, avant-garde forms, which he feels alienate readers. Barthes&#x27;s response was to try to discover that which may be considered unique and original in writing. In &quot;Writing Degree Zero&quot; (1953), Barthes argues that conventions inform both language and style, rendering neither purely creative. Instead, form, or what Barthes calls &quot;writing&quot; (the specific way an individual chooses to manipulate conventions of style for a desired effect), is the unique and creative act. However, a writer&#x27;s form is vulnerable to becoming a convention once it has been made available to the public. This means that creativity is an ongoing process of continual change and reaction.

In &quot;Michelet&quot;, a critical analysis of the French historian Jules Michelet, Barthes developed these notions, applying them to a broader range of fields. He argued that Michelet&#x27;s views of history and society are obviously flawed. In studying his writings, he continued, one should not seek to learn from Michelet&#x27;s claims; rather, one should maintain a critical distance and learn from his errors, since understanding how and why his thinking is flawed will show more about his period of history than his own observations. Similarly, Barthes felt that avant-garde writing should be praised for its maintenance of just such a distance between its audience and itself. In presenting an obvious artificiality rather than making claims to great subjective truths, Barthes argued, avant-garde writers ensure that their audiences maintain an objective perspective. In this sense, Barthes believed that art should be critical and should interrogate the world, rather than seek to explain it, as Michelet had done.

===Semiotics and myth===
Barthes&#x27;s many monthly contributions, collected in his &quot;Mythologies&quot; (1957), frequently interrogated specific cultural materials in order to expose how bourgeois society asserted its values through them. For example, Barthes cited the portrayal of wine in French society. Its description as a robust and healthy habit is a bourgeois ideal that is contradicted by certain realities (i.e., that wine can be unhealthy and inebriating). He found semiotics, the study of signs, useful in these interrogations. He developed a theory of signs to demonstrate this perceived deception. He suggested that the construction of myths results in two levels of signification: the &quot;language-object&quot;, a first order linguistic system; and the &quot;metalanguage&quot;, the second-order system transmitting the myth. The former pertains to the literal or explicit meaning of things while the latter is composed of the language used to speak about the first order. Barthes explained that these bourgeois cultural myths were &quot;second-order signs,&quot; or &quot;connotations.&quot; A picture of a full, dark bottle is a signifier that relates to a specific &quot;signified&quot;: a fermented, alcoholic beverage. However, the bourgeoisie relate it to a new signified: the idea of healthy, robust, relaxing experience. Motivations for such manipulations vary, from a desire to sell products to a simple desire to maintain the status quo. These insights brought Barthes in line with similar Marxist theory. Barthes used the term &quot;myth&quot; while analyzing the popular, consumer culture of post-war France in order to reveal that &quot;objects were organized into meaningful relationships via narratives that expressed collective cultural values.&quot;

In &quot;The Fashion System&quot; Barthes showed how this adulteration of signs could easily be translated into words. In this work he explained how in the fashion world any word could be loaded with idealistic bourgeois emphasis. Thus, if popular fashion says that a &#x27;blouse&#x27; is ideal for a certain situation or ensemble, this idea is immediately naturalized and accepted as truth, even though the actual sign could just as easily be interchangeable with &#x27;skirt&#x27;, &#x27;vest&#x27; or any number of combinations. In the end Barthes&#x27;s &quot;Mythologies&quot; became absorbed into bourgeois culture, as he found many third parties asking him to comment on a certain cultural phenomenon, being interested in his control over his readership. This turn of events caused him to question the overall utility of demystifying culture for the masses, thinking it might be a fruitless attempt, and drove him deeper in his search for individualistic meaning in art.

===Structuralism and its limits===
As Barthes&#x27;s work with structuralism began to flourish around the time of his debates with Picard, his investigation of structure focused on revealing the importance of language in writing, which he felt was overlooked by old criticism. Barthes&#x27;s &quot;Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narrative&quot; is concerned with examining the correspondence between the structure of a sentence and that of a larger narrative, thus allowing narrative to be viewed along linguistic lines. Barthes split this work into three hierarchical levels: &#x27;functions&#x27;, &#x27;actions&#x27; and &#x27;narrative&#x27;. &#x27;Functions&#x27; are the elementary pieces of a work, such as a single descriptive word that can be used to identify a character. That character would be an &#x27;action&#x27;, and consequently one of the elements that make up the narrative. Barthes was able to use these distinctions to evaluate how certain key &#x27;functions&#x27; work in forming characters. For example, key words like &#x27;dark&#x27;, &#x27;mysterious&#x27; and &#x27;odd&#x27;, when integrated together, formulate a specific kind of character or &#x27;action&#x27;. By breaking down the work into such fundamental distinctions Barthes was able to judge the degree of realism given functions have in forming their actions and consequently with what authenticity a narrative can be said to reflect on reality. Thus, his structuralist theorizing became another exercise in his ongoing attempts to dissect and expose the misleading mechanisms of bourgeois culture.

While Barthes found structuralism to be a useful tool and believed that discourse of literature could be formalized, he did not believe it could become a strict scientific endeavour. In the late 1960s, radical movements were taking place in literary criticism. The post-structuralist movement and the deconstructionism of Jacques Derrida were testing the bounds of the structuralist theory that Barthes&#x27;s work exemplified. Derrida identified the flaw of structuralism as its reliance on a transcendental signifier; a symbol of constant, universal meaning would be essential as an orienting point in such a closed off system. This is to say that without some regular standard of measurement, a system of criticism that references nothing outside of the actual work itself could never prove useful. But since there are no symbols of constant and universal significance, the entire premise of structuralism as a means of evaluating writing (or anything) is hollow.

===Transition===
Such thought led Barthes to consider the limitations not just of signs and symbols, but also of Western culture&#x27;s dependency on beliefs of constancy and ultimate standards. He travelled to Japan in 1966 where he wrote &quot;Empire of Signs&quot; (published in 1970), a meditation on Japanese culture&#x27;s contentment in the absence of a search for a transcendental signifier. He notes that in Japan there is no emphasis on a great focus point by which to judge all other standards, describing the centre of Tokyo, the Emperor&#x27;s Palace, as not a great overbearing entity, but a silent and nondescript presence, avoided and unconsidered. As such, Barthes reflects on the ability of signs in Japan to exist for their own merit, retaining only the significance naturally imbued by their signifiers. Such a society contrasts greatly to the one he dissected in &quot;Mythologies&quot;, which was revealed to be always asserting a greater, more complex significance on top of the natural one.

In the wake of this trip Barthes wrote what is largely considered to be his best-known work, the essay &quot;The Death of the Author&quot; (1967). Barthes saw the notion of the author, or authorial authority, in the criticism of literary text as the forced projection of an ultimate meaning of the text. By imagining an ultimate intended meaning of a piece of literature one could infer an ultimate explanation for it. But Barthes points out that the great proliferation of meaning in language and the unknowable state of the author&#x27;s mind makes any such ultimate realization impossible. As such, the whole notion of the &#x27;knowable text&#x27; acts as little more than another delusion of Western bourgeois culture. Indeed, the idea of giving a book or poem an ultimate end coincides with the notion of making it consumable, something that can be used up and replaced in a capitalist market. &quot;The Death of the Author&quot; is considered to be a post-structuralist work, since it moves past the conventions of trying to quantify literature, but others see it as more of a transitional phase for Barthes in his continuing effort to find significance in culture outside of the bourgeois norms . Indeed, the notion of the author being irrelevant was already a factor of structuralist thinking.

===Textuality and &quot;S/Z&quot;===
Since Barthes contends that there can be no originating anchor of meaning in the possible intentions of the author, he considers what other sources of meaning or significance can be found in literature. He concludes that since meaning can&#x27;t come from the author, it must be actively created by the reader through a process of textual analysis. In his &quot;S/Z&quot; (1970), Barthes applies this notion in an analysis of &quot;Sarrasine&quot;, a Balzac novella. The result was a reading that established five major codes for determining various kinds of significance, with numerous lexias throughout the text – a &quot;lexia&quot; here being defined as a unit of the text chosen arbitrarily (to remain methodologically unbiased as possible) for further analysis. The codes led him to define the story as having a capacity for plurality of meaning, limited by its dependence upon strictly sequential elements (such as a definite timeline that has to be followed by the reader and thus restricts their freedom of analysis). From this project Barthes concludes that an ideal text is one that is reversible, or open to the greatest variety of independent interpretations and not restrictive in meaning. A text can be reversible by avoiding the restrictive devices that &quot;Sarrasine&quot; suffered from, such as strict timelines and exact definitions of events. He describes this as the difference between the writerly text, in which the reader is active in a creative process, and a readerly text in which they are restricted to just reading. The project helped Barthes identify what it was he sought in literature: an openness for interpretation.

===Neutral and novelistic writing===

In the late 1970s, Barthes was increasingly concerned with the conflict of two types of language: that of popular culture, which he saw as limiting and pigeonholing in its titles and descriptions, and neutral, which he saw as open and noncommittal. He called these two conflicting modes the Doxa (the official and unacknowledged systems of meaning through which culture is absorbed)) and the Para-doxa. While Barthes had sympathized with Marxist thought in the past (or at least parallel criticisms), he felt that, despite its anti-ideological stance, Marxist theory was just as guilty of using violent language with assertive meanings, as was bourgeois literature. In this way they were both Doxa and both culturally assimilating. As a reaction to this, he wrote &quot;The Pleasure of the Text&quot; (1975), a study that focused on a subject matter he felt was equally outside the realm of both conservative society and militant leftist thinking: hedonism. By writing about a subject that was rejected by both social extremes of thought, Barthes felt he could avoid the dangers of the limiting language of the Doxa. The theory he developed out of this focus claimed that, while reading for pleasure is a kind of social act, through which the reader exposes him/herself to the ideas of the writer, the final cathartic climax of this pleasurable reading, which he termed the bliss in reading or jouissance, is a point in which one becomes lost within the text. This loss of self within the text or immersion in the text, signifies a final impact of reading that is experienced outside the social realm and free from the influence of culturally associative language and is thus neutral with regard to social progress.

Despite this newest theory of reading, Barthes remained concerned with the difficulty of achieving truly neutral writing, which required an avoidance of any labels that might carry an implied meaning or identity towards a given object. Even carefully crafted neutral writing could be taken in an assertive context through the incidental use of a word with a loaded social context. Barthes felt his past works, like &quot;Mythologies&quot;, had suffered from this. He became interested in finding the best method for creating neutral writing, and he decided to try to create a novelistic form of rhetoric that would not seek to impose its meaning on the reader. One product of this endeavor was &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Discourse: Fragments&quot; in 1977, in which he presents the fictionalized reflections of a lover seeking to identify and be identified by an anonymous amorous other. The unrequited lover&#x27;s search for signs by which to show and receive love makes evident illusory myths involved in such a pursuit. The lover&#x27;s attempts to assert himself into a false, ideal reality is involved in a delusion that exposes the contradictory logic inherent in such a search. Yet at the same time the novelistic character is a sympathetic one, and is thus open not just to criticism but also understanding from the reader. The result is one that challenges the reader&#x27;s views of social constructs of love, without trying to assert any definitive theory of meaning.

=== Mind and body ===
Barthes also attempted to reinterpret the mind–body dualism theory. Like Friedrich Nietzsche and Emmanuel Levinas, he also drew from Eastern philosophical traditions in his critique of European culture as &quot;infected&quot; by Western metaphysics. His body theory emphasized the formation of the self through bodily cultivation. The theory, which is also described as ethico-political entity, considers the idea of the body as one that functions as a &quot;fashion word&quot; that provides the illusion of a grounded discourse. This theory has influenced the work of other thinkers such as Jerome Bel.

===Photography and Henriette Barthes===
Throughout his career, Barthes had an interest in photography and its potential to communicate actual events. Many of his monthly myth articles in the 1950s had attempted to show how a photographic image could represent implied meanings and thus be used by bourgeois culture to infer &#x27;naturalistic truths&#x27;. But he still considered the photograph to have a unique potential for presenting a completely real representation of the world. When his mother, Henriette Barthes, died in 1977 he began writing &quot;Camera Lucida&quot; as an attempt to explain the unique significance a picture of her as a child carried for him. 

Reflecting on the relationship between the obvious symbolic meaning of a photograph (which he called the studium) and that which is purely personal and dependent on the individual, that which &#x27;pierces the viewer&#x27; (which he called the punctum), Barthes was troubled by the fact that such distinctions collapse when personal significance is communicated to others and can have its symbolic logic rationalized. Barthes found the solution to this fine line of personal meaning in the form of his mother&#x27;s picture. Barthes explained that a picture creates a falseness in the illusion of &#x27;what is&#x27;, where &#x27;what was&#x27; would be a more accurate description. As had been made physical through Henriette Barthes&#x27;s death, her childhood photograph is evidence of &#x27;what has ceased to be&#x27;. Instead of making reality solid, it serves as a reminder of the world&#x27;s ever changing nature. Because of this there is something uniquely personal contained in the photograph of Barthes&#x27;s mother that cannot be removed from his subjective state: the recurrent feeling of loss experienced whenever he looks at it. As one of his final works before his death, &quot;Camera Lucida&quot; was both an ongoing reflection on the complicated relations between subjectivity, meaning and cultural society as well as a touching dedication to his mother and description of the depth of his grief.

===Posthumous publications===
A posthumous collection of essays was published in 1987 by François Wahl, &quot;Incidents&quot;. It contains fragments from his journals: his &quot;Soirées de Paris&quot; (a 1979 extract from his erotic diary of life in Paris); an earlier diary he kept which explicitly detailed his paying for sex with men and boys in Morocco; and &quot;Light of the Sud Ouest&quot; (his childhood memories of rural French life). In November 2007, Yale University Press published a new translation into English (by Richard Howard) of Barthes&#x27;s little known work &quot;What is Sport&quot;. This work bears a considerable resemblance to &quot;Mythologies&quot; and was originally commissioned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as the text for a documentary film directed by Hubert Aquin.

In February 2009, Éditions du Seuil published &quot;Journal de deuil&quot; (Journal of Mourning), based on Barthes&#x27;s files written from 26 November 1977 (the day following his mother&#x27;s death) up to 15 September 1979, intimate notes on his terrible loss:
He grieved his mother&#x27;s death for the rest of his life: &quot;Do not say mourning. It&#x27;s too psychoanalytic. I&#x27;m not in mourning. I&#x27;m suffering.&quot; and &quot;In the corner of my room where she had been bedridden, where she had died and where I now sleep, in the wall where her headboard had stood against I hung an icon—not out of faith. And I always put some flowers on a table. I do not wish to travel anymore so that I may stay here and prevent the flowers from withering away.&quot;

In 2012 the book &quot;Travels in China&quot; was published. It consists of his notes from a three-week trip to China he undertook with a group from the literary journal Tel Quel in 1974. The experience left him somewhat disappointed, as he found China &quot;not at all exotic, not at all disorienting&quot;.

==Influence==
Roland Barthes&#x27;s criticism contributed to the development of theoretical schools such as structuralism, semiotics, and post-structuralism. While his influence is mainly found in these theoretical fields with which his work brought him into contact, it is also felt in every field concerned with the representation of information and models of communication, including computers, photography, music, and literature. One consequence of Barthes&#x27;s breadth of focus is that his legacy includes no following of thinkers dedicated to modeling themselves after him. The fact that Barthes&#x27;s work was ever adapting and refuting notions of stability and constancy means there is no canon of thought within his theory to model one&#x27;s thoughts upon, and thus no &quot;Barthesism&quot;.

==Key terms==
&quot;Readerly&quot; and &quot;writerly&quot; are terms Barthes employs both to delineate one type of literature from another and to implicitly interrogate ways of reading, like positive or negative habits the modern reader brings into one&#x27;s experience with the text itself. These terms are most explicitly fleshed out in &quot;S/Z&quot;, while the essay &quot;From Work to Text&quot;, from &quot;Image—Music—Text&quot; (1977), provides an analogous parallel look at the active–passive and postmodern–modern ways of interacting with a text.

===Readerly text===
A text that makes no requirement of the reader to &quot;write&quot; or &quot;produce&quot; their own meanings. The reader may passively locate &quot;ready-made&quot; meaning. Barthes writes that these sorts of texts are &quot;controlled by the principle of non-contradiction&quot; (156), that is, they do not disturb the &quot;common sense,&quot; or &quot;Doxa,&quot; of the surrounding culture. The &quot;readerly texts,&quot; moreover, &quot;are products [that] make up the enormous mass of our literature&quot; (5). Within this category, there is a spectrum of &quot;replete literature,&quot; which comprises &quot;any classic (readerly) texts&quot; that work &quot;like a cupboard where meanings are shelved, stacked, [and] safeguarded&quot; (200).&lt;ref name=&quot;S/Z&quot;&gt;Barthes, Roland. S/Z: An Essay. Trans. Richard Miller. New York: Hill and Wang, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writerly text===
A text that aspires to the proper goal of literature and criticism: &quot;... to make the reader no longer a consumer but a producer of the text&quot; (4). Writerly texts and ways of reading constitute, in short, an active rather than passive way of interacting with a culture and its texts. A culture and its texts, Barthes writes, should never be accepted in their given forms and traditions. As opposed to the &quot;readerly texts&quot; as &quot;product,&quot; the &quot;writerly text is ourselves writing, before the infinite play of the world is traversed, intersected, stopped, plasticized by some singular system (Ideology, Genus, Criticism) which reduces the plurality of entrances, the opening of networks, the infinity of languages&quot; (5). Thus reading becomes for Barthes &quot;not a parasitical act, the reactive complement of a writing&quot;, but rather a &quot;form of work&quot; (10).

===The &quot;Author&quot; and the &quot;scriptor&quot;===
&quot;Author&quot; and &quot;scriptor&quot; are terms Barthes uses to describe different ways of thinking about the creators of texts. &quot;The author&quot; is the traditional concept of the lone genius creating a work of literature or other piece of writing by the powers of his/her original imagination. For Barthes, such a figure is no longer viable. The insights offered by an array of modern thought, including the insights of Surrealism, have rendered the term obsolete. In place of the author, the modern world offers a figure Barthes calls the &quot;scriptor,&quot; whose only power is to combine pre-existing texts in new ways. Barthes believes that all writing draws on previous texts, norms, and conventions, and that these are the things to which the reader must turn to understand a text. As a way of asserting the relative unimportance of the writer&#x27;s biography compared to these textual and generic conventions, Barthes says that the scriptor has no past, but is born with the text. He also argues that, in the absence of the idea of an &quot;author-God&quot; to control the meaning of a work, interpretive horizons are opened up considerably for the active reader. As Barthes puts it, &quot;the death of the author is the birth of the reader.&quot;

==Criticism==
In 1964, Barthes wrote &quot;The Last Happy Writer&quot; (&quot;Le dernier des écrivains heureux&quot; in &quot;Essais critiques&quot;), the title of which refers to Voltaire. In the essay he commented on the problems of the modern thinker after discovering the relativism in thought and philosophy, discrediting previous philosophers who avoided this difficulty. Disagreeing roundly with Barthes&#x27;s description of Voltaire, Daniel Gordon, the translator and editor of &quot;Candide&quot; (The Bedford Series in History and Culture), wrote that &quot;never has one brilliant writer so thoroughly misunderstood another.&quot;

The sinologist Simon Leys, in a review of Barthes&#x27;s diary of a trip to China during the Cultural Revolution, disparages Barthes for his seeming indifference to the situation of the Chinese people, and says that Barthes &quot;has contrived—amazingly—to bestow an entirely new dignity upon the age-old activity, so long unjustly disparaged, of saying nothing at great length.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Barthes&#x27;s &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Discourse: Fragments&quot; was the inspiration for the name of 1980s new wave duo The Lover Speaks.

Jeffrey Eugenides&#x27; &quot;The Marriage Plot&quot; draws out excerpts from Barthes&#x27;s &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Discourse: Fragments&quot; as a way to depict the unique intricacies of love that one of the main characters, Madeleine Hanna, experiences throughout the novel.

In the film &quot;Birdman&quot; (2014) by Alejandro González Iñárritu, a journalist quotes to the protagonist Riggan Thompson an extract from &quot;Mythologies&quot;: &quot;The cultural work done in the past by gods and epic sagas is now done by laundry-detergent commercials and comic-strip characters&quot;.

In the film &quot;The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs&quot; (1996) by Michael Lehmann, Brian is reading an extract from &quot;Camera Lucida&quot; over the phone to someone he thinks to be a beautiful woman but is actually her more intellectual and less physically desirable friend.

In the film &quot;Elegy&quot;, based on Philip Roth&#x27;s novel &quot;The Dying Animal&quot;, the character of Consuela (played by Penélope Cruz) is first depicted in the film carrying a copy of Barthes&#x27;s &quot;The Pleasure of the Text&quot; on the campus of the university where she is a student.

Laurent Binet&#x27;s novel &quot;The 7th Function of Language&quot; is based on the premise that Barthes was not merely accidentally hit by a van driver but that he was instead murdered, as part of a conspiracy to acquire a document known as the &quot;Seventh Function of Language&quot;.

<text>Armand John &quot;A.J.&quot; Piron (August 16, 1888 – February 17, 1943) was an American jazz violinist who led dance bands during the 1910s thru the 1930s.

==Early life==
A.J. Piron was born August 16, 1888, to Octave Louis Piron and Marie Jeanne Zeringue (Jennie). While this is the date according to his draft registration card, his birth record states he was born August 26, 1889. The former date is more widely accepted. At home his family spoke English and French patois, although Piron spoke mostly English.

Piron grew up with his five siblings in the 7th Ward at 1523-24 Columbus Street, steps from Claiborne Avenue, which at that time was a bustling, tree-lined center of commerce and community life. Octave Piron was a shoemaker and a musician himself. He was both a music teacher and played in the Philharmonic Orchestra alongside many well known musicians of the time like Manuel Perez, Charlie Elgar, Ida Rose, and Alphonse Picou, among others. Octave Piron taught his sons Milford, Albert, and Armand Piron how to play. 

At the age of seven Piron had an accident that damaged one of his legs. For the next five years while Piron recovered, he devoted himself to practicing the violin. This could be the reason A.J. Piron didn&#x27;t join the numerous marching bands popular in New Orleans at that time but instead became a dance and concert band musician. At age twelve Piron made his musical debut when he joined a band his father led that included some of his students and Piron&#x27;s brothers. 

== Career ==
In 1903 Piron began playing in the Bloom Philharmonic. In 1908 he played for the Peerless Orchestra. Then in 1913 he played in the large, legendary orchestra organized by John P. Robichaux for the Carnival ball of the Elves of Oberon. That same year Piron was playing at the Rose Bud Theater on Dryades Street, sometimes with Papa Celestin&#x27;s Tuxedo band. He also played in the Olympia Band with Sydney Bechet, Kid Ory, Louis Keppard, and Clarence Williams, among others.

After touring briefly with W.C. Handy in 1917, Piron started an orchestra which included Lorenzo Tio, Steve Lewis, John Lindsay, and Peter Bocage. The theme song of the orchestra was &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot;, written by Piron and Steve Lewis. In 1923, Piron took his band to New York City.

<text>Fiberglass (American English) or fibreglass (Commonwealth English) is a common type of fiber-reinforced plastic using glass fiber. The fibers may be randomly arranged, flattened into a sheet called a chopped strand mat, or woven into glass cloth. The plastic matrix may be a thermoset polymer matrix—most often based on thermosetting polymers such as epoxy, polyester resin, or vinyl ester resin—or a thermoplastic.

Cheaper and more flexible than carbon fiber, it is stronger than many metals by weight, non-magnetic, non-conductive, transparent to electromagnetic radiation, can be molded into complex shapes, and is chemically inert under many circumstances. Applications include aircraft, boats, automobiles, bath tubs and enclosures, swimming pools, hot tubs, septic tanks, water tanks, roofing, pipes, cladding, orthopedic casts, surfboards, and external door skins.

Other common names for fiberglass are glass-reinforced plastic (GRP), glass-fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) or GFK (from ). Because glass fiber itself is sometimes referred to as &quot;fiberglass&quot;, the composite is also called fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP). This article uses &quot;fiberglass&quot; to refer to the complete fiber-reinforced composite material, rather than only to the glass fiber within it.

== History ==
Glass fibers have been produced for centuries, but the earliest patent was awarded to the Prussian inventor Hermann Hammesfahr (1845–1914) in the U.S. in 1880.

Mass production of glass strands was accidentally discovered in 1932 when Games Slayter, a researcher at Owens-Illinois, directed a jet of compressed air at a stream of molten glass and produced fibers. A patent for this method of producing glass wool was first applied for in 1933. Owens joined with the Corning company in 1935 and the method was adapted by Owens Corning to produce its patented &quot;Fiberglas&quot; (spelled with one &quot;s&quot;) in 1936. Originally, Fiberglas was a glass wool with fibers entrapping a great deal of gas, making it useful as an insulator, especially at high temperatures.

A suitable resin for combining the fiberglass with a plastic to produce a composite material was developed in 1936 by DuPont. The first ancestor of modern polyester resins is Cyanamid&#x27;s resin of 1942. Peroxide curing systems were used by then. With the combination of fiberglass and resin the gas content of the material was replaced by plastic. This reduced the insulation properties to values typical of the plastic, but now for the first time, the composite showed great strength and promise as a structural and building material. Many glass fiber composites continued to be called &quot;fiberglass&quot; (as a generic name) and the name was also used for the low-density glass wool product containing gas instead of plastic.

Ray Greene of Owens Corning is credited with producing the first composite boat in 1937 but did not proceed further at the time because of the brittle nature of the plastic used. In 1939 the Soviet Union was reported to have constructed a passenger boat of plastic materials, and the United States a fuselage and wings of an aircraft. The first car to have a fiberglass body was a 1946 prototype of the Stout Scarab, but the model did not enter production.

==Fiber==

Unlike glass fibers used for insulation, for the final structure to be strong, the fiber&#x27;s surfaces must be almost entirely free of defects, as this permits the fibers to reach gigapascal tensile strengths. If a bulk piece of glass were defect-free, it would be as strong as glass fibers; however, it is generally impractical to produce and maintain bulk material in a defect-free state outside of laboratory conditions.

=== Production ===
The process of manufacturing fiberglass is called pultrusion. The manufacturing process for glass fibers suitable for reinforcement uses large furnaces to gradually melt the silica sand, limestone, kaolin clay, fluorspar, colemanite, dolomite and other minerals until a liquid forms. It is then extruded through bushings (spinneret), which are bundles of very small orifices (typically 5–25 micrometres in diameter for E-Glass, 9 micrometres for S-Glass).

These filaments are then &quot;sized&quot; (coated) with a chemical solution. The individual filaments are now bundled in large numbers to provide a roving. The diameter of the filaments, and the number of filaments in the roving, determine its &quot;weight&quot;, typically expressed in one of two measurement systems:
*&quot;yield&quot;, or yards per pound (the number of yards of fiber in one pound of material; thus a smaller number means a heavier roving). Examples of standard yields are 225yield, 450yield, 675yield.
*&quot;tex&quot;, or grams per km (how many grams 1 km of roving weighs, inverted from yield; thus a smaller number means a lighter roving). Examples of standard tex are 750tex, 1100tex, 2200tex.

These rovings are then either used directly in a composite application such as pultrusion, filament winding (pipe), gun roving (where an automated gun chops the glass into short lengths and drops it into a jet of resin, projected onto the surface of a mold), or in an intermediary step, to manufacture fabrics such as &quot;chopped strand mat&quot; (CSM) (made of randomly oriented small cut lengths of fiber all bonded together), woven fabrics, knit fabrics or unidirectional fabrics.

====Chopped strand mat====
Chopped strand mat (CSM) is a form of reinforcement used in fiberglass. It consists of glass fibers laid randomly across each other and held together by a binder. It is typically processed using the hand lay-up technique, where sheets of material are placed on a mold and brushed with resin. Because the binder dissolves in resin, the material easily conforms to different shapes when wetted out. After the resin cures, the hardened product can be taken from the mold and finished. Using chopped strand mat gives the fiberglass isotropic in-plane material properties.

===Sizing===
A coating or primer is applied to the roving to help protect the glass filaments for processing and manipulation and to ensure proper bonding to the resin matrix, thus allowing for the transfer of shear loads from the glass fibers to the thermoset plastic. Without this bonding, the fibers can &#x27;slip&#x27; in the matrix causing localized failure.

==Properties==
An individual structural glass fiber is both stiff and strong in tension and compression—that is, &quot;along&quot; its axis. Although it might be assumed that the fiber is weak in compression, it is actually only the long aspect ratio of the fiber which makes it seem so; i.e., because a typical fiber is long and narrow, it buckles easily. On the other hand, the glass fiber is weak in shear—that is, &quot;across&quot; its axis. Therefore, if a collection of fibers can be arranged permanently in a preferred direction within a material, and if they can be prevented from buckling in compression, the material will be preferentially strong in that direction.

Furthermore, by laying multiple layers of fiber on top of one another, with each layer oriented in various preferred directions, the material&#x27;s overall stiffness and strength can be efficiently controlled. In fiberglass, it is the plastic matrix which permanently constrains the structural glass fibers to directions chosen by the designer. With chopped strand mat, this directionality is essentially an entire two-dimensional plane; with woven fabrics or unidirectional layers, directionality of stiffness and strength can be more precisely controlled within the plane.

A fiberglass component is typically of a thin &quot;shell&quot; construction, sometimes filled on the inside with structural foam, as in the case of surfboards. The component may be of nearly arbitrary shape, limited only by the complexity and tolerances of the mold used for manufacturing the shell.

The mechanical functionality of materials is heavily reliant on the combined performances of both the resin (AKA matrix) and fibers. For example, in severe temperature conditions (over 180 °C), the resin component of the composite may lose its functionality, partially due to bond deterioration of resin and fiber. However, GFRPs can still show significant residual strength after experiencing high temperatures (200 °C).

One notable feature of fiberglass is that the resins used are subject to contraction during the curing process. For polyester this contraction is often 5–6%; for epoxy, about 2%. Because the fibers do not contract, this differential can create changes in the shape of the part during curing. Distortions can appear hours, days, or weeks after the resin has set. While this distortion can be minimized by symmetric use of the fibers in the design, a certain amount of internal stress is created; and if it becomes too great, cracks form.

=== Types ===

The most common types of glass fiber used in fiberglass is E-glass, which is alumino-borosilicate glass with less than 1% w/w alkali oxides, mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics. Other types of glass used are A-glass (Alkali-lime glass with little or no boron oxide), E-CR-glass (Electrical/Chemical Resistance; alumino-lime silicate with less than 1% w/w alkali oxides, with high acid resistance), C-glass (alkali-lime glass with high boron oxide content, used for glass staple fibers and insulation), D-glass (borosilicate glass, named for its low Dielectric constant), R-glass (alumino silicate glass without MgO and CaO with high mechanical requirements as Reinforcement), and S-glass (alumino silicate glass without CaO but with high MgO content with high tensile strength).

Pure silica (silicon dioxide), when cooled as fused quartz into a glass with no true melting point, can be used as a glass fiber for fiberglass but has the drawback that it must be worked at very high temperatures. In order to lower the necessary work temperature, other materials are introduced as &quot;fluxing agents&quot; (i.e., components to lower the melting point). Ordinary A-glass (&quot;A&quot; for &quot;alkali-lime&quot;) or soda lime glass, crushed and ready to be remelted, as so-called cullet glass, was the first type of glass used for fiberglass. E-glass (&quot;E&quot; because of initial Electrical application), is alkali-free and was the first glass formulation used for continuous filament formation. It now makes up most of the fiberglass production in the world, and also is the single largest consumer of boron minerals globally. It is susceptible to chloride ion attack and is a poor choice for marine applications. S-glass (&quot;S&quot; for &quot;stiff&quot;) is used when tensile strength (high modulus) is important and is thus an important building and aircraft epoxy composite (it is called R-glass, &quot;R&quot; for &quot;reinforcement&quot; in Europe). C-glass (&quot;C&quot; for &quot;chemical resistance&quot;) and T-glass (&quot;T&quot; is for &quot;thermal insulator&quot;—a North American variant of C-glass) are resistant to chemical attack; both are often found in insulation-grades of blown fiberglass.

=== Table of some common fiberglass types ===
==Applications==
Fiberglass is versatile because it is lightweight, strong, weather-resistant, and can have a variety of surface textures.

During World War II, fiberglass was developed as a replacement for the molded plywood used in aircraft radomes (fiberglass being transparent to microwaves). Its first main civilian application was for the building of boats and sports car bodies, where it gained acceptance in the 1950s. Its use has broadened to the automotive and sport equipment sectors. In the production of some products, such as aircraft, carbon fiber is now used instead of fiberglass, which is stronger by volume and weight.

Advanced manufacturing techniques such as pre-pregs and fiber rovings extend fiberglass&#x27;s applications and the tensile strength possible with fiber-reinforced plastics.

Fiberglass is also used in the telecommunications industry for shrouding antennas, due to its RF permeability and low signal attenuation properties. It may also be used to conceal other equipment where no signal permeability is required, such as equipment cabinets and steel support structures, due to the ease with which it can be molded and painted to blend with existing structures and surfaces. Other uses include sheet-form electrical insulators and structural components commonly found in power-industry products. Because of fiberglass&#x27;s lightweight and durability, it is often used in protective equipment such as helmets. Many sports use fiberglass protective gear, such as goaltenders&#x27; and catchers&#x27; masks.

===Storage tanks===

Storage tanks can be made of fiberglass with capacities up to about 300 tonnes. Smaller tanks can be made with chopped strand mat cast over a thermoplastic inner tank which acts as a preform during construction. Much more reliable tanks are made using woven mat or filament wound fiber, with the fiber orientation at right angles to the hoop stress imposed in the sidewall by the contents. Such tanks tend to be used for chemical storage because the plastic liner (often polypropylene) is resistant to a wide range of corrosive chemicals. Fiberglass is also used for septic tanks.

===House building===

Glass-reinforced plastics are also used to produce house building components such as roofing laminate, door surrounds, over-door canopies, window canopies and dormers, chimneys, coping systems, and heads with keystones and sills. The material&#x27;s reduced weight and easier handling, compared to wood or metal, allows faster installation. Mass-produced fiberglass brick-effect panels can be used in the construction of composite housing, and can include insulation to reduce heat loss.

===Oil and gas artificial lift systems===
In rod pumping applications, fiberglass rods are often used for their high tensile strength to weight ratio. Fiberglass rods provide an advantage over steel rods because they stretch more elastically (lower Young&#x27;s modulus) than steel for a given weight, meaning more oil can be lifted from the hydrocarbon reservoir to the surface with each stroke, all while reducing the load on the pumping unit.

Fiberglass rods must be kept in tension, however, as they frequently part if placed in even a small amount of compression. The buoyancy of the rods within a fluid amplifies this tendency.

===Piping===
GRP and GRE pipe can be used in a variety of above- and below-ground systems, including those for desalination, water treatment, water distribution networks, chemical process plants, water used for firefighting, hot and cold drinking water, wastewater/sewage, municipal waste and liquified petroleum gas.

===Boating===

Fiberglass composite boats have been made since the early 1940s, and many sailing vessels made after 1950 were built using the fiberglass lay-up process. As of 2022, boats continue to be made with fiberglass, though more advanced techniques such as vacuum bag moulding are used in the construction process.

===Armour===
Though most bullet-resistant armours are made using different textiles, fiberglass composites have been shown to be effective as ballistic armor.

==Construction methods==
===Filament winding===
Filament winding is a fabrication technique mainly used for manufacturing open (cylinders) or closed-end structures (pressure vessels or tanks). The process involves winding filaments under tension over a male mandrel. The mandrel rotates while a wind eye on a carriage moves horizontally, laying down fibers in the desired pattern. The most common filaments are carbon or glass fiber and are coated with synthetic resin as they are wound. Once the mandrel is completely covered to the desired thickness, the resin is cured; often the mandrel is placed in an oven to achieve this, though sometimes radiant heaters are used with the mandrel still turning in the machine. Once the resin has cured, the mandrel is removed, leaving the hollow final product. For some products such as gas bottles, the &#x27;mandrel&#x27; is a permanent part of the finished product forming a liner to prevent gas leakage or as a barrier to protect the composite from the fluid to be stored.

Filament winding is well suited to automation, and there are many applications, such as pipe and small pressure vessels that are wound and cured without any human intervention. The controlled variables for winding are fiber type, resin content, wind angle, tow or bandwidth and thickness of the fiber bundle. The angle at which the fiber has an effect on the properties of the final product. A high angle &quot;hoop&quot; will provide circumferential or &quot;burst&quot; strength, while lower angle patterns (polar or helical) will provide greater longitudinal tensile strength.

Products currently being produced using this technique range from pipes, golf clubs, Reverse Osmosis Membrane Housings, oars, bicycle forks, bicycle rims, power and transmission poles, pressure vessels to missile casings, aircraft fuselages and lamp posts and yacht masts.

===Fiberglass hand lay-up operation===

A release agent, usually in either wax or liquid form, is applied to the chosen mold to allow the finished product to be cleanly removed from the mold. Resin—typically a 2-part thermoset polyester, vinyl, or epoxy—is mixed with its hardener and applied to the surface. Sheets of fiberglass matting are laid into the mold, then more resin mixture is added using a brush or roller. The material must conform to the mold, and air must not be trapped between the fiberglass and the mold. Additional resin is applied and possibly additional sheets of fiberglass. Hand pressure, vacuum or rollers are used to be sure the resin saturates and fully wets all layers, and that any air pockets are removed. The work must be done quickly before the resin starts to cure unless high-temperature resins are used which will not cure until the part is warmed in an oven. In some cases, the work is covered with plastic sheets and vacuum is drawn on the work to remove air bubbles and press the fiberglass to the shape of the mold.

===Fiberglass spray lay-up operation===
The fiberglass spray lay-up process is similar to the hand lay-up process but differs in the application of the fiber and resin to the mold. Spray-up is an open-molding composites fabrication process where resin and reinforcements are sprayed onto a mold. The resin and glass may be applied separately or simultaneously &quot;chopped&quot; in a combined stream from a chopper gun. Workers roll out the spray-up to compact the laminate. Wood, foam or other core material may then be added, and a secondary spray-up layer imbeds the core between the laminates. The part is then cured, cooled, and removed from the reusable mold.

===Pultrusion operation===

Pultrusion is a manufacturing method used to make strong, lightweight composite materials. In pultrusion, material is pulled through forming machinery using either a hand-over-hand method or a continuous-roller method (as opposed to extrusion, where the material is pushed through dies).
In fiberglass pultrusion, fibers (the glass material) are pulled from spools through a device that coats them with a resin. They are then typically heat-treated and cut to length. Fiberglass produced this way can be made in a variety of shapes and cross-sections, such as W or S cross-sections.

== Health hazards ==
===Exposure===
People can be exposed to fiberglass in the workplace during its fabrication, installation or removal, by breathing it in, by skin contact, or by eye contact. 
Furthermore, in the manufacturing process of fiberglass, styrene vapors are released while the resins are cured. These are also irritating to mucous membranes and respiratory tract.
The general population can get exposed to fibreglass from insulation and building materials or from fibers in the air near manufacturing facilities or when they are near building fires or implosions. The American Lung Association advises that fiberglass insulation should never be left exposed in an occupied area. Since work practices are not always followed, and fiberglass is often left exposed in basements that later become occupied, people can get exposed. No readily usable biological or clinical indices of exposure exist.

===Symptoms and signs, health effects===
Fiberglass will irritate the eyes, skin, and the respiratory system. Hence, symptoms can include itchy eyes, skin, nose, sore throat, hoarseness, dyspnea (breathing difficulty) and cough. Peak alveolar deposition was observed in rodents and humans for fibers with diameters of 1 to 2 μm.
In animal experiments, adverse lung effects such as lung inflammation and lung fibrosis have occurred, and increased incidences of mesothelioma, pleural sarcoma, and lung carcinoma had been found with intrapleural or intratracheal instillations in rats.

As of 2001, in humans only the more biopersistent materials like ceramic fibres, which are used industrially as insulation in high-temperature environments such as blast furnaces, and certain special-purpose glass wools not used as insulating materials remain classified as possible carcinogens (IARC Group 2B). The more commonly used glass fibre wools including insulation glass wool, rock wool and slag wool are considered not classifiable as to carcinogenicity to humans (IARC Group 3).
In October 2001, all fiberglass wools commonly used for thermal and acoustical insulation were reclassified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as &quot;not classifiable as to carcinogenicity to humans&quot; (IARC group 3). &quot;Epidemiologic studies published during the 15 years since the previous IARC monographs review of these fibers in 1988 provide no evidence of increased risks of lung cancer or mesothelioma (cancer of the lining of the body cavities) from occupational exposures during the manufacture of these materials, and inadequate evidence overall of any cancer risk.&quot;
In June 2011, the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) removed from its Report on Carcinogens all biosoluble glass wool used in home and building insulation and for non-insulation products. However, NTP still considers fibrous glass dust to be &quot;reasonably anticipated [as] a human carcinogen (Certain Glass Wool Fibers (Inhalable))&quot;. Similarly, California&#x27;s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) published a November, 2011 modification to its Proposition 65 listing to include only &quot;Glass wool fibers (inhalable and biopersistent).&quot; Therefore a cancer warning label for biosoluble fiber glass home and building insulation is no longer required under federal or California law. As of 2012, the North American Insulation Manufacturers Association stated that fiberglass is safe to manufacture, install and use when recommended work practices are followed to reduce temporary mechanical irritation.

As of 2012, the European Union and Germany have classified synthetic glass fibers as possibly or probably carcinogenic, but fibers can be exempt from this classification if they pass specific tests. A 2012 health hazard review for the European Commission stated that inhalation of fiberglass at concentrations of 3, 16 and 30 mg/m3 &quot;did not induce fibrosis nor tumours except transient lung inflammation that disappeared after a post-exposure recovery period.&quot; 
Historic reviews of the epidemiology studies had been conducted by Harvard&#x27;s Medical and Public Health Schools in 1995, the National Academy of Sciences in 2000, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (&quot;ATSDR&quot;) in 2004, and the National Toxicology Program in 2011. which reached the same conclusion as IARC that there is no evidence of increased risk from occupational exposure to glass wool fibers.

===Pathophysiology===
Genetic and toxic effects are exerted through production of reactive oxygen species, which can damage DNA, and cause chromosomal aberrations, nuclear abnormalities, mutations, gene amplification in proto-oncogenes, and cell transformation in mammalian cells. There is also indirect, inflammation-driven genotoxicity through reactive oxygen species by inflammatory cells. The longer and thinner as well as the more durable (biopersistent) fibers were, the more potent they were in damage.

===Regulation, exposure limits===
In the US, fine mineral fiber emissions have been regulated by the EPA, but respirable fibers (“particulates not otherwise regulated”) are regulated by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); OSHA has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for fiberglass exposure in the workplace as 15 mg/m3 total and 5 mg/m3 in respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 3 fibers/cm3 (less than 3.5 micrometers in diameter and greater than 10 micrometers in length) as a time-weighted average over an 8-hour workday, and a 5 mg/m3 total limit.

As of 2001, the Hazardous Substances Ordinance in Germany dictates a maximum occupational exposure limit of 86 mg/m3. In certain concentrations, a potentially explosive mixture may occur. Further manufacture of GRP components (grinding, cutting, sawing) creates fine dust and chips containing glass filaments, as well as tacky dust, in quantities high enough to affect health and the functionality of machines and equipment. The installation of effective extraction and filtration equipment is required to ensure safety and efficiency.

<doc id="174437" wikidata="Q2545565" url="?curid=174437" title="Oh! What a Lovely War">
<text>Oh! What a Lovely War is a 1969 British epic comedy historical musical war film directed by Richard Attenborough (in his directorial debut), with an ensemble cast, including Maggie Smith, Dirk Bogarde, John Gielgud, John Mills, Kenneth More, Laurence Olivier, Jack Hawkins, Corin Redgrave, Michael Redgrave, Vanessa Redgrave, Ralph Richardson, Ian Holm, Paul Shelley, Malcolm McFee, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Nanette Newman, Edward Fox, Susannah York, John Clements, Phyllis Calvert and Maurice Roëves.

The film is based on the stage musical &quot;Oh, What a Lovely War!&quot;, originated by Charles Chilton as the radio play &quot;The Long Long Trail&quot; in December 1961, and transferred to stage by Gerry Raffles in partnership with Joan Littlewood and her Theatre Workshop in 1963.

The title is derived from the music hall song &quot;Oh! It&#x27;s a Lovely War&quot;, which is one of the major numbers in the film.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; summarises and takes a satirical view on the events of the First World War using popular songs of the time, many of which were parodies of older popular songs, and using allegorical settings such as Brighton&#x27;s West Pier to criticise the manner in which the eventual victory was won.

The diplomatic manoeuvring and events involving those in authority are set in a fantasy location inside the pierhead pavilion, far from the trenches. In the opening scene, various foreign ministers, generals and heads of state walk over a huge map of Europe, reciting actual words spoken by these figures at the time. An unnamed photographer takes a picture of Europe&#x27;s rulers – after handing two red poppies to the Archduke Ferdinand and his wife, the Duchess of Hohenberg, he takes their picture, &quot;assassinating&quot; them as the flash goes off. Many of the heads of state enjoy good personal relations and are reluctant to go to war: a tearful Emperor Franz Josef declares war on Serbia after being deceived by his Foreign Minister, and Tsar Nicholas II and Kaiser Wilhelm II are shown as unable to overrule their countries&#x27; military mobilisation schedules. The German invasion of Belgium leaves Sir Edward Grey little choice but to get involved. Italy reneges on its alliance with the Central Powers (it joined the Allies in 1915) but Turkey joins them instead.

The start of the war in 1914 is shown as a parade of optimism. The protagonists are an archetypal British family of the time, the Smiths, who are shown entering Brighton&#x27;s West Pier, with General Haig selling tickets – the film later follows the young Smith men through their experiences in the trenches. A military band rouses holidaymakers from the beach to rally round and follow – some even literally boarding a bandwagon. The first Battle of Mons is similarly cheerfully depicted yet more realistic in portrayal. Both scenes are flooded in pleasant sunshine.

When the casualties start to mount, a theatre audience is rallied by singing &quot;Are We Downhearted? No!&quot; A chorus line dressed in frilled yellow dresses, recruits a volunteer army with &quot;We don&#x27;t want to lose you, but we think you ought to go&quot;. A music hall star (Maggie Smith) then enters a lone spotlight, and lures the still doubtful young men in the audience into &quot;taking the King&#x27;s Shilling&quot; by singing about how every day she &quot;walks out&quot; with different men in uniform, and that &quot;On Saturday I&#x27;m willing, if you&#x27;ll only take the shilling, to make a man of any one of you.&quot; The young men take to the stage and are quickly moved offstage and into military life, and the initially alluring music hall singer is depicted on close-up as a coarse, over-made-up harridan.

The red poppy crops up again as a symbol of impending death, often being handed to a soldier about to be sent to die. These scenes are juxtaposed with the pavilion, now housing the top military brass. There is a scoreboard (a dominant motif in the original theatre production) showing the loss of life and &quot;yards gained&quot;.

Outside, Sylvia Pankhurst (Vanessa Redgrave) is shown addressing a hostile crowd on the futility of war, upbraiding them for believing everything they read in the newspapers. She is met with catcalls and jeered from her podium.

1915 is depicted as darkly contrasting in tone. Many shots of a parade of wounded men illustrate an endless stream of grim, hopeless faces. Black humour among these soldiers has now replaced the enthusiasm of the early days. &quot;There&#x27;s a Long, Long Trail a-Winding&quot; captures the new mood of despair, depicting soldiers filing along in torrential rain in miserable conditions. Red poppies provide the only bright colour in these scenes. In a scene of British soldiers drinking in an estaminet, a Soubrette (Pia Colombo) leads them in a jolly chorus of &quot;The Moon Shines Bright on Charlie Chaplin&quot;, a reworking of an American song then shifts the mood back to darker tone by singing a soft and sombre version of &quot;Adieu la vie&quot;. At the end of the year, amidst more manoeuvres in the pavilion, General (later Field Marshal) Douglas Haig replaces Field Marshal Sir John French as Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces. Haig is then mocked by Australian troops who see him inspecting British soldiers; they sing &quot;They were only playing Leapfrog&quot; to the tune of &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot;.

An interfaith religious service is held in a ruined abbey. A priest tells the gathered soldiers that each religion has endorsed the war by way of allowing soldiers to eat pork if Jewish, meat on Fridays if Catholic, and work through the sabbath if in service of the war for all religions. He also says the Dalai Lama has blessed the war effort.

1916 passes and the film&#x27;s tone darkens again. The songs contain contrasting tones of wistfulness, stoicism and resignation, including &quot;The Bells of Hell Go Ting-a-ling-a-ling&quot;, &quot;If the Sergeant Steals Your Rum, Never Mind&quot; and &quot;Hanging on the Old Barbed Wire&quot;. The wounded are laid out in ranks at the field station, a stark contrast to the healthy rows of young men who entered the war. The camera often lingers on Harry Smith&#x27;s silently suffering face.

The Americans arrive, but are shown only in the &quot;disconnected reality&quot; of the pavilion, interrupting the deliberations of the British generals by singing &quot;Over There&quot; with the changed final line: &quot;And we won&#x27;t come back – we&#x27;ll be buried over there!&quot; The resolute-looking American captain seizes the map from an astonished Haig.

Jack notices with disgust that after three years of fighting, he is literally back where he started, at Mons. As the Armistice is sounding, Jack is the last one to die. There is a splash of red which at first glance appears to be blood, but which turns out to be yet another poppy out of focus in the foreground. Jack&#x27;s spirit wanders through the battlefield, and he eventually finds himself in the room where the elder statesmen of Europe are drafting the coming peace – but they are oblivious to his presence. Jack finally finds himself on a tranquil hillside, where he joins his brothers for a lie down on the grass, where their figures morph into crosses. The film closes with a long slow pan out that ends in a dizzying aerial view of countless soldiers&#x27; graves, as the voices of the dead sing &quot;We&#x27;ll Never Tell Them&quot; (a parody of the Jerome Kern song &quot;They Didn&#x27;t Believe Me&quot;).

==Production==
The producers were the novelist Len Deighton, photographer Brian Duffy and Richard Attenborough, who was making his directorial debut. The Deighton Duffy production company had produced the film adaptation of Deighton&#x27;s &quot;Only When I Larf&quot; starring Richard Attenborough. Deighton wrote the screenplay for &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; and the opening title sequence was created by Len Deighton&#x27;s lifelong friend Raymond Hawkey, the designer responsible for many of Deighton&#x27;s book covers in the 1960s. In an attempt to shame other people who he thought were claiming credit for things they hadn&#x27;t actually done, Deighton decided not to be listed in the film credits, a gesture he later described as &quot;stupid and infantile&quot;.

The 1969 film transferred the mise-en-scène completely into the cinematic domain, with elaborate sequences shot at West Pier in Brighton, elsewhere in Brighton and on the South Downs, interspersed with motifs from the stage production. These included the &#x27;cricket&#x27; scoreboards showing the number of dead, but Deighton did not use the pierrot costumes. However, as many critics, including Pauline Kael, noted, the treatment diminished the effect of the numbers of deaths, which appear only fleetingly. Nonetheless, Deighton&#x27;s final sequence, ending in a helicopter shot of thousands of war graves is regarded as one of the most memorable moments of the film. According to Attenborough, 16,000 white crosses had to be hammered into individually dug holes due to the hardness of the soil. Although this is effective in symbolising the scale of death, the number of crosses was in fact fewer than the number of deaths in a single battle: depicting the actual number killed in the entire war would have required the scale to have been replicated more than 1000 times.

The film was shot in the summer of 1968 in Sussex, mostly in the Brighton area. Many of the extras were local people, but a great many were students from the University of Sussex, Falmer, on the outskirts of the town. The film&#x27;s locations included the West Pier (now gutted by fire and wrecked), Ditchling Beacon, Sheepcote Valley (the trench sequences), Old Bayham Abbey, near Frant (the church parade), Brighton station and Ovingdean (where thousands of crosses were erected for the classic finale).

===The song===
The song was written by J. P. Long and Maurice Scott in 1917 and was part of the repertoire of music hall star and male impersonator Ella Shields. The first verse and the chorus follow:

Two pre-musical renditions, one from 1918, can be found at Firstworldwar.com. Almost all of the songs featured in the film also appear on the CD41 album series &quot;Oh! It&#x27;s a Lovely War&quot; (four volumes).

==Release==
The film had its premiere at the Paramount Theatre on Piccadilly Circus in London on 10 April 1969 before opening to the public the following day.

==Reception==
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a big, elaborate, sometimes realistic film whose elephantine physical proportions and often brilliant all-star cast simply overwhelm the material with a surfeit of good intentions.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;dedicated, exhilarating, shrewd, mocking, funny, emotional, witty, poignant and technically brilliant.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; gave the film 4 stars out of 4, writing that it was not a movie but &quot;an elaborately staged tableau, a dazzling use of the camera to achieve essentially theatrical effects. And judged on that basis, Richard Attenborough has given us a breathtaking evening.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; also gave the film a perfect grade of 4 stars and wrote it &quot;deserves an Academy Award nomination for the best picture of the year ... You can sit back and enjoy this film on any one of many levels. The songs are good, the lyrics are biting; the staging and costuming blend with the story rather than overshadow it. The acting seems effortless.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;What noted British actor Richard Attenborough, in a dazzling directorial debut, and his principal writers Len Deighton and Brian Duffy have done is to transform the highly political and one-dimensional Joan Littlewood theatre piece into timeless—and painfully timely—tragic allegory.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;The conception is intriguing, but the film turns into an infernal, precision machine. As one big production number succeeded the other and one perfectly measured and symmetrical tableau faded into the next, I began to feel stupefied rather than touched. The physical production was rolling over the songs, the characters and the vignettes.&quot; David Wilson of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that &quot;one is simply left admiring a worthy mosaic of bits and pieces, full of good ideas but nowhere near to being a self-contained dramatic entity.&quot;

The film presently has a score of 75% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 16 reviews, with an average grade of 8.2 out of 10.

The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; received complaints from veteran organizations about the advertisement for the film that featured cemetery crosses and later ran the adverts without the image.

===Box office===
It ranked the 16th film at the UK box office in 1969.

<text>Animal welfare is the well-being of non-human animals. Formal standards of animal welfare vary between contexts, but are debated mostly by animal welfare groups, legislators, and academics. Animal welfare science uses measures such as longevity, disease, immunosuppression, behavior, physiology, and reproduction, although there is debate about which of these best indicate animal welfare.

Respect for animal welfare is often based on the belief that nonhuman animals are sentient and that consideration should be given to their well-being or suffering, especially when they are under the care of humans. These concerns can include how animals are slaughtered for food, how they are used in scientific research, how they are kept (as pets, in zoos, farms, circuses, etc.), and how human activities affect the welfare and survival of wild species.

There are two forms of criticism of the concept of animal welfare, coming from diametrically opposite positions. One view, held by some thinkers in history, holds that humans have no duties of any kind to animals. The other view is based on the animal rights position that animals should not be regarded as property and any use of animals by humans is unacceptable. Accordingly, some animal rights proponents argue that the perception of better animal welfare facilitates continued and increased exploitation of animals. Some authorities therefore treat animal welfare and animal rights as two opposing positions. Others see animal welfare gains as incremental steps towards animal rights.

The predominant view of modern neuroscientists, notwithstanding philosophical problems with the definition of consciousness even in humans, is that consciousness exists in nonhuman animals; however, some still maintain that consciousness is a philosophical question that may never be scientifically resolved. A new study has devised a unique way to dissociate conscious from nonconscious perception in animals. The researchers built experiments predicting opposite behavioral outcomes to consciously vs. non-consciously perceived stimuli. The monkeys&#x27; behaviors displayed these exact opposite signatures, just like aware and unaware humans tested in the study.

==History, principles, and practice==
Animal protection laws were enacted as early as the 1st millennium BCE in India. Several Indian kings built hospitals for animals, and emperor Ashoka (304–232 BCE) issued orders against hunting and animal slaughter, in line with &quot;ahimsa&quot;, the doctrine of non-violence. In the 13th century CE, Genghis Khan protected wildlife in Mongolia during the breeding season (March to October).

Early legislation in the Western world on behalf of animals includes the Ireland Parliament (Thomas Wentworth) &quot;An Act against Plowing by the Tayle, and pulling the Wooll off living Sheep&quot;, 1635, and the Massachusetts Colony (Nathaniel Ward) &quot;Off the Bruite Creatures&quot; Liberty 92 and 93 in the &quot;Massachusetts Body of Liberties&quot; of 1641. In the Edo period of Japan, Tokugawa Tsunayoshi (1646 - 1709) instituted several laws relating to animal welfare, particularly towards dogs, earning him the nickname of &quot;the dog Shogun&quot;.

In 1776, English clergyman Humphrey Primatt authored &quot;A Dissertation on the Duty of Mercy and Sin of Cruelty to Brute Animals&quot;, one of the first books published in support of animal welfare. Marc Bekoff said that &quot;Primatt was largely responsible for bringing animal welfare to the attention of the general public.&quot;

Since 1822, when Irish MP Richard Martin brought the &quot;Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822&quot; through Parliament offering protection from cruelty to cattle, horses, and sheep, an animal welfare movement has been active in England. Martin was among the founders of the world&#x27;s first animal welfare organization, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or SPCA, in 1824. In 1840, Queen Victoria gave the society her blessing, and it became the RSPCA. The society used members&#x27; donations to employ a growing network of inspectors, whose job was to identify abusers, gather evidence, and report them to the authorities.

In 1837, the German minister Albert Knapp founded the first German animal welfare society.

One of the first national laws to protect animals was the UK Cruelty to Animals Act 1835 followed by the Protection of Animals Act 1911. In the US it was many years until there was a national law to protect animals—the Animal Welfare Act of 1966—although there were a number of states that passed anti-cruelty laws between 1828 and 1898. In India, animals are protected by the &quot;Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960&quot;.

Significant progress in animal welfare did not take place until the late 20th century. In 1965, the UK government commissioned an investigation—led by professor Roger Brambell—into the welfare of intensively farmed animals, partly in response to concerns raised in Ruth Harrison&#x27;s 1964 book, &quot;Animal Machines&quot;. On the basis of Brambell&#x27;s report, the UK government set up the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Committee in 1967, which became the Farm Animal Welfare Council in 1979. The committee&#x27;s first guidelines recommended that animals require the freedom to &quot;stand up, lie down, turn around, groom themselves and stretch their limbs.&quot; The guidelines have since been elaborated upon to become known as the Five Freedoms.

In the UK, the Animal Welfare Act 2006 (c. 45) consolidated many different forms of animal welfare legislation.

A number of animal welfare organisations are campaigning to achieve a Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare (UDAW) at the United Nations. In principle, the Universal Declaration would call on the United Nations to recognise animals as sentient beings, capable of experiencing pain and suffering, and to recognise that animal welfare is an issue of importance as part of the social development of nations worldwide. The campaign to achieve the UDAW is being coordinated by World Animal Protection, with a core working group including Compassion in World Farming, the RSPCA, and the Humane Society International (the international branch of HSUS).

The 2019 UN Global Sustainable Development Report identified animal welfare as one of several key missing issues in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

===Animal welfare science===
Animal welfare science is an emerging field that seeks to answer questions raised by the keeping and use of animals, such as whether hens are frustrated when confined in cages, whether the psychological well-being of animals in laboratories can be maintained, and whether zoo animals are stressed by the transport required for international conservation. Ireland leads research into farm animal welfare with the recently published Research Report on Farm Animal Welfare .

===Farmed animals===

A major concern for the welfare of farmed animals is factory farming in which large numbers of animals are reared in confinement at high stocking densities. Issues include the limited opportunities for natural behaviors, for example, in battery cages, veal and gestation crates, instead producing abnormal behaviors such as tail-biting, cannibalism, and feather pecking, and routine invasive procedures such as beak trimming, castration, and ear notching.More extensive methods of farming, e.g. free range, can also raise welfare concerns such as the mulesing of sheep and predation of stock by wild animals. Biosecurity is also a risk with free range farming, as it allows for more contact between livestock and wild animal populations, which may carry zoonoses.

Farmed animals are artificially selected for production parameters which sometimes impinge on the animals&#x27; welfare. For example, broiler chickens are bred to be very large to produce the greatest quantity of meat per animal. Broilers bred for fast growth have a high incidence of leg deformities because the large breast muscles cause distortions of the developing legs and pelvis, and the birds cannot support their increased body weight. As a consequence, they frequently become lame or suffer from broken legs. The increased body weight also puts a strain on their hearts and lungs, and ascites often develop. In the UK alone, up to 20 million broilers each year die from the stress of catching and transporting before reaching the slaughterhouse. Animal welfare violations have been observed more in intensively bred chicken, pig and cattle species, respectively, and studies and laws have been enacted in this regard. However, animal welfare in semi-intensive species such as sheep and goats is nowadays being scrutinised and gaining importance.

Another concern about the welfare of farmed animals is the method of slaughter, especially ritual slaughter. While the killing of animals need not necessarily involve suffering, the general public considers that killing an animal reduces its welfare. This leads to further concerns about premature slaughtering such as chick culling by the laying hen industry, in which males are slaughtered immediately after hatching because they are superfluous; this policy occurs in other farmed animal industries such as the production of goat and cattle milk, raising the same concerns.

A 2023 report by the Animal Welfare Institute found that animal welfare claims by companies selling meat and poultry products lack adequate substantiation in roughly 85% of analyzed cases.

===Cetaceans===

Captive cetaceans are kept for display, research and naval operations. To enhance their welfare, humans feed them fish that are dead but are disease-free, protect them from predators and injury, monitor their health, and provide activities for behavioral enrichment. Some are kept in lagoons with natural soil and vegetated sides. Most are in concrete tanks which are easy to clean but echo their natural sounds back to them. They cannot develop their own social groups, and related cetaceans are typically separated for display and breeding. Military dolphins used in naval operations swim free during operations and training and return to pens otherwise. Captive cetaceans are trained to present themselves for blood samples, health exams, and noninvasive breath samples above their blow holes. Staff can monitor the captives afterward for signs of infection from the procedure.

Research on wild cetaceans leaves them free to roam and make sounds in their natural habitat, eat live fish, face predators and injury, and form social groups voluntarily. However, boat engines of researchers, whale watchers and others add substantial noise to their natural environment, reducing their ability to echolocate and communicate. Electric engines are far quieter, but are not widely used for either research or whale watching, even for maintaining position, which does not require much power. Vancouver Port offers discounts for ships with quiet propeller and hull designs. Other areas have reduced speeds. Boat engines also have unshielded propellers, which cause serious injuries to cetaceans who come close to the propeller. The US Coast Guard has proposed rules on propeller guards to protect human swimmers, but has not adopted any rules. The US Navy uses propeller guards to protect manatees in Georgia. Ducted propellers provide more efficient drive at speeds up to 10 knots, and protect animals beneath and beside them, but need grilles to prevent injuries to animals drawn into the duct. Attaching satellite trackers and obtaining biopsies to measure pollution loads and DNA involve either capture and release, or shooting the cetaceans from a distance with dart guns. A cetacean was killed by a fungal infection after being darted, due to either an incompletely sterilized dart or an infection from the ocean entering the wound caused by the dart. Researchers on wild cetaceans have not yet been able to use drones to capture noninvasive breath samples.

Other harms to wild cetaceans include commercial whaling, aboriginal whaling, drift netting, ship collisions, water pollution, noise from sonar and reflection seismology, predators, loss of prey, and disease. Efforts to enhance the life of wild cetaceans, besides reducing those harms, include offering human music. Canadian rules do not forbid playing quiet music, though they forbid &quot;noise that may resemble whale songs or calls, underwater&quot;.

===Wild animal welfare===

In addition to cetaceans, the welfare of other wild animals has also been studied, though to a lesser extent than that of animals in farms. Research in wild animal welfare has two focuses: the welfare of wild animals kept in captivity and the welfare of animals living in the wild. The former has addressed the situation of animals kept both for human use, as in zoos or circuses, or in rehabilitation centers. The latter has examined how the welfare of non-domesticated animals living in wild or urban areas are affected by humans or natural factors causing wild animal suffering.

Some of the proponents of these views have advocated carrying out conservation efforts in ways that respect the welfare of wild animals, within the framework of the disciplines of compassionate conservation and conservation welfare, while others have argued in favor of improving the welfare of wild animals for the sake of the animals, regardless of whether there are any conservation issues involved at all. The welfare economist Yew-Kwang Ng, in his 1995 &quot;Towards welfare biology: Evolutionary economics of animal consciousness and suffering&quot;, proposed welfare biology as a research field to study &quot;living things and their environment with respect to their welfare (defined as net happiness, or enjoyment minus suffering).&quot;

== Legislation ==

===European Union===

The European Commission&#x27;s activities in this area start with the recognition that animals are sentient beings. The general aim is to ensure that animals do not endure avoidable pain or suffering, and obliges the owner/keeper of animals to respect minimum welfare requirements. European Union legislation regarding farm animal welfare is regularly re-drafted according to science-based evidence and cultural views. For example, in 2009, legislation was passed which aimed to reduce animal suffering during slaughter and on 1 January 2012, the European Union Council Directive 1999/74/EC came into act, which means that conventional battery cages for laying hens are now banned across the Union.

====United Kingdom====

The Animal Welfare Act 2006 makes owners and keepers responsible for ensuring that the welfare needs of their animals are met. These include the need: for a suitable environment (place to live), for a suitable diet, to exhibit normal behavior patterns, to be housed with, or apart from, other animals (if applicable), and to be protected from pain, injury, suffering and disease.
Anyone who is cruel to an animal, or does not provide for its welfare needs, may be banned from owning animals, fined up to £20,000 and/or sent to prison for a maximum of six months.

In the UK, the welfare of research animals being used for &quot;regulated procedures&quot; was historically protected by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (ASPA) which is administrated by the Home Office. The Act defines &quot;regulated procedures&quot; as animal experiments that could potentially cause &quot;pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm&quot; to &quot;protected animals&quot;. Initially, &quot;protected animals&quot; encompassed all living vertebrates other than humans, but, in 1993, an amendment added a single invertebrate species, the common octopus.

Primates, cats, dogs, and horses have additional protection over other vertebrates under the Act. Revised legislation came into force in January 2013. This has been expanded to protect &quot;...all living vertebrates, other than man, and any living cephalopod. Fish and amphibia are protected once they can feed independently and cephalopods at the point when they hatch. Embryonic and foetal forms of mammals, birds and reptiles are protected during the last third of their gestation or incubation period.&quot; The definition of regulated procedures was also expanded: &quot;A procedure is regulated if it is carried out on a protected animal and may cause that animal a level of pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm equivalent to, or higher than, that caused by inserting a hypodermic needle according to good veterinary practice.&quot; It also includes modifying the genes of a protected animal if this causes the animal pain, suffering, distress, or lasting harm. The ASPA also considers other issues such as animal sources, housing conditions, identification methods, and the humane killing of animals.

Those applying for a license must explain why such research cannot be done through non-animal methods. The project must also pass an ethical review panel which aims to decide if the potential benefits outweigh any suffering for the animals involved.

===United States===

In the United States, a federal law called the Humane Slaughter Act was designed to decrease suffering of livestock during slaughter.

The Georgia Animal Protection Act of 1986 was a state law enacted in response to the inhumane treatment of companion animals by a pet store chain in Atlanta. The Act provided for the licensing and regulation of pet shops, stables, kennels, and animal shelters, and established, for the first time, minimum standards of care. Additional provisions, called the Humane Euthanasia Act, were added in 1990, and then further expanded and strengthened with the Animal Protection Act of 2000.

In 2002, voters passed (by a margin of 55% for and 45% against) Amendment 10 to the Florida Constitution banning the confinement of pregnant pigs in gestation crates. In 2006, Arizona voters passed Proposition 204 with 62% support; the legislation prohibits the confinement of calves in veal crates and breeding sows in gestation crates. In 2007, the Governor of Oregon signed legislation prohibiting the confinement of pigs in gestation crates and in 2008, the Governor of Colorado signed legislation that phased out both gestation crates and veal crates. Also during 2008, California passed Proposition 2, known as the &quot;Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act&quot;, which orders new space requirements for farm animals starting in 2015.
In the US, every institution that uses vertebrate animals for federally funded laboratory research must have an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Each local IACUC reviews research protocols and conducts evaluations of the institution&#x27;s animal care and use which includes the results of inspections of facilities that are required by law. The IACUC committee must assess the steps taken to &quot;enhance animal well-being&quot; before research can take place. This includes research on farm animals.

According to the National Institutes of Health Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, researchers must try to minimize distress in animals whenever possible: &quot;Animals used in research and testing may experience pain from induced diseases, procedures, and toxicity. The Public Health Service (PHS) Policy and Animal Welfare Regulations (AWRs) state that procedures that cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress should be performed with appropriate sedation, analgesia, or anesthesia.

However, research and testing studies sometimes involve pain that cannot be relieved with such agents because they would interfere with the scientific objectives of the study. Accordingly, federal regulations require that IACUCs determine that discomfort to animals will be limited to that which is unavoidable for the conduct of scientifically valuable research, and that unrelieved pain and distress will only continue for the duration necessary to accomplish the scientific objectives. The PHS Policy and AWRs further state that animals that would otherwise suffer severe or chronic pain and distress that cannot be relieved should be painlessly killed at the end of the procedure, or if appropriate, during the procedure.&quot;

The National Research Council&#x27;s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals also serves as a guide to improve welfare for animals used in research in the US. The Federation of Animal Science Societies&#x27; Guide for the Care and Use of Agricultural Animals in Research and Teaching is a resource addressing welfare concerns in farm animal research. Laboratory animals in the US are also protected under the Animal Welfare Act. The United States Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) enforces the Animal Welfare Act. APHIS inspects animal research facilities regularly and reports are published online.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the total number of animals used in the U.S. in 2005 was almost 1.2 million, but this does not include rats, mice, and birds which are not covered by welfare legislation but make up approximately 90% of research animals.

==Approaches and definitions==

There are many different approaches to describing and defining animal welfare.

Positive conditions – Providing good animal welfare is sometimes defined by a list of positive conditions which should be provided to the animal. This approach is taken by the Five Freedoms and the three principles of professor John Webster.

The Five Freedoms are:
* Freedom from thirst and hunger – by ready access to fresh water and a diet to maintain full health and vigour
* Freedom from discomfort – by providing an appropriate environment including shelter and a comfortable resting area
* Freedom from pain, injury, and disease – by prevention or rapid diagnosis and treatment
* Freedom to express most normal behavior – by providing sufficient space, proper facilities, and company of the animal&#x27;s own kind
* Freedom from fear and distress – by ensuring conditions and treatment which avoid mental suffering

John Webster defines animal welfare by advocating three positive conditions: Living a natural life, being fit and healthy, and being happy.

High production – In the past, many have seen farm animal welfare chiefly in terms of whether the animal is producing well. The argument is that an animal in poor welfare would not be producing well, however, many farmed animals will remain highly productive despite being in conditions where good welfare is almost certainly compromised, e.g., layer hens in battery cages.

Emotion in animals – Others in the field, such as professor Ian Duncan and professor Marian Dawkins, focus more on the feelings of the animal. This approach indicates the belief that animals should be considered as sentient beings. Duncan wrote, &quot;Animal welfare is to do with the feelings experienced by animals: the absence of strong negative feelings, usually called suffering, and (probably) the presence of positive feelings, usually called pleasure. In any assessment of welfare, it is these feelings that should be assessed.&quot; Dawkins wrote, &quot;Let us not mince words: Animal welfare involves the subjective feelings of animals.&quot;

Welfare biology – Yew-Kwang Ng defines animal welfare in terms of welfare economics: &quot;Welfare biology is the study of living things and their environment with respect to their welfare (defined as net happiness, or enjoyment minus suffering). Despite difficulties of ascertaining and measuring welfare and relevancy to normative issues, welfare biology is a positive science.&quot;

Dictionary definition – In the &quot;Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary&quot;, animal welfare is defined as &quot;the avoidance of abuse and exploitation of animals by humans by maintaining appropriate standards of accommodation, feeding and general care, the prevention and treatment of disease and the assurance of freedom from harassment, and unnecessary discomfort and pain.&quot;

American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) has defined animal welfare as: &quot;An animal is in a good state of welfare if (as indicated by scientific evidence) it is healthy, comfortable, well nourished, safe, able to express innate behavior, and if it is not suffering from unpleasant states such as pain, fear, and distress.&quot; They have offered the following eight principles for developing and evaluating animal welfare policies.
* The responsible use of animals for human purposes, such as companionship, food, fiber, recreation, work, education, exhibition, and research conducted for the benefit of both humans and animals, is consistent with the Veterinarian&#x27;s Oath.
* Decisions regarding animal care, use, and welfare shall be made by balancing scientific knowledge and professional judgment with consideration of ethical and societal values.
* Animals must be provided water, food, proper handling, health care, and an environment appropriate to their care and use, with thoughtful consideration for their species-typical biology and behavior.
* Animals should be cared for in ways that minimize fear, pain, stress, and suffering.
* Procedures related to animal housing, management, care, and use should be continuously evaluated, and when indicated, refined or replaced.
* Conservation and management of animal populations should be humane, socially responsible, and scientifically prudent.
* Animals shall be treated with respect and dignity throughout their lives and, when necessary, provided a humane death.
* The veterinary profession shall continually strive to improve animal health and welfare through scientific research, education, collaboration, advocacy, and the development of legislation and regulations.

Terrestrial Animal Health Code of World Organisation for Animal Health defines animal welfare as &quot;how an animal is coping with the conditions in which it lives. An animal is in a good state of welfare if (as indicated by scientific evidence) it is healthy, comfortable, well nourished, safe, able to express innate behaviour, and if it is not suffering from unpleasant states such as pain, fear, and distress. Good animal welfare requires disease prevention and veterinary treatment, appropriate shelter, management, nutrition, humane handling and humane slaughter/killing. Animal welfare refers to the state of the animal; the treatment that an animal receives is covered by other terms such as animal care, animal husbandry, and humane treatment.&quot;

Coping – Professor Donald Broom defines the welfare of an animal as &quot;Its state as regards its attempts to cope with its environment. This state includes how much it is having to do to cope, the extent to which it is succeeding in or failing to cope, and its associated feelings.&quot; He states that &quot;welfare will vary over a continuum from very good to very poor and studies of welfare will be most effective if a wide range of measures is used.&quot; John Webster criticized this definition for making &quot;no attempt to say what constitutes good or bad welfare.&quot;

==Attitudes==

Animal welfare often refers to a utilitarian attitude towards the well-being of nonhuman animals. It believes the animals can be exploited if the animal suffering and the costs of use is less than the benefits to humans. This attitude is also known simply as &quot;welfarism&quot;.

An example of welfarist thought is Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall&#x27;s meat manifesto. Point three of eight is:
Robert Garner describes the welfarist position as the most widely held in modern society. He states that one of the best attempts to clarify this position is given by philosopher Robert Nozick:

Welfarism is often contrasted with the animal rights and animal liberation positions, which hold that animals should not be used by humans and should not be regarded as human property. However, it has been argued that both welfarism and animal liberation only make sense if it is assumed that animals have &quot;subjective welfare&quot;.

===New welfarism===

New welfarism was coined by Gary L. Francione in 1996. It is a view that the best way to prevent animal suffering is to abolish the causes of animal suffering, but advancing animal welfare is a goal to pursue in the short term. Thus, for instance, new welfarists want to phase out fur farms and animal experiments but in the short-term they try to improve conditions for the animals in these systems, so they lobby to make cages less constrictive and to reduce the numbers of animals used in laboratories.

Within the context of animal research, many scientific organisations believe that improved animal welfare will provide improved scientific outcomes. If an animal in a laboratory is suffering stress or pain it could negatively affect the results of the research.

Increased affluence in many regions for the past few decades afforded consumers the disposable income to purchase products from high welfare systems. The adaptation of more economically efficient farming systems in these regions were at the expense of animal welfare and to the financial benefit of consumers, both of which were factors in driving the demand for higher welfare for farm animals. A 2006 survey concluded that a majority (63%) of EU citizens &quot;show some willingness to change their usual place of shopping in order to be able to purchase more animal welfare-friendly products.&quot;
The volume of scientific research on animal welfare has also increased significantly in some countries.

==Criticisms==

===Denial of duties to animals===

Some individuals in history have, at least in principle, rejected the view that humans have duties of any kind to animals.

Augustine of Hippo seemed to take such a position in his writings against those he saw as heretics:
&quot;For we see and hear by their cries that animals die with pain, although man disregards this in a beast, with which, as not having a rational soul, we have no community of rights.&quot;

===Animal rights===

Animal rights advocates, such as Gary L. Francione and Tom Regan, argue that the animal welfare position (advocating for the betterment of the condition of animals, but without abolishing animal use) is inconsistent in logic and ethically unacceptable. Philosopher Steven Best suggests that an emphasis on &quot;welfarism&quot; has the effect of legitimizing &quot;any human use of animals&quot; so long as humans aren&#x27;t &quot;cruel&quot; to them and do whatever is necessary to avoid inflicting &quot;unnecessary harm&quot;. Sociologist David Nibert writes that animal welfare reforms, usually implemented by wealthier countries, are often &quot;modest&quot; and &quot;mostly localized,&quot; and are vastly surpassed by the ongoing expansion of the capitalist–driven animal–industrial complex, with the number of CAFOs and the animals to fill them dramatically increasing, along with growing numbers of humans consuming animal products. However, there are some animal right groups, such as PETA, which support animal welfare measures in the short term to alleviate animal suffering until all animal use is ended.

According to PETA&#x27;s Ingrid Newkirk in an interview with &quot;Wikinews&quot;, there are two issues in animal welfare and animal rights. &quot;If I only could have one thing, it would be to end suffering&quot;, said Newkirk. &quot;If you could take things from animals and kill animals all day long without causing them suffering, then I would take it... Everybody should be able to agree that animals should not suffer if you kill them or steal from them by taking the fur off their backs or take their eggs, whatever. But you shouldn&#x27;t put them through torture to do that.&quot;

Abolitionism holds that focusing on animal welfare not only fails to challenge animal suffering, but may actually prolong it by making the exercise of property rights over animals appear less unattractive. The abolitionists&#x27; objective is to secure a moral and legal paradigm shift, whereby animals are no longer regarded as property. In recent years documentaries such as watchdominion.com have been produced, exposing the suffering occurring in animal agriculture facilities that are marketed as having high welfare standards.

==Animal welfare organizations==
===Global===

World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE): The intergovernmental organisation responsible for improving animal health worldwide. The OIE has been established &quot;for the purpose of projects of international public utility relating to the control of animal diseases, including those affecting humans and the promotion of animal welfare and animal production food safety.&quot;

World Animal Protection: Protects animals across the globe. World Animal Protection&#x27;s objectives include helping people understand the critical importance of good animal welfare, encouraging nations to commit to animal-friendly practices, and building the scientific case for the better treatment of animals. They are global in a sense that they have consultative status at the Council of Europe and collaborate with national governments, the United Nations, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Organization for Animal Health.

===Non-government organizations===
Animal Welfare Institute (AWI): An American non-profit charitable organization founded by Christine Stevens in 1951 with the goal of reducing suffering inflicted on animals by humans. It is one of the oldest animal welfare organizations in the US.

Canadian Council on Animal Care: The national organization responsible for overseeing the care and use of animals involved in Canadian Science.

Canadian Federation of Humane Societies (CFHS): The only national organization representing humane societies and SPCAs in Canada. They provide leadership on animal welfare issues and spread the message across Canada.

The Canadian Veterinary Medical Association: Brings in veterinary involvement to animal welfare. Their objective is to share this concern of animals with all members of the profession, with the general public, with government at all levels, and with other organizations such as the CFHS, which have similar concerns.

Compassion in World Farming: Founded over 40 years ago in 1967 by a British farmer who became horrified by the development of modern, intensive factory farming. &quot;Today we campaign peacefully to end all cruel factory farming practices. We believe that the biggest cause of cruelty on the planet deserves a focused, specialised approach – so we only work on farm animal welfare.&quot;

FarmKind: Raises funds for animal welfare organizations working to reform or end factory farming (specifically, The Humane League, The Good Food Institute, Sinergia Animal, Dansk Vegetarisk Forening, Fish Welfare Initiative and Shrimp Welfare Project - all of which have been recommended by Animal Charity Evaluators. They function as a donation guide for those seeking to help animals as much as possible with their donations.

The Movement for Compassionate Living: Exists to-
&quot;Promote simple vegan living and self-reliance as a remedy against the exploitation of humans, animals and the Earth.
Promote the use of trees and vegan-organic farming to meet the needs of society for food and natural resources.
Promote a land-based society where as much of our food and resources as possible are produced locally.&quot;

National Animal Interest Alliance: An animal welfare organization in the United States founded in 1991 promotes the welfare of animals, strengthens the human-animal bond, and safeguards the rights of responsible animal owners, enthusiasts and professionals through research, public information and sound public policy. They host an online library of information about various animal-related subjects serving as a resource for groups and individuals dedicated to responsible animal care and well-being.

National Farm Animal Care Council: Their objectives are to facilitate collaboration among members with respect to farm animal care issues in Canada, to facilitate information sharing and communication, and to monitor trends and initiatives in both the domestic and international market place.

National Office of Animal Health: A British organisation that represents its members drawn from the animal medicines industry.

Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals: A registered charity comprising over 50 communities.

Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals: A well-known animal welfare charity in England and Wales, founded in 1824.

Universities Federation for Animal Welfare: A UK registered charity, established in 1926, that works to develop and promote improvements in the welfare of all animals through scientific and educational activity worldwide.

<text>In abstract algebra, a splitting field of a polynomial with coefficients in a field is the smallest field extension of that field over which the polynomial &quot;splits&quot;, i.e., decomposes into linear factors.

==Definition==
A splitting field of a polynomial &quot;p&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) over a field &quot;K&quot; is a field extension &quot;L&quot; of &quot;K&quot; over which &quot;p&quot; factors into linear factors

:formula_1 

where formula_2 and for each formula_3 we have formula_4 with &quot;ai&quot; not necessarily distinct and such that the roots &quot;ai&quot; generate &quot;L&quot; over &quot;K&quot;. The extension &quot;L&quot; is then an extension of minimal degree over &quot;K&quot; in which &quot;p&quot; splits. It can be shown that such splitting fields exist and are unique up to isomorphism. The amount of freedom in that isomorphism is known as the Galois group of &quot;p&quot; (if we assume it is separable).

A splitting field of a set &quot;P&quot; of polynomials is the smallest field over which each of the polynomials in &quot;P&quot; splits.

==Properties==
An extension &quot;L&quot; that is a splitting field for a set of polynomials &quot;p&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) over &quot;K&quot; is called a normal extension of &quot;K&quot;.

Given an algebraically closed field &quot;A&quot; containing &quot;K&quot;, there is a unique splitting field &quot;L&quot; of &quot;p&quot; between &quot;K&quot; and &quot;A&quot;, generated by the roots of &quot;p&quot;. If &quot;K&quot; is a subfield of the complex numbers, the existence is immediate. On the other hand, the existence of algebraic closures in general is often proved by &#x27;passing to the limit&#x27; from the splitting field result, which therefore requires an independent proof to avoid circular reasoning.

Given a separable extension &quot;K&quot;′ of &quot;K&quot;, a Galois closure &quot;L&quot; of &quot;K&quot;′ is a type of splitting field, and also a Galois extension of &quot;K&quot; containing &quot;K&quot;′ that is minimal, in an obvious sense. Such a Galois closure should contain a splitting field for all the polynomials &quot;p&quot; over &quot;K&quot; that are minimal polynomials over &quot;K&quot; of elements of &quot;K&quot;′.

==Constructing splitting fields==
===Motivation===
Finding roots of polynomials has been an important problem since the time of the ancient Greeks. Some polynomials, however, such as over , the real numbers, have no roots. By constructing the splitting field for such a polynomial one can find the roots of the polynomial in the new field.

===The construction===
Let &quot;F&quot; be a field and &quot;p&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) be a polynomial in the polynomial ring &quot;F&quot;[&quot;X&quot;] of degree &quot;n&quot;. The general process for constructing &quot;K&quot;, the splitting field of &quot;p&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) over &quot;F&quot;, is to construct a chain of fields formula_5 such that &quot;Ki&quot; is an extension of &quot;K&quot;&quot;i&quot;&amp;hairsp;−1 containing a new root of &quot;p&quot;(&quot;X&quot;). Since &quot;p&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) has at most &quot;n&quot; roots the construction will require at most &quot;n&quot; extensions. The steps for constructing &quot;Ki&quot; are given as follows:
* Factorize &quot;p&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) over &quot;Ki&quot; into irreducible factors formula_6.
* Choose any nonlinear irreducible factor &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;).
* Construct the field extension &quot;K&quot;&quot;i&quot;&amp;hairsp;+1 of &quot;Ki&quot; as the quotient ring &quot;K&quot;&quot;i&quot;&amp;hairsp;+1 = &quot;K&quot;&quot;i&quot;&amp;hairsp;[&quot;X&quot;] / (&quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)) where (&quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)) denotes the ideal in &quot;K&quot;&quot;i&quot;&amp;hairsp;[&quot;X&quot;] generated by &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;).
* Repeat the process for &quot;K&quot;&quot;i&quot;&amp;hairsp;+1 until &quot;p&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) completely factors.

The irreducible factor &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) used in the quotient construction may be chosen arbitrarily. Although different choices of factors may lead to different subfield sequences, the resulting splitting fields will be isomorphic.

Since &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is irreducible, (&quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)) is a maximal ideal of &quot;K&quot;&quot;i&quot;&amp;hairsp;[&quot;X&quot;] and &quot;K&quot;&quot;i&quot;&amp;hairsp;[&quot;X&quot;] / (&quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)) is, in fact, a field, the residue field for that maximal ideal. Moreover, if we let formula_7 be the natural projection of the ring onto its quotient then
:formula_8
so &quot;π&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is a root of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) and of &quot;p&quot;(&quot;X&quot;).

The degree of a single extension formula_9 is equal to the degree of the irreducible factor &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;). The degree of the extension [&quot;K&quot; : &quot;F&quot;] is given by formula_10 and is at most &quot;n&quot;!.

=== The field &quot;K&quot;&quot;i&quot;&amp;hairsp;[&quot;X&quot;]/(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)) ===
As mentioned above, the quotient ring &quot;K&quot;&quot;i&quot;&amp;hairsp;+1 = &quot;K&quot;&quot;i&quot;&amp;hairsp;[&quot;X&quot;]/(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)) is a field when &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is irreducible. Its elements are of the form

:formula_11

where the &quot;cj&quot; are in &quot;Ki&quot; and &quot;α&quot; = &quot;π&quot;(&quot;X&quot;). (If one considers &quot;K&quot;&quot;i&quot;&amp;hairsp;+1 as a vector space over &quot;Ki&quot; then the powers &quot;α&quot; &quot;j&quot; for form a basis.)

The elements of &quot;K&quot;&quot;i&quot;&amp;hairsp;+1 can be considered as polynomials in &quot;α&quot; of degree less than &quot;n&quot;. Addition in &quot;K&quot;&quot;i&quot;&amp;hairsp;+1 is given by the rules for polynomial addition, and multiplication is given by polynomial multiplication modulo &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;). That is, for &quot;g&quot;(&quot;α&quot;) and &quot;h&quot;(&quot;α&quot;) in &quot;K&quot;&quot;i&quot;&amp;hairsp;+1 their product is &quot;g&quot;(&quot;α&quot;)&quot;h&quot;(&quot;α&quot;) = &quot;r&quot;(α) where &quot;r&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is the remainder of &quot;g&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)&quot;h&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) when divided by &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) in &quot;K&quot;&quot;i&quot;&amp;hairsp;[&quot;X&quot;].

The remainder &quot;r&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) can be computed through polynomial long division; however there is also a straightforward reduction rule that can be used to compute &quot;r&quot;(&quot;α&quot;) = &quot;g&quot;(&quot;α&quot;)&quot;h&quot;(&quot;α&quot;) directly. First let

:formula_12

The polynomial is over a field so one can take &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) to be monic without loss of generality. Now &quot;α&quot; is a root of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;), so

:formula_13

If the product &quot;g&quot;(&quot;α&quot;)&quot;h&quot;(&quot;α&quot;) has a term &quot;α&quot;&quot;m&quot; with it can be reduced as follows:

:formula_14.

As an example of the reduction rule, take &quot;Ki&quot; = Q[&quot;X&quot;], the ring of polynomials with rational coefficients, and take &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) = &quot;X&quot; 7 − 2. Let formula_15 and &quot;h&quot;(&quot;α&quot;) = &quot;α&quot;&amp;hairsp;3 +1 be two elements of Q[&quot;X&quot;]/(&quot;X&quot; 7 − 2). The reduction rule given by &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is &quot;α&quot;7 = 2 so

==Examples==
=== The complex numbers ===
Consider the polynomial ring R[&quot;x&quot;], and the irreducible polynomial The quotient ring is given by the congruence As a result, the elements (or equivalence classes) of are of the form where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; belong to R. To see this, note that since it follows that , , , etc.; and so, for example 

The addition and multiplication operations are given by firstly using ordinary polynomial addition and multiplication, but then reducing modulo , i.e. using the fact that , , , , etc. Thus:
:formula_17
:formula_18
If we identify with (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) then we see that addition and multiplication are given by
:formula_19
:formula_20

We claim that, as a field, the quotient ring is isomorphic to the complex numbers, C. A general complex number is of the form , where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are real numbers and Addition and multiplication are given by

:formula_21
:formula_22

If we identify with (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) then we see that addition and multiplication are given by

:formula_23
:formula_24

The previous calculations show that addition and multiplication behave the same way in and C. In fact, we see that the map between and C given by is a homomorphism with respect to addition &quot;and&quot; multiplication. It is also obvious that the map is both injective and surjective; meaning that is a bijective homomorphism, i.e., an isomorphism. It follows that, as claimed: 

In 1847, Cauchy used this approach to &quot;define&quot; the complex numbers.

=== Cubic example ===
Let be the rational number field and . Each root of equals times a cube root of unity. Therefore, if we denote the cube roots of unity by

:formula_25 
:formula_26
:formula_27

any field containing two distinct roots of will contain the quotient between two distinct cube roots of unity. Such a quotient is a primitive cube root of unity—either formula_28 or formula_29. It follows that a splitting field of will contain &quot;ω&quot;2, as well as the real cube root of 2; conversely, any extension of containing these elements contains all the roots of . Thus

:formula_30

Note that applying the construction process outlined in the previous section to this example, one begins with formula_31 and constructs the field formula_32. This field is not the splitting field, but contains one (any) root. However, the polynomial formula_33 is not irreducible over formula_34 and in fact:

:formula_35

Note that formula_36 is not an indeterminate, and is in fact an element of formula_34. Now, continuing the process, we obtain formula_38, which is indeed the splitting field and is spanned by the formula_39-basis formula_40. Notice that if we compare this with formula_41 from above we can identify formula_42 and formula_43.

===Other examples===
* The splitting field of &quot;xq&quot; − &quot;x&quot; over F&quot;p&quot; is the unique finite field F&quot;q&quot; for &quot;q&quot; = &quot;pn&quot;. Sometimes this field is denoted by GF(&quot;q&quot;).

* The splitting field of &quot;x&quot;2 + 1 over F7 is F49; the polynomial has no roots in F7, i.e., −1 is not a square there, because 7 is not congruent to 1 modulo 4.

* The splitting field of &quot;x&quot;2 − 1 over F7 is F7 since &quot;x&quot;2 − 1 = (&quot;x&quot; + 1)(&quot;x&quot; − 1) already splits into linear factors.

* We calculate the splitting field of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;3 + &quot;x&quot; + 1 over F2. It is easy to verify that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) has no roots in F2; hence &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is irreducible in F2[&quot;x&quot;]. Put &quot;r&quot; = &quot;x&quot; + (&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) in F2[&quot;x&quot;]/(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) so F2(&quot;r&quot;&amp;hairsp;) is a field and &quot;x&quot;3 + &quot;x&quot; + 1 = (&quot;x&quot; + &quot;r&quot;)(&quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;ax&quot; + &quot;b&quot;) in F2(&quot;r&quot;&amp;hairsp;)[&quot;x&quot;]. Note that we can write + for − since the characteristic is two. Comparing coefficients shows that &quot;a&quot; = &quot;r&quot; and &quot;b&quot; = 1 + &quot;r&quot; 2. The elements of F2(&quot;r&quot;&amp;hairsp;) can be listed as &quot;c&quot; + &quot;dr&quot; + &quot;er&quot; 2, where &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot; are in F2. There are eight elements: 0, 1, &quot;r&quot;, 1 + &quot;r&quot;, &quot;r&quot; 2, 1 + &quot;r&quot; 2, &quot;r&quot; + &quot;r&quot; 2 and 1 + &quot;r&quot; + &quot;r&quot; 2. Substituting these in &quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;rx&quot; + 1 + &quot;r&quot; 2 we reach (&quot;r&quot; 2)2 + &quot;r&quot;(&quot;r&quot; 2) + 1 + &quot;r&quot; 2 = &quot;r&quot; 4 + &quot;r&quot; 3 + 1 + &quot;r&quot; 2 = 0, therefore &quot;x&quot;3 + &quot;x&quot; + 1 = (&quot;x&quot; + &quot;r&quot;)(&quot;x&quot; + &quot;r&quot; 2)(&quot;x&quot; + (&quot;r&quot; + &quot;r&quot; 2)) for &quot;r&quot; in F2[&quot;x&quot;]/(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)); &quot;E&quot; = F2(&quot;r&quot;&amp;hairsp;) is a splitting field of &quot;x&quot;3 + &quot;x&quot; + 1 over F2.

<text>Drygalski Island is an ice-capped island that is long and rises to in the Davis Sea of the Southern Ocean, about north of the coast of Queen Mary Land and north-northeast of Cape Filchner. The island has an area of .

Drygalski Island was first viewed from the continental Antarctic coast in November 1912 by members of the Western Base Party of the Australian Antarctic Expedition (1911-1914), and observed more closely from Sir Douglas Mawson&#x27;s ship Aurora on the homeward journey in January 1914. Because Drygalski Island was thought to be &quot;Drygalski&#x27;s High Land&quot;, charted by Professor Erich von Drygalski of the German Antarctic Expedition (1901-1903) in 1902, Drygalski&#x27;s name was given by Sir Douglas Mawson to the island.

A temporary field station named Mir was opened from 20 May to 6 August in 1960 on the island by the Soviet Union to study meteorological conditions.

<doc id="174443" wikidata="Q721135" url="?curid=174443" title="Azazel">
<text>In the Hebrew Bible, the name Azazel (; &quot;ʿĂzāʾzēl&quot;) represents a desolate place where a scapegoat bearing the sins of the Jews was sent during Yom Kippur. During the late Second Temple period (after the closure of the Hebrew Bible canon), Azazel came to be viewed as a fallen angel responsible for introducing humans to forbidden knowledge, as described in the Book of Enoch. His role as a fallen angel partly remains in Christian and Islamic traditions.

==Bible==
===Torah===
In the Hebrew Bible, the term is used three times in the Book of Leviticus, where two male goats were to be sacrificed to Yahweh and one of the two was selected by lot, for Yahweh is seen as speaking through the lots. One goat is selected by lot and sent into the wilderness , &quot;for Azazel&quot;. This goat was then cast out in the desert as part of Yom Kippur. The scapegoat ritual can be traced back to 24th century BC Ebla, from where it spread throughout the ancient Near East.

In older English versions, such as the King James Version, the phrase &quot;la-azazel&quot; is translated as &quot;as a scapegoat&quot;; however, in most modern English Bible translations, it is represented as a name in the text:
A baraita, apparently interpreting &quot;ʿazazel&quot; as &quot;ʿaz&quot; (rugged) + &quot;El&quot; (God), understands it to refer to the rugged and rough mountain cliff from which the goat was cast down.

Wilhelm Gesenius translated the name as something akin to &quot;the averter&quot;, which he supposed to have first referred to an idol, before being lent to a demon in the Enochian texts. However, neither this demon nor the root are attested.

===In the Septuagint and later translations===
The translators of the Greek Septuagint understood the Hebrew term as meaning &quot;the sent away&quot; (apparently reading either &quot;goat that leaves&quot; or &quot;the mighty sent&quot; or v.s.), and read: 
Following the Septuagint, the Vulgate, Martin Luther and the King James Version also give readings such as Young&#x27;s Literal Translation: &quot;And Aaron hath given lots over the two goats, one lot for Jehovah, and one lot for a goat of departure&#x27;&quot;.

According to the Peshitta, Azazel is rendered Za-za-e&#x27;il &quot;strong one against/of God&quot; in Syriac. &quot;Pesher on the Periods A-B&quot; (4Q180) reads, &quot;on Azazel (some read &quot;Uzael&quot;) and the angels&quot;. If the name is in fact Azazel&#x27;s, it is spelled , equivalent to the Peshitta&#x27;s version. The Targum Neofiti reads , without the aleph.

==In Judaism==
===Rabbinical Judaism===

The Mishnah (Yoma 39a) follows the Hebrew Bible text; two goats were procured, similar in respect of appearance, height, cost, and time of selection. Having one of these on his right and the other on his left, the high priest, who was assisted in this rite by two subordinates, put both his hands into a wooden case, and took out two labels, one inscribed &quot;for Yahweh&quot; and the other &quot;for Azazel&quot;. The high priest then laid his hands with the labels upon the two goats and said, &quot;A sin-offering to Yahweh&quot; (thus speaking the Tetragrammaton); and the two men accompanying him replied, &quot;Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever.&quot; He then fastened a scarlet woolen thread to the head of the goat &quot;for Azazel&quot;; and laying his hands upon it again, recited the following confession of sin and prayer for forgiveness: &quot;O Lord, I have acted iniquitously, trespassed, sinned before Thee: I, my household, and the sons of Aaron Thy holy ones. O Lord, forgive the iniquities, transgressions, and sins that I, my household, and Aaron&#x27;s children, Thy holy people, committed before Thee, as is written in the law of Moses, Thy servant, &#x27;for on this day He will forgive you, to cleanse you from all your sins before the Lord; ye shall be clean.&#x27;&quot;

This prayer was responded to by the congregation present. A man was selected, preferably a priest, to take the goat to the precipice in the wilderness; and he was accompanied part of the way by the most eminent men of Jerusalem. Ten booths had been constructed at intervals along the road leading from Jerusalem to the steep mountain. At each one of these the man leading the goat was formally offered food and drink, which he, however, refused. When he reached the tenth booth those who accompanied him proceeded no further, but watched the ceremony from a distance. When he came to the precipice he divided the scarlet thread into two parts, one of which he tied to the rock and the other to the goat&#x27;s horns, and then pushed the goat down (Yoma 6:1–8). The cliff was so high and rugged that before the goat had traversed half the distance to the plain below, its limbs were utterly shattered. Men were stationed at intervals along the way, and as soon as the goat was thrown down the precipice, they signaled to one another by means of kerchiefs or flags, until the information reached the high priest, whereat he proceeded with the other parts of the ritual.

The scarlet thread is symbolically referenced in ; and the Talmud states (ib. 39a) that during the forty years that Simeon the Just was High Priest of Israel, the thread actually turned white as soon as the goat was thrown over the precipice: a sign that the sins of the people were forgiven. In later times the change to white was not invariable: a proof of the people&#x27;s moral and spiritual deterioration, that was gradually on the increase, until forty years before the destruction of the Second Temple, when the change of color was no longer observed (l.c. 39b).

====Medieval Jewish commentators====
The medieval scholar Nachmanides (1194–1270) identified the Hebrew text as also referring to a demon, and identified this &quot;Azazel&quot; with Samael. However, he did not see the sending of the goat as honoring Azazel as a deity, but as a symbolic expression of the idea that the people&#x27;s sins and their evil consequences were to be sent back to the spirit of desolation and ruin, the source of all impurity. The very fact that the two goats were presented before God, before the one was sacrificed and the other sent into the wilderness, was proof that Azazel was not ranked alongside God, but regarded simply as the personification of wickedness in contrast with the righteous government of God.

Maimonides (1134–1204) says that as sins cannot be taken off one&#x27;s head and transferred elsewhere, the ritual is symbolic, enabling the penitent to discard his sins: “These ceremonies are of a symbolic character and serve to impress man with a certain idea and to lead him to repent, as if to say, ‘We have freed ourselves of our previous deeds, cast them behind our backs and removed them from us as far as possible’.”

The rite, resembling, on one hand, the sending off of the basket with the woman embodying wickedness to the land of Shinar in the vision of Zechariah (), and, on the other, the letting loose of the living bird into the open field in the case of the leper healed from the plague (), was, indeed, viewed by the people of Jerusalem as a means of ridding themselves of the sins of the year. So would the crowd, called Babylonians or Alexandrians, pull the goat&#x27;s hair to make it hasten forth, carrying the burden of sins away with it (Yoma vi. 4, 66b; &quot;Epistle of Barnabas,&quot; vii.), and the arrival of the shattered animal at the bottom of the valley of the rock of Bet Ḥadudo, twelve miles away from the city, was signalized by the waving of shawls to the people of Jerusalem, who celebrated the event with boisterous hilarity and amid dancing on the hills (Yoma vi. 6, 8; Ta&#x27;an. iv. 8). Evidently the figure of Azazel was an object of general fear and awe rather than, as has been conjectured, a foreign product or the invention of a late lawgiver. More as a demon of the desert, it seems to have been closely interwoven with the mountainous region of Jerusalem.

==In Christianity==
===Latin Bible===

The Vulgate contains no mention of &quot;Azazel&quot; but only of caper emissarius, or &quot;emissary goat&quot;, apparently reading עז אזל &quot;goat which leaves&quot;:

English versions, such as the King James Version, followed the Septuagint and Vulgate in understanding the term as relating to a goat. The modern English Standard Version provides the footnote &quot;16:8 The meaning of Azazel is uncertain; possibly the name of a place or a demon, traditionally a scapegoat; also verses 10, 26&quot;. Most scholars accept the indication of some kind of demon or deity, however Judit M. Blair notes that this is an argument without supporting contemporary text evidence.

Ida Zatelli (1998) has suggested that the Hebrew ritual parallels pagan practice of sending a scapegoat into the desert on the occasion of a royal wedding found in two ritual texts in archives at Ebla (24th C. BC). A she-goat with a silver bracelet hung from her neck was driven forth into the wasteland of &#x27;Alini&#x27; by the community. There is no mention of an &quot;Azazel&quot;.

According to &quot;The Expositor&#x27;s Bible Commentary&quot;, Azazel is the Hebrew word for scapegoat. This is the only place that the Hebrew word is found in the whole Hebrew Old Testament. It says that the Book of Enoch, (extra-biblical Jewish theological literature, dated around 200 B.C.) is full of demonology and reference to fallen angels. The EBC (Vol 2) says that this text uses late Aramaic forms for these names which indicates that The Book of Enoch most likely relies upon the Hebrew Leviticus text rather than the Leviticus text being reliant upon the Book of Enoch.

===Christian commentators===
Origen (&quot;Contra Celsum,&quot; vi. 43) identifies Azazel with Satan.

==In Mandaeism==
Azazel is occasionally mentioned as &quot;Azaziʿil&quot; in Mandaean texts. In the &quot;Right Ginza&quot;, Azaziʿil is the name of an uthra (celestial being or angel).

==In Islam==

In Islam, Azazel appears in relation to the story of Harut and Marut, a pair of angels mentioned in the Quran. Although not explained by the Quran itself, Muslim exegetes such as Hisham ibn al-Kalbi and Abu Ishaq al-Tha&#x27;labi usually linked the reason of their abode to a narration related to the Watchers known from 3 Enoch. Just as in 3 Enoch, angels complained about humans iniquity, whereupon God offered a test, that the angels might choose three among them to descend to earth, endowed with bodily desires, and prove that they would do better than humans under the same conditions. Accordingly, they choose Aza, Azzaya and Azazel. However, Azazel repented his decision and God allowed him to turn back to heaven. The other two angels failed the test and their names were changed to Harut and Marut. They ended up on earth, introducing men to illicit magic.

==Biblical Apocrypha==
In the first book of Enoch, Azazel is portrayed as one of the two hundred angels who, after descending to Earth in lust for human women, resided on Mount Hermon and fathered the giants, sometimes identified with Nephilim, prior to the Flood. Afterwards he corrupted humanity- by the reckoning of the author- by teaching men the art of crafting metal weapons and armour and women the means of beautifying themselves with hair dyes, face paints, and other cosmetics. His defeat came at the hand of Raphael who, on God&#x27;s command, chained him to jagged rocks where he was to remain until the Day of Judgement.

===Enochic literature===

In the Dead Sea Scrolls, the name Azazel occurs in the line 6 of 4Q203, &quot;The Book of Giants&quot;, which is a part of the Enochic literature found at Qumran. Despite the expectation of Brandt (1889) to date no evidence has surfaced of Azazel as a demon or god prior to the earliest Jewish sources among the Dead Sea Scrolls.

The Book of Enoch brings Azazel into connection with the Biblical story of the fall of the angels, located on Mount Hermon, a gathering-place of the demons of old. Here, Azazel is one of the leaders of the rebellious Watchers in the time preceding the Flood; he taught men the art of warfare, of making swords, knives, shields, and coats of mail, and taught women the art of deception by ornamenting the body, dyeing the hair, and painting the face and the eyebrows, and also revealed to the people the secrets of witchcraft and corrupted their manners, leading them into wickedness and impurity until at last he was, at Yahweh&#x27;s command, bound hand and foot by the archangel Raphael and chained to the rough and jagged rocks of [Ha] Dudael (= Beth Ḥadudo), where he is to abide in utter darkness until the great Day of Judgment, when he will be cast into the fire to be consumed forever.
According to the Book of Enoch, Azazel (here spelled &quot;‘ăzā’zyēl&quot;) was one of the chief Grigori, a group of fallen angels who married women. Many believe that this same story (without any mention of Azazel) is told in the Book of Genesis 6:2–4:

These &quot;sons of God&quot; have often been thought of as fallen angels, and are sometimes equated with the Nephilim. (On the other hand, it has also been argued that the phrase refers only to pious men, or else that it should be translated &quot;sons of the rulers&quot;.)

In the Book of Enoch, Azazel is responsible for teaching people to make weapons and cosmetics, for which he was cast out of heaven. The Book of Enoch 8:1–3a reads, &quot;And Azazel taught men to make swords and knives and shields and breastplates; and made known to them the metals [of the earth] and the art of working them; and bracelets and ornaments; and the use of antimony and the beautifying of the eyelids; and all kinds of costly stones and all colouring tinctures. And there arose much godlessness, and they committed fornication, and they were led astray and became corrupt in all their ways.&quot; The corruption brought on by Azazel and the Grigori degrades the human race, and the four archangels (Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel) “saw much blood being shed upon the earth and all lawlessness being wrought upon the earth […] The souls of men [made] their suit, saying, &quot;Bring our cause before the Most High; […] Thou seest what Azazel hath done, who hath taught all unrighteousness on earth and revealed the eternal secrets which were in heaven, which men were striving to learn.&quot; God sees the sin brought about by Azazel and has Raphael “bind Azazel hand and foot and cast him into the darkness: and make an opening in the desert – which is in Dudael – and cast him therein. And place upon him rough and jagged rocks, and cover him with darkness, and let him abide there forever, and cover his face that he may not see light.” Azazel&#x27;s fate is foretold near the end of Enoch 2:8, where God says, “On the day of the great judgement he shall be cast into the fire.” He will be delivered to the angels of punishments (Satan).

Several scholars have previously discerned that some details of Azazel&#x27;s punishment are reminiscent of the scapegoat rite. Thus, Lester Grabbe points to a number of parallels between the Azazel narrative in Enoch and the wording of Leviticus 16, including &quot;the similarity of the names Asael and Azazel; the punishment in the desert; the placing of sin on Asael/Azazel; the resultant healing of the land.&quot; Daniel Stökl also observes that &quot;the punishment of the demon resembles the treatment of the goat in aspects of geography, action, time and purpose.&quot; Thus, the place of Asael&#x27;s punishment designated in Enoch as Dudael is reminiscent of the rabbinic terminology used for the designation of the ravine of the scapegoat in later rabbinic interpretations of the Yom Kippur ritual. Stökl remarks that &quot;the name of place of judgment (&quot;Dudael&quot;) is conspicuously similar in both traditions and can likely be traced to a common origin.&quot;

Azazel in 1 Enoch has been compared to Greek Titan Prometheus. He might be a demonized counterpart of a heavenly creature, who provided knowledge for people to make weapons, thus causing bloodshed and injustice. The latter might be identified with Greek kings and generals, who suppressed the Jews with military forces, but learned how to make their weapons by this specific expelled creature.

In the fifth-century 3 Enoch, Azazel is one of the three angels (Azza [Shemhazai] and Uzza [Ouza] are the other two) who opposed Enoch&#x27;s high rank when he became the angel Metatron. Whilst they were fallen at this time they were still in Heaven, but Metatron held a dislike for them, and had them cast out.

===In the Apocalypse of Abraham===
In the extra-canonical text the Apocalypse of Abraham (c.1st CE), Azazel appears as an unclean bird who came down upon the sacrifice which Abraham prepared. (This is in reference to Genesis 15:11: &quot;Birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away&quot; [NIV]).

The text also associates Azazel with the serpent and hell. In Chapter 23, verse 7, it is described as having seven heads, 14 faces, &quot;hands and feet like a man&#x27;s [and] on his back six wings on the right and six on the left.&quot;

Abraham says that the wicked will &quot;putrefy in the belly of the crafty worm Azazel, and be burned by the fire of Azazel&#x27;s tongue&quot; (Abr. 31:5), and earlier says to Azazel himself, &quot;May you be the firebrand of the furnace of the earth! Go, Azazel, into the untrodden parts of the earth. For your heritage is over those who are with you&quot; (Abr. 14:5–6).

Here there is the idea that God&#x27;s heritage (the created world) is largely under the dominion of evil – i.e., it is &quot;shared with Azazel&quot; (Abr. 20:5), again identifying him with the devil, who was called &quot;the prince of this world&quot; by Jesus. ( niv)

<text>Tomme de Savoie is an upland variety of Tomme cheese, specifically, one from Savoy in the French Alps. It is a mild, semi-firm cow&#x27;s milk cheese with a beige interior and a thick brownish-grey rind. Tomme de Savoie dates back to ancient history.

Tomme de Savoie, like most Tommes, is usually made from the skimmed milk left over after the cream is used to make butter or richer cheeses. As a result, the cheese has a relatively low fat content (between 20 and 45%). The cheese is made year-round, and typically has a slightly different character depending on whether the cows are fed on winter hay or summer grass.

The cheese normally comes in discs approximately across, in thickness, and weighing between . It is first pressed, and then matured for several months in a traditional cellar, producing the characteristically thick rind and flavor.

Going in the other direction, a Galois extension is called solvable if its Galois group is solvable, i.e., if the group can be decomposed into a series of normal extensions of an abelian group. Every finite extension of a finite field is a cyclic extension.

==Description==
Class field theory provides detailed information about the abelian extensions of number fields, function fields of algebraic curves over finite fields, and local fields.

There are two slightly different definitions of the term cyclotomic extension. It can mean either an extension formed by adjoining roots of unity to a field, or a subextension of such an extension. The cyclotomic fields are examples. A cyclotomic extension, under either definition, is always abelian.

If a field &quot;K&quot; contains a primitive &quot;n&quot;-th root of unity and the &quot;n&quot;-th root of an element of &quot;K&quot; is adjoined, the resulting Kummer extension is an abelian extension (if &quot;K&quot; has characteristic &quot;p&quot; we should say that &quot;p&quot; doesn&#x27;t divide &quot;n&quot;, since otherwise this can fail even to be a separable extension). In general, however, the Galois groups of &quot;n&quot;-th roots of elements operate both on the &quot;n&quot;-th roots and on the roots of unity, giving a non-abelian Galois group as semi-direct product. The Kummer theory gives a complete description of the abelian extension case, and the Kronecker–Weber theorem tells us that if &quot;K&quot; is the field of rational numbers, an extension is abelian if and only if it is a subfield of a field obtained by adjoining a root of unity.

There is an important analogy with the fundamental group in topology, which classifies all covering spaces of a space: abelian covers are classified by its abelianisation which relates directly to the first homology group.

<text>John Gilbert Layton (July 18, 1950 – August 22, 2011) was a Canadian academic and politician who served as the leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP) from 2003 to 2011 and leader of the Official Opposition in 2011. He previously sat on Toronto City Council, occasionally holding the title of acting mayor or deputy mayor of Toronto during his tenure as city councillor. Layton was the member of Parliament (MP) for Toronto—Danforth from 2004 until his death.

The son of a Progressive Conservative cabinet minister, Layton was raised in Hudson, Quebec. He rose to prominence in Toronto municipal politics, where he was one of the most prominent left-wing voices on the city and Metropolitan Toronto councils, championing many progressive causes. In 1991, he ran for mayor, losing to June Rowlands. Returning to council, he rose to become head of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. In 2003, he was elected leader of the NDP on the first ballot of the convention.

Under his leadership, support for the NDP increased in each election. The party&#x27;s popular vote almost doubled in the 2004 election, which gave the NDP the balance of power in Paul Martin&#x27;s minority government. In May 2005, the NDP supported the Liberal budget in exchange for major amendments, in what was promoted as Canada&#x27;s &quot;first NDP budget&quot;. In November of that year, Layton voted with other opposition parties to defeat the Liberal government over the findings of the Gomery Commission. The NDP saw further gains in the 2006 and 2008 elections, in which the party elected 29 and 37 MPs, respectively.

In the 2011 election, Layton led the NDP to the most successful result in the party&#x27;s history, winning 103 seats—enough for the party to form the Official Opposition for the first time. Federal support for Layton and the NDP in the election was unprecedented, especially in the province of Quebec, where the party won 59 out of 75 seats.

Layton died on August 22, 2011, after being diagnosed with cancer. His wife of 23 years, Olivia Chow, was elected mayor of Toronto in 2023. Details of the type and spread of the cancer, and the exact cause of death, were not released to the public. Shortly before he died, Layton had nominated Nycole Turmel as interim leader of the NDP and, consequently, of the Official Opposition. Tom Mulcair won the NDP leadership contest to replace Layton.

==Early life and career==
John Gilbert Layton was born on July 18, 1950 in Montreal, Quebec, to parents Doris Elizabeth (), and Progressive Conservative MP Robert Layton. He was the maternal great-grandnephew of William Steeves, a Father of Confederation, and his grandfather, Gilbert Layton, had served as a minister without portfolio to the government of Quebec&#x27;s Union Nationale under Premier Maurice Duplessis. Layton was raised in Hudson, a largely Anglophone suburb of Montreal, where he served as the student council president of Hudson High School. He would later credit longtime friend and musician Billy Bryans for having played a role in his student council victory. In his graduating yearbook, Layton wrote as a testament, &quot;I leave to become prime minister.&quot;

In 1969, he was appointed as the Quebec Youth Parliament prime minister, holding this position until 1970. That same year, Layton graduated from McGill University with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) with honours in political science and economics, and was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. During his time spent at McGill, Layton&#x27;s view on politics had been greatly influenced by professor, philosopher and mentor Charles Taylor, so much so that he decided to switch his major from science to arts. Moreover, it was on Taylor&#x27;s advice that he pursued his doctorate at the University of Toronto to study under political philosopher C. B. Macpherson. Layton followed pacifism and participated in anti-Vietnam War demonstrations.

In a foreword Layton wrote for &quot;Canadian Idealism and the Philosophy of Freedom&quot;, he explains, &quot;The idealist current holds that human society has the potential to achieve liberty when people work together to form a society in which equality means more than negative liberty, the absolute and protected right to run races against each other to determine winners. Idealists imagine a positive liberty that enables us to build together toward common objectives that fulfil and even surpass our individual goals.&quot; Upon reading &quot;Canadian Idealism and the Philosophy of Freedom&quot;, Layton came to understand himself as part of the intellectual tradition of Canadian idealists.

In 1970, Layton joined the New Democratic Party, and would later cite his influence being from Tommy Douglas voicing opposition to the imposition of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; during the 1970 October Crisis. He also moved to Toronto to attend York University, where he received his Master of Arts (MA) in political science in 1972; he would also later receive his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in political science here in 1983. In 1974, Layton began his academic career as an educator at Ryerson Polytechnical Institute (now Toronto Metropolitan University), where he taught political science. He also spent time working at York and, from 1978 to 1994, worked at the University of Toronto as an adjunct professor. He also became a prominent activist for a variety of causes. He wrote several books, including &quot;Homelessness: The Making and Unmaking of a Crisis&quot; and a book on general public policy, &quot;Speaking Out&quot;.

==Toronto City Council==
While at York and Ryerson, Layton developed close ties with a number of Toronto political figures including John Sewell and David Crombie. He was first elected to Toronto City Council during the 1982 municipal election, in a surprise upset against incumbent Gordon Chong as an underdog. Layton quickly became one of the council&#x27;s most outspoken members and a leading figure on the left. He was one of the most vocal opponents of the massive SkyDome project, and an early advocate for rights for AIDS patients. In 1984, Layton was fined for trespassing after distributing leaflets at the Toronto Eaton Centre during a strike by Eaton&#x27;s employees, but the charge was later dismissed on free speech grounds. He was also one of the few opponents of Toronto&#x27;s bid to host the 1996 Summer Olympics. In 1985, Layton moved to the Metropolitan Toronto Council, in the first direct elections for members of that body. During the 1988 municipal elections, Layton swapped roles with his ally Dale Martin, with Martin moving to Metro and Layton returning to Toronto City Council. Layton won comfortably against former high school teacher Lois MacMillan-Walker. The election was a major victory for Layton as the reformist coalition of which he was the &quot;de facto&quot; head gained control of city council, the first time in city history a coalition of New Democrats and independents controlled council.

On July 9, 1988, he married Hong Kong-born Toronto District School Board trustee Olivia Chow in a ceremony on Algonquin Island. Their whitewater rafting honeymoon plans had to be abandoned, however, when days before the wedding Layton collided with a newspaper box while bicycling. Chow later joined Layton on the Toronto City Council. She has been a candidate for the federal New Democrats five times, first winning her seat the third time in a close race against Tony Ianno in the 2006 Canadian election, and re-elected in 2008 and 2011. Chow resigned from federal politics in 2014 to run for mayor of Toronto; she placed third. Chow would later be elected mayor in the 2023 mayoral by-election.

Layton and Chow were also the subject of some dispute when a June 14, 1990, &quot;Toronto Star&quot; article by Tom Kerr accused them of unfairly living in a housing cooperative subsidized by the federal government, despite their high income. Layton and Chow had both lived in the Hazelburn co-op since 1985, and lived together in an $800 per month three-bedroom apartment after their marriage in 1988. By 1990, their combined annual income was $120,000, and in March of that year they began voluntarily paying an additional $325 per month to offset their share of the co-op&#x27;s Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation subsidy, the only members of the co-op to do so. In response to the article, the co-op&#x27;s board argued that having mixed-income tenants was crucial to the success of co-ops, and that the laws deliberately set aside apartments for those willing to pay market rates, such as Layton and Chow. During the late 1980s and early 1990s they maintained approximately 30% of their units as low income units and provided the rest at what they considered market rent. In June 1990, the city solicitor cleared the couple of any wrongdoing, and later that month, Layton and Chow left the co-op and bought a house in Toronto&#x27;s Chinatown together with Chow&#x27;s mother, a move they said had been planned for some time. Former Toronto mayor John Sewell later wrote in &quot;NOW&quot; that rival Toronto city councillor Tom Jakobek had given the story to Tom Kerr.

Originally known for coming to council meetings in blue jeans with unkempt hair, Layton worked to change his image to run for mayor in the 1991 civic election. He also started wearing contact lenses, abandoning his glasses, and traded in his blue jeans for suits. In February 1991, Layton became the first official NDP candidate for the mayoralty, pitting him against centrist incumbent Art Eggleton. In a move that surprised many, Eggleton elected not to run again.

Layton was opposed by three right-of-centre candidates: Susan Fish, June Rowlands, and Betty Disero. Right-wing support soon coalesced around former city councillor Rowlands, preventing the internal divisions Layton needed to win office. Layton was also hurt by the growing unpopularity of the provincial NDP government of Bob Rae, and by his earlier opposition to Toronto&#x27;s Olympic bid. Bid organizer Paul Henderson accused Layton and his allies of costing Toronto the event. Despite this, October polls showed Layton only four points behind Rowlands, with 36% support. However, on October 17, Fish, a former provincial Progressive Conservative cabinet minister who had only 19% support, pulled out of the race, and many of her supporters moved to Rowlands. Layton lost the November 12 election by a considerable margin. However, in the same election Olivia Chow easily won a seat on city council.

In November 1991, Layton co-founded the White Ribbon Campaign of men working to end male violence against women. Layton returned to academia and also founded the Green Catalyst Group Inc., an environmental consulting business. In 1993, he ran for the House of Commons in the riding of Rosedale for the NDP, but finished fourth in the generally Liberal riding. In 1994, he returned to Metropolitan Toronto Council, succeeding Roger Hollander in the Don River ward, and he resumed his high-profile role in local politics; following the &quot;megacity&quot; merger of Metropolitan Toronto into the current city of Toronto, he was again re-elected to Toronto City Council, serving alongside Pam McConnell in a two-member ward. He remained on Toronto City Council until pursuing the leadership of the federal New Democrats. He also came to national attention as the leader of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. Federally, he ran again in the 1997 election, this time in the neighbouring riding of Toronto—Danforth, but lost to incumbent Dennis Mills by a wide margin. In June 1999, as chair of Toronto&#x27;s environmental task force, the Toronto Atmospheric Fund, he was instrumental in the preliminary phases of the WindShare wind power cooperative in Toronto through the Toronto Renewable Energy Co-operative.

==Leader of the NDP==
Layton was elected leader of the NDP at the party&#x27;s leadership convention in Toronto, on January 25, 2003. Layton won on the first ballot with 53.5% of the vote, defeating Bill Blaikie, Lorne Nystrom, Joe Comartin and Pierre Ducasse. His campaign was focused on the need to reinvigorate the party, and was prominently endorsed by former NDP leader Ed Broadbent.

Layton did not seek election to the House of Commons by running in a by-election, as is the tradition among new party leaders without a seat. Instead, he waited until the 2004 federal election to contest the riding of Toronto—Danforth against Liberal Dennis Mills. With no seat in the House of Commons, he appointed the runner-up, longtime Winnipeg-area MP Bill Blaikie, as parliamentary leader. Although he had no parliamentary seat, Layton was noted for drawing considerable attention from the Canadian mass media. Much of his rhetoric involved attacking the policies of then Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin as conservative, and arguing the ideology of the Liberal Party of Canada had shifted in a more right wing direction. Another focus of Layton&#x27;s leadership was to focus the party&#x27;s efforts on Quebec, one of the party&#x27;s weaker provinces. One of his opponents in the leadership race, Pierre Ducasse, was the first Québécois to run for leader of the NDP. After the race, Layton appointed Ducasse as his Quebec lieutenant and party spokesperson.

The result of Layton&#x27;s efforts was a strong increase in the party&#x27;s support. By the end of 2003, the party was polling higher than both the Canadian Alliance or the Progressive Conservatives and it was even suggested that the next election could see the NDP in place as Official Opposition.

===2004 election===

During the 2004 Canadian federal election, controversy erupted over Layton&#x27;s accusation that Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin was responsible for the deaths of homeless people because he failed to provide funding for affordable housing. While rates of homelessness and homeless deaths increased during the eleven years of Liberal government, the link to Martin&#x27;s decisions was indirect as affordable housing is a mainly provincial jurisdiction. Layton&#x27;s charge was defended by some, including the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;, but most attacked it as inaccurate and negative campaigning. Moreover, the controversy consumed the campaign, overshadowing policy announcements over the next week.

Further controversy followed as Layton suggested the removal of the &quot;Clarity Act&quot;, considered by some to be vital to keeping Quebec in Canada and by others as undemocratic, and promised to recognize any declaration of independence by Quebec after a referendum. This position was not part of the NDP&#x27;s official party policy, leading some high-profile party members, such as NDP House Leader Bill Blaikie and former NDP leader Alexa McDonough, to publicly indicate that they did not share Layton&#x27;s views. His position on the &quot;Clarity Act&quot; was reversed in the 2006 election to one of support.

Layton also continued his effort to improve his party&#x27;s standing in Quebec. The NDP ran French-language ads in the province and Layton, who spoke colloquial Québécois French, appeared in them. As early as his leadership campaign, Layton advocated for electoral reform, calling for a referendum to replace the first-past-the-post system with proportional representation. He threatened to use the NDP&#x27;s clout in the event of a minority government. However, it was dismissed out of hand by the Liberal and Bloc Québécois leaders, as they tend to be favoured by the first-past-the-post system, normally being allocated a greater proportion of seats than the proportion of votes cast for them. Historically, the NDP&#x27;s popular vote does not translate into a proportional number of seats because of scattered support. This was most opposed by the Bloc Québécois, who usually had the lowest popular vote but nonetheless won many seats because their support was concentrated in Quebec. Despite these problems, Layton led the NDP to a 15% popular vote, its highest in 16 years. However, it only won 19 seats in the House of Commons, two less than the 21 won under Alexa McDonough in 1997, and far short of the 40 that Layton predicted on the eve of the election. However, some potential NDP voters may have voted Liberal to prevent a possible Conservative win. Olivia Chow and several other prominent Toronto NDP candidates lost tight races and Layton won his own seat against incumbent Liberal Dennis Mills by a much narrower margin than early polls indicated.

===Liberal minority government===

With the ruling Liberal Party being reduced to a minority government, revelations of the sponsorship scandal damaging its popularity to the point where both the Conservative Party and the Bloc Québécois were pressing their advantage for a snap election, the prime minister approached the NDP for its support. Layton demanded the cancellation of proposed corporate tax cuts and called for an increase in social spending. The ensuing compromise in the NDP&#x27;s favour was protested by the other opposition parties who used it as a pretext to force a non-confidence vote. On May 19, two such votes were defeated and Layton&#x27;s amendments went on to be passed on its final reading vote on June 23. As a result of this political coup and his apparent civil behaviour in a spitefully raucous parliament, many political analysts noted that Layton gained increased credibility as an effective leader of an important party, becoming the major second choice leader in many political polls – for example, polling second in Quebec after Gilles Duceppe, despite the low polls for his party as a whole in the province.

In mid-November 2005, when Liberal support dropped after the Gomery Commission delivered its first report, Layton offered the prime minister several conditions in return for the NDP&#x27;s continued support, most notably on the issue of privatization of health care in Canada, where Layton wanted strict provisions for controlling public spending on private health care delivery, saying that without &quot;significant action&quot; on the issue, &quot;Mr. Martin can&#x27;t count on our support.&quot; Martin for his part offered no comment on a meeting held to discuss the issue, only saying that it was a &quot;good meeting&quot;, while Layton publicly expressed his disappointment at the outcome. Layton announced he would introduce a motion requesting a February election. However, the Martin government refused to allow the election date to be decided by the opposition. A motion of non-confidence followed, moved by Stephen Harper and seconded by Layton, triggering the 2006 federal election. Layton was working with the Liberal government, but determined he would have a better chance of electoral success by voting against the government and having an election.

====Coalition attempt with the Bloc Québécois and the Conservatives====
On March 26, 2011, in response to Harper&#x27;s allegations that a coalition is not a legitimate or principled way to form government, Duceppe stated that Harper had once tried to form a coalition government with the Bloc Québécois and NDP. In 2004 Stephen Harper privately met with Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe and Layton in a Montreal hotel. The meeting that took place between the three party leaders happened two months before the federal election. On September 9, 2004, the three signed a letter addressed to then-Governor General Adrienne Clarkson, stating,
On the same day the letter was written, the three party leaders held a joint press conference at which they expressed their intent to co-operate on changing parliamentary rules, and to request that the governor general consult with them before deciding to call an election. At the news conference, Harper said &quot;It is the Parliament that&#x27;s supposed to run the country, not just the largest party and the single leader of that party. That&#x27;s a criticism I&#x27;ve had and that we&#x27;ve had and that most Canadians have had for a long, long time now so this is an opportunity to start to change that.&quot; However, at the time, Harper and the two other opposition leaders denied trying to form a coalition government. Harper said, &quot;This is not a coalition, but this is a co-operative effort.&quot;

One month later, on October 4, Mike Duffy, now a Conservative senator (appointed by Harper), said &quot;It is possible that you could change prime minister without having an election&quot;, and that some Conservatives wanted Harper as prime minister. The next day Layton walked out on talks with Harper and Duceppe, accusing them of trying to replace Paul Martin with Harper as prime minister. Both Bloc and Conservative officials denied Layton&#x27;s accusations.

===2006 campaign===

With a vote scheduled for January 23, 2006, many New Democrats expected Layton to deliver substantially more seats than he did in 2004. They hoped the NDP would hold the balance of power in a new minority Parliament, so that they could carry additional leverage in negotiating with the governing party. Mike Klander, the executive vice-president of the federal Liberals&#x27; Ontario wing, resigned after making posts on his blog comparing Chow to a Chow Chow dog and calling Layton an &quot;asshole&quot;.

Through the course of the campaign, Layton attempted to cast himself as the sole remaining champion of universal health care. Some opinion polls showed that Canadians found Layton the most appealing and charismatic of the leaders. Layton repeatedly insisted that &quot;Canadians have a third choice&quot;, and urged Liberals to &quot;lend us your vote&quot;. Some commentators and pundits mocked Layton for over-using these catchphrases instead of explaining the NDP platform.

The NDP strategy had changed in that they were focusing their attacks on the Liberals rather than in 2004, where they criticized both the Liberals and Conservatives in equal measure, prompting some criticism from Paul Martin. Andrew Coyne suggested that the NDP not only wanted to disassociate themselves from the scandal-ridden Liberals, but also because the Liberals were likely to receive credit for legislation achieved under the Liberal-NDP partnership. The NDP had also lost close races in the 2004 election due to the Liberals&#x27; strategic voting. Early in the campaign, NDP MP Judy Wasylycia-Leis had asked the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to launch a criminal investigation into the leaking of the income trust announcement. The criminal probe seriously damaged the Liberal campaign and preventing them from making their key policy announcements, as well as bringing alleged Liberal corruption back into the spotlight.

Layton&#x27;s campaign direction also caused a break between him and Canadian Auto Workers union head Buzz Hargrove over the issue of strategic voting. Hargrove preferred a Liberal minority government supported by the NDP and he had earlier criticized Layton for participating in the motion of non-confidence that brought down the Liberal government. Hargrove allied with the Liberals and publicly stated that he &quot;did not like the campaign that Jack Layton was running&quot;, criticizing Layton for &quot;spending too much time attacking the Liberals&quot;. During the final week of the campaign, knowing that last-minute strategic voting had cost the NDP seats in several close ridings during the 2004 election, Hargrove and Martin urged all progressive voters to unite behind the Liberal banner to stop a Conservative government.

Layton intensified his attacks on the Liberal scandals, pledging to use his minority clout to keep the Conservatives in check. Shortly after the election, the Ontario provincial branch of the NDP revoked Hargrove&#x27;s party membership because he had violated the party&#x27;s constitution by campaigning for other parties during an election campaign, though Layton disagreed with this. Hargrove retaliated by severing ties with the NDP at the annual CAW convention. The election increased the NDP&#x27;s total seats to 29 seats, up from 18 before dissolution. Among the new NDP candidates elected was Olivia Chow, making the two only the second husband-and-wife team in Canadian Parliament history (Gurmant Grewal and Nina Grewal were the first husband-and-wife team in Canadian Parliament after the 2004 federal election). In the end, the NDP succeeded in increasing their parliamentary representation to 29 MPs, though they had significantly fewer seats than the Bloc Québécois (51) or the Opposition Liberals (103).

===Conservative minority government===
At the NDP&#x27;s 22nd Convention, held on September 10, 2006, in Quebec City, Layton received a 92% approval rating in a leadership vote, tying former Reform Party leader Preston Manning&#x27;s record for this kind of voting. This record was later broken in 2016 by Elizabeth May of the Green Party of Canada. At the same convention, the NDP passed a motion calling for the return of Canadian Forces from Afghanistan. On September 24, 2006, he met with Afghan President Hamid Karzai to discuss the NDP position. After the meeting Layton stated that Canada&#x27;s role should be focused on traditional peacekeeping and reconstruction rather than in a front line combat role currently taking place.

Layton and his caucus voted to support the new proposed rules for income trusts introduced by the Conservatives October 31, 2006. The short-term result of the tax policy announcement was a loss to Canadian investors of $20 billion, the largest ever loss attributed to a change in government policy.

Layton threatened to move a motion of non-confidence against the government over the &quot;Clean Air Act&quot; unless action was taken to improve the bill and its approach to environmental policy. Prime Minister Harper agreed to put an end to the Parliamentary logjam by sending the bill to a special legislative committee before second reading. He released his proposed changes to the &quot;Clean Air Act&quot; on November 19, 2006.

On June 3, 2008, Layton voted to implement a program which would &quot;allow conscientious objectors ... to a war not sanctioned by the United Nations ... to ... remain in Canada ...&quot; Layton led the NDP to be instrumental in taking action on the peace issue of Canada and Iraq War resisters.

On June 11, 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper made it known that he had received private counsel from Layton on the matter of Indian residential schools and the apology to former students of the schools. Before delivering the apology, Harper thanked Layton.

===2008 campaign===

Layton started off the 2008 federal election campaign with a speech similar to that of US presidential nominee Barack Obama. Layton denied he was trying to draw comparisons with Obama, saying &quot;I mean, I am a lot shorter than he is. He is a brilliant orator. I&#x27;m never going to claim to be that. But what I have noticed is that the key issues faced by the American middle class, the working people of the U.S. and their concerns about their families&#x27; futures, are awfully similar to the issues that I hear in Canada.&quot; Layton said that he has also written to Obama and Hillary Clinton saying that the North American Free Trade Agreement had hurt working people in both countries &quot;and those stories have to be told.&quot;

Layton, along with Prime Minister Harper and Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe, initially opposed the inclusion of Green Party leader Elizabeth May in the leaders&#x27; televised debates. Layton initially said that he was following the rules of the broadcast consortium, while NDP spokesman Brad Lavigne confirmed that Layton had refused to attend if May was present, noting that May had endorsed Liberal leader Stéphane Dion for prime minister, and arguing that her inclusion would in effect give the Liberals two representatives at the debate. Rod Love, former chief of staff to Ralph Klein, suggested that the Greens could potentially cut into the NDP&#x27;s support. Layton&#x27;s stance drew criticism from the YWCA, Judy Rebick, and members of his own party. Layton dropped his opposition to May&#x27;s inclusion on September 10, 2008. &quot;This whole issue of debating about the debate has become a distraction to the real debate that needs to happen&quot;, Layton said. &quot;I have only one condition for this debate and that is that the prime minister is there.&quot;

In October 2008, Layton posted an online video message speaking out in favour of net neutrality, torrent sites, video-sharing sites, and social-networking sites. In a separate interview he said that increasing corporate control &quot;is very, very dangerous and we have put the whole issue of net neutrality right into the heart of our campaign platform&quot;, and that the Internet is &quot;a public tool for exchanging ideas and I particularly want to say that if we don&#x27;t fight to preserve it, we could lose it.&quot; In the end, the NDP gained 8 new seats, taking its tally to 37. This result still left the NDP as Canada&#x27;s fourth party, behind the Bloc Québécois with 50. The NDP managed to retain Outremont, held by Tom Mulcair, its only seat in the province.

===Continued Conservative minority government===
The 40th session of Parliament began on November 27, 2008, with a fiscal update by the Conservatives that outlined their agenda for the upcoming term. This included a temporary suspension of federal employees&#x27; right to strike and a removal of monetary subsidies for political parties. All three opposition parties including the NDP stated that they could not support this position. Layton along with Liberal leader Stéphane Dion and Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe began negotiations to form a coalition that would replace the Conservatives as the government. The three opposition parties planned to table a motion of non-confidence in the House of Commons, and counted on the likelihood that the Governor General Michaëlle Jean, would invite the coalition to govern instead of dissolving parliament and calling an election so soon after the last election.

On December 1, 2008, the three opposition leaders signed an accord that laid down the basis for an agreement on a coalition government. The proposed structure would be a coalition between the Liberals and the NDP, with the New Democrats getting six Cabinet positions. Both parties agreed to continue the coalition until June 30, 2011. The Bloc Québécois would not be formally part of the government but would provide support on confidence motions for 18 months.

Opposition to the proposed coalition developed in all provinces except Quebec. On December 4, 2008, the governor general granted Prime Minister Harper&#x27;s request to prorogue Parliament until January 26, 2009, at which time Harper had planned to introduce the budget. Dion had since been ousted from the leadership of the Liberals and his successor, Michael Ignatieff, had distanced himself from the coalition.

Layton remained committed to ousting the Harper government, pledging that the NDP would vote against the Conservative budget regardless of what it contained. Layton urged Ignatieff&#x27;s Liberal Party to topple the Conservatives before the shelf life of the coalition expired; constitutional experts said that four months after the last election, if the government fell, the governor general would likely grant the prime minister&#x27;s request to dissolve Parliament instead of inviting the coalition.

On January 28, 2009, the Liberals agreed to support the Conservative budget with an amendment, ending the possibility of the coalition, so Layton said &quot;Today we have learned that you can&#x27;t trust Mr. Ignatieff to oppose Mr. Harper. If you oppose Mr. Harper and you want a new government, I urge you to support the NDP.&quot;

In March 2009, the NDP, under Layton&#x27;s leadership, re-introduced a motion (first passed June 3, 2008) which, if implemented, would allow conscientious objectors to the Iraq War to remain in Canada. The motion again passed March 30, 2009, by 129–125, but it was non-binding. In a leadership review vote held at the NDP&#x27;s August 2009 federal policy convention, 89.25% of delegates voted against holding a leadership convention to replace Layton. In October 2009, Layton paired up with the Stephen Lewis Foundation to raise money for HIV/AIDS affected families in Africa. As part of the foundation&#x27;s A Dare to Remember campaign, Layton busked on a busy street corner.

Layton&#x27;s son, Mike was elected to Toronto City Council in the 2010 city council election.

In early 2011, Layton was featured in an episode of CBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Make the Politician Work&quot;.

The Conservative government was defeated in a no-confidence vote on March 25, 2011, with the motion gaining full support of all opposition parties including the New Democrats, after the government was found in contempt of Parliament. It was the first time in Commonwealth history that a government lost the confidence of the House of Commons on the grounds of contempt of Parliament. The no-confidence motion was carried with a vote of 156 in favour of the motion, and 145 against, thus resulting in the prime minister advising a dissolution of Parliament and a federal election.

===2011 campaign===

The day after the successful passing of the motion, Layton started the NDP election campaign, first with a speech in Ottawa followed later in the day by an event in Edmonton, Alberta. Questions about Layton&#x27;s health due to a recent hip surgery were often directed to him during the campaign, with Layton insisting that he was healthy enough to lead. On March 29, 2011, the New Democrats presented their first real campaign promise, a proposal to cap credit card rates to reduce credit card debt.

Unlike the previous election, Layton stated he was in favour of Green Party leader Elizabeth May speaking at the leaders debates, despite the fact that she was once again being discouraged by the Canadian media networks. The NDP also embarked upon the largest advertising campaign in its history, focusing on the Harper government&#x27;s health care record. He also dedicated the federal election campaign to former Saskatchewan premier Allan Blakeney, who died about halfway through the campaign.

Despite entering the campaign with relatively low poll numbers, the NDP recovered and increased their support significantly after Layton&#x27;s performance in the leaders debates. In the English-language debate, Layton criticized Michael Ignatieff&#x27;s poor attendance record in the House of Commons, saying &quot;You know, most Canadians, if they don&#x27;t show up for work, they don&#x27;t get a promotion!&quot;, to which Ignatieff was unable to respond effectively. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; described Layton&#x27;s attack as a &quot;knock-out punch&quot; while the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; stated it was the &quot;pivot in the debate [that] was a turning point in the federal campaign&quot;. Layton&#x27;s New Democrats successfully capitalized on Ignatieff&#x27;s attendance record in the Toronto area.

On February 4, 2011, Layton attended a rally against usage-based billing in Toronto with MPs Dan McTeague, Olivia Chow, Peggy Nash and others. His attendance at this rally was accompanied by several press releases by the NDP denouncing metered internet usage in Canada.

The NDP surge began in Quebec, with the NDP surprising many observers by surpassing the previously front-running Bloc in Quebec. In Canada overall, the NDP surged past the Liberals to take the second place behind the Conservatives; in Quebec, the NDP took first place. The NDP surge became the dominant narrative of the last week of the campaign, as other parties turned their attacks on the party and Layton.
On April 29, 2011, a retired police officer told the Sun News Network and the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; newspaper that in 1996, Layton had been found in a massage parlour when police, looking for underage Asian sex workers, raided the establishment. The police informed Layton of the potentially questionable use of the business and recommended that he avoid it in the future. No charges were filed. The &quot;Sun&quot; later ran a follow-up piece, in which Toronto city councillor Giorgio Mammoliti criticized Layton. Layton has said there was no wrongdoing in the matter, saying that he simply &quot;went for a massage at a community clinic&quot; and did not return after the police advised him not to. He also referred to the release of the police report as a smear campaign against him. Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe also dismissed the claim. A columnist for the &quot;National Post&quot; suggested that it was a Liberal insider that leaked the story, although a Liberal Party spokesman denied that they had anything to do with it.

A subsequent &quot;Toronto Star&quot; column stated that most contributors to online discussions agreed there was a smear campaign against Layton. As for political damage from this story, that same day&#x27;s update of the Nanos Leadership Index, which assesses public opinion on the Canadian federal leaders&#x27; trustworthiness, competence and vision for Canada, saw Layton rise from a score of 80 to a score of 97, surpassing Harper&#x27;s 88 and Ignatieff&#x27;s 39. The polling company speculated this improvement is due to strong sympathy by the public for a political candidate they judged as being unfairly maligned. The Toronto Police Service launched an investigation into how official police notes were leaked to Sun Media. Police notebooks are closely guarded and may contain unfounded and unproven allegations. On May 5, 2011, it was announced that no charges would be laid with regards to the leaked information.

Layton appeared on the Radio-Canada talk show &quot;Tout le monde en parle&quot; on April 3, an appearance that was credited for improving his party&#x27;s standing among Francophone voters due to his informal Québécois French. The show is the most popular program in Quebec. He was also perceived to have performed well in the televised French-language party leaders&#x27; debate on April 13.

In the May 2, 2011, election, Layton led the NDP to 103 seats, more than double its previous high. This was also enough to make the NDP the Official Opposition for the first time. The NDP gains were partly due to a major surge in Quebec as the party won 59 of the province&#x27;s 75 seats, dominating Montreal and sweeping Quebec City and the Outaouais, although the NDP also won more seats than any other opposition party in the rest of Canada. The NDP had gone into the election with only one seat in Quebec, that of Thomas Mulcair, and had won but a single seat in the province historically (Phil Edmonston in a 1990 by-election). Many of these gains came at the expense of the Bloc, which was reduced to a four-seat rump without official party status in Parliament.

==Family and personal life==

Layton came from a political family: his maternal great-granduncle, William Steeves, was a Father of Confederation. His great-grandfather, Philip E. Layton, was a blind piano salesman and activist who, in 1908, founded the Montreal Association for the Blind; in the 1930s, he campaigned for disability pensions. Philip was the senior partner in the family business, Layton Bros. Pianos. Layton Pianos had been made in London, England, since 1837, and Philip had emigrated to Montreal at the age of 19. His business, which was opened on Saint Catherine Street in Montreal, continues to operate as Layton Audio. Philip&#x27;s 1898 composition &quot;Dominion March&quot; was played at Layton&#x27;s lying in state.

Layton&#x27;s grandfather, Gilbert, served in Quebec&#x27;s Union Nationale government led by Maurice Duplessis as a cabinet minister, later resigning due to the provincial government&#x27;s lack of support for Canadian participation in World War II. Layton&#x27;s father, Robert, was initially a member of the Liberal Party as an activist in the 1960s and 1970s, who later switched to the Progressive Conservatives and served as a federal Cabinet minister in the 1980s under Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, as well as a member of Parliament.

Layton was raised as a member of the United Church of Canada, and was a member of Bloor Street United Church in Toronto. However, he also sometimes attended services at the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto, whose pastor, Brent Hawkes, was a longtime NDP activist and a personal friend of Layton&#x27;s.

In 1969, at age 19, Layton married his high school sweetheart Sally Halford, with whom he had two children: Mike, who served as a Toronto city councillor from 2010 to 2022, and Sarah, who works for the Stephen Lewis Foundation. Layton and Halford&#x27;s marriage ended in divorce in 1983 after 14 years.

Layton first met Olivia Chow in 1985 during an auction at Village by the Grange, in which Jack was the auctioneer and Olivia was the interpreter for the Cantonese language observers. They had been previously acquainted, however they realized that they were both candidates in the upcoming election and decided to have lunch together to talk about the campaign. Three weeks after the auction, they went on their first date. Olivia&#x27;s mother did not approve of Layton at first, because of his race as well as him not being a lawyer or doctor. Layton was invited to dinner at the home of Olivia&#x27;s mother, where they also played mahjong. After the dinner, Layton attempted to thank Olivia&#x27;s mother in Cantonese, however his incorrect tone had him inadvertently saying, &quot;Thank you for the good sex.&quot; Layton stated &quot;My faux pas broke the ice completely. We&#x27;ve been good buddies ever since.&quot;

Layton was known for playing music and singing songs at party gatherings. Alberta NDP leader Brian Mason remembered during the three-day board meetings when Layton was running for president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities: &quot;He would gather people together in his hotel room and play the guitar and get everybody singing old folk songs from the 1960s. He just got people involved, just with his personality, not politics.&quot;

Layton was a keen Trekkie, having a custom Starfleet uniform made by a tailor. Layton was famously photographed wearing his uniform at a Star Trek convention in 1991.

At the 2005 Parliamentary Press Gallery Dinner (typically a satirical event), Layton sent up himself and his party, playing guitar and singing three songs: &quot;Party for Sale or Rent&quot; (to the tune of &quot;King of the Road&quot;), a re-worked version of &quot;Nobody Knows You When You&#x27;re Down and Out&quot; with different humorous lyrics, and &quot;If I Had Another $4.6 Billion&quot;.

==Illness and death==
 
On February 5, 2010, Layton announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. He noted that his father Robert Layton had the same type of cancer 17 years before and recovered from it. His wife, Olivia Chow, had thyroid cancer a few years before. He vowed to beat the cancer, and said it would not interrupt his duties as member of Parliament or as leader of the NDP.

Following the 2011 federal election, Layton led the party into the first month of the new session of Parliament, as well as attending the NDP Federal Convention in Vancouver. After Parliament rose for the summer, Layton announced on July 25, 2011, that he would be taking a temporary leave from his post to fight an unspecified, newly diagnosed cancer. He was hoping to return as leader of the NDP upon the resumption of the House of Commons on September 19, 2011. Layton recommended that NDP caucus chair Nycole Turmel serve as interim leader during his leave of absence.

Layton died at 4:45 a.m. ET on August 22, 2011, at his home in Toronto. He was 61 years old.

Upon hearing the news, there was a nationwide outpouring of grief, and Governor General David Johnston, Prime Minister Stephen Harper, NDP deputy leader Libby Davies, and the US ambassador to Canada, David Jacobson issued statements praising Layton and mourning his loss. Layton&#x27;s family released an open letter, written by Layton two days before his death. In it, he expressed his wishes regarding the NDP&#x27;s leadership in the event of his death, and addressed various segments of the Canadian population.

Layton was accorded a state funeral, which took place between August 25 and 27, 2011, with the final memorial service at Roy Thomson Hall in Toronto. Layton was the second leader of the Official Opposition to die while in office; the first, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, had been a former prime minister, and had been given a state funeral under the protocol for prime ministers. Layton was the first Official Opposition leader to die for whom a state funeral would not otherwise have been afforded, but Prime Minister Harper made the offer to Layton&#x27;s widow who accepted. Layton&#x27;s body was cremated following the funeral. A portion of his ashes was scattered under a jack pine planted on Toronto Island in his honour, with a second portion scattered at the Layton family&#x27;s plot at Cote St. Charles United Church in Hudson, Quebec. A third portion was scattered under a memorial sculpted by Chow, placed at the Toronto Necropolis Cemetery on the first anniversary of his death.

==In popular culture==
Layton&#x27;s life is portrayed in a 2013 television movie entitled &quot;Jack&quot;, with Rick Roberts portraying Layton and Sook-Yin Lee as Olivia Chow. The cast also includes Wendy Crewson and Erin Karpluk. It was released on March 10, 2013, and aired on CBC Television.

==Electoral history==

==Legacy and honours==

* The Jack Layton Ferry Terminal in Toronto was renamed in Layton&#x27;s honour in 2013, on the second anniversary of his death. A bronze statue of Layton riding on a tandem bicycle was installed at the site.
* Jack Layton Way in Toronto was named in 2013 (formerly Don Jail Roadway and parking area in front of the old jail). The street was once part of the driveway to the Don Jail and now being transformed as part of the Bridgepoint Health redevelopment in the Toronto neighbourhood of Riverdale; the community is in Layton&#x27;s former electoral district of Toronto—Danforth. South side of the roadway is Toronto Public Library Riverdale Branch and Hubbard Park (named after William Peyton Hubbard.)
* Ryerson University (now Toronto Metropolitan University), where Layton was a professor for many years, honoured him by creating the Jack Layton Chair in the Department of Politics and Public Administration.

<text>The lentil (Vicia lens or Lens culinaris) is a legume; it is an annual plant grown for its lens-shaped edible seeds, also called &quot;lentils&quot;. It is about tall, and the seeds grow in pods, usually with two seeds in each.

Lentil seeds are used around the world for culinary purposes. In cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, where lentils are a staple, split lentils (often with their hulls removed) known as &quot;dal&quot; are often cooked into a thick curry that is usually eaten with rice or roti. Lentils are commonly used in stews and soups.

== Botanical description ==
=== Name ===

Many different names in different parts of the world are used for the crop lentil. The first use of the word &quot;lens&quot; to designate a specific genus was in the 17th century by the botanist Tournefort. The word &quot;lens&quot; for the lentil is of classical Roman or Latin origin, possibly from a prominent Roman family named Lentulus, just as the family name &quot;Cicero&quot; was derived from the chickpea, &quot;Cicer arietinum&quot;, and &quot;Fabia&quot; (as in Quintus Fabius Maximus) from the fava bean (&quot;Vicia faba&quot;).

=== Systematics ===

The genus &quot;Vicia&quot; is part of the subfamily Faboideae which is contained in the flowering plant family Fabaceae or commonly known as legume or bean family, of the order Fabales in the kingdom Plantae.

The former genus &quot;Lens&quot; consisted of the cultivated &quot;L. culinaris&quot; and six related wild taxa. Among the different taxa of wild lentils, &quot;L. orientalis&quot; was considered to be the progenitor of the cultivated lentil and was generally classified as &quot;L. culinaris&quot; subsp. &quot;orientalis&quot;.

Lentil is hypogeal, which means the cotyledons of the germinating seed stay in the ground and inside the seed coat. Therefore, it is less vulnerable to frost, wind erosion, or insect attack.

The plant is a diploid, annual, bushy herb of erect, semierect, or spreading and compact growth and normally varies from in height. It has many hairy branches and its stem is slender and angular. The rachis bears 10 to 15 leaflets in five to eight pairs. The leaves are alternate, of oblong-linear and obtuse shape and from yellowish green to dark bluish green in colour. In general, the upper leaves are converted into tendrils, whereas the lower leaves are mucronate. If stipules are present, they are small. The flowers, one to four in number, are small, white, pink, purple, pale purple, or pale blue in colour. They arise from the axils of the leaves, on a slender footstalk almost as long as the leaves. The pods are oblong, slightly inflated, and about long. Normally, each of them contains two seeds, about in diameter, in the characteristic lens shape. The seeds can also be mottled and speckled. The several cultivated varieties of lentil differ in size, hairiness, and colour of the leaves, flowers, and seeds.

Lentils are self-pollinating. The flowering begins from the lowermost buds and gradually moves upward, so-called acropetal flowering. About two weeks are needed for all the flowers to open on the single branch. At the end of the second day and on the third day after the opening of the flowers, they close completely and the colour begins to fade. After three to four days, the setting of the pods takes place.

== Types ==

Types can be classified according to their size, whether they are split or whole, or shelled or unshelled. Seed coats can range from light green to deep purple, as well as being tan, grey, brown, black or mottled. Shelled lentils show the colour of the cotyledon which can be yellow, orange, red, or green.

Red-cotyledon types:
* Nipper (Australia)
* Northfield (Australia)
* Cobber (Australia)
* Digger (Australia)
* Nugget (Australia)
* Aldinga (Australia)
* Masoor dal (unshelled lentils with a brown seed coat and an orange-red cotyledon)
* Petite crimson (shelled Masoor lentils)
* Red Chief (light tan seed coat and red cotyledon)

Small green/brown-seed coat types:
* Eston Green
* Pardina (Spain)
* Verdina (Spain)

Medium green/brown-seed coat types
* Avondale (United States)
* Matilda (Australia)
* Richlea

Large green/brown-seed coat types:
* Boomer (Australia)
* Brewer&#x27;s: a large brown lentil which is often considered the &quot;regular&quot; lentil in the United States
* Castellana (Spanish)
* Laird: the commercial standard for large green lentils in western Canada
* Mason
* Merrit
* Mosa (Spain)
* Naslada (Bulgaria)
* Pennell (United States)
* Riveland (United States)

Other types:
* Beluga: black, bead-like, lens-shaped, almost spherical, named for resemblance to beluga caviar. Called Indianhead in Canada.
* &quot;Macachiados&quot;: big yellow Mexican lentils
* Puy lentils (var. &quot;puyensis&quot;): Small dark speckled blue-green lentil from France with a Protected Designation of Origin name
* Alb-Leisa three traditional genotypes of lentils native to the Swabian Jura (Alps) in Germany and protected by the producers&#x27; association Öko-Erzeugergemeinschaft Alb-Leisa (engl. &quot;Eco-producer association Alb-Leisa&quot;)
== Production ==

In 2022, global production of lentils was 6.7 million tonnes. Canada produced the largest share, 2.2 million tonnes, or roughly 34% of the world&#x27;s total output (table), nearly all (95%) of it in Saskatchewan. India was the world&#x27;s second-largest producer, led by the states of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, which together account for roughly 70 percent of the national lentil production.

== Cultivation ==
=== History ===

The cultivated lentil &quot;Lens culinaris&quot; subsp. &quot;culinaris&quot; was derived from its wild subspecies &quot;L. culinaris&quot; subsp. &quot;orientalis&quot;, although other species may also have contributed some genes, according to Jonathan Sauer (&quot;Historical Geography of Crop Plants&quot;, 2017). Unlike their wild ancestors, domesticated lentil crops have indehiscent pods and non-dormant seeds.

Lentil was domesticated in the Fertile Crescent of the Near East and then spread to Europe and North Africa and the Indo-Gangetic plain. The primary center of diversity for the domestic &quot;Lens culinaris&quot; as well as its wild progenitor &quot;L. culinaris ssp. orientalis&quot; is considered to be the Middle East. The oldest known carbonized remains of lentil from Greece&#x27;s Franchthi Cave are dated to 11,000 BC. In archaeobotanical excavations carbonized remains of lentil seeds have been recovered from widely dispersed places such as Tell Ramad in Syria (6250–5950 BC), Aceramic Beidha in Jordan, Hacilar in Turkey (5800–5000 BC), Tepe Sabz (Ita. Tepe Sabz) in Iran (5500–5000 BC) and Argissa-Magula Tessaly in Greece (6000–5000 BC), along other places.

=== Soil requirements ===
Lentils can grow on various soil types, from sand to clay loam, growing best in deep sandy loam soils with moderate fertility. A soil pH around 7 would be the best. Lentils do not tolerate flooding or water-logged conditions.

Lentils improve the physical properties of soils and increase the yield of succeeding cereal crops. Biological nitrogen fixation or other rotational effects could be the reason for higher yields after lentils&quot;.&quot;

=== Climate requirements ===
The conditions under which lentils are grown differ across different growing regions. In the temperate climates lentils are planted in the winter and spring under low temperatures and vegetative growth occurs in later spring and the summer. Rainfall during this time is not limited. In the subtropics, lentils are planted under relatively high temperatures at the end of the rainy season, and vegetative growth occurs on the residual soil moisture in the summer season. Rainfall during this time is limited. In West Asia and North Africa, some lentils are planted as a winter crop before snowfall. Plant growth occurs during the time of snow melting. Under such cultivation, seed yields are often much higher.

===Seedbed requirements and sowing ===
The lentil requires a firm, smooth seedbed with most of the previous crop residues incorporated. For the seed placement and for later harvesting it is important that the surface is not uneven with large clods, stones, or protruding crop residue. It is also important that the soil be made friable and weed-free, so that seeding can be done at a uniform depth.

The plant densities for lentils vary between genotypes, seed size, planting time and growing conditions, and also from region to region. In South Asia, a seed rate of is recommended. In West Asian countries, a higher seed rate is recommended, and also leads to a higher yield. The seeds should be sown deep. In agriculturally mechanized countries, lentils are planted using grain drills, but many other areas still hand broadcast.

=== Cultivation management, fertilization ===
In intercropping systems – a practice commonly used in lentil cultivation – herbicides may be needed to assure crop health. Like many other legume crops, lentils can fix atmospheric nitrogen in the soil with specific rhizobia. Lentils grow well under low fertilizer input conditions, although phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium, and sulfur may be used for nutrient-poor soils.

=== Diseases ===

Below is a list of the most common lentil diseases.

====Fungal diseases====

====Nematodes, parasitic====

====Viral diseases====

== Use by humans ==
=== Processing ===
A combination of gravity, screens and air flow is used to clean and sort lentils by shape and density. After destoning, they may be separated by a color sorter and then packaged.

A major part of the world&#x27;s red lentil production undergoes a secondary processing step. These lentils are dehulled, split and polished. In the Indian subcontinent, this process is called dal milling. The moisture content of the lentils prior to dehulling is crucial to guarantee a good dehulling efficiency. The hull of lentils usually accounts for 6 to 7 percent of the total seed weight, which is lower than most legumes. Lentil flour can be produced by milling the seeds, like cereals.

=== Culinary use ===
Lentils can be eaten soaked, germinated, fried, baked or boiled – the most common preparation method. The seeds require a cooking time of 10 to 40 minutes, depending on the variety; small varieties with the husk removed, such as the common red lentil, require shorter cooking times (and unlike most legumes don&#x27;t require soaking). Most varieties have a distinctive, earthy flavor. Lentils with husks remain whole with moderate cooking, while those without husks tend to disintegrate into a thick purée, which may enable various dishes. The composition of lentils leads to a high emulsifying capacity which can be even increased by dough fermentation in bread making.

==== Lentil dishes ====
Lentils are used worldwide in many different dishes. Lentil dishes are most widespread throughout South Asia, the Mediterranean regions, West Asia, and Latin America. 
In the Indian subcontinent, Fiji, Mauritius, Singapore and the Caribbean, lentil curry is part of the everyday diet, eaten with both rice and roti. Boiled lentils and lentil stock are used to thicken most vegetarian curries. They are also used as stuffing in dal parathas and puri for breakfast or snacks. Lentils are also used in many regional varieties of sweets. Lentil flour is used to prepare several different bread varieties, such as papadam.

They are frequently combined with rice, which has a similar cooking time. A lentil and rice dish is referred to in Levantine countries as &quot;mujaddara&quot; or &quot;mejadra&quot;. In Iran, rice and lentil is served with fried raisin; this dish is called &quot;adas polo&quot;. Rice and lentils are also cooked together in &quot;khichdi&quot;, a popular dish in the Indian subcontinent (India and Pakistan); another dish, &quot;kushari&quot;, made in Egypt, is considered one of two national dishes.

Lentils are used to prepare an inexpensive and nutritious soup throughout Europe and North and South America, sometimes combined with chicken or pork. In Western countries, cooked lentils are often used in salads. In Italy, the traditional dish for New Year&#x27;s Eve is Cotechino served with lentils.

Lentils are commonly eaten in Ethiopia in a stew-like dish called &quot;kik&quot;, or &quot;kik wot&quot;, one of the dishes people eat with Ethiopia&#x27;s national food, &quot;injera&quot; flatbread. Yellow lentils are used to make a non-spicy stew, which is one of the first solid foods Ethiopians feed their babies.

Lentils were a chief part of the diet of ancient Iranians, who consumed lentils daily in the form of a stew poured over rice.

=== Nutritional value ===
Boiled lentils are 70% water, 20% carbohydrates, 9% protein, and 0.4% fat (table). In a reference amount of , cooked lentils (boiled; variety unspecified) provide 114 calories, and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of folate (45% DV), iron (25% DV), manganese (24% DV), and phosphorus (26% DV). They are a good source (10% DV) of thiamine (15% DV), pantothenic acid (13% DV), vitamin B6 (14% DV), magnesium (10% DV), copper (13% DV), and zinc (13%) (table). Lentils contain carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin, and polyunsaturated fatty acids.

==== Digestive effects ====
The low levels of readily digestible starch (5 percent) and high levels of slowly digested starch make lentils of potential value to people with diabetes. The remaining 65% of the starch is a resistant starch classified as RS1. A minimum of 10% in starch from lentils escapes digestion and absorption in the small intestine (therefore called &quot;resistant starch&quot;). Additional resistant starch is synthesized from gelatinized starch, during cooling, after lentils are cooked.

Lentils also have antinutrient factors, such as trypsin inhibitors and a relatively high phytate content. Trypsin is an enzyme involved in digestion, and phytates reduce the bioavailability of dietary minerals. The phytates can be reduced by prolonged soaking and fermentation or sprouting. Cooking nearly completely removes the trypsin inhibitor activity; sprouting is also effective.

== Breeding ==
Although lentils have been an important crop for centuries, lentil breeding and genetic research have a relatively short history compared to that of many other crops. Since the inception of The International Center for Agriculture Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) breeding programme in 1977 significant gains have been made. It supplies landraces and breeding lines for countries around the world, supplemented by other programmes in both developing (e.g. India) and developed (e.g. Australia and Canada) countries. In recent years, such collaborations among breeders and agronomists are becoming increasingly important.

The focus lies on high yielding and stable cultivars for diverse environments to match the demand of a growing population. In particular, progress in quantity and quality as well as in the resistance to disease and abiotic stresses are the major breeding aims. Several varieties have been developed applying conventional breeding methodologies. Serious genetic improvement for yield has been made, however, the full potential of production and productivity could not yet be tapped due to several biotic and abiotic stresses.

Wild &quot;Lens&quot; species are a significant source of genetic variation for improving the relatively narrow genetic base of this crop. The wild species possess many diverse traits including disease resistances and abiotic stress tolerances. The above-mentioned &quot;L. nigricans&quot; and &quot;L. orientalis&quot; possess morphological similarities to the cultivated &quot;L. culinaris&quot;. But only &quot;L. culinaris&quot; and &quot;L. culinaris&quot; subsp. orientalis are crossable and produce fully fertile seed. Between the different related species hybridisation barriers exist. According to their inter-crossability &quot;Lens&quot; species can be divided into three gene pools:

# Primary gene pool&quot;:&quot; &quot;L. culinaris&quot; (and &quot;L. culinaris&quot; subsp&quot;. orientalis&quot;) and &quot;L. odemensis&quot;
# Secondary gene pool: &quot;L. ervoides&quot; and &quot;L. nigricans&quot;
# Tertiary gene pool: &quot;L. lamottei&quot; and &quot;L. tomentosus&quot;

Crosses generally fail between members of different gene pools. However, plant growth regulators and/or embryo rescue allows the growth of viable hybrids between groups. Even if crosses are successful, many undesired genes may be introduced as well in addition to the desired ones. This can be resolved by using a backcrossing programme. Thus, mutagenesis is crucial to create new and desirable varieties. According to Yadav et al. other biotechnology techniques which may impact on lentil breeding are micro-propagation using meristamatic explants, callus culture and regeneration, protoplast culture and doubled haploid production.

There is a proposed revision of the gene pools using SNP phylogeny.

<text>David Hattersley Warner (29 July 1941 – 24 July 2022) was an English actor who worked in film, television and theatre. Warner&#x27;s lanky, often haggard appearance lent itself to a variety of villainous characters as well as more sympathetic roles across stage and screen. He received accolades such as a Primetime Emmy Award and nominations for a BAFTA Award and Screen Actors Guild Award.

Warner trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art before joining the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) where he made his stage debut in 1962 where he played Henry VI in &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot; cycle at the West End&#x27;s Aldwych Theatre in 1964. The RSC then cast him as Prince Hamlet in Peter Hall&#x27;s 1965 production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. He made his Broadway debut in the 2001 revival of &quot;Major Barbara&quot;.

Warner gained prominence portraying the leading role in the film &quot;Morgan: A Suitable Case for Treatment&quot; (Karel Reisz, 1966), for which he was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Other notable roles include in &quot;The Omen&quot; (1976), &quot;Time After Time&quot; (1979), &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (1981), &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; (1981), &quot;Tron&quot; (1982), &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1984), &quot;Seven Servants&quot; (1996), &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), &quot;Scream 2&quot; (1997), &quot;Ladies in Lavender&quot; (2002), and &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot; (2018). He is also known for his roles in the films &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; (1989), and &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; (1991).

Also known for his television roles, Warner received two Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or TV Movie nominations for his roles as Reinhard Heydrich in the NBC miniseries &quot;Holocaust&quot; (1978), and Pomponius Falco in the ABC miniseries &quot;Masada&quot; (1981), winning for the latter.

==Early life==
Warner was born on 29 July 1941, in Manchester, Lancashire, the son of Ada Doreen Hattersley and Herbert Simon Warner, a nursing home proprietor. He was born out of wedlock and frequently taken to be brought up by each of his parents, eventually settling with his stepmother and Russian Jewish father. At 18 years of age he started at RADA, graduating in 1961 with an Acting (RADA Diploma).

==Career==
===Theatre===
Warner made his professional stage debut at the Royal Court Theatre in January 1962, playing Snout, a minor role in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, directed by Tony Richardson for the English Stage Company. In March 1962, at the Belgrade Theatre, Coventry, he played Conrad in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, following which in June he appeared as Jim in &quot;Afore Night Come&quot; at the New Arts Theatre in London.

He joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon in April 1963 to play Trinculo in &quot;The Tempest&quot;, and Cinna the Poet in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, and in July was cast as Henry VI in the John Barton adaptation of &quot;Henry VI&quot;, Parts I, II and III, which comprised the first two plays from &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot; trilogy. At the West End&#x27;s Aldwych Theatre in January 1964, he again played Henry VI in the complete &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot; history cycle (1964). Returning to Stratford in April, he performed the title role in &quot;Richard II&quot;, Mouldy in &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; and Henry VI. At the Aldwych in October 1964, he was cast as Valentine Brose in the play &quot;Eh?&quot; by Henry Livings, a role he reprised in the 1968 film adaptation &quot;Work Is a Four-Letter Word&quot;.

He first played the title role in &quot;Hamlet&quot; for the RSC in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1965. This production transferred to the Aldwych Theatre in December of that year. In the 1966, Stratford season, his Hamlet was revived and he also played Sir Andrew Aguecheek in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. Finally at the Aldwych in January 1970, he played Julian in &quot;Tiny Alice&quot;.

According to his 2007 programme CV, Warner&#x27;s other work for the theatre included &quot;The Great Exhibition&quot; at Hampstead Theatre (February 1972); &quot;I, Claudius&quot; at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre (July 1972); &quot;A Feast of Snails&quot; at the Lyric Theatre (February 2002); &quot;Where There&#x27;s a Will&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Bath; &quot;King Lear&quot; at Chichester Festival Theatre (2005), see details below); and also &quot;Major Barbara&quot; on Broadway in 2001.

===Film and television===
In 1963, he made his film debut as the villainous Blifil in &quot;Tom Jones&quot;, and in 1965, starred as Henry VI in the BBC television version of the RSC&#x27;s &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot; cycle of Shakespeare&#x27;s history plays. He starred alongside Bob Dylan in the 1963 play &quot;Madhouse on Castle Street&quot;. A major step in his career was the leading role in &quot;Morgan: A Suitable Case for Treatment&quot; (1966), opposite Vanessa Redgrave, which established his reputation for playing slightly off-the-wall characters. He also appeared as Konstantin Treplev in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s 1968 adaptation of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Sea Gull&quot; and starred alongside Jason Robards and Stella Stevens as Reverend Joshua Duncan Sloane in Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;The Ballad of Cable Hogue&quot;.

In horror films, he appeared in one of the stories of &quot;From Beyond the Grave&quot;, opposite Gregory Peck in &quot;The Omen&quot; (1976), as the ill-fated photojournalist Keith Jennings, and the 1979 thriller &quot;Nightwing&quot;. He also starred in cult classic &quot;Waxwork&quot; (1988), and featured alongside a young Viggo Mortensen in the 1990 film &quot;Tripwire&quot;.

He often played villains, in films such as &quot;The Thirty Nine Steps&quot; (1978), &quot;Time After Time&quot; (1979), &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (1981), &quot;Tron&quot; (1982), &quot;Hanna&#x27;s War&quot; (1988), and television series such as &quot;&quot; playing Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, the anti-mutant scientist Herbert Landon in &quot;Spider-Man: The Animated Series&quot;, as well as rogue agent Alpha from &quot;Men in Black&quot;, the Archmage in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Gargoyles&quot;, and the Lobe in &quot;Freakazoid!&quot;. He was also cast against type as Henry Niles in &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; (1971) and as Bob Cratchit in the 1984 telefilm &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; starring George C. Scott as Scrooge. In addition, he played German SS Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich both in the film &quot;Hitler&#x27;s SS: Portrait in Evil&quot;, and the television miniseries &quot;Holocaust&quot;; as sinister millionaire Amos Hackshaw in HBO&#x27;s original 1991 film &quot;Cast a Deadly Spell&quot;.

In 1981, Warner received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Special for &quot;Masada&quot; as Pomponius Falco. In 1988, he appeared in the Danny Huston film &quot;Mr. North&quot;.

He subsequently appeared in films such as &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; (1989), &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;, &quot;Avatar&quot; (known as &quot;Matrix Hunter&quot; in the US), &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze&quot; (1991), &quot;Titanic&quot; (the third time he appeared in a film that is about or includes reference to ) and &quot;Scream 2&quot;. In 2001, he played Captain James Sawyer in two episodes of A&amp;E&#x27;s adaptation of C.S. Forester&#x27;s &quot;Hornblower&quot; series. He appeared in three episodes of the second season of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1991) as &quot;Thomas Eckhardt&quot;. He also continued to play classical roles. In &quot;Chain of Command&quot;, an episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, he was a Cardassian interrogator. He based his portrayal on the evil &quot;re-educator&quot; from &quot;1984&quot;. He appeared in &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; in 1993 as Hong Kong based detective. His less-spectacular roles included a double-role in the low-budget fantasy &quot;Quest of the Delta Knights&quot; (1993) which was eventually spoofed on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. He also played Admiral Tolwyn in the film version of &quot;Wing Commander&quot;.

Warner&#x27;s sympathetic side had been evident in Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;Cross of Iron&quot; (1977), where he portrayed Captain Kiesel. Other &quot;nice guy&quot; roles include in Ken Russel&#x27;s &quot;William and Dorothy&quot; (1978), portraying the poet William Wordsworth, the charismatic &quot;Aldous Gajic&quot; in &quot;Grail&quot;, a first season (1994) episode of &quot;Babylon 5&quot; and &quot;Chancellor Gorkon&quot; in &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; (1991). In an episode of &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, he played Superman&#x27;s deceased Kryptonian father Jor-El, who appeared to his son through holographic recordings. Warner also played &quot;ambiguous nice guys&quot; such as vampire bat exterminator Philip Payne in 1979&#x27;s &quot;Nightwing&quot;; and Dr. Richard Madden in 1994&#x27;s &quot;Necronomicon: Book of the Dead&quot;. In &quot;Seven Servants&quot; by Daryush Shokof, he co-starred with Anthony Quinn in 1996.

Another &#x27;sympathetic&#x27; role was in 2013, when he played Professor Grisenko in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Cold War&quot; in which he battled a revived Ice Warrior and struck up a rapport with the Doctor&#x27;s companion Clara Oswald. Warner also appeared in the second series of the Sky 1 comedy-drama &quot;Mad Dogs&quot;, and starred in two 2014 episodes of the horror series &quot;Penny Dreadful&quot; as Abraham Van Helsing.

Warner contributed &quot;Sonnet 25&quot; to the 2002 compilation album &quot;When Love Speaks&quot;, which consists of Shakespearean sonnets and play excerpts as interpreted by famous actors and musicians. He performed in many audio plays, starring in the &quot;Doctor Who Unbound&quot; play &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; (2003) as an alternative version of the Doctor, and in a series of plays based on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Sapphire &amp; Steel&quot; as Steel, both for Big Finish Productions. He reprised his incarnation of the Doctor in a sequel, &quot;Masters of War&quot; (2008). In 2007, he guest starred as Isaac Newton in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio drama &quot;Circular Time &quot;and as Cuthbert in four of the seven stories in the second Fourth Doctor series. He also guest starred in the BBC Radio 4 science fiction comedy &quot;Nebulous&quot; (2005) as Professor Nebulous&#x27; arch-enemy Dr. Joseph Klench. In all these productions, Warner worked with writer and comedian Mark Gatiss of the &quot;League of Gentlemen&quot;, and plays a guest role in the League&#x27;s 2005 feature film &quot;The League of Gentlemen&#x27;s Apocalypse&quot;. He also performed in radio plays for the American companies L.A. Theatre Works and the Hollywood Theater of the Ear. In 2005, Warner read a new adaptation of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; for BBC Radio 2 (adapted by Neville Teller and directed by Neil Gardner). In 2008, he guest-starred as Mycroft Holmes in the Bernice Summerfield audio play &quot;The Adventure of the Diogenes Damsel&quot;. In 2009, he was the voice of Lord Azlok of the Viperox, an insectoid alien race in the animated &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Dreamland&quot;. In 2016, he returned as his alternate Doctor in a series of audios where his Doctor briefly travels to the &#x27;prime&#x27; universe and enlists the Seventh Doctor&#x27;s companion Benny Summerfield (Lisa Bowerman) to try and help him save his universe. Warner&#x27;s Doctor continued his travels with Benny in a second series of audios released in 2017. Shortly before his death in 2022 it was revealed he would return as his alternate Doctor as part of Finish&#x27;s celebration of the 60th anniversary and would share scenes with Christopher Eccleston who appeared as the Ninth Doctor.
He also contributed voice acting to a number of video games, notably playing the villain Jon Irenicus in &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Shadows of Amn&quot; and Morpheus in &quot;Fallout&quot;. Warner did voice work on the short-lived FOX animated series &quot;Toonsylvania&quot; as Dr. Vic Frankenstein. He was also the first voice of the demon Nergal from &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot;, but was later replaced by Martin Jarvis. Warner narrated the Disney direct-to-video &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin&quot;.

In March 2010, it was announced that Warner would be joining the cast of the &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; audio drama miniseries &quot;Kingdom of the Dead&quot;.

===Return to theatre and later work===
In 2001, Warner returned to the stage after a nearly three-decade hiatus to play Andrew Undershaft in a Broadway revival of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Major Barbara&quot;. In May 2005, at the Chichester Festival Theatre Warner made a return to Shakespeare, playing the title role in Steven Pimlott&#x27;s production of &quot;King Lear&quot;. Tim Walker, reviewing the performance in &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, wrote: &quot;Warner is physically the least imposing king I have ever seen, but his slight, gaunt body serves also to accentuate the vulnerability the part requires. So, too, does the fact that he is older by decades than most of the other members of the youthful cast.&quot;

On 30 October 2005, he appeared on stage at The Old Vic theatre in London in the one-night play &quot;Night Sky&quot; alongside Christopher Eccleston, Bruno Langley, Navin Chowdhry, Saffron Burrows and David Baddiel. In December 2006, he starred in &quot;Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Hogfather&quot; on Sky One as Lord Downey. And in August 2007, as an RSC Honorary Artist, he returned to Stratford for the first time in over 40 years to play Sir John Falstaff in the Courtyard Theatre revival of &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; and &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; which were part of the RSC Histories Cycle.

In February 2008, Warner was heard as the popular fictional character Hugo Rune in a new 13-part audio adaptation of Robert Rankin&#x27;s &quot;The Brightonomicon&quot; released by Hokus Bloke Productions and BBC Audiobooks. He starred alongside some high-profile names including cult science fiction actress and Superman star Sarah Douglas, Rupert Degas, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; actor Andy Serkis, Harry Potter villain Jason Isaacs, Mark Wing-Davey and Martin Jarvis (written by Elliott Stein &amp; Neil Gardner, and produced/directed by Neil Gardner).

In October 2008, Warner played the role of Lord Mountbatten of Burma in the BBC Four television film &quot;In Love with Barbara&quot;, a biopic about the life of romantic novelist Barbara Cartland. He played Povel Wallander, the father of Kurt Wallander, in BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Wallander&quot;.

===Other work===

In 2010, writer and actor Mark Gatiss interviewed Warner about his role in &quot;The Omen&quot; (1976) for his BBC documentary series &quot;A History of Horror&quot;. In November 2013, David Warner posed for Rory Lewis Photographers &#x27;Northerners&#x27; Exhibition, David&#x27;s image was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery in London, and was the first professional portrait sitting of David since 1966.

==Personal life==
Warner married his first wife Harriet Lindgren in 1969. They divorced three years later in 1972. He married his second wife Sheilah Kent in 1979. The marriage lasted for 26 years, until their divorce in 2005. They had a daughter in 1982 named Melissa. Warner&#x27;s partner until his death in 2022 was the actress Lisa Bowerman.

==Death==
Having been diagnosed with cancer 18 months prior, which he had kept private, Warner died of a cancer-related illness at Denville Hall, in Northwood, London, on 24 July 2022, aged 80.

<doc id="174457" wikidata="Q1427558" url="?curid=174457" title="Moller M400 Skycar">
<text>The Moller Skycar is a flying car with VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) capability which has been under development by Paul Moller for over fifty years. As of 2023, the M400 has not achieved free flight.

Due to the project&#x27;s failure to deliver and associated financial issues, Moller has been accused of deliberate fraud. The parent company, Moller International, has been dormant since 2015.

==Description==
The M400 is a four-seat flying car, a type of VTOL personal air vehicle described by Moller as a &quot;volantor&quot; Skycar models from single-seat up to six-seat accommodation have also been envisaged. It is intended to be flyable by anyone who can drive, incorporating automated flight controls, with the driver only inputting direction and speed required.

The body of the M400 comprises a fairly conventional four-seat ground vehicle, which is expected to provide some aerodynamic lift in forward flight. Folding wings and a large, fixed horizontal stabilizer provide the main lifting surfaces, although early prototypes had no wing fitted. VTOL lift and forward thrust in the air are provided by four pivoting ducted fan pods which deflect air vertically for takeoff and horizontally for forward flight. The pods enclose the propellers and engines, which are direct-coupled, and have movable deflector vanes at the rear to provide additional thrust vectoring.

The Skycar is not intended to be piloted like a traditional fixed wing airplane, and would have limited pilot controls, which the pilot uses to inform the computer control system of the desired flight maneuvers.

===Rotapower engines===
The Rotapower engines used in the prototypes are being developed by an affiliate Moller company called Freedom Motors. Each power unit comprises a Wankel rotary engine directly driving a ducted fan. The housing is lined with Kevlar to contain the fan blades in the event of failure. The Skycar has four such nacelles, each with two Rotapower engines mounted in tandem. All eight engines operate independently under computer control and, as demonstrated during a tethered flight, allow for a vertical controlled landing should any one engine fail.

The Rotapower engine is based on a rotary engine developed by Outboard Marine Corporation (OMC) in the 1970s and is claimed to be able to run on various fuels including gasoline, diesel, methanol, and clean renewable ethanol. Earlier Rotapower models used gasoline. On November 1, 2013 Moller announced that the 530 cc Rotapower engine had achieved using alcohol (ethanol) on their test stand, yielding an effective 3 horsepower per pound (5 kW/kg) of weight.

Like the M400 itself, the Rotapower engine has never entered production.

==History==

After forty years and $100,000,000 in expenditure the Skycar demonstrated tethered hovering capability in 2003. It has been extensively marketed for pre-order sale since the 1990s as Moller attempted to raise more money for development.

In 2003, hover tests were performed by a Skycar prototype that for insurance reasons was tethered, but not hung, to a crane.

===Setbacks===
In 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Moller for civil fraud &quot;(Securities And Exchange Commission v. Moller International, Inc., and Paul S. Moller, Defendants)&quot; in connection with the sale of unregistered stock, and for making unsubstantiated claims about the performance of the Skycar, even though Moller&#x27;s statements had passed the review and received &quot;cleared comments&quot; from the SEC during the filing and public information phase prior to being listed as a publicly traded company. Without admitting any wrongdoing, Moller agreed to pay $50,000 to settle the matter quickly so as not to delay the initial public offering of the stock. In the words of the SEC complaint, &quot;As of late 2002, MI&#x27;s approximately 40 years&#x27; of development has resulted in a prototype Skycar capable of hovering about fifteen feet above the ground.&quot; The shareholders of Moller International banded together to form a group known as &quot;Shareholders of Moller International (&quot;SoMI&quot;),

In October 2006, Moller attempted to auction the only prototype of its M200X model on eBay. It failed to sell. The highest bid was $3,000,100; Moller reported at the annual meeting of stockholders on October 21, 2006 in Davis, California, that the reserve price had been $3,500,000. A previous attempt in 2003 to sell the M400 via eBay was also unsuccessful, as were two subsequent attempts to sell the M400 prototype on eBay in July 2017.

On May 18, 2009, Paul Moller filed for personal protection under the Chapter 11 reorganization provisions of the federal bankruptcy law and it is unknown how this will affect the fate of his ideas; Moller International itself did not file for bankruptcy but reduced operations.

On June 21, 2011 Moller International applied for Experimental Airworthiness Certification of the M400 Skycar with the FAA who accepted the application. Demonstration flight plans were scheduled for October 2011 and a flight test consultant was maintained by Moller International. However, no demonstration flight ever occurred.

===Refinancing===
A memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed in January 2013 between Moller International and a US-China and e-business network agreeing to the goal of developing production for Moller Skycars in the United States and the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

As of October 2015 nothing further has been reported on developments of this previously announced joint venture despite Moller International&#x27;s January 2013 press release having stated the following:
&quot;The JV will initially invest $80 million (USD) of a planned $480 million investment with the objective of producing a variety of VTOL aircraft by 2014.&quot;

On November 5, 2013 Moller kicked off a crowdfunding campaign with an official announcement on the &quot;Happening Now&quot; program on Fox News Channel in the US. He subsequently followed the broadcast announcement with a press release and a radio-broadcast announcement on the &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; radio program with host John B. Wells interviewing Moller for 2 hours.

The campaign was formulated to raise money to further develop the systems to fly the Skycar without a tether and with a pilot on-board - something that Moller had yet to accomplish with the flights that had been conducted to date with the M400X prototype vehicle. Moller launched a donation-only crowdfunding campaign - not subject to SEC scrutiny - and promised to provide gifts and other items to donors, included a ride in the M400X as the top gift of the campaign. The Moller crowdfunding campaign ended on January 4, 2014 and raised a total of US$29,429.00 from 188 funders, far short of its $950,000 goal.

===Cessation of operations===
As explained in a Freedom Motors newsletter from August 2019, Moller International has been dormant since 2015. Shares of Moller International were revoked by the SEC in September 2019.

==Criticism==
The Skycar has never achieved free flight. The ongoing lack of funding for the Moller company to actually fly the M400 led the &quot;National Post&quot; to characterize the Skycar as a &#x27;failure&#x27;. The management of the company and the inability to bring a product to market draws the most ire from commentators.

<text>Tomme (), occasionally spelled Tome, is a class of cheeses produced mainly in the French Alps and in Switzerland. It can be made from cow&#x27;s, ewe&#x27;s, or goat&#x27;s milk. Tommes are normally produced from the skimmed milk left over after the cream has been removed to produce butter and richer cheeses, or when there is too little milk to produce a full cheese. As a result, they are generally low in fat. However, Tomme de Boudane and Tomme de Revard can contain as much as 20–40% fat. Tomme cheeses date back to ancient history.

There are many varieties of Tommes, which are usually identified by their place of origin. The most famous of these is Tomme de Savoie. Other Tommes include Tomme Boudane, Tomme au Fenouil, Tomme de Crayeuse, Tomme d&#x27;Aydius, Tomme de Grandmère, Tomme Affinée and Tomme du Revard. Tomme de Montagne is a collective term for the upland varieties, e.g., Tomme de Savoie but not Tomme de Beaujolais. An Italian product spelled Toma or Tuma originates from the area between Val d&#x27;Aoste and Ventimiglia, and is usually made from cow&#x27;s milk.

Tomme fraîche is traditionally used to make aligot, an Auvergnat dish combining melted cheese and mashed potatoes.

<doc id="174467" wikidata="Q333206" url="?curid=174467" title="Yonhap News Agency">
<text>Yonhap News Agency (; ) is a major South Korean news agency. It is based in Seoul, South Korea. Yonhap provides news articles, pictures, and other information to newspapers, TV networks and other media in South Korea.

==History==
Yonhap was established on 19 December 1980, through the merger of Hapdong News Agency and Orient Press. The Hapdong News Agency itself emerged in late 1945 out of the short-lived Kukje News, which had operated for two months out of the office of the Domei, the former Japanese news agency that had functioned in Korea during the Japanese Japanese colonial era.

In 1999, Yonhap took over the Naewoe News Agency. Naewoe was a South Korea government-affiliated organization, created in the mid 1970s, tasked with publishing information and analysis on North Korea from a South Korean perspective through books and journals. Naewoe was known to have close links with South Korea&#x27;s intelligence agency, and according to the British academic and historian James Hoare, Naowoe&#x27;s publications became &quot;less partisan after the late 1980s and are often useful source of information on North Korea&quot;. In 1999, Naewoe merged with Yonhap News Agency, with materials on North Korea continued to be &quot;distributed for free as part of the government&#x27;s propaganda effort&quot;. According to the U.S. Library of Congress, &quot;Originally a propaganda vehicle that followed the government line on unification policy issued, Naowae Press became increasingly objective and moderate in tone in the mid-1980s in interpreting political, social, and economic developments in North Korea&quot;. Naowae&#x27;s principal publication was the monthly magazine &quot;Vantage Point: Developments in North Korea&quot;, which continued to be published by Yonhap until its discontinuation in 2016.

==Activity==
Yonhap maintains various agreements with 90 non-Korean news agencies, and also has a services-exchange agreement with North Korea&#x27;s Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) agency, signed in 2002. It is the only Korean wire service that works with foreign news agencies, and provides a limited but freely-available selection of news on its website in Korean, English, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, Arabic, and French.

Yonhap is South Korea&#x27;s only news agency large enough to have some 60 correspondents abroad and 600 reporters across the nation. Its largest shareholder is the Korea News Agency Commission (KONAC). Yonhap was the host news agency of the 1988 Seoul Summer Olympics, and was elected twice to the board of the Organization of Asia-Pacific News Agencies (OANA). In 2021, Yonhap partnered with the production company &quot;Victory Contents&quot; for a Korean drama screenplay contest.

In 2003, the South Korean government passed a law giving financial and systematic assistance to the agency, to reinforce staff and provide equipment. In the legislation, it was also given the role of “promoting the country&#x27;s image” to an international audience. The head of the Yonhap agency is usually affiliated with the government, which critics say harms press freedom and influences news-gathering. However, it is government affiliation, rather than press laws (which are supportive of press freedom), which is said to be the cause of any limitations, though the agency does criticise the government.

==Journalists==
Yonhap employs about 600 reporters. It has some 60 correspondents in 26 countries. Yonhap is one of few Korean news organizations with a section specialized in North Korea reports. In 1998, Yonhap acquired from the National Intelligence Service a news wire service monitoring North Korean media and analyzing North Korea–related information. Yonhap incorporated the firm and its staff into the newsroom, creating a special division (often referred to as the &#x27;N.K. news desk&#x27;) to improve its reporting on North Korea. In January 2009, two reporters from the N.K. news desk disclosed that Kim Jong Un had been chosen as heir apparent to North Korea&#x27;s longtime leader, Kim Jong Il. Later, in 2010, the reporters won the grand journalism award for the exclusive story from the Korean Journalist Association. It was the first time in nine years that the association had awarded the prize.

==The Cho Gye-chang award==
The Korean Journalist Association in 2010 established the Cho Gye-chang Journalism Award for achievement in international news reporting to commemorate Cho Gye-chang, the former Yonhap correspondent in Shenyang, China. Cho was killed in a car crash in December 2008 on the way back, after having conducted an interview with a Korean-Chinese academic. He was assigned to Shenyang in 2006 as the first South Korean correspondent in the northern Chinese city. Cho was widely admired as an ardent news writer who focused on North Korean affairs and Korean-Chinese communities. On the first anniversary of his demise, Korean-Chinese organizations and local journalists paid tribute to him as a &quot;truly hardworking reporter with great professionalism&quot;. Cho&#x27;s death marked the first time that Yonhap had lost a reporter on an international assignment.

<text>Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra (GSO; ) is a Swedish symphony orchestra based in Gothenburg. The GSO is resident at the Gothenburg Concert Hall at Götaplatsen. The orchestra received the title of the National Orchestra of Sweden () in 1997. 

==Background and history==
The GSO was founded in 1905, with Heinrich Hammer as its first principal conductor. The composer Wilhelm Stenhammar was the orchestra&#x27;s second principal conductor, from 1907 to 1922. In addition to Stenhammar conducting his own works, Jean Sibelius and Carl Nielsen made regular guest-conducting appearances with the GSO. The orchestra&#x27;s fortunes waxed and waned in subsequent years, until the advent of Neeme Järvi as principal conductor, from 1982 to 2004. Although the GSO has a broad repertoire, it has a special affinity for the works of the Nordic Late Romantic composers, such as Jean Sibelius and Edvard Grieg. During Järvi&#x27;s tenure as principal conductor, the longest tenure of any principal conductor in the GSO&#x27;s history, its reputation on the world stage was greatly increased, including sponsorships from Volvo and a recording contract with Deutsche Grammophon. Järvi currently holds the title of Principal Conductor Emeritus (&quot;Chefdirigent Emeritus&quot;) with the GSO.

Gustavo Dudamel was principal conductor of the GSO from 2007 to 2012, and now has the title of &quot;hedersdirigent&quot; (honorary conductor) of the GSO. Past principal guest conductors of the GSO have included Norman del Mar, who was Permanent Guest Conductor from 1968 to 1973, and Christian Zacharias. Kent Nagano became principal guest conductor and artistic advisor of the GSO as of the 2013–2014 season, with an initial contract of three years. 

In August 2014, Santtu-Matias Rouvali first guest-conducted the GSO. In May 2016, the GSO announced the appointment of Rouvali as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2017–2018 season, with an initial contract of four years. In May 2019, the GSO announced the extension of Rouvali&#x27;s contract through 2025. In December 2023, the GSO announced that Rouvali is to stand down as its chief conductor at the close of the 2024-2025 season.

In 2019, Barbara Hannigan became principal guest conductor of the GSO, the first female conductor to be named to the post. Her current GSO contract in this post is through 2028. In October 2024, the GSO announced the appointment of Pekka Kuusisto as its additional principal guest conductor, effective with the 2025-2026 season, to serve alongside Hannigan in the post.

In addition to Deutsche Grammophon, the orchestra has recorded commercially for such labels as BIS.

<doc id="174471" wikidata="Q48922" url="?curid=174471" title="Orlando Furioso">
<text>Orlando furioso (; &quot;The Frenzy of Orlando&quot;) is an Italian epic poem by Ludovico Ariosto which has exerted a wide influence on later culture. The earliest version appeared in 1516, although the poem was not published in its complete form until 1532. &quot;Orlando furioso&quot; is a continuation of Matteo Maria Boiardo&#x27;s unfinished romance &quot;Orlando innamorato&quot; (&quot;Orlando in Love&quot;, published posthumously in 1495). In its historical setting and characters, it shares some features with the Old French &quot;La Chanson de Roland&quot; of the eleventh century, which tells of the death of Roland. The story is also a chivalric romance which stemmed from a tradition beginning in the late Middle Ages and continuing in popularity in the 16th century and well into the 17th.

Orlando is the Christian knight known in French (and subsequently English) as Roland. The story takes place against the background of the war between Charlemagne&#x27;s Christian paladins and the Saracen army that has invaded Europe and is attempting to overthrow the Christian empire. The poem is about knights and ladies, war and love, and the romantic ideal of chivalry. It mixes realism and fantasy, humor and tragedy. The stage is the entire world, plus a trip to the Moon. The large cast of characters features Christians and Saracens, soldiers and sorcerers, and fantastic creatures including a gigantic sea monster called the Orc and a flying horse called the hippogriff. Many themes are interwoven in its complicated episodic structure, but the most important are the paladin Orlando&#x27;s unrequited love for the pagan princess Angelica, which drives him mad; the love between the female Christian warrior Bradamante and the Saracen Ruggiero, who are supposed to be the ancestors of Ariosto&#x27;s patrons, the House of Este of Ferrara; and the war between Christian and Infidel.

The poem is divided into forty-six cantos, each containing a variable number of eight-line stanzas in &quot;ottava rima&quot; (a rhyme scheme of abababcc). &quot;Ottava rima&quot; had been used in previous Italian romantic epics, including Luigi Pulci&#x27;s &quot;Morgante&quot; and Boiardo&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Innamorato&quot;. Ariosto&#x27;s work is 38,736 lines long in total, making it one of the longest poems in European literature.

==Composition and publication==
Ariosto began working on the poem around 1506, when he was 32. The first edition of the poem, in 40 cantos, was published in Ferrara in April 1516 and dedicated to the poet&#x27;s patron Ippolito d&#x27;Este. A second edition appeared in 1521 with minor revisions.

Ariosto continued to write more material for the poem and in the 1520s he produced five more cantos, marking a further development of his poetry, which he decided not to include in the final edition. They were published after his death by his illegitimate son Virginio under the title &quot;Cinque canti&quot; and are highly regarded by some modern critics. The third and final version of &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;, containing 46 cantos, appeared in 1532.

Ariosto had sought stylistic advice from the humanist Pietro Bembo to give his verse the last degree of polish and this is the version known to posterity.

The first English translation by John Harington was published in 1591 at the behest of Queen Elizabeth I, who reportedly banned Harington from court until the translation was complete.

==Ariosto and Boiardo==
Ariosto&#x27;s poem is a sequel to Matteo Maria Boiardo&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Innamorato&quot; (&quot;Orlando in Love&quot;). One of Boiardo&#x27;s main achievements was his fusion of the Matter of France (the tradition of stories about Charlemagne and paladins such as Roland) with the Matter of Britain (the legends about King Arthur and his knights). The latter contained the magical elements and love interest that were generally lacking in the more austere and warlike poems about Carolingian heroes.

Ariosto continued to mix these elements in his poem as well as adding material derived from Classical sources. However, Ariosto has an ironic tone rarely present in Boiardo, who treated the ideals of chivalry much more seriously. In &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;, instead of the chivalric ideals which were no longer current in the 16th century, a humanistic conception of man and life is vividly celebrated under the appearance of a fantastical world, notwithstanding his early modern approaches to feminism.

==Plot==
The action of &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; takes place against the background of the war between the Christian emperor Charlemagne and the Saracen king of Africa, , who has invaded Europe to avenge the death of his father Troiano. Agramante and his allies – who include Marsilio, the King of Spain, and the boastful warrior Rodomonte – besiege Charlemagne in Paris.

Meanwhile, Orlando, Charlemagne&#x27;s most famous paladin, has been tempted to forget his duty to protect the emperor because of his love for the pagan princess Angelica. At the beginning of the poem, Angelica escapes from the castle of the Bavarian Duke Namo, and Orlando sets off in pursuit. The two meet with various adventures until Angelica comes across a wounded Saracen infantryman on the verge of death, Medoro. She nurses him back to health, falls in love, and elopes with him to Cathay.

When Orlando learns the truth, by finding the pair&#x27;s secret garden of love, or &quot;Locus Amoenus,&quot; he goes mad with despair and rampages through Europe and Africa destroying everything in his path, and thus demonstrates the frenzy that the title suggests. The English knight Astolfo journeys to Ethiopia on the hippogriff to find a cure for Orlando&#x27;s madness.

He flies up in Elijah&#x27;s flaming chariot to the Moon, where everything lost on Earth is to be found, including Orlando&#x27;s wits. He brings them back in a bottle and makes Orlando sniff them, thus restoring him to sanity. (At the same time Orlando falls out of love with Angelica, as the author explains that love is itself a form of insanity.)

Orlando joins with Brandimarte and Oliver to fight Agramante, Sobrino and Gradasso on the island of Lampedusa. There Orlando kills King Agramante.

Another important plotline involves the love between the female Christian warrior Bradamante and the Saracen Ruggiero. They too have to endure many vicissitudes.

Ruggiero is taken captive by the sorceress Alcina and has to be freed from her magic island. He then rescues Angelica from the orc. He also has to avoid the enchantments of his foster father, the wizard Atlante, who does not want him to fight or see the world outside of his iron castle, because looking into the stars it is revealed that if Ruggiero converts himself to Christianity, he will die. He does not know this, so when he finally gets the chance to marry Bradamante, as they had been looking for each other through the entire poem although something always separated them, he converts to Christianity and marries Bradamante.

Rodomonte appears at the wedding feast, nine days after the wedding, and accuses him of being a traitor to the Saracen cause, and the poem ends with a duel between Rodomonte and Ruggiero. Ruggiero kills Rodomonte (Canto XLVI, stanza 140) and the final lines of the poem describe Rodomonte&#x27;s spirit leaving the world. Ruggiero and Bradamante are the ancestors of the House of Este, Ariosto&#x27;s patrons, whose genealogy he gives at length in canto 3 of the poem.

The epic contains many other characters, including Orlando&#x27;s cousin, the paladin Rinaldo, who is also in love with Angelica; the thief Brunello; the Saracen Ferraù; Sacripante, King of Circassia and a leading Saracen knight; and the tragic heroine Isabella.

==Influence==

===Later literature===
&quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; is &quot;one of the most influential works in the whole of European literature&quot; and it remains an inspiration for writers to this day.

A few years before Ariosto&#x27;s death, the poet Teofilo Folengo published his &quot;Orlandino&quot;, a caricaturization of the stories found in both &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; and its precursor, &quot;Orlando Innamorato&quot;.

In 1554, Laura Terracina wrote the &quot;Discorso sopra il Principio di tutti i canti d&#x27;Orlando furioso&quot; which was linked to &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; and in which several of the characters appeared.

&quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; was a major influence on Edmund Spenser&#x27;s epic &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;. William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; takes one of its plots (Hero/Claudio/Don John) from &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; (probably via Spenser or Bandello). In 1592, Robert Greene published a play called &quot;The Historie of Orlando Furioso&quot;. According to Barbara Reynolds, the English poet closest in spirit to Ariosto is Lord Byron.

In Spain, Lope de Vega wrote a continuation of the epic (&quot;La hermosura de Angélica&quot;, 1602) as did Luis Barahona de Soto (&quot;Las lágrimas de Angélica&quot;, 1586). Góngora wrote a famous poem describing the idyllic honeymoon of Angelica and Medoro (&quot;En un pastoral albergue&quot;). &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; is mentioned among the romances in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. Among the interpolated stories within &quot;Don Quixote&quot; is a retelling of a tale from canto 43 regarding a man who tests the fidelity of his wife. Additionally, various literary critics have noted the poem&#x27;s likely influence on Garcilaso de la Vega&#x27;s second eclogue.

In France, Jean de la Fontaine used the plots of some of the bawdier episodes for three of his &quot;Contes et Nouvelles en vers&quot; (1665–66).

In chapter 11 of Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;Rob Roy&quot; published in 1817, but set circa 1715, Mr. Francis Osbaldistone talks of completing &quot;my unfinished version of &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;, a poem which I longed to render into English verse...&quot;.

The modern Russian poet Osip Mandelstam paid tribute to &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; in his poem &quot;Ariosto&quot; (1933).

The Italian novelist Italo Calvino drew on Ariosto for several of his works of fiction including &quot;Il cavaliere inesistente&quot; (&quot;The Nonexistent Knight&quot;, 1959) and &quot;Il castello dei destini incrociati&quot; (&quot;The Castle of Crossed Destinies&quot;, 1973). In 1970 Calvino brought out his own selection of extracts from the poem.

The Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges was an admirer of &quot;Orlando&quot; and included a poem, &quot;Ariosto y los árabes&quot; (&quot;Ariosto and the Arabs&quot;), exploring the relationship between the epic and the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, in his 1960 collection &quot;El hacedor&quot;. Borges also chose Attilio Momigliano&#x27;s critical study of the work as one of the hundred volumes that were to make up his &quot;Personal Library&quot;.

The English novelist Anthony Powell&#x27;s &quot;Hearing Secret Harmonies&quot; includes images from &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; to open chapter two. &quot;Hearing Secret Harmonies&quot; is the final book in Powell&#x27;s twelve-volume series, &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot;.

British writer Salman Rushdie&#x27;s 2008 novel &quot;The Enchantress of Florence&quot; was partly inspired by &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;.

===Popular fiction===
Bradamante is one of the main characters in several novels, including Linda C. McCabe&#x27;s &quot;Quest of the Warrior Maiden&quot;, Ron Miller&#x27;s &quot;Bradamant: The Iron Tempest&quot; and Ruth Berman&#x27;s &quot;Bradamant&#x27;s Quest&quot;.

Science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon&#x27;s 1954 short story &quot;To Here and the Easel&quot; is an assembly of portions of the Orlando story intermixed with a current-day recasting of the story into the lives of a painter suffering from artist&#x27;s block (Ruggiero/Rogero and his analog Giles), a mysterious faithful supporter (Bradamante and her analog Miss Brandt) and her jaded, fabulously wealthy employer (Angelica appearing as an echo more than an analog) and Giles&#x27; redemption (breaking his blockage) at the hands of Miss Brandt. The story first appeared in 1954 in &quot;Star Short Novels&quot; (a Ballantine collection which was not reprinted), and was republished as the first story in the collection &quot;Sturgeon Is Alive And Well...&quot; in 1971.

&quot;The Castle of Iron&quot;, a fantasy novel by L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt, takes place in the &quot;universe&quot; of &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;. It was the third story (and afterwards the second volume) in their Harold Shea series.

===Music===
In the Baroque era, the poem was the basis of many operas. Among the earliest were Francesca Caccini&#x27;s &quot;La liberazione di Ruggiero dall&#x27;isola d&#x27;Alcina&quot; (&quot;The Liberation of Ruggiero from Alcina&#x27;s Island&quot;, 1625), Luigi Rossi&#x27;s &quot;Il palazzo incantato&quot; (1642) and Agostino Steffani&#x27;s &quot;Orlando generoso&quot; (1691). Antonio Vivaldi, as an impresario as well as a composer, staged three operas on themes from Ariosto: &quot;Orlando furioso&quot; (1713) by Giovanni Alberto Ristori, &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; (1714), with music by Ristori and by himself, and &quot;Orlando&quot; (1727). Perhaps the most famous operas inspired by the poem are those by Handel: &quot;Orlando&quot; (1733), &quot;Ariodante&quot; and &quot;Alcina&quot; (1735). In France, Jean-Baptiste Lully turned to Ariosto for his &quot;tragédie en musique Roland&quot; (1685). Rameau&#x27;s comic opera &quot;Les Paladins&quot; (1760) is based on a story in canto 18 of &quot;Orlando&quot; (though Rameau&#x27;s librettist derived the plot indirectly via La Fontaine&#x27;s &quot;Contes&quot;). The enthusiasm for operas based on Ariosto continued into the Classical era and beyond with such examples as Johann Adolph Hasse’s &quot;Il Ruggiero&quot; (1771), Niccolò Piccinni&#x27;s &quot;Roland&quot; (1778), Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Orlando paladino&quot; (1782), Méhul&#x27;s &quot;Ariodant&quot; (1799) and Simon Mayr&#x27;s &quot;Ginevra di Scozia&quot; (1801). Ambroise Thomas wrote a comedic one-act, &quot;Angélique et Médor&quot;, in 1843.

===Art===
&quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; has been the inspiration for many works of art, including paintings by Eugène Delacroix, Tiepolo, Ingres, Redon, and a series of illustrations by Gustave Doré.

In his poem Ludovico Ariosto relates how Marphise, the woman warrior, knocks the knight Pinabello off his horse after his lady had mocked Marphise&#x27;s companion, the old woman Gabrina. In &quot;Marphise&quot; by Eugène Delacroix, Pinabello lies on the ground, and his horse gallops off in the distance. The knight&#x27;s lady, meanwhile, is forced to disrobe and give her fancy clothing to Gabrina. Marphise&#x27;s horse, undisturbed by the drama, nonchalantly munches on the leaves overhead.

===Other===
In 1975, Luca Ronconi directed an Italian television mini-series based on &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;, starring Massimo Foschi (it) as Orlando, and Ottavia Piccolo as Angelica.

In the late 1960s / early 1970s, the Bob and Ray comedy parody radio show &quot;Mary Backstayge, Noble Wife&quot; centered around the Backstayge&#x27;s stage production of the fictional play &quot;Westchester Furioso&quot;, an updating of &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; that somehow involved musical numbers, tap dancing and ping pong.

In 1966, Italian Disney comics artist Luciano Bottaro wrote a parody of &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; starring Donald Duck, &quot;Paperin Furioso&quot;. In the film &quot;Moonstruck&quot; there is a reference to one of the character&#x27;s rejuvenation as a lover as feeling like &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;.

Emanuele Luzzati&#x27;s animated short film, &quot;I paladini di Francia&quot;, together with Giulio Gianini, in 1960, was turned into the children&#x27;s picture-story book, with verse narrative, &quot;I Paladini de Francia ovvero il tradimento di Gano di Maganz&quot;, which translates literally as “The Paladins of France or the treachery of Gano of Maganz” (Ugo Mursia Editore, 1962). This was then republished, in English, as &quot;Ronald and the Wizard Calico&quot; (1969). The Picture Lion paperback edition (William Collins, London, 1973) is a paperback imprint of the Hutchinson Junior Books edition (1969), which credits the English translation to Hutchinson Junior Books.

Luzatti&#x27;s original verse story in Italian is about the plight of a beautiful maiden called Biancofiore – White Flower, or Blanchefleur – and her brave hero, Captain Rinaldo, and Ricardo and his paladins – the term used for Christian knights engaged in Crusades against the Saracens and Moore. Battling with these good people are the wicked Moors – North African Muslims and Arabs – and their Sultan, in Jerusalem. With the assistance of the wicked and treacherous magician, Gano of Maganz, Biancofiore is stolen from her fortress castle, and taken to become the reluctant wife of the Sultan. The catalyst for victory is the good magician, Urlubulu, who lives in a lake, and flies through the air on the back of his magic blue bird. The English translators, using the original illustrations, and the basic rhyme patterns, slightly simplify the plot, changing the Christians-versus-Muslim-Moors conflict into a battle between good and bad magicians and between golden knights and green knights. The French traitor in &quot;The Song of Roland&quot;, who is actually Roland&#x27;s cowardly step-father, is Ganelon – very likely the inspiration for Luzzati&#x27;s traitor and wicked magician, Gano. Orlando Furioso (literally, Furious or Enraged Orlando, or Roland), includes Orlando&#x27;s cousin, the paladin Rinaldo, who, like Orlando, is also in love with Angelica, a pagan princess. Rinaldo is, of course, the Italian equivalent of Ronald. Flying through the air on the back of a magic bird is equivalent to flying on a magic hippogriff.

In 2014, Enrico Maria Giglioli created &quot;Orlando&#x27;s Wars: lotta tra cavalieri&quot;, a trading card game with characters and situations of the poem, divided in four categories: Knight, Maiden, Wizard and Fantastic Creature.

The poem appears as a Great Work of Literature in the video game &quot;Civilization V&quot;.

In the South Korean video game &quot;Library of Ruina&quot;, several characters are named after characters from the poem and Innamorato-Roland is a protagonist, his deceased wife is named Angelica, and his brother-in-law and a major antagonist is named Argalia.

Astolfo appears as a servant in &quot;Fate/Apocrypha&quot; and &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot;, with multiple references to his depictions within the poem. 

The word rodomontade, meaning boastful or inflated talk or behavior, entered the English language in the early 1600s from Italian. It is based on this work&#x27;s boastful warrior, Rodomonte.

== Analysis ==
&quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; won immediate fame. Around the middle of the 16th century, some Italian critics such as Gian Giorgio Trissino complained that the poem failed to observe the unity of action as defined by Aristotle, by having multiple plots rather than a single main story. The French poet Pierre de Ronsard and the Italian poet Torquato Tasso both felt that &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; lacked structural unity. Ariosto&#x27;s defenders, such as Giovanni Battista Giraldi, replied that it was not a Classical epic but a &quot;romanzo&quot;, a genre unknown to Aristotle; therefore his standards were irrelevant. Nevertheless, the strictures of the Classical critics influenced the next great Italian epic, Torquato Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Gerusalemme Liberata&quot; (1581). Tasso tried to combine Ariosto&#x27;s freedom of invention with a more unified plot structure. In the following decades, Italian critics argued over the respective merits of the two epics. Partisans of &quot;Orlando&quot;, such as Galileo Galilei, praised its psychological realism and the naturalness of its language. In the 19th century, Hegel considered that the work&#x27;s many allegories and metaphors did not serve merely to refute the ideal of chivalry, but also to demonstrate the fallacy of human senses and judgment. Francesco de Sanctis and Attilio Momigliano (it) also wrote about &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;.

The story resembles the myth of Andromeda and Perseus, and in particular the scene where a woman is chained naked to a rock on the sea as a sacrifice to a sea monster, and is rescued at the last moment, is essentially indistinguishable.

==Translations==
There have been several verse translations of &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; into English, most using the 8-line stanzas (octaves) of the original (abababcc). The first one was by John Harington, published in 1591 and slightly revised in 1634. Temple Henry Croker&#x27;s translation, misattributed to William Huggins&#x27; and Henry Boyd&#x27;s translation were published in 1757 and 1784, respectively. John Hoole&#x27;s 1783 translation used rhyming couplets (AABBCC...). William Stewart Rose produced an eight-volume translation beginning publication in 1823 and ending in 1831. Barbara Reynolds published a verse translation in 1975, and an abridged verse translation by David Slavitt was published in 2009, which was then made complete by a second volume containing the lacunae missing from the abridgement, in 2012.

A few translations have also been made into prose. A. H. Gilbert&#x27;s translation was published by Duke University Press in 1954. Richard Hodgens planned a multivolume translation, whose first volume, subtitled &quot;The Ring of Angelica&quot;, was published by Ballantine Books as the fifty-fourth volume of its Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in January, 1973. The Ballantine Adult Fantasy series came to an end in 1974; no further volumes of the Hodgens translation were published. Guido Waldman&#x27;s complete prose translation was first published by Oxford University Press in 1973.

<doc id="174474" wikidata="Q1365588" url="?curid=174474" title="Synchronization gear">
<text>A synchronization gear (also known as a gun synchronizer or interrupter gear) was a device enabling a single-engine tractor configuration aircraft to fire its forward-firing armament through the arc of its spinning propeller without bullets striking the blades. This allowed the aircraft, rather than the gun, to be aimed at the target.

There were many practical problems, mostly arising from the inherently imprecise nature of an automatic gun&#x27;s firing, the great (and varying) velocity of the blades of a spinning propeller, and the very high speed at which any gear synchronizing the two had to operate. In practice, all known gears worked on the principle of actively triggering each shot, in the manner of a semi-automatic weapon.

Design and experimentation with gun synchronization had been underway in France and Germany in 1913–1914, following the ideas of August Euler, who seems to have been the first to suggest mounting a fixed armament firing in the direction of flight (in 1910). However, the first practicalif far from reliablegear to enter operational service was that fitted to the Fokker Eindecker fighters, which entered squadron service with the German Air Service in mid-1915. The success of the Eindecker led to numerous gun synchronization devices, culminating in the reasonably reliable hydraulic British Constantinesco gear of 1917. By the end of the First World War, German engineers were well on the way to perfecting a gear using an electrical rather than a mechanical or hydraulic link between the engine and the gun, with the gun triggered by an electro-mechanical solenoid.

From 1918 to the mid-1930s the standard armament for a fighter aircraft remained two synchronized rifle-calibre machine guns, firing forward through the arc of the propeller. In the late 1930s, however, the main role of the fighter was increasingly seen as the destruction of large, all-metal bombers, for which this armament was inadequate. Since it was impractical to fit more than two guns in the limited space available in the front of a single-engine aircraft&#x27;s fuselage, guns began to be mounted in the wings instead, firing outside the arc of the propeller so not requiring synchronising. Synchronizing became unnecessary on all aircraft with the introduction of propellerless jet propulsion.

== Nomenclature ==
A mechanism to enable an automatic weapon to fire between the blades of a whirling propeller is usually called an interrupter or synchronizer gear. Both these terms are more or less misleading, at least insofar as explaining what happens when the gear functions.

The term &quot;interrupter&quot; implies that the gear pauses, or &quot;interrupts&quot; the fire of the gun at the point where one of the blades of the propeller passes in front of its muzzle. Even the relatively slowly revolving propellers of First World War aircraft, however, typically turned twice or even three times for each shot a contemporary machine gun could fire. A two-bladed propeller would therefore obstruct the gun six times every firing cycle of the gun, a four-bladed one twelve times. A gun set up this way would be interrupted more than forty times per second, while firing at only around seven rounds per second. Unsurprisingly, the designers of so-called interrupter gears found this too problematic to be seriously attempted, as the gaps between &quot;interruptions&quot; would have been too short to allow the gun to fire at all.

True synchronization, though, with a machine gun&#x27;s rate of fire exactly proportional to the revolutions per minute of a spinning aircraft propeller, would require an impractical level of complexity. A machine gun normally fires a constant number of rounds a minute, and while this may be changed by modifying the gun, it cannot be varied at will while the gun is operating. The rate of rotation of an aircraft propeller, meanwhile, especially before the advent of the constant-speed propeller, could vary widely, depending on the throttle setting and what maneuvers were being performed. Even if it had been feasible to pick a particular point on an aircraft engine&#x27;s tachometer at which a machine gun&#x27;s cyclic rate would permit it to fire through the propeller arc, this would be very limiting.

It has been pointed out that any mechanism that achieved the feat of firing between the whirling blades of a propeller without striking them could be described as &quot;interrupting&quot; the fire of the gun (to the extent that it no longer actually works as an automatic weapon at all), and also as &quot;synchronizing&quot;, or &quot;timing&quot; its fire to coincide with the revolutions of the propeller.

== Components ==
A typical synchronizing gear had three basic components.

=== At the propeller ===
First, a method of determining the position of the propeller at a given instant was required. Typically, a cam, driven either directly from the propeller shaft itself, or from some part of the drive train revolving at the same speed as the propeller, generated a series of impulses at the same rate as the propeller&#x27;s revolutions. There were exceptions to this. Some gears placed the cam within the gun trigger mechanism itself, and the firing impulses were sometimes timed to occur at every two or three revolutions of the propeller, or, especially in the case of hydraulic or electric gears, at the rate of two or more for each revolution. The diagrams in this section assume, for simplicity&#x27;s sake, one impulse for one revolution, so that each synchronized round is &quot;aimed&quot; at a single spot on the propeller disc.

The timing of each impulse had to be adjusted to coincide with a &quot;safe&quot; period, when the blades of the propeller were well out of the way, and this adjustment had to be checked at intervals, especially if the propeller was changed or refitted, as well as after a major engine overhaul. Faults in this adjustment (for example, a cam wheel slipping a millimetre or two, or a pushrod flexing) could well result in &quot;every&quot; bullet fired hitting the propeller, a worse result than if the gun was fired through the propeller with no control at all. The other main type of failure resulted in fewer or no firing impulses, usually due to the generator or linkages either jamming or breaking. This was a common cause of synchronized guns &quot;jamming&quot;.

The speed of the propeller, and thus the distance that it travelled between the firing of the gun and the arrival of the bullet at the propeller disc, varied as the rate of engine revolutions changed. Where muzzle velocity was very high, and the guns were sited well forward so that the bullets had a very short distance to reach the disc of the propeller, this difference could be largely ignored. But in the case of relatively low muzzle velocity weapons, or any gun sited well back from the propeller, the question could become critical, and in some cases the pilot had to consult his tachometer, taking care that his engine revolutions were within a &quot;safe&quot; range before firing, otherwise risking speedy destruction of his propeller.

=== At the gun ===

The second requirement was for a gun that would reliably fire (or hold its fire) exactly when required. Not all automatic weapons were equally amenable to synchronization. When it was ready to fire, a synchronized machine-gun needed to have a round in the breech, the breech closed, and the action cocked (the so-called &quot;closed bolt&quot; position). Several widely used automatic weapons (notably the Lewis gun and the Italian Revelli) were triggered from an open bolt, with an unpredictable interval between triggering and firing, and were thus not suitable for synchronization without extensive modification.

In practice it was found necessary for the gun to be fired in semi-automatic mode. As the propeller revolved, a series of firing impulses was transmitted to the gun, each of which could trigger it to fire a single shot. The majority of these impulses would catch the gun in the process of ejecting a spent round or loading a fresh one, and would thus have no effect; but as soon as the firing cycle was completed, the gun would be ready to fire as soon as it received the next impulse from the synchronizing gear. The delay between the end of the firing cycle and the arrival of the next firing impulse slowed the rate of fire in comparison with a free-firing machine gun, which fires the moment it is ready to do so; but provided the gear functioned correctly, the gun could fire fairly rapidly between the whirling propeller blades without striking them.

Some other machine-guns, such as the Austrian Schwarzlose and the American Marlin, proved less than perfectly adapted to synchronization, although eventually predictable &quot;single shot&quot; firing was achieved, typically by modifying the trigger mechanism to emulate &quot;closed bolt&quot; firing. Most weapons that were successfully synchronized (at least in the First World War period) were (like the German Parabellum and Spandau guns and the British Vickers) based on the original Maxim gun of 1884, a closed bolt weapon operated by barrel recoil. Before these distinctions were fully understood, much time was wasted on attempts to synchronize unsuitable weapons.

Even a closed bolt weapon needed reliable ammunition. If the primer in a cartridge is faulty to the extent of delaying the firing of the gun for a tiny fraction of a second (quite a common case in practice with mass-produced ammunition) this is of little consequence in the case of a gun in use by infantry on the ground, but in the case of a synchronized &quot;aircraft&quot; gun such a delay can produce a rogue firing, sufficiently &quot;out of time&quot; for it to risk hitting the propeller. A very similar problem could arise where the mass of a special round (such as an incendiary or explosive one) was different enough to produce a substantial difference in muzzle velocity. This was compounded by the additional risk to the integrity of the propeller due to the nature of the round.

The &quot;trigger motor&quot; could theoretically take two forms. The earliest patent (Schneider 1913) assumed that the synchronization gear would periodically &quot;prevent the gun from firing&quot;, thus operating as a true, or literal &quot;interrupter&quot;. In practice all &quot;real-life&quot; synchronization gears, for which we have reliable technical details, directly &quot;fired the gun&quot;: operating it as if it were a semi-automatic weapon rather than a completely automatic one.

=== The linkage between propeller and gun ===
The third requirement is for a linkage between the &quot;machines&quot; (engine and gun) to be synchronized. Many early gears used an intricate and inherently fragile bell crank and push rod linkage that could easily jam or otherwise malfunction, especially when required to work at higher speeds than it had been designed for. There were several alternative methods, including an oscillating rod, a flexible drive, a column of hydraulic fluid, a cable, or an electrical connection.

Generally, mechanical systems were inferior to hydraulic or electric ones, but none were ever entirely foolproof, and synchronization gears at best always remained liable to occasional failure. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; ace Adolf Galland in his memoir of the war period &quot;The First and the Last&quot; describes a serious faulty synchronization incident in 1941.

== Rate of fire ==
A pilot would usually only have the target in his sights for a fleeting moment, so a concentration of bullets was vital for achieving a &quot;kill&quot;. Even flimsy First World War aircraft often took a surprisingly large number of hits to shoot down, and later, larger aircraft were even harder propositions. There were two obvious solutionsto fit a more efficient gun with a higher &quot;cyclic rate of fire&quot;, or increase the &quot;number of guns&quot; carried. Both of these measures impinged on the question of synchronization.

Early synchronized guns of the 1915–1917 period had a rate of fire in the region of 400 rounds per minute. At this comparatively leisurely rate of fire a synchronizer can be geared down to deliver a single firing impulse every two or three turns of the propeller, rendering it more reliable without unduly slowing the rate of fire. To control a faster gun, with, for example, a cyclic rate of 800 or 1,000 rounds a minute, it was necessary to supply at least one impulse (if not two) for every rotation of the propeller, making it more liable to failure. The intricate mechanism of a mechanical linkage system, especially of the &quot;push rod&quot; type, could easily shake itself to pieces when driven at this rate.

The final version of the Fokker Eindecker, the Fokker E.IV, came with two lMG 08 &quot;Spandau&quot; machine guns; this armament became standard for all the German D-type scouts starting with the Albatros D.I. From the appearance of the Sopwith Camel and the SPAD S.XIII in mid-1917, right through to the end of gun synchronization in the 1950s, a twin gun installation was the international norm. Having the two guns firing simultaneously would obviously not have been a satisfactory arrangement. The guns needed to both fire &quot;at the same point on the propeller disc&quot;, which means that one had to fire a tiny fraction of a second later than the other. This is why early gears designed for a single machine gun needed to be modified in order to control two guns satisfactorily. In practice, at least part of the mechanism had to be duplicated, even if the two weapons were not synchronized separately.

== History ==
From the beginnings of practical flight, possible military uses for aircraft were considered, although not all writers came to positive conclusions on the subject. By 1913, military exercises in Britain, Germany, and France had confirmed the likely usefulness of aircraft for reconnaissance and surveillance, and this was seen by a few forward looking officers as implying the need to deter or destroy the enemy&#x27;s reconnaissance machines. Thus aerial combat was by no means entirely unanticipated, and the machine gun was from the first seen as the most likely weapon to be used.

What was not generally agreed on was the superiority, at least for an attacking aircraft, of &quot;fixed&quot; forward-firing guns, aimed by pointing the aircraft at its target, rather than flexible weapons, aimed by a gunner other than the pilot.

As late as 1916, pilots of the DH.2 pusher fighter had problems convincing their senior officers that the forward-firing armament of their aircraft was more effective if it was fixed to fire forward rather than being flexible. On the other hand, August Euler had patented the idea of a fixed gun as early as 1910 – long before tractor aircraft became the norm, illustrating his patent with a diagram of a machine gun-armed &quot;pusher&quot;.

=== The Franz Schneider patent (1913–1914) ===
Whether directly inspired by Euler&#x27;s original patent or not, the first inventor to patent a method of firing forward through a &quot;tractor&quot; propeller was the Swiss engineer Franz Schneider, formerly with Nieuport, but by then working for the LVG Company in Germany.

The patent was published in the German aviation magazine &quot;Flugsport&quot; in 1914, meaning that the concept became public knowledge at an early stage. The linkage between the propeller and the gun is achieved with a spinning drive shaft, rather than a reciprocating rod. The impulses needed to operate the trigger, or in this case to prevent the trigger from operating, are produced by a cam wheel with two lobes at 180° apart situated at the gun itself since firing is to be interrupted by both blades of the propeller. No attempt was made (so far as is known) to build or test an actual operating gear based on this patent, which attracted little or no official interest at the time. The exact form of the synchronization gear fitted to Schneider&#x27;s LVG E.I of 1915 and its relationship to this patent is unknown, since no plans survive.

=== The Raymond Saulnier patent (1914) ===
Unlike the Schneider patent design, Saulnier&#x27;s device was actually built, and may be considered the first practical synchronization gear to be tested. For the first time, the cam producing the to-and-fro movement conveying firing impulses to the gun is situated at the engine (driven in this case by the same spindle that operated the oil pump and the tachometer) and the impulses themselves are transmitted by a reciprocating rod rather than Schneider&#x27;s rotating shaft. The idea of literally &quot;interrupting&quot; the firing of the gun gives way (probably as the result of experience) to the principle of pulling the trigger for each successive shot, like the action of a semi-automatic weapon.

It has been pointed out that this was a practical design that should have worked, but it did not. Apart from possible inconsistencies in the ammunition supplied, the real problem was that the gun used to trial the gear, a gas-operated Hotchkiss 8 mm (.323 in) machine gun borrowed from the French army, was fundamentally unsuitable for &quot;semi-automatic&quot; firing. Following initial unsuccessful tests, the gun had to be returned, and the experiments ceased.
=== Unsynchronized guns and the &quot;deflector wedge&quot; concept ===
When the pilots of the British Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service arrived in France in 1914, they were equipped with pusher aircraft too underpowered to carry machine guns and still have a chance of overtaking the enemy, and tractor aircraft which were difficult to arm effectively because the propeller was in the way. Among other attempts to get around thissuch as firing obliquely past the arc of the propeller, and even efforts, doomed to failure, to synchronize the Lewis Gun which was at the time the &quot;standard&quot; British aircraft weapon was the expedient of firing straight through the propeller arc and &quot;hoping for the best&quot;. A high proportion of bullets would in the normal course pass the propeller without striking the blades, and each blade might typically take several hits before there was much danger of its failing, especially if it were bound with tape to prevent splintering (see diagram below, and illustration to the left).

After his early synchronization experiments failed, Saulnier pursued a method trusting rather less to statistics and luck by developing armoured propeller blades that would resist damage.

By March 1915, when French pilot Roland Garros approached Saulnier to arrange for this device to be installed on his Morane-Saulnier Type L, these had taken the form of steel wedges which &quot;deflected&quot; the bullets which might otherwise have damaged the propeller, or ricocheted dangerously. Garros himself and his personal mechanic Jules Hue are sometimes credited with testing and perfecting the &quot;deflectors&quot;. This crude system worked after a fashion, although the wedges diminished the propeller&#x27;s efficiency, and the not inconsiderable force of the impact of bullets on the deflector blades must have put undesirable stress on the engine&#x27;s crankshaft.

On 1 April 1915 Garros shot down his first German aircraft, killing both the crew. On 18 April 1915, after two more victories, Garros was forced down (by ground fire) behind German lines. Although he was able to burn his aircraft, Garros was captured and his special propeller was sufficiently intact to be sent for evaluation by the &quot;Inspektion der Fliegertruppen&quot; (&quot;Idflieg&quot;) at Döberitz near Berlin.

=== Fokker&#x27;s Synchronizer and other German gears ===
Inspection of the propeller from Garros&#x27; machine prompted Idflieg to attempt to copy it. Initial trials indicated that the deflector wedges would not be sufficiently strong to cope with the standard steel-jacketed German ammunition, and representatives from Fokker and Pfalz, two companies already building Morane copies (although, strangely, not Schneider&#x27;s LVG concern) were invited to Döberitz to inspect the mechanism and suggest ways that its action might be duplicated.

Anthony Fokker was able to persuade Idflieg to arrange the loan of a Parabellum machine gun and ammunition so that &quot;his&quot; device could be tested, and for these items to be transported forthwith to the &quot;Fokker Flugzeugwerke GmbH&quot; at Schwerin (although probably &quot;not&quot; in his railway compartment or &quot;under his arm&quot;, as he claimed after the war).

The story of his conception, development and installation of the Fokker synchronization device in a period of 48 hours (first found in an authorised biography of Fokker written in 1929) is not now believed to be factual. Another possible explanation is that Garros&#x27;s Morane, partly destroyed by fire as it was, had sufficient traces of the original synchronization gear remaining for Fokker to have guessed how it worked. For various reasons this also seems unlikely, and the current historical consensus points to a synchronization device having been in development by Fokker&#x27;s team (including engineer Heinrich Lübbe) prior to the capture of Garros&#x27;s machine.

==== The Fokker &quot;Stangensteuerung&quot; gear ====

Whatever its ultimate source, the initial version of the Fokker synchronization gear (see illustration) very closely followed, not Schneider&#x27;s patent, as claimed by Schneider and others, but &quot;Saulnier&#x27;s&quot;. Like the Saulnier patent, Fokker&#x27;s gear was designed to actively fire the gun rather than interrupt it, and, like the later Vickers-Challenger gear developed for the RFC, it followed Saulnier in taking its primary mechanical drive from the oil pump of a rotary engine. The &quot;transmission&quot; between the motor and the gun was by a version of Saulnier&#x27;s reciprocating push-rod. The main difference was that instead of the push rod passing directly from the engine to the gun itself, which would have required a tunnel through the firewall and fuel tank (as shown in the Saulnier patent drawings), it was driven by a shaft joining the oil pump to a small cam at the top of the fuselage. This eventually proved unsatisfactory, as the oil pump&#x27;s mechanical drive spindle was insufficiently robust to take the extra load.

Before the failings of the first form of the gear had become clear, Fokker&#x27;s team had adapted the new system to the new Parabellum MG14 machine gun, and fitted it to a Fokker M.5K, a type which was at the time serving in small numbers with the &quot;Fliegertruppen &quot;as the A.III. This aircraft, bearing IdFlieg serial number &quot;A.16/15&quot; became the direct forerunner to the five M.5K/MG pre-production prototypes built, and was effectively the prototype of the Fokker E.I – the first production single-seat fighter aircraft armed with a synchronized machine gun.

This prototype was demonstrated to IdFlieg by Fokker in person on 19–20 May 1915 at the Döberitz proving ground near Berlin. &quot;Leutnant&quot; Otto Parschau was test flying this aircraft by 30 May 1915. The five production prototypes (factory designated M.5K/MG and serialed E.1/15 – E.5/15) were undergoing military trials shortly thereafter. These were all armed with the Parabellum gun, synchronized with the first version of the Fokker gear. This prototype gear had such a short life that a redesign was necessary, producing the second, more familiar, production form of the gear.

The gear used in the production Eindecker fighters replaced the oil pump&#x27;s mechanical driveshaft-based system with a large cam wheel, almost a light flywheel, driven directly from the spinning rotary engine&#x27;s crankcase. The push rod now took its reciprocating motion directly from a &quot;follower&quot; on this cam wheel. At the same time the machine gun used was also changedan lMG 08 machine gun, the so-called &quot;Spandau&quot;, replacing the Parabellum used with the prototype gear. At this time the Parabellum was still in very short supply, and all available examples were required as observers&#x27; guns, the lighter and handier weapon being far superior in this role.

The first victory using a synchronized gun-equipped fighter is now believed to have occurred on 1 July 1915 when &quot;Leutnant&quot; Kurt Wintgens of &quot;Feldflieger Abteilung 6b&quot;, flying the Parabellum-armed Fokker M.5K/MG aircraft &quot;E.5/15&quot;, forced down a French Morane-Saulnier Type L east of Lunéville.

Exclusive possession of a working gun synchronizer enabled a period of German air superiority on the Western Front known as the Fokker Scourge. The German high command was protective of the synchronizer system, instructing pilots not to venture over enemy territory in case they were forced down and the secret revealed, but the basic principles involved were already common knowledge, and by the middle of 1916 several Allied synchronizers were already available in quantity.

By this time, the Fokker &quot;Stangensteuerung&quot; gear, which had worked reasonably well for synchronizing a single gun, firing at a modest cyclic rate through a two-bladed propeller driven by a rotary engine, was becoming obsolete.

&quot;Stangensteuerung&quot; gears for &quot;stationary&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot;, in-line engines, worked from a small cam immediately behind the propeller (see illustration). This produced a basic dilemma: A short, fairly robust push rod meant that the machine gun had to be mounted well forward, putting the breech of the gun out of the pilot&#x27;s reach for clearing jams. If the gun was mounted in the ideal position, within easy reach of the pilot, a much longer push rod was required, which tended to bend and break.

The other problem was that the &quot;Stangensteuerung&quot; never worked well with more than one gun. Two (or even three) guns, mounted side by side &quot;and firing simultaneously&quot;, would have produced a wide spread of fire that would have been impossible to match with the &quot;safe zone&quot; between the whirling propeller blades. Fokker&#x27;s initial answer to this was the fitting of extra &quot;followers&quot; to the &quot;Stangensteuerung&#x27;s&quot; large cam wheel, to (theoretically) produce the &quot;ripple&quot; salvo necessary to ensure that the guns were aimed at the same point on the propeller disc. This proved a disastrously unstable arrangement in the case of three guns, and was rather less than satisfactory, even for two. Most of the early Fokker and Halberstadt biplane fighters were limited to a single gun for this reason.

In fact, the builders of the new Albatros twin-gunned stationary-engine fighters of late 1916 had to introduce their own synchronization gear, known as the &quot;Hedtke gear&quot; or &quot;Hedtkesteuerung&quot;, and it was evident that Fokker were going to have to come up with something radically new.

==== The Fokker &quot;Zentralsteuerung&quot; gear ====
This was designed in late 1916 and took the form of a new synchronization gear without any rods at all. The cam that generated the firing impulses was moved from the engine to the gun; the trigger motor in effect now generated its own firing impulses. The linkage between the propeller and the gun now consisted of a flexible drive shaft directly connecting the end of the engine camshaft to the trigger motor of the gun. The firing button for the gun simply engaged a clutch at the engine which set the flexible drive (and thus the trigger motor) in motion. In some ways this brought the new gear closer to the original Schneider patent (q.v.).

A major advantage was that the adjustment (to set where on the propeller&#x27;s disc each bullet was to impact) was now in the gun itself. This meant that each gun was adjusted separately, an important feature, since twin synchronized guns were not set to be fired in strict unison, but when they were pointing at the same point on the propeller disc. Each gun could be fired independently, since it had its own flexible drive, linked to the engine camshaft by a junction box, and having its own clutch. This provision of a quite separate set of components for each gun also meant that a failure in the gear for one gun did not impinge on the other.

This gear was available in numbers by mid 1917, in time for installation on the Fokker Dr.I triplane and all later German fighters. In fact it became the standard synchronizer for the Luftstreitkräfte for the remainder of the war, although experiments to find an even more reliable gear continued.

==== Other German synchronizers ====
===== The 1915 Schneider gear =====
In June 1915 a two-seater monoplane designed by Schneider for the LVG Company was sent to the front for evaluation. Its observer was armed with the new Schneider gun ring that was becoming standard on all German two-seaters: the pilot was apparently armed with a fixed synchronized machine gun. The aircraft crashed on its way to the front and nothing more was heard of it, or its synchronization gear, although it was presumably based on Schneider&#x27;s own patent.

===== The Albatros gears =====
The new Albatros fighters of late 1916 were fitted with twin guns synchronized with the &quot;Albatros-Hedtke Steuerung&quot; gear, which was designed by Albatros &quot;Werkmeister&quot; Hedtke. The system was specifically intended to overcome the problems that had arisen in applying the Fokker &quot;Stangensteuerung&quot; gear to in-line engines and twin gun installations, and was a variation of the rigid push-rod system, driven from the rear of the crankshaft of the Mercedes D.III engine.

The Albatros D.V used a new gear, designed by &quot;Werkmeister&quot; Semmler: (the &quot;Albatros-Semmler Steuerung&quot;). It was basically an improved version of the Hedtke gear.

An official order, signed on 24 July 1917 standardised the superior Fokker &quot;Zentralsteuerung&quot; system for all German aircraft, presumably including Albatroses.

===== Electrical gears =====
Post First World War German fighters were fitted with electrical synchronizers. In such a gear, a contact or set of contacts, either on the propeller shaft itself, or some other part of the drive train revolving at the same number of revolutions per minute, generates a series of electrical pulses, which are transmitted to a solenoid driven trigger motor at the gun. Experiments with these were underway before the end of the war, and again the LVG company seems to have been involved: a British intelligence report from 25 June 1918 mentions an LVG two-seater fitted with such a gear that was brought down in the British lines. It is known that LVG built 40 C.IV two-seaters fitted with a Siemens electrical synchronizing system.

In addition, the Aviatik company received instructions to install 50 of their own electrical synchronization system on to DFW C.Vs (Av).

=== Austria-Hungary ===
The standard machine gun of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces in 1914 was the Schwarzlose MG M.07/12 machine-gun, which operated on a &quot;delayed blow back&quot; system and was not suited to synchronization. Unlike the French and Italians, who were eventually able to acquire supplies of Vickers guns, the Austrians were unable to obtain sufficient quantities of &quot;Spandaus&quot; from their German allies and were forced to use the Schwarzlose in an application for which it was not really suited. Although the problem of synchronizing the Schwarzlose was eventually partially solved, it was not until late 1916 that gears were available. Even then, at high engine revolutions Austrian synchronizer gears tended to behave very erratically. Austrian fighters were fitted with large tachometers to ensure that a pilot could check that his &quot;revs&quot; were within the required range before firing his guns, and propeller blades were fitted with an electrical warning system that alerted a pilot if his propeller was being hit. There were never enough gears available, due to a chronic shortage of precision tools; so that production fighters, even the excellent Austrian versions of the Albatros D.III, often had to be sent to the front in an unarmed state, for squadron armourers to fit such guns and gears as could be scrounged, salvaged or improvised.

Rather than standardising on a single system, different Austrian manufacturers produced their own gears. The research of Harry Woodman (1989) identified the following types:

==== Zahnrad-Steuerung (cogwheel-control) ====
Drive was from the camshaft operating rods of the Austro-Daimler engine via a wormgear. The early Schwarzlose gun had a synchronized rate of 360 rounds per minute with this gear – this was later boosted to 380 rounds with the MG16 model.

==== Bernatzik-Steuerung ====
Drive was taken from the rocking arm of an exhaust valve, a lever fixed to the valve housing transmitting impulses to the gun through a rod. Designed by &quot;Leutnant&quot; Otto Bernatzik, it was geared down to deliver a firing impulse every second revolution of the propeller, and fired at about 380 to 400 rounds per gun. As with other gears synchronizing the Schwarzlose gun, firing became erratic at high engine speeds.

==== Priesel-Steuerung ====
Apart from a control that engaged the cam follower and fired the gun in one movement, this gear was based closely on the original Fokker &quot;Stangensteuerung&quot; gear. It was designed by &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Guido Priesel, and became standard on Oeffag Albatros fighters in 1918.

==== Zap-Steuerung (Zaparka control) ====
This gear was designed by &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Eduard Zaparka. Drive was from the rear of the camshaft of a Hiero engine through a transmission shaft with Cardan joints. The rate of fire, with the later Schwarzlose gun, was up to 500 rounds per minute. The machine gun had to be placed well forward, where it was inaccessible to the pilot, so that jams could not be cleared in flight.

==== Kralische &quot;Zentralsteuerung&quot; ====
Based on the principle of the Fokker &quot;Zentralsteuerung&quot; gear, with flexible drives linked to the camshaft, and firing impulses being generated by the trigger motor of each gun. Geared down to operate more reliably with the difficult Schwarzlose gun, its rate of fire was limited to 360–380 rounds per minute.

=== United Kingdom ===

British gun synchronization got off to a quick but rather shaky start. The early mechanical synchronization gears turned out to be inefficient and unreliable and full standardisation on the very satisfactory hydraulic &quot;C.C.&quot; gear was not accomplished until November 1917. Synchronized guns seem to have been rather unpopular with British fighter pilots well into 1917 and the over-wing Lewis gun, on its Foster mounting, remained the weapon for Nieuports in British service, being also initially considered as the main weapon of the S.E.5. Significantly, early problems with the C.C. gear were considered one of the &quot;less&quot; pressing matters for No. 56 squadron in March 1917, busy getting their new S.E.5 fighters combat worthy before they went to France, since they had the over-wing Lewis to fall back on! Ball actually had his Vickers gun removed altogether for a while, to save weight.

==== The Vickers-Challenger gear ====

The first British synchronizer gear was built by the manufacturer of the machine-gun for which it was designed: it went into production in December 1915. George Challenger, the designer, was at the time an engineer at Vickers. In principle it closely resembled the first form of the Fokker gear, although this was not because it was a copy (as is sometimes reported) it was not until April 1916 that a captured Fokker was available for technical analysis. The fact is that both gears were based closely on the Saulnier patent. The first version was driven by a reduction gear attached to a rotary engine oil pump spindle as in Saulnier&#x27;s design and a small impulse-generating cam was mounted externally on the port side of the forward fuselage where it was readily accessible for adjustment.

Unfortunately, when the gear was fitted to types such as the Bristol Scout and the Sopwith 1½ Strutter, which had rotary engines and their forward-firing machine gun in front of the cockpit, the long push rod linking the gear to the gun had to be mounted at an awkward angle, in which it was liable to twisting and deformation as well as expansion and contraction due to temperature changes.

For this reason the B.E.12, the R.E.8 and Vickers&#x27; own FB 19 mounted their forward-firing machine guns on the port side of the fuselage so that a relatively short version of the push rod could be linked directly to the gun.

This worked reasonably well although the &quot;awkward&quot; position of the gun, which precluded direct sighting, was initially much criticised. It proved less of a problem than was at first supposed once it was realized that it was the aircraft that was aimed rather than the gun itself. The last aircraft type to be fitted with the Vickers-Challenger gear, the R.E.8, retained the port-side position of the gun even after most were retrofitted with the C.C. gear from mid 1917.

==== The Scarff-Dibovski gear ====
Lieutenant Victor Dibovski, an officer of the Imperial Russian Navy, while serving as a member of a mission to England to observe and report on British aircraft production methods, suggested a synchronization gear of his own design. According to Russian sources, this gear had already been tested in Russia, with mixed results, although it is possible that the earlier Dibovski gear was actually a deflector system rather than a true synchronizer. In any case, Warrant Officer F. W. Scarff worked with Dibovski to develop and realize the gear, which worked on the familiar cam and rider principle, the connection to the gun being by the usual push rod and a rather complicated series of levers. It was geared in order to slow the rate that firing impulses were delivered to the gun (and hence improve reliability, although not the rate of fire). The gear was ordered for the RNAS and followed the Vickers-Challenger gear into production by a matter of weeks. It was more adaptable to rotary engines than the Vickers-Challenger, but apart from early Sopwith 1½ Strutters built to RNAS orders in 1916, and possibly some early Sopwith Pups, no actual applications seem to have been recorded.

==== Ross and other &quot;miscellaneous&quot; gears ====
The Ross gear was an interim, field-built gear designed in 1916 specifically to replace the unsuitable Vickers-Challenger gears in the 1½ Strutters of the RFC&#x27;s No.70 Squadron. Officially it was designed by Captain Ross of No.70, although it has been suggested that a flight-sergeant working under Captain Ross was largely responsible. The gear was apparently used only on 1½ Strutters, but No. 45 squadron used at least some examples of the gear, as well as No. 70. It was replaced by the Sopwith-Kauper gear when that gear became available.

Norman Macmillan, writing some years after the event, claimed that the Ross gear had a very slow rate of fire, but that it left the original trigger intact, so that it was possible &quot;in a really tight corner&quot; to &quot;fire the gun direct without the gear, and get the normal rate of fire of the ground gun&quot;. Macmillan claimed that propellers with up to twenty hits nonetheless got their aircraft home. Some aspects of this information are hard to reconcile with the way a synchronized gun actually worked, and may well be a matter of Macmillan&#x27;s memory playing tricks.

Another &quot;field made&quot; synchronizer was the ARSIAD: produced by the &quot;Aeroplane Repair Section of the No.1 Aircraft Depot&quot; in 1916. Little specific seems to be known about it; although it may have been fitted to some early R.E.8s for which no Vickers-Challenger gears could be found.

Airco and Armstrong Whitworth both designed their own gears specifically for their own aircraft. Standardisation on the hydraulic C.C. gear (described below) occurred before either had been produced in numbers. Only Sopwiths&#x27; gear (next section) was to go into production.

==== The Sopwith-Kauper gear ====
The first mechanical synchronization gears fitted to early Sopwith fighters were so unsatisfactory that in mid 1916 Sopwiths had an improved gear designed by their foreman of works Harry Kauper, a friend and colleague of fellow Australian Harry Hawker. This gear was specifically intended to overcome the faults of earlier gears. Patents connected with the extensively modified Mk.II and Mk.III versions were applied for in January and June 1917.

Mechanical efficiency was improved by reversing the action of the push rod. The firing impulse was generated at a low point of the cam instead of at the lobe of the cam as in Saulnier&#x27;s patent. Thus the force on the rod was exerted by tension rather than compression, (or in less technical language, the trigger motor worked by being &quot;pulled&quot; rather than &quot;pushed&quot;) which enabled the rod to be lighter, minimising its inertia so that it could operate faster (at least in early versions of the gear, each revolution of the cam wheel produced two firing impulses instead of one). A single firing lever engaged the gear and fired the gun in one action, rather than the gear having to be &quot;turned on&quot; and then fired, as with some earlier gears.

2,750 examples of the Sopwith-Kauper gear were installed in service aircraft: as well as being the standard gear for the Sopwith Pup and Triplane it was fitted to many early Camels, and replaced earlier gears in 1½ Strutters and other Sopwith types. However, by November 1917, in spite of several modifications, it was becoming evident that even the Sopwith-Kauper gear suffered from the inherent limitations of mechanical gears. Camel squadrons, in particular, reported that propellers were frequently being &quot;shot through&quot;, the gears having a tendency to &quot;run away&quot;. Wear and tear, as well as the increased rate of fire of the Vickers gun and higher engine speeds were responsible for this decline in performance and reliability. By this time the teething problems of the hydraulic C.C. gear had been overcome and it was made standard for all British aircraft, including Sopwiths.

==== The Constantinesco synchronization gear ====
Major Colley, the Chief Experimental Officer and Artillery Adviser at the War Office Munitions Invention Department, became interested in George Constantinesco&#x27;s theory of Wave Transmission, and worked with him to determine how his invention could be put to practical use, finally hitting on the notion of developing a synchronization gear based on it. Major Colley used his contacts in the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Artillery (his own corps) to obtain the loan of a Vickers machine gun and 1,000 rounds of ammunition.

Constantinesco drew on his work with rock drills to develop a synchronization gear using his wave transmission system. In May 1916, he prepared the first drawing and an experimental model of what became known as the Constantinesco Fire Control Gear or the &quot;C.C. (Constantinesco-Colley) Gear&quot;. The first provisional patent application for the Gear was submitted on 14 July 1916 (No. 512).

At first, the meticulous Constantinesco was dissatisfied with the odd slightly deviant hit on his test disc. It was found that carefully inspecting the ammunition cured this fault (common, of course, to all such gears); with good quality rounds, the performance of the gear pleased even its creator. A. M. Low who commanded the Royal Flying Corps secret Experimental Works at Feltham was involved in the testing. The system was perfected by Constantinesco in collaboration with the Fleet Street printer and engineer Walter Haddon at the Haddon Engineering Works in Honeypot Lane, Alperton. The first working C.C. gear was air-tested in a B.E.2c in August 1916.

The new gear had several advantages over all mechanical gears: the rate of fire was greatly improved, the synchronization was much more accurate, and above all it was readily adaptable to any type of engine and airframe, instead of needing a specially designed impulse generator for each type of engine and special linkages for each type of aircraft. In the long run (provided it was properly maintained and adjusted) it also proved far more durable and less prone to failure.

No. 55 Squadron&#x27;s DH.4s arrived in France on 6 March 1917 fitted with the new gear, followed shortly after by No. 48 squadron&#x27;s Bristol Fighters and No. 56 Squadron&#x27;s S.E.5s. Early production models had some teething troubles in service, as ground crew learned to service and adjust the new gears, and pilots to operate them. It was late in 1917 before a version of the gear that could operate twin guns became available, so that the first Sopwith Camels had to be fitted with the Sopwith-Kauper gear instead.

From November 1917 the gear finally became standard; being fitted to all new British aircraft with synchronized guns from that date up to the Gloster Gladiator of 1937.

Over 6,000 gears were fitted to machines of the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service between March and December 1917. Twenty thousand more &quot;Constantinesco-Colley&quot; gun synchronization systems were fitted to British military aircraft between January and October 1918, during the period when the Royal Air Force was formed from the two earlier services on April 1, 1918. A total of 50,000 gears were manufactured during the twenty years it was standard equipment.

==== The Betteridge gear ====

The C.C. gear was not the only hydraulic gear to be proposed; in 1917 Air Mechanic A.R. Betteridge of No.1 Squadron Australian Flying Corps built and tested a gear of his own design while serving with his unit in Palestine. No official interest was expressed in this device; possibly the C.C. gear was already in prospect. The illustration seems very likely to be of the test rig for this gear.

=== France ===
The French &quot;Aviation Militaire&quot; was fortunate in that they were able to standardise on two reasonably satisfactory synchronization gears – one adapted for rotary engines, and the other for &quot;stationary&quot; (in-line) ones – almost from the beginning.

==== The Alkan-Hamy gear ====
The first French synchronizer was developed by &quot;Sergeant-Mécanicien&quot; Robert Alkan and &quot;Ingénieur du Génie maritime&quot; Hamy. It was based closely on the definitive Fokker &quot;Stangensteuerung&quot; gear: the main difference being that the push rod was installed within the Vickers gun, using a redundant steam tube in the cooling jacket. This mitigated a major drawback of other push rod gears in that the rod, being supported for its whole length, was much less liable to distortion or breakage. Vickers guns modified to take this gear can be distinguished by the housing for the push rod&#x27;s spring, projecting from the front of the gun like a second barrel. This gear was first installed and air-tested in a Nieuport 12, on 2 May 1916, and other pre-production gears were fitted to contemporary Morane-Saulnier and Nieuport fighters. The Alkan-Hamy gear was standardised as the &quot;Système de Synchronisation pour Vickers Type I (moteurs rotatifs)&quot;, becoming available in numbers in time for the arrival of the Nieuport 17 at the front in mid 1916, as the standard gear for forward-firing guns of rotary-engine French aircraft.

The Nieuport 28 used a different gear – now known only through American documentation, where it is described as the &quot;Nieuport Synchronizing gear&quot; or the &quot;Gnome gear&quot;. A spinning drive shaft, driven by the rotating crankcase of the Nieuport&#x27;s 160 CV Gnome 9N Monosoupape rotary engine, drove two separately adjustable trigger motors – each imparting firing impulses to its gun by means of its own short rod. Photographic evidence suggests that an earlier version of this gear, controlling a single gun, might have been fitted to the Nieuport 23 and the Hanriot HD.1.

==== The Birkigt gear ====
The SPAD S.VII was designed around Marc Birkigt&#x27;s Hispano-Suiza engine, and when the new fighter entered service in September 1916 it came armed with a single Vickers gun synchronized with a new gear provided by Birkigt for use with his engine. Unlike most other mechanical gears, the &quot;SPAD gear&quot; as it was often called, did without a pushrod altogether: the firing impulses being transmitted to the gun torsionally by a moving &quot;oscillating&quot; shaft, which rotated through about a quarter of a revolution, alternately clockwise and anticlockwise. This oscillation was more mechanically efficient than the reciprocating motion of a push rod, permitting higher speeds. Officially known as the &quot;Système de Synchronisation pour Vickers Type II (moteurs fixes)&quot; the Birkigt gear was later adapted to control two guns, and remained in use in French service up to the time of the Second World War.

=== Russia ===
No Russian synchronization gears went into production before the 1917 Revolution – although experiments by Victor Dibovski in 1915 contributed to the later British Scarff-Dibovski gear (described above), and another naval officer, G.I. Lavrov, also designed a gear that was fitted to the unsuccessful Sikorsky S-16. French and British designs licence-built in Russia used the Alkan-Hamy or Birkigt gears.

Fighters of the Soviet era used synchronized guns right up to the time of the Korean War, when the Lavochkin La-11 and the Yakovlev Yak-9 became the last synchronizer-equipped aircraft to see combat action.

=== Italy ===
The Italian Fiat-Revelli gun did not prove amenable to synchronization, so the Vickers became the standard pilot&#x27;s weapon, synchronized by the Alkan-Hamy or Birkigt gears.

=== United States ===
French and British combat aircraft ordered for the American Expeditionary Force in 1917/18 were fitted with their &quot;native&quot; synchronization gears, including the Alkan-Hamy in Nieuports and French-built Sopwiths, the Birkigt gear in SPADs, and the C.C. gear for British types. The C.C. was also adopted for the twin M1917/18 Marlin machine guns fitted to the American built DH-4, and was itself made in America until the Nelson gear appeared in numbers.

==== The Nelson gear ====
The Marlin gas operated gun proved less amenable to synchronization than the Vickers. It was found that &quot;rogue&quot; shots occasionally pierced the propeller, even when the gear was properly adjusted and otherwise functioning well. The problem was eventually resolved by modifications to the Marlin&#x27;s trigger mechanism, but in the meantime the engineer Adolph L. Nelson at the Airplane Engineering Department at McCook Field had developed a new, mechanical gear especially adapted to the Marlin, officially known as the &quot;Nelson single shot synchronizer.&quot; In place of the push rod common to many mechanical gears, or the &quot;pull rod&quot; of the Sopwith-Kauper, the Nelson gear used a cable held in tension for the transmission of firing impulses to the gun.

Production models were largely too late for use before the end of the First World War, but the Nelson gear became the post-war U.S. standard, as Vickers and Marlin guns were phased out in favour of the Browning .30 calibre machine gun.

==== E-4/E-8 gears ====
The Nelson gear proved reliable and accurate, but it was expensive to produce and the necessity for its cable to be given a straight run could create difficulties when it was to be installed in a new type. By 1929 the latest model (the E-4 gear) had a new and simplified impulse generator, a new trigger motor, and the impulse cable was enclosed in a metal tube, protecting it, and permitting shallow bends. While the basic principle of the new gear remained unchanged: virtually all the components had been redesigned, and it was no longer officially referred to as the &quot;Nelson&quot; gear. The gear was further modernised in 1942 as the E-8. This final model had a modified impulse generator that was easier to adjust and was controlled from the cockpit by an electrical solenoid rather than a Bowden cable.

=== Decline and end of synchronization ===

The usefulness of synchronization gears naturally disappeared altogether when jet engines eliminated the propeller, at least in fighter aircraft, but gun synchronization, even in single reciprocating engine aircraft, had already been in decline for twenty years prior to this.

The increased speeds of the new monoplanes of the mid to late 1930s meant that the time available to deliver a sufficient weight of fire to bring down an enemy aircraft was greatly reduced. At the same time, the primary vehicle of air power was increasingly seen as the large all-metal bomber: powerful enough to carry armour protection for its vulnerable areas. Two rifle-calibre machine guns were no longer enough, especially for defence planners who anticipated a primarily strategic role for airpower. An effective &quot;anti-bomber&quot; fighter needed something more.

Cantilever monoplane wings provided ample space to mount armaments and, being much more rigid than the old cable-braced wings, they afforded almost as steady a mounting as the fuselage. This new context also made the harmonisation of wing guns more satisfactory, producing a fairly narrow cone of fire in the close to medium ranges at which a fighter&#x27;s gun armament was most effective.

The retention of fuselage-mounted guns, with the additional weight of their synchronization gear (which slowed their rate of fire, albeit only slightly, and still occasionally failed, resulting in damage to propellers) became increasingly unattractive. This design philosophy, common in Britain and France (and, after 1941, the United States) tended towards eliminating fuselage mounted guns altogether. For example, the original 1934 specifications for the Hawker Hurricane were for a similar armament to the Gloster Gladiator: four machine-guns, two in the wings and two in the fuselage, synchronized to fire through the propeller arc. The illustration opposite is of an early mock-up of the prototype, showing the starboard fuselage gun. The prototype (&quot;K5083&quot;) as completed had ballast representing this armament; production Hurricane Is, however, were armed with eight guns, all in the wings.

Another approach, common to Germany, the Soviet Union, and Japan, while recognising the necessity to increase armament, preferred a system that included synchronized weapons. Centralised guns had the real advantage that their range was limited only by ballistics, as they did not need the gun harmonisation necessary to concentrate the fire of wing-mounted guns. They were seen as rewarding the true marksman, as they involved less dependence on gun sight technology. Mounting guns in the fuselage also concentrated mass at the centre of gravity, thus improving the fighter&#x27;s roll ability. More consistent ammunition manufacture, and improved synchronization gear systems made the whole concept more efficient and effective, whilst facilitating its application to weapons of increased calibre such as autocannon; moreover the constant-speed propellers that quickly became standard equipment on WW II fighters meant that the ratio between the propeller speed and the rate of fire of the guns varied less erratically.

The swan-song of synchronization belongs to the last reciprocating engine Soviet fighters, which largely made do with slow firing synchronized cannon throughout the World War II period and after. In fact, the very last synchronizer-equipped aircraft to see combat action were the Lavochkin La-11 and the Yakovlev Yak-9 during the Korean War.

==Popular culture==
The act of shooting one&#x27;s own propeller is a trope that can be found in comedic gags, like the 1965 cartoon short &quot;Just Plane Beep&quot; starring Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. In this film, the attacking Coyote reduces his propeller to splinters after numerous bullets strike.

<text>The modularity theorem (formerly called the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture, Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture or modularity conjecture for elliptic curves) states that elliptic curves over the field of rational numbers are related to modular forms in a particular way. Andrew Wiles and Richard Taylor proved the modularity theorem for semistable elliptic curves, which was enough to imply Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. Later, a series of papers by Wiles&#x27;s former students Brian Conrad, Fred Diamond and Richard Taylor, culminating in a joint paper with Christophe Breuil, extended Wiles&#x27;s techniques to prove the full modularity theorem in 2001.

==Statement==

The theorem states that any elliptic curve over formula_1 can be obtained via a rational map with integer coefficients from the classical modular curve for some integer ; this is a curve with integer coefficients with an explicit definition. This mapping is called a modular parametrization of level . If is the smallest integer for which such a parametrization can be found (which by the modularity theorem itself is now known to be a number called the &quot;conductor&quot;), then the parametrization may be defined in terms of a mapping generated by a particular kind of modular form of weight two and level , a normalized newform with integer -expansion, followed if need be by an isogeny.

===Related statements===
The modularity theorem implies a closely related analytic statement:

To each elliptic curve over formula_1 we may attach a corresponding -series. The -series is a Dirichlet series, commonly written

:formula_3

The generating function of the coefficients is then

:formula_4

If we make the substitution

:formula_5

we see that we have written the Fourier expansion of a function of the complex variable , so the coefficients of the -series are also thought of as the Fourier coefficients of . The function obtained in this way is, remarkably, a cusp form of weight two and level and is also an eigenform (an eigenvector of all Hecke operators); this is the Hasse–Weil conjecture, which follows from the modularity theorem.

Some modular forms of weight two, in turn, correspond to holomorphic differentials for an elliptic curve. The Jacobian of the modular curve can (up to isogeny) be written as a product of irreducible Abelian varieties, corresponding to Hecke eigenforms of weight 2. The 1-dimensional factors are elliptic curves (there can also be higher-dimensional factors, so not all Hecke eigenforms correspond to rational elliptic curves). The curve obtained by finding the corresponding cusp form, and then constructing a curve from it, is isogenous to the original curve (but not, in general, isomorphic to it).

==History==
Yutaka Taniyama stated a preliminary (slightly incorrect) version of the conjecture at the 1955 international symposium on algebraic number theory in Tokyo and Nikkō as the twelfth of his set of 36 unsolved problems. Goro Shimura and Taniyama worked on improving its rigor until 1957. André Weil rediscovered the conjecture, and showed in 1967 that it would follow from the (conjectured) functional equations for some twisted -series of the elliptic curve; this was the first serious evidence that the conjecture might be true. Weil also showed that the conductor of the elliptic curve should be the level of the corresponding modular form. The Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture became a part of the Langlands program.

The conjecture attracted considerable interest when Gerhard Frey suggested in 1986 that it implies Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. He did this by attempting to show that any counterexample to Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem would imply the existence of at least one non-modular elliptic curve. This argument was completed in 1987 when Jean-Pierre Serre identified a missing link (now known as the epsilon conjecture or Ribet&#x27;s theorem) in Frey&#x27;s original work, followed two years later by Ken Ribet&#x27;s completion of a proof of the epsilon conjecture.

Even after gaining serious attention, the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture was seen by contemporary mathematicians as extraordinarily difficult to prove or perhaps even inaccessible to prove. For example, Wiles&#x27;s Ph.D. supervisor John Coates states that it seemed &quot;impossible to actually prove&quot;, and Ken Ribet considered himself &quot;one of the vast majority of people who believed [it] was completely inaccessible&quot;.

In 1995, Andrew Wiles, with some help from Richard Taylor, proved the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture for all semistable elliptic curves. Wiles used this to prove Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, and the full Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture was finally proved by Diamond, Conrad, Diamond &amp; Taylor; and Breuil, Conrad, Diamond &amp; Taylor; building on Wiles&#x27;s work, they incrementally chipped away at the remaining cases until the full result was proved in 1999. Once fully proven, the conjecture became known as the modularity theorem.

Several theorems in number theory similar to Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem follow from the modularity theorem. For example: no cube can be written as a sum of two coprime th powers, .

==Generalizations==
The modularity theorem is a special case of more general conjectures due to Robert Langlands. The Langlands program seeks to attach an automorphic form or automorphic representation (a suitable generalization of a modular form) to more general objects of arithmetic algebraic geometry, such as to every elliptic curve over a number field. Most cases of these extended conjectures have not yet been proved.

In 2013, Freitas, Le Hung, and Siksek proved that elliptic curves defined over real quadratic fields are modular.

==Example==

For example, the elliptic curve , with discriminant (and conductor) 37, is associated to the form
:formula_6

For prime numbers not equal to 37, one can verify the property about the coefficients. Thus, for , there are 6 solutions of the equation modulo 3: , , , , , ; thus .

The conjecture, going back to the 1950s, was completely proven by 1999 using the ideas of Andrew Wiles, who proved it in 1994 for a large family of elliptic curves.

There are several formulations of the conjecture. Showing that they are equivalent was a main challenge of number theory in the second half of the 20th century. The modularity of an elliptic curve of conductor can be expressed also by saying that there is a non-constant rational map defined over , from the modular curve to . In particular, the points of can be parametrized by modular functions.

For example, a modular parametrization of the curve is given by

:formula_7

where, as above, . The functions and are modular of weight 0 and level 37; in other words they are meromorphic, defined on the upper half-plane and satisfy
:formula_8

and likewise for , for all integers with and .

Another formulation depends on the comparison of Galois representations attached on the one hand to elliptic curves, and on the other hand to modular forms. The latter formulation has been used in the proof of the conjecture. Dealing with the level of the forms (and the connection to the conductor of the curve) is particularly delicate.

The most spectacular application of the conjecture is the proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem (FLT). Suppose that for a prime , the Fermat equation
:formula_9

has a solution with non-zero integers, hence a counter-example to FLT. Then as was the first to notice, the elliptic curve
:formula_10

of discriminant
:formula_11

cannot be modular. Thus, the proof of the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture for this family of elliptic curves (called Hellegouarch–Frey curves) implies FLT. The proof of the link between these two statements, based on an idea of Gerhard Frey (1985), is difficult and technical. It was established by Kenneth Ribet in 1987.

<doc id="174479" wikidata="Q157824" url="?curid=174479" title="Piombino">
<text>Piombino is an Italian town and &quot;comune&quot; of about 35,000 inhabitants in the province of Livorno (Tuscany). It lies on the border between the Ligurian Sea and the Tyrrhenian Sea, in front of Elba Island and at the northern side of Maremma.

==Overview==
It has an ancient historical centre, derived from the time in which it was the Etruscans&#x27; port, in the surroundings of Populonia. In the Middle Ages, it was instead an important port of the Republic of Pisa.

Its hinterland hosts a considerable industrial area. Its port is still heavily used, both for industry and for tourism, with ferry boats to Portoferraio (Elba) and Olbia (Sardinia).

==Geography==
The bounding communes of Piombino are Campiglia Marittima, Follonica, San Vincenzo and Suvereto. The town has seven civil parishes (&quot;frazioni&quot;): Baratti, Colmata, Fiorentina, La Sdriscia, Populonia, Populonia Stazione and Riotorto.

==History==
===Early history===
The area of modern Piombino was settled since ancient times. During the Etruscan era the main city in the area was Populonia, now a &quot;frazione&quot; within the comune of Piombino.

The name &quot;Piombino&quot; derives almost certainly from &quot;Populino&quot;, meaning &quot;Small Populonia&quot;, which the refugees gave to a small village where they had taken refuge after the city had been attacked by Greek pirates (9th century). It is also probable that Piombino had already been founded during the period of Ostrogoth rule.

In 1022 the Monastery of San Giustiniano was founded in the area, boosting the activity of fishermen, sailors and workers. In 1115 Piombino submitted to the Republic of Pisa, becoming its second main port: authority was exerted by a &quot;Capitano&quot; (&quot;Captain&quot;). During the conflicts between the Pisane and the Genoese (12th–13th centuries), the city was sacked various times. In 1248 the &quot;Capitano&quot; Ugolino Arsopachi built the Channels.

===Lordship of Piombino===
The Castle of Piombino remained a Pisan possession until Gerardo Appiani, after ceding Pisa to the Milanese Visconti, carved out an independent lordship centred on Piombino that included the islands of the Tuscan Archipelago: Elba, Pianosa, Montecristo, Capraia, Gorgona, and Giglio, for his family, who held the state intermittently until 1634.

In 1445, through his marriage with Caterina Appiani, Rinaldo Orsini acquired the Lordship of Piombino. In 1501–1503 the lordship came under the control of Cesare Borgia. After Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici had occupied the Lordship of Piombino in the course of the war against Siena, in 1553 and 1555 a French-Ottoman fleet attacked Piombino, but was pushed back. In 1557, a peace treaty reinstated the Appiani as rulers of Piombino, with the exception of Portoferraio, which was given to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and the area of Orbetello, which became part of the State of the Presidi under Spanish control.

===Principality of Piombino===
In 1594, the Lordship of Piombino was raised to the status of a principality by the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II of Habsburg, the first Prince of Piombino being Alessandro Appiani d&#x27;Aragona.

In 1634, the title was acquired by the Ludovisi family, whose member Niccolò I had married the heiress Polissena Appiani in 1632.

In 1708, the principality became ruled by the Boncompagni family with Antonio I as prince.

===Annexation===
In 1801, Napoleon abolished the principality, Piombino and its lands being annexed by the Kingdom of Etruria; in 1809 they were given to Napoleon&#x27;s sister, Elisa Baciocchi. After Napoleon&#x27;s final defeat and the Congress of Vienna, the state of Piombino was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. It became part of the unified Kingdom of Italy in 1860.

===World War II===
During World War II, in the days that followed the announcement of the Armistice of Cassibile, Piombino was the setting for one of the first episodes of the Italian resistance. On 10 September 1943, during Operation Achse, a small German flotilla, commanded by Kapitänleutnant Karl-Wolf Albrand, tried to enter the harbour of Piombino but was denied access by the port authorities. General Cesare Maria De Vecchi, in command of the Italian coastal forces (and a former Fascist Gerarca), commanded the port authorities to allow the German flotilla to enter, against the advice of Commander Amedeo Capuano, the Naval commander of the harbour. Once they entered and landed, the German forces showed a hostile behaviour, and it became clear that their intent was to occupy the town; the local population asked for a resolved reaction by the Italian forces, threatening an insurrection, but the senior Italian commander, general Fortunato Perni, instead ordered his tanks to open fire on the civilians, to disperse the crowds; De Vecchi forbade any action against the Germans. This however did not stop the protests; some junior officers, acting on their own initiative and against the orders (Perni and De Vecchi even tried to dismiss them for this), assumed command and started distributing weapons to the population, and civilian volunteers joined the Italian sailors and soldiers in the defense. Battle broke out at 21:15 on 10 September, between the German landing forces (who aimed to occupy the town centre) and the Italian coastal batteries, tanks, and civilian population. Italian tanks sank the German torpedo boat &quot;TA11&quot;; Italian artillery also sank seven Marinefährprahme, the péniches &quot;Mainz&quot; and &quot;Meise&quot; (another péniche, &quot;Karin&quot;, was scuttled at the harbour entrance as a blockship) and six Luftwaffe service boats (&quot;Fl.B.429&quot;, &quot;Fl.B.538&quot;, &quot;Fl.C.3046&quot;, &quot;Fl.C.3099&quot;, &quot;Fl.C.504&quot; e &quot;Fl.C.528&quot;), and heavily damaged the torpedo boat &quot;TA 9&quot; and the steamers &quot;Carbet&quot; and &quot;Capitano Sauro&quot; (formerly Italian). &quot;Sauro&quot; and &quot;Carbet&quot; were scuttled because of the damage they had suffered. The German attack was repelled; by the dawn of 11 September, 120 Germans had been killed and about 200–300 captured, 120 of them wounded. Italian casualties had been 4 killed (two sailors, one Guardia di Finanza brigadier, and one civilian) and a dozen wounded; four Italian submarine chasers (&quot;VAS 208&quot;, &quot;214&quot;, &quot;219&quot; and &quot;220&quot;) were also sunk during the fighting. Later in the morning, however, De Vecchi ordered the prisoners to be released, and had their weapons given back to them. New popular protests broke out, as the Italian units were disbanded and the senior commanders fled from the city; the divisional command surrendered Piombino to the Germans on 12 September, and the city was occupied. Many of the sailors, soldiers and citizens who had fought in the battle of Piombino retreated to the surrounding woods and formed the first partisan formations in the area. For the deeds of its citizens, the town received a Gold Medal for Military Valour from President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.

==Main sights==

*Co-Cathedral of &quot;Sant&#x27;Antimo&quot; (c. 1377), built by the Augustinians and originally dedicated to St. Michael. It is in Pisane-Gothic style, a memoir of the rule of Pisa over Piombino. The interior, with two naves (one added in 1933), houses precious works by Andrea Guardi, including a Baptismal Font. The counter-façade has Renaissance sepulchres of the Appiani family. Also by Guardi is the cloister (1470).
*The &quot;Rivellino&quot; (Walls Tower-Gate) is the city&#x27;s most ancient monument (1212).
*The &quot;Chiesa della Misericordia&quot; (early 13th century). It houses a precious 15th-century crucifix.
*The &quot;Cassero Pisano&quot; (Castle). It is formed by two distinct buildings, the Fortress, built under Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici (1552–53), and the Cassero (late 15th century), the latter used as a military jail until 1959.
*The &quot;Palazzo Comunale&quot; (Town Hall), mostly a modern reconstruction of the ancient &quot;Palazzo degli Anziani&quot; (1435). In the Musters Hall, with portraits of the Princes of Piombino.
*Chapel of St. Anne, a noteworthy Renaissance work by Guardi. Annexed is the &quot;Torre Civica&quot; (Town Tower, 16th century).
*The &quot;Cisterna di Cittadella&quot; (Citadel&#x27;s Cistern), also by Guardi. On the sides are the portraits of Jacopo III Appiani and his son and wife, later disfigured by order of Cesare Borgia.
*&quot;Casa delle Bifore&quot; (House of the Mullioned Windows, 1280s).
*The Natural Province Reserve Padule Orti Bottagone, created in 1998, next to the locality of Torre del Sale.

==Twin towns — sister cities==

Piombino is twinned with:
* Flémalle, Belgium

==Miscellanea==
Piombino has schools, a gymnasium (middle school), lyceums (high school), churches, banks, parks and squares. In the locality of Punta Falcone is an astronomical observatory, created in 1976.
East of Piombino, there was a power station with 1280 MW generation capacity with two chimneys, each tall, but this is now being dismantled. West of Piombino, there is the start of the submarine power cable section to Corsica from HVDC SACOI.

<text>In mathematics, the common logarithm (aka &quot;standard logarithm&quot;) is the logarithm with base 10. It is also known as the decadic logarithm, the decimal logarithm and the Briggsian logarithm. The name &quot;Briggsian logarithm&quot; is in honor of the British mathematician Henry Briggs who conceived of and developed the values for the &quot;common logarithm&quot;. Historically&#x27;, the &quot;common logarithm&quot; was known by its Latin name &quot;logarithmus decimalis&quot; or &quot;logarithmus decadis&quot;.

The mathematical notation for using the common logarithm is , , or sometimes with a capital ; on calculators, it is printed as &quot;log&quot;, but mathematicians usually mean natural logarithm (logarithm with base e ≈ 2.71828) rather than common logarithm when writing &quot;log&quot;. To mitigate this ambiguity, the ISO 80000 specification recommends that should be written , and should be .
Before the early 1970s, handheld electronic calculators were not available, and mechanical calculators capable of multiplication were bulky, expensive and not widely available. Instead, tables of base-10 logarithms were used in science, engineering and navigation—when calculations required greater accuracy than could be achieved with a slide rule. By turning multiplication and division to addition and subtraction, use of logarithms avoided laborious and error-prone paper-and-pencil multiplications and divisions. Because logarithms were so useful, tables of base-10 logarithms were given in appendices of many textbooks. Mathematical and navigation handbooks included tables of the logarithms of trigonometric functions as well. For the history of such tables, see log table.

==Mantissa and characteristic==
An important property of base-10 logarithms, which makes them so useful in calculations, is that the logarithm of numbers greater than 1 that differ by a factor of a power of 10 all have the same fractional part. The fractional part is known as the mantissa. Thus, log tables need only show the fractional part. Tables of common logarithms typically listed the mantissa, to four or five decimal places or more, of each number in a range, e.g. 1000 to 9999.

The integer part, called the characteristic, can be computed by simply counting how many places the decimal point must be moved, so that it is just to the right of the first significant digit. For example, the logarithm of 120 is given by the following calculation:

:formula_1

The last number (0.07918)—the fractional part or the mantissa of the common logarithm of 120—can be found in the table shown. The location of the decimal point in 120 tells us that the integer part of the common logarithm of 120, the characteristic, is 2.

===Negative logarithms===
Positive numbers less than 1 have negative logarithms. For example,

:formula_2

To avoid the need for separate tables to convert positive and negative logarithms back to their original numbers, one can express a negative logarithm as a negative integer characteristic plus a positive mantissa. To facilitate this, a special notation, called &quot;bar notation,&quot; is used:

:formula_3

The bar over the characteristic indicates that it is negative, while the mantissa remains positive. When reading a number in bar notation out loud, the symbol formula_4 is read as &quot;bar &quot;, so that formula_5 is read as &quot;bar 2 point 07918...&quot;. An alternative convention is to express the logarithm modulo 10, in which case

:formula_6

with the actual value of the result of a calculation determined by knowledge of the reasonable range of the result.

The following example uses the bar notation to calculate 0.012 × 0.85 = 0.0102:

:formula_7

* This step makes the mantissa between 0 and 1, so that its antilog (10) can be looked up.

The following table shows how the same mantissa can be used for a range of numbers differing by powers of ten:
Note that the mantissa is common to all of the . This holds for any positive real numberformula_8 because
:formula_9

Since is a constant, the mantissa comes from formula_10, which is constant for given formula_8. This allows a table of logarithms to include only one entry for each mantissa. In the example of , 0.698 970 (004 336 018 ...) will be listed once indexed by 5 (or 0.5, or 500, etc.).

== History ==

Common logarithms are sometimes also called &quot;Briggsian logarithms&quot; after Henry Briggs, a 17th century British mathematician. In 1616 and 1617, Briggs visited John Napier at Edinburgh, the inventor of what are now called natural (base-&quot;e&quot;) logarithms, in order to suggest a change to Napier&#x27;s logarithms. During these conferences, the alteration proposed by Briggs was agreed upon; and after his return from his second visit, he published the first chiliad of his logarithms.

Because base-10 logarithms were most useful for computations, engineers generally simply wrote &quot; when they meant . Mathematicians, on the other hand, wrote &quot; when they meant for the natural logarithm. Today, both notations are found. Since hand-held electronic calculators are designed by engineers rather than mathematicians, it became customary that they follow engineers&#x27; notation. So the notation, according to which one writes &quot;&quot; when the natural logarithm is intended, may have been further popularized by the very invention that made the use of &quot;common logarithms&quot; far less common, electronic calculators.

== Numeric value ==

The numerical value for logarithm to the base 10 can be calculated with the following identities:

: formula_12 or formula_13 or formula_14

using logarithms of any available base formula_15

as procedures exist for determining the numerical value for logarithm base (see ) and logarithm base 2 (see Algorithms for computing binary logarithms).

== Derivative ==
The derivative of a logarithm with a base &quot;b&quot; is such that

<text>BASIC Programming is an Atari Video Computer System (later called the Atari 2600) cartridge that teaches simple computer programming using a dialect of BASIC. Written by Warren Robinett and released by Atari, Inc. in 1979, this BASIC interpreter is one of a few non-game cartridges for the console. The Atari VCS&#x27;s RAM size of 128 bytes restricts the possibilities for writing programs.

==Details==
The &quot;BASIC Programming&quot; display is divided into six regions:

* Program is where instructions are typed. It has a maximum of eleven lines of code.
* Stack shows temporary results of what the program does. 
* Variables stores the values of any variables that the program is using. 
* Output displays any output values that the program creates. 
* Status shows the amount of available memory remaining.
* Graphics contains two colored squares that can be manipulated by the program.

Input is given through two Atari keypad controllers, which came with special overlays to show how to type the different commands and letters. Programs are restricted to 64 characters in size and normally 9 lines of code, limiting the programs that can be written (users can disable all windows except Program and keep selecting &quot;New Line&quot; until 11 lines of code are present).

===Language features===

VCS BASIC supports the following keywords:
* Statements: codice_1
* Structure: codice_2, codice_3
* Graphics: codice_4
* Functions: codice_5, codice_6
* Math: codice_7
* Relational operators: codice_8

Unlike most BASIC implementations of the time:
* VCS BASIC uses ← instead of = for assignment; e.g., codice_9.
* Statements can be strung together on a line without a delimiter; e.g., codice_10.
* An codice_11 statement can be used as a function, returning a value: codice_12
* codice_11 statements can take an codice_14 clause.

Special variable names:
* codice_15 sounds a musical note, assigned numbers from 0 to 7
** Numbers assigned to codice_15 are implicitly assigned modulus 8, thus 8 becomes 0, 9 becomes 1, etc.
* codice_17, codice_18 - the horizontal coordinate of one of two squares
* codice_19, codice_20 - the vertical coordinate of one of two squares

The language supports 26 unsigned integer variables A to Z. VCS BASIC supports integers from 0 to 99. Math operations wrap, so 99+1 becomes 0, 99+2 becomes 1, etc.

<doc id="174487" wikidata="Q154532" url="?curid=174487" title="Heinkel He 111">
<text>The Heinkel He 111 is a German airliner and medium bomber designed by Siegfried and Walter Günter at Heinkel Flugzeugwerke in 1934. Through development, it was described as a ‘wolf in sheep&#x27;s clothing’. Due to restrictions placed on Germany after the First World War prohibiting bombers, it was presented solely as a civil airliner, although from conception the design was intended to provide the nascent Luftwaffe with a heavy bomber.

Perhaps the best-recognised German bomber of World War II due to the distinctive, extensively glazed &quot;greenhouse&quot; nose of the later versions, the Heinkel He 111 was the most numerous Luftwaffe bomber during the early stages of the war. It fared well until it met serious fighter opposition during the Battle of Britain, when its defensive armament was found to be inadequate. As the war progressed, the He 111 was used in a wide variety of roles on every front in the European theatre. It was used as a strategic bomber during the Battle of Britain, a torpedo bomber in the Atlantic and Arctic, and a medium bomber and a transport aircraft on the Western, Eastern, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and North African Front theatres.

The He 111 was constantly upgraded and modified, but had nonetheless become obsolete by the latter part of the war. The failure of the German Bomber B project forced the Luftwaffe to continue operating the He 111 in combat roles until the end of the war. Manufacture of the He 111 ceased in September 1944, at which point piston-engine bomber production was largely halted in favour of fighter aircraft. With the German bomber force virtually defunct, the He 111 was used for logistics.

Production of the Heinkel continued after the war as the Spanish-built CASA 2.111. Spain received a batch of He 111H-16s in 1943 along with an agreement to licence-build Spanish versions. Its airframe was produced in Spain under licence by Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA. The design differed significantly only in the powerplant used, eventually being equipped with Rolls-Royce Merlin engines. These remained in service until 1973.

==Development==

===Conception===

After its defeat in World War I, Germany was banned from operating an air force by the Treaty of Versailles. German re-armament began earnestly in the 1930s and was initially kept secret because the project violated the treaty. Early development work on bombers was disguised as a development program for civilian transport aircraft.

Among the designers seeking to benefit from German re-armament was Ernst Heinkel. Heinkel decided to create the world&#x27;s fastest passenger aircraft, a goal met with scepticism by Germany&#x27;s aircraft industry and political leadership. Heinkel entrusted development to Siegfried and Walter Günter, both fairly new to the company and untested.

In June 1933, Albert Kesselring visited Heinkel&#x27;s offices. Kesselring was head of the Luftwaffe Administration Office: at that point Germany did not have a State Aviation Ministry but only an aviation commissariat, the &quot;Luftfahrtkommissariat&quot;. Kesselring was hoping to build a new air force out of the Flying Corps being constructed in the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, and required modern aircraft. Kesselring convinced Heinkel to move his factory from Warnemünde to Rostock – with its factory airfield in the coastal &quot;Marienehe&quot; region of Rostock (today &quot;Rostock-Schmarl&quot;) and bring in mass production, with a force of 3,000 employees. Heinkel began work on the new design, which garnered urgency as the American Lockheed 12, Boeing 247 and Douglas DC-2 began to appear.

Features of the He 111 were apparent in the Heinkel He 70. The first single-engined He 70 &quot;Blitz&quot; (&quot;Lightning&quot;) rolled off the line in 1932 and immediately started breaking records. In the normal four-passenger version, its speed reached when powered by a BMW VI engine. The He 70 had an elliptical wing, which the Günther brothers had already used in the Bäumer Sausewind before joining Heinkel. This wing design became a feature in this and many subsequent designs they developed. The He 70 drew the interest of the Luftwaffe, which was looking for an aircraft with both bomber and transport capabilities.

The He 111 was a twin-engine version of the &quot;Blitz&quot;, preserving the elliptical inverted gull wing, small rounded control surfaces and BMW engines, so that the new design was often called the &quot;Doppel-Blitz&quot; (&quot;Double Lightning&quot;). When the Dornier Do 17 displaced the He 70, Heinkel needed a twin-engine design to match its competitors. Heinkel spent 200,000-man hours designing the He 111. The fuselage was lengthened to from and wingspan increased to from .

===First flight===
The first He 111 flew on 24 February 1935, piloted by chief test pilot Gerhard Nitschke, who was ordered not to land at the company&#x27;s factory airfield at Rostock-Marienehe (today&#x27;s Rostock-Schmarl neighbourhood), as this was considered too short, but at the central &quot;Erprobungstelle&quot; Rechlin test facility. He ignored these orders and landed back at Marienehe. He said that the He 111 performed slow manoeuvres well and that there was no danger of overshooting the runway. Nitschke also praised its high speed &quot;for the period&quot; and &quot;very good-natured flight and landing characteristics&quot;, stable during cruising, gradual descent and single-engined flight and having no nose-drop when the undercarriage was operated. During the second test flight Nitschke revealed there was insufficient longitudinal stability during climb and flight at full power and the aileron controls required an unsatisfactory amount of force.

By the end of 1935, prototypes V2 and V4 had been produced under civilian registrations D-ALIX, D-ALES and D-AHAO. D-ALES became the first prototype of the He 111A-1 on 10 January 1936 and received recognition as the &quot;fastest passenger aircraft in the world&quot;, as its speed exceeded . The design would have achieved a greater total speed had the DB 600 inverted-V12 engine that powered the Messerschmitt Bf 109s tenth through thirteenth prototypes been available. Heinkel was forced initially to use the BMW VI &quot;upright&quot; V12 liquid-cooled engine.

During the war, British test pilot Eric Brown evaluated many Luftwaffe aircraft. Among them was an He 111H-1 of Kampfgeschwader 26 &quot;Löwengeschwader&quot; (Lions Wing) which was forced to land at the Firth of Forth on 9 February 1940. Brown described his impression of the He 111s unique greenhouse nose,

The overall impression of space within the cockpit area and the great degree of visual sighting afforded by the Plexiglas panelling were regarded as positive factors, with one important provision in relation to weather conditions. Should either bright sunshine or rainstorms be encountered, the pilot&#x27;s visibility could be dangerously compromised either by glare throwback or lack of good sighting.

Taxiing was easy and was only complicated by rain, when the pilot needed to slide back the window panel and look out to establish direction. On take off, Brown reported very little &quot;swing&quot; and the aircraft was well balanced. On landing, Brown noted that approach speed should be above and should be held until touchdown. This was to avoid a tendency by the He 111 to drop a wing, especially on the port side.

===Competition===
In the mid-1930s, Dornier Flugzeugwerke and Junkers competed with Heinkel for Ministry of Aviation (German: Reichsluftfahrtministerium, abbreviated RLM) contracts. The main competitor to the Heinkel was the Junkers Ju 86. In 1935, comparison trials were undertaken with the He 111. At this point, the Heinkel was equipped with two BMW VI engines while Ju 86A was equipped with two Jumo 205Cs, both of which had . The He 111 had a slightly heavier takeoff weight of compared to the Ju 86&#x27;s and the maximum speed of both aircraft was . The Ju 86 had a higher cruising speed of , faster than the He 111. This stalemate was altered drastically by the appearance of the DB 600C, which increased the He 111&#x27;s power by per engine. The Ministry of Aviation awarded both contracts. Junkers sped up development and production at a breathtaking pace, but their financial expenditure was huge. In 1934–1935, 3,800,000 RM (4½% of annual turnover) was spent. The Ju 86 appeared at many flight displays all over the world which helped sales to the Ministry of Aviation and abroad. Dornier, which was also competing with their Do 17, and Heinkel were not as successful. In production terms, the He 111 was more prominent with 8,000 examples produced against just 846 Ju 86s, and was therefore the Luftwaffe&#x27;s most numerous type at the beginning of the Second World War.

==Design==
The design of the He 111 A-L initially had a conventional stepped cockpit, with a pair of windscreen-like panels for the pilot and co-pilot. The He 111P and subsequent production variants were fitted with fully glazed cockpits and a laterally asymmetric nose, with the port side having the greater curvature for the pilot, offsetting the bombardier to starboard. The resulting stepless cockpit, which was a feature on a number of German bomber designs during the war years in varying shapes and formats, no longer had the separate windscreen panels for the pilot. Pilots had to look outside through the same bullet-like glazing that was used by the bombardier and navigator. The pilot was seated on the left and the navigator/bomb aimer on the right. The navigator went forward to the prone bomb-aiming position or could tilt his chair to one side, to move into the rear of the aircraft. There was no cockpit floor below the pilot&#x27;s feet—the rudder pedals being on arms—giving very good visibility below. Sliding and removable panels were manufactured into the nose glazing to allow the pilot, navigator and or bomb aimer to exit the aircraft quickly, without a time-consuming retreat into the fuselage.

The fuselage contained two major bulkheads, with the cockpit at the front of the first bulkhead. The nose was fitted with a rotating machine gun mount, offset to allow the pilot a better field of forward vision. The cockpit was fully glazed, with the exception of the lower right section, which acted as a platform for the bombardier-gunner. The commonly-used &quot;Lotfernrohr&quot;-series bombsight penetrated through the cockpit floor into a protective housing on the outside of the cockpit.

Between the forward and rear bulkhead was the bomb bay, which was constructed with a double-frame to strengthen it for carrying the bomb load. The space between the bomb bay and rear bulkhead was used up by &quot;Funkgerät&quot; radio equipment and contained the dorsal and flexible casemate ventral gunner positions. The rear bulkhead contained a hatch which allowed access into the rest of the fuselage which was held together by a series of stringers. The wing was a two spar design. The fuselage was formed of stringers to which the fuselage skin was riveted. Internally the frames were fixed only to the stringers, which made for simpler construction at the cost of some rigidity.

The wing leading edges were swept back to a point inline with the engine nacelles, while the trailing edges were angled forward slightly. The wing contained two fuel tanks between the inner wing main spars, while at the head of the main spar the oil coolers were fitted. Between the outer spars, a second pair of reserve fuel tanks were located, carrying an individual capacity of of fuel. The outer trailing edges were formed by the ailerons and flaps, which were met by smooth wing tips which curved forward into the leading edge. The outer leading edge sections were installed in the shape of a curved &quot;strip nosed&quot; rib, which was positioned ahead of the main spar. Most of the interior ribs were not solid, with the exception of the ribs located between the rear main spar and the flaps and ailerons. These were of solid construction, though even they had lightening holes.

The control systems also had some innovations. The control column was centrally placed and the pilot sat on the port side of the cockpit. The column had an extension arm fitted and had the ability to be swung over to the starboard side in case the pilot was incapacitated. The control instruments were located above the pilot&#x27;s head in the ceiling, which allowed viewing and did not block the pilot&#x27;s vision. The fuel instruments were electrical. The He 111 used the inner fuel tanks, closest to the wing root, first. The outer tanks acted as reserve tanks. The pilot was alerted to the fuel level when there was left. A manual pump was available in case of electrical or power failure but the delivery rate of just per minute demanded that the pilot fly at the lowest possible speed and just below . The He 111 handled well at low speeds.

The defensive machine gun positions were located in the glass nose and in the flexible ventral, dorsal and lateral positions in the fuselage, and all offered a significant field of fire. The machine gun in the nose could be moved 10° upwards from the horizontal and 15° downwards. It could traverse some 30° laterally. Both the dorsal and ventral machine guns could move up and downwards by 65°. The dorsal position could move the MG 131 machine gun 40° laterally, but the ventral &quot;Bola&quot;-mount twinned MG 81Z machine guns could be moved 45° laterally. Each MG 81 single machine gun mounted in the side of the fuselage in &quot;waist&quot; positions, could move laterally by 40° and could move upwards from the horizontal by 30° and downwards by 40°.

==Early civilian variants==

===He 111C===

The first prototype, He 111 V1 (W.Nr. 713, D-ADAP), flew from Rostock-Marienehe on 24 February 1935. It was followed by the civilian-equipped V2 and V4 in May 1935. The V2 (W.Nr. 715, D-ALIX) used the bomb bay as a four-seat &quot;smoking compartment&quot;, with another six seats behind it in the rear fuselage. V2 entered service with Deutsche Luft Hansa in 1936, along with six other newly built versions known as the He 111C. The He 111 V4 was unveiled to the foreign press on 10 January 1936. Nazi propaganda inflated the performance of the He 111C, announcing its maximum speed as ; in reality its performance stood at . The He 111 C-0 was a commercial version and took the form of the V4 prototype design. The first machine was designated D-AHAO &quot;Dresden&quot;. It was powered by the BMW VI engine and could manage a range (depending on the fuel capacity) of and a maximum speed of . The wing span on the C series was . The fuselage dimensions were in the He 111 V1, but changed in the C to . The Jumo 205 diesel powerplant replaced the BMW VI. Nevertheless, the maximum speed remained in the bracket. This was increased slightly when the BMW 132 engines were introduced.

A general problem existed in powerplants. The He 111 was equipped with BMW VI glycol-cooled engines. The German aviation industry lacked powerplants that could produce more than 600 hp. Engines of suitable quality were kept for military use, frustrating German airline Luft Hansa and forcing it to rely on the BMW VI or 132s.

===He 111G===
The He 111G was an upgraded variant and had a number of differences to its predecessors. To simplify production the leading edge of the wing was straightened, like the bomber version. Engine types used included the BMW 132, BMW VI, DB 600 and DB601A. Some C variants were upgraded with the new wing modifications. A new BMW 132H engine was also used in a so-called &quot;Einheitstriebwerk&quot; (unitary powerplant). These radial engines were used in the Junkers Ju 90 and the Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor. The wing units and engines were packed together as complete operating systems, allowing for a quick change of engine – a likely direct precursor of the wartime &quot;Kraftei&quot; aviation engine unitization concept. The He 111G was the most powerful as well as the fastest commercial version. The G-0 was given the BMW VI 6.0 ZU. Later variants had their powerplants vary. The G-3 for example was equipped with the BMW 132. The G-4 was powered by DB600G inverted-vee engines and the G-5 was given the DB601B with a top speed of . By early 1937, eight G variants were in Lufthansa service. The maximum number of He 111s in Lufthansa service was 12. The He 111 operated all over Europe and flew as far away as South Africa. Commercial development ended with the He 111G.

==Military variants==

===He 111A – D===

The initial reports from the test pilot, Gerhard Nitschke, were favourable. The He 111&#x27;s flight performance and handling were impressive although it dropped its wing in the stall. As a result, the passenger variants had their wings reduced from . The military aircraft – V1, V3 and V5 had a span of .

The first prototypes were underpowered, as they were equipped with BMW VI 6.0 V12 in-line engines. This was eventually increased to with the installation of the DB (Daimler-Benz) 600 engines in the V5, which became the prototype of the &quot;B&quot; series.

Only ten He 111 A-0 models based on the V3 were built, but they proved to be underpowered and were eventually sold to China. The type had been lengthened by ) due to the extra MG 15 machine gun in the nose. Another gun position was installed on top of the fuselage, and a third in a ventral position as a retractable &quot;dustbin&quot; turret. The bomb bay was divided into two compartments and could carry of bombs. The problem with these additions was that the weight of the aircraft reached . The He 111&#x27;s performance was seriously reduced; in particular, the BMW VI 6.0 Z engines, which had been underpowered from the beginning, made the increase in weight even more problematic. The increased length also altered the 111&#x27;s aerodynamic strengths and reduced its excellent handling on takeoffs and landings.

The crews found the aircraft difficult to fly, and its top speed was reduced significantly. Production was shut down after the pilots reports reached the Ministry of Aviation. However, a Chinese delegation was visiting Germany and they considered the He 111 A-0 fit for their needs and purchased seven machines.

The first He 111B made its maiden flight in the autumn of 1936. The first production batch rolled off the production lines that summer, at Rostock. Seven B-0 pre-production aircraft were built, bearing the &quot;Werknummern&quot; (W.Nr./Works numbers) 1431 to 1437. The B-0s were powered by DB 600C engines fitted with variable pitch airscrews. These increased output by . The B-0 had an MG 15 machine gun installed in the nose. The B-0 could also carry in vertical cells. The B-1 had some minor improvements, including the installation of a revolving gun mount in the nose and a flexible Ikaria turret under the fuselage. After improvements, the RLM ordered 300 He 111 B-1s; the first were delivered in January 1937. In the B-2 variant, engines were upgraded to the supercharged DB 600C, or in some cases, the 600G. The B-2 began to roll off the production lines at Oranienburg in 1937. The He 111 B-3 was a modified trainer. Some 255 B-1s were ordered. However, the production orders were impossible to fulfill and only 28 B-1s were built. Owing to the production of the new He 111E, only a handful of He 111 B-3s were produced. Due to insufficient capacity, Dornier, Arado and Junkers built the He 111B series at their plants in Wismar, Brandenburg and Dessau, respectively. The B series compared favourably with the capacity of the A series. The bomb load increased to , while there was also an increase in maximum speed and altitude to and .

In late 1937, the D-1 series entered production. However, the DB 600Ga engine with planned for this variant was instead allocated to Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Bf 110 production lines. Heinkel then opted to use Junkers Jumo engines, and the He 111 V6 was tested with Jumo 210 G engines, but was judged underpowered. However, the improved Jumo 211 A-1 powerplant prompted the cancellation of the D series altogether and concentration on the design of the E series.

===He 111 E===
The pre-production E-0 series were built in small numbers, with Jumo 211 A-1 engines loaded with retractable radiators and exhaust systems. The variant could carry of bombs, giving it a takeoff weight of . The development team for the Jumo 211 A-1 engines increased power to , subsequently the He 111 E-1s bomb load capacity increased to and a top speed of .

The E-1 variant with Jumo 211A-1 engines was developed in 1937, the He 111 V6 being the first production variant. The E-1 had its original powerplant, the DB 600 replaced with the Jumo 210 Ga engines. The more powerful Jumo 211 A-1 engines desired by the Ministry of Aviation were not ready; another trial aircraft, He 111 V10 (D-ALEQ) was to be fitted with two oil coolers necessary for the Jumo 211 A-1 installation.
The E-1s came off the production line in February 1938, in time for a number of these aircraft to serve in the Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War in March 1938. The RLM thought that because the E variant could outrun enemy fighters in Spain, there was no need to increase the defensive weaponry, which would prove to be a mistake in later years.

The fuselage bomb bay used four bomb racks but in later versions eight modular standard bomb racks were fitted, to carry one SC bomb or four SC bombs mounted nose up. These modular standard bomb racks were a common feature on the first generation of Luftwaffe bombers but they limited the ordnance selection to bombs of only two sizes and were abandoned in later designs.

The E-2 series was not produced and was dropped in favour of producing the E-3 with only a few modifications, such as external bomb racks. Its design features were distinguished by improved FuG radio systems. The E-3 series was equipped with the Jumo 211 A-3s of .

The E-4 variant was fitted with external bomb racks also and the empty bomb bay space was filled with an tank for aviation fuel and a further oil tank. This increased the loaded weight but increased range to . The modifications allowed the He 111 to perform both long- and short-range missions. The E-4&#x27;s eight internal vertically aligned bomb racks could each carry a bomb. The last E Variant, the He 111 E-5, was powered by the Jumo 211 A-3 and retained the fuel tank on the port side of the bomb bay. Only a few E-4 and E-5s were built.

The RLM had acquired an interest in rocket boosters fitted, for the sake of simplicity, below the wings of a heavily loaded bomber, to cut down the length of runway needed for takeoff. Once in the air the booster canisters would be jettisoned by parachute for reuse. The firm of Hellmuth Walter, at Kiel, handled this development. The first standing trials and tests flights of the Walter HWK 109-500 &quot;Starthilfe&quot; liquid-fueled boosters were held in 1937 at Neuhardenberg with test pilot Erich Warsitz at the controls of Heinkel He 111E bearing civil registration D-AMUE.

===He 111 F===
The He 111 design quickly ran through a series of minor design revisions. One of the more obvious changes started with the He 111F models, which moved from the elliptical wing to one with straight leading and trailing edges, which could be manufactured more efficiently. The new design had a wing span of and a wing area of .

Heinkel&#x27;s industrial capacity was limited and production was delayed. Nevertheless, 24 machines of the F-1 series were exported to Turkey. Another 20 of the F-2 variant were built. The Turkish interest, prompted by the fact the tests of the next prototype, He 111 V8, was some way off, prompted the Ministry of Aviation to order 40 F-4s with Jumo 211 A-3 engines. These machines were built and entered service in early 1938. This fleet was used as a transport group during the Demyansk Pocket and Battle of Stalingrad. At this time, development began on the He 111J. It was powered by the DB 600 and was intended as a torpedo bomber. As a result, it lacked an internal bomb bay and carried two external torpedo racks. The Ministry of Aviation gave an order for the bomb bay to be retrofitted; this variant became known as the J-1. In all but the powerplant, it was identical to the F-4.

The final variant of the F series was the F-5, with bombsight and powerplants identical to the E-5. The F-5 was rejected as a production variant owing to the superior performance of the He 111 P-1.

===He 111 J===
The He 111&#x27;s low-level performance attracted the interest of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. The result was the He 111J, capable of carrying torpedoes and mines. However, the navy eventually dropped the program as they deemed the four-man crew too extravagant. The RLM continued production of the He 111 J-0. Some 90 (other sources claim 60) were built in 1938 and were then sent to &quot;Küstenfliegergruppe 806&quot; (Coastal Flying Group). Powered by the DB 600G engines, it could carry a payload. Only a few of the pre-production J-0s were fitted with the powerplant, the DB 600 was used, performance deteriorated and the torpedo bomber was not pursued. The J variants were used in training schools until 1944. Some J-1s were used as test beds for radio-guided air-to-ground torpedo missiles.

===He 111 P===
The He 111P incorporated the updated Daimler-Benz DB 601A-1 liquid-cooled engine and featured a newly designed nose section, including an asymmetric mounting for an MG 15 machine gun that replaced the &#x27;stepped&#x27; cockpit with a roomier and more aerodynamic glazed &quot;stepless cockpit&quot; over the entire front of the aircraft. This smooth glazed nose was first tested on the He 111 V8 in January 1938. These improvements allowed the aircraft to reach at and a cruise speed of , although a full bomb load reduced this figure to . The design was implemented in 1937 because pilot reports indicated problems with visibility.
The pilot&#x27;s seat could actually be elevated, with the pilot&#x27;s eyes above the level of the upper glazing, complete with a small pivoted windscreen panel, to get the pilot&#x27;s head above the level of the top of the &quot;glass tunnel&quot; for a better forward view for takeoffs and landings. The rear-facing dorsal gun position, enclosed with a sliding, near-clear view canopy, and for the first time, the ventral &quot;Bodenlafette&quot; rear-facing gun position, immediately aft of the bomb bay, that replaced the draggy &quot;dustbin&quot; retractable emplacement became standard, having been first flown on the He 111 V23, bearing civil registration D-ACBH.

One of Heinkel&#x27;s rivals, Junkers, built 40 He 111Ps at Dessau. In October 1938, the Junkers Central Administration commented:Apparent are the externally poor, less carefully designed components at various locations, especially at the junction between the empennage and the rear fuselage. All parts have an impression of being very weak... The visible flexing in the wing must also be very high. The left and right powerplants are interchangeable. Each motor has an exhaust-gas heater on one side, but it is not connected to the fuselage since it is probable that ... the warm air in the fuselage is not free of carbon monoxide (CO). The fuselage is not subdivided into individual segments, but is attached over its entire length, after completion, to the wing centre section. Outboard of the powerplants, the wings are attached by universal joints. The latter can in no way be satisfactory and have been the cause of several failures.

The new design was powered by the DB 601 Ba engine with 1,175 PS The first production aircraft reached Luftwaffe units in Fall 1938.
In May 1939, the P-1 and P-2 went into service with improved radio equipment. The P-1 variant was produced with two DB 601Aa powerplants of . It also introduced self-sealing fuel tanks. The P-1 featured a semi-retractable tail wheel to decrease drag. Armament consisted of an MG 15 in the nose, and a sliding hood for the fuselage&#x27;s dorsal B-Stand position. Installation of upgraded FuG III radio communication devices were also made and a new ESAC-250/III vertical bomb magazine was added. The overall takeoff weight was now .

The P-2, like the later P-4, was given stronger armour and two MG 15 machine guns in &quot;waist&quot; mounts on either side of the fuselage and two external bomb racks. Radio communications consisted of FuG IIIaU radios and the DB601 A-1 replaced the 601Aa powerplants. The Lotfernrohr 7 bombsights, which became the standard bombsight for German bombers, were also fitted to the P-2. The P-2 was also given &quot;field equipment sets&quot; to upgrade the weak defensive armament to four or five MG 15 machine guns. The P-2 had its bomb capacity raised to 4 ESA-250/IX vertical magazines. The P-2 had an empty weight of , a loaded weight which had increased to and a maximum range of .

The P-3 was powered with the same DB601A-1 engines. The aircraft was also designed to take off with a land catapult (KL-12). A towing hook was added to the fuselage under the cockpit for the cable. Just eight examples were produced, all without bomb equipment.

The P-4 contained many changes from the P-2 and P-3. The jettisonable loads were capable of considerable variation. Two external SC bombs, two LMA air-dropped anti-shipping mines, one SC plus four SC ; or one SC external bomb could be carried on an ETC &quot;Rüstsatz&quot; rack. Depending on the load variation, an 835 L fuel and 120 L oil tank could be added in place of the internal bomb bay. The armament consisted of three defensive MG 15 machine guns. later supplemented by a further three MG 15s and one MG 17 machine gun. The radio communications were standard FuG X(10), Peil G V direction finding and FuBI radio devices. Due to the increase in defensive firepower, the crew numbers increased from four to five. The empty weight of the P-4 increased to , and the full takeoff weight increased to .

The P-5 was powered by the DB601A. The variant was mostly used as a trainer and at least twenty-four production variants were produced before production ceased. The P-5 was also fitted with meteorological equipment, and was used in Luftwaffe weather units.

Many of the He 111 Ps served during the Polish Campaign. With the Junkers Ju 88 experiencing technical difficulties, the He 111 and the Do 17 formed the backbone of the &quot;Kampfwaffe&quot;. On 1 September 1939, Luftwaffe records indicate the Heinkel strength at 705 (along with 533 Dorniers).

The P-6 variant was the last production model of the He 111 P series. In 1940, the Ministry of Aviation abandoned further production of the P series in favour of the H versions, mostly because the P-series&#x27; Daimler-Benz engines were needed for Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Bf 110 fighter production. The remaining P-6s were redesignated P-6/R2s and used as heavy glider tugs. The most notable difference with previous variants was the upgraded DB 601N powerplants.

The P-7 variant&#x27;s history is unclear. The P-8 was said to have been similar to the H-5 fitted with dual controls. The P-9 was produced as an export variant for the Hungarian Air Force. Due to the lack of DB 601E engines, the series was terminated in summer 1940.

==He 111H and its variants==
===He 111 H-1 to H-10===

The H variant of the He 111 series was more widely produced and saw more action during World War II than any other Heinkel variant.
Owing to the uncertainty surrounding the delivery and availability of the DB 601 engines, Heinkel switched to Junkers Jumo 211 powerplants, whose somewhat greater size and weight were regarded as unimportant considerations in a twin-engine design. When the Jumo was fitted to the P model it became the He 111 H. The He 111 H-1 was fitted with a standard set of three  MG 15 machine guns and eight SC 250 or 32 SC 50 bombs. The same armament was used in the H-2 which started production in August 1939.
The P-series was gradually replaced on the eve of war with the new H-2, powered by improved Jumo 211 A-3 engines of . A count on 2 September 1939 revealed that the Luftwaffe had a total of 787 He 111s in service, with 705 combat ready, including 400 H-1 and H-2s that had been produced in a mere four months. Production of the H-3, powered by the Jumo 211 D-1, began in October 1939. Experiences during the Polish Campaign led to an increase in defensive armament. MG 15s were fitted whenever possible and the number of machine guns was sometimes increased to seven. The two waist positions received an additional MG 15, and on some variants a belt-fed MG 17 was even installed in the tail. A MG FF autocannon would sometimes be installed in the nose or forward gondola.
After the Battle of Britain, smaller scale production of the H-4s began. The H-4 was virtually identical to the He 111 P-4 with the DB 600s swapped for the Jumo 211D-1s. Some also used the Jumo 211H-1. This variant also differed from the H-3 in that it could either carry of bombs internally or mount one or two external racks to carry one or two bombs. As these external racks blocked the internal bomb bay doors, a combination of internal and external storage was not possible. A PVR 1006L bomb rack was fitted externally and an tank added to the interior spaces left vacant by the removal of the internal bomb-bay. The PVR 1006L was capable of carrying a SC 1000 bomb. Some H-4s had their PVC racks modified to drop torpedoes. Later modifications enabled the PVC 1006 to carry a &quot;Max&quot; bomb. However &quot;Hermann&quot; or &quot;Satans&quot; were used more widely.

The H-5 series followed in February 1941, with heavier defensive armament. Like the H-4, it retained a PVC 1006 L bomb rack to enable it to carry heavy bombs under the fuselage. The first ten He 111 H-5s were pathfinders, and selected for special missions. The aircraft sometimes carried flashlight bombs which acted as flares. The H-5 could also carry heavy fire bombs, either heavy containers or smaller incendiary devices attached to parachutes. The H-5 also carried LM A and LM B aerial mines for anti-shipping operations. After the 80th production aircraft, the PVC 1006 L bomb rack was removed and replaced with a heavy-duty ETC 2000 rack, enabling the H-5 to carry the SC 2500 &quot;Max&quot; bomb, on the external ETC 2000 rack, which enabled it to support the bomb.

Some H-3 and H-4s were equipped with barrage balloon cable-cutting equipment in the shape of cutter installations forward of the engines and cockpit. They were designated H-8, but later named H8/R2. These aircraft were difficult to fly and production stopped. The H-6 initiated some overall improvements in design. The Jumo 211 F-1 engine of increased its speed while the defensive armament was upgraded at the factory with one MG FF cannon in the nose and/or gondola positions (optional), two MG 15 in the ventral gondola, and one each of the fuselage side windows. Some H-6 variants carried tail-mounted MG 17 defensive armament. The performance of the H-6 was much improved. The climb rate was higher and the bomber could reach a slightly higher ceiling of . When heavy bomb loads were added, this ceiling was reduced to . The weight of the H-6 increased to . Some H-6s received Jumo 211F-2s which improved a low-level speed of . At an altitude of the maximum speed was . If heavy external loads were added, the speed was reduced by .

Other designs of the mid-H series included the He 111 H-7 and H-8. The airframes were to be rebuilds of the H-3/H-5 variant. Both were designed as night bombers and were to have two Jumo 211F-1s installed. The intention was for the H-8 to be fitted with cable-cutting equipment and barrage ballon deflectors on the leading edge of the wings. The H-7 was never built.

The H-9 was intended as a trainer with dual control columns. The airframe was a H-1 variant rebuild. The powerplants consisted of two JumoA-1s or D-1s. The H-10 was also designated to trainer duties. Rebuilt from an H-2 or H-3 airframe, it was installed with full defensive armament including MG 131 and MG 81Z machine guns. It was to be powered by two Jumo 211A-1s, D-1s or F-2s.

===Later H variants, H-11 to H-20===
In the summer of 1942, the H-11, based on the H-3 was introduced. With the H-11, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; had at its disposal a powerful medium bomber with heavier armour and revised defensive armament. The drum-fed MG 15 was replaced with a belt-fed MG 131 in a fully-enclosed dorsal position (&quot;B-Stand&quot;); the gunner in the latter was protected with armoured glass. The MG 15 in the ventral &quot;C-Stand&quot; or &quot;Bola&quot; was also replaced, with a belt-fed MG 81Z with much higher rate of fire. The beam positions originally retained their MG 15s but the H-11/R1 replaced these with twin MG 81Z which was standardized in November 1942. The port internal ESAC bomb racks could be removed and an fuel tank installed. Many H-11s were equipped with a new PVC rack under the fuselage, which carried five bombs. Additional armour plating was fitted around crew spaces, some of it on the lower fuselage which could be jettisoned in an emergency. Engines were two Junkers Jumo 211F-2, allowing this variant to carry a load to a range of . Heinkel built 230 new aircraft of this type and converted 100 H-3s to H-11s by the summer of 1943.
The third mass production model of the He 111H was the H-16, entering production in late 1942. Armament was as on the H-11, except that the MG FF cannon was removed, as the H-16s were seldom employed on low-level missions, and was replaced with an MG 131 in a flexible installation in the nose (&quot;A-Stand&quot;). On some aircraft, He 111 H-16/R1, the dorsal position was replaced by a &quot;Drehlafette&quot; DL 131 electrically powered turret, armed with an MG 131. The two beam and the aft ventral positions were provided with MG 81Zs, as on the H-11. The two Jumo 211 F-2 provided a maximum speed of at ; cruising speed was and service ceiling was . &quot;Funkgerät&quot; (FuG) radio equipment. FuG 10P, FuG 16, FuBl Z and APZ 6 were fitted for communication and navigation at night, while some aircraft received the FuG 101a radio altimeter. The H-16 retained its eight ESAC internal bomb cells; four bomb cells, as on previous versions could be replaced by a fuel tank to increase range. ETC 2000 racks could be installed over the bomb cell openings for external weapons carriage. Empty weight was and the aircraft weighed fully loaded for take off. German factories built 1,155 H-16s between the end of 1942 and the end of 1943; in addition, 280 H-6s and 35 H-11s were updated to H-16 standard. An undetermined number of H variants were fitted with the FuG 200 &quot;Hohentwiel&quot;. The radar was adapted as an anti-shipping detector for day or night operations.

The last major production variant was the H-20, which entered into production in early 1944. It was planned to use two Junkers Jumo 213E-1 engines, turning three-blade, Junkers VS 11 wooden-bladed variable-pitch propellers. It would appear this plan was never developed fully. Though the later H-22 variant was given the 213E-1 engines, the 211F-2 remained the H-20&#x27;s main power plant. Heinkel and its licensees built 550 H-20s through the summer of 1944, while 586 H-6s were upgraded to H-20 standard.

In contrast to the H-11 and H-16, the H-20, equipped with two Jumo 211F-2s, had more powerful armament and radio communications. The defensive armament consisted of an MG 131 in an A-Stand gun pod for the forward mounted machine gun position. One rotatable &quot;Drehlafette&quot; DL 131/1C (or E) gun mount in the B-stand was standard and later, MG 131 machine guns were added. Navigational direction-finding gear was also installed. The &quot;Peil&quot; G6 was added to locate targets and the FuBI 2H blind landing equipment was built in to help with night operations. The radio was a standard FuG 10, TZG 10 and FuG 16Z for navigating to the target. The H-20 also was equipped with barrage balloon cable-cutters. The bomb load of the H-20 could be mounted on external ETC 1000 racks or four ESAC 250 racks. The sub variant H-20/R4 could carry twenty bombs externally.

=== He 111Z ===
The He 111Z &quot;Zwilling&quot; () was a design that mated two He 111s. The design was originally conceived to tow the Messerschmitt Me 321 glider. Initially, four He 111 H-6s were modified. This resulted in an aircraft with twin fuselages and five engines. They were tested at Rechlin in 1941, and the pilots rated them highly.
A batch of ten were produced and five were built from existing H-6s. The machines were joined by a center wing formed by two sections in length. The powerplants were five Junkers Jumo 211F engines producing each. The total fuel capacity was . This was increased by adding four drop tanks. The He111Z could tow a Gotha Go 242 or Messerschmitt Me 321 &quot;Gigant&quot; gliders for up to 10 hours at cruising speed. It could also remain airborne if the three central powerplants failed. The He 111 Z-2 and Z-3 were also planned as heavy bombers carrying of bombs and having a range of . The ETC installations allowed for a further four drop tanks to be installed.

The He 111 Z-2 could carry four Henschel Hs 293 anti-ship missiles, which were guided by the FuG 203b Kehl III missile control system. With this load, the He 111Z had a range of and a speed of . The maximum bombload was . To increase power, the five Jumo 211F-2 engines were intended to be fitted with Hirth TK 11 superchargers. Onboard armament was the same as the He 111H-6, with the addition of one MG 151/20 cannon in a rotating gun-mount on the center section.

The layout of the He 111Z had the pilot and his controls in the port fuselage only. The controls themselves and essential equipment were all that remained in the starboard section. The aircraft had a crew of seven; a pilot, first mechanic, radio operator and gunner in the port fuselage, and the observer, second mechanic and gunner in the starboard fuselage.

The Z-3 was to be a reconnaissance version and would have had additional fuel tanks, increasing its range to . Production was due to take place in 1944, just as bomber production was being abandoned. The long-range variants failed to come to fruition. The He 111Z was to have been used in an invasion of Malta in 1942 and as part of an airborne assault on the Soviet cities of Astrakhan and Baku in the Caucasus in the same year. During the Battle of Stalingrad their use was cancelled due to insufficient airfield capacity. Later in 1943, He111Zs helped evacuate German equipment and personnel from the Caucasus region, and during the Allied invasion of Sicily, attempted to deliver reinforcements to the island.

During operations, the He 111Z did not have enough power to lift a fully loaded Me 321. Some He 111s were supplemented by rocket pods for extra takeoff thrust, but this was not a fleet-wide action. Two rockets were mounted beneath each fuselage and one underneath each wing. This added in weight. The pods were released by parachute after takeoff.

The He 111Z&#x27;s operational history was minimal. One machine was caught by RAF fighter aircraft over France on 14 March 1944. The He 111Z was towing a Gotha Go 242, and was shot down. Eight were shot down or destroyed on the ground in 1944.

==Production==
To meet demand for numbers, Heinkel constructed a factory at Oranienburg. On 4 May 1936, construction began, and exactly one year later the first He 111 rolled off the production line. The Ministry of Aviation Luftwaffe administration office suggested that Ernst Heinkel lend his name to the factory. The &quot;Ernst Heinkel GmbH&quot; was established with a share capital of . Heinkel was given a share. The factory itself was built by, and belonged to, the German state. From this production plant, 452 He 111s and 69 Junkers Ju 88s were built in the first year of the war. German production for the Luftwaffe amounted to 808 He 111s by September 1939. According to Heinkel&#x27;s memoirs, a further 452 were built in 1939, giving a total of 1,260. &quot;1940s production suffered extreme losses during the Battle of Britain, with 756 bombers lost&quot;.
The He 111&#x27;s rival – the Ju 88 – had increased production to 1,816 aircraft, some 26 times the number from the previous year. Losses were also considerable the previous year over the Balkans and Eastern Fronts. To compensate, He 111 production was increased to 950 in 1941. In 1942, this increased further to 1,337 He 111s. The Ju 88 production figures were even higher still, exceeding 3,000 in 1942, of which 2,270 were bomber variants. In 1943, He 111 increased to 1,405 aircraft. The Ju 88 still outnumbered it in production as its figures reached 2,160 for 1943. The Allied bomber offensives in 1944 and in particular Big Week failed to stop or damage production at Heinkel. Up until the last quarter of 1944, 756 Heinkel He 111s had been built, while Junkers produced 3,013 Ju 88s, of which 600 were bomber versions. During 1939–1944, a total of 5,656 Heinkel He 111s were built compared to 9,122 Ju 88s. As the Luftwaffe was on the strategic defensive, bomber production and that of the He 111 was suspended. Production in September 1944, the last production month for the He 111, included 118 bombers. Of these 21 Junkers Ju 87s, 74 Junkers Ju 188s, 3 Junkers Ju 388s and 18 Arado Ar 234s were built. Of the Heinkel variants, zero Heinkel He 177s were produced and just two Heinkel He 111s were built.

===Exports===
In 1937, 24 He 111 F-1s were bought by the Turkish Air Force. The Turks also ordered four He 111 G-5s. China also ordered 12 He 111 A-0s, but at a cost 400,000 &quot;Reichsmark&quot; (RM). The aircraft were crated up and transported by sea. According to other sources, China got only six He 111 K (export version of He 111 A), delivered in 1936. At the end of the Spanish Civil War, the Spanish Air Force acquired 59 He 111 &quot;survivors&quot; and a further six He 111s in 1941–1943. Bulgaria was given one He 111 H-6, Romania received 10 E-3s, 32 H-3s and 10 H-6s. Two H-10s and three H-16s were given to Slovakia, Hungary was given three He 111Bs and 12–13 He 111s by 6 May 1941. A further 80 P-1s were ordered but only 13 arrived. Towards the end of 1944, 12 He 111 Hs were delivered. The Japanese were due to receive 44 He 111Fs but in 1938 the agreement was cancelled.

==Operational history==

The Heinkel He 111 served the Luftwaffe across the European theatre as a medium bomber until 1943, when a loss of air superiority resulted in it being relegated to a transport role.

The Spanish supplemented the German-built He 111s still in service with licence-built CASA 2.111s from 1950. The last of the German-built aircraft were still in service in 1958.

==Surviving aircraft==
Five original German-built He 111s are on display or in museums around the world (not including major components):
* He 111 E-1 &quot;Pedro&quot; (code 25+82), Wk Nr 2940 with the &quot;conventional&quot; cockpit is on display at the Museo del Aire, Madrid, Spain.
* A mostly complete He 111 P-2 (5J+CN), &quot;Werknummer&quot; 1526 of 5.&quot;Staffel&quot;/&quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 54 (KG 54—Bomber Wing 54), is on display at the Royal Norwegian Air Force Museum at Gardermoen, part of the Norwegian Armed Forces Aircraft Collection. The 5J &quot;Geschwaderkennung&quot; code on the aircraft is usually documented as being that of either I. Gruppe/KG 4 or KG 100 with B3 being KG 54&#x27;s equivalent code throughout the war.
* An He 111 H-20 (&quot;Stammkennzeichen&quot; of NT+SL), Wk Nr 701152, a troop-carrying version is on display at the RAF Museum Hendon, London. Appropriated by USAAF pilots in France at the end of the war, it was left in Britain following the unit&#x27;s return to the US, and taken on by the RAF.
* In September 2004, an He 111 H-2 (&quot;Stammkennzeichen&quot; of 6N+NH), and Wk Nr 2320 was salvaged from Jonsvatnet, a Norwegian lake, and has since been moved to Germany for restoration. The aircraft was formerly assigned to 1. &quot;Staffel&quot;/&quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 100, and was abandoned when the lake&#x27;s surface ice began to melt, sometime in late 1940.
* In 2019, a CASA 2.111B slated for restoration by the Kent Battle of Britain Museum was discovered to be a refitted He 111 H-16.

<text>Nordic skiing encompasses the various types of skiing in which the toe of the ski boot is fixed to the binding in a manner that allows the heel to rise off the ski, unlike alpine skiing, where the boot is attached to the ski from toe to heel. Recreational disciplines include cross-country skiing and Telemark skiing.

Olympic events are competitive cross-country skiing, ski jumping and Nordic combined — an event combining cross-country skiing and ski jumping. The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships host these sports every odd-numbered year, but there are also separate championships in other events, such as Telemark skiing and ski flying. Biathlon combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting, but is not included as a Nordic discipline under the rules of the International Ski Federation (FIS). Instead, it comes under the jurisdiction of the International Biathlon Union.

The biomechanics of competitive cross-country skiing and ski jumping have been the subject of serious study. Cross-country skiing requires strength and endurance and ski jumping requires aerodynamic efficiency, both of which requirements translate into specific skills
to be optimized in training and competition.

== Origins ==

Recreational skiing began with organized skiing exercises and races of the Norwegian and Swedish infantries. Military races and exercises included downhill in rough terrain, target practice while skiing downhill, and 3 km cross-country skiing with full military backpack. Slalom (Norwegian: &quot;slalåm&quot;) is a word of Norwegian origin that has entered the international skiing vocabulary. In the 1800s skiers in Telemark challenged each other on &quot;wild slopes&quot; (&quot;ville låmir&quot;), more gentle slopes had the adjective &quot;sla&quot;. Some races were on &quot;bumpy courses&quot; (&quot;kneikelåm&quot;) and sometimes included &quot;steep jumps&quot; (&quot;sprøytehopp&quot;) for difficulty. These 19th century races in Telemark ran along particularly difficult trails usually from a steep mountain, along timber-slides and ended with a sharp turn (&quot;Telemark turn&quot;) on a field or icy lake.

== Skate skiing ==
Skate skiing is a type of skiing where the skier pushes off the ground with their foot to gain speed. This technique was developed in the mid-1980s and since 1985 many races had different races for classic skiing and skate skiing due to the speed of skate skiing. Skate skiing uses many techniques for different terrains.

== Classic skiing ==
Classic skiing was the first type of skiing used. Classic skis use grips on the bottom of the ski for the skier to kick off of. This technique is considered slower than skate skiing.

== Venues ==

<text>Online chat is any direct text-, audio- or video-based (webcams), one-on-one or one-to-many (group) chat (formally also known as synchronous conferencing), using tools such as instant messengers, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), talkers and possibly MUDs or other online games. Online chat includes web-based applications that allow communication – often directly addressed, but anonymous between users in a multi-user environment. Web conferencing is a more specific online service, that is often sold as a service, hosted on a web server controlled by the vendor. Online chat may address point-to-point communications as well as multicast communications from one sender to many receivers and voice and video chat, or may be a feature of a web conferencing service.

&quot;Online chat&quot; in a narrower sense is any kind of communication over the Internet that offers a real-time transmission of text messages from sender to receiver. Chat messages are generally short in order to enable other participants to respond quickly. Thereby, a feeling similar to a spoken conversation is created, which distinguishes chatting from other text-based online communication forms such as Internet forums and email. The expression &quot;online chat&quot; comes from the word &quot;&quot; which means &quot;informal conversation&quot;.

Synchronous conferencing or synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) is any form of computer-mediated communication that occurs in real-time; that is, there is no significant delay between sending and receiving messages. SCMC includes real-time forms of text, audio, and video communication. SCMC has been highly studied in the context of e-learning.

== History ==
The first online chat system was called Talkomatic, created by Doug Brown and David R. Woolley in 1973 on the PLATO System at the University of Illinois. It offered several channels, each of which could accommodate up to five people, with messages appearing on all users&#x27; screens character-by-character as they were typed. Talkomatic was very popular among PLATO users into the mid-1980s. In 2014, Brown and Woolley released a web-based version of Talkomatic.

The first online system to use the actual command &quot;chat&quot; was created for The Source in 1979 by Tom Walker and Fritz Thane of Dialcom, Inc.

Other chat platforms flourished during the 1980s. Among the earliest with a GUI was BroadCast, a Macintosh extension that became especially popular on university campuses in America and Germany.

The first transatlantic Internet chat took place between Oulu, Finland and Corvallis, Oregon in February 1989.

The first dedicated online chat service that was widely available to the public was the CompuServe CB Simulator in 1980, created by CompuServe executive Alexander &quot;Sandy&quot; Trevor in Columbus, Ohio. Ancestors include network chat software such as UNIX &quot;talk&quot; used in the 1970s.

Chat is implemented in many video-conferencing tools. A study of chat use during work-related videoconferencing found that chat during meetings allows participants to communicate without interrupting the meeting, plan action around common resources, and enables greater inclusion. The study also found that chat can cause distractions and information asymmetries between participants.

== Types ==
According to the type of media used, synchronous conferencing can be divided into
* audio conferencing: only audio is used 
* video conferencing: Both audio (voice) and video and pictures are used.

According to the number of access point used, synchronous conferencing can be divided into 
* point-to-point: Only two computers are connected end to end.
* multi-point: Two or more than two computers are connected.

== Methods ==
Some of the methods used in synchronous conferencing are:
* Chat (text only): Multiple participants can be logged into the conference and can interactively share resources and ideas. There is also an option to save the chat and archive it for later review.
* Voice (telephone or voice-over IP): This is a conference call between the instructor and the participating students where they can speak through a built-in microphone or a headset.
* Video conferencing: This may or may not require the participants to have their webcams running. Usually, a video conference involves a live feed from a classroom or elsewhere or content.
* Web conferencing: This includes Webinar (Web-based seminar) as well. Unlike in video conferencing, participants of web conferencing can access a wider variety of media elements. Web conferences are comparatively more interactive and usually incorporate chat sessions as well.
* Virtual worlds: In this setup, students can meet in the virtual world and speak with each other through headsets and VoIP. This can make learning more productive and engaging when the students can navigate the worlds and operate in their avatar.

== Synchronous vs asynchronous conferencing ==
Both synchronous and asynchronous conferencing are online conferencing where the participants can interact while being physically located at different places in the world. Asynchronous conferencing allows the students to access the learning material at their convenience while synchronous conferencing requires that all participants including the instructor and the students be online at the time of the conference.

While synchronous conferencing enables real-time interaction of the participants, asynchronous conferencing allows participants to post messages and others can respond to it at any convenient time. Sometimes a combination of both synchronous and asynchronous conferencing is used. Both methods give a permanent record of the conference.

== Critical factors for effective implementation ==
There are four critical factors identified for implementing synchronous conferencing for effective instruction to the students
* Video and audio quality which depends on technical factors like higher bandwidth and processing capabilities of the system.
* Training time depends on the familiarity and proficiency of the instructors and the students with the technology.
* Teaching strategies depend on the adaptability of the instructors to the new methods, preparing appropriate and effective training materials, and motivating students.
* Direct meeting of the instructor and the students.

== Synchronous conferencing in higher education ==
Synchronous conferencing in education helps in the delivery of content through digital media. Since this is real-time teaching, it also brings the benefits of face-to-face teaching in distance learning. Many higher education institutions offer well-designed quality e-learning opportunities. 
Some of the advantages of synchronous conferencing in education are:
* Helps the students to connect with not only their teachers and peers but also with recognized experts in the field regardless of the geographical distance and different time zones.
* Provides opportunities for both the teachers and the students to expand their knowledge outside the classroom.
* Helps students who are home-bound or limited mobility to connect with their classrooms and participate in learning.
* Helps the faculties to conduct classes when they are not able to come to classes due to an emergency.
* Supports real-time collaboration, interaction, and immediate feedback
* Encourage students to learn together and in turn, develop cultural understanding
* Personalized learning experience for the students
* Real-time discussion opportunities for students promoting student engagement
* Active interaction can lead to an associated community of like-minded students
* Saves travel expenses and time

== Implementation of educational technology ==
The tools for implementing synchronous conferencing depend on the type of educational problem addressed. This is in turn decides the method of synchronous conferencing to be used and the tool to be used in the learning context. The tool selected addresses the problem of improving the learning outcomes which cannot be solved with an asynchronous environment. There are many tools and platforms available for synchronous conferencing.
* Smartphone applications
* Web conferencing tools
* Video conferencing tools
* Video and hangout platforms
* Shared whiteboards
The selection of tools and platforms also depends on the group size which depends on the activity for the course design.

== Chatiquette ==
The term &quot;chatiquette&quot; (chat etiquette) is a variation of netiquette (Internet etiquette) and describes basic rules of online communication. These conventions or guidelines have been created to avoid misunderstandings and to simplify the communication between users. Chatiquette varies from community to community and generally describes basic courtesy. As an example, it is considered rude to write only in upper case, because it appears as if the user is shouting. The word &quot;chatiquette&quot; has been used in connection with various chat systems (e.g. Internet Relay Chat) since 1995.

Chatrooms can produce a strong sense of online identity leading to impression of subculture.

Chats are valuable sources of various types of information, the automatic processing of which is the object of chat/text mining technologies.

== Limitations ==
Some limitations for synchronous conferencing in learning are:
* Disjointed discussions, not connected in time
* Lack of effective moderation and/or clear guidelines for learners
* Difficulty in collaborating on online projects
* Lack of proper communication with the instructor and students.
* Technical issues may arise if not analysed and planned in advance
* Lack of familiarity with the tools
* Limited time to complete the learning activity and to incorporate interactions with the learners

== Social criticism ==
Criticism of online chatting and text messaging include concern that they replace proper English with shorthand or with an almost completely new hybrid language.

Writing is changing as it takes on some of the functions and features of speech. Internet chat rooms and rapid real-time teleconferencing allow users to interact with whoever happens to coexist in cyberspace. These virtual interactions involve us in &#x27;talking&#x27; more freely and more widely than ever before. With chatrooms replacing many face-to-face conversations, it is necessary to be able to have quick conversation as if the person were present, so many people learn to type as quickly as they would normally speak. Some critics are wary that this casual form of speech is being used so much that it will slowly take over common grammar; however, such a change has yet to be seen.

With the increasing population of online chatrooms there has been a massive growth of new words created or slang words, many of them documented on the website Urban Dictionary. Sven Birkerts wrote:
&quot;as new electronic modes of communication provoke similar anxieties amongst critics who express concern that young people are at risk, endangered by a rising tide of information over which the traditional controls of print media and the guardians of knowledge have no control on it&quot;.

In Guy Merchant&#x27;s journal article Teenagers in Cyberspace: An Investigation of Language Use and Language Change in Internet Chatrooms; Merchant says
&quot;that teenagers and young people are in the leading the movement of change as they take advantage of the possibilities of digital technology, drastically changing the face of literacy in a variety of media through their uses of mobile phone text messages, e-mails, web-pages and on-line chatrooms. This new literacy develops skills that may well be important to the labor market but are currently viewed with suspicion in the media and by educationalists. Merchant also says &quot;Younger people tend to be more adaptable than other sectors of society and, in general, quicker to adapt to new technology. To some extent they are the innovators, the forces of change in the new communication landscape.&quot; In this article he is saying that young people are merely adapting to what they were given.

<doc id="174498" wikidata="Q28874438" url="?curid=174498" title="Count of Paris">
<text>Count of Paris () was a title for the local magnate of the district around Paris in Carolingian times. After Hugh Capet was elected King of the Franks in 987, the title merged into the crown and fell into disuse. However, it was later revived by the Orléanist pretenders to the French throne in an attempt to evoke the legacy of Capet and his dynasty.

==Orléanist counts==
===July Monarchy===
In 1838, during the July Monarchy, King Louis-Philippe I granted the title to his newly born grandson, Philippe. After Louis-Philippe abdicated during the French Revolution of 1848, Orléanist monarchists considered Philippe and his descendants to be the legitimate heirs to the throne. In 1870, at the beginning of the French Third Republic, Philippe and the Orléanists agreed to support the legitimist pretender, Henri, Count of Chambord, but resumed Philippe&#x27;s claims after Henri&#x27;s death in 1883.

* 1838–1848: Philippe, Count of Paris (1838–1894)

===Counts of Paris without legal creation===
In 1929, Orléanist pretender Jean d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Guise (1874-1940) granted the title &quot;Count of Paris&quot; to his only son Henri d&#x27;Orléans (1908–1999), a courtesy title Henri retained until his death and under which he was best known. After him, the title has been adopted by his successors in capacity as the Orléanist pretender to the French throne.

* 1929–1999: Henri, Count of Paris (1908–1999)
* 1999–2019: Henri, Count of Paris (1933–2019)
* 2019–present: Jean, Count of Paris (born 1965)

The next in line is Jean&#x27;s eldest son, Prince Gaston Louis Antoine Marie d’Orléans (born 2009).

<text>Hindhead is a village in the Waverley district of the ceremonial county of Surrey, England. It is the highest village in the county and its buildings are between and above sea level. The village forms part of the Haslemere parish. Situated on the county border with Hampshire, it is best known as the location of the Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl, a beauty spot and site of special scientific interest. 

The A3 between Portsmouth and London was crossed by the A287 between Hook and Haslemere. The A3 now passes under Hindhead in the Hindhead Tunnel and its route along the Punch Bowl has been removed and landscaped, but the crossroads still exists for local traffic, as a double mini-roundabout. Hindhead is south-west of Guildford and on the border with Hampshire. It is a ward in the district of Waverley, and part of the civil parish of Haslemere. The ward, which includes Beacon Hill, had a population of 4,292 at the 2011 Census. The name &quot;Hindhead&quot; is first attested in 1571, and means &quot;hill frequented by hinds&quot;, or female deer.

==Geography==
===Land use, elevations and soil types===
The settled parts of the village are elevated relative to all of the surrounding parishes and are a mixture of paved streets and wooded roads as well as agricultural smallholdings, which are few compared with other parts of Waverley District. Hindhead has the 2nd and 13th highest hills in Surrey: Gibbet Hill and Hatch Farm Hill, at and above sea level respectively. These rise gradually from the rest of the village towards the north of the Greensand Ridge, upon which the village wholly lies. The soil is near its surface a sort of crumbly sandstone here known as greensand which breaks up forest into acidic heathland in many places. It supports endemic types of fungi, ferns, gorse and heather.

===Features===
The north of the village forms the Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl, a large wooded beauty spot and a site of special scientific interest. Much of the north and east of the village is rolling woodland which forms part of the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.
==History==

This area was notorious for highwaymen. In 1736, Stephen Phillips, a robber tried and convicted at the Old Bailey, admitted to the Newgate chaplain to having stolen 150 guineas in gold on the road towards London. In 1786, three men were convicted of the murder of an unknown sailor on his way from London to rejoin his ship, a deed commemorated by several memorials in the area. The perpetrators were hung in chains to warn others on Gibbet Hill, a short walk away on top of the Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl. With an increase in traffic and opening of the London to Portsmouth railway line removing much of the road transport of freight, such incidents reduced during the 19th century.

Hindhead became a substantial settlement in the late 19th century. In 1904 a temporary mission church was built to serve the new community. An architectural competition to design a permanent church, that of St Albans in Beacon Hill, was held in 1906, and John Duke Coleridge (1879–1934) was chosen as the architect. The first phase, comprising the chancel, north chapel, transept and the lower stage of a projected bell tower, was completed by 1907, and the church gained its own parish in the same year. A series of windows by the Arts and Crafts designers Karl Parsons and Christopher Whall were installed in the unfinished church between 1908 and 1912. The three eastern bays of the nave were consecrated in 1915, but the two western bays were not built until 1929–31; the bell-tower was never completed and became in effect a south transept. There followed two additional stained-glass windows: by Christopher Webb in 1945 and by Francis Skeat in 1950. A large vestry extension was added in 1964. A fire in 1999 destroyed the original high altar and reredos paintings.

==Notable people==

* Grant Allen (1848–1899), the Canadian-born novelist, lived at &quot;Hilltop&quot;. Conan Doyle was one of Allen&#x27;s neighbours and became his friend; he completed Allen&#x27;s novel &quot;Hilda Wade&quot; after Allen&#x27;s death.
* Peter Alliss (1931–2020), professional golfer and commentator, lived in Hindhead.
*Sir Arthur Conan Doyle lived at &quot;Undershaw&quot; from 1897 to 1907. Here he wrote some of his best-known novels, including &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;. Undershaw later became a hotel and restaurant, but this closed in 2004 and the property is now a school. Conan Doyle was Hindhead Golf Club&#x27;s first President in 1904.
* Miss James built and lived at West Down, donating land to the National Trust which now features Miss James&#x27; Walk and the Miss James footbridge over the A3 road. 
* Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery (1887–1976) took the title of &quot;Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, of Hindhead in the County of Surrey&quot; when he was raised to the peerage in 1946.
* Playwright George Bernard Shaw lived at &quot;Blen Cathra&quot; in Hindhead, now the site of St Edmund&#x27;s School.
* Diplomat and writer Humphrey Trevelyan was born at the parsonage in Hindhead.
* The scientist John Tyndall (1820–1893) lived and died at &quot;Tyndalls&quot;, now known as &quot;Hindhead House&quot;. He is best known for his work on the discovery of the greenhouse effect.

==Government==
For the purposes of local government, Hindhead is within the civil parish of Haslemere, the district of Waverley and the county of Surrey. Hindhead forms a ward for elections to Haslemere Town Council and Waverley Borough Council, and is part of the Waverley Western Villages electoral division for Surrey County Council elections. The ward elects a single county councillor, two district councillors and five town councillors. 

Hindhead is within the UK constituency of South West Surrey and was in the European constituency of South East England.

==Transport==

Until 2011, Hindhead village was situated on the main A3 road between London and Portsmouth. In that year, a £371 million bypass was completed, reducing the amount of traffic passing through the village. The bypass includes the twin-bore tunnel, the longest non-estuarial road tunnel in the UK.

The village is served by the A287, between Hook and Haslemere, and the A333, a stretch of the former A3 that links the village south to the new bypass. The section of the old A3 north of Hindhead and alongside the Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl has been returned to tree-interspersed heathland.

The nearest railway station is at Haslemere, away, on the Portsmouth Direct Line between London Waterloo and Portsmouth Harbour stations. Hindhead is served by several Stagecoach South bus routes linking nearby towns and villages and connections further afield, and National Express Coaches between Portsmouth and London.

==Nearest settlements==
Neighbouring settlements are Beacon Hill (administratively part of Hindhead, while geographically separate) and Grayshott village. The town of Haslemere is to the southeast, whilst the considerably larger town of Guildford is to the north-east. London is to the north-east.

<doc id="174506" wikidata="Q2795960" url="?curid=174506" title="Fetcham">
<text>Fetcham is a suburban village in the Mole Valley district, in Surrey, England west of the town of Leatherhead, on the other side of the River Mole and has a mill pond, springs and an associated nature reserve. The housing, as with adjacent Great Bookham, sits on the lower slopes of the North Downs north of Polesden Lacey (NT). Fetcham Grove has Leatherhead and the village&#x27;s main leisure centre and football club, between the two settlements. Fetcham has two short parades of shops and services, several sports teams and parks and a small number of large pubs and food premises.

Neighbouring Bookham and Leatherhead have railway stations and a junction of the M25 London Orbital Motorway is a 3-mile (4.8-km) journey from it passing alongside the River Mole beyond a brief upland made up of most of Fetcham&#x27;s remaining farms and wooded Great Bookham Common demarcating Fetcham&#x27;s northern border. The northern few square miles and the larger North Downs are protected Green Belt, forming a buffer between Stoke D&#x27;Abernon (the south of Cobham post town) and Dorking respectively.

==History==
The name Fetcham is derived from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Fecca&#x27;s ham&quot; – Fecca&#x27;s settlement. Fetcham lay within the Copthorne hundred.

Indeed, there is evidence that there were even earlier settlements, with the discovery of Stone and Bronze Age tools and Roman artefacts, as well as three ancient burial grounds.

Fetcham appears in Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Feceham&quot;. It was held partly by William the Conqueror; partly by Richard from the Bishop of Bayeux partly by Oswald the Thegn. Its Domesday assets were: 7 hides; 5½ mills worth 17s; 10½ ploughs; 2 oxen; of meadow; woodland, herbage and pannage worth 23 hogs. It rendered £10 10s 0d per year to its feudal system overlords per year. Fetcham, therefore, was referenced in the Domesday survey as three manors; one known as King&#x27;s Manor was probably Fetcham Park; another was given to Odo, Bishop of Bayeux after the Norman conquest. The third was an Augustinian foundation from Merton Priory, at Cannon Court, which Henry VIII dissolved in 1538.

Its small manorial farming community numbered 176 in the survey, but halved as a result of the Black Death in 1349. In the first half of the nineteenth century the population was still only around 370 . In the 1931 census it had reached 1,318 and by 1972 was 7,331.

St Mary&#x27;s Church has been a place of Christian worship for over 1000 years. Built during Anglo-Saxon and early Norman periods, it is probably on the site of an even earlier timber church. There are many hints of its past in its structure. These include the south-west quoin of the nave, and a single splay window high on the south wall with traces of Roman brick as well as arches that are presumed to pre-date 1066.

In 1951 the civil parish had a population of 4178. On 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished.

==Topography==
The village of Fetcham is slightly larger than the English non-city parish average; extending from the River Mole at the village&#x27;s east side, it is bounded by the neighbouring villages of Great Bookham and Little Bookham on its west.

==Amenities and landmarks==
Although at the eastern extreme, the historic B2122 Guildford Road/Waterlow Road which has mixed use splits north and east with two bridges to Leatherhead, Fetcham is centred on its own road The Street, with wide-ranging convenience shops, some small restaurants/take-aways, community halls, large public houses as well as nearby churches.
The Fetcham Conservation Area includes the impressive 18th-century mansion of Fetcham Park House. The Salt Box, The Well House, The Dower House and Ballands Hall are four of a cluster of old buildings in that area. Others are sparingly strewn throughout Fetcham including at Grade II*: Le Pelerin and Thorncroft Manor.

The Mill Pond springs are a large number of chalk springs, still used to supply potable tap water. These springs continued to supply water during the droughts of 1976 and 2006.

There are four Christian congregations in the village:
* Cannon Court Evangelical Church, in Cannonside
* Church of the Holy Spirit (RC), in Bell Lane
* Christ Church Fetcham, which meets in Oakfield Junior School
* St Mary&#x27;s Church Grade II* listed medieval, off The Ridgeway

To its south are the Fetcham and Leatherhead Downs, which are a part of the North Downs.

==Education==
There are two village schools:
* Fetcham Infants School for ages 4–7 with an attached pre-school for ages 2½–4. The original school, nearby, opened in 1820. On the present site, the distinctive white former main building, now a classroom, was built in 1854 and added to and enlarged in 1874 and 1886. A four-classroom block and staff room was built in 1936, to accommodate children from the significant residential growth in the village. A new hall and servery were added in 1982.
* Oakfield Junior School for 256 pupils ages 7–11. The present school opened (as Fetcham County School) in September 1963.

==Culture, sport and social life==
Fetcham&#x27;s sole pub, &quot;The Bell&quot; was built in brick in the 1930s on the site of an earlier pub, opposite Fetcham Infants School. It changed ownership several times in the late 20th century until it was bought by the Youngs brewery chain in 2004, when it had a major refit, followed by another in late 2007. The Bell is mentioned in The Good Food Guide and holds a pub quiz on Mondays.

The large Village Hall in The Street is home to several organisations, including Fetcham Village Women&#x27;s Institute. It was also the venue for several early performances by the influential band John&#x27;s Children, which included sometime frontman Marc Bolan.

There is also a small reading room that can be hired for private functions, on Cobham Road just north of the railway.

There was a social club, called the Fetcham Sports and Social Club, but this closed in 2001 after the membership dwindled. The building is now used as offices.

1st Fetcham Scout Group, headquartered in Cock Lane, has three Cub Scout packs and two Scout Troops, as well as Beavers. 
Fetcham Explorers share the 1st Fetcham Scout Group hall and facilities.

Fetcham FC football club no longer exists, Fetcham Park United formed in 1971 is now an adult amateur Charter Standard football club affiliated with the Surrey FA. Its two teams play in Division 1 and Division 5 of the Leatherhead &amp; District Sunday Football League. The home ground was formerly the Cock Lane Recreation Ground in Fetcham but the teams now play home games at Priest Hill Playing Fields, in Epsom.

==Transport==
All parts of the large village are within of a railway station giving easy access to London. The M25 motorway&#x27;s nearest access is J9, just after the one-way square in Leatherhead town centre (enclosing public gardens) or from the south of the village via the Leatherhead bypass and A246. Guildford, Cobham, Epsom and Leatherhead can be reached by the A-road network that has a choice of routes through and around the village.

===Roads===
The main village thoroughfare is the A245 Cobham Road and is partly bounded by and contains partly in the south the east-west, part-dualled A246.

Local bus operator Falcon Buses provides hourly route 479 between Epsom and Guildford through the village.

===Rail===
The New Guildford Line skirts the north of most of the houses in Fetcham, but there is currently no station in the village. There were proposals for a station in the village centre during the 1930s/40s which would have served the main village centre and been located at what is now Hilley Field Lane 
. The nearest stations are Leatherhead, Cobham &amp; Stoke D&#x27;Abernon and Bookham.

==Emergency services==
Fetcham is served by the following emergency services:
* Surrey Police
* South East Coast Ambulance Service as of 1 July 2006. The Surrey, Sussex, and Kent Ambulance services have merged, and no longer exist separately.
* Surrey Fire &amp; Rescue Service, Leatherhead Fire Station is in Fetcham, off Guildford Road, close to the River Mole boundary with Leatherhead.
** Fetcham (Leatherhead) fire station has 28 personnel and one fire engine (water tender ladder). It also has special vehicles, one that is capable of transporting a large quantity of water or foam to an incident (water carrier), and a fire victim support vehicle crewed by the Red Cross.
** Appliances:
*** 1 x water tender ladder
*** 1 x water carrier

==Demography and housing==

The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%. 

The proportion of households who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

<doc id="174509" wikidata="Q88851" url="?curid=174509" title="Henri, Count of Chambord">
<text>Henri, Count of Chambord and Duke of Bordeaux (; 29 September 1820 – 24 August 1883), was the Legitimist pretender to the throne of France as Henri V from 1844 until his death in 1883. 

Henri was the only son of Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry, born after his father&#x27;s death, by his wife, Princess Carolina of Naples and Sicily, daughter of King Francis I of the Two Sicilies. The Duke himself was the younger son of Charles X. As the grandson of Charles X, Henri was a . He was the last legitimate descendant of Louis XV of France in the male line.

==Early life==

Henri d&#x27;Artois was born on 29 September 1820, in the Pavillon de Marsan, a portion of the Tuileries Palace that still survives in the compound of the Louvre Palace in Paris. His father, the &quot;duc de Berry&quot;, had been assassinated seven months before Henri&#x27;s birth.

At birth, Henri was given the title of &quot;duc de Bordeaux&quot;. Because of his birth after his father&#x27;s death, when the senior male line of the House of Bourbon was on the verge of extinction, one of his middle names was &quot;Dieudonné&quot; (French for &quot;God-given&quot;). Royalists called him &quot;the miracle child&quot;. Louis XVIII was overjoyed, bestowing 35 royal orders to mark the occasion. Henri&#x27;s birth was a major setback for the Duke of Orleans&#x27; ambitions to ascend the French throne. During his customary visit to congratulate the newborn&#x27;s mother, the duke made such offensive remarks about the baby&#x27;s appearance that the lady holding him was brought to tears.

==Titular King==

On 2 August 1830, in response to the July Revolution, Henri&#x27;s grandfather, Charles X, abdicated, and twenty minutes later Charles&#x27; elder son Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême, himself renounced his rights, in favour of the young Duke of Bordeaux. Charles X urged his cousin Louis Philippe of Orléans, as &quot;Lieutenant général du royaume&quot;, to proclaim Henri as &quot;Henry V, King of France&quot;. Louis Philippe requested the Duke of Bordeaux to be brought to Paris to have his rights recognised. The duchess of Berry was forbidden to escort her son; therefore, both the grandfather and the mother refused to leave the child in France. As a consequence, after seven days, a period in which legitimist monarchists considered that Henri had been the rightful monarch of France, the Chamber of Deputies decreed that the throne should pass to Louis Philippe, who was proclaimed King of the French on 9 August.

Henri and his family left France and went into exile on 16 August 1830. While some French monarchists recognised him as their sovereign, others disputed the validity of the abdications of his grandfather and of his uncle. Still others recognised the July Monarchy of Louis Philippe. With the deaths of his 79-year-old grandfather in 1836 and of his uncle in 1844, young Henri became the genealogically senior claimant to the French throne. His supporters were called Legitimists, to distinguish them from the Orléanists, the supporters of the family of Louis Philippe.

Henri, who preferred the courtesy title of Count of Chambord (from the château de Chambord, which had been presented to him by the Restoration government, and which was the only significant piece of personal property of which he was allowed to retain ownership upon his exile), continued his claim to the throne throughout the July Monarchy of Louis Philippe, the Second Republic and Empire of Napoléon III, and the early years of the Third Republic.

In November 1846, the Count of Chambord married his second cousin Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este, daughter of Duke Francis IV of Modena and Princess Maria Beatrice of Savoy. The couple had no children.
==Hope of a restoration==

In 1870, as the Second Empire collapsed following its defeat in the Franco-Prussian War at the battle of Sedan on 2 September 1870, the royalists became a majority in the National Assembly. The Orléanists agreed to support the Count of Chambord&#x27;s claim to the throne, with the expectation that upon his death, with him lacking any sons, he would be succeeded by their own claimant, Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, Count of Paris. With Henri backed by both Legitimists and Orléanists, the restoration of monarchy in France seemed a likely possibility. However, he insisted that he would accept the crown only on condition that France abandon its tricolour flag (associated with the French Revolution) and return to the use of the &quot;fleur de lys&quot; flag, comprising the historic royal arms of France. He rejected a compromise whereby the &quot;fleur-de-lys&quot; would be the new king&#x27;s personal standard, and the tricolour would remain the national flag. Pope Pius IX, upon hearing Henri&#x27;s decision, notably remarked &quot;And all that, all that for a napkin!&quot;

In 1873 another attempt to restore the monarchy failed for the same reasons. Henri traveled to Paris and tried to negotiate with the government, to no avail; and on 20 November, the National Assembly confirmed Marshal The 1st Duke of Magenta as Chief of State of France for the next seven years.

==Defeat==
The Third Republic was established (with then Chief of State, the Duke of Magenta, as President of the Republic) to wait for Henri&#x27;s death and his replacement by his distant cousin, the more liberal Count of Paris, of the Orléanist branch of the House of Bourbon. Initially, the monarchist majority in Parliament believed this to be temporary, until such time as the Count of Paris could return to the throne. However, by the time this occurred in 1883, public opinion had swung behind the Republic as the form of government which, in the words of the former President Adolphe Thiers, &quot;divides us least&quot;. Thus, Henri could mockingly be hailed by republicans such as Georges Clemenceau as &quot;the French Washington&quot; – the one man without whom the Republic could not have been founded.

Henri died on 24 August 1883 at his residence in Frohsdorf, Austria, at the age of 62, bringing the male line of Louis XV to an end. He was buried in the crypt of his grandfather Charles X, in the church of the Franciscan Kostanjevica Monastery in Gorizia, Austria (now Slovenia). His personal property, including the Château de Chambord, was left to his nephew Robert I, Duke of Parma, son of Henri&#x27;s late sister.

Henri&#x27;s death left the Legitimist line of succession distinctly confused. On the one hand, Henri himself had accepted that the head of the House of France (as distinguished from the House of Bourbon) would be the head of the Orléans line, i.e. Prince Philippe, Count of Paris. This was accepted by many Legitimists, and was the default on legal grounds; the only surviving Bourbon male line more senior was the branch of the Kings of Spain, descended from King Philip V, which had however renounced its right to inherit the throne of France as a condition of the Treaty of Utrecht. However, several of Henri&#x27;s supporters, including his widow, chose to disregard his statements and the Treaty, arguing that no one had the right to deny that the senior direct male-line Bourbon was the head of the House of France and thus the legitimate King of France; the renunciation of the Spanish branch would be, under this interpretation, illegitimate and therefore void. Thus the &quot;Blancs d&#x27;Espagne&quot;, as they would come to be known, settled on Infante Juan, Count of Montizón, the former Carlist pretender to the Spanish throne, as their claimant to the French crown.
