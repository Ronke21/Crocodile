<text>The First Battle of the Marne or known in France as the Miracle on the Marne () was a battle of the First World War fought from the 5th to the 12th September 1914. The German army invaded France with a plan for winning the war in 40 days by occupying Paris and destroying the French and British armies (Allies/Entente). The Germans had initial successes in August. They were victorious in the Battles of Mons and the Frontiers and overran a large area of northern France and Belgium. In what is called the Great Retreat the Germans pursued the retreating Franco/British forces more than southward. The French and British halted their retreat in the Marne River valley while the Germans advanced to from Paris.

With the battlefield reverses of August, Field Marshal John French, commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), lost faith in his French allies and began to plan for a British retreat to port cities on the English Channel for an evacuation to Britain. However, the French commander Joseph Joffre maintained good order in his retreating army and was able to reinforce it by bringing in additional manpower from his eastern flank and integrating military reserve units into the regular army. By early September, the Franco–British forces outnumbered the Germans who were exhausted after a month-long campaign, had outrun their supply lines, and were suffering shortages. On 3 September the military governor of Paris, Joseph Simon Gallieni, perceived that the German right flank was vulnerable and positioned his forces to attack.

On 4 September Joffre gave the order to launch a counteroffensive. The battle took place between Paris and Verdun, a west to east distance of . The point of decision and the heaviest fighting was in the western one-half of that area. By 9 September, the success of the Franco–British counteroffensive left the German 1st and 2nd Armies at risk of encirclement, and they were ordered to retreat to the Aisne River. The retreating armies were pursued by the French and British. The German armies ceased their retreat after on a line north of the Aisne River, where they dug in on the heights and fought the First Battle of the Aisne. The German retreat from 9 to 12 September marked the end of the German attempt to defeat France quickly. Both sides next commenced reciprocal operations to envelop the northern flank of their opponent in what became known as the Race to the Sea which culminated in the First Battle of Ypres and led to a bloody four-year long stalemate of trench warfare on the Western Front of World War I.

The Battle of the Marne from September 5 to 12 resulted in an estimated 250,000 French casualties, 12,733 British casualties and 298,000 German casualties. Holger Herwig called the Battle of the Marne the most important land battle of the 20th century, while another analyst, John J. Tierney, Jr, argued it was the most important battle in history. The battle is described in French folklore as the &quot;miracle on the Marne.&quot;

==Background==
===The combatants===
Germany declared war on France on 3 August 1914. Both sides expected a short war. Germany faced the specter of a two-front war, facing Russia in the east and France and Britain in the west. German strategy was to defeat France in six weeks and then turn its attention to Russia. As envisioned by the Schlieffen Plan (revised by Helmuth von Moltke), the Germans embarked on a rapid, circular, counter-clockwise offensive through Belgium and into France with the objective of capturing Paris and enveloping and destroying the French army east of Paris within their six-week timetable. The German violation of Belgium&#x27;s neutrality brought Great Britain into the war. Britain sent the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) to France.

Germany created seven armies for service on the western front. Three of them on the German right flank would be most involved in the Battle of the Marne. At the beginning of the war, the First Army numbered 320,000 men commanded by Alexander von Kluck; the Second Army had 260,000 men commanded by Karl von Bülow; and the Third Army commanded by Max von Hausen had 180,000 men. These numbers would be depleted by the time of the Marne Battle. The French army stationed on the western front initially consisted of five armies of which the Fourth Army, commanded by Fernand de Langle de Cary, and the Fifth Army, commanded by Charles Lanrezac, on its left flank would be most involved in the Battle of the Marne. Two additional French armies would be created to stem off the Germany offensive: the 6th Army commanded by Joseph Gallieni, created to protect Paris; and the 9th commanded by Ferdinand Foch. The French armies engaged in the Marne Battle were reinforced by reservists, recruits, and by transfers from other French and colonial armies. French divisions facing the German right wing rose from 17.5 on 23 August to 41 on 6 September, numbering more than 700,000 men. The BEF numbered 130,000 men at the beginning of the war and was commanded by John French.

The Commanders-in-Chiefs of the armies were a study in contrasts. Moltke, the chief of the German General Staff, remained at his headquarters in Luxembourg throughout the battle. He issued General Directives by way of emissaries from his headquarters, but gave his army commanders wide latitude in their operations. By contrast, the French commander, Joseph Joffre, was a whirlwind of activity (although insisting on fine dining and an uninterrupted eight hours of sleep every night). Joffre visited his armies and their commanders frequently, driven by a Grand Prix race car driver. He was ruthless in firing more than 30 French generals who did not meet his standards (or, as some say, who dared to disagree with him). John French, the British commander, was intimidated by the casualties suffered by the British in initial battles and thereafter reluctant to engage the Germans, but finally played an important role in the Battle of the Marne.

The strategies of the French and Germans likewise contrasted. The French focused their attention, troops, and defences in eastern France where they believed the Germans would be most dangerous. They were wrong. The Germans mostly stayed on defence in the east, although blunting French attacks. In the east, France had the objective of regaining Alsace–Lorraine which it had lost to Germany in the Franco-German war of 1870. The French did not fortify their north western border with Belgium as they did not expect the Germans to attack there and also feared being accused of violating Belgian neutrality—and thereby losing British participation in the war. Germany, however, had no compunctions about violating Belgian neutrality as its objective was to win the war quickly before Great Britain could intervene decisively. The French and British were outnumbered in contesting the German offensive through Belgium into France.

The Germans recognized that a long war was not in their interest as the resources of France, Great Britain, and Russia were far greater than their own. To win the war with France quickly would even the odds. To historian Herwig, the Schlieffen Plan, the violation of Belgian neutrality, and the German invasion of France in 1914 were &quot;an all-or-nothing throw of the dice, a high-risk operation born of hubris and bordering on recklessness.&quot;

===The Great Retreat===
The Germans and the French had different strategies for what they anticipated would be a short war. France&#x27;s top priority was to recover Alsace-Lorraine, lost to Germany in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870. Germany&#x27;s priority was to defeat France quickly, so that it could turn its attention to the Russians. Both armies at the beginning of the war believed that offence would prevail over defence. The French military philosophy has been characterized as the &quot;cult of the offensive,&quot; a belief that &quot;elan&quot; (spirit) and &quot;cran&quot; (guts) were the essential elements of military victory. The &quot;most terrible August in the history of the world&quot; proved them wrong as artillery and machine guns triumphed over &quot;elan&quot; and &quot;cran&quot;. A French lieutenant named Charles de Gaulle said &#x27;that all the courage in the world cannot prevail against gunfire.&quot;

August 1914 saw bloody battles, nearly all of which the Germans won, the conquest of most of Belgium by Germany, and the rapid advance of the German armies into France. North and west of Paris, the French and British armies retreated before the German onslaught. East of Paris, the French army launched several offensives into Alsace-Lorraine which failed. France&#x27;s military Plan XVII anticipated that Germany would concentrate most of its forces in eastern France in Alsace-Lorraine and Joffre clung to that belief, although the commander of the 5th French army, Charles Lanrezac, repeatedly warned him that the Germans were attacking Belgium in numbers exceeding those of his own and the BEF. Retired general Joseph Gallieni also warned Joffre that the German&#x27;s main effort was in the northwest, not the east.

On 24 August, Joffre finally acknowledged that his northwestern (left) flank was at risk. He abandoned the aggressive Plan XVII and instead proclaimed that the French armies were &quot;forced to take defensive action...to wear down the enemy&#x27;s strength and resume the offense in due course.&quot; The Great Retreat began in which the French 3rd, 4th, and 5th armies and the BEF on the French left began a retreat, mostly walking rather than fighting. The French were followed by the German 1st (Kluck), 2nd (Bülow), and 3rd (Hausen) armies. Hundreds of thousands of German, French, and British soldiers marched southeast in summer heat, wearing woollen uniforms and carrying packs, the Germans motivated by the belief that they would soon capture Paris and end the war. German commanders exulted in their victories, but Chief of General Staff Moltke was worried. The Germans were capturing few prisoners and arms, an indication that the French and British were retreating in good order, not in panic.

During the retreat, Joffre bolstered his defences. He created two new armies. The 6th was to defend Paris with Gallieni as the Military Governor and Michel-Joseph Maunoury as the commander of the 6th army. Gallieni demanded not only garrison troops but also a mobile force to confront the advancing Germans. The 9th army headed by Ferdinand Foch was stationed between the third and fourth French armies. Utilizing the extensive French railway system, Joffre transferred men from the two eastern armies (the 1st and 2nd) to the Marne and integrated semi-trained French reserves into his defence.

Meanwhile, the attacking Germans had outrun their logistics and attrition among its soldiers was high. Kluck&#x27;s first army had advanced beyond the railhead which supplied it. Sixty per cent of its motor transport had broken down as had fodder wagons carrying hay for horses. Its men had marched since leaving Germany one month earlier, fought several battles, and suffered 20,000 men killed, wounded, and ill. The soldiers were &quot;like living scarecrows.&quot; 
With every mile marched southward, the Germans were more isolated from the sources of their supplies while the French were closer to theirs.

Demands for more soldiers on other fronts in the war (and possible over-confidence) resulted in Moltke reducing the number of German attackers in France by 200,000 or more men in August. He transferred two corps to the eastern front to fight the Russians and assigned another two to besiege Antwerp and Maubeuge. The German 1st and 2nd armies on 1 August had 580,000 soldiers; at the Battle of the Marne they had 372,000. By the eve of the battle, the allied forces between Paris and Verdun numbered 980,000 French and 100,000 British soldiers while the Germans numbered 750,000. The Germans had an advantage in artillery with 3,300 to 3,000 guns.

===The eve of battle===

By 2 September, John Keegan said that &quot;the German strategic effort, though neither Moltke nor Kluck perceived it, was beginning to fall apart&quot;. Moltke realized he did not have sufficient forces to carry out the Schlieffen Plan which envisioned the 1st army of Kluck encircling Paris to the west and south. Instead, he issued a Grand Directive changing the order of battle for the German attack. He ordered that Paris be bypassed on the north. The Germans would now attempt to entrap the French forces between Paris and Verdun. To accomplish this, the 2nd Army of Bülow became the primary striking force with the 1st Army (Kluck) ordered to follow in echelon to protect the western flank of the 2nd. At the time of this Grand Directive, Moltke based his decision on an intercepted radio transmission describing the French retreating across the Marne. Kluck, who was as bold as Bulow was cautious, was not pleased with the change of plans which would require him to halt his advance to wait for Bulow. Instead, interpreting the order broadly (or disobeying it), Kluck turned his line of march from south to southeast, becoming closer but not in echelon with Bülow, and on 3 September his forces crossed the Marne River east of Paris, the first Germans to do so. Kluck was in pursuit of the French 5th army which was still retreating. Kluck&#x27;s boldness was based on his confidence that the French and British were a depleted and defeated force. He was unaware that a new French army, the 6th of Joseph Gallieni and Maunoury, was guarding Paris to his west and he discounted the British Expeditionary Force which had apparently abandoned the battlefield.

The French commander Joffre was preparing for the propitious time when he would counterattack. He reinforced his newly created 6th and 9th armies. On 3 September Joffre dismissed Lanrezac, commander of 5th army, and replaced him with Louis Franchet d&#x27;Espèrey. This was done despite the fact Lanrezac had been right, as Joffre had been wrong, about the German offensive coming from Belgium and had also been right in violating the French &quot;cult of the offensive&quot; by taking a defensive posture against the invading Germans and preserving his army to fight another day. The French government fled Paris on 2 September fearing the Germans would conquer the city.

On 4 September, while meeting with the British General Henry Wilson, d&#x27;Esperey, the new commander of the French 5th army, outlined a plan for a French and British counter-attack on the German 1st Army. The counterattack would come from the south by d&#x27;Esperey&#x27;s 5th Army, the west by the BEF, and at the Ourcq River by Gallieni and Manoury&#x27;s new Sixth Army. Gallieni had come to the same conclusion on 3 September and sent Maunoury and the 6th Army east to find the German&#x27;s flank. On 4 September, Joffre spent much of this afternoon in silent contemplation under an ash tree. At dinner he received word of d’Esperey&#x27;s plan for the counterattack. That night he issued commands to halt the French retreat in his Instruction General No. 5 and ordered the counterattack to begin on 6 September. The BEF was under no obligation to follow orders of the French, but Joffre believed British participation was crucial. Joffre first attempted to use diplomatic channels to convince the British government to apply pressure on BEF commander John French. Then, on 5 September, Joffre journeyed to BEF headquarters for discussions which ended with him banging his hand dramatically on a table while shouting &quot;Monsieur le Maréchal, the honour of England is at stake!&quot; Following this meeting, French agreed to the operational plan to commence the following day.

==The battle==

&quot;At dawn on 6 September, 980,000 French and 100,000 British soldiers with 3,000 guns assaulted the German line of 750,000 men and 3,300 guns between Verdun and Paris.&quot; Joffre had finally found the propitious time to end the Great Retreat and counterattack. The battle would take place in two distinct locations near southern tributaries of the Marne with the French 5th and 9th army assaulting the German&#x27;s 2nd and 3rd armies and north of the Marne between the French 6th army facing the German 1st army. Communications and coordination were poor between German armies and with Moltke&#x27;s headquarters in Luxembourg, each German army would fight its own battle. 
=== Kluck ===
On 5 September, one day before Joffre&#x27;s plan to begin the French offensive, the French and Germans clashed on Kluck&#x27;s 1st army&#x27;s right flank. Part of Maunoury&#x27;s 6th army, made up mostly of reservists and numbering in total 150,000 was probing northeast from Paris near the Ourcq River looking for the Germans when it encountered the IV Reserve Corps of 24,000 men commanded by German general Hans von Gronau. Gronau had the responsibility of covering the outermost right flank of Kluck. He discerned the danger of a flank attack against Kluck and, although greatly outnumbered, attacked the French, holding them off for 24 hours before retreating. Kluck was therefore warned of the unexpected threat to his right flank and indeed his whole army. Kluck chose to mount a counteroffensive. He ordered his army to turn to the right and face west to confront the threat from the 6th French army. This involved a withdrawal of Kluck&#x27;s forces who had crossed the Marne River to the south and now had to march in two days to reach positions facing the French. Kluck&#x27;s swift reaction prevented the 6th Army from advancing across the Ourcq River to the German rear. Kluck moved off French attacks on 6 and 7 September.

On the night of 7–8 September came the most storied event of the Battle of the Marne. Military Governor Gallieni in Paris reinforced the 6th army guarding Paris by shuttling soldiers to the front by rail, truck, and Renault taxis. Gallieni commandeered about six hundred taxicabs at Les Invalides in central Paris to carry soldiers to the front at Nanteuil-le-Haudouin, fifty kilometres away. Most of the taxis were demobilised on 8 September but some remained longer to carry the wounded and refugees. The taxis, following city regulations, dutifully ran their meters. The French treasury reimbursed the total fare of 70,012 francs.

The arrival of six thousand soldiers by rail, truck, and taxi has been described as critical in preventing a possible German breakthrough against the 6th Army. However, in General Gallieni&#x27;s memoirs, he notes how some had &quot;exaggerated somewhat the importance of the taxis.&quot; In 2001, Strachan mentions only the taxis as &quot;fewer than legend&quot; and in 2009 Herwig called the taxis militarily insignificant. The positive impact on French morale was undeniable.

Kluck telegrammed Moltke on the night of 8 September that &quot;The decision will be obtained tomorrow by an enveloping attack by General von Quast.&quot; The next morning Quast fought his way through the defences of the French 6th army and the way to Paris, distant, was open. In Keegan&#x27;s words, &quot;The balance of advantage on the Marne once more seemed to have tilted the Germans&#x27; way.&quot;

=== Bülow and Hausen ===
Bülow&#x27;s 2nd army south of the Marne on 6 September was as worn and depleted as Kluck’s, having marched since leaving Germany and having suffered more than 26,000 casualties and soldiers felled by illnesses. Bülow had begun the war with 260,000 soldiers; in September he had 154,000. Moreover, his relations with Kluck were poor.

While Kluck was on the offensive near Paris, Bülow went on the defensive after the French attack on 6 September. On 7 September, Bülow ordered his right wing to retreat to the Petit Morin River after attacks by the French 5th army of Franchet d&#x27;Esperey, called &quot;Desperate Frankie&quot; as a compliment by the British. During the retreat, the French massacred 450 Germans who were attempting to surrender. With his right wing retreating, Bülow conversely ordered his left wing to attack with help from Hausen&#x27;s 3rd army. Hausen covered Bülow&#x27;s left flank and assaulted Foch&#x27;s 9th army in the Marshes of Saint–Gond near the city of Sézanne on 8 September. He had 82,000 men for the task. Hausen&#x27;s attack was a surprise, launched at night with no artillery preparation. His soldiers overran artillery positions &quot;with the bayonet.&quot; Hausen pushed Foch back . Hausen&#x27;s attack then bogged down with his soldiers exhausted and having suffered about 11,000 casualties.and also

=== The gap ===
Kluck&#x27;s turn to the northwest on 5 to 7 September to fight the 6th French army opened a gap on his left flank between his soldiers and those of Bülow of the 2nd German army. French air reconnaissance observed German forces moving north to face the Sixth Army and discovered the gap. The lack of coordination between von Kluck and Bülow caused the gap to widen even further.

The Allies exploited the gap in the German lines, sending the BEF northwest toward Kluck and the 5th Army northeast toward Bülow into the gap between the two German armies. The right wing of the French 5th Army attacked on 6 September and pinned the 2nd Army in the Battle of the Two Morins, named for the two rivers in the area, the Grand Morin and Petit Morin. The BEF advanced on , crossed the Petit Morin, captured bridges over the Marne, and established a bridgehead deep. Despite the promise by BEF commander French to Joffre that he would reenter the battle, the slow pace of the BEF&#x27;s advance enraged d&#x27;Espèrey, commander of the 5th Army, and other French commanders. On 6 September the British force moved so slowly it finished the day behind its objectives and suffered only seven men killed. The BEF, though outnumbering Germans in the gap ten to one, advanced only in three days. The 5th Army by 8 September crossed the Petit Morin, which forced Bülow to withdraw the right flank of the 2nd Army. The next day, the 5th Army crossed the Marne, and the German 2nd Army retreated further.

=== Hentsch&#x27;s tour ===
Moltke, at headquarters in Luxembourg, was out of communication with the German armies in France. Moltke preferred sending instructions to his armies by emissary rather than relying on his inadequate telephone and telegraph system. He sent his intelligence officer, Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hentsch, to visit the armies. Moltke&#x27;s instructions to Hentsch were verbal, not written, although apparently Moltke gave Hentsch, a mere lieutenant colonel, the authority to order the German armies to retreat if necessary for their survival. Hentsch&#x27;s mission, in the words of historian Herwig, was to become &quot;the most famous staff tour in military history.&quot;

Hentsch departed Luxembourg on 8 September by automobile and visited the 5th, 4th, and 3rd German Armies that afternoon. He reported back to Moltke that the situation of those armies was &quot;entirely favorable.&quot; At 6:45 that evening, he received a different message at 2nd Army headquarters in a meeting with Bülow and his staff. Hentsch was told that Bülow&#x27;s right flank (bordering the gap between Bülow&#x27;s and Kluck&#x27;s armies) was at the point of collapse. Bülow said that his army was &quot;cinders&quot; and &quot;in no condition&quot; to take the offensive against the French. He blamed Kluck for the crisis and said that Kluck should immediately break off the battle with the French 6th Army and close the gap between them. If not, the situation could become &quot;extremely serious&quot;.

Lt. Colonel Hentsch apparently responded to Field Marshall Bülow that, he, Hentsch had &quot;full power of authority&quot; to order Kluck to withdraw from his battle with the 6th French Army. During the meeting Bülow received the news that his army was buckling under pressure from the French. Bülow ordered a withdrawal of his forces and prognosticated &quot;incalculable consequences&quot;. Hentsch agreed with Bülow that when French and British forces crossed the Marne a general retreat by the Germans would be necessary. They agreed that Kluck must disengage and march to the Marne to link up with Bülow&#x27;s 2nd Army. If Kluck refused, Bülow would retreat north of the Marne.

The next morning, 9 September, with additional bad news from the front arriving, Bülow ordered another withdrawal without knowing what Kluck would do. Meanwhile, Hentsch proceeded onwards to Kluck&#x27;s 1st Army headquarters near the Ourcq River, arriving at 11:30 am after a journey through the devastation of war. He met with Kluck&#x27;s chief of staff, Hermann von Kuhl. Hentsch described the hazardous position of Bülow and said a general retreat was necessary, again asserting his authority in the name of Moltke. Kuhl &quot;was thunderstruck.&quot; The 1st Army was poised to assault the city of Paris and, hopefully, win the war, but Kuhl acceded to Hentsch and informed Kluck. With Bülow retreating, Kluck had no choice but to follow suit and he issued the order to retreat. His order said he was retreating &quot;at the behest&quot; of Moltke&#x27;s General Staff. On 11 September Moltke himself visited the 3rd, 4th, and 5th German armies and ordered a retreat of those armies in addition to the ongoing retreat of the 1st and 2nd armies) to the Aisne River to regroup for another offensive. The Germans were pursued by the French and British, although the pace of the exhausted Allied forces was slow and averaged only per day. The Germans ceased their retreat after , at a point north of the Aisne River where they dug in, preparing trenches. Joffre ordered allied troops to pursue, leading to the First Battle of the Aisne (see below).

&quot;Along a front of nearly 250 miles [400km], the German infantry faced about and began to retrace its steps over the ground won in bitter combat during the last two weeks.&quot; Many of the German soldiers and officers on the front lines of the conflict were bitter at what they regarded as a foolish order to retreat. Meyer said that the First Battle of the Marne &quot;has come down to us in history as the fight that saved Paris but in fact was settled by one side&#x27;s decision not to fight.&quot;

==Aftermath==
The German retreat from 9–13 September marked the end of the Schlieffen Plan. Moltke is said to have reported to the Kaiser: &quot;Your Majesty, we have lost the war.&quot;().

On 14 September, German military authorities informed Kaiser Wilhelm II that &quot;Moltke&#x27;s nerves are at an end and [he] is no longer able to conduct operations.&quot; The Kaiser forced Moltke to resign due to &quot;ill health.&quot; War Minister Erich von Falkenhayn was appointed to replace Moltke.

After the Battle of the Marne, the Germans retreated for up to and lost 11,717 prisoners, 30 field guns and 100 machine-guns to the French and 3,500 prisoners to the British before reaching the Aisne. The German retreat ended their hope of pushing the French beyond the Verdun–Marne–Paris line and winning a quick victory. Following the battle and the failures by both sides to turn the opponent&#x27;s northern flank during the Race to the Sea, the war of movement ended with the Germans and the allied powers facing each other across a stationary front line of trenches and defenses that remained nearly stable for four years.

===Analysis===
At the start of the war, both sides had plans that they hoped would result in victory after a short war. While the German invasion failed to defeat the French and British, after the battle the German army still occupied a large portion of northern France as well as most of Belgium. &quot;France had lost 64 per cent of its iron, 62 per cent of its steel, and 50 per cent of its coal. The failure of the French Plan 17 caused that situation.

Joffre, whose planning had led to the disastrous Battle of the Frontiers, was able to bring the allies to a tactical victory. He used interior lines to move troops from his right wing to the critical left wing and sacked generals. Due to the redistribution of French troops, the German 1st Army had 128 battalions facing 191 battalions of the French and BEF. The 2nd and 3rd German armies had 134 battalions facing 268 battalions of the French Fifth and new Ninth Army. It was his orders that prevented Castelnau from abandoning Nancy on 6 September or reinforcing that army when the pivotal battle was unfolding on the other side of the battlefield. He resisted counter-attacking until the time was right then put his full force behind it. D&#x27;Esperey should also receive credit as the author of the main stroke. As Joffre says in his memoirs: &quot;it was he who made the Battle of the Marne possible&quot;.

Historians characterise the Battle of the Marne as a partial success. However, John Terraine wrote that &quot;nowhere, and at no time, did it present the traditional aspect of victory&quot;, but nonetheless stated that the French and British stroke into the breach between the 1st and 2nd German Armies &quot;made the battle of the Marne the decisive battle of the war&quot;. Barbara W. Tuchman and Robert A. Doughty wrote that Joffre&#x27;s victory at the Marne was far from decisive, Tuchman calling it an &quot;…incomplete victory of the Marne…&quot; and Doughty [the] &quot;…opportunity for a decisive victory had slipped from his hands&quot;. Ian Sumner called it a flawed victory and that it proved impossible to deal the German armies &quot;a decisive blow&quot;. Tuchman wrote that Kluck explained the German failure at the Marne as

Richard Brooks in 2000 wrote that the significance of the battle centres on the fact that the failure of the Schlieffen Plan forced Germany to fight a two-front war against France and Russia—the scenario its strategists had long feared. Brooks claimed that, &quot;By frustrating the Schlieffen Plan, Joffre had won the decisive battle of the war, and perhaps of the century&quot;. The Battle of the Marne was also one of the first battles in which reconnaissance aircraft played a decisive role, by discovering weak points in the German lines, which the Entente armies were able to exploit.

===Casualties===
It is difficult to separate the casualties in the Battle of the Marne from the casualties in the other related battles of August and September 1914. Over two million men fought in the campaign leading to the First Battle of the Marne and although there are no exact official casualty counts for the battle, estimates for the actions of September along the Marne front for all armies are often given as 500,000 killed or wounded. French casualties totalled of whom an estimated 80,000 were killed. Tuchman gave French casualties for August as 206,515 from and Herwig gave French casualties for September as 213,445, also from for a total of just under 420,000 in the first two months of the war. According to Roger Chickering, German casualties for the 1914 campaigns on the Western Front were 500,000. British casualties were with No future battle on the Western Front would average so many casualties per day.

In 2009, Herwig re-estimated the casualties for the battle. He wrote that the French official history, , gave 213,445 French casualties in September and assumed that 40% occurred during the Battle of the Marne. Using the German , Herwig recorded that from the 1st Army had 13,254 casualties, the 2nd Army had 10,607 casualties, the 3rd Army had 14,987 casualties, the 4th Army had 9,433 casualties, the 5th Army had 19,434 casualties, the 6th Army had 21,200 casualties and the 7th Army had 10,164 casualties. Herwig estimated that the five German Armies from Verdun to Paris had 67,700 casualties during the battle and also assumed 85,000 casualties for the French. Herwig wrote that there were 1,701 British casualties (the British Official History noted that these losses were incurred from . Herwig estimated 300,000 casualties for all sides at the Marne but questioned whether isolating the battle was justified. Sergei Nelipovich, using the same type of sources for the Germans, estimated they casualties as 10,602 killed, 16,815 missing and 47,432 wounded. He also estimated the losses of the Entente forces at about 268,500 people, including 45,000 killed, 173,000 wounded and 50,500 prisoners. In 2010, Ian Sumner wrote that there were 12,733 British casualties, including 1,700 dead. Sumner cites the same overall casualty figure for the French for September as Herwig from , which includes the losses at the battle of the Aisne, as 213,445 but provides a further breakdown: 18,073 killed, 111,963 wounded and 83,409 missing. Most of the missing had been killed.

Some notable people died in the battle, such as Charles Péguy, who was killed while leading his platoon during an attack at the beginning of the battle.

===Subsequent operations===
====First Battle of the Aisne, 13–28 September====
On 10 September, Joffre ordered the French armies and the BEF to advance and for four days, the Armies on the left flank moved forward and gathered up German stragglers, wounded and equipment, opposed only by rearguards. On Joffre ordered outflanking manoeuvres by the armies on the left flank but the advance was too slow to catch the Germans, who ended their withdrawal on 14 September, on high ground on the north bank of the Aisne and began to dig in. Frontal attacks by the Ninth, Fifth, and Sixth Armies were repulsed from This led Joffre to transfer the Second Army west to the left flank of the Sixth Army, the first phase of Entente attempts to outflank the German armies in &quot;The Race to the Sea&quot;.

French troops had begun to move westwards on 2 September, using the undamaged railways behind the French front, which were able to move a corps to the left flank in On 17 September, the French Sixth Army attacked from Soissons to Noyon, at the westernmost point of the French flank, with the XIII and IV corps, which were supported by the 61st and 62nd divisions of the 6th Group of Reserve Divisions. After this, the fighting moved north to Lassigny and the French dug in around Nampcel.

The French Second Army completed a move from Lorraine and took over command of the left-hand corps of the Sixth Army, as indications appeared that German troops were also being moved from the eastern flank. The German IX Reserve Corps arrived from Belgium by 15 September and the next day joined the 1st Army for an attack to the south-west, with the IV Corps and the 4th and 7th cavalry divisions, against the attempted French envelopment. The attack was cancelled and the IX Reserve Corps was ordered to withdraw behind the right flank of the 1st Army. The 2nd and 9th Cavalry divisions were dispatched as reinforcements the next day but before the retirement began, the French attack reached Carlepont and Noyon, before being contained on 18 September. The German armies attacked from Verdun westwards to Reims and the Aisne at the Battle of Flirey  –  cut the main railway from Verdun to Paris and created the St. Mihiel salient, south of the Verdun fortress zone. The main German effort remained on the western flank, which was revealed to the French by intercepted wireless messages. By 28 September, the Aisne front had stabilised and the BEF began to withdraw on the night of with the first troops arriving in the Abbeville on the Somme on the night of The BEF prepared to commence operations in French Flanders and Flanders in Belgium, joining with the British forces that had been in Belgium since August.

====Race to the Sea====
From  –  the belligerents made reciprocal attempts to turn the northern flank of their opponent. Joffre ordered the French Second Army to move to the north of the French Sixth Army, by moving from eastern France from and Falkenhayn who had replaced Moltke on 14 September, ordered the German 6th Army to move from the German-French border to the northern flank on 17 September. By the next day, French attacks north of the Aisne led Falkenhayn to order the 6th Army to repulse the French and secure the flank. The French advance at the First Battle of Picardy met a German attack rather than an open flank and by the end of the Battle of Albert the Second Army had been reinforced to eight Corps but was still opposed by German forces at the Battle of Arras rather than advancing around the German northern flank. The German 6th Army had also found that on arrival in the north, it was forced to oppose the French attack rather than advance around the flank and that the secondary objective, to protect the northern flank of the German Armies in France, had become the main task. By 6 October, the French needed British reinforcements to withstand German attacks around Lille. The BEF had begun to move from the Aisne to Flanders on 5 October and reinforcements from England assembled on the left flank of the Tenth Army, which had been formed from the left flank units of the 2nd Army on 4 October.

The Entente Powers and the Germans attempted to take more ground after the &quot;open&quot; northern flank had disappeared. The Franco-British attacks towards Lille in October at the battles of La Bassée, Messines and Armentières (October–November) were followed up by attempts to advance between the BEF and the Belgian army by a new French Eighth Army. The moves of the 7th and then the 6th Army from Alsace and Lorraine had been intended to secure German lines of communication through Belgium, where the Belgian army had sortied several times, during the period between the Great Retreat and the Battle of the Marne; in August, British marines had landed at Dunkirk. In October, a new 4th Army was assembled from the III Reserve Corps, the siege artillery used against Antwerp, and four of the new reserve corps training in Germany. A German offensive began by 21 October but the 4th and 6th Armies were only able to take small amounts of ground, at great cost to both sides at the Battle of the Yser and further south in the First Battle of Ypres ( – ). Falkenhayn then attempted to achieve a limited goal of capturing Ypres and Mont Kemmel.

<doc id="171335" wikidata="Q157270" url="?curid=171335" title="Tillandsia">
<text>Tillandsia is a genus of around 649 species of evergreen, perennial flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae, native to the forests, mountains and deserts of the Neotropics, from northern Mexico and the southeastern United States to Mesoamerica and the Caribbean to central Argentina. Their leaves, more or less silvery in color, are covered with specialized cells (trichomes) capable of rapidly absorbing water that gathers on them.

They are also commonly known as air plants because they obtain nutrients and water from the air, not needing soil for nourishment. They have a natural propensity to cling to whatever surfaces are readily available: telephone wires, tree branches, bark, bare rocks, etc. Their light seeds and a silky parachute facilitate their spread. Most &quot;Tillandsia&quot; species are epiphytes – which translates to &#x27;upon a plant&#x27;. Some are aerophytes, which have a minimal root system and grow on shifting desert soil. Due to their epiphytic way of life, these plants will not grow in soil but live on the branches of trees, in deserts and on other substrates that will not be saturated with water for very long.

==Description==

&quot;Tillandsia&quot; are perennial herbaceous plants which exhibit a multitude of physiological and morphological differences making this a diverse genus. Having native habitats that vary from being epiphytic and saxicolous, species have certain adaptations, such as root systems designed to anchor to other plants or substrates, and modified trichomes for water and nutrient intake. Some of the species, like the majority of Bromeliaceae, grow as funnel bromeliads, with a compressed stem axis. The leaves are then close together in rosettes, and cover the lower areas of the leaves, forming a funnel for collecting water.

These leaf rosettes, a common physical characteristic in &quot;Tillandsia&quot; species, collect nutrients and water. The flowers typically involve bright, vibrant colors, with blooms or inflorescences produced on a stalk or several stalks. The flower&#x27;s color varies greatly; red, yellow, purple and pink flowers exist in this genus, and multicolored flowers are known. The bright colors attract pollinators. An air plant&#x27;s foliage may also change color when it blooms, also attracting pollinators. The hermaphrodite flowers are threefold with double perianth. The three free sepals are symmetrical and pointed. The seeds have a &quot;parachute&quot; similar to the dandelion.

Common pollinators of this genus include moths, hummingbirds and, more recently recognized, bats.

==Taxonomy==

The genus &quot;Tillandsia&quot; was named by Carl Linnaeus after the Swedish physician and botanist Elias Tillandz (originally Tillander) (1640–1693). Some common types of &quot;Tillandsia&quot; include ball moss (&quot;T. recurvata&quot;) and Spanish moss (&quot;T. usneoides&quot;). The genus contains around 650 species, where 635 are considered epiphytic. &quot;Tillandsia&quot; was traditionally divided into seven subgenera:
* &quot;Tillandsia&quot; subg. &quot;Allardtia&quot; 
* &quot;Tillandsia&quot; subg. &quot;Anoplophytum&quot; 
* &quot;Tillandsia&quot; subg. &quot;Diaphoranthema&quot; 
* &quot;Tillandsia&quot; subg. &quot;Phytarrhiza&quot; 
* &quot;Tillandsia&quot; subg. &quot;Pseudalcantarea&quot; , now raised to the genus &quot;Pseudalcantarea&quot;
* &quot;Tillandsia&quot; subg. &quot;Pseudo-catopsis&quot; 
* &quot;Tillandsia&quot; subg. &quot;Tillandsia&quot;

In a more recent (2016) classification, the following subgenera are recognized:
* &quot;Tillandsia&quot; subg. &quot;Aerobia&quot; 
* &quot;Tillandsia&quot; subg. &quot;Anoplophytum&quot; 
* &quot;Tillandsia&quot; subg. &quot;Diaphoranthema&quot; 
* &quot;Tillandsia&quot; subg. &quot;Phytarrhiza&quot; 
* &quot;Tillandsia&quot; subg. &quot;Pseudovriesea&quot; 
* &quot;Tillandsia&quot; subg. &quot;Tillandsia&quot;
* &quot;Tillandsia&quot; subg. &quot;Viridantha&quot; 

Four species are protected under CITES II:
* &quot;Tillandsia harrisii&quot; 
* &quot;Tillandsia kammii&quot;
* &quot;Tillandsia mauryana&quot;
* &quot;Tillandsia xerographica&quot;

==Range==

&quot;Tillandsia&quot; have naturally been established in diverse environments such as equatorial tropical rain forests, high elevation Andes mountains, rock dwelling (saxicolous) regions, and Louisiana swamps, such as Spanish moss (&quot;T. usneoides&quot;), a species that grows atop tree limbs. However, there are also species that are lithophytic (growing in or on rocks, though this can also stretch to living on roofs or even telephone wires). Its native range is Tropical &amp; Subtropical America.

Green-leaved species of &quot;Tillandsia&quot; generally live in cool-to-humid climates, in areas of terrestrial shade or the lower levels of a forest. In contrast, almost all gray-leaved species live in precipitation-poor areas with high humidity. They prefer the full sun and can therefore be found in the upper floors of the woods, on rocks or (rarely) on the ground. Many of the gray species are epiphytes. Some species are more or less xeromorphic.

==Ecology==
Species of &quot;Tillandsia&quot; photosynthesize through a process called CAM cycle, where they close their stomata during the day to prevent water loss and open them at night to fix carbon dioxide and release oxygen. This allows them to preserve water, necessary because they are epiphytes. They do not have a functional root system and instead absorb water in small amounts through their leaves via small structures called trichomes. Species of &quot;Tillandsia&quot; also absorb their nutrients from debris and dust in the air.

Any root system found on &quot;Tillandsia&quot; has grown to act as a fragile stabilizing scaffold to grip the surface they grow on. As soon as they have been soaked with water, the green assimilation tissue below the suction scales becomes visible again, the plant is therefore &quot;greened&quot;. Now the plant can absorb more light. When the sun dries the plants, they turn white. Thanks to this special survival trick, plants without roots can absorb fog droplets as well as rainwater and thus cover their water needs.

More than one-third of a tropical forest&#x27;s vascular plants are epiphytes which species of &quot;Tillandsia&quot; are part of. Their contribution to the environment&#x27;s carrying capacity allows for terrestrial fauna like earthworms to thrive in the treetops.

Temperature is not critical, the range being from . Frost hardiness depends on the species. &quot;T. usneoides&quot;, for example, can tolerate night-time frosts down to about . For most species, the ideal growth temperature is between , with a minimum of and a maximum of . Few are resistant to , but some, usually from higher elevation areas, are hardy enough to withstand light and brief freezes and live outdoors year round in areas with mild winters.

==Cultivation==
Tillandsias, like other bromeliads, can multiply through pollination and seed formation. Since Tillandsia are not self-fertile, the pollen must come from another plant of the same species. Tillandsia, depending on the species, may take months or years to flower. After flowering, the plant forms offsets and dies.

Generally, the thinner-leafed varieties grow in rainy areas and the thick-leafed varieties in areas more subject to drought. Most species absorb moisture and nutrients through the leaves from rain, dew, dust, decaying leaves and insect matter, aided by structures called trichomes. Air plants are growing rapidly in popularity as a low maintenance household plant. Due to their minimal root system and other adaptations, they generally do not require frequent watering, no more than four times a week, allowing the plant to completely dry before watering again.

The amount of light required depends on the species; overall, air plants with silver dusting and stiff foliage will require more sunlight than air plants with softer foliage. They generally need a strong light. In summer outside, however, they prefer the light shade of a tree at the hottest hours. Plants are commonly seen mounted, placed in a terrarium, or simply placed in seashells as decorative pieces. For so-called &quot;aerial&quot; species (the majority of the common species in culture except &quot;Tillandsia cyanea&quot;), that is to say those whose roots are transformed into crampons without any power of absorption, watering is done by the leaves in the form of frequent sprays, or brief soaking of the plant in a container full of water. Non-calcareous water is recommended.

 there are 34 cultivars of bromeliad registered by Bromeliad Society International, from &quot;T. Bacchus&quot; to &quot;T. Yabba&quot;.

<text>An optical mouse is a computer mouse which uses a light source, typically a light-emitting diode (LED), and a light detector, such as an array of photodiodes, to detect movement relative to a surface. Variations of the optical mouse have largely replaced the older mechanical mouse design, which uses moving parts to sense motion.

The earliest optical mice detected movement on pre-printed mousepad surfaces. Modern optical mice work on most opaque diffusely reflective surfaces like paper, but most of them do not work properly on specularly reflective surfaces like polished stone or transparent surfaces like glass. Optical mice that use dark field illumination can function reliably even on such surfaces.

== Mechanical mice ==

Though not commonly referred to as optical mice, nearly all mechanical mice tracked movement using LEDs and photodiodes to detect when beams of infrared light did and didn&#x27;t pass through holes in a pair of incremental rotary encoder wheels (one for left/right, another for forward/back), driven by a rubberized ball. Thus, the primary distinction of &quot;optical mice&quot; is not their use of optics, but their complete lack of moving parts to track mouse movement, instead employing an entirely solid-state system.

== Early optical mice ==
The first two optical mice, first demonstrated by two independent inventors in December 1980, had different basic designs:
One of these, invented by Steve Kirsch of MIT and Mouse Systems Corporation, used an infrared LED and a four-quadrant infrared sensor to detect grid lines printed with infrared absorbing ink on a special metallic surface. Predictive algorithms in the CPU of the mouse calculated the speed and direction over the grid. The other type, invented by Richard F. Lyon of Xerox, used a 16-pixel visible-light image sensor with integrated motion detection on the same ntype (5μm) MOS integrated circuit chip, and tracked the motion of light dots in a dark field of a printed paper or similar mouse pad. The Kirsch and Lyon mouse types had very different behaviors, as the Kirsch mouse used an x-y coordinate system embedded in the pad, and would not work correctly when the pad was rotated, while the Lyon mouse used the x-y coordinate system of the mouse body, as mechanical mice do.

The optical mouse ultimately sold with the Xerox STAR office computer used an inverted sensor chip packaging approach patented by Lisa M. Williams and Robert S. Cherry of the Xerox Microelectronics Center.

The Mouse Systems (Kirsch) design was commercialised and sold in PC compatible form by the company itself alongside variants rebranded for OEM use with Sun Microsystems workstations and by Data General.

== Modern optical mice ==

=== Optical sensor ===

Modern surface-independent optical mice work by using an optoelectronic sensor (essentially, a tiny low-resolution video camera) to take successive images of the surface on which the mouse operates. As computing power grew cheaper, it became possible to embed more powerful special-purpose image-processing chips in the mouse itself. This advance enabled the mouse to detect relative motion on a wide variety of surfaces, translating the movement of the mouse into the movement of the cursor and eliminating the need for a special mouse-pad. A surface-independent coherent light optical mouse design was patented by Stephen B. Jackson at Xerox in 1988.

Xerox&#x27;s inventions were never massively commercially exploited, however, and optical mice would remain elusive in the personal computer market until Microsoft released the IntelliMouse with IntelliEye and IntelliMouse Explorer in 1999. These mice used technology developed by Hewlett-Packard under their Agilent Technologies subsidiary (see below). These mice worked on almost any surface, and represented a welcome improvement over mechanical mice, which would pick up dirt, track capriciously, invite rough handling, and need to be taken apart and cleaned frequently. Other manufacturers soon followed Microsoft&#x27;s lead, including Apple for their Pro Mouse, using components manufactured by Agilent (once they spun off from HP), and over the next several years mechanical mice became obsolete.

The technology underlying the modern optical computer mouse is known as digital image correlation, a technology pioneered by the defense industry for tracking military targets. A simple binary-image version of digital image correlation was used in the 1980 Lyon optical mouse. Optical mice use image sensors to image naturally occurring texture in materials such as wood, cloth, mouse pads and Formica. These surfaces, when lit at a grazing angle by a light emitting diode, cast distinct shadows that resemble a hilly terrain lit at sunset. Images of these surfaces are captured in continuous succession and compared with each other to determine how far the mouse has moved.

=== Principle of operation ===
To understand how optical flow is used in optical mice, imagine two photographs of the same object except slightly offset from each other. Place both photographs on a light table to make them transparent, and slide one across the other until their images line up. The amount that the edges of one photograph overhang the other represents the offset between the images, and in the case of an optical computer mouse the distance it has moved.

Optical mice capture one thousand successive images or more per second. Depending on how fast the mouse is moving, each image will be offset from the previous one by a fraction of a pixel or as many as several pixels. Optical mice mathematically process these images using cross correlation to calculate how much each successive image is offset from the previous one. The output of the optical sensor is usually delta coordinates. Some optical ICs allow to get image data as well. Mice usually embeds some kind of Image Acquisition System and DSP processors for fast data processing.

An optical mouse might use an image sensor having an 18 × 18 pixel array of monochromatic pixels. Its sensor would normally share the same ASIC as that used for storing and processing the images. One refinement would be accelerating the correlation process by using information from previous motions, and another refinement would be preventing deadbands when moving slowly by adding interpolation or frame-skipping.

The development of the modern optical mouse at Hewlett-Packard Co. was supported by a succession of related projects during the 1990s at HP Laboratories. In 1992 William Holland was awarded US Patent 5,089,712 and John Ertel, William Holland, Kent Vincent, Rueiming Jamp, and Richard Baldwin were awarded US Patent 5,149,980 for measuring linear paper advance in a printer by correlating images of paper fibers. Ross R. Allen, David Beard, Mark T. Smith, and Barclay J. Tullis were awarded US Patents 5,578,813 (1996) and 5,644,139 (1997) for 2-dimensional optical navigational (i.e., position measurement) principles based on detecting and correlating microscopic, inherent features of the surface over which the navigation sensor travelled, and using position measurements of each end of a linear (document) image sensor to reconstruct an image of the document. This is the freehand scanning concept used in the HP CapShare 920 handheld scanner. By describing an optical means that explicitly overcame the limitations of wheels, balls, and rollers used in contemporary computer mice, the optical mouse was anticipated. These patents formed the basis for US Patent 5,729,008 (1998) awarded to Travis N. Blalock, Richard A. Baumgartner, Thomas Hornak, Mark T. Smith, and Barclay J. Tullis, where surface feature image sensing, image processing, and image correlation was realized by an integrated circuit to produce a position measurement. Improved precision of 2D optical navigation, needed for application of optical navigation to precise 2D measurement of media (paper) advance in HP DesignJet large format printers, was further refined in US Patent 6,195,475 awarded in 2001 to Raymond G. Beausoleil, Jr., and Ross R. Allen.

== Light source ==
=== LED mice ===
Optical mice often used light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for illumination when first popularized. The color of the optical mouse&#x27;s LEDs can vary, but red is most common, as red diodes are inexpensive and silicon photodetectors are very sensitive to red light. IR LEDs are also widely used. Other colors are sometimes used, such as the blue LED of the V-Mouse VM-101 illustrated at right.

=== Laser mice ===

A laser mouse uses an infrared laser diode instead of an LED to illuminate the surface beneath their sensor. As early as 1998, Sun Microsystems provided a laser mouse with their Sun SPARCstation servers and workstations.
However, laser mice did not enter the mainstream consumer market until 2004, following the development by a team at Agilent Laboratories, Palo Alto, led by Doug Baney of a laser-based mouse based on a 850 nm VCSEL that offered a 20X improvement in tracking performance. Tong Xie, Marshall T. Depue, and Douglas M. Baney were awarded US patents 7,116,427 and 7,321,359 for their work on low power consumption broad navigability VCSEL-based consumer mice. Paul Machin at Logitech, in partnership with Agilent Technologies introduced the new technology as the &quot;MX 1000&quot; laser mouse. This mouse uses a small infrared laser (VCSEL) instead of an LED and significantly increased the resolution of the image taken by the mouse. The laser illumination enabled superior surface tracking compared to LED-illuminated optical mice.

In 2008, Avago Technologies introduced laser navigation sensors whose emitter was integrated into the IC using VCSEL technology.

In August 2009, Logitech introduced mice with two lasers, to track on glass and glossy surfaces better; they dubbed them a &quot;Darkfield&quot; laser sensor.

== Power ==
Manufacturers often engineer their optical mice—especially battery-powered wireless models—to save power when possible. To do this, the mouse dims or blinks the laser or LED when in standby mode (each mouse has a different standby time). A typical implementation (by Logitech) has four power states, where the sensor is pulsed at different rates per second:

* 11500: full on, for accurate response while moving, illumination appears bright.
* 1100: fallback active condition while not moving, illumination appears dull.
* 110: standby
* 12: sleep state

Movement can be detected in any of these states; some mice turn the sensor fully off in the sleep state, requiring a button click to wake.

Optical mice utilizing infrared elements (LEDs or lasers) offer substantial increases in battery life over visible spectrum illumination. Some mice, such as the Logitech V450 848 nm laser mouse, are capable of functioning on two AA batteries for a full year, due to the low power requirements of the infrared laser.

Mice designed for use where low latency and high responsiveness are important, such as in playing video games, may omit power-saving features and require a wired connection to improve performance. Examples of mice which sacrifice power-saving in favor of performance are the Logitech G5 and the Razer Copperhead.

== Optical versus mechanical mice ==
Unlike mechanical mice, whose tracking mechanisms can become clogged with lint, optical mice have no moving parts (besides buttons and scroll wheels); therefore, they do not require maintenance other than removing debris that might collect under the light emitter. However, they generally cannot track on glossy and transparent surfaces, including some mouse-pads, causing the cursor to drift unpredictably during operation. Mice with less image-processing power also have problems tracking fast movement, whereas some high-quality mice can track faster than 2 m/s.

Some models of laser mouse can track on glossy and transparent surfaces, and have a much higher sensitivity.

 mechanical mice had lower average power requirements than their optical counterparts; the power used by mice is relatively small, and only an important consideration when the power is derived from batteries, with their limited capacity.

Optical models outperform mechanical mice on uneven, slick, soft, sticky, or loose surfaces, and generally in mobile situations lacking mouse pads. Because optical mice render movement based on an image which the LED (or infrared diode) illuminates, use with multicolored mouse pads may result in unreliable performance; however, laser mice do not suffer these problems and will track on such surfaces.

<text>Albany Leon &quot;Barney&quot; Bigard (March 3, 1906 – June 27, 1980) was an American jazz clarinetist known for his 15-year tenure with Duke Ellington. He also played tenor saxophone.

==Biography==
Bigard was born in New Orleans to Creole parents, Alexander and Emanuella Bigard. He had two brothers, Alexander Jr. and Sidney. His uncle, Emile Bigard, was a jazz violinist. He attended local schools and studied music and clarinet with Lorenzo Tio.

In the early 1920s, he moved to Chicago, where he worked with King Oliver and others. During this period, much of his recording, including with clarinetist Johnny Dodds, was on tenor saxophone, which he played often with great lyricism, as on Oliver&#x27;s &quot;Someday Sweetheart&quot;.

In December 1927, Bigard joined Duke Ellington&#x27;s orchestra in New York. He played with Ellington until 1942. They played primarily at the Cotton Club until 1931, then toured almost nonstop for over a decade. With Ellington, he was the featured clarinet soloist, while also doing section work on tenor saxophone.

After leaving Ellington&#x27;s orchestra, Bigard moved to Los Angeles. He did soundtrack work for Hollywood film studios and had an onscreen featured role with an all-star band led by Louis Armstrong in the film &quot;New Orleans&quot; (1947). He began working with trombonist Kid Ory&#x27;s group during the late 1940s. He later worked with Armstrong&#x27;s touring band, the All Stars, and others. 

In 1951 Bigard appeared in &quot;The Strip&quot; with Armstrong, Jack Teagarden, and Earl &quot;Fatha&quot; Hines (all playing themselves).
He again appeared and played in the movie &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot; (1958), with Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, Pearl Bailey and Eartha Kitt.

Bigard wrote an autobiography entitled &quot;With Louis and The Duke&quot;. He is credited as composer or co-composer on several numbers, including the Ellington standard &quot;Mood Indigo&quot;.

==Bigard and his Jazzopaters==
The first version of the song &quot;Caravan&quot; (composed by Juan Tizol and later rearranged by Duke Ellington) was recorded in Hollywood, on December 18, 1936, and performed as an instrumental by Barney Bigard and His Jazzopaters. Two takes were recorded and were issued, although L-0373-2 is by far the more commonly found take. As of 2024 &quot;Caravan&quot; is the most covered song in history with over 500 versions published.

The band members were Cootie Williams (trumpet), Juan Tizol (trombone), Barney Bigard (clarinet), Harry Carney (baritone sax), Duke Ellington (piano), Billy Taylor (bass), and Sonny Greer (drums). All were members of the Duke Ellington Orchestra, which was often drawn upon to record small-group sides. Although Ellington was present at the recording date, the session leader was Bigard.

In keeping with Ellington&#x27;s formation of small groups featuring his primary soloists, Bigard continued to be featured under his own name on Variety and subsequently Vocalion Records and OKeh through 1940. When Ellington signed with Victor in 1940, Bigard (and other Ellingtonians) recorded for Bluebird under his own name. He sat in with the Glenn Miller Orchestra for some of their biggest hits, such as &quot;Moonlight Serenade&quot;, &quot;Little Brown Jug&quot;, and &quot;Tuxedo Junction&quot;. Bigard was also a member of Louis Armstrong&#x27;s All Stars before and after Edmond Hall joined. Bigard can be seen with the All Stars in the movie &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot; (1954).

Bigard performed with Louis Armstrong and his All Stars with Velma Middleton singing vocals for the ninth Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles. The concert was produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. on June 7, 1953. Also featured that day were Roy Brown and his Orchestra, Don Tosti and His Mexican Jazzmen, Earl Bostic, Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole, and Shorty Rogers and his Orchestra.

After World War II, Bigard recorded under his own name for, among others, Signature Records, Rex Records, Black &amp; White Records, and Keynote Records in 1944–45. He recorded an album for Liberty in 1957 and an album for French Vogue Records as &quot;Barney Bigard-Claude Luter Quintet&quot; in 1966. In 1968, Delmark Records had him come to Chicago and recorded &quot;Bucket&#x27;s Got A Hole In It&quot; with Art Hodes.

==Death==
Bigard died on June 27, 1980, aged 74, in Culver City, California and was interred in that city&#x27;s Holy Cross Cemetery.

<doc id="171353" wikidata="Q437962" url="?curid=171353" title="Wolfe Tone">
<text>Theobald Wolfe Tone, posthumously known as Wolfe Tone (; 20 June 176319 November 1798), was a revolutionary exponent of Irish independence and is an iconic figure in Irish republicanism. Convinced that so long as his fellow Protestants feared to make common cause with the Catholic majority, the British Crown would continue to govern Ireland in the interest of England and of its client aristocracy, in 1791 Tone helped form the Society of United Irishmen. Although received in the company of a Catholic delegation by the King and his ministers in London, Tone, with other United Irish leaders, despaired of constitutional reform. Fuelled by the popular grievances of rents, tithes and taxes, and driven by martial-law repression, the society developed as an insurrectionary movement. When, in the early summer of 1798, it broke into open rebellion, Tone was in exile soliciting assistance from the French Republic. In October 1798, on his second attempt to land in Ireland with French troops and supplies, he was taken prisoner. Sentenced to be hanged, he died from a reportedly self-inflicted wound.

Since the mid-nineteenth century, his name has been invoked, and his legacy disputed, by different factions of Irish Republicanism. These have held annual, but separate, commemorations at his graveside in Bodenstown, County Kildare.

==Early life==

Tone was born on 20 June 1763. His father, Peter Tone, was a prosperous coach-maker who had a farm near Sallins, County Kildare and adhered to the established Anglican church. Although records are absent, he is said to have been the descendant, from the 17th century, of a Cromwellian soldier (&quot;the first Tone to settle in Ireland&quot;) and of French Huguenot refugees. His mother, Margaret Lamport, the daughter of a sea captain in the West India trade, was a Catholic who according to Tone&#x27;s early biographer, R.R. Madden, converted to her husband&#x27;s church only when Tone was already eight years old. Tone, nonetheless, was baptised a Protestant, with the name Theobald Wolfe in honour of his godfather, Theobald Wolfe of Blackhall, County Kildare, a first cousin of Arthur Wolfe, 1st Viscount Kilwarden.

In 1783, Tone found work as a tutor to Anthony and Robert, younger half-brothers of Richard Martin, a Patriot member of the Irish Parliament for Jamestown, County Leitrim. Tone fell in love with Martin&#x27;s well-connected wife, Elizabeth Vesey. While Tone later wrote that it came to nothing, a Martin biographer suspects that he was the father of the Martins&#x27; first child Laetitia born in 1785.

Tone studied law at Trinity College Dublin, where Kilwarden remembered him as a &quot;sparkling conversationalist and rising talent&quot;. Tone was active in the College Historical Society, which had a record for honing oratory skills and preparing members for a life in politics. He was made a scholar in 1784 and graduated BA in February 1786. In 1788, after training in London&#x27;s Middle Temple, he qualified in Dublin&#x27;s King&#x27;s Inns, as a barrister, a profession with which he was already disenchanted.

As a student, he had eloped with Martha (Matilda) Witherington, daughter of William and Catherine Witherington (née Fanning) of Dublin. When they married, Tone was 22, and Matilda was about 16. With the arrival of their first daughter, and his father&#x27;s bankruptcy denying him an inheritance, he cast about for new employment. To British Prime Minister William Pitt, in 1788 he submitted a plan for a Roman-style military colony on Captain Cook&#x27;s newly reported Sandwich Islands. When this elicited no response, he sought enlistment as a soldier in the East India Company but applied too late in the year to be shipped to south Asia. Styling himself an &quot;independent Irish Whig&quot;, he followed the example of a number of college friends and began reporting on the proceedings of the Irish Parliament and the conduct of the London-appointed Dublin Castle executive.

== United Irishman ==

=== Invitation to Belfast ===
In July 1790 in the visitors&#x27; gallery in the Irish House of Commons, Tone met Thomas Russell, a disillusioned East India Company veteran. He found Russell equally critical of the proceedings in the chamber below. Henry Grattan&#x27;s reform-minded Patriots were floundering in their efforts to build upon the legislative independence from England (the &quot;Constitution of 1782&quot;) that the Volunteer militia movement had helped secure. Tone later described the encounter with Russell as &quot;one of the most fortunate&quot; in his life.

With Russell providing the introductions, in October 1791 Tone addressed a small reform club in Belfast. Members were Protestant &quot;Dissenters&quot; from the established church, Presbyterians who, notwithstanding sometimes substantial commercial property, had no elected representation. Belfast was a parliamentary borough in the &quot;pocket&quot; of the town&#x27;s proprietor, the Marquess of Donegall. They had coalesced around the proposal of one of their number, now resident in Dublin, William Drennan, for &quot;a benevolent conspiracy, a plot for the people&quot; dedicated to &quot;the Rights of Man&quot; and to &quot;Real Independence&quot; for Ireland. (Tone&#x27;s diary records Thomas Paine&#x27;s &quot;Rights of Man&quot; as the &quot;Koran of Belfast&quot;).

=== &quot;An Argument on behalf of the Catholics of Ireland&quot; ===
The Belfast club had invited Tone as the author of &quot;An Argument on behalf of the Catholics of Ireland.&quot; It was a tract which they had helped publish and which had appeared, in their honour, as the work of &quot;a Northern Whig&quot;. With an eventual print-run of 16,000, in Ireland only the &quot;Rights of Man&quot; surpassed it in circulation.

The &quot;Argument&quot; embraced what had been the most advanced Volunteer position: that the key to constitutional reform was Catholic emancipation. So long as &quot;illiberal&quot;, &quot;bigoted&quot; and &quot;blind&quot; Irish Protestants indulged their fears of &quot;Popery&quot; and of Catholic repossession, the &quot;boobies and blockheads&quot; in Parliament and Dublin Castle would prevail. The choice was stark: either &quot;Reform, the Catholics, justice and liberty&quot; or &quot;an unconditional submission to the present, and every future administration&quot;.

Tone was himself suspicious of the Catholic priests (regretting that the Irish people had been &quot;bound&quot; to them by persecution) and hostile to what he saw as &quot;Papal tyranny&quot; (In 1798, he was to applaud Napoleon&#x27;s deposition and imprisonment of Pope Pius VI). But the &quot;Argument&quot; presents the French Revolution as evidence that a Catholic people need not endure clericalism: in the French National Assembly, as in the American Congress, &quot;Catholic and Protestant sit equally&quot;. It also recalls the Patriot Parliament summoned by James II in 1689. When Irish Catholics had a clearer title to what had been forfeit not ninety but forty years before (in the Cromwellian Settlement), they did not use the opportunity to pursue the wholesale return of their lost estates. As for the existing Irish Parliament &quot;where no Catholic can by law appear&quot;, it was the clearest proof that &quot;Protestantism is no guard against corruption&quot;.

=== First resolutions ===
Calling themselves, at his suggestion, the Society of the United Irishmen, and approving Tone&#x27;s draft resolutions, his hosts declared that &quot;we have no national government — we are ruled by Englishmen, and the servants of Englishmen&quot;. The sole constitutional remedy was &quot;an equal representation of all the people in parliament&quot;—&quot;a complete and radical reform&quot;. Others were urged to follow their example: to &quot;form similar Societies in every quarter of the kingdom for the promotion of Constitutional knowledge, the abolition of bigotry in religion and policies, and the equal distribution of the Rights of Man through all Sects and Denominations of Irishmen&quot;.

Summarised by James Napper Tandy as &quot;all Irishmen citizens, all citizens Irishmen&quot;, the same resolutions were carried three weeks later at a meeting in Dublin. Present were John Keogh, John Sweetman and other leading members of the city&#x27;s Catholic Committee.

=== Secretary to the Catholic Committee ===
In the new year, 1792, the Catholic Committee appointed Tone as an assistant secretary. He replaced Richard Burke, the son of Edmund Burke to whose critical &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot;, Paine&#x27;s &quot;Rights of Man&quot; had been a response.

In December 1792, with the support and participation of United Irishmen, Tone helped the Committee in Dublin stage a national Catholic Convention. Elected on a broad, head-of-household, franchise, the &quot;Back Lane Parliament&quot; was seen to challenge the legitimacy of the Irish Lords and Commons. The impression was confirmed when the convention decided to make its appeal directly to London where the government, in advance of war with revolutionary France, had signalled a willingness to solicit Catholic opinion. In January 1793, Tone was included in the Convention delegation that, after being hosted by Presbyterian supporters in Belfast, was received by George III at Windsor. It was an audience with which, at the time, Tone believed he had &quot;every reason to be content&quot;.

Through its appointed Dublin Castle executive, the British government pressed the Irish Parliament to match Westminster&#x27;s 1791 Catholic Relief Act. This lifted the sacramental bar to the legal profession, to military commissions and, in the limited number of constituencies not in the &quot;pockets&quot; of either landed grandees or the government, to the property franchise, but not yet to Parliament itself or to senior Crown offices. But there was a substantial price to be paid for the passage, in April 1793, of similar legislation in Ireland.

In the wake of the 1793 Relief Act, the Catholic Committee voted Tone a sum of £1,500 with a gold medal, subscribed to a statue of the King and, as agreed in London, voted to dissolve. The government then passed legislation raising militia regiments by a compulsory ballot system and outlawing extra-parliamentary conventions and independent militia. United Irishmen at the time were seeking to revive the Volunteer movement on the model of the French National Guard.

=== Separatist and conspirator ===
In May 1794, evidence laid against Tone helped the government justify its proscription of the Society. In July 1793, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, John FitzGibbon, Earl of Clare, had seized upon Tone&#x27;s suggestion in a letter to Russell that independence &quot;would be the regeneration to this country&quot;, to denounce all United Irishmen as committed separatists. Tone protested, but only by way of endorsing a connection to England where it did not involve the &quot;gross corruption in the legislature&quot; and the &quot;sacrifice of [Ireland’s] interests to England&quot;. In April 1794, he was found to have been meeting in the prison cell of Archibald Hamilton Rowan (a fellow United man serving time for seditious libel) with William Jackson. An Anglican clergyman radicalised by his experience of revolutionary Paris, Jackson came to Ireland to ascertain to the potential support for a French invasion. Tone had drawn up a memorandum for Jackson testifying to the readiness of the country to rise, the Presbyterians being &quot;steady republicans, devoted to liberty&quot; and the Catholics &quot;ready for any change because no change can make them worse&quot;.

An attorney named Cockayne, to whom Jackson had disclosed his mission, betrayed the memorandum to the government. In April 1794 Jackson was arrested on a charge of treason and dramatically committed suicide during his trial. Rowan, and two other parties to the conspiracy, Napper Tandy and James Reynolds, managed to flee the country. None of the incriminating papers seized were in Tone&#x27;s handwriting. Also, while entertaining hopes of serving Francis Rawdon, Lord Moira, as a private secretary, Tone had not attended meetings of the Dublin Society of United Irishmen since May 1793. (Rawdon, who had hosted the Catholic delegation in London, had been a rumoured replacement for the Earl of Westmorland as Viceroy in Dublin).

Tone remained in Ireland until after the trial of Jackson but was advised by Kilwarden that to avoid prosecution he should leave. In an agreement brokered by a former Trinity friend, Marcus Beresford, he was permitted to remove himself to the United States in return for giving an account of his role in the Jackson affair, albeit without breaking confidences or naming names.

Before leaving, in June 1795 Tone and his family travelled to Belfast. At the summit of Cavehill overlooking the town, Tone with Thomas Russell and three other members of the movement&#x27;s Ulster executive, Samuel Neilson, Henry Joy McCracken and Robert Simms, took the celebrated pledge &quot;never to desist in our efforts until we had subverted the authority of England over our country, and asserted our independence&quot;.

Responding to the growing repression, the northern executive had endorsed a &quot;new system of organisation&quot;. Local societies were to split so as to remain within a range of 7 to 35 members, and through baronial and county delegate committees, build toward a provincial, and, ultimately, a national, directory. Beginning with an obligation of each society to drill a company, and of three companies to form a battalion, this structure was in turn adapted to military preparation.

In this form, the society replicated rapidly across Ulster and, eventually, from Dublin out into the midlands and the south. As it did so, William Drennan&#x27;s “test” or pledge, calling for &quot;a union of power among Irishmen of every religious persuasion&quot;, was administered to artisans, journeymen and shopkeepers, many of whom had maintained their own Jacobin clubs, and to tenant farmers and their market-town allies who had organised against the Anglican gentry in secret fraternities. These were the &quot;numerous and respectable class of the community, the men of no property&quot; that Tone, despairing of his own creed and class, believed would ultimately carry the struggle.

== Revolutionary exile ==

=== Impressions of America ===
In August 1795, Tone took up residence in Philadelphia, the then-capital of the United States, where he found himself in the company of Rowan, Tandy, and Reynolds. Tone was instantly disillusioned. He found the Americans to be a &quot;churlish, unsociable race totally absorbed in making money&quot;, and was appalled by the reactionary anti-French sentiment of George Washington and his Federalist Party allies—a &quot;mercantile peerage&quot;—entrenched in the U.S. Senate. His sympathies were with the Democratic-Republican opposition that was beginning to form around Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.

Tone bought a farm near Princeton, New Jersey, an area made desirable by the attraction of &quot;a college and some good society&quot;, and thought to spend the approaching winter writing a history of the Catholic Committee. But letters received from John Keogh and Thomas Russell persuaded him to resume his revolutionary mission. With the support of the French minister in Philadelphia, Pierre Adet, on New Year&#x27;s Day 1796, he sailed for France.

=== Lobbies the French Directory ===
When in February he arrived in Paris, Tone found that, forwarded by Adet, his &quot;Memorials on the State of Ireland&quot; had already come to the attention of Lazare Carnot, one of five members of the then governing Directory. Tone was not aware of it at the time, but his picture of Ireland as primed for liberation was being reinforced by the still more enthusiastic reports from two new United militants, formerly in the ranks of Grattan parliamentary opposition, Lord Edward Fitzgerald and Arthur O&#x27;Connor.

By May, General Henri Clarke, the Irish-descendant head of the War Ministry&#x27;s &quot;Bureau Topographique&quot;, had drafted an invasion plan. In June, Carnot offered General Lazare Hoche command of an expedition that would secure “the safety of France for centuries to come&quot;. According to a French sympathiser, Tone&#x27;s enthusiasm for the venture was qualified by &quot;the express condition that the French should come to Ireland as allies, and should act under direction of the new government, as Rochambeau had done in America&quot;. Tone had already recorded his resolve never to be an &quot;accessory to subjecting my country to the control of France merely to get rid of England&quot;.

=== Hoche&#x27;s expedition to Ireland ===

On 15 December 1796, an expedition under Hoche, consisting of forty-three sail and carrying about 14,450 men with a large supply of war material for distribution in Ireland, sailed from Brest. Accompanied by Tone, commissioned as a &quot;&quot;chef de brigade&quot; in the service of the republic&quot;, it arrived off the coast of Ireland at Bantry Bay on 22 December 1796. Unremitting storms prevented a landing. Tone remarked that &quot;England [...] had its luckiest escape since the Armada&quot;. The fleet returned home and the army intended to spearhead the invasion of Ireland was split up and sent, along with a growing Irish Legion, to fight in other theatres of the French Revolutionary Wars.

Tone served for some months in the French army under Hoche, who had become the French Republic&#x27;s minister of war after his victory against the Austrians at the Battle of Neuwied on the Rhine in April 1797. In June 1797 Tone took part in preparations for a military expedition to Ireland from the Batavian Republic, the French-client successor state to the United Netherlands. However, the Batavian fleet under Vice-Admiral Jan de Winter was delayed in the harbour of Texel island that summer by unfavourable easterly winds and from mid-August by a British North-Sea fleet blockade. After Tone and other troops assembled had disembarked, it eventually put to sea in the hope of reaching the French naval base at Brest, only to be destroyed by Admiral Adam Duncan in the Battle of Camperdown on October 11, 1797. Hoche who, straying from Tone&#x27;s plans for Ireland, had begun to consider descent upon Scotland (where following the Irish example, radicals had formed the United Scotsmen), had died of tuberculosis on September 19. It was a loss Tone considered &quot;irreparable to the Irish cause&quot;.

=== Rivalries in Paris ===
Back in Paris, Tone recognised the rising star of Napoleon Bonaparte, but was unable to deflect the conqueror of Italy from his grander vision of still greater conquests in the East. In May 1798, with the men and materiel that might have possible another descent upon Ireland, Bonaparte sailed for Egypt. Bonaparte was later to claim that he might have been persuaded to sail for Ireland had the United Irish agents in Paris not constantly quarrelled among themselves.

After his return from Bantry, Tone had been joined by a co-conspirator in the Jackson affair, Edward Lewines accredited by the Leinster directory in Dublin. With Lewines heavily reliant on Tone for introductions, Tone was unchallenged as a representative of the Irish cause until, returning again to Paris from Texel, he found Tandy recently arrived from the United States.

Willing to exaggerate his military experience, his standing in Ireland, and the readiness of the country to rise, Tandy appeared the more imposing figure. He won over the radical luminaries in exile, Thomas Paine and the Scottish republican and escaped convict, Thomas Muir, but also—and critically—new arrivals from Ulster. These included James Coigly, Arthur McMahon, John Tennent and Bartholomew Teeling. Witness to General Lake&#x27;s &quot;dragooning of Ulster&quot;, they insisted that the movement in Ireland had to act, if necessary in advance of the French, or face the break-up of its entire system. It was an outlook (further encouraged by Coigly&#x27;s reports of radical societies ready to act in England and Scotland) more in keeping with the policy of the French. After Bantry Bay, they were waiting for reports of a rising in Ireland before again hazarding their own troops.

== 1798 ==

=== Bompart&#x27;s expedition to Ireland and arrest ===
When, in the spring of 1798, the Leinster directory bent under the pressure of the same martial-law measures applied to the south and called for a general insurrection on May 23, Tone was in the dark. The most that he and the other Irish lobbyists had won from the Directory was the undertaking that once the news was received that the country had risen, they would seek to break through to the more open Atlantic coast of Ireland and land smaller numbers of men and supplies. In late August 1798, General Jean Humbert succeeded in landing with a force of approximately 1,000 near Killala, County Mayo. He advanced into the country but, once it was clear that the main rebel conjunctions in Ulster and Leinster had already been decisively defeated, he surrendered. Among the Irish prisoners taken were Teeling and Tone&#x27;s brother Matthew. They were both court-martialled and hanged.

A second still smaller expedition, accompanied by Tandy, touched land in Donegal on 16 September but departed on the news of Humbert&#x27;s defeat. Six days before, Tone had embarked with Admiral Jean-Baptiste-François Bompart and General Jean Hardy in command of a force of about 3,000 men. They encountered a British squadron at Buncrana on Lough Swilly on 12 October 1798. Tone, on the ship &quot;Hoche&quot;, refused Bompart&#x27;s offer of escape in a frigate. In the ensuing battle of Tory Island he commanded one of the ship&#x27;s batteries until, isolated and crippled after several hours of bombardment, the ship struck and Bompart surrendered. Two weeks later, held with his fellow French officers in the privy-quarters of Lord Cavan&#x27;s in Letterkenny, he was recognised by Sir George Hill, a Member of Parliament (and a leading member of the new Orange Order) and was arrested.

=== Trial and death ===
At his court-martial in Dublin on 8 November 1798, Tone defended his desire to separate Ireland from Great Britain “in fair and open war&quot; and his honour.

His one &quot;regret&quot; was the &quot;very great atrocities&quot; committed in the course of the summer rebellion, &quot;on both sides&quot;. For &quot;a fair and open war&quot; he had been prepared; but if that had &quot;degenerated into a system of assassination, massacre, and plunder&quot; he did &quot;most sincerely lament it&quot;.

His one request was that, as a ranking French officer, he might &quot;die the death of a soldier&quot; and be shot. The request was denied: found guilty of treason he was condemned to hang on the 12th. On what was to be the morning of his execution he was found with a wound to his throat, the result—although later a subject of some speculation—of an apparent attempt to take his own life. The story goes that the doctor who bound the wound told Tone that if he talked it would re-open and he would bleed to death, to which Tone replied: &quot;I can yet find words to thank you sir; it is the most welcome news you could give me. What should I wish to live for?&quot;.

Theobald Wolfe Tone died on 19 November 1798 at the age of 35 in the Provost Prison of the Royal Barracks, Dublin, not far from where he was born. He is buried in the family plot in Bodenstown, County Kildare, near his birthplace at Sallins, and his grave is in the care of the National Graves Association.

==Political vision==
=== Equality and representation ===
Later generations of Irish republicans have broadly been content with Tone&#x27;s own succinct summary of his purpose:

To subvert the tyranny of our execrable government, to break the connection with England (the never failing source of our political evils) and to assert the independence of my country—these were my objects. To unite the whole people of Ireland: to abolish the memory of all past dissension; and to substitute the common name of Irishmen in place of the denomination of Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter—these were my means.

In the autobiography he began to compose in France, Tone claimed that already in 1790 he had advanced &quot;the question of separation with scarcely any reserve&quot;. While not yet rejecting a personal union of crowns, in his tract &quot;The Spanish War&quot; (1790) he had disputed Ireland&#x27;s obligation uphold England in a colonial dispute with Spain and had called for a separate Irish navy.

Beginning with James Connolly, who maintained that Tone would have been &quot;a rebel even had he been an Englishman&quot;, left-wing republicans have suggested that for Tone, Irish independence was part of a broader radical vision. Typically reference is made to his diary entry for 11 March 1796: &quot;If the men of property will not support us, they must fall; we can support ourselves by the aid of that numerous and respectable class of the community, &quot;the men of no property&quot;.&quot; He is also recorded as telling the French that a revolution in Ireland &quot;was not to be made for the people of property&quot;.&quot;&quot;

While acknowledging the need for their support, it is not clear that Tone wished those &quot;of no property&quot; to take the initiative. Russell&#x27;s diary records a despondent conversation in January 1794 in which Tone remarked: there is &quot;nothing to be expected from this country except from the &quot;sans culottes&quot;, who are too ignorant for any thinking man to wish to see in power&quot;.

Tone did not abandon Whig constitutionalism, so long as the talk was of reform. In 1792, in an address to Volunteers, he disclaimed any intention of invading the &quot;just prerogatives of our monarch&quot; or the &quot;constitutional powers of the peers of the realm&quot;.&quot;&quot; As a condition of Catholic emancipation he had even offered that the greater part of a non-confessional Irish electorate be disenfranchised. Anticipating the terms under which Catholics were eventually admitted to a United Kingdom parliament in 1829, his &quot;Argument&quot; proposed raising the property (or tenure equivalent) threshold for the vote fivefold to match the English ten-pound freehold. As Daniel O&#x27;Connell was to do in 1829, Tone suggested that raising the qualification would allow the &quot;sound and respectable part of the Catholic community&quot; to recover its proper place and weight in society.More than this, it would also purge the Protestant interest of &quot;the gross and feculent mass&quot; of forty-shilling freeholders. As these could be driven to the polls by their landlords, &quot;as much their property as the sheep or the bullocks which they brand with their names&quot;, Wolfe may have reasoned that was lost in democratic principle was gained in the practical check on the ability of the squirearchy to swamp county-seat elections.

Even when set on an insurrectionary path, Tone expressed no wish to unsettle property in Ireland. As &quot;petty despots&quot;, unable to see beyond &quot;their rent rolls, their places, their patronage and their pensions&quot;,&quot;&quot; he suggested to General Clarke that the gentry ran the risk of a &quot;general massacre and a distribution of their entire property&quot;.&#x27; This he would hope to avoid, for not only would he abhor the bloodshed, but he believed that the prospect of retaining property in Ireland might blunt resistance. He recommended that the French on landing, and a provisional convention that would then be called, offer not only resident landowners but also to the absentee lords in England, security for their estates.&#x27; General Hoche could otherwise reckon &quot;on all the opposition&quot; that men of property could give him.&quot;&quot;

Tone approved the advance of peasant proprietorship under the French Republic, and may broadly have shared Jefferson&#x27;s faith in the republican virtues of independent smallholders. But he insisted that the United society he had known in Ireland had never &quot;entertained&quot; ideas of &quot;a distribution of property and an agrarian law&quot;, and he advanced no such scheme himself. He ventured no more than relief from that &quot;pest on agriculture&quot;, the tithes levied on top of rents by the landlord&#x27;s established church.&quot;&quot;

In general, Tone appears to have followed the resolve of the Dublin Society of United Irishmen to &quot;attend those things in which we all agree, [and] to exclude those in which we differ&quot;, and consequently to avoid directly engaging questions of economic inequality. From France, he wrote tracts addressed to the weavers of the Liberties in Dublin. These expressed sympathy for their hardships. but James Hope, the self-educated weaver who organised in the Liberties, did not place Tone alongside his friend Russell as one of those “few” United Irish leaders who &quot;perfectly&quot; understood the real causes of social disorder: &quot;the conditions of the labouring class&quot;.

As was the case with the Dublin society, Tone proposed an independent and representative government as a sufficient promise of redress regardless of the grievance. For Tone, the promise appears to have been not, scarcely conceptualised, agrarian or labour reform, but the promotion of education (Tone imagined the polymath Whitley Stokes as the head of a national system) and a vigorous mercantile policy in defence of Irish trade and industry.&quot;&quot;

It is matter of speculation as to what Tone, who prided himself on being a political pragmatist, would have found expedient in an Irish republic.&#x27; In France, he criticised the Directory, not for a constitution that reintroduced the property franchise abolished with the monarchy, but for suffering themselves &quot;to be insulted in the most outrageous manner&quot; by the unsanctioned press. &quot;It is less dangerous&quot;, he wrote, &quot;for a government to be feared, or even hated, than despised&quot;.&quot;&quot; His recent biographer, Marianne Elliott, notes that Tone applauded the Directory&#x27;s suppression in April 1796 of Babeuf&#x27;s proto-socialist conspiracy.&#x27; This is consistent with what she concludes was a commitment to equality in Tone that did not truly extend beyond the abolition of aristocratic and confessional privilege.&quot;&quot;

=== Monarchy or republic ===
Questioning whether Tone had &quot;any sustained interest in republicanism as a form of government&quot;, the popular historian Andrew Boyd notes that, at the time the United Irishmen were formed, Tone confessed that his objective was not &quot;the establishment of a republic&quot; but to &quot;secure the independence of Ireland under any form of government&quot;. Four years later when, believing that &quot;the people of Ireland were in general very ignorant&quot;, General Clarke asked whether &quot;we might choose a king&quot;, Tone&#x27;s response was notably pragmatic.&quot;&quot;

The only person with the least chance of fulfilling such a role, in Tone&#x27;s view, was Lord Moira (after whom Tone had named his fourth child Francis Rawdon Tone). But the Patriot aristocrat had &quot;blown his reputation to pieces by accepting a command against France&quot;.&#x27; Tone&#x27;s larger objection to an Irish crown was that the Dissenters, who he was in no doubt would &quot;direct the public sentiment in framing a government&quot;, were &quot;thoroughly enlightened and sincere republicans&quot;.&#x27; He thought it &quot;absurd&quot; to suggest, as Clarke had done in his instructions to Hoche, that a member of the House of Stuart could be found who would be agreeable to all parties.&quot;&quot;

To Tone&#x27;s dismay from Humbert&#x27;s account of his misadventure in September 1798, the Directory concluded that the Irish were indeed more Jacobite than Jacobin: that they might be compared with the devoutly Catholic and royalist peasantry they had battled at home in the Vendée. Tone had again to rebuff the suggestion of a Jacobite restoration—that the Catholic Pretender, Henry Benedict Stuart, be recognised as Henry IX, King of the Irish.

==Legacy==

=== Nineteenth century ===
Praising his courage and his &quot;keen&quot; and &quot;lucid&quot; judgement, the otherwise unsympathetic Whig historian William Lecky set Tone &quot;far above the dreary level of commonplace which Irish conspiracy in general presents&quot;. But set upon a constitutional path by Daniel O&#x27;Connell, nationalist opinion in Ireland was slow to embrace his memory. Despite the efforts of his wife Mathilda and their son William who had collected his papers in a two-volume &quot;Life of Theobald Wolfe Tone&quot; (Washington in 1826), in the decades after his death, Tone&#x27;s name languished in relative obscurity.

In 1843, Thomas Davis published in &quot;The Nation&quot; his elegiac poem &quot;Tone&#x27;s Grave&quot;, and with Mathilda&#x27;s blessing, organised the first Bodenstown memorial.&#x27; With his fellow Young Irelander (and Protestant) John Mitchel, Davis found in Tone an &quot;alternative national hero&quot; to O&#x27;Connell, &quot;the Liberator&quot;, with whose solicitation of Whig government favour and Catholic clericalism they were increasingly disillusioned.&#x27; In his &quot;History of Ireland&quot; (1864), Mitchel drew uncritically from the &quot;Life&quot;, beginning what historian James Quinn suggests is a &quot;long tradition in nationalist historiography of treating Tone&#x27;s writing as sacred scripture&quot;.&quot;&quot;

Mitchel&#x27;s portrayal of Tone as an uncompromising martyr in the cause of independence was adopted, in turn, by a succeeding generation of &quot;physical-force&quot; republicans, the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), the &quot;Fenians&quot;.&#x27; In 1873, their supporters began the practice of annual pilgrimages to Bodenstown.&#x27; They saw it as fully in the spirit of Tone to dismiss, as a distraction from the struggle for independence, the Land League and other agrarian agitation.&quot;&quot;

In 1898, the centenary commemorations of the rebellion bore &quot;the stamp&quot; of O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s home-rule successors. Attempts by William Butler Yeats, president in Dublin of the Wolfe Tone Memorial Association&#x27; and, in Belfast, by Alice Milligan, author of her own six-penny version of Tone&#x27;s &quot;Life,&quot; to celebrate his secular republicanism, were overwhelmed by accounts of 1798 confined to the risings in the south. In these, Tone and other Protestant leaders were effectively sidelined. The focus was on Wexford where, at Oulart Hill, rebels had been led to their first victory by a Catholic priest, John Murphy. Meanwhile, at Tone&#x27;s graveside, Connolly claimed that his Irish Socialist Republican Party &quot;alone&quot; was &quot;in line with the thought of this revolutionary apostle of the United Irishmen&quot;.&#x27;

=== Twentieth century ===
In 1912, the IRB veteran Tom Clarke revived the lapsed commemorations at Bodenstown. Speaking at the graveside in 1913, Patrick Pearse described the site as the &quot;holiest place in Ireland&quot;, for &quot;though many had testified in death to the truth of Ireland’s claim to nationhood; Wolfe Tone was the greatest of all that had made that testimony; he was the greatest of Ireland’s dead&quot;. But while Tone many have been an &quot;apostle&quot; for those who rallied to the republic proclaimed by Pearse, Clarke and Connolly in 1916, writers with influence in the new Irish state after 1922 dismissed him as not being Irish enough.&quot;&quot; The &quot;Irish Irelander&quot; D. P. Moran, described Tone as &quot;a Frenchman born in Ireland of English parents&quot;, while in a work entitled &quot;Wolfe Tone and the United Irishmen—for or against Christ?&quot; (1937), Leo McCabe (the Jesuit, Br Denis Peter Fennell) associated the veneration of Tone with nothing less than a Judeo-Masonic-Communist conspiracy to destroy Christianity. Conversely there were those who, stressing his work as an agent of the Catholic Committee, sought to adapt Tone to the state&#x27;s Catholic-inflected nationalism. Aodh de Blácam, a close Fianna Fáil partisan of Éamon de Valera, insisted that Tone&#x27;s &quot;attachment to his mother&#x27;s Catholic people was with him to the end&quot;.

Anti-Treaty republicans were able to gather at the graveside only after the official, state-organised, demonstration involving martial displays by the National Army.&#x27; Once De Valera&#x27;s Fianna Fáil gained office in 1932, pro-Treaty Fine Gael abandoned Tone&#x27;s graveside for an annual ceremony at Béal na Bláth, in County Cork, where Michael Collins met his death in an ambush in August 1922.&#x27;

Tensions surrounding Tone&#x27;s legacy were evident in the 1934 Bodenstown commemorations. A Republican Congress &quot;James Connolly&quot; contingent from the Protestant Shankill Road in Belfast (accompanied by Jack White and by Winifred Carney) was blocked on their approach to the graveside and their &quot;red&quot; banner&quot;—&quot;Break the Connection with Capitalism&quot;—&quot;torn by IRA stewards. Each side accused the other of dishonouring, and misappropriating, Tone&#x27;s memory.&quot;&quot;

Arising out of the bi-centenary celebrations of Tone&#x27;s birth in 1963, left-leaning elements of the IRA formed the Wolfe Tone Societies. The WTS opposed the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s entry into the European Economic Community and protested the Vietnam War. A key figure in the WTS was Roy Johnston, of Protestant background, who (In the tradition of the Republican Congress) looked to recruit Protestants in Northern Ireland to the cause of national unity in a workers&#x27; republic.

Following his bi-centenary, a memorial to Tone was commissioned for St Stephen&#x27;s Green in Dublin. The work by Edward Delaney was unveiled in 1967 by Éamon de Valera. Having, in the name of Tone, opposed the dominion-status Irish Free State, De Valera took the occasion to declare that, while still to achieve national unity, the Republic of Ireland of which he was now president was that for which Tone had &quot;longed for and worked for”&quot;.&quot;

In October 1969, the Ulster loyalist UVF claimed responsibility for bombing and damaging the Bodenstown memorial to &quot;the traitor Wolfe Tone&quot;. In June 1975, the UVF sought to derail a train near Sallins carrying 250 Official IRA supporters to the annual commemoration, and murdered a witness to their attempt.

In 1998, the rebellion&#x27;s bicentenary, Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams and Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern made separate appearances at Bodenstown to claim Tone&#x27;s sanction for their endorsement of the &quot;Good Friday&quot; Belfast Agreement. Acknowledging &quot;with pride&quot; the roots of its republicanism in &quot;the mainly Presbyterian United Irish movement,” Adams declared Sinn Féin equal to the task Tone had set for those truly committed to a sovereign Ireland: to &quot;cast off the manacles of religious sectarianism and &#x27;abolish the memory of past dissensions&#x27;&quot;. Ahern offered that in that Article 1, the Agreement conceded the &quot;central tenet&quot; of Tone&#x27;s vision and that of all those who in succeeding generations &quot;worked for reconciliation and peace between the different traditions on this island&quot;. It states: &quot;that it is for the people of Ireland alone, by peaceful agreement, between the two parts but without external impediment, to exercise the right of self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, North and South&quot;.

Two years later, Ahern used the same occasion to threaten extraordinary measures against those he described as capable of uniting Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter &quot;only in death&quot;. Dissident republicans, who saw rather a cementing of partition, had been holding their own Bodenstown rallies. From Tone, they claimed a &quot;continuing legacy” of struggle against “British occupation“.

==Descendants==
Of Tone&#x27;s four children, three died prematurely. His eldest child, Maria Tone (1786–1803; died in Paris) and his youngest child, Francis Rawdon Tone (1793–1806) both died of tuberculosis. Another son, Richard Tone (born between 1787 and 1789) died in infancy.

Only his son William Theobald Wolfe Tone (b. 1789/91) survived to adulthood. Raised in France by his mother after Tone&#x27;s death, William was appointed a cadet in the Imperial School of Cavalry in 1810 on Napoleon&#x27;s orders. He was a naturalised French citizen on 4 May 1812. In January 1813 he was made sub-lieutenant in the 8th Regiment of Chasseurs and joined the Grand Army in Germany. His nom de guerre was the punning &quot;le petit loup&quot; – the little wolf. He was at the battles of Löwenberg, Goldberg, Dresden, Bauthen, Mühlberg, and Aachen. Following the Battle of Leipzig, in which he received lance wounds, he was promoted to lieutenant and was decorated with the Legion of Honour.

After the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo, William emigrated to the New York, where studied law with the United Irish veteran and abolitionist, William Sampson, married his daughter, and in 1819 won a commission a captain in the United States Army. He died on 11 October 1828 at the age of 37, survived by his only child, his daughter Grace Georgina.

Matilda Tone also returned to the United States, where in 1816 she married Thomas Wilson, a Scottish businessman and advocate who had taken care of Tone&#x27;s financial affairs after the death of her husband. Her efforts, with Wilson, to return to Ireland were twice rebuffed by the British authorities. She died in 1849, and is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. 

==In popular culture==
Several Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in Ireland are named in honour of Wolfe Tone. These include, in Kildare, Wolfe Tones GAA; in Armagh, Wolfe Tone GAC, Derrymacash; in Derry, Bellaghy Wolfe Tones GAC; in Meath, Wolfe Tones GAA, and in Tyrone, Drumquin Wolfe Tones GAC and Kildress Wolfe Tones GAC. In North America, there is the Chicago Wolfe Tones GFC in Illinois, and the Edmonton Wolfe Tones in Alberta, Canada. In Antrim, the Greencastle Wolfe Tones GAC is based in the Greencastle district of North Belfast, bordering Cavehill where members of the United Irishmen took their oaths.

In 1963, Brian Warfield, Noel Nagle, Tommy Byrne, and Derek Warfield formed The Wolfe Tones, an Irish republican band. They play Irish rebel music and have courted some controversy with songs celebrating the Provisional IRA.

In 1998, Tone, played by the actor Adrian Dunbar, was the protagonist in an RTE four-part television movie, &quot;The Officer From France.&quot;

The bicentennial year also saw publication of &quot;Belmont Castle: or, Suffering Sensibility&quot; &quot;by Theobald Wolfe Tone &amp; divers hands&quot;. Edited by Marion Deane, it is an epistolary novel that Tone wrote with two friends in 1790, manuscripts of which were found in his possession when he was arrested in 1798. It is described as &quot;an elaborate roman à clef, satirizing the lives of several prominent figures of the Anglo-Irish establishment and redressing a painful love affair [with Lady Elizabeth Vesey] from Tone’s past&quot;.

<text>The South Bohemian Region () is an administrative unit (&quot;kraj&quot;) of the Czech Republic, located mostly in the southern part of its historical land of Bohemia, with a small part in southwestern Moravia. The western part of the South Bohemian Region is former Prácheňsko, a huge archaic region with distinctive features with its capital, Písek. In 2011, there were 624 municipalities in the region, whereof 54 had a status of a town.

The region borders (from the west clockwise) the regions of Plzeň, Central Bohemian, Vysočina and South Moravian. To the south, it borders Austria (Lower Austria and Upper Austria) and Germany (Bavaria). Until 30 May 2001, the region was named as or , after its capital, České Budějovice.

Due to its geographical location and natural surroundings the region belongs to the first settlements that appeared in the distant past. Over the past centuries, the South Bohemian region has been known for fishpond cultivation and forestry. The region has been industrialized since the beginning of the twentieth century. Nowadays, it is a tourist destination due to its natural and historical richness, and the fastest growing industry has been the travel industry.

== History ==
On 1 May 1939 the Reichsgau Oberdonau was created by the Nazis in accordance with the Ostmark law of 14 April 1939 on the territory of Upper Austria following the Anschluss (annexation of Austria) in autumn 1938. This encompassed those districts of South Bohemia (Kaplitz und Krumau) that had long been settled by Germans. This was reversed after the Second World War and the German-speaking population that had lived in the area since the Middle Ages was expelled. Until 2001 the region of South Bohemia was called &quot;Budějovický kraj&quot;.

==Administrative divisions==
The South Bohemian Region was established with constitutional Act No. 347/97 of Collections concerning the formation of higher territorial administrative units. The region and its authorities are specified by Act No. 129-2000 of Collections concerning regions, which came into effect on the day of the regional authorities elections, 1 January 2001.
The region is divided into 7 districts:

==Population and area==
The total area of the region is 10,057 km2 which is 12.8% of the total area of the Czech Republic. As of 2024, South Bohemian Region&#x27;s population is 654,505 and with only 65 people per square kilometer, the region has the lowest population density in the whole country.

64.2% of the region&#x27;s population lives in towns or cities. One-third of the inhabitants live in the five largest municipalities. Only 4% of region&#x27;s population lives in municipalities with less than 200 inhabitants.

As of 2024, the average age in the region is 43.3 years. Approximately 11% of inhabitants who were 15 years or older had a university degree (in 2001 this was 8%). According to the 2011 census, 20.6% of inhabitants in the region believe in God (however, almost half of the people did not answer this question). The table below gives an overview of the 10 most populated towns and cities in the region (as of 1 January 2024).

Other significant towns are: Vimperk, Dačice, Kaplice, Soběslav, Sezimovo Ústí, Vodňany, Blatná, Veselí nad Lužnicí, Bechyně and Protivín. The following table provides more details on the districts of the South Bohemian Region:

==Geography ==

The central part of the South Bohemian Region consists of the České Budějovice Basin and Třeboň Basin. The southwest consists of the Bohemian Forest mountain range and its foothills, the Gratzen Mountains and its foothills are located to the south. The northern part of the region extends to the Central Bohemian Uplands. The eastern part lies in the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands. The highest elevation in the region is the high Plechý in the Bohemian Forest, the lowest elevation with above sea level is at the Orlík Dam.

The region is located in the drainage basin of Vltava river. Other significant rivers are Malše, Lužnice, Otava, Nežárka and Lomnice. South Bohemia is known for its many ponds. In the past, more than seven thousand ponds were established across the region. With its 489 ha Rožmberk is the largest one, followed by Bezdrev (450 ha) and Horusice pond (415 ha). In the 20th century, a series of dams were constructed on the Vltava river. Lipno Reservoir is the largest reservoir in the Czech Republic and has an area of 4,870 ha. Other dams in the region are Orlík Dam, Římov Dam and Hněvkovice Dam.

A big part of the Šumava National Park is situated in South Bohemia. The Bohemian Forest is a holiday destination, in particular, with hikers. Many natural and cultural sights are connected with more than 500 km of summer marked trails and bike trails.

==Climate==
The climate in South Bohemia is of a transitional Central European type. It is affected alternatively by an oceanic influence from the west, and a continental influence from the east. Therefore, the weather can be variable. Most of the South Bohemian region belongs to the mild, warm and wet zone and at altitudes above 750 m, this passes to mild and cool. The warmest month is usually July, with temperatures averaging between 17 and 18 °C in valley areas. In higher localities (over 900 m) the temperatures can drop below 14 °C. Days with temperatures above 25 °C are most frequently in valley-basins, and the area around the confluence of the rivers Lužnice and Vltava (Moldau): on average there are 40-50 such days a year.

==Economy==

In 2021, the region produced 4,8% of the national GDP. The GDP per capita is 79% of the national average. It&#x27;s the 11th position out of 14 among all regions. In 2011, the business sector in the South Bohemian Region comprises 159,000 entities, 114,000 of which were sole traders. There are more than 300 thousand people employed in the region, whereof 31% in industry, 13% in trade and 10% in construction sector. The average salary in the region in September 2013 was CZK 21,768 (approximately EUR 850). The unemployment rate in September 2013 was 6.05%.

The Region does not rank among key industrial areas of the Czech Republic. The industrial production is concentrated particularly in the area of České Budějovice and in Tábor District and Strakonice District. The food and drink processing industries play a significant role in the region. Other important sectors are the automotive industry, production of machinery and appliances, and also the textile and clothing industries. Recently, the travel industry has become an important sector in the region.

The Czech Academy of Sciences, whose institutes operate all over the region, provides a good base for the development of science. These institutes focus mostly on biology and ecology. Scientific work is also part of the activities of the University of South Bohemia (Czech: Jihočeská univerzita) with its headquarters in České Budějovice and Jindřichův Hradec.

Approximately 11% of the national agricultural production is produced in the South Bohemian Region. The agricultural sector focuses on plant production, mostly on growing cereals, oil plants, and potatoes. In animal husbandry, the breeding of cattle and pigs prevails. Fishpond cultivation has a long tradition in South Bohemia. Fish husbandry in the total area of 25 000 ha makes up about 50% of the total national production.

==Architecture==

The region is famous for its small villages with a pond in the middle. These are generally built in the style of the Rustic Baroque, also known as South Bohemian Baroque:

&quot;Rustic Baroque is a term for the unique architecture of South Bohemia. The local folk bricklayer masters Martin Paták and František Šoch created a new type of South Bohemian farmhouse with an ornate frontispiece in the middle of the 19th century. A typical building of this style is a massive rustic farmhouse with two richly decorated frontispieces, which are joined by an arched gate with small doors. The marshland frontispieces are beautifully decorated, they have lavish contours, the surface is usually divided by allusive decorative columns, completed by arches, stylised hearts, four-leafed clovers, meadow flowers.&quot;

<doc id="171377" wikidata="Q3349460" url="?curid=171377" title="The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences">
<text>&quot;The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences&quot; is a 1960 article written by the physicist Eugene Wigner, published in &quot;Communication in Pure and Applied Mathematics&quot;. In it, Wigner observes that a theoretical physics&#x27;s mathematical structure often points the way to further advances in that theory and to empirical predictions. Mathematical theories often have predictive power in describing nature.

==Observations and arguments==
Wigner argues that mathematical concepts have applicability far beyond the context in which they were originally developed. He writes: &quot;It is important to point out that the mathematical formulation of the physicist&#x27;s often crude experience leads in an uncanny number of cases to an amazingly accurate description of a large class of phenomena.&quot; He adds that the observation &quot;the laws of nature are written in the language of mathematics,&quot; properly made by Galileo three hundred years ago, &quot;is now truer than ever before.&quot;

Wigner&#x27;s first example is the law of gravitation formulated by Isaac Newton. Originally used to model freely falling bodies on the surface of the Earth, this law was extended based on what Wigner terms &quot;very scanty observations&quot; to describe the motion of the planets, where it &quot;has proved accurate beyond all reasonable expectations.&quot; Wigner says that &quot;Newton... noted that the parabola of the thrown rock&#x27;s path on the earth and the circle of the moon&#x27;s path in the sky are particular cases of the same mathematical object of an ellipse, and postulated the universal law of gravitation on the basis of a single, and at that time very approximate, numerical coincidence.&quot;

Wigner&#x27;s second example comes from quantum mechanics: Max Born &quot;noticed that some rules of computation, given by Heisenberg, were formally identical with the rules of computation with matrices, established a long time before by mathematicians. Born, Jordan, and Heisenberg then proposed to replace by matrices the position and momentum variables of the equations of classical mechanics. They applied the rules of matrix mechanics to a few highly idealized problems and the results were quite satisfactory. However, there was, at that time, no rational evidence that their matrix mechanics would prove correct under more realistic conditions.&quot; But Wolfgang Pauli found their work accurately described the hydrogen atom: &quot;This application gave results in agreement with experience.&quot; The helium atom, with two electrons, is more complex, but &quot;nevertheless, the calculation of the lowest energy level of helium, as carried out a few months ago by Kinoshita at Cornell and by Bazley at the Bureau of Standards, agrees with the experimental data within the accuracy of the observations, which is one part in ten million. Surely in this case we &#x27;got something out&#x27; of the equations that we did not put in.&quot; The same is true of the atomic spectra of heavier elements.

Wigner&#x27;s last example comes from quantum electrodynamics: &quot;Whereas Newton&#x27;s theory of gravitation still had obvious connections with experience, experience entered the formulation of matrix mechanics only in the refined or sublimated form of Heisenberg&#x27;s prescriptions. The quantum theory of the Lamb shift, as conceived by Bethe and established by Schwinger, is a purely mathematical theory and the only direct contribution of experiment was to show the existence of a measurable effect. The agreement with calculation is better than one part in a thousand.&quot;

There are examples beyond the ones mentioned by Wigner. Another often cited example is Maxwell&#x27;s equations, derived to model the elementary electrical and magnetic phenomena known in the mid-19th century. The equations also describe radio waves, discovered by David Edward Hughes in 1879, around the time of James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s death.

==Responses==
The responses the thesis received include:
* Richard Hamming in computer science, &quot;The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics&quot;.
* Arthur Lesk in molecular biology, &quot;The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in Molecular Biology&quot;.
* Peter Norvig in artificial intelligence, &quot;The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data&quot;
* Max Tegmark in physics, &quot;The Mathematical Universe&quot;.
* Ivor Grattan-Guinness in mathematics, &quot;Solving Wigner&#x27;s mystery: The reasonable (though perhaps limited) effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences&quot;.
* Vela Velupillai in economics, &quot;The Unreasonable Ineffectiveness of Mathematics in Economics&quot;.

===Richard Hamming===

Mathematician and Turing Award laureate Richard Hamming reflected on and extended Wigner&#x27;s &quot;Unreasonable Effectiveness&quot; in 1980, discussing four &quot;partial explanations&quot; for it, and concluding that they were unsatisfactory. They were:

1. &quot;Humans see what they look for&quot;. The belief that science is experimentally grounded is only partially true. Hamming gives four examples of nontrivial physical phenomena he believes arose from the mathematical tools employed and not from the intrinsic properties of physical reality.
* Hamming proposes that Galileo discovered the law of falling bodies not by experimenting, but by simple, though careful, thinking. Hamming imagines Galileo as having engaged in the following thought experiment (the experiment, which Hamming calls &quot;scholastic reasoning&quot;, is described in Galileo&#x27;s book &quot;On Motion&quot;.):

: Suppose that a falling body broke into two pieces. Of course, the two pieces would immediately slow down to their appropriate speeds. But suppose further that one piece happened to touch the other one. Would they now be one piece and both speed up? Suppose I tie the two pieces together. How tightly must I do it to make them one piece? A light string? A rope? Glue? When are two pieces one?

: There is simply no way a falling body can &quot;answer&quot; such hypothetical &quot;questions.&quot; Hence Galileo would have concluded that &quot;falling bodies need not know anything if they all fall with the same velocity, unless interfered with by another force.&quot; After coming up with this argument, Hamming found a related discussion in Pólya (1963: 83-85). Hamming&#x27;s account does not reveal an awareness of the 20th-century scholarly debate over just what Galileo did.

*The inverse square law of universal gravitation necessarily follows from the conservation of energy and of space having three dimensions. Measuring the exponent in the law of universal gravitation is more a test of whether space is Euclidean than a test of the properties of the gravitational field.
*The inequality at the heart of the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics follows from the properties of Fourier integrals and from assuming time invariance.
*Hamming argues that Albert Einstein&#x27;s pioneering work on special relativity was largely &quot;scholastic&quot; in its approach. He knew from the outset what the theory should look like (although he only knew this because of the Michelson–Morley experiment), and explored candidate theories with mathematical tools, not actual experiments. Hamming alleges that Einstein was so confident that his relativity theories were correct that the outcomes of observations designed to test them did not much interest him. If the observations were inconsistent with his theories, it would be the observations that were at fault.

2. &quot;Humans create and select the mathematics that fit a situation&quot;. The mathematics at hand does not always work. For example, when mere scalars proved awkward for understanding forces, first vectors, then tensors, were invented.

3. &quot;Mathematics addresses only a part of human experience&quot;. Much of human experience does not fall under science or mathematics but under the philosophy of value, including ethics, aesthetics, and political philosophy. To assert that the world can be explained via mathematics amounts to an act of faith.

4. &quot;Evolution has primed humans to think mathematically&quot;. The earliest lifeforms must have contained the seeds of the human ability to create and follow long chains of close reasoning.

===Max Tegmark===
Physicist Max Tegmark argued that the effectiveness of mathematics in describing external physical reality is because the physical world is an abstract mathematical structure. This theory, referred to as the mathematical universe hypothesis, mirrors ideas previously advanced by Peter Atkins. However, Tegmark explicitly states that &quot;the true mathematical structure isomorphic to our world, if it exists, has not yet been found.&quot; Rather, mathematical theories in physics are successful because they approximate more complex and predictive mathematics. According to Tegmark, &quot;Our successful theories are not mathematics approximating physics, but simple mathematics approximating more complex mathematics.&quot;

===Ivor Grattan-Guinness===
Ivor Grattan-Guinness found the effectiveness in question eminently reasonable and explicable in terms of concepts such as analogy, generalization, and metaphor. He emphasizes that Wigner largely ignores &quot;the effectiveness of the natural sciences in mathematics, in that much mathematics has been motivated by interpretations in the sciences&quot;.

===Michael Atiyah===
The tables were turned by Michael Atiyah with his essay &quot;The unreasonable effectiveness of physics in mathematics.&quot; He argued that the toolbox of physics enables a practitioner like Edward Witten to go beyond standard mathematics, in particular the geometry of 4-manifolds. The tools of a physicist are cited as quantum field theory, special relativity, non-abelian gauge theory, spin, chirality, supersymmetry, and the electromagnetic duality.

<text>Coal Chamber is an American nu metal band formed by Dez Fafara and Meegs Rascón in Los Angeles in 1992, initially under the name She&#x27;s in Pain. The original lineup also consisted of bassist Rayna Foss and drummer Jon Tor. Mike Cox replaced Tor on drums in 1995, and the Coal Chamber lineup was complete. After signing to Roadrunner Records, they released their debut album, &quot;Coal Chamber&quot;, in 1997.

&quot;Chamber Music&quot; followed two years later and featured the band&#x27;s only charting single in the US, a cover of Peter Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;Shock the Monkey&quot;, featuring Ozzy Osbourne as a guest vocalist. Their third album, &quot;Dark Days&quot;, was released in the spring of 2002. Nadja Peulen temporarily replaced Foss on bass for touring commitments, before joining on a permanent basis in 2002. Coal Chamber disbanded in 2003, after ten years together, and then reunited in 2011, with the lineup of Fafara, Cox, and Rascón, along with Chela Rhea Harper on bass. Peulen rejoined the band on bass in 2013, and Coal Chamber released their fourth album, &quot;Rivals&quot;, in 2015, before disbanding again in 2016. They then reunited a second time in 2022.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1992–1995)===
Coal Chamber was originally formed in 1992 under the name She&#x27;s in Pain by vocalist Dez Fafara and guitarist Miguel &quot;Meegs&quot; Rascón, based on a mutual love for the Sisters of Mercy. After a few shows, they decided to change the band&#x27;s lineup, and they adopted their present name in 1993. Bassist Rayna Foss was recruited through a newspaper ad. According to Foss, the band at the time was named &quot;Coal&quot;, while Rascón wanted to name it &quot;Chamber&quot;, and they ended up combining the two words. The band had two drummers in the two-and-a-half years prior to their signing with a label, the longest-lasting being John Tor.

In late 1994, Dino Cazares of Fear Factory championed a demo tape by Coal Chamber, causing a huge local stir with gigs at the Roxy Theatre and Whisky a Go Go, eventually leading Roadrunner Records to offer the band a contract. Fafara dropped out quite suddenly due to disagreements with his wife about the band. In early 1995, he reunited with Coal Chamber, which ended his marriage but revitalized the band. With a renewed sense of energy, Coal Chamber was able to regain their deal with Roadrunner, which they signed in December 1995. A few weeks prior, John Tor was fired for &quot;constantly fighting&quot; with Rascón, per Fafara. Around the same time, they auditioned Mikey Cox and his brother, hiring the former as their new drummer.

===&quot;Coal Chamber&quot; (1996–1998)===
In 1996, Coal Chamber played at the first Ozzfest. The band managed to catch the attention of Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s wife, Sharon, who became their manager. They recorded their first album, &quot;Coal Chamber&quot;, which was released on February 11, 1997. The record produced one single and a video, &quot;Loco&quot;, directed by Nathan &quot;Karma&quot; Cox. The video was included as an extra after the ending credits of Dee Snider&#x27;s film &quot;Strangeland&quot;. The band also recorded an exclusive song for the soundtrack, titled &quot;Not Living&quot;. The album only sold 844 copies in its first week; at its peak, it was selling 5,000 copies per week. On December 21, 1999, it was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), signifying over 500,000 copies sold.

In 1997, the band toured Europe with Machine Head, Napalm Death, and Skinlab, including a show at the Dynamo Festival in the Netherlands. Coal Chamber also supported Pantera on tour from September through December 1997, along with Anthrax. Also, in 1997 and 1998, the band opened for Megadeth during the &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot; tour.

===&quot;Chamber Music&quot; (1999–2000)===
In September 1999, Coal Chamber released its second album, &quot;Chamber Music&quot;. Prior to its publication, it was dubbed one of the most anticipated albums of the year by &quot;Alternative Press&quot;. The album saw the band experiment with their sound, placing a greater emphasis on harmonies and symphonic qualities. According to &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, the record was &quot;one of the few instances where a band lumped into the whole nü-metal phylum sought to challenge their audience.&quot; &quot;Chamber Music&quot; sold 48,000 copies in it first week and debuted at number 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, while its lead single, a cover of Peter Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;Shock the Monkey&quot;, featuring Ozzy Osbourne, gave the band their first radio hit. Despite this, the album received mixed reviews from critics and did not sell as well as their debut, with only 272,000 copies sold by 2002. According to Cox, &quot;A lot of our fans hated [the] album, after not getting more of the same as the first one. The second MTV played our video, that&#x27;s it, they said we were sellouts.&quot; Fafara recognized that that record&#x27;s direction was not well-received by the band&#x27;s fanbase but did not view it as a failure due to its initial positive reception.

Coal Chamber embarked on headlining and festival tours in support of the album. That year, the band took part in Insane Clown Posse&#x27;s Amazing Jeckel Brothers Tour, along with Biohazard, Krayzie Bone, Twiztid, and Mindless Self Indulgence. While Biohazard, Mindless Self Indulgence, Krayzie Bone, and Twiztid were well received by audiences, Coal Chamber was not. ICP fans were not purchasing tickets, as they did not like the band. For the three shows that Coal Chamber played, there were multiple ticket refunds. ICP member Violent J and his brother, Rob, made the decision to eliminate Coal Chamber from the tour. After doing so, there were no ticket refunds for the remaining tour dates. ICP claimed that Coal Chamber had been removed due to equipment problems but later revealed the true reason for their actions on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, on August 19, 1999. On air, Osbourne, who also appeared as a guest, informed Bruce and Utsler that Coal Chamber filed a lawsuit for breach of contract. Between August and December 1999, Nadja Peulen filled in on bass while Rayna Foss went on maternity leave. Foss returned to the band in January 2000.

On March 10, 2000, it was announced that Coal Chamber had amicably parted ways with Sharon Osbourne Management. Rascón said that the band&#x27;s relationship with Osbourne had &quot;run its course and we needed to find another point of view&quot;. Conversely, Fafara claimed that the other members of Coal Chamber had met up in a hotel—alleging some members had been &quot;up for four or five days straight on meth&quot;—and fired Osbourne without consulting him. He believes that this cost the band their only &quot;good shot in the [music] business&quot;. On March 29, 2000, the band signed with Left Bank Management. Having grown exhausted from being on the road together for five years, Coal Chamber abruptly ended touring in support of &quot;Chamber Music&quot; in July 2000 and dropped off the Tattoo the Earth tour a week before it was due to begin, ostensibly to begin work on new material. The band members did not communicate with one another for a year, until Fafara and Rascón reconnected to work on a song with Mötley Crüe bassist Nikki Sixx.

===&quot;Dark Days&quot; and first disbandment (2001–2003)===
Between May and September 2001, Coal Chamber recorded their third album, &quot;Dark Days&quot;, with producer Ross Hogarth. The recording sessions were marked with high drug use and tensions between Fafara and Rascón, the latter of which informed the album&#x27;s tone and some of its lyrics. A week after recording concluded, Foss left the band to raise her daughter, and Peulen was brought back as her official replacement; Foss&#x27;s departure was announced in January 2002.

&quot;Dark Days&quot; was issued on May 6, 2002, to mixed reviews. The album had sold 200,000 copies by December 2003. Prior to its release, Coal Chamber joined the Jägermeister tour across the United States, which commenced on March 8. On April 17, Fafara and Rascón got into an onstage altercation during a show in Lubbock, Texas. Tensions between the two were high, and they had been fighting before the show. During the first song, Rascón stabbed Fafara with the headstock of his guitar, after which they began fighting. Fafara then announced to the audience, &quot;This is the last Coal Chamber show ever!&quot; and stormed offstage. Coal Chamber attempted to continue the show with Rascón on vocals but soon stopped altogether after two more songs; Cox demolished his drumkit before storming offstage. Fafara and Rascón exchanged further blows after the show when the latter returned to the band&#x27;s tour bus. Two days after the concert, Coal Chamber dropped off the Jägermeister tour. On May 15, 2002, the band made their debut appearance on television, performing &quot;Fiend&quot; on &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot;. In June and July 2002, they embarked on a summer tour of the United States with American Head Charge, Lollipop Lust Kill, and Medication. For the duration of the tour, Fafara and Rascón traveled in separate tour buses.

In August 2002, Fafara formed the band Deathride, later known as DevilDriver. In September 2002, he denied that Coal Chamber was breaking up. In October 2002, Coal Chamber parted ways with their management and Cox. In May 2003, Peulen said that the band would be releasing a B-sides compilation but that there was no new drummer or album on the horizon. In July, Rascón confirmed that Coal Chamber had split up. Fafara attributed the split primarily to the band&#x27;s escalating drug use (in particular with Rascón and Cox), stating that he did not want to help fund their drug habits. He also mentioned creative and business differences. A month after the band&#x27;s split, a compilation album, titled &quot;Giving the Devil His Due&quot;, was released, which included several demo tracks submitted by Coal Chamber prior to their signing with Roadrunner Records in 1997, along with alternative studio recordings and remixes of various tracks from their previous albums.

===Post-breakup (2003–2010)===
In August 2004, Roadrunner Records released &quot;The Best of Coal Chamber&quot;. In June 2005, Fafara stated that Coal Chamber&#x27;s break was permanent and they would not be reforming. He also described a reformation as &quot;like asking someone if they would ever want to go back and repeat the third and fourth grades after they&#x27;re already done with high school&quot;.

Fafara continued as vocalist of the metal band DevilDriver, recording seven albums: &quot;DevilDriver&quot;, &quot;The Fury of Our Maker&#x27;s Hand&quot;, &quot;The Last Kind Words&quot;, &quot;Pray for Villains&quot;, &quot;Beast&quot;, &quot;Winter Kills&quot;, and &quot;Trust No One&quot;. He is the only member of Coal Chamber to release an album after the disbandment. Bass guitarist Nadja Puelen created the t-shirt company CruelTees. After taking two years off to recover from a car accident, drummer Mikey &quot;Bug&quot; Cox joined forces with his longtime friend and Orgy member Jay Gordon—and the producer of Coal Chamber&#x27;s first album - to form Machine Gun Orchestra. Guitarist Meegs Rascón formed the rock band Glass Piñata, previously known as Piñata. The group released a few demos on their website, and faced several line-up changes before eventually disbanding. Following Glass Piñata, Rascón joined the Orange County rock/electro band NEO GEO in mid-2009, although he later left the band in 2010.

Fafara and Rascón settled their differences on October 24, 2008, with Rascón joining DevilDriver on stage at the Glasshouse in Pomona, California, to play &quot;Loco&quot;.

In September 2009, it was announced that Peulen and Cox had joined forces to form an unnamed band. They were seeking a vocalist and guitarist to complete the lineup.

In September 2010, Rascón and Cox joined together in a post-punk band called We Are the Riot.

===Reformation, &quot;Rivals&quot;, and second disbandment (2011–2017)===
In September 2011, Fafara, Cox, and Rascón officially reformed the band with bass guitarist Chela Rhea Harper, to play the Soundwave festival in Australia. In October 2012, Fafara stated that the band were &quot;taking it slow&quot;, partly due to his commitments with DevilDriver, but he also revealed that they had begun writing new material. The band later performed at Download 2013 and toured with Sevendust, Lacuna Coil, and Stolen Babies, with performances at Rock Am Ring, Graspop Metal Meeting in Dessel, and Nova Rock festival.

Nadja Peulen officially reunited with the band in October 2013, and they signed to Napalm Records the following year, as they continued to work on a new album. This was completed in December 2014. In February 2015, Coal Chamber revealed that the album&#x27;s title was &quot;Rivals&quot;. They premiered the song &quot;I.O.U. Nothing&quot; online in March, and released a lyric video for &quot;Suffer in Silence&quot;, which features Al Jourgensen, the following month. The album was released on May 19, 2015, and was their first studio album in 13 years, as well as their first to be released by Napalm Records.

In May 2016, Fafara confirmed during an interview with &quot;Blunt&quot; magazine that Coal Chamber was on indefinite hiatus, stating that due to the current success of his other band DevilDriver, Coal Chamber &quot;has no place in my life whatsoever at this point.&quot; In June 2017, Fafara explained that he would start performing Coal Chamber songs with DevilDriver, coming to the realization that Coal Chamber would probably never tour or make music ever again. He then went on to say that the band is &quot;done forever&quot;. In July 2018, Fafara officially announced that Coal Chamber was not coming back.
In 2020, Fafara spoke about the band&#x27;s status during an interview with Metal Hammer. When asked about a possible reunion, Fafara stated: &quot;I&#x27;m not gonna say no, because we&#x27;ve all spoken&quot;, adding, &quot;The main thing for me is that the relationship is all good after numerous fallouts in the beginning and after some stuff went horribly wrong when we got back together to release [2015 comeback album] &quot;Rivals&quot;. The vibe in that camp is very cool at the moment, and we all have each other&#x27;s backs. I wouldn&#x27;t put it past us, but right now I&#x27;m definitely concentrating on Devildriver&quot;.

===Second reunion (2022–present)===
Coal Chamber announced their second reunion in November 2022 as well as their scheduled appearance at the 2023 Sick New World Festival in Las Vegas, Nevada. According to Fafara, a factor in the reunion was his certainty of dying from a COVID-19 infection, which prompted his wife to contact the rest of the band. He later indicated the possibility of new music down the line, saying, &quot;I realized that any problem we&#x27;ve ever had is gone&quot;.

==Musical style and influences==
Coal Chamber is most commonly categorized as nu metal or alternative metal. Their self-titled album falls into the first category. Elements of hip hop and heavy metal are featured throughout the album. Coal Chamber&#x27;s second album, &quot;Chamber Music&quot;, is also mainly nu metal, with elements of other genres such as gothic rock, industrial, and electronic music. &quot;Rivals&quot; has groove metal influences and moves away from their gothic-influenced older sound. Coal Chamber have also described their sound as &quot;spookycore&quot;, a term invented by the band&#x27;s fans. In a 2002 interview, Fafara said of the band&#x27;s &quot;spookycore&quot; label:

The kids came up with it first because we started gettin&#x27; a lot of comparisons to Korn and stuff. Which is fine. They&#x27;re a great band. But I think the kids wanted to say &quot;No, Coal Chamber is totally different than that.&quot; So they started comin&#x27; up with &quot;Spooky-core&quot; and we ran with it. We were like &quot;Yeah! That&#x27;s what we are.&quot; I mean if you put it into essence, we&#x27;re a dark rock-n-roll band. It&#x27;s almost like sayin&#x27; the same thing. &quot;Spooky-Core.&quot; &quot;Dark Rock-n-Roll.&quot; You know what I mean? I started thinkin&#x27; about it like that and was like &quot;Whoa! These kids know what they&#x27;re doin&#x27;.&quot; If someone&#x27;s gonna coin it [your music], who better than the fans?

The band&#x27;s influences include Bad Brains, Bauhaus, Black Sabbath, the Cure, Dead or Alive, Duran Duran, Helmet, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Kiss, Metallica, the Sisters of Mercy, Slayer, Tori Amos, and White Zombie.

==Legacy==
Coal Chamber is considered to be one of the bands that popularized and defined the nu metal sound. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; wrote that &quot;Nü metal would never have left the starting gates if it weren&#x27;t for the achievements of Coal Chamber [...] &#x27;Loco&#x27; and &#x27;Fiend&#x27; paved the way for the darker side of nü metal to step into the limelight beyond the lifespan of Coal Chamber themselves.&quot; &quot;Revolver&quot; credited the band for introducing gothic and industrial influences into the look of nu metal, which Kittie and Dope would later adopt. Likewise, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; said that the band &quot;pre-empted the arrival of outfits like Slipknot, marrying feelings of personal anguish to slab-heavy catharsis, then filtering the lot through an absurdist nightmare lens.&quot; The band&#x27;s 1997 debut is generally regarded as one of the greatest albums of the nu metal genre, being featured in lists by &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;, &quot;LA Weekly&quot;, &quot;Loudwire&quot;, and &quot;Revolver&quot;.

At the same time, Coal Chamber have been criticized for their image and similarities to Korn, with the latter stemming largely from their debut album. The &quot;Houston Press&quot; noted in 2000 that although both Korn and Coal Chamber rose out of the same scene, and as such, shared the same audiences and sound, the latter was perceived as being derivative of Korn, since the former group had achieved success first. By 1999, the band was considered &quot;a pariah of the metal community&quot;, according to &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot;. In 2009, Dayal Patterson of &quot;The Quietus&quot; called Coal Chamber &quot;something of an icon for nu metal&#x27;s limitations&quot;, while describing their legacy as &quot;a collection of one-idea songs and a portfolio of truly laughable photos.&quot; In their book &quot;A History of Heavy Metal&quot; (2017), Andrew O&#x27;Neill dismissed Coal Chamber as &quot;a distinctly forgettable, cartoonish band, taking all the childish aspects of Korn and throwing away the real emotion and aggression.&quot; Roadrunner A&amp;R head Monte Conner said that although the band received &quot;some grief&quot; due to their similarities to Korn, he believed they were &quot;the first to follow [them]—I would say that Coal Chamber&#x27;s first record was the second nu metal record ever to come out.&quot;

<text>The Automatic Voice Network (AUTOVON, military designation 490-L) was a worldwide American military telephone system. The system was built starting in 1963, based on the Army&#x27;s existing Switch Communications Automated Network (SCAN) system. 

In June 1966, the Air Defense Command voice network was cut over to the new service. In 1969, AUTOVON switching centers opened in the United Kingdom, and later in other European countries, Asia, the Middle East, and Panama. It was a major part of the Defense Communications System (DCS), providing non-secure switched voice services. The system was replaced in the early 1990s by the Defense Switched Network.

==Circuits==
AUTOVON used a combination of its own constructed circuits and other lines operated by AT&amp;T Corporation and smaller independent telephone companies, connected by high-speed switching centers produced by Automatic Electric Company to exchanges located far from other civilian or military targets. In the US the cables were predominantly L-carrier coaxial multiplex built by AT&amp;T, who also used them to carry about one third of all civilian long-distance calls, as their capacity was much higher than the military needed. Although unused, some of the cables remain today and the routes are visible on satellite photos. The system&#x27;s traffic was transported over many media other than underground cable, including microwave links, open wire and, near the end of the system&#x27;s life, fiber optic. 

Most of the cable was directly buried without added concrete, relying instead on the natural protection of soil. In some areas, however, cables from the AUTOSEVOCOM network were laid in parallel. These were often concrete-encased when the traffic they were carrying was not encrypted.

The telephone switches used were initially a 4 wire version of Number Five Crossbar Switching System, replaced in the early 1970s after the more versatile 1ESS switch had shown its reliability.

Most of the cable repeater huts have been sold to private interests, to round out existing parcels, or as possible build-to-suit tower sites, etc. AT&amp;T has been filling the small underground portion before sale, unless they sell to a major company. The junctions for AUTOVON are also being sold into private ownership, with a few exceptions. Most are stripped of all the equipment, although the AUTOVON junction in Mounds, Oklahoma was sold with all the old equipment in place.

==Multilevel precedence and preemption==
The AUTOVON system provided a facility for placing calls with multilevel precedence and preemption (MLPP). If in the public switched telephone network a caller encounters congestion because no circuits are available, the caller typically receives the reorder tone (&quot;fast-busy&quot; signal) and is unable to reach the called party. In military networks such an event was not acceptable, as some calls must always be completed.

AUTOVON included four message precedence levels: &quot;Routine&quot;, &quot;Priority&quot;, &quot;Immediate&quot; and &quot;Flash&quot;, and had an additional capability called &quot;Flash Override&quot;. These levels were activated using the buttons in an additional column of the keypad, which produced the dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signals A, B, C, and D:
*A (697/1633 Hz): Flash Override (FO)
*B (770/1633 Hz): Flash (F)
*C (852/1633 Hz): Immediate (I)
*D (941/1633 Hz): Priority (P)

&quot;Routine&quot; was the level of calls without priority and required no special signaling; the user would only dial the telephone number. Calls with precedence required preceding the telephone number with the desired precedence signal. Calls of increasing precedence could preempt calls of lower priority, giving them a special tone, if need be. For example, if a call was placed with Flash precedence and the route had no available trunks, the switch would preempt a Routine call, and if none in progress, would search for Priority and Immediate type calls. Only when all lines of a switch were already used with Flash or Flash Override precedence would the caller receive a reorder signal.

The authority of a caller to use the precedence levels was granted by complex regulations. Flash Override was not designated as a precedence level, but a &quot;capability&quot; designed to allow the President of the United States or other National Command Authority to preempt any other traffic in the network in an emergency.

The International Telecommunication Union accepted the MLPP specification as recommendation Q.955.3 in March 1993.

==Numbering plan==
AUTOVON used a numbering scheme similar to the North American Numbering Plan. The network had its own three-digit area codes for various geographic regions around the world. Each area code covered several three-digit exchange codes, usually corresponding to the central office telephone switches serving each installation. Thus, almost any telephone on a military base could be direct-dialed via AUTOVON. A selected set of telephones were four-wire AUTOVON phones, wired directly into the AUTOVON network. Others could initiate AUTOVON calls with operator assistance.

Though the numbering plan was similar to the U.S. civilian scheme, the routing structure was a very complex &quot;polygrid&quot; system unlike the civilian office classification scheme, which used a 5-level hierarchical system in which longer-distance traffic, in general, was handled by higher-level switches. It was barely within the information processing capabilities of the Number Five Crossbar switching system which implemented it. The non-hierarchical routing structure was intended to get around any number of nodes destroyed in war. This system inspired similarly survivable ones for message networks, including in future decades the Internet.

Local base switches would be connected to a few AUTOVON trunks, which the user would access by dialing 8 (or in some cases, 88) before the telephone number. To dial locally a user would dial 9, and to dial using commercial long-distance, 1 (where this was supported). The United States Department of Defense (DoD) charged access to AUTOVON according to a complex billing system, and each base budgeted according to local practice.

==Defense Switched Network==

The digitization of and upgrade of AUTOVON began in 1992 and took several years to complete. Equipment is housed in a network of redundant and distributed deep underground facilities spread across the globe, each of which are capable of withstanding multiple direct nuclear attacks of very significant yield. All equipment is housed in such a way that it can absorb multiple blast waves propagating underground while still maintaining continuous operation. The engineering is still impressive by today&#x27;s standards and it is still in use today.

<doc id="171383" wikidata="Q531366" url="?curid=171383" title="Republican Guard (Iraq)">
<text>The Iraqi Republican Guard () was a branch of the Iraqi military from 1969 to 2003, which existed primarily during the presidency of Saddam Hussein. Initially a praetorian guard unit tasked with the sole purpose to protect the president of Iraq, it grew exponentially during the Iran-Iraq War, transforming into an elite force of the Iraqi Armed Forces. It later became known as the &quot;Republican Guard Corps&quot;, and then the &quot;Republican Guard Forces Command&quot; (&quot;RGFC&quot;) with its expansion into two corps. The Republican Guard was disbanded in 2003 after the invasion of Iraq by a U.S.-led international coalition.

The Republican Guard were the elite troops of the Iraqi army directly reporting to Hussein, unlike the paramilitary force Fedayeen Saddam, and the regular Iraqi Army. They were better trained, disciplined, equipped, and had higher salaries than ordinary Iraqi soldiers, receiving bonuses, new cars, and subsidized housing.

==Formation==

Formed in 1969, it was originally created to be a presidential guard. Its primary objective was to maintain the stability of the regime and provide protection against internal and external enemies. During the Iran–Iraq War, it was expanded into a large military force. It was officially dissolved in 2003, as per CPA Order 2 in the wake of the invasion of Iraq by a U.S.-led international coalition.

The force&#x27;s last commander was Qusay Hussein, the younger son of Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein was so confident about the capability of the guard that he had said: &quot;In history when they write about Napoleon&#x27;s Guard, they will arrange them next to the Republican Guard of Iraq.&quot;

Because of their elite status Republican Guards received better equipment and uniforms than their regular Army counterparts, and could often be identified by distinctive markings or items of head dress. Members of the regular Republican Guards conventionally wore a scarlet-colored triangle insignia on both shoulders of their uniforms (sometimes backed with white material to form a white border around the edge of the triangle); they also wore black berets as did some Army personnel, but as a distinctive marking a scarlet ribbon was often sewn to the right of the National cap badge to distinguish bravery in combat and/or loyalty to the Hussein regime. The Special Republican Guards wore a maroon beret with the national eagle device, and a special variation of the triangle shoulder insignia in maroon with green Arabic lettering. The bright red qardoon (shoulder cord) distinguished Republican Guards as well. A similar cord with green and red bands was also worn by the Special Republican Guards.

==Operational history==

===Iran–Iraq War===
Initially, the Guard had limited capabilities; however, during the Iran–Iraq War, it was expanded to five brigades, which was initially mostly used in counterattacks, notably in Operation Dawn-4. By 1986 the war had exhausted Iraq with both Iran and Iraq suffering heavy casualties. Iran had by then captured Al Faw Peninsula and generally pushed Iraqi forces beyond the pre-war border and captured territory inside Iraq, repulsing counterattacks by the Republican Guard. This, coupled with another defeat at the Battle of Mehran, caused the Iraqi Ba&#x27;ath Party to convene the Ba&#x27;ath Extraordinary Congress of July 1986. During this Congress the Ba&#x27;ath Party decided on a new strategy to overhaul the Iraqi military and utilize Iraq&#x27;s manpower capability. This decision allowed for the drafting of thousands of Iraq&#x27;s, who were sent to military summer camps.

With this massive influx of manpower the Republican Guard expanded to somewhere between 28-33 brigades which were led by loyal officers drawn from the Iraqi military. This force then conducted the &quot;Tawakalna ala Allah Operations&quot; which, allowed for the eviction of the Iranians out of occupied Iraqi territory including the liberation of Al-Faw, as well as allowing for renewed major offensives into Iran.

====1980–1988 Order of Battle====
The order of battle according to Iranian sources was as follows:
*1st Mechanized Brigade
*2nd, 10th Armored Brigades
*3rd Special Forces Brigade
*4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 16th, 17th Infantry Brigades (sometimes as mechanized units)
*11th Commando Brigade
There are some claims of units with names that are unknown.

===Persian Gulf War===
Between the invasion of Kuwait and the Persian Gulf War (&quot;Operation Desert Storm&quot;), the number of Republican Guard formations was expanded and the Guard was reorganized. The Republican Guard Forces Command was also created during this period. At the beginning of the Persian Gulf War, it consisted of the following units:
* Republican Guard, 
** 1st Republican Guard Corps, deployed in southern Iraq and northern Kuwait, consisted of:
*** 1st &quot;Hammurabi&quot; Armoured Division, 
*** 2nd &quot;al-Medinah al-Munawera&quot; Armoured Division
*** 3rd &quot;Tawakalna ala-Allah&quot; Mechanised Division
*** 4th &quot;Al Faw&quot; Motorized Infantry Division
** 2nd Republican Guard Corps deployed south of Baghdad consisted of:
*** 5th &quot;Baghdad&quot; Mechanised Division, a square division of four brigades, was able to be split into two small half-divisions
*** 6th &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot; Motorized Infantry Division
*** 7th &quot;Adnan&quot; Motorized Infantry Division

Deployed outside of the corps structure were various other units including:

:* 8th &quot;As Saiqa&quot; Special Forces Division - contained a marine brigade, a parachute brigade, and a special forces brigade. The marine brigade was deployed on Kuwait&#x27;s nine islands, all of which with the exception of Failaka Island are uninhabited. The brigade was headquartered on Bubiyan Island

The Republican Guard also included two Corps Headquarters, the &quot;Allah Akbar&quot; Republican Guard Operations Command, and the &quot;Fat&#x27;h al-Mubayyin&quot; Republican Guard Operations Command, separate artillery detachments and numerous field support units.

Between the invasion of Kuwait and the start of the war on 17 January 1991, four more RGFC internal security divisions had been formed which remained behind in Iraq. All of these units were motorised infantry. The names of only three of them were identified: the &quot;Al-Abed&quot;, &quot;Al-Mustafa&quot; (&#x27;The Elect&#x27;) and &quot;Al-Nida&quot; Divisions (&#x27;The Call&#x27;). They may have conducted operations against Kurdish forces in the north.

===Invasion of Kuwait===

By 1 August 1990, there were more than 100,000 Iraqi troops with up to 700 tanks on the Kuwaiti border.

On 2 August 1990, the Republican Guard units commenced the invasion of Kuwait, which lasted two days. The Kuwait army strength was 16,000, so on paper Iraqi forces outnumbered the Kuwaitis 7 to 1. However, the actual ratio was far worse; the initial attack was so quick, and the Kuwaiti units so unprepared, that many of Kuwait&#x27;s armed forces were on leave and unable to report in time.

The attack was conducted by eight RGFC divisions (two armoured, two mechanized, three motorised infantry and one special forces). The main thrust was conducted from the north down the main Iraq-Kuwait road, later famous as the Highway of Death, by the 1st Hammurabi Armoured Division, with the &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot; Infantry division following; the &quot;Tawakalna&quot; Mechanised and &quot;Al Faw&quot; Infantry Divisions advanced on the flanks. The supporting attack from the west was led by the &quot;Medina&quot; Armoured Division, followed by the &quot;Adnan&quot; Infantry Division and the &quot;Baghdad&quot; Mechanised Division. Commandos deployed by helicopters joined the attack on Kuwait City.

After the invasion, the Republican Guard was withdrawn and redeployed into strategic reserve positions in northern Kuwait and southern and central Iraq.

===Desert Storm===
During the Persian Gulf War, the U.S. VII Corps assembled in full strength and launched an armoured attack into Iraq early Sunday, 24 February 1991, just to the west of Kuwait, taking Iraqi forces by surprise. Prior to the ground offensive, the Iraqi Republican Guard had been attacked relentlessly by US warplanes but managed to shoot down and damage a number of the attackers. On 15 February, the Iraqi Republican Guard shot down two A-10 Warthogs and damaged another, which alarmed USAF General Chuck Horner, who was forced to call off further A-10 attacks on these divisions. Simultaneously, the U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps launched a sweeping &quot;left-hook&quot; attack across the largely undefended desert of southern Iraq, led by the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized). Once the allies had penetrated deep into Iraqi territory, they turned eastward, launching a flank attack against the Republican Guard.

Both sides exchanged fire, but the Republican Guard divisions, worn down by weeks of aerial bombardment, proved unable to withstand the Allied advance. The Republican Guard participated in some of the largest tank battles in US history including the Battle of Medina Ridge, Battle of Norfolk, and the Battle of 73 Easting against the U.S. VII Corps. During the latter battle US veterans later reported coming under heavy small-arms fire with bullets bouncing off their vehicles, having been attacked by several dismounted detachments of the Tawakalna Division. Several rifle companies of the Tawakalna Division counterattacked under the cover of darkness, in an attempt to recover lost positions. The US won with minimal losses while inflicting heavy losses on the Iraqi Army, but elements of the Republican Guard divisions were able to withdraw back into Iraq, shooting down three US warplanes and a rescue helicopter in the process.

In early April 1991, Colonel Montgomery Meigs, the commander of the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Armoured Division, paid his respects to his former enemy&#x27;s Medina Division reporting that, &quot;These guys stayed and fought.&quot; The Medina Division shot down an A-10 Thunderbolt II in the fighting for Medina Ridge on 27 February 1991, and other Republican Guard units were responsible for the destruction of a US Marine Corps Harrier, a USAF F-16 and a US Army UH-60 Blackhawk that day.

===Between the Gulf War and the 2003 Iraq War===
All the eight Republican Guard divisions involved in fighting during the Gulf War and the &quot;Tawakalna&quot; Division were disbanded due to losses. The remaining formations led the suppression of the 1991 uprisings in northern and southern Iraq - the Kurdish insurgency in the north and the Shi&#x27;ite uprising in the east. During these times, there were numerous accusations of the use of poison gas, rape and torture. The Hammurabi and Medina divisions surrounded Karbala with tanks and artillery and shelled the city for one week killing thousands and destroying entire neighborhoods.

Though it was reduced to a strength of seven or eight divisions, the RGFC was reconstituted, taking equipment from Army heavy divisions. Journalist Sean Boyle wrote a number of articles for Jane&#x27;s Intelligence Review, including on the Republican Guard, during the 1990s. In September 1997 he wrote that the Northern Corps had four divisions - Adnan Mechanised Division (Headquarters (HQ) Mosul) with the 11, 12, 21 Brigades; Baghdad Infantry Division (HQ Maqloob Maontin, Mosul Governate) 4, 5, 6 Brigades; Al Madina Al Munawara Armoured Division (Al Rashedia Camp/Al Taji Camp) 2, 10, 14, 17 Brigades; and the Al Abed Infantry Division (Khaled Camp, Kirkuk) with the 38, 39, and 40 Brigades. The Southern Corps had three divisions including the Hammurabi Division.

===2003 U.S. Invasion===
&quot;See article: Iraq War&quot;

The Republican Guard was subordinate to the &quot;Special Security Apparatus of the State&quot; and not to the Ministry of Defence as was the regular Iraqi Army. It was split into two Corps, one for the defense and control of northern Iraq, called &quot;Allah Akbar Operations Command&quot;, composed of infantry and armoured units, and the &quot;Fat&#x27;h al-Mubayyin Operations Command&quot; composed primarily of mechanized units, which was located in the southern part of the country. In 2002, it was reported that the Republican Guard and the Fedayeen Saddam were both training in urban warfare and in guerrilla warfare.

The Republican Guard then consisted of between 50,000 and 60,000 men (although some sources indicate up to 80,000), all volunteers, and some 750 Soviet T-72 and Asad Babil tanks and scores of T-55 and T-62 tanks, along with other mechanized vehicles. A further 90-100 T-72 tanks were operated by the Special Republican Guard. These forces were intentionally away from the capital to avert a possible rebellion against the regime. The members of this body of the army were better paid, equipped, armed and trained. They formed a special corps that were given the ability to buy houses and given other privileges to ensure loyalty to the regime.

Nevertheless, the 2nd Al Medina Armored Division and 6th Nebuchadnezzer Mechanized Division tasked with defending the Karbala Gap fought well, 23 March 2003, disrupting a strong attack conducted by the 11th Aviation Group (&quot;11th Attack Helicopter Regiment&quot;), damaging thirty Apaches and shooting down one and capturing the crew, David Williams and Ronald Young, both chief warrant officers. It was an important Iraqi success for the Apache unit was taken out of the frontline for a month while undergoing repairs. At least 2 Apaches of the helicopter regiment were damaged beyond repair. On 2 April 2003, the Iraqi units positioned around Karbala shot down a U.S. Army Sikorsky H-60 Black Hawk helicopter, killing seven soldiers and wounding four others. Iraqi forces also shot down an FA-18 Hornet near Karbala around 8.45 AM local time.

On 7 April 2003, an Iraqi Special Republican Guard FROG-7 rocket or an Ababil-100 SSM missile exploded among the parked vehicles of the headquarters of 2nd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, killing two soldiers (Private 1st Class Anthony Miller and Staff Sergeant Lincoln Hollinsaid) and two embedded journalists (Julio Parrado and Christian Liebig), wounding 15 others and destroying 17 military vehicles. On 8 April 2003, some 500 Iraqis (including Special Republican Guard) mounted a fierce counterattack across the Jumhuriya Bridge in Baghdad, forcing part of the U.S. forces on the western side of Baghdad to initially abandon their positions, but the Iraqis reportedly lost 50 killed in the fighting that included the use of A-10 Warthogs on the part of the US forces. An A-10 attack plane was shot down in combating the counterattack by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile.

On 2 April 2003, U.S. Army Brigadier General Vincent K. Brooks said that the Baghdad Division of the Iraqi Republican Guard had been &quot;destroyed&quot;. Iraqi information minister Muhammad Saeed al-Sahhaf responded that this was another U.S. &quot;lie&quot;.

The Republican Guard was officially dissolved on 23 May 2003 per Order 2 of the Coalition Provisional Authority under Administrator Paul Bremer.

In early 2004, British journalist Sean Langan confirmed that one of the local commanders of the guerrilla stronghold of Ramadi was a former Republican Guard officer.

In late April 2004, a Pentagon report claimed that members of the Special Republican Guard had regrouped in the guerrilla stronghold of Fallujah.

Many members of the Republican Guard went on to join Sunni insurgent groups currently operating in Iraq such as The Return (al-Awda), Naqshbandi Army (JRTN), Islamic Army in Iraq and the Islamic State.

==In popular culture==

* In the television show &quot;Lost&quot;, one of the main characters - Sayid Jarrah - served in the Republican Guard during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. During his service, he was a soldier, a communications officer and an interrogator. The majority of his background story revolves around the guilt he has felt towards people he&#x27;s tortured in the past.
*The Republican Guard appeared in an episode of &quot;Deadliest Warrior&quot; as Saddam Hussein&#x27;s personal bodyguards and elite troops as they fought against Pol Pot&#x27;s Khmer Rouge.
* The video game, &quot;&quot; series feature soldiers of the Ba&#x27;athist Iraqi Republican Guard as the main enemies.
* The video game &quot;&quot; features the Iraqi Republican Guard as the main enemies in the first episode, &quot;Iraq&quot;.
*In the Tom Clancy video game &quot;Splinter Cell: Conviction&quot;, the Republican Guard is the enemy force in the level &quot;Diwaniya, Iraq&quot;. This level is a flashback to when the series protagonist, Sam Fisher, was captured by the Iraqi Republican Guard on the Highway of Death during the 1991 Gulf War.
*In the 2021 video game &quot;House of Ashes&quot;, one of the main protagonists is a Republican Guard officer in the 2003 war - Lt. Salim Othman (voiced by Nick Tarabay); being the first playable Republican Guard soldier in a video game. Salim takes part in an ambush against US troops (mainly U.S. Marines) alongside his non-playable superior, Captain Dar Basri (voiced by Nabeel El Khafif). Lieutenant Salim is presented as a sympathetic character, while Dar is an unrepenting antagonist of the Americans.

<text>The Republican Guard (, ) is part of the French National Gendarmerie. It is responsible for special security duties in the Paris area and for providing guards of honour at official ceremonies of the French Republic.

Its missions include guarding important public buildings in Paris, such as the Élysée Palace (the residence of the President of the French Republic), the Hôtel Matignon (the residence of the Prime Minister of France), the Luxembourg Palace (the Senate), the Palais Bourbon (the National Assembly) and the Palais de Justice, as well as keeping public order in Paris. Ceremonial and security services for the highest national personalities and important foreign guests, military ceremonies and guards of honour for fallen soldiers, support of other law enforcement forces with intervention teams, as well as staffing horseback patrol stations (particularly for the forests of the Île-de-France region) are also part of its duties.

The close physical protection of the President of the Republic is entrusted to the Security Group for the Presidency of the Republic (GSP), a mixed police–gendarmerie unit that is not part of the Republican Guard. However, the Republican Guard does provide counter-sniper teams (&quot;Tireurs d&#x27;élite Gendarmerie&quot; or TEG) and intervention platoons (&quot;pelotons d&#x27;intervention&quot;). The Republican Guard also represents France at international events at home and abroad.

==History==
The Republican Guard is the heir of the various bodies that preceded it in the course of French and Parisian history and whose task was to honor and protect the high authorities of the State and the capital city – &quot;Gardes Françaises&quot; of the French kings, Consular and Imperial Guard of Napoleon, etc. Its name derives from the Municipal Guard of Paris, established on 12 Vendémiaire XI (October 4, 1802) by Napoleon Bonaparte. This unit distinguished itself in battles of historical significance, including Danzig and Friedland in 1807, Alcolea in 1808 and Burgos in 1812.

In 1813, the Municipal Guard was dissolved following the attempted coup of General Malet and replaced by the Imperial Gendarmerie of Paris and then, under the Restoration, the Royal Guard of Paris and the Royal Mounted Police of Paris. In 1830, it was recreated, but after the Revolution of 1848, it was removed in favor of the Civic Guard (which proved to be a transient institution).

In June 1848, under the Second Republic, the Republican Guard of Paris was created, including an infantry regiment and a regiment of cavalry. On February 1, 1849, president Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte made the Guard a part of the National Gendarmerie. It received its insignia on July 14, 1880.

The Republican Guard did not take part in World War I as a unit, but more than one third of its personnel were seconded to Army regiments for the duration of the conflict. As a consequence, its flag and banner are decorated with the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Legion of Honour. During World War II, it reported to the police headquarters and took the name of Guard of Paris. Part of its staff rallied to General de Gaulle, and the Guard was involved in fighting alongside the FFI during the liberation of Paris.

From 1947 to 1954, the Republican Guard took part in the Indochina War by sending three &quot;Legions of March&quot;, which were mainly assigned to the training of allied indigenous troops and to the defense of certain places. The three legions, comprising a constant workforce of nearly 3,000 men, suffered heavy losses (more than 600 dead and 1,500 wounded during the conflict), which earned it the Croix de Guerre TOE. In 1954, the Republican Guard was renamed as the Mobile Gendarmerie and the Republican Guard of Paris became the Republican Guard. Both organizations were then and still remain part of the same branch in the French Gendarmerie. 

In 1978, President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing gave the Guard it new insignias on 11 November 1979 when the infantry regiment was split into the current two separate regiments. Michèle Alliot-Marie, Minister of Defence, said in October 2002: &quot;The Republican Guard has a popularity that transcends borders&quot;, and it contributes &quot;to the splendour of the French military and France.&quot;

== Missions ==

=== Ceremonial duties ===

These ceremonial functions are performed mainly by the first infantry regiment, the cavalry regiment and occasionally by the second infantry regiment.

Detachments from the cavalry regiment reinforce the two infantry regiments in carrying out ceremonial and security duties in and around state buildings. These include the lining of both sides of the entry stairs of the Elysée or Matignon Palaces (and other buildings) by dismounted cavalry on special occasions. These Republican Guards belong to the Cavalry Regiment and not to the infantry units whose mission is to ensure the security of these palaces and of senior government figures. Certain ceremonial duties in the form of honour guards are performed during state visits to the Paris museums or the Opera, as well as during other ceremonies (for example at the French Academy).

=== Security missions ===
Although the ceremonial duties attract more public attention, more than 80% of the missions assigned to the Garde are security missions. These include missions performed for the state such as protection of state buildings but also missions performed for the benefit of the population (for example patrols in the parks and streets).
=== Other missions ===

Some guards are assigned to more specific missions:
* Security of diplomatic bags entering and leaving the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the airports.
* Safety of sport events such as the Tour de France cyclist race by the motorcycle squadron.
* Reinforcement and support to the Departmental Gendarmerie
* Assistance and coopereration in foreign countries and especially in former French colonies.

==Organization==
The Republican Guard belongs to the French National Gendarmerie. It is made up of approximately 2,800 men and women (drawn from an overall body of 100,000 gendarmes). As a historically Parisian organization, the guards wear the armorial bearings of the city on their uniforms.

It consists of two infantry regiments (one includes a motorcycle squadron) and a horse cavalry regiment. It also has four musical formations, as well as display teams demonstrating prowess in horseback or motorcycle maneuvers. The Guard is commanded by a &quot;general de division&quot; (major general). It is headquartered in the &quot;Quartier des Célestins&quot;, Paris, built in 1895–1901, designed by the renowned French architect Jacques Hermant.

=== Cavalry regiment ===


Headquartered in the Quartier des Célestins, and Quartier Carnot barracks the cavalry regiment is made up of approximately 480 gendarmes and civilians of whom a little more than 10% are women. It has approximately 550 horses (11% mares) and remains the last mounted regiment in the French armed forces.

The regiment is composed of:
* Three squadrons of cavalry (the first is based at Quartier des Célestins, in Paris, and two others based at Quartier Carnot, also in Paris at the fringe of Bois de Vincennes),
* Reserve squadron 
* A squadron &quot;hors rang&quot; (based at Les Célestins) and composed of:
** mounted band
** horse-shoeing (farriers),
** veterinary service.
* The training centre (centre d&#x27;instruction) at Quartier Goupil Saint-Germain-en-Laye
* Hunting Horns Platoon (&quot;Trompes de Chasse de la Garde&quot;)

This unit has a section of high level sportsmen, in particular Hubert Perring, dressage champion of France in 2005, and member of the French team for the World Equestrian Games of 2006.

The Guard Cavalry Regiment is twinned with the British Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, the Italian Carabinieri Cavalry Regiment and the Senegalese Red Guard.

==== Special displays of the cavalry regiment ====
Exhibition drill squads present five shows and reenactments:
*le carrousel des lances (the lancer&#x27;s carrousel);
*la maison du Roy (the King&#x27;s household cavalry);
*la reprise des tandems (the tandem riders);
*la reprise des douze (demonstration/lesson with 12 riders);
*l’équipe de démonstration de sécurité publique (modern mounted police demonstration)

=== Infantry regiments ===

The Republican Guard has two regiments of infantry:

* The first infantry regiment is composed of :
** Regimental HQ
** The Republican Guard Band and Bugles (military band and fanfare battery unit)
** Motorcycle squadron
** &quot;Compagnie de sécurité de la Présidence de la république&quot; (presidential palace security company)
** Three &quot;compagnies de sécurité et d&#x27;honneur&quot; (security and honor companies)
* the second infantry regiment is composed of :
** Regimental HQ
** &quot;Compagnie de sécurité de l&#x27;Hôtel Matignon&quot; (prime minister security company)
** &quot;Compagnie de sécurité des palais nationaux&quot; (CSPN) (national palaces security company; i.e., national assembly and senate)
** Four &quot;compagnies de sécurité et d&#x27;honneur&quot; (CSH)
** Auxiliary platoon

Each of the seven security and honor companies is composed of three regular sections (i.e., platoons) and one peloton d&#x27;intervention (intervention platoon). The regular sections perform ceremonial duties and guards. The intervention platoons provide special security in the government buildings and palaces protected by the Guard. They are also tasked with police missions in support of the Gendarmerie in the Paris area (home arrests, escorts etc.). One of the seven intervention platoons is permanently deployed on a rotational basis to either French Guiana in support of forces combating illegal gold mining or to another French oversea territory (typically Guadeloupe or Saint Martin).

==== Special displays of the infantry regiments ====
* Bayonet drill team (quadrille des baïllonnettes; 1st régiment)
* The battery fanfare band
* The Napoleonic Drumline, made up of drummers wearing uniforms of the Napoleonic Wars 
* Emperor&#x27;s grenadiers company, serving as a reenacting unit (2nd régiment)
* Motorcycle display teams

=== Band and Orchestra of the Republican Guard ===

Depending on needs, the orchestra performs in three configurations:

* the concert band (80 musicians)
* the string orchestra (40 musicians), likely to be presented in configurations of 24 or 12 bows, or in string quartets
* Symphony orchestra (80 musicians)

It was founded in 1848 by Jean-Georges Paulus.

=== Armed Forces Choir ===

This men&#x27;s choir is composed of 46 professional singers. In spite of its name (Choir of the French army), it is part of the Guard and thus reports to the Gendarmerie and through the Ministers of the Armed Forces and Interior (owing to the military character of the service). The choir performs mainly during official ceremonies and commemorations but also during festivals and sport events of national and international importance. Since 2007, it has been led by a woman, Major Aurore Tillac, who serves as choir master and director.

<doc id="171390" wikidata="Q238622" url="?curid=171390" title="Control (Janet Jackson song)">
<text>&quot;Control&quot; is a song by American singer Janet Jackson from her third studio album of the same name (1986). The song was written by Jackson, James Harris III and Terry Lewis, and produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. It was released as the album&#x27;s fourth single on October 17, 1986, by A&amp;M Records. Its arrangement, built upon complex rhythmic tracks, showcased state-of-the-art production. The song is about Jackson wanting to finally take control of her life.

In 1988, the song won a Soul Train Music Award for Best R&amp;B/Soul or Rap Music Video, beating out her brother Michael, Whitney Houston, and Jody Watley. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; included the song in its Best 200 Songs of the &#x27;80s list at number 126.

Jackson has performed the song on many of her tours, including the Rhythm Nation World Tour 1990, The Velvet Rope Tour, All for You Tour, Rock Witchu Tour, Number Ones: Up Close and Personal, Unbreakable World Tour, and the State of the World Tour. The only tour that it was not included on was the Janet World Tour. It has been included in two of Jackson&#x27;s greatest hits albums, &quot;Design of a Decade: 1986–1996&quot; (1995) and &quot;Number Ones&quot; (2009).

==Commercial performance==
Released in 1986, the single peaked at number five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming Jackson&#x27;s fourth consecutive top-five single on the chart; it also peaked at number one on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Dance Club Play charts. It was the 37th biggest Hot 100 single of 1987, the fifth biggest Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs single of 1987, and the ninth biggest-selling 12-inch single of 1987. In the UK it missed the top 40, peaking at number 42.

==Music video==

The music video for &quot;Control&quot; was directed by Mary Lambert, who had previously directed the video for &quot;Nasty&quot;. The video shows Jackson playing a young singer preparing for her first gig, only to end up arguing with her parents because she wants to move out of the family home and live on her own. Her father is deadset against her plan. When he tells her they will not discuss the subject any further, she angrily storms out of the house, saying she will drive herself to the concert instead of taking the limo that has been provided for her. Just as she is about to leave for the concert, she is greeted in the driveway by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Jellybean Johnson, and Jerome Benton. They take her to a concert hall to perform her single &quot;Control&quot; where she shows that she wants to be &quot;the one in control&quot;. The video version of the song is different from the album version. The nine-minute video was made available on the iTunes Store on April 27, 2007. Ja&#x27;net Dubois, who co-starred on &quot;Good Times&quot; with Jackson in the 1970s, plays her mother in the video. Paula Abdul choreographed the video.

The live footage was recorded at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles. Both Lambert and producer Sharon Oreck recall it as a difficult and trying experience; Oreck said in 2011 that it was her &quot;worst nightmare&quot; of the many videos she had produced. The crowd, which had been told that they would see Janet Jackson perform, had expected a free concert. &quot;Instead we gave them 50 takes of Janet lip-synching &#x27;Control&#x27;&quot;, said Oreck.

At the time, Janet was in the midst of firing her father, Joe Jackson, from his position as her manager. Oreck said he was bitter and taking it out on everybody else. He told Oreck that he would not let Janet sit on the trapeze she is seen being lowered onto the stage in unless there was $1 million of liability insurance coverage on her. She told the record company, which responded, &quot;Don&#x27;t tell him anything, but don&#x27;t tell him no, because we don&#x27;t say no to Joe Jackson.&quot; This evasiveness did not work, and he became even angrier and threatened her with violence. Finally, Lambert told A&amp;M she and Oreck would quit the video unless they told Joe Jackson his daughter was insured.

The situation got worse later in the shoot. A&amp;M told Lambert they wanted more white people visible in the audience. There were a few scattered throughout, and under the guise of simple repositioning she began having them sit further forward. Eventually the crowd as a whole figured out what was really happening, and grew angry. Lambert told the record company representative that she absolutely could not go on due to the potential for violence, and he went out and explained things to the crowd, which calmed down enough to complete the video.

==Live performances==
Jackson has performed the song on many of her tours, excluding the Janet World Tour. It opened her first concert tour Rhythm Nation 1814 Tour in 1990. It began with Jackson rising out of the floor perched upon a steel lift that resembled an oil rig. As she rose through the fog, she started singing the song. The song was performed during a &quot;frenzied&quot; medley of &quot;Control&quot; &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot;, &quot;Nasty&quot; and &quot;Throb&quot; on The Velvet Rope Tour in 1998. The medley at the October 11, 1998, show at the Madison Square Garden in New York City was broadcast during a special titled &quot;The Velvet Rope: Live in Madison Square Garden&quot; by HBO. It was also added to the setlist at its DVD release, &quot;The Velvet Rope Tour: Live in Concert&quot; in 1999. During the All for You Tour (2001–2002), &quot;What Have You Done for Me Lately&quot; was performed in a re-worked version, during a medley with &quot;Control&quot; and &quot;Nasty&quot;. According to Denise Sheppard from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, it was &quot;another crowd favorite; perhaps best dubbed as the &quot;bitter&quot; portion of the night&quot;, also adding that &quot;this performer - who has been performing onstage for twenty-eight years - knows what the crowd comes for and gives it to them in spades&quot;. The February 16, 2002 final date of the tour at the Aloha Stadium in Hawaii, was broadcast by HBO, and included a performance of it. This rendition was also added to the setlist at its DVD release, &quot;&quot;, in 2002.

On December 4, 2006, Jackson opened the &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards with a medley of past singles &quot;Control&quot; and &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot; and new single &quot;So Excited&quot;, accompanied by black and red-clad dancers. 
For her first tour in seven years, the Rock Witchu Tour in 2008, she chose to open the show a medley with &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot;, &quot;Control&quot; and &quot;What Have You Done for Me Lately&quot;. After an interlude, Jackson made her entrance amid fireworks and theatrical smoke to perform the medley, while donning a Mohawk hairstyle. While promoting her second greatest hits album &quot;Number Ones&quot;, the singer performed an eight-minute medley of six songs during the American Music Awards of 2009. It included &quot;Control&quot;, &quot;Miss You Much&quot;, &quot;What Have You Done for Me Lately&quot;, &quot;If&quot;, &quot;Make Me&quot;, and finished with &quot;Together Again&quot;. She also included the song on the Number Ones: Up Close and Personal tour (2011), the Unbreakable World Tour (2015–2016), and the State of the World Tour (2017–2019). Jackson included the song at her 2019 Las Vegas residence Janet Jackson: Metamorphosis. It was also included on her special concert series Janet Jackson: A Special 30th Anniversary Celebration of Rhythm Nation in 2019. In 2023 Jackson performed the song on her Janet Jackson: Together Again tour.

==Legacy==
The spoken intro of &quot;Control&quot; was sampled on Kylie Minogue&#x27;s song &quot;Too Much of a Good Thing&quot;, from her 1991 album &quot;Let&#x27;s Get to It&quot;. In 2010, the song was included in the &quot;Dance Central&quot; DLC setlist to be played using Kinect for the Xbox 360. &quot;Glee&quot; covered the song in the episode &quot;Hold On to Sixteen&quot;, where the New Directions sang three songs originated by members of the Jackson family. Dianna Agron (as Quinn Fabray) opens the song with its spoken introduction, with leads sung by Darren Criss (as Blaine Anderson) and Kevin McHale (as Artie Abrams). The song is included on the soundtrack album &quot;&quot;. The song is also used in the opening of the 2019 film &quot;Hustlers&quot;.

The song is also listed in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s list of 500 songs that shaped rock and roll.

The Second Chechen War is also known as the Second Chechen Campaign () or the Second Russian Invasion of Chechnya from the Chechen insurgents&#x27; point of view.

==Historical basis of the conflict==
===Russian Empire===


Chechnya is an area in the Northern Caucasus which has constantly fought against foreign rule, including the Ottoman Turks in the 15th century. The Russian Terek Cossack Host was established in lowland Chechnya in 1577 by free Cossacks who were resettled from the Volga to the Terek River. In 1783, the Russian Empire and the Georgian Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti signed the Treaty of Georgievsk, under which Kartli-Kakheti became a Russian protectorate. To secure communications with Georgia and other regions of the Transcaucasia, the Russian Empire began spreading its influence into the Caucasus region, starting the Caucasus War in 1817. Russian forces first moved into highland Chechnya in 1830, and the conflict in the area lasted until 1859, when a 250,000-strong army under General Aleksandr Baryatinsky broke down the highlanders&#x27; resistance. Frequent uprisings in the Caucasus also occurred during the Russo–Turkish War of 1877–78.

===Soviet Union===
Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Chechens established a short-lived Caucasian Imamate which included parts of Chechnya, Dagestan and Ingushetia; there was also the secular pan-Caucasian Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus. Most of the resistance was defeated by Bolshevik troops by 1922. Then, months before the creation of the Soviet Union, the Chechen Autonomous Oblast of the Russian SFSR was established. It annexed a part of territory of the former Terek Cossack Host. Chechnya and neighboring Ingushetia formed the Checheno–Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1936. In 1941, during World War II, a small-scale Chechen revolt broke out, led by Hasan Israilov. In 1944, the entire Chechen people were deported to the Kazakh SSR and Kirghiz SSR in an act of ethnic cleansing; this was done under the false pretext of Chechen mass collaboration with Nazi Germany. An estimated 1/4 to 1/3 of the Chechen population perished due the harsh conditions. Many scholars recognize the deportation as an act of genocide, as did the European Parliament in 2004. In 1992 the separatist government built a memorial dedicated to the victims of the acts of 1944. The pro-Russian government would later demolish this memorial. Tombstones which were an integral part of the memorial were found planted on the Akhmad Kadyrov Square next to granite steles honoring the losses of the local pro-Russian power.

===First Chechen War===

During the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, there was an anti-Soviet revolution in Chechnya, which ultimately led to Chechnya declaring independence. In 1992, Chechen and Ingush leaders signed an agreement splitting the joint Checheno–Ingush republic in two, with Ingushetia joining the Russian Federation and Chechnya remaining independent. The tension between Chechnya and Russia over independence ultimately led to Russian intervention in the republic, in which the Russians covertly tried to oust the government of Dzhokhar Dudayev. The First Chechen War began in 1994, when Russian forces entered Chechnya on the premise of restoring constitutional order. Following nearly two years of brutal fighting, with a death toll exceeding 100,000 by some estimates, the 1996 Khasavyurt ceasefire agreement was signed and Russian troops were withdrawn from the republic.

==Prelude to the Second Chechen War==

===Instability in Chechnya===


The authority of the government in Grozny was opposed by extremist warlords like Arbi Barayev, who according to some sources was in cooperation with the FSB. Kidnapping in Chechnya reached large proportions, and the total turnover reached tens of millions of dollars. In 1998, a group of four Western hostages was murdered. Russian special services were accused of being involved in kidnappings. In 1998, a state of emergency was declared by the authorities in Grozny. In July 1998 a confrontation occurred in Gudermes between Chechen National Guard troops and a fundamentalist faction leading to many casualties.

Some scholars linked Chechen resistance to Russia to the Al-Qaeda global jihad movement. According to Gordon Hahn, the connections between the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria and Al-Qaeda &quot;were common knowledge by the late 1990s among U.S. government officials, intelligence analysts, and terrorism experts&quot; and there were about five hundred foreign jihad fighters in Chechnya at the start of the second war. Most Western observers prior to 11 September regarded the alleged al-Qaida links claimed by Russian government with skepticism. The Clinton and Bush administrations, as well as other NATO governments, uniformly dismissed Moscow&#x27;s rhetoric concerning the existence of Chechens in Afghanistan and Afghans in Chechnya as Soviet-style &quot;agitprop&quot; (agitation-propaganda) until 11 September occurred.

===Russian–Chechen relations (1996–1999)===
Political tensions were fueled in part by allegedly Chechen or pro-Chechen terrorist and criminal activity in Russia, as well as by border clashes. On 16 November 1996, in Kaspiysk (Dagestan), a bomb destroyed an apartment building housing Russian border guards, killing 68 people. The cause of the blast was never determined, but many in Russia blamed Chechen separatists. Three people died on 23 April 1997, when a bomb exploded in the Russian railway station of Armavir (Krasnodar Krai), and two on 28 May 1997, when another bomb exploded in the Russian railway station of Pyatigorsk (Stavropol Krai). On 22 December 1997, forces of Dagestani militants and Chechnya-based Arab warlord Ibn al-Khattab raided the base of the 136th Motor Rifle Brigade of the Russian Army in Buynaksk, Dagestan, inflicting heavy casualties.

The 1997 election brought to power the separatist president Aslan Maskhadov. In 1998 and 1999, President Maskhadov survived several assassination attempts, blamed on the Russian intelligence services. In March 1999, General Gennady Shpigun, the Kremlin&#x27;s envoy to Chechnya, was kidnapped at the airport in Grozny and ultimately found dead in 2000 during the war. On 7 March 1999, in response to the abduction of General Shpigun, Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin called for an invasion of Chechnya. However, Stepashin&#x27;s plan was overridden by the prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov. Stepashin later said:

 According to Robert Bruce Ware, these plans should be regarded as contingency plans. However, Stepashin did actively call for a military campaign against Chechen separatists in August 1999 when he was the prime minister of Russia. But shortly after his televised interview where he talked about plans to restore constitutional order in Chechnya, he was replaced in the PM&#x27;s position by Vladimir Putin.

In late May 1999, Russia announced that it was closing the Russian-Chechnya border in an attempt to combat attacks and criminal activity; border guards were ordered to shoot suspects on sight. On 18 June 1999, seven servicemen were killed when Russian border guard posts were attacked in Dagestan. On 29 July 1999, the Russian Interior Ministry troops destroyed a Chechen border post near the city of Kizlyar and marched several kilometers into Chechnya. On 22 August 1999, 10 Russian policemen were killed by an anti-tank mine blast in North Ossetia, and, on 9 August 1999, six servicemen were kidnapped in the Ossetian capital Vladikavkaz.

===Dagestan===
On 7 August 1999, Shamil Basayev together with Ibn al-Khattab, led two groups of up to 2,000 Chechen, Dagestani, Arab mujahideen from Chechnya into the neighboring Republic of Dagestan. This war saw the first (unconfirmed) use by Russia of aerial-delivered fuel air explosives (FAE) in mountainous areas, notably in the village of Tando. By mid-September 1999, the militants were routed from the villages they had captured and retreated back into Chechnya. According to Russia several hundred militants were killed in the fighting and the Russian side reported 275 servicemen killed and approximately 900 wounded.

===Russian apartment bombings===
Before the wake of the Dagestani campaign had settled, a series of bombings took place in Russia (in Moscow, Volgodonsk and Buynaksk). On 4 September 1999, 62 people died in an apartment building housing members of families of Russian soldiers. Over the next two weeks, the bombs targeted three other apartment buildings and a mall; in total over 350 people were killed. The then Prime Minister Putin quickly blamed the attacks on Chechen militants and despite no evidence linking the bombings to Chechens; ordered the bombing campaign of Chechnya. In February 2000, the US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stated they had not seen any evidence that tied the bombings to Chechnya. 

On 22 September 1999, Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) agents were caught by local police planting a bomb at an apartment complex in Ryazan. They were later released on orders from Moscow. FSB chief Nikolai Patrushev announced on television that the apparent bomb had been part of a “training exercise”. 

A Russian criminal investigation of the bombings was completed in 2002. The results of the investigation, and the court ruling that followed, concluded that they were organized by Achemez Gochiyaev, who remains at large, and ordered by Khattab and Abu Omar al-Saif (both of whom were later killed), in retaliation for the Russian counteroffensive against their incursion into Dagestan. Six other suspects have been convicted by Russian courts. 

Many observers, including State Duma deputies Yuri Shchekochikhin, Sergei Kovalev and Sergei Yushenkov, cast doubts on the official version and sought an independent investigation. Some others, including David Satter, Yury Felshtinsky, Vladimir Pribylovsky and Alexander Litvinenko, as well as the secessionist Chechen authorities, claimed that the 1999 bombings were a false flag attack coordinated by the FSB in order to win public support for a new full-scale war in Chechnya, which boosted the popularity of Prime Minister and former FSB Director Vladimir Putin, brought the pro-war Unity Party to the State Duma in the 1999 parliamentary election, and secured Putin as president within a few months. A description of the bombings as FSB false-flag operations appears in the book &quot;Blowing Up Russia&quot;, which is banned in the Russian Federation.

==1999–2000 Russian offensive==
===Air war===
In late August and early September 1999, Russia mounted a massive aerial campaign over Chechnya, with the stated aim of wiping out militants who invaded Dagestan earlier in the same month. On 26 August 1999, Russia acknowledged bombing raids in Chechnya. The Russian air strikes were reported to have forced at least 100,000 Chechens to flee their homes to safety; the neighbouring region of Ingushetia was reported to have appealed for United Nations aid to deal with tens of thousands of refugees. On 2 October 1999, Russia&#x27;s Ministry of Emergency Situations reported that 78,000 people had fled the air strikes in Chechnya; most of them went to Ingushetia, where they arrived at a rate of 5,000 to 6,000 a day.

As of 22 September 1999, Deputy Interior Minister Igor Zubov said that Russian troops had surrounded Chechnya and were prepared to retake the region, but the military planners were advising against a ground invasion because of the likelihood of heavy Russian casualties.

===Land war===
The Chechen conflict entered a new phase on 1 October 1999, when Russia&#x27;s new Prime Minister Vladimir Putin declared the authority of Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov and his parliament illegitimate. At this time, Putin announced that Russian troops would initiate a land war but progress only as far as the Terek River, which cuts the northern third of Chechnya off from the rest of the republic. Putin&#x27;s stated intention was to take control of Chechnya&#x27;s northern plain and establish a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; against further Chechen aggression; he later recalled that the cordon alone was &quot;pointless and technically impossible,&quot; apparently because of Chechnya&#x27;s rugged terrain. According to Russian accounts, Putin accelerated a plan for a major crackdown against Chechnya that had been drawn up months earlier.

The Russian army moved with ease in the wide open spaces of northern Chechnya and reached the Terek River on 5 October 1999. On this day, a bus filled with refugees was reportedly hit by a Russian tank shell, killing at least 11 civilians; two days later, Russian Su-24 fighter bombers dropped cluster bombs on the village of Elistanzhi, killing some 35 people. On 10 October 1999, Maskhadov outlined a peace plan offering a crackdown on renegade warlords; the offer was rejected by the Russian side. He also appealed to NATO to help end fighting between his forces and Russian troops, without effect.

On 12 October 1999, the Russian forces crossed the Terek and began a two-pronged advance on the capital Grozny to the south. Hoping to avoid the significant casualties that plagued the first Chechen War, the Russians advanced slowly and in force, making extensive use of artillery and air power in an attempt to soften Chechen defences. Many thousands of civilians fled the Russian advance, leaving Chechnya for neighbouring Russian republics. Their numbers were later estimated to reach 200,000 to 350,000, out of the approximately 800,000 residents of the Chechen Republic. The Russians appeared to be taking no chances with the Chechen population in its rear areas, setting up &quot;filtration camps&quot; in October in northern Chechnya for detaining suspected members of &quot;bandformirovaniya&quot; militant formations (literally: &quot;bandit formations&quot;). 

On 15 October 1999, Russian forces took control of a strategic ridge within artillery range of the Chechen capital Grozny after mounting an intense tank and artillery barrage against Chechen fighters. In response, President Maskhadov declared a &quot;gazavat&quot; (holy war) to confront the approaching Russian army. Martial law was declared in Ichkeria and reservists were called, but no martial law or state of emergency had been declared in Chechnya or Russia by the Russian government. The next day, Russian forces captured the strategic Tersky Heights, within sight of Grozny, dislodging 200 entrenched Chechen fighters. After heavy fighting, Russia seized the Chechen base in the village of Goragorsky, west of the city.

On 21 October 1999, a Russian Scud short-range ballistic missile strike on the central Grozny marketplace killed more than 140 people, including many women and children, and left hundreds more wounded. A Russian spokesman said the busy market was targeted because it was used by separatists as an arms bazaar. Eight days later, Russian aircraft carried out a rocket attack on a large convoy of refugees heading into Ingushetia, killing at least 25 civilians including Red Cross workers and journalists. Two days later Russian forces conducted a heavy artillery and rocket attack on Samashki; some claimed that civilians were killed in Samashki in revenge for the heavy casualties suffered there by Russian forces during the first war.

On 12 November 1999, the Russian flag was raised over Chechnya&#x27;s second largest city, Gudermes, when the local Chechen commanders, the Yamadayev brothers, defected to the federal side; the Russians also entered the bombed-out former Cossack village of Assinovskaya. The fighting in and around Kulary continued until January 2000. On 17 November 1999, Russian soldiers dislodged separatists in Bamut, the symbolic separatist stronghold in the first war; dozens of Chechen fighters and many civilians were reported killed, and the village was levelled in the FAE bombing. Two days later, after a failed attempt five days earlier, Russian forces managed to capture the village of Achkhoy-Martan.

On 26 November 1999, Deputy Army Chief of Staff Valery Manilov said that phase two of the Chechnya campaign was just about complete, and a final third phase was about to begin. According to Manilov, the aim of the third phase was to destroy &quot;bandit groups&quot; in the mountains. A few days later Russia&#x27;s Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Russian forces might need up to three more months to complete their military campaign in Chechnya, while some generals said the offensive could be over by New Year&#x27;s Day. The next day the Chechens briefly recaptured the town of Novogroznensky.

On 1 December 1999, after weeks of heavy fighting, Russian forces under Major General Vladimir Shamanov took control of Alkhan-Yurt, a village just south of Grozny. The Chechen and foreign fighters inflicted heavy losses on the Russian forces, reportedly killing more than 70 Russian soldiers before retreating, suffering heavy losses of their own. On the same day, Chechen separatist forces began carrying out a series of counter-attacks against federal troops in several villages as well as in the outskirts of Gudermes. Chechen fighters in Argun, a small town five kilometres east of Grozny, put up some of the strongest resistance to federal troops since the start of Moscow&#x27;s military offensive. The separatists in the town of Urus-Martan also offered fierce resistance, employing guerilla tactics Russia had been anxious to avoid; by 9 December 1999, Russian forces were still bombarding Urus-Martan, although Chechen commanders said their fighters had already pulled out.

On 4 December 1999, the commander of Russian forces in the North Caucasus, General Viktor Kazantsev, claimed that Grozny was fully blockaded by Russian troops. The Russian military&#x27;s next task was the seizure of the town of Shali, 20 kilometres south-east of the capital, one of the last remaining separatist-held towns apart from Grozny. Russian troops started by capturing two bridges that link Shali to the capital, and by 11 December 1999, Russian troops had encircled Shali and were slowly forcing separatists out. By mid-December the Russian military was concentrating attacks in southern parts of Chechnya and preparing to launch another offensive from Dagestan.

===Siege of Grozny===
The Russian assault on Grozny began in early December, accompanied by a struggle for neighbouring settlements. The battle ended when the Russian army seized the city on 2 February 2000. According to official Russian figures, at least 134 federal troops and an unknown number of pro-Russian militiamen died in Grozny. The separatist forces also suffered heavy losses, including losing several top commanders. Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said that 1,500 separatists were killed trying to leave Grozny. The separatists said they lost at least 500 fighters in the mine field at Alkhan-Kala. The siege and fighting devastated the capital like no other European city since World War II. In 2003, the United Nations called Grozny the most destroyed city on Earth. The Russians also suffered heavy losses as they advanced elsewhere, and from Chechen counterattacks and convoy ambushes. On 26 January 2000, the Russian government announced that 1,173 servicemen had been killed in Chechnya since October, more than double the 544 killed reported just 19 days earlier.

===Battle for the mountains===
Heavy fighting accompanied by massive shelling and bombing continued through the winter of 2000 in the mountainous south of Chechnya, particularly in the areas around Argun, Vedeno and Shatoy, where fighting involving Russian paratroopers had raged since 1999.

On 9 February 2000, a Russian tactical missile hit a crowd of people who had come to the local administration building in Shali, a town previously declared as one of the &quot;safe areas&quot;, to collect their pensions. The attack was a response to a report that a group of fighters had entered the town. The missile is estimated to have killed some 150 civilians, and was followed by an attack by combat helicopters causing further casualties. Human Rights Watch called on the Russian military to stop using FAE, known in Russia as &quot;vacuum bombs&quot;, in Chechnya, concerned about the large number of civilian casualties caused by what it called &quot;widespread and often indiscriminate bombing and shelling by Russian forces&quot;. On 18 February 2000, a Russian army transport helicopter was shot down in the south, killing 15 men aboard, Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo announced.

On 29 February 2000, United Army Group commander Gennady Troshev said that &quot;the counter-terrorism operation in Chechnya is over. It will take a couple of weeks longer to pick up splinter groups now.&quot; Russia&#x27;s Defense Minister, Marshal of the Russian Federation Igor Sergeyev, evaluated the numerical strength of the separatists at between 2,000 and 2,500 men, &quot;scattered all over Chechnya.&quot; On the same day, a Russian VDV paratroop company from Pskov was attacked by Chechen and Arab fighters near the village of Ulus-Kert in Chechnya&#x27;s southern lowlands; at least 84 Russian soldiers were killed in the especially heavy fighting. The official newspaper of the Russian Ministry of Defense reported that at least 659 separatists were killed, including 200 from the Middle East, figures which they said were based on radio-intercept data, intelligence reports, eyewitnesses, local residents and captured Chechens. On 2 March 2000, an OMON unit from Podolsk opened fire on a unit from Sergiyev Posad in Grozny; at least 24 Russian servicemen were killed in the incident.

In March a large group of more than 1,000 Chechen fighters, led by field commander Ruslan Gelayev, pursued since their withdrawal from Grozny, entered the village of Komsomolskoye in the Chechen foothills and held off a full-scale Russian attack on the town for over two weeks; they suffered hundreds of casualties, while the Russians admitted to more than 50 killed. On 29 March 2000, about 23 Russian soldiers were killed in a separatist ambush on an OMON convoy from Perm in Zhani-Vedeno.

On 23 April 2000, a 22-vehicle convoy carrying ammunition and other supplies to an airborne unit was ambushed near Serzhen-Yurt in the Vedeno Gorge by an estimated 80 to 100 &quot;bandits&quot;, according to General Troshev. In the ensuing four-hour battle the federal side lost 15 government soldiers, according to the Russian defence minister. General Troshev told the press that the bodies of four separatist fighters were found. The Russian Airborne Troops headquarters later stated that 20 separatists were killed and two taken prisoner. Soon, the Russian forces seized the last populated centres of the organized resistance. (Another offensive against the remaining mountain strongholds was launched by Russian forces in December 2000.)

===Restoration of federal government===
In May 2000 the following month, Putin appointed Akhmad Kadyrov interim head of the pro-Moscow government. This development met with early approval in the rest of Russia, but the continued deaths of Russian troops dampened public enthusiasm. On 23 March 2003, a new Chechen constitution was passed in a referendum. The 2003 Constitution granted the Chechen Republic a significant degree of autonomy, but still tied it firmly to Russia and Moscow&#x27;s rule, and went into force on 2 April 2003. The referendum was strongly supported by the Russian government but met a harsh critical response from Chechen separatists; many citizens chose to boycott the ballot. Akhmad Kadyrov was assassinated by a bomb blast in 2004. Since December 2005, his son Ramzan Kadyrov, leader of the pro-Moscow militia known as &quot;kadyrovtsy&quot;, has been functioning as the Chechnya&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; ruler. Kadyrov has become Chechnya&#x27;s most powerful leader and, in February 2007, with support from Putin, Ramzan Kadyrov replaced Alu Alkhanov as president.

==Insurgency==
===Guerrilla war in Chechnya===

:&quot;Guerrilla phase by year: 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009&quot;

Although large-scale fighting within Chechnya had ceased, daily attacks continued, particularly in the southern portions of Chechnya and spilling into nearby territories of the Caucasus, especially after the Caucasus Front was established. Typically small separatist units targeted Russian and pro-Russian officials, security forces, and military and police convoys and vehicles. The separatist units employed IEDs and sometimes combined for larger raids. Russian forces retaliated with artillery and air strikes, as well as counter-insurgency operations. Most soldiers in Chechnya were &quot;kontraktniki&quot; (contract soldiers) as opposed to the earlier conscripts. While Russia continued to maintain a military presence within Chechnya, federal forces played less of a direct role. Pro-Kremlin Chechen forces under the command of the local strongman Ramzan Kadyrov, known as the &quot;kadyrovtsy&quot;, dominated law enforcement and security operations, with many members (including Kadyrov himself) being former Chechen separatists who had defected since 1999. Since 2004, the Kadyrovtsy were partly incorporated into two Interior Ministry units, &quot;North&quot; and &quot;South&quot; (&quot;Sever&quot; and &quot;Yug&quot;). Two other units of the Chechen pro-Moscow forces, &quot;East&quot; and &quot;West&quot; (&quot;Vostok&quot; and &quot;Zapad&quot;), were commanded by Sulim Yamadayev (&quot;Vostok&quot;) and Said-Magomed Kakiyev (&quot;Zapad&quot;) and their men.

On 16 April 2009, the head of the Federal Security Service, Alexander Bortnikov, announced that Russia had ended its &quot;anti-terror operation&quot; in Chechnya, claiming that stability had been restored to the territory. &quot;The decision is aimed at creating the conditions for the future normalisation of the situation in the republic, its reconstruction and development of its socio-economic sphere,&quot; Bortnikov stated. While Chechnya had largely stabilised, there were still clashes with militants in the nearby regions of Dagestan and Ingushetia.

===Suicide attacks===
Between June 2000 and September 2004, Chechen insurgents added suicide attacks to their tactics. During this period, there were 23 Chechen-related suicide attacks in and outside Chechnya, notably the hostage taking at an elementary school in Beslan, in which at least 334 people died.

===Assassinations===
Both sides of the war carried out multiple assassinations. The most prominent of these included the 13 February 2004 killing of exiled former separatist Chechen President Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev in Qatar, and the 9 May 2004 killing of pro-Russian Chechen President Akhmad Kadyrov during a parade in Grozny.

===Caucasus Front===
While anti-Russian local insurgencies in the North Caucasus started even before the war, in May 2005, two months after Maskahdov&#x27;s death, Chechen separatists officially announced that they had formed a Caucasus Front within the framework of &quot;reforming the system of military–political power.&quot; Along with the Chechen, Dagestani and Ingush &quot;sectors,&quot; the Stavropol, Kabardin-Balkar, Krasnodar, Karachai-Circassian, Ossetian and Adyghe &quot;jamaats&quot; were included. This meant that practically all the regions of Russia&#x27;s south were involved in the hostilities.

The Chechen separatist movement took on a new role as the official ideological, logistical and, probably, financial hub of the new insurgency in the North Caucasus. Increasingly frequent clashes between federal forces and local militants continued in Dagestan, while sporadic fighting erupted in the other southern Russia regions, such as Ingushetia, and notably in Nalchik on 13 October 2005.

==Human rights and terrorism==

===Human rights and war crimes===

The Second Chechen War saw a new wave of war crimes and violation of international humanitarian law. Both sides have been criticised by international organizations of violating the Geneva Conventions. However, a report by Human Rights Watch states that without minimizing the abuses committed by Chechen fighters, the main reason for civilian suffering in the Second Chechen War came as a result of the abuses committed by the Russian forces on the civilian population. According to Amnesty International, Chechen civilians have been purposely targeted by Russian forces, in apparent disregard of humanitarian law. The situation has been described by Amnesty International as a Russian campaign to punish an entire ethnic group, on the pretext of &quot;fighting crime and terrorism&quot;. Russian forces have throughout the campaign ignored to follow their Geneva convention obligations, and has taken little responsibility of protecting the civilian population. Amnesty International stated in their 2001 report that Chechen civilians, including medical personnel, have been the target of military attacks by Russian forces, and hundreds of Chechen civilians and prisoners of war are extrajudicially executed.

According to human rights activists, Russian troops systematically committed the following crimes in Chechnya: the destruction of cities and villages, not justified by military necessity; shelling and bombardment of unprotected settlements; summary extrajudicial executions and killings of civilians; torture, ill-treatment and infringement of human dignity; serious bodily harm intentionally inflicted on persons not directly participating in hostilities; deliberate strikes against the civilian population, civilian and medical vehicles; illegal detentions of the civilian population and enforced disappearances; looting and destruction of civilian and public property; extortion; taking hostages for ransom; corpse trade. There were also rapes, which, along with women, were committed against men. According to the Minister of Health of Ichkeria, Umar Khanbiev, Russian forces committed organ harvesting and organ trade during the conflict.

Russian forces have since the beginning of the conflict indiscriminately and disproportionately bombed and shelled civilian objects, resulting in heavy civilian casualties. In one such occasion in October 1999, ten powerful hypersonic missiles fell without warning and targeted the city&#x27;s only maternity hospital, post office, mosque, and a crowded market. Most of the casualties occurred at the central market, and the attack is estimated to have killed over 100 instantly and injuring up to 400 others. Similar incidents include the Baku–Rostov highway bombing where the Russian Air Force perpetrated repeated rocket attacks on a large convoy of refugees trying to enter Ingushetia through a supposed &quot;safe exit&quot;. This was repeated in December 1999 when Russian soldiers opened fire on a refugee convoy marked with white flags.

The 1999–2000 siege and bombardments of Grozny caused between 5,000 and 8,000 civilians to perish. The Russian army issued an ultimatum during the Grozny-siege urging Chechens to leave the city or be destroyed without mercy. Around 300 people were killed while trying to escape in October 1999 and subsequently buried in a mass grave. The bombing of Grozny included banned Buratino thermobaric and fuel-air bombs, igniting the air of civilians hiding in basements. There were also reports of the use of chemical weapons, banned according to Geneva law. The Russian president Putin vowed that the military would not stop bombing Grozny until Russian troops quote &#x27;fulfilled their task to the end.&#x27; In 2003, the United Nations called Grozny the most destroyed city on Earth.

Another occasion of indiscriminate and perhaps deliberate bombardment is the bombing of Katyr-Yurt which occurred on 4–6 February 2000. The village of Katyr Yurt was far from the war&#x27;s front line, and jam-packed with refugees. It was untouched on the morning of 4 February when Russian aircraft, helicopters, fuel-air bombs and Grad missiles pulverised the village. After the bombing the Russian army allowed buses in, and allowed a white-flag refugee convoy to leave after which they bombed that as well. Banned Thermobaric weapons were fired on the village of Katyr-Yurt. Hundreds of civilians died as a result of the Russian bombardment and the following sweep after. Thermobaric weapons have been used by the Russian army on several occasions according to Human Rights Watch.

During the Alkhan-Yurt massacre where Russian soldiers went on a murdering spree throughout the village and summarily executing, raping, torturing, looting, burning and killing anyone in their way. Nearly all the killings were committed by Russian soldiers who were looting.&quot;&quot; Civilian attempts to stop the killings were often met with death. There has been no serious attempt conducted by the Russian authorities to bring to justice those accountable for the crimes committed at Alkhan-Yurt. Credible testimony suggests that Russian leadership in the region had knowledge of what was happening and simply chose to ignore it. Russian military leadership dismissed the incident as &quot;fairy tales&quot;, claiming that the bodies were planted and the slaughter fabricated in order to damage the reputation of Russian troops. Russian general Vladimir Shamanov dismissed accountability for the abuses in the village saying &quot;&quot;Don&#x27;t you dare touch the soldiers and officers of the Russian army. They are doing a sacred thing today-they are defending Russia. And don&#x27;t you dare sully the Russian soldier with your dirty hands!&quot;&quot;

In what is regarded as one of gravest war crimes in the war, Russian federal forces went on a village-sweep (zachistka), that involved summary executions of dozens of people, murder, looting, arson and rape of Chechens (including committing other crimes) in what is known as the Novye Aldi massacre. Russian troops had cluster-bombed the village a day prior before entering the village, telling local residents to come out from their cellars for inspection the next day. Upon entering the village, Russian soldiers shot their victims in cold blood, with automatic fire at close range. Victims ranged from a one-year-old babies to an 82-year-old woman. Victims were asked for money or jewelry by Russian soldiers, which served as a pretext for their execution if the amount was insufficient. Federal soldiers removed gold teeth from their victims and looted their corpses. Killings were accompanied by arson in an attempt to destroy evidence of summary executions and other civilian killings. There were several cases of rape. In one incident, Russian soldiers gang raped several women before strangling them to death. Pillage on a massive scale took place in the village, with Russian soldiers stripping the houses of civilians in broad daylight. Any attempt to make the Russian authorities take responsibilities for the massacre resulted in indignant denial. Human Rights Watch described the Russian authorities&#x27; response as &quot;typical&quot;. A spokesperson from the Russian Ministry of Defence declared that &quot;these assertions are nothing but a concoction not supported by fact or any proof . . . [and] should be seen as a provocation whose goal is to discredit the federal forces&#x27; operation against the terrorists in Chechnya.&quot; An eye-witness also said that investigators from the Federal Security Service told her the massacre was probably committed by Chechen fighters &quot;disguised as federal troops&quot;.

Western European rights groups estimate there have been about 5,000 forced disappearances in Chechnya since 1999. Dozens of mass graves containing hundreds of corpses have been uncovered since the start of the Chechen conflict. As of June 2008, there were 57 registered locations of mass graves in Chechnya. According to Amnesty International, thousands may be buried in unmarked graves including the 5,000 civilians who disappeared since the beginning of the Second Chechen War in 1999. In 2008, the largest mass grave found to date was uncovered in Grozny, containing some 800 bodies from the First Chechen War in 1995. Russia&#x27;s general policy to the Chechen mass graves is to not exhume them.

American Secretary of State Madeleine Albright noted in her 24 March 2000 speech to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights:
:We cannot ignore the fact that thousands of Chechen civilians have died and more than 200,000 have been driven from their homes. Together with other delegations, we have expressed our alarm at the persistent, credible reports of human rights violations by Russian forces in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings. There are also reports that Chechen separatists have committed abuses, including the killing of civilians and prisoners... The war in Chechnya has greatly damaged Russia&#x27;s international standing and is isolating Russia from the international community. Russia&#x27;s work to repair that damage, both at home and abroad, or its choice to risk further isolating itself, is the most immediate and momentous challenge that Russia faces.

The Russian government failed to pursue any accountability process for human rights abuses committed during the course of the conflict in Chechnya. Unable to secure justice domestically, hundreds of victims of abuse have filed applications with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). In March 2005 the court issued the first rulings on Chechnya, finding the Russian government guilty of violating the right to life and even the prohibition of torture with respect to civilians who had died or forcibly disappeared at the hands of Russia&#x27;s federal troops. Many similar claims were ruled since against Russia.

===Terrorist attacks===
Between May 2002 and September 2004, the Chechen and Chechen-led militants, mostly answering to Shamil Basayev, launched a campaign of terrorism directed against civilian targets in Russia. About 200 people were killed in a series of bombings (most of them suicide attacks), most of them in the 2003 Stavropol train bombing (46), the 2004 Moscow metro bombing (40), and the 2004 Russian aircraft bombings (89). Two big kidnaps, the 2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis and the Beslan school hostage crisis in 2004, resulted in the deaths of many civilians. In the Moscow stand-off, FSB Spetsnaz forces stormed the building on the third day using an unknown incapacitating chemical agent that proved to be lethal without sufficient medical care, resulting in deaths of 133 out of 916 hostages. In Beslan, some 20 hostages had been murdered by their captors before the assault, and the ill-prepared assault (started hastily after explosions in the gym that had been rigged with explosives by the terrorists) resulted in 294 more casualties among the 1,128 hostages, as well as many losses among the special forces.

==Other issues==

===Georgian Pankisi crisis===
Russian officials have accused the bordering republic of Georgia of allowing Chechen separatists to operate on Georgian territory and permitting the flow of militants and materiel across the Georgian border with Russia. In February 2002, the United States began offering assistance to Georgia in combating &quot;criminal elements&quot; as well as alleged Arab mujahideen activity in Pankisi Gorge as part of the War on Terrorism. Without resistance, Georgian troops have detained an Arab man and six criminals, and declared the region under control. In August 2002, Georgia accused Russia of a series of secret air strikes on purported separatists havens in the Pankisi Gorge in which a Georgian civilian was reported killed.

On 8 October 2001, a UNOMIG helicopter was shot down in Georgia in Kodori Valley gorge near Abkhazia, amid fighting between Chechens and Abkhazians, killing nine including five UN observers. Georgia denied having troops in the area, and the suspicion fell on the armed group headed by Chechen warlord Ruslan Gelayev, who was speculated to have been hired by the Georgian government to wage proxy war against separatist Abkhazia. On 2 March 2004, following a number of cross-border raids from Georgia into Chechnya, Ingushetia, and Dagestan, Gelayev was killed in a clash with Russian border guards while trying to get back from Dagestan into Georgia.

===Unilateral ceasefire of 2005===
On 2 February 2005, Chechen separatist president Aslan Maskhadov issued a call for a ceasefire lasting until at least 22 February (the day preceding the anniversary of Stalin&#x27;s deportation of the Chechen population). The call was issued through a separatist website and addressed to President Putin, described as a gesture of goodwill. On 8 March 2005, Maskhadov was killed in an operation by Russian security forces in the Chechen community of Tolstoy-Yurt, northeast of Grozny.

Shortly following Maskhadov&#x27;s death, the Chechen separatist council announced that Abdul-Khalim Sadulayev had assumed the leadership, a move that was quickly endorsed by Shamil Basayev (Basayev himself died in July 2006). On 2 February 2006, Sadulayev made large-scale changes in his government, ordering all its members to move into Chechen territory. Among other things, he removed First Vice-Premier Akhmed Zakayev from his post (although later Zakayev was appointed a Foreign Minister). Sadulayev was killed in June 2006, after which he was succeeded as the separatist leader by the veteran terrorist commander Doku Umarov.

===Amnesties===
As of November 2007, there were at least seven amnesties for separatist militants, as well as federal servicemen who committed crimes, declared in Chechnya by Moscow since the start of the second war. The first one was announced in 1999 when about 400 Chechen switched sides. (However, according to Putin&#x27;s advisor and aide Aslambek Aslakhanov most of them were since killed, both by their former comrades and by the Russians, who by then perceived them as a potential &quot;fifth column&quot;.) Some of the other amnesties included one during September 2003 in connection with the adoption of the republic&#x27;s new constitution, and then another between mid-2006 and January 2007. In 2007, the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights published a report entitled Amnestied People as Targets for Persecution in Chechnya, which documents the fate of several persons who have been amnestied and subsequently abducted, tortured and killed.

===Government censorship of the media coverage===
The first war, with its extensive and largely unrestricted coverage (despite deaths of many journalists), convinced the Kremlin more than any other event that it needed to control national television channels, which most Russians rely on for news, to undertake any major national policy. By the time the second war began, federal authorities had designed and introduced a comprehensive system to limit the access of journalists to Chechnya and shape their coverage.

The Russian government&#x27;s control of all Russian television stations and its use of repressive rules, harassment, censorship, intimidation and attacks on journalists almost completely deprived the Russian public of the independent information on the conflict. Practically all the local Chechen media are under control of the pro-Moscow government, Russian journalists in Chechnya face intense harassment and obstruction leading to widespread self-censorship, while foreign journalists and media outlets too are pressured into censoring their reports on the conflict. In some cases Russian journalists reporting on Chechnya were jailed (Boris Stomakhin) or kidnapped (Andrei Babitsky), and foreign media outlets (American Broadcasting Company) banned from Russia. Russia&#x27;s step came in retaliation for ABC&#x27;s broadcast of an interview with Shamil Basayev, the Chechen rebel leader who ordered and/or carried out some of the worst terrorist acts in the country&#x27;s history, including the school siege in Beslan that left 330 people dead. The Russian-Chechen Friendship Society was shut down on &quot;extremism and national hatred&quot; charges. According to a 2007 poll only 11 percent of Russians said they were happy with media coverage of Chechnya.

==Effects==

===Civilian losses===
In the Second Chechen War, over 60,000 combatants and non-combatants were killed. Civilian casualty estimates vary widely. According to the pro-Moscow Chechnya government, 160,000 combatants and non-combatants died or have gone missing in the two wars, including 30,000–40,000 Chechens and about 100,000 Russians, while separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov (deceased) repeatedly claimed about 200,000 ethnic Chechens died as a consequence of the two conflicts. A 2005 report by Al Jazeera estimated the total death toll from the two wars, including civilians and combatants, to be around 300,000. As in the case of military losses, these claims can not be independently verified. According to a count by the Russian human rights group Memorial in 2007, up to 25,000 civilians have died or disappeared since 1999. According to Amnesty International in 2007, the second war killed up to 25,000 civilians since 1999, with up to another 5,000 people missing. However, the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society set their estimate of the total death toll in two wars at about 150,000 to 200,000 civilians.

===Environmental damage===
Environmental agencies warn that the Russian republic of Chechnya, devastated by war, now faces ecological disaster. A former aide to Boris Yeltsin believes Russian bombing has rendered Chechnya an &quot;environmental wasteland.&quot; There is a special concern over widespread oil spills and pollution from sewers damaged by war (the water is polluted to a depth of 250 m), and chemical and radioactive pollution, as a result of the bombardment of chemical facilities and storages during the conflict. Chechnya&#x27;s wildlife also sustained heavy damage during the hostilities, as animals that had once populated the Chechen forests have moved off to seek safer ground. In 2004, Russian government has designated one-third of Chechnya a &quot;zone of ecological disaster&quot; and another 40% &quot;a zone of extreme environmental distress&quot;.

===Land mines===
Chechnya is the most land mine-affected region worldwide. Since 1994 there have been widespread use of mines by both sides (Russia is a party to the 1980 Convention on Conventional Weapons but not the 1996 protocol on land mines and other devices). The most heavily mined areas of Chechnya are those in which separatists continued to put up resistance, namely the southern regions, as well as the borders of the republic. No humanitarian mine clearance has taken place since the HALO Trust was evicted by Russia in December 1999. In June 2002, Olara Otunnu, the UN official, estimated that there were 500,000 land mines placed in the region. UNICEF has recorded 2,340 civilian land mine and unexploded ordnance casualties occurring in Chechnya between 1999 and the end of 2003.

===Military losses===
Military casualty figures from both sides are impossible to verify and are generally believed to be higher. In September 2000, the Kavkaz Center compiled a list of casualties officially announced in the conflict, which, although incomplete and with little factual value, provide some minimal insight of the casualties. According to the figures released by the Russian Ministry of Defence in August 2005, at least 1,250 Russian Armed Forces soldiers were killed in action in 1999–2005. This death toll did not include losses of Internal Troops, the FSB, police and local paramilitaries, of whom all at least 1,720 were killed by October 2003. Independent Russian and Western estimates are much higher; the Union of the Committees of Soldiers&#x27; Mothers of Russia, for instance, estimated about 2,000 Russian Army servicemen have been killed between 1999 and 2003.

===Political radicalization of the separatist movement===
The Chechens had become increasingly radicalized. Former Soviet Armed Forces officers Dzhokhar Dudayev and Aslan Maskhadov were succeeded by people who rely more on Islamist doctrine, rather than the secular nationalistic feelings of the population. While Dudayev and Maskhadov were seeking from Moscow recognition of the independence of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, other leaders spoke out more about the need to expel Russia from the territory of the whole North Caucasus, an impoverished mountain region inhabited mostly by Muslim, non-Russian ethnic groups.

In April 2006, asked whether negotiations with Russians are possible, the top separatist commander Doku Umarov answered: &quot;We offered them many times. But it turned out that we constantly press for negotiations and it&#x27;s as if we are always standing with an extended hand and this is taken as a sign of our weakness. Therefore we don&#x27;t plan to do this any more.&quot; In the same month, the new separatist spokesman Movladi Udugov said that attacks should be expected anywhere in Russia: &quot;Today, we have a different task on our hands – total war, war everywhere our enemy can be reached. (...) And this means mounting attacks at any place, not just in the Caucasus but in all Russia.&quot; Reflecting growing radicalization of the Chechen-led militants, Udugov said their goal was no longer Western-style democracy and independence, but the Islamist &quot;North Caucasian Emirate&quot;.

This trend ultimately resulted in the October 2007 declaration of the Caucasus Emirate by Doku Umarov where he also urged for a global Jihad, and the political schism between the moderates and the radical Islamists fighting in Chechnya and the neighbouring regions with ties in the Middle East. Some commanders, still fighting along with Doku Umarov, like Anzor Astemirov, publicly denounced the idea of a global Jihad, but keep fighting for the independence of Caucasus states.

The struggle garnered support from Muslim sympathizers around the world nonetheless, and some of them were willing to take up arms. Many commentators thought it was likely that Chechen fighters had links with international Islamist separatist groups. The BBC said in an online Q&amp;A on the conflict: &quot;It has been known for years that Muslim volunteers have traveled to Chechnya to join the fight, reportedly after attending training camps in Afghanistan or Pakistan.&quot;

Islamic radicalisation also affected the Chechen separatist movement&#x27;s support abroad. In 2013, the Tsarnaev brothers launched a suicide attack in Boston with a claim of jihad, accusing the United States of killing Muslims of Iraq, Afghanistan and Palestine, weakening sympathy for the Chechen resistance globally and increasing xenophobia against Chechens and Muslims in the United States. Rampant Islamic terrorism in Europe and the exclusive role of the Chechens on the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, most notably Abu Omar al-Shishani, also put the Chechen separatist movement in jeopardy due to increasing anti-Islamic sentiment on the rise in Europe, even in some of the countries in Europe like Poland, who supported Chechens during and after conflicts with Russia.

===Impact on the Chechen population===
According to a 2006 report by Médecins Sans Frontières, &quot;the majority of Chechens still struggle through lives burdened by fear, uncertainty and poverty.&quot; A survey conducted by MSF in September 2005 showed that 77% of the respondents were suffering from &quot;discernible symptoms of psychological distress&quot;.

As of 2008, the infant mortality rate stood at 17 per 1,000, the highest in Russia; There are reports of a growing number of genetic disorders in babies and unexplained illnesses among school children. One child in ten is born with some kind of anomaly that requires treatment. Some children whose parents can afford it are sent to the neighbouring republic of Dagestan, where treatment is better; Chechnya lacks sufficient medical equipment in most of its medical facilities. According to the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF), since 1994 to 2008 about 25,000 children in Chechnya have lost one or both parents. A whole generation of Chechen children is showing symptoms of psychological trauma. In 2006, Chechnya&#x27;s pro-Moscow deputy health minister, said the Chechen children had become &quot;living specimens&quot; of what it means to grow up with the constant threat of violence and chronic poverty. In 2007, the Chechen interior ministry has identified 1,000 street children involved in vagrancy; the number was increasing.

According to official statistics, Chechnya&#x27;s unemployment rate in August 2009 was 32.9%. By 2017, this figure had decreased to 13.9%. Many people remain homeless because so much of Chechnya&#x27;s housing was destroyed by the Russian federal forces and many people have not yet been given compensation. Not only the social (such as housing and hospitals) and economic infrastructure but also the foundations of culture and education, including most of educational and cultural institutions, were destroyed over the course of the two wars in Chechnya. However, ongoing reconstruction efforts have been rebuilding the region at a quick pace over the past few years, including new housing, facilities, paved roads and traffic lights, a new mosque, and restoration of electricity to much of the region. Governmental, social and commercial life remain hobbled by bribery, kidnapping, extortion and other criminal activity; reports by the Russian government estimate that the organized crime sector is twice the Russian average and the government is widely perceived to be corrupt and unresponsive.

Hundreds of thousands of Chechens were displaced by the conflict, including 300,000 at the height of the conflict in 2000. Most of them were displaced internally in Chechnya and in neighbouring republic of Ingushetia, but thousands of refugees also went into exile, with, as of 2008, most of them residing in the European Union countries.

===Impact on the Russian population===

The start of the war bolstered the domestic popularity of Vladimir Putin as the campaign was started one month after he had become Russian prime minister. The conflict greatly contributed to the deep changes in the Russian politics and society.

Since the Chechen conflict began in 1994, cases of young veterans returning embittered and traumatized to their home towns were reported all across Russia. Psychiatrists, law-enforcement officials, and journalists started calling the condition of psychologically scarred soldiers &quot;Chechen syndrome&quot; (CS), drawing a parallel with the post-traumatic stress disorders suffered by Soviet soldiers who fought in Afghanistan. According to Yuri Alexandrovsky, deputy director of the Moscow Serbsky Institute in 2003, at least 70% of the estimated 1.5 million Chechnya veterans suffered CS. Many of the veterans came back alcoholic, unemployable and antisocial. Thousands were also physically disabled for life and left with very limited help from the government.

According to the 2007 study by Memorial and Demos human rights organisations, Russian policemen lost their qualifications and professional skills during their duty tours in Chechnya. The conflict was linked to the rising brutality and general criminalisation of the Russian police forces. According to human rights activists and journalists, tens of thousands of police and security forces that went to Chechnya learned patterns of brutality and impunity and brought them to their home regions, often returning with disciplinary and psychological problems. Reliable numbers on police brutality are hard to come by, but in a statement released in 2006, the internal affairs department of Russia&#x27;s Interior Ministry said that the number of recorded crimes committed by police officers rose 46.8% in 2005. In one nationwide poll in 2005, 71% of respondents said they didn&#x27;t trust their police at all; in another, 41% Russians said they lived in fear of police violence. According to Amnesty International, torture of detainees in Russia had become endemic. Since 2007, police officers from outside the Caucasus were not only being sent to Chechnya, but to all the region&#x27;s republics.

The wars in Chechnya and associated Caucasian terrorism in Russia were major factors in the growth of intolerance, xenophobia, and racist violence in Russia, directed in a great part against the people from the Caucasus. The Russian authorities were unlikely to label random attacks on people of non-Russian ethnicity as racist, preferring to call it &quot;hooliganism&quot;. The number of murders officially classified as racist more than doubled in Russia between 2003 and 2004. The violence included acts of terrorism such as the 2006 Moscow market bombing which killed 13 people. In 2007, 18-year-old Artur Ryno claimed responsibility for 37 racially motivated murders in the course of one year, saying that &quot;since school [he] hated people from the Caucasus.&quot; On 5 June 2007, an anti-Chechen riot involving hundreds of people took place in the town of Stavropol in southern Russia. Rioters demanded the eviction of ethnic Chechens following the murder of two young Russians who locals believed were killed by Chechens. The event revived memories of a recent clash between Chechens and local Russians in Kondopoga, when two Russians were killed over an unpaid bill. The Caucasians also face ethnic-related violence in the ranks of Russian Army.

==Status==
In 2005, there were about 60,000 Federal troops in Chechnya, but that number has since decreased significantly. Tony Wood, a journalist and author who has written extensively about Chechnya, estimated there were about 8,000 local security forces remaining in the region . Independent analysts say there are no more than 2,000 armed terrorists combatants still fighting, while Russia says only a few hundred remain. There is still some sporadic fighting in the mountains and south of the republic, but Russia has scaled down its presence significantly leaving the local government to stabilize things further. In February 2008 the President of the separatist Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, Dokka Umarov, spoke of &quot;thousands of fighters&quot; when he addressed a speech to all his fighters in the mountains.
Most of the more prominent past Chechen separatist leaders have died or have been killed, including former president Aslan Maskhadov and leading warlord and terrorist attack mastermind Shamil Basayev. Meanwhile, the fortunes of the Chechen independence movement sagged, plagued by the internal disunity between Chechen moderates and Islamist radicals and the changing global political climate after 11 September 2001, as well as the general war-weariness of the Chechen population. Large-scale fighting has been replaced by guerrilla warfare and bombings targeting federal troops and forces of the regional government, with the violence often spilling over into adjacent regions. Since 2005, the insurgency has largely shifted out of Chechnya proper and into the nearby Russian territories, such as Ingushetia and Dagestan; the Russian government, for its part, has focused on the stabilization of the North Caucasus.

Throughout the years Russian officials have often announced that the war is over. In April 2002, President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s declared that the war in Chechnya was over.
The Russian government maintains the conflict officially ended in April 2002, and since then has continued largely as a peacekeeping operation.

In a 10 July 2006, interview with the BBC, Sergei Ivanov, Russia&#x27;s then–prime minister and former minister of defense, said that &quot;the war is over,&quot; and that &quot;the military campaign lasted only 2 years.&quot;
Ramzan Kadyrov, the current president of the Chechnya, has also stated the war is over. Others believe the war ended in 2003 with the passage of a Moscow-backed constitutional referendum and the election of pro-Moscow president Akhmad Kadyrov, while some consider the conflict on-going. Some independent observers, including Álvaro Gil-Robles, the human rights envoy for the Council of Europe, and Louise Arbour, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, have said that the war has largely concluded as of 2006.

The separatists denied that the war was over, and guerrilla warfare continued throughout the North Caucasus. Colonel Sulim Yamadayev, Chechnya&#x27;s second most powerful loyalist warlord after Kadyrov, also denied that the war is over. In March 2007, Yamadayev claimed there were well over 1,000 separatists and foreign Islamic militants entrenched in the mountains of Chechnya alone: &quot;The war is not over, the war is far from being over. What we are facing now is basically a classic partisan war and my prognosis is that it will last two, three, maybe even five more years.&quot; According to the CIA factbook, Russia has severely disabled the Chechen separatist movement, although sporadic violence still occurs throughout the North Caucasus. The overall security situation in Chechnya remains exceedingly difficult to accurately report due to the near monopoly the Russian government has on media covering the issue. In May 2007, Amnesty International refuted claims by the government that the conflict has ended, stating &quot;while large-scale military operations have been reduced, the conflict continues.&quot; The strength of the separatists has for many years been unknown. Although Russia has killed a lot of separatists throughout the war, many young fighters have joined the separatists.

An estimation, based on the war reports, shows that in the past three years Federal casualties are higher than the number of coalition casualties of the War in Afghanistan (2001–2021).
With the abolition of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria and the proclamation of the Caucasus Emirate by the president of the separatist movement Dokka Umarov, the conflict in Chechnya and the rest of the North Caucasus is often referred to as the &quot;War in the North Caucasus&quot;. The Russian government has given no new name to the conflict while most international observers still refer to it as a continuation of the Second Chechen War.

In late April 2008, the Human Rights Commissioner for the Council of Europe, Thomas Hammarberg, visited Russia&#x27;s Caucasian republics. After wrapping up the week-long visit, he said he observed a number of positive developments in Chechnya, and that there was &quot;obvious progress&quot;. He also noted that the judicial system in Chechnya was functioning properly. According to Hammarberg, missing people and the identification of missing bodies were still the two biggest human rights issues in the region, and he expressed his wish that further efforts be done to clarify the issue. President Putin responded to his comments, saying that the visit was of &quot;great significance&quot;, and that Russia will take into account what the council had to say.

Counter-insurgency operations have been conducted by Russian army in Chechnya since 1999. President of Chechnya, and former separatist, Ramzan Kadyrov declared this phase to end in March 2009. On 27 March 2009, President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev met with Alexander Bortnikov, the Director of the Federal Security Service to discuss the official ending of counter-terrorism operations in Chechnya. Medvedev directed the National Anti-Terrorism Committee, which Bortnikov also heads, to report to the Russian government on this issue, which will then be decided by the Russian parliament. However Medvedev said that situation in Chechnya must remain under direct control of the FSB.

On 16 April 2009, the counter-terrorism operation in Chechnya was officially ended. As of 2009, close to 480 active insurgents were fighting in the mountains under leadership of field commander Doku Umarov according to official data. Doku Umarov was killed by poisoning in 2013. Umarov&#x27;s successor Aliaskhab Kebekov was reported killed in 2015. The &quot;Caucasus Emirate&quot; grouping founded by Umarov in 2007 was by 2015 largely absorbed into the ISIS-affiliated Vilayat Kavkaz led by Rustam Asilderov. Asilderov was reported killed in 2016.

On 18 October 2022, Ukraine&#x27;s parliament condemned the &quot;genocide of the Chechen people&quot; during the First and Second Chechen Wars.

<text>Zone melting (or zone refining, or floating-zone method, or floating-zone technique) is a group of similar methods of purifying crystals, in which a narrow region of a crystal is melted, and this molten zone is moved through the crystal. The molten region melts impure solid at its forward edge and leaves a wake of purer material solidified behind it as it moves through the ingot. The impurities concentrate in the melt, and are moved to one end of the ingot. Zone refining was invented by John Desmond Bernal and further developed by William G. Pfann in Bell Labs as a method to prepare high-purity materials, mainly semiconductors, for manufacturing transistors. Its first commercial use was in germanium, refined to one atom of impurity per ten billion, but the process can be extended to virtually any solute–solvent system having an appreciable concentration difference between solid and liquid phases at equilibrium. This process is also known as the float zone process, particularly in semiconductor materials processing.


==Process details==
The principle is that the segregation coefficient &quot;k&quot; (the ratio at equilibrium of an impurity in the solid phase to that in the liquid phase) is usually less than one. Therefore, at the solid/liquid boundary, the impurity atoms will diffuse to the liquid region. Thus, by passing a crystal boule through a thin section of furnace very slowly, such that only a small region of the boule is molten at any time, the impurities will be segregated at the end of the crystal. Because of the lack of impurities in the leftover regions which solidify, the boule can grow as a perfect single crystal if a seed crystal is placed at the base to initiate a chosen direction of crystal growth. When high purity is required, such as in semiconductor industry, the impure end of the boule is cut off, and the refining is repeated.

In zone refining, solutes are segregated at one end of the ingot in order to purify the remainder, or to concentrate the impurities. In zone leveling, the objective is to distribute solute evenly throughout the purified material, which may be sought in the form of a single crystal. For example, in the preparation of a transistor or diode semiconductor, an ingot of germanium is first purified by zone refining. Then a small amount of antimony is placed in the molten zone, which is passed through the pure germanium. With the proper choice of rate of heating and other variables, the antimony can be spread evenly through the germanium. This technique is also used for the preparation of silicon for use in integrated circuits (&quot;chips&quot;).

===Heaters===
A variety of heaters can be used for zone melting, with their most important characteristic being the ability to form short molten zones that move slowly and uniformly through the ingot. Induction coils, ring-wound resistance heaters, or gas flames are common methods. Another method is to pass an electric current directly through the ingot while it is in a magnetic field, with the resulting magnetomotive force carefully set to be just equal to the weight in order to hold the liquid suspended. Optical heaters using high-powered halogen or xenon lamps are used extensively in research facilities particularly for the production of insulators, but their use in industry is limited by the relatively low power of the lamps, which limits the size of crystals produced by this method. Zone melting can be done as a batch process, or it can be done continuously, with fresh impure material being continually added at one end and purer material being removed from the other, with impure zone melt being removed at whatever rate is dictated by the impurity of the feed stock.

&quot;Indirect-heating floating zone&quot; methods use an induction-heated tungsten ring to heat the ingot radiatively, and are useful when the ingot is of a high-resistivity semiconductor on which classical induction heating is ineffective.

===Mathematical expression of impurity concentration===
When the liquid zone moves by a distance formula_1, the number of impurities in the liquid change. Impurities are incorporated in the melting liquid and freezing solid.

:formula_2: segregation coefficient
:formula_3: zone length
:formula_4: initial uniform impurity concentration of the solidified rod
:formula_5: concentration of impurities in the liquid melt per length
:formula_6: number of impurities in the liquid
:formula_7: number of impurities in zone when first formed at bottom
:formula_8: concentration of impurities in the solid rod

The number of impurities in the liquid changes in accordance with the expression below during the movement formula_1 of the molten zone
:formula_10
:formula_11
:formula_12
:formula_13
:formula_14
:formula_15

==Applications==

===Solar cells===
In solar cells, float zone processing is particularly useful because the single-crystal silicon grown has desirable properties. The bulk charge carrier lifetime in float-zone silicon is the highest among various manufacturing processes. Float-zone carrier lifetimes are around 1000 microseconds compared to 20–200 microseconds with Czochralski method, and 1–30 microseconds with cast polycrystalline silicon. A longer bulk lifetime increases the efficiency of solar cells significantly.

===High-resistivity devices===
Zone melting is used for the production of float-zone silicon-based high-power semiconductor devices.

==Related processes==

===Zone remelting===
Another related process is zone remelting, in which two solutes are distributed through a pure metal. This is important in the manufacture of semiconductors, where two solutes of opposite conductivity type are used. For example, in germanium, pentavalent elements of group V such as antimony and arsenic produce negative (n-type) conduction and the trivalent elements of group III such as aluminium and boron produce positive (p-type) conduction. By melting a portion of such an ingot and slowly refreezing it, solutes in the molten region become distributed to form the desired n-p and p-n junctions.

<doc id="171403" wikidata="Q15661" url="?curid=171403" title="Oxygène">
<text>Oxygène (, ) is the third studio album by French electronic musician and composer Jean-Michel Jarre. It was first released in France in December 1976 by Disques Motors, and distributed internationally in 1977 by Polydor Records. Jarre recorded the album in a makeshift studio that he set up in his apartment in Paris, using a variety of analog and digital synthesizers, and other electronic instruments and effects. 

French sound engineer Michel Geiss helped Jarre in the purchase, recording and programming of some instruments used on the album. Jarre&#x27;s musical style was influenced by musique concrète, developed by Pierre Schaeffer. The album was supported by two singles, &quot;Oxygène (Part II)&quot; and &quot;Oxygène (Part IV)&quot;. Following the international success of the latter, the album became Jarre&#x27;s breakthrough, reaching number one on the French Albums Charts. It was inspired by the track &quot;Popcorn&quot; by German-American electronic composer Gershon Kingsley.

Oxygène has been described as the album that &quot;led the synthesizer revolution of the Seventies&quot; and &quot;an infectious combination of bouncy, bubbling analog sequences and memorable hook lines&quot;. The album influenced later artists such as Moby and Brian Canham of Pseudo Echo. In 1978, it would be followed by &quot;Équinoxe&quot; and in 1979, Jarre held an open-air concert at the Place de la Concorde, causing the sales of both albums to increase, reaching worldwide figures of 15 million copies. As of 2016 it had sold an estimated 18 million copies and is one of the best-selling French, electronic and instrumental albums in history.

== Background ==
In 1967 Jarre travelled to London to sell his electric guitar and amplifier to be able to buy his first synthesizer, an EMS VCS 3 (one of the first units of the instrument), which he used on many of his subsequent albums. He also played guitar in a band called &quot;The Dustbins&quot; and mixed instruments including the electric guitar and the flute with tape effects and other sounds. Jarre began working with early analogue synthesizers and tape loops in 1968, and in 1969 he joined the &quot;Groupe de Recherches Musicales&quot; (), founded and led by Pierre Schaeffer, who developed musique concrete, a type of music composition that is mainly based on the use of pre-recorded sounds, originating the concept of sampling. That same year he mixed the harmony, synthesizers and tape effects to record his debut single &quot;La Cage/Erosmachine&quot;. In 1971, he left the institution and dedicated himself to designing Triangle&#x27;s electronic sound effects; he also went to the Pathé-Marconi record company to release it. Jarre had also done production work for some rock artists, earning enough to set up a small makeshift recording studio in the kitchen of his apartment on Rue de la Trémoille, near the Champs-Élysées in Paris. Initially it included very basic equipment consisting of a few guitar pedals, a Farfisa organ, the EMS VCS 3, and an EMS Synthi AKS; these last two were linked to two Revox tape machines. 

One of Schaeffer&#x27;s former students and artistic director of Disques Motors, Hélène Dreyfus convinced her husband, Francis Dreyfus, to hire Jean-Michel as an employee of his record label. Initially Francis offered Jarre a job as a copyright administrator, however he opted to sign an exclusive songwriting and recording contract. In 1972, the American synth-pop band Hot Butter released a successful version of Gershon Kingsley&#x27;s &quot;Popcorn&quot;. Jarre in that same year released his respective cover version under the pseudonyms Pop Corn Orchestra and Jammie Jeferson. Although unsuccessful, the track would serve as an inspiration for his most successful single, &quot;Oxygène (Part IV)&quot;. 

Their first two albums as well as their previous single were recorded on the label, Disques Motors, however they were not published there. Jarre released on Sam Fox Productions his debut experimental album &quot;Deserted Palace&quot; intended to be used in films and on television. It was created using the VCS 3 and RMI Keyboard Computer. In 1973 he composed the soundtrack for the French drama film &quot;Les Granges Brûlées&quot; (English: The Burned Barns). In its beginnings in the label, he was mainly dedicated to writing music and lyrics for other artists inside and outside the label from 1972 to 1975. The royalties received by Jean-Michel during his collaborations with Françoise Hardy, Gérard Lenorman and Patrick Juvet allowed him to purchase the ARP 2600, used in several of his collaborations with the French singer Christophe and solo works. 

In 1974, Jarre attended a conference on the analog synthesizer and the ARP 2600 at the TDF center in Issy-les-Moulineaux. It was carried out by radio and television engineers, and French musical instrument designer Michel Geiss. Later, Jarre contacted Geiss by phone to invite him to his private apartment, Geiss accepted and visited Jean-Michel&#x27;s makeshift studio, where he had the ARP 2600, the Eminent 310 Unique, the VCS 3 and more. Shortly after meeting, Jarre and Geiss started working together during the recording of Jarre&#x27;s next album. Geiss, who at that time worked as a maintenance technician at , advised Jarre on the purchase of instruments such as the RMI Harmonic Synthesizer at the Piano Center&#x27;s music fair, and was in charge of the programming and recording of some of them. Later, Jarre managed to finance the purchase of a Scully 8-track studio recorder and a mixture of Ampex 256 and 3M tape. In that same year, he composed the opening jingle for the A4 autoroute (also known as &quot;autoroute de l&#x27;Est&quot;), some media such as &quot;The Telegraph&quot; pointed out the possible original incarnation of &quot;Oxygène (Part IV)&quot; in the jingle.

==Composition and Recording==

Jarre recorded &quot;Oxygène&quot; between August and November 1976, using the makeshift recording studio in his apartment. In the Ferber studio Jarre recovered his old Mellotron that had few functional keys to write the first piece of music for the album, &quot;Oxygène (Part II)&quot;. During the recording of the album Jarre used a Revox tape to delay the sound coming out of a speaker in order to achieve a &quot;huge sense of space&quot;. This liberal use of echo was used on the various sound effects generated by the EMS VCS 3 synthesiser. The persistent allusions to terrestrial elements and the biosphere meant that the album would frequently be associated with the new-age musical movement.

A reverb effect was made through the VCS 3. Jarre also used an AKG stereo reverb and an EMT plate reverb which was meters long in live performances, and eight different stereo echoes. Some little beep sounds were played on the EMS Synthi AKS, as were the waves sound used in &quot;Oxygène (Part II)&quot;. The album also included electronic &quot;evocations of chirping birds&quot;. 

Jarre used various other synthesizers and electronic instruments to create the tracks of &quot;symphonic electronic music&quot; on &quot;Oxygène&quot;. The sounds of the Farfisa organ were heavily modified. Geiss programmed specific sounds in the ARP 2600, among them the main sound of &quot;Oxygène (Part IV)&quot; and the &quot;breathing&quot; waves sound in &quot;Oxygène (Part VI)&quot;. The Eminent 310 organ as well as the VCS 3 went through a phase pedal for guitars Electro-Harmonix Small Stone Phaser in order to provide the string pads used on the album. The main sequence of &quot;Oxygène (Part V)&quot; was created with an RMI Keyboard Computer, while both the Keyboard Computer and the RMI Harmonic Synthesizer were used on &quot;Oxygène (Part IV)&quot;, &quot;Oxygène (Part V)&quot; and &quot;Oxygène (Part VI)&quot;. 

Some of the drum sounds on the album were produced using adhesive tape to hold down two preset buttons on a Korg Mini-Pops 7 drum machine simultaneously – &quot;Oxygène (Part IV)&quot; mixed the &quot;rock&quot; and &quot;slow rock&quot; presets, while &quot;Oxygène (Part VI)&quot; mixed &quot;rhumba&quot; and &quot;bossa nova&quot;. &quot;Oxygène (Part II)&quot; instead used only the &quot;swing&quot; preset. The album was mixed by sound engineer Jean-Pierre Janiaud and his assistant Patrick Foulon at the Gang studio, it also was mastered at Translab studio.

== Artwork ==
The cover art features a skull inside a dismembered Earth and is an adaptation of a 30 x 40 cm (12&quot; x 16&quot;) watercolor, also named &quot;Oxygène&quot;, by the French painter Michel Granger. A picture of the painting was first published in 1972 in the magazine &quot;Pilote&quot;, and in 1976 the artwork was displayed at the Marquet Gallery, in rue Bonaparte in Paris. Jean-Michel visited this gallery and bought it, then Granger received a phone call from the gallery director to inform him that Jarre wanted to see him in person. On 15 September 1976, Jarre met with Granger so that he could modify the background of the watercolor and adapt it to the square shape of an LP record.

The album title was taken from the artwork because he considered that he &quot;perfectly adheres to the spirit of the songs&quot;. Jarre said: &quot;30 years ago there weren&#x27;t so many people thinking about the planet. But I&#x27;ve always been interested in that, not necessarily in a political way but in a poetic, surrealistic way.&quot; Jarre also told the English newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; that &quot;in a way, I wanted to link everything to nature and environmental issues&quot;. Granger stated that &quot;&quot;Oxygène&quot; was part of a series about the damage being done to our planet. It was a pretty violent image for a record cover.&quot; He added, &quot;That picture is the best known of all my work. It&#x27;s my Mona Lisa. But I don&#x27;t feel like it belongs to me any more. It belongs to anyone who loves the music of Jean-Michel Jarre.&quot;

== Release ==
&quot;Oxygène&quot; was turned down by several record companies such as Island Records founded by Chris Blackwell—who later considered that he made two mistakes in his life, among them rejecting &quot;Oxygène&quot; and Elton John&#x27;s first album, &quot;Empty Sky&quot;—. Jean-Michel decided to meet once again with Francis, the head of the Disques Motors label to see if he could release the album, to which he immediately agreed saying: &quot;Right, well we have a world success...&quot;.

&quot;Oxygène&quot; was released in December 1976 in France, and the first pressing of 50,000 copies were given away to a limited number of hi-fi shops vendors. They used a few copies of the album to showcase its stereo sound qualities to their customers, and also as an example of &quot;state-of-the-art sound&quot;. These copies were also promoted through clubs and discos. In addition, Jean-Michel and Francis did a promotional poster campaign in Paris.

In early 1977, Jarre together with long-time collaborator Juvet decided to put together the same team from the album &quot;Mort ou vif&quot; and set about writing the album &#x27;, which contained the hit single &quot;&quot;. The album was released in June and topped the charts. After another album with Christophe entitled &#x27; in the same year, Jarre decided to stop writing music and lyrics for other artists and preferred to dedicate himself entirely to his solo musical career.

In 1977, the album was released internationally by Polydor Records, and by April, it had sold 70,000 copies in France. &quot;Oxygène (Part IV)&quot; was Jarre&#x27;s breakthrough single worldwide, peaking at number four on the UK Singles Chart. This success led to the album reaching number one on the French Albums Charts, number two on the UK Albums and number seventy-eight on the US &quot;Billboard Top LPs &amp; Tape&quot;. &quot;Oxygène (Part II)&quot; was edited to about 3 minutes to be released in France as a single. 

&quot;Oxygène (Part IV)&quot; began to play on the most important radio stations in his native country and the United Kingdom. Europe 1 used it as the theme of two of its regular programs, &quot;Hit Parade&quot; directed by Jean-Loup Lafont and basketball show &quot;Basket sur Europe 1&quot; in the credit titles. The radio station also dedicated an hour and a half program in Jean-Michel&#x27;s studio, and played the entire album, bringing his music to millions of people. It was played on Dutch radio and television throughout the two days in 1977 that South Moluccan terrorists held. The BBC used the album in a documentary, BBC Radio 1 also played it and was used in television programs such as Antenne 2 or Récré A2.

When interviewed in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, Motors&#x27; director Stanislas Witold said, &quot;In a sense we&#x27;re putting most of our bets on Jean-Michel Jarre. He is quite exceptional and we&#x27;re sure that by 1980 he will be recognised worldwide.&quot; In Dublin, Ireland, a phone-a-disk system was used, whereby a phone call played about two minutes of the album along with an advertising message. On October 2, 1977, he was invited by host Jacques Martin to an episode of his Sunday program &quot;L&#x27;orchestre d&#x27;Antenne 2&quot;, in which the orchestra performed his single &quot;Oxygene (Part IV)&quot;. Jarre also received nearly 25 gold records worldwide. In the United States it sold over 100,000 copies in Los Angeles alone, and by the end of 1977, it sold 300,000 copies nationwide. 

Later, Francis created a label called Disques Dreyfus. &quot;Équinoxe&quot; was released in that label in 1978. It continued with a &quot;familiar style, exploring the emotive power of orchestrated electronic rhythms and melody.&quot; In 1979, Jarre performed an open-air concert at the Place de la Concorde, this event caused the sales of both albums to increase, each sold around 1.5 million copies in France and were certified platinum in 1981; both sold 11 million worldwide in November 1979. By 1981, the album had sold an estimated 15 million copies worldwide, and by 2016 an estimated 18 million, being one of the best-selling French, electronic and instrumental albums in history.

==Critical reception==
Reaction to the album upon its release in the UK in 1977 was largely negative: the British music press, more interested in the developing UK punk scene, was oriented towards guitar-based music and hostile to most electronic music. Angus MacKinnon of the &quot;NME&quot; described the album as &quot;another interminable cosmic cruise. The German spacers ([Tangerine] Dream, Schulze et al) mapped this part of the electronic galaxy aeons ago ... The album&#x27;s [...] infuriatingly derivative. Explore its prime influences instead.&quot;

Considering the album as a French version of Mike Oldfield&#x27;s work, &quot;Music Week&quot; said: &quot;Unfortunately, Jarre has produced a work that is ponderous in its self-conscious musicality – he definitely wears his art on his sleeve. Unlike Oldfield, he never stands back and laughs at his own creation. It is heavy throughout, and his influences continually jog the elbow – particularly the lugubrious touches of Mahler and the almost continuous Bach underpinning.&quot; The magazine concluded by saying that &quot;so some interest will be generated but the album is not really suited to our insular and musically antiintellectual Anglo-Saxon island.&quot;

Karl Dallas of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; was kinder towards the album, saying that &quot;the first time I heard this album I hated it ... It seemed so bland, so undemanding, so uneventful. I&#x27;ve got to admit it repays further listening, and that it is not quite the electronic Muzak I had written it off as initially.&quot; He also stated that it &quot;is not classical music&quot; and that: &quot;Though the track [referring to &quot;Oxygène Part IV&quot;] the discos are playing is, as you might expect, actually its least effective section musically, it has the same relationship to popular music as Tangerine Dream, say, or Oldfield. Personally, it still does not impress me as much as either, except at a technical level. It seems to lack heart, the sense of passionate involvement in the act of music-making which makes Edgar Froese&#x27;s work almost a musical equivalent of a Jackson Pollock painting. It is almost too accomplished, too formally precise.&quot; 

The most positive review came from Robin Smith of &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, in which he stated that, &quot;It&#x27;s pretty tough to communicate warmth through such music and the end product is usually stilted but Jean Michael Jarre has laid down a variety of forms joined together by cohesive lines.&quot; He also described Jarre as a &quot;French Mike Oldfield&quot; by &quot;possessing the same emotive powers.&quot; He concluded by saying side one &quot;ends on ghost-like notes&quot; while the side two &quot;has a rushing opening like the breaking of a barrier.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; magazine commented that it is &quot;an unusually melodic theme&quot; that &quot;is carried over both sides with all instruments played by Jarre himself&quot;. 

Retrospective reviews regard the album as a major work in the development of electronic music. Phil Alexander of &quot;Mojo&quot; listed it as one of Jarre&#x27;s three key albums and wrote that it was &quot;his conscious attempt to unite the worlds of avant-garde, electronic, classical and progressive music.&quot; He said that its &quot;dynamic, warm sound is intoxicating&quot; and regarding &quot;Oxygène (Part IV)&quot;, he finished saying it is &quot;an unlikely UK Top 5 hit from what remains an elegant cornerstone of electronic music.&quot; 

Jim Brenholts from AllMusic stated that it &quot;is one of the original e-music albums&quot; and that it &quot;has withstood the test of time and the evolution of digital electronica.&quot; He also considered that &quot;Jarre&#x27;s compositional style and his rhythmic instincts were his strong points in 1976&quot; and that &quot;the innocence and freshness provide most of its charm. Jarre&#x27;s techniques and ability provide the rest.&quot; The album was considered one of the most influential albums of 1976 by uDiscover Music, and was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. &quot;Oxygène (Part I)&quot; was considered by &quot;Billboard&quot; writer Lars Brandle as one of the electronic chillout tunes from back in the day.

=== Accolades ===
==Legacy==
&quot;Oxygène&quot; won the Grand Prix du Disque (English: Disc Grand Prize) award by L&#x27;Académie Charles Cros, and American magazine &quot;People&quot; chose Jarre as the &quot;Personality of the Year&quot;. A sequel, &quot;Oxygène 7–13&quot;, was released two decades later in 1997. In 2007, a new version of the original album titled &quot;Oxygène: New Master Recording&quot; was released, and in 2016 another sequel titled &quot;Oxygène 3&quot; was released on the 40th anniversary of &quot;Oxygène&quot;. 

Welsh music writer Mark Jenkins commented that the album &quot;achieved a dynamic compromise between imaginative sound textures and accessible melodies that for one reason or another had been denied to earlier synthesizer artists&quot;. The album has been used for music therapy, meditation and births. Some of the music was used on the soundtracks of the 1978 film &quot;Snake in the Eagle&#x27;s Shadow&quot; and the 1981 film &quot;Gallipoli&quot;.

&quot;Oxygène&quot; has been described as &quot;one of the biggest catalysts to widespread use of the synthesizer in the 1970s&quot; and influenced electronic artists like Moby, who collaborated with Jarre on his 2015 album, &quot;Electronica 1: The Time Machine&quot;. Brian Canham of Australian band Pseudo Echo said in &quot;Music Feeds&quot; that it was a &quot;major influence on my production, song-writing and synthesizer programming with Pseudo Echo, and another of my projects, Origene, hence the homage in the namesake&quot;.

<text>In linguistics, reduplication is a morphological process in which the root or stem of a word, part of that, or the whole word is repeated exactly or with a slight change.

The classic observation on the semantics of reduplication is Edward Sapir&#x27;s: &quot;Generally employed, with self-evident symbolism, to indicate such concepts as distribution, plurality, repetition, customary activity, increase of size, added intensity, continuance.&quot; It is used in inflections to convey a grammatical function, such as plurality or intensification, and in lexical derivation to create new words. It is often used when a speaker adopts a tone more expressive or figurative than ordinary speech and is also often, but not exclusively, iconic in meaning. It is found in a wide range of languages and language groups, though its level of linguistic productivity varies. Examples can be found in language as old as Sumerian, where it was used in forming some color terms, e.g. &quot;white&quot;, &quot;black&quot;.

&quot;Reduplication&quot; is the standard term for this phenomenon in the linguistics literature. Other occasional terms include &quot;cloning&quot;, &quot;doubling&quot;, &quot;duplication&quot;, &quot;repetition&quot;, and &quot;tautonym&quot; (when it is used in biological taxonomies, such as &quot;Bison bison&quot;).

==Typological description==
===Form===
Reduplication is often described phonologically in one of two ways: either (1) as reduplicated &quot;segments&quot; (sequences of consonants/vowels) or (2) as reduplicated &quot;prosodic units&quot; (syllables or moras). In addition to phonological description, reduplication often needs to be described morphologically as a reduplication of linguistic constituents (i.e. words, stems, roots). As a result, reduplication is interesting theoretically as it involves the interface between phonology and morphology.

The &quot;base&quot; is the word (or part of the word) that is to be copied. The reduplicated element is called the reduplicant, often abbreviated as &quot;&quot; or sometimes just &quot;R&quot;.

In reduplication, the reduplicant is most often repeated only once. In some languages, it can occur more than once, resulting in a tripled form, and not a &quot;duple&quot; as in most reduplication. Triplication is the term for this phenomenon of copying two times. Pingelapese has both forms. In this article, English translations of words are shown in apostrophes:

Triplication occurs in other languages, e.g. Ewe, Shipibo, Twi, Mokilese, Min Nan (Hokkien), Stau.

Sometimes gemination (i.e. the doubling of consonants or vowels) is considered to be a form of reduplication. The term &quot;dupleme&quot; has been used (after &quot;morpheme&quot;) to refer to different types of reduplication that have the same meaning.

====Full and partial====
&quot;Full reduplication&quot; involves a reduplication of the entire word. For example, Kham derives reciprocal forms from reflexive forms by total reduplication:

Another example is from Musqueam Halkomelem &quot;dispositional&quot; aspect formation:

&quot;Partial reduplication&quot; involves a reduplication of only part of the word. For example, Marshallese forms words meaning &#x27;to wear X&#x27; by reduplicating the last &quot;consonant-vowel-consonant&quot; (&quot;CVC&quot;) sequence of a base, i.e. &quot;base&quot;+&quot;CVC&quot;:

Many languages often use both full and partial reduplication, as in the Motu example below:

====Reduplicant position====
Reduplication may be &quot;initial&quot; (i.e. prefixal), &quot;final&quot; (i.e. suffixal), or &quot;internal&quot; (i.e. infixal), e.g.

Initial reduplication in Agta &quot;(CV- prefix)&quot;:
Final reduplication in Dakota &quot;(-CCV suffix)&quot;:
Internal reduplication in Samoan &quot;(-CV- infix)&quot;:
Internal reduplication is much less common than the initial and final types.

====Copying direction====
A reduplicant can copy from either the left edge of a word (&quot;left-to-right&quot; copying) or from the right edge (&quot;right-to-left&quot; copying). There is a tendency for prefixing reduplicants to copy left-to-right and for suffixing reduplicants to copy right-to-left:

Initial L → R copying in Oykangand Kunjen (a Pama–Nyungan language of Australia):
Final R → L copying in Sirionó:
Copying from the other direction is possible although less common:

Initial R → L copying in Tillamook:
Final L → R copying in Chukchi:
Internal reduplication can also involve copying the beginning or end of the base. In Quileute, the first consonant of the base is copied and inserted after the first vowel of the base.

Internal L → R copying in Quileute:
In Temiar, the last consonant of the root is copied and inserted before the medial consonant of the root.

Internal R → L copying in Temiar (an Austroasiatic language of Malaysia):
A rare type of reduplication is found in Semai (an Austroasiatic language of Malaysia). &quot;Expressive minor reduplication&quot; is formed with an initial reduplicant that copies the first and last segment of the base:

====With other morphological processes====
All the examples above consist of only reduplication, which also often occurs with other phonological and morphological processes, such as vowel alternation, deletion and affixation of non-reduplicating material.

For instance, in Tz&#x27;utujil a new &#x27;-ish&#x27; adjective form is derived from other words by suffixing the reduplicated first consonant of the base followed by the segment . This can be written succinctly as &quot;&quot;. Below are some examples:

* &#x27;red&#x27; → &#x27;reddish&#x27;  
* &#x27;yellow&#x27; → &#x27;yellowish&#x27;  
* &#x27;water&#x27; → &#x27;watery&#x27;     

Somali has a similar suffix that is used in forming the plural of some nouns: &quot;-aC&quot; (where &quot;C&quot; is the last consonant of the base):

* &#x27;ditch&#x27; → &#x27;ditches&#x27;  
* &#x27;lump of meat&#x27; → &#x27;lumps of meat&#x27;  
* &#x27;boy&#x27; → &#x27;boys&#x27;     

This combination of reduplication and affixation is commonly referred to as &quot;fixed-segment reduplication&quot;.

In Tohono O&#x27;odham initial reduplication also involves gemination of the first consonant in the distributive plural and in repetitive verbs:

* &#x27;ox&#x27; → &#x27;ox (distributive)&#x27;  (&quot;no&quot;-n-nowiu)
* &#x27;rock&#x27; → &#x27;rock (distributive)&#x27;  (&quot;ho&quot;-h-hodai)
* &#x27;dig out of ground (unitative)&#x27; → &#x27;dig out of ground (repetitive)&#x27;  (&quot;ko&quot;-k-kow)
* &#x27;hit (unitative)&#x27; → &#x27;hit (repetitive)&#x27;     

Sometimes gemination can be analyzed as a type of reduplication.

====Phonological processes, environment, and reduplicant-base relations====
* overapplication
* underapplication
* backcopying – A putative phenomenon of over-application in the reduplicant of a process triggered by the reduplicant in the base
* base-reduplicant &quot;identity&quot; (OT terminology: BR-faithfulness)
* tonal transfer/non-transfer

===Function and meaning===
In the Malayo-Polynesian family, reduplication is used to form plurals (among many other functions):
*Malay &quot;rumah&quot; &quot;house&quot;, &quot;rumah-rumah&quot; &quot;houses&quot;.

In pre-1972 Indonesian and Malaysian orthography, &quot;2&quot; was shorthand for the reduplication that forms plurals: &quot;orang&quot; &quot;person&quot;, &quot;orang-orang&quot; or &quot;orang2&quot; &quot;people&quot;. This orthography has resurfaced widely in text messaging and other forms of electronic communication.

The Nama language uses reduplication to increase the force of a verb: &quot;go&quot;, &quot;look;&quot;, &quot;go-go&quot; &quot;examine with attention&quot;.

Chinese and Japanese do not make morphological use of reduplication, but some words are formed this way, often with a collective sense: &quot;rén&quot; &quot;person&quot;, &quot;rénrén&quot; &quot;everybody&quot;; &quot;toki&quot; &quot;time&quot;, &quot;tokidoki&quot; &quot;sometimes, from time to time&quot;. The iteration mark can be used to indicate reduplication, although in Chinese the iteration mark is no longer used in standard writing and is often found only in calligraphy.

Indo-European languages formerly used reduplication to form a number of verb forms, especially in the preterite or perfect. In the older Indo-European languages, many such verbs survive:

*&quot;spondeo&quot;, &quot;spopondi&quot; (Latin, &quot;I vow, I vowed&quot;)
* (Greek, &quot;I leave, I left&quot;)
* (Greek, &quot;I see, I saw&quot;; these Greek examples exhibit ablaut as well as reduplication)
*&quot;háitan&quot;, &quot;haíháit&quot; (Gothic, &quot;to name, I named&quot;)

Those forms do not survive in Modern English but existed in its parent Germanic languages. Many verbs in the Indo-European languages exhibit reduplication in the present stem, rather than the perfect stem, often with a different vowel from that used for the perfect: Latin &quot;gigno, genui&quot; (&quot;I beget, I begat&quot;) and Greek τίθημι, ἔθηκα, τέθηκα (I place, I placed, I have placed). Other Indo-European verbs used reduplication as a derivational process: compare Latin &quot;sto&quot; (&quot;I stand&quot;) and &quot;sisto&quot; (&quot;I remain&quot;). All of those Indo-European inherited reduplicating forms are subject to reduction by other phonological laws.

Reduplication can be used to refer to the most prototypical instance of a word&#x27;s meaning. In such a case, it is called contrastive focus reduplication. Finnish colloquial speech uses the process; nouns can be reduplicated to indicate genuinity, completeness, originality and being uncomplicated, as opposed to being fake, incomplete, complicated or fussy. It can be thought as compound word formation. For example, &quot;Söin jäätelöä ja karkkia, sekä tietysti ruokaruokaa.&quot; &quot;I ate ice cream and candy, and of course food-food&quot;. Here, &quot;food-food&quot; is contrasted to &quot;junk-food&quot;. One may say, &quot;En ollut eilen koulussa, koska olin kipeä. Siis kipeäkipeä&quot; (&quot;I wasn&#x27;t at school yesterday because I was sick. Sick-sick, that is&quot;); that means that one was actually suffering from an illness instead of making up excuses, as usual.

* &quot;ruoka&quot; &quot;food&quot;, &quot;ruokaruoka&quot; &quot;proper food&quot;, as opposed to snacks
* &quot;peli&quot; &quot;game&quot;, &quot;pelipeli&quot; &quot;complete game&quot;, as opposed to a mod
* &quot;puhelin&quot; &quot;phone&quot;, &quot;puhelinpuhelin&quot; &quot;phone for talking&quot;, as opposed to a pocket computer
* &quot;kauas&quot; &quot;far away&quot;, &quot;kauaskauas&quot; &quot;unquestionably far away&quot;
* &quot;koti&quot; &quot;home&quot;, &quot;kotikoti&quot; &quot;home of your parents&quot;, as opposed to one&#x27;s current place of residence

Words can be reduplicated with their case morphemes, as in &quot;lomalla lomalla&quot; (&quot;away, on vacation, on leave&quot;), where the adessive morpheme -&quot;-lla&quot; appears twice.

In Swiss German, the verbs &quot;gah&quot; or &quot;goh&quot; &quot;go&quot;, &quot;cho&quot; &quot;come&quot;, &quot;la&quot; or &quot;lo&quot; &quot;let&quot; and &quot;aafa&quot; or &quot;aafo&quot; &quot;begin&quot; reduplicate when they are combined with other verbs.



In some Salishan languages, reduplication can mark both diminution and plurality, with one process being applied to each end of the word, as in the following example from Shuswap. Note that the transcription is not comparable to the IPA, but the reduplication of both initial and final portions of the root is clear: &quot;ṣōk!Emē&#x27;’n&quot; &#x27;knife&#x27; reduplicated as &quot;ṣuk!ṣuk!Emen&#x27;’me’n&quot; &#x27;plural small knives&#x27; (Haeberlin 1918:159). Reduplication has been found to be a major part of Salish languages.

==Babbling in child language acquisition==
At 25–50 weeks after birth, typically developing infants go through a stage of reduplicated or canonical babbling (Stark 198, Oller, 1980). Canonical babbling is characterized by repetition of identical or nearly identical consonant-vowel combinations, such as &quot;nanana&quot; or &quot;idididi&quot;. It appears as a progression of language development as infants experiment with their vocal apparatus and home in on the sounds used in their native language. Canonical/reduplicated babbling also appears at a time when general rhythmic behavior, such as rhythmic hand movements and rhythmic kicking, appear. Canonical babbling is distinguished from earlier syllabic and vocal play, which has less structure.

==Examples==
===Indo-European===
====Proto-Indo-European====
The Proto-Indo-European language used partial reduplication of a consonant and &quot;e&quot; in many stative aspect verb forms. The perfect or preterite (past) tense of some Ancient Greek, Gothic, Latin, Sanskrit, Old Irish, and Old Norse verbs preserve this reduplication:
* Ancient Greek &quot;lúō&quot; &#x27;I free&#x27; vs. &quot;léluka&quot; &quot;I have freed&quot;
* Gothic &quot;hald&quot; &quot;I hold&quot; vs. &quot;haíhald&quot; (&quot;hĕhald&quot;) &quot;I/he held&quot;
* Latin &quot;I run&quot; vs. &quot;I ran&quot; or &quot;have run&quot;
* Old Irish &quot;it breaks&quot; vs. &quot;it broke&quot;
* Old Norse &quot;rœ&quot; &quot;I row&quot; vs. &quot;rera&quot; (&quot;røra&quot;) &quot;I rowed&quot;
* Sanskrit &quot;likhati&quot; &#x27;he writes&#x27; vs. &quot;lilekha&quot; &quot;he has written&quot; or &quot;he wrote&quot;
* A rare modern English reflex is &quot;do&quot; vs. &quot;did&quot;

Proto-Indo-European also used reduplication for the imperfective aspect. Ancient Greek preserves this reduplication in the present tense of some verbs. Usually, but not always, this is reduplication of a consonant and &quot;i&quot;, and contrasts with e-reduplication in the perfect:

* &quot;dídōmi&quot; &quot;I give&quot; (present)
* &quot;dédōka&quot; &quot;I have given&quot; (perfect)
* * &quot;sísdō&quot; → &quot;hízō&quot; &quot;I set&quot; (present)
* * &quot;sésdomai&quot; → &quot;hézomai&quot; &quot;I sit down&quot; (present; from sd-, zero-grade of root in *sed-os → ἕδος &quot;hédos&quot; &quot;seat, abode&quot;)

Reduplication in nouns was rare, the best example being Proto-Indo-European &quot;&quot; &#x27;wheel&#x27; (cf. Lithuanian &quot;kãklas&quot; &#x27;neck&#x27;, Sanskrit &quot;cakrá&quot; &#x27;wheel&#x27;, Greek &quot;κύκλος&quot; (kýklos) &#x27;circle&#x27;), which doubled *&quot;kʷel-o-&quot; (cf. Old Prussian &quot;kelan&quot; &#x27;wheel&#x27;, Welsh &quot;pêl&quot; &#x27;ball&#x27;), itself likely a deverbative of *&quot;kʷelh₁-&quot; &#x27;to turn&#x27;.

====English====
English has several types of reduplication, ranging from informal expressive vocabulary (the first four forms below) to grammatically meaningful forms (the last two below). See also the alliteration section of the irreversible binomial article for cases like &quot;flip-flop&quot; and &quot;dribs and drabs&quot;.

* Rhyming reduplication: Artsy-fartsy, boogie-woogie, okey-dokey, easy-peasy, hanky-panky, hocus-pocus, hoity-toity, hokey-pokey, holy moly, hurdy-gurdy, itsy-bitsy, namby-pamby, raggle-taggle, ragtag, razzle-dazzle, super-duper, teenie-weenie, willy-nilly, wingding.
* Exact reduplications: Ack ack, aye-aye, back-to-back, blah-blah, boo-boo, bye-bye, chin-chin, choo-choo, chow-chow, dik-dik, doo-doo, fifty-fifty, gogo, ha ha, half-and-half, honk-honk, housey-housey, juju, klop-klop, mama, muumuu, night-night, no-no, papa, pee-pee, pip-pip, pom-pom, poo-poo, pooh-pooh, putt putt, so-so, ta-ta, there-there, tut-tut, tutu, wah-wah, wee-wee, yo-yo. While in many forms of English, exact reduplications can also be used to emphasise the strength of a word (&quot;He wants it &quot;now&quot; now&quot;), in South African English, &#x27;now-now&#x27; means &#x27;relatively soon&#x27;.
** lexical reduplication: &#x27;Each-each boy take one-one chair.&#x27; Indian English
* Ablaut reduplications: In ablaut reduplications, the first vowel is almost always a high vowel or front vowel (typically ɪ as in hit) and the reduplicated vowel is a low vowel or back vowel (typically æ as in &quot;cat&quot; or ɒ as in &quot;top&quot;). Examples include: bric-a-brac, chit-chat, clip-clop, ding-dong, flimflam, flip-flop, hip-hop, jibber-jabber, kitty-cat, knick-knack, mishmash, ping-pong, pitter-patter, riffraff, sing-song, slipslop, splish-splash, tick-tock, ticky-tacky, tip-top, whiff-whaff, wibble-wobble, wishy-washy, zig-zag. Three-part ablaut sequences are less numerous, but are attested, e.g. tic-tac-toe, bing-bang-boom, bish-bash-bosh, splish-splash-splosh and &quot;Live, Laugh, Love&quot;. Spike Milligan&#x27;s poem &quot;On the Ning Nang Nong&quot; achieves comic effect by varying the ordering of vowels in such triples: &quot;There&#x27;s a Nong Nang Ning/Where the trees go Ping!&quot;.
* Shm-reduplication can be used with most any word; e.g. &quot;baby-shmaby&quot;, &quot;cancer-shmancer&quot; and &quot;fancy-shmancy&quot;. This process is a feature of American English from Yiddish, starting among the American Jews of New York City, then the New York dialect and then the whole country.

Of the above types, only shm-reduplication is productive, meaning that examples of the first three are fixed forms and new forms are not easily accepted.

* Comparative reduplication: In the sentence &quot;John&#x27;s apple looked redder and redder,&quot; the reduplication of the comparative indicates that the comparative is becoming more true over time, meaning roughly &quot;John&#x27;s apple looked progressively redder as time went on.&quot; In particular, this construction does mean that John&#x27;s apple is redder than some other apple, which would be a possible interpretation in the absence of reduplication, e.g. in &quot;John&#x27;s apple looked redder.&quot; With reduplication, the comparison is of the object being compared to itself over time. Comparative reduplication always combines the reduplicated comparative with &quot;and&quot;. This construction is common in speech and is used even in formal speech settings, but it is less common in formal written texts. Although English has simple constructs with similar meanings, such as &quot;John&#x27;s apple looked ever redder,&quot; these simpler constructs are rarely used in comparison with the reduplicative form. Comparative reduplication is fully productive and clearly changes the meaning of any comparative to a temporal one, despite the absence of any time-related words in the construction. For example, the temporal meaning of &quot;The frug seemed wuggier and wuggier&quot; is clear: despite not knowing what a frug is or what wugginess is, it is easy to grasp that the apparent wugginess of the frug was increasing over time, as indicated by the reduplication of the comparative &quot;wuggier&quot;.
* Contrastive focus reduplication: Exact reduplication can be used with contrastive focus (generally where the first noun is stressed) to indicate a literal, as opposed to figurative, example of a noun, or perhaps a sort of Platonic ideal of the noun, as in &quot;Is that carrot &quot;cheese&quot;cake or carrot &quot;cake&quot; cake?&quot;. This is similar to the Finnish use mentioned above. Furthermore, it is used to contrast &quot;real&quot; or &quot;pure&quot; things against imitations or less pure forms. For example, at a coffee shop one may be asked, &quot;Do you want soy milk?&quot; and respond, &quot;No, I want &quot;milk&quot; milk.&quot; This gives the idea that they want &quot;real&quot; milk.
* Intensificatory reduplication: Examples like &quot;a big, big problem,&quot; &quot;a long, long way&quot;, or &quot;very very difficult&quot; are instances of intensificatory reduplication. This type of reduplication is used to intensify the meaning of the original word. It&#x27;s a way of expressing that something is not just big or long, but very big or very long. This type of reduplication is typically used only with a narrow range of words, and the meaning can often be inferred even if the specific combination is not a standard idiomatic expression. The more common items include gradable adjectives (e.g., &quot;big&quot;, &quot;great&quot;, &quot;deep&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;old&quot;), along with intensificatory adverbs (e.g., &quot;very&quot;, &quot;really&quot;, &quot;so&quot;) and determiners (e.g., &quot;much&quot;). This is only possible for pre-head modifiers, and not with other syntactic functions. For example, &quot;a long long way&quot; is fine, but &quot;*the way is long long&quot; is ungrammatical, and &quot;I really really want it&quot; but not &quot;*I want it really really&quot;.

The double is—such as &quot;What I want is, is to go home&quot;—is in some cases a type of reduplication, which may be regarded as non-standard or incorrect.

====Dutch====

While not common in Dutch, reduplication does exist. Most, but not all (e.g., &quot;pipi&quot;, &quot;blauwblauw&quot; (laten), &quot;taaitaai&quot; (gingerbread)) reduplications in Dutch are loanwords (e.g., &quot;koeskoes&quot;, &quot;bonbon&quot;, (ik hoorde het) &quot;via via&quot;) or imitative (e.g., &quot;tamtam&quot;, &quot;tomtom&quot;). Another example is a former safe sex campaign slogan in Flanders: &quot;Eerst bla-bla, dan boem-boem&quot; (&quot;First talk, then have sex&quot;; lit. &quot;First blah-blah, then boom-boom&quot;). In Dutch the verb &quot;gaan&quot; (&quot;to go&quot;) can be used as an auxiliary verb, which can lead to a triplication: &quot;we gaan (eens) gaan gaan&quot; (we are going to get going). The use of &quot;gaan&quot; as an auxiliary verb with itself is considered incorrect, but is commonly used in Flanders. Numerous examples of reduplication in Dutch (and other languages) are discussed by Daniëls (2000).

====Afrikaans====
Afrikaans makes use of reduplication to emphasize the meaning of the word repeated and to denote a plural or event happening in more than one place. For example, &quot;krap&quot; means &quot;to scratch one&#x27;s self,&quot; while &quot;krap-krap-krap&quot; means &quot;to scratch one&#x27;s self vigorously&quot;, whereas &quot;dit het plek-plek gereën&quot; means &quot;it rained here and there&quot;. Reduplication in Afrikaans has been described extensively in the literature – see for example , and . Further examples of this include: &quot;koes&quot; (to dodge) being reduplicated in the sentence &quot;Piet hardloop koes-koes weg&quot; (Piet is running away while constantly dodging / cringing); &quot;sukkel&quot; (to struggle) becoming &quot;sukkel-sukkel&quot; (making slow progress; struggling on); and &quot;kierang&quot; (to cheat) becoming &quot;kierang-kierang&quot; to indicate being cheated on repeatedly.

====Romance====
In Italian reduplication was used both to create new words or word associations (&quot;tran-tran&quot;, &quot;via via&quot;, &quot;leccalecca&quot;) and to intensify the meaning (&quot;piano piano&quot; &quot;very softly&quot;).

Common in Lingua Franca, particularly but not exclusively for onomatopoeic action descriptions:
&quot;Spagnoli venir...boum boum...andar; Inglis venir...boum boum bezef...andar; Francés venir...tru tru tru...chapar.&quot; (&quot;The Spaniards came, cannonaded, and left. The English came, cannonaded heavily, and left. The French came, trumpeted on bugles, and captured it.&quot;)

Common uses for reduplication in French are the creation of hypocoristics for names, whereby &quot;Louise&quot; becomes &quot;Loulou&quot;, and Zinedine Zidane becomes &quot;Zizou&quot;; and in many nursery words, like &quot;dada&quot; &#x27;horsie&#x27; (vs. &quot;cheval&quot; &#x27;horse&#x27;), &quot;tati/tata&quot; &#x27;auntie&#x27; (vs. &quot;tante&quot; &#x27;aunt&#x27;), or &quot;tonton&quot; &#x27;unkie&#x27; (vs. &quot;oncle&quot; &#x27;uncle&#x27;).

In Romanian and Catalan, reduplication is not uncommon and it has been used for both the creation of new words (including many from onomatopoeia) and expressions, for example,
*Romanian: &quot;mormăi&quot;, &quot;țurțur&quot;, &quot;dârdâi&quot;, expressions &quot;talmeș-balmeș&quot;, &quot;harcea-parcea&quot;, &quot;terchea-berchea&quot;, &quot;țac-pac&quot;, &quot;calea-valea&quot;, &quot;hodoronc-tronc&quot;.
*Catalan: &quot;així així, aixina aixana, balandrim-balandram, baliga-balaga, banzim-banzam, barliqui-barloqui, barrija-barreja, bitllo-bitllo, bub-bub, bum-bum, but-but, catric-catrac, cloc-cloc, cloc-piu, corre-corrents, de nyigui-nyogui, farrigo-farrago, flist-flast, fru-fru, gara-gara, gloc-gloc, gori-gori, leri-leri, nap-buf, ning-nang, ning-ning, non-non, nyam-nyam, nyau-nyau, nyec-nyec, nyeu-nyeu, nyic-nyic, nyigo-nyigo, nyigui-nyogui, passa-passa, pengim-penjam, pif-paf, ping-pong, piu-piu, poti-poti, rau-rau, ringo-rango, rum-rum, taf-taf, tam-tam, tau-tau, tic-tac, tol·le-tol·le, tric-trac, trip-trap, tris-tras, viu-viu, xano-xano, xau-xau, xerric-xerrac, xim-xim, xino-xano, xip-xap, xiu-xiu, xup-xup, zig-zag, ziga-zaga, zim-zam, zing-zing, zub-zub, zum-zum&quot;.

In colloquial Mexican Spanish it is common to use reduplicated adverbs such as &quot;luego luego&quot; (then then) meaning &quot;immediately&quot;, or &quot;casi casi&quot; (almost almost) which intensifies the meaning of &#x27;almost&#x27;.

====Slavic====

The reduplication in the Russian language serves for various kinds of intensifying of the meaning and exists in several forms: a hyphenated or repeated word (either exact or inflected reduplication), and forms similar to shm-reduplication.

====Celtic====
Reduplication is a common feature of Irish and includes the examples &quot;rírá&quot;, &quot;ruaille buaille&quot; both meaning &quot;commotion&quot; and &quot;fite fuaite&quot; meaning &quot;intertwined&quot;.

====Indo-Aryan====
Typically all Indo-Aryan languages, like Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati and Bengali use partial or echoic reduplication in some form or the other. It is usually used to sound casual, or in a suggestive manner. It is often used to mean &quot;etcetera&quot;. For example, in Hindi, chai-shai (&quot;chai&quot; means tea, while this phrase means tea or any other supplementary drink or tea along with snacks). Quite common in casual conversations are a few more examples like shopping-wopping, khana-wana.
South Asian Indo Aryan languages are also rich in other forms of reduplication: morphological (expressives), lexical (distributives), and phrasal (aspectual).
*morphological:
Reduplication also occurs in the 3rd &quot;gaṇa&quot; (verb class) of the Sanskrit language: &quot;bibheti&quot; &quot;he fears&quot;, &quot;bibharti&quot; &quot;he bears&quot;, &quot;juhoti&quot; &quot;he offers&quot;, &quot;dadāti&quot;, &quot;he gives&quot;. Even though the general idea is to reduplicate the verb root as a prefix, several sandhi rules change the outcome.

There are a number of constructions in Hindi and Urdu that are constructed by reduplication. Nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, pronouns, all have possibility of reduplications.

====Armenian====

In Armenian, reduplication follows the same classification as in Turkish (see below), namely emphatic reduplication, echo reduplication, and doubling. Many appear as lexical entries in Armenian lexicographical sources.
# Emphatic reduplication, one of two interpolated consonants (փ, ս), as in &quot;կարմիր&quot; (red), which becomes &quot;կասկարմիր&quot; (very red).
# Echo Reduplication, as in &quot;սեղան-մեղան&quot; (table schmable).
# Doubling, as in &quot;քիչ-քիչ&quot; (little [by] little) 

===Turkic===

====Turkish====
In Turkish, there are three kinds of reduplication.

Emphatic reduplication, also called intensification: A word can be reduplicated partially, such that an emphatic stem is created to be attached to the adjective. This is done by taking the first syllable of the adjective, dropping the syllable-final phoneme, and adding one of four interpolated consonants (p, s, m, r). For example, &quot;kırmızı&quot; (red) becomes &quot;kıpkırmızı&quot; (very red); &quot;mavi&quot; (blue) becomes &quot;masmavi&quot; (very blue); &quot;yeşil&quot; (green) becomes &quot;yemyeşil&quot; (very green), and &quot;temiz&quot; (clean) becomes &quot;tertemiz&quot; (&quot;spotless&quot;). The added consonant is unpredictable, grammatically speaking; phonological studies, such as Wedel (1999), shed light on the subject.

Echo reduplication: similar to echo word in other languages, a word can be reduplicated while replacing the initial consonants (not being &quot;m&quot;, and possibly missing) with &quot;m&quot;. The meaning of the original word is broadened. For example, &quot;tabak&quot; means &quot;plate(s)&quot;, and &quot;tabak mabak&quot; then means &quot;plates, dishes and such&quot;. This can be applied to all kinds of words, as in &quot;yeşil meşil&quot; meaning &quot;green, greenish, whatever&quot;. Although not used in formal written Turkish, it is a standard accepted construction.

Doubling: A word can be reduplicated totally, turning it into an adverb with a related meaning. For example, &quot;zaman zaman&quot; (time time) meaning &quot;time to time&quot; or &quot;occasionally&quot;; &quot;uzun uzun&quot; (long long) meaning &quot;at length.&quot; This type is used also in formal Turkish, especially in literature. There are a lot of reduplications in this category which do not, if used as one word, have a place in the Turkish language&#x27;s vocabulary but is used solely in this way. These words are called mimetic in linguistics. An example is &#x27;şırıl şırıl&#x27; (used for the sound of a waterfall). They try to give sounds to not only audible but also non-audible phenomena. For example, &#x27;mışıl mışıl&#x27; is used for sleeping soundly.

===Dravidian===
Reduplication is also used in Dravidian languages like Telugu for the same purpose.

* phrasal:
===Bantu===
Reduplication is a common phenomenon in Bantu languages and is usually used to form a frequentive verb or for emphasis.
* Swahili &quot;piga&quot; &#x27;to strike&#x27;; &quot;pigapiga&quot; &#x27;to strike repeatedly&#x27;
* Ganda &quot;okukuba&quot; (&quot;oku-kuba&quot;) &#x27;to strike&#x27;; &quot;okukubaakuba&quot; (&quot;oku-kuba-kuba&quot;) &#x27;to strike repeatedly, to batter&#x27;
* Chewa &quot;tambalalá&quot; &#x27;to stretch one&#x27;s legs&#x27;; &quot;tambalalá-tambalalá&quot; to stretch one&#x27;s legs repeatedly&#x27;
Popular names that have reduplication include
* Bafana Bafana
* Chipolopolo
* Eric Djemba-Djemba
* Lomana LuaLua
* Ngorongoro

===Semitic===
Semitic languages frequently reduplicate consonants, though often not the vowels that appear next to the consonants in some verb form. This can take the shape of reduplicating the antepenultimate consonant (usually the second of three), the last of two consonants, or the last two consonants.

====Hebrew====
In Hebrew, reduplication is used in nouns, adjectives, adverbs and verbs for various reasons:

* For emphasis: in &quot;le&#x27;at le&#x27;at&quot;, where the adverb &quot;slowly&quot; is duplicated to mean &quot;very slowly&quot;. In the slangism &quot;gever gever&quot;, the noun &quot;man&quot; is duplicated to mean a &quot;very manly man&quot;.
* To mean &quot;one by one&quot;:
** &quot;yom yom&quot; is based on &quot;day&quot;, and means &quot;every day, day by day&quot;.
** &quot;para para&quot; is based on &quot;cow&quot;, and literally means &quot;cow by cow&quot;, referring to &quot;one thing at a time&quot;. This is possibly a folk etymology, and a derivation from Spanish &quot;para&quot; meaning &quot;stop&quot; is possible.
* To create a diminutive: by reduplicating the last two consonants (bi-consonantal reduplication):
** &quot;kelev&quot; &quot;dog&quot;
*** &quot;klavlav&quot; &quot;puppy&quot;
** &quot;khatul&quot; &quot;cat&quot;
*** &quot;khataltul&quot; &quot;kitten&quot;
** &quot;lavan&quot; &quot;white&quot;
*** &quot;levanban&quot; &quot;whitish&quot;
** &quot;katan&quot; &quot;small&quot;
*** &quot;ktantan&quot; &quot;tiny&quot;
* To create secondary derivative verbs: by reduplicating the root or part of it:
** &quot;dal&quot; () &quot;poor&quot; &gt; &quot;dilel&quot; () &quot;to dilute&quot;, and also &quot;dildel&quot; () &quot;to impoverish, weaken&quot;.
** &quot;nad&quot; () &quot;to move, nod&quot; &gt; &quot;nadad&quot; () &quot;to wander&quot; but also &quot;nidned&quot; () &quot;to swing&quot; and - due to phono-semantic matching of the Yiddish lexical item נודיען nídyen / núdzhen &quot;to bore, bother&quot; - also &quot;to bother, pest, nag, annoy&quot;.
** &quot;tzakhak&quot; () &quot;to laugh&quot; &gt; &quot;tzikhkek&quot; () &quot;to chuckle&quot;.
* For onomatopoeia:
** שקשק &quot;shikshék&quot; &quot;to make noise, rustle&quot;.
** רשרש &quot;rishrésh&quot; &quot;to make noise, rustle&quot;.

There are also numerous examples in the Torah, for example &quot;אם שמוע תשמעו&quot; which means &quot;if you listen diligently&quot;.

====Amharic====
In Amharic, verb roots can be reduplicated three different ways. These can result in verbs, nouns, or adjectives (which are often derived from verbs).

From the root &quot;sbr&quot; &#x27;break&#x27;, antepenultimate reduplication produces &quot;täsäbabbärä&quot; &#x27;it was shattered&#x27; and biconsonantal reduplication produces &quot;täsbäräbbärä&quot; &#x27;it was shattered repeatedly&#x27; and &quot;səbərbari&quot; &#x27;a shard, a shattered piece&#x27;.

From the root &quot;kHb&quot; &#x27;pile stones into a wall&#x27;, since the second radical is not fully specified, what some call &quot;hollow&quot;, the antepenultimate reduplication process reduplicates the &quot;k&quot; inserting the vowel &quot;a&quot; along with the consonant as a place holder for the hollow consonant, which is by some criteria antepenultimate, and produces &quot;akakabä&quot; &#x27;pile stones repeatedly&#x27;.

===Japanese===
A small number of native Japanese nouns have collective forms produced by reduplication (possibly with rendaku), such as 人々 &quot;hitobito&quot; &quot;people&quot; (&quot;h&quot; → &quot;b&quot; is rendaku) – these are written with the iteration mark &quot;々&quot; to indicate duplication. This formation is not productive and is limited to a small set of nouns. Similarly to Standard Chinese, the meaning is not that of a true plural, but collectives that refer to a large, given set of the same object; for example, the formal English equivalent of 人々 would be &quot;people&quot; (collective), rather than &quot;persons&quot; (plural individuals).

Japanese also contains a large number of mimetic words formed by reduplication of a syllable. These words include not only onomatopoeia, but also words intended to invoke non-auditory senses or psychological states, such as きらきら &quot;kirakira&quot; (sparkling or shining). By one count, approximately 43% of Japanese mimetic words are formed by full reduplication, and many others are formed by partial reduplication, as in がささ〜 &quot;ga-sa-sa-&quot; (rustling) – compare English &quot;&quot;a&quot;-ha-ha-ha&quot;.

===Austronesian===
Austronesian languages are known for their extensive use of reduplication in both nouns and verbs.

====Malay (Indonesian and Malaysian)====
In the Malay language, reduplication is a semi-productive process. It is used for expression of various grammatical functions (such as verbal aspect) and it is part in a number of complex morphological models. Simple reduplication of nouns and pronouns can express at least three meanings:

#Diversity or non-exhaustive plurality:
##&quot;Burung-burung itu juga diekspor ke luar negeri&quot; = &quot;All those birds are also exported out of the country&quot;.
#Conceptual similarity:
##&quot;langit-langit&quot; = &quot;ceiling; palate; etc.&quot; (&quot;langit&quot; = &quot;sky&quot;)
##&quot;jari-jari&quot; = &quot;spoke; bar; radius; etc.&quot; (&quot;jari&quot; = &quot;finger&quot; etc.)
#Pragmatic accentuation:
##&quot;Saya bukan anak-anak lagi!&quot; &quot;I am not a child anymore!&quot; (&quot;anak&quot; = &quot;child&quot;)

Reduplication of an adjective can express different things:
*Adverbialisation: &quot;Jangan bicara keras-keras!&quot; = &quot;Don&#x27;t speak loudly!&quot; (&quot;keras&quot; = hard)
*Plurality of the corresponding noun: &quot;Rumah di sini besar-besar&quot; = &quot;The houses here are big&quot; (&quot;besar&quot; = &quot;big&quot;).

Reduplication of a verb can express various things:
*Simple reduplication:
**Pragmatic accentuation: &quot;Kenapa orang tidak datang-datang?&quot; = &quot;Why aren&#x27;t people coming?&quot;
*Reduplication with &quot;me-&quot; prefixation, depending on the position of the prefix &quot;me-&quot;:
**Repetition or continuation of the action: &quot;Orang itu memukul-mukul anaknya&quot;: &quot;That man continuously beat his child&quot;;
**Reciprocity: &quot;Kedua-dua orang itu pukul-memukul&quot; = &quot;Those two men would beat each other&quot;.
Notice that in the first case, the nasalisation of the initial consonant (whereby /p/ becomes /m/) is repeated, while in the second case, it only applies in the repeated word.

====Māori====
The Māori language (New Zealand) uses reduplication in a number of ways.

Reduplication can convey a simple plural meaning, for instance &quot;wahine&quot; &quot;woman&quot;, &quot;waahine&quot; &quot;women&quot;, &quot;tangata&quot; &quot;person&quot;, &quot;taangata&quot; &quot;people&quot;. Biggs calls this &quot;infixed reduplication&quot;. It occurs in a small subset of &quot;people&quot; words in most Polynesian languages.

Reduplication can convey emphasis or repetition, for example &quot;mate&quot; &quot;die&quot;, &quot;matemate&quot; &quot;die in numbers&quot;; and de-emphasis, for example &quot;wera&quot; &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;werawera&quot; &quot;warm&quot;.

Reduplication can also extend the meaning of a word; for instance &quot;paki&quot; &quot;pat&quot; becomes &quot;papaki&quot; &quot;slap or clap once&quot; and &quot;pakipaki&quot; &quot;applaud&quot;; &quot;kimo&quot; &quot;blink&quot; becomes &quot;kikimo&quot; &quot;close eyes firmly&quot;

==== Mortlockese ====
The Mortlockese language is a Micronesian language spoken primarily on the Mortlock Islands. In the Mortlockese language, reduplication is used to show a habitual or imperfective aspect. For example, /jææjæ/ means &quot;to use something&quot; while the word /jæjjææjæ/ means &quot;to use something habitually or repeatedly&quot;. Reduplication is also used in the Mortlockese Language to show extremity or extreme measures. One example of this can be seen in /ŋiimw alɛɛtɛj/ which means &quot;hate him, her, or it&quot;. To mean &quot;really hate him, her, or it,&quot; the phrase changes to /ŋii~mw al~mw alɛɛtɛj/.

====Pingelapese====
Pingelapese is a Micronesian language spoken on the Pingelap atoll and on two of the eastern Caroline Islands, called the high island of Pohnpei. Pingelapese utilizes both duplication and triplication of a verb or part of a verb to express that something is happening for certain duration of time. No reduplication means that something happens. A reduplicated verb means that something IS happening, and a triplication means that something is STILL happening. For example, &quot;saeng&quot; means &#x27;to cry&#x27; in Pingelapese. When reduplicated and triplicated, the duration of this verb is changed:
* &quot;saeng&quot; – cries
* &quot;saeng-saeng&quot; – is crying
* &quot;saeng-saeng-saeng&quot; – is still crying

Few languages employ triplication in their language. In Micronesia, Pingelapese is one of only two languages that uses triplication, the other being Mokilese. Reduplication and triplication are not to be confused with tense. In order to make a phrase past, present, or future tense, a temporal phrase must be used.

==== Rapa ====
Rapa is the French Polynesian language of the island of Rapa Iti. In terms of reduplication, the indigenous language known as Old Rapa uses reduplication consistent to other Polynesian languages. Reduplication of Old Rapa occurs in four ways: full, rightward, leftward, and medial. Full and rightward are generally more frequently used as opposed to the leftward and medial. Leftward and medial only occur as CV reduplication and partial leftward and medial usually denote emphasis.

Example of reduplication forms:

For the Rapa Language the implementation of reduplication has specific implications. The most evident of these are known as iterative, intensification, specification, diminutive, metaphorical, nominalizing, and adjectival.

Iterative:

* naku &#x27;come, go&#x27; → nakunaku &#x27;pass by frequently&#x27;
* ipuni &#x27;hide&#x27; → ipunipuni &#x27;hide and seek&#x27;

====Tagalog====
Philippine languages are characterized as having the most productive use of reduplication, especially in Tagalog (the basis of the Filipino language). Reduplication in Tagalog is complex. It can be roughly divided into six types:
#Monosyllabic; e.g. &quot;olol&quot; (&quot;mad&quot;)
#Reduplication of the final syllable; e.g. &quot;himaymay&quot; (&quot;separate meat from bones&quot;), from &quot;himay&quot; (same meaning)
#Reduplication of the final syllable of a disyllabic word, where the added syllable is created from the first consonant of the first syllable and the last consonant of the second syllable; e.g. &quot;kaliskis&quot; (&quot;[fish] scale&quot;), from &quot;kalis&quot; (&quot;to scrape&quot;)
#Reduplication of the initial syllable of the root; e.g. &quot;susulat&quot; (&quot;will write&quot;), from &quot;sulat&quot; (&quot;to write&quot;)
#Full reduplication; e.g. &quot;araw-araw&quot; (&quot;every day&quot;), from &quot;araw&quot; (&quot;day&quot; or &quot;sun&quot;)
#Combined partial and full reduplication; e.g. &quot;babalibaligtad&quot; (&quot;turning around continually&quot;, &quot;tumbling&quot;), from &quot;baligtad&quot; (&quot;reverse&quot;)

They can further be divided into &quot;non-significant&quot; (where its significance is not apparent) and &quot;significant&quot; reduplication. 1, 2, and 3 are always non-significant; while 5 and 6 are always significant. 4 can be non-significant when used for nouns (e.g. &quot;lalaki&quot;, &quot;man&quot;).

Full or partial reduplication among nouns and pronouns can indicate emphasis, intensity, plurality, or causation; as well as a diminutive, superlative, iterative, restrictive, or distributive force.

Adjectives and adverbs employ morphological reduplication for many different reasons such as number agreement when the adjective modifies a plural noun, intensification of the adjective or adverb, and sometimes because the prefix forces the adjective to have a reduplicated stem&quot;.

Number agreement for adjectives is entirely optional in Tagalog (e.g., a plural noun does not have to have a plural article marking it):
*&quot;Ang magandang puno&quot; &quot;the beautiful tree&quot;.
*&quot;Ang ma&quot;ga&quot;gandang puno&quot; &quot;the beautiful tree&quot;s&quot;&quot;.

The entire adjective is repeated for intensification of adjectives or adverbs:
*&quot;Maganda&quot;ng maganda ang kabayo &quot;the horse is &quot;very&quot; pretty&quot;

In verbs, reduplication of the root, prefix or infix is employed to convey different grammatical aspects. In &quot;Mag- verbs&quot; reduplication of the root after the prefix &quot;mag-&quot; or &quot;nag-&quot; changes the verb from the infinitive form, or perfective aspect, respectively, to the contemplated or imperfective aspect. Thus:
*magluto inf/actor trigger-cook &quot;to cook&quot; or &quot;cook!&quot; (imperative)
*nagluto actor trigger-cook &quot;cooked&quot;
*nagluluto actor trigger-reduplication-cook &quot;cook&quot; (as in &quot;I cook all the time) or &quot;is/was cooking&quot;
*magluluto inf/actor trigger-rdplc-cook (contemplated) &quot;will cook&quot;

For ergative verbs (frequently referred to as &quot;object focus&quot; verbs) reduplication of part the infix and the stem occur:
*lutuin cook-inf/object trigger-cook &quot;to cook&quot;
*niluto object trigger infix-cook (perf-cook) &quot;cooked&quot;
*niluluto object trigger infix-reduplication-cook &quot;cook&quot;/&quot;is/was cooking&quot;
*lulutuin rdp-cook-object trigger &quot;will cook&quot;.

The complete superlative prefix pagka- demands reduplication of the first syllable of the adjective&#x27;s stem:
*&quot;Ang pagka&quot;ga&quot;gandang puno&quot; &quot;The &quot;most&quot; beautiful tree (&quot;and there are none more beautiful anywhere&quot;)&quot;

====Wuvulu-Aua====
Reduplication is not a productive noun derivation process in Wuvulu-Aua as it is in other Austronesian languages. Some nouns exhibit reduplication, though they are considered to be fossilized.

Verb roots can undergo whole or partial reduplication to mark aspect. Actions that are continuous are indicated by a reduplicated initial syllable. A whole reduplication can also be used to indicate imperfective aspect.
* &quot;roni&quot; &quot;to hurry&quot;
* &quot;roroni&quot; &quot;hurrying&quot;
* &quot;rawani&quot; &quot;good&quot;
* &quot;rarawani&quot; &quot;good&quot; (continuous)
* &quot;ware&quot; &quot;talk&quot;
* &quot;wareware&quot; &quot;talked&quot; (durative)

The onomatopoeia in Wuvulu language also uses reduplication to describe the sound. These onomatopoeic words can be used as alienable nouns.
* &quot;baʔa&quot; or &quot;baʔabaʔa&quot; is a word for the sound of knocking.

===Austroasiatic===
====Vietnamese====


=== Sino-Tibetan ===

==== Burmese ====
As in many Tibeto-Burman languages, in Burmese, reduplication is used in verbs and adjectives to form adverbs. Many Burmese words, especially adjectives such as (&#x27;beautiful&#x27; ), which consist of two syllables (when reduplicated, each syllable is reduplicated separately), when reduplicated ( → &#x27;beautifully&#x27; ) become adverbs. This is also true of many Burmese verbs, which become adverbs when reduplicated.

Some nouns are also reduplicated to indicate plurality. For instance, , means &quot;country,&quot; but when reduplicated to , it means &quot;many countries&quot; (as in , &quot;international&quot;). Another example is , which means &quot;kinds,&quot; but the reduplicated form means &quot;multiple kinds.&quot;

A few measure words can also be reduplicated to indicate &quot;one or the other&quot;:

* (measure word for people) → (someone)
* (measure word for things) → (something)

====Chinese====
Reduplication is sometimes employed in verbs and adjectives to enhance the effect of them.

* () is a reduplicated form of ()
* () from ()

Similar to other Sino-Tibetan languages, adjectives form adverbs by reduplication.

* () is a reduplicated form of ()

Other than verbs and adjectives, some nouns can be reduplicated to express plurality or a collection in Chinese.

* () is derived from ().
* () is derived from ().

===Old Proto-Basque===
One of the puzzles of Basque is the large number of words that begin with vowels in which the initial and second vowels are the same. Joseba Lakarra proposes that in Pre-Proto-Basque there was extensive reduplication and that later, certain initial consonants were deleted, leaving the VCV pattern of Proto-Basque:

<text>Roussillon ( , , ; , ; ) was a historical province of France that largely corresponded to the County of Roussillon and part of the County of Cerdagne of the former Principality of Catalonia. It is part of the region of &quot;Northern Catalonia&quot; or &quot;French Catalonia&quot; (the former used by Catalan-speakers and the latter used by French-speakers), corresponding roughly to the present-day southern French &quot;département&quot; of Pyrénées-Orientales (with Roussillon, Upper Cerdagne, Capcir, Vallespir, Conflent, and Fenouillèdes) in the former region of Languedoc-Roussillon (today Occitanie).

==History==
The name &quot;Roussillon&quot; is derived from Ruscino (Rosceliona, Castel Rossello), a small fortified place near modern-day Perpignan where Gaulish chieftains met to consider Hannibal&#x27;s request for a conference. The region formed part of the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis from 121 BC to AD 462, when it was ceded with the rest of Septimania to the Visigoth Theodoric II. His successor, Amalaric, on his defeat by Childebert I in 531, retired to Hispania, leaving a governor in Septimania.

In 719, the Saracens crossed the Pyrenees and maintained political hegemony of Septimania until their final defeat in 759 by Pepin the Short, who went on to occupy Roussillon after conquering Narbonne. Roussillon was occupied by the Carolingians in 760. Upon the invasion of Hispania in 778, Charlemagne found the Marca Hispanica wasted by war and the inhabitants settled in the mountains. He granted some lands in the plains to Visigothic refugees from Moorish Hispania and founded several monasteries. In 792, the Saracens again invaded France, but they were repulsed by Count Guillaume of Toulouse – regent of the child Louis the Pious, King of Aquitaine – whose hegemony extended into Catalonia.

The different portions of his kingdom in time grew into allodial fiefs and, in 893, Sunyer II became the first hereditary count of Roussillon. But his rule only extended over the eastern part of what became the later province. The western part, the Cerdanya (French, Cerdagne), was ruled in 900 by Miró as first count, and one of his grandsons, Bernat, became the first hereditary count of the middle portion, or Besalú. The counts of Roussillon were allied to their cousins the counts of Empúries in a centuries-long conflict with the surrounding great nobles. Count Girard I participated in the First Crusade in the following of Raymond IV of Toulouse, and was one of the first to set foot in Jerusalem when it was stormed by the Crusaders in 1099. At the beginning of the 12th century, the prestige of the Counts of Barcelona began to rise to such a height that the Counts of Roussillon had no choice but to swear fealty to them.

In 1111, Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona, inherited the fief of Besalú, to which Cerdanya was added in 1117. The possession of Roussillon by its last count, Girard II, was challenged by his illegitimate brothers. To ensure that his brothers would not inherit his territories, in his will Girard II left all his lands to Alfonso II of Aragon, who took possession in 1172. Under the Aragonese monarchs, economic and demographic growth of the region continued, and Collioure (), the port of Perpignan, became an important locus of Mediterranean trade.

As the French and Aragonese crowns grew in power, the region of Roussillon, forming part of the border between them, was frequently a site of military conflict. By the Treaty of Corbeil (1258), Louis IX of France formally surrendered his claims of sovereignty over Roussillon and to the title of Count of Barcelona to the Crown of Aragon, recognizing a centuries-old reality.

James I of Aragon had wrested the Balearic Isles from the Moors and joined these islands with Roussillon to create the Kingdom of Majorca, with its capital at Perpignan. In 1276, James I granted this kingdom to his son, who became James II. The subsequent disputes of this monarch with his brother Peter III were exploited by Philip III of France in his quarrel with Peter III for the crown of the Two Sicilies. Philip III espoused James II&#x27;s cause and led an army into Catalonia but, retreating, died at Perpignan in 1285. Lacking the resources to continue the struggle, James then became reconciled to his brother Peter, and in 1311 the former was succeeded by his son Sanç I, or Sancho I, who founded the cathedral of Perpignan shortly before his death in 1324. His successor, James III of Majorca, refused to do homage to Philip VI of France for the seigneury of Montpellier, and applied to Peter IV of Aragon for aid. Peter not only refused, but declared war and seized Majorca and Roussillon in 1344.

The province was now reunited to the Principality of Catalonia within the Crown of Aragon, and it enjoyed peace until 1462. In that year, the disputes between John II of Aragon and his son over the Crown of Navarre spurred Louis XI of France to support John against his subjects, who had risen in revolt, the Catalan Civil War (1462-1472). The province, having been pledged as collateral to Louis for 300,000 crowns, was occupied by French troops until 1493, when Charles VIII evacuated the region as part of a settlement with Ferdinand the Catholic (son of John II of Aragon).

As part of a wider war (the Italian Wars), France and Spain clashed here between 1496 and 1498. Eventually the Spanish, under personal command of Ferdinand, not only secured Roussillon but managed to push into southern France before the new French monarch, Louis XII, signed the Treaty of Granada (1500).

The Habsburg dynasty took control of both the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1516 and the two crowns were for the first time ruled by the same physical person. This was under Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor (called Charles I of Spain), grandson of the Catholic Monarchs.
When Perpignan was besieged by the forces of Henry, Dauphin of France in 1542, the inhabitants were loyal to Charles V. Perpignan earned the royal sobriquet of &quot;Fedelissima&quot; (&quot;Most Faithful City&quot;).

When the Catalans rose against the Spanish Crown in 1640 (the Reapers&#x27; War), Louis XIII of France entered the conflict on the side of the former. After a protracted war, the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659) partitioned the Principality of Catalonia, securing Roussillon and part of the Cerdanya (Cerdagne) to the French crown, creating the French province of Roussillon.

The next fifty years saw a concerted effort by Louis XIV both to ensure the political allegiance of his new subjects and to alter their cultural identity. He was successful in the former but failed in the latter. Outside the capital of Perpignan, Roussillon remained distinctly Catalan in outlook and culture until the late nineteenth century, when industrialization began to replace Catalan identity with French.

During the French Revolution, the Ancien Régime province of Roussillon was abolished and a new department, the Department of Pyrénées-Orientales, was created instead. This department corresponds roughly to the old Roussillon, with the addition of the comarca of Fenouillèdes. Pyrénées-Orientales is the name by which this department is officially known in France. The old name of Roussillon did contribute to the French &quot;région&quot; of Languedoc-Roussillon.

<doc id="171410" wikidata="Q311238" url="?curid=171410" title="Sean Lennon">
<text>is a British-American musician, songwriter, and producer. He is the son of John Lennon and Yoko Ono, and half-brother to Julian Lennon. Over the course of his career, he has been a member of the bands Cibo Matto, The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger, The Claypool Lennon Delirium and his parents&#x27; group Plastic Ono Band. He has released two solo albums: &quot;Into the Sun&quot; (1998) and &quot;Friendly Fire&quot; (2006). He has produced numerous albums for various artists, including Black Lips and the Plastic Ono Band.

==Early life and education==
Sean Ono Lennon was born at Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan, New York City, on 9 October 1975, his father&#x27;s 35th birthday. He is of Japanese descent on his mother&#x27;s side and English, Welsh and Irish descent on his father&#x27;s side. Julian Lennon is his half-brother, and Kyoko Chan Cox is his half-sister. Elton John is his godfather. After Sean&#x27;s birth, John Lennon became a stay-at-home-dad to look after him. This lasted until John was murdered on December 8, 1980, when Sean was only five years old. 

Sean attended kindergarten in Tokyo and, at his request, was educated at the exclusive private boarding school Institut Le Rosey in Rolle, Switzerland, and earlier at New York&#x27;s private Ethical Culture Fieldston School and Dalton School. He attended Columbia University for three semesters, majoring in anthropology before dropping out to focus on his music and tour with his mother.

In October 1984, when Steve Jobs was visiting Manhattan, he attended Ono Lennon&#x27;s birthday party and gave him one of the first Macintosh computers as a present. That same year, he sang &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot; on &quot;Every Man Has a Woman&quot;, a tribute album to his mother.

His parents started his musical career: his debut into the music world came at age five, when he recited a story on his mother&#x27;s 1981 album, &quot;Season of Glass&quot;. From childhood into his teen years, Ono Lennon continued to collaborate with his mother, contributing vocals and receiving production credit on her solo albums &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot;, &quot;Starpeace&quot; and &quot;Onobox&quot;. At 16 Ono Lennon co-wrote the song &quot;All I Ever Wanted&quot; with Lenny Kravitz for his 1991 album &quot;Mama Said&quot;, and worked with Kravitz on a cover of his father&#x27;s song &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; in protest of the Gulf War. By 1995 Ono Lennon had formed the band IMA (with Sam Koppelman and Timo Ellis) to play alongside his mother on her album &quot;Rising&quot;. Ono Lennon also made appearances in film, featured in the cast of Michael Jackson&#x27;s 1988 &quot;Moonwalker&quot; and portraying a teenager experiencing visions of various M. C. Escher prints in Sony&#x27;s 1990 promotional short-film &quot;Infinite Escher&quot;.

Ono Lennon holds dual citizenship with the United States and United Kingdom.

==Professional career==
===Performance===

In 1996, Miho Hatori and Yuka Honda of Cibo Matto were invited by Ono to remix the song &quot;Talking to the Universe&quot; for a &quot;Rising&quot; remix EP &quot;Rising Mixes&quot;. They met Ono Lennon and invited him to join them on tour as a bass player. This eventually led to Ono Lennon&#x27;s contributing to their side-project Butter 08 and to his becoming a member of the group. He continued to play with them on tour, joining them on television and providing bass guitar and vocals on their EP &quot;Super Relax&quot;. Through his association with Cibo Matto, Ono Lennon was approached by Adam Yauch (of Beastie Boys), who expressed an interest in his music and persuaded him to sign a record contract with Grand Royal Records. Regarding Grand Royal, Ono Lennon has said:I think I found the only label on the planet who doesn&#x27;t care who my parents are and what my name is. It&#x27;s a good feeling to know that I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten the offer if they wouldn&#x27;t have liked my songs. That&#x27;s pretty rare in the music business!

Ono Lennon&#x27;s solo debut, &quot;Into the Sun&quot;, was released in 1998. A music video for &quot;Home&quot;, a single from the album, was directed by Spike Jonze and enjoyed extended airplay on MTV. The album was produced by fellow Cibo Matto member Yuka Honda, who Ono Lennon claimed was his inspiration for the album, who he had begun dating at the time.

He went on tour (often backed by Cibo Matto) supporting &quot;Into the Sun&quot;. During this period he appeared on radio programs such as &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; and KCRW&#x27;s &quot;Morning Becomes Eclectic&quot;. He later recalled promoting the album as a bitter experience due to the media focus on his family rather than his own music. In 1999, Ono Lennon&#x27;s EP &quot;Half Horse, Half Musician&quot; was released featuring new tracks such as &quot;Heart &amp; Lung&quot; and &quot;Happiness&quot; as well as remixes of songs from &quot;Into the Sun&quot;. Along with &quot;Half Horse Half Musician&quot;, 1999 saw the release of Cibo Matto&#x27;s second album &quot;Stereo Type A&quot;. Ono Lennon stepped out of his traditional role as the group&#x27;s bass player, this time playing a much wider range of instruments (such as drums, guitars, and synthesizers). Despite being well-received, &quot;Stereo Type A&quot; was followed by an extended Cibo Matto hiatus.

In 2000, Ono Lennon contributed vocals to Del tha Funkee Homosapien (a single stanza on the Deltron 3030 track &quot;Memory Loss&quot;), Handsome Boy Modeling School and Jurassic 5. In 2001 on national television, Ono Lennon performed several classics by the Beatles, &quot;This Boy&quot;, &quot;Across the Universe&quot; and &quot;Julia&quot; alongside Robert Schwartzman, Rufus Wainwright and Moby for &quot;Come Together: A Night for John Lennon&#x27;s Words and Music&quot;. In the following years, Ono Lennon faded out of the spotlight to focus more on his role as a producer.

 In 2000, Sean had a guest appearance on the Soulfly album &quot;Primitive&quot; on the song &quot;Son Song&quot;.
After the folding of Grand Royal Records in 2001, Ono Lennon signed with Capitol Records, yet no solo material surfaced until February 2006, when &quot;Dead Meat&quot; was released as the first single from his new album, &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;. A promotional trailer for the CD/DVD package of &quot;Friendly Fire&quot; was leaked online in early 2006. The trailer featured scenes from the film version of the album, a DVD of music videos comprised into a film. The videos were actually screen tests for Coin Locker Babies, another project on which Ono Lennon was working which became a cinematic counterpart to his new album.

&quot;Friendly Fire&quot; was released in October 2006. The theme of the album is love and betrayal, and it is dedicated to the memory of a close friend who died. The night the album was released, Ono Lennon made his first major television appearance in five years, performing &quot;Dead Meat&quot; live on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. Ono Lennon has since appeared on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and &quot;The Sharon Osbourne Show&quot;. When questioned about the eight-year gap between solo albums in interviews, Ono Lennon said that he did not feel like a solo artist during those years and that he wanted to experience music anonymously without the spotlight on him and his girlfriend.
Since the release of &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;, Ono Lennon has toured extensively around the world and while in France, he remixed his song &quot;Parachute&quot; in collaboration with French artist -M-. The remix is titled &quot;L&#x27;éclipse&quot; and was featured as a bonus track on the French release of &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;, while the single &quot;Dead Meat&quot; was featured in an episode of the TV drama &quot;True Blood&quot;.

With the release of new material and subsequent touring Ono Lennon launched a website featuring music, videos, and a forum for his fans. Various members of the forum have created a fan-made cover album titled &quot;Truth Mask Replica&quot;.

Muhl and Ono Lennon premiered the band the Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger during a live performance at Radio City on Valentine&#x27;s Day, 2008. The duo, commonly referred to as the GOASTT, released their debut single, &quot;Jardin Du Luxembourg&quot;, on 6 July 2010, and their debut album, &quot;Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger (Acoustic Sessions)&quot;, on 26 October 2010, both on Chimera, their own label. In conjunction with the debut, they performed six songs during an hour-long interview on WNYC and four songs for a Tiny Desk Concert on NPR. Ono Lennon has also collaborated with Muhl with a group called &quot;Kemp and Eden&quot; who premiered at The Living Room in the spring of 2012. On April 29, 2014, the Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger released their most successful album to date, titled &quot;Midnight Sun&quot;. The album was selected as one of the Top 50 best albums of 2014 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The album&#x27;s release was followed by tours with the Flaming Lips, Tame Impala, Beck, Florence and the Machine, Dinosaur Jr., and Primus.

At the end of 2018, Ono Lennon collaborated with Miley Cyrus and Mark Ronson for a cover of Yoko Ono and John Lennon&#x27;s original Christmas song &quot;Happy Xmas (War is Over).&quot; The trio additionally performed the song at the Winter finale of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

In 2015, playing lead guitar, Ono Lennon formed the Claypool Lennon Delirium with Primus&#x27; lead vocalist and bassist Les Claypool. The following year, the new group released their debut album, &quot;Monolith of Phobos&quot;, which reached the Top 10 of three &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, followed by a covers EP titled &quot;Lime and Limpid Green&quot; in 2017. Their second album, &quot;South of Reality&quot;, was released on 22 February 2019.

===Production and other contributions===

While reestablishing himself as a solo artist, Lennon continued his work as a session musician and producer, lending his talent to the likes of Dopo Yume, Albert Hammond, Jr. (of the Strokes) and model/singer Irina Lăzăreanu. Lennon first appeared on the Soulfly album &quot;Primitive&quot;, released in 2000, while in October 2007, Lennon joined Mark Ronson in the BBC Electric Proms where he sang &quot;Sail on, Sailor&quot;, as well as &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; alongside Daniel Merriweather, and Tawiah. The year prior, he wrote and directed his first film, &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;, starring Carrie Fisher, Lindsay Lohan and others. His eponymous second studio LP served as the film&#x27;s soundtrack as well.

In 2009, Lennon produced a second album for his mother on his record label Chimera Music, &quot;Between My Head and the Sky&quot;, by Yoko Ono and the Plastic Ono Band. Lennon further worked with Ono as a producer for John Malkovich&#x27;s 2016 remix EP &quot;Illuminated&quot;. Lennon co-produced Fat White Family&#x27;s 2016 album &quot;Songs for Our Mothers&quot;, which was recorded in his New York City recording studio. Lennon also lent his production and songwriting talents to Lana Del Rey&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, where he featured on the track &quot;Tomorrow Never Came&quot;.
Lennon entered the field of film scores in 2009 with &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Undead&quot;, directed by long-time friend and school mate Jordan Galland. Lennon again collaborated with Galland as he contributed the score to the 2012 film &quot;Alter Egos&quot;, and appeared as the character &quot;Electric Death.&quot; The soundtrack premiered on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s website following the film&#x27;s release. In 2014, Lennon contributed the song &quot;Animals&quot; for the &quot;Zombeavers&quot; soundtrack, while he additionally wrote and recorded &quot;Heart Grenade&quot; for the Japanese anime TV series &quot;Ghost in the Shell: Arise&quot;. Lennon also created the film score for the 2015 comedy horror film &quot;Ava&#x27;s Possessions&quot;, a project which took over two years to create. The lead single from the soundtrack &quot;Demon Daughter&quot; premiered alongside the film&#x27;s DVD release.

Along with girlfriend Charlotte Kemp Muhl, Lennon started a record label, Chimera Music, which has signed a number of his collaborators including the Moonlandingz, Cibo Matto and Yoko Ono.

On April 12, 2024, James McCartney, son of Paul McCartney, released a song called &quot;Primrose Hill&quot; with Sean being credited as a composer and songwriter, marking their first collaboration.

Lennon is credited as co-producer for one song (&quot;In the Eyes of the Girl&quot;) on the fifth studio album by The Lemon Twigs, &quot;A Dream Is All We Know&quot;, and is credited as playing bass guitar on the same track.

== Activism and beliefs ==
From 1996 to 1999, Ono Lennon performed in and was involved in organizing the Tibetan Freedom Concerts with Adam Yauch of the Beastie Boys. The series advocated for the independence of Tibet from China.

On October 19, 2011, Ono Lennon was asked by Josh Sigurdson over Twitter what his opinion on the Occupy Wall Street protests was. He replied: &quot;I&#x27;m heading down there this weekend.&quot; On October 22, 2011, Lennon showed up on Wall Street with Rufus Wainwright and Josh Fox. The three played music throughout the day to protesters and others joined in. Ono Lennon did not speak to the media or press about the event.
On August 28, 2012, Ono Lennon&#x27;s opposition to hydraulic fracking was published as an op-ed article, &quot;Destroying Precious Land for Gas&quot;, by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Of Artists Against Fracking, in 2014 he said that &quot;we can make more people aware of the damage fracking poses to our water supply, global warming, and climate change. Methane is 100 times more powerful of a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide and most people don&#x27;t realize how climate change will be triggered by a globalized fracking industry.&quot; On August 30, 2012, Ono Lennon unveiled &quot;Artists Against Fracking&quot;, a campaign aimed at preventing the expansion of fracking in the United States. Over 200 artists have signed onto the initiative, including Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway, as well as Beatles&#x27; members Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr.

Asked by the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; for his view of religion and spirituality, Ono Lennon said: &quot;I&#x27;m not against religion, because I think it serves a purpose in our society and it can be helpful to certain groups of people. But, for me, religion is mythology. ... I do think we all have a spirit, and I think there&#x27;s a lot more to life and human consciousness than science can explain. But I prefer looking to science for answers because it can be tested and vigorously logical.&quot; On October 16, 2013, Ono Lennon, along with Spacehog and Liv Tyler, played &quot;Live on Earth&quot; – an Internet-only performance – to benefit the David Lynch Foundation, which funds the teaching of Transcendental Meditation. Of his own practice of Transcendental Meditation, in 2014, Ono Lennon said that &quot;for me, it&#x27;s like a scientific method to calm my brain down and making my frontal lobe more active. It&#x27;s an exercise, really. It helps me to have about 10 percent more conscious thinking.&quot;

Ono Lennon once described himself as a pacifist, capitalist, and anarchist; on February 6, 2016, he tweeted, &quot;AnCap is the only logical result of the non aggression [principle]. I am a pacifist so therefore an anarchist.&quot;

==Personal life==

Ono Lennon is in a relationship with Charlotte Kemp Muhl, whom he met at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2005. In an interview, Ono Lennon states he stumbled upon Muhl&#x27;s musical talents over a year after they had started dating, and formed The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger around 2008. Muhl and Ono Lennon are involved in several musical endeavors and much of their work is written at their home-based studio in Greenwich Village, New York.

<doc id="171411" wikidata="Q1244600" url="?curid=171411" title="Robbers' rummy">
<text>Robbers&#x27; rummy is a card game for two or more players. It is a variant of German Rummy dating to the early 20th century. Being derived from normal rummy, it emphasises arrangement of cards based on card matching rules (generally simplified, but thereby no less challenging), while abandoning the notions of card discards and scoring entirely.

== Description ==
In Robbers&#x27; Rummy, not only are players allowed to lay off to existing melds as in basic Rummy, but they may also completely recombine the cards contained in the melds. In other words, players may &#x27;rob&#x27; cards from already-made melds to make new ones. This makes it &quot;much more exciting and engaging than any other [Rummy] variant...&quot;. Danyliuk describes it as &quot;a fun, but difficult, variant of Rummy.&quot;

==Object==
The aim of Robber&#x27;s Rummy is to be the first player to discard all the cards in hand by forming melds and placing them on table.

== Cards ==
Robbers&#x27; rummy is played using two standard 52-card French packs, and 2 to 6 jokers.

==Play==
Initially, each player is dealt 11 to 13 cards from the shuffled pack, whose remainder, called the &quot;stock&quot; is placed face-down on the table. The goal of each player is to reduce the number of cards held in hand by placing them on the table, face-up, forming melds. A &quot;meld&quot; is:

*Either any sequence by rank of three or more cards of the same suit (where the &quot;King&quot; may be followed by &quot;Ace&quot;, and &quot;2&quot;, and so on),
*Any three or four cards of equal rank, but of distinct suits.

Any one &quot;Joker&quot; card used within a meld must be identified as one card of appropriate rank and suit.

At each turn, a player may place one or more cards from their own hand on the table, such that melds are formed (or extended). For this purpose, each player may rearrange any or all melds on the table, including, if necessary, by reassigning the identification of &quot;Joker&quot; cards; provided all cards on the table form melds eventually, in completion of the placement. All cards which were on the table, before the placement of the own cards from hand, must remain on the table.

An essential point to recognize is that any meld consisting of four cards may be reduced to an equally regular three-card meld by removing or &quot;robbing&quot; one card, which in turn may be used to form other melds. The name &quot;Robbers&#x27; rummy&quot; reflects the characterization, by proponents of normal rummy, of such liberty in playing this game as excessive, or even &quot;offensive.&quot;

Examples of valid melds:
* On the table are ; Ann holds the second in her hand. She can now take the and the from the table and make a new meld with her .
* On the table lie the and ; Ben holds , and in his hand. He can now combine these cards together with the table cards to form new melds as follows: , and .

Any jokers on the table may be re-used to represent a different card without having to be exchanged as in German Rummy, for example.

A player who was unable or disinclined to place at least one card from their own hand on the table accordingly, must draw one card from the stock into the hand. Alternatively, a player who did place one or more own cards on the table may draw one card from the stock, or must otherwise yield to the next player right away. After having drawn one card, the player at turn may still place any one or more cards on the table, and must then yield to the next player without drawing another card.

Danyliuk includes 2 additional rules:

* The top card of the discard pile may only be used if it is immediately laid off or melded; it must not be added to the hand.
* The player&#x27;s first meld must score 40 points; cards may be laid off to existing melds in order to reach this total. To do this card values are assigned as follows: A = 1 or 11 depending on position, KQJ = 10 each, pips = 2-9 depending on face value.

== Ending ==
The first player to meld or lay off all held cards is the winner.

<text>An engineering drawing is a type of technical drawing that is used to convey information about an object. A common use is to specify the geometry necessary for the construction of a component and is called a detail drawing. Usually, a number of drawings are necessary to completely specify even a simple component. These drawings are linked together by a &quot;master drawing.&quot; This &quot;master drawing&quot; is more commonly known as an assembly drawing. The assembly drawing gives the &quot;drawing numbers&quot; of the subsequent detailed components, quantities required, construction materials and possibly 3D images that can be used to locate individual items. Although mostly consisting of pictographic representations, abbreviations and symbols are used for brevity and additional textual explanations may also be provided to convey the necessary information.

The process of producing engineering drawings is often referred to as technical drawing or drafting (draughting). Drawings typically contain multiple views of a component, although additional &quot;scratch views&quot; may be added of &quot;details&quot; for further explanation. Only the information that is a &quot;requirement&quot; is typically specified. Key information such as &quot;dimensions&quot; is usually only specified in one place on a drawing, avoiding redundancy and the possibility of inconsistency. Suitable tolerances are given for critical dimensions to allow the component to be manufactured and function. More detailed production drawings may be produced based on the information given in an engineering drawing. Drawings have an information box or &quot;title block&quot; containing who drew the drawing, who approved it, units of dimensions, meaning of views, the title of the drawing and the drawing number.

==History==
As a necessary means for visually conveying ideas, technical drawing has been in one form or another a part of human history since antiquity. The use of these early drawings was to express architectural and engineering concepts for large cultural structures: the temples, monuments, and public infrastructure. Basic forms of technical drawing were used by the Egyptians and Mesopotamians to create highly detailed irrigation systems, pyramids, and other such sophisticated structures. But their methods were, comparatively easy, yet needed a great deal of skill and accuracy. Even in their primitive form, they gave the construction a drawing for structures that would stand the test of time.

With the invention of technical drawing in ancient Greece and Rome technical drawing, they have further evolved. Works by Vitruvius and other engineers and architects such as Vitruvius used drawings as a medium for the transmission of construction techniques, and the illustration of the basic principles of balance and proportion in architecture. Early examples of what would lead to more formal technical drawing practices included the drawings and geometric calculations used to construct aqueducts, bridges, and fortresses. Technical drawings also figured in the 12th-century design of cathedrals and castles, albeit such drawings were more typically produced by artisans and stonemasons, not formally trained engineers.

The Renaissance was a period of great success for technical drawing. These inventive artists and inventors were starting to use sophisticated methods of visual representation within their work as well as a methodical adherence to accuracy. His notebooks contained drawings of mechanical devices anatomical studies, and engineering projects that demonstrated his advanced understanding of form, function, and proportion, as elucidated by his notebooks. Perhaps he was the first of the pioneers who combined the arts with engineering ability to produce technical drawings at once imaginative and instructive. It was an important foundation for future developments in technical drawing work.

As the Industrial Revolution took hold, modern engineering drawing took shape with the emergence of strictly specified conventions like drawing in orthographic projection, exploding, and standard scales. Part of the movement towards standardization was somewhat triggered by the development of engineering education and uniform drawing techniques in France. During the same period, the French mathematician Gaspard Monge developed descriptive geometry, a means of representing three-dimensional objects in two-dimensional space, and contributed to technical drawing in a major way. His work set the ground for orthographic projection which is one of the core techniques to be used in technical drawing today. Monge&#x27;s methods were disseminated initially as a military secret, then far and wide, and his methods shaped the future of engineering education, and also the engineering practice.

Further contributions to the craft of technical drawing were made by pioneers like Marc Isambard Brunel. L. T. C. Rolt&#x27;s biography of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, to whom Marc contributed in 1799 with his detailed drawings of block-making machinery, testified to the developing nature of British engineering methods. By applying what we now call mechanical drawing techniques to depict three-dimensional machinery on a two-dimensional plane more efficient manufacturing processes as well as greater precision were enabled. These innovations were essential as the world began to move toward mechanized production, and complex engineering projects, such as bridges, railways, and ships, required highly detailed and accurate technical representations to succeed.

This increasing need for a degree of precision in technical drawings during the 19th century was a direct result of the Industrial Revolution. In this era, we have seen the development of large-scale engineering projects such as railways, steam engines, and iron structures which require a heightened degree of accuracy and standardization. New conventions and symbols were created by engineers; the use of which became standardized throughout industries, so that any person who could read a technical drawing could know the specifications of a component or structure. The standardization process helped engineer practices to become standardized, making it easier for engineers, manufacturers, and builders to work together.

In the 20th century, technical drawing underwent yet another transformation with the introduction of drafting tools such as the T-square, compasses, and protractors. These tools helped drafters achieve the high degree of precision necessary for increasingly complex projects, such as skyscrapers, airplanes, and automobiles. The establishment of standards such as the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) further formalized technical drawing conventions, ensuring consistency in engineering practices around the world.

Today, technical drawing has largely transitioned from manual drafting to computer-aided design (CAD). CAD software has revolutionized the way technical drawings are created, allowing for faster, more precise, and easily modifiable drawings. Engineers can now visualize designs in three dimensions, simulate performance, and make adjustments before any physical prototype is built. This digital transformation has not only increased efficiency but also broadened the possibilities for innovation, enabling engineers to tackle challenges that were previously unimaginable.

However, despite the advent of digital tools, the fundamental principles of technical drawing remain rooted in its history. Precision, clarity, and the ability to convey complex information visually are still at the core of technical drawing. The conventions established over centuries—from orthographic projection to the use of scale and dimension lines—continue to be essential in modern engineering and architectural practice. The evolution of technical drawing is a testament to human ingenuity, demonstrating how the ability to convey complex ideas visually has been pivotal in the advancement of civilization.

==Standardization and disambiguation==

Engineering drawings specify the requirements of a component or assembly which can be complicated. Standards provide rules for their specification and interpretation. Standardization also aids internationalization, because people from different countries who speak different languages can read the same engineering drawing, and interpret it the same way.

One major set of engineering drawing standards is ASME Y14.5 and Y14.5M (most recently revised in 2018). These apply widely in the United States, although ISO 8015 (Geometrical product specifications (GPS) — Fundamentals — Concepts, principles and rules) is now also important. In 2018, ASME AED-1 was created to develop advanced practices unique to aerospace and other industries and supplement to Y14.5 Standards.

In 2011, a new revision of ISO 8015 (Geometrical product specifications (GPS) — Fundamentals — Concepts, principles and rules) was published containing the Invocation Principle. This states that, &quot;Once a portion of the ISO geometric product specification (GPS) system is invoked in a mechanical engineering product documentation, the entire ISO GPS system is invoked.&quot; It also goes on to state that marking a drawing &quot;Tolerancing ISO 8015&quot; is optional. The implication of this is that any drawing using ISO symbols can only be interpreted to ISO GPS rules. The only way not to invoke the ISO GPS system is to invoke a national or other standard. Britain, BS 8888 (Technical Product Specification) has undergone important updates in the 2010s.

==Media==

For centuries, until the 1970s, all engineering drawing was done manually by using pencil and pen on paper or other substrate (e.g., vellum, mylar). Since the advent of computer-aided design (CAD), engineering drawing has been done more and more in the electronic medium with each passing decade. Today most engineering drawing is done with CAD, but pencil and paper have not entirely disappeared.

Some of the tools of manual drafting include pencils, pens and their ink, straightedges, T-squares, French curves, triangles, rulers, protractors, dividers, compasses, scales, erasers, and tacks or push pins. (Slide rules used to number among the supplies, too, but nowadays even manual drafting, when it occurs, benefits from a pocket calculator or its onscreen equivalent.) And of course the tools also include drawing boards (drafting boards) or tables. The English idiom &quot;to go back to the drawing board&quot;, which is a figurative phrase meaning to rethink something altogether, was inspired by the literal act of discovering design errors during production and returning to a drawing board to revise the engineering drawing. Drafting machines are devices that aid manual drafting by combining drawing boards, straightedges, pantographs, and other tools into one integrated drawing environment. CAD provides their virtual equivalents.

Producing drawings usually involves creating an original that is then reproduced, generating multiple copies to be distributed to the shop floor, vendors, company archives, and so on. The classic reproduction methods involved blue and white appearances (whether white-on-blue or blue-on-white), which is why engineering drawings were long called, and even today are still often called, &quot;blueprints&quot; or &quot;bluelines&quot;, even though those terms are anachronistic from a literal perspective, since most copies of engineering drawings today are made by more modern methods (often inkjet or laser printing) that yield black or multicolour lines on white paper. The more generic term &quot;print&quot; is now in common usage in the US to mean any paper copy of an engineering drawing. In the case of CAD drawings, the original is the CAD file, and the printouts of that file are the &quot;prints&quot;.

== Systems of dimensioning and tolerancing ==

Almost all engineering drawings (except perhaps reference-only views or initial sketches) communicate not only geometry (shape and location) but also dimensions and tolerances for those characteristics. Several systems of dimensioning and tolerancing have evolved. The simplest dimensioning system just specifies distances between points (such as an object&#x27;s length or width, or hole center locations). Since the advent of well-developed interchangeable manufacture, these distances have been accompanied by tolerances of the plus-or-minus or min-and-max-limit types. &quot;Coordinate dimensioning&quot; involves defining all points, lines, planes, and profiles in terms of Cartesian coordinates, with a common origin. Coordinate dimensioning was the sole best option until the post-World War II era saw the development of geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&amp;T), which departs from the limitations of coordinate dimensioning (e.g., rectangular-only tolerance zones, tolerance stacking) to allow the most logical tolerancing of both geometry and dimensions (that is, both form [shapes/locations] and sizes).

== Common features ==
Drawings convey the following critical information:

* &quot;Geometry&quot; – the shape of the object; represented as views; how the object will look when it is viewed from various angles, such as front, top, side, etc.
* &quot;Dimensions&quot; – the size of the object is captured in accepted units.
* &quot;Tolerances&quot; – the allowable variations for each dimension.
* &quot;Material&quot; – represents what the item is made of.
* &quot;Finish&quot; – specifies the surface quality of the item, functional or cosmetic. For example, a mass-marketed product usually requires a much higher surface quality than, say, a component that goes inside industrial machinery.

=== Line styles and types ===

A variety of line styles graphically represent physical objects. Types of &quot;lines&quot; include the following:
* &quot;visible&quot; – are continuous lines used to depict edges directly visible from a particular angle.
* &quot;hidden&quot; – are short-dashed lines that may be used to represent edges that are not directly visible.
* &quot;center&quot; – are alternately long- and short-dashed lines that may be used to represent the axes of circular features.
* &quot;cutting plane&quot; – are thin, medium-dashed lines, or thick alternately long- and double short-dashed that may be used to define sections for section views.
* &quot;section&quot; – are thin lines in a pattern (pattern determined by the material being &quot;cut&quot; or &quot;sectioned&quot;) used to indicate surfaces in section views resulting from &quot;cutting&quot;. Section lines are commonly referred to as &quot;cross-hatching&quot;.
* &quot;phantom&quot; – (not shown) are alternately long- and double short-dashed thin lines used to represent a feature or component that is not part of the specified part or assembly. E.g. billet ends that may be used for testing, or the machined product that is the focus of a tooling drawing.

Lines can also be classified by a letter classification in which each line is given a letter.
* Type A lines show the outline of the feature of an object. They are the thickest lines on a drawing and done with a pencil softer than HB.
* Type B lines are dimension lines and are used for dimensioning, projecting, extending, or leaders. A harder pencil should be used, such as a 2H pencil.
* Type C lines are used for breaks when the whole object is not shown. These are freehand drawn and only for short breaks. 2H pencil
* Type D lines are similar to Type C, except these are zigzagged and only for longer breaks. 2H pencil
* Type E lines indicate hidden outlines of internal features of an object. These are dotted lines. 2H pencil
* Type F lines are Type E lines, except these are used for drawings in electrotechnology. 2H pencil
* Type G lines are used for centre lines. These are dotted lines, but a long line of 10–20 mm, then a 1 mm gap, then a small line of 2 mm. 2H pencil
* Type H lines are the same as type G, except that every second long line is thicker. These indicate the cutting plane of an object. 2H pencil 
* Type K lines indicate the alternate positions of an object and the line taken by that object. These are drawn with a long line of 10–20 mm, then a small gap, then a small line of 2 mm, then a gap, then another small line. 2H pencil.

===Multiple views and projections===


In most cases, a single view is not sufficient to show all necessary features, and several views are used. Types of &quot;views&quot; include the following:

==== Multiview projection ====
A &quot;multiview projection&quot; is a type of orthographic projection that shows the object as it looks from the front, right, left, top, bottom, or back (e.g. the &quot;primary views&quot;), and is typically positioned relative to each other according to the rules of either first-angle or third-angle projection. The origin and vector direction of the projectors (also called projection lines) differs, as explained below. 
* In &quot;first-angle projection&quot;, the parallel projectors originate as if radiated &quot;from behind the viewer&quot; and pass through the 3D object to project a 2D image onto the orthogonal plane &quot;behind&quot; it. The 3D object is projected into 2D &quot;paper&quot; space as if you were looking at a radiograph of the object: the top view is under the front view, the right view is at the left of the front view. First-angle projection is the ISO standard and is primarily used in Europe.
* In &quot;third-angle projection&quot;, the parallel projectors originate as if radiated &quot;from the far side of the object&quot; and pass through the 3D object to project a 2D image onto the orthogonal plane &quot;in front of&quot; it. The views of the 3D object are like the panels of a box that envelopes the object, and the panels pivot as they open up flat into the plane of the drawing. Thus the left view is placed on the left and the top view on the top; and the features closest to the front of the 3D object will appear closest to the front view in the drawing. Third-angle projection is primarily used in the United States and Canada, where it is the default projection system according to ASME standard ASME Y14.3M.

Until the late 19th century, first-angle projection was the norm in North America as well as Europe; but circa the 1890s, third-angle projection spread throughout the North American engineering and manufacturing communities to the point of becoming a widely followed convention, and it was an ASA standard by the 1950s. Circa World War I, British practice was frequently mixing the use of both projection methods.

As shown above, the determination of what surface constitutes the front, back, top, and bottom varies depending on the projection method used.

Not all views are necessarily used. Generally only as many views are used as are necessary to convey all needed information clearly and economically. The front, top, and right-side views are commonly considered the core group of views included by default, but any combination of views may be used depending on the needs of the particular design. In addition to the six principal views (front, back, top, bottom, right side, left side), any auxiliary views or sections may be included as serve the purposes of part definition and its communication. View lines or section lines (lines with arrows marked &quot;A-A&quot;, &quot;B-B&quot;, etc.) define the direction and location of viewing or sectioning. Sometimes a note tells the reader in which zone(s) of the drawing to find the view or section.

==== Auxiliary views ====
An &quot;auxiliary view&quot; is an orthographic view that is projected into any plane other than one of the six &quot;primary views&quot;. These views are typically used when an object contains some sort of inclined plane. Using the auxiliary view allows for that inclined plane (and any other significant features) to be projected in their true size and shape. The true size and shape of any feature in an engineering drawing can only be known when the Line of Sight (LOS) is perpendicular to the plane being referenced.
It is shown like a three-dimensional object. Auxiliary views tend to make use of axonometric projection. When existing all by themselves, auxiliary views are sometimes known as &quot;pictorials&quot;.

==== Isometric projection ====
An isometric projection shows the object from angles in which the scales along each axis of the object are equal. Isometric projection corresponds to rotation of the object by ± 45° about the vertical axis, followed by rotation of approximately ± 35.264° [= arcsin(tan(30°))] about the horizontal axis starting from an orthographic projection view. &quot;Isometric&quot; comes from the Greek for &quot;same measure&quot;. One of the things that makes isometric drawings so attractive is the ease with which 60° angles can be constructed with only a compass and straightedge.

Isometric projection is a type of axonometric projection. The other two types of axonometric projection are:
* Dimetric projection
* Trimetric projection

==== Oblique projection ====
An oblique projection is a simple type of graphical projection used for producing pictorial, two-dimensional images of three-dimensional objects: 
* it projects an image by intersecting parallel rays (projectors)
* from the three-dimensional source object with the drawing surface (projection plan).
In both oblique projection and orthographic projection, parallel lines of the source object produce parallel lines in the projected image.

==== Perspective projection ====
Perspective is an approximate representation on a flat surface, of an image as it is perceived by the eye. The two most characteristic features of perspective are that objects are drawn:
* Smaller as their distance from the observer increases
* Foreshortened: the size of an object&#x27;s dimensions along the line of sight are relatively shorter than dimensions across the line of sight.

==== Section Views ====
Projected views (either Auxiliary or Multi view) which show a cross section of the source object along the specified cut plane. These views are commonly used to show internal features with more clarity than regular projections or hidden lines, it also helps reducing number of hidden lines.In assembly drawings, hardware components (e.g. nuts, screws, washers) are typically not sectioned. Section view is a half side view of object.

=== Scale ===

Plans are usually &quot;scale drawings&quot;, meaning that the plans are drawn at specific ratio relative to the actual size of the place or object. Various scales may be used for different drawings in a set. For example, a floor plan may be drawn at 1:50 (1:48 or ″ = 1′ 0″) whereas a detailed view may be drawn at 1:25 (1:24 or ″ = 1′ 0″). Site plans are often drawn at 1:200 or 1:100.

Scale is a nuanced subject in the use of engineering drawings. On one hand, it is a general principle of engineering drawings that they are projected using standardized, mathematically certain projection methods and rules. Thus, great effort is put into having an engineering drawing accurately depict size, shape, form, aspect ratios between features, and so on. And yet, on the other hand, there is another general principle of engineering drawing that nearly diametrically opposes all this effort and intent—that is, the principle that &quot;users are not to scale the drawing to infer a dimension not labeled.&quot; This stern admonition is often repeated on drawings, via a boilerplate note in the title block telling the user, &quot;DO NOT SCALE DRAWING.&quot;

The explanation for why these two nearly opposite principles can coexist is as follows. The first principle—that drawings will be made so carefully and accurately—serves the prime goal of why engineering drawing even exists, which is successfully communicating part definition and acceptance criteria—including &quot;what the part should look like if you&#x27;ve made it correctly.&quot; The service of this goal is what creates a drawing that one even &quot;could&quot; scale and get an accurate dimension thereby. And thus the great temptation to do so, when a dimension is wanted but was not labeled. The second principle—that even though scaling the drawing &quot;will&quot; usually work, one should nevertheless &quot;never&quot; do it—serves several goals, such as enforcing total clarity regarding who has authority to discern design intent, and preventing erroneous scaling of a drawing that was never drawn to scale to begin with (which is typically labeled &quot;drawing not to scale&quot; or &quot;scale: NTS&quot;). When a user is forbidden from scaling the drawing, they must turn instead to the engineer (for the answers that the scaling would seek), and they will never erroneously scale something that is inherently unable to be accurately scaled.

But in some ways, the advent of the CAD and MBD era challenges these assumptions that were formed many decades ago. When part definition is defined mathematically via a solid model, the assertion that one cannot interrogate the model—the direct analog of &quot;scaling the drawing&quot;—becomes ridiculous; because when part definition is defined this way, it is not &quot;possible&quot; for a drawing or model to be &quot;not to scale&quot;. A 2D pencil drawing can be inaccurately foreshortened and skewed (and thus not to scale), yet still be a completely valid part definition as long as the labeled dimensions are the only dimensions used, and no scaling of the drawing by the user occurs. This is because what the drawing and labels convey is in reality a &quot;symbol&quot; of what is wanted, rather than a true &quot;replica&quot; of it. (For example, a sketch of a hole that is clearly not round still accurately defines the part as having a true round hole, as long as the label says &quot;10mm DIA&quot;, because the &quot;DIA&quot; implicitly but objectively tells the user that the skewed drawn circle is a symbol &quot;representing&quot; a perfect circle.) But if a mathematical model—essentially, a vector graphic—is declared to be the official definition of the part, then any amount of &quot;scaling the drawing&quot; can make sense; there may still be an error in the model, in the sense that what was &quot;intended&quot; is not &quot;depicted&quot; (modeled); but there can be no error of the &quot;not to scale&quot; type—because the mathematical vectors and curves are replicas, not symbols, of the part features.

Even in dealing with 2D drawings, the manufacturing world has changed since the days when people paid attention to the scale ratio claimed on the print, or counted on its accuracy. In the past, prints were plotted on a plotter to exact scale ratios, and the user could know that a line on the drawing 15 mm long corresponded to a 30 mm part dimension because the drawing said &quot;1:2&quot; in the &quot;scale&quot; box of the title block. Today, in the era of ubiquitous desktop printing, where original drawings or scaled prints are often scanned on a scanner and saved as a PDF file, which is then printed at any percent magnification that the user deems handy (such as &quot;fit to paper size&quot;), users have pretty much given up caring what scale ratio is claimed in the &quot;scale&quot; box of the title block. Which, under the rule of &quot;do not scale drawing&quot;, never really did that much for them anyway.

=== Showing dimensions ===
The required sizes of features are conveyed through use of &quot;dimensions.&quot; Distances may be indicated with either of two standardized forms of dimension: linear and ordinate.
* With &quot;linear&quot; dimensions, two parallel lines, called &quot;extension lines,&quot; spaced at the distance between two features, are shown at each of the features. A line perpendicular to the extension lines, called a &quot;dimension line,&quot; with arrows at its endpoints, is shown between, and terminating at, the extension lines. The distance is indicated numerically at the midpoint of the dimension line, either adjacent to it, or in a gap provided for it.
* With &quot;ordinate&quot; dimensions, one horizontal and one vertical extension line establish an origin for the entire view. The origin is identified with zeroes placed at the ends of these extension lines. Distances along the x- and y-axes to other features are specified using other extension lines, with the distances indicated numerically at their ends.
Sizes of circular features are indicated using either diametral or radial dimensions. Radial dimensions use an &quot;R&quot; followed by the value for the radius; Diametral dimensions use a circle with forward-leaning diagonal line through it, called the &quot;diameter symbol&quot;, followed by the value for the diameter. A radially-aligned line with arrowhead pointing to the circular feature, called a &quot;leader&quot;, is used in conjunction with both diametral and radial dimensions.
All types of dimensions are typically composed of two parts: the &quot;nominal&quot; value, which is the &quot;ideal&quot; size of the feature, and the &quot;tolerance&quot;, which specifies the amount that the value may vary above and below the nominal.
* Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing is a method of specifying the functional geometry of an object.

=== Sizes of drawings ===


Sizes of drawings typically comply with either of two different standards, ISO (World Standard) or ANSI/ASME Y14.1 (American).

The metric drawing sizes correspond to international paper sizes. These developed further refinements in the second half of the twentieth century, when photocopying became cheap. Engineering drawings could be readily doubled (or halved) in size and put on the next larger (or, respectively, smaller) size of paper with no waste of space. And the metric technical pens were chosen in sizes so that one could add detail or drafting changes with a pen width changing by approximately a factor of the square root of 2. A full set of pens would have the following nib sizes: 0.13, 0.18, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mm. However, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) called for four pen widths and set a colour code for each: 0.25 (white), 0.35 (yellow), 0.5 (brown), 0.7 (blue); these nibs produced lines that related to various text character heights and the ISO paper sizes.

All ISO paper sizes have the same aspect ratio, one to the square root of 2, meaning that a document designed for any given size can be enlarged or reduced to any other size and will fit perfectly. Given this ease of changing sizes, it is of course common to copy or print a given document on different sizes of paper, especially within a series, e.g. a drawing on A3 may be enlarged to A2 or reduced to A4.

The US customary &quot;A-size&quot; corresponds to &quot;letter&quot; size, and &quot;B-size&quot; corresponds to &quot;ledger&quot; or &quot;tabloid&quot; size. There were also once British paper sizes, which went by names rather than alphanumeric designations.

American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) ANSI/ASME Y14.1, Y14.2, Y14.3, and Y14.5 are commonly referenced standards in the US.

=== Technical lettering ===
Technical lettering is the process of forming letters, numerals, and other characters in technical drawing. It is used to describe, or provide detailed specifications for an object. With the goals of legibility and uniformity, styles are standardized and lettering ability has little relationship to normal writing ability. Engineering drawings use a Gothic sans-serif script, formed by a series of short strokes. Lower case letters are rare in most drawings of machines. ISO Lettering templates, designed for use with technical pens and pencils, and to suit ISO paper sizes, produce lettering characters to an international standard. The stroke thickness is related to the character height (for example, 2.5 mm high characters would have a stroke thickness - pen nib size - of 0.25 mm, 3.5 would use a 0.35 mm pen and so forth). The ISO character set (font) has a seriffed one, a barred seven, an open four, six, and nine, and a round topped three, that improves legibility when, for example, an A0 drawing has been reduced to A1 or even A3 (and perhaps enlarged back or reproduced/faxed/ microfilmed &amp;c). When CAD drawings became more popular, especially using US software, such as AutoCAD, the nearest font to this ISO standard font was Romantic Simplex (RomanS) - a proprietary shx font) with a manually adjusted width factor (override) to make it look as near to the ISO lettering for the drawing board. However, with the closed four, and arced six and nine, romans.shx typeface could be difficult to read in reductions. In more recent revisions of software packages, the TrueType font ISOCPEUR reliably reproduces the original drawing board lettering stencil style, however, many drawings have switched to the ubiquitous Arial.ttf.

==Conventional parts (areas)==

===Title block===
Every engineering drawing must have a title block.

The title block (T/B, TB) is an area of the drawing that conveys header-type information about the drawing, such as: 
* Drawing title (hence the name &quot;title block&quot;)
* Drawing number
* Part number(s)
* Name of the design activity (corporation, government agency, etc.)
* Identifying code of the design activity (such as a CAGE code)
* Address of the design activity (such as city, state/province, country)
* Measurement units of the drawing (for example, inches, millimeters)
* Default tolerances for dimension callouts where no tolerance is specified
* Boilerplate callouts of general specs
* Intellectual property rights warning

ISO 7200 specifies the data fields used in title blocks.
It standardizes eight mandatory data fields:
* Title (hence the name &quot;title block&quot;)
* Created by (name of drafter)
* Approved by
* Legal owner (name of company or organization)
* Document type
* Drawing number (same for every sheet of this document, unique for each technical document of the organization)
* Sheet number and number of sheets (for example, &quot;Sheet 5/7&quot;)
* Date of issue (when the drawing was made)

Traditional locations for the title block are the bottom right (most commonly) or the top right or center.

===Revisions block===
The revisions block (rev block) is a tabulated list of the revisions (versions) of the drawing, documenting the revision control.

Traditional locations for the revisions block are the top right (most commonly) or adjoining the title block in some way.

===Next assembly===
The next assembly block, often also referred to as &quot;where used&quot; or sometimes &quot;effectivity block&quot;, is a list of higher assemblies where the product on the current drawing is used. This block is commonly found adjacent to the title block.

===Notes list===
The notes list provides notes to the user of the drawing, conveying any information that the callouts within the field of the drawing did not. It may include general notes, flagnotes, or a mixture of both.

Traditional locations for the notes list are anywhere along the edges of the field of the drawing.

====General notes====
General notes (G/N, GN) apply generally to the contents of the drawing, as opposed to applying only to certain part numbers or certain surfaces or features.

====Flagnotes====
Flagnotes or flag notes (FL, F/N) are notes that apply only where a flagged callout points, such as to particular surfaces, features, or part numbers. Typically the callout includes a flag icon. Some companies call such notes &quot;delta notes&quot;, and the note number is enclosed inside a triangular symbol (similar to capital letter delta, Δ). &quot;FL5&quot; (flagnote 5) and &quot;D5&quot; (delta note 5) are typical ways to abbreviate in ASCII-only contexts.

===Field of the drawing===
The field of the drawing (F/D, FD) is the main body or main area of the drawing, excluding the title block, rev block, P/L and so on

===List of materials, bill of materials, parts list===

The list of materials (L/M, LM, LoM), bill of materials (B/M, BM, BoM), or parts list (P/L, PL) is a (usually tabular) list of the materials used to make a part, and the parts used to make an assembly. It may contain instructions for heat treatment, finishing, and other processes, for each part number. Sometimes such LoMs or PLs are separate documents from the drawing itself.

Traditional locations for the LoM/BoM are above the title block, or in a separate document.

===Parameter tabulations===
Some drawings call out dimensions with parameter names (that is, variables, such a &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;), then tabulate rows of parameter values for each part number.

Traditional locations for parameter tables, when such tables are used, are floating near the edges of the field of the drawing, either near the title block or elsewhere along the edges of the field.

===Views and sections===
Each view or section is a separate set of projections, occupying a contiguous portion of the field of the drawing. Usually views and sections are called out with cross-references to specific zones of the field.

===Zones===
Often a drawing is divided into zones by an alphanumeric grid, with zone labels along the margins, such as A, B, C, D up the sides and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 along the top and bottom.
Names of zones are thus, for example, A5, D2, or B1. This feature greatly eases discussion of, and reference to, particular areas of the drawing.

==Abbreviations and symbols==

As in many technical fields, a wide array of abbreviations and symbols have been developed in engineering drawing during the 20th and 21st centuries. For example, cold rolled steel is often abbreviated as CRS, and diameter is often abbreviated as DIA, D, or ⌀.

Most engineering drawings are language-independent—words are confined to the title block; symbols are used in place of words elsewhere.

With the advent of computer generated drawings for manufacturing and machining, many symbols have fallen out of common use. This poses a problem when attempting to interpret an older hand-drawn document that contains obscure elements that cannot be readily referenced in standard teaching text or control documents such as ASME and ANSI standards. For example, ASME Y14.5M 1994 excludes a few elements that convey critical information as contained in older US Navy drawings and aircraft manufacturing drawings of World War 2 vintage. Researching the intent and meaning of some symbols can prove difficult.

== Example ==

Here is an example of an engineering drawing (an isometric view of the same object is shown above). The different line types are colored for clarity.

*Black = object line and hatching
*Red = hidden line
*Blue = center line of piece or opening
*Magenta = phantom line or cutting plane line

Sectional views are indicated by the direction of arrows, as in the example right side.

==Legal instruments==

An engineering drawing is a legal document (that is, a legal instrument), because it communicates all the needed information about &quot;what is wanted&quot; to the people who will expend resources turning the idea into a reality. It is thus a part of a contract; the purchase order and the drawing together, as well as any ancillary documents (engineering change orders [ECOs], called-out specs), constitute the contract. Thus, if the resulting product is wrong, the worker or manufacturer are protected from liability as long as they have faithfully executed the instructions conveyed by the drawing. If those instructions were wrong, it is the fault of the engineer. Because manufacturing and construction are typically very expensive processes (involving large amounts of capital and payroll), the question of liability for errors has legal implications.

==Relationship to model-based definition (MBD/DPD)==

For centuries, engineering drawing was the sole method of transferring information from design into manufacture. In recent decades another method has arisen, called model-based definition (MBD) or digital product definition (DPD). In MBD, the information captured by the CAD software app is fed automatically into a CAM app (computer-aided manufacturing), which (with or without postprocessing apps) creates code in other languages such as G-code to be executed by a CNC machine tool (computer numerical control), 3D printer, or (increasingly) a hybrid machine tool that uses both. Thus today it is often the case that the information travels from the mind of the designer into the manufactured component without having ever been codified by an engineering drawing. In MBD, the dataset, not a drawing, is the legal instrument. The term &quot;technical data package&quot; (TDP) is now used to refer to the &quot;complete package of information&quot; (in one medium or another) that communicates information from design to production (such as 3D-model datasets, engineering drawings, engineering change orders (ECOs), spec revisions and addenda, and so on).

It still takes CAD/CAM programmers, CNC setup workers, and CNC operators to do manufacturing, as well as other people such as quality assurance staff (inspectors) and logistics staff (for materials handling, shipping-and-receiving, and front office functions). These workers often use drawings in the course of their work that have been produced from the MBD dataset. When proper procedures are being followed, a clear chain of precedence is always documented, such that when a person looks at a drawing, they are told by a note thereon that this drawing is not the governing instrument (because the MBD dataset is). In these cases, the drawing is still a useful document, although legally it is classified as &quot;for reference only&quot;, meaning that if any controversies or discrepancies arise, it is the MBD dataset, not the drawing, that governs.

<text>David Garshen Bomberg (5 December 1890 – 19 August 1957) was a British painter, and one of the Whitechapel Boys.

Bomberg was one of the most audacious of the exceptional generation of artists who studied at the Slade School of Art under Henry Tonks, and which included Mark Gertler, Stanley Spencer, C.R.W. Nevinson, and Dora Carrington. Bomberg painted a series of complex geometric compositions combining the influences of cubism and futurism in the years immediately preceding World War I; typically using a limited number of striking colours, turning humans into simple, angular shapes, and sometimes overlaying the whole painting a strong grid-work colouring scheme. He was expelled from the Slade School of Art in 1913, with agreement between senior teachers Tonks, Frederick Brown and Philip Wilson Steer, because of the audacity of his breach from the conventional approach of that time.

Whether because his faith in the machine age had been shattered by his experiences as a private soldier in the trenches or because of the pervasive retrogressive attitude towards modernism in Britain, Bomberg moved to a more figurative style in the 1920s and his work became increasingly dominated by portraits and landscapes drawn from nature. Gradually developing a more expressionist technique, he travelled widely through the Middle East and Europe.

From 1945 to 1953, Bomberg worked as a teacher at Borough Polytechnic (now London South Bank University) in London, where his pupils included Frank Auerbach, Leon Kossoff, Philip Holmes, Cliff Holden, Edna Mann, Dorothy Mead, Gustav Metzger, Dennis Creffield, Cecil Bailey, and Miles Richmond. David Bomberg House, one of the student halls of residences at London South Bank University, is named in his honour. He was married to landscape painter Lilian Holt.

==Early years==

David Bomberg was born in the Lee Bank area of Birmingham on 5 December 1890. He was the seventh of eleven children of a Polish Jewish immigrant leatherworker, Abraham, and his wife Rebecca. He was Orthodox but she less so and supported David&#x27;s painting ambitions. In 1895, his family moved to Whitechapel in the East End of London where he was to spend the rest of his childhood.

After studying art at City and Guilds, Bomberg returned to Birmingham to train as a lithographer but quit to study under Walter Sickert at Westminster School of Art from 1908 to 1910. Sickert&#x27;s emphasis on the study of form and the representation of the &quot;gross material facts&quot; of urban life were an important early influence on Bomberg, alongside Roger Fry&#x27;s 1910 exhibition &quot;Manet and the Post-Impressionists&quot;, where he first saw the work of Paul Cézanne.

Bomberg&#x27;s artistic studies had involved considerable financial hardship but in 1911, with the help of John Singer Sargent and the Jewish Education Aid Society, he was able to attain a place at the Slade School of Art.

==The Slade==

At the Slade School of Fine Art Bomberg was one of the remarkable generation of artists described by their drawing master Henry Tonks as the School&#x27;s second and last &quot;crisis of brilliance&quot; and which included Stanley Spencer, Paul Nash, Ben Nicholson, Mark Gertler and Isaac Rosenberg. (The &quot;first crisis of brilliance&quot; had occurred in the 1890s, with Augustus John, William Orpen and others.) Bomberg and Rosenberg, from similar backgrounds, had met some years earlier and became close friends as a result of their mutual interests.

The emphasis in teaching at the Slade was on technique and draughtsmanship, to which Bomberg was well suited – winning the Tonks Prize for his drawing of fellow student Rosenberg in 1911. His own style was rapidly moving away from these traditional methods, however, particularly under the influence of the March 1912 London exhibition of Italian Futurists that exposed him to the dynamic abstraction of Francis Picabia and Gino Severini, and Fry&#x27;s second &quot;Post Impressionist&quot; exhibition in October of the same year, which displayed the works of Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and the Fauvists alongside those of Wyndham Lewis, Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell.

Bomberg&#x27;s response to this became clear in paintings such as &quot;Vision of Ezekiel&quot; (1912), in which he proved &quot;he could absorb the most experimental European ideas, fuse these with Jewish influences and come up with a robust alternative of his own.&quot; His dynamic, angular representations of the human form, combining the geometrical abstraction of cubism with the energy of the Futurists, established his reputation as a forceful member of the avant-garde and the most audacious of his contemporaries; bringing him to the attention of Wyndham Lewis (who visited him in 1912) and Filippo Marinetti. In 1913, the year in which he was expelled from the Slade because of the radicalism of his approach, he travelled to France with Jacob Epstein, where among others he met Amedeo Modigliani, André Derain and Pablo Picasso.

==Pre-war avant-garde==

Expelled from the Slade in the Summer of 1913, Bomberg formed a series of loose affiliations with several groups involved with the contemporary English avant-garde, embarking on a brief and acrimonious association with the Bloomsbury Group&#x27;s Omega Workshops before exhibiting with the Camden Town Group in December 1913. His enthusiasm for the dynamism and aesthetics of the machine age gave him a natural affinity with Wyndham Lewis&#x27;s emerging vorticist movement, and five of his works featured in the founding exhibition of the London Group in 1914. Still, Bomberg was staunchly independent and despite Lewis&#x27; attempts he never officially joined Vorticism. In July 1914 he refused involvement with the Vorticist literary magazine &quot;BLAST&quot; and in June of the following year his work featured only in the &quot;Invited to show&quot; section of the vorticist exhibition at London&#x27;s Dore Gallery.
In 1914 he met his first wife Alice Mayes a resourceful and practical woman about ten years older than him who had worked with Kosslov&#x27;s Ballet Company. Their mutual interest in experimental dance and the Russian ballet may have helped bring them together. Alice helped Bomberg in the early part of his career both with financial support and in influencing his appearance and character.
1914 saw the highpoint of his early career – a solo exhibition at the Chenil Gallery in Chelsea which attracted positive reviews from Roger Fry and T. E. Hulme and attracted favourable attention from experimental artists nationally and internationally. The exhibition featured several of Bomberg&#x27;s early masterpieces, most notably &quot;The Mud Bath&quot; (1914), which was hung on an outside wall surrounded by Union Flags – causing &quot;the horses drawing the 29 bus... to shy at it as they came round the corner of King&#x27;s Road.&quot;

&quot;I look upon Nature while I live in a steel city&quot; he explained in the exhibition catalogue &quot;I APPEAL to a Sense of Form ... My object is the construction of Pure Form. I reject everything in painting that is not Pure Form.&quot;
With the help of Augustus John, Bomberg sold two paintings from this exhibition to the influential American collector John Quinn.
Alice and David enjoyed a trip to Paris with the proceeds of the sale of several pictures in 1914 which led to them marrying in 1916 after Bomberg had enlisted in the Royal Engineers in November 1915.

==World War I and after==
Despite the success of his Chenil Gallery exhibition Bomberg continued to be dogged by financial problems. In 1915, he enlisted in the Royal Engineers, transferring in 1916 to the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps and in March of that year, shortly after marrying his first wife, being sent to the Western Front.

World War I was to bring a profound change to Bomberg&#x27;s outlook. His experiences of its mechanized slaughter and the death of his brother in the trenches – as well as those of his friend Isaac Rosenberg and his supporter T. E. Hulme – permanently destroyed his faith in the aesthetics of the machine age. This can be seen most clearly in his commission for the Canadian War Memorials Fund, &quot;Sappers at Work&quot; (1918–1919): his first version of the painting was dismissed as a &quot;futurist abortion&quot; and was replaced by a second far more representational version.

The artist&#x27;s book &quot;Russian Ballet&quot;, 1919, was the last work to use the pre-war vorticist idiom. Bomberg self-published this work whilst waiting for the Canadian Government&#x27;s verdict on &quot;Sappers at Work&quot;; the next few years was to see him &#x27;experimenting with ways of making his stark pre-war style more rounded and organic&#x27;.

In radical opposition to the prevailing currents in avant-garde art, stimulated as these were by the enthusiasm for mechanization in Constructivism in Russia following the Revolution, Bomberg went to paint and draw in Palestine between 1923 and 1927, with the assistance of the Zionist Organization. There he brought together the geometric energies of his pre-war work as an &quot;English cubist&quot; with the tradition of figurative observation of the English landscape school of Turner, Constable, Girtin and John Sell Cotman.

==The return to order==
From there followed Bomberg&#x27;s great period of painting and drawing in landscape, in Spain at Toledo (1928), Ronda (1934–35 and 1954–57) and Asturias (1935), in Cyprus (1948) and intermittently in Britain, perhaps most powerfully in Cornwall. A six-month stay at Odessa in the Soviet Union in the second half of 1933, following Hitler&#x27;s seizure of power in Germany, led Bomberg on his return to London to immediate resignation from the Communist Party. During World War II, he painted &quot;Evening in the City of London&quot; (1944), showing the blitzed city viewed rising up to a triumphant, surviving St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on the horizon, since described as the &quot;most moving of all paintings of wartime Britain&quot; (Martin Harrison); a series of flower paintings saturated with turbulent feeling; and his single commission as a war artist, a series of &quot;Bomb Store&quot; paintings (1942) expressing Bomberg&#x27;s expanded first-hand sense of the destructive powers of modern technology in warfare. These &quot;Bomb Store&quot; paintings convey a premonitory sense of the massive explosion that destroyed the underground store two years later, killing around 70 people, and bear comparison with Piranesi&#x27;s &quot;Carceri&quot; etchings.

Bomberg&#x27;s superb draughtsmanship was expressed also in a lifelong series of portraits, from the early period of his Botticelli-like &quot;Head of a Poet&quot; (1913), a pencil portrait of his friend the poet Isaac Rosenberg for which he won the Henry Tonks Prize at the Slade, to his &quot;Last Self-Portrait&quot; (1956), painted at Ronda, a meditation also on Rembrandt.

Unable to get a teaching position after World War II in any of the most prestigious London art schools, Bomberg became the most exemplary teacher of the immediate post-war period in Britain, working part-time in a bakery school at the Borough Polytechnic (now London South Bank University) in the working-class borough of Southwark. Though his students received no grant and were awarded no diploma, he attracted devoted and highly energetic pupils, with whom he exhibited on an equal basis in London, Oxford, and Cambridge in two important artists&#x27; groupings in which he was the leading light, the Borough Group (1946–51) and the Borough Bottega (1953–55). He developed a deeply considered philosophy of art, set out in several pieces of writing, which he summed up in the phrase, &quot;The Spirit in the Mass&quot;.

Following a collapse in Ronda, Bomberg died in London in 1957, his critical stock rising sharply thereafter. One of Bomberg&#x27;s admirers, the painter Patrick Swift, unearthed and edited Bomberg&#x27;s pensées, and was later to publish them, along with images of Bomberg&#x27;s work, as &#x27;The Bomberg Papers&#x27; in his ‘X’ magazine (June 1960). After his early success before the First World War, he was in his lifetime the most brutally excluded artist in Britain. Having lived for years on the earnings of his second wife, fellow artist Lilian Holt and remittances from his sister Kitty, he died in absolute poverty.

==Posthumous reception==
Thirty years after his death, a major retrospective of Bomberg&#x27;s work curated by Richard Cork was held at the Tate Gallery, London, in 1988.

In 2006, Abbot Hall Art Gallery in Kendal, Cumbria, mounted the first major exhibition of Bomberg&#x27;s paintings for nearly twenty years: &quot;David Bomberg: Spirit in the Mass&quot; (17 July – 28 October 2006). Prior to that, the exhibition &quot;David Bomberg en Ronda&quot; at the Museo Joaquin Peinado in Ronda in Andalusia (1–30 October 2004) showed work by Bomberg in the city and environment which he had celebrated in paintings and drawings in 1934-35 and 1954–57. Work from one of the best collections in private hands was shown on the fiftieth anniversary of his death in the exhibition &quot;In celebration of David Bomberg 1890-1957&quot; at Daniel Katz Gallery, Old Bond Street, London (30 May – 13 July 2007).

London South Bank University, the site of Bomberg&#x27;s teaching at the former Borough Polytechnic, received a gift of more than 150 paintings and drawings by Bomberg and his students in the Borough Group – principally Dorothy Mead, Cliff Holden, Miles Richmond, and Dennis Creffield — the David Bomberg Legacy. The gallery, formally launched on 14 June 2012, to display the artworks donated to the university by Sarah Rose has been made possible by the Heritage Lottery Fund. The collection is the work of Sarah Rose, who built her collection over thirty years. The London South Bank University Borough Road Gallery planned to hold two exhibitions a year, drawn from the Sarah Rose collection.

The Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University held an exhibition entitled &quot;The Vorticists: Rebel Artists in London and New York, 1914-18&quot; from 30 September 2010 through 2 January 2011. Tate Britain held an exhibition entitled The &quot;Vorticists: Manifesto for a Modern World&quot; between 14 June and 4 September 2011. In the 2011 BBC series, &quot;British Masters&quot;, Bomberg was singled out as being one of the greatest painters of the 20th Century. He was one of the six artists included in Dulwich Picture Gallery&#x27;s 2013 summer exhibition, &quot;Nash, Nevinson, Spencer, Gertler, Carrington, Bomberg: A Crisis of Brilliance, 1908-1922&quot;.

David Bowie purchased work by Bomberg and kept it in his private collection, part of which was sold at auction after Bowie&#x27;s death in 2016.

In 2017, the Pallant House Gallery in Chichester mounted a major exhibition of Bomberg&#x27;s work curated in partnership with the Ben Uri Gallery &amp; Museum of St John&#x27;s Wood, London.

==References in fiction==
In &quot;Restless&quot;, William Boyd&#x27;s 2006 novel, there is a reference to a portrait by Bomberg of one of the book&#x27;s major (fictional) characters. The painting is said to occupy a place in the National Portrait Gallery in London.
In &quot;A Palestine Affair&quot;, a 2003 novel by Jonathan Wilson, the character &quot;Mike Bloomberg&quot; is loosely based on Bomberg&#x27;s life, as acknowledged by the author: &quot;Richard Cork&#x27;s &#x27;David Bomberg&#x27; [was] ... of inestimable value to me in constructing this fiction&quot;.
Glyn Hughes&#x27;s novel, &quot;Roth&quot; (Simon &amp; Schuster, London, 1992) – its leading character, a London Jewish painter, its cover carrying a reproduction of one of Bomberg&#x27;s Cyprus landscapes, is also loosely based on the author&#x27;s reflections on Bomberg.

<doc id="171419" wikidata="Q685190" url="?curid=171419" title="Hellhammer">
<text>Hellhammer was a Swiss extreme metal band from Nürensdorf, active from 1982 to 1984. Although the band&#x27;s sound and style were heavily criticized and poorly reviewed during their active years, they have been widely praised in retrospect and are often regarded as a key influence on black metal. In June 1984, Hellhammer disbanded but two of its members soon formed the influential extreme metal band Celtic Frost.

== History ==

Inspired by the music of Black Sabbath, Venom, Raven, Motörhead and Angel Witch, guitarist/vocalist Thomas Gabriel Fischer (a.k.a. &quot;Tom Warrior&quot;), bassist/vocalist Urs Sprenger (a.k.a. &quot;Savage Damage&quot; and &quot;Steve Warrior&quot;) and drummer Pete Stratton formed Hammerhead (later Hellhammer) in early 1982. Although Fischer &quot;was not into punk at all,&quot; he was &quot;blown away&quot; by the Discharge records &quot;Why&quot; and &quot;Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing&quot;, which profoundly influenced his music from then on. As he noted, a lack of extreme metal at the time meant that fans of Venom and Motörhead often had to resort to punk bands for similar sounds. GBH and Anti-Nowhere League also proved influential.

After the exit of Stratton and drummer Jörg Neubart (a.k.a. &quot;Denial Fiend&quot; and &quot;Bruce Day&quot;) joining in the ranks in autumn 1982, Hellhammer attempted to find proper rehearsal spaces, which proved difficult due to either exceedingly high rents or unavailable studio hours. In June 1983, the group recorded their demo tape, &quot;Triumph of Death&quot;, for a mere $70. Despite being embarrassed by the end results, Hellhammer shipped their demo to a number of heavy metal magazines, such as Great Britain&#x27;s &quot;Metal Forces&quot;; critical response toward them was generally favorable. Although rejected by the labels they sent tapes to, the band eventually caught the attention of a newcomer German label, Noise Records.

Steve Warrior had been replaced by former &quot;Schizo&quot; bassist Martin Eric Ain, a change which marked the beginning of a serious and radical transformation in the band&#x27;s music and lyrics. These changes were ultimately responsible for Fischer&#x27;s and Ain&#x27;s increasing perception of being limited within the confines of the purposely primitive Hellhammer vehicle. Hellhammer disbanded in May 1984, and Fischer and Ain formed a new band under the name of Celtic Frost in June.

== Criticism ==
Although its former members felt proud of Hellhammer&#x27;s legacy by the end of the 1980s, that was not always so. In fact, Tom Warrior feared that his prior commitment to Hellhammer could hinder the future of Celtic Frost. A 1985 &quot;Kerrang!&quot; review summed up his worst fears: &quot;The truly execrable Hellhammer may now have turned into Celtic Frost but still suck on the big one.&quot;

Other metal publications were also skeptical of Hellhammer&#x27;s musical endeavor. &quot;Metal Forces&quot;, for one, absolutely loathed the group; that started a long-lasting feud between that zine and Warrior, which kept Celtic Frost from playing in England for a couple of years. &quot;Rock Power&quot; was not fond of Hellhammer either; they considered it &quot;the most terrible, abhorrent, and atrocious thing &#x27;musicians&#x27; were ever allowed to record&quot;. In fact, they were &quot;receiving miserable reviews everywhere&quot;, Warrior concluded.

Regarding the controversial status of his former band, Thomas said:

==Reissues==

At the dawn of the next decade Noise Records released a new version of Hellhammer&#x27;s debut, retitled &quot;Apocalyptic Raids 1990 A.D.&quot; This re-issue was augmented by two tracks off the &quot;Death Metal&quot; compilation, which was &quot;something we always wanted to, even back in &#x27;84&quot;, claimed Tom Warrior. This re-release also came with a new cover design done by Martin Ain.

In November 2007, Tom Gabriel Fischer announced that the original master tapes of Hellhammer&#x27;s demos (&quot;Death Fiend&quot;, &quot;Triumph of Death&quot;, and &quot;Satanic Rites&quot;) would be released as a 2CD/3LP package, titled &quot;Demon Entrails&quot;, in February 2008 with new liner notes on the complete history of Hellhammer, unreleased photos and artwork, and all tracks remastered personally by Tom Gabriel Fischer, Martin Eric Ain and Steve Warrior. The album was released by Prowlin&#x27; Death/Century Media Records.

In 2016, both Century Media and Prowling Death Records joint released an unreleased 7&quot; vinyl single the band originally recorded in 1983 titled &quot;Blood Insanity&quot;. Tom Gabriel Fischer explained that the band contemplated releasing material they recorded at the time of the &quot;Triumph of Death&quot; demo sessions which would contain two songs. Unfortunately, the single languished into an unrealized state until the band&#x27;s split, rendering any plans for future releases redundant. Fischer went on to say that it never left his mind since then and presented the idea of releasing the single to Century Media, in which the record company agreed.

== Legacy ==
A four-track 12&quot; EP, &quot;Apocalyptic Raids&quot;, was released in March 1984. At the time, it was regarded as one of the heaviest and most extreme records produced. By then, the band had already broken up, but the recording was one of the original black/death metal recordings, and spawned a legion of imitators, playing doom metal, thrash metal, black metal and death metal. Both Fischer and Ain later teamed up again when forming Celtic Frost in summer of 1984.

Hellhammer covers by notable bands include Napalm Death, Sepultura, Samael, Incantation, Slaughter, Behemoth, and Gallhammer. Fischer&#x27;s post-Celtic Frost band, Apollyon Sun, also re-worked &quot;Messiah&quot;.

Tom Fischer released a book in 2010 titled &quot;Only Death Is Real: An Illustrated History of Hellhammer and early Celtic Frost 1982–1985&quot;, which documents the early days of said bands. The book featured a foreword by Darkthrone guitarist Nocturno Culto and an introduction by the author Joel McIver.

<text>The Partridge Family Notebook is the sixth studio album by The Partridge Family. Released in November 1972, the album entered &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top LP&#x27;s chart in December, peaking at no. 41 in January 1973 – the same week in which its lead single, a cover of Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil&#x27;s &quot;Looking Through the Eyes of Love&quot;, peaked at 39 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100. The album remained in the Top 200 for 16 weeks, and was the first by the Partridge Family not to reach the Top 40.

A second US single, &quot;Friend and a Lover&quot;, was released in March 1973 but stalled at no. 99 on the Hot 100.

The Partridges&#x27; version of &quot;Looking Through the Eyes of Love&quot; – originally a hit for Gene Pitney in 1965 (US 28/UK 3) – fared better in the UK, where it peaked at no. 9 in late February and early March, at the height of both the glam rock era and David Cassidy&#x27;s career as a teen idol solo star in Great Britain and Ireland. The single, which shared the Top Ten with glam giants Slade, the Sweet and Gary Glitter, immediately followed Cassidy&#x27;s solo hit &quot;Rock Me Baby&quot; in the charts (UK no. 11/US 38) and slightly overlapped with Cassidy&#x27;s next UK solo hit, the double A-side single &quot;I Am a Clown / Some Kind of A Summer&quot; (UK no. 3), which was not released in the States.

&quot;Notebook&quot; also featured a cover of &quot;Walking in the Rain&quot; – a 1964 Ronettes classic also by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, but co-written with Phil Spector. The Partridges&#x27; cover, which was not released as a single in America, reached no. 10 in the UK in June 1973. The album did not chart in the UK despite yielding two hit singles there.

The &quot;Notebook&quot; album cover was designed to resemble a standard school notebook. The cover of the UK and Europe album releases, as with the CD reissue many years later, featured a picture of the family in their usual red velvet suits.

<doc id="171427" wikidata="Q158895" url="?curid=171427" title="Helloween">
<text>Helloween is a German power metal band founded in 1984 in Hamburg by members of bands Iron Fist, Gentry, Second Hell and Powerfool. The band has at times been called one of the most influential European heavy metal bands of the 1980s. Its first lineup consisted of singer and guitarist Kai Hansen, bassist Markus Grosskopf, guitarist Michael Weikath and drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg. By the time Hansen left Helloween in 1989 to form Gamma Ray, the band had evolved into a five-piece, with Michael Kiske taking over as lead vocalist. Schwichtenberg and Kiske both parted ways with Helloween in 1993; Schwichtenberg died two years later as the result of suicide. Between then and 2016, there had been numerous line-up changes, leaving Grosskopf and Weikath as the only remaining original members. As a septet, their current lineup features all of the surviving members of the &quot;Keeper of the Seven Keys&quot; lineup (Hansen, Weikath, Kiske, Grosskopf), in addition to the remaining members from the &quot;Keeper of the Seven Keys: The Legacy&quot;-era (singer Andi Deris, guitarist Sascha Gerstner and drummer Daniel Loble).

Since its inception, Helloween has released 16 studio albums, four live albums, three EPs and 30 singles, was honored with 14 gold and six platinum awards and has sold more than 10 million records worldwide. Helloween has been referred to as the &quot;fathers of power metal&quot;, as well as one of the so-called &quot;big four&quot; of the genre&#x27;s early German scene, along with Grave Digger, Rage and Running Wild, and one of the &quot;big four&quot; bands of the entire genre, alongside Blind Guardian, Sabaton, and DragonForce.

== History ==

=== Early years and first album (1984–1986) ===
Helloween was formed 1984 in Hamburg, West Germany. The original line-up included Kai Hansen on vocals and rhythm guitar, Michael Weikath on lead guitar, Markus Grosskopf on bass and Ingo Schwichtenberg on drums. That year, the band signed with Noise Records and recorded two songs for a Noise compilation record called &quot;Death Metal&quot;. The compilation featured the bands Hellhammer, Running Wild and Dark Avenger. The two tracks were &quot;Oernst of Life&quot; by Weikath and Hansen&#x27;s &quot;Metal Invaders,&quot; a faster version of which would appear on the band&#x27;s first full-length album.

Helloween recorded and released its first record in 1985, a self-titled EP containing five tracks. Also that year, the band released its first full-length album, &quot;Walls of Jericho&quot;, which helped spawn speed metal. During the following concert tour, Hansen had difficulties singing and playing the guitar at the same time. Hansen&#x27;s last recording as the band&#x27;s lead singer was in 1986 on a vinyl EP titled &quot;Judas&quot;, which contained the song &quot;Judas&quot; and live versions of &quot;Ride the Sky&quot; and &quot;Guardians&quot; recorded at Gelsenkirchen. (The CD edition has the live introduction, but the songs have been replaced with studio versions and crowd noise spliced in.) Following these releases, Helloween began the search for a new vocalist.

Hansen said in an interview 1999: 

=== &quot;Keeper of the Seven Keys&quot; (1986–1989) ===
The band found an 18-year-old vocalist, Michael Kiske, from a local Hamburg band named Ill Prophecy. Kiske was initially uninterested in them, having heard the more thrashy &quot;Walls of Jericho&quot;, but after Weikath insisted, he attended one of their sessions and heard some songs they had composed for his voice (songs which would later be featured in their next albums), and he changed his mind.

With their new lead vocalist in tow, Helloween approached record labels Noise International and RCA and proposed the release of a double-LP to introduce the line-up. This proposition was turned down.

Instead, they recorded a single album, resulting in &quot;Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part I&quot;. The album was released by Noise Records on 23 May 1987, months after the band spent the winter of 1986 into 1987 hard at work inside Horus Sound Studio in Hannover, Germany. It consisted of songs mostly written by Hansen. Due to guitarist Michael Weikath&#x27;s illness, he was recovering from a nervous breakdown, all the rhythm guitars on the album were played by Hansen. Weikath was only able to play some guitar solos and only wrote the ballad &quot;A Tale That Wasn&#x27;t Right&quot;. Weikath said in an interview: &quot;I was pleased to still be in the band.&quot;

The album received great reviews from the press and a great response from the fans. In addition, it made Helloween a benchmark to measure power metal bands. The positive reception took Helloween across the ocean, as they toured the US together with Grim Reaper and Armored Saint. Their American distributor at the time, RCA, got them to record a video for the epic &quot;Halloween&quot;, but cut it to four minutes so that the video could be played on MTV. However, after the European tour together with then-unknown American thrash metal band Overkill, the first struggles within the band started taking shape.

Exhausted from touring, Hansen asked the band to take a short break from live performances. However, as the band was just starting to gain momentum the time to take a break was just not right. The disputes ranged from arguing about their musical direction on the future releases to extensive touring and other, mostly insignificant topics. Hansen started contemplating leaving the band.

In August 1988, Helloween released &quot;Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part II.&quot; This time the record featured more Weikath-penned tracks. The idea behind this was that the first album should feature tracks written by Hansen due to their similarity to the style of their debut, while the second album would feature tracks composed by Weikath which were a lot more mainstream by comparison. The album capitalized on the success of Keeper of the Seven Keys Part 1 and picks up where it left off. Success bloomed all over Europe, Asia and even the US. The album went gold in Germany, reached #108 in the US, hit the UK top 30 albums and single &quot;Dr Stein&quot; reached the lofty heights of #57.

Despite the vast commercial success of the Keeper&#x27;s part two, the rift between the band members kept growing. They spent more time arguing about the music rather than composing it. Hansen called for a meeting and once again asked the band if they could take a break from touring.

The band got the chance to perform, in front of 100.000 people, as a part of the Monsters of Rock festival along with Iron Maiden, David Lee Roth, Kiss, Megadeth and Guns N&#x27; Roses at Donington Park on 20 August 1988.

Around the same time, the tension between the band and their record label Noise led to an argument which would later lead to a lawsuit. The band was discontent with how much they were being paid taking into account great record and merchandise sales, as well as frequent touring. Helloween also supported Iron Maiden on their Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour, on some dates in Europe.

In the fall of 1988, the band went on yet another European tour, now as headlining act, named &quot;Pumpkins Fly Free Tour&quot;, which spawned their first ever live album, released the year after, titled &quot;Live in the U.K.&quot; recorded during their show in Scotland. The same record was also released as &quot;Keepers Live&quot; in Japan and &quot;I Want Out Live&quot; in the US.

MTV put the single &quot;I Want Out&quot; into heavy rotation. A video that was directed by Storm Thorgerson. For &quot;I Want Out&quot;, Hansen very publicly laid out his disillusion with life as a member of Helloween at this time, explaining:

In support of its &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; show, MTV also presented the Headbangers Ball Tour in U.S. and invited Helloween to be a part of it in 1989. However, before the start of that tour, in December 1988 Kai Hansen broke the news to the other members that he was leaving Helloween. Hansen&#x27;s last show with the band was at The Hummingbird, Birmingham, UK on 8 November 1988.

=== Hansen, Schwichtenberg and Kiske&#x27;s departures (1989–1993) ===
Hansen officially left Helloween on 1 January 1989, and the band chose Roland Grapow to replace him. Grapow was originally discovered in a club in Hamburg, Germany playing with his band Rampage. Helloween guitarist Michael Weikath, who kept Grapow&#x27;s name in mind in the event Hansen would potentially leave.

Grapow, who was a car mechanic at the time, stated in 2017 that, if Weikath had not happened to ask him to join the band, he would have kept his job and given up on his dream of becoming a professional musician. Grapow said in 2020: 

The inaugural Headbangers Ball Tour started in April 1989 with Helloween joining San Francisco Bay Area thrash metal band Exodus in support of headlining act Anthrax. The band was slotted in the prestigious second spot, right before Anthrax&#x27;s set. On the heels of this exposure to U.S. audiences, the band achieved worldwide success. Kiske reflected at the time: 

At the height of their success Helloween decided to sign with then-major label EMI Records after being urged to do so by their management company Sanctuary, who also managed Iron Maiden. Their former label Noise Records sued them for breach of contract which effectively put the band on hold. Between June 1989 and April 1992 they did not play one show. All the momentum the band had built up came to a halt.

Their first album with new guitarist Grapow &quot;Pink Bubbles Go Ape&quot; was released on EMI in the spring of 1991 in Europe and Japan. In the rest of the world as well as the band&#x27;s home country Germany the album was delayed until April 1992 due to the ongoing legal battle between the band&#x27;s current and former labels. By that time the music landscape had changed drastically. It also did not help that Helloween moved even further away from their speed metal roots and further embrace the hard rocking side of their sound. As a result, &quot;Pink Bubbles Go Ape&quot; failed commercially and tensions started to build amongst the band members.

They played their first show on their &quot;Quick Hello Tour&quot; in Hamburg 30 April 1992 and continued with some more dates in Europe and the band also went to Japan in the autumn of 1992.

The follow-up &quot;Chameleon&quot; was released on EMI in the summer of 1993. The very experimental album was a commercial failure. The band&#x27;s diversion away from the sound that had made them famous alienated a large portion of their fanbase.

The original drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg was then fired from the band due to his deteriorating mental state. 

Grosskopf said 1996: 

Schwichtenberg could not be part of the band anymore until he recovered from drugs and alcohol abuse and took his medications against schizophrenia. After a long telephone call with Weikath, in which he explained why they had made that hard and painful decision, Schwichtenberg was asked to leave Helloween.

He was replaced by session drummer Ritchie Abdel-Nabi on a temporary basis to finish the &quot;Chameleon&quot; Tour. Also many of the European dates were cancelled. Helloween played in half-filled venues and their decision to focus the setlist mostly on &quot;Chameleon&quot; and &quot;Pink Bubbles&quot; songs did not help either.

Weikath said 1994 about Kiske and the &quot;Chameleon&quot; Tour: 

Meanwhile, the conflicts within the rest of the band worsened and the decision was made to fire Kiske. His last performance with the band was at a Charity show at Rockfabrik Ludwigsburg 22 December 1993, until he returned to the stage with Helloween 24 years later.

Kiske did not have any contact with Grosskopf and Weikath for many years. He would later release solo albums with different musical directions. In 2008, Kiske released &quot;Past in Different Ways&quot;; an album featuring most of his old Helloween songs, albeit rearranged and re-recorded acoustically. Commenting on Kiske&#x27;s dismissal, Grosskopf later said:

1993 would come to a close for Helloween with no singer, no drummer, and no record contract (EMI released the band from its agreement for the low sales numbers for &quot;Pink Bubbles Go Ape&quot; and &quot;Chameleon&quot;).

Weikath said 1994: 
Grosskopf continued: 

=== First years with Andi Deris and return to the roots (1994–2000) ===
Helloween returned in 1994 with former Pink Cream 69 frontman Andi Deris as their new lead vocalist and Uli Kusch, formerly of Kai Hansen&#x27;s Gamma Ray, on drums. The band already knew Deris from some recording sessions in Hamburg, though both Deris and new drummer Uli Kusch played on the band&#x27;s next album &quot;Master of the Rings&quot;, which was released on 8 July 1994, they were temporary members of the band back during the recording sessions, but they eventually became permanent members of the band on 1 September 1994. Deris had been approached by Weikath to join the band in 1991, but he had declined, despite being intrigued by the offer and having to deal with emerging conflicts between him and his band. In the years since, however, Kiske was fired from Helloween and the issues within Pink Cream 69 worsened. Faced with the inevitability of his firing, Deris accepted Weikath&#x27;s offer during a night out with the band members. With this new lineup and a new record contract with Castle Communications, Helloween released its comeback album, &quot;Master of the Rings&quot;.

8 March 1995, original drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg committed suicide by jumping in front of a train in his native Hamburg. In the years since his departure from Helloween, Schwichtenberg had gotten worse from schizophrenia. 1996&#x27;s &quot;The Time of the Oath&quot; was dedicated to his memory.

Following another world tour, a double live album called &quot;High Live&quot; was released. In 1998, Helloween released &quot;Better Than Raw&quot;, one of the band&#x27;s heaviest albums since the full-length debut. The subsequent supporting tour was made up of stops in Europe, Japan and Brazil, but on 20 December 1998, the band visited New York and played a show at the venue Coney Island High in Manhattan, the first show for Helloween in the United States in nearly a decade.

The band would follow &quot;Better Than Raw&quot; with a 1999 release titled &quot;Metal Jukebox&quot;, a cover-album featuring Helloween&#x27;s versions of songs from such bands as Scorpions, Jethro Tull, Faith No More, The Beatles, ABBA and Deep Purple.

=== Line-up changes (2002–2004) ===
2000 saw the release of &quot;The Dark Ride&quot;, a more experimental and darker album than their previous releases. It came complete with downtuned guitars and a gruffer singing style from Deris. Immediately following the tour, Helloween parted ways with guitarist Roland Grapow and drummer Uli Kusch. One version of events states that Weikath, Deris and Grosskopf felt that Kusch and Grapow, in particular, were spending more time on and paying more attention to their new side-project, Masterplan (Grapow&#x27;s output on Helloween albums had dropped to barely one song per album by that point); since the others believed that Kusch and Grapow were not one hundred percent dedicated to Helloween, they were dismissed.

They were replaced by guitarist Sascha Gerstner (ex-Freedom Call, Neumond) and drummer Mark Cross (ex-Metalium, Kingdom Come, At Vance, Firewind), culminating with the recording of another studio album, titled &quot;Rabbit Don&#x27;t Come Easy&quot;, in 2003. The band met Gerstner via a recommendation by producer Charlie Bauerfeind. According to Grosskopf, one day he was recording something with Freedom Call &quot;and later on we called him up and he went to first meet Weiki because it was very important that Weiki finds a player that he can play with and also communicate and understand. [...] So we got him on the island where we recorded and let him hang out with us a little and then he decided &#x27;Good, let&#x27;s go&#x27;.&quot; Later in 2012, on an interview with Metal Shock Finland&#x27;s Chief Editor, Mohsen Fayyazi, Grapow stated:

Cross could not finish the album due to mononucleosis, completing only two tracks; the drum tracks were completed by Motörhead&#x27;s Mikkey Dee. Stefan Schwarzmann, former drummer of Running Wild and Accept would shortly thereafter take over the drumming duties. Despite a somewhat tepid response to the album, Helloween nonetheless completed a successful world tour, highlighted by the return of classic songs such as &quot;Starlight&quot;, &quot;Murderer&quot;, and &quot;Keeper of the Seven Keys&quot; to the setlist. Additionally, the band toured the United States for the first time since 1989, playing to sold-out crowds at nearly every venue.

=== Steady line-up (2005–2016) ===
2005 saw yet another line-up change, following the &quot;Rabbits on the Run&quot; tour, as it became apparent that Helloween and Stefan Schwarzmann did not share the same musical vision. As further noted by the band, he had some trouble performing fast drum parts, so he was replaced by Daniel Löble, the former drummer of German metal band Rawhead Rexx. A change in record company also followed as they signed a deal with German label SPV. Any fears that what had now become a revolving door of band members would affect the quality of their new album were laid to rest as Helloween&#x27;s new studio album, titled &quot;Keeper of the Seven Keys – The Legacy&quot;, was released on 28 October 2005 in Germany and 8 November in the US to commercial and critical acclaim. The album had a pre-release single, &quot;Mrs. God&quot;, as well as a video for the track. The track &quot;Light the Universe&quot; was released as a single on 22 November, featuring Candice Night of Blackmore&#x27;s Night on guest vocals. She also appears in the video clip for that track.

In late 2006, Helloween filmed and recorded shows in São Paulo (Brazil), Sofia (Bulgaria) and Tokyo (Japan) for their live album &quot;Keeper of the Seven Keys – The Legacy World Tour 2005/2006&quot;. The DVD also featured extra footage of the band, as well as interviews and a road movie. This was the second Helloween live album to feature Andi Deris as frontman and third overall. It enjoyed chart success in several countries: Germany: 9 (DVD) &amp; 58 (CD), Sweden: 9 (DVD), France: 10 (DVD)
Helloween has since completed their studio album &quot;Gambling with the Devil&quot;, which was released on 23 October 2007. It received many positive reviews, with most fans praising the album as being one of the best Deris-era albums. Despite being one of Helloween&#x27;s heaviest albums, it is noted for featuring more keyboards. &quot;As Long as I Fall&quot;, the first single, was released in early September and only available via download (save for Japan, where it was released on CD). The video for the song is available at their official site.

Helloween teamed up with Kai Hansen&#x27;s current band Gamma Ray for their 2007–2008 &quot;Hellish Rock&quot; world tour, which started in early November 2007. Helloween were headlining and Gamma Ray were labeled as the &quot;very special guest&quot; with most shows also having fellow German &quot;guest&quot; Axxis. The tour went through Europe, Asia and South America, as well as a few dates in the US. The tour is notable for Kai Hansen stepping on stage with his former band fellows Weikath and Grosskopf to perform hits &quot;I Want Out&quot; and &quot;Future World&quot; in the last encore segment of Helloween. In 2008, they played the UK Bloodstock festival alongside Dimmu Borgir.

On 26 December 2009, Helloween released the &quot;Unarmed – Best of 25th Anniversary&quot; album in Japan. The album was released on 1 February 2010 in Europe. The album is a compilation of ten of the band&#x27;s best known songs, re-recorded in different musical styles than the original recordings and by the current lineup. It features a seventeen-minute &quot;Keepers Medley&quot;, recorded by a seventy-piece orchestra from Prague, mixing together &quot;Halloween&quot;, &quot;The Keeper of the Seven Keys&quot; and &quot;The King for a 1000 Years&quot;. There is a limited edition digipak, including a thirty-minute &quot;making of&quot;-DVD with interviews and studio footage. The band&#x27;s website states that the album was released on 13 April 2010 in North America via Sony &amp; THE END RECORDS labels. On 14 May 2010, it was announced on their site that they were working on a new studio album, which was the fastest and heaviest effort in years.

Helloween released their thirteenth studio album, &quot;7 Sinners&quot;, on 31 October 2010 in Europe and 3 November 2010 in the US. Before its physical release, the band made it available worldwide for streaming via their Myspace page. The name of the album alludes to the seven deadly sins. According to Andi Deris, the album goes straight to the point: &quot;After an acoustic album, we needed definitely something that shows the people without any question that this is a metal album.&quot; The band toured to promote the new album with Stratovarius and Pink Cream 69 as their guests. On 5 April 2011, via the band&#x27;s website, it was announced that &quot;7 Sinners&quot; was awarded &#x27;Gold status&#x27; in the Czech Republic.

In June 2012, Helloween entered the studio to begin recording their fourteenth album, &quot;Straight Out of Hell&quot;, which was released on 18 January 2013. They then went on tour around the world with Gamma Ray again.

In September, Helloween played at Rock in Rio 2013 with former member Kai Hansen as a special guest. In October 2014, the band announced a new album for a May 2015 release. It was produced by Charlie Bauerfeind at Mi Sueño Studio on Tenerife and marked their return to the Nuclear Blast label with which they released &quot;The Dark Ride&quot; and &quot;Rabbit Don&#x27;t Come Easy&quot;.

On 26 February 2015, the band revealed the name and the cover artwork of the album, &quot;My God-Given Right&quot;, released on 29 May 2015. The artwork was created by Martin Häusler.
In June 2015, it was discovered that the band members were working on a book, released as &quot;Hellbook&quot;. Grosskopf stated that it is &quot;a kind of history book with lots of pictures&quot;.

=== Pumpkins United (2016–present) ===
In November 2016, it was announced that former members Kai Hansen and Michael Kiske were re-joining the band for a world tour titled the Pumpkins United World Tour, that would start on 19 October 2017 in Monterrey, Mexico, and conclude the following year.

Although Hansen had been occasionally appearing as a guest on Helloween shows for a few years, Kiske had been particularly reluctant in interviews to the idea of performing with Helloween again due to bad blood with Markus Grosskopf and especially Michael Weikath, dating from when he was fired from the band in 1993; this started to change in 2013, when he ran into Weikath at the Sweden Rock Festival. He stated in 2017: &quot;The first thing [Weikath] said was, &#x27;What have I done that you can&#x27;t forgive me?&#x27; That was the first line he said to me. And I realized that I had forgiven somehow a long time ago without noticing. That&#x27;s how it all started&quot;. It was Hansen, who had been his bandmate as a part of Unisonic since 2011, who ultimately convinced him in 2014. Other popular former members Roland Grapow and Uli Kusch were not asked to re-join, with Grosskopf stating &quot;it would be too many people&quot;.

This new line-up released an original song, &quot;Pumpkins United&quot;, on 13 October 2017, as a free download (with a vinyl release on 8 December), on which Deris, Hansen and Kiske all share lead vocals. The Pumpkins United World Tour started in Monterrey, Mexico on 19 October 2017. The first show saw both Deris and Kiske performing songs from their respective Helloween albums and sing duets together, while Hansen performed lead vocals for a medley of songs from &quot;Walls of Jericho&quot;. The show also included a tribute to the late original Helloween drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg.

However, Kiske started suffering health issues related to his voice shortly before starting the tour, to the point where after the first two shows in Mexico, his involvement for the next dates was unsure. He was cleared to perform by doctors in time for the next show in San José, Costa Rica on 23 October, although his illness forced the band to temporally remove a few songs from their setlist, and to have Deris, Hansen and Gerstner support him more vocally. After accusations from fans of Kiske using lip sync on the more vocally demanding parts of some songs, Kai Hansen confirmed that Kiske had indeed partially used taped vocals, but only for the tour&#x27;s opening show in Monterrey, and because the band feared they would have to cancel the show, as Kiske felt unsure he would be able to perform at all due to his illness. Kiske stated in 2021 that &quot;&quot;it was the hardest tour that I ever did because I caught a freakin’ virus somewhere in South America and I couldn’t get rid of it. Like, after four weeks, like the middle of the tour, I was only able with huge glasses of red wine and painkillers to go on stage because my immune system was going nuts.&quot; With regards to the taped vocals Kiske explained in a 2021 interview &quot;I never did anything like that, and I will never do that again…When you do a playback, you&#x27;ve gotta be doing the same thing as on the recording, and I was, like, holding the microphone to the audience and my voice was coming through the P.A. and stuff like that…I didn&#x27;t have a choice. The other choice was to cancel the show, and the band didn&#x27;t wanna cancel the show.&quot;&quot; On 28–29 October 2017, the band recorded their concerts in São Paulo, Brazil for a future live album and DVD.

About a potential studio album under the Pumpkins United line-up, Deris stated in March 2018: &quot;We certainly have lots and lots of talks [about it]. This summer, if the chemistry goes on like this, then everything is possible. After recording that particular &quot;Pumpkins United&quot; song, we realized that it&#x27;s easy working together. [...] Yeah, it was no problem at all, as if we would have worked together for decades already. So, I could see an upcoming album for the future. If the chemistry stays the way it is now, I definitely would say 99 percent yes, we&#x27;re going for it.&quot; When they were interviewed together in June, Weikath stated: &quot;&quot;We don&#x27;t really feel like starting with it because it&#x27;s going to be a lot of work and it&#x27;s going to take a lot of time and right now, we are kind of comfy with what we are doing, so to say. So, we are not lying. It&#x27;s very easy to say; we are just too lazy to get started with that&quot;.&quot; Hansen &quot;stated &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of ideas in the room for what we do next and so on. But, nothing is kind of decided. Nothing is ripe for the decision. We leave that open, kind of&quot;.&quot;

On 21 August 2018, the band announced that, at the request of their label Nuclear Blast, the Pumpkins United line-up would perdure after 2018, and that a live CD and DVD for the Pumpkins United World Tour would be released in early 2019, followed by a new studio album to be recorded later that year for a planned 2020 release, with Weikath, Hansen and Deris acting as a &quot;songwriting trio&quot;; this will be their first studio album to feature Hansen since &quot;Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part II&quot; in 1988 and the first with Kiske since &quot;Chameleon&quot; in 1993. The Pumpkins United World Tour concluded on 22 December 2018 in Hamburg.

On 4 October 2019, Helloween performed at the 2019 edition of Rock in Rio and on the same day the live DVD/Blu-ray &quot;United Alive&quot; and the live album &quot;United Alive in Madrid&quot;, both recorded during the Pumpkins United World Tour, were released. The first comprises recordings of the band&#x27;s performances in Madrid WiZink Centre (2017), at Wacken Open Air (2018) and in São Paulo (2017) and the second is a recording of the full performance in Madrid, with songs recorded in shows in Prague, São Paulo, Wacken and Santiago acting as bonus tracks.

On 26 November 2019, the band published a video in which they shared that they had begun recording their next album in Hamburg and that they were planning to resume touring in late 2020. On 1 June 2020, Helloween confirmed that they had postponed their fall European tour to the spring of 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The band also announced that they had &quot;decided to shift the release&quot; of their new album to early next year; with six years between &quot;My God-Given Right&quot; and the new album, this marks the longest time between two Helloween studio albums, as the band had never previously spent more than three years without releasing a new studio album. On 25 March 2021, Helloween releases in Japan their new book, an encyclopedia called &quot;Seven Keys United Memorial: Complete Collection of Helloween&quot;.

In March 2021, it was announced that the band&#x27;s first album with the Pumpkins United line-up would be titled &quot;Helloween&quot;, and it was released on 18 June 2021. The album topped German charts and also reached number one in sales in other countries. Following the success of this album, the band launched a comic book and a line of collectible action figures inspired by the bands&#x27; cover artwork and lyrical lore. As of March 2023, according to Kiske, Helloween has begun working on new material for their next album. In May 2023, it was announced that Helloween would be inducted into the Metal Hall of Fame. On November 22, 2023, Helloween announced plans to take the next few months off in order to focus on the making of their next studio album.

On February 15, 2024, it was announced that the band had signed with Reigning Phoenix Music (RPM) and would be releasing their upcoming new album in 2025.

On November 1, 2024, Helloween announced a new live double album called &quot;Live at Budokan&quot;, released on December 13, 2024, also with RPM. It is a recording of the September 16, 2023 performance at Tokyo’s legendary Nippon Budokan.

<doc id="171428" wikidata="Q1682108" url="?curid=171428" title="Vision (spirituality)">
<text>A vision is something seen in a dream, trance, or religious ecstasy, especially a supernatural appearance that usually conveys a revelation. Visions generally have more clarity than dreams, but traditionally fewer psychological connotations. Visions are known to emerge from spiritual traditions and could provide a lens into human nature and reality. Prophecy is often associated with visions.

== Categories ==
Evelyn Underhill distinguishes and categorizes three types of visions:

# Intellectual Visions – The Catholic dictionary defines these as supernatural knowledge in which the mind receives an extraordinary grasp of some revealed truth without the aid of sensible impressions, and mystics describe them as intuitions that leave a deep impression.
# Imaginary – In Teresa of Avila&#x27;s &quot;The Interior Castle&quot;, an imaginary vision is defined as one where nothing is seen or heard by the senses of seeing or hearing, but where the same impression is received that would be produced upon the imagination by the senses if some real object were perceived by them. Niels Christian Hvidt refers to them as visions recognized through mechanisms of the human psyche that are made up of things a soul has acquired through contact with reality.
# Corporeal – A supernatural manifestation of an object to the eyes of the body. It may take place in two ways: either a figure really present strikes the retina and there determines the physical phenomenon of the vision, or an agent superior to man directly modifies the visual organ and produces in the composite a sensation equivalent to that which an external object would produce. Underhill refers to this vision type as &quot;little else than an uncontrolled externalization of inward memories, thoughts, or intuitions&quot;

== Examples ==
Visions are listed in approximately chronological order whenever possible, although some dates may be in dispute.
* The visions of Jeremiah in the first chapter of the Book of Jeremiah, where he sees a branch of an almond tree, and then &quot;a boiling pot from the north&quot;.
* Vision of Isaiah in the first chapter of the Book of Isaiah, predicting the siege of Jerusalem and destruction of the first temple.
* Vision of God in the first chapter of the Book of Ezekiel (6th century BC)
* Vision of a heavenly figure &quot;like a son of man&quot; in Daniel 7:13 (6th century / 2nd century BC)
* Post-resurrection appearances of Jesus
* Paul the Apostle&#x27;s vision of Jesus on the road to Damascus (1st century)
* Marian apparitions (visions or visitations of Mary, mother of Jesus) (1st century AD – present)
* Visions of the afterlife in the martyr accounts of Perpetua and Felicity (2nd century AD)
* Constantine&#x27;s vision of Christ&#x27;s sign (312 AD)
* Saint Fursey’s visions of angelic figures taking him through heaven and hell (7th century AD)
* Jakob Böhme&#x27;s vision (1600 AD), in which he observed the beauty of a beam of sunlight in a pewter dish
* René Descartes&#x27; series of dreams on the night of 11 November 1619, which set the course of his life in science

<text>The is a fictional species created for the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise by Square Enix (originally Square). A galliform bird commonly having yellow feathers, they were first introduced in &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; (1988), and have since featured in some capacity in nearly every &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; title, usually as a means of transport. Chocobos or chocobo-themed characters have played story roles in multiple titles, notably in &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; and &quot;XIII&quot;. A recurring Chocobo also acts as protagonist of the &quot;Chocobo&quot; spin-off series.

The chocobo was created by designer and artist Koichi Ishii, inspired by childhood memories of raising a chick to adulthood. In &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; it was going to be part of a trio of mascot characters alongside the Moogle, but the third planned mascot was scrapped. The chocobo has gone through multiple redesigns for each entry, with a notable contributing artist being Toshiyuki Itahana. In addition to &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, the character has made cameo appearances in other video games. The chocobo has remained an icon of the series, recognised and noted by journalists and fans.

==Creation and development==
The chocobo was created by Koichi Ishii, an artist and game designer who worked on the original &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; (1987) and &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; (1988). The origins of chocobos came from Ishii&#x27;s childhood. When he was at elementary school, he bought a chick at a festival market and formed a strong bond with it. One day while he was away at school, his parents decided they could no longer care for it and gave it to a neighbour who kept chickens. Ishii was very upset when he found out, and kept the memory of the chick into his adult life. All through development of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, Ishii wanted to create an animal companion character. A challenge to himself was creating a character that could not speak but would still be capable of creating an empathic connection with the player. The chocobo&#x27;s design was inspired by the middle stage of his chick before it matured into a chicken. The name &quot;Chocobo&quot; was inspired by the Chocolate Ball, a popular confection in Japan created by Morinaga &amp; Company.

He created the first Chocobo designs in ten minutes during a lunch break, imagining chocobos as a near-constant companion players would connect with, similar to the horse Thunderbolt from &quot;Kōya no Shōnen Isamu&quot;. When Ishii presented the chocobo concept to series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, they were initially rejected, but Sakaguchi eventually included them in &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; in the much-reduced role of temporary mounts. Ishii was annoyed by their reduced role both in &quot;II&quot; and &quot;III&quot; (1990). This anger prompted him to include the chocobo in its intended companion role in the debut &quot;Mana&quot; title &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; (1991), which was the first project where he had creative control. He considered that version to be the original Chocobo, which appeared in other properties around that game. He was originally going to make the chocobo one of a trio of mascot characters alongside the Moogle and a third animal creation that ended up being scrapped.

Ishii originally envisioned the chocobo as a non-vocal character, communicating through its movements and thus being true to its feelings. Going forward, the chocobo sported a distinctive &quot;Kweh&quot; call. A recurring element in games featuring the chocobo is a titular musical theme, created for &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; by Nobuo Uematsu and remixed or redone in subsequent entries. For the remixes he chose, Uematsu always selected a genre which had the same number of syllables as &quot;chocobo&quot;. Though Ishii never intended the chocobo to become a mascot, positive fan reception caused it to become a fixture in the series going forward. It underwent multiple redesigns based on the setting of each game, such as &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot; (2016) where it was designed to appear realistic while still having exotic flourishes. They were initially left out of the world design of &quot;Final Fantasy XVI&quot; (2023), but staff protests prompted scenario writer Kazutoyo Maehiro to incorporate them.

The most notable version features in the long-running &quot;Chocobo&quot; spin-off series, which share a protagonist in the form of a male Chocobo. This incarnation of Chocobo was designed by Toshiyuki Itahana, who created a more cute design that would fit into a roguelike game design while also appealing to a wider market than the &quot;sleek&quot; designs of Chocobos from the main series. His early attempts to make a more monster-like version did not work due to the planned tone, which focused on a light-hearted story. He also created versions of Chocobo that had him wearing &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; job outfits. Recurring artist Yoshitaka Amano created a concept for the Chocobo summon from &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot;, though this design differed markedly from its usual appearance. The in-game sprite, while a typical chocobo design, reused colors from the Amano artwork. Due to his workload at the time, he had no memory of his chocobo design.

==Appearances==
Across the series, chocobos are portrayed as galliform birds, often with yellow feathers but also coming in other colors such as black. Their primary role, particularly in earlier titles, was acting as transportation for the party across the world map. From &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; onwards, Chocobos have appeared in more substantial roles within racing minigames, and as summoned monsters. Other pieces of media within the series, including &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot;, have featured chocobo imagery in some way. Several spin-off titles including &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy XIII-2&quot; have included chocobos as playable or support characters. In &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; and &quot;XIV&quot;, chocobos were included in player-focused activities, featuring them as both pets and means of transport. A notable narrative use of Chocobos was in the opening section of &quot;Final Fantasy Type-0&quot;, where a chocobo was gunned down and their owner was unable to save it, setting the game&#x27;s darker emotional tone.

Some chocobos have acted as individual characters. The first was Boco, a chocobo from &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; who accompanied the protagonist Bartz. Ishii was pleased with this interpretation, feeling that the developers of &quot;V&quot; had understood his intentions with the Chocobo character. Boco was referenced through a Chocobo character within &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;, which featured multiple callbacks to earlier &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles. Another notable Chocobo character is Chocolina from &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot; and its sequels &quot;XIII-2&quot; and &quot;Lightning Returns&quot;. Originally a chocobo chick bought as a pet by character Sazh Katzroy, she is granted the ability to take human shape by the Goddess Etro, and takes on the role of a merchant and quest giver. The chick was originally going to play a role in combat in &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot;, but this was scrapped. The Eidolon Odin, who serves &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot; protagonist Lightning, is put in the form of a chocobo during the events of &quot;Lightning Returns&quot;, with Lightning able to ride him in one of the game&#x27;s areas. The developers did this to allow players to see Lightning&#x27;s emotional connection with Odin. Both Boco and Chocolina were featured, alongside other chocobo-related characters, in &quot;World of Final Fantasy&quot;.

Chocobos also feature in a dedicated self-titled &quot;Chocobo&quot; subseries. Beginning in 1997 with &quot;Chocobo no Fushigi na Dungeon&quot;, a spin-off of the &quot;Mystery Dungeon&quot; franchise, the series spans nearly twenty entries across game consoles and mobile platforms within multiple genres. While one of the most prolific &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; subseries in terms of games released, relatively few have been published outside Japan. &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot; featured a chocobo character called Alpha in a questline surrounding a machine called Omega, with its design referencing Itahana&#x27;s artwork and its inclusion being a homage to Chocobo&#x27;s clashes with Omega within the &quot;Chocobo&quot; subseries.

Within Square Enix&#x27;s library, chocobos also saw playable cameo appearances in &quot;Tobal 2&quot;, &quot;Legend of Mana&quot;, and &quot;Dragon Quest X&quot;. It also cameoed beyond the company in &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Golf&quot;, and &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins&quot; as part of a crossover with &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot;. Chocobo merchandise has been released, including a rubber duck, a plush baby Chocobo, and coffee mugs. Square Enix designed a chocobo character costume for the release of &quot;Chocobo Tales&quot;.

==Reception==
The Chocobo has been referred to or considered to be a series mascot by fans and journalists since its introduction, becoming synonymous with the series&#x27;s visual identity. In a feature on the series for &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;, Samuel Roberts referred to the Chocobo as an iconic creature since its introduction in &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot;. Anthony John Agnello, writing for &quot;The Escapist&quot;, praised the Chocobo as an adorable mainstay within both the main series and its spin-off series and media. In a feature for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the Chocobo was 9th in a list of 18 video game animal characters.

In 2008, Boco was voted by &quot;Joystiq&quot; as the 20th most desired character to be placed in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; fighting game &quot;&quot;. In 2007, the Chocobo was listed by &quot;IGN&quot; as one of the most likely Square Enix characters that could appear in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, comparing them to the Slime from &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; and saying that &quot;the Chocobo could be an excellent enemy for Yoshi&quot;. For &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, the site Anime News Network regarded the caring for chocobos as an appealing sidequest due to the benefits that come from it and thus wanted the remake to have it.

<text>Road Runner is a 1966 album by Junior Walker &amp; the All-Stars. The band&#x27;s second album, it reached #6 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top R&amp;B Albums chart and #64 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Albums chart, launching four hit singles. First released on record by Motown&#x27;s Soul label in the US and Tamla/Motown internationally, it has been multiply reissued on cassette and compact disc. It has also been remastered and reissued in conjunction with the band&#x27;s following studio record, &quot;Home Cookin&#x27;&quot;, as &quot;Road Runner &amp; Home Cookin&quot;&#x27;.

==Songs==
Among the album&#x27;s notable songs were four charting singles. Peak among them at #3 on the R&amp;B Singles, #18 on the Pop Singles charts and #22 on the UK Singles was the Holland–Dozier–Holland song &quot;How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)&quot;, which had previously hit for Marvin Gaye in 1964. Not far behind, &quot;(I&#x27;m a) Road Runner&quot;, by the same songwriters, reached #4 on Black Singles and #20 on Pop Singles, while surpassing &quot;How Sweet It Is&quot; to reach #12 in the UK. &quot;Pucker Up Buttercup&quot; did not crack the top 10, but reached #11 Black Singles and #31 Pop Singles. A distant fourth, Junior Walker &amp; the Allstar&#x27;s cover of the 1959 Barrett Strong hit &quot;Money (That&#x27;s What I Want)&quot; reached #35 Black Singles and #52 Pop Singles.

The album is titled for &quot;(I&#x27;m a) Road Runner&quot;, which had been previously released on Junior Walker &amp; The All-Star&#x27;s 1965 debut album, &quot;Shotgun&quot;. It proved so successful in its March 1966 single that it was included and singled out on
the band&#x27;s follow-up. Although &quot;How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)&quot; surpassed it in two out of three charts, &quot;(I&#x27;m a) Road Runner&quot; is regarded as a superior offering from Junior Walker &amp; The All-Stars, one of three songs by the band (along with &quot;Way Back Home&quot; and &quot;Shotgun&quot; included in 1999&#x27;s Da Capo Press publication &quot;The heart of rock &amp; soul: the 1001 greatest singles ever made&quot;. Ranking it second of the three at #467, music critic David Marsh, identifying Junior Walker as &quot;the one gutbucket star in Motown&#x27;s heaven&quot;, says &quot;even...Robert Johnson] never saw the like of this blend of booming bass, tanked-up tambourine, and gritty guitar. Much less Walker&#x27;s fractured saxophone.&quot; Sometimes known as &quot;I&#x27;m a Road Runner&quot;, the song has been covered by a number of rock bands, including Fleetwood Mac (on album &quot;Penguin&quot;) and Peter Frampton (on &quot;I&#x27;m in You&quot;), and also by comedian Bill Cosby on &quot;Bill Cosby Sings Hooray For the Salvation Army Band!&quot;

<text>A plot device or plot mechanism
is any technique in a narrative used to move the plot forward.

A clichéd plot device may annoy the reader and a contrived or arbitrary device may confuse the reader, causing a loss of the suspension of disbelief. However, a well-crafted plot device, or one that emerges naturally from the setting or characters of the story, may be entirely accepted, or may even be unnoticed by the audience.

== Stories using plot devices ==
Many stories, especially in the fantasy genre, feature an object or objects with some great magical power, such as a crown, sword, or jewel. Often what drives the plot is the hero&#x27;s need to find the object and use it for good, before the villain can use it for evil, or if the object has been broken by the villains, to retrieve each piece that must be gathered from each antagonist to restore it, or, if the object itself is evil, to destroy it. In some cases destroying the object will lead to the destruction of the villain.

In the Indiana Jones film series, each film portrays Jones on the hunt for a mystical artifact. In &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, he is trying to retrieve the Ark of the Covenant; in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, Jones is on a search for the Holy Grail. This plot device is also used in the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; tale of &quot;The City of Brass,&quot; in which a group of travelers on an archaeological expedition journeys across the Sahara to find a brass vessel that Solomon once used to trap a jinn.

Several books in the Harry Potter series orient around a search for a special object. In &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, Harry believes there is a magical stone in Hogwarts with special powers. Lord Voldemort needs this stone to bring back his body, and Harry looks for the stone first to prevent Voldemort&#x27;s return.

The One Ring from J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; has been labeled a plot device, since the quest to destroy it drives the entire plot of the novel. However, British Classical scholar Nick Lowe said: &quot;Tolkien, on the whole, gets away with the trick by minimizing the arbitrariness of the ring&#x27;s plot-power and putting more stress than his imitators on the way the ring&#x27;s power moulds the character of its wielder and vice-versa.&quot;

== Examples ==

=== Deus ex machina ===

The term &quot;deus ex machina&quot; is used to refer to a narrative ending in which an improbable event is used to resolve all problematic situations and bring the story to a (generally happy) conclusion.

The Latin phrase &quot;deus ex machina&quot; has its origins in the conventions of Greek tragedy, and refers to situations in which a mechane (crane) was used to lower actors playing a god or gods onto the stage at the end of a play.

The Greek tragedian Euripides is notorious for using this plot device as a means to resolve a hopeless situation. For example, in Euripides&#x27; play &quot;Alcestis&quot;, the eponymous heroine agrees to give up her own life to Death in exchange for sparing the life of her husband, Admetus. In doing so, however, Admetus grows to regret his choice, realizing that the grief of her death would never leave him. Admetus is seized by guilt and sadness, wishing to keep her or die alongside her, but held by his obligations to raise their children. In the end, though, Heracles shows up and seizes Alcestis from Death, restoring her to life and freeing Admetus from the grief that consumed him. Another example of a &quot;deus ex machina&quot; is Gandalf in &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; With the help of seemingly limitless magical capabilities, he rescues the other main characters from all sorts of troubles. Likewise, the eagles in both &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; perform unexpected rescues, serving both as the eucatastrophic emissary and the agent of redemption. The first person known to have criticized the device was Aristotle in his &quot;Poetics&quot;, where he argued that the resolution of a plot must arise internally, following from previous action of the play.

===Love triangle===
A frequently used plot mechanism in romances and dramas is the love triangle, a conflict where two characters compete for the affection of a third character.

=== MacGuffin ===

A MacGuffin is a term, popularized by film director Alfred Hitchcock, referring to a plot device wherein a character pursues an object, though the object&#x27;s actual nature is not important to the story. Another object would work just as well if the characters treated it with the same importance. Regarding the MacGuffin, Alfred Hitchcock stated, &quot;In crook stories it is almost always the necklace and in spy stories it is almost always the papers.&quot; This contrasts with, for example, the One Ring from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, whose very nature is essential to the entire story. Not all film directors or scholars agree with Hitchcock&#x27;s understanding of a MacGuffin. According to George Lucas, &quot;The audience should care about it [the MacGuffin] almost as much as the dueling heroes and villains on-screen&quot;. Thus MacGuffins, according to Lucas, are important to the characters and plot.

MacGuffins are sometimes referred to as &quot;plot coupons&quot;, especially if multiple ones are required, as the protagonist only needs to &quot;collect enough plot coupons and trade them in for a dénouement&quot;. The term was coined by Nick Lowe.

=== Plot voucher ===
A &quot;plot voucher&quot;, as defined by Nick Lowe, is an object given to a character (especially to the protagonist) before they encounter an obstacle that requires the use of the object. An example of a plot voucher is a gift received by a character, which later impedes a deadly bullet.

=== Quibble ===

A quibble is based on an argument that an agreement&#x27;s intended meaning holds no legal value and that only the exact, literal words agreed on apply. For example, William Shakespeare used a quibble in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;: Portia saves Antonio in a court of law by pointing out that the agreement called for a pound of flesh, but no blood, so Shylock can collect only if he sheds no blood.

=== Red herring ===

The function of a red herring is to divert the audience&#x27;s attention away from something significant. Red herrings are very common plot devices in mystery, horror, and crime stories. The typical example is in whodunits, in which facts are presented so that the audience is tricked into thinking that an innocent character is the murderer.

=== Shoulder angel ===

A shoulder angel is a plot device used for either dramatic or humorous effect in animation and comic strips (and occasionally in live-action television). The angel represents conscience and is often accompanied by a shoulder devil representing temptation. They are handy for easily showing inner conflict of a character. Usually, the angel is depicted on or hovering near the right shoulder and the devil or demon on the left, as the left side traditionally represents dishonesty or impurity (see Negative associations of left-handedness in language). 

The idea of a shoulder angel and devil consulting the person in the center of the dispute is a tripartite view of the divided soul, that contributes to a rich tradition involving Plato&#x27;s Chariot Allegory as well as id, ego and super-ego from Freudian psychoanalysis. The difference with other views is that the shoulder angel and devil emphasize the universal ideas of good and bad. 

This device was humorously used in &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; (2000) and its sequel, &quot;Kronk&#x27;s New Groove&quot;: the Kronk consults his shoulder angel and devil in order to determine whether to follow Yzma&#x27;s orders or not.

<text>Henry Pelham (25 September 1694 – 6 March 1754) was a British Whig statesman who served as Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1743 until his death in 1754. He was the younger brother of Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, who served in Pelham&#x27;s government and succeeded him as prime minister. Pelham is generally considered to have been Britain&#x27;s third prime minister, after Robert Walpole and the Earl of Wilmington.

Pelham&#x27;s premiership was relatively uneventful in terms of domestic affairs, although it was during his premiership that Great Britain experienced the tumult of the 1745 Jacobite uprising. In foreign affairs, Britain fought in several wars. On Pelham&#x27;s death, his brother Newcastle took full control of the British government.
==Early life==
Pelham, Newcastle&#x27;s younger brother, was a younger son of Thomas Pelham, 1st Baron Pelham, and his wife, the former Grace Pelham, Baroness Pelham of Laughton, the daughter of Gilbert Holles, 3rd Earl of Clare, and Grace Pierrepont. He was educated at Westminster School, and matriculated at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge at Easter 1709, then migrated to Hart Hall, Oxford (the present-day Hertford College), matriculating on 6 September 1710, upon the appointment of his tutor Richard Newton as Principal of Hart Hall.

As a volunteer he served in Dormer&#x27;s regiment at the Battle of Preston in 1715 and spent some time on the Continent. He was returned as Member of Parliament for Seaford in Sussex by his brother, the Duke of Newcastle, at a by-election on 28 February 1717 and represented it until 1722.

==Career==
===Government===
Through strong family influence, and the recommendation of Robert Walpole, he was chosen in 1721 as Lord of the Treasury. At the 1722 general election he was returned as MP for Sussex county.

In 1724 he entered the ministry as Secretary at War, but this office he exchanged in 1730 for the more lucrative one of Paymaster of the Forces. He made himself conspicuous by his support of Walpole on the question of the excise. He, Newcastle, and the Prime Minister would often meet at Houghton Hall in Norfolk, where they would draw up much of the country&#x27;s policy. These meetings became known as the Norfolk Congress. With Walpole, he served as a founding governor of the popular charity the Foundling Hospital when it opened its doors in 1739. Like his brother, the Duke of Newcastle, Pelham was an active freemason of the Premier Grand Lodge of England, active alongside John Theophilus Desaguliers.

In 1742 a union of parties resulted in the formation of an administration in which Pelham became Prime Minister the following year, succeeding the Earl of Wilmington after his death.

==Prime Minister==
=== Appointment ===

The first year of Pelham&#x27;s premiership is regarded as a continuation of the Carteret ministry, with Lord Carteret continuing as Secretary of State for the Northern Department with responsibility for foreign affairs; Carteret was close to King George II. Pelham served as First Lord of the Treasury, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons.

In November 1744, the Pelhams forced Lord Carteret out of the ministry: Pelham bluntly told the king that either Carteret step down, or the Pelhamites would, leaving His Majesty without a government. Thereafter Pelham shared power with his brother, the Duke of Newcastle upon Tyne. Pelham was regarded as the leading figure, but rank and influence made his brother very powerful in the Cabinet. In spite of a genuine attachment, there were occasional disputes between them, which sometimes led to further difficulties.

=== &quot;The Broad-Bottomed Administration&quot; ===
Being strongly in favour of peace, Pelham carried on the War of the Austrian Succession with languor and indifferent success, but the country, wearied of the interminable struggle, was disposed to acquiesce in his foreign policy almost without a murmur. King George II, thwarted in his own favourite schemes, made overtures in February 1746 to Lord Bath, but his purpose was upset by the resignation of the two Pelhams (Henry and Newcastle), who, after a two-day hiatus in which Bath and Carteret (now earl Granville) proved unable to form a ministry, resumed office at the king&#x27;s request. One of their terms was to insist that the king should have &#x27;total confidence&#x27; in a ministry; rather than partial grudging acceptance of the Whigs.

The era was essential to the development of prime ministerial power as being entirely dependent on a Commons majority, rather than royal prerogative interventions. While the king struggled with his headstrong son, Frederick, Prince of Wales, his son&#x27;s uncertain constitutional position was high in the Leicester House party set. In 1748 Frederick, a Tory, planned to bring down the Pelhamites at a general election due the following year. The Prime Minister called an early poll in 1748 by asking the king to dissolve Parliament in 1747. The prince and his father, the king, grew to hate one another with unspeakable animosity. But one consequence was a closer relationship between Henry Pelham and the sovereign. When he finally died in 1754, the king remarked &quot;Now I shall have no more peace.&quot; The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle had been signed in 1748 leading inexorably to a number of cost-cutting budgetary measures.

=== Economic reform ===
The Army and Navy spending shrunk from £12 m to £7 million per annum. Pelham promised to reduce interest rates through introduction of a balancing act measure from 4% to 3% by 1757. He also assisted a fund to reduce the National Debt. In 1749, the Consolidation Act was passed, reorganising the Royal Navy. On 20 March 1751, the British calendar was reorganised as well (New Year&#x27;s Day became 1 January); Britain would adopt the Gregorian calendar one year later. In 1752 he was able to reduce the land tax from 4 s to 2 s in the pound (an effective reduction from 20% to 10%).

One social consequence of the press gangs going to sea in an expansive navy fleet was the growth of industrial processes necessary for warfare. The distillation of gin reduced the price of alcohol, resulting in widespread drunkenness, demonstrated clearly by Hogarth in &quot;Gin Lane&quot;. Preaching in favour of temperance, and social problems caused by drunken soldiers and sailors, persuaded the administration to introduce the Gin Acts. The Gin Act 1751 was the last of four that had largely failed to prevent serious social unrest, including riots in London, reduced the number licensed dealers and sellers of liquor. By restricting supply the consumption dropped and price fell helping to manage the problem.

=== Death ===
Two of Pelham&#x27;s final acts were the Jewish Naturalization Act 1753, which allowed Jews to become naturalized by application to Parliament, and the Marriage Act 1753, which enumerated the minimum age of consent for marriage. Upon his death, his brother (the aforementioned Duke of Newcastle upon Tyne) took over government.

===Achievements===
His very defects were among the chief elements of Pelham&#x27;s success, for one with a strong personality, moderate amount self-respect, or haughty conceptions of statesmanship could not have restrained the discordant elements of the cabinet for any length of time the way he did. Moreover, he possessed tact and a thorough acquaintance with the forms of the House of Commons. Whatever quarrels or insubordination might have existed within the cabinet, they never broke out into open revolt. His foreign policy followed Walpole&#x27;s model of emphasizing peace and ending wars. His financial policy was a major success once peace had been signed in 1748 to end the War of the Austrian Succession. He demobilized the armed forces, and reduced government spending from £12 million to £7 million. He refinanced the national debt dropping the interest from 4% to 3%. In 1752 he reduced the land tax from four shillings to two shillings in the pound; that is, from 20% to 10%. Historians Stephen Brumwell and W. A. Speck describe him as being an effective politician:

==Personal life==

Pelham married Lady Catherine Manners, daughter of the 2nd Duke of Rutland, on 31 October 1726 in the Parish of St James, City of Westminster. They had four daughters:
* Catherine Pelham-Clinton, Countess of Clinton (1727–1760), married 1744 Henry Clinton, 9th Earl of Lincoln, who by this marriage subsequently became the 2nd Duke of Newcastle (Newcastle-under-Lyme)
* Frances (1728–1775), died unmarried
* Grace Watson, Baroness Sondes (1735–1777), married 1752 the Hon. Lewis Watson, who in 1760 was created Baron Sondes
* Mary (1739–1???), died unmarried

When Pelham was elevated to Prime Minister, he began construction of a house located at 22 Arlington Street in St James&#x27;s, Westminster. He hired the architect William Kent to build the structure in two phases. Kent died in 1748 and the work was completed by Stephen Wright in 1754.

Pelham died in 1754 and was buried in All Saints&#x27; Church, Laughton, East Sussex. His personal papers were inherited by his son-in-law and now form part of the Newcastle (Clumber) Collection held at the department of Manuscripts and Special Collections, The University of Nottingham.

==Legacy==
He was one of the first of a relatively few prime ministers who never acceded to a peerage. Others include George Grenville (died as an MP), William Pitt the Younger (died in office), Spencer Perceval (died in office), George Canning  (died in office), Sir Robert Peel (died as an MP, though was a baronet in his own right), William Ewart Gladstone (declined a peerage), Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman (declined a peerage but died as an MP), Bonar Law (died as an MP), Ramsay MacDonald (died as an MP), Neville Chamberlain (declined a peerage but died as an MP), Sir Winston Churchill (declined a peerage), Sir Edward Heath (declined a peerage), Sir John Major (declined a peerage), Sir Tony Blair (declined a peerage), Gordon Brown (declined a peerage), Boris Johnson, and Liz Truss.

<text>In the Christian tradition, a nativity scene (also known as a manger scene, crib, crèche ( or ), or in Italian presepio or presepe, or Bethlehem) is the special exhibition, particularly during the Christmas season, of art objects representing the birth of Jesus. While the term &quot;nativity scene&quot; may be used of any representation of the very common subject of the Nativity of Jesus in art, it has a more specialized sense referring to seasonal displays, in particular sets of individual sculptural figures and props that are arranged for display.

Other characters from the nativity story, such as shepherds, sheep, and angels may be displayed near the manger in a barn (or cave) intended to accommodate farm animals, as described in the Gospel of Luke. A donkey and an ox are typically depicted in the scene, and the Magi and their camels, described in the Gospel of Matthew, are also included. Many also include a representation of the Star of Bethlehem. Several cultures add other characters and objects that may or may not be Biblical.

The first living nativity scene, attributed to Saint Francis of Assisi, occurred in 1223 in the Italian town of Greccio. Francis had been inspired by his visit to the Holy Land, where he had been shown Jesus&#x27;s traditional birthplace.

Distinctive nativity scenes and traditions have been created around the world, and are displayed during the Christmas season in churches, homes, shopping malls, and other venues, and occasionally on public lands and in public buildings. Nativity scenes have not escaped controversy, and in the United States of America and in secular countries like France, their inclusion on public lands or in public buildings has provoked court challenges.

==Origins and early history==
The tradition of the nativity scene comes from Italy. One of the earliest representation in art of the nativity was found in the early Christian Roman catacomb of Saint Valentine. It dates to about AD 380. Another, of similar date, is beneath the pulpit in Sant&#x27;Ambrogio, Milan, carved on Stilicho&#x27;s sarcophagus.

The first seasonal nativity scene, which seems to have been a dramatic rather than sculptural rendition, is attributed to Saint Francis of Assisi. Its creation is described by Saint Bonaventure in his &quot;Life of Saint Francis of Assisi&quot; .

Saint Francis&#x27; manger scene is said to have been enacted at Christmas 1223 in a cave near the Sanctuary of Greccio in the Central Italy town of Greccio. The very small chapel where it is said to have taken place survives. The painting over its altar, and others before 1400, by Giotto at the Assisi Lower Church, and by Antonio Vite in Pistoia, depict Saint Francis kneeling and placing a small baby into a chest-like manger. Giotto adds a miniature ox and ass.
A substantial set of stone figures by Arnolfo di Cambio, a leading sculptor of the day, was made for Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome around 1290. The surviving portion includes figures for the Holy Family, the Three Kings, and the ox and ass from the neck up. 

The scene&#x27;s popularity inspired much imitation throughout Christian countries, and in the early modern period sculpted cribs, often exported from Italy, were set up in many Christian churches and homes. These elaborate scenes reached their artistic apogee in the Papal State, in Emilia, in the Kingdom of Naples and in Genoa. In the tradition of the Moravian Church, nativity scenes have been the center of the Christmas putz, which is &quot;built to tell the Good News of the coming of the Christ Child&quot; and &quot;is the Gospel in miniature from Isaiah’s prophecy and Mary’s annunciation to the visit of the wisemen and the flight into Egypt.&quot; 

For Moravian Christians, the nativity scene serves to celebrate &quot;the story of the wonder of Christ’s birth so that the Son of God can be welcomed into the hearts of the home at the Christmas.&quot; By the end of the 19th century nativity scenes became widely popular in many Christian denominations, and many versions in various sizes and made of various materials, such as terracotta, paper, wood, wax, and ivory, were marketed, often with a backdrop setting of a stable.

Different traditions of nativity scenes emerged in different countries. Hand-painted &quot;santons&quot; are popular in Provence. In southern Germany, Austria and Trentino-Alto Adige, the wooden figurines are handcut. Colorful &quot;szopki&quot; are typical in Poland.

In the United States, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City annually displays a Neapolitan Baroque nativity scene before a blue spruce.

==Components==
===Static nativity scenes===

Static nativity scenes depict Jesus, Mary, Joseph, farm animals, and sometimes other characters. While most home nativity scenes are packed away at Christmas or shortly thereafter, nativity scenes in churches usually remain on display until the feast of the Baptism of the Lord.

The nativity scene may not accurately reflect gospel events. With no basis in the gospels, for example, the shepherds, the Magi, and the ox and ass may be displayed together at the manger. The art form can be traced back to eighteenth-century Naples, Italy. Neapolitan nativity scenes do not represent Bethlehem at the time of Jesus but the life of the Naples of 1700, during the Bourbon period. Families competed with each other to produce the most elegant and elaborate scenes and so, next to the Child Jesus, to the Holy Family and the shepherds, were placed ladies and gentlemen of the nobility, representatives of the bourgeoisie of the time, vendors with their banks and miniatures of cheese, bread, sheep, pigs, ducks or geese, and typical figures of the time like Roma fortune tellers predicting the future, people playing cards, housewives doing shopping, dogs, cats and chickens.

===Living nativity scenes===

In southern Italy, living nativity scenes (&quot;presepe vivente&quot;) are extremely popular. They may be elaborate affairs, featuring not only the classic nativity scene but also a mock rural 19th-century village, complete with artisans in traditional costumes working at their trades. These attract many visitors and have been televised on RAI. In 2010, the old city of Matera in Basilicata hosted the world&#x27;s largest living nativity scene of the time, which was performed in the historic center, Sassi.

===Animals in nativity scenes===
A donkey (or ass) and an ox typically appear in nativity scenes. Besides the necessity of animals for an operating manger, this is an allusion to the Book of Isaiah: &quot;the ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master&#x27;s crib; but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider&quot; (Isaiah 1:3). The Gospels mention neither an ox and nor a donkey, however. The first Christian writer to mention the ox and the ass in the stable in Bethlehem is Origen of Alexandria. Another source for the tradition might be the extracanonical text, the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew of the 7th century.
==Traditions==
===Australia===
Christmas is celebrated by Australians in a number of ways. In Australia, it is summer season and is very hot during Christmas time.

During the Christmas time, locals and visitors visit places around their towns and suburbs to view the outdoor and indoor displays. All over the towns, the places are lit with colorful and modern spectacular lighting displays. The displays of nativity scenes with Aussie featured native animals like kangaroos and koalas are also evident.

In Melbourne, a traditional and authentic nativity Scene is on display at St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Parish, Dandenong North. This annual Australian Nativity Scene creator and artist Wilson Fernandez has been building and creating the traditional nativity scenes since 2003 at St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Parish.

To mark this special event, Most Reverend Denis Hart Archbishop of Melbourne celebrated the Vigil Mass and blessed the nativity scene on Saturday, 14 December 2013.

Australian Nativity Scene (ANS) gained popularity and recognition over the years and in December 2016, the Australian Channel 7 captured the news of this famous creativity.

Shalom World, the Catholic, commercial-free, 24/7, HD family entertainment channel, reached out to the world with a live telecast on Australian Nativity Scene on 24 December 2022. On 2 December 2023, Australian Nativity Scene marked its 20 years—a great moment for St Elizabeth’s Parish in Dandenong. To mark this occasion, Archbishop Peter A Comensoli celebrated the Vigil Mass on the first Sunday of Advent (Saturday 2 December). Here is an article to mark the celebration - ‘Back in time’: Australian Nativity Scene celebrates 20 years

===Canada===
Bethlehem Live is an all-volunteer living nativity produced by Gateway Christian Community Church in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The production includes a reconstruction of the ancient town of Bethlehem and seven individual vignettes. There is also an annual, highly publicized nativity scene at the St. Patrick&#x27;s Basilica, Ottawa in Ottawa, Ontario.

===Czech Republic===

The Czech Republic, and the cultures represented in its predecessors i.e. Czechoslovakia and the lands of former Bohemia, have a long tradition regarding &quot;betlémy&quot; (literally &quot;Bethlehems&quot;), crèches. The tradition of home nativity scenes is often traced to the 1782 ban of church and institutional crèches by emperor Joseph II, officially responding to public disturbances and the resulting &quot;loss of dignity&quot; of such displays. As this followed the Edict of Toleration proclaimed the previous year, it reduced State support of the Catholic church in this multi-confessional land.

====Třebechovice pod Orebem====

The Museum of Nativity Scenes in Třebechovice pod Orebem has over 400 examples dated from the 18th until early 20th century, including the Probošt&#x27;s mechanical Christmas crib, so called &quot;Třebechovice&#x27;s Bethlehem&quot;.
The issue of cost arose, and paper-cut crèches, &quot;the crèche of the poor&quot;, became one major expression, as well as wood-carved ones, some of them complex and detailed. Many major Czech artists, sculptors and illustrators have as a significant part of their legacy the crèches that they created.

The following people are known for creating Czech paper crèches: 
*Mikoláš Aleš (1852–1913), painter famed for his murals of the National Theatre
*Josef Wenig (1885–1939), illustrator, theatre decorator and playwright
*Josef Lada (1887–1957), known for his work in &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot;
*Marie Fischerová-Kvěchová (1892–1984), illustrator of a large number of children books

====Krýza&#x27;s crèche====

Tomáš Krýza (1838–1918) built in a period of over 60 years a nativity scene covering 60 m2 (length 17 m, size and height 2 m) which contains 1,398 figures of humans and animals, of which 133 are moveable. It is on display in southern Bohemian town Jindřichův Hradec. It figures as the largest mechanical nativity scene in the world in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;.

====Gingerbread crèches====
Gingerbread nativity scenes and cribs in the church of St. Matthew in Šárka (Prague 6 Dejvice) have around 200 figures and houses, the tradition dates from since 1972; every year new ones are baked and after holidays eaten.

===Italy===
Christmas in Italy begins on 8 December with the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, the day on which traditionally Christmas trees are erected, and ends on 6 January of the following year with Epiphany.

The Neapolitan nativity scene is a representation of the birth of Jesus traditionally set in Naples in the 18th century. The Neapolitan crib art has remained unchanged for centuries, becoming part of the most consolidated and followed Christmas traditions of the city. Famous in Naples, in fact, is the well-known via dei presepi (via San Gregorio Armeno) which offers a showcase of all the local crafts concerning the nativity scene. 

Moreover, there are numerous city and non-city museums (such as the museum of San Martino or the Royal Palace of Caserta) in which historical pieces or entire scenes set during the birth of Jesus are exhibited.

===Philippines (&quot;Belén&quot;)===
In the majority-Catholic Philippines, miniature, full-scale, or giant dioramas or tableaus of the nativity scene are known as &quot;Belén&quot; (from the Spanish name for Bethlehem). They were introduced by the Spanish since the 16th century. They are an iconic and ubiquitous Christmas symbol in the Philippines, on par with the parol (Christmas lanterns depicting the Star of Bethlehem) which are often incorporated into the scene as the source of illumination. Both the &quot;Belén&quot; and the &quot;parol&quot; were the traditional Christmas decorations in Filipino homes before Americans introduced the Christmas tree. Most churches in the Philippines also transform their altars into a &quot;Belén&quot; at Christmas. They are also found in schools (which also hold nativity plays), government buildings, commercial establishments, and in public spaces.

The city of Tarlac holds an annual competition of giant &quot;Belén&quot; in a festival known as &quot;Belenismo sa Tarlac&quot;.

===United States===
Perhaps the best known nativity scene in America is the Neapolitan Baroque Crèche displayed annually in the Medieval Sculpture Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Its backdrop is a 1763 choir screen from the Cathedral of Valladolid and a twenty-foot blue spruce decorated with a host of 18th-century angels. The nativity figures are placed at the tree&#x27;s base. The crèche was the gift of Loretta Hines Howard in 1964, and the choir screen was the gift of The William Randolph Hearst Foundation in 1956. Both this presepio and the one displayed in Pittsburgh originated from the collection of Eugenio Catello.

A life-size nativity scene has been displayed annually at Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah for several decades as part of the large outdoor Christmas displays sponsored by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Each holiday season, from Light Up Night in November through Epiphany in January, the Pittsburgh Crèche is on display in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Pittsburgh Creche is the world&#x27;s only authorized replica of the Vatican&#x27;s Christmas crèche, on display in St. Peter&#x27;s Square in Rome. Pittsburgh&#x27;s Carnegie Museum of Art also displays a Neapolitan presepio. The presepio was handcrafted between 1700 and 1830, and re-creates the nativity within a panorama of 18th-century Italian village life. More than 100 human and angelic figures, along with animals, accessories, and architectural elements, cover 250 square feet and create a depiction of the nativity as seen through the eyes of Neapolitan artisans and collectors.

The Radio City Christmas Spectacular, an annual musical holiday stage show presented at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, features a Living Nativity segment with live animals.

In 2005, President of the United States of America, George W. Bush and his wife, First Lady of the United States, Laura Bush displayed an 18th-century Italian &quot;presepio&quot;. The &quot;presepio&quot; was donated to the White House in the last decades of the 20th century.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh annually display Neapolitan Baroque nativity scenes which both originated from the collection of Eugenio Catello.

==Associations and notable collections==
The Universalis Foederatio Praesepistica, World association of Friends of Cribs was founded in 1952, counting today 20 national associations dedicated to this subject. The Central office is in Austria.

In the United States and Canada Friends of the Creche has over 200 members, with a major conference every two years. FotC maintains a list of permanent exhibits of nativity scenes in the United States and a list of permanent exhibits of nativity scenes in other parts of the world.

The Bavarian National Museum displays a notable collection of nativity scenes from the fifteenth through nineteenth centuries.

Every year in Lanciano, Abruzzo (Italy), a nativity scene exhibition (called in Italian &quot;Riscopriamo il presepe&quot;) takes place at Auditorium Diocleziano, usually until 6 January. An average of one hundred nativity scenes are shown, coming from every region of Italy. There are also many nativity scenes made by local kindergarten, primary, secondary and high school. The event is organised by Associazione Amici di Lancianovecchia

Museums dedicated specifically to paper nativity scenes exist in Pečky (Czech Republic).

==Controversies==
===Europe===
Nativity scenes have on some occasions been the subject of controversy. A life-sized scene in the United Kingdom featuring waxwork celebrities provoked outrage in 2004, and, in Spain, a city council forbade the exhibition of a traditional toilet humor character in a public nativity scene.

=== United States ===
Nativity scenes have been involved in controversies and lawsuits surrounding the principle of accommodationism.

In 1969, the American Civil Liberties Union did not want a nativity scene at The Ellipse. After the matter was resolved by the United States Court of Appeals, the nativity scene was not displayed in 1973.

In 1985, the United States Supreme Court ruled in &quot;ACLU v. Scarsdale, New York&quot; that nativity scenes on public lands were unconstitutional unless they also displayed non-religious symbols. This principle was further clarified in 1989, when Pittsburgh attorney Roslyn Litman argued, and the Supreme Court in &quot;County of Allegheny v. ACLU&quot; ruled, that a crèche placed on the grand staircase of the Allegheny County Courthouse in Pittsburgh, PA violated the Establishment Clause, because the &quot;principal or primary effect&quot; of the display was to advance religion.

In 2006, a lawsuit by the Alliance Defense Fund, a Christian legal organization in the United States, was brought against the state of Washington when it permitted a public display of a holiday tree and a menorah but not a nativity scene. Because of the lawsuit, the decision was made to permit a nativity scene to be displayed in the rotunda of the state Capitol, in Olympia, as long as other symbols of the season were included.

In 2013, Gov. Rick Perry signed into Texas law the Merry Christmas bill which would allow school districts in Texas to display nativity scenes.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) claimed in 2014 that animals in living displays lacked proper care and suffered abuse. In the United States, nativity scenes on public lands and in public buildings have provoked court challenges, and the prankish theft of ceramic or plastic nativity figurines from outdoor displays has become commonplace.

===Spain===

There is a regional tradition in the Catalonia region where an additional figure is added to the nativity scene: the . It depicts a person defecating. In 2005, the Barcelona city council provoked a public outcry by commissioning a nativity scene which did not include a .

<text>A Partridge Family Christmas Card is a Christmas album (and the fourth studio album) by the Partridge Family, released in November 1971. The album&#x27;s case contains a reproduction of a Christmas card signed by the whole Partridge Family, the stars of a 1970s sitcom. The song &quot;My Christmas Card to You&quot; was original, but the remainder of the tracks were standards. Like most of the Partridge Family songs, the lead vocals are sung by David Cassidy, who played Keith Partridge in the show. The album also features one of the few Partridge Family recordings featuring Shirley Jones as the lead singer (&quot;The Christmas Song&quot;).

&quot;A Partridge Family Christmas Card&quot; was the best-selling Christmas album in the United States during the Christmas season of 1971. It was the number 1 album on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s special Christmas Albums sales chart for all four weeks that the magazine published the chart that year.

The album was reissued in 1992 on CD and is also available as mp3 downloads.

Lead guitarist for Metallica, Kirk Hammett, cited this record to be the first album he owned during an appearance on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;

<doc id="171473" wikidata="Q355444" url="?curid=171473" title="Ambrose Burnside">
<text>Ambrose Everts Burnside (May 23, 1824 – September 13, 1881) was an American army officer and politician who became a senior Union general in the Civil War and three-time Governor of Rhode Island, as well as being a successful inventor and industrialist.
He was responsible for some of the earliest victories in the Eastern theater, but was then promoted above his abilities, and is mainly remembered for two disastrous defeats, at Fredericksburg and the Battle of the Crater (Petersburg). Although an inquiry cleared him of blame in the latter case, he never regained credibility as an army commander.

Burnside was a modest and unassuming individual, mindful of his limitations, who had been propelled to high command against his will. He could be described as a genuinely unlucky man, both in battle and in business, where he was robbed of the rights to a successful cavalry firearm that had been his own invention. His spectacular growth of whiskers became known as &quot;sideburns&quot;, deriving from the two parts of his surname.

==Early life==
Burnside was born in Liberty, Indiana, and was the fourth of nine children of Edghill and Pamela (or Pamilia) Brown Burnside, a family of Scottish, Scotch-Irish and English origins. His great-great-grandfather Robert Burnside (1725–1775) was born in Scotland and settled in the Province of South Carolina. His father was a native of South Carolina; he was a slave owner who freed his slaves when he relocated to Indiana. Ambrose attended Liberty Seminary as a young boy, but his education was interrupted when his mother died in 1841; he was apprenticed to a local tailor, eventually becoming a partner in the business.

As a young officer before the Civil War, Burnside was engaged to Charlotte &quot;Lottie&quot; Moon, who left him at the altar. When the minister asked if she took him as her husband, Moon is said to have shouted &quot;No siree Bob!&quot; before running out of the church. Moon is best known for her espionage for the Confederacy during the Civil War. Later, Burnside arrested Moon, her younger sister Virginia &quot;Ginnie&quot; Moon, and their mother. He kept them under house arrest for months but never charged them with espionage.

==Early military career==

He obtained an appointment to the United States Military Academy in 1843 through his father&#x27;s political connections and his own interest in military affairs. During his early tenure at the academy, a clerical error was made listing his middle name as Everett, rather than Everts. He graduated in 1847, ranking 18th in a class of 47, and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Artillery. He traveled to Veracruz for the Mexican–American War, but he arrived after hostilities had ceased and performed mostly garrison duty around Mexico City.

At the close of the war, Lt. Burnside served two years on the western frontier under Captain Braxton Bragg in the 3rd U.S. Artillery, a light artillery unit that had been converted to cavalry duty, protecting the Western mail routes through Nevada to California. In August 1849, he was wounded by an arrow in his neck during a skirmish against Apaches in Las Vegas, New Mexico. He was promoted to 1st lieutenant on December 12, 1851.
In 1852, he was assigned to Fort Adams, Newport, Rhode Island, and he married Mary Richmond Bishop of Providence, Rhode Island, on April 27 of that year. The marriage lasted until Mary&#x27;s death in 1876, but was childless.

In October 1853, Burnside resigned his commission in the United States Army and was appointed commander of the Rhode Island state militia with the rank of major general. He held this position for two years.

After leaving the Regular Army, Burnside devoted his time and energy to the manufacture of a firearm that bears his name: the Burnside carbine. President Buchanan&#x27;s Secretary of War John B. Floyd contracted the Burnside Arms Company to equip a large portion of the Army with his carbine, mostly cavalry and induced him to establish extensive factories for its manufacture. The Bristol Rifle Works were no sooner complete than another gunmaker allegedly bribed Floyd to break his $100,000 contract with Burnside.

Burnside ran as a Democrat for one of the Congressional seats in Rhode Island in 1858 and was defeated in a landslide. The burdens of the campaign and the destruction by fire of his factory contributed to his financial ruin, and he was forced to assign his firearm patents to others. He then went west in search of employment and became treasurer of the Illinois Central Railroad, where he worked for and became friendly with George B. McClellan, who later became one of his commanding officers. Burnside became familiar with corporate attorney Abraham Lincoln, future president of the United States, during this time period.

==Civil War==
===First Bull Run===
At the outbreak of the Civil War, Burnside was a colonel in the Rhode Island Militia. He raised the 1st Rhode Island Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and was appointed its colonel on May 2, 1861. Two companies of this regiment were then armed with Burnside carbines.

Within a month, he ascended to brigade command in the Department of northeast Virginia. He commanded the brigade without distinction at the First Battle of Bull Run in July and took over division command temporarily for wounded Brig. Gen. David Hunter. His 90-day regiment was mustered out of service on August 2; he was promoted to brigadier-general of volunteers on August 6 and was assigned to train provisional brigades in the Army of the Potomac.
===North Carolina===
Burnside commanded the Coast Division or North Carolina Expeditionary Force from September 1861 until July 1862, three brigades assembled in Annapolis, Maryland, which formed the nucleus for his future IX Corps. He conducted a successful amphibious campaign that closed more than 80% of the North Carolina sea coast to Confederate shipping for the remainder of the war. This included the Battle of Elizabeth City, fought on February 10, 1862, on the Pasquotank River near Elizabeth City, North Carolina.

The participants were vessels of the United States Navy&#x27;s North Atlantic Blockading Squadron opposed by vessels of the Confederate Navy&#x27;s Mosquito Fleet; the latter were supported by a shore-based battery of four guns at Cobb&#x27;s Point (now called Cobb Point) near the southeastern border of the town. The battle was a part of the campaign in North Carolina that was led by Burnside and known as the Burnside Expedition. The result was a Union victory, with Elizabeth City and its nearby waters in their possession and the Confederate fleet captured, sunk, or dispersed.

Burnside was promoted to major general of volunteers on March 18, 1862, in recognition of his successes at the battles of Roanoke Island and New Bern, the first significant Union victories in the Eastern Theater. In July, his forces were transported north to Newport News, Virginia, and became the IX Corps of the Army of the Potomac.

Burnside was offered command of the Army of the Potomac following Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan&#x27;s failure in the Peninsula Campaign. He refused this opportunity because of his loyalty to McClellan and the fact that he understood his own lack of military experience, and detached part of his corps in support of Maj. Gen. John Pope&#x27;s Army of Virginia in the Northern Virginia Campaign. He received telegrams at this time from Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter which were extremely critical of Pope&#x27;s abilities as a commander, and he forwarded on to his superiors in concurrence. This episode later played a significant role in Porter&#x27;s court-martial, in which Burnside appeared as a witness.

Burnside again declined command following Pope&#x27;s debacle at Second Bull Run.

===Antietam===

Burnside was given command of the Right Wing of the Army of the Potomac (the I Corps and his own IX Corps) at the start of the Maryland Campaign for the Battle of South Mountain, but McClellan separated the two corps at the Battle of Antietam, placing them on opposite ends of the Union battle line and returning Burnside to command of just the IX Corps. Burnside implicitly refused to give up his authority and acted as though the corps commander was first Maj. Gen. Jesse L. Reno (killed at South Mountain) and then Brig. Gen. Jacob D. Cox, funneling orders through them to the corps. This cumbersome arrangement contributed to his slowness in attacking and crossing what is now called Burnside&#x27;s Bridge on the southern flank of the Union line.

Burnside did not perform an adequate reconnaissance of the area, and he did not take advantage of several easy fording sites out of range of the enemy; his troops were forced into repeated assaults across the narrow bridge, which was dominated by Confederate sharpshooters on the high ground. By noon, McClellan was losing patience. He sent a succession of couriers to motivate Burnside to move forward, ordering one aide, &quot;Tell him if it costs 10,000 men he must go now.&quot; He further increased the pressure by sending his inspector general to confront Burnside, who reacted indignantly: &quot;McClellan appears to think I am not trying my best to carry this bridge; you are the third or fourth one who has been to me this morning with similar orders.&quot; The IX Corps eventually broke through, but the delay allowed Maj. Gen. A. P. Hill&#x27;s Confederate division to come up from Harpers Ferry and repulse the Union breakthrough. McClellan refused Burnside&#x27;s requests for reinforcements, and the battle ended in a tactical stalemate.

===Fredericksburg===

After McClellan failed to pursue General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s retreat from Antietam, Lincoln ordered McClellan&#x27;s removal on November 5, 1862, and selected Burnside to replace him on November 7, 1862. Burnside reluctantly obeyed this order, the third such in his brief career, in part because the courier told him that, if he refused it, the command would go instead to Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, whom Burnside 
disliked. Burnside assumed charge of the Army of the Potomac in a change of command ceremony at the farm of Julia Claggett in New Baltimore, Virginia. McClellan visited troops to bid them farewell. Columbia Claggett, Julia Claggett&#x27;s daughter-in-law, testified after the war that a &quot;parade and transfer of the Army to Gen. Burnside took place on our farm in front of our house in a change of command ceremony at New Baltimore, Virginia on November 9, 1862.&quot;

President Abraham Lincoln pressured Burnside to take aggressive action and approved his plan on November 14 to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia. This plan led to a humiliating and costly Union defeat at the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13. His advance upon Fredericksburg was rapid, but the attack was delayed when the engineers were slow to marshal pontoon bridges for crossing the Rappahannock River, as well as his own reluctance to deploy portions of his army across fording points. This allowed Gen. Lee to concentrate along Marye&#x27;s Heights just west of town and easily repulse the Union attacks.

Assaults south of town were also mismanaged, which were supposed to be the main avenue of attack, and initial Union breakthroughs went unsupported. Burnside was upset by the failure of his plan and by the enormous casualties of his repeated, futile frontal assaults, and declared that he would personally lead an assault by the IX corps. His corps commanders talked him out of it, but relations were strained between the general and his subordinates. Accepting full blame, he offered to retire from the U.S. Army, but this was refused. Burnside&#x27;s detractors labeled him the &quot;Butcher of Fredericksburg&quot;.

In January 1863, Burnside launched a second offensive against Lee, but it bogged down in winter rains before anything was accomplished, and has derisively been called the Mud March. In its wake, he asked that several openly insubordinate officers be relieved of duty and court-martialed; he also offered to resign. Lincoln quickly accepted the latter option, and on January 26 replaced Burnside with Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, one of the officers who had conspired against him.

===East Tennessee===
Burnside offered to resign his commission altogether but Lincoln declined, stating that there could still be a place for him in the army. Thus, he was placed back at the head of the IX Corps and sent to command the Department of the Ohio, encompassing the states of Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and Illinois. This was a quiet area with little activity, and the President reasoned that Burnside could not get himself into too much trouble there. However, antiwar sentiment was riding high in the Western states as they had traditionally carried on a great deal of commerce with the South, and there was little in the way of abolitionist sentiment there or a desire to fight for the purpose of ending slavery. Burnside was thoroughly disturbed by this trend and issued a series of orders forbidding &quot;the expression of public sentiments against the war or the Administration&quot; in his department; this finally climaxed with General Order No. 38, which declared that &quot;any person found guilty of treason will be tried by a military tribunal and either imprisoned or banished to enemy lines&quot;.

On May 1, 1863, Ohio Congressman Clement L. Vallandigham, a prominent opponent of the war, held a large public rally in Mount Vernon, Ohio in which he denounced President Lincoln as a &quot;tyrant&quot; who sought to abolish the Constitution and set up a dictatorship. Burnside had dispatched several agents to the rally who took down notes and brought back their &quot;evidence&quot; to the general, who then declared that it was sufficient grounds to arrest Vallandigham for treason. A military court tried him and found him guilty of violating General Order No. 38, despite his protests that he was expressing his opinions publicly. Vallandigham was sentenced to imprisonment for the duration of the war and was turned into a martyr by antiwar Democrats. Burnside next turned his attention to Illinois, where the Chicago &quot;Times&quot; newspaper had been printing antiwar editorials for months. The general dispatched a squadron of troops to the paper&#x27;s offices and ordered them to cease printing.

Lincoln had not been asked or informed about either Vallandigham&#x27;s arrest or the closure of the Chicago &quot;Times&quot;. He remembered the section of General Order No. 38 which declared that offenders would be banished to enemy lines and finally decided that it was a good idea so Vallandigham was freed from jail and sent to Confederate hands. Meanwhile, Lincoln ordered the Chicago &quot;Times&quot; to be reopened and announced that Burnside had exceeded his authority in both cases. The President then issued a warning that generals were not to arrest civilians or close down newspapers again without the White House&#x27;s permission.

Burnside also dealt with Confederate raiders such as John Hunt Morgan.

In the Knoxville Campaign, Burnside advanced to Knoxville, Tennessee, first bypassing the Confederate-held Cumberland Gap and ultimately occupying Knoxville unopposed; he then sent troops back to the Cumberland Gap. Confederate commander Brig. Gen. John W. Frazer refused to surrender in the face of two Union brigades but Burnside arrived with a third, forcing the surrender of Frazer and 2,300 Confederates.

Union Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans was defeated at the Battle of Chickamauga, and Burnside was pursued by Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, against whose troops he had battled at Marye&#x27;s Heights. Burnside skillfully outmaneuvered Longstreet at the Battle of Campbell&#x27;s Station and was able to reach his entrenchments and safety in Knoxville, where he was briefly besieged until the Confederate defeat at the Battle of Fort Sanders outside the city. Tying down Longstreet&#x27;s corps at Knoxville contributed to Gen. Braxton Bragg&#x27;s defeat by Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant at Chattanooga. Troops under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman marched to Burnside&#x27;s aid, but the siege had already been lifted; Longstreet withdrew, eventually returning to Virginia.

===Overland Campaign===
Burnside was ordered to take the IX Corps back to the Eastern Theater, where he built it up to a strength of over 21,000 in Annapolis, Maryland. The IX Corps fought in the Overland Campaign of May 1864 as an independent command, reporting initially to Grant; his corps was not assigned to the Army of the Potomac because Burnside outranked its commander Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, who had been a division commander under Burnside at Fredericksburg. This cumbersome arrangement was rectified on May 24 just before the Battle of North Anna, when Burnside agreed to waive his precedence of rank and was placed under Meade&#x27;s direct command.

Burnside fought at the battles of Wilderness and Spotsylvania Court House, where he did not perform in a distinguished manner, attacking piecemeal and appearing reluctant to commit his troops to the costly frontal assaults that characterized these battles. After North Anna and Cold Harbor, he took his place in the siege lines at Petersburg.

===The Crater===

As the two armies faced the stalemate of trench warfare at Petersburg in July 1864, Burnside agreed to a plan suggested by a regiment of former coal miners in his corps, the 48th Pennsylvania: to dig a mine under a fort named Elliot&#x27;s Salient in the Confederate entrenchments and ignite explosives there to achieve a surprise breakthrough. The fort was destroyed on July 30 in what is known as the Battle of the Crater.

Because of interference from Meade, Burnside was ordered, only hours before the infantry attack, not to use his division of black troops, which had been specially trained for the assault: instead, he was forced to use untrained white troops. He could not decide which division to choose as a replacement, so he had his three subordinate commanders draw lots.

The division chosen by chance was that commanded by Brig. Gen. James H. Ledlie, who had failed to brief the men on what was expected of them, and was observed to be drinking liquor with Brig. Gen Edward Ferrero in a bombproof shelter well behind the lines during the battle, providing no leadership at all.

As a result, Ledlie&#x27;s men entered the huge crater instead of going around it, became trapped, and were subjected to heavy fire from Confederates around the rim, resulting in high casualties. in the end his forces suffered 3,800 casualties 

As a result of the Crater fiasco, Burnside was relieved of command on August 14 and sent on &quot;extended leave&quot; by Grant. He was never recalled to duty for the remainder of the war. A court of inquiry later placed the blame for the defeat on Burnside, Ledlie and Ferrero. In December, Burnside met with President Lincoln and General Grant about his future. He was contemplating resignation, but Lincoln and Grant requested that he remain in the Army. At the end of the interview, Burnside wrote, &quot;I was not informed of any duty upon which I am to be placed.&quot; He finally resigned his commission on April 15, 1865, after Lee&#x27;s surrender at Appomattox.

The United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War later exonerated Burnside and placed the blame for the Union defeat at the Crater on General Meade for requiring the specially trained USCT (United States Colored Troops) men to be withdrawn.

==Postbellum career==
After his resignation, Burnside was employed in numerous railroad and industrial directorships, including the presidencies of the Cincinnati and Martinsville Railroad, the Indianapolis and Vincennes Railroad, the Cairo and Vincennes Railroad, and the Rhode Island Locomotive Works.

He was elected to three one-year terms as Governor of Rhode Island, serving from May 29, 1866, to May 25, 1869. He was nominated by the Republican Party to be their candidate for governor in March 1866, and Burnside was elected governor in a landslide on April 4, 1866. This began Burnside&#x27;s political career as a Republican, as he had been a Democrat before the war.

Burnside was a Companion of the Massachusetts Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, a military society of Union officers and their descendants, and served as the Junior Vice Commander of the Massachusetts Commandery in 1869. He was commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) veterans&#x27; association from 1871 to 1872, and also served as the Commander of the Department of Rhode Island of the GAR. At its inception in 1871, the National Rifle Association of America chose him as its first president.

During a visit to Europe in 1870, Burnside attempted to mediate between the French and the Germans in the Franco-Prussian War. He was registered at the offices of Drexel, Harjes &amp; Co., Geneva, week ending November 5, 1870. Drexel Harjes was a major lender to the new French government after the war, helping it to repay its massive war reparations.

In 1876 Burnside was elected as commander of the New England Battalion of the Centennial Legion, the title of a collection of 13 militia units from the original 13 states, which participated in the parade in Philadelphia on July 4, 1876, to mark the centennial of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

In 1874 Burnside was elected by the Rhode Island Senate as a U.S. Senator from Rhode Island, was re-elected in 1880, and served until his death in 1881. Burnside continued his association with the Republican Party, playing a prominent role in military affairs as well as serving as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee in 1881.

==Death and burial==

Burnside died suddenly of &quot;neuralgia of the heart&quot; (Angina pectoris) on the morning of September 13, 1881, at his home in Bristol, Rhode Island, accompanied only by his doctor and family servants.

Burnside&#x27;s body lay in state at City Hall until his funeral on September 16. A procession took his casket, in a hearse drawn by four black horses, to the First Congregational Church for services which were attended by many local dignitaries. Following the services, the procession made its way to Swan Point Cemetery for burial. Businesses and mills were closed for much of the day, and &quot;thousands&quot; of mourners from &quot;all towns of the state and many places in Massachusetts and Connecticut&quot; crowded the streets of Providence for the occasion.

==Assessment and legacy==
Personally, Burnside was always very popular, both in the army and in politics. He made friends easily, smiled a lot, and remembered everyone&#x27;s name. His professional military reputation, however, was less positive, and he was known for being obstinate, unimaginative, and unsuited both intellectually and emotionally for high command. Grant stated that he was &quot;unfitted&quot; for the command of an army and that no one knew this better than Burnside himself. Knowing his capabilities, he twice refused command of the Army of the Potomac, accepting only the third time when the courier told him that otherwise the command would go to Joseph Hooker. Jeffry D. Wert described Burnside&#x27;s relief after Fredericksburg in a passage that sums up his military career:

Bruce Catton summarized Burnside:
===Sideburns===

Burnside was noted for his unusual beard, joining strips of hair in front of his ears to his mustache but with the chin clean-shaven; the word &quot;burnsides&quot; was coined to describe this style. The syllables were later reversed to give &quot;sideburns&quot;.

<doc id="171477" wikidata="Q337222" url="?curid=171477" title="Duke of York">
<text>Duke of York is a title of nobility in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Since the 15th century, it has, when granted, usually been given to the second son of English (later British) monarchs. The equivalent title in the Scottish peerage was Duke of Albany. However, King George II and King George III granted the titles &quot;Duke of York and Albany&quot;.

Initially granted in the 14th century in the Peerage of England, the title &quot;Duke of York&quot; has been created eight times. The title &quot;Duke of York and Albany&quot; has been created three times. These occurred during the 18th century, following the 1707 unification of the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland into a single, united realm. The double naming was done so that a territorial designation from each of the previously separate realms could be included.

The current Duke of York is Prince Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III. The present Duke&#x27;s marriage produced two daughters, and he has remained unmarried since his 1996 divorce. As long as Prince Andrew has no legitimate male heirs, the title Duke of York will again revert to the Crown upon his death.

==History==
In the Middle Ages, York was the main city of the North of England and the see of the Archbishop of York from AD 735. Yorkshire is England&#x27;s largest shire in area.

York under its Viking name &quot;Jorvik&quot; was a petty kingdom in the early medieval period. In the interval between the fall of independent Jorvik under Eric Bloodaxe, last king of Jorvik (d. 954), and the first creation of the Dukedom of York, there were a few earls of York.

The title Duke of York was first created in the Peerage of England in 1385 for Edmund of Langley. His son Edward, who inherited the title, was killed at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. The title passed to Edward&#x27;s nephew Richard, the son of Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge (who had been executed for plotting against King Henry V). The younger Richard managed to obtain a restoration of the title, but when his eldest son, who inherited the title, became king in 1461 as Edward IV, the title merged into the Crown.

The title was next created for Richard of Shrewsbury, second son of King Edward IV. Richard was one of the Princes in the Tower, and, as he disappeared and was presumed dead without heirs, the title was considered extinct.

The third creation was for Henry Tudor, second son of King Henry VII. When his elder brother Arthur, Prince of Wales, died in 1502, Henry became heir-apparent to the throne. When Henry ultimately became King Henry VIII in 1509, his titles merged into the crown.

The title was created for the fourth time for Charles Stuart, second son of James I. When his elder brother, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, died in 1612, Charles became heir-apparent. He was created Prince of Wales in 1616 and eventually became Charles I in 1625 when the title again merged into the Crown.

The fifth creation was in favour of James Stuart, the second son of Charles I. New York, its capital Albany, and New York City, were named for this particular Duke of Albany and York. In 1664, Charles II of England granted American territory between the Delaware and Connecticut rivers to his younger brother James. Following its capture by the English the former Dutch territory of New Netherland and its principal port, New Amsterdam, were named the Province and City of New York in James&#x27;s honour. After the founding, the Duke gave part of the colony to proprietors George Carteret and John Berkeley. Fort Orange, north on the Hudson River, was renamed Albany after James&#x27;s Scottish title. When his elder brother, King Charles II, died without heirs, James succeeded to the throne as King James II of England and King James VII of Scotland, and the title once again merged into the Crown.

During the 18th century the double dukedom of York and Albany was created a number of times in the Peerage of Great Britain. The title was first held by Duke Ernest Augustus of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Bishop of Osnabrück, the youngest brother of King George I. He died without heirs, and the title reverted to the Crown. The second creation of the double dukedom was for Prince Edward, younger brother of King George III, who also died without heirs, having never married. Again, the title reverted to the Crown. The third and last creation of the double dukedom was for Prince Frederick Augustus, the second son of King George III. He served as Commander-in-Chief of the British Army for many years, and was the original &quot;Grand old Duke of York&quot; in the popular rhyme. He too died without legitimate heirs, leaving the title, once again, to revert to the Crown.

The sixth creation of the Dukedom of York (without being combined with Albany) was for Prince George, second son of the, then current, Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII. He was created Duke of York following the death of his elder brother, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale. The title merged with the Crown when George succeeded his father as King George V.

The seventh creation was for Prince Albert, second son of King George V, and younger brother of the future King Edward VIII. Albert came unexpectedly to the throne when his brother abdicated, and took the name George VI, the Dukedom then merging into the Crown.

The title was created for the eighth time for Prince Andrew, second son of Queen Elizabeth II. As of 2022, the only legitimate offspring are his two daughters from his marriage to Sarah, Duchess of York. Thus, if he has no future (legitimate) sons, the title will again become extinct—reverting to the Crown—upon his death.

Aside from the first creation, every time the Dukedom of York has been created it has had only one occupant, that person either inheriting the throne or dying without male heirs.

=== Pretenders ===
In the late 15th Century, Perkin Warbeck unsuccessfully claimed the Crown by claiming the identity of Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York.

In the early 18th century, the eldest son of the overthrown King James II &amp; VII and thus Jacobite claimant to the throne, James Francis Edward Stuart, known to his opponents as the Old Pretender, granted the title &quot;Duke of York&quot; (in the Jacobite Peerage) to his own second son, Henry, using his purported authority as King James III &amp; VIII. Henry later became a cardinal in the Catholic church and is thus known as the Cardinal Duke of York. Since James was not recognised as king by English law, the grant is also not recognised as a legitimate creation.

===Military Music===
There is also military march titled Duke of York which is used as an inspection piece or slow march. It is in 4/4 time, D Major with a form of AABBCCDD. Gordon Ashman in 1991 maintains that the melody was composed in 1805, soon after the Duke of York became Colonel of the Grenadier Guards, and notes it is still in use today as a regimental slow-march. James Merryweather however, researched the melody and found it was composed by John Gamidge in 1789, to be played by the York Waits.
