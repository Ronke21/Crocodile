<text>Isotope analysis is the identification of isotopic signature, abundance of certain stable isotopes of chemical elements within organic and inorganic compounds. Isotopic analysis can be used to understand the flow of energy through a food web, to reconstruct past environmental and climatic conditions, to investigate human and animal diets, for food authentification, and a variety of other physical, geological, palaeontological and chemical processes. Stable isotope ratios are measured using mass spectrometry, which separates the different isotopes of an element on the basis of their mass-to-charge ratio.

==Tissues affected==

Isotopic oxygen is incorporated into the body primarily through ingestion at which point it is used in the formation of, for archaeological purposes, bones and teeth. The oxygen is incorporated into the hydroxylcarbonic apatite of bone and tooth enamel.

Bone is continually throughout the lifetime of an individual. Although the rate of turnover of isotopic oxygen in hydroxyapatite is not fully known, it is assumed to be similar to that of collagen; approximately 10 years. Consequently, should an individual remain in a region for 10 years or longer, the isotopic oxygen ratios in the bone hydroxyapatite would reflect the isotopic oxygen ratios present in that region.

Teeth are not subject to continual remodelling and so their isotopic oxygen ratios remain constant from the time of formation. The isotopic oxygen ratios, then, of teeth represent the ratios of the region in which the individual was born and raised. Where deciduous teeth are present, it is also possible to determine the age at which a child was weaned. Breast milk production draws upon the body water of the mother, which has higher levels of 18O due to the preferential loss of 16O through sweat, urine, and expired water vapour.

While teeth are more resistant to chemical and physical changes over time, both are subject to post-depositional diagenesis. As such, isotopic analysis makes use of the more resistant phosphate groups, rather than the less abundant hydroxyl group or the more likely diagenetic carbonate groups present.

== Applications ==

Isotope analysis has widespread applicability in the natural sciences. These include numerous applications in the biological, earth and environmental sciences.

=== Archaeology ===
==== Reconstructing ancient diets ====

Archaeological materials, such as bone, organic residues, hair, or sea shells, can serve as substrates for isotopic analysis. Carbon, nitrogen and zinc isotope ratios are used to investigate the diets of past people; these isotopic systems can be used with others, such as strontium or oxygen, to answer questions about population movements and cultural interactions, such as trade.

Carbon isotopes are analysed in archaeology to determine the source of carbon at the base of the foodchain. Examining the 12C/13C isotope ratio, it is possible to determine whether animals and humans ate predominantly C3 or C4 plants. Potential C3 food sources include wheat, rice, tubers, fruits, nuts and many vegetables, while C4 food sources include millet and sugar cane. Carbon isotope ratios can also be used to distinguish between marine, freshwater, and terrestrial food sources.

Carbon isotope ratios can be measured in bone collagen or bone mineral (hydroxylapatite), and each of these fractions of bone can be analysed to shed light on different components of diet. The carbon in bone collagen is predominantly sourced from dietary protein, while the carbon found in bone mineral is sourced from all consumed dietary carbon, included carbohydrates, lipids, and protein.

Nitrogen isotopes can be used to infer soil conditions, with enriched δ15N used to infer the addition of manure. A complication is that enrichment also occurs as a result of environmental factors, such as wetland denitrification, salinity, aridity, microbes, and clearance. δ13C and δ15N measurements on medieval manor soils has shown that stable isotopes can differentiate between crop cultivation and grazing activities, revealing land use types such as cereal production and the presence of fertilization practices at historical sites.

To obtain an accurate picture of palaeodiets, it is important to understand processes of diagenesis that may affect the original isotopic signal. It is also important for the researcher to know the variations of isotopes within individuals, between individuals, and over time.

==== Sourcing archaeological materials ====

Isotope analysis has been particularly useful in archaeology as a means of characterization. Characterization of artifacts involves determining the isotopic composition of possible source materials such as metal ore bodies and comparing these data to the isotopic composition of analyzed artifacts. A wide range of archaeological materials such as metals, glass and lead-based pigments have been sourced using isotopic characterization. Particularly in the Bronze Age Mediterranean, lead isotope analysis has been a useful tool for determining the sources of metals and an important indicator of trade patterns. Interpretation of lead isotope data is, however, often contentious and faces numerous instrumental and methodological challenges. Problems such as the mixing and re-using of metals from different sources, limited reliable data and contamination of samples can be difficult problems in interpretation.

=== Ecology ===
All biologically active elements exist in a number of different isotopic forms, of which two or more are stable. For example, most carbon is present as 12C, with approximately 1% being 13C. The ratio of the two isotopes may be altered by biological and geophysical processes, and these differences can be utilized in a number of ways by ecologists. 
The main elements used in isotope ecology are carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen and sulfur, but also include silicon, iron, and strontium.

====Stable isotope analysis in aquatic ecosystems====

Stable isotopes have become a popular method for understanding aquatic ecosystems because they can help scientists in understanding source links and process information in marine food webs. These analyses can also be used to a certain degree in terrestrial systems. Certain isotopes can signify distinct primary producers forming the bases of food webs and trophic level positioning. The stable isotope compositions are expressed in terms of delta values (δ) in permil (‰), i.e. parts per thousand differences from a standard. They express the proportion of an isotope that is in a sample. The values are expressed as:

: &quot;δX&quot; = [(&quot;R&quot;sample / &quot;R&quot;standard) – 1] × 103

where X represents the isotope of interest (e.g., 13C) and R represents the ratio of the isotope of interest and its natural form (e.g., 13C/12C). Higher (or less negative) delta values indicate increases in a sample&#x27;s isotope of interest, relative to the standard, and lower (or more negative) values indicate decreases. The standard reference materials for carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur are Pee Dee Belamnite limestone, nitrogen gas in the atmosphere, and Cañon Diablo meteorite respectively. Analysis is usually done using a mass spectrometer, detecting small differences between gaseous elements. Analysis of a sample can cost anywhere from $30 to $100. Stable isotopes assist scientists in analyzing animal diets and food webs by examining the animal tissues that bear a fixed isotopic enrichment or depletion vs. the diet. Muscle or protein fractions have become the most common animal tissue used to examine the isotopes because they represent the assimilated nutrients in their diet. The main advantage to using stable isotope analysis as opposed to stomach content observations is that no matter what the status is of the animal&#x27;s stomach (empty or not), the isotope tracers in the tissues will give us an understanding of its trophic position and food source. The three major isotopes used in aquatic ecosystem food web analysis are 13C, 15N and 34S. While all three indicate information on trophic dynamics, it is common to perform analysis on at least two of the previously mentioned three isotopes for better understanding of marine trophic interactions and for stronger results.

=====Hydrogen-2=====

The ratio of 2H, also known as deuterium, to 1H has been studied in both plant and animal tissue. Hydrogen isotopes in plant tissue are correlated with local water values but vary based on fractionation during photosynthesis, transpiration, and other processes in the formation of cellulose. A study on the isotope ratios of tissues from plants growing within a small area in Texas found tissues from CAM plants were enriched in deuterium relative to C4 plants. Hydrogen isotope ratios in animal tissue reflect diet, including drinking water, and have been used to study bird migration and aquatic food webs.

=====Carbon-13=====

Carbon isotopes aid us in determining the primary production source responsible for the energy flow in an ecosystem. The transfer of 13C through trophic levels remains relatively the same, except for a small increase (an enrichment &lt; 1 ‰). Large differences of δ13C between animals indicate that they have different food sources or that their food webs are based on different primary producers (i.e. different species of phytoplankton, marsh grasses.) Because δ13C indicates the original source of primary producers, the isotopes can also help us determine shifts in diets, both short term, long term or permanent. These shifts may even correlate to seasonal changes, reflecting phytoplankton abundance. Scientists have found that there can be wide ranges of δ13C values in phytoplankton populations over a geographic region. While it is not quite certain as to why this may be, there are several hypotheses for this occurrence. These include isotopes within dissolved inorganic carbon pools (DIC) may vary with temperature and location and that growth rates of phytoplankton may affect their uptake of the isotopes. δ13C has been used in determining migration of juvenile animals from sheltered inshore areas to offshore locations by examining the changes in their diets. A study by Fry (1983) studied the isotopic compositions in juvenile shrimp of south Texas grass flats. Fry found that at the beginning of the study the shrimp had isotopic values of δ13C = -11 to -14‰ and 6-8‰ for δ15N and δ34S. As the shrimp matured and migrated offshore, the isotopic values changed to those resembling offshore organisms (δ13C= -15‰ and δ15N = 11.5‰ and δ34S = 16‰).

=====Sulfur-34=====

While there is no enrichment of 34S between trophic levels, the stable isotope can be useful in distinguishing benthic vs. pelagic producers and marsh vs. phytoplankton producers. Similar to 13C, it can also help distinguish between different phytoplankton as the key primary producers in food webs. The differences between seawater sulfates and sulfides (c. 21‰ vs -10‰) aid scientists in the discriminations. Sulfur tends to be more plentiful in less aerobic areas, such as benthic systems and marsh plants, than the pelagic and more aerobic systems. Thus, in the benthic systems, there are smaller δ34S values.

=====Nitrogen-15=====

Nitrogen isotopes indicate the trophic level position of organisms (reflective of the time the tissue samples were taken). There is a larger enrichment component with δ15N because its retention is higher than that of 14N. This can be seen by analyzing the waste of organisms. Cattle urine has shown that there is a depletion of 15N relative to the diet. As organisms eat each other, the 15N isotopes are transferred to the predators. Thus, organisms higher in the trophic pyramid have accumulated higher levels of 15N ( and higher δ15N values) relative to their prey and others before them in the food web. Numerous studies on marine ecosystems have shown that on average there is a 3.2‰ enrichment of 15N vs. diet between different trophic level species in ecosystems. In the Baltic sea, Hansson et al. (1997) found that when analyzing a variety of creatures (such as particulate organic matter (phytoplankton), zooplankton, mysids, sprat, smelt and herring,) there was an apparent fractionation of 2.4‰ between consumers and their apparent prey.

In addition to trophic positioning of organisms, δ15N values have become commonly used in distinguishing between land derived and natural sources of nutrients. As water travels from septic tanks to aquifers, the nitrogen rich water is delivered into coastal areas. Waste-water nitrate has higher concentrations of 15N than the nitrate that is found in natural soils in near shore zones. For bacteria, it is more convenient for them to uptake 14N as opposed to 15N because it is a lighter element and easier to metabolize. Thus, due to bacteria&#x27;s preference when performing biogeochemical processes such as denitrification and volatilization of ammonia, 14N is removed from the water at a faster rate than 15N, resulting in more 15N entering the aquifer. 15N is roughly 10-20‰ as opposed to the natural 15N values of 2-8‰. The inorganic nitrogen that is emitted from septic tanks and other human-derived sewage is usually in the form of &lt;chem&gt;NH4+&lt;/chem&gt;. Once the nitrogen enters the estuaries via groundwater, it is thought that because there is more 15N entering, that there will also be more 15N in the inorganic nitrogen pool delivered and that it is picked up more by producers taking up N. Even though 14N is easier to take up, because there is much more 15N, there will still be higher amounts assimilated than normal. These levels of δ15N can be examined in creatures that live in the area and are non migratory (such as macrophytes, clams and even some fish). This method of identifying high levels of nitrogen input is becoming a more and more popular method in attempting to monitor nutrient input into estuaries and coastal ecosystems. Environmental managers have become more and more concerned about measuring anthropogenic nutrient inputs into estuaries because excess in nutrients can lead to eutrophication and hypoxic events, eliminating organisms from an area entirely.

=====Oxygen-18=====

Analysis of the ratio of 18O to 16O in the shells of the Colorado Delta clam was used to assess the historical extent of the estuary in the Colorado River Delta prior to construction of upstream dams.

=== Forensic science ===

A recent development in forensic science is the isotopic analysis of hair strands. Hair has a recognisable growth rate of 9-11mm per month or 15 cm per year. Human hair growth is primarily a function of diet, especially drinking water intake. The stable isotopic ratios of drinking water are a function of location, and the geology that the water percolates through. 87Sr, 88Sr and oxygen isotope variations are different all over the world. These differences in isotopic ratio are then biologically &#x27;set&#x27; in our hair as it grows and it has therefore become possible to identify recent geographic histories by the analysis of hair strands. For example, it could be possible to identify whether a terrorist suspect had recently been to a particular location from hair analysis. This hair analysis is a non-invasive method which is becoming very popular in cases that DNA or other traditional means are bringing no answers.

Isotope analysis can be used by forensic investigators to determine whether two or more samples of explosives are of a common origin. Most high explosives contain carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen atoms and thus comparing their relative abundances of isotopes can reveal the existence of a common origin. Researchers have also shown that analysis of the 12C/13C ratios can locate the country of origin for a given explosive.

Stable isotopic analysis has also been used in the identification of drug trafficking routes. Isotopic abundances are different in morphine grown from poppies in south-east Asia versus poppies grown in south-west Asia. The same is applied to cocaine that is derived from Bolivia and that from Colombia.

=== Traceability ===
Stable isotopic analysis has also been used for tracing the geographical origin of food, timber, and in tracing the sources and fates of nitrates in the environment. 

=== Geology ===
=== Hydrology ===
In isotope hydrology, stable isotopes of water (2H and 18O) are used to estimate the source, age, and flow paths of water flowing through ecosystems. The main effects that change the stable isotope composition of water are evaporation and condensation. Variability in water isotopes is used to study sources of water to streams and rivers, evaporation rates, groundwater recharge, and other hydrological processes.

=== Paleoclimatology ===
The ratio of 18O to 16O in ice and deep sea cores is temperature dependent, and can be used as a proxy measure for reconstructing climate change. During colder periods of the Earth&#x27;s history (glacials) such as during the ice ages, 16O is preferentially evaporated from the colder oceans, leaving the slightly heavier and more sluggish 18O behind. Organisms such as foraminifera which combine oxygen dissolved in the surrounding water with carbon and calcium to build their shells therefore incorporate the temperature-dependent 18O to 16O ratio. When these organisms die, they settle out on the sea bed, preserving a long and invaluable record of global climate change through much of the Quaternary. Similarly, ice cores on land are enriched in the heavier 18O relative to 16O during warmer climatic phases (interglacials) as more energy is available for the evaporation of the heavier 18O isotope. The oxygen isotope record preserved in the ice cores is therefore a &quot;mirror&quot; of the record contained in ocean sediments.

Oxygen isotopes preserve a record of the effects of the Milankovitch cycles on climate change during the Quaternary, revealing an approximately 100,000-year cyclicity in the Earth&#x27;s climate.

<text>Terracotta, also known as terra cotta or terra-cotta (; ; ), is a clay-based non-vitreous ceramic fired at relatively low temperatures. It is therefore a term used for earthenware objects of certain types, as set out below.
Usage and definitions of the term vary, such as:
*In art, pottery, applied art, and craft, &quot;terracotta&quot; is a term often used for red-coloured earthenware sculptures or functional articles such as flower pots, water and waste water pipes, and tableware.
*In archaeology and art history, &quot;terracotta&quot; is often used to describe objects such as figurines and loom weights not made on a potter&#x27;s wheel, with vessels and other objects made on a wheel from the same material referred to as earthenware; the choice of term depends on the type of object rather than the material or shaping technique.
*Terracotta is also used to refer to the natural brownish-orange color of most terracotta.
*In architecture, the term encompasses many building materials made out an fired ceramic for exterior covering. Architectural terracotta can also refer to ornate decorative ceramic elements such as antefixes and revetments, which had a large impact on the appearance of temples and other buildings in the classical architecture of Europe, as well as in the Ancient Near East.

This article covers the sense of terracotta as a medium in sculpture, as in the Terracotta Army and Greek terracotta figurines, and architectural decoration. Neither pottery such as utilitatian earthenware nor East Asian and European sculpture in porcelain are covered.

==In art history==
===Asia and the Middle East===
Terracotta female figurines were uncovered by archaeologists in excavations of Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan (3000–1500 BCE). Along with phallus-shaped stones, these suggest some sort of fertility cult. The Burney Relief is an outstanding terracotta plaque from Ancient Mesopotamia of about 1950 BCE. In Mesoamerica, the great majority of Olmec figurines were in terracotta. Many ushabti mortuary statuettes were also made of terracotta in Ancient Egypt.
====India====

Terracotta has been a medium for art since the Harappan civilization, although techniques used differed in each time period. In the Mauryan times, they were mainly figures of mother goddesses, indicating a fertility cult. Moulds were used for the face, whereas the body was hand-modelled. In the Shungan times, a single mould was used to make the entire figure and depending upon the baking time, the colour differed from red to light orange. The Satavahanas used two different moulds- one for the front and the other for the back and kept a piece of clay in each mould and joined them together, making some artefacts hollow from within. Some Satavahana terracotta artefacts also seem to have a thin strip of clay joining the two moulds. This technique may have been imported from the Romans and is seen nowhere else in the country.

Contemporary centres for terracotta figurines include West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. In Bishnupur, West Bengal, the terracotta pattern–panels on the temples are known for their intricate details. The Bankura Horse is also very famous and belongs to the Bengal school of terracotta. Madhya Pradesh is one of the most prominent production centres of terracotta art today. The tribes of the Bastar have a rich tradition. They make intricate designs and statues of animals and birds. Hand-painted clay and terracotta products are produced in Gujarat. The Aiyanar cult in Tamil Nadu is associated with life-size terracotta statues.

Traditional terracotta sculptures, mainly religious, also continue to be made. The demand for this craft is seasonal, reaching its peak during the harvest festival, when new pottery and votive idols are required. During the rest of the year, the makers rely on agriculture or some other means of income. The designs are often redundant as crafters apply similar reliefs and techniques for different subjects. Customers suggest subjects and uses for each piece.

To sustain the legacy, the Indian Government has established the Sanskriti Museum of Indian Terracotta in New Delhi. The initiative encourages ongoing work in this medium through displays terracotta from different sub-continent regions and periods. In 2010, the India Post Service issued a stamp commemorating the craft which shows a terracotta doll from the craft museum.

====China====
Chinese sculpture made great use of terracotta, with and without glazing and color, from a very early date. The famous Terracotta Army of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, 209–210 BCE, was somewhat untypical, and two thousand years ago reliefs were more common, in tombs and elsewhere. Later Buddhist figures were often made in painted and glazed terracotta, with the Yixian glazed pottery luohans, probably of 1150–1250, now in various Western museums, among the most prominent examples. Brick-built tombs from the Han dynasty were often finished on the interior wall with bricks decorated on one face; the techniques included molded reliefs. Later tombs contained many figures of protective spirits and animals and servants for the afterlife, including the famous horses of the Tang dynasty; as an arbitrary matter of terminology these tend not to be referred to as terracottas.

===Africa===
Precolonial West African sculpture also made extensive use of terracotta. The regions most recognized for producing terracotta art in that part of the world include the Nok culture of central and north-central Nigeria, the Ife-Benin cultural axis in western and southern Nigeria (also noted for its exceptionally naturalistic sculpture), and the Igbo culture area of eastern Nigeria, which excelled in terracotta pottery. These related, but separate, traditions also gave birth to elaborate schools of bronze and brass sculpture in the area.

===Europe===
The Ancient Greeks&#x27; Tanagra figurines were mass-produced mold-cast and fired terracotta figurines, that seem to have been widely affordable in the Hellenistic period, and often purely decorative in function. They were part of a wide range of Greek terracotta figurines, which included larger and higher-quality works such as the Aphrodite Heyl; the Romans too made great numbers of small figurines, which were often used in a religious context as cult statues or temple decorations. Etruscan art often used terracotta in preference to stone even for larger statues, such as the near life-size Apollo of Veii and the &quot;Sarcophagus of the Spouses&quot;. Campana reliefs are Ancient Roman terracotta reliefs, originally mostly used to make friezes for the outside of buildings, as a cheaper substitute for stone.

European medieval art made little use of terracotta sculpture, until the late 14th century, when it became used in advanced International Gothic workshops in parts of Germany. The Virgin illustrated at the start of the article from Bohemia is the unique example known from there. A few decades later, there was a revival in the Italian Renaissance, inspired by excavated classical terracottas as well as the German examples, which gradually spread to the rest of Europe. In Florence, Luca della Robbia (1399/1400–1482) was a sculptor who founded a family dynasty specializing in glazed and painted terracotta, especially large roundels which were used to decorate the exterior of churches and other buildings. These used the same techniques as contemporary maiolica and other tin-glazed pottery. Other sculptors included Pietro Torrigiano (1472–1528), who produced statues, and in England busts of the Tudor royal family. The unglazed busts of the Roman Emperors adorning Hampton Court Palace, by Giovanni da Maiano, 1521, were another example of Italian work in England. They were originally painted but this has now been lost from weathering.

In the 18th-century unglazed terracotta, which had long been used for preliminary clay models or maquettes that were then fired, became fashionable as a material for small sculptures including portrait busts. It was much easier to work than carved materials, and allowed a more spontaneous approach by the artist. Claude Michel (1738–1814), known as Clodion, was an influential pioneer in France. John Michael Rysbrack (1694–1770), a Flemish portrait sculptor working in England, sold his terracotta &quot;modelli&quot; for larger works in stone, and produced busts only in terracotta. In the next century the French sculptor Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse made many terracotta pieces, but possibly the most famous is &quot;The Abduction of Hippodameia&quot; depicting the Greek mythological scene of a centaur kidnapping Hippodameia on her wedding day.

==Architecture==

===History===
Architectural terracotta is a broad term encompassing a wide ranging variety of clay-based architectural elements such as wall reliefs, decorative roof elements, and architectural sculpture. 

Many ancient and traditional roofing styles included more elaborate sculptural elements than the plain roof tiles, such as Chinese Imperial roof decoration and the antefix of western classical architecture. In India West Bengal made a speciality of terracotta temples, with the sculpted decoration from the same material as the main brick construction.

Architectural terracotta experienced a resurgence in western architecture starting in the mid-19th century. Starting in Europe, architects designed elaborate buildings relying on terracotta detailing for their facades. James Taylor was one of the first producers of architectural terracotta to find success in the United States, using his experience manufacturing the material in England to guide his work in North America.

The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 led to increased demand for fireproof materials in urban settings, and helped drive the following push for architectural terracotta throughout North America. The material remained popular through the early 1900s, with its versatility allowing it to support a variety of architectural styles such as Rennaissance revival, neo-Gothic, and Art deco.

Emerging trends in Modernist architecture favoring the use of concrete and glass significantly reduced demand for architectural terracotta starting in the 1930s. In the time since, the material has experienced a resurgence of interest, favored for work in postmodern and revivalist architectural styles.

===Differences from non-architectural terracotta===
Unlike art and pottery terracotta, clays used for architectural terracotta can range from dark-bodied stonewares to light-bodied whitewares, ranging depending on what is required for their particular application.

The clays are usually fired to or near vitrification in order to survive continued exposure to harsh outdoor conditions such as freeze-thaw cycles and salt intrusion. Contrary to popular belief, glazing does not seal terracotta from water penetration and a non-porous clay body is necessary to prevent failure from these issues.

==Production==
Prior to firing, terracotta clays are easy to shape. Shaping techniques include throwing, slip casting as well as others.

After drying, it is placed in a kiln or, more traditionally, in a pit covered with combustible material, then fired. The typical firing temperature is around , though it may be as low as in historic and archaeological examples. During this process, the iron oxides in the body reacts with oxygen, often resulting in the reddish colour known as terracotta. However, color can vary widely, including shades of yellow, orange, buff, red, pink, grey or brown.

A final method is to carve fired bricks or other terracotta shapes. This technique is less common, but examples can be found in the architecture of Bengal on Hindu temples and mosques. 
==Properties==

Terracotta is not watertight, but its porousness decreases when the body is surface-burnished before firing. Glazes can used to decrease permeability and hence increase watertightness.

Unglazed terracotta is suitable for use below ground to carry pressurized water (an archaic use), for garden pots and irrigation or building decoration in many environments, and for oil containers, oil lamps, or ovens. Most other uses require the material to be glazed, such as tableware, sanitary piping, or building decorations built for freezing environments.

Terracotta will also ring if lightly struck, as long as it is not cracked.

Painted (polychrome) terracotta is typically first covered with a thin coat of gesso, then painted. It is widely used, but only suitable for indoor positions and much less durable than fired colors in or under a ceramic glaze. Terracotta sculptures in the West were rarely left in their &quot;raw&quot; fired state until the 18th century.

===Advantages in sculpture===
As compared to bronze sculpture, terracotta uses a far simpler and quicker process for creating the finished work with much lower material costs. The easier task of modelling, typically with a limited range of knives and wooden shaping tools, but mainly using the fingers, allows the artist to take a more free and flexible approach. Small details that might be impractical to carve in stone, of hair or costume for example, can easily be accomplished in terracotta, and drapery can sometimes be made up of thin sheets of clay that make it much easier to achieve a realistic effect.

Reusable mold-making techniques may be used for production of many identical pieces. Compared to marble sculpture and other stonework, the finished product is far lighter and may be further painted and glazed to produce objects with color or durable simulations of metal patina. Robust durable works for outdoor use require greater thickness and so will be heavier, with more care needed in the drying of the unfinished piece to prevent cracking as the material shrinks. Structural considerations are similar to those required for stone sculpture; there is a limit on the stress that can be imposed on terracotta, and terracotta statues of unsupported standing figures are limited to well under life-size unless extra structural support is added. This is also because large figures are extremely difficult to fire, and surviving examples often show sagging or cracks. The Yixian figures were fired in several pieces, and have iron rods inside to hold the structure together.

<text>Traceability is the capability to trace something. In some cases, it is interpreted as the ability to verify the history, location, or application of an item by means of documented recorded identification.

Other common definitions include the capability (and implementation) of keeping track of a given set or type of information to a given degree, or the ability to chronologically interrelate uniquely identifiable entities in a way that is verifiable.

Traceability is applicable to measurement, supply chain, software development, healthcare and security.

==Measurement==
The term &quot;measurement traceability&quot; or &quot;metrological traceability&quot; is used to refer to an unbroken chain of comparisons relating an instrument&#x27;s measurements to a known standard. Calibration to a traceable standard can be used to determine an instrument&#x27;s bias, precision, and accuracy. It may also be used to show a chain of custody - from current interpretation of evidence to the actual evidence in a legal context, or history of handling of any information.

In many countries, national standards for weights and measures are maintained by a National Metrological Institute (NMI) which provides the highest level of standards for the calibration / measurement traceability infrastructure in that country. Examples of government agencies include the National Physical Laboratory, UK (NPL) the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the USA, the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Germany, the Instituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRiM) in Italy, and the National Research Council of Canada (NRC). As defined by NIST, &quot;Traceability of measurement requires the establishment of an unbroken chain of comparisons to stated references each with a stated uncertainty.&quot;

A clock providing is traceable to a time standard such as Coordinated Universal Time or International Atomic Time. The Global Positioning System is a source of traceable time.

==Supply chain==
Within a product&#x27;s supply chain, traceability may be both a regulatory and an ethical or environmental issue. Traceability is increasingly becoming a core criterion for sustainability efforts related to supply chains wherein knowing the producer, workers and other links stands as a necessary factor that underlies credible claims of social, economic, or environmental impacts. Environmentally friendly retailers may choose to make information regarding their supply chain freely available to customers, illustrating the fact that the products they sell are manufactured in factories with safe working conditions, by workers that earn a fair wage, using methods that do not damage the environment.

===Materials===
In regard to materials, traceability refers to the capability to associate a finished part with destructive test results performed on material from the same ingot with the same heat treatment, or to associate a finished part with results of a test performed on a sample from the same melt identified by the unique lot number of the material. Destructive tests typically include chemical composition and mechanical strength tests. A heat number is usually marked on the part or raw material which identifies the ingot it came from, and a lot number may identify the group of parts that experienced the same heat treatment (i.e., were in the same oven at the same time). Material traceability is important to the aerospace, nuclear, and process industry because they frequently make use of high strength materials that look identical to commercial low strength versions. In these industries, a part made of the wrong material is called &quot;counterfeit&quot;, even if the substitution was accidental.

This same practice extends throughout industries using military hardware, including the fastener industry.

===Logistics===

In logistics, traceability refers to the capability for tracing goods along the distribution chain on a batch number or series number basis. Traceability is an important aspect for example in the automotive industry, where it makes recalls possible, or in the food industry where it contributes to food safety.

The international standards organization EPCglobal under GS1 has ratified the EPCglobal Network standards (especially the EPC Information Services EPCIS standard) which codify the syntax and semantics for supply chain events and the secure method for selectively sharing supply chain events with trading partners. These standards for traceability have been used in successful deployments in many industries and there are now a wide range of products that are certified as being compatible with these standards.

===Food processing===
In food processing (meat processing, fresh produce processing), the term traceability refers to the recording through means of barcodes or RFID tags and other tracking media, all movement of product and steps within the production process. One of the key reasons this is such a critical point is in instances where an issue of contamination arises, and a recall is required. Where traceability has been closely adhered to, it is possible to identify, by precise date/time and exact location which goods must be recalled, and which are safe, potentially saving millions of dollars in the recall process. Traceability within the food processing industry is also utilised to identify key high production and quality areas of a business, versus those of low return, and where points in the production process may be improved.

In &quot;food processing software&quot;, traceability systems imply the use of a unique piece of data (e.g., order date/time or a serialized sequence number, generally through the use of a barcode / RFID) which can be traced through the entire production flow, linking all sections of the business, including suppliers and future sales through the supply chain. Messages and files at any point in the system can then be audited for correctness and completeness, using the traceability software to find the particular transaction and/or product within the supply chain.

In food systems, ISO 22005, as part of the ISO 22000 family of standards, has been developed to define the principles for food traceability and specifies the basic requirements for the design and implementation of a feed and food traceability system. It can be applied by an organization operating at any step in the feed and food chain.

The European Union&#x27;s General Food Law came into force in 2002, making traceability compulsory for food and feed operators and requiring those businesses to implement traceability systems. The EU introduced its Trade Control and Expert System, or TRACES, in April 2004. The system provides a central database to track movement of animals within the EU and from third countries.

Australia has its National Livestock Identification System to keep track of livestock from birth to slaughterhouse.

India has started taking initiatives for setting up traceability systems at Government and Corporate levels. Grapenet, an initiative by Agriculture and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), Ministry of Commerce, Government of India is an example in this direction. GrapeNet is an internet based traceability software system for monitoring fresh grapes exported from India to the European Union. GrapeNet is a first of its kind initiative in India that has put in place an end-to-end system for monitoring pesticide residue, achieve product standardization and facilitate tracing back from pallets to the farm of the Indian grower, through the various stages of sampling, testing, certification and packing. Grapenet won the National Award (Gold), in the winners announced for the best e-Governance initiatives undertaken in India in 2007.

The Directorate Generate Foreign Trade (DGFT), Government of India, through its notification dated 04.02.2009 relating to Amendment in Foreign Trade Policy (RE2008)has mandated that Export to the European Union is permitted subject to registration with APEDA, thereby making Grapenet mandatory for all exports of fresh grapes from India to Europe.

Uruguay has also designed a system called &quot;Traceability &amp; Electronic Information System of the Beef Industry&quot;.

===Forest products===
Within the context of supporting legal and sustainable forest supply chains, traceability has emerged in the last decade as a new tool to verify claims and assure buyers about the source of their materials. Mostly led out of Europe, and targeting countries where illegal logging has been a key problem (FLEGT countries), timber tracking is now part of daily business for many enterprises and jurisdictions. Full traceability offers advantages for multiple partners along the supply chain beyond certification systems, including:

* Mechanism to comply with local and international policies and regulations.
* Reducing the risk of illegal or non-compliant material entering the supply chains.
* Providing coordination between authorities and relevant bodies.
* Allowing automatic reconciliation of batches and volumes available.
* Offering a method of stock control and monitoring.
* Triggering real-time alerts of non-compliance.
* Reducing likelihood of recording errors.
* Improving effectiveness and efficiency.
* Increasing transparency.
* Promoting company integrity.

A number of timber tracking companies are in operation to service global demand.

Enhanced traceability ensures that the supply chain data is 100% accurate from the forest to the point of export. Nowadays, there are techniques to predict geographical provenance of wood and contribute to the fight against illegal logging.

==Systems and software development==
In systems and software development, the term traceability (or requirements traceability) refers to the ability to link product requirements back to stakeholders&#x27; rationales and forward to corresponding design artifacts, code, and test cases. Traceability supports numerous software engineering activities such as change impact analysis, compliance verification or traceback of code, regression test selection, and requirements validation. It is usually accomplished in the form of a matrix created for the verification and validation of the project. Unfortunately, the practice of constructing and maintaining a requirements trace matrix (RTM) can be very arduous and over time the traces tend to erode into an inaccurate state unless date/time stamped. Alternate automated approaches for generating traces using information retrieval methods have been developed.

In transaction processing software, traceability implies use of a unique piece of data (e.g., order date/time or a serialized sequence number) which can be traced through the entire software flow of all relevant application programs. Messages and files at any point in the system can then be audited for correctness and completeness, using the traceability key to find the particular transaction. This is also sometimes referred to as the transaction footprint.

== Health care ==
Patient safety during healthcare service plays an important role in preventing delayed recovery or even mortality, by increasing and improving the quality of life of citizens, and is considered an indicator of the quality status of health services Maintaining patient safety is a complex task and involves factors inherent to the environment and human actions. New technologies facilitate the traceability tools of patients and medications. This is particularly relevant for drugs that are considered high risk and cost.

Recent research in the healthcare industry emphasizes the significant impact of Blockchain Technology (BCT) on improving the performance of healthcare supply chain management. It highlights BCT&#x27;s role in enhancing transparency, data immutability, and efficient management, leading to better cooperation among stakeholders and effective risk mitigation in healthcare services.

The World Health Organization has recognized the importance of traceability for medical products of human origin (MPHO) and urged member states &quot;to encourage the implementation of globally consistent coding systems to facilitate national and international traceability&quot;.

==Security and crime-fighting==

To prevent theft, and assist in locating stolen objects, goods may be marked indelibly or undetectably so that they may be determined to be stolen, and in some cases identified. For example, it is sometimes arranged that stolen banknotes are marked with indelible dye to show that they are stolen; they can be identified by their unique serial numbers. Announcing that cash machines were fitted with sprayers of SmartWater, an invisible gel detectable for years, to mark thieves and their clothing when breaking into or tampering with the machine was found in a 2016 pilot scheme to reduce theft by 90%.

<doc id="174252" wikidata="Q731980" url="?curid=174252" title="Mezzotint">
<text>Mezzotint is a monochrome printmaking process of the intaglio family. It was the first printing process that yielded half-tones without using line- or dot-based techniques like hatching, cross-hatching or stipple. Mezzotint achieves tonality by roughening a metal plate with thousands of little dots made by a metal tool with small teeth, called a &quot;rocker&quot;. In printing, the tiny pits in the plate retain the ink when the face of the plate is wiped clean. This technique can achieve a high level of quality and richness in the print, and produce a furniture print which is large and bold enough to be framed and hung effectively in a room.

Mezzotint is often combined with other intaglio techniques, usually etching and engraving, including stipple engraving. The process was especially widely used in England from the eighteenth century, and in France was called &quot;la manière anglais&quot; (“the English manner”). Until the 20th century it has mostly been used for reproductive prints to reproduce portraits and other paintings, rather than for original compositions. From the mid-18th century it was somewhat in competition with the other main tonal technique of the day, aquatint. 

Since the mid-nineteenth century it has been relatively little used, as lithography and other techniques produced comparable results more easily. Sir Frank Short (1857–1945) was an important pioneer of the mezzotint revival in the United Kingdom along with Peter Ilsted (1864–1933) in Denmark.

Mezzotint is known for the luxurious quality of its tones: first, because an evenly, finely roughened surface holds a lot of ink, allowing deep solid colours to be printed; secondly because the process of smoothing the plate with burin, burnisher and scraper allows fine gradations in tone to be developed. The scraper is a triangular ended tool, and the burnisher has a smooth round end – not unlike many spoon handles.

==History==
The mezzotint printmaking method was invented by the German soldier and amateur artist Ludwig von Siegen (1609 – ). His earliest mezzotint print dates to 1642 and is a portrait of Countess Amalie Elisabeth of Hanau-Münzenberg, regent for her son, and von Siegen&#x27;s employer. This was made by working from light to dark. The rocker seems to have been invented by Prince Rupert of the Rhine, a famous cavalry commander in the English Civil War, who was the next to use the process, and took it to England. 

Sir Peter Lely saw the potential for using it to publicise his portraits, and encouraged a number of Dutch printmakers to come to England. Godfrey Kneller worked closely with John Smith, who is said to have lived in his house for a period; he created about 500 mezzotints, some 300 copies of portrait paintings. In the next century over 400 mezzotints after portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds are known, by various hands.

British mezzotint collecting was a great craze from about 1760 to the Great Crash of 1929, also spreading to America. The main area of collecting was British portraits; hit oil paintings from the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition were routinely, and profitably, reproduced in mezzotint throughout this period, and other mezzotinters reproduced older portraits of historical figures, or if necessary, made them up. The favourite period to collect was roughly from 1750 to 1820, the great period of the British portrait. There were two basic styles of collection: some concentrated on making a complete collection of material within a certain scope, while others aimed at perfect condition and quality (which declines in mezzotints after a relatively small number of impressions are taken from a plate), and in collecting the many &quot;proof states&quot; which artists and printers had obligingly provided for them from early on. Leading collectors included William Eaton, 2nd Baron Cheylesmore and the Irishman John Chaloner Smith.

In the first half of the 19th century the &quot;mixed&quot; technique was popular in England, with other intaglio techniques, often used to start a plate off, combined with mezzotint. Mezzotint was also often used for landscapes, being especially suited to rather gloomy British skies and twilights, that were popular subjects in the Victorian Etching Revival. 

Continental use of the technique was much less; in the late 17th century Abraham Bloteling was one of a number of Amsterdam printmakers to use it, but in the 18th century only Augsburg (Johann Jacob Haid and Johann Elias Ridinger), Nuremberg and Vienna (Ignaz Unterberger) had schools, led by artists following London styles.

During the 20th century the technique went into decline, in great part because it was so time consuming to rock the plates. Rare proponents include Yozo Hamaguchi, Leonard Marchant and Shirley Jones. Wider interest in learning and using the technique revived after the publication in 1990 of the book &quot;The Mezzotint: History and Technique&quot; by artist Carol Wax. The Wax book was responsible for a substantial upsurge in the number of artists creating mezzotints in the United States and worldwide.

==Light to dark method==
The first mezzotints by Ludwig von Siegen were made using the light to dark method. The metal plate was tooled to create indentations and parts of the image that were to stay light in tone were kept smooth. This method was referred to as the &#x27;Additive method&#x27;; that is, adding areas of indentations to the plate for the areas of the print that were to appear darker in tone. This technique meant that it was possible to create the image directly by only roughening a blank plate selectively, where the darker parts of the image are to be. By varying the degree of smoothing, mid-tones between black and white can be created, hence the name &quot;mezzo-tinto&quot; which is Italian for &quot;half-tone&quot; or &quot;half-painted&quot;.

==Dark to light method==
This became the most common method. The whole surface (usually) of a metal, usually copper, plate is roughened evenly, manually with a rocker, or mechanically. If the plate were printed at this point it would show as solid black. The image is then created by selectively burnishing areas of the surface of the metal plate with metal tools; the smoothed parts will print lighter than those areas not smoothed by the burnishing tool. Areas smoothed completely flat will not hold ink at all; such areas will print &quot;white,&quot; that is, the colour of the paper without ink. This is called working from &quot;dark to light&quot;, or the &quot;subtractive&quot; method. It was first used by Prince Rupert of the Rhine. The all-over roughening does not require huge skill, and was normally done by an apprentice.

Two great advantages of the technique were that it was easier to learn and also much faster than engraving proper, as well as giving a rich range of tones. Mezzotints could be produced very quickly to respond to or depict events or people in the news, and larger sizes of print were relatively easy to produce. This was crucial for what was known at the time as the furniture print, a mezzotint that was large enough and with sufficiently bold tonal contrasts to hold its own framed and hung on the wall of a room. Since mezzotints were far cheaper than paintings, this was a great attraction. 

===Colour===
Jacob Christoph Le Blon (1667-1741) used the dark to light method and invented the three and four-colour mezzotint printing technique by using a separate metal plate for each colour. Le Blon&#x27;s colour printing method applied the RYB colour model approach whereby red, yellow and blue were used to create a larger range of colour shades. In &quot;Coloritto&quot;, his book of 1725, Le Blon refers to red, yellow and blue as &quot;primitive&quot; colours and that red and yellow make orange; red and blue, make purple/violet; and blue and yellow make green (Le Blon, 1725, p. 6). A similar process was used in France later in the century by Le Blon&#x27;s pupil Jacques-Fabien Gautier-Dagoty and his sons; their work included anatomical illustrations for medical books. Other black and white prints were hand-coloured in watercolour, which was especially useful after the plate became worn.

==Printing==
Printing the finished plate is the same for either method, and follows the normal way for an intaglio plate; the whole surface is inked, the ink is then wiped off the surface to leave ink only in the pits of the still rough areas below the original surface of the plate. The plate is put through a high-pressure printing press next to a sheet of paper, and the process repeated.

Because the pits in the plate are not deep, only a small number of top-quality impressions (copies) can be printed before the quality of the tone starts to degrade as the pressure of the press begins to smooth them out. Perhaps only one or two hundred really good impressions can be taken, although plates were often &quot;refreshed&quot; by further rocker work. In 1832 a writer in &quot;Arnold&#x27;s Library&quot; noted:

...the uncertainty as to the number of impressions this kind of engraving will afford—some plates failing after fifty or even a less number are printed; from two to three hundred are the most that can be taken off, and then it is often necessary to refresh the ground and restore the lights during the progress of the printing.&quot;

However, if performed by the printer or the artist&#x27;s apprentice, refreshing the plate was often done to a lower standard. Bamber Gascoigne said of an example he illustrated with before and after details &quot;the dark tones have been clumsily renewed with the roulette; the result is brutal in close-up but will seem adequate when the whole print is viewed at a normal distance&quot;.

Standard sizes used in England were known× as &quot;royal&quot;, 24 × 19 in., &quot;large&quot;, 18 × 24 in., &quot;posture&quot;, 14 × 10 in., and &quot;small&quot;, 6 × 4 in, and ready-made frames and albums could be bought to fit these.

==Detailed technique==
Plates can be mechanically roughened; one way is to rub fine metal filings over the surface with a piece of glass; the finer the filings, the smaller the grain of the surface. Special roughening tools called &#x27;rockers&#x27; have been in use since at least the eighteenth century. The method commonly in use today is to use a steel rocker approximately five inches wide, which has between 45 and 120 teeth per inch on the face of a blade in the shape of a shallow arc, with a wooden handle projecting upwards in a T-shape. Rocked steadily from side to side at the correct angle, the rocker will proceed forward creating burrs in the surface of the copper. The plate is then moved – either rotated by a set number of degrees or through 90 degrees according to preference – and then rocked in another pass. This is repeated until the plate is roughened evenly and will print a completely solid tone of black.

<doc id="174254" wikidata="Q752633" url="?curid=174254" title="Linocut">
<text>Linocut, also known as lino print, lino printing or linoleum art, is a printmaking technique, a variant of woodcut in which a sheet of linoleum (sometimes mounted on a wooden block) is used for a relief surface. A design is cut into the linoleum surface with a sharp knife, V-shaped chisel or gouge, with the raised (uncarved) areas representing a reversal (mirror image) of the parts to show printed. The linoleum sheet is inked with a roller (called a brayer), and then impressed onto paper or fabric. The actual printing can be done by hand or with a printing press.

==Technique==
Since the material being carved has no directional grain and does not tend to split, it is easier to obtain certain artistic effects with lino than with most woods, although the resultant prints lack the often angular grainy character of woodcuts and engravings. Lino is generally much easier to cut than wood, especially when heated, but the pressure of the printing process degrades the plate faster and it is difficult to create larger works due to the material&#x27;s fragility.

Linocuts can also be achieved by the careful application of art on the surface of the lino. This creates a surface similar to a soft ground etching and these caustic-lino plates can be printed in either a relief, intaglio or a viscosity printing manner.

Colour linocuts can be made by using a different block for each colour as in a woodcut, as the artists of the Grosvenor School frequently did. As Pablo Picasso demonstrated, such prints can also be achieved using a single piece of linoleum in what is called the &quot;reductive&quot; print method. Essentially, after each successive colour is imprinted onto the paper, the artist then cleans the lino plate and cuts away what will not be imprinted for the subsequently applied colour.

Due to ease of use, linocut is widely used in schools to introduce children to the art of printmaking, using it to complete many tasks in the art lesson rather than going straight for the pencil and eraser. Similarly, non-professional artists often cut lino rather than wood for printing. Nevertheless, in the contemporary art world the linocut is an established professional print medium, because of its extensive use by the artists of the Grosvenor School, followed by Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse.

== Emergence of the technique in America ==
&quot;Linoleum art&quot; was first displayed in New York City in 1911 by the Czech émigré Vojtěch Preissig. In his publications on linocuts (1926–29) the respected American printmaker, Pedro Joseph de Lemos, simplified the methods for art schools and introduced new techniques for color linocuts, including the printing of the key block first. The first large-scale colour linocuts made by an American artist were created by Walter Inglis Anderson, and exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum in 1949.

<doc id="174255" wikidata="Q3674992" url="?curid=174255" title="Chine-collé">
<text>Chine-collé or chine collé () is a printmaking technique in which the image is transferred onto a surface that is bonded onto a heavier support in the printing process. One purpose is to allow the printmaker to print on a much more delicate surface, such as Japanese paper or linen, that pulls finer details off the plate. Another purpose is to provide a background colour behind the image that is different from the surrounding backing sheet.

The final image will depend on the design and ink color of the printed image, the color and opacity of the paper to which the image is directly printed (plus any inclusions such as petals or fibers in that paper), and the color of the backing sheet.

==Etymology and history==
&quot;Chine-collé&quot; roughly translates from French &quot;chine&quot; = China, and &quot;collé&quot;, meaning glued or pasted. The word &quot;chine&quot; is used because the thin paper traditionally used in the process was imported to Europe from China, India and/or Japan.

&quot;Chine-collé&quot; is sometimes mistakenly used to refer to any type of collage.

==Methods==
In the typical &quot;direct print&quot; method, the plate is inked; thin paper (such as rice paper) is dampened, placed on the inked plate and trimmed to size; paste is applied to the thin paper; and the ensemble (plate plus thin paper with paste) is placed on a dampened backing sheet. This is then run through a printing press. In the pressure of the press, the ink is transferred to the thin paper, and the thin paper is simultaneously adhered to the backing paper. An advantage of this method is that the thin paper will be exactly the desired size, since it is trimmed to size and then quickly affixed in place.

Another way of printing the direct method is to have the thin paper already cut to size before preparing the plate to print. The heavier print paper has been put in the bath and dampened according to the printmaker&#x27;s preference, then set aside. If the thin paper was painted on, it has been dried and is also set aside, ready. The plate is inked and wiped then placed on the press face up. Thin paste is brushed on the back of the rice paper and it is placed face down on the plate and registered. The paste is put on just enough to coat but not saturate, which dampens the thin paper appropriately. If one tries to brush paste on a damp piece of rice paper, it will tear. The print paper is then placed on top of the pasted side of the thin paper, a sheet of newsprint added on top of the stack, and the felts then covering the stack. It is then run through the press. This process is less tricky to maneuver than the first method, is cleaner, and more accurate in registration.

In the typical &quot;pre-pasted&quot; method, the thin paper (dry) is trimmed to the size of the plate, then paste is applied and allowed to dry. When the printmaker is ready to print, the paper is dampened to activate the paste and placed, paste-side up, on an inked plate. Then, the ensemble (plate plus thin paper with paste) is placed on a dampened backing sheet and run through a press as described above. An advantage of the pre-pasted method is that once dried, the paste-applied papers can be stored indefinitely, just like a lick-and-stick postage stamp. A disadvantage of this method is that because the paper is trimmed dry, the artist must take into account how much in each direction the paper will expand when it is dampened prior to printing.

==Paper==

Some artists have moved away from precise trimming of a single sheet of paper to the size of the printing plate when using this method. For example, some experiment with pre-cut shapes for a collage effect, or simultaneously adhere multiple overlapping pieces of paper under the printed image.

A more traditional paper choice would be a fine paper made from gampi fiber. Some artists experiment with non-traditional papers, using such things as newspaper, ephemera, dress patterns, and book pages as the sheet to be printed on.

==Glue==
There is some variation in adhesives used for &quot;chine collé&quot;. Some artists are reported to use a dusting of flour right before pressing rather than paste. Some have tried using no adhesive at all, simply relying on the high pressure of the printing press and properties of the paper (fibers, sizing) to fuse the papers together similar to paper-making; however, this method may be variable and unreliable. More recently, some artists have turned to adhesives such as PVA glue or gel medium, rather than paste.

In traditional paste-making for &quot;Chine-collé&quot;, wheat or rice starch is separated from gluten and other elements of wheat or rice flour. Pure starch is then cooked with distilled water to form a congealed gel. Finally the gel is passed through a fine sieve such as a piece of silk to form the paste. Starch-based pastes are considered archival, and are sometimes used in other paper-based applications, such as book binding, book repair and collage.

<doc id="174256" wikidata="Q156218" url="?curid=174256" title="Monotyping">
<text>Monotyping is a type of printmaking made by drawing or painting on a smooth, non-absorbent surface. The surface, or matrix, was historically a copper etching plate, but in contemporary work it can vary from zinc or glass to acrylic glass. The image is then transferred onto a paper by pressing the two together, using a printing-press, brayer, baren or by techniques such as rubbing with the back of a wooden spoon or the fingers which allow pressure to be controlled selectively. Monotypes can also be created by inking an entire surface and then, using brushes or rags, removing ink to create a subtractive image, e.g. creating lights from a field of opaque colour. The inks used may be oil or water-based. With oil-based inks, the paper may be dry, in which case the image has more contrast, or the paper may be damp, in which case the image has a 10 percent greater range of tones.

Monotyping produces a unique print, or monotype; most of the ink is removed during the initial pressing. Although subsequent reprintings are sometimes possible, they differ greatly from the first print and are generally considered inferior.
These prints from the original plate are called &quot;ghost prints.&quot; A print made by pressing a new print onto another surface, effectively making the print into a plate, is called a &quot;cognate&quot;. Stencils, watercolor, solvents, brushes, and other tools are often used to embellish a monotype print. Monotypes can be spontaneously executed and with no previous sketch.

==History==

There is still no certainty as to who was the inventor of the monotype process. The Italian artist Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione (1609–64) is often credited as being the first artist to produce monotypes. He made brushed sketches intended as finished and final works of art. He began to make monotypes in the mid 1640s, normally working from black to white, and produced over twenty surviving ones, over half of which are set at night. It is believed that the Flemish artist Antoon Sallaert created his first monotypes in the early 1640s and is therefore to be regarded as the inventor of this printing process. Both artists used the new technique in different ways. Castiglione created most of his monotypes as black-field images by wiping away ink on a prepared plate thus producing white and grey lines. Sallaert, on the other hand, brushed bold, tapering lines onto the printing surface with meticulous precision. It is likely that Sallaert&#x27;s monotype style was influenced by the chiaroscuro woodcuts of the Dutch engraver Hendrik Goltzius. Sallaert found in the monotype a technique which was the closest to drawing and oil sketching. His monotypes and drawings are characterised by swelling lines and tapering ends. He often added by hand white highlights to his monotypes. Sallaert clearly appreciated in the monotype technique the freedom to design on a plate before printing it on paper.
William Blake developed a different technique, painting on millboard in egg tempera to produce both new works and coloured impressions of his prints and book illustrations, including his &quot;Pity&quot;. Each impression was usually then worked over by hand, using ink and watercolour. Few other artists used the technique until Degas, who made several, often working on them further after printing (Beside the Sea, 1876-7); Pissarro also made several. Paul Gauguin used a variant technique involving tracing, later taken up by Paul Klee. In the twentieth century the technique became more popular; examples include the extraordinary colorful monotypes created by Marc Chagall in the 1960s. Twenty-first century examples include works by Nicole Eisenman, Christopher Wool, Karen LaMonte, and Roman Turovsky.

==Comparing monotypes to monoprints==
Historically, the terms &quot;monotype&quot; and &quot;monoprint&quot; were often used interchangeably. More recently, however, they have come to refer to two different, though similar, types of printmaking. Both involve the transfer of ink from a plate to the paper, canvas, or other surface that will ultimately hold the work of art. In the case of monotypes, the plate is a featureless plate. It contains no features that will impart any definition to successive prints. The most common feature would be the etched or engraved line on a metal plate. In the absence of any permanent features on the surface of the plate, all articulation of imagery is dependent on one unique inking, resulting in one unique print. Additionally, the term monotype is often used for an image made by inking a non-absorbent surface with a solid colour, laying over it a piece of paper and drawing onto the back of the paper. When the paper is pulled off the resulting print consists of the line surrounded by ink picked up from the inked plate. The result has a chance element, often random and irregular which gives the print a certain charm, a technique famously used by British artist Tracey Emin, a graduate of the Royal College of Art, where the practice of monoprinting in general was regarded as &quot;fake painting&quot;.

Monoprints, on the other hand, now refers to the results of plates that have permanent features on them. Monoprints can be thought of as variations on a theme, with the theme resulting from some permanent features being found on the plate—lines, textures—that persist from print to print. Variations are confined to those resulting from how the plate is inked prior to each print. The variations are endless, but certain permanent features on the plate will tend to persist from one print to the next.

<text>Drypoint is a printmaking technique of the intaglio family, in which an image is incised into a plate (or &quot;matrix&quot;) with a hard-pointed &quot;needle&quot; of sharp metal or diamond point. In principle, the method is practically identical to engraving. The difference is in the use of tools, and that the raised ridge along the furrow is not scraped or filed away as in engraving. Traditionally the plate was copper, but now acetate, zinc, or plexiglas are also commonly used. Like etching, drypoint is easier to master than engraving for an artist trained in drawing because the technique of using the needle is closer to using a pencil than the engraver&#x27;s burin.

The term is also used for inkless scratched inscriptions, such as glosses in manuscripts.

==Lines and burrs==

The lines produced by printing a drypoint are formed by the burr thrown up at the edge of the incised lines, in addition to the depressions formed in the surface of the plate. A larger burr, formed by a steep angle of the tool, will hold a lot of ink, producing a characteristically soft, dense line that differentiates drypoint from other intaglio methods such as etching or engraving which produce a smooth, hard-edged line. The size or characteristics of the burr usually depend not on how much pressure is applied, but on the angle of the needle. A perpendicular angle will leave little to no burr, while the smaller the angle gets to either side, the larger the burr pileup. The deepest drypoint lines leave enough burr on either side of them that they prevent the paper from pushing down into the center of the stroke, creating a feathery black line with a fine, white center. A lighter line may have no burr at all, creating a very fine line in the final print by holding very little ink. This technique is different from engraving, in which the incisions are made by removing metal to form depressions in the plate surface which hold ink, although the two methods can easily be combined, as Rembrandt often did. Because the recurring pressure of printing soon destroys the burr, drypoint is useful only for comparatively small editions; as few as ten or twenty impressions with burr can be made, and after the burr has gone, the comparatively shallow lines will wear out relatively quickly. Most impressions of Rembrandt prints on which drypoint was used show no burr, and often the drypoint lines are very weak, leaving the etched portions still strong. To counter this and allow for longer print runs, electroplating (called steelfacing by printmakers) can harden the surface of a plate and allow the same edition size as produced by etchings and engravings.

==History==

The technique appears to have been invented by the Housebook Master, a south German 15th-century artist, all of whose prints are in drypoint only. Among the most famous artists of the old master print, Albrecht Dürer produced 3 drypoints before abandoning the technique; Rembrandt used it frequently, but usually in conjunction with etching and engraving. As intaglio techniques, they can all be used on the same plate. Alex Katz used this process to create several of his famous works, such as &quot;Sunny&quot; and &quot;The Swimmer&quot;.

In the 20th century many artists produced drypoints, including Max Beckmann, Milton Avery, Hermann-Paul and Martin Lewis. By adding aquatint work on the plate and inking with various colours, artists such as Mary Cassatt have produced colour drypoints. Canadian artist David Brown Milne is credited as the first to produce coloured drypoints by the use of multiple plates, one for each colour. On the West Coast of the United States the respected printmaker Pedro Joseph de Lemos simplified the methods for producing drypoints in art schools.

Contemporary artists who have extensively used drypoint include Louise Bourgeois, Vija Celmins, William Kentridge and Richard Spare.

==Types of needles==
Any sharp object can theoretically be used to make a drypoint, as long as it can be used to carve lines into metal. Dentistry tools, nails, and metal files can all be used to produce drypoints. However, certain types of needles are created specifically for drypoints:
*Diamond-tipped needles carve easily through any metal and never need sharpening, but they are expensive.
*Carbide-tipped steel needles can also be used to great effect, and are cheaper than diamond-tipped needles, but they need frequent sharpening to maintain a sharp point. Steel needles were traditionally used.

==Printing processes==

Printing is essentially the same as for the other intaglio techniques, but extra care is taken to preserve the burr. After the image is finished, or at least ready to proof, the artist applies ink to the plate with a dauber. Too much pressure will flatten the burrs and ruin the image. Once the plate is completely covered with a thin layer, a small scraper or card is gently used to remove excess ink. Then, a tarlatan cloth tightly wrapped in a spherical shape will be used to wipe away excess ink, by slowly yet firmly rubbing the smooth side of the sphere on the plate in small circular motions. Paper (typically pages from old phone books) may be used for a final wipe of the lightest areas of the image. Some printmakers will use their bare hand instead to wipe these areas. Once the desired amount of ink is removed, the plate is run through an etching press along with a piece of dampened paper to produce a print.

A dampened paper may be produced by soaking a piece of printing paper, or any other papers that are slightly water-absorbent but are not water soluble, into a tray of water for about 5 minutes. Afterwards, the paper is laid onto a towel and dabbed dry. The moist paper allows ink to be drawn out from the burred lines of the plate when it is pressed into it.

===Hand-wiping techniques===
Drypoint wiping techniques vary slightly from other intaglio techniques. Less pressure is applied to achieve desirable lines, because the burrs forming the image are more fragile than etched or engraved lines, but also because the ink rests on the plate surface, instead of pressed down into indentations. Also, because of the characteristics of the way the burrs catch ink, the direction of the wiping matters. Ink tends to pile up in the lee of the burr during the application of the ink and wiping with the tarlatan, so if the printer wipes in the direction of the lines with their hand, they may remove most of the ink, leaving a light gray line. However, if they wipe perpendicularly to the line, they can actually increase the pile of ink on the other side of the line, darkening the printed line.

<text>Prescott Sheldon Bush Sr. (May 15, 1895 – October 8, 1972) was an American banker and Republican Party politician. as a Wall Street executive investment banker, he represented Connecticut in the from 1952 of the Bush family, he was the father of President , and the paternal grandfather of President and former Florida Governor 

Born in Columbus, Ohio, Bush graduated from Yale College and served as an artillery officer during World War I. After the war, he worked for several companies, becoming a minor partner of the Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co. investment bank in 1931. He served in several high-ranking United States Golf Association offices, including president of that organization. Bush settled in Connecticut in 1925.

Bush won election to the Senate in a 1952 special election, narrowly defeating Democratic nominee Abraham Ribicoff. In the Senate, Bush staunchly supported President Dwight D. Eisenhower and helped enact legislation to create the Interstate Highway System. Bush won re-election in 1956 but declined to seek re-election in 1962, retiring from the Senate the following year.

==Early life==
Prescott Bush was born in Columbus, Ohio on May 15, 1895 to Samuel Prescott Bush and Flora Sheldon Bush. Samuel Bush was a railroad middle manager, then a steel company president and, during World War I, a federal government official in charge of coordination of and assistance to major weapons contractors.

Bush attended St. George&#x27;s School in Middletown, Rhode Island, from 1908 to 1913. In 1913, he enrolled at Yale College, where his paternal grandfather, Rev. James Smith Bush (class of 1844), and his maternal uncle Robert E. Sheldon Jr. (class of 1904) had matriculated. Three subsequent generations of the Bush family have been Yale alumni.

Prescott Bush was admitted to the Zeta Psi fraternity and Skull and Bones secret society. George H. W. Bush was also a member of the society, as is his son, George W. Bush. George H. W. Bush and George Bush were, however, not members of Zeta Psi, and were members, instead, of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. According to Skull and Bones lore, Prescott Bush was among a group of Bonesmen who dug up and removed the skull of Geronimo from his grave at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, in 1918. According to historian David L. Miller, the Bonesmen probably dug up somebody at Fort Sill, but not Geronimo.

Prescott Bush was a cheerleader, played varsity golf and baseball, sang in the Whiffenpoofs, and was president of the Yale Glee Club.

After graduation, Bush served as a field artillery captain with the American Expeditionary Forces (1917–1919) during World War I. He received intelligence training at Verdun, France and was briefly assigned to a staff of French officers. Alternating between intelligence and artillery, he came under fire in the Meuse–Argonne offensive.

==Business career==
After his discharge in 1919, Prescott Bush went to work for the Simmons Hardware Company in St. Louis, Missouri.

The Bush family moved to Columbus, Ohio, in 1923, where Prescott briefly worked for the Hupp Products Company. In November 1923, he became president of sales for Stedman Products in South Braintree, Massachusetts. During this time, he lived in a Victorian house at 173 Adams Street in Milton, Massachusetts, where his son, George H. W. Bush, was born.

In 1924, Bush became vice-president of the investment bank A. Harriman &amp; Co. where his father-in-law, George Herbert Walker was president. Bush&#x27;s Yale classmates and fellow Bonesmen E. Roland Harriman and Knight Woolley also worked with the company.

In 1925, he joined the United States Rubber Company of New York City as manager of the foreign division, and moved to Greenwich, Connecticut.

In 1931, he became a partner of Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co., which was created through the 1931 amalgamation of A. Harriman &amp; Co with Brown Bros. &amp; Co., (a merchant bank founded in Philadelphia in 1818) and with Harriman Brothers &amp; Co. (established in New York City in 1927).

He was an avid golfer, and in 1935 was named head of the USGA.

From 1944 to 1956, Prescott Bush was a member of the Yale Corporation, the principal governing body of Yale University. He was on the board of directors of CBS, having been introduced to chairman William S. Paley around 1932 by his close friend and colleague W. Averell Harriman, who became a major Democratic Party power broker.

==Business Plot and Union Banking Corporation ==
In July 2007, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; published an article by Scott Horton, an American attorney known for his work in human rights law and the law of armed conflict, claiming that Prescott Bush was involved in the 1934 Business Plot, a failed plan by some of America&#x27;s wealthy to trick Retired Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler into helping them overthrow President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Bush was a founder and one of seven directors (including W. Averell Harriman) of the Union Banking Corporation (holding a single share out of 4,000 as a director), an investment bank that operated as a clearing house for many assets and enterprises held by German steel magnate Fritz Thyssen, an early supporter of Adolf Hitler and financier of the Nazi Party. In July 1942, the bank was suspected of holding gold on behalf of Nazi leaders. A subsequent government investigation disproved those allegations but confirmed the Thyssens&#x27; control, and in October 1942 the United States seized the bank under the Trading with the Enemy Act and held the assets for the duration of World War II.

Journalist Duncan Campbell pointed out documents showing that Prescott Bush was a director and shareholder of a number of companies involved with Thyssen. Bush was the director of the Union Banking Corporation that &quot;represented Thyssen&#x27;s US interests&quot;, continuing to work for the bank after America&#x27;s entry into the war.

==Political life==
Prescott Bush was politically active on social issues. He was involved with the American Birth Control League as early as 1942, and served as the treasurer of the first nationwide campaign of Planned Parenthood in 1947. He was also an early supporter of the United Negro College Fund, serving as chairman of the Connecticut branch in 1951.

From 1947 to 1950, he served as Connecticut Republican finance chairman, and was the Republican candidate for the United States Senate in 1950. A columnist in Boston said that Bush &quot;is coming on to be known as President Truman&#x27;s Harry Hopkins. Nobody knows Mr. Bush and he hasn&#x27;t a Chinaman&#x27;s chance.&quot; (Harry Hopkins had been one of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s closest advisors.) Bush&#x27;s ties with Planned Parenthood also hurt him in strongly-Catholic Connecticut, and were the basis of a last-minute campaign in churches by Bush&#x27;s opponents; the family vigorously denied the connection, but Bush lost to Sen. William Burnett Benton by only 1,000 votes.

Prescott Bush sought a rematch with Sen. Benton in 1952, but withdrew as the party turned to William Purtell. The death of Senator Brien McMahon later that year, however, created a vacancy and this time the Republicans He defeated the Democratic nominee, Abraham Ribicoff, and was elected to the Senate. A staunch supporter of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, he served until January 1963. He was re-elected in 1956 with 55% of the vote over Democrat Thomas J. Dodd (later U.S. Senator from Connecticut and father of Christopher J. Dodd), and decided not to run for another term in 1962. He was a key ally for the passage of Eisenhower&#x27;s Interstate Highway System, and during his tenure supported the Polaris submarine project (built by Electric Boat Corporation in Groton, Connecticut), the establishment of the Peace Corps, and voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960 and the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

On December 2, 1954, Prescott Bush was part of the large (67–22) majority to censure Wisconsin Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy after McCarthy had taken on the U.S. Army and the Eisenhower administration. During the debate leading to the censure, Bush said that McCarthy has &quot;caused dangerous divisions among the American people because of his attitude and the attitude he has encouraged among his followers: that there can be no honest differences of opinion with him. Either you must follow Senator McCarthy blindly, not daring to express any doubts or disagreements about any of his actions, or, in his eyes, you must be a Communist, a Communist sympathizer, or a fool who has been duped by the Communist line.&quot; Eisenhower later included Prescott Bush on an undated handwritten list of prospective candidates he favored for the 1960 Republican presidential nomination.

In terms of issues, Bush often agreed with New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller. According to Theodore H. White&#x27;s book about the 1964 presidential election, Bush and Rockefeller were longtime friends. Bush favored a Nixon-Rockefeller ticket for 1960, and was presumed to support Rockefeller&#x27;s 1964 presidential candidacy until the latter&#x27;s remarriage in 1963. He then publicly denounced Rockefeller for divorcing his first wife and marrying a woman with whom Rockefeller had been having an affair while married to his first wife. Bush then very publicly endorsed his former Senate colleague Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., who was also the older brother of one of Bush&#x27;s protegés, former Connecticut Governor John Davis Lodge.

Another of Senator Bush&#x27;s major legislative interests was flood and hurricane protection. He drafted the Bush Hurricane Survey Act (Public Law 71), enabling U.S. Army engineers to develop a new program of community protection against tidal flooding. Bush and Representative John W. McCormack, the Democratic House Majority Leader, co-sponsored the Bush-McCormack Act (Public Law 685), which expedited the construction of local flood protection works.

==Personal life==
Prescott Bush married Dorothy Wear Walker (1901–1992) on August 6, 1921, in Kennebunkport, Maine. Dorothy Walker Bush was a founding member of the Junior League of Columbus, Ohio in 1923. They had five children: George Nancy Jonathan and William &quot;Bucky&quot; 

Bush founded the Yale Glee Club Associates, an alumni group, in 1937. As was his father-in-law, he was a member of the United States Golf Association, serving successively as secretary, vice-president and president, 1928–1935. He was a multi-year club champion of the Round Hill Club in Greenwich, Connecticut, and was on the committee set up by New York City Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. to help create the New York Mets.

He was a member of the American Legion and the 40 &amp; 8 Society.

Bush maintained homes in New York City, Long Island, Greenwich, the Walker&#x27;s Point Estate, and Fishers Island, a secluded island off the Connecticut coast.

He died of cancer in 1972 at age 77 at Memorial Hospital in and is interred at Putnam Cemetery in Greenwich, Connecticut.

<text>Aquatint is an intaglio printmaking technique, a variant of etching that produces areas of tone rather than lines. For this reason it has mostly been used in conjunction with etching, to give both lines and shaded tone. It has also been used historically to print in colour, both by printing with multiple plates in different colours, and by making monochrome prints that were then hand-coloured with watercolour.
It has been in regular use since the later 18th century, and was most widely used between about 1770 and 1830, when it was used both for artistic prints and decorative ones. After about 1830 it lost ground to lithography and other techniques. There have been periodic revivals among artists since then. An aquatint plate wears out relatively quickly, and is less easily reworked than other intaglio plates. Many of Goya&#x27;s plates were reprinted too often posthumously, giving very poor impressions.

Among the most famous prints using the aquatint technique are the major series by Goya, many of &quot;The Birds of America&quot; by John James Audubon (with the colour added by hand), and prints by Mary Cassatt printed in colour using several plates.

==Technique==

In intaglio printmaking techniques such as engraving and etching, the artist makes marks into the surface of the plate (in the case of aquatint, a copper or zinc plate) that are capable of holding ink. The plate is inked all over then wiped clean to leave ink only in the marks. The plate is passed through a printing press together with a sheet of paper, and strong pressure applied pushing the paper into the marks, so that a transfer of the ink to the paper occurs. This is repeated many times.
Like etching, aquatint uses the application of a mordant (acid) to etch into the metal plate. Where etching uses a needle to scratch through an acid-proof resist and make lines, aquatint uses powdered rosin (resin) to create a tonal effect. The rosin is acid resistant and typically adhered to the plate by controlled heating; where the grains are will print white, with black areas around. The tonal variation is controlled by the level of mordant exposure over large areas, and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time. The rosin is then washed off the plate before printing.

Another tonal technique, mezzotint, begins with a plate surface that is evenly indented and roughened so that it will print as an even and fairly dark tone of ink. The mezzotint plate is then smoothed and polished to make areas carry less ink and thus print a lighter shade. Alternatively, beginning with a smooth plate, areas are roughened to make them darker. Occasionally the two techniques of aquatint and mezzotint are combined.

== History ==
===Early history===

A variety of early experiments aimed to add tonal effects to etching included the first use of a resin dust ground by the painter and printmaker Jan van de Velde IV in Amsterdam, around 1650. However, none of these developed a technique that caught on with other printmakers. Experimentation by several artists with somewhat different techniques reached a peak after about 1750, and as they were initially very secretive, the history of the emergence of the standard technique remains unclear.

Various claimants include the Swede Per Floding working with the Frenchman François-Philippe Charpentier in 1761, J. B. Delafosse in 1766, working with the amateur Jean-Claude Richard (often rather misleadingly known as the Abbé de Saint-Non) in 1766, and Jean-Baptiste Le Prince in 1768–69. Le Prince was more effective than the others in publicizing his technique, publishing &quot;Découverte du procédé de graver au lavis&quot; in 1780, though he failed to sell his secret in his lifetime. It was bought posthumously by the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture in 1782, who released it on an open basis.

Though England was to become one of the countries using the technique most, the earliest English aquatints were not exhibited until 1772, by the cartographer Peter Perez Burdett. It was taken up by the watercolourist Paul Sandby, who also seems to have introduced technical refinements as well as inventing the name &quot;aquatint&quot;. In England artists such as Sandby and Thomas Gainsborough were attracted by the suitability of etched outlines with aquatint for reproducing the popular English landscape watercolours, which at this period usually also had been given an initial outline drawing in ink. Publishers of prints and illustrations for expensive books, both important British markets at the time, also adopted the technique. In all these areas, a print with etching and aquatint gave very satisfactory results when watercolour was added by relatively low-skilled painters copying a model, with a flat wash of colour on top of the varied tones of the aquatint. After the French Revolution, one of the most successful publishers in London, the German Rudolf Ackermann, had numbers of French refugees working on the floor above his shop in The Strand in London, each brushing a single colour and then passing the sheet down a long table.

Over the same period in France there was sustained interest in techniques for true colour printing using multiple plates, which used multiple printmaking techniques which often included aquatint (or mezzotint) for tone. Artists included Jean-François Janinet and Philibert-Louis Debucourt, whose &quot;La Promenade Publique&quot; is often thought the masterpiece of the style. Another branch of this French movement mostly used mezzotint for tone and came to specialize in illustrating medical textbooks. This was at first led by Jacob Christoph Le Blon (1667–1741), who very nearly anticipated modern CMYK colour separation and then carried on by his pupil Jacques Fabien Gautier d&#x27;Agoty and later members of the d&#x27;Agoty family until around 1800.

Goya, maker of incontestably the greatest prints using aquatint, probably learned of the technique through Giovanni David from Genoa, the first significant Italian to use it. Goya used it, normally with etching and often burnishing and other techniques, in his great print series &quot;Los Caprichos&quot; (1799), &quot;Los Desastres de la Guerra&quot; (1810–1819), &quot;La Tauromaquia&quot; (1816) and &quot;Los disparates&quot; (c. 1816–1823).

===Revival===

After a period of several decades in the central 19th century when the technique was little used, and definitively superseded for commercial uses, it was revived near the end of the century in France, by Édouard Manet, Félicien Rops, Degas, Pissarro, Jacques Villon and other artists. In 1891, Mary Cassatt, based in Paris, exhibited a series of highly original coloured drypoint and aquatint prints, including &quot;Woman Bathing&quot; and &quot;The Coiffure&quot;, inspired by an exhibition of Japanese woodblock prints shown there the year before. These used multiple blocks for the different colours. Cassatt was attracted to the simplicity and clarity of Japanese design, and the skillful use of blocks of colour. In her interpretation, she used primarily light, delicate pastel colours and avoided black (a &quot;forbidden&quot; colour among the Impressionists).

It continued to be used in the 20th century, with the Czech T. F. Šimon and the German Johnny Friedlaender notably frequent users. In the United States the printmaker Pedro Joseph de Lemos popularized aquatints in art schools with his publications (1919–1940), which simplified the cumbersome techniques, and with traveling exhibitions of his award-winning prints.

== Modern process ==

An aquatint requires a metal plate, an acid, and something to resist the acid. Traditionally copper or zinc plates were used. The artist applies a &quot;ground&quot; that will resist acid. Ground is applied by dissolving powdered resin in spirits, by applying the powder directly to the surface of the plate, or by using a liquid acrylic resist. In all forms of etching the acid resist is commonly referred to as &quot;the ground.&quot;

An aquatint box is used to apply resin powder. The powder is at the bottom of the box, a crank or a bellows is used to blow the powder up into the air of the box. A window allows the engraver to see the density of flowing powder and to place the plate in the box using a drawer. When the powder covers the plate, it can be extracted from the box for the next operations.

The plate is then heated; if the plate is covered with powder, the resin melts forming a fine and even coat; if it is in spirits, the spirits evaporate and the result is essentially the same. Now the plate is dipped in acid, producing an even and fine level of corrosion (the &quot;bite&quot;) sufficient to hold ink. At this point, the plate is said to carry about a 50% halftone. This means that, were the plate printed with no further biting, the paper would display a gray color more or less directly in between white (no ink) and black (full ink).
At some point the artist will then etch an outline of any aspects of the drawing they wish to establish with line; this provides the basis and guide for the later tone work. They may also have applied (at the very start, before any biting occurs) an acid-resistant &quot;stop out&quot; (also called an asphaltum or hard ground) if they intend to keep any areas totally white and free of ink, such as highlights.

The artist then begins immersing the plate in the acid bath, progressively stopping out (protecting from acid) any areas that have achieved the designed tonality. These tones, combined with the limited line elements, give aquatints a distinctive, watery look. Also, aquatints, like mezzotints, provide ease in creating large areas of tone without laborious cross-hatching; but aquatint plates, it is noted, are generally more durable than mezzotint plates.

The first etch should be for a short period (30 seconds to 1 minute, with a wide variation depending on how light the lightest tones are meant to be). A test piece may be made with etching times noted, as the strength of the etchant will vary. More than thirty minutes should produce a very dark area. Etching for many hours (up to 24) will be as dark as etching for one hour, but the deep etch would produce raised ink on the paper.

Contemporary printmakers often use spraypaint instead of a powder, particularly when using the technique known as sugar-lift. To produce a printing surface using sugar-lift, the artist makes a solution of India ink and sugar by melting sugar into heated ink. This mixture is then applied to a prepared plate with a brush, allowing for a bold expression not possible with the most etching techniques. When the ink/sugar mixture is dry the plate is coated with asphaltum (liquid ground); the plate is then submerged in warm water which dissolves the sugar so that the image &quot;lifts off&quot; the plate. The exposed areas are then aquatinted to hold ink and the plate is ready to be printed from.

== Famous examples ==
* Francisco Goya famously took great advantage of aquatint printmaking, in his &quot;Los Caprichos&quot; series (1799); &quot;Los Desastres de la Guerra&quot; (1810–1819); &quot;La Tauromaquia&quot; (1816); and &quot;Los disparates&quot; (c. 1816–1823).
* Master engraver Robert Havell used aquatint for John James Audubon&#x27;s &quot;Birds of America&quot; (1826–1838).
* David Hockney, known for his many paintings of the Los Angeles lifestyle in the 1960s, has created a number of aquatints and etchings used with color in his &quot;The Blue Guitar&quot; series of prints.
* &quot;La Belle Assemblée&quot;, a British women&#x27;s magazine published from 1806 to 1837 had many aquatint colored plates.

<text>This article includes information on the demographic history of Kosovo.

==Prehistory and antiquity==
The Dardani (; ; ) were a Paleo-Balkan tribe who lived in a region named Dardania after their settlement there. The eastern parts of the region were at the Thraco-Illyrian contact zone. In archaeological research, Illyrian names are predominant in western Dardania (present-day Kosovo), and occasionally appear in eastern Dardania (present-day south-eastern Serbia), while Thracian names are found in the eastern parts, but are absent from the western parts. Thus, their identification as either an Illyrian or Thracian tribe has been a subject of debate; the ethnolinguistic relationship between the two groups being largely uncertain and debated itself as well. The correspondence of Illyrian names, including those of the ruling elite, in Dardania with those of the southern Illyrians suggests a &quot;thracianization&quot; of parts of Dardania.

=== Roman antiquity ===
After the Roman conquest of Illyria in 168 BC, Romans colonized and founded several cities in the region, such as Ulpiana, Theranda and Vicianum, later incorporating it into the Roman province of Illyricum in 59 BC. Subsequently, it became part of Moesia Superior in AD 87. The region was exposed to an increasing number of &#x27;barbarian&#x27; raids from the 4th century AD onwards, culminating with the Slavic migrations of the 6th and 7th centuries. Archaeologically, the early Middle Ages represent a hiatus in the material record. The decrease in material finds corresponds to the effects which the plague of Justinian probably had throughout the Balkans as millions of people died and many regions became depopulated. The population decrease in the Balkans partially influenced the Slavic migrations of the following centuries.

==Early and High Middle Ages==

The region had been part of the Roman and the Byzantium until the first major Slav raids took place in the middle of Justinian&#x27;s reign. In 547 and 548 the Slavs invaded the territory of modern Kosovo, and then got as far as Durrës on the Northern Albanian coast and reached all the way down to Greece.

Although the Balkans had been raided by Slavic tribes, the early Slavic settlement and power in Kosovo did not become large until the region was later absorbed into the Bulgarian Empire in the 850s, when Christianity and a Byzantine-Slavic culture was cemented in the central and eastern Balkans. This era represents the formation of most Slavic toponyms in Kosovo which reflect Old Bulgarian development. The Gorani people in Kosovo represent the last population in Kosovo which still speaks a Bulgarian/Macedonian dialect.

Following the collapse of the Bulgarian Empire, the region again became part of the Byzantine Empire after the empire fully re-established itself. It would stay under Byzantine rule for nearly two centuries until Serbian Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja, who had expanded his empire south and into Kosovo, conquered it by the end of the 12th century.

According to Serbian scholars, although Albanians lived between Lake Skadar and the Devoll river in the 1100s, Albanian migration into the plains of Metohija () commenced at the end of the century. Some of the arriving Albanians were assimilated by Serbs and Montenegrins.

According to historian Noel Malcolm the Vlach-Romanian and Aromanian languages originated in the region from Romanized Illyrians and Thracians, and was a contact zone between the Albanian and Romanian language.

Vlach-Romanian and Aromanian toponyms are present in the surrounding areas, such as Surdul in Southern Serbia. 
Katun is a living style associated with Eastern Romance people. Katun means &#x27;village&#x27; in the Albanian, Aromanian and Romanian languages.

When King Stefan of Dečani founded the Visoki Dečani Monastery in the 1330s, he referred to &quot;villages and katuns of Vlachs and Albanians&quot; in the area of the white Drin. Dečanski granted the monastery pasture land along with Vlach and Albanian katuns around the Drim and Lim rivers, which carried salt and provided serf labour for the monastery.

Dušan&#x27;s Code, the legal system established in 1349, included a prohibition of intermarriage between Serbs and Vlachs. The protection of Slav peasants by the Dušan&#x27;s Code forced many Vlachs to migrate from Serbia.

Several Albanian personal names and place names appear in various parts of Kosovo and North Macedonia in the 13th century, the first identifiably Albanian place name appearing in Kosovo, attested in a 1253 statement by Serbian &quot;knez&quot; Miroslav. By 1330, the frequency of identifiably Albanian names in a 1330 chrysobull describing estates in Decan is &quot;many&quot;, although attempts to ascertain reliable percentages of the Albanian population relative to Serbs at this period or later are described by Madgearu as &quot;difficult&quot;.

The presence of Vlach villages in the vicinity of Prizren is attested in 1198–1199 by a charter of Stephan Nemanja. An old Albanian population lived in the region before the Ottoman period.

==9th–13 century==

===Bulgarian rule===

Between ca. 830 and ca. 1015 the region was Bulgarian. According to historian Richard J. Crampton, the development of Old Church Slavonic literacy during the 10th century had the effect of preventing the assimilation of the South Slavs into the Byzantine culture, which promoted the formation of a distinct Bulgarian identity in that area. Afterwards it was ceded to the Byzantine empire as a province called Byzantine Bulgaria.

===Byzantine rule===

In 1072 an unsuccessful rebellion led by local Bulgarian landlord Georgi Voiteh arose in the area and in 1072 in Prizren he was crowned &quot;Tsar of Bulgaria&quot;. At the end of the 11th century, the Byzantine domains in the Balkans became an arena of fierce hostilities. At the end of the 12th century, formally Byzantium was still the sovereign. The disintegration of Byzantium was complete when in 1204 the Fourth Crusade captured Constantinople.

==Late Middle Ages==

Chrysobulls related to tax rights for Orthodox monasteries form the vast majority of the existing sources for the available demographics of Kosovo in the 14th century. The Dečani chrysobulls (1321–31) of Serbian king Stefan of Dečani contains a detailed list of landholdings and tax farming rights which the Serbian Orthodox monastery of Visoki Dečani held over settlements and various communities in an area which spanned from southern Serbia (modern Sandzak), Kosovo, Montenegro and parts of northern Albania. The chrysobulls were signed by King Stefan of Dečani who confirmed existing rights and gave new ones to the monastery. The chrysobulls listed that Visoki Dečani held tax farming rights over 2,097 households of meropsi (dependent farmers-serfs), 266 Vlach households (pastoral communities) and 69 &quot;sokalniki&quot; (craftsmen). Among the settlements over which Dečani held tax rights in modern-day Kosovo, find Serbs living alongside Albanians and Vlachs. In the golden bull of Stefan Dušan (1348) a total of nine Albanian villages are cited within the vicinity of Prizren among the communities which were under tax obligations. During this period, among a part of the Albanians a degree of Serbianization and conversions to Serbian Orthodoxy seems to have taken place.

The Ottoman cadastral tax census (defter) of 1455 in the District of Branković (defter Vuk-ili) is one of the oldest Ottoman tax registers in the Balkans. The District of Branković at the time of the defter included parts of central Serbia (present-day Toplica District and the historical Raška Region), part of northeastern Montenegro and parts of eastern Kosovo (the Kosovo Plain). The vast majority of names recorded in &quot;Vuk-ili&quot; by the Ottomans in 1455 are Slavic.

The defters of 1485–87 of the Sanjak of Shkodra and parts of the former Branković areas recorded:
*Vushtrri district:
** 16,729 Christian households (412 in Pristina and Vushtrri)
** 117 Muslim households (94 in Pristina and 83 in rural areas)
*District of Peja:
**Peja (town)
** 121 Christian households
** 33 Muslim households
* Suho Grlo and Metohija:
** 131 Christian households
* Donja Klina – nationalities not clear according to Ottoman records based on religion 
*Deçan – nationalities not clear according to Ottoman records based on religion
* Rural areas:
** 6,124 Christian households (&quot;99%&quot;)
** 55 Muslim households (&quot;1%&quot;)

Scholarship on Kosovo has encompassed Ottoman provincial surveys that have revealed the 15th-century ethnic composition of some Kosovo settlements. However, both Serbian and Albanian historians using these records have made much of them while proving little. Madgearu (2008) argues that the series of defters from 1455 onward &quot;shows that Kosovo... was a mosaic of Serbian and Albanian villages&quot;, while Prishtina and Prizren already had significant Albanian Muslim populations, and that the same defter of 1455 indicates the presence of Albanians in Tetovo. During the 15th century, Albanians moved to the town of Novo Brdo to work on the mines.

==16th century==

===1520–1535===
*Vushtrri: 19,614 households
**Christians
**700 Muslim households (3.5%)
*Prizren
**Christians
**359 Muslim households (2%)

===1591===
Ottoman defter from 1591:
*Prizren – Christian majority, significant Muslim minority
*Gora – No nationalities are recorded. only religious affiliations of dwellers. 
*Opolje – Christian majority, significant Muslim minority

==17th–18th centuries==

In 17th century reports indicate western Kosovo and parts of central Kosovo was Albanian speaking while the Eastern region was Slavic speaking. A wave of Catholic Albanian colonists arrived in the 17th century to the towns of Pristina and Gjakova. 

In the 17th century the towns of Peja, Prizren, Prishtina were majority Muslim.

Catholic bishop Pjetër Mazreku noted in 1624 that the Catholics of Prizren were 200, the Serbs (Orthodox) 600, and Muslims, almost all of whom were Albanians, numbered 12,000.

During the Great Austro-Turkish War, Albanian Catholic leaders Pjetër Bogdani and Toma Raspasani rallied Kosovo Albanian Catholics and Muslims to the pro-Austrian cause. Reports of 20,000 Albanians in Kosovo that had turned their weapons against the Turks. After the Austrians were forced to retreat, reprisals on the population followed as a result. In the 1690s Raspasani wrote that most of the Catholics in Kosovo had fled to Budapest where most of them died of hunger or disease.

Significant clusters of Albanian populations lived in Kosovo especially in the west and centre before and after the Habsburg invasion of 1689–1690. Due to the Ottoman-Habsburg wars and their aftermath, some Albanians from contemporary northern Albania and Western Kosovo settled within the wider Kosovo area in the second half of the 18th century, at times instigated by Ottoman authorities. There were also movements and forcible movements of Orthodox Serbs into Kosovo instigated by Ottoman authorities and as such, historians have concluded these events affected all categories of the populations rather than one eroding the other.

Significant Albanian clusters also existed in Eastern Kosovo. Some of the towns had a large Muslim Albanian population that did not regain their pre-1690 levels until the mid 19th century.

Early reports state that hundreds of villages between the area of Trepca, Vushtrri and Prishtina region of eastern Kosovo were abandoned, while villages in the western part of Kosovo were still inhabited.

Successive persecutions of Serbs by the Ottomans in the southern Balkans resulted in migrations to areas under the control of the Habsburg monarchy, in particular during the Great Turkish War of 1683–1699. During that war between the Ottomans and the Habsburgs, it led to the flight of a substantial numbers of Serbs and Albanians who had sided with the Austrians, from within and outside Kosovo, to Austrian held Vojvodina and the Military Frontier – Patriarch Arsenije III, one of the refugees, referred to 30,000 or 40,000 souls, but a much later monastic source referred to 37,000 families. Serbian historians have used this second source to talk of a Great Migration of Serbs. Wars in 1717–1738 led to a second exodus of refugees (both Serbian and Albanian) from inside and outside Kosovo, together with reprisals and the enslavement and deportation of a number of Serbs and Albanians by the victorious Ottomans.

==19th century==
Kosovo was part of the Kosovo Vilayet, which included Kosovo, parts of northern and northwestern North Macedonia, parts of modern eastern Montenegro and much of the Sandzak region. Nineteenth-century data about the Kosovo Vilayet tend to be rather conflicting, giving sometimes numerical superiority to the Serbs and sometimes to the Albanians. The Ottoman statistics are regarded as unreliable, as the empire counted its citizens by religion rather than nationality, using birth records rather than surveys of individuals.

A map published by French ethnographer G. Lejean in 1861 shows that Albanians lived on around 57% of Kosovo Vilayet while a similar map, published by British travellers G. M. Mackenzie and A. P. Irby in 1867 shows slightly less; these maps don&#x27;t show which population was larger overall. Nevethless, maps cannot be used to measure population as they leave out density.

Maps published by German historian Kiepert in 1876, J. Hahn and Austrian consul K. Sax, show that &quot;Albanians&quot; live on most of the territory of what is now Kosovo, however, they do not show which population is larger. According to these, the regions of Kosovska Mitrovica and Kosovo Polje were settled mostly by &quot;Serbs&quot;, whereas most of the territory of western and eastern parts of today&#x27;s province was settled by &quot;Muslim Albanians&quot;.

An Austrian statistics published in 1899 estimated about the population of the Kosovo Vilayet:
* 349,350 
of which national affiliation is not mentioned according to the source

During and after the Serbian–Ottoman War of 1876–78, between 49,000 and 130,000 Albanians were expelled by the Serb army from the Sanjak of Niș (located north-east of contemporary Kosovo) and fled to the Kosovo Vilayet. Serbs from the Lab region moved to Serbia during and after the war of 1876 and incoming Albanian refugees (&quot;muhaxhirë&quot;) repopulated their villages. Apart from the Lab region, sizeable numbers of Albanian refugees were resettled in other parts of northern Kosovo alongside the new Ottoman-Serbian border. Most Albanian refugees were resettled in over 30 large rural settlements in central and southeastern Kosovo. Many refugees were also spread out and resettled in urban centers that increased their populations substantially. Western diplomats reporting in 1878 placed the number of refugee families at 60,000 families in Macedonia, with 60–70,000 refugees from Serbia spread out within the vilayet of Kosovo. The Ottoman governor of the Vilayet of Kosovo estimated in 1881 the refugees number to be around 65,000 with some resettled in the Sanjaks of Üsküp and Yeni Pazar.

In the late Ottoman period, Kosovo vilayet contained a diverse population of Muslim Albanians and Orthodox Serbs that was split along religious and ethnic lines.

Muslim Albanians formed the majority of the population in Kosovo vilayet that included an important part of the urban-professional and landowning classes of major towns., while Serbs were a majority in Eastern Kosovo, with a sizable Bulgarian minority in the south as well. Western Kosovo was composed of 50,000 inhabitants and an area dominated by the Albanian tribal system with 600 Albanians dying per year from blood feuding. The Yakova (Gjakovë) highlands contained 8 tribes that were mainly Muslim and in the Luma area near Prizren there were 5 tribes, mostly Muslim. The population of the tribal areas were composed of Kosovar Malisors (highlanders). The town of İpek had crypto-Christians who were of the Catholic faith.

Muslim Bosniaks whose native language was Slavic formed a sizable number of Kosovo vilayet&#x27;s population and were concentrated mainly in Yenipazar sanjak. Circassian refugees who came from Russia were resettled by Ottoman authorities within Kosovo vilayet in 1864, numbering some 6,000 people by the 1890s.

In the northern half of Kosovo vilayet Orthodox Serbs were the largest Christian group and formed a majority within the eastern areas. Several thousand Aromanians inhabited Kosovo vilayet. Bulgarians lived in the southern half of Kosovo vilayet.

Ottoman provincial records for 1887 estimated that Albanians formed more than half of Kosovo vilayet&#x27;s population concentrated in the sanjaks of İpek, Prizren and Priştine. In the sanjaks of Yenipazar, Taşlica and Üsküp, Albanians formed a smaller proportion of the population.

In 1897, the Ottoman authorities ordered a religious census for Kosovo, which found that there were 633,765 Muslims and 333,406 Christians in Kosovo at the time, meaning that Christians formed 35% of the population. Christians were severely underrepresented in the local governments and administration, with only a few officials being Christians in the entirety of Kosovo. Paolo Maggiolini attributes the decline of the Christian population to failure of the 1878 uprising, which was used by the Ottoman authorities to justify forced conversions and expulsions of the Catholic and Orthodox communities in Kosovo.

According to Ger Duijzings, the middle of the 19th century marked the first time when Albanian speakers formed a majority in Kosovo, with 1870s marking the point at which relations between the Serbs and Albanians of Kosovo turned highly hostile and violent. He argues that less than half of Kosovo was ethnically homogenous at the time - constant settlement and migration greatly undermined the local and tribal identities of Kosovo, with most Albanians being poorly integrated and Serbs either living in segregated Christian enclaves or assimilating into the Albanian majority:

Because the process of religious conversion was violent and forced, Kosovo Albanians were also only nominally Muslims, with converts becoming fully only Islamicized after several generations. Duijzings also questions the concept of &quot;Great Exodus of Serbs&quot; of Kosovo propagated by Serbian historians, arguing that the main reason for sharp decline of Christianity in Kosovo was the dismantlement of ecclesiastical structures undertaken by the Ottoman administration in 18th and 19th century, resulting in &quot;a process of Islamicization and Albanianization of Serbs.&quot;

Note: Territory of Ottoman Kosovo Vilayet was quite different from modern-day Kosovo.

==Early 20th century==
According to Aram Andonyan and Zavren Biberyan, in 1908, the Kosovo Vilayet, which included modern Kosovo and the northwestern part of modern North Macedonia, had a total population of 908,115, of which the largest group were Albanians with 46,1%, followed by Bulgarians at 29.1%, Serbs at 12.4% and Turks at 9.8%.

German scholar Gustav Weigand gave the following statistical data about the population of Kosovo, based on the pre-war situation in Kosovo in 1912:
* Pristina District: &quot;67%&quot; Albanians, &quot;27%&quot; Serbs
* Prizren District: &quot;63%&quot; Albanians, &quot;36%&quot; Serbs
* Vushtrri District: &quot;90%&quot; Albanians, &quot;10%&quot; Serbs
* Ferizaj District: &quot;70%&quot; Albanians, &quot;30%&quot; Serbs
* Gnjilane District: &quot;75%&quot; Albanians, &quot;23%&quot; Serbs
* Mitrovica District: &quot;60%&quot; Serbs, &quot;40%&quot; Albanians
* Kaçanik District: almost exclusively Albanian
* Gjakova &amp; Metohija District: almost exclusively Albanian.

=== Ottoman population records ===
The Ottoman population records for 1895 indicate male population of 132,450 Muslims and 73,924 Christians for the Sanjak of Pristina, 73,708 Muslims and 24,101 Christians for the Sanjak of Prizren and 24,852 Muslims and 9,468 Christians for the Sanjak of Ipek, or a total of some 462,000 Muslims (of both sexes), or 68.2%, and some 215,000 Christians (of both sexes), or 31.8%, for the three sanjaks that form the majority of Kosovo. However, the data includes the large Kalkandelen kaza in the region of Macedonia, while the &quot;Christians&quot; category also includes Roman Catholics.

According to the 1905–1906 census of the Ottoman Empire, the population of the Sanjak of Pristina consisted of 278,870 Muslims and 111,328 Serbian Patriarchists, of the Sanjak of Prizren of 221,882 Muslims, 25,482 Serbian Patriarchists and 19,320 Bulgarian Exarchists (data includes the large Kalkandelen kaza in the region of Macedonia) and of the Sanjak of Ipek of 121,264 Muslims and 30,210 Serbian Patriarchists.

Data for the Kalandelen kaza is only available for the 1881-1882 census of the Ottoman Empire. It lists male population of 29,212 Muslims (or some 58,000 Muslims of both sexes), 4,990 Patriarchists (or some 10,000 of both sexes) and 9,830 Bulgarian Exarchists (or some 20,000 of both sexes). Thus, the population of the three sanjaks, minus the Kalkandelen kaza, for 1905/1906 consisted of 564,016 Muslims (78.2%) and 157,020 Serbian Patriarchists (21.8%). No data is provided about the third major confessional group in Kosovo, Roman Catholics.

=== Balkan Wars and First World War (Montenegro and Serbia) ===
Kosovo was part of the Ottoman Empire and following the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), the western part was included in Montenegro and the rest within Serbia. Citing Serbian sources, Noel Malcolm also states that in 1912 when Kosovo came under Serbian control, &quot;the Orthodox Serb population [was] at less than 25%&quot; of Kosovo&#x27;s entire population.

Beginning from 1912, Montenegro initiated its attempts at colonisation and enacted a law on the process during 1914 that aimed at expropriating 55,000 hectares of Albanian land and transferring it to 5,000 Montenegrin settlers. Some Serb colonisation of Kosovo took place during the Balkan Wars. Serbia undertook measures for colonisation by enacting a decree aimed at colonists within &quot;newly liberated areas&quot; that offered 9 hectares of land to families.

== Yugoslav Interwar period ==
In the aftermath of the First World War, Serbian control over Kosovo was restored and the Kingdom pursued a policy to alter the national and religious demographics of Kosovo and to Serbianise the area through colonisation. Kosovo was an area where Serbs were not a majority population and the state sought demographic change in those areas through land reform and a colonisation policy. A new decree issued in 1919 and later in 1920 restarted the colonisation process in places where Albanians lived in Kosovo and Vardar Macedonia.

===1921 census===

* The 1921 Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes population census for the territories comprising modern-day Kosovo listed 439,010 inhabitants:
:By religion:

*Muslims: 329,502 (&quot;75.1%&quot;)
*Eastern Orthodox Serbs: 93,203 (&quot;21.2%&quot;)
*Roman Catholics: 15,785 (&quot;3.6%&quot;)
*Jews: 427
*Greek Catholics: 26

:By native language:

*Albanian: 288,907 (&quot;65.8%&quot;)
*Serbian or Croatian: 114,095 (&quot;26.0%&quot;)
*Turkish: 27,915 (&quot;6.4%&quot;)
*Romanian–Cincarian (Aromanian): 402
*Slovene: 184
*German: 30
*Hungarian: 12

In the Yugoslav census of 1921, Albanians formed the majority population of Kosovo at around 64 percent with some 72 percent belonging to the Muslim faith. Government sponsored colonisation of Kosovo and Vardar Macedonia was initiated in 1920 when on 24 September the Assembly of the Yugoslav Kingdom passed the &quot;Decree on the Colonisation of the Southern Provinces of Yugoslavia&quot;. The decrees were intended as a reward to former soldiers and chetniks for their service during the Balkan Wars and World War One with incentives offered to settle in Kosovo that allowed them to claim between 5 and 10 hectares of land. The military veterans that settled in Kosovo were known as &quot;dobrovoljac&quot; (volunteers) and were a politically reliable group for the state. The colonisation process also entailed the arrival of Serbian bureaucrats to Kosovo along with their families. During 1919–1928 some 13,000 to 15,914 Serbian families came to live in Kosovo as stipulated to the conditions of the decrees. Between 1918 and 1923, as a result of state policies 30,000 and 40,000 mainly Muslim Albanians migrated to the Turkish regions of İzmir and Anatolia. According to Antonio Baldacci, the Yugoslav census of 1921 significantly underestimated the number of Albanians living in Kosovo.

===1931 census===
* According to the 1931 Kingdom of Yugoslavia population census, there were 552,064 inhabitants in today&#x27;s Kosovo.
:By religion:

*Muslims: 379,981 (&quot;68.83%&quot;)
*Orthodox Serbs: 150,745 (&quot;27.31%&quot;)
* Roman Catholics: 20,568 (&quot;3.73%&quot;)
*Evangelists: 114 (&quot;0.02%&quot;)
* other: 656 (&quot;0.12%&quot;)

:By native language:

*Albanians: 331,549 (&quot;60.06%&quot;)
*Serbs, Croats, Slovenes and Macedonians: 180,170 (&quot;32.64%&quot;)
*Hungarians: 426 (&quot;0.08%&quot;)
*Germans: 241 (&quot;0.04%&quot;)
* other Slavs: 771 (&quot;0.14%&quot;)
* other: 38,907 (&quot;7.05%&quot;)
By the 1930s, the efforts and attempts at increasing the Serb population had failed as the Yugoslav census (1931) showed Albanians were 62 percent of the Kosovan population. Colonisation had managed to partially change the demographic situation in Kosovo and the share of Albanians had decreased from 65 percent (289,000) in 1921 to 61 percent (337,272) in 1931 and Serbs increased from 28 percent (114,000) to 32 percent (178,848). State authorities attempted to decrease the Albanian population through &quot;forced migration&quot;, a process that grew during the decade. The second phase of Yugoslav colonisation began in 1931, when the &quot;Decree on the Colonisation of the Southern Regions&quot; was issued on 11 July. This phase of colonisation was considered unsuccessful because only 60 to 80 thousand people (some 17–20 thousand families) showed a willingness to become settlers and gained land, of whom many failed to follow through.

Based in Ankara, the data gathered for 1919–1940 by the Yugoslav Legation shows 215,412 Albanians migrated to Turkey, whereas data collected by the Yugoslav army shows that until 1939, 4,046 Albanian families went to live in Albania. For 1918 to 1921, Sabrina Ramet cites the estimate that the expulsions of Albanians reduced their numbers from around 800,000 – 1,000,000 within Kosovo down to some 439,500. Between 1923 and 1939, some 115,000 Yugoslav citizens migrated to Turkey and both Yugoslavian and Turkish sources state that Albanians composed most of that population group. Yugoslav sources downplayed the number of Albanians who left the region. Official Yugoslav sources claimed that between 1927 and 1939 some 23,601 Muslims from Kosovo left for Turkey (19,279) and Albania (4,322). The exact number of Albanians who were expelled is difficult to determine but between 200,000 and 300,000 migrants moved from Yugoslavia mostly to Turkey between WWI and WWII. From 1923 to 1939, Albanians comprised about 100,000 in the total population which left Yugoslavia.

Albanian scholars from Albania and Kosovo place the number of Albanian refugees from 300,000 upward into the hundreds of thousands and state that they left Yugoslavia due to duress. Other estimates given by scholars outside the Balkans for Kosovan Albanians that emigrated during 1918–1941 are between 90,000 and 150,000 or 200,000–300,000. To date, access is unavailable to the Turkish Foreign Ministry archive regarding this issue and as such the total numbers of Albanians arriving to Turkey during the interwar period are difficult to determine.

==World War II==

During World War II, a large area of Kosovo was attached to Italian controlled Albania. Kosovo Albanians sought to redress the past policies of colonisation and Slavization and power relations between Albanians and Serbs were overturned in the new administration. It resulted in local Serbs and other Serbs that had arrived previously as part of the colonisation plan to be targeted by groups of armed Albanians. Campaigns aimed toward Serbs followed and included the destruction of property, killings, murders and deportations. The majority of Montenegrin and Serb settlers consisting of bureaucrats and &quot;dobrovoljac&quot; fled from Kosovo to Axis occupied Serbia or Montenegro. One estimate places the number of Serbs that were forced to leave at 70,000-100,000. Serbian historiography estimates that some 100,000 Serbs left Kosovo during 1941–1945. Other Serb sources place the number at 250,000. During this period, Vickers estimates the Italian occupation force facilitated the settlement of up to 72,000 Albanians from Albania to Kosovo.

A three-dimensional conflict ensued, involving inter-ethnic, ideological, and international affiliations, with the first being most important. Nonetheless, these conflicts were relatively low-level compared with other areas of Yugoslavia during the war years, with one Serb historian estimating that 3,000 Albanians and 4,000 Serbs and Montenegrins were killed, and two others estimating war dead at 12,000 Albanians and 10,000 Serbs and Montenegrins. An official investigation conducted by the Yugoslav government in 1964 recorded nearly 8,000 war-related fatalities in Kosovo between 1941 and 1945, 5,489 of whom were Serb and Montenegrin and 2,177 of whom were Albanian.

==Communist Yugoslavia==

Following the Second World War and establishment of communist rule in Yugoslavia, the colonisation programme was discontinued, as President Tito wanted to avoid sectarian and ethnic conflicts. Tito enacted a temporary decree in March 1945 that banned the return of colonists, which included some Chetniks and the rest that left during the war seeking refuge. Two weeks later Tito issued another decree and followed it with a law in August 1945 that permitted a conditional return for a minority of the colonists. In total, cases of return numbered 11,168, with 4,829 cases confirmed, 5,744 cases partially confirmed alongside 595 cases being denied. A small proportion of the previous colonist population came back to Kosovo and repossessed land, with a greater part of their number (4,000 families) later leaving for other areas of Yugoslavia. From 1945 to 1948, the Yugoslav government opened the border to Albania with an estimated 25,000 Albanians crossing over and settling in Kosovo. The majority of these post-war migrants were family members of Albanians settled in Kosovo during the Second World War by the Italian occupation force.

After the Second World War and the Yugoslavia-Albania split, Yugoslav authorities attempted to downplay links between Albanians of Albania and Kosovo and to implement a policy of &quot;Turkification&quot; that encouraged Turkish language education and emigration to Turkey among Albanians. In 1953, an agreement was reached between Tito and Mehmet Fuat Köprülü, the foreign minister of Turkey that promoted the emigration of Albanians to Anatolia. Forced migration to Turkey increased and numbers cited by Klejda Mulaj for 1953–1957 are 195,000 Albanians leaving Yugoslavia and for 1966, some 230,000 people. Historian Noel Malcolm placed the number of Albanians leaving for Turkey at 100,000 between 1953 and 1966. Factors involved in the upsurge of migration were intimidation and pressure toward the Albanian population to leave through a campaign headed by Yugoslav police chief Aleksandar Ranković that officially was stated as aimed at curbing Albanian nationalism. Kosovo under the control of Ranković was viewed by Turkey as the individual that would implement &quot;the Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot;. At the same time, a new phase of colonisation occurred in the region as Montenegrin and Serb families were installed in Kosovo. The situation ended in 1966 with the removal of Ranković from his position.

From 1961 to 1981, the ethnic Albanian population of Kosovo almost doubled as a result of high birth rates, illegal migration from communist Albania and rapid urbanisation. Throughout the same period, the population of ethnic Serbs of Kosovo reduced by half, stimulated by an exodus of ethnic Serbs from the region.

The corrections should not be taken to be fully accurate. The number of Albanians is sometimes regarded as being an underestimate. On the other hand, it is sometimes regarded as an overestimate, being derived from earlier censa which are believed to be overestimates. The Statistical Office of Kosovo states that the quality of the 1991 census is &quot;questionable.&quot; .

In September 1993, the Bosniak parliament returned their historical name &quot;Bosniaks&quot;. Some Kosovar Muslims have started using this term to refer to themselves since.

== Milošević government (1990s) ==
By 1992, the situation in Kosovo deteriorated and politicians from both sides were at an impasse toward solutions for the future of the region. Concerns increased among Serbs and an organisation was created called the Serb Block for Colonizing Kosovo in Pristina that aimed to get state officials based in Belgrade to raise the Serb population within Kosovo. As such, the state made available loans for building apartments and homes along with employment opportunities for Montenegrins and Serbs that chose to relocate to the region. In March 1992, nearly 3,000 people from the Serb minority in Albania had emigrated to Kosovo after accepting the government offer. At the time, the government under President Slobodan Milošević pursued colonisation amidst a situation of financial difficulties and limited resources. Laws were passed by the parliament of Serbia that sought to change the power balance in Kosovo relating to the economy, demography and politics. The parliament of Serbia on 11 January 1995 passed the &quot;Decree for Colonisation of Kosovo of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&quot;. It outlined government benefits for Serbs who desired to go and live in Kosovo with loans to build homes or purchase other dwellings and offered free plots of land. Few Serbs took up the offer due to the worsening situation in Kosovo at the time.

Around 10,000 Serb refugees from Krajina and over 2000 from Bosnia were resettled in Kosovo, due to the Yugoslav Wars. In 1995, the government attempted to alter the ethnic balance of the region through the planned resettlement of 100,000, later reduced to 20,000 Serbian refugees from Krajina in Croatia to Kosovo. Some of the Serb refugees opposed going to Kosovo. In 1996, official government statistics placed the number of refugees in Kosovo at 19,000. Most of the Serb refugees left thereafter and a few remained. In early 1997, the number of resettled Serb refugees in Kosovo was 4,000 and 6,000 in early 1999. As the sociopolitical situation deteriorated, Kosovo Albanians numbering some 300,000 fled during this period for Western Europe. After the outbreak of conflict between the Milošević government and the Kosovo Liberation Army, in early 1997, an estimated 9,000 Serb refugees and 20,000 local Serbs left Kosovo.

=== Kosovo War (1999) ===

During the Kosovo war (March–June 1999), Serb forces, apparently, expelled between 800,000 – 1,000,000 Albanians from Kosovo employing tactics such as confiscating personal documents to make it difficult or prevent any future return. Kosovo Albanians later returned following NATO intervention and the end of the war.

In 1999 more than 11,000 deaths were reported to the office of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia prosecutor Carla Del Ponte. Around 10,317 civilians in total were killed during the war, of whom 8,676 were Albanians, 1,196 Serbs and 445 Roma and others in addition to 3,218 killed members of armed formations. , some 3,000 people were still missing, of which 2,500 are Albanian, 400 Serbs and 100 Roma.

In the days after the Yugoslav Army withdrew, over 80,000 (almost half of 200,000 estimated to live in Kosovo) Serb and other non-Albanians civilians were expelled from Kosovo. Estimates of the number of Serbs who left when Serbian forces departed from Kosovo vary from 65,000 to 250,000. In addition, less than one hundred of the Serb refugees from Croatia remained in Kosovo.

==Contemporary ==

===2011 census===
In the 2011 census there were 1,739,825 inhabitants. ECMI &quot;calls for caution when referring to the 2011 census&quot;, due to the boycott by Serb-majority municipalities in North Kosovo and the partial boycott by Serb and Roma in southern Kosovo. According to the data, this is the ethnic composition of Kosovo:
* Albanians: 1,616,869 (92.9%)
* Serbs*: 25,532 (1.5%)
* Bosniaks: 27,553 (1.6%)
* Turks: 18,738 (1.1%)
* Ashkali: 15,436 (0.9%)
* Egyptians: 11,524 (0.6%)
* Gorani: 10,265 (0.6%)
* Romani: 8,824 (0.5%)
* Other: 2352 (0.1%)
* Unspecified: 2752 (0.1%)

As of 2014, there are around 96,000 Kosovo Serbs and about 3/4 of them live in North Kosovo.

<text>Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (; ), born Vishvambhara Mishra () (18 February 1486 – 14 June 1534), was an Indian Hindu saint from Bengal and the founder of Gaudiya Vaishnavism. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu&#x27;s mode of worshipping Krishna with bhajan-kirtan and dance had a profound effect on Vaishnavism in Bengal. 

He is considered the chief proponent of the Vedantic philosophy of Achintya Bheda Abheda. However, the concept of inconceivable difference in non-difference, known as achintya-bhedabheda, was developed later by Jiva Gosvami in his book Bhagavat Sandharbha. 

Mahaprabhu founded Gaudiya Vaishnavism ( the Brahma-Madhva-Gaudiya Sampradaya). He expounded Bhakti yoga and popularised the chanting of the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra. He composed the &quot;Shikshashtakam&quot; (eight devotional prayers).

Chaitanya is sometimes called Gauranga () or Gaura due to his molten gold–like complexion. His birthday is celebrated as Gaura-purnima. He is also called Nimai because he was born underneath a Neem tree.

==Life==
Chaitanya was born in a Brahmin family as Viśvambhara Mishra aka Nimāi, the second son of Jagannātha Mishra and his wife Śacī Devī, the daughter of Nilambara Chakrabarti, both Brahmins of Sylhet region. Jagannātha Mishra&#x27;s family were from the village of Dhakadakshin in Srihatta (Sylhet) (now in Bangladesh). The ruins of their ancestral home still survive in present-day Bangladesh.

According to &quot;Chaitanya Charitamrita&quot;, Chaitanya was born in Nabadwip (in present-day &quot;West Bengal&quot;) on the full moon night of 18 February 1486, at the time of a lunar eclipse.

While still a student, his father died, and he soon married Lakṣmīpriyā. He travelled to east Bengal to become a scholar and support his family, but his wife died in his absence. He then married Viṣṇupriyā, the daughter of paṇḍit Sanātana Miśra. Viśvambhara, also known as Nimāi Paṇḍit, was a promising Sanskrit scholar and once defeated Keśava Bhaṭṭa of the Nimbārka school in a debate on Sanskrit prosody.

In 1508-1509 he left Nabadvip to go to Gaya to perform śrāddha, a ritual homage to his dead father. There, he met an ascetic named Īśvara Purī, who initiated him using a mantra for Kṛṣṇa worship. After this meeting Viśvambhara abandoned all scholarly and domestic pursuits and had no interest except hearing and speaking of Kṛṣṇa. Within a year he took a vow of &quot;saṃnyāsa&quot; (renunciation) and changed his name to Kṛṣṇa Caitanya under his guru Keśava Bhāratī. His mother then asked him to at least live in the city of Puri so that he would not be too far from Bengal.

After becoming a renunciate he spent his time converting and instructing followers in the tenets of Kṛṣṇa bhakti and engaging in communal &quot;saṁkīrtana&quot;. Notably he is said to have debated and converted followers of Advaita Vedānta. He spent two months in Vrindavan in c. 1515 where he instructed Sanātana Gosvāmī and Rūpa Gosvāmi. The last two decades of his life were spent in Puri where he focused on immersing himself in devotional yearning for Kṛṣṇa and his consorts, mainly Rādhā. He died c. 1528-1534.

== Biographies ==
Works on Chaitanya:

* &quot;Krsna-Caitanya-Caritamrta&quot; ( 1513 or 1536–1540; Sanskrit)
: By Murari Gupta. Known as a &quot;kadcha&quot; or chronicle. Chaitanya&#x27;s Navadwipa &quot;līla&quot; and each &quot;panca-tattva&quot; presented as a form of the Lord. Caitanya went for the first time to Murari&#x27;s house at Navadwipa. Murari&#x27;s standing and reputation for learning gave his biographical materials great weight in the Vaishnava community.

==Teachings==

Chaitanya&#x27;s epistemological, theological and ontological teachings are summarised as ten root principles called dasa mula.

==Philosophy and tradition==
From the very beginning of Chaitanya&#x27;s &quot;bhakti&quot; movement in Bengal, Haridasa Thakur and others, Muslim or Hindu by birth, were participants. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, the great sage of Dakshineswar, who lived in the 19th century, emphasised the bhakti marga of Chaitanya, whom he referred to as &quot;Gauranga.&quot; (&quot;The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna&quot;). This openness received a boost from Bhaktivinoda Thakura&#x27;s broad-minded vision in the late 19th century and was institutionalised by Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati in his Gaudiya Matha in the 20th century.

In the 20th century the teachings of Chaitanya were brought to the West for the first time by Baba Premananda Bharati (1858–1914), the author of &quot;Sree Krishna—the Lord of Love&quot; (1904)—the first full-length treatment of Gaudiya Vaishnavism in English. In1902, he founded the short-lived &quot;Krishna Samaj&quot; society in New York City and built a temple in Los Angeles. He belonged to the circle of guru Prabhu Jagadbandhu with teachings similar to the later ISKCON mission. His followers later formed several organisations, including now defunct the Order of Living Service and the AUM Temple of Universal Truth. Another prominent missionary was A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (1896-1977), a representative of the Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati branch of Chaitanya&#x27;s tradition. Prabhupada founded his movement known as The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) to spread Chaitanya&#x27;s teachings throughout the world. Saraswata gurus and acharyas, members of the Goswami lineages and several other Hindu sects which revere Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, including devotees from the major Vaishnava holy places in Mathura District, West Bengal and Odisha, also established temples dedicated to Krishna and Chaitanya outside India in the closing decades of the 20th century.

==Cultural legacy==

Chaitanya&#x27;s influence on the cultural legacy in Bengal, Odisha and Manipur, has been significant, with many residents performing daily worship to him as an avatar of Krishna. Some attribute to him a Renaissance in Bengal, different from the more well-known 19th-century Bengal Renaissance. Salimullah Khan (b. 1958), a noted Bangladeshi linguist, maintains, &quot;Sixteenth-century is the time of Chaitanya Dev, and it is the beginning of Modernism in Bengal. The concept of &#x27;humanity&#x27; that came into fruition is contemporaneous with that of Europe&quot;.

Noted Bengali biographical film on Chaitanya, &quot;Nilachaley Mahaprabhu&quot; (1957), was directed by Kartik Chattopadhyay (1912–1989). A Bengali film based on Chaitanya&#x27;s demise, &quot;Lawho Gouranger Naam Re&quot;, will be directed by Srijit Mukherji where Parambrata Chatterjee will be seen portraying Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.

==Recognition==
In 2024, speaking at the commemorative event for the 150th birth anniversary of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi called Chaitanya Mahaprabhu “the touchstone of love for Krishna. He made spiritualism and meditation accessible to the masses” and recalled his own personal experience of the transformative power of bhakti through kirtan.

<text>A slogan is a memorable motto or phrase used in a clan or a political, commercial, religious, or other context as a repetitive expression of an idea or purpose, with the goal of persuading members of the public or a more defined target group. The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English&quot; defines a slogan as &quot;a short and striking or memorable phrase used in advertising&quot;. A slogan usually has the attributes of being memorable, very concise and appealing to the audience.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;slogan&quot; is derived from &quot;slogorn&quot;, which was an Anglicisation of the Scottish Gaelic and Irish ( &#x27;army&#x27;, &#x27;host&#x27; and &#x27;cry&#x27;). George E. Shankel&#x27;s (1941, as cited in Denton 1980) research states that &quot;English-speaking people began using the term by 1704&quot;. The term at that time meant &quot;the distinctive note, phrase or cry of any person or body of persons&quot;. Slogans were common throughout the European continent during the Middle Ages; they were used primarily as passwords to ensure proper recognition of individuals at night or in the confusion of battle.

==Likability==
Crimmins&#x27; (2000, as cited in Dass, Kumar, Kohli, &amp; Thomas, 2014) research suggests that brands are an extremely valuable corporate asset, and can constitute much of a business&#x27;s total value. With this in mind, if we take into consideration Keller&#x27;s (1993, as cited in Dass, Kumar, Kohli, &amp; Thomas, 2014) research, which suggests that a brand is made up of three different components. These include, name, logo and slogan. Brands names and logos both can be changed by the way the receiver interprets them. Therefore, the slogan has a large job in portraying the brand (Dass, Kumar, Kohli, &amp; Thomas, 2014). Therefore, the slogan should create a sense of likability in order for the brand name to be likable and the slogan message very clear and concise.

Dass, Kumar, Kohli, &amp; Thomas&#x27; (2014) research suggests that there are certain factors that make up the likability of a slogan. The clarity of the message the brand is trying to encode within the slogan. The slogan emphasizes the benefit of the product or service it is portraying. The creativity of a slogan is another factor that had a positive effect on the likability of a slogan. Lastly, leaving the brand name out of the slogan will have a positive effect on the likability of the brand itself. Advertisers must keep into consideration these factors when creating a slogan for a brand, as it clearly shows a brand is a very valuable asset to a company, with the slogan being one of the three main components to a brands&#x27; image.

==Usage==

The original usage refers to the usage as a clan motto among Gaelic armies. Marketing slogans are often called &quot;taglines&quot; in the United States or &quot;straplines&quot; in the United Kingdom. Europeans use the terms &quot;baselines&quot;, &quot;signatures&quot;, &quot;claims&quot; or &quot;pay-offs&quot;. &quot;Sloganeering&quot; is a mostly derogatory term for activity which degrades discourse to the level of slogans.

Slogans are used to convey a message about the product, service or cause that it is representing. It can have a musical tone to it or written as a song. Slogans are often used to capture the attention of the audience it is trying to reach. If the slogan is used for commercial purposes, often it is written to be memorable/catchy in order for a consumer to associate the slogan with the product it is representing. A slogan is part of the production aspect that helps create an image for the product, service or cause it is representing. A slogan can be a few simple words used to form a phrase that can be used in a repetitive manner. In commercial advertising, corporations will use a slogan as part of promotional activity. Slogans can become a global way of identifying a good or service, for example Nike&#x27;s slogan &#x27;Just Do It&#x27; helped establish Nike as an identifiable brand worldwide.

Slogans should catch the audience&#x27;s attention and influence the consumer&#x27;s thoughts on what to purchase. The slogan is used by companies to affect the way consumers view their product compared to others. Slogans can also provide information about the product, service or cause it is advertising. The language used in the slogans is essential to the message it wants to convey. Current words used can trigger different emotions that consumers will associate that product with. The use of good adjectives makes for an effective slogan; when adjectives are paired with describing nouns, they help bring the meaning of the message out through the words. When a slogan is used for advertising purposes its goal is to sell the product or service to as many consumers through the message and information a slogan provides. A slogan&#x27;s message can include information about the quality of the product. Examples of words that can be used to direct the consumer preference towards a current product and its qualities are: good, beautiful, real, better, great, perfect, best, and pure. Slogans can influence that way consumers behave when choosing what product to buy.

Slogans offer information to consumers in an appealing and creative way. A slogan can be used for a powerful cause where the impact of the message is essential to the cause. The slogan can be used to raise awareness about a current cause; one way is to do so is by showing the truth that the cause is supporting. A slogan should be clear with a supporting message. Slogans, when combined with action, can provide an influential foundation for a cause to be seen by its intended audience. Slogans, whether used for advertising purpose or social causes, deliver a message to the public that shapes the audiences&#x27; opinion towards the subject of the slogan.

&quot;It is well known that the text a human hears or reads constitutes merely 7% of the received information. As a result, any slogan merely possesses a supportive task.&quot; (Rumšienė &amp; Rumšas, 2014). Looking at a slogan as a supportive role to a brand&#x27;s image and portrayal is helpful to understand why advertisers need to be careful in how they construct their slogan, as it needs to mold with the other components of the brand image, being logo and name. For example, if a slogan was pushing towards &quot;environmentally friendly&quot;, yet the logo and name seemed to show very little concern for the environment, it would be harder for the brand to integrate these components into a successful brand image, as they would not integrate together towards a common image.

===In Protest===
Slogans have been used widely in protests dating back hundreds of years, however increased rapidly following the advent of mass media, particularly with the creation the Gutenberg&#x27;s printing press and later modern mass media in the early 20th century. Examples of slogans being used in the context of protest in antiquity include the Nika revolt, in which the cry &quot;Nika!&quot; (victory in Greek) was used as a rallying tool and nearly brought down the Byzantine Empire under Justinian I. The basis of slogans have been noted by many political figures and dictators have also noted its effectiveness, in Hitler&#x27;s Mein Kampf he notes to tell and repeat the same talking points without any regard to if they have any philosophical or factual basis in reality, advising to state &quot;big lies&quot; in politics.

The basis of this simple propaganda effect was used by the Nazi and Soviet regimes as noted in their propaganda posters. In contrast, slogans are oftentimes used in liberal democracies as well as grassroot organisation, in a campaign setting. With the increasing speed and quantity of information in the modern age, slogans have become a mainstay of any campaign, often used by Unions while on strike to make their demands immediately clear.

This has been noted by many scholars, as an example Noam Chomsky notes of the worrying fusion of media and reality in &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot; Chomsky discusses this basis as well the potential dangers of this, particularly towards the context of corporations and producing advertisements that either seek to empower or exclude the viewer to encourage an in-group mentality with the goal of getting the viewer to consume. While Manufacturing Consent addresses the use of slogans in the context of national propaganda, Chomsky argues that national and capitalist propaganda are inherently linked and are not clearly exclusive to each other. They are often used in disinformation campaigns, as quick immediate forms of propaganda suited well to modern forms of social media. Earlier writers such George Orwell notes the effective use of quick non-critical slogans to produce a servile population, written primarily in 1984 as a general critique of the manipulation of language.

== Politics and racism ==
Slogans are often used as a way to dehumanize groups of people. In the United States as anti-communist fever took hold in the 1950s, the phrase &quot;Better dead than Red&quot; became popular anti-communist slogan in the United States, especially during the McCarthy era.

Death to America is an anti-American political slogan and chant. It is used in Iran. Death to Arabs is an anti-Arab slogan which is used by some Israelis.

<doc id="174272" wikidata="Q2646341" url="?curid=174272" title="Colonel Blimp">
<text>Colonel Blimp is a British cartoon character by cartoonist David Low, first drawn for Lord Beaverbrook&#x27;s London &quot;Evening Standard&quot; in April 1934. Blimp is pompous, irascible, jingoistic, and stereotypically British, identifiable by his walrus moustache and the interjection &quot;Gad, Sir!&quot;

Low claimed that he developed the character after overhearing two military men in a Victorian-style Turkish bath declare that cavalry officers should be entitled to wear their spurs inside tanks. The character was named after the non-rigid airship and barrage balloon, which were known as blimps.

==Character==
Blimp issues proclamations from the bath, wrapped in his towel and brandishing some mundane weapon to emphasize his passion on some issue of current affairs. Red-faced with rage and emotion, he often makes confused pronouncements. Blimp&#x27;s phrasing often includes direct contradiction, as though upon starting the sentence he did not know how the sentence was to end. His initial words were always a part of an emotional catchphrase. For instance: &quot;Gad, Sir! Mr Lansbury is right. The League of Nations should insist on peace — except of course in the case of war.&quot;, or: &quot;Gad, Sir! Lord Bunk is right. The government is marching over the edge of an abyss, and the nation must march solidly behind them.&quot; Blimp is usually depicted speaking to a cartoon version of David Low, the cartoon&#x27;s creator, and Blimp&#x27;s comments are not infrequently directed at the opinions of Lord Beaverbrook, the owner of the newspaper in which the cartoon appeared.

Blimp was a satire on the reactionary opinions of the British establishment of the 1930s and 1940s. The cartoon was intended to criticise attitudes of isolationism, impatience with the concerns of common people, and a lack of enthusiasm for democracy. These were attitudes which Low, a New Zealander, considered as being common in British politics. Although Low described his character Blimp as &quot;a symbol of stupidity&quot;, he lessened the insult to the British upper class by adding that &quot;stupid people are quite nice&quot;.

==Legacy==
The character has earned a legacy as a clichéd phrase – very reactionary opinions are characterised as &quot;Colonel Blimp&quot; statements.

George Orwell and Tom Wintringham made especially extensive use of the term &quot;Blimps&quot; to refer to this type of military officer, Orwell in his articles and Wintringham in his books &quot;How to Reform the Army&quot; and &quot;People&#x27;s War&quot;. In his 1941 essay &quot;The Lion and the Unicorn&quot;, Orwell referred to two important sub-sections of the middle class, one of which was the military and imperialistic middle class, nicknamed the Blimps, and characterised by the &quot;half-pay (i.e retired) colonel with his bull neck and diminutive brain&quot;. He added that they had been losing their vitality during the past thirty years, &quot;writhing impotently under the changes that were happening&quot;.

E. M. Forster used the term &quot;Colonel Blimp&quot; to described British people who expressed disdain for Indian culture. Herbert Read has also used the term to describe people who were strongly hostile to modern art. The history book &quot;Roads to Ruin: The Shocking History of Social Reform&quot; (1950) by E. S. Turner, was ironically dedicated to &quot;Colonel Blimp&quot;, and reprinted a Low cartoon of Blimp next to the dedication: Turner&#x27;s book described traditionalist politicians who opposed humanitarian reforms as &quot;Colonel Blimp figures&quot;. 

The term &quot;Blimp&quot; continues to be referenced from time to time. In a 1994 article published in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, John Banville recalled a televised exchange between an elderly lady and Kingsley Amis as &quot;an endearing moment, in which one glimpsed the warm and funny man that Amis used to be before he decided, some time in the 1960s, to turn himself into a literary Colonel Blimp&quot;. In a 2006 book, historian Christopher Clark used the term &quot;blimpish&quot; to characterise the Prussian Field Marshal von Mollendorf (1724–1816), who distinguished himself as an officer in the Seven Years&#x27; War but whose conservatism and opposition to military reform were considered to have contributed to Prussia&#x27;s defeat in the Battle of Jena in 1806. In his review of &quot;Garner&#x27;s Modern American Usage&quot;, David Foster Wallace referred to the &quot;Colonel Blimp&#x27;s rage&quot; of prescriptivist journalists like William Safire.

The graphic novel series &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;, which depicts numerous literary characters interacting with each other, includes Horatio Blimp as an overconfident major of the British army who commands the initial strike against the Martians of H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;.

==Film==
In 1943, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger wrote, produced, and directed the motion picture &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; (1943). Filmed during wartime, the movie portrayed the life of an admirable British officer named Clive Candy. The story encouraged the audience to accept that although the officer was honorable, with time his opinions had become outdated, and that winning a modern war required irregular means. The British film featured Roger Livesey in the title role, Deborah Kerr, and Anton Walbrook. The &quot;Blimp&quot; character was not actually called &quot;Blimp&quot; other than in the title, nor did he die.

<text>Georg Gottfried Julius Dehio (22 November 1850 – 21 March 1932), was a Baltic German art historian.

In 1900, Dehio started the &quot;Handbuch der deutschen Kunstgeschichte&quot; (Handbook of German Art History), published by Ernst Wasmuth. The project is ongoing and managed by the &#x27;Dehio-Vereinigung&#x27;, Munich. He gave his name to the Georg Dehio Prize (Georg Dehio Book Prize).

Dehio was born in Reval (Tallinn), then part of the Russian Empire. He died in Tübingen, Germany.

He was laureate of the Pour le Mérite order (&quot;Pour le Mérite für Wissenschaften und Künste&quot;), the Eagle Shield of the German Empire (Adlerschild des Deutschen Reiches) and the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art. He held honorary doctor titles in Göttingen, Tübingen, Frankfurt (Main) and Darmstadt. The minor planet 48415 Dehio discovered circa 1987, is named after him.

<doc id="174274" wikidata="Q473773" url="?curid=174274" title="David Low (cartoonist)">
<text>Sir David Alexander Cecil Low (7 April 1891 – 19 September 1963) was a New Zealand political cartoonist and caricaturist who lived and worked in the United Kingdom for many years. Low was a self-taught cartoonist. Born in New Zealand, he worked in his native country before migrating to Sydney in 1911, and ultimately to London (1919), where he made his career and earned fame for his Colonel Blimp depictions and his satirising of the personalities and policies of German dictator Adolf Hitler, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, and other leaders of his times.

Low was born and educated in New Zealand. His first work was published when he was only 11 years old. His professional career began at &quot;The Canterbury Times&quot; in 1910. The following year he moved to Australia and worked for &quot;The Bulletin&quot;. His work attracted the attention of Henry Cadbury, the part owner of &quot;The Star&quot;, and Low moved to London in 1919, working for that paper until 1927, when he moved to the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. There he produced his most famous work, chronicling the rise of fascism in the 1930s, the policy of Appeasement, and the conflict of World War II. His provocative depictions of Hitler and Mussolini led to his work being banned in Italy and Germany, and him being named in The Black Book.

==Biography==

===Early life===

The son of chemist David Brown Low and Jane Caroline Flanagan, David Low was born in Dunedin on 7 April 1891, and attended primary school there. His family later moved to Christchurch, where Low briefly attended Christchurch Boys&#x27; High School. However following the death of his eldest brother, Low was taken out of school, as his parents believed that he had been weakened by over studying. Low&#x27;s first cartoon was published in 1902, when he was 11 years old, a three-picture strip in the British comic &quot;Big Budget&quot;.

===Early career===
Low began his career as a professional cartoonist with the &quot;Canterbury Times&quot; in 1910. In 1911 he moved to Sydney, Australia to join &quot;The Bulletin&quot;. 
A large format collection of some 350 pieces for those papers was published in the album &quot;Caricatures by Low 1915&quot;.
During his employment at &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, Low became well known for a 1916 cartoon satirising Billy Hughes, then the Prime Minister of Australia, entitled &quot;The Imperial Conference&quot;. After that success, Low published many cartoons depicting Hughes&#x27; forceful and eccentric personality. Hughes was not impressed and apparently called Low a &quot;bastard&quot; to his face. A collection of Low&#x27;s cartoons of Hughes entitled &quot;The Billy Book&quot;, which he published in 1918, brought Low to the notice of Henry Cadbury, part-owner of &quot;The Star&quot;. In 1919 Cadbury offered Low a job with the &quot;Star&quot;, which Low promptly accepted.

===Move to England===
From 1919 to 1927 Low worked at the London &quot;Star&quot;, which sympathised with his moderately left-wing views. In 1927, he accepted an invitation from Max Aitken to join the conservative &quot;Evening Standard&quot; on the strict understanding that there would be no editorial interference with his output. In 1928 he showed his support for newly enfranchised women with his character, Joan Bull. The character appeared for a few years but fell out of regular use as the public concerns about women getting the vote disappeared. Low produced numerous cartoons about the Austrian Civil War, the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, the 1936 Summer Olympics, the Spanish Civil War, and other events of the interwar period. He also worked with Horace Thorogood to produce illustrated whimsical articles on the London scene, under the byline &quot;Low &amp; Terry&quot;.

John Gunther called Low &quot;the greatest caricaturist in the world&quot;. In 1937, Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels told British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax that British political cartoons, particularly those of Low&#x27;s, were damaging Anglo-German relations. In 1937 Low had produced an occasional strip about &quot;Hit and Muss&quot; (Hitler and Mussolini), but after Germany made official complaints he substituted a composite dictator, &quot;Muzzler&quot;. After the war, Low is said to have found his name in &quot;The Black Book&quot;, the list of those the Nazis planned to arrest in the aftermath of an invasion of Great Britain.

===Second World War===

His works are featured in many British history textbooks. On 1 September, the Germans invaded Poland from the west and, on 17 September, the Soviets invaded from the east. Low depicted these events in one of his most famous cartoons, &quot;Rendezvous&quot;, first published in the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; on 20 September 1939. It satirises the cynicism at the heart of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, showing Hitler and Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin bowing politely across the dead body of Poland and greeting each other respectively as &quot;The scum of the earth, I believe?&quot; and &quot;The bloody assassin of the workers, I presume?&quot;. The phrasing is based on that supposedly used by Henry Morton Stanley at his meeting with David Livingstone in 1871, and the dictators are shown raising their hats to one another in greeting similarly to the two explorers in artistic reconstructions of that earlier meeting. The work has been parodied by several other cartoonists.

&quot;The Harmony Boys&quot; of 2 May 1940 depicts Hitler, Stalin, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, and Spanish dictator Francisco Franco &quot;harmonizing&quot; and getting along quite well. When this cartoon was published, the German invasion of the Soviet Union was still more than a year in the future.

His satirical works met much criticism in the British public eye. The British press called him a &quot;war monger,&quot; and many citizens felt disdain for his depictions of appeasement.

===Remainder of career===
Low remained in the United Kingdom for the rest of his career. He left the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; in 1950. That same year, he moved to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and stayed there until 1953. Finally, Low moved to the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; and was there from 1953.

Low received a knighthood in the 1962 Birthday Honours and died at his home in London on 19 September 1963. His obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot; described him as &quot;the dominant cartoonist of the western world&quot;.

A blue plaque commemorates Low at 33 Melbury Court, Kensington.

===Personal life===

Low married Madeline Grieve Kenning of Auckland on 7 June 1920 in St. Paul&#x27;s Church, Covent Garden; they lived for many years in Golders Green, North London. The couple had two daughters: in 1939, Time described Low&#x27;s breakfast as &quot;a political meeting, with the cartoonist, his wife, and his two young daughters threshing out the news.&quot; His wife and daughters survived him. In 1991 a Blue plaque was erected to commemorate his life at Melbury Court, Kensington High Street, London, W8 6NH in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.

<doc id="174276" wikidata="Q17053175" url="?curid=174276" title="Fylfot">
<text>The fylfot or fylfot cross ( ) and its mirror image, the gammadion, are types of truncated swastika, associated with medieval Anglo-Saxon culture. It is a cross with perpendicular extensions, usually at 90° or close angles, radiating in the same direction. However at least in modern heraldry texts, such as Friar and Woodcock &amp; Robinson (see ) the fylfot differs somewhat from the archetypal form of the swastika: always upright and typically with truncated limbs, as shown in the figure at right.

==Etymology==
The most commonly cited etymology for this is that it comes from the notion common among 19th-century antiquarians, but based on only a single 1500 manuscript, that it was used to &quot;fill&quot; empty space at the &quot;foot&quot; of stained-glass windows in medieval churches. This etymology is often cited in modern dictionaries (such as the &quot;Collins English Dictionary&quot; and Merriam-Webster Online).

==History==
The fylfot, together with its sister figures, the gammadion and the swastika, has been found in a great variety of contexts over the centuries. It has occurred in both secular and religious contexts in the British Isles, elsewhere in Europe, in Asia Minor and in Africa.

The gammadion is associated more with Byzantium, Rome and Graeco-Roman culture on the one hand, whereas the fylfot is associated more with Celtic and Anglo-Saxon culture on the other. Although the gammadion is very similar to the fylfot in appearance, it is thought to have originated from the conjunction of four capital &#x27;Gammas&#x27; (, the third letter of the Greek alphabet) but that the similarity of the symbols is coincidental.

Both of these swastika-like crosses may have been indigenous to the British Isles before the Roman invasion. Certainly they were in evidence a thousand years earlier but these may have been largely imports. They were certainly substantially in evidence during the Romano-British period with widespread examples of the duplicated Greek fret motif appearing on mosaics. After the withdrawal of the Romans in the early 5th century there followed the Anglo-Saxon and Jutish migrations.
The fylfot is known to have been very popular amongst these incoming tribes from Northern Europe, as it is found on artefacts such as brooches, sword hilts and funerary urns. Although the findings at Sutton Hoo are most instructive about the style of lordly Anglo-Saxon burials, the fylfot or gammadion on the silver dish unearthed there clearly had an Eastern provenance.

The fylfot was widely adopted in the early Christian centuries. It is found extensively in the Roman catacombs. An example of its usage is to be found in the porch of the parish church of Great Canfield, Essex, England. As the parish guide states, the fylfot or gammadion can be traced back to the Roman catacombs where it appears in both Christian and pagan contexts. More recently it has been found on grave-slabs in Scotland and Ireland. A particularly interesting example was found in Barhobble, Wigtownshire in Scotland.

Gospel books also contain examples of this form of the Christian cross. The most notable examples are probably the Book of Kells and the Lindisfarne Gospels. An example of this decoration occurs on the Ardagh Chalice.

From the early 14th century on, the fylfot was often used to adorn Eucharistic robes. During that period it appeared on the monumental brasses that preserved the memory of those priests thus attired. They are mostly to be found in East Anglia and the Home Counties.

In the 15th century, Thomas Froxmere designed stained glass memorial window for himself and his wife Catherine Cornwallis in the parish church of Droitwich Spa in Worcestershire. The window no longer exists, but Froxmere&#x27;s sketch of it is preserved in the Lansdowne manuscripts in the British Library. The design has figures of him and his wife with annotations. The wife is depicted above a breaking wheel, and the husband, wearing an heraldic tabard, kneels above an ermine swastika. Froxmere&#x27;s notes describe the symbol as a &#x27;. His instructions to the glazier are: &#x27;. According to Henry Bradley in 1897:

According to John Goodall in 1978, the swastika may evoke four set squares, relating Thomas to Thomas the Apostle, who was considered to have been a builder, while the wheel relates Catherine to her own namesake Catherine of Alexandria. According to Clive Cheesman in 2019, &quot;In Froxmere&#x27;s sketch, the swastika is not on a shield but is free-standing like a badge, and indeed there is no indication that it is meant to be hereditary, or heraldic, at all.&quot;

Probably its most conspicuous usage has been its incorporation in stained glass windows notably in Cambridge and Edinburgh. In Cambridge it is found in the baptismal window of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, together with other allied Christian symbols, originating in the 19th century. In Scotland, it is found in a window in the Scottish National War Memorial in Edinburgh. The work was undertaken by Douglas Strachan and installed during the 1920s. He was also responsible for a window in the chapel of Westminster College, Cambridge. A similar usage is to be found in the Central Congregational Church in Providence, Rhode Island, USA, installed in 1893. 
The fylfot is sometimes found on church bells in England. It was adopted by the Heathcote family in Derbyshire as part of their iconographic tradition in the 16th and 17th centuries. This is probably an example where pagan and Christian influence both have a part to play as the fylfot was amongst other things the symbol of Thor, the Norse god of thunder and its use on bells suggests it was linked to the dispelling of thunder in popular mythology.

==In heraldry==

In modern heraldry texts, the fylfot is typically shown with truncated limbs, rather like a cross potent that&#x27;s had one arm of each &quot;T&quot; cut off. It&#x27;s also known as a &quot;cross cramponned&quot;, &quot;~nnée&quot;, or &quot;~nny&quot;, as each arm resembles a &quot;crampon&quot; or angle-iron (compare ). Examples of fylfots in heraldry are extremely rare, and the charge is not mentioned in Oswald Barron&#x27;s article on &quot;Heraldry&quot; in most 20th-century editions of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. Parker (1894) includes it in his &quot;A glossary of terms used in heraldry&quot;, noting that only one instance occurs on coats of arms, that of Chamberlayne.

A 20th-century example (with four heraldic roses) can be seen in the Lotta Svärd emblem.

==Modern use of the term==
From its use in heraldryor from its use by antiquaries&quot;fylfot&quot; has become an established word for this symbol, in at least British English. 

However, it was only rarely used. Wilson, writing in 1896, says, &quot;The use of Fylfot is confined to comparatively few persons in Great Britain and, possibly, Scandinavia. Outside of these countries it is scarcely known, used, or understood&quot;.

In more recent times, &quot;fylfot&quot; has gained greater currency within the areas of design history and collecting, where it is used to distinguish the swastika motif as used in designs and jewellery from that used in Nazi paraphernalia. After the appropriation of the swastika by Nazi organisations, the term &quot;fylfot&quot; has been used to distinguish historical and non-Nazi instances of the symbol from those where the term swastika might carry specific connotations. The word &quot;swastika&quot; itself was appropriated into English from Sanskrit in the late 19th century. However, the word and symbol continue to have major religious significance for Buddhists, Hindus, Jains and other eastern faiths. For this reason, some have campaigned to have all uses of the word in a Nazi context changed to use the [hooked cross]. 

&quot;Hansard&quot; for 12 June 1996 reports a House of Commons discussion about the badge of No. 273 Fighter Squadron, Royal Air Force. In this, &quot;fylfot&quot; is used to describe the ancient symbol, and &quot;swastika&quot; used as if it refers &quot;only&quot; to the symbol used by the Nazis.

<text>Group Captain Wilfrid George Gerald Duncan Smith, (28 May 1914 – 11 December 1996) was a Royal Air Force flying ace of the Second World War. He was the father of Iain Duncan Smith, Member of Parliament and Leader of the Conservative Party.

==Early life==
Duncan Smith was born in Madras, India (now Chennai) on 28 May 1914, the son of a Mysore Post Office Superintendent, Wilfrid Arthur Smith and Anna Cecilia Smith (née Duncan). He was educated at Nairn and Morrison&#x27;s Academy, Crieff, in Scotland, where he joined his school&#x27;s Officers&#x27; Training Corps. Returning to India in 1933, he became a coffee and tea planter, but in 1936 returned to Britain to work as a mechanical engineer, and then was a salesman for Great Western Motors in Reading. With war looming, he joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR).

==Second World War==
A sergeant at the start of the Second World War, Duncan Smith was commissioned as a pilot officer (on probation) on 29 September 1940. Serving with No. 7 Operational Training Unit at the outbreak of war, Duncan Smith was posted to the Spitfire-equipped No. 611 Squadron RAF at RAF Hornchurch in October 1940. He was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) in June 1941, and went to No. 603 Squadron RAF in August 1941 as a Flight Commander. Duncan Smith was due for a rest but had to remain operational, leading his squadron while bringing their new squadron leader up to speed. He was promoted to flying officer (war-substantive) on 29 September. On 20 November he was taken ill, passing out after returning from a convoy patrol. Duncan Smith spent some time in hospital with double pneumonia, the symptoms of which he had assumed was only the result of exhaustion from a long operational tour.

Upon recovery in January 1942, Duncan Smith rejoined the Hornchurch Wing, now flying the improved Spitfire Mk.IX. In March 1942 he was promoted to acting squadron leader and given command of No. 64 Squadron RAF. He was promoted to flight lieutenant (war-substantive) on 27 June. 

During the ill-fated Dieppe Raid on 19 August, Duncan Smith was shot down by an enemy fighter but rescued from the English Channel with injuries and eardrum pain. In August he became an acting wing commander (flying) at RAF North Weald. In November he was rested from operations with a posting to take charge of the Tactics Branch at Fighter Command, his input leading to the formation of the Fighter Command School of Tactics at RAF Charmy Down. He was promoted to squadron leader (war-substantive) on 30 November.

While Duncan Smith&#x27;s non-operational tour was recognised as very productive, he began to seek a return to operations, and he was sent to Malta to command the 244th Fighter Wing. During this time he flew in support of the Allied landings on Sicily. On 12 July his Mark IX Spitfire was badly damaged in combat, but this episode ended well when he landed at Safi airfield on Malta with his aircraft riddled with cannon shells in fuselage, elevator and rudder: Potential victors could be Heinrich Steis from 4./JG 27 or Günther &quot;Hupatz&quot; Seeger of 7./JG 53. On 2 September 1943, just before the invasion of Italy, Duncan Smith ran out of fuel when a switch between fuel tanks failed. He was forced to bail out into the sea, injuring his kneecap in the process. He was rescued after more than six hours adrift. He was very lucky for a second time; while he was being dragged to the Air Sea Rescue Services Supermarine Walrus by a rope, the Walrus was severely shot up by an enemy fighter: The sad end to the story, other than Duncan Smith losing his footwear in the sea, was news that his comrade Dick Charrington had been shot down and killed during this rescue mission by an enemy fighter. Charrington may have been shot down by Alfred Scharl of 2./JG 53 who was credited with a kill at 17:20 2 September 1943, 15 km north of Tropea at low altitude. The identity of the German pilot who severely damaged the Walrus is not known. After all those sunburns, injuries, wounds and the return of his ear pain from 19 August 1942, Duncan Smith was considered unfit for action. As an acting group captain, he then took charge of 324 Wing, finally leaving in March 1945.

Duncan Smith was credited with 17 enemy aircraft shot down, two shared destroyed, six probables, two shared probables and eight damaged in aerial combat. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and Bar and the DFC and Bar in recognition of his bravery.

He was the author of &quot;Spitfire into Battle&quot; (1981), an account of aerial combat in the Supermarine Spitfire.

==Post war==
On 3 December 1946, Duncan Smith was promoted to the temporary rank of squadron leader in the RAFVR (seniority from 1 November 1946), receiving promotion to the substantive rank of flight lieutenant in the RAFVR on 1 November 1947 (seniority from 1 December 1942). On 22 March 1948, he was appointed to a permanent RAF commission in the rank of squadron leader, with seniority from the same date. He received a second Bar to his DFC for service in the Malayan Emergency in 1952, and was promoted to wing commander on 1 January 1953. He retired on 24 November 1960, retaining the rank of group captain.

==Personal life==
Duncan Smith was given his mother&#x27;s maiden name (Duncan) as a middle name—a fairly conventional practice of the Edwardian period—but his father&#x27;s name was &quot;Smith&quot;, not &quot;Duncan Smith&quot; and, in Second World War RAF records, Duncan Smith himself is always listed as W. G. G. D. Smith, not W.G.G. Duncan Smith. It is not known precisely when he started using his mother&#x27;s maiden name as part of his surname but he decided to pass the name to his children. Whether this makes the current family surname &quot;Duncan Smith&quot; or still &quot;Smith&quot; is a moot point.

His second wife, Pamela Summers (whom he married in 1946) was a ballet dancer who was born in Nanking, China where her father was a commissioner in the Chinese Postal Service. Her maternal grandmother was Ellen Oshey Matsumuro, a Japanese woman whose father was a Japanese artist. Their son Iain Duncan Smith is a politician who was leader of the Conservative Party from September 2001 to November 2003 and Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in the Coalition government of 2010. In his office hangs a portrait of Adam Duncan, the admiral who defeated the Dutch Navy at the Battle of Camperdown in 1797. It is, however, very unlikely that W. G. G. D. Smith&#x27;s mother was a legitimate descendant of Admiral Duncan.

<doc id="174282" wikidata="Q236293" url="?curid=174282" title="Marie of France, Countess of Champagne">
<text>Marie of France (1145 – 11 March 1198) was a Capetian princess who became Countess of Champagne by her marriage to Henry I of Champagne. She ruled the County of Champagne as regent during Henry I&#x27;s absence from 1179 to 1181; during the minority of their son Henry II from 1181 to 1187; and during Henry II&#x27;s absence from 1190 to 1197. She was the daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Louis VII of France.

== Early life ==
Marie&#x27;s birth was hailed as a &quot;miracle&quot; by Bernard of Clairvaux, an answer to his prayer to bless the marriage between Eleanor of Aquitaine and Louis VII. Marie was just 2 years old when her parents joined the Second Crusade to the Holy Land. With the birth of her sister Alice in 1150 instead of the desperately needed son and heir the couple hoped for, the marriage broke down and was annulled on 21 March 1152; Marie was 7 and Alice was not yet 2. Custody of the girls was awarded to their father as they were at that time the only heirs to the French throne. Eleanor quickly moved on, marrying Henry, Duke of Normandy, on 18 May. Louis married Constance of Castile in 1154. Just 5 weeks after Constance died while giving birth to their second child and daughter, he married Adele of Champagne on 13 November 1160, who gave birth to Philippe in 1165.

== Marriage ==
In 1153, Marie was betrothed to Henry of Champagne by her father Louis. These betrothals were arranged based on the intervention of Bernard of Clairvaux, as reported in the contemporary chronicle of Radulfus Niger. After her betrothal, Marie was sent to live with the Viscountess Elizabeth of Mareuil-sy-Aÿ and then to the abbey of Avenay in Champagne for her Latin-based education. In 1159, Marie married Henry I, Count of Champagne.

== Regencies ==
Marie became regent for Champagne when her husband Henry I went on pilgrimage to the Holy Land from 1179 until 1181. While her husband was away, Marie&#x27;s father died and her half-brother, Philip Augustus, became king of France. He confiscated his mother&#x27;s dower lands and married Isabelle of Hainaut, who was previously betrothed to Marie&#x27;s eldest son. This prompted Marie to join a party of disgruntled nobles—including the queen mother Adela of Champagne and the archbishop of Reims—in plotting unsuccessfully against Philip. Eventually, relations between Marie and her royal brother improved. Marie&#x27;s husband died soon after his return from the Holy Land in 1181, leaving her again as regent for their young son Henry.

Marie, who had retired to the nunnery of Château de Fontaines-les-Nonnes near Meaux (1187–1190), served again as regent for Champagne as her son Henry II joined the Third Crusade from 1190 to 1197. He remained in the Levant, marrying Queen Isabella I of Jerusalem in 1192. Over the course of her regencies, Champagne was transformed from a patchwork of territories into a significant principality.

== Literary patronage ==

Marie was a patron of literature and her court became a sphere of influence on authors and poets such as Andreas Capellanus, who served in her court and referred to her several times in his writing, Chrétien de Troyes, who credits her with the idea for his &quot;Lancelot: The Knight of the Cart&quot;, the troubadours Bertran de Born and Bernart de Ventadorn, Gautier d&#x27;Arras and Conon de Bétune.

Being literate in both French and Latin, she amassed and maintained her own extensive library. Marie&#x27;s half-brother King Richard, mentions her in a stanza from his celebrated poem &quot;J&#x27;a nuns hons pris&quot;, lamenting his captivity in Austria, was addressed to her.

==Death==
Marie died on 11 March 1198, not long after hearing the news of her son&#x27;s death. She was buried in Meaux Cathedral.

On 25 June 1562, rioting Huguenots devastated many edifices, including the Cathedral of Meaux; it was on this occasion that the tomb of Marie of Champagne, located in the choir, was destroyed.

==Issue==
Marie and her husband Henri I of Champagne had:
*Henry II of Champagne (1166–1197), married Isabelle of Jerusalem in 1192 
*Scholastique of Champagne (1172–1219), married William IV of Macon
*Marie of Champagne (c. 1174 – 1204), married Baldwin I of Constantinople
*Theobald III of Champagne (1179–1201), married Blanche of Navarre

<doc id="174284" wikidata="Q617274" url="?curid=174284" title="Charlie's Angels">
<text>Charlie&#x27;s Angels is an American crime drama television series created by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts for ABC. It originally aired from September 22, 1976, to June 24, 1981, airing for five seasons consisting of 115 episodes. It was produced by Spelling-Goldberg Productions. The show follows the crime-fighting adventures of three women working at a private detective agency in Los Angeles, California, and originally starred Kate Jackson, Farrah Fawcett, and Jaclyn Smith in the leading roles and John Forsythe providing the voice of their boss, the unseen Charlie Townsend, who directed the crime-fighting operations of the &quot;Angels&quot; over a speakerphone. There were a few casting changes: after the departure of Fawcett at the end of the season 1, Cheryl Ladd joined in season 2 and remained in the show till the ending; When Jackson departed at the end of season 3, Shelley Hack joined for season 4, and she was subsequently replaced by Tanya Roberts in season 5.

Despite mixed reviews from critics and a reputation for merely being &quot;jiggle television&quot; that emphasized the sex appeal of the female leads, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; was a top ten hit in the Nielsen ratings for its first two seasons. After the third season, however, the show had fallen from the top 10, and by the fifth season, from the Top 30.

&quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; continues to have a 1970s American cult and pop culture following through syndication, DVD releases, and subsequent television shows. The show also spawned a media franchise with a film series started in 2000, which is a continuation of the series story with later generations of Angels. A reboot television series was broadcast in 2011, but was canceled after seven episodes.

==Development==
After the success of &quot;Police Woman&quot;, the first hour long drama starring a woman, Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts came up with the idea for a series about three beautiful female private investigators as a breakthrough but also as an escapist television series. Producers Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg first considered actress Kate Jackson during the early pre-production stages of the series. She had proven popular with viewers in another police television drama, &quot;The Rookies&quot;. Jackson was initially cast as Kelly Garrett, but was more attracted to the role of Sabrina Duncan, and her request to switch roles was granted. Farrah Fawcett was next cast as Jill Munroe but, like Jackson, did not audition for a role. She was offered a part by Spelling after he had viewed her performance in the 1976 film &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;. Jaclyn Smith was among the hundreds of actresses who auditioned for the role of Kelly Garrett. Despite liking Smith, Spelling and Goldberg were wary about hiring her because their initial concept concerned a brunette, blonde, and red-headed woman. Smith was the only brunette who auditioned for the role and was cast only after producers liked the on-screen chemistry she shared with Jackson and Fawcett.

Producer Leonard Goldberg had the initial idea, three years previously, for a show that would be a cross between &quot;The Avengers&quot; and &quot;Honey West&quot;, a short-lived drama from the 1960s about a female private investigator. Goff and Roberts had first titled the series &quot;The Alley Cats&quot; in which the three females (named Allison, Lee, and Catherine) would reside in alleys and wear whips and chains. Jackson disapproved of the title and, since she was given semi-control over the development of the series, she encouraged producers to find a new title. It was Jackson who decided the three women would be called &quot;Angels&quot; after seeing a picture of three angels hanging in Spelling&#x27;s office, and the series became known as &quot;Harry&#x27;s Angels&quot;. This title was changed, however, when ABC did not want to run into conflict with the series &quot;Harry O&quot;, and it thereby became &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;.

In the initial concept of the series, the three females&#x27; boss would be a millionaire who often aided them in their assignments; however, Jackson and Spelling decided it would be more interesting to have the boss&#x27;s identity remain a secret. With this, millionaire Charlie Townsend was an unseen character on the series who only spoke to the Angels via a Western Electric speakerphone. John Forsythe, who played the unseen Charlie Townsend, recorded his lines in an audio studio and was never on set. Thus, Forsythe rarely met any of his female co-stars. Some years later, he bumped into Farrah Fawcett at a tennis court, as he recalled, &quot;I was coming off the court when she came up to me and said, &#x27;Charlie! I finally met Charlie!&#x27;&quot;. Forsythe was offered the &#x27;Charlie&#x27; role in a panicky late-night phone call from Spelling after the original choice, Gig Young, showed up too intoxicated to read his lines: &quot;I didn&#x27;t even take my pajamas off – I just put on my topcoat and drove over to Fox. When it was finished, Aaron Spelling said, &#x27;That&#x27;s perfect&#x27;. And I went home and went back to bed&quot;.

Spelling and Goldberg decided to add actor David Doyle to the cast as John Bosley, an employee of Charlie, who would frequently aid the Angels in their assignments. Although ABC had approved of a pilot film, they were concerned about how audiences would accept three women fighting crime on their own. ABC executives brought in David Ogden Stiers as Scott Woodville, who would act as the chief backup to the Angels and Bosley&#x27;s superior; he would also be depicted as the organizer of the plan, in similar fashion to Jim Phelps in &quot;&quot;, a series for which Goff and Roberts had written.

The 74-minute pilot film initially aired on March 21, 1976. The story focuses heavily on Kelly Garrett (a role intended for Jackson before she and Smith swapped) who poses as an heiress who returns home to gain her father&#x27;s successful winery. In the end of the film the three women are caught in a bind and Scott attempts to save them, but to no avail, leaving them to solve the dilemma on their own (and with the help of allies made during the story). ABC executives were somewhat disappointed in this initial project, fearing there was more emphasis on camp than serious drama. After viewing the pilot, Spelling encouraged executives to delete Scott Woodville from the series; according to &quot;The Charlie&#x27;s Angels Casebook&quot;, audiences also reacted negatively to the character. Bosley was kept, made slightly less inept than depicted in the pilot, and was given many of Woodville&#x27;s attributes and responsibilities. The series formally premiered on Wednesday, September 22, 1976, at 10:00pm.

The pilot film received enormous ratings, but ABC – who thought this was one of the worst ideas for a TV series they had ever heard – did not believe the figures and showed the pilot again at a later date to check. The ratings were just as high, even for a repeat screening.

Each episode of the series cost between $575,000 and $600,000.

==Premise==
In the initial concept, Sabrina Duncan, Jill Munroe, and Kelly Garrett have graduated from the police academy in Los Angeles, California. Despite proving their capability during training, all three have subsequently been assigned to be a meter maid, office worker, and crossing guard, respectively. Dissatisfied with these jobs, they are recruited to work for the Charles Townsend Agency as private investigators. All of this is explained in the opening credit sequence; neither the pilot film nor subsequent series ever actually depicted an &quot;origin story&quot; as they are seen to have been working as investigators for some time as of the start of the pilot.

Their boss, Charlie Townsend, who nicknames them &quot;Angels&quot;, is never viewed full face, but is often seen from the back, mostly in the company of beautiful women. As a former detective, Charlie made many enemies, therefore to protect the Angels, as well as his own identity, Charlie gives the Angels their assignments via a Western Electric speakerphone; he never meets them face to face (Bosley being the exception), which leads to recurring queries from the Angels as to when, or if he will ever join them on an assignment.

In season two, San Francisco police academy graduate Kris Munroe takes the place of her older sister, Jill, in the trio; in the fourth season, Tiffany Welles, a Boston police academy graduate, takes Sabrina&#x27;s place; and in the fifth and final season, upon Tiffany&#x27;s departure, Julie Rogers, a former New York model fills the void when she is granted a temporary private detective license.

&quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; was generally formatted in the way of a procedural drama, much like the vast majority of other crime shows of the era. Many of the episodes follow a regular structure whereby a crime is committed, the &#x27;Angels&#x27; are given the case details, and then they go undercover to solve the crime. Inevitably, the final scene takes place back at the Townsend office with Charlie offering his congratulations for a job well done. Most episodes have stand-alone plots and are usually not referenced in future episodes.

==Cast and characters==

==Cast changes==
Over the course of its five-year run, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; had a series of highly publicized cast changes. The first of these took place in the spring of 1977, just after the conclusion of the first season. Fawcett turned in her resignation just before the season one finale aired on May 4, 1977. Fawcett&#x27;s decision not to return for a second season triggered a lawsuit against the actress by ABC and Spelling.

During the 1977 summer hiatus of the series, ABC and Fawcett entered a legal battle over her contract. At the beginning of the series, all three female leads signed five-year contracts, and the network was insistent that they live up to their commitments. Business partners Leonard Goldberg and Aaron Spelling tried to work out a deal with Fawcett and her agents. Goldberg and Spelling had arranged for her to make one film during her summer hiatuses, and her choice over subsequent television shows and miniseries. ABC even agreed to raise her salary from $5,000 to $8,000 a week, but she declined those offers. ABC reluctantly released her from her series contract in the summer of 1977. However, she was assigned to another contract with ABC, stating that since she left her contract four years early that she would return to the series later on in its run for six guest appearances. Fawcett would return as Jill Munroe on &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; for three guest appearances in season three, and again returned for three more in season four.
As Fawcett departed the series, ABC began searching for her replacement. Executives eventually noticed singer turned actress Cheryl Ladd and offered her a screen test. Initially, Ladd refused the opportunity for a screen test, but after lobbying from studio executives, she relented. Although executives noticed Ladd was inexperienced, they saw promise in her performance and signed her to a four-year contract. In an effort to keep the hype the series had with Fawcett, Ladd was written in the series as her sister, San Francisco police academy graduate Kris Munroe.

Ratings dropped during the third season. Jackson began to complain about the show&#x27;s diminishing script quality (she once complained: &quot;The scripts are so light it would take a week to get to the floor if you dropped it from the ceiling&quot;) and further stated that initially the series focused on &quot;classic detective work&quot;, but had become more of a &quot;cop story of the week&quot;. During the third season, Jackson was offered the part of Joanna Kramer in &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; (1979) with Dustin Hoffman but the &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; producers refused to reorganize the shooting schedule to allow Jackson time off to shoot the film (the part of Joanna ultimately went to Meryl Streep, who won an Academy Award for her performance). Upset by this situation and her negative opinion of the scripts, Jackson became problematic, as she admitted, &quot;I guess I did cause a few problems&quot; and she was let go. In a statement, Spelling said: &quot;Due to problems on the set, Kate is being dropped for the good of the show&quot;.

Casting calls for Jackson&#x27;s replacement began during the summer of 1979. Several up-and-coming actresses were considered for the role, including Barbara Bach, Connie Sellecca, Shari Belafonte, Judith Chapman, newcomer Michelle Pfeiffer and &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; model Dian Parkinson. ABC producers auditioned Revlon Charlie perfume model Shelley Hack and cast her as Jackson&#x27;s replacement. Producers at Spelling-Goldberg were quoted as saying: &quot;We feel that Shelley Hack has exactly the talent, style, and intelligence we were looking for&quot;. Producer Spelling loved the idea of the headline &quot;The Charlie Girl Becomes A &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angel&quot;&quot;. Hack debuted in the fourth-season premiere as Tiffany Welles, who graduated &quot;top of her class&quot; from the Boston police academy and recruited from the Boston Police Department. In hiring Hack, Spelling&#x27;s priority for season four was to &quot;bring back the glamour&quot; while ABC hoped Hack&#x27;s sophisticated personality would bring an interesting new mystique and intrigue to the series. However, after an initial spike in the ratings, they began to erode, so in an attempt to revitalize declining ratings and regain popularity, ABC released Hack from her contract in February 1980. A statement later issued by Spelling-Goldberg read: &quot;When she signed her contract for the series, Miss Hack had a personal agreement that she could review her continuation with the show at the end of her first season since series television represented an enormous change in her career and lifestyle&quot;, implying that Hack was included in the decision to exit &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. In an interview with &quot;People&quot;, Hack said: &quot;They can say I didn&#x27;t work out, but it isn&#x27;t true. What happened was a network war. A business decision was made. Change the timeslot or bring on some new publicity. How to get publicity? A new Angel hunt. Who is the obvious person to replace? I am—the new kid on the block&quot;. Hack later stated: &quot;I never expected to be there more than a year and I wasn&#x27;t. I did my year and I moved on&quot;.

Casting calls went out for Hack&#x27;s replacement. After a series of false commitments, Spelling and ABC selected model and former dance instructor Tanya Roberts, beating out Jayne Kennedy, Susie Coelho, and what Roberts skeptically called &quot;the [other] alleged 2,000 Angel candidates&quot;. Roberts debuted in the fifth-season premiere as Julie Rogers, a streetwise fighter and model from New York, but the season premiere episode drew mild ratings. She was pictured on the cover of &quot;People&quot; magazine and featured in an article surrounding the series. The article, titled &quot;Is the Jiggle Up?&quot;, asked if Roberts could save &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; from cancellation. Executive Brett Garwood said that they hoped to keep the show going for next year, but nothing was certain.
Between November 1980 and June 1981, the series was broadcast in three different time slots and its ratings further declined, so ABC cancelled the show in the spring of 1981.

== Reception ==

===Critical reception===

&quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; became known as &quot;Jiggle TV&quot;. Jiggle TV was also called &quot;Tits &amp; Ass Television&quot; or &quot;T&amp;A&quot; for short and in the 1970s the amount of sex on television increased, as did its ratings, creating social controversies and consequences, by critics who believed that the TV series had no intelligence or substance. These characterizations stemmed from the fact that the lead actresses frequently dressed scantily or provocatively as part of their undercover characters (including roller derby girl, beauty pageant contestant, maid, female prisoner, or just bikini-clad), and the belief that their clothing was a means of attracting viewers. &quot;Jiggle TV&quot; is seen as trashy and escapist entertainment. Farrah Fawcett once attributed the TV show&#x27;s success to this fact: &quot;When the show was number three, I figured it was our acting. When it got to be number one, I decided it could only be because none of us wears a bra&quot;. Contrariwise on &quot;TV Tales&quot;, Cheryl Ladd said &quot;I&#x27;m just saying, personally, I wore a bra&quot;; Shelley Hack stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t jiggle much, so I didn&#x27;t have anything to worry about&quot;; and Jaclyn Smith said, &quot;Jiggle TV. I thought it was ridiculous&quot;.

Reflecting on the 1970s female-driven drama, Jaclyn Smith, who was the only &#x27;Angel&#x27; to star on all five seasons, states how &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; changed her – and TV audiences across America: &quot;It was ground-breaking. It was about three emotionally and financially independent women. We shot at beautiful locations with fancy fast cars, and they cared about each other, so there was a heart to the show. Critics said that as actresses we were sexually exploited, but it was a nursery rhyme. We were in a bathing suit at the beach, and if there was a hint of a love scene, it was so proper. I think the producers were smart. They wanted to bring in that younger audience and did want families to watch together&quot;. Smith adds: &quot;Each of our characters had their own unique personality, yet the show was all very cohesive - it just worked. We really were all good friends and that showed on the screen&quot;.

Ladd believed the TV series was &quot;inspirational&quot; to women despite the critics calling it a &quot;jiggle show&quot;. She noted, &quot;there hadn&#x27;t been a show like this on the air [with] three powerful women who had the latest hairdos, wore the coolest clothes and could walk around in a bikini. We were very inspirational to a lot of young women. Young women would write us and say, &#x27;I want to be like you. I want to be a cop when I grow up and taking chances to be something else other than the acceptable school teacher or secretary&#x27;&quot;. In reference to the show being called &quot;Jiggle TV&quot;, Ladd said: &quot;Which made me laugh, I never went braless, and I was married and the mother of a 2-year-old. The &#x27;Angels&#x27; were grown-up Girl Scouts. We never slept with anyone; my most &#x27;Aaron Spelling&#x27; moment was wrestling an alligator. With the feminist movement, we were kind of half-heroes, half-goats&quot;.

Hack said: &quot;Of course it&#x27;s fluff, but high-grade fluff. You don&#x27;t compare Agatha Christie to Tolstoy&quot;. Additionally, referring to the Revlon Charlie commercials and &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, she stated on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;: &quot;I was lucky. There were two things I was in that were about making women feel a little more empowered&quot;.

Kate Jackson has stated that she believes the first season of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; was the TV show&#x27;s high point, and it was the most fun for herself, Smith, and Fawcett: &quot;When you think about &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, you think about three specific people&quot;. Jackson added: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what the connection that the three of us have is, but it is there, and it is something extremely special. I think that is the reason the show worked&quot;.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine called &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; an &quot;aesthetically ridiculous, commercially brilliant brainstorm surfing blithely atop the Zeitgeist&#x27;s seventh wave&quot;.

Camille Paglia, an American academic and social critic, said that &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; was an &quot;effervescent action-adventure showing smart, bold women working side by side in fruitful collaboration&quot;.

===Public reception===
&quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; proved to be a runaway hit in the 1976-1977 season in its first of five time slots, Wednesdays at 10:00pm, where it followed &quot;Baretta&quot;. Facing little competition from CBS and NBC, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; finished fifth in Nielsen ratings in the spring of 1977 with an average 26.0 rating. The three lead actresses were suddenly propelled to stardom, with Kate Jackson later commenting that the first few months were like being in the eye of a storm. Farrah Fawcett became hugely popular and was branded a phenomenon. However, the situation off screen was not as rewarding. The long working hours on set, combined with numerous calls for photo shoots, wardrobe fittings, and promotional interviews, took their toll on the trio. Jackson was especially unhappy as she felt the quality of scripts was declining and the format was now more &quot;cop story of the week&quot; rather than classy undercover drama, which had been the intention with the pilot film.

With season two, the series moved up an hour to the Wednesday 9:00pm time slot, where it stayed for three years. During that time, the series competed with such popular shows as &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;, &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, and &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;. The transition from Fawcett to Cheryl Ladd in the second season proved to be popular with viewers. While viewership dipped marginally in the second season, the series still remained in the top five for the 1977–78 season, placing fourth in the ratings, tying with &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and &quot;All in the Family&quot;. In the third season, viewership stabilized, but the series began losing traction as it ranked twelfth behind newcomers &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;, &quot;The Ropers&quot;, and &quot;Taxi&quot; for the 1978–79 season. With Jackson&#x27;s departure and Shelley Hack entering the cast, the show&#x27;s fourth season saw some ratings erosion as it ranked twentieth for the 1979–80 season, tying with &quot;Barney Miller&quot;.

The fifth season saw the final cast change with Tanya Roberts. The final season was plagued by the 1980 actors strike, causing a delayed premier date. In addition, the series was shuffled around with three different time slots: Sundays at 8:00pm, Saturdays at 8:00pm, and finally Wednesdays at 8:00pm, where it remained for the remainder of its run. Despite generally receiving mild competition from its rival networks on these time slots, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; placed fifty-ninth out of sixty-five shows for the 1980–81 season. ABC thereby canceled the series after five seasons and 115 episodes.

===Nielsen ratings / broadcast history===
The &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; seventy four minute pilot film that aired on March 21, 1976, received enormous ratings, but ABC network — who thought this was one of the worst ideas for a TV series they had ever heard — did not believe the figures and showed it again a week later to check. At the time of Spelling pitching the pilot of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; to the network, ABC executive Michael Eisner told Spelling that his pitch had to be &quot;one of the worst ideas I&#x27;ve ever heard&quot;, and ABC executive Barry Diller claimed no one would ever watch it. Despite the ABC networks disbelief in the project, the repeat ratings were just as high.

==Notable guest stars==

Some of those individuals were long-established stars of film and television; others would find considerable fame and recognition many years &quot;after&quot; appearing in the program. Notable appearances of celebrities (whether famous then or later) include those of:

==Episodes==

===Attempted spin-off===
ABC attempted to create a spin-off of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; in 1980 called &quot;Toni&#x27;s Boys&quot;. The backdoor pilot aired near the end of season four, simply titled &quot;Toni&#x27;s Boys&quot; (season 4, episode 23). The episode starred Barbara Stanwyck as Antonia &quot;Toni&quot; Blake, a wealthy widow socialite and friend of Charlie&#x27;s who ran a detective agency she inherited from her late husband. The agency was staffed by three handsome male detectives — Cotton Harper (Stephen Shortridge), Bob Sorensen (Bob Seagren), and Matt Parrish (Bruce Bauer) — who took direction from Toni, and solved crimes in a manner similar to the Angels. The show was not picked up as a regular series for the following season.

===Crossovers===
The character Dan Tanna (played by Robert Urich) from the detective series &quot;Vega$&quot; appeared in the episode &quot;Angels in Vegas&quot; a week before the &quot;Vega$&quot; season one debut. The crossover was simply used to reintroduce the Dan Tanna character and to promote &quot;Vega$&quot; as an ongoing series.

In the episode &quot;Love Boat Angels&quot;, the angels went on another popular Aaron Spelling show, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, and met the crew. Gavin MacLeod, Bernie Kopell, Fred Grandy, Ted Lange, and Lauren Tewes guest starred as their &quot;The Love Boat&quot; characters. The episode aired on September 12, 1979, as the fourth-season premiere and the debut episode of Shelley Hack as Tiffany Welles. The episode placed number one in the Nielson ratings for the week.

Although technically not crossovers, the cast made some notable appearances together. In 1976, Jackson, Smith, and Fawcett appeared as themselves on &quot;The Captain &amp; Tennille Show&quot;. In the fall of 1977, Jackson, Smith, and Ladd appeared as themselves in the first episode of the Spelling-produced comedy series, &quot;The San Pedro Beach Bums&quot;.

==Syndication==
The show was first syndicated on local stations such as KTLA in Los Angeles and WNEW in New York in September 1981, and later on TNT, TV Land, Cloo, ION, Cozi TV, MeTV and getTV. , all five seasons of the show can be purchased in the USA on iTunes. , the series is still available for syndication to local television stations in the United States. , the show has aired in the U.S. on digital broadcast television networks Cozi TV and getTV and the streaming services Crackle, IMDb TV, The Roku Channel and Tubi.

==Other versions==

The series spawned a franchise with a film series which is a continuation of the story with new generations of Angels. It has also inspired many remakes and reinterpretations throughout the years and in different countries. It has also been featured in various other media.

===Film series===
The &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; 1976 original television series inspired Flower Films production company&#x27;s two films, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (2000) and &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot; (2003), with John Forsythe returning as Charlie. Whereas most movie remakes of 1970s TV shows, like &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot;, are actually remakes, the &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; films are set in a different time and thus closer to a film revival. The mythology goes that whenever an Angel leaves, she is replaced so there are always three. The second film had more nods to the TV series than the first film, with Jaclyn Smith making a brief cameo as Kelly Garrett.

&quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; is a 2000 American action comedy film based on the &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; 1976 original television series. Unlike the original series, which had dramatic elements, the film featured more comical elements than were seen in the series. The film was directed by McG, adapted by screenwriters Ryan Rowe, Ed Solomon, and John August, and starring Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu as three women working in a private detective agency in Los Angeles. Bill Murray plays Bosley and John Forsythe reprised his role as the unseen Charlie&#x27;s voice from the original series. Making cameo appearances are Tom Green (who was dating Barrymore at the time of production) and LL Cool J.

A sequel, entitled &quot;Full Throttle&quot;, was released in 2003, directed by McG and written by John August, and Cormac and Marianne Wibberley. It is the sequel to 2000s &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, itself based on the 1976 television original series &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. In an ensemble cast, Diaz, Barrymore, and Liu return as the angels Natalie, Dylan, and Alex, respectively. It sees Crispin Glover and Matt LeBlanc returning, as well as featuring Bruce Willis, Demi Moore, Carrie Fisher, Shia LaBeouf, Robert Patrick, Justin Theroux, Luke Wilson, John Cleese, and Rodrigo Santoro, with Jaclyn Smith reprising her role as Kelly Garrett, and Bernie Mac as Bosley&#x27;s brother. This was John Forsythe&#x27;s final film appearance before his retirement and his death in 2010. The film opened in the United States on June 27, 2003, and was number one at the box office for that weekend, also making a worldwide total of $259.2 million.

Elizabeth Banks wrote and directed a new film of the franchise, starring Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska as the leading trio of the fighting team, and Banks also star as Bosley, with the film featuring multiple characters named Bosley. It was later revealed that the new movie would not be a reboot or a remake of the franchise but rather a continuation that incorporated the events of the original TV series and the McG-directed 2000s films.

===&quot;Behind the Camera&quot;===
In 2004, a television film entitled &quot;Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; aired on NBC; it was based on the book &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels Casebook&quot;, by Jack Condon and David Hofstede.

===Reboot===

Four women (including future star Tea Leoni) were selected to be in a show called &quot;Angels &#x27;88&quot;, which was to serve as an updated version of the show. The show was later named &quot;Angels &#x27;89&quot; after production delays, but the project was abandoned before notice was taken.

In November 2009, ABC began to make a television revival of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, with Josh Friedman handling both writing and executive producing duties, and Drew Barrymore and Leonard Goldberg sharing co-production duties. Developed by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar for ABC, the reboot series premiered by the network on September 22, 2011. ABC canceled the reboot series after one month on October 14, due to low ratings and concluding on November 10, with seven episodes (the eighth and last one was unaired in the US).

===International versions===
From 1998 to 1999, Telemundo and Sony produced a show called &quot;Ángeles&quot;. The weekly hour format did not catch on with Hispanic viewers, who are accustomed to watching &quot;telenovelas&quot; nightly, and the series was soon canceled. In 2002, a German version of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;Wilde Engel&quot;, was produced by the German channel RTL. The show was known as &quot;Anges de choc&quot; in French-speaking countries, and as &quot;Three Wild Angels&quot; in English-speaking ones. In 2004, Taiwanese version of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; titled &quot;Asian Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, was produced by the Asian channel ImaginAsian.

===Collectible items===
During the TV show&#x27;s run, Hasbro Industries produced an extensive range of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; merchandise, which was distributed in the US, the UK, and other international markets. A numerous variety of collectible items were produced, including two versions of dolls, board games, numerous posters, several sets of trading cards, notebooks, a lunchbox and thermos set, a &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; toy van, children&#x27;s beauty products and even record albums. Author Sherrie A. Inness, in the text &#x27;Disco Divas: Women and Popular Culture in the 1970s&#x27; writes that &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels merchandise was big business, Hasbro Industries spent over $2.5 million to advertise its Charlie&#x27;s Angels dolls&quot;.

In the UK, as was common with many popular US programs of the era, a series of tie-in hardcover annuals were published by World International Publishing Ltd, containing stories, comics, photos, puzzles and features on the stars. There are four &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; annuals in total.

Although it was not connected to the show, a 1976 poster of Farrah Fawcett sporting a red bathing suit became the biggest selling poster in history with 12 million copies sold. This poster also helped the burgeoning popularity of the series. The red swimsuit that helped make Farrah Fawcett a 1970s icon became part of the Smithsonian&#x27;s collection in 2011. The picture has been immortalized as a Black Label Barbie Collection doll and the legendary red bathing suit has been donated to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. The designer of that swimsuit is Norma Kamali.

====Comics====
Two British comic strip versions were produced. The first appeared in the Polystyle publication &quot;Target&quot; in April 1978, drawn by John Canning. &quot;Target&quot; was a sister title to the long-running &quot;TV Comic&quot; aimed at older children and featuring TV action and crime shows of the day. Proving unpopular, it folded in August and merged back into &quot;TV Comic&quot; where Canning&#x27;s Angels strip continued until October 1979. The second strip was printed in Junior TV Times &quot;Look-in&quot;, debuting in November 1979 (as soon as Polystyle&#x27;s deal expired), written by Angus Allan and drawn by Jim Baikie and Bill Titcombe.

In June 2018, a six-issue limited comic book series based on the television series was launched by Dynamite Entertainment. A crossover comic book series with &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; and &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;, titled &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels vs. the Bionic Woman&quot; was released on July 3, 2019.

<text>François-Pierre-Gontier de Biran (; 29 November 176620 July 1824), usually known as Maine de Biran (), was a French philosopher.

==Life==

Maine de Biran was born in Bergerac. The name Maine he assumed (some time before 1787) from an estate called Le Maine, near Mouleydier. After studying with distinction at Périgueux, he entered the life guards of King Louis XVI of France, and was present at Versailles during the events of October 1789. 

He entered politics and was part of the Conseil des Cinq Cents in April, 1797; however, as he incurred the hostility of the Directory by his royalist sympathies he withdrew to his patrimonial inheritance of Grateloup, near Bergerac, where he avoided the excesses of the French Revolution and where he devoted himself to philosophy. It was at this period that, to use his own words, he &quot;passed &quot;per saltum&quot; from frivolity to philosophy&quot;. He began with psychology, which he made the study of his life. 

After the Reign of Terror, Biran took part in politics and was elected to parliament in 1812, 1815, and 1820. Having been excluded from the Council of the Five Hundred on suspicion of royalism, he took part with his friend Joseph Lainé in the commission of 1813, which first expressed direct opposition to the will of the emperor Napoleon. After the restoration of the monarchy, he became treasurer to the Chamber of Deputies, retiring during each autumn recess to study at home. 

His constitution was delicate and sensitive and his philosophic bent had already manifested itself by his observations on the influence of the physical state on the moral. As an ideologist he won the prize at the Institut with his essay &quot;Sur l&#x27;habitude&quot; (1802); but his &quot;Décomposition de la pensée&quot; (1805) shows him deviating from the theory of that school, and in &quot;La perception immédiate&quot; (1807), and &quot;Rapports du physique et du morale de l&#x27;homme&quot; (1811), he is an opponent of the eighteenth-century philosophy. In his latter days his tendency to mysticism gradually brought him back towards practical Christianity, and he died a faithful child of the Catholic Church.

He married twice in 1795 and 1814 and had a son Félix in 1796 and two daughters Eliza 1797 and Adine 1800 who all bore the new surname of Maine de Biran. His son, Félix, having only daughters, the name &quot;Maine de Biran&quot; died out in 1879 before being taken over at the end of the 19th century by the natural son of a distant niece, Françoise Gontier de Biran known as Nelly, with an unknown man.

==Thought==

Only a few of Biran&#x27;s writings appeared during his lifetime: the essay on habit (&quot;Influence de l&#x27;habitude sur la faculté de penser&quot;, &quot;The Influence of Habit on the Faculty of Thinking&quot;, 1802), a critical review of Pierre Laromiguière&#x27;s lectures (1817), and the philosophical portion of the article &quot;Leibnitz&quot; in the &quot;Biographie universelle&quot; (1819). A treatise on the analysis of thought (&quot;Sur la décomposition de la pensée&quot;, &quot;On the Decomposition of Thought&quot;) was never printed. In 1834 these writings, together with the essay entitled &quot;Nouvelles considérations sur les rapports du physique et du moral de l&#x27;homme&quot;, were published by Victor Cousin, who in 1841 added three volumes, under the title &quot;Œuvres philosophiques de Maine de Biran&quot;. But the publication (in 1859) by Édouard Naville (from manuscripts placed at his father&#x27;s disposal by Biran&#x27;s son) of the &quot;Œuvres inédites de Maine de Biran&quot;, in three volumes, first rendered possible a connected view of his philosophical development.

At first a sensualist, like Condillac and John Locke, next an intellectualist, he finally became a mystical theosophist. The &quot;Essai sur les fondements de la psychologie&quot; represents the second stage of his philosophy, the fragments of the &quot;Nouveaux essais d&#x27;anthropologie&quot; the third. Biran&#x27;s early essays in philosophy were written from the point of view of Locke and Condillac, but showed signs of his later interests. Dealing with the formation of habits, he is compelled to note that passive impressions do not furnish a complete or adequate explanation. With Laromiguière he distinguishes attention as an active effort, of no less importance than the passive receptivity of sense, and like Joseph Butler, he distinguishes passively formed customs from active habits. He concluded that Condillac&#x27;s notion of passive receptivity as the one source of conscious experience was an error of method – in short, that the mechanical mode of viewing consciousness as formed by external influence was fallacious and deceptive. For it he proposed to substitute the genetic method, whereby human conscious experience might be exhibited as growing or developing from its essential basis in connection with external conditions. The essential basis he finds in the real consciousness, of self as an active striving power, and the stages of its development, corresponding to what one may call the relative importance of the external conditions and the reflective clearness of self-consciousness he designates as the affective, the perceptive and the reflective. In connexion with this Biran treats most of the obscure problems which arise in dealing with conscious experience, such as the mode by which the organism is cognized, the mode by which the organism is distinguished from extra-organic things, and the nature of those general ideas by which the relations of things are known – cause, power, force, etc.

In the last stage of his philosophy, Biran distinguished the animal existence from the human, under which the three forms above noted are classed. And both from the life of the spirit, in which human thought is brought into relation with the supersensible, divine system of things. This stage is left imperfect. Altogether Biran&#x27;s work presents a very remarkable specimen of deep metaphysical thinking directed by preference to the psychological aspect of experience.

So, it has been said there are three stages marking the development of his philosophy. Up to 1804, a stage called by Naville &quot;the philosophy of sensation&quot;, he was a follower of Condillac&#x27;s sensism, as modified by de Tracy, which he soon abandoned in favour of a system based on an analysis of internal reflection. In the second stage – the philosophy of will – 1804–18, to avoid materialism and fatalism, he embraced the doctrine of immediate apperception, showing that man knows himself and exterior things by the resistance to his effort. On reflecting he remarks on the voluntary effort which differentiates his internal from his external experience, thus learning to distinguish between the ego and the non-ego. In the third stage – the philosophy of religion – after 1818, Biran advocated a mystical intuitional psychology. To man&#x27;s two states of life: representation (common to animals), and volition (volition, sensation, and perception), he adds a third: love or life of union with God, in which the life of Divine grace absorbs representation and volition. Biran&#x27;s style is laboured, but he is reckoned by Cousin as the greatest French metaphysician from the time of Malebranche. His genius was not fully recognized till after his death, as the essay &quot;Sur l&#x27;habitude&quot; (Paris, 1803) was the only book that appeared under his name during his lifetime; but his reputation was firmly established on the publication of his writings, partly by Cousin (&quot;Œuvres philosophiques de Maine de Biran&quot;, Paris, 1834-41), and partly by Naville (&quot;Œuvres inédites de Maine de Biran&quot;, Paris, 1859).

==Criticism==

===Equating &quot;cause&quot; with &quot;force&quot;===

Schopenhauer, claimed that &quot;No one has carried this confusion, or rather identification, of natural force with cause so far as Maine de Biran in his &quot;Nouvelles considérations des rapports du physique au moral&quot;, since this is essential to his philosophy.&quot; This confusion of force of nature and cause occurred often throughout the book. &quot;[W]hen he speaks of causes, he hardly ever puts &quot;cause&quot; alone, but almost always says &quot;cause ou force&quot;...&quot; Schopenhauer believed that the confusion was intentional. Biran was &quot;conscious of identifying two disparate concepts in order to be able to make use of either of them according to the circumstances.&quot; Therefore, he purposely equated cause with force in order &quot;to keep the identification present in the reader’s mind.&quot;

<text>Pierre Laromiguière (3 November 1756 – 12 August 1837) was a French philosopher.

==Life==
He was born at Livinhac-le-Haut, Rouergue, and died in Paris. As professor of philosophy at the University of Toulouse, he was unsuccessful and incurred the displeasure of the French parliament by his thesis on the rights of property in connection with taxation. Subsequently, he came to Paris, where he was appointed professor of logic in the École Normale and lectured in the Prytanée. In 1799 he was made a member of the Tribunate, and in 1833 of the Academy of Moral and Political Science. In 1793 he published &quot;Projet d&#x27;éléments de métaphysique&quot;, a work characterized by lucidity and excellence of style. He wrote also two &quot;Mémoires&quot;, read before the Institute, &quot;Les Paradoxes de Condillac&quot; (1805) and &quot;Le cours de philosophie&quot; (1815–1818).

Laromiguière&#x27;s philosophy is a revolt against the extreme physiological psychology of the natural scientists, such as Cabanis. He distinguished between those psychological phenomena which can be traced directly to purely physical causes, and the actions of the soul which originate from within itself. Psychology was not for him a branch of physiology, nor on the other hand did he give to his theory an abstruse metaphysical basis. A pupil of Condillac and indebted for much of his ideology to Antoine Destutt de Tracy, he attached a fuller importance to &quot;attention&quot; as a psychic faculty. Attention provides the facts, Comparison groups and combines them, while Reason systematizes and explains. The soul is active in its choice, i.e. is endowed with freewill, and is, therefore, immortal.

For natural science as a method of discovery he had no respect. He held that its judgments are, at the best, statements of identity, and that its so-called discoveries are merely the reiteration, in a new form, of previous truisms. Laromiguière was not the first to develop these views; he owed much to Condillac, Destutt de Tracy and Cabanis. The accuracy of his language and the purity of his style gave his works great influence, especially over Armand Marrast, Louis Cardaillac and Victor Cousin. A lecture of his in the École Normale impressed Cousin so strongly that he at once devoted himself to the study of philosophy. Jouffroy and Hippolyte Taine agree in describing him as one of the great thinkers of the 19th century.

<text>Pierre Jean Georges Cabanis (; 5 June 1757 – 5 May 1808) was a French physiologist, freemason and materialist philosopher.

==Life==
Cabanis was born at Cosnac (Corrèze), the son of Jean Baptiste Cabanis (1723–1786), a lawyer and agronomist. At the age of ten, he attended the college of Brives, where he showed great aptitude for study, but his independence of spirit was so great that he was almost constantly in a state of rebellion against his teachers and was finally expelled. He was then taken to Paris by his father and left to carry on his studies at his own discretion for two years. From 1773 to 1775 he travelled in Poland and Germany, and on his return to Paris he devoted himself mainly to poetry. About this time he sent to the Académie française a translation of the passage from Homer proposed for their prize, and, though he did not win, he received so much encouragement from his friends that he contemplated translating the whole of the Iliad.

At his father&#x27;s wish, he gave up writing and decided to engage in a more settled profession, selecting medicine. In 1789 his &quot;Observations sur les hôpitaux&quot; (&quot;Observations on hospitals&quot;, 1790) procured him an appointment as administrator of hospitals in Paris, and in 1795 he became professor of hygiene at the medical school of Paris, a post which he exchanged for the chair of legal medicine and the history of medicine in 1799.

Partly because of his poor health, he tended not to practise as a physician, his interests lying in the deeper problems of medical and physiological science. During the last two years of Honoré Mirabeau&#x27;s life, Cabanis was intimately connected with him; Cabanis wrote the four papers on public education which were found among Mirabeau&#x27;s papers at his death (and Cabanis edited them soon afterwards in 1791). During the illness which terminated his life Mirabeau trusted entirely to Cabanis&#x27; professional skills. Of the death of Mirabeau, Cabanis drew up a detailed narrative, intended as a justification of his treatment of the case. He was enthusiastic about the French Revolution and became a member of the Council of Five Hundred and then of the Senate, and the dissolution of the Directory was the result of a motion which he made to that effect. His political career was brief. Hostile to the policy of Napoleon Bonaparte, he rejected every offer of a place under his government. He died at Meulan.

His body is buried in the Pantheon and his heart in Auteuil Cemetery in Paris.

==Works==
A complete edition of Cabanis&#x27;s works was begun in 1825, and five volumes were published. His principal work, &quot;Rapports du physique et du moral de l&#x27;homme&quot; (&quot;On the relations between the physical and moral aspects of man&quot;, 1802), consists in part of memoirs, read in 1796 and 1797 to the institute, and is a sketch of physiological psychology. Psychology is with Cabanis directly linked on to biology, for sensibility, the fundamental fact, is the highest grade of life and the lowest of intelligence. All the intellectual processes are evolved from sensibility, and sensibility itself is a property of the nervous system. The soul is not an entity, but a faculty; thought is the function of the brain. Just as the stomach and intestines receive food and digest it, so the brain receives impressions, digests them, and has as its organic secretion, thought.

Alongside this materialism, Cabanis held another principle. He belonged in biology to the vitalistic school of G.E. Stahl, and in the posthumous work, &quot;Lettre sur les causes premières&quot; (1824), the consequences of this opinion became clear. Life is something added to the organism: over and above the universally diffused sensibility there is some living and productive power to which we give the name of Nature. It is impossible to avoid ascribing both intelligence and will to this power. This living power constitutes the ego, which is truly immaterial and immortal. Cabanis did not think that these results were out of harmony with his earlier theory.

His work was highly appreciated by the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, who called his work &quot;excellent&quot;.

He was a member of the masonic lodge Les Neuf Sœurs from 1778. In 1786, Cabanis was elected an international member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia.

==Evolution==

Cabanis was an early proponent of evolution. In the &quot;Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; it is stated that he &quot;believed in spontaneous generation. Species have evolved through chance mutations (&quot;fortuitous changes&quot;) and planned mutation (&quot;man&#x27;s experimental attempts&quot;) which change the structures of heredity.&quot;

He influenced the work of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who referred to Cabanis in his &quot;Philosophie Zoologique&quot;. Cabanis was an advocate of the inheritance of acquired characteristics; he also developed his own theory of instinct.

Cabanis made a statement that recognized a basic understanding of natural selection. Historian Martin S. Staum has written that:

In a simple statement of adaptation and selection theory, Cabanis argued that species that have escaped extinction &quot;have had successively to bend and conform to sequences of circumstances, from which apparently were born, in each particular circumstance, other entirely new species, better adjusted to the new order of things.&quot;

<doc id="174293" wikidata="Q202780" url="?curid=174293" title="Peter I Island">
<text>Peter I Island () is an uninhabited volcanic island in the Bellingshausen Sea, from continental Antarctica. It is claimed as a dependency of Norway and, along with Bouvet Island and Queen Maud Land, composes one of the three Norwegian dependent territories in the Antarctic and Subantarctic. The island measures approximately , with an area of ; its highest point is the ultra-prominent, Lars Christensen Peak. Nearly all the island is covered by a glacier, and it is surrounded most of the year by pack ice, making it inaccessible during these times. There is little vertebrate animal life on the island, apart from some seabirds and seals.

The island was first sighted by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen on 21 January 1821 and was named after Peter I of Russia. Not until 2 February 1929 did anyone set foot on the island, when Nils Larsen and Ola Olstad&#x27;s Second &quot;Norvegia&quot; Expedition, financed by Lars Christensen, was successful. They claimed it for Norway, which annexed it in 1931 and made it a dependency in 1933. The next landing occurred in 1948, and the island has been subject to some scientific research and a limited amount of tourism. The island became subject to the Antarctic Treaty in 1961. Since 1987, there has been an automated meteorological station on the island. Three amateur radio DX-peditions have visited the island, and there are sporadic landings by tourists.

== History ==
The first sighting of Peter I Island was made on 21 October 1821 by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen&#x27;s expedition, who commanded the ships &quot;Vostok&quot; and &quot;Mirny&quot; under the Russian flag. He named the island after Tsar Peter I of Russia. Drift ice made it impossible for Bellinghausen to come nearer than from the island. It was the first land to have been spotted south of the Antarctic Circle, and was thus also the southernmost sighted land at the time of its discovery. In January 1910, the French expedition led by Jean-Baptiste Charcot and his ship &quot;Pourquoi-Pas&quot; confirmed Bellingshausen&#x27;s discovery, but they also did not land, being stopped from the island by pack ice.
In 1926 and 1927, the Norwegian sailor Eyvind Tofte circumnavigated and surveyed the island from &quot;Odd I&quot;. However, he was also prevented from landing. The Norwegian whale-ship owner Lars Christensen financed several expeditions to the Antarctic, in part for research and in part to claim land for Norway. The latter was motivated by the British taxation of whaling stations in the Antarctic, and Christensen hoped to be able to establish stations on Norwegian territory to gain better privileges and so at least the taxes went to his home country. The first expedition to land on the island was the Christensen-financed second &quot;Norvegia&quot; expedition, led by Nils Larsen and Ola Olstad. They landed on 2 February 1929 and claimed the island for Norway. Larsen attempted to land again in 1931, but was hindered by pack ice. On 6 March 1931, a Norwegian royal proclamation declared the island under Norwegian sovereignty and on 23 March 1933 the island was declared a dependency.

The next landing occurred on 10 February 1948 by Larsen&#x27;s ship &quot;Brategg&quot;. Biological, geological and hydrographic surveys underwent for three days, before the pack ice forced the expedition to leave. The expedition built a hut and placed a copy of the document of occupation from 1929 inside. On 23 June 1961, Peter I Island became subject to the Antarctic Treaty, after Norway&#x27;s signing of the treaty in 1959. Since then, there have been several landings on the island by various nations for scientific investigations, as well as a limited number of ships that have successfully landed tourists on the island.

In 1987, the Norwegian Polar Institute sent five scientists to spend eleven days on the island. The main focuses were aerial photography and topographical measurements to allow an accurate map of the island to be produced. The second important area was marine biological investigations, although also geological, biological and other surveys were conducted. The team also built an automatic weather station. Three DX-peditions have been sent to the island, in 1987, 1994 and 2006.

== Geography ==
Peter I Island is a volcanic island located off the coast of Ellsworth Land of continental Antarctica, and about to the south-west of Smith Island, the nearest of the South Shetland Islands. It has an area of . The island is almost entirely covered by glacier, with about 95% of the surface covered by ice.

Surrounding the island is a tall ice front and vertical cliffs. The long stretches of ice caps are supplemented with rock outcrops. Landing is only possible at three points, and only during the short period of the year in which the island is not surrounded by pack ice. These landings take place on the west side at Kapp Ingrid Christensen, a peninsula which divides the bays Norvegiabukta and Sandefjordbukta. On the cape are some narrow strips of beach, which are suitable for landing. The beach in Norvegiabukta is just wide and is entered via the natural arch Tsarporten. On the west side is a plateau, while the north and south coasts feature ice shelves. The eastern side is the steepest and features two rock columns with flat tops in the sea.

The island is a shield volcano, although it is not known if it is still active, and it has been categorized as either Holocene or historic, based on date samples ranging from years ago. The summit, Lars Christensen Peak, is a wide circular crater. An ultra-prominent peak at elevation, it is named after Lars Christensen. It is not known whether this volcano is extinct or not, because the upper part is apparently unmodified by glaciation, indicating an eruption several centuries ago.

== Environment ==
The island&#x27;s vegetation consists exclusively of mosses and lichens which have adapted to the extreme Antarctic climate. The island has a very harsh climate with strong winds and freezing temperatures. The steady snowfall keeps vegetation to a minimum. The island is a breeding ground for a few seabirds, particularly southern fulmars, but also Wilson&#x27;s storm petrels and Antarctic terns. Penguins, including Adélie and chinstrap penguins, visit the island infrequently. There are numerous seals, particularly crabeater seals, leopard seals and smaller numbers of southern elephant seals.

== Politics ==

Peter I Island is one of Norway&#x27;s two territorial claims in Antarctica, the other being Queen Maud Land. Norway, Australia, France, New Zealand and the United Kingdom have all mutually recognized each other&#x27;s claims in Antarctica. Other countries however, including the United States, do not recognize this claim. Peter I Island is the only claim within 90°W and 150°W and is also the only claim which is not a sector. Being south of 60°S, the island is subject to the Antarctic Treaty. The treaty ensures free access to the island for any scientific investigation, and states that it can be used only for peaceful purposes. 

Norwegian administration of the island is handled by the Polar Affairs Department of the Ministry of Justice and Public Security, located in Oslo. The annexation of the island is regulated by the Dependency Act of 24 March 1933. It establishes that Norwegian criminal law, private law and procedural law applies to the island, in addition to other laws that explicitly state they are valid on the island. It further establishes that all land belongs to the state, and prohibits the storage and detonation of nuclear products.

Since 5 May 1995, Norwegian law has required all Norwegian activity in Antarctica, including Peter I Island, to follow international environmental law for Antarctica. All Norwegian citizens who plan activities on Peter I Island must therefore report to the Norwegian Polar Institute, who may deny any non-conforming activity. All people visiting the island must follow laws regarding protection of nature, treatment of waste, pollution and insurance for search and rescue operations.

<text>Schaffhausen (; ; ; ; ), historically known in English as Shaffhouse, is a town with historic roots, a municipality in northern Switzerland, and the capital of the canton of the same name; it has an estimated population of 36,000 It is located right next to the shore of the High Rhine; it is one of four Swiss towns located on the northern side of the Rhine, along with , the historic , and .

The old town has many fine Renaissance era buildings decorated with exterior frescos and sculpture, as well as the old canton fortress, the &quot;Munot&quot;. Schaffhausen is also a railway junction of Swiss and German rail networks. One of the lines connects the town with the nearby Rhine Falls in , Europe s largest waterfall, a tourist attraction.

The official language of Schaffhausen is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect.

== Name ==
The town is first mentioned in 1045 as &quot;Villa Scafhusun&quot;. There are at least two theories on the origin of this name:

* One relates to a mention of a &quot;ford&quot; across the Rhine that first occurs in 1050. This &quot;ford&quot; may actually refer to a &quot;scapha&quot; or skiff which was used to disembark goods coming from Constance to move them around the Rhine Falls. The name &quot;Scafhusun&quot; then arose from the &quot;scapha&quot; used at that point.
* Another theory is that &quot;Scafhusun&quot; comes from &quot;Schaf&quot; (a sheep), as a ram (now a sheep) formed the ancient arms (traceable to 1049) of the town, derived from those of its founders, the counts of Nellenburg.

===Coat of arms===
The blazon of the municipal coat of arms is &quot;Or on a Base Vert issuant from sinister a Semi Castle Argent with tower with entrance from which is issuing a Semi Ram Sable.&quot; The canting coat of arms refers to the second interpretation of the name, sheep-house.

== History ==

Schaffhausen was a city state in the Middle Ages, documented to have struck its own coins from 1045. About 1050 the counts of Nellenburg founded the Benedictine monastery of All Saints, which became the centre of the town. Perhaps as early as 1190, certainly in 1208, it was an imperial free city, while the first seal dates from 1253. The powers of the abbot were gradually limited and in 1277 the Emperor Rudolf I gave the town a charter of liberties. In 1330 the emperor Louis of Bavaria pledged it to the Habsburgs. In the early 15th century, Habsburg power over the city waned. In 1349 and 1401 (Schaffhausen Massacre), two pogroms occurred in the city. By 1411 the guilds ruled the city. Then, in 1415 the Habsburg Duke Frederick IV of Austria sided with the Antipope John XXIII at the Council of Constance, and was banned by the Emperor Sigismund. As a result of the ban and Frederick&#x27;s need of money, Schaffhausen was able to buy its independence from the Habsburgs in 1418. The city allied with six of the Swiss confederates in 1454 and allied with a further two (Uri and Unterwalden) in 1479. Schaffhausen became a full member of the Old Swiss Confederacy in 1501.

The Reformation was adopted, initially, in 1524 and completely in 1529. The town was heavily damaged during the Thirty Years&#x27; War by the passage of Swedish (Protestant) and Bavarian (Roman Catholic) troops and the very important bridge was burnt down. It was not until the early 19th century that the arrested industrial development of the town recommenced. In 1857, the first railroad, the Rheinfallbahn, running from Winterthur, reached Schaffhausen.

Schaffhausen is located in a finger of Swiss territory surrounded on three sides by Germany. On 1 April 1944, Schaffhausen suffered a bombing raid by aircraft of the United States Army Air Forces, which strayed from German airspace into neutral Switzerland due to navigation errors. Air raid sirens had often sounded in the past, without an actual attack, so many residents ignored the sirens that day. A total of 40 civilians were killed in the raid. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt sent a personal letter of apology to the mayor of Schaffhausen and the United States quickly offered four million US dollars in reparations.

<text>The Westland Welkin was a British twin-engine heavy fighter from the Westland Aircraft Company, designed to fight at extremely high altitudes, in the stratosphere; the word &quot;welkin&quot; meaning &quot;the vault of heaven&quot; or the upper atmosphere. First conceived in 1940, the plane was built in response to the arrival of modified Junkers Ju 86P bombers flying reconnaissance missions, which suggested the Luftwaffe might attempt to re-open the bombing of England from high altitude. Construction was from 1942 to 1943. The threat never materialised; consequently, Westland produced only a small number of Welkins and few of these flew.

== Design and development ==
Westland put forward their P.14, essentially an adaptation of Westland&#x27;s Whirlwind fighter layout (and a more experimental twin, the P.13) to meet Air Ministry Specification F.4 of 1940 for a high altitude fighter. The most obvious feature was the enormous high aspect ratio wing, with a span on the production aircraft of . The compact but troublesome Rolls-Royce Peregrine engines of the Whirlwind were replaced by the more powerful two-stage Rolls-Royce Merlin Mk.76/77. The most significant feature was a pressurised cockpit, which took the majority of effort in the design. After extensive development a new cockpit was developed that was built out of heavy-gauge duraluminium bolted directly to the front of the main spar. The cockpit hood used an internal layer of thick perspex to hold the pressure, and an outer thin layer to form a smooth line. Heated air was blown between the two to keep the canopy clear of frost.

In January 1941, the Ministry of Aircraft Production authorised the building of two P.14 prototypes DG558 &amp; DG562. The F.4/40 specification was revised into F.7/41 that year. The Welkin design was now in competition with the Vickers Type 432 with Merlin 61 engines.

The pressurisation system was driven by a Rotol supercharger attached to the left-hand engine (this was the difference between the Merlin 76 and 77), providing a constant pressure of over the exterior pressure. This resulted in an apparent cabin altitude of when the aircraft was operating at its design altitude of . This cabin altitude was still too high for normal breathing, so the pilot had to wear an oxygen mask during flight. A rubber gasket filled with the pressurized air sealed the canopy when the system was turned on, and a valve ensured the pressure was controlled automatically. Moreover, the pilot also had to wear a high altitude suit as he might have been required to bail out at altitude.

The Welkin required a sophisticated electrical system. This was to minimise the number of seals and points of entry in the cockpit for the controls and instrumentation. It took an electrician experienced in the features of the Welkin four hours to undertake a pre-flight check of this system. The wings were so large that the high lift Fowler flaps of the Whirlwind were not needed, and were replaced by a simple split flap. The extra wing area also required more stability, so the tail was lengthened to provide a longer moment arm. The armament − four Hispano 20 mm cannon − was the same as the Whirlwind&#x27;s, but the Welkin carried the guns in a tray in its belly, which facilitated loading. In that position, muzzle flash was also less likely to dazzle the pilot.

The Welkin was seriously handicapped by compressibility problems caused by its long, high aspect-ratio wing which needed to be thick at the root (thickness-to-chord ratio of about 19%) for strength reasons. Compressibility caused the flight envelope (flyable speed range) between high-incidence stall and shock-stall to become very small at high altitudes – any decrease in airspeed causing a &quot;normal&quot; stall, any increase causing a shock-stall due to the aircraft&#x27;s limiting critical Mach number. This reduction of the speed envelope is a problem common to all subsonic high-altitude designs and also occurred with the later Lockheed U-2. When W.E.W. Petter came to design his next high-altitude aircraft, the English Electric Canberra jet bomber, the required wing area was distinguished by noticeably short wings, with thickness-to-chord ratio (t/c) at the root of 12%, a t/c ratio which delays compressibility effects to an aircraft speed of about Mach 0.85.

Information on the Welkin was only released at the end of the war.

A two-seat radar-equipped night fighter version known as the Welkin NF.Mk.II for specification F.9/43 was developed but only one was eventually produced as the variant was not ordered into production.

==Operational history==
By the time the Welkin Mk.I was complete and in production, it was apparent that the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was no longer conducting high altitude missions, due largely to successful interceptions by specially modified Supermarine Spitfires. Only 77 complete Welkins were produced, plus a further 26 as engine-less airframes. Although two Welkins served with the Fighter Interception Unit based at RAF Wittering from May to November 1944, where they were used to gain experience and formulate tactics for high altitude fighter operations, the Welkin was never used operationally by the RAF.

==Variants==
* P.14: Two prototypes built to meet Air Ministry Specification F.7/41.
* Welkin Mk.I: Single-seat twin-engine high altitude fighter aircraft, 75 built, further 26 aircraft were completed without engines.
* Welkin NF.Mk.II: Two-seat night fighter prototype, one converted from Mark I.

==Operators==
* Royal Air Force
** Fighter Interception Unit – RAF Wittering (two aircraft for evaluation)

<text>Radolfzell am Bodensee () is a town in the state of Baden-Württemberg, Germany, located at the western end (Zeller Lake) of Lake Constance, approximately northwest of the city of Konstanz (Constance). It is the third largest town, after Konstanz and Singen, in the district of Konstanz.

It is situated in the Hegau region. The mouth of the river Radolfzeller Aach is located west of Radolfzell.

It is a well-known health care town (). In 1990, Radolfzell was named the Federal Environment Capital City of Germany.

==History==

This town developed out of a monastery founded in 826 AD as a &quot;cell&quot; under Bishop Radolf of Verona. The town belonged to the Abbey of Reichenau, then for a long time to the House of Habsburg, and for 40 years it was a Free Imperial City.

In the centre is the Gothic Cathedral (), dating from the 15th century and decorated in the Baroque style in the 18th. One particularly beautiful feature is the Rosary altar by the Zürn brothers and the Master of the House&#x27;s Altar (1750) which contains the relics of the local Radolfzell saints Theopont, Senesius and Zeno. The is celebrated in their honour every year on the third Sunday in July, and the next day a famous Water Procession is held, as it has been every year since 1797. The citizens of the nearby village of Moos make a pilgrimage to Radolfzell in picturesquely decorated boats to fulfil an ancient oath.

A notable structure in the town is the Austrian mansion in the market square, built in stages from the 17th to the 19th century, the knightly hall dating from 1626. Also of note are a number of historical Patrician houses.

Radolfzell was the birthplace of cartographer Martin Waldseemüller&#x27;s mother.

<text>Zengakuren is a league of university student associations founded in 1948 in Japan. The word is an abridgement of which literally means &quot;All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations.&quot; Notable for organizing protests and marches, Zengakuren has been involved in Japan&#x27;s anti-Red Purge movement, the anti-military base movement, the Anpo protests against the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, the 1968–1969 Japanese university protests, and the struggle against the construction of Narita Airport.

==History==

Zengakuren emerged in the early postwar period as students at Japanese universities established self-governing associations (&quot;jichikai&quot;) in order to protest against perceived fascist remnants in the university system and to organize against proposed tuition hikes. All university students were automatically enrolled in these associations, and dues were automatically deducted from their tuition. In the wake of a failed general strike in 1947, the Japan Communist Party (JCP) stepped into organize the separate university associations into a single nationwide organization. As a result of this extensive organizing effort, the formation of Zengakuren was officially announced on September 18, 1948. Teruo Takei, a Tokyo University student and member of the Japanese Communist Party, was the organization&#x27;s first chairman. Towards the end of 1948, Zengakuren comprised almost 60% of Japan&#x27;s total student population.

Over the course of the 1950s, Zengakuren took part in a number of &quot;struggles&quot; (&quot;tōsō&quot;) and protest movements, including the &quot;Bloody May Day&quot; protests against the terms of the San Francisco Peace Treaty on May 1, 1952, the struggle against the Anti-Subversive Activities Law from 1952 to 1953, the movement against nuclear testing after the Lucky Dragon Incident of 1954, the &quot;Sunagawa Struggle&quot; against the expansion of the United States&#x27; Tachikawa Air Base in 1955–1957, the 1958 movement against the Police Duties Bill, and the massive Anpo protests against the US-Japan Security Treaty in 1959–1960.

In the late 1950s, an &quot;anti-Stalinist&quot; (i.e. anti-JCP) faction within Zengakuren nicknamed &quot;The Bund&quot; (&quot;Bunto&quot; in Japanese) managed to secure control of Zengakuren, in part by rigging elections. Their control of the organization was strenuously opposed by the &quot;anti-mainstream&quot; pro-JCP faction. This began the process of numerous internal schisms within Zengakuren that would continue throughout the 1960s. Nevertheless, for the time being Zengakuren held together in order mobilize its full power to try to stop the 1960 revision of the US-Japan Security Treaty. At the apex of its organizing power during the anti-Treaty protests in 1960, Zengakuren was able to count on around 250 &quot;jichikai&quot; at 110 schools, representing a total strength of around 290,000 students.

The first open splits within Zengakuren occurred in the immediate aftermath, as despondency at the failure of the anti-Treaty protests to stop the Treaty from being ratified led to numerous rounds of recriminations. Thereafter, the pro-JCP group split off from Zengakuren entirely to form a rival organization called &quot;Zenjiren,&quot; and the remainder of Zengakuren split up into a large number of warring &quot;sects&quot; (&quot;sekuto&quot;), who would battle against each other at least as much as they battled against the police. Arming themselves with construction helmets painted in the colors of their various factions and large wooden staves they called &quot;violence sticks&quot; (&quot;gebabō,&quot; from the German &quot;Gewalt&quot;), the participated in a number of struggles throughout the 1960s and beyond, including the struggle against normalization of diplomatic relations with Korea in 1965, protests against the docking in Japan of US Navy nuclear-powered submarines and aircraft carriers, anti-Vietnam War protests, the university struggles of 1968–69, and the Sanrizuka Struggle against the construction of Narita Airport from 1968 into the mid-1980s.

Although dozens of rival sects emerged over the course of the 1960s, three major groupings occurred:
# &quot;Minseidō&quot;: student groups affiliated with the Japan Communist Party
# &quot;Sanpa Zengakuren&quot;: A &quot;three-faction&quot; (&quot;sanpa&quot;) alliance of groups critical of the JCP: the Second Bund, Kaihō-ha, and Chūkaku-ha
# &quot;Kakumaru-ha&quot;: The &quot;Revolutionary Marxist Faction&quot; of the Japan Revolutionary Communist League, it fought murderous battles with the Sanpa groups, even as it also opposed the JCP

By the end of the 1960s, there were several different factions claiming the mantle of the name &quot;Zengakuren.&quot; Several different groups still claim this title today, and remain active, although their numbers have dwindled greatly since their heyday in the 1950s and 1960s.

== Current status ==
As of 1999, there were said to be five Zengakuren factions:
* Japan Revolutionary Communist League (Revolutionary Marxist Faction)
* Japanese Communist Party (Democratic Youth League of Japan)
* Revolutionary Communist League, National Committee
* 

In the late 2010s, Zengakuren (Japanese Communist Party faction) was inactive.

<doc id="174311" wikidata="Q44645" url="?curid=174311" title="Benjamin Thompson">
<text>Colonel Sir Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, FRS (26 March 175321 August 1814), was an American-born British military officer, scientist, inventor and nobleman. Born in Woburn, Massachusetts, he supported the Loyalist cause during the American War of Independence, commanding the King&#x27;s American Dragoons during the conflict. After the war ended in 1783, Thompson moved to London, where he was recognised for his administrative talents and received a knighthood from George III in 1784. 

A prolific scientist and inventor, Thompson also created several new warship designs. He subsequently moved to the Electorate of Bavaria and entered into the employ of the Bavarian government, heavily reorganising the Bavarian Army. Thompson was rewarded for his efforts by being made an Imperial Count in 1792 before dying in Paris in 1814.

==Early years==

Thompson was born in rural Woburn, in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, on 26 March 1753; his birthplace is preserved as a museum. He was educated mainly at the village school, although he sometimes walked almost ten miles to Cambridge with the older Loammi Baldwin to attend lectures by Professor John Winthrop of Harvard College. At the age of 13 he was apprenticed to John Appleton, a merchant of nearby Salem. Thompson excelled at his trade, and coming in contact with refined and well educated people for the first time, adopted many of their characteristics including an interest in science. While recuperating in Woburn in 1769 from an injury, Thompson conducted his first experiments studying the nature of heat and began to correspond with Baldwin and others about them. Later that year he worked several months for a Boston shopkeeper and then apprenticed himself briefly, and unsuccessfully, to a doctor in Woburn.

Thompson&#x27;s prospects were dim in 1772 but in that year they changed abruptly. He met, charmed and married a rich and well-connected widow, an heiress named Sarah Rolfe (née Walker). Her father was a minister, and her late husband left her property at Rumford, Province of New Hampshire, which is today in the modern city of Concord. They moved to Portsmouth, and through his wife&#x27;s influence with the governor, he was appointed a major in the New Hampshire Militia. Their child (also named Sarah) was born in 1774.

==American Revolutionary War==
When the American Revolutionary War began, Thompson, by now a wealthy and influential landowner, came out in opposition to the uprising. He soon used his connections in the state militia to recruit and arm loyalists seeking to aid British forces fighting the rebels. This earned him the enmity of New Hampshire&#x27;s Patriot faction; he was stripped of his command and a mob attacked and burned Thompson&#x27;s house. He fled to the British lines, abandoning his wife, as it turned out, permanently. Thompson became a political and military advisor to General Thomas Gage (whom he was already passing information on the Americans to), and later assisted Lord George Germain in the organization and provisioning of Loyalist units.

In 1781, Thompson financed his own military unit - The King&#x27;s American Dragoons - which primarily served on Long Island in 1782 and early 1783, where they earned local notoriety for demolishing a church and burial ground in order to erect Fort Golgotha in Huntington.

While working with the British armies in America he conducted experiments to measure the force of gunpowder, the results of which were widely acclaimed when published in 1781 in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; of the Royal Society. On the strength of this, he arrived in London at the end of the war with a reputation as an accomplished scientist.

== Bavarian maturity ==


In 1785, he moved to Bavaria where he became an &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to the Prince-elector Charles Theodore. He spent eleven years in Bavaria, reorganizing the army and establishing workhouses for the poor. He also invented Rumford&#x27;s Soup, a soup for the poor, and established the cultivation of the potato in Bavaria. He studied methods of cooking, heating, and lighting, including the relative costs and efficiencies of wax candles, tallow candles, and oil lamps.
On Prince Charles&#x27; behalf he created the Englischer Garten in Munich in 1789; it remains today and is known as one of the largest urban public parks in the world. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1789.

For his efforts, in 1791 Thompson was made an Imperial Count, becoming &quot;Reichsgraf von Rumford&quot;. He took the name &quot;Rumford&quot; after the town of Rumford, New Hampshire, which was an older name for Concord where he had been married.

==Science and engineering==
===Experiments on heat===

His experiments on gunnery and explosives led to an interest in heat. He devised a method for measuring the specific heat of a solid substance but was disappointed when Johan Wilcke published his parallel discovery first.

Thompson next investigated the insulating properties of various materials, including fur, wool and feathers. He correctly appreciated that the insulating properties of these natural materials arise from the fact that they inhibit the convection of air. He then made the somewhat reckless, and incorrect, inference that air and, in fact, all gases, were perfect non-conductors of heat. He further saw this as evidence of the argument from design, contending that divine providence had arranged for fur on animals in such a way as to guarantee their comfort. 

In 1797, he extended his claim about non-conductivity to liquids. The idea raised considerable objections from the scientific establishment, John Dalton and John Leslie making particularly forthright attacks. Instrumentation far exceeding anything available in terms of accuracy and precision would have been needed to verify Thompson&#x27;s claim. Again, he seems to have been influenced by his theological beliefs and it is likely that he wished to grant water a privileged and providential status in the regulation of human life.

He is considered the founder of the sous-vide food preparation method owing to his experiment with a mutton shoulder. He described this method in one of his essays.

===Mechanical equivalent of heat===
Rumford&#x27;s most important scientific work took place in Munich, and centred on the nature of heat, which he contended in &quot;An Experimental Enquiry Concerning the Source of the Heat which is Excited by Friction&quot; (1798) was not the caloric of then-current scientific thinking but a form of &quot;motion&quot;. Rumford had observed the frictional heat generated by boring cannon at the arsenal in Munich. Rumford immersed a cannon barrel in water and arranged for a specially blunted boring tool. He showed that the water could be boiled within roughly two and a half hours and that the supply of frictional heat was seemingly inexhaustible. Rumford confirmed that no physical change had taken place in the material of the cannon by comparing the specific heats of the material machined away and that remaining.

Rumford argued that the seemingly indefinite generation of heat was incompatible with the caloric theory. He contended that the only thing communicated to the barrel was motion.

Rumford made no attempt to further quantify the heat generated or to measure the mechanical equivalent of heat. Though this work met with a hostile reception, it was subsequently important in establishing the laws of conservation of energy later in the 19th century.

===Calorific and frigorific radiation===
He explained Pictet&#x27;s experiment, which demonstrates the reflection of cold, by supposing that all bodies emit invisible rays, undulations in the ethereal fluid. He did experiments to support his theories of calorific and frigorific radiation and said the communication of heat was the net effect of calorific (hot) rays and frigorific (cold) rays and the rays emitted by the object. When an object absorbs radiation from a warmer object (calorific rays) its temperature rises, and when it absorbs radiation from a colder object (frigorific rays) its temperature falls. See note 8, &quot;An enquiry concerning the nature of heat and the mode of its communication&quot; Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, starting at page 112.

===Inventions and design improvements===

Thompson was an active and prolific inventor, developing improvements for chimneys, fireplaces and industrial furnaces, as well as inventing the double boiler, a kitchen range, and a coffee percolator roughly between 1810 and 1814. He invented a percolating coffee pot following his pioneering work with the Bavarian Army, where he improved the diet of the soldiers as well as their clothes.

The Rumford fireplace created a sensation in London when he introduced the idea of restricting the chimney opening to increase the updraught, which was a much more efficient way to heat a room than earlier fireplaces. He and his workers modified fireplaces by inserting bricks into the hearth to make the side walls angled, and added a choke to the chimney to increase the speed of air going up the flue. The effect was to produce a streamlined air flow, so all the smoke would go up into the chimney rather than lingering and entering the room. It also had the effect of increasing the efficiency of the fire, and gave extra control of the rate of combustion of the fuel, whether wood or coal. Many fashionable London houses were modified to his instructions, and became smoke-free.

Thompson became a celebrity when news of his success spread. His work was also very profitable, and much imitated when he published his analysis of the way chimneys worked. In many ways, he was similar to Benjamin Franklin, who also invented a new kind of heating stove.

The retention of heat was a recurring theme in his work, as he is also credited with the invention of thermal underwear.

===Industrial furnaces===

Thompson also significantly improved the design of kilns used to produce quicklime, and Rumford furnaces were soon being constructed throughout Europe. The key innovation involved separating the burning fuel from the limestone, so that the lime produced by the heat of the furnace was not contaminated by ash from the fire.

===Light and photometry===
Rumford worked in photometry, the measurement of light. He made a photometer and introduced the standard candle, the predecessor of the candela, as a unit of luminous intensity. His standard candle was made from the oil of a sperm whale, to rigid specifications. He also published studies of &quot;illusory&quot; or subjective complementary colours, induced by the shadows created by two lights, one white and one coloured; these observations were cited and generalized by Michel-Eugène Chevreul as his &quot;law of simultaneous colour contrast&quot; in 1839.

==Later life==
After 1799, he divided his time between France and England. With Sir Joseph Banks, he established the Royal Institution of Great Britain in 1799. The pair chose Sir Humphry Davy as the first lecturer. The institution flourished and became world-famous as a result of Davy&#x27;s pioneering research. His assistant, Michael Faraday, established the Institution as a premier research laboratory, and also justly famous for its series of public lectures popularizing science. That tradition continues to the present, and the Royal Institution Christmas lectures attract large audiences through their TV broadcasts.

Thompson endowed the Rumford medals of the Royal Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and endowed the Rumford Chair of Physics at Harvard University. In 1803, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

After several affairs and a close friendship with Mary Temple, Viscountess Palmerston, in 1804, he married Marie-Anne Lavoisier, the widow of the great French chemist Antoine Lavoisier. (His American wife, Sarah—whom he had abandoned at the outbreak of the American Revolution—had died in 1792.) Thompson separated from his second wife after three years, but he settled in Paris and continued his scientific work until his death on 21 August 1814. Thompson is buried in the small cemetery of Auteuil in Paris, just across from Adrien-Marie Legendre. Upon his death, his daughter from his first marriage, Sarah Thompson, inherited his title as Countess Rumford.

He was also known to have been a lover of George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville.

<doc id="174312" wikidata="Q1322529" url="?curid=174312" title="SQL Slammer">
<text>SQL Slammer is a 2003 computer worm that caused a denial of service on some Internet hosts and dramatically slowed general Internet traffic. It also crashed routers around the world, causing even more slowdowns. It spread rapidly, infecting most of its 75,000 victims within 10 minutes.

The program exploited a buffer overflow bug in Microsoft&#x27;s SQL Server and Desktop Engine database products. Although the MS02-039 (CVE-2002-0649) patch had been released six months earlier, many organizations had not yet applied it.

The most infected regions were Europe, North America, and Asia (including East Asia and India).

==Technical details==
The worm was based on proof of concept code demonstrated at the Black Hat Briefings by David Litchfield, who had initially discovered the buffer overflow vulnerability that the worm exploited. It is a small piece of code that does little other than generate random IP addresses and send itself out to those addresses. If a selected address happens to belong to a host that is running an unpatched copy of Microsoft SQL Server Resolution Service listening on UDP port 1434, the host immediately becomes infected and begins spraying the Internet with more copies of the worm program.

Home PCs are generally not vulnerable to this worm unless they have MSDE installed. The worm is so small that it does not contain code to write itself to disk, so it only stays in memory, and it is easy to remove. For example, Symantec provides a free of charge removal utility, or it can even be removed by restarting SQL Server (although the machine would likely be reinfected immediately).

The worm was made possible by a software security vulnerability in SQL Server first reported by Microsoft on 24 July 2002. A patch had been available from Microsoft for six months prior to the worm&#x27;s launch, but many installations had not been patched – including many at Microsoft.

The worm began to be noticed early on 25 January 2003 as it slowed systems worldwide. The slowdown was caused by the collapse of numerous routers under the burden of extremely high bombardment traffic from infected servers. Normally, when traffic is too high for routers to handle, the routers are supposed to delay or temporarily stop network traffic. Instead, some routers &quot;crashed&quot; (became unusable), and the &quot;neighbour&quot; routers would notice that these routers had stopped and should not be contacted (aka &quot;removed from the routing table&quot;). Routers started sending notices to this effect to other routers they knew about. The flood of routing table update notices caused some additional routers to fail, compounding the problem. Eventually the crashed routers&#x27; maintainers restarted them, causing them to announce their status, leading to another wave of routing table updates. Soon a significant portion of Internet bandwidth was consumed by routers communicating with each other to update their routing tables, and ordinary data traffic slowed or in some cases stopped altogether. Because the SQL Slammer worm was so small in size, sometimes it was able to get through when legitimate traffic was not.

Two key aspects contributed to SQL Slammer&#x27;s rapid propagation. The worm infected new hosts over the sessionless UDP protocol, and the entire worm (only 376 bytes) fits inside a single packet. As a result, each infected host could simply &quot;fire and forget&quot; packets as rapidly as possible.

<text>Sir James Chadwick (20 October 1891 – 24 July 1974) was an English physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1935 for his discovery of the neutron. In 1941, he wrote the final draft of the MAUD Report, which inspired the U.S. government to begin serious atom bomb research efforts. He was the head of the British team that worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II. He was knighted in Britain in 1945 for his achievements in physics.

Chadwick graduated from the Victoria University of Manchester in 1911, where he studied under Ernest Rutherford (known as the &quot;father of nuclear physics&quot;). At Manchester, he continued to study under Rutherford until he was awarded his MSc in 1913. The same year, Chadwick was awarded an 1851 Research Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851. He elected to study beta radiation under Hans Geiger in Berlin. Using Geiger&#x27;s recently developed Geiger counter, Chadwick was able to demonstrate that beta radiation produced a continuous spectrum, and not discrete lines as had been thought. Still in Germany when World War I broke out in Europe, he spent the next four years in the Ruhleben internment camp.

After the war, Chadwick followed Rutherford to the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where Chadwick earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree under Rutherford&#x27;s supervision from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in June 1921. He was Rutherford&#x27;s assistant director of research at the Cavendish Laboratory for over a decade at a time when it was one of the world&#x27;s foremost centres for the study of physics, attracting students like John Cockcroft, Norman Feather, and Mark Oliphant. Chadwick followed his discovery of the neutron by measuring its mass. He anticipated that neutrons would become a major weapon in the fight against cancer. Chadwick left the Cavendish Laboratory in 1935 to become a professor of physics at the University of Liverpool, where he overhauled an antiquated laboratory and, by installing a cyclotron, made it an important centre for the study of nuclear physics.

== Education and early life ==
James Chadwick was born in Bollington, Cheshire, on 20 October 1891, the first child of John Joseph Chadwick, a cotton spinner, and Anne Mary Knowles, a domestic servant. He was named James after his paternal grandfather. In 1895, his parents moved to Manchester, leaving him in the care of his maternal grandparents. He went to Bollington Cross Primary School, and was offered a scholarship to Manchester Grammar School, which his family had to turn down as they could not afford the small fees that still had to be paid. Instead he attended the Central Grammar School for Boys in Manchester, rejoining his parents there. He now had two younger brothers, Harry and Hubert; a sister had died in infancy. At the age of 16, he sat two examinations for university scholarships, and won both of them.

Chadwick chose to attend Victoria University of Manchester, which he entered in 1908. He meant to study mathematics, but enrolled in physics by mistake. Like most students, he lived at home, walking the to the university and back each day. At the end of his first year, he was awarded a Heginbottom Scholarship to study physics. The physics department was headed by Ernest Rutherford, who assigned research projects to final-year students, and he instructed Chadwick to devise a means of comparing the amount of radioactive energy of two different sources. The idea was that they could be measured in terms of the activity of of radium, a unit of measurement which would become known as the curie. Rutherford&#x27;s suggested approach was unworkable—something Chadwick knew but was afraid to tell Rutherford—so Chadwick pressed on, and eventually devised the required method. The results became Chadwick&#x27;s first paper, which, co-authored with Rutherford, was published in 1912. He graduated with first class honours in 1911.

Having devised a means of measuring gamma radiation, Chadwick proceeded to measure the absorption of gamma rays by various gases and liquids. This time the resulting paper was published under his name alone. He was awarded his Master of Science (MSc) degree in 1912, and was appointed a Beyer Fellow. The following year he was awarded an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship, which allowed him to study and research at a university in continental Europe. He elected to go to the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt in Berlin in 1913, to study beta radiation under Hans Geiger. Using Geiger&#x27;s recently developed Geiger counter, which provided more accuracy than the earlier photographic techniques, he was able to demonstrate that beta radiation did not produce discrete lines, as has been previously thought, but rather a continuous spectrum with peaks in certain regions. On a visit to Geiger&#x27;s laboratory, Albert Einstein told Chadwick that: &quot;I can explain either of these things, but I can&#x27;t explain them both at the same time.&quot; The continuous spectrum would remain an unexplained phenomenon for many years.

Chadwick was still in Germany at the start of the First World War, and was interned in the Ruhleben internment camp near Berlin, where he was allowed to set up a laboratory in the stables and conduct scientific experiments using improvised materials such as radioactive toothpaste. With the help of Charles Drummond Ellis, he worked on the ionisation of phosphorus, and the photochemical reaction of carbon monoxide and chlorine. He was released after the Armistice with Germany came into effect in November 1918, and returned to his parents&#x27; home in Manchester, where he wrote up his findings over the previous four years for the 1851 Exhibition commissioners.

Rutherford gave Chadwick a part-time teaching position at Manchester, allowing him to continue research. He looked at the nuclear charge of platinum, silver, and copper, and experimentally found that this was the same as the atomic number within an error of less than 1.5 per cent. In April 1919, Rutherford became director of the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, and Chadwick joined him there a few months later. Chadwick was awarded a Clerk-Maxwell studentship in 1920, and enrolled as a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) student at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. The first half of his thesis was his work with atomic numbers. In the second, he looked at the forces inside the nucleus. His degree was awarded in June 1921. In November, he became a Fellow of Gonville and Caius College.

== Researcher ==
=== Cambridge ===
Chadwick&#x27;s Clerk-Maxwell studentship expired in 1923, and he was succeeded by the Russian physicist Pyotr Kapitza. The Chairman of the Advisory Council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Sir William McCormick arranged for Chadwick to become Rutherford&#x27;s assistant director of research. In this role, Chadwick helped Rutherford select PhD students. Over the next few years these would include John Cockcroft, Norman Feather and Mark Oliphant, who would become firm friends with Chadwick. As many students had no idea what they wanted to research, Rutherford and Chadwick would suggest topics. Chadwick edited all the papers produced by the laboratory.
In 1925, Chadwick met Aileen Stewart-Brown, the daughter of a Liverpool stockbroker. The two were married in August 1925, with Kapitza as Best Man. The couple had twin daughters, Joanna and Judith, who were born in February 1927.

In his research, Chadwick continued to probe the nucleus. In 1925, the concept of spin had allowed physicists to explain the Zeeman effect, but it also created unexplained anomalies. At the time it was believed that the nucleus consisted of protons and electrons, so nitrogen&#x27;s nucleus, for example, with a mass number of 14, was assumed to contain 14 protons and 7 electrons. This gave it the right mass and charge, but the wrong spin.

At a conference at Cambridge on beta particles and gamma rays in 1928, Chadwick met Geiger again. Geiger had brought with him a new model of his Geiger counter, which had been improved by his post-doctoral student Walther Müller. Chadwick had not used one since the war, and the new Geiger–Müller counter was potentially a major improvement over the scintillation techniques then in use at Cambridge, which relied on the human eye for observation. The major drawback with it was that it detected alpha, beta and gamma radiation, and radium, which the Cavendish laboratory normally used in its experiments, emitted all three, and was therefore unsuitable for what Chadwick had in mind. However, polonium is an alpha emitter, and Lise Meitner sent Chadwick about 2 millicuries (about ) from Germany.

In Germany, Walther Bothe and his student Herbert Becker had used polonium to bombard beryllium with alpha particles, producing an unusual form of radiation. Chadwick had his Australian 1851 Exhibition scholar, Hugh Webster, duplicate their results. To Chadwick, this was evidence of something that he and Rutherford had been hypothesising for years: the neutron, a theoretical nuclear particle with no electric charge. Then in January 1932, Feather drew Chadwick&#x27;s attention to another surprising result. Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie had succeeded in knocking protons from paraffin wax using polonium and beryllium as a source for what they thought was gamma radiation. Rutherford and Chadwick disagreed; protons were too heavy for that. But neutrons would need only a small amount of energy to achieve the same effect. In Rome, Ettore Majorana came to the same conclusion: the Joliot-Curies had discovered the neutron but did not know it.

Chadwick dropped all his other responsibilities to concentrate on proving the existence of the neutron, assisted by Feather and frequently working late at night. He devised a simple apparatus that consisted of a cylinder containing a polonium source and beryllium target. The resulting radiation could then be directed at a material such as paraffin wax. The displaced particles, which were protons, would go into a small ionisation chamber where they could be detected with an oscilloscope.
In February 1932, after only about two weeks of experimentation with neutrons, Chadwick sent a letter to &quot;Nature&quot; titled &quot;Possible Existence of a Neutron&quot;. He communicated his findings in detail in an article sent to &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society A&quot; titled &quot;The Existence of a Neutron&quot; in May. His discovery of the neutron was a milestone in understanding the nucleus. Reading Chadwick&#x27;s paper, Robert Bacher and Edward Condon realised that anomalies in the then-current theory, like the spin of nitrogen, would be resolved if the neutron has a spin of 1/2 and that a nitrogen nucleus consisted of seven protons and seven neutrons.

The theoretical physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg considered whether the neutron could be a fundamental nuclear particle like the proton and electron, rather than a proton–electron pair. Heisenberg showed that the neutron was best described as a new nuclear particle, but its exact nature remained unclear. In his 1933 Bakerian Lecture, Chadwick estimated that a neutron had a mass of about . Since a proton and an electron had a combined mass of , this implied the neutron as a proton–electron composite had a binding energy of about , which sounded reasonable, although it was hard to understand how a particle with so little binding energy could be stable. Estimating such a small mass difference required challenging precise measurements, however, and several conflicting results were obtained in 1933–4. By bombarding boron with alpha particles, Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie obtained a large value for the mass of a neutron, but Ernest Lawrence&#x27;s team at the University of California produced a small one. Then Maurice Goldhaber, a refugee from Nazi Germany and a graduate student at the Cavendish Laboratory, suggested to Chadwick that deuterons could be photodisintegrated by the 2.6 MeV gamma rays of 208Tl (then known as thorium C&quot;):
An accurate value for the mass of the neutron could be determined from this process. Chadwick and Goldhaber tried this and found that it worked. They measured the kinetic energy of the proton produced as 1.05 MeV, leaving the mass of the neutron as the unknown in the equation. Chadwick and Goldhaber calculated that it was either 1.0084 or 1.0090 atomic units, depending on the values used for the masses of the proton and deuteron. (The modern accepted value for the mass of the neutron is .) The mass of the neutron was too large to be a proton–electron pair.

For his discovery of the neutron, Chadwick was awarded the Hughes Medal by the Royal Society in 1932, the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1935, the Copley Medal in 1950 and the Franklin Medal in 1951. His discovery of the neutron made it possible to produce elements heavier than uranium in the laboratory by the capture of slow neutrons followed by beta decay. Unlike the positively charged alpha particles, which are repelled by the electrical forces present in the nuclei of other atoms, neutrons do not need to overcome any Coulomb barrier, and can therefore penetrate and enter the nuclei of even the heaviest elements such as uranium. This inspired Enrico Fermi to investigate the nuclear reactions brought about by collisions of nuclei with slow neutrons, work for which Fermi would receive the Nobel Prize in 1938.

Wolfgang Pauli proposed another kind of particle on 4 December 1930 to explain the continuous spectrum of beta radiation that Chadwick had reported in 1914. Since not all of the energy of beta radiation could be accounted for, the law of conservation of energy appeared to be violated, but Pauli argued that this could be redressed if another, undiscovered, particle was involved. Pauli also called this particle a neutron, but it was clearly not the same particle as Chadwick&#x27;s neutron. Fermi renamed it the neutrino, Italian for &quot;little neutron&quot;. In 1934, Fermi proposed his theory of beta decay which explained that the electrons emitted from the nucleus were created by the decay of a neutron into a proton, an electron, and a neutrino. The neutrino could account for the missing energy, but a particle with little mass and no electric charge was difficult to observe. Rudolf Peierls and Hans Bethe calculated that neutrinos could easily pass through the Earth, so the chances of detecting them were slim. Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan would confirm the neutrino on 14 June 1956 by placing a detector within a large antineutrino flux from a nearby nuclear reactor.

=== Liverpool ===
With the onset of the Great Depression in the United Kingdom, the government became more parsimonious with funding for science. At the same time, Lawrence&#x27;s recent invention, the cyclotron, promised to revolutionise experimental nuclear physics, and Chadwick felt that the Cavendish laboratory would fall behind unless it also acquired one. He therefore chafed under Rutherford, who clung to the belief that good nuclear physics could still be done without large, expensive equipment, and turned down the request for a cyclotron.
Chadwick was himself a critic of Big Science in general, and Lawrence in particular, whose approach he considered careless and focused on technology at the expense of science. When Lawrence postulated the existence of a new and hitherto unknown particle that he claimed was a possible source of limitless energy at the Solvay Conference in 1933, Chadwick responded that the results were more likely attributable to contamination of the equipment. While Lawrence rechecked his results at Berkeley only to find that Chadwick was correct, Rutherford and Oliphant conducted an investigation at the Cavendish that found that deuterium fuses to form helium-3, thereby causing the effect that Lawrence had observed. This was another major discovery, but the Oliphant-Rutherford particle accelerator was an expensive state-of-the-art piece of equipment.

In March 1935, Chadwick received an offer of the Lyon Jones Chair of physics at the University of Liverpool, in his wife&#x27;s home town, to succeed Lionel Wilberforce. The laboratory was so antiquated that it still ran on direct current electricity, but Chadwick seized the opportunity, assuming the chair on 1 October 1935. The university&#x27;s prestige was soon bolstered by Chadwick&#x27;s Nobel Prize, which was announced in November 1935. His medal was sold at auction in 2014 for $329,000.

Chadwick set about acquiring a cyclotron for Liverpool. He started by spending £700 to refurbish the antiquated laboratories at Liverpool, so some components could be made in-house. He was able to persuade the university to provide £2,000 and obtained a grant for another £2,000 from the Royal Society. To build his cyclotron, Chadwick brought in two young experts, Bernard Kinsey and Harold Walke, who had worked with Lawrence at the University of California. A local cable manufacturer donated the copper conductor for the coils. The cyclotron&#x27;s 50-ton magnet was manufactured in Trafford Park by Metropolitan-Vickers, which also made the vacuum chamber. The cyclotron was completely installed and running in July 1939. The total cost of £5,184 was more than Chadwick had received from the university and the Royal Society, so Chadwick paid the rest from his (£8,243) Nobel Prize money.

At Liverpool the Medicine and Science faculties worked together closely. Chadwick was automatically a committee member of both faculties, and in 1938 he was appointed to a commission headed by Lord Derby to investigate the arrangements for cancer treatment in Liverpool. Chadwick anticipated that neutrons and radioactive isotopes produced with the 37-inch cyclotron could be used to study biochemical processes, and might become a weapon in the fight against cancer.

== Second World War ==
=== Tube Alloys and the MAUD Report ===
During the Second World War, Chadwick carried out research as part of the Tube Alloys project to build an atom bomb, while his Manchester lab and environs were harassed by Luftwaffe bombing. When the Quebec Agreement merged his project with the American Manhattan Project, he became part of the British Mission, and worked at the Los Alamos Laboratory and in Washington, D.C. He surprised everyone by earning the almost-complete trust of project director Leslie R. Groves, Jr. For his efforts, Chadwick received a knighthood in the New Year Honours on 1 January 1945. In July 1945, he viewed the Trinity nuclear test. After this, he served as the British scientific advisor to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. Uncomfortable with the trend toward Big Science, he returned to Cambridge where he became the Master of Gonville and Caius College in 1948. 

In Germany, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann bombarded uranium with neutrons, and noted that barium, a lighter element, was among the products produced. Hitherto, only the same or heavier elements had been produced by the process. In January 1939, Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch astounded the physics community with a paper that explained this result. They theorised that uranium atoms bombarded with neutrons can break into two roughly equal fragments, a process they called fission. They calculated that this would result in the release of about 200 MeV, implying an energy release orders of magnitude greater than chemical reactions, and Frisch confirmed their theory experimentally. It was soon noted by Hahn that if neutrons were released during fission, then a chain reaction was possible. French scientists, Pierre Joliot, Hans von Halban and Lew Kowarski, soon verified that more than one neutron was indeed emitted per fission. In a paper co-authored with the American physicist John Wheeler, Bohr theorised that fission was more likely to occur in the uranium-235 isotope, which made up only 0.7 per cent of natural uranium.
Chadwick did not believe that there was any likelihood of another war with Germany in 1939, and took his family for a holiday on a remote lake in northern Sweden. The news of the outbreak of the Second World War therefore came as a shock. Determined not to spend another war in an internment camp, Chadwick made his way to Stockholm as fast as he could, but when he arrived there with his family, he found that all air traffic between Stockholm and London had been suspended. They made their way back to England on a tramp steamer. When he reached Liverpool, Chadwick found Joseph Rotblat, a Polish post-doctoral fellow who had come to work with the cyclotron, was now destitute, as he was cut off from funds from Poland. Chadwick promptly hired Rotblat as a lecturer, despite his poor grasp of English.

In October 1939, Chadwick received a letter from Sir Edward Appleton, the Secretary of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, asking for his opinion on the feasibility of an atom bomb. Chadwick responded cautiously. He did not dismiss the possibility, but carefully went over the many theoretical and practical difficulties involved. Chadwick decided to investigate the properties of uranium oxide further with Rotblat. In March 1940, Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls at the University of Birmingham re-examined the theoretical issues involved in a paper that became known as the Frisch–Peierls memorandum. Instead of looking at unenriched uranium oxide, they considered what would happen to a sphere of pure uranium-235, and found that not only could a chain reaction occur, but that it might require as little as of uranium-235, and unleash the energy of tons of dynamite.
A special subcommittee of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Warfare (CSSAW), known as the MAUD Committee, was created to investigate the matter further. It was chaired by Sir George Thomson and its original membership included Chadwick, along with Mark Oliphant, John Cockcroft and Philip Moon. While other teams investigated uranium enrichment techniques, Chadwick&#x27;s team at Liverpool concentrated on determining the nuclear cross section of uranium-235. By April 1941, it had been experimentally confirmed that the critical mass of uranium-235 might be or less. His research into such matters was complicated by all-but-incessant Luftwaffe bombings of the environs of his Liverpool lab; the windows were blown out so often that they were replaced by cardboard.

In July 1941, Chadwick was chosen to write the final draft of the MAUD Report, which, when presented by Vannevar Bush to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in October 1941, inspired the U.S. government to pour millions of dollars into the pursuit of an atom bomb. When George B. Pegram and Harold Urey visited Britain to see how the project, now known as Tube Alloys, was going, Chadwick was able to tell them: &quot;I wish I could tell you that the bomb is not going to work, but I am 90 per cent sure that it will.&quot;

In a recent book about the Bomb project, Graham Farmelo wrote that &quot;Chadwick did more than any other scientist to give Churchill the Bomb. ... Chadwick was tested almost to the breaking point.&quot; So worried that he could not sleep, Chadwick resorted to sleeping pills, which he continued to take for most of his remaining years. Chadwick later said that he realised that &quot;a nuclear bomb was not only possible—it was inevitable. Sooner or later these ideas could not be peculiar to us. Everybody would think about them before long, and some country would put them into action&quot;. Sir Hermann Bondi suggested that it was fortunate that Chadwick, not Rutherford, was the doyen of UK physics at the time, as the latter&#x27;s prestige might otherwise have overpowered Chadwick&#x27;s interest in &quot;looking forward&quot; to the Bomb&#x27;s prospects.

=== Manhattan Project ===

Owing to the danger from aerial bombardment, the Chadwicks sent their twins to Canada as part of a government evacuation scheme. Chadwick was reluctant to move Tube Alloys there, believing that the United Kingdom was a better location for the isotope separation plant. The enormous scope of the effort became more apparent in 1942: even a pilot separation plant would cost over £1 million and strain Britain&#x27;s resources, to say nothing of a full-scale plant, which was estimated to cost somewhere in the vicinity of £25 million. It would have to be built in America. At the same time that the British became convinced that a joint project was necessary, the progress of the American Manhattan Project was such that British cooperation seemed less essential, although the Americans were still eager to use Chadwick&#x27;s talents.

The matter of cooperation had to be taken up at the highest level. In September 1943, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and President Roosevelt negotiated the Quebec Agreement, which reinstated cooperation between Britain, the United States and Canada. Chadwick, Oliphant, Peierls and Simon were summoned to the United States by the director of Tube Alloys, Sir Wallace Akers, to work with the Manhattan Project. The Quebec Agreement established a new Combined Policy Committee to direct the joint project. The Americans disliked Akers, so Chadwick was appointed technical advisor to the Combined Policy Committee, and the head of the British Mission.

Leaving Rotblat in charge in Liverpool, Chadwick began a tour of the Manhattan Project facilities in November 1943, except for the Hanford Site where plutonium was produced, which he was not allowed to see. He became the only man, apart from Groves and his second in command, to have access to all the American research and production facilities for the uranium bomb. Observing the work on the K-25 gaseous diffusion facility at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, Chadwick realised how wrong he had been about building the plant in wartime Britain. The enormous structure could never have been concealed from the Luftwaffe. In early 1944, he moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico, with his wife and their twins, who now spoke with Canadian accents. For security reasons, he was given the cover name of James Chaffee.
Chadwick accepted that the Americans did not need British help, but that it could still be useful in bringing the project to an early and successful conclusion. Working closely with the director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., he attempted to do everything he could to support the effort. He also endeavoured to place British scientists in as many parts of the project as possible to facilitate a post-war British nuclear weapons project to which Chadwick was committed. Requests from Groves via Chadwick for particular scientists tended to be met with an immediate rejection by the company, ministry or university currently employing them, only to be overcome by the overriding priority accorded to Tube Alloys. As a result, the British team was critical to the Project&#x27;s success.

Although he had more knowledge of the project than anyone else from Britain, Chadwick had no access to the Hanford site. Lord Portal was offered a tour of Hanford in 1946. &quot;This was the only plant to which Chadwick had been denied access in wartime, and now he asked Groves if he could accompany Portal. Groves replied that he could, but if he did then &#x27;Portal will not see very much&#x27;.&quot; For his efforts, Chadwick received a knighthood in the New Year Honours on 1 January 1945. He considered this to be a recognition of the work of the whole Tube Alloys project.

By early 1945, Chadwick was spending most of his time in Washington, D.C., and his family relocated from Los Alamos to a house on Washington&#x27;s Dupont Circle in April 1945. He was present at the meeting of the Combined Policy Committee on 4 July when Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson gave Britain&#x27;s agreement to use the atom bomb against Japan, and at the Trinity nuclear test on 16 July, when the first atom bomb was detonated. Inside its pit was a polonium-beryllium modulated neutron initiator, a development of the technique that Chadwick had used to discover the neutron over a decade before. William L. Laurence, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter attached to the Manhattan Project, wrote that &quot;never before in history had any man lived to see his own discovery materialize itself with such telling effect on the destiny of man.&quot;

== Later life ==
Shortly after the war ended, Chadwick was appointed to the Advisory Committee on Atomic Energy (ACAE). He was also appointed as the British scientific advisor to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. He clashed with fellow ACAE member Patrick Blackett, who disagreed with Chadwick&#x27;s conviction that Britain needed to acquire its own nuclear weapons; but it was Chadwick&#x27;s position that was ultimately adopted. He returned to Britain in 1946, to find a country still beset by wartime rationing and shortages.

At this time, Sir James Mountford, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Liverpool, wrote in his diary &quot;he had never seen a man &#x27;so physically, mentally and spiritually tired&quot; as Chadwick, for he &quot;had plumbed such depths of moral decision as more fortunate men are never called upon even to peer into ... [and suffered] ... almost insupportable agonies of responsibility arising from his scientific work&#x27;.&quot;

In 1948, Chadwick accepted an offer to become the Master of Gonville and Caius College. The job was prestigious but ill-defined; the Master was the titular head of the college, but authority actually resided in a council of 13 fellows, of whom one was the Master. As Master, Chadwick strove to improve the academic reputation of the college. He increased the number of research fellowships from 31 to 49, and sought to bring talent into the college. This involved controversial decisions, such as hiring in 1951 the Chinese biochemist Tien-chin Tsao and the Hungarian-born economist Peter Bauer. In what became known as the Peasants&#x27; Revolt, fellows led by Patrick Hadley voted an old friend of Chadwick&#x27;s off the council and replaced him with Bauer. More friends of Chadwick&#x27;s were removed over the following years, and he retired in November 1958. It was during his mastership that Francis Crick, a PhD student at Gonville and Caius College, and James Watson discovered the structure of DNA.

By the 1970s Chadwick became more frail, and seldom left his flat, although he travelled to Liverpool for celebrations of his eightieth birthday. A lifelong atheist, he saw no reason to adopt religious faith in later life. He died in his sleep on 24 July 1974.

<doc id="174317" wikidata="Q1374647" url="?curid=174317" title="Tony Jackson (pianist)">
<text>Antonio Junius &quot;Tony&quot; Jackson (October 25, 1882 – April 20, 1921) was an American pianist, singer, and composer.

==Early life==
Jackson was born to a poor African American family in Uptown New Orleans, Louisiana on October 25, 1882. While some sources claim birth dates back to 1876, and a June 5 date, this was likely an error made by his sister Luvina in a later interview, when she appears to have quoted their sister Ida&#x27;s birth information. Tony did not appear in the 1880 Federal census unlike his older sisters. He was born a twin, along with Prince Albert Jackson, who died in New Orleans on January 5, 1884, at fourteen months of age, further reinforcing the October 1882 birth date as correct. The 1900 Federal census further reinforces the year and month of birth as October 1882, and his 1918 draft record shows a birth date of October 25, although the year reads 1884. His parents were freed slaves. Jackson was epileptic from birth.

Tony showed musical talents at a young age. At about the age of 10 he reportedly constructed a type of crude but working and properly tuned harpsichord out of junk in his back yard, since his family lacked the money to buy or rent a piano. On this contraption young Tony was able to reproduce hymns he heard in church; news of this accomplishment soon spread around the neighborhood and he was offered use of neighbors&#x27; pianos and reed organs to practice on. Jackson got his first musical job at age 13, when he began playing piano during off hours at a Tonk run by bandleader Adam Olivier.

==Career==

Jackson became the most popular and sought after entertainer in Storyville. He was said to be able to remember and play any tune he had heard once, and was hardly ever stumped by obscure requests. His repertory included ragtime, cakewalks (one of his show stopping tricks was to dance a high kicking cakewalk while playing the piano), popular songs of the day from the United States and various nations of Europe and Latin America, blues, and light classics. He was also &quot;openly, almost defiantly homosexual.&quot; After hours, he would go with friends to The Frenchman&#x27;s saloon, which catered to musicians and cross-dressers.

His singing voice was also exceptional, and he was said to be able to sing operatic parts from baritone to soprano range. Fellow musicians and singers were universal in their praise of Jackson, most calling him &quot;the greatest&quot;, and even the far-from-modest Jelly Roll Morton ranked Jackson as the only musician better than Morton himself. Morton met Jackson in 1906. Jackson became a mentor to Morton. Jackson also wrote many original tunes, a number of which he sold rights to for a few dollars or were simply stolen from him; some of the old time New Orleans musicians said that some well known Tin Pan Alley pop tunes of the era were actually written by Jackson.

Clarence Williams noted &quot;He was great because he was original in all his improvisations... We all copied him.&quot; More than Jackson&#x27;s music was copied: he was always well dressed. Jackson dressed himself with a pearl gray derby, checkered vest, ascot tie with a diamond stickpin, with sleeve garters on his arms to hold up his cuffs as he played. This became a standard outfit for ragtime and barrelhouse pianists; as one commented &quot;If you can&#x27;t play like Tony Jackson, at least you can look like him&quot;.

==Later career and death==
Jackson moved to Chicago hoping to have more of an influence on his career. He was also looking for more freedom in his personal life, since being gay was difficult in New Orleans. He lived in an apartment on Wabash Avenue with several members of his family and later they all moved to South State Street.

One of the few tunes published with Jackson&#x27;s name on it, &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; came out in 1916, although he was remembered performing the song before he left New Orleans and may have written it in 1911. The original lyrics of &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; were said to refer to his male lover of the time. The song inspired the 1978 eponymous film by Louis Malle.

Jackson was resident performer at the De Luxe and Pekin Cafes in Chicago, although in his later years, his voice and dexterity were impaired by disease. Although it has been cited by some as syphilis, the diagnosis at the time of his death was the more likely cirrhosis of the liver which had been progressing for years, in addition to chronic epilepsy. His friends knew that his health was poor and they held a benefit for him on February 17, 1921, calling it the &quot;All Star Tony Jackson Testimonial&quot; and raising $325 for Jackson. He died in Chicago on April 20, 1921.

Jackson&#x27;s piano rolls can still be heard today and portions of his style are no doubt found in the recordings of younger musicians he influenced, like Jelly Roll Morton, Clarence Williams, and Steve Lewis. In 2011, the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame inducted Jackson into the hall. Jackson was honored for his musical contributions and for living &quot;as an openly gay man when that was rare&quot;.

== Fictional portrayals ==
The play &quot;Don&#x27;t You Leave Me Here&quot; by Clare Brown, which premiered at West Yorkshire Playhouse in September 2008, deals with his relationship with Jelly Roll Morton.

Jackson appears as a minor character in David Fulmer&#x27;s Storyville novel &quot;Chasing the Devil&#x27;s Tail.&quot;

<text>United Artists (UA) is an American film production and distribution company owned by Amazon MGM Studios. In its original operating period, it was founded in February 1919 by Charlie Chaplin, D.W. Griffith, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks as a venture premised on allowing actors to control their own financial and artistic interests rather than being dependent upon commercial studios.

After numerous ownership and structural changes and revamps, United Artists was acquired by media conglomerate Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1981 for a reported $350 million ($ billion today). On September 22, 2014, MGM acquired a controlling interest in One Three Media and Lightworkers Media and merged them to revive the television production unit of United Artists as [[United Artists Media Group]] (UAMG). MGM itself acquired UAMG on December 14, 2015, and folded it into their own television division.

MGM briefly revived the United Artists brand as United Artists Digital Studios for the &quot;Stargate Origins&quot; web series as part of its &quot;Stargate&quot; franchise, but retired the name after 2019 and instead used its eponymous brand for subsequent releases.

A local joint distribution venture between MGM and Annapurna Pictures launched on October 31, 2017 was rebranded as United Artists Releasing on February 5, 2019, in honor of its 100th anniversary. However, Amazon, MGM&#x27;s now-parent company, folded UAR into MGM on March 4, 2023, citing &quot;newfound theatrical release opportunities&quot; following the box-office opening success of &quot;Creed III&quot;.

In July 2024, Amazon MGM Studios announced the company&#x27;s revival, entering a multi-year first look deal with film producer Scott Stuber, who will also be involved with all releases under the freshly revived banner.

==History==

===Early years===
In 1918, Charlie Chaplin could not get his parent company First National Pictures to increase his production budget despite being one of their top producers. Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks had their own contracts, with First National and Famous Players–Lasky respectively, but these were due to run out with no clear offers forthcoming. Sydney Chaplin, brother and business manager for Charlie, deduced something was going wrong, and contacted Pickford and Fairbanks. Together they hired a private detective, who discovered a plan to merge all production companies and to lock in &quot;exhibition companies&quot; to a series of five-year contracts.

Chaplin, Pickford, Fairbanks, and D. W. Griffith incorporated United Artists as a joint venture company on February 5, 1919. Each held a 25 percent stake in the preferred shares and a 20 percent stake in the common shares of the joint venture, with the remaining 20 percent of common shares held by lawyer and advisor William Gibbs McAdoo. The idea for the venture originated with Fairbanks, Chaplin, Pickford and cowboy star William S. Hart a year earlier. Already Hollywood veterans, the four stars talked of forming their own company to better control their own work.

They were spurred on by established Hollywood producers and distributors who were tightening their control over actor salaries and creative decisions, a process that evolved into the studio system. With the addition of Griffith, planning began, but Hart bowed out before anything was formalized. When he heard about their scheme, Richard A. Rowland, head of Metro Pictures, apparently said, &quot;The inmates are taking over the asylum.&quot; The four partners, with advice from McAdoo (son-in-law and former Treasury Secretary of then-President Woodrow Wilson), formed their distribution company. Hiram Abrams was its first managing director, and the company established its headquarters at 729 Seventh Avenue in New York City.

The original terms called for each star to produce five pictures a year. By the time the company was operational in 1921, feature films were becoming more expensive and polished, and running times had settled at around ninety minutes (eight reels). The original goal was thus abandoned.

UA&#x27;s first production, &quot;His Majesty, the American&quot;, written by and starring Fairbanks, was a success. Funding for movies was limited. Without selling stock to the public like other studios, all United had for finance was weekly prepayment installments from theater owners for upcoming movies. As a result, production was slow, and the company distributed an average of only five films a year in its first five years.

By 1924, Griffith had dropped out, and the company was facing a crisis. Veteran producer Joseph Schenck was hired as president. He had produced pictures for a decade, and brought commitments for films starring his wife, Norma Talmadge, his sister-in-law, Constance Talmadge, and his brother-in-law, Buster Keaton. Contracts were signed with independent producers, including Samuel Goldwyn, and Howard Hughes. In 1933, Schenck organized a new company with Darryl F. Zanuck, called Twentieth Century Pictures, which soon provided four pictures a year, forming half of UA&#x27;s schedule.

Schenck formed a separate partnership with Pickford and Chaplin to buy and build theaters under the United Artists name. They began international operations, first in Canada, and then in Mexico. By the end of the 1930s, United Artists was represented in over 40 countries.

When he was denied an ownership share in 1935, Schenck resigned. He set up 20th Century Pictures&#x27; merger with Fox Film Corporation to form 20th Century Fox. Al Lichtman succeeded Schenck as company president. Other independent producers distributed through United Artists in the 1930s including Walt Disney Productions, Alexander Korda, Hal Roach, David O. Selznick, and Walter Wanger. As the years passed, and the dynamics of the business changed, these &quot;producing partners&quot; drifted away. Samuel Goldwyn Productions and Disney went to RKO and Wanger to Universal Pictures.

In the late 1930s, UA turned a profit. Goldwyn was providing most of the output for distribution. He sued United several times for disputed compensation leading him to leave. MGM&#x27;s 1939 hit &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; was supposed to be a UA release except that Selznick wanted Clark Gable, who was under contract to MGM, to play Rhett Butler. Also that year, Fairbanks died.

UA became embroiled in lawsuits with Selznick over his distribution of some films through RKO. Selznick considered UA&#x27;s operation sloppy, and left to start his own distribution arm.

In the 1940s, United Artists was losing money because of poorly received pictures. Cinema attendance continued to decline as television became more popular. The company sold its Mexican releasing division to Crédito Cinematográfico Mexicano, a local company.

===Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers (1940s and 1950s)===
In 1941, Pickford, Chaplin, Disney, Orson Welles, Goldwyn, Selznick, Alexander Korda, and Wanger—many of whom were members of United Artists—formed the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers (SIMPP). Later members included Hunt Stromberg, William Cagney, Sol Lesser, and Hal Roach.

The Society aimed to advance the interests of independent producers in an industry controlled by the studio system. SIMPP fought to end what were considered to be anti-competitive practices by the seven major film studios—Loew&#x27;s (MGM), Columbia Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures, RKO Radio Pictures, 20th Century Fox, and Warner Bros./First National—that controlled the production, distribution, and exhibition of motion pictures.

In 1942, SIMPP filed an antitrust suit against Paramount&#x27;s United Detroit Theatres. The complaint accused Paramount of conspiracy to control first-and subsequent-run theaters in Detroit. This was the first antitrust suit brought by producers against exhibitors that alleged monopoly and restraint of trade. In 1948, the U.S. Supreme Court Paramount Decision ordered the major Hollywood movie studios to sell their theater chains and to end certain anti-competitive practices. This court ruling ended the studio system.

By 1958, SIMPP had achieved many of the goals that led to its creation, and the group ceased operations.

===Krim and Benjamin===
Needing a turnaround, Pickford and Chaplin hired Paul V. McNutt in 1950, a former governor of Indiana, as chairman and Frank L. McNamee as president. McNutt did not have the skill to solve UA&#x27;s financial problems and the pair was replaced after only a few months.

On February 15, 1951, lawyers-turned-producers Arthur B. Krim (of Eagle-Lion Films), Robert Benjamin and Matty Fox approached Pickford and Chaplin with a wild idea: let them take over United Artists for ten years. If UA was profitable in one of the next three years, they would have the option to acquire half the company by the end of the ten years and take full control. Fox Film Corporation president Spyros Skouras extended United Artists a $3 million loan through Krim and Benjamin&#x27;s efforts.

In taking over UA, Krim and Benjamin created the first studio without an actual &quot;studio&quot;. Primarily acting as bankers, they offered money to independent producers. UA leased space at the Pickford/Fairbanks Studio but did not own a studio lot. Thus UA did not have the overhead, the maintenance, or the expensive production staff at other studios.

Among their first clients were Sam Spiegel and John Huston, whose Horizon Productions gave UA one major hit, &quot;The African Queen&quot; (1951) and a substantial success, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; (1952). As well as &quot;The African Queen&quot; UA also had success with &quot;High Noon&quot; in their first year, earning a profit of $313,000 compared to a loss of $871,000 the previous year. Other clients followed, among them Stanley Kramer, Otto Preminger, Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions, and actors newly freed from studio contracts and seeking to produce or direct their own films.

With the instability in the film industry due to theater divestment, the business was considered risky. In 1955, movie attendance reached its lowest level since 1923. Chaplin sold his 25 percent share during this crisis to Krim and Benjamin for $1.1 million, followed a year later by Pickford who sold her share for $3 million.

In the late 1950s, United Artists produced two modest films that became financial and critical successes for the company. The company made &quot;Marty&quot; which won 1955&#x27;s Palme d&#x27;Or and Best Picture Oscar. &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; (1957) which according to Krim before home video, was being seen on TV 24 hours a day, 365 days a year some place in the world. By 1958, UA was making annual profits of $3 million a year.

===Public company===
United Artists went public in 1957 with a $17 million stock and debenture offering. The company was averaging 50 films a year. In 1958, UA acquired Ilya Lopert&#x27;s Lopert Pictures Corporation, which released foreign films that attracted criticism or had censorship problems.

In 1957, UA created United Artists Records Corporation and United Artists Music Corporation after an unsuccessful attempt to buy a record company. In 1968, UA Records merged with Liberty Records, along with its many subsidiary labels such as Imperial Records and Dolton Records. In 1972, the group was consolidated into one entity as United Artists Records and in 1979, EMI acquired the division which included Blue Note Records.

In 1959, after failing to sell several pilots, United Artists offered its first ever television series, &quot;The Troubleshooters&quot;, and later released its first sitcom, &quot;The Dennis O&#x27;Keefe Show&quot;.

In the 1960s, mainstream studios fell into decline and some were acquired or diversified. UA prospered while winning 11 Academy Awards, including five for Best Picture, adding relationships with the Mirisch brothers, Billy Wilder, Joseph E. Levine and others. In 1961, United Artists released &quot;West Side Story&quot;, which won ten Academy Awards (including Best Picture).

In 1960, UA purchased Ziv Television Programs. UA&#x27;s television division was responsible for shows such as &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island,&quot; &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;Outer Limits&quot;, and &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot;. The television unit had begun to build up a profitable rental library, including Associated Artists Productions, owners of Warner Bros. pre-1950 features, shorts and cartoons and 231 &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoon shorts purchased from Paramount Pictures in 1958, becoming United Artists Associated, its distribution division.

In 1963, UA released two Stanley Kramer films, &quot;It&#x27;s A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; and &quot;A Child Is Waiting&quot;. In 1964, UA introduced U.S. film audiences to the Beatles by releasing &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964) and &quot;Help!&quot; (1965).

At the same time, it backed two expatriate North Americans in Britain, who had acquired screen rights to Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond novels. For $1 million, UA backed Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli&#x27;s &quot;Dr. No&quot; in 1963 and launched the James Bond franchise. The franchise outlived UA&#x27;s time as a major studio, continuing half a century later. Other successful projects backed in this period included the &quot;Pink Panther&quot; series, which began in 1964, and Spaghetti Westerns, which made a star of Clint Eastwood in the films of &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;, &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; and &quot;The Good, The Bad and The Ugly&quot;.

In 1964, the French subsidiary, Les Productions Artistes Associés, released its first production &quot;That Man from Rio&quot;.

In 1965, UA released the anticipated George Stevens&#x27; production of &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; and was at the time, the most expensive film which was budgeted at $20 million. Max Von Sydow, in the role of Jesus Christ, led an all-star cast which included Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowell, Martin Landau, Dorothy McGuire, Sal Mineo, Ina Balin, Joanna Dunham, David McCallum, Nehemiah Persoff, Donald Pleasence, José Ferrer and Ed Wynn. The film did not make back its budget and was released to mixed critical receptions. But it has since been acclaimed as a classic by audiences around the world for being admirably inspired in its attempt to be faithful to the four books of the New Testament in the Holy Bible as well as the book of the same name by Fulton Oursler and the radio program which ran from 1947 to 1956. &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; received five Academy Award nominations in 1965 and was also listed among the &quot;Top 10 Films of the Year&quot; by the National Board of Review.

===Transamerica subsidiary===

On the basis of its film and television hits, in 1967, Transamerica Corporation purchased 98 percent of UA&#x27;s stock. Transamerica selected David and Arnold Picker to lead its studio. UA debuted a new logo incorporating the parent company&#x27;s striped T emblem and the tagline &quot;Entertainment from Transamerica Corporation&quot;. This wording was later shortened to &quot;A Transamerica Company&quot;. The following year, in 1968, United Artists Associated was reincorporated as United Artists Television Distribution. In 1970, UA lost $35 million, and the Pickers were pushed aside for the return of Krim and Benjamin.

UA released another Best Picture Oscar winner in 1967, &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; and a nominee for Best Picture, &quot;The Graduate&quot;, an Embassy production that UA distributed overseas.

Other successful pictures included the 1971 screen version of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. However, the 1972 film version of &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; was a failure. New talent was encouraged, including Woody Allen, Robert Altman, Sylvester Stallone, Saul Zaentz, Miloš Forman, and Brian De Palma. With UA being the distributor for Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Bananas&quot; (1971), it started as the distributor for a series of Woody Allen films. With the James Bond, Pink Panther, and Woody Allen films, UA had a series of films based on well known characters in the 1970s.

In 1973, United Artists took over the sales and distribution of MGM&#x27;s films in Anglo-America. Cinema International Corporation assumed international distribution rights for MGM&#x27;s films and carried on to United International Pictures (made from CIC and UA&#x27;s International assets being owned by partner MGM) in the 1980s. As part of the deal, UA acquired MGM&#x27;s music publishing operation, Robbins, Feist, Miller.

In 1975, Harry Saltzman sold UA his 50 percent stake in Danjaq, the holding-company for the Bond films.

UA released &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; in 1975, which won the Best Picture Academy Award and was UA&#x27;s highest-grossing film, with a gross of $163 million. UA followed with the next two years&#x27; Best Picture Oscar winners, &quot;Rocky&quot; and &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, becoming the first studio to win the award for three years running and also to become the studio with the most Best Picture winners at that time, with 11.

However, Transamerica was not pleased with UA&#x27;s releases such as &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; and &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; that were rated X by the Motion Picture Association of America. In these instances, Transamerica demanded the byline &quot;A Transamerica Company&quot; be removed on the prints and in all advertising. At one point, the parent company expressed its desire to phase out the UA name and replace it with Transamerica Films. Krim tried to convince Transamerica to spin off United Artists, but he and Transamerica&#x27;s chairman could not come to an agreement. Finally in 1978, following a dispute with Transamerica chief John R. Beckett over administrative expenses, UA&#x27;s top executives, including chairman Krim, president Eric Pleskow, Benjamin and other key officers walked out. Within days they announced the formation of Orion Pictures, with backing from Warner Bros. The departures concerned several Hollywood figures enough that they took out an ad in a trade paper warning Transamerica that it had made a fatal mistake in letting them go. Later that year, it entered into a partnership with Lorimar Productions, whereas United Artists would distribute Lorimar&#x27;s feature films theatrically, while Lorimar was planning to produce television series and miniseries adaptations from UA&#x27;s feature film library.

Transamerica inserted Andy Albeck as UA&#x27;s president. United had its most successful year with four hits in 1979: &quot;Rocky II&quot;, &quot;Manhattan&quot;, &quot;Moonraker&quot;, and &quot;The Black Stallion&quot;.

The new leadership agreed to back &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, a project of director Michael Cimino, which vastly overran its budget and cost $44 million. This led to the resignation of Albeck, who was replaced by Norbert Auerbach. United Artists recorded a major loss for the year due almost entirely to the box-office failure of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;. It destroyed UA&#x27;s reputation with Transamerica and the greater Hollywood community. However, it may have saved the United Artists name; UA&#x27;s final head before the sale, Steven Bach, wrote in his book &quot;Final Cut&quot; that there had been talk about renaming United Artists to Transamerica Pictures.

In 1980, Transamerica decided to exit the film making business, and put United Artists on the market. Kirk Kerkorian&#x27;s Tracinda Corp. purchased the company in 1981. Tracinda also owned Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

====United Artists Classics====
In 1981, United Artists Classics, which formerly re-released library titles, was turned into a first-run art film distributor by Nathaniel T. Kwit, Jr. Tom Bernard was hired as the division director, as well as handling theatrical sales, and Ira Deutchman was hired as head of marketing. Later the division added Michael Barker and Donna Gigliotti. Deutchman left to form Cinecom, and Barker and Bernard formed Orion Classics and Sony Pictures Classics. The label mostly released foreign and independent films such as &quot;Cutter&#x27;s Way&quot;, &quot;Ticket to Heaven&quot; and &quot;The Grey Fox&quot;, and occasional first-run reissues from the UA library, such as director&#x27;s cuts of &quot;Head Over Heels&quot;. When Barker and Bernard left to form Orion Classics, the label was briefly rechristened in 1984 as MGM/UA Classics before it ceased operating in the late 1980s.
===MGM/UA Entertainment Company===
The merged studios became known as the MGM/UA Entertainment Company and in 1982 began launching new subsidiaries: the MGM/UA Home Entertainment Group, MGM/UA Classics and MGM/UA Television Group. Kerkorian also bid for the remaining, outstanding public stock, but dropped his bid, facing lawsuits and vocal opposition.

In 1981, Fred Silverman and George Reeves via InterMedia Entertainment struck a deal with the studio to produce films and TV shows.

After the purchase, David Begelman&#x27;s duties were transferred from MGM to MGM/UA. Under Begelman, MGM/UA produced unsuccessful films and he was fired in July 1982. Of the 11 films he put into production, by the time of his termination only &quot;Poltergeist&quot; proved to be a hit.

As part of the consolidation, in 1983, MGM closed United Artists&#x27; long time headquarters at 729 Seventh Avenue in New York City. MGM/UA sold the former UA music publishing division to CBS Songs in 1983.

&quot;WarGames&quot; and &quot;Octopussy&quot; made substantial profits for the new MGM/UA in 1983, but were not sufficient for Kerkorian. It did not help tha&quot;t WarGames&quot; was briefly caught in a legal dispute with EMI Films concerning the film&#x27;s funding and international rights. A 1985-restructuring led to independent MGM and UA production units with the combined studio leaders each placed in charge of a single unit. Speculation from analysts was that one of the studios, most likely UA, would be sold to fund the other&#x27;s (MGM) stock buy-back to take that studio private. However, soon afterwards, one unit&#x27;s chief was fired and the remaining executive, Alan Ladd, Jr., took charge of both.

====Turner====
On August 7, 1985, Ted Turner announced that his Turner Broadcasting System would buy MGM/UA. As film licensing to television became more complicated, Turner saw the value of acquiring MGM&#x27;s film library for his superstation WTBS. Under the terms of the deal, Turner would immediately sell United Artists back to Kerkorian.

In anticipation, Kerkorian installed film producer Jerry Weintraub as the chairman and chief executive of United Artists Corporation in November 1985; former ABC executive Anthony Thomopoulos was recruited as UA&#x27;s president. Weintraub&#x27;s tenure at UA was brief; he left the studio in April 1986, replaced by former Lorimar executive Lee Rich. In anticipation, during the split, SLM Production Group moved its distribution deal to United Artists, after having left MGM/UA temporarily for 20th Century Fox.

On March 25, 1986, Turner finalized his acquisition of MGM/UA in a cash-stock deal for $1.5 billion and renamed it MGM Entertainment Co. Kerkorian then repurchased most of United Artists&#x27; assets for roughly $480 million. As a result of this transaction, the original United Artists ceased to exist. Kerkorian, for all intents and purposes, created an entirely new company implementing the inherited assets; thus, the present day UA is not the legal successor to the original incarnation, though it shares similar assets. United Artists announced plans to launch its new headquarters on Beverly Hills, which was set to take effect on November 1, 1985, shortly before the Turner deal was finalized. On April 23, 1986, United Artists and Hoyts, the Australian cinema chain and distribution company, signed a three-picture deal to co-produce films.

===MGM/UA Communications Company===

Due to financial community concerns over his debt load, Ted Turner was forced to sell MGM&#x27;s production and distribution assets to United Artists for $300 million on August 26, 1986. The MGM lot and lab facilities were sold to Lorimar-Telepictures. Turner kept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television library, along with the Associated Artists Productions library, and the RKO Pictures films that United Artists had previously purchased. On August 21, 1986, United Artists announced its re-entry into film production; &quot;Baby Boom&quot; and &quot;Real Men&quot; were the first new films to commence production, with a slate of 26 films to follow in development.

United Artists was renamed MGM/UA Communications Company and organized into three main units: one television production and two film units. David Gerber headed up the television unit with Anthony Thomopoulous at United Artists, and Alan Ladd, Jr. at MGM. Despite a resurgence at the box office in 1987 with &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, and &quot;Moonstruck&quot;, MGM/UA lost $88 million. That November, Hoyts and United Artists decided to end their co-production partnership.

In April 1988, Kerkorian&#x27;s 82 percent of MGM/UA was up for sale; MGM and UA were split by July. Eventually, 25 percent of MGM was offered to Burt Sugarman, and producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber, but the plan later fell through. Rich, Ladd, Thomopoulous and other executives grew tired of Kerkorian&#x27;s antics and began to leave. By summer 1988, the mass exodus of executives started to affect productions, with many film cancellations. The 1989 sale of MGM/UA to the Australian company Qintex/Australian Television Network (owners of the Hal Roach library, which both MGM and United Artists had distributed in the 1930s) also fell through, due to the company&#x27;s bankruptcy later that year; Ted Turner attempted to buy the assets again but failed. UA was essentially dormant after 1990 and released no films for several years.

===The 1990s===
In November 1990, Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti purchased MGM/UA. He&#x27;d previously purchased Cannon Films and renamed it Pathé Communications, anticipating a successful purchase of Pathé, the famed French film company. But his attempt failed – largely from the French government looking into Parretti&#x27;s shady past – and instead he merged MGM/UA with his former company, resulting in MGM-Pathé Communications Co. During the transaction, Parretti overstated his own financial condition and obtained a loan under false pretenses; this was a harbinger of the chaos the studio fell into under his ownership. Debts went unpaid, forcing the delay of several films, as Parretti looted the company, fired most of the financial staff and feuded with Alan Ladd Jr. over control. To prevent any further damage (and in part to prevent their own financial misdeeds from coming to light), Crédit Lyonnais, Parretti&#x27;s primary lender, foreclosed on the studio in 1992. This resulted in Parretti defaulting on his loans and subsequently being convicted of securities fraud. On July 2, 1992, MGM-Pathé Communications was again named Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. In an effort to make MGM/UA saleable, Credit Lyonnais ramped up production and convinced John Calley to run UA. Under his supervision, Calley revived the &quot;Pink Panther&quot; and &quot;James Bond&quot; franchises and highlighted UA&#x27;s past by giving the widest release ever to a film with an NC-17 rating, &quot;Showgirls&quot;. Credit Lyonnais sold MGM in 1996, again to Kirk Kerkorian&#x27;s Tracinda, leading to Calley&#x27;s departure.

In 1999, filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola attempted to buy UA from Kerkorian who rejected the offer. Coppola signed a production deal with the studio instead.

===The 2000s to the 2020s===

In 1999, UA was re-positioned as a specialty studio. MGM had just acquired The Samuel Goldwyn Company, which had been a leading distributor of arthouse films. After that name was retired, MGM folded UA into Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures. G2 Films, the renamed Goldwyn Company and MGM&#x27;s specialty London operations, was renamed United Artists International. The distributorship, branding, and copyrights for two of UA&#x27;s main franchises (&quot;Pink Panther&quot;, and &quot;Rocky&quot;) were moved to MGM, although select MGM releases (notably the James Bond franchise co-held with Danjaq, LLC and the &quot;Amityville Horror&quot; remake) carry a United Artists copyright. The first arthouse film to bear the UA name was &quot;Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her&quot;.

United Artists hired Bingham Ray to run the company on September 1, 2001. Under his supervision, the company produced and distributed many art films, including &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;, 2002&#x27;s &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;, and the winner of that year&#x27;s Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;; and 2004&#x27;s &quot;Undertow&quot;, and &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot;, a co-production of UA and Lions Gate Entertainment, and made deals with companies like American Zoetrope and Revolution Films. Ray stepped down from the company in 2004.

In 2005, a partnership of Comcast, Sony and several merchant banks bought United Artists and its parent, MGM, for $4.8 billion. Though only a minority investor, Sony closed MGM&#x27;s distribution system and folded most of its staff into its own studio. The movies UA had completed and planned for release—&quot;Capote&quot;, &quot;Art School Confidential&quot;, &quot;The Woods&quot;, and &quot;Romance and Cigarettes&quot; —were reassigned to Sony Pictures Classics.

In March 2006, MGM announced that it would return again as a domestic distribution company. Striking distribution deals with The Weinstein Company (TWC), Lakeshore Entertainment, Bauer Martinez Entertainment, and other independent studios, MGM distributed films from these companies. MGM continued funding and co-producing projects released in conjunction with Sony&#x27;s Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group on a limited basis and produced tent-poles for its own distribution company, MGM Distribution.

Sony had a minority stake in MGM, but otherwise MGM and UA operated under the direction of Stephen Cooper (CEO and minority owner of MGM).

====United Artists Entertainment====
On November 2, 2006, MGM announced that Tom Cruise and his long-time production partner Paula Wagner were resurrecting UA. This announcement came after the duo were released from a fourteen-year production relationship at Viacom-owned Paramount Pictures. Cruise, Wagner and MGM Studios created United Artists Entertainment LLC and the producer/actor and his partner owned a 30 percent stake in the studio, with the approval by MGM&#x27;s consortium of owners. The deal gave them control over production and development. Wagner was named CEO, and was allotted an annual slate of four films with varying budget ranges, while Cruise served as a producer for the revamped studio and the occasional star.

UA became the first motion picture studio granted a Writers Guild of America, West (WGA) waiver in January 2008 during the Writers&#x27; Strike.

On August 14, 2008, MGM announced that Wagner would leave UA to produce films independently. Her output as head of UA was two films, both starring Cruise, &quot;Lions for Lambs&quot; and &quot;Valkyrie&quot;. Wagner&#x27;s departure led to speculation that a UA overhaul was imminent.

Since then, UA has served as a co-producer with MGM for two releases: the 2009 remake of &quot;Fame&quot; and &quot;Hot Tub Time Machine&quot;—these are the last original films to date to bear the UA banner.

A 2011 financial report revealed that MGM reacquired its 100 percent stake in United Artists. MGM stated that it might continue to make new films under the UA brand. Currently, however, UA itself functions in-name-only, although it occasionally re-releases (via MGM) most of its films theatrically under the UA banner.

====United Artists Media Group and United Artists Digital Studios====
On September 22, 2014, MGM acquired a 55 percent interest in One Three Media and Lightworkers Media, both operated by Mark Burnett and Roma Downey and partly owned by Hearst Entertainment. The two companies were consolidated into a new television company, United Artists Media Group (UAMG), a revival of the UA brand. Burnett became UAMG&#x27;s CEO and Downey became president of Lightworkers Media, the UAMG family and faith division. UAMG became the distributing studio for Mark Burnett Productions programming such as &quot;Survivor&quot;. UAMG was to form an over-the-top faith-based channel.

On December 14, 2015, MGM announced that it had acquired the remaining 45 percent stake of UAMG it did not already own and folded UAMG into its own television division. Hearst, Downey and Burnett received stakes in MGM collectively valued at $233 million. Additionally, Burnett was promoted to president for MGM Television, replacing the outgoing Roma Khanna. The planned over-the-top faith service (later to be branded as a combined OTT/digital subchannel service known as &quot;Light TV&quot;, now the TheGrio) became a separate entity owned by MGM, Burnett, Downey and Hearst.

On August 14, 2018, The Hollywood Reporter reported that MGM revived the brand as &quot;United Artists Digital Studios&quot; for the &quot;Stargate Origins&quot; web series as part of an attempted relaunch of its &quot;Stargate&quot; franchise which also included a dedicated streaming media platform known as &quot;Stargate Command&quot;, thus following in the footsteps of Paramount Global&#x27;s &quot;CBS All Access&quot; platform (now Paramount+).

====2024–present: Revival====

In July 2024, it was reported that Scott Stuber was nearing a deal to revive the United Artists label under Amazon MGM Studios for the first time in over a decade. Amazon confirmed the news shortly after in a press release, announcing that Stuber had entered a multi-year first look deal with the company. Under this deal, Stuber will produce films for the newly revived banner under his own company either for a theatrical release or streaming release through Amazon Prime Video. Stuber will also be involved with every film released under the United Artists banner.

== Film library ==
A majority of UA&#x27;s post-1952 library is now owned by MGM, while the pre-1952 films (with few exceptions) were either sold to other companies such as National Telefilm Associates (now a part of the Melange/Republic Pictures holdings owned by Paramount Global, with Paramount Pictures handling their distribution) or are in the public domain. However, throughout the studio&#x27;s history, UA acted more as a distributor than a film studio, crediting the copyright to the production company responsible. This explains why certain UA releases, such as &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952) and &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; (1980), are still under copyright but not owned by MGM. The MGM titles which UA distributed from 1973 to 1982 are now owned by Turner (under Warner Bros.).

==UA films on video==
UA originally leased the home video rights to its films to Magnetic Video, the first home video company. Fox purchased Magnetic in 1981 and renamed it 20th Century-Fox Video that year. In 1982, 20th Century-Fox Video merged with CBS Video Enterprises (which earlier split from MGM/CBS Home Video after MGM merged with UA) giving birth to CBS/Fox Video. Although MGM owned UA around this time, UA&#x27;s licensing deal with CBS/Fox (which also included sublabels Key Video and Playhouse Video) was still in effect. However, the newly renamed MGM/UA Home Video started releasing some UA product, including UA films originally released in the mid-80s. Prior to MGM&#x27;s purchase, UA licensed foreign video rights to Warner Bros. through Warner Home Video, in a deal that was set to expire in 1991. In 1986, the pre-1950 WB and the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries were purchased by Ted Turner after his short-lived ownership of MGM/UA, and as a result CBS/Fox lost home video rights to the pre-1950 WB films to MGM/UA Home Video, which licensed them from Turner. When the deal with CBS/Fox (inherited from Magnetic Video) expired in 1989, the UA released films were released through MGM/UA Home Video.

Before the Magnetic Video and Warner Home Video deals in 1980, United Artists had exclusive rental contracts with a small video label called VidAmerica in the US, and another small label called Intervision Video in the UK. for the home video release of 20 titles from the UA library (e.g. &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;, and &quot;Hair&quot;, along with a few pre-1950 WB titles).

==United Artists Broadcasting==
United Artists owned and operated two television stations under the &quot;United Artists Broadcasting&quot; name: WUAB in Cleveland, Ohio (nominally licensed to Lorain, Ohio) which the studio built and sign on in 1968, WRIK-TV in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which was purchased in 1969, and held a construction permit for a station in Houston, Texas. In 1970, United Artists purchased radio station WWSH in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

United Artists left the broadcasting business starting in 1977 by selling WUAB to the Gaylord Broadcasting Company and WWSH to Cox Enterprises, followed by WRIK-TV&#x27;s sale to Tommy Muñiz in 1979.

==United Artists Releasing==
United Artists Releasing, LLC (UAR) was a local film distribution joint venture between MGM and Annapurna Pictures founded by former MGM CEO Gary Barber, businessman and Open Road Films founder Eric Hohl and Annapurna founder Megan Ellison on 31 October 2017, it rebranded as &quot;United Artists Releasing&quot; on 5 February 2019 to commemorate 100 years since the founding of &quot;United Artists&quot;, it operated within with offices of the headquarters of the respective companies in West Hollywood and Los Angeles in California and offered alternative services to the major film studios and streaming media companies with 10–14 films released annually.

On 26 May 2021, online shopping and technology company Amazon acquired MGM Holdings, the parent company of MGM, for $8.45 billion which was completed on 17 March 2022 and consequentially placed United Artists Releasing under the control of Amazon Studios. Amazon then folded United Artists Releasing into MGM on 4 March 2023 in a push towards cinematic/theatrical film distribution alongside their staple media releases on their video on demand service Amazon Prime Video following the box-office success of &quot;Creed III&quot;.

<text>Iveco S.p.A., an acronym for Industrial Vehicles Corporation, is an Italian multinational transport vehicle manufacturing company with headquarters in Turin, Italy. It designs and builds light, medium, and heavy commercial vehicles. The name IVECO first appeared in 1975 after a merger of Italian, French, and German brands. Its production plants are in Europe, China, Russia, Australia and Latin America and it has about 5,000 sales and service outlets in over 160 countries. The worldwide output of the company amounts to around 150,000 commercial vehicles with a turnover of about 10 billion.

The company was spun off from CNH Industrial on 1 January 2022. It is a subsidiary of Iveco Group N.V., a holding company incorporated in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and is listed on Borsa Italiana.

== History ==
Iveco (stylized in all caps as &quot;IVECO&quot;) was incorporated on 1 January 1975, with the merger of five different brands: FIAT Veicoli Industriali (with headquarters in Turin), OM (Brescia, Italy), Lancia Veicoli Speciali (Italy), Unic (France), and Magirus-Deutz (Germany).

Following the merger, the newly founded Iveco began rationalizing its product range, manufacturing plants, and sales network, while keeping the original brands. From 1975 to 1979, the Iveco range included 200 basic models and 600 versions spanning from 2.7 tons of GVW for light vehicles to over 40 tons for heavy vehicles, as well as buses and engines. In 1977, the light- to medium-weight Iveco Zeta range was introduced, replacing the 20-year-old OM Lupetto. Integrating the Fiat-OM range with the Unic and Magirus lineups was completed by 1980. IVECO moved in to work on increasing productivity and engine development. In 1978, IVECO launched the first product in the range of IVECO-branded light vehicles, the Daily.

In 1980, Iveco built a turbo diesel engine for heavy industrial vehicles.

In 1984, Iveco launched the TurboStar, a heavy on-road vehicle that became a best-seller in Italy and also successful in the European market, selling a total of 50,000 units in seven years.

In 1985, Iveco made the first light diesel engine with direct injection.

From 1986, Iveco S.p.A. held a 52% stake in Iveco Ford Truck Ltd, a joint venture (and effectively a merger) with Ford of Europe&#x27;s truck division. Ford plants took over production and sales of the major vehicles in the Iveco range and continued production of the Ford Cargo. In the mid-1980s, Astra Veicoli Industriali, which produces dumpers and construction site/quarry vehicles in Piacenza, became part of Iveco Group.

In 1989, the first Diesel engine with EGR to reduce polluting emissions compatible with commercial vehicles was produced, and the new Daily launched that same year was fitted with it.

In 1990, the group purchased 60% control of Spanish industrial company ENASA, which owned the industrial vehicle builder Pegaso. In the 1990s, the EuroCargo, EuroTech, EuroTrakker, and EuroStar vehicles represented a total facelift for the range. The EuroCargo and the EuroTech were named &quot;Truck of the Year&quot; in 1992 and 1993, respectively, and for the first time, this recognition was awarded to the same manufacturer for two years in a row. English company Seddon Atkinson was purchased in 1991 and brought its long heritage of special vehicles for the construction and refuse-collection industries. That same year, the first TurboDaily assembly line was inaugurated at the Nanjing Motor Corporation in China. In 1991, IVECO announced that they were withdrawing from the North American market at the end of the calendar year; they had been selling the midrange Iveco Z/Euro there since 1978.

In 1992, Iveco took over the primary constructor of industrial vehicles in Australia to form Ital, originally called International Trucks Australia. In 2000 it was renamed &quot;Iveco Trucks Australia Limited&quot;. In 1996 firefighting activities in Germany were structured under the company Iveco Magirus Brandschutztechnik GmbH. The following year, these activities were boosted by the arrival of an Austrian company, Löhr, which then became Löhr Magirus.

In 1998, the Cursor 8 was launched, followed the next year by the Cursor 10, the first diesel engine with a variable-geometry turbine and the first common-rail diesel engine for heavy industrial vehicles. The 125th anniversary of the presentation of the first Magirus ladder was celebrated together with the delivery of the 5000th Magirus aerial ladder produced since the Second World War.

In 2003, Iveco entirely bought out Irisbus, originally part of a joint venture with Renault. In 2004, the Iveco Motors brand was introduced, which became an umbrella for the production of engines; the following year, it was incorporated into the newly founded Fiat Powertrain Technologies. At the end of 2004, an agreement was reached between Iveco and the Chinese company SAIC Motor to form SAIC Iveco Hongyan.

On 1 January 2011, Fiat Industrial was formed, incorporating CNH, Iveco, and FPT Industrial. In September of the same year, the Fiat Industrial Village was inaugurated in Turin, a multipurpose centre belonging to Fiat Industrial and created for the sales, assistance, and product presentation for the Iveco, New Holland, and FPT Industrial brands.

On 11 November 2021, Iveco published the prospectus in order to split from CNH Industrial which will be operated as a publicly separated company named Iveco Group N.V. After the completion of the demerger, on 1 January 2022 Iveco became a part of Iveco Group N.V., the parent company of the trucks and speciality vehicles, powertrain and related financial services businesses previously held by CNH Industrial.

As of 2023, the company forms part of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices.

==Facilities==
Iveco has 27 production plants and 6 research centres located in 16 countries. Outside of Europe, the company operates in China, Russia, Australia (factory ceased production in June 2022), South Africa and Latin America. All the plants have obtained ISO 9001-vision 2000 (quality management by process) and ISO 14000 (environmental management) certification.

=== Joint-ventures ===
* Naveco (Nanjing, China), production trucks by Naveco brand
* SAIC-Iveco Hongyan (Chongqing, China), production trucks by Hongyan brand

==Emissions and alternative fuels==

===Euro VI engines with SCR technology===
Iveco engines from the Cursor and Tector ranges observe the Euro VI standards by adopting High Efficiency SCR (HI-eSCR) technology. This technology optimises the processes of exhaust combustion and after-treatment, reducing consumption and enabling achievement of greater efficiency in the conversion of NOx emissions.

===Electric drive===
Iveco developed and built the first Daily with electric propulsion in 1986; Later, the range was broadened to include trucks and city buses. Iveco introduced the New Daily with electric propulsion and zero exhaust emissions, in which a battery system powers an electric three-phase asynchronous motor – through the aid of an inverter – in charge of moving the vehicle directly while recovering energy during braking. The vehicle runs on two to four batteries made with Na/NiCl2 (sodium-nickel chlorine) technology at a nominal 278 Volts. The maximum velocity is electronically limited to 70km/h, while the vehicle&#x27;s range is from 90 to 130km on a fully charged battery, depending on the number of batteries and the mission.

===Diesel-electric parallel hybrid traction===
The parallel hybrid solution incorporates both a diesel engine and an electric motor that can be used individually or simultaneously, which makes for greater operating flexibility and allows the vehicle to work under both urban and non-urban conditions. In 2010 Iveco introduced this technology on the Eurocargo Ibrido, a commercial vehicle for the European market with electri-diesel parallel propulsion for distributing and collecting goods in city centres. The payload capacity decreases by 200kg in comparison to diesel-engine models, but it is possible to save up to 30% on the urban cycle. The Eurocargo hybrid range is made up of two versions:
* The 7.5-ton version uses a Tector Diesel FPT Industrial engine with 16 valves and 4 Euro V cylinders, with a maximum power of 160hp (118 kW); this is paired with a drive system made of an electric motor-generator with 60hp (44kW), a 6-speed automated gearbox and a lithium-ion battery pack (Li-Ion) of rated capacity 1.8kWh.
* The 12-ton version uses the FPT Industrial Tector engine with 16 valves and 4 EEV cylinders with a maximum power of 180hp (132kW), paired with an electric motor-generator with 60hp (44kW), a 6-speed automated gearbox and a lithium-ion battery pack (Li-Ion) of rated capacity 1.8kWh.

===Diesel-electric hybrid===
Iveco has been active in this sector since 1990 with 6, 7, 4 and 12 metre buses for urban and suburban transportation. The series hybrid technology features a diesel engine – smaller than that of a traditional vehicle – that acts as a battery charger.

===CNG – compressed natural gas===
Iveco&#x27;s range of light, medium and heavy vehicles and buses can run on methane. Methane makes it possible to save on consumption by 38% per kg transported as compared to that consumed by diesel engines for the same payload and distance travelled. In addition, compared to EuroVI diesel engines, methane engines reduce NOx emissions by approximately 60% and particulate emissions by approximately 70%.

===Liquefied natural gas===
In April 2012 Iveco presented its first vehicle with this technology, the Stralis LNG. As opposed to vehicles with compressed natural gas (CNG) technology, liquefied natural gas (LNG) technology takes the vehicle farther on a full tank (up to 750km) and reduces the vehicle&#x27;s tare thus increasing the load. The main difference between the two technologies lies in the type of natural gas storage employed, which in this case is kept in a liquid state at −161°C in cryogenic tanks; it is then heated in a heat exchanger so that once it reaches the engine it is a gas. Also, the noise emitted decreases by 3 to 6 decibels over an analogous diesel engine vehicle.

===Iveco Trakker Bifuel – diesel-ethanol prototype===
Iveco created the first prototype of a bifuel, diesel and ethanol-run vehicle. The technology was developed by Iveco together with FPT Industrial and Bosch. The prototype uses a Trakker truck with Common Rail Cursor9 engine with 360HP that may be powered by a 40–60% ethanol-diesel blend. The prototype was tested by Raízen, a joint venture between the cane sugar producer Cosan and Shell. In 2011, this prototype earned Iveco the &quot;Prêmio Top Etanol&quot; – for the alternative fuel technology.

===Heating and air-conditioning systems===
A prototype of a heat pump system for electric and hybrid vehicles was installed on the Iveco Daily vehicle. The system cools or heats the passenger compartment by transferring low-temperature heat generated by the drive systems. At the same time, the control strategies minimise the energy demand in order to achieve a low impact on consumption.

==Iveco vehicles==
The brand&#x27;s range of products include the Daily, a vehicle that covers the 3.3 – 7.2 ton vehicle weight segment, the Eurocargo from 6 – 19 tons and, in the heavy segment above 16 tons, the Iveco Way range with the on-road Iveco S-Way, the off-road Iveco T-Way and the Iveco X-Way for light off-road missions.

In 2023, Iveco announced their new Driveway Bodybuilder Programme, allowing customers to have a choice of stock tippers and tipper grabs available on X-Way chassis.

==Sponsorships==
Iveco sponsored the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, the Davis Cup in 1982, the Jacques Cousteau expeditions in the Amazon basin in 1983 and the Raid Pigafetta, during which the Iveco-Fiat 75 PC 4x4 was first to make a full circle of the globe. Two new divisions were also formed: bus diesel engines and firefighting vehicles. It also sponsored the first of two fights between Sugar Ray Leonard and Tommy Hearns and between Aaron Pryor and Alexis Arguello.

In 2006, Iveco sponsored the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Turin with a fleet of 1,200 Irisbus buses. The year after, Iveco became sponsor of the All Blacks, New Zealand&#x27;s rugby team. In 2009, Iveco became the truck and commercial vehicle supplier for the Moto GP, together with the historical sponsorship to the Scuderia Ferrari.

Iveco won the 2012 Dakar Rally with the Petronas De Rooy team and Dutch driver Gerard De Rooy, behind the wheel of an Iveco Powerstar. De Rooy was followed by drivers Stacey and Biasion behind the wheel of two Iveco Trakker Evolution 2 vehicles, equipped with an FPT Industrial C13 engine with over 900 hp. De Rooy won the 2016 Dakar Rally for Iveco, whereas Janus van Kasteren won the 2023 Dakar Rally.

<doc id="174328" wikidata="Q942060" url="?curid=174328" title="Kid Gavilán">
<text>Gerardo González (January 6, 1926 – February 13, 2003), better known in the boxing world as Kid Gavilan, was a Cuban boxer. Gavilán was the former undisputed world welterweight champion from 1951 to 1954 having simultaneously held the NYSAC, WBA, and &quot;The Ring&quot; welterweight titles. The Boxing Writers Association of America named him Fighter of the Year in 1953. Gavilán was voted by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine as the 26th greatest fighter of the last 80 years. Gavilán was a 1966 inductee to &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame (disbanded in 1987), and was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 1990.

==Early career==
Gavilan was managed by Yamil Chade, a boxing manager (based in Puerto Rico) who directed the careers of Wilfredo Gómez, Wilfred Benítez, Carlos De León and Félix Trinidad . He started as a professional boxer on the evening of June 5, 1943, when he beat Antonio Diaz by a decision in four rounds in Havana. His first 10 bouts were in Havana, and then he had one in Cienfuegos, but soon he returned to Havana for three more wins. After 14 bouts, he left Cuba for his first fight abroad, and he beat Julio César Jimenez by a decision in 10 rounds in his first of three consecutive fights in Mexico City. It was there that he suffered his first defeat, at the hands of Carlos Macalara by a decision. They had an immediate rematch, this time in Havana, and Gavilan avenged that loss, winning by decision too. Gavilan had a record of 25 wins, 2 losses and 1 draw already when he had his first fight on American soil. This happened on November 1, 1946, when he beat Johnny Ryan by a knockout in five rounds at New York City.

==Move to the United States==
He would split his time between the Eastern coast of the United States and Havana in 1947, a year in which he went 11-1-1 with 3 knockouts. However, by 1948 he had decided to stay in the United States indefinitely. That year, he met some very important fighters, like former world champion Ike Williams, who beat him by decision in ten, Tommy Bell, against whom Gavilan won by decision, Sugar Ray Robinson, who beat him by decision in ten, and Tony Pellone, with Gavilan obtaining a decision against Pellone.

After beating Williams twice by decision, he met Robinson with Robinson&#x27;s world Welterweight title on the line. He lost his first title try, when Robinson won a decision in 15 rounds. Back to the drawing board, he beat Rocky Castellani, the then lightweight world champion Beau Jack, and Laurent Dauthuille (the latter of whom fought Gavilan in Montreal, Quebec). All of them were beaten by decision in 10. In 1950, he went 10-4-1, beating Billy Graham, Sonny Horne, Robert Villemain, Eugene Hairston, and Tony Janiro among others.

==World champion==
In 1951 after beating Tommy Ciarlo twice, once in Caracas, Venezuela, and Hairston once again, he finally became a world champion when he beat Johnny Bratton for the world Welterweight title by a decision in 15 on May 18. He defended that title for the first time against Graham, winning by a decision, and promptly made four non-title bouts before the end of the year, including another win over Janiro and a draw in ten with Bratton.

In 1952 he defended the title with success against Bobby Dykes, Gil Turner, and with Graham in a third encounter between the two. All those fights were won by decision in 15. He also had five non-title bouts, including three that were a part of an Argentinian tour. His third fight with Graham was his first world title defense in Havana and his fight with Dykes marked the first time that a black man and a white man had a boxing fight in then-segregated Miami, Florida. In 1953, Gavilan retained the title by a knockout in ten against Chuck Davey, by a decision in 15 against Carmen Basilio and by a decision in 15 against Bratton. He had seven non-title bouts, losing to Danny Womber, but beating Ralph Tiger Jones. In 1954 Gavilan went up in weight. After two more points wins, he challenged world Middleweight champion Bobo Olson for the world title, but lost a decision in 15. Then, he went down in weight, and lost his world Welterweight championship, by a decision in 15 to Johnny Saxton. That same year, he appeared on a Telemundo Puerto Rico poster that promoted that country&#x27;s first television transmission.

==Personal life==
Gavilan&#x27;s wife, Leonor, gave birth to their daughters, Elena 1950,Victoria 1954, and son Gerardo in 1953. After retiring from boxing Gavilán became one of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and was jailed under the Castro regime for preaching. In the 1980s he made a living selling sausages in Chicago.

==Later career and retirement==
From that point until 1958, when he retired, he had a career of ups and downs. He lost to Dykes, Jones, Eduardo Lausse, former world champion Tony DeMarco, Vince Martinez and Gaspar Ortega, but he also beat Ortega, Jones and Chico Vejar, among others.

<doc id="174345" wikidata="Q707084" url="?curid=174345" title="DJ Spooky">
<text>Paul Dennis Miller (born September 6, 1970), known professionally as DJ Spooky, That Subliminal Kid, is an American electronic and experimental hip hop musician whose work is often called by critics &quot;illbient&quot; or &quot;trip hop&quot;. He is a turntablist, record producer, philosopher, and author. He borrowed his stage name from the character The Subliminal Kid in the novel &quot;Nova Express&quot; by William S. Burroughs. Having studied philosophy and French literature at Bowdoin College, he has become a professor of Music Mediated Art at the European Graduate School and is the executive editor of &quot;Origin&quot; magazine.

==Career==

Spooky began writing science fiction and formed a collective called Soundlab with several other artists.

In the mid-1990s, Spooky began recording a series of singles and EPs. His debut LP was &quot;Songs of a Dead Dreamer&quot;. Spooky contributed to the AIDS benefit albums &quot;&quot; (1996) and &quot;Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon&quot; (1998) produced by the Red Hot Organization. &quot;Riddim Warfare&quot; included collaborations with Kool Keith and other figures in indie rock, including Sonic Youth&#x27;s Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore. In 2001, he released the CD &quot;Under the Influence&quot;.

He returned in 2002 with &quot;Modern Mantra&quot;. That same year saw the release of &quot;Optometry&quot;, a collaboration with avant-jazz players Matthew Shipp, William Parker, Guillermo E. Brown and Joe McPhee. In a classical vein, he collaborated with the ST-X Ensemble in performances of the music of Iannis Xenakis. 
DJ Spooky collaborated with Ryuichi Sakamoto on projects including The Discord Symphony. The concert and album were released as an enhanced CD containing both a full audio program and multimedia computer files. It features spoken-word performances by Laurie Anderson, David Byrne, Patti Smith, David Sylvian, DJ Spooky, David Torn, and Bernardo Bertolucci.

He collaborated with Iannis Xenakis on the recording of &quot;Kraanerg&quot;, with the STX-Ensemble in 1997.

2005 saw the release of &quot;Drums of Death&quot;, DJ Spooky&#x27;s CD based on sessions he recorded with Dave Lombardo of Slayer. Other guest artists include Chuck D of Public Enemy and Vernon Reid of Living Colour. The record was co-produced by Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto.

DJ Spooky joined the ninth and eleventh annual Independent Music Awards judging panel to assist independent musicians&#x27; careers. He was also a judge for the third Independent Music Awards.

DJ Spooky has said that much of his work &quot;deals with the notion of the encoded gesture or the encrypted psychology of how music affects the whole framework of what the essence of &#x27;humaness&#x27; is... To me at this point in the 21st century, the notion of the encoded sound is far more of a dynamic thing, especially when you have these kinds of infodispersion systems running, so I&#x27;m fascinated with the unconscious at this point.&quot;

===Other work===
His work as an artist has appeared in a variety of contexts such as the Whitney Biennial; the Venice Biennale; the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, Germany; Kunsthalle, Vienna; The Andy Warhol Museum; Paula Cooper Gallery; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, and many other museums and galleries. In 2007, his work appeared in the Africa Pavilion at the 52nd Venice Biennial. This remix of music from Africa was also distributed freely online, and promoted by the blog &quot;Boing Boing&quot;. &quot;You give away a certain amount of your stuff, and then the cultural economy of cool kicks in&quot;, DJ Spooky said.

In 2006, the song &quot;Battle of Erishkigal&quot;, co-written by DJ Spooky and Frank Fitzpatrick, was featured in the anime-inspired film &quot;The Rebel Angel&quot;.
In August 2009, DJ Spooky visited the Republic of Nauru in the Micronesian South Pacific to do research and gather material for a project in development, with a working title of &quot;The Nauru Elegies: A Portrait in Sound and Hypsographic Architecture&quot;.

DJ Spooky&#x27;s multimedia performance piece &quot;Terra Nova: Sinfonia Antarctica&quot; was commissioned by BAM for the 2009 Next Wave Festival; the Hopkins Center for the Arts/Dartmouth College; UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures; Melbourne International Arts Festival; and the Festival dei 2 Mondi in Spoleto, Italy.

DJ Spooky&#x27;s &quot;Rebirth of a Nation&quot;, a remix of D. W. Griffith&#x27;s 1915 film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, was commissioned in 2004 by the Lincoln Center Festival, Spoleto Festival USA, Wiener Festwochen, and the Festival d&#x27;Automne a Paris.

In 2010, Miller formed The Vanuatu Pacifica Foundation, a contemporary arts organization dedicated to exploring dialog between Oceania and the rest of the world.

In 2011, Miller collaborated with Ballet Austin Artistic Director Stephen Mills on a ballet work titled &quot;Echo Boom&quot; as part of &quot;The Mozart Project&quot;.

In 2016, DJ Spooky composed a &quot;New Forms&quot; duet for carillon and a computational re-synthesis of the Tsar Bell, a Russian bell which broke before it was ever rung.

In 2017, DJ Spooky started composing the music for &quot;Intercepted&quot;, a podcast produced by news publication &quot;The Intercept&quot;.

==Family==
Miller was born in Washington, D.C. to Paul E. Miller, who headed a panel of 12 African American law professors who assisted defense lawyers in the California trial of Angela Davis, and Rosemary Reed Miller, historian and former owner, Toast and Strawberries, a Washington, D.C. boutique.
DJ Spooky has a daughter born in 2011 to Fumika Yamamoto.

<doc id="174355" wikidata="Q284868" url="?curid=174355" title="Quid pro quo">
<text>Quid pro quo (Latin: &quot;something for something&quot;) is a Latin phrase used in English to mean an exchange of goods or services, in which one transfer is contingent upon the other; &quot;a favor for a favor&quot;. Phrases with similar meanings include: &quot;give and take&quot;, &quot;tit for tat&quot;, &quot;you scratch my back, and I&#x27;ll scratch yours&quot;, &quot;this for that,&quot; and &quot;one hand washes the other&quot;. Other languages use &quot;do ut des&quot; to express a reciprocal exchange, which aligns with the Latin meaning, whereas the widespread use of &quot;quid pro quo&quot; in English for this concept arose from a &quot;misunderstanding&quot;.

== Origins ==
The Latin phrase &quot;quid pro quo&quot; originally implied that something had been substituted, meaning &quot;something for something&quot; as in &quot;I gave you sugar for salt&quot;. Early usage by English speakers followed the original Latin meaning, with occurrences in the 1530s where the term referred to substituting one medicine for another, whether unintentionally or fraudulently. By the end of the same century, &quot;quid pro quo&quot; evolved into a more current use to describe equivalent exchanges. 

In 1654, the expression &quot;quid pro quo&quot; was used to generally refer to something done for personal gain or with the expectation of reciprocity in the text &quot;The Reign of King Charles: An History Disposed into Annalls&quot;, with a somewhat positive connotation. It refers to the covenant with Christ as something &quot;that prove not a &quot;nudum pactum&quot;, a naked contract, without &quot;quid pro quo&quot;.&quot; Believers in Christ have to do their part in return, namely &quot;foresake the devil and all his works&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Quid pro quo&quot; would go on to be used, by English speakers in legal and diplomatic contexts, as an exchange of equally valued goods or services and continues to be today.

The Latin phrase corresponding to the English usage of &quot;quid pro quo&quot; is &quot;do ut des&quot; (Latin for &quot;I give, so that you may give&quot;). Other languages continue to use &quot;do ut des&quot; for this purpose, while &quot;quid pro quo&quot; (or its equivalent &quot;qui pro quo&quot;, as widely used in Italian, French, Spanish and Portuguese) still keeps its original meaning of something being unwittingly mistaken, or erroneously told or understood, instead of something else.

== Legal meanings ==
=== Common law ===
In common law, &quot;quid pro quo&quot; indicates that an item or a service has been traded in return for something of value, usually when the propriety or equity of the transaction is in question. A contract must involve consideration: that is, the exchange of something of value for something else of value. For example, when buying an item of clothing or a gallon of milk, a pre-determined amount of money is exchanged for the product the customer is purchasing; therefore, they have received something but have given up something of equal value in return.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, the one-sidedness of a contract is covered by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and various revisions and amendments to it; a clause can be held void or the entire contract void if it is deemed unfair (that is to say, one-sided and not a &quot;quid pro quo&quot;); however, this is a civil law and not a common law matter.

Political donors must be resident in the UK. There are fixed limits to how much they may donate (£5000 in any single donation), and it must be recorded in the House of Commons Register of Members&#x27; Interests or at the House of Commons Library; the &quot;quid pro quo&quot; is strictly not allowed, that a donor can by his donation have some personal gain. This is overseen by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. There are also prohibitions on donations being given in the six weeks before the election for which it is being campaigned. It is also illegal for donors to support party political broadcasts, which are tightly regulated, free to air, and scheduled and allotted to the various parties according to a formula agreed by Parliament and enacted with the Communications Act 2003.

=== United States ===
In the United States, if an exchange appears excessively one sided, courts in some jurisdictions may question whether a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; did actually exist and the contract may be held void. In cases of &quot;quid pro quo&quot; business contracts, the term takes on a negative connotation because major corporations may cross ethical boundaries in order to enter into these very valuable, mutually beneficial, agreements with other major big businesses. In these deals, large sums of money are often at play and can consequently lead to promises of exclusive partnerships indefinitely or promises of distortion of economic reports.

In the U.S., lobbyists are legally entitled to support candidates that hold positions with which the donors agree, or which will benefit the donors. Such conduct becomes bribery only when there is an identifiable exchange between the contribution and official acts, previous or subsequent, and the term &quot;quid pro quo&quot; denotes such an exchange.

In terms of criminal law, &quot;quid pro quo&quot; tends to get used as a euphemism for crimes such as extortion and bribery.

==== Sexual harassment ====
In United States labor law, workplace sexual harassment can take two forms; either &quot;quid pro quo&quot; harassment or hostile work environment harassment. &quot;Quid pro quo&quot; harassment takes place when a supervisor requires sex, sexual favors, or sexual contact from an employee/job candidate as a condition of their employment. Only supervisors who have the authority to make tangible employment actions (i.e. hire, fire, promote, etc.), can commit &quot;quid pro quo&quot; harassment. The supervising harasser must have &quot;immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee.&quot; The power dynamic between a supervisor and subordinate/job candidate is such that a supervisor could use their position of authority to extract sexual relations based on the subordinate/job candidate&#x27;s need for employment. Co-workers and non-decision making supervisors cannot engage in &quot;quid pro quo&quot; harassment with other employees, but an employer could potentially be liable for the behavior of these employees under a hostile work environment claim. The harassing employee&#x27;s status as a supervisor is significant because if the individual is found to be a supervisor then the employing company can be held vicariously liable for the actions of that supervisor. Under Agency law, the employer is held responsible for the actions of the supervisor because they were in a position of power within the company at the time of the harassment.

To establish a prima facie case of &quot;quid pro quo&quot; harassment, the plaintiff must prove that they were subjected to &quot;unwelcome sexual conduct&quot;, that submission to such conduct was explicitly or implicitly a term of their employment, and submission to or rejection of this conduct was used as a basis for an employment decision, as follows:

* Unwelcome Sexual Conduct: a court will look at the employee&#x27;s conduct to determine whether the supervisor&#x27;s sexual advances were unwelcome. In Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, the Court opined that voluntary sex between an employee and supervisor does not establish proof that a supervisor&#x27;s sexual advances were welcome. The Court also stated that evidence of the subordinate employee&#x27;s provocative dress and publicly expressed sexual fantasies can be introduced as evidence if relevant.{{vs|date=November 2019}}
* Term of Employment: a term or condition of employment means that the subordinate/job candidate must acquiesce to the sexual advances of the supervisor in order to maintain/be hired for the job. In essence, the sexual harassment becomes a part of their job. For example, a supervisor promises an employee a raise if they go out on a date with the supervisor, or tells an employee they will be fired if the employee doesn&#x27;t sleep with them.
* Tangible Employment Action: a tangible employment action must take place as a result of the employee&#x27;s submission or refusal of supervisor&#x27;s advances. In Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, the Court stated that tangible employment action amounted to &quot;a significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.&quot; It is important to note that only supervisors can make tangible employment actions, since they have the company&#x27;s authority to do so. The Court also held that unfulfilled threats by a supervisor of an adverse employment decision are not sufficient to establish a &quot;Quid pro quo,&quot; but were relevant for the purposes of a hostile work environment claim. Additionally, the Supreme Court has held that constructive dismissal can count as a tangible employment action (thus allowing a quid pro quo sexual harassment claim) if the actions taken by a supervisor created a situation where a &quot;reasonable person ... would have felt compelled to resign.&quot;

Once the plaintiff has established these three factors, the employer can not assert an affirmative defense (such as the employer had a sexual harassment policy in place to prevent and properly respond to issues of sexual harassment), but can only dispute whether the unwelcome conduct did not in fact take place, the employee was not a supervisor, and that there was no tangible employment action involved.

Although these terms are popular among lawyers and scholars, neither &quot;hostile work environment&quot; nor &quot;quid pro quo&quot; are found in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of race, sex, color, national origin, and religion. The Supreme Court noted in Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth that these terms are useful in differentiating between cases where threats of harassment are &quot;carried out and those where they are not or absent altogether,&quot; but otherwise these terms serve a limited purpose. Therefore, sexual harassment can take place by a supervisor, and an employer can be potentially liable, even if that supervisor&#x27;s behavior does not fall within the criteria of a &quot;Quid pro quo&quot; harassment claim.

==== Donald Trump impeachment inquiry ====
{{Main|Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump|Trump–Ukraine scandal|There was no quid pro quo}}
&quot;Quid pro quo&quot; was frequently mentioned during the first impeachment inquiry into U.S. president Donald Trump, in reference to the charge that his request for an investigation of Hunter Biden was a precondition for the delivery of congressionally authorized military aid during a call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

== Other meanings ==
For languages that come from Latin, such as Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and French, &quot;quid pro quo&quot; is used to define a misunderstanding or blunder made by the substituting of one thing for another. The Oxford English Dictionary describes this alternative definition in English as &quot;now rare&quot;. The {{Lang|it|Vocabolario Treccani}} (an authoritative dictionary published by the Encyclopedia Treccani), under the entry &quot;qui pro quo&quot;, states that the latter expression probably derives from the Latin used in late medieval pharmaceutical compilations. This can be clearly seen from the work appearing precisely under this title, &quot;{{Lang|la|Tractatus quid pro quo|italic=no}},&quot; (Treatise on what substitutes for what) in the medical collection headed up by {{Lang|la|Mesue cum expositione Mondini super Canones universales}}&quot;...&quot; ({{Lang|la|Venice: per Joannem &amp; Gregorium de gregorijs fratres|italic=no}}, 1497), folios 334r-335r. Some examples of what could be used in place of what in this list are: {{Lang|la|Pro uva passa dactili}} (&#x27;in place of raisins, [use] dates&#x27;); {{Lang|la|Pro mirto sumac}} (&#x27;in place of myrtle, [use] sumac&#x27;); {{Lang|la|Pro fenugreco semen lini}} (&#x27;in place of fenugreek, [use] flaxseed&#x27;), etc. This list was an essential resource in the medieval apothecary, especially for occasions when certain essential medicinal substances were not available.

Satirist Ambrose Bierce defined political influence as &quot;a visionary &quot;quo&quot; given in exchange for a substantial &quot;quid&quot;&quot;, making a pun on &quot;quid&quot; as a form of currency.

&quot;Quid&quot; is slang for &quot;pounds&quot;, the British currency, originating on this expression as in: &quot;if you want the quo you&#x27;ll need to give them some quid&quot;, which explains the plural without &quot;s&quot;, as in &quot;I gave them five hundred quid&quot;.

<doc id="174357" wikidata="Q2292612" url="?curid=174357" title="Skiz Fernando">
<text>Sarath &quot;Skiz&quot; Fernando (born 1968) is a former music critic, who has written for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;The Source&quot;, &quot;Spin&quot;, and &quot;Vibe&quot;. Later, under the alias Spectre, he became a record producer, rapper, and electronica artist. He is the founder and the head of his own label WordSound, as well as the author of several books about hip hop music.

==Early life==
Sarath H. Fernando Jr. was born in 1968 in Texas. His parents are Sri Lankan immigrants, and he is the only person in his family to be born in the United States. Fernando was raised in Pikesville, Baltimore County, Maryland and attended St. Paul&#x27;s School for Boys.

Throughout childhood, he was listening to music records his brother and sister would bring home. His siblings were &quot;much older&quot; than him and were listening to Parliament-Funkadelic, Bob Marley, and David Bowie. In 1979, when he was around 11 years old, he heard the song &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; on the radio. &quot;For me, that was it. I had no idea what hip-hop even was, but I was mesmerized. A few years later, when Soul Sonic Force released &#x27;Planet Rock,&#x27; I knew I wanted to be a part of that music&quot;, recalls Fernando. He became friends with &quot;the only three black guys&quot; in his school and started listening to their favorite music, which included LL Cool J and Run-DMC, while continuing listening to rock bands like the Smiths. In the following years, Fernando would dedicate time to exploring record stores in search of new artists and genres.

After graduating from Harvard College, Fernando moved to Greece, where he worked as a school teacher. At that time, he was unsure about his future plans. Since he loved hip hop, a year later he decided to move to New York City, which he viewed as the central place for hip hop. To justify the decision to his parents, he enrolled in the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, which he later graduated from.

==Journalistic career==
During his time in Harvard, Skiz Fernando would listen to the &quot;Street Beat&quot; show on WHRB, a student radio station. The show was hosted by two Harvard College students, David Mays and Jonathan Shecter, who would later create &quot;The Source&quot;. Started as a one-page newsletter, &quot;The Source&quot; quickly turned into what &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as &quot;the leading magazine on hip-hop music, culture and politics&quot;. Around 1992, after returning from Greece and meeting with Shecter, Fernando started writing for &quot;The Source&quot; magazine. In the following years, he contributed to various other publications, including &quot;Vibe&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Spin&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

==Music career==
===1993–1994: Beginning of music career and launching WordSound===
Working as a journalist allowed Skiz Fernando to make connections in the music industry, giving him an opportunity to launch his own music career. In 1993, while working on a review for Material&#x27;s &quot;Hallucination Engine&quot;, Fernando contacted the band&#x27;s bassist Bill Laswell to take an interview. The two immediately became friends, and afterwards, Fernando would frequently visit Laswell&#x27;s studio. There he met other artists, including funk musician George Clinton of Parliament-Funkadelic and jazz drummer Tony Williams. With a $1000 loan from Laswell, Fernando launched his own record label. He called it WordSound, after a dub compilation album &quot;Word Sound &#x27;ave Power: Dub Poets And Dub&quot;. A warehouse in Williamsburg, Brooklyn was used as the label&#x27;s headquarters.

WordSound released its first albums in 1994: &quot;The Red Shift&quot; compilation album and &quot;Scarab&quot; by the band Scarab. The band initially consisted of Skiz Fernando and his friend Professor Shehab. During that time, Fernando was trying to capture the music of like-minded artists around himself. The resulting compilation &quot;Certified Dope, Vol. 1&quot; was released on WordSound in 1995, under the name Crooklyn Dub Consortium. The collective, apart from Fernando, also included drummer Doug Scharin as HiM, Bill Laswell as Automaton, the duo Sub Dub, Dr. Israel, and the band We™. According to AllMusic&#x27;s Rick Anderson, the album &quot;heralded the emergence of a new sound in underground music&quot;. In 2015, &quot;Fact&quot; magazine placed it at number 13 on their list of the 50 best trip-hop albums of all time, describing it as an album that &quot;blended the dusty boom bap that ruled the city at the time with the mixing desk mysticism of Jamaican dub&quot;.

===1995–1996: Debut solo album and working with Prince Paul===
While working on his 1994 book &quot;The New Beats&quot;, Fernando started learning music production, making music every night to relax. He took the pseudonym Spectre, which, according to the artist, represents his dark alter ego that is the exact opposite of himself, allowing him to &quot;express his dark side&quot;. Later, he would use several other pseudonyms, including the Ill Saint, Slotek, and Wordsound I-Powa. Spectre&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;The Illness&quot;, was released through WordSound in 1995. Thomas Quinlan of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; noted the &quot;morbid shred of fear and decay&quot; in the album&#x27;s sound, while AllMusic&#x27;s John Bush in his review called &quot;The Illness&quot; a fusion of &quot;hip-hop mysticism more than worthy of Wu-Tang&quot; with production techniques akin to those used by the Jamaican producer Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry. The style of music, employed on this album, would later be called illbient.

The release of &quot;The Illness&quot; ultimately led to Skiz Fernando collaborating with the producer Prince Paul. The mid-1990s was a troubled period in Prince Paul&#x27;s career. Known for his early 1990s work with De La Soul and Gravediggaz, he now faced financial difficulties due to low album sales and was frustrated with the music industry. Fernando contacted him about recording an album, offering to do a small release of 1000 physical copies. According to Prince Paul, he wanted to make &quot;one of the craziest recordings ever&quot;, marking the end of his career. The album, titled &quot;&quot;, was released in 1996, through WordSound. It was one of the earliest instrumental hip hop albums, featuring almost no rapping, with the only vocals throughout the majority of the album being skits. The album consists of rappers&#x27; monologues, where they discuss their obscene thoughts and dreams with a psychoanalyst with a distinct Viennese accent, over jazz-inspired beats. &quot;Psychoanalysis: What Is It?&quot; performed commercially far better than both the label and the artist anticipated, and became one of the best selling albums of the label. That prompted Tommy Boy Records to buy the album rights and re-release an updated version a year later. Prince Paul has said that the album &quot;catapulted [his] career&quot;. Fernando later introduced him to Dan the Automator, which resulted in the formation of the Handsome Boy Modeling School duo and the subsequent release of their critically acclaimed debut album &quot;So... How&#x27;s Your Girl?&quot; (1999).

Several other albums were released by WordSound in 1996. One of them was the second Crooklyn Dub Consortium compilation, titled &quot;Certified Dope, Vol. 2&quot;. &quot;MTV&quot; music critic Kembrew McLeod praised the album&#x27;s unique sound. He called Crooklyn Dub Consortium &quot;some of the most innovative and cutting-edge sound sculptors&quot;, noting that despite &quot;Certified Dope, Vol. 2&quot; being a compilation album it still sounds cohesive due to the artists&#x27; association with the label. The German magazine &quot;Spex&quot; placed &quot;Certified Dope, Vol. 2&quot; at number 20 of their list of the 50 best albums of 1996. Among other albums Fernando released that year were &quot;Live from the Planet Crooklyn&quot;, released under the pseudonym Wordsound I-Powa through ROIR Records, &quot;Dread Western&quot; by Roots Control duo, a collaborative album with his former roommate Jeremy &quot;Likkle Jer&quot; Dawson, and a highly acclaimed &quot;Subterranean Hitz, Vol. 1&quot; compilation. Described by AllMusic&#x27;s John Bush as a mix of illbient and abstract hip hop, &quot;Subterranean Hitz, Vol. 1&quot; featured a number of hip hop artists, including Rob Swift of X-Ecutioners, Scott Harding, Prince Paul, and Afrika Baby Bam of Jungle Brothers. In his review of the album, Tony Herrington of &quot;The Wire&quot; magazine categorized its tracks as &quot;insulated studio odysseys&quot; which require listeners to have &quot;superhuman levels of concentration&quot;. According to Skiz Fernando, soon after the release he went to Fat Beats, one of the biggest hip hop record stores in New York City, asking them to sell copies of &quot;Subterranean Hitz, Vol. 1&quot;. But despite the album featuring numerous hip hop artists, the owner of the store refused to sell it, saying that &quot;this isn&#x27;t hip hop&quot;.

===1997–1999: WordSound&#x27;s peak period===
Spectre released his second solo album, &quot;The Second Coming&quot;, through WordSound in 1997. &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s reviewer Richard Gehr described the album as a &quot;vampire-movie soundtrack&quot;, commending the album&#x27;s sound, but noting that Spectre&#x27;s ideas &quot;[run] out of steam&quot; towards its second half. During that year Fernando also introduced a new pseudonym, releasing the album &quot;7&quot; as Slotek. AllMusic&#x27;s John Bush called the album a &quot;sample mayhem&quot;, praising its production.

1998 saw the release of &quot;Subterranean Hitz, Vol. 2&quot;. Like the first compilation, it featured Rob Swift, Afrika Baby Bam, Prince Paul and Scott Harding. The album received positive reviews from music critics. Tim Haslett of &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; called it a &quot;mandatory [listen] for anyone even remotely interested in the future of electronic music with hip-hop sensibilities at its heart&quot;. &quot;The Wire&quot; Will Montgomery commended the album, noting its &quot;broader set of sounds&quot; and lyrics, that &quot;expose just how dull your average raps are&quot;. The same year Spectre released &quot;Ruff Kutz&quot;, a 90-minutes mixtape that featured remixes and unreleased tracks from a number of label&#x27;s artists, including Sensational, Mr Dead, Dubadelic, Techno Animal, Bill Laswell, and Jungle Brothers. Originally a limited WordSound cassette release, in 2015 &quot;Ruff Kutz&quot; was remastered and re-released on double vinyl and digitally, through PAN, an imprint label of Berlin-based artist Bill Kouligas. &quot;Fact&quot; magazine placed the re-release on their list of 25 best reissues of 2015, calling it a &quot;freeform hotbox hit-parade of dirty Bowery beats, chopped and screwed breaks, and hefty helpings of echo-chamber dub mixology&quot;, that perfectly encapsulated the New York underground scene of the 1990s.

Multiple projects were released in 1999. Among them was the second Slotek album, &quot;Hydrophonic&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s John Bush noted Slotek&#x27;s move away from samples towards &quot;raps reminiscent of KRS-One&quot; and praised the production that fits the album well. Another album released by WordSound that year was &quot;Certified Dope, Vol. 3: Escape From New York&quot; compilation. For the third album in the series, Crooklyn Dub Consortium collective was renamed to Crooklyn Dub Outernational, which signified their expansion into other territories, such as Europe, the UK, Jamaica and Japan. &quot;The Wire&quot; magazine placed &quot;Certified Dope, Vol. 3&quot; on their list of the best albums of 1999.

===2000–present: WordSound&#x27;s decline and later solo projects===
Despite being an influential underground label and a pioneer of the illbient genre in the 1990s, in the early 2000s WordSound started gradually fading away from the mainstream media. In 2004, &quot;XLR8R&quot; magazine reported the label&#x27;s &quot;disappearance&quot;. In a letter published by the magazine in one of the later issues, Skiz Fernando explained that he didn&#x27;t receive a $38,000 payment from one of the distributors in 2001, and in 2004 their European distributor closed, owing the label $80,000. The artist believed those factors ultimately led to the decline in visibility of an already underground label, which he was running from his living room. Fernando had also moved from Brooklyn to his hometown Baltimore due to &quot;skyrocketing rents&quot;. Nevertheless, he continued releasing music through WordSound over the years, but kept it mostly to his solo projects.

The third album in Spectre&#x27;s trilogy, &quot;The End&quot;, was released in January 2000 (the release date is sometimes reported as late 1999). In his review for &quot;Exclaim!&quot;, Thomas Quinlan highlighted the album&#x27;s atmospheric nature and its blend of exotic Spectre&#x27;s instrumentals with tracks featuring guest vocalists. &quot;The Wire&quot; magazine included &quot;The End&quot; in their list of the best albums of the year 2000. The Ill Saint&#x27;s third compilation album, &quot;Subterranean Hitz, Vol. 3: The III School&quot;, was also released in 2000. Mike DaRonco of AllMusic thought the album featured &quot;hard-hitting beats&quot; combined with &quot;street-smart wit&quot;, while &quot;Exclaim!&quot; Thomas Quinlan found the album &quot;worth repeated listens&quot;, despite feeling that some of the tracks were disappointing.

While working on his follow-up solo album, Spectre released two albums through Belgian label Quatermass. 2002&#x27;s &quot;Parts Unknown&quot; was based on previously unreleased material and was a collaborative album with the rapper Sensational. The second Quatermass album was &quot;Retrospectre&quot; (2004) compilation. &quot;Dusted&quot; magazine&#x27;s Casey Rae-Hunter noted the album&#x27;s &quot;captivating freshness&quot;, despite it spanning more than a decade&#x27;s worth of material.

Spectre&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Psychic Wars&quot;, was released in 2003. In her review for &quot;XLR8R&quot;, Selena Hsu called the album &quot;considerably less sludgy and not as obscured by [Spectre&#x27;s] trademark impenetrable haze&quot;, while Heinrich Deisl of the German magazine named it the most accessible release from Spectre. Rick Anderson of AllMusic commended &quot;more energetic beats and lively interpolations of exotic foreign musical elements&quot;, but criticized the beginning of the album as being unnecessary. &quot;Dusted&quot; Mason Jones thought the music on the album was &quot;melancholy and slow&quot;, as it featured &quot;orchestral stabs and ultra-low synth bass dominating the doom-laden sonic environments&quot;. He also noted that some of the samples fit &quot;rhythmically awkwardly&quot;, but he believed it enhances the mood of the album.

WordSound released the fourth Crooklyn Dub Outernational&#x27;s compilation, &quot;Certified Dope, Vol. 4: Babylon&#x27;s Burning&quot;, in 2004. AllMusic&#x27;s Chris Nickson called it a &quot;good summation of the state of global dub today from a label that stays permanently on the edge&quot;. &quot;XLR8R&quot; reviewer Daniel Siwek commended the collective for their ability to provide a diverse range of musical styles while striking a perfect balance between classic elements and a modern sound. &quot;Exclaim!&quot; David Dacks thought the album deviates from the traditional dub sound, instead &quot;[continuing] this series with an assemblage of spine crushers and outward-bound riddims&quot;. &quot;The Wire&quot; named it one of the best albums of the year.

Spectre released his next solo album, &quot;Transcendent&quot;, in 2006 through digital distribution. It was followed by 2008&#x27;s &quot;Internal Dynasty&quot;, released digitally through WordSound, with a limited vinyl release through Monkey Tool label. Mike Lupica of &quot;Dusted&quot; magazine noted that the album &quot;[remains] systemically disquieting, off-kilter and reassuringly distanced from any current trend in hip hop&quot;. In 2010, the artist released the next album by Spectre, titled &quot;Death Before Dying&quot;.

In 2012, Spectre released his ninth solo album, &quot;The True &amp; Living&quot;. The album was funded through Kickstarter, and released both digitally and on vinyl. Laurent Fintoni, writing for &quot;Fact&quot; magazine, highlighted the album&#x27;s &quot;crisp and snappy&quot; beats, but warned younger readers that it may sound dated. &quot;Exclaim!&quot; reviewer Thomas Quinlan called &quot;The True &amp; Living&quot; a &quot;dark and brooding&quot; album, noting the consistency of Spectre&#x27;s style and his improvements to it. Spectre&#x27;s next project, &quot;Brand New Second Hand&quot;, was released digitally in 2014.

The tenth solo album by Spectre, &quot;The Last Shall Be First&quot;, was released in 2016. It was funded through Kickstarter, and was asserted to be the final album released as Spectre. To promote the Kickstarter campaign, Skiz Fernando released &quot;Doom &amp; Boom: The Spectre Chronicles (1995-2015)&quot;, a free compilation album which included tracks from every album previously released. Philip Freeman, in his article for &quot;Bandcamp Daily&quot;, described the album&#x27;s sound as &quot;beats verging on industrial at times, and the bass as tar-like as ever&quot;. In 2021, Fernando released EP titled &quot;Èminence Grise&quot;. It was released digitally under the pseudonym Tha Ill Saint, with a limited vinyl release through a German label LOWHOP-Records.

In 2000 while visiting family in Sri Lanka, Fernando wrote the script for a movie called &quot;Crooked&quot;. The film was shot in 25 days in April 2001 then edited and put through post production through the summer and winter of the same year. It was released on the Wordsound label as a soundtrack and a two disc DVD set in 2002.

<text>Théodore Simon Jouffroy (6 July 17964 February 1842), aka Simon Joseph Théodore Jouffroy, was a French philosopher.

== Biography ==
He was born at Les Pontets, Franche-Comté, département of Doubs. In his tenth year, his father, a tax-gatherer, sent him to an uncle at Pontarlier, under whom he began his classical studies. At Dijon his compositions attracted the attention of an inspector, who had him placed (1814) in the normal school, Paris. There he came under the influence of Victor Cousin, and in 1817 he was appointed assistant professor of philosophy at the normal and Bourbon schools.

Three years later, being thrown upon his own resources, he began a course of lectures in his own house, and formed literary connexions with &quot;Le Courrier français&quot;, &quot;Le Globe&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Encyclopédie moderne&quot;, and &quot;La Revue européenne&quot;. The variety of his pursuits at this time carried him over the whole field of ancient and modern literature. But he was chiefly attracted to the philosophical system represented by Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart. The application of &quot;common sense&quot; to the problem of substance supplied a more satisfactory analytic for him than the scepticism of David Hume which reached him through a study of Kant.

He thus threw in his lot with the Scottish philosophy, and his first dissertations are adaptations from Reid&#x27;s &quot;Inquiry&quot;. In 1826 he wrote a preface to a translation of Stewart&#x27;s &quot;Moral Philosophy&quot;, demonstrating the possibility of a scientific statement of the laws of consciousness; in 1828 he began a translation of the works of Reid, and in his preface estimated the influence of Scottish criticism upon philosophy, giving a biographical account of the movement from Francis Hutcheson onwards. In the following year he was returned to &quot;parlement&quot; by the &quot;arrondissement&quot; of Pontarlier; but the work of legislation was ill-suited to him. Yet he attended to his duties conscientiously, and ultimately broke his health in their discharge. In 1833 he was appointed professor of Greek and Roman philosophy at the college of France and a member of the Academy of Sciences; he then published the &quot;Mélanges philosophiques&quot; (4th ed. 1866; Eng. trans. G Ripley, Boston, 1835 and 1838), a collection of fugitive papers in criticism and philosophy and history. In them is foreshadowed all that he afterwards worked out in metaphysics, psychology, ethics and aesthetics.

He had already demonstrated, in his prefaces, the possibility of a psychology apart from physiology, of a science of the phenomena of consciousness distinct from the perceptions of sense. He now classified the mental faculties, premising that they must not be confounded with capacities or properties of mind. They were, according to his analysis, personal will, primitive instincts, voluntary movement, natural and artificial signs, sensibility and the faculties of intellect; on this analytic he founded his scheme of the universe.

In 1835 he published &quot;Cours de droit naturel&quot; (4th ed. 1866), one of his most important works. From the conception of a universal order in the universe he reasons to a Supreme Being, who has created it and who has conferred upon every man in harmony with it the aim of his existence, leading to his highest good. Good, he says, is the fulfilment of man&#x27;s destiny, evil the thwarting of it. Every man being organized in a particular way has, of necessity, an aim, the fulfilment of which is good; and he has faculties for accomplishing it, directed by reason. The aim is good, however, only when reason guides it for the benefit of the majority, but that is not absolute good. When reason rises to the conception of universal order, when actions are submitted, by the exercise of a sympathy working necessarily and intuitively to the idea of the universal order, the good has been reached, the true good, good in itself, absolute good. But he does not follow his idea into the details of human duty, though he passes in review fatalism, mysticism, pantheism, scepticism, egotism, sentimentalism and rationalism.

In 1835 Jouffroy&#x27;s health failed and he went to Italy, where he continued to translate the Scottish philosophers. On his return he became librarian to the university, and took the chair of recent philosophy at the faculty of letters. He died in Paris. After his death were published &quot;Nouveaux mélanges philosophiques&quot; (3rd ed. 1872) and &quot;Cours d&#x27;esthetique&quot; (3rd ed. 1875). The former contributed nothing new to the system except a more emphatic statement of the distinction between psychology and physiology. The latter formulated his theory of beauty.

Jouffroy&#x27;s claim to distinction rests mainly on his ability as an expositor of other men&#x27;s ideas. His enthusiasm, and his command over the language of popular exposition, made him a great international medium for the transfusion of ideas. He stood between Scotland and France and Germany and France; and, though his expositions are vitiated by loose reading of the philosophers he interpreted, he did some memorable work.

<doc id="174363" wikidata="Q3410431" url="?curid=174363" title="Public trust">
<text>The concept of public trust relates back to the origins of democratic government and its seminal idea that within the public lies the true power and future of a society; therefore, whatever &quot;trust&quot; citizens place in its officials must be respected.
One of the reasons that bribery is regarded as a notorious evil is that it contributes to a culture of political corruption in which public trust is eroded. Other issues related to political corruption or betrayal of public trust are lobbying, special interest groups and the public cartel.
==United States==

In the United States &quot;Public Trust&quot; is a term of art referring to any public property which belongs to the whole of the people. Initially it was used within the formation of the government to refer to politicians who achieve power by election. In the United States Constitution, all members of Congress as well as the President, and Vice President are elected seats therein. The first state constitution drafted in the United States was the Maryland Constitution of 1776, which expressed that all persons vested with the legislative and executive powers of government are public trustees.

=== Members of the Legislature ===
In The Federalist Papers #57, Alexander Hamilton defended the concept of a House of Representatives within the new Constitution by referring to those elected representatives as holding a public trust, obtained through election, and held accountable to the people through term limits.
=== The Executive ===
In The Federalist Papers #70 Alexander Hamilton addresses the Presidency in a discussion over having more than one executive, referring to the &quot;magistry&quot; being an elective office, as a public trust:

George Washington opened his farewell address in 1796 inviting the people to elect a new executive to his &quot;important trust:&quot;
=== The Constitution ===

A Public Trust is the term used when referring to elected officials in the United States Constitution, to differentiate them from civil officers. For example, the No Religious Test clause of Article VI includes both civil officers (commissioned either by the President
 or the Constitution) and elected officials directly: 

Founding Father Thomas Jefferson is popularly cited for his statement in a letter to Baron von Humboldt:
Public trust is different from an &quot;office of trust&quot;, which is an officer. The descriptive term &quot;public&quot; is referring to public ownership of the trust.

In 1892 the United States Supreme Court found in Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Illinois that states have public ownership of all submerged land in navigable waters, determining that states manage these lands in trust for the citizens and that no state legislature can abdicate its authority as the trustee of these resources. This added natural resources to the concept of public trust. Certain cultural resources were later also added as a public trust.

==Use in the Philippines==

In the Philippines, &quot;betrayal of public trust&quot; is one of the impeachable offenses. In &quot;Francisco, Jr. vs. Nagmamalasakit na mga Manananggol ng mga Manggagawang Pilipino, Inc.,&quot; the Supreme Court of the Philippines ruled that the definition of &quot;betrayal of public trust&quot; is &quot;a non-justiciable political question which is beyond the scope of its judicial power&quot; under the Constitution. It did not prescribe which branch of government has the power to define it, but implies that Congress, which handles impeachment cases, has the power to do so.

<text>In Christianity and Judaism, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (, ; ) is one of two specific trees in the story of the Garden of Eden in Genesis 2–3, along with the tree of life. Alternatively, some scholars have argued that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is just another name for the tree of life.

==In Genesis==

===Narrative===
Genesis 2 narrates that God places the man, Adam, in a garden with trees whose fruits he may eat, but forbids him to eat from &quot;the tree of the knowledge of good and evil&quot;. God forms a woman, Eve, after this command is given. In Genesis 3, a serpent persuades Eve to eat from its forbidden fruit and she also lets Adam taste it. Consequently, God expels them from the garden.

===Meaning of &quot;good and evil&quot;===
The phrase in Hebrew, () literally translates as &quot;good and evil&quot;. This may be an example of the type of figure of speech known as merism, a literary device that pairs opposite terms together in order to create a general meaning, so that the phrase &quot;good and evil&quot; would simply imply &quot;everything&quot;. This is seen in the Egyptian expression &quot;evil-good&quot;, which is normally employed to mean &quot;everything&quot;. However, if &quot;tree of the knowledge of good and evil&quot; is to be understood to mean a tree whose fruit imparts knowledge of everything, this phrase does not necessarily denote a moral concept. This view is held by several scholars.

Given the context of disobedience to God, other interpretations of the implications of this phrase also demand consideration. Robert Alter emphasizes the point that when God forbids the man to eat from that particular tree, he says that if he does so, he is &quot;doomed to die.&quot; The Hebrew behind this is in a form regularly used in the Hebrew Bible for issuing death sentences.

However, there are myriad modern scholarly interpretations regarding the term (&quot;Hada&#x27;at tov wa-ra&quot; &quot;the knowledge of good and evil&quot;) in Genesis 2–3, such as wisdom, omniscience, sexual knowledge, moral discrimination, maturity, and other qualities. According to scholar Nathan French, the term likely means &quot;the knowledge for administering reward and punishment,&quot; suggesting that the knowledge forbidden by Yahweh and yet acquired by the humans in Genesis 2–3 is the wisdom for wielding ultimate power.

==Religious views==

===Judaism===
Jewish sources suggest different possible identities for the tree: a fig tree (as fig leaves were used to clothe Adam and Eve after the sin), a grape vine (as &quot;nothing brings wailing to the world like wine&quot;), a stalk of wheat (as &quot;a child does not know how to say Father and Mother until he tastes grain&quot;), an etrog (as the description in matches the etrog fruit&#x27;s beautiful appearance, or else the etrog tree&#x27;s allegedly tasty bark), or a nut tree.

In Jewish tradition, the Tree of Knowledge and the eating of its fruit represents the beginning of the mixture of good and evil together. Before that time, the two were separate, and evil had only a nebulous existence in potential. While free choice did exist before eating the fruit, evil existed as an entity separate from the human psyche, and it was not in human nature to desire it. Eating and internalizing the forbidden fruit changed this, and thus was born the , the evil inclination.

According to Rashi, the sin came about because Eve added an additional clause to the divine command: &quot;Neither shall you touch it.&quot; By saying this, Eve added to YHWH&#x27;s command, and thereby came to detract from it, as it is written: &quot;Do not add to His Words&quot; (). However, In &quot;Legends of the Jews&quot;, it was Adam who had devoutly forbidden Eve to touch the tree even though God had only mentioned the eating of the fruit.

According to one source, Eve also fed the fruit to the animals, leading to their mortality as well.

In the Kabbalah, the sin of the Tree of Knowledge (called ) brought about the great task of , sifting through the mixture of good and evil in the world to extract and liberate the sparks of holiness trapped therein. Since evil no longer had independent existence, it henceforth depended on holiness to draw down the Divine life-force, on whose &quot;leftovers&quot; it then feeds and derives existence. Once evil is separated from holiness through , its source of life is cut off, causing the evil to disappear. This is accomplished through observance of the 613 commandments in the Torah, which deal primarily with physical objects wherein good and evil are mixed together. The sin of the Tree caused God&#x27;s presence (Shechinah) to depart from earth; in kabbalah, the task of rectifies the sin of the Tree and causes the Shechinah to return.

===Christianity===

In Christian tradition, consuming the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil was the original sin committed by Adam and Eve that led to the fall of man in Genesis 3.

Augustine of Hippo taught that the &quot;tree&quot; should be understood both symbolically and as a real tree – similarly to Jerusalem being both a real city and a figure of Heavenly Jerusalem. Augustine underlined that the fruits of that tree were not evil by themselves, because everything that God created &quot;was good&quot; (). It was disobedience of Adam and Eve, who had been told by God not to eat off the tree (), that caused disorder in the creation, thus humanity inherited sin and guilt from Adam and Eve&#x27;s sin.

In Western Christian art, the fruit of the tree is commonly depicted as the apple, which originated in central Asia. This depiction may have originated as a Latin pun: by eating the (apple), Eve contracted (evil). According to the Bible, there is nothing to show the forbidden fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was necessarily an apple.

===Gnosticism===
Uniquely, the Gnostic religion held that the tree was entirely positive or even sacred. Per this saga, it was the archons who told Adam and Eve not to eat from its fruit, before lying to them by claiming they would die after tasting it. Later in the story, an instructor is sent from the Pleroma by the aeons to save humanity and reveal gnosis. This savior does so by telling Adam and Eve that eating the fruit is the way into salvation. Examples of the narrative can be found within the Gnostic manuscripts On the Origin of the World and the Secret Book of John.

Manichaeism, which has been considered a Gnostic sect, echoes these notions as well, presenting the primordial aspect of Jesus as the instructor.

===Islam===

The Quran never refers to the tree as the &quot;tree of the knowledge of good and evil&quot; but rather typically refers to it as &quot;the tree&quot; or (in the words of Iblis) as the &quot;tree of immortality.&quot; Muslims believe that when God created Adam and Eve, he told them that they could enjoy everything in the Garden except this tree and so Satan appeared to them, telling them the only reason God forbade them to eat from the tree was that they would become angels or immortal.

When they ate from this tree, their nakedness appeared to them, and they began to sew together leaves from the Garden for their covering. The Quran mentions the sin as being a &#x27;slip&#x27;. Consequently, they repented to God and asked for his forgiveness, and were forgiven. In Islamic tradition, the forbidden fruit is considered wheat or barley, not an apple as within Western Christian tradition.

In Quran Al-A&#x27;raf 27, God states:
==Similar depictions in Akkadian seal==
A cylinder seal, known as the Adam and Eve cylinder seal, from post-Akkadian periods in Mesopotamia ( century BCE) has been linked to the Adam and Eve story. Assyriologist George Smith (1840–1876) described the seal as having two facing figures (male and female) seated on each side of a tree, holding out their hands to the fruit, while between their backs is a serpent, giving evidence that the fall of man account was known in early times of Babylonia.

The British Museum disputes this interpretation, and holds that it is a common image from the period depicting a male deity being worshipped by a woman, with no reason to connect the scene with the Book of Genesis.

<text>Luke Vibert (born 26 January 1973) is a British electronic musician and producer, also known for his work under several aliases such as Plug and Wagon Christ. Raised in Cornwall, Vibert began releasing projects in the 1990s across varied genres, including techno, drum and bass, and trip hop. He has recorded on labels such as Rephlex, Ninja Tune, Planet Mu, and Warp.

==Early years: 1990s==
Vibert&#x27;s first musical output was in a variety of bands, including a punk act called Five Minute Fashion and later a Beastie Boys-esque group called the Hate Brothers, but he quickly moved into the low-cost environment of solo electronic composition.

Vibert grew up in Cornwall and attended the Wesleyan Methodist Truro School along with a number of key members of Aphex Twin&#x27;s Rephlex Records crew. Luke and another school friend, Jeremy Simmonds, released an album on Rephlex under the name of &quot;Vibert/Simmonds&quot; which attracted attention from the Rising High music label. As a result of the popularity of the style in the early 1990s, Rising High commissioned an ambient music album from Vibert, who delivered &quot;Phat Lab Nightmare&quot; under the alias Wagon Christ in 1993.

Vibert pioneered the &quot;drill &#x27;n&#x27; bass&quot; subgenre, which experimented with jungle and drum &#x27;n&#x27; bass breakbeats, on his 1995 EPs under the name Plug. He would go on further over the next few years to produce more music under the Wagon Christ name for Rising High and Ninja Tune.

==2000 and onwards==
In late 1999 and 2000, Vibert began touring with BJ Cole to promote their fusion album &quot;Stop the Panic&quot;. In 2002, he would begin a series of live collaborations with Aphex Twin. Although Aphex Twin and Luke Vibert never released an album together, Aphex Twin used the song name &quot;Analord&quot;, from Vibert&#x27;s album &quot;Lover&#x27;s Acid&quot;, for a series of EPs. Vibert&#x27;s later releases varied in style as he released albums under various names, including Plug, Amen Andrews, Kerrier District and Spac Hand Luke. &quot;Amen Andrews&quot; is a word play on the name of Irish game show host Eamonn Andrews, referring to the fact that each Amen Andrews track uses the Amen break. In 2004, Vibert explored acid disco when he remixed a Black Devil song, which was released on &quot;Disco Club (Remix)&quot; and released his first album under the alias Kerrier District.

In 2006, Vibert&#x27;s song &quot;Shadows&quot; was featured on the DJ mix album &quot;A Bugged Out Mix&quot; by Miss Kittin, which charted at number one-hundred seventy on the French Albums Chart.

In 2007 he founded a club night with Posthuman called &quot;I Love Acid&quot; after his track. In 2019 it won Best British Club Event in the DJ Mag awards. A vinyl-only record label of the same name was founded in 2014, with Luke contributing two EPs and an album &quot;Valvable&quot; written entirely on three pieces of Roland equipment: TB303, TR808, and JX3P. 

In 2015, he participated in the musical transmedia &quot;Soundhunters&quot; broadcast on the Franco-German channel Arte. For this project, Vibert appeared in the film &quot;Speak the way you breathe&quot; directed by the American film director Antonino D&#x27;Ambrosio and composed an original music of the same name.

<text>HammerFall is a Swedish power metal band from Gothenburg. The band was formed in 1993 by ex-Ceremonial Oath guitarist Oscar Dronjak.

==History==

=== Early days (1993–1996) ===
HammerFall was formed when guitarist Oscar Dronjak quit Ceremonial Oath and invited Jesper Strömblad (from Ceremonial Oath and In Flames) to join him as a drummer in a new musical project he had been contemplating for some time. Dronjak had already composed the song &quot;Steel Meets Steel,&quot; which was later included on HammerFall&#x27;s debut album. Dronjak and Strömblad were later joined by lead guitarist Niklas Sundin, bassist Johan Larsson, and vocalist Mikael Stanne. When Niklas Sundin and Johan Larsson left HammerFall the following year, Glenn Ljungström (then guitarist of In Flames) and Fredrik Larsson (bassist of the former Swedish death metal band Dispatched), replaced them.
All five members played in other bands at the time. Dronjak and Larsson played in &quot;Crystal Age&quot;; Strömblad and Ljungström played in In Flames and Stanne sang for Dark Tranquillity. Both of these bands influenced Swedish melodic death metal. HammerFall was relegated to being a side project of them all for several years. Their concerts were limited mostly to a local music contest named &quot;Rockslaget&quot;. The band had few songs of their own and played mostly covers from bands such as Pretty Maids, Judas Priest and Alice Cooper.

In 1996, HammerFall reached the semi-finals of &quot;Rockslaget&quot;. When Mikael Stanne could not perform with the band in the semi-finals, they found Joacim Cans, who agreed to play with them for the night. The concert was a success although the judges disqualified HammerFall for the finals. By the end of that day, Joacim had already been made an official member of the band.

===&quot;Glory to the Brave&quot; and &quot;Legacy of Kings&quot; (1997–1999)===
To give more exposure to their work and try for a professional recording deal, a short live performance was recorded and sent to the Dutch label, Vic Records. The musicians soon received a deal and spent the whole of the following year writing the album &quot;Glory to the Brave&quot;. The album was initially released in the Netherlands and obtained positive feedback; it is also worthy of notice that the band&#x27;s mascot, the paladin Hector, first appeared on the cover of this album.

As HammerFall grew in popularity, the time available for members of the band to dedicate to other projects became limited. Dronjak and Cans wanted to pursue the path of HammerFall (Dronjak&#x27;s Crystal Age had ceased to exist some time ago), but Strömblad and Ljungström were committed to In Flames and Larsson was committed to the thrash metal band &quot;None&quot;. Thus, HammerFall&#x27;s line-up soon underwent changes. Stefan Elmgren assumed the lead guitar and Patrik Räfling assumed the drums (they joined the band in the beginning of 1997 before the release of &quot;Glory to the Brave&quot; album) and Larsson decided to remain in the band until a suitable replacement for him was found. This happened in May 1997, when bassist Magnus Rosén joined the band. Stefan Elmgren played some of the guitars on the &quot;Glory to the Brave&quot; album (such as the acoustic guitars on &quot;I Believe&quot;) and Patrik Räfling actually played the drums on all songs in place of Jesper. However, at the time they were considered as guest performers, not members of the band.
In early 1997, German label Nuclear Blast approached HammerFall with a contract for a European release deal, which included four albums. The deal was accepted and the band proceeded to record their first two music videos — &quot;HammerFall&quot; and &quot;Glory to the Brave&quot;. After the release of a promotional single, &quot;Glory to the Brave&quot; was released throughout Europe. The results were quite unexpected, even after the intense marketing campaign made by Nuclear Blast. The album reached position number 38 on the German Music Chart on the week of its release, something which had never before been achieved by a debut heavy metal music album.

Siding with bands Gamma Ray, Jag Panzer, Lake of Tears and Raven, several tours through the European continent ensued. The concert on Wacken Open Air was performed to a crowd of over ten thousand people.

Towards the end of 1997, &quot;Glory to the Brave&quot; was released in Japan and the United States. Sales of the album reached one hundred thousand copies. HammerFall was also nominated for the Swedish Grammy award in the &quot;Best Hard Rock act&quot; category.

In February 1998 they did a small club tour (5 gigs) in Belgium and the Netherlands. Support was the Belgian band Double Diamond, who later became Fireforce

In February 1998, the recording of &quot;Legacy of Kings&quot; began. This album was once more written by Joacim, Oscar, and Jesper, who despite having quit the band still took part in the process in order to keep the same general mood of their first release. The album was produced by Fredrik Nordström (from Dream Evil) and Oscar, with the help of Joacim. The band spent a total of one and a half months in the studio recording this album.

HammerFall made some expressive concerts before the release of &quot;Legacy of Kings&quot;, playing in festivals together with bands such as Alice Cooper, Rammstein, Deep Purple, Dream Theater, Saxon and Stratovarius.

Their first world tour took place in October 1998. During the shows in Sweden, Joacim Cans caught a serious throat infection which made it impossible for him to sing. Shortly afterwards, Magnus Rosén was afflicted with the same disease, and after him the whole of HammerFall&#x27;s support crew became sick. The members of the band played for as long as possible and then were forced to postpone or cancel a few dates. During their passage through South America, HammerFall took a short break to visit the Brazilian beaches, but they soon resumed their tour.

By the end of that tour, drummer Patrik Räfling left the band, and Anders Johansson, a friend of Magnus Rosén, joined as a touring musician. In the beginning of 1999 he was made a permanent member of the band. Anders had previously worked with guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen on Rising Force in the 80s and 90s and on a number of other projects; he is the brother of Jens Johansson from Stratovarius. He has been praised for his technical and polyrhythmical talent, in metal as well as other genres.

===&quot;Renegade&quot; and &quot;Crimson Thunder&quot; (2000–2003)===
After a long series of concerts, the band returned to Sweden in order to spend time with their families and begin writing songs for their next album. HammerFall made arrangements for this album to be recorded by Michael Wagener, who had previously produced bands such as Accept, Alice Cooper and Ozzy Osbourne. The recording took eight weeks, and the album was entitled &quot;Renegade&quot;. The switch from producer Fredrik Nordström to Wagener was met with skepticism from the media in general. However, after the release, critics were mostly positive, even though there was a consensus that the band&#x27;s sound was remarkably different. A music video by director Roger Johansson was created for the song &quot;Renegade&quot; and reached the top of the Swedish parade; the same soon happened with the album itself, which reached gold status with over forty thousand copies sold.

Oscar stated on www.metalrules.com just prior to the release of &#x27;Renegade&#x27; that they were going for a more &quot;commercial&quot; sound in order to attract a broader audience that otherwise would have been lost to them and that future albums wouldn&#x27;t follow in this mold.

The band&#x27;s second world tour began in January 2001. Concerts from this tour counted with a replica version of the album&#x27;s cover on stage. It was set up as a castle in ruins from which the musicians entered the stage. In total, the tour included almost sixty shows.

The band then released a DVD entitled &quot;The Templar Renegade Crusades&quot;, which included video footage from recording sessions, live concerts, tour backstages, and encounters with fans. The footage ranged from the recording sessions of &quot;Legacy of Kings&quot; to the gold album party which took place in November 2001.

HammerFall then proceeded to record their fourth album — &quot;Crimson Thunder&quot;. Arrangements were made for recording sessions to take place in both &quot;JM Studios&quot;: from Charlie Bauerfeind, in &quot;Wisseloord Studios&quot; — in the Netherlands, and studio &quot;Blind Guardian&quot; — in Germany, for the bass.

By the end of the recording sessions in 2002, a listening session for the press was held. Overall, the reactions were quite positive, and most seemed to perceive the album as a change for the better from &quot;Renegade&quot;. A single for the song &quot;Hearts on Fire&quot; was released six weeks prior to the album&#x27;s launch and remained for weeks on the number one spot on the parades of some European countries. The song also attracted a number of new fans to the band due to its chorus-driven melody and simple riffs coupled with fast guitar solos.

The shooting of the music video &quot;Hearts on Fire&quot; by director Roger Johansson was scheduled for August of that year. The band&#x27;s plans, however, had to be held back for a week due to an incident that occurred one night. While Joacim was drinking with his girlfriend in a rock club he had been frequenting for over a decade, he was attacked by an unidentified person who hit him in the head with a beer glass and hastily escaped. Joacim instantly lost consciousness and had to be taken to a hospital, in which he underwent plastic surgery and rested for a couple of days. As soon as it became medically possible, he joined the band to record the music video.

In order to promote the release of the band&#x27;s album in North America, they toured with Dio during November and December 2002. Subsequently, the manager of the band disappeared, taking the entirety of the tour&#x27;s revenue with him. Despite this the tour was very successful, and proceeded to Europe. Changes were made to the band&#x27;s stage setting, and many investments were made on fireworks and on the presence of the mascot Hector on stage. The scenery on the cover of the single &quot;Hearts on Fire&quot; was also reproduced and added to the performances. The tour progressed to Japan and then to South America. HammerFall was present on festivals in Germany, Spain and the Czech Republic, playing with bands such as Iron Maiden, Slayer, Twisted Sister, U.D.O. and Stratovarius.

HammerFall&#x27;s tour was brought to a sudden end when Oscar Dronjak suffered a motorcycle accident, breaking his left arm and sustaining several minor injuries.

They were then left with no choice but to take a break. Stefan dedicated himself to getting a pilot license, Magnus and Anders continued working on their side projects and Joacim began work on his solo album and had his first child. Oscar simply focused on recovering. Together with a group of specialists, he was able to recover to his full capacities. He then joined Anders, Joacim, Stefan again, with bands Helloween, Gamma Ray and Pretty Maids, amongst others, and played in the celebration of the 20 years of the German rock club &quot;Rockfabrik&quot;.

===&quot;Chapter V: Unbent, Unbowed, Unbroken&quot; and &quot;Threshold&quot; (2005–2008)===
The live album and DVD &quot;One Crimson Night&quot; was released in February 2003. After two years of hiatus the band released &quot;Chapter V: Unbent, Unbowed, Unbroken&quot;, which was followed by a European and South American tour. A video for the song &quot;Bloodbound&quot; was made by director Roger Johansson.

On 16 October, it was reported that HammerFall (along with the band Europe) would be part of the Eurovision song contest. This rumor was refuted by lead singer Joacim Cans only a couple weeks later. Joacim was quoted as saying &quot;So there were no talks whatsoever to be part of this.&quot;
Their 6th album, titled &quot;Threshold&quot;, was released on 20 October 2006 and it went directly to a number 1 position on the Swedish charts.

On 6 March 2007, a statement was posted online at HammerFall&#x27;s official website (and his own official website), that bassist Magnus Rosén would not be involved with the band anymore. The reason for his departure stated that he was unhappy in the band and wants to focus on other projects. On his own website (and therefore with his own official statement) it was announced that Magnus was tired of the simple bassplaying he was forced to play in HammerFall, and that he was unable to bring his own material to the band. He now wants to &quot;be more creative in his career&quot;. On 10 April it was announced on the official HammerFall homepage that the replacement for Magnus is former member Fredrik Larsson, who played bass on the &quot;Glory to the Brave&quot; album.
Three new songs were recorded for the band&#x27;s first compilation album. These are &quot;Last Man Standing&quot;, &quot;Restless Soul&quot;, and &quot;The Abyss&quot;. They also rerecorded the Glory To The Brave track &quot;HammerFall&quot;. &quot;Steel Meets Steel - Ten Years of Glory&quot; was released on 12 October 2007.

On 2 April 2008, Stefan Elmgren announced his decision to leave HammerFall in order to pursue a career as a commercial pilot. His replacement is Pontus Norgren from The Poodles. On 27 June 2008, the band released the compilation album &quot;Masterpieces&quot;. The album has on it a collection of every song the band has covered, plus three new cover songs previously unreleased. This was Stefan Elmgren&#x27;s last release with the band.

===&quot;No Sacrifice, No Victory&quot; and &quot;Infected&quot; (2009–2012)===

HammerFall&#x27;s album &quot;No Sacrifice, No Victory&quot; was released in February 2009. This album features a cover song My Sharona. The Album peaked at No. 38 on the Billboard heatseakers charts.
A music video for the song &quot;Any Means Necessary&quot; was released some time before the actual release of the album. To kick off their new album, HammerFall toured all over the world with several support bands, such as fellow Swedish band Sabaton. In the summer 2010 the band played a couple of high-profile festivals throughout Europe, including Sonisphere Festival, High Voltage Festival, Metalcamp, Graspop Metal Meeting and many more. The summer tour was named &quot;Any Festival Necessary&quot;.

HammerFall&#x27;s 8th album was released on 18 May 2011 (Sweden), 20 May (Europe), and 7 June (North America), under the name &quot;Infected&quot;. After several months of recordings in Göteborg, Sweden and Nashville, TN, the new studio album was finally finished in February. The European tour followed, under the name &quot;European Outbreak&quot;. &quot;Infected&quot; is also the first HammerFall album not to feature the mascot, the knight Hector, on the cover.

In 2012, HammerFall recorded a live DVD while performing a show in Dalhalla, Sweden, that featured some former band members as well as other special guests. The DVD celebrated 15 years of the band&#x27;s existence, and was titled &quot;Gates of Dalhalla&quot;.

In 2013, HammerFall took a break and some time to spend with their families or side-works. Oscar wrote a book about HammerFall, &quot;Legenden om HammerFall&quot; (Swedish: &quot;The Legend of HammerFall), that was released on 24 October and tells of the band&#x27;s events during the past 16 years, but it still exists only in Swedish.

===&quot;(r)Evolution&quot; and &quot;Built to Last&quot; (2014–2017)===
HammerFall once again reunited with producer Fredrik Nordström. The vocals were recorded by James Michael. For the mix, Fredrik Nordström spent 3 weeks in his own Studio.

(r)Evolution was released on 29 August 2014, and stormed the charts worldwide, debuting on #1 in Sweden and on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart, as well as reaching Top 5 in several other countries. The subsequent tour, dubbed the World Wide (r)Evolution 2014-15, will see HammerFall return to Latin America together with Edguy and Gotthard, followed by a full European assasult in the beginning of 2015. The band was somewhat distraught when drummer Anders Johansson left shortly after the release of (r)Evolution, but David Wallin (Pain) was brought in as a temporary replacement to ensure that the show would go on. Around the same time, it was also decided that Fredrik would be on parental leave from September 2014 through March 2015. Former guitar player Stefan Elmgren stepped in handled the 4-string duties during that period, making this line-up a unique experience during the Latin American and European tour. 

In March 2016, the band announced that they had signed with Napalm Records. Their tenth studio album, &quot;Built to Last&quot;, was released on 4 November 2016.

On 16 December 2016, David Wallin resigned from the band to focus on his family, and the same day the band introduced their new drummer Johan Koleberg.

On 2 September 2017, it was announced that David Wallin&#x27;s family related issues had been resolved and that he was reinstated into the band.

=== &quot;Dominion&quot;, &quot;Hammer of Dawn&quot; and &quot;Avenge the Fallen&quot; (2018–present)===
On 18 December 2018, HammerFall announced their eleventh studio album &quot;Dominion&quot;. It was released on 16 August 2019.

Following a major tour in support of the album throughout Europe, and North America as a special guest of the band Sabaton, the band later announced their live album &quot;Live! Against the World&quot; which was released on October 23, 2020.

On 19 March 2021, HammerFall announced that they will join Helloween on a big European tour in 2022 and &#x27;23 called United Forces. Latin American tour dates as well as North American dates were added later on. The tour saw the band supporting their twelfth studio album, &quot;Hammer of Dawn&quot;, which was released on 25 February 2022. They released the single &quot;Brotherhood&quot; a day before the album&#x27;s release.

On 26 April 2024, the band released the first single &quot;Hail to the King&quot; and its corresponding music video. At the same time, they announced that their thirteenth studio album, &quot;Avenge the Fallen&quot;, which was released on 9 August 2024.

<doc id="174370" wikidata="Q32867" url="?curid=174370" title="Root name server">
<text>A root name server is a name server for the root zone of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet. It directly answers requests for records in the root zone and answers other requests by returning a list of the authoritative name servers for the appropriate top-level domain (TLD). The root name servers are a critical part of the Internet infrastructure because they are the first step in resolving human-readable host names into IP addresses that are used in communication between Internet hosts.

A combination of limits in the DNS and certain protocols, namely the practical size of unfragmented User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets, resulted in a decision to limit the number of root servers to thirteen server addresses. The use of anycast addressing permits the actual number of root server instances to be much larger, and is 1,733 .

==Root domain==
The DNS is a hierarchical naming system for computers, services, or any resource participating in the Internet. The top of that hierarchy is the root domain. The root domain does not have a formal name and its label in the DNS hierarchy is an empty string. All fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) on the Internet can be regarded as ending with this empty string for the root domain, and therefore ending in a full stop character (the label delimiter), e.g., &quot;&quot;. This is generally implied rather than explicit, as modern DNS software does not actually require that the terminating dot be included when attempting to translate a domain name to an IP address.

The root domain contains all top-level domains of the Internet. , it contained 1058 TLDs, including 730 generic top-level domains (gTLDs) and 301 country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) in the root domain. In addition, the domain is used for technical name spaces in the management of Internet addressing and other resources. A domain is used for testing internationalized domain names.

==Resolver operation==
When a computer on the Internet needs to resolve a domain name, it uses resolver software to perform the lookup. A resolver breaks the name up into its labels from right to left. The first component (TLD) is queried using a root server to obtain the responsible authoritative server. Queries for each label return more specific name servers until a name server returns the answer of the original query.

In practice, most of this information does not change very often over a period of hours and therefore it is cached by intermediate name servers or by a name cache built into the user&#x27;s application. DNS lookups to the root name servers may therefore be relatively infrequent. A survey in 2003 reported that only 2% of all queries to the root servers were legitimate. Incorrect or non-existent caching was responsible for 75% of the queries, 12.5% were for unknown TLDs, 7% were for lookups using IP addresses as if they were domain names, etc. Some misconfigured desktop computers even tried to update the root server records for the TLDs. A similar list of observed problems and recommended fixes has been published in RFC 4697.

Although any local implementation of DNS can implement its own private root name servers, the term &quot;root name server&quot; is generally used to describe the thirteen well-known root name servers that implement the root name space domain for the Internet&#x27;s official global implementation of the Domain Name System. Resolvers use a small 3 KB &quot;root.hints&quot; file published by Internic to bootstrap this initial list of root server addresses; in other words, root.hints is necessary to break the circular dependency of needing to know the addresses of a root name server to lookup the same address.

==Root server addresses==
There are 13 logical root name servers specified, with logical names in the form , where ranges from a to m. The choice of thirteen name servers was made because of limitations in the original DNS specification, which specifies a maximum packet size of 512 bytes when using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Technically however, fourteen name servers fit into an IPv4 packet. The addition of IPv6 addresses for the root name servers requires more than 512 bytes, which is facilitated by the EDNS0 extension to the DNS standard.

This does not mean that there are only 13 physical servers; each operator uses redundant computer equipment to provide reliable service even if failure of hardware or software occurs. Additionally, all operate in multiple geographical locations using a routing technique called anycast addressing, providing increased performance and even more fault tolerance. An informational homepage exists for every logical server (except G-Root) under the Root Server Technical Operations Association domain with web address in the form , where ranges from a to m.

Ten servers were originally in the United States; all are now operated using anycast addressing. Three servers were originally located in Stockholm (I-Root), Amsterdam (K-Root), and Tokyo (M-Root) respectively.
Older servers had their own name before the policy of using similar names was established. With anycast, most of the physical root servers are now outside the United States, allowing for high performance worldwide.


There are also several alternative namespace systems with an alternative DNS root using their own set of root name servers that exist in parallel to the mainstream name servers. The first, AlterNIC, generated a substantial amount of press.

The function of a root name server may also be implemented locally, or on a provider network. Such servers are synchronized with the official root zone file as published by ICANN, and do not constitute an alternate root.
As the root name servers are an important part of the Internet, they have come under attack several times, although none of the attacks have ever been serious enough to severely affect the performance of the Internet.

==Root server supervision==
The DNS Root Server System Advisory Committee is an ICANN committee. ICANN&#x27;s bylaws say the committee provides advice to ICANN but the committee claims no authority over the servers or server operators.

==Root zone file==
The root zone file is a small (about 2 MB) data set whose publication is the primary purpose of root name servers. This is not to be confused with the &quot;root.hints&quot; file used to bootstrap a resolver.

The root zone file is at the apex of a hierarchical distributed database called the Domain Name System (DNS). This database is used by almost all Internet applications to translate worldwide unique names such as &quot;www.wikipedia.org&quot; into other identifiers such as IP addresses.

The contents of the root zone file is a list of names and numeric IP addresses of the root domain authoritative DNS servers for all top-level domains (TLDs) such as com, org, edu, and the country code top-level domains (it also includes that info for root domain, the dot). On 12 December 2004, 773 different authoritative servers for the TLDs were listed. Later the number of TLDs increased greatly. , the root zone consisted of 1511 useful TLDs (excluded are: 55 domains that are not assigned, 8 that are retired, and 11 test domains). Other name servers forward queries for which they do not have any information about authoritative servers to a root name server. The root name server, using its root zone file, answers with a referral to the authoritative servers for the appropriate TLD or with an indication that no such TLD exists.

<doc id="174371" wikidata="Q201207" url="?curid=174371" title="Stratovarius">
<text>Stratovarius is a Finnish power metal band. Formed in 1984, they have released sixteen studio albums, six DVDs and six live albums. The band&#x27;s line-up has changed many times, with no founding member left since the departure of drummer Tuomo Lassila in 1995, and no member from their early recording days left following guitarist Timo Tolkki&#x27;s departure in 2008. Currently, the longest standing member is singer Timo Kotipelto, who joined in 1994.

The band was founded in August 1984 as Black Water, consisting of Lassila as singer and drummer, guitarist Staffan Stråhlman, bassist John Vihervä, and, later, keyboardist Antti Ikonen. In Summer 1984, the band changed its name to Stratovarius, which was soon followed by line-up changes. Tolkki replaced Stråhlman in 1985, and with this line-up, the band released its first album &quot;Fright Night&quot; in 1989, with Tolkki as sole songwriter. While going through many bassists, the band released the albums &quot;Twilight Time&quot; in 1992 and &quot;Dreamspace&quot; in 1994. In 1994, Kotipelto replaced Tolkki as lead vocalist, and after the release of &quot;Fourth Dimension&quot; in 1995, Lassila and Ikonen and both left the band and were replaced by Jörg Michael and Jens Johansson respectively.

This line-up, sometimes identified as the &quot;classic line-up&quot; of Stratovarius, lasted ten years and saw the releases of eight albums, including most of their popular works, until Tolkki&#x27;s departure in 2008; Tolkki had originally intended to disband Stratovarius, but allowed the rest of the band to continue Stratovarius without him at their request. The band&#x27;s following albums were all positively received, and were acknowledged as a return to form for the band. The current line-up, which has remained the same since the arrival of drummer Rolf Pilve in 2012, is the longest in the band&#x27;s history.

==History==
=== Early years (1984–1990)===
Black Water was founded in August 1984 in Finland. They went through a number of personnel and style changes before the band found its own voice. The founding members were Tuomo Lassila, Staffan Stråhlman, and John Vihervä. By 1985, the band had disbanded and reformed as Stratovarius (a portmanteau of Stratocaster and Stradivarius, which is also the name of an early Kraftwerk song), with guitarist/vocalist Timo Tolkki entering the band in December of that year, replacing Stråhlman. In 1988 they released their first two singles, &quot;Future Shock&quot; and &quot;Black Night&quot;. In 1989 their debut album &quot;Fright Night&quot; was released, which would be accompanied by a small tour of Europe.

===&quot;Twilight Time&quot;, &quot;Dreamspace&quot; and &quot;Fourth Dimension&quot; (1991–1995)===
In 1991 the group released their second album, which was initially released under the name &quot;Stratovarius II&quot; but was later re-released in 1992 with the name &quot;Twilight Time&quot;. On this album, Tolkki played bass as well as guitar on all tracks, despite Jari Behm receiving credit on the album. After &quot;Twilight Time&quot; was released, Behm was fired and replaced with Jari Kainulainen.

After releasing their third album &quot;Dreamspace&quot; in 1994, Timo Tolkki decided to step down from the lead singer position of the band to concentrate on guitar and songwriting as well as to move Stratovarius in a new direction. &quot;Dreamspace&quot; was the last album that followed the style of the band&#x27;s initial releases before the group adopted the more neo-classical/symphonic style which they became famous for.

The band started auditions for a new singer, eventually choosing Timo Kotipelto. In 1995, the band released their first album with Kotipelto on vocals &quot;Fourth Dimension&quot;, which was accompanied by a music video for the song &quot;Against the Wind&quot;. This was the last album with a singing performance by Timo Tolkki, being featured as a backing vocalist on this album. This was the first album that showed signs of the new direction the band was heading, with tracks such as &quot;Twilight Symphony&quot; using an orchestra for the first time in their recordings.

===Departures of Tuomo Lassila and Antti Ikonen, &quot;Episode&quot;, &quot;Visions&quot; and &quot;Destiny&quot; (1996–1999)===
That same year, 1995, Tuomo Lassila, the last member of Black Water, along with Antti Ikonen were fired from the band. This decision was, as Tolkki referred to years later shortly after leaving the band in 2008, &quot;due to a non-dedication to the band&#x27;s activities. They both were not at all into heavy metal and I don&#x27;t think they ever thought that the band could become so successful. They didn&#x27;t like the direction the music was heading.&quot;

This left Tolkki and Stratovarius searching for a new drummer and keyboardist to fill their places. Jörg Michael from Rage was hired as their drummer and soon after, Jens Johansson of Yngwie Malmsteen-fame was hired as keyboardist, a position he has held to this date. This new line-up released &quot;Episode&quot;, an album that showcased their new symphonic direction with a full orchestra and choir utilized on tracks such as &quot;Season of Change&quot; and &quot;Forever&quot;. The line-up on this album proved to be their most stable, remaining the same until the release of &quot;Polaris&quot; in 2009.

In 1997 the band released their sixth studio album titled &quot;Visions&quot;. This album was released to a very positive reception and featured notable songs &quot;The Kiss of Judas&quot;, &quot;Black Diamond&quot; and the title track &quot;Visions (Southern Cross)&quot;, a 10-minute epic that was their longest song at the time. &quot;Black Diamond&quot; has since become one of their most recognized songs, and has been included in almost all live setlists since its release. In the same year, the band recorded the album &quot;Destiny&quot;, which reached No. 1 on the Finnish charts. &quot;Destiny&quot; contained &quot;S.O.S.&quot; and &quot;Rebel&quot;, as well as the 10-minute title track &quot;Destiny&quot;.

===&quot;Infinite&quot;, &quot;Intermission&quot; and &quot;Elements&quot;, &quot;Pts. 1&quot; &amp; &quot;2&quot; (2000–2003)===
In 2000, the album &quot;Infinite&quot; was released. Just like its predecessor, &quot;Infinite&quot; reached No.1 in the Finnish chart, the last time one of their albums would do so until the release of &quot;Elysium&quot; in 2011. Continuing the trend of featuring lengthy symphonic pieces, the titular track &quot;Infinity&quot; is over 9 minutes long. Featured songs are &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot; and &quot;A Million Light Years Away&quot;.
The following year saw the release of &quot;Intermission&quot; a compilation album of B-Sides, bonus tracks from previous albums and unreleased material. During this time, the band decided to take a break from working on new material for Stratovarius. It was in this time that Timo Tolkki released his second solo album &quot;Hymn to Life&quot; and guest appeared on the Avantasia album &quot;The Metal Opera&quot; (Tolkki would later play guest guitar on the sequel album &quot;The Metal Opera Part II&quot;). Timo Kotipelto also began his side project Kotipelto, with the first album &quot;Waiting for the Dawn&quot; getting released in 2002.

In 2002 the band started work on their next project titled &quot;Elements&quot;. Initially conceived as a double album, the project was eventually split into two different releases, with &quot;Elements Pt. 1&quot; and &quot;Elements Pt. 2&quot; both being released the same year in 2003. This would contain some of the group&#x27;s most ambitious work yet, with the title track &quot;Elements&quot; on &quot;Elements Pt. 1&quot; clocking in at 12 minutes, the longest song the band would write until the release of &quot;Elysium&quot; in 2011. &quot;Elements&quot; was also the first, and so far only attempt at recording a double-album, and showed the band experimenting with their musical style.

===Hiatus, &quot;Stratovarius&quot; and Tolkki&#x27;s departure (2004–2008)===
During this period, tensions were increasing in the band, and in 2004 Stratovarius temporarily disbanded after Timo Tolkki suffered a nervous breakdown. A couple of months after the breakdown, Tolkki was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and went into rehabilitation for a period. During this time, Timo Kotipelto released his second album with his side project Kotipelto titled &quot;Coldness&quot;. It was also during this time that Stratovarius orchestrated a series of publicity stunts, including Kotipelto being fired and replaced by a female singer named &quot;Miss K&quot; (Katriina Wiiala), as well as Tolkki being stabbed at a concert. Eventually, the stunts were revealed to be a hoax, and Tolkki reunited the band to begin work on their next album. In 2005, the self-titled album &quot;Stratovarius&quot; was released to hostile reception by fans. &quot;Stratovarius&quot; featured a very different style compared to previous efforts, containing almost no symphonic or neo-classical elements in the music or soloing of Tolkki and Johansson that fans were used to, and did not feature any lengthy epics. Tolkki was also highly critical of the album, and &quot;Stratovarius&quot; was proof of the relationship between band members at an all-time low. Seemingly against Tolkki&#x27;s wishes, Jari Kainulainen was fired in 2005 following the release of the album for reasons Tolkki said were &quot;so absurd that I am not even [going to] try and explain them here&quot;. Kainulainen was quickly replaced with Lauri Porra, and in 2006 the band began work on a new album that was tentatively titled R...R... However, as internal issues increased, the project stalled. Eventually, the band reached a divide, with Johansson and Porra supporting Tolkki on one side, and Kotipelto and Michael on the other. Finally, on 4 March 2008, Tolkki officially declared that he was disbanding Stratovarius:

:&quot;It is time to stop the silence and announce what some of you have already been speculating. Stratovarius is no more...&quot;

As Tolkki held the rights to the name Stratovarius and all its royalties, it was his initial intention to completely disband Stratovarius. However, on 20 May 2008 he agreed to sign over the rights to the name Stratovarius and all its royalties to Timo Kotipelto, Jens Johansson and Jörg Michael (though Michael was initially against using the name Stratovarius), allowing Stratovarius to continue on without him. Tolkki later took the songs he wrote for the R...R... sessions and formed the band Revolution Renaissance, using the R...R... to form the name of the band, instead of the album. Stratovarius eventually found a replacement guitarist with Matias Kupiainen, and soon after began work on their next album.

===First years without Tolkki: &quot;Polaris&quot; and &quot;Elysium&quot; (2009–2012)===
In 2009 came the release of &quot;Polaris&quot;, which reached No. 2 in Finland. It was the first album after the departure of Timo Tolkki and Jari Kainulainen, and featured in their place new guitarist Matias Kupiainen and bassist Lauri Porra. The album yielded the two singles &quot;Deep Unknown&quot; and &quot;Higher We Go&quot;. In 2010 the album was re-released along with various live material recorded during the Polaris Tour.

In September 2010, Stratovarius announced the start of recording of their second album with Matias Kupiainen on guitar. Before officially launching the album, the &quot;Darkest Hours&quot; EP was released with the new songs &quot;Darkest Hours&quot; and &quot;Infernal Maze&quot;, plus two live recordings of older songs. To promote the new album, Stratovarius toured as guests on Helloween&#x27;s Seven Sinners Tour. As Stratovarius&#x27;s drummer Jörg Michael was diagnosed with cancer, he was temporarily replaced by Alex Landenburg in the band.

In 2011, the band released their new album titled &quot;Elysium&quot; that quickly reached No. 1 in Finland, the first of their albums to reach No.1 since &quot;Infinite&quot;. Notable songs on the album include the singles &quot;Darkest Hours&quot;, &quot;Under Flaming Skies&quot;, and the 18-minute epic &quot;Elysium&quot;, the longest song that Stratovarius has ever recorded.

Jörg Michael has announced his plans to leave the band for personal reasons. Jörg played all the remaining tour dates until 31 January in Guatemala City, and celebrated with a special Finnish &quot;Farewell Jörg&quot; tour from 18 to 26 November.

In March 2012, the band announced a drummer search on their Facebook page.
On 20 June 2012, the band announced that Rolf Pilve is their new drummer.

On 29 June 2012, live album and DVD &quot;Under Flaming Winter Skies - Live In Tampere&quot; has been released.
It was filmed in Tampere, Finland on 19 November 2011 and that is the last release with the drummer Jörg Michael.

=== &quot;Nemesis&quot;, &quot;Eternal&quot;, &quot;Enigma: Intermission 2&quot; and &quot;Survive&quot; (2013–present)===
Their next album, &quot;Nemesis&quot;, was released on 22 February 2013. The first single, &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, was released on 25 January 2013. They also released a DVD called &quot;Nemesis Days&quot; with some Nemesis World Tour recordings in this same year.

In August 2014 the band announced they would play a few shows dedicated to their 1997 hit album &quot;Visions&quot;. During these shows, the whole album was played. The premiere of these concept shows was 12 September 2014: their headliner performance at Progpower USA in Atlanta.

On 5 December 2014 &quot;Elements Pt. 1&quot; and &quot;Elements Pt. 2&quot; were reissued as a box set which included the high quality 3CD+DVD digi-pak, a cassette including previously unreleased demo songs which are only available on this format and are not made available anywhere else, an &quot;Elements&quot; tour T-shirt as well as a reproduction of the original tour program.

On 24 April 2015, Stratovarius announced that their sixteenth studio album, &quot;Eternal&quot;, would be released on 11 September 2015. On 23 June 2015, Stratovarius unveiled Eternal&#x27;s cover, as well as the official track list of the album. On 30 July 2015, the band announced that the lead single from Eternal will be Shine in the Dark. An official lyric video featuring vocalist Timo Kotipelto was uploaded onto YouTube. In October 2015, Stratovarius embarked on a world tour to promote the new album. They began this with a European Tour of 16 countries including France, Germany, and the Netherlands. Gloryhammer and Divine Ascension were the support acts for the European leg of the tour.

On 20 May 2016, the band released their &quot;Best Of&quot; compilation, which included one previously unreleased track called &quot;Until the End of Days&quot;.

On 13 January 2018, Kotipelto discussed recent anniversary shows and also commented that the band had hoped to record a new album during spring 2018. On 10 August 2018, Stratovarius released the new song &quot;Oblivion&quot; from the upcoming compilation album &quot;&quot;, which came out 28 September 2018. It is the follow-up to 2001&#x27;s &quot;Intermission&quot;. The band supported the new album with a European tour with Tarja Turunen on the A Nordic Symphony &#x27;18 tour.

By September 2021, Stratovarius had been tracking their new album at Kotipelto&#x27;s studio. The new album &quot;Survive&quot; was released on 23 September 2022.

<doc id="174376" wikidata="Q1074621" url="?curid=174376" title="Whitewater controversy">
<text>The Whitewater controversy, Whitewater scandal, Whitewatergate, or simply Whitewater, was an American political controversy during the 1990s. It began with an investigation into the real estate investments of Bill and Hillary Clinton and their associates, Jim and Susan McDougal, in the Whitewater Development Corporation. This failed business venture was incorporated in 1979 with the purpose of developing vacation properties on land along the White River near Flippin, Arkansas.

A March 1992 &quot;New York Times&quot; article published during the 1992 U.S. presidential campaign reported that the Clintons, then governor and first lady of Arkansas, had invested and lost money in the Whitewater Development Corporation. The article stimulated the interest of L. Jean Lewis, a Resolution Trust Corporation investigator who was looking into the failure of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, also owned by Jim and Susan McDougal.

Lewis looked for connections between the savings and loan company and the Clintons, and on September 2, 1992, she submitted a criminal referral to the FBI naming Bill and Hillary Clinton as witnesses in the Madison Guaranty case. Little Rock U.S. Attorney Charles A. Banks and the FBI determined that the referral lacked merit, but Lewis continued to pursue the case. From 1992 to 1994, Lewis issued several additional referrals against the Clintons and repeatedly called the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office in Little Rock and the Justice Department regarding the case. Her referrals eventually became public knowledge, and she testified before the Senate Whitewater Committee in 1995.

David Hale, the source of criminal allegations against the Clintons, claimed in November 1993 that Bill Clinton had pressured him into providing an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons&#x27; partner in the Whitewater land deal. The allegations were regarded as questionable because Hale had not mentioned Clinton in reference to this loan during the original FBI investigation of Madison Guaranty in 1989; only after coming under indictment himself in 1993, did Hale make allegations against the Clintons. A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project. Jim Guy Tucker, Bill Clinton&#x27;s successor as governor, was convicted of fraud and sentenced to four years of probation for his role in the matter. Susan McDougal served 18 months in prison for contempt of court for refusing to answer questions relating to Whitewater.

Neither Bill Clinton nor Hillary Clinton were ever prosecuted, after three separate inquiries found insufficient evidence linking them with the criminal conduct of others related to the land deal. The matter was handled by the Whitewater Independent Counsel, Republican Kenneth Starr. The last of these inquiries came from the final Independent Counsel, Robert Ray (who replaced Starr) in 2000. Susan McDougal was granted a pardon by President Clinton before he left office.

== Nomenclature ==
The term &quot;Whitewater&quot; is sometimes used to include other controversies from the Bill Clinton administration, such as Travelgate, Filegate, and the circumstances surrounding Vince Foster&#x27;s death, that were also investigated by the Whitewater Independent Counsel.

But Whitewater proper refers only to the matters stemming from the Whitewater Development Corporation and subsequent developments.

==History==
===Origins of Whitewater Development Corporation===
Bill Clinton had known Arkansas businessman and political figure Jim McDougal since 1968, and had made a previous real estate investment with him in 1977. In the spring of 1978, McDougal proposed that the Clintons join him and his wife, Susan, in buying of undeveloped land along the south bank of the White River near Flippin, Arkansas, in the Ozark Mountains. The goal was to subdivide the site into lots for vacation homes, intended for the many people coming south from Chicago and Detroit who were interested in low property taxes, fishing, rafting, and mountain scenery. The plan was to hold the property for a few years and then sell the lots at a profit.

The four borrowed $203,000 to buy the land and subsequently transferred ownership of it to the newly created Whitewater Development Corporation, in which all four participants had equal shares. Susan McDougal chose the name &quot;Whitewater Estates&quot; and their sales pitch was, &quot;One weekend here and you&#x27;ll never want to live anywhere else.&quot; The business was incorporated on June 18, 1979.

===Failure of Whitewater Development Corporation and Castle Grande===
By the time the Whitewater lots were surveyed and available for sale at the end of 1979, interest rates had climbed to near 20%. Prospective buyers could no longer afford to buy vacation homes. Rather than take a loss on the venture, the four decided to build a model home and wait for better economic conditions.
Following the land purchase, Jim McDougal asked the Clintons for additional funds for interest payments on the loan and other expenses; the Clintons later claimed to have no knowledge of how these contributions were used. When Bill Clinton failed to win re-election in 1980, Jim McDougal lost his job as the governor&#x27;s economic aide and decided to go into banking. He acquired the Bank of Kingston in 1980 and the Woodruff Savings &amp; Loan in 1982, renaming them the Madison Bank &amp; Trust and the Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan, respectively.

In spring 1985, McDougal held a fundraiser at Madison Guaranty&#x27;s office in Little Rock that paid off Clinton&#x27;s 1984 gubernatorial campaign debt of $50,000. McDougal raised $35,000; $12,000 of that was in Madison Guaranty cashier&#x27;s checks.

In 1985, Jim McDougal invested in a local construction project called Castle Grande. The 1,000 acres (400 ha), located south of Little Rock, were priced at about $1.75 million, more than McDougal could afford on his own. According to then current law, McDougal could borrow only $600,000 from his own savings and loan, Madison Guaranty. Therefore, McDougal involved others to raise the additional funds. Among these was Seth Ward, a Madison official, who helped funnel the additional $1.15 million required. To avoid potential investigations, the money was moved back and forth among several other investors and intermediaries. Hillary Clinton, then an attorney at Rose Law Firm (which is based in Little Rock) provided legal services to Castle Grande.

In 1986, federal regulators realized that all of the funds for the real estate venture had come from Madison Guaranty; regulators called Castle Grande a sham. In July of that year, McDougal resigned from Madison Guaranty. Ward fell under investigation along with the lawyer who helped him draft the agreement. Castle Grande earned $2 million in commissions and fees for McDougal&#x27;s business associates, as well as an unknown amount in legal fees for Rose Law Firm, but in 1989, it collapsed, at a cost to the government of $4 million. This in turn helped trigger the 1989 collapse of Madison Guaranty, which federal regulators then had to take over. Taking place in the midst of the nationwide savings and loan crisis, the failure of Madison Guaranty cost the United States $73 million.

The Clintons lost between $37,000 and $69,000 on their Whitewater investment; this was less than the McDougals lost. The reasons for the unequal capital contributions by the Clintons and McDougals are unknown but the President&#x27;s critics cited the discrepancy as evidence that then-Governor Clinton was to contribute to the project in other ways.

The White House and the President&#x27;s supporters claimed that they were exonerated by the Pillsbury Report. This was a $3 million study done for the Resolution Trust Corporation by the Pillsbury, Madison &amp; Sutro law firm at the time that Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan was dissolved. The report concluded that McDougal, who had set up the deal, was the managing partner, and Bill Clinton was a passive investor in the venture; the Associated Press characterized it as &quot;generally support[ing] the Clintons&#x27; description of their involvement in Whitewater&quot;. However, Charles Patterson, the attorney who supervised the report, &quot;refused ... to call it a vindication&quot; of the Clintons, stating in testimony before the Senate Whitewater Committee that &quot;it was not our purpose to vindicate, castigate, exculpate.&quot;

===Bill Clinton&#x27;s run for president===
During Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1992 presidential run, he was asked by &quot;New York Times&quot; reporters about the failure of the Whitewater development. The subsequent &quot;New York Times&quot; article, by reporter Jeff Gerth, appeared on March 8, 1992.

===Removal of documents===
Within hours of the death of Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster in July 1993, chief White House counsel Bernard Nussbaum removed documents, some of them concerning the Whitewater Development Corporation, from Foster&#x27;s office and gave them to Maggie Williams, Chief of Staff to the First Lady. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Williams placed the documents in a safe in the Clinton residence on the third floor of the White House for five days before turning them over to the Clinton family lawyer.

=== Interference by White House officials ===
White House counsel Nussbaum was accused of obstructing both the Justice Department investigation and National Park Service investigation into Foster&#x27;s death by refusing to hand over documents found in Foster&#x27;s briefcase.

On February 25, 1994, presidential aides George Stephanopoulos and Harold M. Ickes attempted to interfere with the Madison Guaranty investigation. Stephanopoulos and Ickes had a conference call with Roger Altman in which they protested the hiring of Jay Stephens, who was heading the investigation. On the call Stephanopoulos asked if Stephens could be removed.

In April 1994 after Webster Hubbell resigned from his position as Associate Attorney General and was facing fraud charges, there was the potential that he might cooperate with Ken Starr&#x27;s investigation. During the time there was pressure for Hubbell to cooperate, Clinton&#x27;s chief of staff Mack McLarty, Clinton aide Bruce Lindsey, and Clinton friend Vernon Jordan arranged for Hubbell to be paid from consulting contracts. They did so with the approval of the first lady and President Clinton. In the Starr Report, Starr said &quot;the jobs and money paid to Mr. Hubbell by friends and contributors to the President had raised serious questions about whether such assistance was designed to influence Mr. Hubbell’s testimony about Madison-related matters&quot;.

===Subpoena of the president and his wife===

As a result of the exposé in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the Justice Department opened an investigation into the failed Whitewater deal. Media pressure continued to build, and on April 22, 1994, Hillary Clinton gave an unusual press conference under a portrait of Abraham Lincoln in the State Dining Room of the White House, to address questions on both Whitewater and the cattle futures controversy; it was broadcast live on several networks. In it, she claimed that the Clintons had a passive role in the Whitewater venture and had committed no wrongdoing, but admitted that her explanations had been vague. She said that she no longer opposed appointing a special prosecutor to investigate the matter. Afterwards, she won media praise for the manner in which she conducted herself during the press conference; &quot;Time&quot; called her &quot;open, candid, but above all unflappable...the real message was her attitude and her poise. The confiding tone and relaxed body language...immediately drew approving reviews&quot;. By that time there was growing backlash from Democrats and other members of the political left against the press&#x27; investigations of Whitewater. &quot;The New York Times&quot; was criticized by Gene Lyons of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, who felt its reporters were exaggerating the significance and possible impropriety of what they were uncovering.

At Clinton&#x27;s request, Attorney General Janet Reno appointed a special prosecutor, Robert B. Fiske, to investigate the legality of the Whitewater transactions in 1994. Two allegations surfaced: 1) that Clinton had exerted pressure on an Arkansas businessman, David Hale, to make a loan that would benefit himself and the owners of Madison Guaranty; 2) that an Arkansas bank had concealed transactions involving Clinton&#x27;s gubernatorial campaign in 1990. In May 1994, Fiske issued a grand jury subpoena to the President and his wife for all documents relating to Madison Guaranty, with a deadline of 30 days. They were reported as missing by the Clintons. Almost two years later, the subpoenaed billing records of the Rose Law Firm were discovered in the Clintons&#x27; private residence in the White House, with fingerprints of Hillary Clinton, among others.

===The Kenneth Starr investigation===
In August 1994, Kenneth Starr was appointed by a three-judge panel to continue the Whitewater investigation, replacing Robert B. Fiske, who had been specially appointed by US attorney general Janet Reno, prior to the re-enactment of the Independent Counsel law. Fiske was replaced because he had been chosen and appointed by Janet Reno, Clinton&#x27;s attorney general, creating the appearance of a conflict of interest.

====David Hale====
The key witness against President Clinton in Starr&#x27;s Whitewater investigation, was banker David Hale who alleged in November 1992 that Clinton, while governor of Arkansas, pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the partner of the Clintons in the Whitewater deal.

Attorney Randy Coleman&#x27;s defense strategy was to present Hale as the victim of high-powered politicians who forced him to give away all of the money. This characterization was undermined by testimony from November 1989, wherein FBI agents investigating the failure of Madison Guaranty had questioned Hale about his dealings with Jim and Susan McDougal, including the $300,000 loan. According to the agents&#x27; official memorandum of that interview, Hale described in some detail his dealings with Jim Guy Tucker (then an attorney in private practice, later Bill Clinton&#x27;s lieutenant governor), both McDougals, and several others, but never mentioned Governor Bill Clinton.

Clinton denied that he pressured Hale to approve the loan to Susan McDougal. By this time, Hale had already pleaded guilty to two felonies and secured a reduction in his sentence in exchange for his testimony against Bill Clinton. Charges were made by Clinton supporters that Hale had received numerous cash payments from representatives of the so-called Arkansas Project, a $2.4 million campaign established to assist in Hale&#x27;s defense strategy, and to investigate Clinton and his associates between 1993 and 1997.

These charges were the topic of a separate investigation by former Department of Justice investigator, Michael E. Shaheen Jr. Shaheen filed his report in July 1999 to Starr, who stated that the allegations that Hale had been paid in hopes of influencing his testimony were &quot;unsubstantiated or, in some cases, untrue&quot;. No further charges were brought against Hale or the Arkansas Project outlet, &quot;The American Spectator&quot;, though Hale later pled guilty in the Whitewater case to two felonies and served 21 months of a 28-month sentence. Writers from &quot;Salon&quot; have complained that the full, 168-page report had not been made public, a complaint still being reiterated by &quot;Salon&quot; as of 2001.

State prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Hale in early July 1996, charging that Hale had misrepresented the solvency of his insurance company, National Savings Life, to the state insurance commission. The prosecutors also alleged in court papers that Hale had made those misrepresentations to conceal the fact that he had looted the insurance company. Hale said that any infraction was a technicality and that no one had lost any money. In March 1999, Hale was convicted of the first charge, with the jury recommending a 21-day jail sentence.

Starr drafted an impeachment referral to the House of Representatives in the fall of 1997, alleging that there was &quot;substantial and credible evidence&quot; that Bill Clinton had committed perjury regarding Hale&#x27;s allegations. Hale pleaded guilty in the Whitewater case to two felonies and served 21 months of a 28-month sentence.

====Webster Hubbell====
Attorney Theodore B. Olson, who with several associates launched the plan that later became known as the &quot;Arkansas Project&quot;, wrote several essays for &quot;The American Spectator&quot;, accusing Clinton and many of his associates of wrongdoing. The first of those pieces appeared in February 1994, alleging a wide variety of criminal offenses by the Clintons and others, including Webster Hubbell. These allegations led to the discovery that Hubbell, a friend and former Rose Law Firm partner of Hillary Clinton, had committed multiple frauds, mostly against his own firm. Hillary Clinton, instead of being complicit in Hubbell&#x27;s crimes, had been among his victims. In December 1994, one week after Hubbell pleaded guilty to mail fraud and tax evasion, Associate White House Counsel, Jane C. Sherburne, created a &quot;Task List&quot; which included a reference to monitoring Hubbell&#x27;s cooperation with Starr. Hubbell was later recorded in prison saying to his wife, &quot;I need to roll over one more time&quot; regarding the Rose Law firm lawsuit. In his next court appearance, he pleaded the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination (see &quot;United States v. Hubbell&quot;).

In February 1997, Starr announced he would leave the investigation to pursue a position at the Pepperdine University School of Law. However, he &quot;flip flopped&quot; in the face of &quot;intense criticism&quot; by conservatives and new evidence of sexual misconduct, diverted to some degree by the burgeoning Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. Starr&#x27;s investigations in Arkansas were winding down, with his Little Rock grand jury about to expire.

====Susan McDougal====
Hubbell, Jim Guy Tucker, and Susan McDougal had all refused to cooperate with Starr. Tucker and McDougal were later pardoned by President Clinton. When the Arkansas grand jury did conclude its work in May 1998, after 30 months in panel, it came up with only a contempt indictment against Susan McDougal. Although she refused to testify under oath regarding the Clintons&#x27; involvement in Whitewater, Susan McDougal did make the case in the media that the Clintons had been truthful in their account of the loan, and had cast doubt on her former husband&#x27;s motives for cooperating with Starr. She also claimed that James McDougal felt abandoned by Clinton, and told her &quot;he was going to pay back the Clintons&quot;. She said to the press, again not under oath, that her husband had told her that Republican activist and Little Rock lawyer, Sheffield Nelson, was willing to &quot;pay him some money&quot; for talking to &quot;The New York Times&quot; about Bill Clinton, and in 1992, he told her that one of Clinton&#x27;s political enemies was paying him to tell &quot;The New York Times&quot; about Whitewater.

From the beginning, Susan McDougal charged that Starr had offered her &quot;global immunity&quot; from other charges if she would cooperate with the Whitewater investigation. McDougal told the jury that refusing to answer questions about the Clintons and Whitewater wasn&#x27;t easy for her, or her family. &quot;It&#x27;s been a long road, a very long road...and it was not an easy decision to make&quot;, McDougal told the court. McDougal refused to answer any questions while under oath, leading to her being imprisoned by the judge for civil contempt of court for the maximum 18 months, including eight months in isolation. Starr&#x27;s subsequent indictment of McDougal for &quot;criminal&quot; contempt of court charges resulted in a jury hung 7–5, in favor of acquittal. President Clinton later pardoned her, shortly before leaving office (see list of people pardoned by Bill Clinton).

====Starr Whitewater Report====
In September 1998, Independent Counsel Starr released the Starr Report, concerning offenses alleged to have been committed by President Clinton, as part of the Lewinsky scandal. The report mentioned Whitewater only in passing; Clinton friend and advisor, Vernon Jordan, Clinton aide Bruce Lindsey, and Clinton chief of staff Mack McLarty had helped Webster Hubbell financially by getting him &quot;no-show&quot; consulting contracts while he was under pressure to cooperate with the Whitewater investigations. Indeed, it was on this basis that Starr took on the Lewinsky investigation, under the umbrella of the Whitewater Independent Counsel mandate.

There was much acrimony from the most fervent critics of the Clintons, after the release of the Starr report on the Foster matter and after Starr&#x27;s departure and return to the case. The death of Foster had been the source of many conspiracy theories. Christopher Ruddy, a reporter for Richard Mellon Scaife&#x27;s &quot;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review,&quot; and later CEO of Newsmax, helped fuel much of this speculation with claims that Starr had not pursued this line of inquiry far enough.

==== Criminal referrals ====
Starr received several criminal referrals from Congress but declined to prosecute. Susan Thomases and Webster Hubbell were alleged to have lied to Congress, and Harold M. Ickes was accused of misleading Congress.

===Reaction of the Clintons===
On January 26, 1996, Hillary Clinton testified before a grand jury concerning her investments in Whitewater. This was the first time in American history that a First Lady had been subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury. She testified that they never borrowed any money from the bank, and denied having caused anyone to borrow money on their behalf.

===Reaction of Congress===
Parallel to the Independent Counsel track, both houses of the United States Congress had been investigating Whitewater and holding hearings on it. The House Committee on Financial Services had been scheduled to begin hearings in late March 1994, but they were postponed after an unusually angry, written communication from Democratic Banking Committee chair Henry B. Gonzalez to Republican Jim Leach. Gonzalez called Leach &quot;obstinate&quot;, &quot;obdurate&quot;, &quot;in willful disregard&quot; of House etiquette, and &quot;premeditatedly&quot; plotting a &quot;judicial adventure&quot;. The House Banking Committee began its hearings in late July 1994.

The Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee also began hearings on Whitewater in July 1994. These hearings intensified in May 1995, following the Republican&#x27;s gain of control, when the Republican Banking Committee chairman Al D&#x27;Amato also became chair of the newly formed Special Whitewater Committee. The Whitewater committee&#x27;s hearings were much more extensive than those held previously by the Democrats, running for 300 hours over 60 sessions across 13 months, and taking over 10,000 pages of testimony and 35,000 pages of depositions from almost 250 people. The hearings&#x27; testimony and senatorial lines of investigation mostly followed partisan lines, with Republicans investigating the President and the Democrats defending him. The Senate Special Whitewater Committee issued an 800-page majority report on June 18, 1996, which only hinted at one possible improper action by President Clinton, but spoke of the Clinton Administration as &quot;an American presidency [that] misused its power, circumvented the limits on its authority and attempted to manipulate the truth&quot;. The first lady came in for much stronger criticism, as she was &quot;the central figure&quot; in all aspects of the alleged wrongdoings. The Democratic minority on the Committee called these findings &quot;a legislative travesty&quot;, &quot;a witch hunt&quot;, and &quot;a political game&quot;.

On November 19, 1998, Independent Counsel Starr testified before the House Judiciary Committee in connection with the Impeachment of Bill Clinton over charges related to the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. Starr said that in late 1997, he had considered preparing an impeachment report regarding the fraudulent $300,000 loan to Susan McDougall and the question of whether the President had testified truthfully regarding the loan. Starr said that he held back the charges because he was not sure that the two major witnesses had told the truth, but that the investigation was still ongoing.

Regarding the reappearance of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s Rose Law Firm billing records in the White House residential section, Starr said the investigation had found no explanation for the disappearance or the reappearance. &quot;After a thorough investigation, we have found no explanation how the billing records got where they were or why they were not discovered and produced earlier. It remains a mystery to this day.&quot; Starr also chose this occasion to completely exonerate President Clinton of any wrongdoing in the Travelgate and Filegate matters; Democrats on the committee immediately criticized Starr for withholding these findings, as well as the Whitewater one, until after the 1998 Congressional elections.

==Convictions==
The Clintons were never charged with any crime. Fifteen other people were convicted of more than 40 crimes, including Jim Guy Tucker, who resigned from office.
* Jim Guy Tucker: Governor of Arkansas at the time, resigned (fraud, 3 counts)
* John Haley: attorney for Jim Guy Tucker (tax evasion)
* William J. Marks Sr.: Jim Guy Tucker&#x27;s business partner (conspiracy)
* Stephen Smith: former Governor Clinton aide (conspiracy to misapply funds). Bill Clinton pardoned.
* Webster Hubbell: Clinton political supporter; U.S. Associate Attorney General; Rose Law Firm partner (embezzlement, fraud)
* Jim McDougal: banker, Clinton political supporter: (18 felonies, varied)
* Susan McDougal: Clinton political supporter (multiple frauds). Bill Clinton pardoned.
* David Hale: banker, self-proclaimed Clinton political supporter: (conspiracy, fraud)
* Neal Ainley: Perry County Bank president (embezzled bank funds for Clinton campaign)
* Chris Wade: Whitewater real estate broker (multiple loan fraud). Bill Clinton pardoned.
* Larry Kuca: Madison real estate agent (multiple loan fraud)
* Robert W. Palmer: Madison appraiser (conspiracy). Bill Clinton pardoned.
* John Latham: Madison Bank CEO (bank fraud)
* Eugene Fitzhugh: Whitewater defendant (multiple bribery)
* Charles Matthews: Whitewater defendant (bribery)

==Tax returns==
In March 1992, during his presidential campaign, the Clintons acknowledged that on their 1984 and 1985 tax returns, they had claimed improper tax deductions for interest payments made by the Whitewater Development Company. Due to the age of the mistake, the Clintons were not obligated to make good the error, but Bill Clinton announced that they would nonetheless do so.

Deputy White House counsel Vince Foster looked into this matter, but did not take any action before his death. On December 28, 1993, almost two years after the original announcement, the Clintons did make a reimbursement payment, for $4,900, to the Internal Revenue Service. This was done just before Justice Department investigators started seeking the Clintons&#x27; Whitewater files. The payment was made without filing an amended return (possibly because the three-year period for amended return filing had passed), but did include full interest on the amount of the error, including the additional two-year delay. The Whitewater files in question, publicly released in August 1995, cast some doubt on the Clintons&#x27; assertions in the matter, as they showed that the couple was aware that the interest payments in question were paid by the Whitewater corporation, and not them personally.

==Ray report==
Kenneth Starr&#x27;s successor as Independent Counsel, Robert Ray, released a report in September 2000, that stated &quot;This office determined that the evidence was insufficient to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that either President or Mrs. Clinton knowingly participated in any criminal conduct.&quot; Nevertheless, Ray criticized the White House saying that delays in the production of evidence and &quot;unmeritorious litigation&quot; by the president&#x27;s lawyers severely impeded the investigation&#x27;s progress, leading to a total cost of nearly $60 million. Ray&#x27;s report effectively closed the Whitewater investigation.

==Aftermath==
Bill and Hillary Clinton never visited the actual Whitewater property. In May 1985, Jim McDougal sold the remaining lots of the failed Whitewater Development Corporation to local realtor, Chris Wade. By 1993, there were a few occupied houses on the site, but most of the properties were still for sale. One owner, tired of the many reporters who visited the site, hung a sign saying &quot;Go Home, Idiots&quot;. By 2007, there were about 12 houses in the subdivision, with the last lot up for sale by son, Chris Wade Jr., for $25,000. In Flippin, Arkansas, Jim McDougal&#x27;s savings and loan bank had been replaced by a variety of small businesses, most recently a barbershop.

The length, expense, and results of the Whitewater investigations turned the public against the Office of the Independent Counsel; even Kenneth Starr was opposed to it. The Independent Counsel law was allowed to expire in 1999.

<text>Gipsy Kings (originally Los Reyes) are a musical group founded in 1979 in Arles, France. The band, whose members have Catalan heritage, play a blend of Catalan rumba, flamenco, salsa, and pop. They perform mostly in Spanish but also mix in Catalan, French, and languages of southern France, such as Occitan.

Although the group members were born in France, their parents were mostly &quot;gitanos&quot; (Spanish Romani) who fled Spain during the 1930s Spanish Civil War. They are known for bringing rumba flamenca, a pop-oriented music distantly derived from traditional flamenco and rumba, to a worldwide audience, and for their interpretations of English-language pop hits.

==History==
===Beginnings: 1970s–1980s===
In the 1970s, José Reyes and Manitas de Plata were a duo who played rumba flamenca in the southern French town of Arles. When they split up, Reyes began performing with his sons, Nicolas, François (Canut), André, Patchaï, and Paul (Pablo), as José et Los Reyes (as well as being their family name, &quot;reyes&quot; means &quot;kings&quot; in Spanish). After their father&#x27;s death in 1979, the brothers continued to perform, joined by their cousins Diego, Paco, and Tonino Baliardo (nephews of Manitas de Plata), as well as French Moroccan musician Chico Bouchikhi, who was then married to Marthe Reyes, José&#x27;s daughter. Traveling around France and playing at weddings, festivals, and in the streets as a gypsy band, they adopted the moniker Gipsy Kings, with Nicolas as lead vocalist and Tonino on lead guitar. Later, they were hired to play at upper-class parties in such places as Saint-Tropez.

Their first two albums, &quot;Allegria&quot; (1982) and &quot;Luna de Fuego&quot; (1983), attracted little notice.

===Success: 1987–present===
Success came for Gipsy Kings with their self-titled third album, released in 1987 (1989 in the United States), which included the songs &quot;Djobi Djoba&quot;, &quot;Bamboléo&quot;, and the ballad &quot;Un Amor&quot;. The record spent forty weeks on the US charts, one of few Spanish-language albums to do so.

Pablo Reyes left the group in 1988, due to hearing problems.

Chico Bouchikhi, one of the group&#x27;s founding members, left in 1991 due to financial disagreements with their then-manager, Claude Martinez, and went on to start his own group, Chico &amp; the Gypsies.

Between 1989 and 2013, the band released nine studio albums: &quot;Mosaïque&quot; (1989), &quot;Este Mundo&quot; (1991), &quot;Love and Liberté&quot; (1993), &quot;Estrellas&quot; (1995), &quot;Compas&quot; (1997), &quot;Somos Gitanos&quot; (2001), &quot;Roots&quot; (2004), &quot;Pasajero&quot; (2006), and &quot;Savor Flamenco&quot; (2013). Their latest, &quot;Evidence&quot;, came out in 2018. &quot;Savor Flamenco&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Global Music Album in 2014. In 1992, they issued the concert album &quot;Live&quot;.

The band have been criticised by flamenco purists, but Nicolas Reyes has said in an interview that the flamenco world is not in great shape itself, and that the band are proud of their success. Their 1997 album, &quot;Compas&quot;, however, contains more traditional flamenco music.

==Collaborations and covers==
Gipsy Kings recorded a cover of Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;My Way&quot;, entitled &quot;A Mi Manera&quot;, which was included on their 1987 self-titled album. They covered &quot;I&#x27;ve Got No Strings&quot; for the 1991 Disney Records direct-to-video album &quot;Simply Mad About the Mouse: A Musical Celebration of Imagination&quot;. Their version of Eagles&#x27; &quot;Hotel California&quot; was an example of fast flamenco guitar leads and rhythmic strumming; it was featured in the 1998 Coen Brothers&#x27; movie, &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;. The 2010 film &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; featured their rendition of Randy Newman&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend in Me&quot; in a Spanish-language version, titled &quot;Hay un Amigo en Mi&quot;, and the group performed it in a recognizable flamenco style.

They have also collaborated with various musical artists, including Joan Baez, recording a version of &quot;A Mi Manera&quot; for her 1989 album, &quot;Speaking of Dreams&quot;. They recorded the song &quot;Get Up!&quot; with Captain Jack, from the Eurodance group&#x27;s 1999 album, &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. They published a cover of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;One Love&quot; with his son Ziggy in 2001, and they recorded a cover of the Doobie Brothers&#x27; &quot;Long Train Running&quot; with Bananarama, under the pseudonym Alma de Noche, which was included on a 2013 re-issue of the girl band&#x27;s 1991 album, &quot;Pop Life&quot;. In 2020, they featured on the song &quot;Ciclone&quot; by Takagi &amp; Ketra, with vocals by Elodie and Mariah Angeliq. A year later, they shared credits with Spanish rapper C. Tangana on the song &quot;Ingobernable&quot;, which appeared on his album &quot;El Madrileño&quot;.

==Solo projects==
Individual members of the band have toured with their own projects and released solo albums. In 1989, Canut Reyes published &quot;Boléro&quot;, and in 2012, his second album, &quot;Gitano&quot;, came out.

Tonino Baliardo released an instrumental album in 2001, titled &quot;Essences&quot;. He followed it two years later with &quot;Tonino Baliardo&quot;. In 2023, he issued &quot;Renaissance&quot;, under the name of his touring band, Gipsy Kings featuring Tonino Baliardo.

In 2022, Nicolas Reyes and Moroccan musician Saad Lamjarred collaborated to pay tribute to King Mohammed VI on Throne Day, releasing a song called &quot;Viva El Rey Habibna&quot;.

André Reyes performs with his own band, under the name Gipsy Kings by André Reyes. The group consists of André and a number of his relatives, including his son Thomas, his nephews Kakou and Tambo, his brother Patchaï, and his first cousin Mario, as well as four backing musicians. In 2022, they released the album &quot;Nací Gitano&quot;.

Patchaï Reyes performs as Gitano Family with his son.

Founding member Chico Bouchikhi tours with his band Chico &amp; the Gypsies. They have released numerous albums since 1992.

==Band members==
Gipsy Kings originally consisted of two parent families: Reyes and Baliardo. The Reyes brothers, sons of Jose Reyes, are nephews of Manitas de Plata, while the Baliardo brothers are his sons.

<text>Holy Living and Holy Dying is the collective title of two books of Christian devotion by Jeremy Taylor. They were originally published as &quot;The Rules and Exercises of Holy Living&quot; in 1650 and &quot;The Rules and Exercises of Holy Dying&quot; in 1651. &quot;Holy Living&quot; is designed to instruct the reader in living a virtuous life, increasing personal piety, and avoiding temptations. &quot;Holy Dying&quot; is meant to instruct the reader in the &quot;means and instruments&quot; of preparing for a blessed death. &quot;Holy Dying&quot; was the &quot;artistic climax&quot; of a consolatory death literature tradition that had begun with &quot;Ars moriendi&quot; in the 15th century.

== Description ==
&quot;Holy Living and Holy Dying&quot; is the collective title of two books of Christian devotion by Jeremy Taylor, originally published as &quot;The Rule and Exercises of Holy Living&quot; in 1650 and &quot;The Rule and Exercises of Holy Dying&quot; in 1651. The two books represent one of the high points of English prose during the period of the early Stuarts. According to historian Nancy Lee Beaty, &quot;Holy Dying&quot; was the &quot;artistic climax&quot; of a consolatory death literature tradition that had begun with &quot;Ars moriendi&quot; in the 15th century. Other works in this tradition include &quot;The Waye of Dying Well&quot; and &quot;The Sick Mannes Salve&quot;.

&quot;Holy Living&quot; is designed to instruct the reader in living a virtuous life, increasing personal piety, and avoiding temptations. &quot;Holy Dying&quot; is meant to instruct the reader in the &quot;means and instruments&quot; of preparing for a blessed death. Each book contains discussions of theology, moral instruction, often prefaced as &quot;The Consideration reduc&#x27;d to practise,&quot; and model prayers requesting divine assistance in achieving them.

== Morality ==
&quot;Holy Living&quot; is largely concerned with questions of practical morality, of a type that has hardly changed from the 17th century to today. The companion volume, &quot;Holy Dying&quot;, was occasioned by the death of the wife of Taylor&#x27;s patron and employer, the Earl of Carbery. That book is half Christian instruction and half memorial sermon, with Taylor displaying his gift for poetic prose. Coupled with the 17th century cult of melancholia, the result is prose that is simultaneously stately and rapturous, &quot;half in love with easeful death&quot;, and reads like prose poetry:

:But so have I seen a Rose newly springing from the clefts of its hood, and at first it was fair as the Morning, and full with the dew of Heaven, as a Lambs fleece; but when a ruder breath had forced open its virgin modesty, and dismantled its too youthful and unripe retirements, it began to put on a darknesse, and to decline its softnesse, and the symptomes of a sickly age; it bowed the head, and broke its stalk, and at night having lost some of its leaves, and all of its beauty, it fell into the portion of weeds and outworn faces. (See also period (rhetoric)).

== Legacy ==
Taylor&#x27;s work was much admired by John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, for its devotional quality; and by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Thomas De Quincey, and Edmund Gosse for its literary qualities. John Osborne said that the book demonstrates how the English language can be used &quot;beautifully and simply&quot;.

<doc id="174380" wikidata="Q3321113" url="?curid=174380" title="Unicycle trials">
<text>Unicycle trials is a form of unicycling which involves participants attempting to ride a unicycle over obstacles without any part of the rider touching the ground.

The obstacles traversed can be set up specifically for the purpose of unicycle trials, but are often walls, railings, ledges and other &quot;street furniture&quot; found in an urban environment. The sport is derived from (or at least inspired by) bike trials and motorcycle trials.

Obstacles are traversed using various moves. Hopping is achieved by suddenly forcing the unicycle pedals downwards while holding the seat, the reactive forces resulting from the compression of the tyre lift the unicycle into the air. Jumping is a similar to hopping, except that the unicycle seat is held in front of the rider to allow greater height to be achieved. Pedal grabs and crank grabs involve a hop or jump to land the unicycles pedal or crank on the edge of an object, and then a second hop or jump to land the unicycle fully on the object.

Although unicycle trials can be performed on a standard unicycle, many are not designed for the forces which are caused by unicycle trials. A trials unicycle is built with unicycle trials in mind, and is therefore designed to better cope with these stresses.

==Trials unicycle==


A &quot;trials unicycle&quot; is a unicycle designed for unicycle trials. Trials unicycles are stronger than standard unicycles in order to withstand the stresses caused by jumping, dropping, and supporting the weight of the unicycle and rider on components such as the pedals and cranks.

The wheel diameter on a trials unicycle is usually 19″ or 20″, as this allows greater maneuverability due to the short circumference of the wheel. Most Trials unicycles come with 19″ rear rims as used on 20″ (or mod) trials bicycles. This allows for larger tyres to be fitted which can help provide bounce and preload for jumping, and aid stability being generally quite wide (some up to 2.5 inches).
A smaller wheel also means the unicycle is lighter, although some riders prefer larger wheels. The tire is generally wide and thick, giving a large air volume. This is to cushion drops and allow large hops and jumps. The tire will often have a deep tread to allow greater grip to obstacles. Strong high tension spokes and a strong rim wheel rim is used to prevent the wheel from deforming under the great stresses exerted on it by jumping. Unicycle wheels have to withstand large lateral stresses because, unlike in conventional riding, the rider may jump sideways. Many trials unicycles have a splined hub and cranks, as this design tends to be more resistant to bending and breaking than the more common cotterless, or square taper, equivalent. Long cranks give the rider extra torque and pedals with a large amount of grip (often with pins or teeth) are used to prevent the rider&#x27;s feet from slipping. Unicycles with shorter cranks are generally referred to as street unicycles, as they let the rider keep up their momentum easier and do smooth tricks. Whereas Trials unicycles usually have longer cranks that are better for hopping, as the rider has better control of the rotation of the wheel, and can therefore keep the unicycle from slipping out from under him.

<doc id="174382" wikidata="Q1361402" url="?curid=174382" title="Pachyrhizus">
<text>Pachyrhizus is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It includes five or species of herbs and subshrubs native to the tropical and subtropical Americas, ranging from northern Mexico to northwestern Argentina. Typical habitat is seasonally-dry tropical forest and thicket, often at forest margins, in scrub vegetation, and in open grassy areas. Plants in the genus grow from large, often edible taproots.

== Jícama ==
The jícama or yam bean (&quot;P. erosus&quot;) is a vine widely grown for its large (10–15 cm diameter and up to 20 kg weight), spherical or elongated taproot. After removal of the thick, fibrous brown skin, the white flesh of the root can be eaten cooked or raw. Crisp, moist, and slightly sweet, the flesh draws comparison with that of the apple. The plant produces seeds that are comparable to lima beans, and that are sometimes eaten when young in places where the jicama is native. The mature seeds contain high levels of rotenone, a chemical used as an insecticide and pesticide. The remainder of the jícama plant is very poisonous.

Jícama comes from the New World; the name jícama is used in Central / South America. Today, pachyrhizus erosus is grown throughout Asia. In China, the root is known as cold potato; in Malaysia, sengkuang; in Indonesia, bengkoang; in the Philippines, singkamas; in Thailand, mankew. It is eaten raw and used in stir fried dishes.

== &quot;Pachyrhizus tuberosus&quot; ==

Goiteño, nupe, jacatupe or Amazonian yam bean (&quot;Pachyrhizus tuberosus&quot;) is an annual vine that is characterized by a wrapped and herbaceous stem and a ligneous base. It has white and lilac flowers, pods from 10 to 20 cm in length and beans with a high protein content (32%). Each plant has two or more tubercles from 15 to 25 cm in length that are succulent, sweet and rich in starch and protein (9%). They are consumed both raw and cooked. The leaves (20 to 24% protein) and pods are also edible. This plant prospers in acid soils in South America&#x27;s tropical rainforests. It is cultivated by the native peoples of the Amazon Rainforest.

== Ahipa ==

The ahipa, ajipa, or Andean yam bean (&quot;Pachyrhizus ahipa&quot;) is very similar to the jicama and goitenyo in characteristics and uses. Unlike the jícama, it is not a vine and it grows up 2000 m above sea level in the highest Bolivian mountains. The root is smaller and more elongated. It is little known outside of the Andes, where it is mostly grown for personal or local consumption. In the 19th century, British scientists introduced &quot;ahipa&quot; to the West Indies, where it is also enjoyed by the residents of those islands.

All three above &quot;Pachyrhizus&quot; species are popular cultivated varieties, mainly jicama or &quot;P. erosus&quot;, which is common in the US as imported jicama, while another species, &quot; P. palmatilobus&quot;, is less agreeable in taste.
