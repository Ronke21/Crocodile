<text>John Stewart Bell (28 July 1928 – 1 October 1990) was a physicist from Northern Ireland and the originator of Bell&#x27;s theorem, an important theorem in quantum physics regarding hidden-variable theories.

In 2022, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Alain Aspect, John Clauser, and Anton Zeilinger for work on Bell inequalities and the experimental validation of Bell&#x27;s theorem.

==Biography==

===Early life and work===
Bell was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland. When he was 11 years old, he decided to be a scientist, and at 16 graduated from Belfast Technical High School. Bell then attended the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast, where, in 1948, he obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in experimental physics and, a year later, a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematical physics. He went on to complete a PhD in physics at the University of Birmingham in 1956, specialising in nuclear physics and quantum field theory. In 1954, he married Mary Ross, also a physicist, whom he had met while working on accelerator physics at Malvern, UK. Bell became a vegetarian in his teen years. According to his wife, Bell was an atheist.

Bell&#x27;s career began with the UK Atomic Energy Research Establishment, near Harwell, Oxfordshire, known as AERE or Harwell Laboratory. In 1960, he moved to work for the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN, &quot;Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire&quot;), in Geneva, Switzerland. There he worked almost exclusively on theoretical particle physics and on accelerator design, but found time to pursue a major avocation, investigating the foundations of quantum theory. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1987. Also of significance during his career, Bell, together with John Bradbury Sykes, M. J. Kearsley, and W. H. Reid, translated several volumes of the ten-volume &quot;Course of Theoretical Physics&quot; of Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, making these works available to an English-speaking audience in translation, all of which remain in print.

Bell was a proponent of pilot wave theory. In 1987, inspired by Ghirardi–Rimini–Weber theory, he also advocated collapse theories. He said about the interpretation of quantum mechanics: &quot;Well, you see, I don&#x27;t really know. For me it&#x27;s not something where I have a solution to sell!&quot;
===Critique of von Neumann&#x27;s proof===
Bell was impressed that the formulation of David Bohm&#x27;s nonlocal hidden-variable theory did not require a &quot;movable boundary&quot; between the quantum system and the classical apparatus:

A possibility is that we find exactly where the boundary lies. More plausible to me is that we will find that there is no boundary. ... The wave functions would prove to be a provisional or incomplete description of the quantum-mechanical part, of which an objective account would become possible. It is this possibility, of a homogeneous account of the world, which is for me the chief motivation of the study of the so-called &quot;hidden variable&quot; possibility.

Bell also criticized the standard formalism of quantum mechanics on the grounds of lack of physical precision:

For the good books known to me are not much concerned with physical precision. This is clear already from their vocabulary. Here are some words which, however legitimate and necessary in application, have no place in a &quot;formulation&quot; with any pretension to physical precision: &quot;system&quot;, &quot;apparatus&quot;, &quot;environment&quot;, &quot;microscopic&quot;, &quot;macroscopic&quot;, &quot;reversible&quot;, &quot;irreversible&quot;, &quot;observable&quot;, &quot;information&quot;, &quot;measurement&quot;. ... On this list of bad words from good books, the worst of all is &quot;measurement&quot;.

To thoroughly explore the viability of Bohm&#x27;s theory, Bell needed to answer the challenge of the so-called impossibility proofs against hidden variables. Bell addressed these in a paper entitled &quot;On the Problem of Hidden Variables in Quantum Mechanics&quot;. (Due to publishing delays, this paper did not appear until 1966, two years after his more famous work on the EPR paradox .) He showed that John von Neumann&#x27;s no hidden variables proof does not prove the impossibility of hidden variables, as was widely claimed, due to its reliance on a physical assumption that is not valid for quantum mechanics—namely, that the probability-weighted average of the sum of observable quantities equals the sum of the average values of each of the separate observable quantities. This flaw in von Neumann&#x27;s proof had been previously discovered by Grete Hermann in 1935, but did not become common knowledge until after it was rediscovered by Bell. Bell reportedly said, &quot;The proof of von Neumann is not merely false but &quot;foolish&quot;!&quot; In this same work, Bell showed that a stronger effort at such a proof (based upon Gleason&#x27;s theorem) also fails to eliminate the hidden-variables program.

However, in 2010, Jeffrey Bub published an argument that Bell (and, implicitly, Hermann) had misconstrued von Neumann&#x27;s proof, saying that it does not attempt to prove the absolute impossibility of hidden variables, and is actually not flawed, after all. (Thus, it was the physics community as a whole that had misinterpreted von Neumann&#x27;s proof as applying universally.) Bub provides evidence that von Neumann understood the limits of his proof, but there is no record of von Neumann attempting to correct the near universal misinterpretation which lingered for over 30 years and exists to some extent to this day. Von Neumann&#x27;s proof does not in fact apply to contextual hidden variables, as in Bohm&#x27;s theory. Bub&#x27;s conclusion has, in turn, been questioned.

===Bell&#x27;s theorem===
In 1964, after a year&#x27;s leave from CERN that he spent at Stanford University, the University of Wisconsin–Madison and Brandeis University, Bell wrote a paper entitled &quot;On the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox&quot;. In this work, he showed that carrying forward EPR&#x27;s analysis permits one to derive the famous Bell&#x27;s theorem. The resultant inequality, derived from basic assumptions that apply to all classical situations, is violated by quantum theory.

There is some disagreement regarding what Bell&#x27;s inequality—in conjunction with the EPR analysis—can be said to imply. Bell held that not only local hidden variables, but any and all local theoretical explanations must conflict with the predictions of quantum theory: &quot;It is known that with Bohm&#x27;s example of EPR correlations, involving particles with spin, there is an irreducible nonlocality.&quot; According to an alternative interpretation, not all local theories in general, but only local hidden-variables theories (or &quot;local realist&quot; theories) have shown to be incompatible with the predictions of quantum theory.

===Conclusions from experimental tests===
In 1972 an experiment was conducted that, when extrapolated to ideal detector efficiencies, showed a violation of Bell&#x27;s inequality.It was the first of many such experiments. Bell himself concluded from these experiments that &quot;It now seems that the non-locality is deeply rooted in quantum mechanics itself and will persist in any completion.&quot; This, according to Bell, also implied that quantum theory is not locally causal and cannot be embedded into any locally causal theory. Bell regretted that results of the tests did not agree with the concept of local hidden variables:

For me, it is so reasonable to assume that the photons in those experiments carry with them programs, which have been correlated in advance, telling them how to behave. This is so rational that I think that when Einstein saw that, and the others refused to see it, &quot;he&quot; was the rational man. The other people, although history has justified them, were burying their heads in the sand. ... So for me, it is a pity that Einstein&#x27;s idea doesn&#x27;t work. The reasonable thing just doesn&#x27;t work.&quot;

Bell seemed to have become resigned to the notion that future experiments would continue to agree with quantum mechanics and violate his inequality. Referring to the Bell test experiments, he remarked:

It is difficult for me to believe that quantum mechanics, working very well for currently practical set-ups, will nevertheless fail badly with improvements in counter efficiency ...&quot;

Some people continue to believe that agreement with Bell&#x27;s inequalities might yet be saved. They argue that in the future much more precise experiments could reveal that one of the known loopholes, for example the so-called &quot;fair sampling loophole&quot;, had been biasing the interpretations. Most mainstream physicists are highly skeptical about all these &quot;loopholes&quot;, admitting their existence but continuing to believe that Bell&#x27;s inequalities must fail.

Bell remained interested in objective &#x27;observer-free&#x27; quantum mechanics. He felt that at the most fundamental level, physical theories ought not to be concerned with observables, but with &#x27;be-ables&#x27;: &quot;The of the theory are those elements which might correspond to elements of reality, to things which exist. Their existence does not depend on &#x27;observation&#x27;.&quot; He remained impressed with Bohm&#x27;s hidden variables as an example of such a scheme and he attacked the more subjective alternatives such as the Copenhagen interpretation.

===Teaching special theory of relativity===
Bell and his wife, Mary Ross Bell, also a physicist, contributed substantially to the physics of particle accelerators, and with numerous young theorists at CERN, Bell developed particle physics itself. An overview of this work is available in the volume of collected works edited by Mary Bell, Kurt Gottfried, and Martinus Veltman.
Apart from his particle physics research, Bell often raised an issue of special relativity comprehension, and although there is only one written report on this topic available (&quot;How to teach special relativity&quot;), this was a critical subject to him. Bell admired Einstein&#x27;s contribution to special relativity, but warned in 1985 &quot;Einstein&#x27;s approach is ... pedagogically dangerous, in my opinion&quot;. In 1989 on the occasion of the centenary of the Lorentz-FitzGerald body contraction Bell writes &quot;A great deal of nonsense has been written about the FitzGerald contraction&quot;. Bell preferred to think of Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction as a phenomenon that is real and observable as a property of a material body, which was also Einstein&#x27;s opinion, but in Bell&#x27;s view Einstein&#x27;s approach leaves a lot of room for misinterpretation. This situation and the background of Bell&#x27;s position is described in detail by his collaborator Johann Rafelski in the textbook &quot;Relativity Matters&quot; (2017). In order to combat misconceptions surrounding Lorentz-FitzGerald body contraction Bell adapted and promoted a relativistic thought experiment which became widely known as Bell&#x27;s spaceship paradox.

===Death===

Bell died unexpectedly of a cerebral hemorrhage in Geneva in 1990. Unknown to Bell, he had reportedly been nominated for a Nobel Prize that year. His contribution to the issues raised by EPR was significant. Some regard him as having demonstrated the failure of local realism (local hidden variables). Bell&#x27;s own interpretation is that locality itself had met its demise.

==Legacy==
*In 2008, the John Stewart Bell Prize was created by the Centre for Quantum Information and Quantum Control at the University of Toronto. The prize is awarded every other year for significant contributions first published during the six preceding years. The award recognizes major advances relating to the foundations of quantum mechanics and to the applications of these principles. In 2009, the first award was presented by Alain Aspect to Nicolas Gisin for his theoretical and experimental work on foundations and applications of quantum physics — notably quantum nonlocality, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation.

*At the CERN site in Meyrin, close to Geneva, there is a street called Route Bell in honour of John Stewart Bell.
*In 2016, his colleague from CERN, Reinhold Bertlmann, wrote a lengthy piece, &quot;Bell&#x27;s Universe: A Personal Recollection&quot;, explaining in some detail his amazement at finding out about Bell&#x27;s paper on Bertlmann&#x27;s socks, in which Bell compared the EPR paradox with socks.
*A day was named after him, referring to the date he released Bell&#x27;s Theorem, 4 November.

===Northern Ireland===

*Since 2015, a street has been named Bell&#x27;s Theorem Crescent in his city of birth, Belfast.
*The John Bell House, named in his honour, finished construction in 2016 and houses over 400 students in Belfast city centre.
*The pedestrian entrance to the Olympia leisure centre in Belfast located 200 meters from Bell&#x27;s childhood home is named the &quot;John Stewart Bell Entrance&quot; in honour of the local man.
*In the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast one of the Physics lecture theatres is named in honour of John Stewart Bell.
* There is a blue plaque commemorating John Stewart Bell in Queen&#x27;s university main campus
* There is a blue plaque commemorating John Stewart Bell at his childhood home in Tates Avenue in Belfast
*In 2017 the Institute of Physics commissioned classical composer Matthew Whiteside&#x27;s Quartet No 4 (Entangled) to be performed at the 2018 NI Science Festival inspired by Bell&#x27;s work; the piece went on to become the title track on Whiteside&#x27;s second album and was the inspiration for a short film by Marisa Zanotti.

<text>Slow Motion Daydream is the sixth studio album by Everclear. It was released in the U.S. in 2003 on Capitol Records and recorded in 2002.

==Production==
The first single released to radio from &quot;Slow Motion Daydream&quot; was &quot;Volvo Driving Soccer Mom&quot;, followed by second single &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Though the album debuted at number 33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, higher than the band&#x27;s last, it quickly fell off the charts. By July 2004, the album had sold 106,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen Soundscan. &quot;Spin&quot; listed the album as one of 2003&#x27;s biggest commercial flops.

This was the last album of new material to feature longtime members Craig Montoya and Greg Eklund who left the band later in August of that year.

==Track listing==
==Personnel==
*Art Alexakis – guitar, vocals
*Craig Montoya – bass

<doc id="169923" wikidata="Q752553" url="?curid=169923" title="Tarpeian Rock">
<text>The Rock of Tarpeia (; Latin: &#x27; or&#x27;; ) is a steep cliff on the south side of the Capitoline Hill that was used in Ancient Rome as a site of execution. 

Adjudicated murderers, traitors, perjurors, and larcenous slaves, if convicted by the &quot;quaestores parricidii&quot;, were flung from the cliff to their deaths. The cliff was about 25 meters high.

==Roman legend==
According to early Roman histories, when the Sabine ruler Titus Tatius attacked Rome after the Rape of the Sabines (8th century BC), the Vestal Virgin Tarpeia, daughter of Spurius Tarpeius, governor of the citadel on the Capitoline Hill, betrayed the Romans by opening the Porta Pandana gate for Titus Tatius in return for &quot;what the Sabines bore on their arms&quot; (golden bracelets and bejeweled rings). In Book 1 of Livy&#x27;s &quot;Ab Urbe Condita&quot;, the Sabines &quot;having been accepted into the citadel, [the Sabines] killed her, having been overwhelmed by weapons, and &quot;&quot;, meaning, &quot;[they] heaped up shields [on her]&quot;. The invaders crushed her to death with their shields (&quot;what the Sabines bore on their arms&quot;), and her body was buried in the rock that now bears her name. Regardless of whether or not Tarpeia was buried in the rock itself, it is significant that the rock bore the name of the traitress.

About 500 BC, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh legendary king of Rome, levelled the top of the rock, removing the shrines built by the Sabines, and built the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus on the &quot;, the area between the two summits of the hill. The rock itself survived the remodelling and was used for executions well into Sulla&#x27;s time (early 1st century BC). However the execution of Simon bar Giora in 71 AD was as late as the time of Vespasian.

There is a Latin phrase, &quot; (&#x27;the Tarpeian Rock is close to the Capitol&#x27;), a warning that one&#x27;s fall from grace can come swiftly.

Early Romans allegedly disposed of handicapped children at the Tarpeian Rock.

To be hurled off the Tarpeian Rock was, from a certain perspective, a fate worse than mere death because it carried with it the stigma of shame. The standard method of execution in ancient Rome was by strangulation in the Tullianum. The rock was reserved for the most notorious traitors and as a place of unofficial, extra-legal executions such as the near-execution in 491 BC of legendary then-Senator Gaius Marcius Coriolanus by a mob whipped into frenzy by a tribune of the plebs.

==Notable victims==
Victims of this punishment included:
* Spurius Cassius Vecellinus, 485 BC, for perduellio (i.e. high treason)
* Marcus Manlius Capitolinus, 384 BC, for sedition
* Rebels from Tarentum, 212 BC
* Lucius Cornelius Chrysogonus, 80 BC
* Syllaeus or Syllaios, 6 BC
* Aelius Saturninus, 23 AD
* Sextus Marius, a rich man from Spain with copper and gold mines confiscated by Tiberius and executed in 33 AD after being accused of incest. 
* Barbatius Philippus
* Simon bar Giora, 71 AD

==In fiction==
* The Tarpeian Rock is briefly mentioned in Act Three, Scene Three of the Shakespeare tragedy &quot;Coriolanus&quot;. In lines 87–90, Coriolanus warns: 
&quot;Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,/
Vagabond exile, flaying, pent to linger/
But with a grain a day; I would not buy/
Their mercy at the price of one fair word.&quot;
In lines 99–104, Sicinius Velutus gives judgment:
&quot;we/ Even from this instant, banish him our city,/
In peril of precipitation/
From off the rock Tarpeian, never more/
To enter our Rome gates.&quot;
* In Miguel de Cervantes&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot; The image of Nero watching the burning of Rome is related to the fires of passion. In Part 1, Chapter 14 Ambrosio accuses Marcela of being a cruel Nero. In Part 2, Chapter 44, Altisidora accuses Don Quixote of being a new Nero who watches her burn with love from the Tarpeian Rock: &quot;No mires de tu Tarpeya / este incendio que me abrasa / Neron manchego del mundo.&quot;
* In &quot;Asterix and the Laurel Wreath&quot;, the jailer at the Circus Maximus remarks to Asterix and Obelix that, while they are getting a gourmet feast leading up to the day they are thrown to the lions: &quot;Those who are thrown from the Tarpeian Rock are given solid, heavy food.&quot;
* In Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;The Marble Faun&quot;, a character is murdered by another character by being thrown from the Tarpeian Rock.
* Canto IX of Purgatory of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; by Dante Alighieri has a reference to the Tarpeian Rock. When Metellusus yielded to Julius Caesar, the rock, close by, was said to creak when the door to the treasury was opened. The symbolic meaning is obvious as Caesar was criticized for robbing the public treasury of Roman Republic.
* In the HBO TV series &quot;Rome&quot;, Julius Caesar refers to the site while trying to motivate his soldiers to march to Rome in opposition to the Senate.
* In &quot;A Capitol Death&quot; by Lindsey Davis, three deaths involve falls from the Tarpeian Rock.
* The Tarpeian Cliff is mentioned multiple times in &quot;I, Claudius&quot; by Robert Graves, as a place of execution by hurling over the edge.
* In The Cantos, Ezra Pound includes reference to the &#x27;Rupe Tarpeia&#x27; in &quot;Notes for CXVII etc seq.&quot;: &quot;Under the Rupe Tarpeia/ weep out your jealousies--/ To make a church/ or an altar to Zagreus/ Son of Semele/ Without jealousy/ like the double arch of a window/ Or some great colonnade.&quot;

<doc id="169925" wikidata="Q7941302" url="?curid=169925" title="Volvo Driving Soccer Mom">
<text>&quot;Volvo-Driving Soccer Mom&quot; is a song by the alternative rock band Everclear, from their album &quot;Slow Motion Daydream&quot; (2003). The song was performed by Everclear lead singer Art Alexakis during his solo tour and was made the first single off &quot;Slow Motion Daydream&quot;.

==Content==
The song is about girls who use drugs and are sexually promiscuous in high school and college, but later grow up to be more conservative, suburban housewives when they decide it will be to their advantage. The lyrics allude to having a threesome and being busted for possession in the earlier part of the song, and describes the subjects&#x27; lives later on as &quot;blonde, bland, middle-class Republican lives&quot;.

In an October 2003 interview with &quot;Songfacts&quot;, Alexakis explained the inspiration for &quot;Volvo Driving Soccer Mom&quot;:

==Music video==
The video for the song features the story of a blonde wild child and former stripper who grows up to become a Volvo-driving soccer mom just like the song describes. In the video, scenes from her &quot;checkered&quot; past are intercut with scenes from her present life as a housewife to highlight the differences between the two. Some of the final scenes subvert the implied message of the song, portraying the present day housewife engaged in sex while her past stripper self falls asleep alone watching financial reports. The video also features scenes of Everclear performing the song at a house party.

<doc id="169934" wikidata="Q361669" url="?curid=169934" title="Modal particle">
<text>In linguistics, modal particles are a type of grammatical particle used in a sentence to add extra meaning, particularly in spoken language. Modal particles have various functions, including adding emotion or emphasis, or to express how sentence content is grounded in common knowledge between the speaker and participants. 

Languages that use many modal particles in their spoken form include Dutch, Danish, German, Hungarian, Russian, Telugu, Nepali, Norwegian, Indonesian, Sinitic languages, and Japanese. Modal particles are often context-dependent and difficult to translate.

==Examples==
===German===

The German particle &quot;ja&quot; is used to indicate that a sentence contains information that is obvious or already known to both the speaker and the hearer. The sentence &quot;Der neue Teppich ist rot&quot; means &quot;The new carpet is red&quot;. &quot;Der neue Teppich ist ja rot&quot; may thus mean &quot;As we are both aware, the new carpet is red&quot;, which would typically be followed by some conclusion from this fact. However, if the speaker says the same thing upon first seeing the new carpet, the meaning is &quot;I&#x27;m seeing that the carpet is obviously red&quot;, which would typically express surprise. In speech the latter meaning can be inferred from a strong emphasis on &quot;rot&quot; and higher-pitched voice.

===Dutch===
In Dutch, modal particles are frequently used to add mood to a sentence, especially in spoken language. For instance:

* Politeness
**&quot;Kan je even het licht aandoen?&quot; (literally: &quot;Can you briefly turn on the light?&quot; with the added &quot;even&quot; indicating that it will not take you long to do so.) 
** &quot;Weet u misschien waar het station is?&quot; (&quot;Do you perhaps know where the train station is?&quot;)&lt;br&gt; &quot;Misschien&quot; here denotes a very polite and friendly request: &quot;Could you tell me the way to the train station, please?&quot;
** &quot;Wil je soms wat drinken?&quot; (&quot;Do you occasionally want a drink?&quot;)&lt;br&gt;&quot;Soms&quot; here conveys a sincere interest in the answer to a question: &quot;I&#x27;m curious if you would like to drink something?&quot;
* Frustration
** &quot;Doe het toch maar.&quot; (&quot;Do it nevertheless, however.&quot;)&lt;br&gt;&quot;Toch&quot; here indicates anger and &quot;maar&quot; lack of consideration: &quot;I don&#x27;t really care what you think, just do it!&quot;
** &quot;Ben je nou nog niet klaar?&quot; (&quot;Are you still not ready yet?&quot;)&lt;br&gt;&quot;Nou&quot; here denotes loss of patience: &quot;Don&#x27;t tell me you still haven&#x27;t finished!&quot;

Modal particles may be combined to indicate mood in a very precise way. In this combination of six modal particles the first two emphasise the command, the second two are toning down the command, and the final two transform the command into a request:

* &quot;Luister dan nu toch maar eens even&quot;. (&quot;Listen + at this moment + now + just + &quot;will you?&quot; + only once + only for a while&quot;, meaning: &quot;Just listen, will you?&quot;)

Because of this progressive alteration these modal particles cannot move around freely when stacked in this kind of combination. However, some other modal particles can be added to the equation on any given place, such as gewoon, juist, trouwens. Also, replacing the &quot;imperative weakener&quot; maar by gewoon (indicating normalcy or acceptable behavior), changes the mood of the sentence completely, now indicating utter frustration with someone who is failing to do something very simple:

*&quot;Luister dan nou toch gewoon eens even!&quot; (&quot;For once, can you just simply listen for a minute?&quot;)

<text>Kalakshetra Foundation, formerly simply Kalakshetra, is an arts and cultural academy dedicated to the preservation of traditional values in Indian art and crafts, especially in the field of Bharatanatyam dance and Gandharvaveda music. Based in Chennai, India, the academy was founded in January 1936 by Rukmini Devi Arundale and her husband George Arundale. Under Arundale&#x27;s guidance, the institution achieved national and international recognition for its unique style and perfectionism. In 1962, Kalakshetra moved to a new 40-hectre campus in Besant Nagar, Chennai.

In January 1994, an Act of the Parliament of India recognised the Kalakshetra Foundation as an &quot;Institute of National Importance.&quot; The current Chairman of Kalakshetra is S. Ramadorai and the current director is Revathi Ramachandran.

== History==


Kalakshetra, later known as the Kalakshetra Foundation, was established by Rukmini Devi Arundale, along with her husband, George Arundale, a well-known theosophist, in Adyar, Chennai, in 1936. She invited not only the best students but also noted teachers, musicians and artists to be a part of this institution. In 1944, the University of Madras granted its affiliation for conducting diploma courses in Music, Dance and Painting &amp; Crafts.

Year-long celebrations, including lectures, seminars and festivals marked her 100th birth anniversary, on 29 February 2004, at Kalakshetra and elsewhere in many parts of the world. Also on 29 February, a photo exhibition on her life opened at the Lalit Kala Gallery in New Delhi, and President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam released a photo-biography, written and compiled by Sunil Kothari, with a foreword by former president Ramaswamy Venkataraman. In 2016, marking its 80th year, the Kalakshetra Foundation held a &#x27;Remembering Rukmini Devi&#x27; festival of music and dance.

==Kalakshetra style==
Having studied the Pandanallur style for three years, in 1936 Rukmini Devi Arundale started working on developing her own, Kalakshetra, style of Bharatanatyam. She introduced group performances and staged various Bharatanatyam-based ballets.

The Kalakshetra style is noted for its angular, straight, ballet-like kinesthetics, and its avoidance of Recakas and of the uninhibited throw (Ksepa) of the limbs.

According to Sankara Menon (1907–2007), who was her associate from Kalakshetra&#x27;s beginnings, Rukmini Devi raised Bharatanatyam to a puritan art form, divorced from its recently controversial past by &quot;removing objectionable elements&quot; (mostly, the &quot;Sringara&quot;, certain emotional elements evocative of the erotic, such as hip, neck, lip and chest movements) from the Pandanallur style, which was publicly criticized by Indian dancer Tanjore Balasaraswati (1918–1984) and other representatives of Tamil Nadu&#x27;s traditional Isai Velalar culture. Love outside parameters considered &quot;chaste&quot; was not to be portrayed. Balasaraswati said that &quot;the effort to purify Bharatanatyam through the introduction of novel ideas is like putting a gloss on burnished gold or painting the lotus&quot;. Lawyer and classical artist E. Krishna Iyer (1897–1968) said about Rukmini Devi, &quot;There is no need to say that before she entered the field, the art was dead and gone or that it saw a renaissance only when she started to dance or that she created anything new that was not there before&quot;.

==Controversy==
In December 2022, allegations of sexual abuse in the campus began to surface after former director Leela Samson wrote a social media post accusing a teacher of harassing and molesting students, but hadn&#x27;t specified the name of the teacher. In the following months, over a hundred students of Kalakshetra Foundation&#x27;s Rukmini Devi College of Fine Arts accused senior faculty member, Hari Padman, of sexual harassment. The accusations spanned a number of years. Padman was exonerated following an internal investigation, and Kalakshetra Foundation issued a gag order preventing students and staff from discussing the allegations. On 21 March 2023, the National Commission for Women began investigating the allegations, but closed the investigation shortly, after a victim denied any sexual harassment during an enquiry. On 30 March, the students began protests against the inaction of the Kalakshetra authorities, by walking out of a routine morning prayer when Padman walked in. The protests prompted a response from the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. K. Stalin, after which an FIR was registered against Padman by the Tamil Nadu police. The Tamil Nadu State Commission for Women also launched an investigation and received over 90 written complaints regarding various issues faced by the students of the foundation. Padman was arrested by the Tamil Nadu police on 3 April 2023. In response, Padman&#x27;s wife Divya Hari Padman filed a counter complaint against the victim and two teachers working in the institute. Amidst the sexual harassment allegations, students also raised complaints about mismanagement by the foundation director Revathi Ramachandran, referring to the coverup of a food poisoning outbreak in November 2021.

<text>The Liberia Drug Enforcement Agency (LDEA) is an agency established within the Liberian government on December 23, 1998, charged with fighting drug-related crimes. The LDEA is supervised by the Ministry of Justice and is charged with fighting drug trafficking at the country&#x27;s borders, arresting traffickers and dealers, and destroying illegal drugs. The LDEA is not responsible for overseeing commerce in legal drugs and other pharmaceuticals; such substances are within the purview of the Pharmaceutical Board of Liberia.

== History ==
Before its creation, fighting drug crimes was a responsibility of the Ministry of Defense. The agency began as the National Drug Committee of the Interim Government of National Unity; it was created in 1993 during the presidency of Amos Sawyer. Five years later, the committee was converted into its present form: President Charles Taylor signed a bill passed by the National Legislature that created the LDEA and patterned it after the Drug Enforcement Administration in the United States. 

In 2011, the LDEA boss was Director Henry Shaw, but by 2012 he had been replaced by Anthony Souh. According to LDEA boss Anthony Souh, the agency suffers from substantial internal corruption. Directors are appointed by the President subject to confirmation by the Senate of Liberia.

<text>Merle Ronald Haggard (April 6, 1937 – April 6, 2016) was an American country music singer, songwriter, guitarist, and fiddler.

Haggard was born in Oildale, California, toward the end of the Great Depression. His childhood was troubled after the death of his father, and he was incarcerated several times in his youth. After being released from San Quentin State Prison in 1960, he managed to turn his life around and launched a successful country music career. He gained popularity with his songs about the working class; these occasionally contained themes contrary to the anti–Vietnam War sentiment of some popular music of the time. Between the 1960s and the 1980s he had 38 number-one hits on the US country charts, several of which also made the &quot;Billboard&quot; all-genre singles chart. Haggard continued to release successful albums into the 2000s.

He received many honors and awards for his music, including a Kennedy Center Honor (2010); a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award (2006); a BMI Icon Award (2006); and induction into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame (1977); Country Music Hall of Fame (1994) and Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame (1997). He died on April 6, 2016—his 79th birthday—at his ranch in Shasta County, California, having recently suffered from double pneumonia.

==Early life==
Haggard&#x27;s parents were Flossie Mae (née Harp; 1902–1984) and James Francis Haggard (1899–1946). The family moved to California from their home in Checotah, Oklahoma, during the Great Depression, after their barn burned in 1934.

They settled with their two elder children, James &#x27;Lowell&#x27; (1922–1996) and Lillian, in an apartment in Bakersfield, while James started working for the Santa Fe Railroad. A woman who owned a boxcar placed in Oildale, a nearby town, asked Haggard&#x27;s father about the possibility of converting it into a house. He remodeled the boxcar, and soon after moved in, also purchasing the lot, where Merle Ronald Haggard was born on April 6, 1937. The property was eventually expanded by building a bathroom, a second bedroom, a kitchen, and a breakfast nook in the adjacent lot.

In 1946 Haggard&#x27;s father died of a brain hemorrhage. Nine-year-old Haggard was deeply affected by the loss, and it remained a pivotal event to him for the rest of his life. To support the family, Haggard&#x27;s mother took a job as a bookkeeper. Older brother Lowell gave his guitar to Merle when Merle was 12. Haggard learned to play it on his own, with the records he had at home, influenced by Bob Wills, Lefty Frizzell, and Hank Williams. While his mother was out working during the day Haggard started getting into trouble. She sent him to a juvenile detention center for a weekend to try to correct him, but his behavior did not improve. If anything, he became worse.

By the age of 13, Haggard was stealing and writing bad checks. In 1950 he was caught shoplifting and sent to a juvenile detention center. The following year he ran away to Texas with his friend Bob Teague. The two rode freight trains and hitchhiked throughout the state. When they returned later that year the two boys were accused of robbery and sent to jail. This time, they had not actually committed the crime, and were released when the real robbers were found. The experience did not change Haggard much. He was again sent to a juvenile detention center later that year, from which he and his friend escaped and headed to Modesto, California. There he worked a series of laborer jobs, including potato truck driver, short order cook, hay pitcher and oil well shooter. His debut performance was with Teague in a Modesto bar named &quot;Fun Center&quot;, for which he was paid US$5 and given free beer.

In 1951 he returned to Bakersfield, where he was again arrested for truancy and petty larceny and sent to a juvenile detention center. After another escape, he was sent to the Preston School of Industry, a high-security installation. He was released 15 months later but was sent back after beating a local boy during a burglary attempt. After Haggard&#x27;s release, he and Teague saw Lefty Frizzell in concert. The two sat backstage, where Haggard began to sing along. Hearing the young man from the stage, Frizzell refused to go on unless Haggard was allowed to sing first. Haggard did, and was well received by the audience. After this experience Haggard decided to pursue a career in music. At night he would sing and play in local bars, while working as a farmhand or in the oil fields during the day.

Married and plagued by financial issues, in 1957 he tried to rob a Bakersfield roadhouse, was caught and arrested. Convicted, he was sent to the Bakersfield Jail. After an escape attempt he was transferred to San Quentin Prison on February 21, 1958. There he was prisoner number A45200. While in prison, Haggard learned that his wife was expecting another man&#x27;s child, which stressed him psychologically. He was fired from a series of prison jobs, and planned to escape along with another inmate nicknamed &quot;Rabbit&quot; (James Kendrick) but was dissuaded by fellow inmates.

While at San Quentin, Haggard started a gambling and brewing racket with his cellmate. After he was caught drunk, he was sent for a week to solitary confinement where he encountered Caryl Chessman, an author and death-row inmate. Meanwhile, &quot;Rabbit&quot; had successfully escaped, only to shoot a police officer and be returned to San Quentin for execution. Chessman&#x27;s predicament, along with the execution of &quot;Rabbit&quot;, inspired Haggard to change his life. He soon earned a high school equivalency diploma and kept a steady job in the prison&#x27;s textile plant. He also played for the prison&#x27;s country music band. He also attended a Johnny Cash concert at the prison in 1958. Cash sang his song &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; (1956) and &quot;had a profound influence on the young inmate, who upon release set out on forging a career as a singer-songwriter&quot;. Haggard was released from San Quentin on parole in 1960.

In 1972, after Haggard had become an established country music star, then-California governor Ronald Reagan granted Haggard a full and unconditional pardon for his past crimes.

==Career==
===Early career===

Upon his release from San Quentin in 1960, Haggard started digging ditches for his brother&#x27;s electrical contracting company. Soon, he was performing again and later began recording with Tally Records. The Bakersfield sound was developing in the area as a reaction against the overproduced Nashville sound. Haggard&#x27;s first record for Tally was &quot;Singing My Heart Out&quot; backed by &quot;Skid Row&quot;; it was not a success, and only 200 copies were pressed. In 1962, Haggard wound up performing at a Wynn Stewart show in Las Vegas and heard Wynn&#x27;s &quot;Sing a Sad Song&quot;. He asked for permission to record it, and the resulting single was a national hit in 1964. The following year, he had his first national top-10 record with &quot;(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers&quot;, written by Liz Anderson, mother of country singer Lynn Anderson, and his career was off and running. Haggard recalls having been talked into visiting Anderson—a woman he did not know—at her house to hear her sing some songs she had written. &quot;If there was anything I didn&#x27;t wanna do, it was sit around some danged woman&#x27;s house and listen to her cute little songs. But I went anyway. She was a pleasant enough lady, pretty, with a nice smile, but I was all set to be bored to death, even more so when she got out a whole bunch of songs and went over to an old pump organ... There they were. My God, one hit right after another. There must have been four or five number one songs there...&quot;

In 1967, Haggard recorded &quot;I&#x27;m a Lonesome Fugitive&quot; with the Strangers, also written by Liz Anderson, with her husband Casey Anderson, which became his first number-one single. When the Andersons presented the song to Haggard, they were unaware of his prison stretch. Bonnie Owens, Haggard&#x27;s backup singer and then-wife, is quoted by music journalist Daniel Cooper in the liner notes to the 1994 retrospective &quot;Down Every Road&quot;: &quot;I guess I didn&#x27;t realize how much the experience at San Quentin did to him, &#x27;cause he never talked about it all that much ... I could tell he was in a dark mood ... and I said, &#x27;Is everything okay?&#x27; And he said, &#x27;I&#x27;m really scared.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Why?&#x27; And he said, &#x27;Cause I&#x27;m afraid someday I&#x27;m gonna be out there ... and there&#x27;s gonna be ... some prisoner ... in there the same time I was in, stand up—and they&#x27;re gonna be about the third row down—and say, &#x27;What do you think you&#x27;re doing, 45200?&#x27;&quot; Cooper notes that the news had little effect on Haggard&#x27;s career: &quot;It&#x27;s unclear when or where Merle first acknowledged to the public that his prison songs were rooted in personal history, for to his credit, he doesn&#x27;t seem to have made some big splash announcement. In a May 1967 profile in &quot;Music City News&quot;, his prison record is never mentioned, but in July 1968, in the very same publication, it&#x27;s spoken of as if it were common knowledge.&quot;

The 1967 album &quot;Branded Man&quot; with the Strangers kicked off an artistically and commercially successful run for Haggard. In 2013, Haggard biographer David Cantwell stated, &quot;The immediate successors to &quot;I&#x27;m a Lonesome Fugitive&quot;—&quot;Branded Man&quot; in 1967 and, in &#x27;68, &quot;Sing Me Back Home&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde&quot;—were among the finest albums of their respective years.&quot; Haggard&#x27;s new recordings showcased his band the Strangers, specifically Roy Nichols&#x27;s Telecaster, Ralph Mooney&#x27;s steel guitar, and the harmony vocals provided by Bonnie Owens.

At the time of Haggard&#x27;s first top-10 hit &quot;(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers&quot; in 1965, Owens, who had been married to Buck Owens, was known as a solo performer, a fixture on the Bakersfield club scene and someone who had appeared on television. She won the new Academy of Country Music&#x27;s first ever award for Female Vocalist after her 1965 debut album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Take Advantage of Me&quot;, hit the top five on the country albums chart. However, Bonnie Owens had no further hit singles, and although she recorded six solo albums on Capitol between 1965 and 1970, she became mainly known for her background harmonies on Haggard hits such as &quot;Sing Me Back Home&quot; and &quot;Branded Man&quot;.

Producer Ken Nelson took a hands-off approach to produce Haggard. In the episode of &quot;American Masters&quot; dedicated to him, Haggard remembers: &quot;The producer I had at that time, Ken Nelson, was an exception to the rule. He called me &#x27;Mr. Haggard&#x27; and I was a little twenty-four, twenty-five-year-old punk from Oildale... He gave me complete responsibility. I think if he&#x27;d jumped in and said, &#x27;Oh, you can&#x27;t do that&#x27;, it would&#x27;ve destroyed me.&quot; In the documentary series &quot;Lost Highway&quot;, Nelson recalls, &quot;When I first started recording Merle, I became so enamored with his singing that I would forget what else was going on, and I suddenly realized, &#x27;Wait a minute, there&#x27;s musicians here you&#x27;ve got to worry about!&#x27; But his songs—he was a great writer.&quot;

Towards the end of the decade, Haggard composed several number-one hits, including &quot;Mama Tried&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, &quot;Hungry Eyes&quot;, and &quot;Sing Me Back Home&quot;. Daniel Cooper calls &quot;Sing Me Back Home&quot; &quot;a ballad that works on so many different levels of the soul it defies one&#x27;s every attempt to analyze it&quot;. In a 1977 interview in &quot;Billboard&quot; with Bob Eubanks, Haggard reflected, &quot;Even though the crime was brutal and the guy was an incorrigible criminal, it&#x27;s a feeling you never forget when you see someone you know make that last walk. They bring him through the yard, and there&#x27;s a guard in front and a guard behind—that&#x27;s how you know a death prisoner. They brought Rabbit out ... taking him to see the Father, ... prior to his execution. That was a strong picture that was left in my mind.&quot; In 1969, Haggard&#x27;s first tribute LP &quot;Same Train, Different Time: A Tribute to Jimmie Rodgers&quot;, was also released to acclaim.

In the 1969 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review for Haggard and the Strangers 1968 album &quot;Mama Tried&quot;, Andy Wickham wrote, &quot;His songs romanticize the hardships and tragedies of America&#x27;s transient proletarian and his success is resultant of his inherent ability to relate to his audience a commonplace experience with precisely the right emotional pitch... Merle Haggard looks the part and sounds the part because he is the part. He&#x27;s great.&quot;

===&quot;Okie from Muskogee&quot; and &quot;The Fightin&#x27; Side of Me&quot;===
In 1969, Haggard and the Strangers released &quot;Okie From Muskogee&quot;, with lyrics ostensibly reflecting the singer&#x27;s pride in being from Middle America, where people are conventionally patriotic and traditionally conservative. American president Richard Nixon wrote an appreciative letter to Haggard upon his hearing of the song, and would go on to invite Haggard to perform at the White House several times.

In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values. In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a &quot;documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time&quot;. However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the &quot;Bob Edwards Show&quot;, he said, &quot;I wrote it when I recently got out of the joint. I knew what it was like to lose my freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters. They didn&#x27;t know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. I thought how my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt.&quot; In the country music documentary series &quot;Lost Highway&quot;, he elaborated: &quot;My dad passed away when I was nine, and I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve ever thought about somebody you&#x27;ve lost and you say, &#x27;I wonder what so-and-so would think about this?&#x27; I was drivin&#x27; on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said &#x27;19 Miles to Muskogee&#x27;, while at the same time listening to radio shows of &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; hosted by Garner Ted Armstrong. Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as &#x27;back home.&#x27; So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought, &#x27;I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins... I understood &#x27;em, I got along with it, but what if he was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin&#x27; in the center of the country sayin&#x27;, &#x27;What is goin&#x27; on on these campuses?&#x27;&quot;, as it was the subject of this Garner Ted Armstrong radio program. &quot;And a week or so later, I was listening to Garner Ted Armstrong, and Armstrong was saying how the smaller colleges in smaller towns don&#x27;t seem to have any problems. And I wondered if Muskogee had a college, and it did, and they hadn&#x27;t had any trouble - no racial problems and no dope problems. The whole thing hit me in two minutes, and I did one line after another and got the whole thing done in 20 minutes.&quot; In the &quot;American Masters&quot; documentary about him, he said, &quot;That&#x27;s how I got into it with the hippies... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin&#x27; down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, &#x27;You sons of bitches, you&#x27;ve never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin&#x27; about things, protesting about a war that they didn&#x27;t know any more about than I did. They weren&#x27;t over there fightin&#x27; that war any more than I was.&quot;

Haggard began performing the song in concert in 1969 and was astounded at the reaction it received:

The studio version, which was mellower than the usually raucous live-concert versions, topped the country charts in 1969 and remained there for a month. It also hit number 41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; all-genre singles chart, becoming Haggard&#x27;s biggest hit up to that time, surpassed only by his 1973 crossover Christmas hit, &quot;If We Make It Through December&quot;, which peaked at number 28. &quot;Okie from Muskogee&quot; is also generally described as Haggard&#x27;s signature song.

On his next single, &quot;The Fightin&#x27; Side of Me&quot;, released by his record company in 1970 over Haggard&#x27;s objections, Haggard&#x27;s lyrics stated that he did not mind the counterculture &quot;switchin&#x27; sides and standin&#x27; up for what they believe in&quot;, but resolutely declared, &quot;If you don&#x27;t love it, leave it!&quot; In May 1970, Haggard explained to John Grissom of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;I don&#x27;t like their views on life, their filth, their visible self-disrespect, y&#x27;know. They don&#x27;t give a shit what they look like or what they smell like... What do they have to offer humanity?&quot; In a 2003 interview with &quot;No Depression&quot; magazine, Haggard said, &quot;I had different views in the &#x27;70s. As a human being, I&#x27;ve learned [more]. I have more culture now. I was dumb as a rock when I wrote &#x27;Okie From Muskogee&#x27;. That&#x27;s being honest with you at the moment, and a lot of things that I said [then] I sing with a different intention now. My views on marijuana have totally changed. I think we were brainwashed and I think anybody that doesn&#x27;t know that needs to get up and read and look around, get their own information. It&#x27;s a cooperative government project to make us think marijuana should be outlawed.&quot;

Haggard had wanted to follow &quot;Okie from Muskogee&quot; with &quot;Irma Jackson&quot;, a song that dealt with an interracial romance between a white man and an African American woman. His producer, Ken Nelson, discouraged him from releasing it as a single. Jonathan Bernstein recounts, &quot;Hoping to distance himself from the harshly right-wing image he had accrued in the wake of the hippie-bashing &quot;Muskogee&quot;, Haggard wanted to take a different direction and release &quot;Irma Jackson&quot; as his next single... When the Bakersfield, California, native brought the song to his record label, executives were reportedly appalled. In the wake of &quot;Okie&quot;, Capitol Records was not interested in complicating Haggard&#x27;s conservative, blue-collar image.&quot;

After &quot;The Fightin&#x27; Side of Me&quot; was released instead, Haggard later commented to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;People are narrow-minded. Down South they might have called me a nigger lover.&quot; In a 2001 interview, Haggard stated that Nelson, who was also head of the country division at Capitol at the time, never interfered with his music, but &quot;this one time he came out and said, &#x27;Merle, I don&#x27;t believe the world is ready for this yet.&#x27; ... And he might have been right. I might&#x27;ve canceled out where I was headed in my career.&quot;

&quot;Okie From Muskogee&quot;, &quot;The Fightin&#x27; Side of Me&quot;, and &quot;I Wonder If They Think of Me&quot; (Haggard&#x27;s 1973 song about an American POW in Vietnam) were hailed as anthems of the silent majority, and have been recognized as part of a recurring patriotic trend in American country music that also includes Charlie Daniels&#x27; &quot;In America&quot; and Lee Greenwood&#x27;s &quot;God Bless the USA&quot;. Although Gordon Friesen of &quot;Broadside&quot; magazine criticized Haggard for his &quot;[John] Birch–type songs against war dissenters&quot;, Haggard was popular with college students in the early 1970s, not only because of the ironic use of his songs by counterculture members, but also because his music was recognized as coming from an early country-folk tradition. Both &quot;Okie from Muskogee&quot; and &quot;The Fightin&#x27; Side of Me&quot; received extensive airplay on underground radio stations, and &quot;Okie&quot; was performed in concert by protest singers Arlo Guthrie and Phil Ochs.

===Later career===
Haggard&#x27;s 1970 LP &quot;A Tribute to the Best Damn Fiddle Player in the World&quot;, dedicated to Bob Wills, helped spark a permanent revival and expanded the audience for western swing. By this point, Haggard was one of the most famous country singers in the world, having enjoyed an immensely successful artistic and commercial run with Capitol, accumulating 24 number-one country singles since 1966.

In 1972, &quot;Let Me Tell You about A Song&quot;, the first TV special starring Haggard, was nationally syndicated by Capital Cities TV Productions. It was a semi-autobiographical musical profile of Haggard, akin to the contemporary &quot;Behind the Music&quot;, produced and directed by Michael Davis. The 1973 recession anthem, &quot;If We Make It Through December&quot;, furthered Haggard&#x27;s status as a champion of the working class. &quot;If We Make It Through December&quot; turned out to be Haggard and the Strangers&#x27; final crossover pop hit.

Haggard appeared on the cover of &quot;TIME&quot; on May 6, 1974. He also wrote and performed the theme song to the television series &quot;Movin&#x27; On&quot;, which in 1975 gave him and the Strangers another number-one country hit. During the early-to-mid-1970s, Haggard and the Strangers country chart domination continued with songs such as &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Look Back&quot;, &quot;Grandma Harp&quot;, &quot;Always Wanting You&quot;, and &quot;The Roots of My Raising&quot;. Between 1973 and 1976, he and the Strangers scored nine consecutive number-one country hits. In 1977, he switched to MCA Records and began exploring the themes of depression, alcoholism, and middle age on albums such as &quot;Serving 190 Proof&quot; and &quot;The Way I Am&quot;. Haggard sang a duet cover of Billy Burnette&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s A Little Love Between Friends&quot; with Lynda Carter in her 1980 television music special, &quot;Lynda Carter: Encore!&quot; In 1980, Haggard headlined the &quot;Bronco Billy&quot; soundtrack alongside Ronnie Milsap, which saw Haggard score a number-one hit with &quot;Bar Room Buddies&quot;, a duet with actor Clint Eastwood.

Haggard appeared in an episode of &quot;The Waltons&quot; titled &quot;The Comeback&quot;, season five, episode three, original air-date October 10, 1976. He played a bandleader named Red, who had been depressed since the death of his son (Ron Howard).

In 1981, Haggard published an autobiography, &quot;Sing Me Back Home&quot;. The same year, he provided the narration and theme for the movie &quot;The Legend of the Lone Ranger&quot;. The movie did not perform as well as expected attributing its commercial failure to the Wrather/Moore dispute which generated negative publicity. Haggard also changed record labels again in 1981, moving to Epic and releasing one of his most critically acclaimed albums, &quot;Big City&quot;, on which he was backed by the Strangers.

Between 1981 and 1985, Haggard scored 12 more top-10 country hits, with nine of them reaching number one, including &quot;My Favorite Memory&quot;, &quot;Going Where the Lonely Go&quot;, &quot;Someday When Things Are Good&quot;, and &quot;Natural High&quot;. In addition, Haggard recorded two chart-topping duets with George Jones—&quot;Yesterdays&#x27; Wine&quot; in 1982—and with Willie Nelson—&quot;Pancho and Lefty&quot; in 1983. Nelson believed the 1983 Academy Award-winning film &quot;Tender Mercies&quot;, about the life of fictional singer Mac Sledge, was based on the life of Merle Haggard. Actor Robert Duvall and other filmmakers denied this and claimed the character was based on nobody in particular. Duvall, however, said he was a big fan of Haggard&#x27;s.

In 1983, Haggard and his third wife Leona Williams divorced after five stormy years of marriage. The split served as a license to party for Haggard, who spent much of the next decade becoming mired in alcohol and drug problems. Haggard has stated that he was in his own mid-life crisis, or &quot;male menopause&quot;, around this time. He said in an interview from this period: &quot;Things that you&#x27;ve enjoyed for years don&#x27;t seem nearly as important, and you&#x27;re at war with yourself as to what&#x27;s happening. &#x27;Why don&#x27;t I like that anymore? Why do I like this now?&#x27; And finally, I think you actually go through a biological change, you just, you become another... Your body is getting ready to die and your mind doesn&#x27;t agree.&quot; He was briefly a heavy user of cocaine but was able to quit. Despite these issues, he won a Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance for his 1984 remake of &quot;That&#x27;s the Way Love Goes&quot;.

Haggard was hampered by financial woes well into the 1990s, as his presence on the charts diminished in favor of newer country singers, such as George Strait and Randy Travis. Haggard&#x27;s last number-one hit was &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle Lucky Star&quot; from his smash album &quot;Chill Factor&quot; in 1988.

In 1989, Haggard recorded a song, &quot;Me and Crippled Soldiers Give a Damn&quot;, in response to the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision not to allow banning flag burning, considering it to be &quot;speech&quot; and therefore protected under the First Amendment. After CBS Records Nashville avoided releasing the song, Haggard bought his way out of the contract and signed with Curb Records, which was willing to release the song. Haggard commented about the situation, &quot;I&#x27;ve never been a guy that can do what people told me... It&#x27;s always been my nature to fight the system.&quot;

===Comeback===

In 2000, Haggard made a comeback of sorts, signing with the independent record label Anti and releasing the spare &quot;If I Could Only Fly&quot; to critical acclaim. He followed it in 2001 with &quot;Roots, vol. 1&quot;, a collection of Lefty Frizzell, Hank Williams, and Hank Thompson covers, along with three Haggard originals. The album, recorded in Haggard&#x27;s living room with no overdubs, featured Haggard&#x27;s longtime bandmates, the Strangers, as well as Frizzell&#x27;s original lead guitarist, Norman Stephens. In December 2004, Haggard spoke at length on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; about his incarceration as a young man and said it was &quot;hell&quot; and &quot;the scariest experience of my life&quot;.

When political opponents were attacking the Chicks for criticizing President George W. Bush&#x27;s 2003 invasion of Iraq, Haggard spoke up for the band on July 25, 2003, saying:

Haggard and the Strangers&#x27; number-one hit single &quot;Mama Tried&quot; is featured in the 2003 film &quot;Radio&quot; with Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ed Harris, as well as in Bryan Bertino&#x27;s &quot;The Strangers&quot; with Liv Tyler. In addition, his and the Strangers song &quot;Swingin&#x27; Doors&quot; can be heard in the film &quot;Crash (2004)&quot;, and his 1981 hit &quot;Big City&quot;, where he is backed by the Strangers, is heard in Joel and Ethan Coen&#x27;s film &quot;Fargo&quot;.

In October 2005, Haggard released his album &quot;Chicago Wind&quot; to mostly positive reviews. The album contained an anti-Iraq war song titled &quot;America First&quot;, in which he laments the nation&#x27;s economy and faltering infrastructure, applauds its soldiers, and sings, &quot;Let&#x27;s get out of Iraq, and get back on track.&quot; This follows from his 2003 release &quot;Haggard Like Never Before&quot; in which he includes a song, &quot;That&#x27;s the News&quot;.
Haggard released a bluegrass album, &quot;The Bluegrass Sessions&quot;, on October 2, 2007.

In 2008, Haggard was going to perform at Riverfest in Little Rock, Arkansas, but the concert was canceled because he was ailing, and three other concerts were canceled, as well. However, he was back on the road in June and successfully completed a tour that ended on October 19, 2008.

In April 2010, Haggard released a new album, &quot;I Am What I Am&quot;, to strong reviews, and he performed the title song on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; in February 2011. Haggard&#x27;s final concert was held in Oakland at the Paramount Theatre on February 13, 2016.

===Collaborations===
Haggard collaborated with many other artists over the course of his career. In the early 1960s, Haggard recorded duets with Bonnie Owens, who later became his wife, for Tally Records, scoring a minor hit with &quot;Just Between the Two of Us&quot;. As part of the deal that got Haggard signed to Capitol, producer Ken Nelson obtained the rights to Haggard&#x27;s Tally sides, including the duets with Owens, resulting in the release of Haggard&#x27;s first duet album with Owens and the Strangers in 1966, also entitled &quot;Just Between the Two of Us&quot;. The album reached number four on the country charts, and Haggard and Owens recorded a number of additional duets before their divorce in 1978. Haggard went on to record duets with George Jones, Willie Nelson, and Clint Eastwood, among others.

In 1970, Haggard released &quot;A Tribute to the Best Damn Fiddle Player in the World (or, My Salute to Bob Wills)&quot;, rounding up six of the remaining members of the Texas Playboys to record the tribute: Johnnie Lee Wills, Eldon Shamblin, Tiny Moore, Joe Holley, Johnny Gimble, and Alex Brashear. Haggard&#x27;s band, the Strangers, were also present during the recording, but Wills suffered a massive stroke after the first day of recording. Haggard arrived on the second day, devastated that he would not get to record with him, but the album helped return Wills to public consciousness, and set off a Western swing revival. Haggard did other tribute albums to Bob Wills over the next 40 years. In 1973 he appeared on &quot;For the Last Time: Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys&quot;. In 1994, Haggard collaborated with Asleep at the Wheel and many other artists influenced by the music of Bob Wills on an album titled &quot;A Tribute to the Music of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys&quot;. &quot;A Tribute&quot; was re-released on CD on the Koch label in 1995.

In 1972, Haggard agreed to produce Gram Parsons&#x27;s first solo album but backed out at the last minute. Warner Bros. arranged a meeting at Haggard&#x27;s Bakersfield home and the two musicians seemed to hit it off, but later on the afternoon of the first session, Haggard canceled. Parsons, an enormous Haggard fan, was crushed, with his wife Gretchen telling Meyer, &quot;Merle not producing Gram was probably one of the greatest disappointments in Gram&#x27;s life. Merle was very nice, very sweet, but he had his own enemies and his own demons.&quot; In 1980, Haggard said of Parsons, in an interview with Mark Rose, &quot;He was a pussy. Hell, he was just a long-haired kid. I thought he was a good writer. He was not wild, though. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s funny to me. All these guys running around in long hair talking about being wild and Rolling Stones. I don&#x27;t think someone abusing themselves on drugs determines how wild they are. It might determine how ignorant they are.&quot;

In 1982, Haggard recorded &quot;A Taste of Yesterday&#x27;s Wine&quot; with George Jones, an album that produced two top-10 hits, including the number-one &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Wine&quot;. In 2006, the pair released a sequel, &quot;Kickin&#x27; Out the Footlights...Again&quot;.

Haggard released the duet album &quot;Pancho &amp; Lefty&quot; with Willie Nelson in 1983, with the title track becoming an enormous hit for the duo. In 1987, a second, less successful LP, &quot;Seashores of Old Mexico&quot;, was also released, and the pair worked together again with Ray Price in 2007, releasing the album &quot;Last of the Breed&quot;. In 2015, they released their sixth and final duet album, &quot;Django and Jimmie&quot;. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;It&#x27;s All Going to Pot&quot;, was a subtle reference to smoking marijuana, and the music video for the song showed Haggard and Nelson smoking joints while singing in a recording studio.

In 1983, Haggard got permission from Epic Records to collaborate with then-wife Leona Williams on Polydor Records, releasing &quot;Heart to Heart&quot; in 1983. The album, on which they were backed by the Strangers, was not a hit, peaking at number 44.

In 2001, Haggard released an album of gospel songs with Albert E. Brumley called &quot;Two Old Friends&quot;. In 2002, Haggard collaborated with longtime friend and fellow recording artist Chester Smith (founder of television broadcasting company Sainte Partners II, L.P. and owner of several stations in California and Oregon) with a CD titled &quot;California Blend&quot;. The CD features classic country, western, and gospel tracks performed by both Smith and Haggard.

In 2005, Haggard was featured as a guest vocalist on Gretchen Wilson&#x27;s song &quot;Politically Uncorrect&quot;, which earned a Grammy nomination for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. He is also featured singing a verse on Eric Church&#x27;s 2006 song &quot;Pledge Allegiance to the Hag&quot;.

In 2005, Haggard was featured as a guest vocalist on Blaine Larsen&#x27;s song &quot;If Merle Would Sing My Song&quot;.

In 2010, Haggard was featured along with Ralph Nader, Willie Nelson, Gatewood Galbraith and Julia Butterfly Hill in the documentary film &quot;&quot; directed by Michael P. Henning.

In 2015, Haggard was featured as a guest vocalist on Don Henley&#x27;s song &quot;The Cost of Living&quot; on the album &quot;Cass County&quot;. Henley would later say he was &quot;nervous&quot;, but &quot;happily surprised&quot; that Haggard joined him on the track.

In 2017, Haggard appeared alongside Willie Nelson in the award-winning documentary &quot;The American Epic Sessions&quot; directed by Bernard MacMahon. They performed a song Haggard had composed for the film, &quot;The Only Man Wilder Than Me&quot; and Bob Wills&#x27; classic &quot;Old Fashioned Love&quot;, which they recorded live on the restored first electrical sound recording system from the 1920s. It was the last filmed performance of the pair, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commenting &quot;in the final performance of Sessions, Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard perform the duet &quot;The Only Man Wilder Than Me&quot;. Haggard has a look of complete joy on his face throughout the session in the old-timey recording set-up once used by his musical heroes.&quot;

Haggard&#x27;s last recording, a song called &quot;Kern River Blues&quot;, described his departure from Bakersfield in the late 1970s and his displeasure with politicians. The song was recorded February 9, 2016, and features his son Ben on guitar. This record was released on May 12, 2016.

==Equipment==
Haggard endorsed Fender guitars and had a Custom Artist signature model Telecaster. The guitar is a modified Telecaster Thinline with laminated top of figured maple, set neck with deep carved heel, birdseye maple fingerboard with 22 jumbo frets, ivoroid pickguard and binding, gold hardware, abalone Tuff Dog Tele peghead inlay, 2-Colour Sunburst finish, and a pair of Fender Texas Special Tele single-coil pickups with custom-wired 4-way pickup switching. He also played six-string acoustic models. In 2001, C. F. Martin &amp; Company introduced a limited edition Merle Haggard Signature Edition 000-28SMH acoustic guitar available with or without factory-installed electronics.

==Personal life==

===Wives and children===
Haggard was married five times, first to Leona Hobbs from 1956 to 1964. They had four children: Dana, Marty, Kelli, and Noel.

Shortly after divorcing Hobbs, in 1965, he married singer Bonnie Owens, the former wife of Buck Owens. Haggard credited her with helping him make his big break as a country artist. He shared the writing credit with Owens for his hit &quot;Today I Started Loving You Again&quot; and acknowledged, including on stage, that the song was about a sudden burst of special feelings he experienced for her while they were touring together. She also helped care for Haggard&#x27;s children from his first marriage and was the maid of honor for Haggard&#x27;s third marriage. Haggard and Owens divorced in 1978 but remained close friends as Owens continued as his backing vocalist until her death in 2006.

In 1978, Haggard married Leona Williams. In 1983, they divorced. In 1985 Haggard married Debbie Parret; they divorced in 1991. He married his fifth wife, Theresa Ann Lane, on September 11, 1993. They had two children, Jenessa and Ben.

===Cigarette and drug use===
Haggard said he started smoking marijuana in 1978, when he was 41 years old. He admitted that in 1983, he bought &quot;$2,000 (worth) of cocaine&quot; and partied for five months afterward, when he said he finally realized his condition and quit for good. He quit smoking cigarettes in 1991, and stopped smoking marijuana in 1995. However, a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine interview in 2009 indicated that he had resumed regular marijuana smoking.

===Illness and death===
Haggard underwent angioplasty in 1995 to unblock clogged arteries. On November 9, 2008, it was announced that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer in May and undergone surgery on November 3, during which part of his lung was removed. Haggard returned home on November 8. Less than two months after his cancer surgery, he played two shows on January 2 and 3, 2009, in Bakersfield at Buck Owens Crystal Palace, and continued to tour and record until shortly before his death.

On December 5, 2015, Haggard was treated at an undisclosed hospital in California for pneumonia. He made a recovery, but postponed several concerts.

In March 2016, Haggard was once again hospitalized. His concerts for April were canceled due to his ongoing double pneumonia. On the morning of April 6, 2016, his 79th birthday, he died of complications from pneumonia at his home in Palo Cedro, Shasta County, California. Haggard was buried in a private funeral at his ranch on April 9, 2016; longtime friend Marty Stuart officiated.

==Legacy and honors==

During his long career, Haggard received numerous awards from the Academy of Country Music, Country Music Association, and National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (Grammy Awards) (see Awards). He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1977, the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in 1994, and the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame in 1997. In 2006, he received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and was also honored as a BMI Icon at the 54th annual BMI Pop Awards that same year. During his songwriting career up to that time, Haggard had earned 48 BMI Country Awards, nine BMI Pop Awards, a BMI R&amp;B Award, and 16 BMI &quot;Million-Air&quot; awards, all from a catalog of songs that added up to over 25 million performances.

Haggard accepted a Kennedy Center Honor on December 4, 2010, from the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in recognition of his lifetime achievement and &quot;outstanding contribution to American culture&quot;. The following day, he was honored at a gala in Washington, DC, with musical performances by Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, Sheryl Crow, Vince Gill, Jamey Johnson, Kid Rock, Miranda Lambert, and Brad Paisley. This tribute was featured on the December 28, 2010, CBS telecast of the Kennedy Center Honors.

In July 2007, a three-and-a-half-mile stretch of 7th Standard Road in Oildale, California, where Haggard grew up, was renamed Merle Haggard Drive in his honor. It stretches from North Chester Avenue west to U.S. Route 99 and provides access to the William M. Thomas airport terminal at Meadows Field Airport. Haggard played two shows to raise money to pay for the changes in road signage. In 2015, the converted boxcar in which the Haggard family lived in Oildale was moved to the Kern County Museum for historic preservation and restoration.

On November 6, 2013, the mayor of Winchester, Virginia, awarded Haggard the Key to the City at the Patsy Cline Theatre after a sold-out show by Bonnie Blue Concerts.

On June 14, 2013, the California State University, Bakersfield, awarded Haggard the honorary degree of Doctor of Fine Arts. Haggard stepped to the podium and said, &quot;Thank you. It&#x27;s nice to be noticed.&quot;

On January 26, 2014, Haggard performed his 1969 song &quot;Okie from Muskogee&quot; at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards along with Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, and Blake Shelton.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Haggard at number 138 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

===Influence===
Haggard&#x27;s guitar playing and voice gave his country songs a hard-edged, blues-like style in many cuts. Although he was outspoken in his dislike for modern country music, he praised George Strait, Toby Keith, Alan Jackson, and Sturgill Simpson. Haggard also had an interest in jazz music, and stated in an interview in 1986 that he wanted to be remembered as &quot;the greatest jazz guitar player in the world that loved to play country&quot;. Keith singled out Haggard as a major influence on his career. 

As noted by an article published in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; upon Haggard&#x27;s death, &quot;Respect for the Hag [Haggard] as an icon, both for his musical status and his personal views, is a common theme&quot; in country music. Many country music acts have paid tribute to Haggard by mentioning him in their songs (a fact aided by his first name rhyming with &quot;girl&quot;, a common theme in country songs). These include:
* Collin Raye recorded &quot;My Kind of Girl&quot;, which includes the line, &quot;How &#x27;bout some music/She said have you got any Merle/That&#x27;s when I knew she was my kind of girl.&quot;
* In 2000, Alan Jackson and George Strait sang &quot;Murder on Music Row&quot;, which criticizes mainstream country trends: &quot;The Hag wouldn&#x27;t have a chance on today&#x27;s radio/Because they committed murder down on music row.&quot;
* In 2005, the country rock duo Brooks &amp; Dunn sang &quot;Just Another Neon Night&quot; off their &quot;Hillbilly Deluxe&quot; album. In the song, Ronnie Dunn said, &quot;He&#x27;s got an Eastwood grin and a Tulare swagger/Hollerin&#x27; turn off that rap/And play me some Haggard.&quot; Brooks and Dunn also reference Haggard in 1993&#x27;s &quot;Rock My World (little country girl)&quot; off their &quot;Hard Workin&#x27; Man&quot; album as they sing &quot;Acts like Madonna but she listens to Merle/Rock my world little country girl.&quot;
* In 2009, Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s song Wings refers to Haggard and his song Silver Wings in the verse &quot;You have wings look and see, Silver wings like Merle and me&quot;.
* LeAnn Rimes mentions him in her 2013 song, &quot;I Do Now&quot;: &quot;Thank God for Merle Haggard, he&#x27;s right, the bottle let me down.&quot;
* Gretchen Wilson&#x27;s song &quot;Politically Uncorrect&quot; and Eric Church&#x27;s song &quot;Pledge Allegiance to the Hag&quot; both contain tributes to Haggard, as well as featuring him as a guest vocalist. 
*Country singer David Nail references the Haggard song &quot;Mama Tried&quot; in the lyrics to his song &quot;The Sound of a Million Dreams&quot; from his 2011 album of the same name: &quot;...when I hear Mama Tried I still break down and cry And pull to the side of the road...&quot;. The song was written by Phil Vassar &amp; Scooter Carusoe.
* In John Anderson&#x27;s song &quot;Honky Tonk Saturday Night&quot;, he sings the lines, &quot;I went to the jukebox and played some Merle Haggard/Oh me and the waitress think he&#x27;s outta sight&quot;.
* Cody Johnson centralizes Merle in his song &quot;Monday Morning Merle&quot;, with a reference in the chorus &quot;...turns up &#x27;Misery and Gin&#x27;, here we are again - Monday Morning Merle.&quot;
* Cody Jinks song Hippies and Cowboys has the following lyrics Some old drunk on a bar stool on a Merle Haggard tuneThat&#x27;s my kind of room&quot;

In the 1970s, several rock acts responded in their own songs to Haggard&#x27;s criticism of hippie counterculture in &quot;Okie from Muskogee&quot; and &quot;The Fightin&#x27; Side of Me&quot;. The Youngbloods answered &quot;Okie from Muskogee&quot; with &quot;Hippie from Olema&quot;, in which, in one repetition of the chorus, they change the line, &quot;We still take in strangers if they&#x27;re ragged&quot; to &quot;We still take in strangers if they&#x27;re haggard.&quot; Nick Gravenites, of Big Brother and the Holding Company, paid Haggard a tongue-in-cheek tribute with the song, &quot;I&#x27;ll Change Your Flat Tire, Merle&quot;, later covered by other artists including Pure Prairie League. Despite these critiques, the Grateful Dead performed &quot;Mama Tried&quot; over 300 times, and &quot;Sing Me Back Home&quot; approximately 40 times.

The Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd more respectfully referenced Haggard in their song, &quot;Railroad Song&quot;, which contains the lyric, &quot;Well I&#x27;m a ride this train Lord until I find out/What Jimmie Rodgers and the Hag was all about.&quot; Skynyrd also performed both a cover of &quot;Honky Tonk Night Time Man&quot; and their own take on the song with &quot;Jacksonville Kid&quot; (found on the 2001 CD reissue of the album) on their album &quot;Street Survivors&quot;. He described himself as a student of music, philosophy, and communication. He would discuss jazzman Howard Roberts guitar playing, life after death and the unique speaking technique of Garner Ted Armstrong of &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; with enthusiasm and authority.

===Television acting===
Merle appeared in season five, episode three of &quot;The Waltons&quot; called &quot;The Comeback&quot;. He played Red Turner, a local musician who had become depressed and withdrawn after the death of his son, played by Ron Howard, in the episode called &quot;The Gift&quot;.

<text>Troy weight is a system of units of mass that originated in the Kingdom of England in the 15th century and is primarily used in the precious metals industry. The troy weight units are the grain, the pennyweight (24 grains), the troy ounce (20 pennyweights), and the troy pound (12 troy ounces). The troy grain is equal to the grain unit of the avoirdupois system, but the troy ounce is heavier than the avoirdupois ounce, and the troy pound is lighter than the avoirdupois pound. Legally, one troy ounce (oz t) equals exactly 31.1034768 grams.

==Etymology==
Troy weight is generally supposed to take its name from the French market town of Troyes where English merchants traded at least as early as the early 9th century. The name &quot;troy&quot; is first attested in 1390, describing the weight of a platter, in an account of the travels in Europe of the Earl of Derby.

Charles Moore Watson (1844–1916) proposes an alternative etymology: &quot;The Assize of Weights and Measures&quot; (also known as ), one of the statutes of uncertain date from the reign of either Henry III or Edward I, thus before 1307, specifies &quot;&quot;—which the Public Record Commissioners translate as &quot;troy weight&quot;. The word refers to markets. Wright&#x27;s &quot;The English Dialect Dictionary&quot; lists the word &quot;troi&quot; as meaning a balance, related to the alternate form &#x27;tron&#x27; which also means market or the place of weighing. From this, Watson suggests that &#x27;troy&#x27; derives from the manner of weighing by balance precious goods such as bullion or drugs; in contrast to the word &#x27;avoirdupois&#x27; used to describe bulk goods such as corn or coal, sometimes weighed in ancient times by a kind of steelyard called the auncel.

Troy weight referred to the Tower system; the earliest reference to the modern troy weights is in 1414.

==History==
The origin of the troy weight system is unknown. Although the name probably comes from the Champagne fairs at Troyes, in northeastern France. English troy weights were nearly identical to the troy weight system of Bremen. (The Bremen troy ounce had a mass of 480.8 British Imperial grains.)

Many aspects of the troy weight system were indirectly derived from the Roman monetary system. Before they used coins, early Romans used bronze bars of varying weights as currency. An (&quot;heavy bronze&quot;) weighed one pound. One twelfth of an was called an , or in English, an &quot;ounce&quot;. Before the adoption of the metric system, many systems of troy weights were in use in various parts of Europe, among them Holland troy, Paris troy, etc. Their values varied from one another by up to several percentage points. Troy weights were first used in England in the 15th century and were made official for gold and silver in 1527. The British Imperial system of weights and measures (also known as Imperial units) was established in 1824, prior to which the troy weight system was a subset of pre-Imperial English units.

The troy ounce in modern use is essentially the same as the British Imperial troy ounce (1824–1971), adopted as an official weight standard for United States coinage by act of Congress on May 19, 1828. The British Imperial troy ounce (known more commonly simply as the imperial troy ounce) was based on, and virtually identical with, the pre-1824 British troy ounce and the pre-1707 English troy ounce. (1824 was the year the British Imperial system of weights and measures was adopted; 1707 was the year of the Act of Union which created the Kingdom of Great Britain.) Troy ounces have been used in England since the early 15th century, and the English troy ounce was officially adopted for coinage in 1527. Before that time, various sorts of troy ounces were in use on the continent.

The troy ounce and grain were also part of the apothecaries&#x27; system. This was long used in medicine, but has been largely replaced by the metric system (milligrams). The only troy weight in widespread use is the British Imperial troy ounce and its American counterpart. Both are based on a grain of 0.06479891 gram (exact, by definition), with 480 grains to a troy ounce (compared with grains for an ounce avoirdupois). The British Empire abolished the 12-ounce troy pound in the 19th century. It has been retained, though rarely used, in the American system. Larger amounts of precious metals are conventionally counted in hundreds or thousands of troy ounces, or in kilograms.

Troy ounces have been and are still often used in precious metal markets in countries that otherwise use International System of Units (SI). However, the People&#x27;s Bank of China which had been using troy measurements in minting Gold Pandas since 1982 from 2016 specifies Chinese bullion coins in an integer numbers of grams.

==Units of measurement==
===Troy pound (lb t) ===

The troy pound (lb t) consists of twelve troy ounces and thus is . (An avoirdupois pound is approximately 21.53% heavier at , and consists of sixteen avoirdupois ounces).

===Troy ounce (oz t) ===
A troy ounce weighs 480 grains. Since the implementation of the international yard and pound agreement of 1 July 1959, the grain measure is defined as precisely . Thus one troy ounce = × /grain = . Since the ounce avoirdupois is defined as 437.5 grains, a troy ounce is exactly = or about 1.09714 ounces avoirdupois or about 9.7% more. The troy ounce for trading precious metals is considered to be sufficiently approximated by 31.10 g in EU directive 80/181/EEC.&lt;ref name=&quot;80/181/EER&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch troy system is based on a mark of 8 ounces, the ounce of 20 engels (pennyweights), the engel of 32 as. The mark was rated as 3,798 troy grains or 246.084 grams. The divisions are identical to the tower system.

===Pennyweight (dwt)===
The pennyweight symbol is &quot;dwt&quot;. One pennyweight weighs 24 grains, and 20 pennyweights make one troy ounce. Because there were 12 troy ounces in the old troy pound, there would have been 240 pennyweights to the pound (mass) just as there were 240 pennies in the original pound-sterling. However, prior to 1526, the English pound sterling was based on the tower pound, which is of a troy pound. The &quot;d&quot; in &quot;dwt&quot; stands for &quot;denarius&quot;, the ancient Roman coin that equates loosely to a penny. The symbol &quot;d&quot; for penny can be recognized in the form of British pre-decimal pennies, in which pounds, shillings, and pence were indicated using the symbols &quot;£&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, and &quot;d&quot;, respectively.

===Troy grain===
There is no specific &#x27;troy grain&#x27;. All Imperial systems use the same measure of mass called a grain (historically of barley), each weighing of an avoirdupois pound (and thus a little under 65 milligrams).

===Mint masses===
Mint masses, also known as &quot;moneyers&#x27; masses&quot;, were legalized by Act of Parliament dated 17 July 1649 entitled &quot;An Act touching the monies and coins of England&quot;. A grain is 20 mites, a mite is 24 droits, a droit is 20 perits, a perit is 24 blanks.

<text>Rounding or rounding off means replacing a number with an approximate value that has a shorter, simpler, or more explicit representation. For example, replacing $ with $, the fraction 312/937 with 1/3, or the expression √2 with .

Rounding is often done to obtain a value that is easier to report and communicate than the original. Rounding can also be important to avoid misleadingly precise reporting of a computed number, measurement, or estimate; for example, a quantity that was computed as but is known to be accurate only to within a few hundred units is usually better stated as &quot;about &quot;.

On the other hand, rounding of exact numbers will introduce some round-off error in the reported result. Rounding is almost unavoidable when reporting many computations – especially when dividing two numbers in integer or fixed-point arithmetic; when computing mathematical functions such as square roots, logarithms, and sines; or when using a floating-point representation with a fixed number of significant digits. In a sequence of calculations, these rounding errors generally accumulate, and in certain ill-conditioned cases they may make the result meaningless.

Accurate rounding of transcendental mathematical functions is difficult because the number of extra digits that need to be calculated to resolve whether to round up or down cannot be known in advance. This problem is known as &quot;the table-maker&#x27;s dilemma&quot;.

Rounding has many similarities to the quantization that occurs when physical quantities must be encoded by numbers or digital signals.

A wavy equals sign ([[≈]], &quot;approximately equal to&quot;) is sometimes used to indicate rounding of exact numbers, e.g. 9.98 ≈ 10. This sign was introduced by Alfred George Greenhill in 1892.

Ideal characteristics of rounding methods include:

# Rounding should be done by a function. This way, when the same input is rounded in different instances, the output is unchanged.
# Calculations done with rounding should be close to those done without rounding.
#* As a result of (1) and (2), the output from rounding should be close to its input, often as close as possible by some metric.
# To be considered rounding, the range will be a subset of the domain, in general discrete. A classical range is the integers, [[integer|Z]].
# Rounding should preserve symmetries that already exist between the domain and range. With finite precision (or a discrete domain), this translates to removing bias.
# A rounding method should have utility in computer science or human arithmetic where finite precision is used, and speed is a consideration.

Because it is not usually possible for a method to satisfy all ideal characteristics, many different rounding methods exist.

As a general rule, rounding is idempotent; i.e., once a number has been rounded, rounding it again to the same precision will not change its value. Rounding functions are also monotonic; i.e., rounding two numbers to the same absolute precision will not exchange their order (but may give the same value). In the general case of a discrete range, they are piecewise constant functions.

==Types of rounding==
Typical rounding problems include:
==Rounding to integer==
The most basic form of rounding is to replace an arbitrary number by an integer. All the following rounding modes are concrete implementations of an abstract single-argument &quot;round()&quot; procedure. These are true functions (with the exception of those that use randomness).

===Directed rounding to an integer===
These four methods are called directed rounding to an integer, as the displacements from the original number to the rounded value are all directed toward or away from the same limiting value (0, +∞, or −∞). Directed rounding is used in interval arithmetic and is often required in financial calculations.

If is positive, round-down is the same as round-toward-zero, and round-up is the same as round-away-from-zero. If is negative, round-down is the same as round-away-from-zero, and round-up is the same as round-toward-zero. In any case, if is an integer, is just .

Where many calculations are done in sequence, the choice of rounding method can have a very significant effect on the result. A famous instance involved a new index set up by the Vancouver Stock Exchange in 1982. It was initially set at 1000.000 (three decimal places of accuracy), and after 22 months had fallen to about 520, although the market appeared to be rising. The problem was caused by the index being recalculated thousands of times daily, and always being truncated (rounded down) to 3 decimal places, in such a way that the rounding errors accumulated. Recalculating the index for the same period using rounding to the nearest thousandth rather than truncation corrected the index value from 524.811 up to 1098.892.

For the examples below, refers to the sign function applied to the original number, .

====Rounding down====
One may round down (or take the floor, or round toward negative infinity): is the largest integer that does not exceed .

: formula_1

For example, 23.7 gets rounded to 23, and −23.2 gets rounded to −24.

====Rounding up====
One may also round up (or take the ceiling, or round toward positive infinity): is the smallest integer that is not less than .

: formula_2

For example, 23.2 gets rounded to 24, and −23.7 gets rounded to −23.

====Rounding toward zero====
One may also round toward zero (or truncate, or round away from infinity): is the integer that is closest to such that it is between 0 and (included); i.e. is the integer part of , without its fraction digits.

: formula_3

For example, 23.7 gets rounded to 23, and −23.7 gets rounded to −23.

====Rounding away from zero====
One may also round away from zero (or round toward infinity): is the integer that is closest to 0 (or equivalently, to ) such that is between 0 and (included).

: formula_4

For example, 23.2 gets rounded to 24, and −23.2 gets rounded to −24.

===Rounding to the nearest integer===
These six methods are called rounding to the nearest integer. Rounding a number to the nearest integer requires some tie-breaking rule for those cases when is exactly half-way between two integers – that is, when the fraction part of is exactly 0.5.

If it were not for the 0.5 fractional parts, the round-off errors introduced by the round to nearest method would be symmetric: for every fraction that gets rounded down (such as 0.268), there is a complementary fraction (namely, 0.732) that gets rounded up by the same amount.

When rounding a large set of fixed-point numbers with uniformly distributed fractional parts, the rounding errors by all values, with the omission of those having 0.5 fractional part, would statistically compensate each other. This means that the expected (average) value of the rounded numbers is equal to the expected value of the original numbers when numbers with fractional part 0.5 from the set are removed.

In practice, floating-point numbers are typically used, which have even more computational nuances because they are not equally spaced.

====Rounding half up====
One may round half up (or round half toward positive infinity), a tie-breaking rule that is widely used in many disciplines. That is, half-way values of are always rounded up. If the fractional part of is exactly 0.5, then 

: formula_5

For example, 23.5 gets rounded to 24, and −23.5 gets rounded to −23.

Some programming languages (such as Java and Python) use &quot;half up&quot; to refer to &quot;round half away from zero&quot; rather than &quot;round half toward positive infinity&quot;.

This method only requires checking one digit to determine rounding direction in two&#x27;s complement and similar representations.

====Rounding half down====
One may also round half down (or round half toward negative infinity) as opposed to the more common &quot;round half up&quot;. If the fractional part of is exactly 0.5, then 

: formula_6

For example, 23.5 gets rounded to 23, and −23.5 gets rounded to −24.

Some programming languages (such as Java and Python) use &quot;half down&quot; to refer to &quot;round half toward zero&quot; rather than &quot;round half toward negative infinity&quot;.

====Rounding half toward zero====
One may also round half toward zero (or round half away from infinity) as opposed to the conventional &quot;round half away from zero&quot;. If the fractional part of is exactly 0.5, then if is positive, and if is negative.

: formula_7

For example, 23.5 gets rounded to 23, and −23.5 gets rounded to −23.

This method treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall positive/negative bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. It does, however, still have bias toward zero.

====Rounding half away from zero====
One may also round half away from zero (or round half toward infinity), a tie-breaking rule that is commonly taught and used, namely: If the fractional part of is exactly 0.5, then if is positive, and if is negative.

: formula_8

For example, 23.5 gets rounded to 24, and −23.5 gets rounded to −24.

This can be more efficient on computers that use sign-magnitude representation for the values to be rounded, because only the first omitted digit needs to be considered to determine if it rounds up or down. This is one method used when rounding to significant figures due to its simplicity.

This method, also known as commercial rounding, treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall positive/negative bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. It does, however, still have bias away from zero.

It is often used for currency conversions and price roundings (when the amount is first converted into the smallest significant subdivision of the currency, such as cents of a euro) as it is easy to explain by just considering the first fractional digit, independently of supplementary precision digits or sign of the amount (for strict equivalence between the paying and recipient of the amount).

====Rounding half to even====
One may also round half to even, a tie-breaking rule without positive/negative bias &quot;and&quot; without bias toward/away from zero. By this convention, if the fractional part of is 0.5, then is the even integer nearest to . Thus, for example, 23.5 becomes 24, as does 24.5; however, −23.5 becomes −24, as does −24.5. This function minimizes the expected error when summing over rounded figures, even when the inputs are mostly positive or mostly negative, provided they are neither mostly even nor mostly odd.

This variant of the round-to-nearest method is also called convergent rounding, statistician&#x27;s rounding, Dutch rounding, Gaussian rounding, odd–even rounding, or bankers&#x27; rounding.

This is the default rounding mode used in IEEE 754 operations for results in binary floating-point formats.

By eliminating bias, repeated addition or subtraction of independent numbers, as in a one-dimensional random walk, will give a rounded result with an error that tends to grow in proportion to the square root of the number of operations rather than linearly.

However, this rule distorts the distribution by increasing the probability of evens relative to odds. Typically this is less important than the biases that are eliminated by this method.

====Rounding half to odd====
One may also round half to odd, a similar tie-breaking rule to round half to even. In this approach, if the fractional part of is 0.5, then is the odd integer nearest to . Thus, for example, 23.5 becomes 23, as does 22.5; while −23.5 becomes −23, as does −22.5.

This method is also free from positive/negative bias and bias toward/away from zero, provided the numbers to be rounded are neither mostly even nor mostly odd. It also shares the round half to even property of distorting the original distribution, as it increases the probability of odds relative to evens. It was the method used for bank balances in the United Kingdom when it decimalized its currency.

This variant is almost never used in computations, except in situations where one wants to avoid increasing the scale of floating-point numbers, which have a limited exponent range. With &quot;round half to even&quot;, a non-infinite number would round to infinity, and a small value would round to a normal non-zero value. Effectively, this mode prefers preserving the existing scale of tie numbers, avoiding out-of-range results when possible for numeral systems of even radix (such as binary and decimal)..

===Rounding to prepare for shorter precision===
This rounding mode is used to avoid getting a potentially wrong result after multiple roundings. This can be achieved if all roundings except the final one are done using rounding to prepare for shorter precision (&quot;RPSP&quot;), and only the final rounding uses the externally requested mode.

With decimal arithmetic, final digits of 0 and 5 are avoided; if there is a choice between numbers with the least significant digit 0 or 1, 4 or 5, 5 or 6, 9 or 0, then the digit different from 0 or 5 shall be selected; otherwise, the choice is arbitrary. IBM defines that, in the latter case, a digit with the smaller magnitude shall be selected. RPSP can be applied with the step between two consequent roundings as small as a single digit (for example, rounding to 1/10 can be applied after rounding to 1/100).
For example, when rounding to integer,
* 20.0 is rounded to 20;
* 20.01, 20.1, 20.9, 20.99, 21, 21.01, 21.9, 21.99 are rounded to 21;
* 22.0, 22.1, 22.9, 22.99 are rounded to 22;
* 24.0, 24.1, 24.9, 24.99 are rounded to 24;
* 25.0 is rounded to 25;
* 25.01, 25.1 are rounded to 26.

In the example from &quot;Double rounding&quot; section, rounding 9.46 to one decimal gives 9.4, which rounding to integer in turn gives 9.

With binary arithmetic, this rounding is also called &quot;round to odd&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;round half to odd&quot;). For example, when rounding to 1/4 (0.01 in binary),
* ⇒ result is 2 (10.00 in binary)
* ⇒ result is 2.25 (10.01 in binary)
* ⇒ result is 2.5 (10.10 in binary)
* ⇒ result is 2.75 (10.11 in binary)
* ⇒ result is 3 (11.00 in binary)

For correct results with binary arithmetic, each rounding step must remove at least 2 binary digits, otherwise, wrong results may appear. For example,
* 3.125 RPSP to 1/4 ⇒ result is 3.25
* 3.25 RPSP to 1/2 ⇒ result is 3.5
* 3.5 round-half-to-even to 1 ⇒ result is 4 (wrong)

If the erroneous middle step is removed, the final rounding to integer rounds 3.25 to the correct value of 3.

RPSP is implemented in hardware in IBM zSeries and pSeries. In Python module &quot;Decimal&quot;, Tcl module &quot;math&quot;, Haskell package &quot;decimal-arithmetic&quot;, and possibly others, this mode is called ROUND_05UP or round05up.

===Randomized rounding to an integer===

====Alternating tie-breaking====
One method, more obscure than most, is to alternate direction when rounding a number with 0.5 fractional part. All others are rounded to the closest integer. Whenever the fractional part is 0.5, alternate rounding up or down: for the first occurrence of a 0.5 fractional part, round up, for the second occurrence, round down, and so on. Alternatively, the first 0.5 fractional part rounding can be determined by a random seed. &quot;Up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; can be any two rounding methods that oppose each other - toward and away from positive infinity or toward and away from zero.

If occurrences of 0.5 fractional parts occur significantly more than a restart of the occurrence &quot;counting&quot;, then it is effectively bias free. With guaranteed zero bias, it is useful if the numbers are to be summed or averaged.

====Random tie-breaking====
If the fractional part of is 0.5, choose randomly between and , with equal probability. All others are rounded to the closest integer.

Like round-half-to-even and round-half-to-odd, this rule is essentially free of overall bias, but it is also fair among even and odd values. An advantage over alternate tie-breaking is that the last direction of rounding on the 0.5 fractional part does not have to be &quot;remembered&quot;.

====Stochastic rounding====
Rounding as follows to one of the closest integer toward negative infinity and the closest integer toward positive infinity, with a probability dependent on the proximity is called stochastic rounding and will give an unbiased result on average.
:formula_9

For example, 1.6 would be rounded to 1 with probability 0.4 and to 2 with probability 0.6.

Stochastic rounding can be accurate in a way that a rounding function can never be. For example, suppose one started with 0 and added 0.3 to that one hundred times while rounding the running total between every addition. The result would be 0 with regular rounding, but with stochastic rounding, the expected result would be 30, which is the same value obtained without rounding. This can be useful in machine learning where the training may use low precision arithmetic iteratively. Stochastic rounding is also a way to achieve 1-dimensional dithering.

===Comparison of approaches for rounding to an integer===
==Rounding to other values==

===Rounding to a specified multiple===
The most common type of rounding is to round to an integer; or, more generally, to an integer multiple of some increment – such as rounding to whole tenths of seconds, hundredths of a dollar, to whole multiples of 1/2 or 1/8 inch, to whole dozens or thousands, etc.

In general, rounding a number to a multiple of some specified positive value entails the following steps:
:formula_10

For example, rounding dollars to whole cents (i.e., to a multiple of 0.01) entails computing , then rounding that to 218, and finally computing .

When rounding to a predetermined number of significant digits, the increment depends on the magnitude of the number to be rounded (or of the rounded result).

The increment is normally a finite fraction in whatever numeral system is used to represent the numbers. For display to humans, that usually means the decimal numeral system (that is, is an integer times a power of 10, like 1/1000 or 25/100). For intermediate values stored in digital computers, it often means the binary numeral system ( is an integer times a power of 2).

The abstract single-argument &quot;round()&quot; function that returns an integer from an arbitrary real value has at least a dozen distinct concrete definitions presented in the rounding to integer section. The abstract two-argument &quot;roundToMultiple()&quot; function is formally defined here, but in many cases it is used with the implicit value for the increment and then reduces to the equivalent abstract single-argument function, with also the same dozen distinct concrete definitions.

===Logarithmic rounding===
====Rounding to a specified power====
Rounding to a specified &quot;power&quot; is very different from rounding to a specified &quot;multiple&quot;; for example, it is common in computing to need to round a number to a whole power of 2. The steps, in general, to round a positive number to a power of some positive number other than 1, are:
:formula_11

Many of the caveats applicable to rounding to a multiple are applicable to rounding to a power.

====Scaled rounding====
This type of rounding, which is also named rounding to a logarithmic scale, is a variant of rounding to a specified power. Rounding on a logarithmic scale is accomplished by taking the log of the amount and doing normal rounding to the nearest value on the log scale.

For example, resistors are supplied with preferred numbers on a logarithmic scale. In particular, for resistors with a 10% accuracy, they are supplied with nominal values 100, 120, 150, 180, 220, etc. rounded to multiples of 10 (E12 series). If a calculation indicates a resistor of 165 ohms is required then , and . The logarithm of 165 is closer to the logarithm of 180 therefore a 180 ohm resistor would be the first choice if there are no other considerations.

Whether a value rounds to or depends upon whether the squared value is greater than or less than the product . The value 165 rounds to 180 in the resistors example because is greater than .

===Floating-point rounding===
In floating-point arithmetic, rounding aims to turn a given value into a value with a specified number of digits. In other words, should be a multiple of a number that depends on the magnitude of . The number is a power of the base (usually 2 or 10) of the floating-point representation.

Apart from this detail, all the variants of rounding discussed above apply to the rounding of floating-point numbers as well. The algorithm for such rounding is presented in the Scaled rounding section above, but with a constant scaling factor , and an integer base .

Where the rounded result would overflow the result for a directed rounding is either the appropriate signed infinity when &quot;rounding away from zero&quot;, or the highest representable positive finite number (or the lowest representable negative finite number if is negative), when &quot;rounding toward zero&quot;. The result of an overflow for the usual case of &quot;round to nearest&quot; is always the appropriate infinity.

===Rounding to a simple fraction===
In some contexts it is desirable to round a given number to a &quot;neat&quot; fraction – that is, the nearest fraction whose numerator and denominator do not exceed a given maximum. This problem is fairly distinct from that of rounding a value to a fixed number of decimal or binary digits, or to a multiple of a given unit . This problem is related to Farey sequences, the Stern–Brocot tree, and continued fractions.

===Rounding to an available value===
Finished lumber, writing paper, electronic components, and many other products are usually sold in only a few standard values.

Many design procedures describe how to calculate an approximate value, and then &quot;round&quot; to some standard size using phrases such as &quot;round down to nearest standard value&quot;, &quot;round up to nearest standard value&quot;, or &quot;round to nearest standard value&quot;.

When a set of preferred values is equally spaced on a logarithmic scale, choosing the closest preferred value to any given value can be seen as a form of scaled rounding. Such rounded values can be directly calculated.

=== Arbitrary bins ===

More general rounding rules can separate values at arbitrary break points, used for example in data binning. A related mathematically formalized tool is signpost sequences, which use notions of distance other than the simple difference – for example, a sequence may round to the integer with the smallest &quot;relative&quot; (percent) error.

==Rounding in other contexts==

===Dithering and error diffusion===
When digitizing continuous signals, such as sound waves, the overall effect of a number of measurements is more important than the accuracy of each individual measurement. In these circumstances, dithering, and a related technique, error diffusion, are normally used. A related technique called pulse-width modulation is used to achieve analog type output from an inertial device by rapidly pulsing the power with a variable duty cycle.

Error diffusion tries to ensure the error, on average, is minimized. When dealing with a gentle slope from one to zero, the output would be zero for the first few terms until the sum of the error and the current value becomes greater than 0.5, in which case a 1 is output and the difference subtracted from the error so far. Floyd–Steinberg dithering is a popular error diffusion procedure when digitizing images.

As a one-dimensional example, suppose the numbers , , , and occur in order and each is to be rounded to a multiple of . In this case the cumulative sums, , , , and , are each rounded to a multiple of : , , , and . The first of these and the differences of adjacent values give the desired rounded values: , , , and .

===Monte Carlo arithmetic===
Monte Carlo arithmetic is a technique in Monte Carlo methods where the rounding is randomly up or down. Stochastic rounding can be used for Monte Carlo arithmetic, but in general, just rounding up or down with equal probability is more often used. Repeated runs will give a random distribution of results which can indicate the stability of the computation.

===Exact computation with rounded arithmetic===
It is possible to use rounded arithmetic to evaluate the exact value of a function with integer domain and range. For example, if an integer is known to be a perfect square, its square root can be computed by converting to a floating-point value , computing the approximate square root of with floating point, and then rounding to the nearest integer . If is not too big, the floating-point round-off error in will be less than 0.5, so the rounded value will be the exact square root of . This is essentially why slide rules could be used for exact arithmetic.

===Double rounding===

Rounding a number twice in succession to different levels of precision, with the latter precision being coarser, is not guaranteed to give the same result as rounding once to the final precision except in the case of directed rounding. For instance rounding 9.46 to one decimal gives 9.5, and then 10 when rounding to integer using rounding half to even, but would give 9 when rounded to integer directly. Borman and Chatfield discuss the implications of double rounding when comparing data rounded to one decimal place to specification limits expressed using integers.

In &quot;Martinez v. Allstate&quot; and &quot;Sendejo v. Farmers&quot;, litigated between 1995 and 1997, the insurance companies argued that double rounding premiums was permissible and in fact required. The US courts ruled against the insurance companies and ordered them to adopt rules to ensure single rounding.

Some computer languages and the IEEE 754-2008 standard dictate that in straightforward calculations the result should not be rounded twice. This has been a particular problem with Java as it is designed to be run identically on different machines, special programming tricks have had to be used to achieve this with x87 floating point. The Java language was changed to allow different results where the difference does not matter and require a strictfp qualifier to be used when the results have to conform accurately; strict floating point has been restored in Java 17.

In some algorithms, an intermediate result is computed in a larger precision, then must be rounded to the final precision. Double rounding can be avoided by choosing an adequate rounding for the intermediate computation. This consists in avoiding to round to midpoints for the final rounding (except when the midpoint is exact). In binary arithmetic, the idea is to round the result toward zero, and set the least significant bit to 1 if the rounded result is inexact; this rounding is called &quot;sticky rounding&quot;. Equivalently, it consists in returning the intermediate result when it is exactly representable, and the nearest floating-point number with an odd significand otherwise; this is why it is also known as &quot;rounding to odd&quot;. A concrete implementation of this approach, for binary and decimal arithmetic, is implemented as Rounding to prepare for shorter precision.

===Table-maker&#x27;s dilemma===
William M. Kahan coined the term &quot;The Table-Maker&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; for the unknown cost of rounding transcendental functions:
The IEEE 754 floating-point standard guarantees that add, subtract, multiply, divide, fused multiply–add, square root, and floating-point remainder will give the correctly rounded result of the infinite-precision operation. No such guarantee was given in the 1985 standard for more complex functions and they are typically only accurate to within the last bit at best. However, the 2008 standard guarantees that conforming implementations will give correctly rounded results which respect the active rounding mode; implementation of the functions, however, is optional.

Using the Gelfond–Schneider theorem and Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem, many of the standard elementary functions can be proved to return transcendental results, except on some well-known arguments; therefore, from a theoretical point of view, it is always possible to correctly round such functions. However, for an implementation of such a function, determining a limit for a given precision on how accurate results need to be computed, before a correctly rounded result can be guaranteed, may demand a lot of computation time or may be out of reach. In practice, when this limit is not known (or only a very large bound is known), some decision has to be made in the implementation (see below); but according to a probabilistic model, correct rounding can be satisfied with a very high probability when using an intermediate accuracy of up to twice the number of digits of the target format plus some small constant (after taking special cases into account).

Some programming packages offer correct rounding. The GNU MPFR package gives correctly rounded arbitrary precision results. Some other libraries implement elementary functions with correct rounding in IEEE 754 double precision (binary64):
* IBM&#x27;s &quot;ml4j&quot;, which stands for &quot;Mathematical Library for Java&quot;, written by Abraham Ziv and Moshe Olshansky in 1999, correctly rounded to nearest only. This library was claimed to be portable, but only binaries for PowerPC/AIX, SPARC/Solaris and x86/Windows NT were provided. According to its documentation, this library uses a first step with an accuracy a bit larger than double precision, a second step based on double-double arithmetic, and a third step with a 768-bit precision based on arrays of IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point numbers.
* IBM&#x27;s &quot;Accurate portable mathematical library&quot; (abbreviated as APMathLib or just MathLib), also called libultim, in rounding to nearest only. This library uses up to 768 bits of working precision. It was included in the GNU C Library in 2001, but the &quot;slow paths&quot; (providing correct rounding) were removed from 2018 to 2021.
* CRlibm, written in the old Arénaire team (LIP, ENS Lyon), first distributed in 2003. It supports the 4 rounding modes and is proved, using the knowledge of the hardest-to-round cases. More efficient than IBM MathLib. Succeeded by Metalibm (2014), which automates the formal proofs.
* Sun Microsystems&#x27;s libmcr of 2004, in the 4 rounding modes. For the difficult cases, this library also uses multiple precision, and the number of words is increased by 2 each time the Table-maker&#x27;s dilemma occurs (with undefined behavior in the very unlikely event that some limit of the machine is reached).
* The CORE-MATH project (2022) provides some correctly rounded functions in the 4 rounding modes for x86-64 processors. Proved using the knowledge of the hardest-to-round cases.
* LLVM libc provides some correctly rounded functions in the 4 rounding modes.

There exist computable numbers for which a rounded value can never be determined no matter how many digits are calculated. Specific instances cannot be given but this follows from the undecidability of the halting problem. For instance, if Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture is true but unprovable, then the result of rounding the following value, , up to the next integer cannot be determined: either =1+10− where is the first even number greater than 4 which is not the sum of two primes, or =1 if there is no such number. The rounded result is 2 if such a number exists and 1 otherwise. The value before rounding can however be approximated to any given precision even if the conjecture is unprovable.

===Interaction with string searches===
Rounding can adversely affect a string search for a number. For example, rounded to four digits is &quot;3.1416&quot; but a simple search for this string will not discover &quot;3.14159&quot; or any other value of rounded to more than four digits. In contrast, truncation does not suffer from this problem; for example, a simple string search for &quot;3.1415&quot;, which is truncated to four digits, will discover values of truncated to more than four digits.

==History==
The concept of rounding is very old, perhaps older than the concept of division itself. Some ancient clay tablets found in Mesopotamia contain tables with rounded values of reciprocals and square roots in base 60.
Rounded approximations to , the length of the year, and the length of the month are also ancient – see base 60 examples.

The &quot;round-half-to-even&quot; method has served as American Standard Z25.1 and ASTM standard E-29 since 1940. The origin of the terms &quot;unbiased rounding&quot; and &quot;statistician&#x27;s rounding&quot; are fairly self-explanatory. In the 1906 fourth edition of &quot;Probability and Theory of Errors&quot; Robert Simpson Woodward called this &quot;the computer&#x27;s rule&quot;, indicating that it was then in common use by human computers who calculated mathematical tables. For example, it was recommended in Simon Newcomb&#x27;s c. 1882 book &quot;Logarithmic and Other Mathematical Tables&quot;. Lucius Tuttle&#x27;s 1916 &quot;Theory of Measurements&quot; called it a &quot;universally adopted rule&quot; for recording physical measurements. Churchill Eisenhart indicated the practice was already &quot;well established&quot; in data analysis by the 1940s.

The origin of the term &quot;bankers&#x27; rounding&quot; remains more obscure. If this rounding method was ever a standard in banking, the evidence has proved extremely difficult to find. To the contrary, section 2 of the European Commission report &quot;The Introduction of the Euro and the Rounding of Currency Amounts&quot; suggests that there had previously been no standard approach to rounding in banking; and it specifies that &quot;half-way&quot; amounts should be rounded up.

Until the 1980s, the rounding method used in floating-point computer arithmetic was usually fixed by the hardware, poorly documented, inconsistent, and different for each brand and model of computer. This situation changed after the IEEE 754 floating-point standard was adopted by most computer manufacturers. The standard allows the user to choose among several rounding modes, and in each case specifies precisely how the results should be rounded. These features made numerical computations more predictable and machine-independent, and made possible the efficient and consistent implementation of interval arithmetic.

Currently, much research tends to round to multiples of 5 or 2. For example, Jörg Baten used age heaping in many studies, to evaluate the numeracy level of ancient populations. He came up with the ABCC Index, which enables the comparison of the numeracy among regions possible without any historical sources where the population literacy was measured.

==Rounding functions in programming languages==
Most programming languages provide functions or special syntax to round fractional numbers in various ways. The earliest numeric languages, such as Fortran and C, would provide only one method, usually truncation (toward zero). This default method could be implied in certain contexts, such as when assigning a fractional number to an integer variable, or using a fractional number as an index of an array. Other kinds of rounding had to be programmed explicitly; for example, rounding a positive number to the nearest integer could be implemented by adding 0.5 and truncating.

In the last decades, however, the syntax and the standard libraries of most languages have commonly provided at least the four basic rounding functions (up, down, to nearest, and toward zero). The tie-breaking method can vary depending on the language and version or might be selectable by the programmer. Several languages follow the lead of the IEEE 754 floating-point standard, and define these functions as taking a double-precision float argument and returning the result of the same type, which then may be converted to an integer if necessary. This approach may avoid spurious overflows because floating-point types have a larger range than integer types. Some languages, such as PHP, provide functions that round a value to a specified number of decimal digits (e.g., from 4321.5678 to 4321.57 or 4300). In addition, many languages provide a printf or similar string formatting function, which allows one to convert a fractional number to a string, rounded to a user-specified number of decimal places (the &quot;precision&quot;). On the other hand, truncation (round to zero) is still the default rounding method used by many languages, especially for the division of two integer values.

In contrast, CSS and SVG do not define any specific maximum precision for numbers and measurements, which they treat and expose in their DOM and in their IDL interface as strings as if they had infinite precision, and do not discriminate between integers and floating-point values; however, the implementations of these languages will typically convert these numbers into IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point values before exposing the computed digits with a limited precision (notably within standard JavaScript or ECMAScript interface bindings).

==Other rounding standards==
Some disciplines or institutions have issued standards or directives for rounding.

===US weather observations===
In a guideline issued in mid-1966, the U.S. Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology determined that weather data should be rounded to the nearest round number, with the &quot;round half up&quot; tie-breaking rule. For example, 1.5 rounded to integer should become 2, and −1.5 should become −1. Prior to that date, the tie-breaking rule was &quot;round half away from zero&quot;.

===Negative zero in meteorology===
Some meteorologists may write &quot;−0&quot; to indicate a temperature between 0.0 and −0.5 degrees (exclusive) that was rounded to an integer. This notation is used when the negative sign is considered important, no matter how small is the magnitude; for example, when rounding temperatures in the Celsius scale, where below zero indicates freezing.

<text>A grain is a unit of measurement of mass, and in the troy weight, avoirdupois, and apothecaries&#x27; systems, equal to exactly . It is nominally based upon the mass of a single ideal seed of a cereal. From the Bronze Age into the Renaissance, the average masses of wheat and barley grains were part of the legal definitions of units of mass. Expressions such as &quot;thirty-two grains of wheat, taken from the middle of the ear&quot; appear to have been ritualistic formulas. Another source states that it was defined such that 252.458 units would balance of distilled water at an ambient air-water pressure and temperature of and respectively. Another book states that Captain Henry Kater, of the British Standards Commission, arrived at this value experimentally.

The grain was the legal foundation of traditional English weight systems, and is the only unit that is equal throughout the troy, avoirdupois, and apothecaries&#x27; systems of mass. The unit was based on the weight of a single grain of barley which was equal to about the weight of a single grain of wheat. The fundamental unit of the pre-1527 English weight system, known as Tower weights, was based on the wheat grain. The tower &quot;wheat&quot; grain was defined as exactly (≈) of the troy &quot;barley&quot; grain.

Since the implementation of the international yard and pound agreement of 1 July 1959, the grain or &quot;troy grain&quot; (symbol: &quot;gr&quot;) measure has been defined in terms of units of mass in the International System of Units as precisely . One gram is thus approximately equivalent to . The unit formerly used by jewellers to measure pearls, diamonds, and other precious stones, called the &quot;jeweller&#x27;s grain&quot; or &quot;pearl grain&quot;, is equal to . The grain was also the name of a traditional French unit equal to .

In both British Imperial units and United States customary units, there are precisely 7,000 grains per avoirdupois pound, and 5,760 grains per troy pound or apothecaries&#x27; pound. It is obsolete in the United Kingdom and, like most other non-SI units, it has no basis in law and cannot be used in commerce.

== Current usage ==
Grains are commonly used to measure the mass of bullets and propellants. In archery, the grain is the standard unit used to weigh arrows.

In North America, the hardness of water is often measured in grains per U.S. gallon () of calcium carbonate equivalents. Otherwise, water hardness is measured in the dimensionless unit of parts per million (), numerically equivalent to concentration measured in milligrams per litre. One grain per U.S. gallon is approximately . Soft water contains of calcium carbonate equivalents, while hard water contains .
Though no longer recommended, in the U.S., grains are still used occasionally in medicine as part of the apothecaries&#x27; system, especially in prescriptions for older medicines such as aspirin or phenobarbital. For example, the dosage of a standard tablet of aspirin is sometimes given as . In that example the grain is approximated to , though the grain can also be approximated to , depending on the medication and manufacturer. The apothecaries&#x27; system has its own system of notation, in which the units symbol or abbreviation is followed by the quantity in lower case Roman numerals. For amounts less than one, the quantity is written as a fraction, or for one half, ss (or variations such as ss., ṡṡ, or s̅s̅). Therefore, a prescription for tablets containing 325 mg of aspirin and 30 mg of codeine can be written &quot;ASA gr. v c̄ cod. gr. ss tablets&quot; (using the medical abbreviations ASA for acetylsalicylic acid [aspirin], c̄ for &quot;with&quot;, and cod. for codeine). The apothecaries&#x27; system has gradually been replaced by the metric system, and the use of the grain in prescriptions is now rare.

In the U.S., particulate emission levels, used to monitor and regulate pollution, are sometimes measured in grains per cubic foot instead of the more usual by volume. This is the same unit commonly used to measure the amount of moisture in the air, also known as the absolute humidity. The SI unit used to measure particulate emissions and absolute humidity is mg/m. One grain per cubic foot is approximately .

== History ==

At least since antiquity, grains of wheat or barley were used by Mediterranean traders to define units of mass; along with other seeds, especially those of the carob tree. According to a longstanding tradition, one carat (the mass of a carob seed) was equivalent to the weight of four wheat grains or three barleycorns. Since the weights of these seeds are highly variable, especially that of the cereals as a function of moisture, this is a convention more than an absolute law.

The history of the modern British grain can be traced back to a royal decree in thirteenth century England, re-iterating decrees that go back as far as King Offa (eighth century). The Tower pound was one of many monetary pounds of 240 silver pennies.

The pound in question is the Tower pound. The Tower pound, abolished in 1527, consisted of 12 ounces like the troy pound, but was (≈6%) lighter. The weight of the original sterling pennies was 22½ troy grains, or 32 &quot;Tower grains&quot;.

Physical grain weights were made and sold commercially at least as late as the early 1900s, and took various forms, from squares of sheet metal to manufactured wire shapes and coin-like weights.

The troy pound was only &quot;the pound of Pence, Spices, Confections, as of Electuaries&quot;, as such goods might be measured by a &quot;troi&quot; or small balance. The old troy standard was set by King Offa&#x27;s currency reform, and was in full use in 1284 (Assize of Weights and Measures, King Edward I), but was restricted to currency (the pound of pennies) until it was abolished in 1527. This pound was progressively replaced by a new pound, based on the weight of 120 silver dirhems of 48 grains. The new pound used a barley-corn grain, rather than a wheat grain.

Avoirdupois (goods of weight) refers to those things measured by the lesser but quicker balances: the bismar or auncel, the Roman balance, and the steelyard. The original mercantile pound of 25 shillings or 15 (Tower) ounces was displaced by, variously, the pound of the Hanseatic League (16 tower ounces) and by the pound of the then-important wool trade (16 ounces of 437 grains). A new pound of grains was inadvertently created as 16 troy ounces, referring to the new troy rather than the old troy. Eventually, the wool pound won out.

The avoirdupois pound was defined in prototype, rated as to grains. In the Imperial Weights and Measures Act 1824 (5 Geo. 4. c. 74), the avoirdupois pound was defined as grains exactly. The Weights and Measures Act 1855 authorised Miller&#x27;s new standards to replace those lost in the fire that destroyed the Houses of Parliament. The standard was an avoirdupois pound, the grain being defined as of it.

The division of the carat into four grains survives in both senses well into the early twentieth century. For pearls and diamonds, weight is quoted in carats, divided into four grains. The carat was eventually set to 205 milligrams (1877), and later 200 milligrams. For touch or fineness of gold, the fraction of gold was given as a weight, the total being a solidus of 24 carats or 96 grains.

<text>The Malayalam Calendar, or the Kollam Era (), is a sidereal solar calendar used in Kerala. The origin of the calendar has been dated to 825 CE, commemorating the establishment of Kollam.

There are many theories regarding the origin of the era, but according to recent scholarship, it commemorated the foundation of Kollam by Maruwan Sapir Iso, who was the leader of Persian Christian Settlers and trading guilds like Anjuvannam following the liberation of the Kingdom of Venad from the Chola rule by or with the assistance of the Chera emperor at Kodungallur. The Quilon Syrian copper plates were grants and privileges given to the trading guilds involved in the establishment of Kollam by Sthanu Ravi Varma.

Kollam was the capital of Venadu and an important port town of the Chera Kingdom in that period. Kollam Aandu was adapted in the entire Chera Kingdom (the contemporary states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Kerala), the majority of which is now in Kerala. In Malayalam-speaking Kerala, it is now called the Malayalam Era or &#x27;Kollavarsham’ (Kollam Thontri Aandu). The earliest available record mentioning the Kollam Era is a royal decree by Sri Vallavan Goda, the King of Venadu, dated to (Kollam Era 149). In the inscription, the phrase &quot;Kollam Thontri Aandu&quot; is employed. Another era, referred to as &quot;Kollam Aḻintha Aandu&quot;, counting from 1097 CE, was reckoned by the Cholas for some time. It is tentatively calculated that the Chola overlords captured the port of Kollam in 1097 CE.

== History ==
The origin of the Kollam Era has been dated to 825 CE, when the great convention in Kollam was held at the behest of King Kulashekharan. Kollam was an important town in that period, and the Malayalam Era is called &#x27;Kollavarsham&#x27;.

There are multiple conflicting accounts regarding the origins of the Malayalam calendar, some of which are mentioned below:

*According to legend, Kollam era is attributed to the legend of the hero Paraśurāma, an avatar (incarnation) of the god Vishnu. It is sometimes divided into cycles of 1,000 years reckoned from 1176 BCE. Thus, 825 CE would have been the first year of the era&#x27;s third millennium.
*The news of the physical disappearance of Sri Adi Shankaracharya in 820 CE at Kedarnath reached Kerala only a few years later. It is believed that Kerala began the Malayalam era, also called the Kollam era, in 825 CE in his memory. 
*According to Hermann Gundert, Kollavarsham started as part of erecting a new Shiva Temple in Kollam and because of the strictly local and religious background, the other regions did not follow this system at first. Once Kollam port emerged as an important trade center, however, the other countries also started to follow the new system of calendar. This theory backs the remarks of Ibn Battuta as well.
*It is also believed that the era started as part of erection of the Thirupalkadal Sreekrishnaswamy Temple, family temple of Venad located at Keezhperoor or Kil-perur. Keezhperoor is a place located near Kilimanoor, which is used as prefix along with name of Venad and Travancore monarchs and is believed to be the maternal home of Kulasekhara Alvar.

==Months==

== Days ==
The days of the week in the Malayalam calendar are suffixed with &quot;Aazhcha&quot; (), meaning week.

Like the months above, there are twenty seven stars starting from Aswati (Ashvinī in Sanskrit) and ending in Revatī. The 365 days of the year are divided into groups of fourteen days called &quot;Ñattuvela&quot; (), each one bearing the name of a star.

== Significant dates ==
*Vishu (1st &quot;Medam&quot;): Malayali New Year (traditional)
*Deepavali (&quot;Thulam&quot;): Festival of Lights
*Onam
*1st &quot;Chingam&quot;: Malayali New Year (as per the Kollam Era calendar)

Vishu (), celebrated on the first day of &quot;Medam&quot;, &quot;Onam&quot; (), celebrated on the star Thiruvonam on the first day of &quot;Chingam&quot;, and Deepavali (), celebrated on the first day of &quot;Thulam&quot;, are three of the major festivals. The first day of &quot;Chingam&quot; is celebrated as the Kerala New Year, replacing Vishu (), which was considered the beginning of a year until 825 CE. Vishu is still celebrated as the traditional Malayali New Year, as it is astronomically significant, &#x27;Medam&#x27; being the first among the 12 rashis (the zodiac signs corresponding to the 12 months of a solar year).. Deepavali is traditionally celebrated during Thulam which is the months of October and November.

The Makaravilakku festival is celebrated in the Ayyappa Temple at Sabarimala on the first day of &quot;Makaram&quot; month. This marks the grand finale of the two-month period to the Sabarimala pilgrimage. The 1st of &quot;Makaram&quot; marks the winter Solstice (Uttarayanam) and the 1st of &quot;Karkaṭakam&quot; marks the summer solstice (Dakshinayanam) according to the Malayalam calendar (according to the astronomical calendar, the summer solstice is on 21 June, and the winter solstice on 21 December).

Chaitram 1 (usually coinciding with 20 March) or Medam 1 (mostly coinciding with 14 April, for 2019 it was on 15 April), both in the proximity of the date of the vernal equinox (21 March), mark the beginning of the new year in many traditional Indian calendars such as the Indian national calendar and the Tamil calendar. When the Government of Kerala adopted Kolla Varsham as the regional calendar, the first of &quot;Chingam&quot;, the month of the festival of Onam, was accepted as the Malayalam New Year instead.

==Derived names==
Many events in Kerala are related to the dates in the Malayalam calendar.

The agricultural activities of Kerala are centred on the seasons. The southwest monsoon which starts around 1 June is known as &quot;Edavappathi&quot;, meaning mid of month &quot;Edavam&quot;. The northeast monsoon which starts during mid October is called &quot;thulavarsham&quot; (rain in the month of &quot;thulam&quot;). The two harvests of paddy are called &quot;Kannikkoythu&quot; and &quot;Makarakkoythu&quot; (harvests in the months &quot;kanni&quot; and &quot;makaram&quot;) respectively.

<doc id="169962" wikidata="Q220984" url="?curid=169962" title="Opium Wars">
<text>The Opium Wars () were two conflicts waged between China and Western powers during the mid-19th century.

The First Opium War was fought from 1839 to 1842 between China and Britain. It was triggered by the Chinese government&#x27;s campaign to enforce its prohibition of opium, which included destroying opium stocks owned by British merchants and the British East India Company. The British government responded by sending a naval expedition to force the Chinese government to pay reparations and allow the opium trade. The Second Opium War was waged by Britain and France against China from 1856 to 1860, and consequently resulted in China being forced to legalise opium.

In each war, the superior military advantages enjoyed by European forces led to several easy victories over the Chinese military, with the consequence that China was compelled to sign the unequal treaties to grant favourable tariffs, trade concessions, reparations and territory to Western powers. The two conflicts, along with the various treaties imposed during the century of humiliation, weakened the Chinese government&#x27;s authority and forced China to open specified treaty ports (including Shanghai) to Western merchants. In addition, China ceded sovereignty over Hong Kong to the British Empire, which maintained control over the region until 1997.

==History==

===First Opium War===
The First Opium War broke out in 1839 between China and Britain and was fought over trading rights (including the right of free trade) and Britain&#x27;s diplomatic status among Chinese officials. In the eighteenth century, China enjoyed a trade surplus with Europe, trading porcelain, silk, and tea in exchange for silver. By the late 18th century, the British East India Company (EIC) expanded the cultivation of opium in the Bengal Presidency, selling it to private merchants who transported it to China and covertly sold it on to Chinese smugglers. By 1797, the EIC was selling 4,000 chests of opium (each weighing 77 kg) to private merchants &quot;per annum&quot;.

In earlier centuries, opium was utilised as a medicine with anesthetic qualities, but new Chinese practices of smoking opium recreationally increased demand tremendously and often led to smokers developing addictions. Successive Chinese emperors issued edicts making opium illegal in 1729, 1799, 1814, and 1831, but imports grew as smugglers and colluding officials in China sought profit. Some American merchants entered the trade by smuggling opium from Turkey into China, including Warren Delano Jr. and Francis Blackwell Forbes; in American historiography this is sometimes referred to as the Old China Trade. By 1833, the Chinese opium trade soared to 30,000 chests. British and American merchants sent opium to warehouses in the free-trade port of Canton, and sold it to Chinese smugglers.

In 1834, the EIC&#x27;s monopoly on British trade with China ceased, and the opium trade burgeoned. Partly concerned with moral issues over the consumption of opium and partly with the outflow of silver, the Daoguang Emperor charged Governor General Lin Zexu with ending the trade. In 1839, Lin published in Canton an open letter to Queen Victoria requesting her cooperation in halting the opium trade. The letter never reached the Queen. It was later published in &quot;The Times&quot; as a direct appeal to the British public for their cooperation. An edict from the Daoguang Emperor followed on 18March, emphasising the serious penalties for opium smuggling that would now apply henceforth. Lin ordered the seizure of all opium in Canton, including that held by foreign governments and trading companies (called factories), and the companies prepared to hand over a token amount to placate him. Charles Elliot, Chief Superintendent of British Trade in China, arrived 3 days after the expiry of Lin&#x27;s deadline, as Chinese troops enforced a shutdown and blockade of the factories. The standoff ended after Elliot paid for all the opium on credit from the British government (despite lacking official authority to make the purchase) and handed the 20,000 chests (1,300 metric tons) over to Lin, who had them destroyed at Humen.

Elliott then wrote to London advising the use of military force to resolve the dispute with the Chinese government. A small skirmish occurred between British and Chinese warships in the Kowloon Estuary on 4 September 1839. After almost a year, the British government decided, in May 1840, to send a military expedition to impose reparations for the financial losses experienced by opium traders in Canton and to guarantee future security for the trade. On 21 June 1840, a British naval force arrived off Macao and moved to bombard the port of Dinghai. In the ensuing conflict, the Royal Navy used its superior ships and guns to inflict a series of decisive defeats on Chinese forces.

The war was concluded by the Treaty of Nanking (Nanjing) in 1842, the first of the Unequal treaties between China and Western powers. The treaty ceded the Hong Kong Island and surrounding smaller islands to Britain, and established five cities as treaty ports open to Western traders: Shanghai, Canton, Ningbo, Fuzhou, and Xiamen (Amoy). The treaty also stipulated that China would pay a twenty-one million dollar payment to Britain as reparations for the destroyed opium, with six million to be paid immediately, and the rest through specified installments thereafter. Another treaty the following year gave most favoured nation status to Britain and added provisions for British extraterritoriality, making Britain exempt from Chinese law. France secured several of the same concessions from China in the Treaty of Whampoa in 1844.

===Second Opium War===

In 1853, northern China was convulsed by the Taiping Rebellion, which established its capital at Nanjing. In spite of this, a new Imperial Commissioner, Ye Mingchen, was appointed at Canton, determined to stamp out the opium trade, which was still technically illegal. In October 1856, he seized the &quot;Arrow&quot;, a ship claiming British registration, and threw its crew into chains. Sir John Bowring, Governor of British Hong Kong, called up Rear Admiral Sir Michael Seymour&#x27;s East Indies and China Station fleet, which, on 23 October, bombarded and captured the Pearl River forts on the approach to Canton and proceeded to bombard Canton itself, but had insufficient forces to take and hold the city. On 15 December, during a riot in Canton, European commercial properties were set on fire and Bowring appealed for military intervention. The execution of a French missionary inspired support from France. The United States and Russia also intervened in the war.

Britain and France now sought greater concessions from China, including the legalization of the opium trade, expanding of the transportation of &quot;coolies&quot; to European colonies, opening all of China to British and French citizens and exempting foreign imports from internal transit duties. The war resulted in the 1858 Treaty of Tientsin (Tianjin), in which the Chinese government agreed to pay war reparations for the expenses of the recent conflict, open a second group of ten ports to European commerce, legalize the opium trade, and grant foreign traders and missionaries rights to travel within China. 

China was also required to use diplomacy in the Western, egalitarian style instead of their normal way of conducting business with lesser states through a tribute system. This treaty led to the era in Chinese history known as the &quot;Century of Humiliation&quot;. This term refers to China&#x27;s loss of control of many territories to its enemies after being forced into treaties which they considered unfair. Even though the treaties were signed in 1858, there was still Chinese resistance to its principles including the residence of foreign ambassadors in Beijing. The British continued to attack the Chinese. After a second phase of fighting which included the sack of the Old Summer Palace and the occupation of the Forbidden City palace complex in Beijing, the treaty was confirmed by the Convention of Peking in 1860.

=== Cultural relics ===

In February 1860, the British and French imperialist authorities again appointed Elgin and Grotto as plenipotentiaries respectively, leading more than 15,000 British troops and about 7,000 French troops to expand the war against China. The British and French forces invaded Beijing, and the Qing emperor fled to Chengde. The British and French forces broke into the Old Summer Palace, looted jewelry, and burned it. Among the cultural relics that were looted were the well-known Old Summer Palace bronze heads.

On the morning of 7 October, the French army broke into the Old Summer Palace and began to rob it. British soldiers who arrived in the afternoon also joined the robbery, and the most precious things in the Old Summer Palace were looted. All twelve bronze statues of animal heads began to be lost overseas. On 18 October, the Old Summer Palace was burned down by British soldiers, and France refused to provide aid. The fire burned for three days and nights, razing the buildings of the Old Summer Palace to the ground and destroying nearby royal properties.

As of December 2020, seven of the twelve bronze statues have been found and returned to China. The whereabouts of the remaining five are still unknown.

<text>Friedrich Heinrich Karl &quot;Fritz&quot; Haarmann (25 October 1879 – 15 April 1925) was a German serial rapist and serial killer, known as the Butcher of Hanover, the Vampire of Hanover and the Wolf Man, who committed the sexual assault, murder, mutilation and dismemberment of at least twenty-four young men and boys in the city of Hanover between 1918 and 1924.

Found guilty of twenty-four of the twenty-seven murders for which he was tried, Haarmann was sentenced to death by beheading in December 1924. He was subsequently executed by guillotine in April 1925.

Haarmann became known as the &quot;Butcher of Hanover&quot; () due to the extensive mutilation and dismemberment committed upon his victims&#x27; bodies, and by such titles as the &quot;Vampire of Hanover&quot; (&quot;der Vampir von Hannover&quot;) and the &quot;Wolf Man&quot; (&quot;Wolfsmensch&quot;) because of his preferred murder method of biting into or through his victims&#x27; throats.

==Early life==
===Childhood===
Fritz Haarmann was born in Hanover on 25 October 1879, the sixth and youngest child born to Johanna (&quot;née&quot; Claudius) and Ollie Haarmann.

Haarmann was a quiet child, with few friends his own age or gender and who seldom socialized with any children outside of school with the exception of his siblings. From an early age, Haarmann&#x27;s behaviour was noticeably effeminate, and he was known to shun boys&#x27; activities, instead playing with his sisters&#x27; dolls and dressing in their clothes. He also developed a passion for both needlework and cookery, and would develop a close relationship with his mother, who spoiled her youngest child.

Reportedly, Haarmann&#x27;s father married his mother when she was 41 years old and seven years his senior, largely due to her wealth and the substantial dowry their marriage would eventually bring him. Haarmann Sr. was known to be argumentative and short-tempered and conducted several affairs throughout his marriage. Via his infidelity, he contracted syphilis in his later years. Despite his father being an authoritarian who had little time for his children and a notorious womanizer, Haarmann&#x27;s parents remained together until his mother&#x27;s death in April 1901.

In 1886, Haarmann began his schooling; he was noted by teachers to be a spoiled and mollycoddled child who was prone to daydreaming. Although his behaviour at school was noted to be exemplary, his academic performance was below average and Haarmann had to repeat a school year twice. On one occasion, when he was about eight years old, Haarmann was molested by one of his teachers, although he never discussed this incident in detail.

Haarmann grew into a trim, physically strong youth. With his parents&#x27; consent, he finished his schooling in 1894. Upon leaving school, he briefly obtained employment as an apprentice locksmith in Neuf-Brisach (now part of France) before opting at age 15 to enrol in a military academy in the town of Breisach. His military training began on 4 April 1895.

===Adolescence and first offences===
Haarmann initially adapted to military life and performed well as a trainee soldier. However, after five months of military service, he began to suffer periodic lapses of consciousness which, although initially described by a medical professional as being sudden signs of anxiety neurosis, were subsequently diagnosed as being &quot;equivalent to epilepsy&quot; in October 1895. The following month, Haarmann discharged himself from the military and returned to Hanover, where he briefly worked in a cigar factory his father had established in 1888.

At age 16, Haarmann committed his first known sexual offences, all of which involved young boys whom he would lure to secluded areas—typically cellars—before proceeding to sexually abuse them. He was first arrested for committing offences of this nature in July 1896. Following further offences, the Division for Criminal Matters opted to place Haarmann in a mental institution in the city of Hildesheim in February 1897. Although briefly transferred to a Hanover hospital for psychiatric evaluation, he would be certified as being &quot;incurably deranged&quot; and unfit to stand trial by a psychologist named Gurt Schmalfuß. Schmalfuß ordered Haarmann to be confined at the mental institution indefinitely. He was returned to the institution on 28 May 1897.

Seven months later, in January 1898, Haarmann escaped the mental institution and, with apparent assistance from his mother, he fled to Zürich in Switzerland. Here, he lived with a relative of his mother and obtained employment as a handyman in a shipyard. Haarmann remained in Zürich for sixteen months before he returned to Hanover in April 1899. Early the following year, he seduced and subsequently became engaged to a woman named Erna Loewert, who soon became pregnant with his child. In October 1900, Haarmann received notification to perform his compulsory military service.

==Military service==
On 12 October 1900, Haarmann was deployed to the Alsatian city of Colmar to serve in the Number 10 Rifle Battalion. Throughout his service, he earned a reputation among his superiors as an exemplary soldier and excellent marksman, and he would later describe this period of service as being the happiest of his entire life. After collapsing while on exercise with his battalion in October 1901, Haarmann began to suffer dizzy spells and was subsequently hospitalized for over four months. He was later deemed &quot;unsuitable for [military] service and work&quot; and was discharged on 28 July 1902.

Discharged from the military under medical terms described as being &quot;probable&quot; dementia praecox, Haarmann was awarded a monthly pension of twenty-one gold marks. He returned to live with Erna in Hanover, briefly working again in his father&#x27;s cigar factory. However, he soon filed a maintenance lawsuit against his father, citing that he was unable to work due to the ailments noted by the military. Haarmann&#x27;s father successfully contested the suit and the charges were dropped. The following year, a violent fight between father and son resulted in Haarmann&#x27;s father himself unsuccessfully initiating legal proceedings against his son, citing verbal death threats and blackmail as justification to have his son returned to a mental institution. These charges were dropped due to a lack of corroborating evidence. Nonetheless, Haarmann was ordered to undertake a psychiatric examination in May 1903. This examination was conducted by a Dr. Andrae, who concluded that, although morally inferior, Haarmann was not mentally unstable.

With financial assistance from his father, Haarmann and his fiancée opened a fishmongery. Haarmann himself briefly attempted to work as an insurance salesman before being officially classified as disabled and unable to work by the 10th Army in 1904. As a result, his monthly pension was slightly increased. The same year, his fiancée, while pregnant with his child, terminated their engagement after he accused her of having an affair with a student. As the fishmongery was registered in her name, Erna simply ordered her fiancé to leave the premises.

==Criminal career==
For the next decade, Haarmann primarily lived as a petty thief, burglar and con artist. Although he did occasionally obtain legitimate employment, he invariably stole from his employers or their customers. Beginning in 1905, he served several short prison sentences for offences such as larceny, embezzlement, and assault. On one occasion when working legitimately as an invoice clerk, Haarmann became acquainted with a female employee with whom he later claimed to have robbed several tombstones and graves between 1905 and 1913 (he was never charged with these offences). Consequently, Haarmann spent the majority of the years between 1905 and 1912 in jail.

In late 1913, Haarmann was arrested for burglary. A search of his home revealed a hoard of stolen property linking him to several other burglaries. Despite protesting his innocence, Haarmann was charged with and convicted of a series of burglaries and frauds. He was sentenced to five years&#x27; imprisonment for these offences.

Due to compulsory conscription resulting from the outbreak of World War I, Germany saw a shortage of available domestic manpower. In the final years of his prison sentence, Haarmann was permitted to work throughout the day in the grounds of various manor houses near the town of Rendsburg, with instructions to return to prison each evening. Upon his release from prison in April 1918, he initially moved to Berlin before opting to return to Hanover, where he briefly lived with one of his sisters before renting a single-room apartment in late August 1918.
According to Haarmann, he was struck by the poverty of the German nation as a result of the loss the nation had suffered in World War I. Through his initial efforts to both trade and purchase stolen property at Hanover Central Station, Haarmann established several criminal contacts with whom he could trade in contraband property, and he immediately reverted to the criminal life he had lived before his 1913 arrest.

===Police informant===
Despite police knowledge that Haarmann was both a known criminal and a known homosexual, he gradually began to establish a relationship with law enforcement as an informer, largely as a means of redirecting the attention of the police from himself and his own criminal activities, and to facilitate his access to young males. By 1919, Haarmann is known to have regularly patrolled Hanover station, and to have provided police with information relating to the city&#x27;s extensive criminal network. With the cooperation of several police officials, Haarmann devised a ruse whereby he would offer to fence or store stolen property at his premises, then pass this information to police, who would then raid his property at agreed times and arrest these contacts. To remove any suspicion as to his treachery reaching the criminal fraternity, Haarmann himself would be arrested in these raids. Moreover, on numerous occasions, he is known to have performed citizen&#x27;s arrests upon commuters for offences such as travelling on forged documents. As a result of these activities, police began to rely on Haarmann as a reliable source of information regarding various criminal activities in Hanover, and he was allowed to patrol the station largely at will.

==Known and alleged murders==
Between 1918 and 1924, Haarmann committed at least twenty-four murders, although he is suspected of murdering a minimum of twenty-seven. All of his victims were males between the ages of 10 and 22, the majority of whom were in their mid- to late-teens. The victims were lured back to one of three addresses in which Haarmann is known to have resided throughout those years. He is known to have killed upon the promise of assistance, accommodation, work, or under the pretence of arrest. At Haarmann&#x27;s apartment, the victim was typically given food and drink before Haarmann bit into his Adam&#x27;s apple, often as he was strangled. Often this caused the victim to die of asphyxiation, but on several occasions Haarmann bit completely through his victims&#x27; Adams apple and trachea. (Haarmann referred to the act of biting through his victims&#x27; neck as his &quot;love bite&quot;.)
All of Haarmann&#x27;s known victims were dismembered before their bodies were discarded, usually in the Leine River, although the dismembered body of his first known victim had simply been buried, and the body of his last victim had been thrown into a lake located at the entrance to the Herrenhausen Gardens.

Haarmann typically kept his victims&#x27; personal possessions for himself or for his lover, Hans Grans. Alternatively, they would be sold on the black market through criminal contacts he and Grans had established at Hanover Central Station. However, the personal possessions of some victims were sold to legitimate retailers. In several instances, both Haarmann and Grans gave possessions belonging to various victims to acquaintances as gifts.

Following Haarmann&#x27;s arrest, rumours circulated that Haarmann ate the flesh of his victims, or sold it on the black market as pork or horse meat. Although no evidence was ever produced to confirm these theories, Haarmann was known to be an active trader in contraband meat, which was invariably boneless, diced, and often sold as ground meat. When asked where he obtained the meat, Haarmann sometimes said he had obtained the produce from a butcher named &quot;Karl&quot;, although investigators would later note that the stories Haarmann told his acquaintances regarding the origins of this individual varied.

===First known victim===
Haarmann&#x27;s first known victim was a 17-year-old runaway named Friedel Rothe. When Rothe disappeared on 25 September 1918, his friends told police he was last seen with Haarmann, who at the time resided in a single-room apartment at 27 Cellerstraße. Under pressure from Rothe&#x27;s family, police raided Haarmann&#x27;s apartment in October 1918, where they found him in the company of a semi-naked 13-year-old boy. He was charged with both the sexual assault and battery of a minor, and sentenced to nine months&#x27; imprisonment. (Haarmann later said to detectives that when they searched his apartment, the head of Friedel Rothe was stowed behind his stove wrapped in newspaper.)

Haarmann avoided serving his sentence throughout 1919. That October, he met an 18-year-old youth named Hans Grans, who had run away from his home in Berlin following an argument with his father on 1 October. Grans had slept rough in and around Hanover station for approximately two weeks—selling old clothes in and around the station to earn enough money to simply eat—before he encountered Haarmann.

===Relationship with Hans Grans===
In his subsequent confessions to police, Grans stated that, although his sexual orientation was heterosexual, he himself initiated contact with Haarmann, with the intention of prostituting himself, having heard of Haarmann&#x27;s homosexuality through acquaintances he had established in Hanover. Haarmann himself stated following his arrest that he viewed Grans as being &quot;like a son&quot; to him, adding that he &quot;pulled him [Grans] out of the ditch and tried to make sure he didn&#x27;t go to the dogs.&quot;

Shortly after their initial acquaintance, Haarmann invited the youth to move into his apartment, and Grans became Haarmann&#x27;s lover and criminal accomplice. According to Haarmann, although he was smitten with Grans, he gradually became aware the youth manipulated and, occasionally, mocked him. A few times Grans was evicted after heated arguments only for Haarmann to plead with him to come back. Despite the manipulation Haarmann endured at the hands of his accomplice, he later claimed to tolerate the capitulation as he craved Grans&#x27; companionship and affection, adding: &quot;I had to have someone I meant everything to.&quot;

Haarmann served the nine-month prison sentence imposed in 1918 for sexual assault and battery between March and December 1920. Upon his release, he again regained the trust of the police and again became an informer. Haarmann initially resided in a hotel, before he and Grans lodged with a middle-class family.

Through criminal contacts, Haarmann became aware of a vacant ground-floor apartment located at 8 Neue Straße. The apartment was located in a densely populated, old house located alongside the Leine River. Haarmann secured a letting agreement with the landlady, ostensibly to use the property for storage purposes. He and Grans moved into 8 Neue Straße on 1 July 1921.

Haarmann&#x27;s subsequent victims largely consisted of young male commuters, runaways and, occasionally, male prostitutes, whom he would typically encounter in or around Hanover&#x27;s central railway station. The second murder Haarmann is known to have committed occurred on 12 February 1923. The victim was a 17-year-old pianist named Fritz Franke, whom Haarmann encountered at Hanover Central Station and invited to his Neue Straße residence, where he introduced the youth to Hans Grans and two female acquaintances (one of whom was Grans&#x27; female lover). According to Grans&#x27; lover, that evening, Grans whispered in her ear: &quot;Hey! He&#x27;s going to be trampled on today.&quot; The following day, both these acquaintances returned to Haarmann&#x27;s apartment, where they were informed by Haarmann that Franke had travelled to Hamburg. Speculation remains as to Grans&#x27; knowledge of Haarmann&#x27;s intentions towards Franke when he made this comment to the two female acquaintances. According to Haarmann, following this murder, Grans arrived unannounced at his apartment, where he observed Franke&#x27;s nude body lying upon Haarmann&#x27;s bed. Grans had then simply looked at him and asked, &quot;When shall I come back again?&quot;

Five weeks after the murder of Franke, on 20 March, Haarmann encountered a 17-year-old commuter named Wilhelm Schulze at Hanover station. Schulze had been travelling to work when he encountered Haarmann. No human remains identified as belonging to Schulze were ever found, although most of his clothing was in the possession of Haarmann&#x27;s landlady, Elisabeth Engel, at the time of his arrest. Two more victims are known to have been murdered at 8 Neue Straße before Haarmann vacated the apartment in June: 16-year-old Roland Huch, who disappeared on 23 May after informing a close friend he intended to run away from home and join the Marines; and 19-year-old Hans Sonnenfeld, who disappeared on or about 31 May and whose distinctive yellow overcoat Haarmann is known to have worn after the youth&#x27;s murder.
On 9 June 1923, Haarmann moved into a single-room attic apartment at 2 Rote Reihe. Two weeks after moving into this address, on 25 June, Ernst Ehrenberg, the 13-year-old son of Haarmann&#x27;s neighbour, disappeared while running an errand for his father. His school cap and braces would be found in Haarmann&#x27;s apartment following his arrest. Two months later, on 24 August, an 18-year-old office clerk named Heinrich Struß was reported missing by his aunt (with whom he lived). Many of Struß&#x27;s belongings would also be found in Haarmann&#x27;s apartment. Struß&#x27;s murder would be followed one month later by the murder of a 17-year-old named Paul Bronischewski, who disappeared en route to the city of Bochum, having worked with his uncle in Saxony-Anhalt throughout the summer. Subsequent police enquiries suggested Bronischewski had likely alighted the train at Hanover, where he evidently encountered Haarmann. Bronischewski&#x27;s jacket, knapsack, trousers, and towel would all be found in the possession of Haarmann following his arrest.

Haarmann is next known to have killed on or about 30 September 1923. The victim was 17-year-old Richard Gräf, who last informed his family he had met an individual at Hanover station who &quot;knows of a good job for me.&quot; Two weeks later, on 12 October, a 16-year-old Gehrden youth named Wilhelm Erdner failed to return home from work. Subsequent enquiries by Erdner&#x27;s parents revealed the youth became acquainted with a Detective Fritz Honnerbrock (a pseudonym used by Haarmann) shortly before his disappearance. Both Haarmann and Grans subsequently sold Erdner&#x27;s bicycle on 20 October. Within a week of having sold this bicycle, Haarmann killed two further victims: 15-year-old Hermann Wolf, who disappeared from Hanover station on 24 October, and 13-year-old Heinz Brinkmann, who was seen by a witness standing in the entrance to Hanover station at 11:00 p.m. on 27 October, having missed his train home to the town of Clausthal.
On 10 November 1923, a 17-year-old apprentice carpenter from the city of Düsseldorf named Adolf Hannappel disappeared from Hanover station. He was seen by several witnesses sitting upon a trunk in the waiting room. These witnesses also positively identified Hans Grans—in the company of Haarmann—pointing towards the youth, who shortly thereafter was observed walking towards a café in the company of these two men. One month later, on 6 December 19-year-old Adolf Hennies disappeared. He had been seeking employment at the time of his disappearance. None of the human remains recovered were identified as belonging to Hennies, whom Haarmann specifically admitted to dismembering, but denied killing. In subsequent court testimony vehemently disputed by Grans, Haarmann claimed he returned home to find Hennies&#x27;s body—missing his signature &quot;love bite&quot;—lying naked on his bed, with Grans and another criminal acquaintance named Hugo Wittkowski stating the youth was, &quot;One of yours.&quot; (Neither Haarmann nor Grans were convicted of Hennies&#x27;s murder due to conflicting testimony.)

===1924===
The first victim killed by Haarmann in 1924 was 17-year-old Ernst Spiecker, who disappeared on 5 January. Although subsequent trial testimony from a friend of Spiecker indicated Haarmann had become acquainted with this youth before his murder, Haarmann stated he would simply have to &quot;assume&quot; this youth was one of his victims due to all his personal possessions being found in his or Grans&#x27; possession following his arrest. Ten days later, Haarmann killed a 20-year-old named Heinrich Koch, whom he is also believed to have been acquainted with prior to the youth&#x27;s murder. The following month, Haarmann is known to have killed two further victims: 19-year-old Willi Senger, who disappeared from the suburb of Linden-Limmer on 2 February, having informed his sister he was to travel with a friend; and 16-year-old Hermann Speichert, who was last seen by his sister on 8 February.

Haarmann is not known to have killed again until on or about 1 April, when he is believed to have killed an acquaintance named Hermann Bock. Although cleared of this murder at his trial, Haarmann was in possession of Bock&#x27;s clothing when arrested, and he is known to have given the youth&#x27;s suitcase to his landlady; moreover, Haarmann is known to have actively dissuaded several of Bock&#x27;s acquaintances from reporting the youth missing. One week later, on 8 April 16-year-old Alfred Hogrefe disappeared from Hanover station, having run away from home in the town of Lehrte on 2 April. Hogrefe&#x27;s murder would be followed 9 days later by that of a 16-year-old apprentice named Wilhelm Apel, whom Haarmann encountered on his &quot;patrols&quot; of Hanover-Leinhausen station.

On 26 April 18-year-old Robert Witzel disappeared after borrowing 50 pfennigs from his mother, explaining he intended to visit a travelling circus. Enquiries by the youth&#x27;s parents revealed their son had accompanied an &quot;official from the railway station&quot; to the circus. Haarmann himself would later state he killed Witzel the same evening and, having dismembered the youth&#x27;s body, had thrown the remains into the Leine River.

Two weeks after the murder of Witzel, Haarmann killed a 14-year-old named Heinz Martin, who was last seen by his mother on 9 May and who is believed to have been abducted from Hanover station. All his clothing was later found in Haarmann&#x27;s apartment. Less than three weeks later, on 26 May, a 17-year-old travelling salesman from the town of Kassel named Fritz Wittig, whom Haarmann would later state he killed upon the insistence of Grans as he had worn a &quot;good new suit&quot; Grans coveted, was dismembered and discarded in the Leine River. The same day Wittig is believed to have been killed, Haarmann killed his youngest known victim, 10-year-old Friedrich Abeling, who disappeared while truant from school. His murder would be followed less than two weeks later by that of 16-year-old Friedrich Koch, who was approached by Haarmann on 5 June as he walked to college. Two acquaintances of Koch would later testify at Haarmann&#x27;s trial that, as they walked with Koch to college, Haarmann approached Koch, tapped the youth on the boot with his walking stick and stated: &quot;Well, boy, don&#x27;t you recognize me?&quot;

Haarmann killed his final victim, 17-year-old Erich de Vries, on 14 June 1924. De Vries encountered Haarmann at Hanover station. His dismembered body would later be found in a lake located near the entrance to the Herrenhausen Gardens. Haarmann would confess it had taken him four separate trips to carry de Vries&#x27;s dismembered remains—carried in the leather bag which had belonged to Friedrich Koch—to the location where he had disposed of them.

==Discoveries==
On 17 May 1924, two children playing near the Leine River discovered a human skull. Determined to be that of a young male aged between 18 and 20 and bearing evidence of knife wounds, police were sceptical as to whether a murder had been committed or whether the skull had either been discarded in this location by grave robbers, or placed there in a tasteless prank by medical students. Furthermore, police theorized the skull may have been discarded in the river at Alfeld, which had recently experienced an outbreak of typhoid. Two weeks later, on 29 May, a second skull was found behind a mill race located close to the scene of the earlier discovery. This skull was also identified as having been that of a young male aged between 18 and 20. Shortly thereafter, two boys playing in a field close to the village of Döhren discovered a sack containing numerous human bones.

Two more skulls would be found on 13 June: one upon the banks of the Leine River; and another located close to a mill in west Hanover. Each of the skulls had been removed from the vertebrae with a sharp instrument. One skull belonged to a male in his late teens, whereas the other belonged to a boy estimated to have been aged between 11 and 13 years old. In addition, one of these skulls also bore evidence of having been scalped.

For more than a year prior to these discoveries, rumours had circulated in Hanover about the fate of the sheer number of children and teenagers who had been reported missing in the city. The discoveries sparked fresh rumours regarding missing and murdered children. In addition, various newspapers responded to these discoveries and the resulting rumours by harking to the disproportionate number of young people who had been reported missing in Hanover between 1918 and 1924.

On 8 June, several hundred Hanover residents converged close to the Leine River and searched both the banks of the river and the surrounding areas, discovering a number of human bones, which were handed to the police. In response to these latest discoveries, police decided to drag the entire section of the river which ran through the centre of the city. In doing so, they discovered more than 500 further human bones and sections of bodies, many bearing knife striations, which were later confirmed by a court doctor as having belonged to at least 22 separate human individuals. Approximately half of the remains had been in the river for some time, whereas other bones and body parts had been discarded in the river more recently. Many of the recent and aged discoveries bore evidence of having been dissected—particularly at the joints. Over 30 per cent of the remains were judged to have belonged to young males aged between 15 and 20.

Suspicion for the discoveries quickly fell upon Haarmann, who was known to both the police and the criminal investigation department as a homosexual who had amassed fifteen previous convictions dating from 1896 for various offences including child molestation and the sexual assault and battery of a minor. Moreover, he had been connected to the 1918 disappearances of Friedel Rothe and a 14-year-old named Hermann Koch (who had disappeared weeks prior to Rothe). Haarmann was placed under surveillance. Being a trusted police informant, Haarmann was known to frequent Hanover Central Station. As he was well known to many officers from Hanover, two young policemen were drafted from Berlin to pose as undercover officers and discreetly observe his movements. The surveillance of Haarmann began on 18 June 1924.

==Arrest==
On the night of 22 June, Haarmann was observed by the two undercover officers prowling Hanover&#x27;s central station. He was soon observed arguing with a 15-year-old boy named Karl Fromm, then approaching police and insisting they arrest the youth on the charge of travelling upon forged documents. Upon his arrest, Fromm informed police he had been living with Haarmann for four days, and that he had been repeatedly raped by his accuser, sometimes as a knife was held to his throat. Haarmann was arrested the following morning and charged with sexual assault.
Following his arrest, Haarmann&#x27;s attic apartment at No. 2 Rote Reihe was searched. Haarmann had lived in this single-room apartment since June 1923. The flooring, walls and bedding within the apartment were found to be extensively bloodstained. Haarmann initially attempted to explain this fact as a by-product of his illegal trading in contraband meat. Various acquaintances and former neighbours of Haarmann were also extensively questioned as to his activities. Many fellow tenants and neighbours of the various addresses in which Haarmann lived since 1920 commented to detectives about the number of teenage boys they observed visiting his various addresses. Moreover, some had seen him leaving his property with concealed sacks, bags, or baskets—invariably in the late evening or early morning hours. Two former tenants informed police that, in the spring of 1924, they had discreetly followed Haarmann from his apartment and observed him discarding a heavy sack into the Leine River.

The clothes and personal possessions found at Haarmann&#x27;s apartment and in the possession of his acquaintances were suspected as being the property of missing youths: all were confiscated and put on display at Hanover Police Station, with the parents of missing teenage boys from across Germany invited to look at the items. As the days passed, an increasing number of items were identified by family members as having belonged to their sons and brothers. Haarmann initially attempted to dismiss these revelations as being circumstantial in nature. He claimed that the majority of the clothes had been acquired through his business (trading used clothing), and that the remaining items had been left behind by youths with whom he&#x27;d engaged in consensual sexual activity.

The turning point came on 29 June when clothes, boots, and keys found stowed at Haarmann&#x27;s apartment were identified as belonging to a missing 18-year-old named Robert Witzel. A skull that had been found in a garden on 20 May (which was not initially connected with other skeletal discoveries determined to be linked to Haarmann) was identified as that of the missing youth. A friend of Witzel&#x27;s then identified the police officer whom Witzel had been seen with on the day of his disappearance as Haarmann.

Confronted with this evidence, Haarmann briefly attempted to bluster his way out of these latest and most damning pieces of evidence. When Witzel&#x27;s jacket was found in the possession of his landlady and he was confronted with various witnesses&#x27; testimony as to his destroying identification marks on the clothing, he broke down and had to be supported by his sister.

===Confession===
Faced with this latest evidence, and upon the urging of his sister, Haarmann confessed to raping, killing, and dismembering many young men in what he initially described as a &quot;rabid sexual passion&quot; between 1918 and 1924. According to Haarmann, he never actually intended to murder any of his victims, but would be seized by an irresistible urge to bite into or through their Adam&#x27;s apple—often as he manually strangled them—in the throes of ecstasy, before typically collapsing atop the victim&#x27;s body. Only one intended victim had escaped from Haarmann&#x27;s apartment after he attempted to bite into his Adam&#x27;s apple, although this individual is not known to have reported the attack to police.

All of Haarmann&#x27;s victims&#x27; bodies were disposed of via dismemberment shortly after their murder, and Haarmann was insistent that he found the act of dismemberment extremely unpleasant; he had, he stated, been ill for eight days after his first murder. Nonetheless, Haarmann was insistent that his passion at the moment of murder was invariably &quot;stronger than the horror of the cutting and the chopping&quot; which would inevitably follow, and would typically take up to two days to complete.

To fortify himself to dismember his victims&#x27; bodies, Haarmann would pour himself a cup of strong black coffee, then place the body of his victim upon the floor of this apartment and cover the face with cloth, before first removing the intestines, which he would place inside a bucket. A towel would then be repeatedly placed inside the abdominal cavity to soak the collecting blood. He would then make three cuts between the victim&#x27;s ribs and shoulders, then &quot;take hold of the ribs and push until the bones around the shoulders broke.&quot; The victim&#x27;s heart, lungs and kidneys would then be removed, diced, and placed in the same bucket which held the intestines before the legs and arms would be severed from the body. Haarmann would then begin paring the flesh from the limbs and torso. This surplus flesh would be disposed of in the toilet or, usually, in the nearby river.

The final section of the victims&#x27; bodies to be dismembered was invariably the head. After severing the head from the torso, Haarmann would use a small kitchen knife to strip all flesh from the skull, which he would then wrap in rags and place face downwards upon a pile of straw and bludgeon with an axe until the skull splintered, enabling him to access the brain. This he would also place in a bucket, which he would pour, alongside the &quot;chopped up bones&quot; in the Leine.

Haarmann was insistent that none of the skulls found in the Leine belonged to his victims, and that the forensic identification of the skull of Robert Witzel was mistaken, as he had almost invariably smashed his victims&#x27; skulls to pieces. The exceptions being those of his earliest victims—killed several years prior to his arrest—and that of his last victim, Erich de Vries. Although insistent that none of his murders were premeditated, investigators discovered much circumstantial evidence suggesting that several murders had been planned hours or days in advance, and that Haarmann had both concocted explanations for his victims&#x27; disappearances and dissuaded acquaintances of his victims from filing missing persons&#x27; reports with Hanover police. Investigators also noted that Haarmann would only confess to murders for which there existed evidence against him; on one occasion, Haarmann stated: &quot;There are some [victims] you don&#x27;t know about, but it&#x27;s not those you think.&quot;

When asked how many victims he killed, Haarmann claimed, &quot;Somewhere between 50 and 70.&quot; The police, however, could only connect Haarmann with the disappearance of 27 youths, and he was charged with 27 murders—some of which he claimed were committed upon the insistence of Hans Grans, who was arrested on 8 July, and formally charged with being an accessory to murder one week later.

On 16 August 1924, Haarmann underwent a psychological examination at a Göttingen medical school; on 25 September, he was judged competent to stand trial and returned to Hanover to await trial.

==Trial==
The trial of Fritz Haarmann and Hans Grans began on 4 December 1924. Haarmann was charged with the murder of 27 boys and young men who had disappeared between September 1918 and June 1924. In 14 of these cases, Haarmann—who insisted upon conducting his own defence—acknowledged his guilt, although he claimed to be uncertain of the identification of the remaining 13 victims upon the list of charges. Grans pleaded not guilty to charges of being an accessory to murder in several of the murders. Initially, following a thorough security search, all members of the public were permitted access to the courtroom, although by the third day the judge excluded all spectators from the courtroom in the opening days of the trial as each murder was discussed in detail, due to the ongoing carnal and gruesome nature of the revelations.
The trial was one of the first major modern media events in Germany, and received extensive international press coverage, being described as the &quot;most revolting [case] in German criminal history.&quot; Varying sensational headlines—in which Haarmann was variously referred to by such titles as the &quot;Butcher of Hanover,&quot; the &quot;Vampire of Hanover,&quot; the &quot;Wholesale Murderer,&quot; and the &quot;Wolf Man&quot;—continuously appeared in the press.

Although Haarmann denied any premeditation in the crimes, and remained adamant the ultimate reason he killed was a &quot;mystery&quot; to him, he readily confessed to having killed 14 of the victims for whose murder he was tried and to retaining and selling many of their possessions, although he denied having sold the body parts of any of his victims as contraband meat. Haarmann&#x27;s denial that he had either consumed or sold human flesh would be supported by a medical expert, who testified on 6 December that none of the meat found in Haarmann&#x27;s apartment following his arrest was human.

When asked to identify photographs of his victims, Haarmann became taciturn and dismissive as he typically claimed to be unable to recognize any of his victims&#x27; photographs; however, in instances where he claimed to be unable to recognize his victims&#x27; faces but the victims&#x27; clothing or other personal belongings had been found in his possession, he would simply shrug and make comments to the effect of, &quot;I probably killed him,&quot; or: &quot;Charge it to me; it&#x27;s alright with me.&quot; For example, when asked to identify a photograph of victim Alfred Hogrefe, Haarmann stated: &quot;I certainly assume I killed Hogrefe, but I don&#x27;t remember his face.&quot;

Numerous exhibits were introduced into evidence in the opening days of the trial, including 285 sections of the skeletal structure—particularly skulls and thigh bones—recovered from the Leine River and forensically determined as belonging to young men under 20 years of age, the bucket which he used to store and transport human remains, and the extensively bloodstained camp bed upon which he had killed many of the victims at his Rote Reihe address. As had been the case when earlier asked whether he could recognize the photographs of any of his victims, Haarmann&#x27;s demeanour became dismissive upon the introduction of these exhibits; he denied any of the skulls introduced into evidence belonged to his victims, stating he had almost invariably &quot;mashed&quot; the victims&#x27; skulls, and had thrown only one undamaged skull into the river.

Several acquaintances and criminal associates of Haarmann testified for the prosecution, including former neighbours who testified to having purchased brawn or mince from Haarmann, whom they noted regularly left his apartment with packages of meat, but rarely arrived with them. Haarmann&#x27;s landlady, Elisabeth Engel, testified that Haarmann would regularly pour chopped pieces of meat into boiling water and would strain fat from meat Haarmann claimed was pork. This fat would invariably be poured into bottles. On one occasion in April 1924, Haarmann&#x27;s landlady and her family became ill after eating sausages in skins Haarmann claimed were sheep&#x27;s intestines. Another neighbour testified to the alarming number of youths whom he had seen entering Haarmann&#x27;s Neue Straße apartment, but whom he seldom observed leaving the address. This neighbour assumed Haarmann was selling youths to the Foreign Legion; another neighbour testified to having observed Haarmann throw a sack of bones into the Leine River. Two female acquaintances of Hans Grans also testified how, on one occasion in 1923, they discovered what they believed to be a human mouth boiling in a soup kettle in Haarmann&#x27;s apartment; these witnesses testified they had taken the item to Hanover police, who simply replied the piece of flesh may be a pig&#x27;s snout.
===Police scrutiny===
By the second week of the trial, testimony was introduced about how much the police knew about Haarmann&#x27;s criminal activities after his 1918 release from prison. The police apparently never suspected him for any of the cases of missing boys and young men in Hanover in 1923 and 1924, even though some of the victims were last seen in his company, and he had a long criminal record that included charges of sexual assault and battery.

==Conviction==
The trial lasted barely two weeks, and a total of 190 witnesses testified. On 19 December 1924, court reconvened to impose sentence upon both defendants. Judged sane and accountable for his actions, Haarmann was found guilty of 24 of the 27 murders and sentenced to death by beheading. He was acquitted of three murders which he denied committing. Upon hearing the sentence, Haarmann stood before the court and proclaimed, &quot;I accept the verdict fully and freely&quot;, before adding: &quot;I [shall] go to the decapitating block joyfully and happily.&quot; Grans became hysterical upon hearing he had been found guilty of incitement to murder and sentenced to death by beheading in relation to the murder of victim Adolf Hannappel, with an additional sentence of 12 years&#x27; imprisonment imposed for being an accessory to murder in the case of victim Fritz Wittig. Upon returning to his cell after hearing the verdict, Grans collapsed.

In the case of Hannappel, several witnesses testified to having seen Grans, in the company of Haarmann, pointing towards the youth. Haarmann claimed this was one of two murders committed upon the insistence of Grans and for this reason, Grans was sentenced to death. In the case of Wittig, police found a handwritten note from Haarmann, dated the day of Wittig&#x27;s disappearance and signed by both him and Grans, in which Grans agreed to pay Haarmann 20 gold marks for the youth&#x27;s suit. As the note indicated Grans&#x27; possible knowledge in the disappearance of Wittig, he was convicted of being an accomplice to Haarmann in this murder and sentenced to 12 years&#x27; imprisonment.

Haarmann made no appeal against the verdict; claiming his death would atone for his crimes and stating that, were he at liberty, he would likely kill again. Grans did lodge an appeal against his sentence, although his appeal was rejected on 6 February 1925.

==Execution==
At 6 o&#x27;clock on the morning of 15 April 1925, Haarmann was beheaded by guillotine in the grounds of Hanover prison. His executioner was Carl Gröpler. In accordance with German tradition, Haarmann was not informed of his execution date until the prior evening. Upon receipt of the news, he observed prayer with his pastor, before being granted his final wishes of an expensive cigar to smoke and Brazilian coffee to drink in his cell.

No members of the press were permitted to witness the execution, and the event was seen by only a handful of witnesses. According to published reports, although Haarmann was pale and nervous, he maintained a sense of bravado as he walked to the guillotine. The last words Haarmann spoke were: &quot;I am guilty, gentlemen, but, hard though it may be, I want to die as a man.&quot; Immediately prior to placing his head upon the execution apparatus, Haarmann added: &quot;I repent, but I do not fear death.&quot;

==Victims==
The true tally of Haarmann&#x27;s victims will never be known. Following his arrest, Haarmann made several imprecise statements regarding both the actual number of his victims he killed, and when he began killing. Initially, Haarmann claimed to have killed &quot;maybe 30, maybe 40&quot; victims; later, he would claim the true number of victims he had killed was between 50 and 70.

Footnotes

Haarmann was acquitted of three murders at his trial: those of Adolf Hennies, Hermann Wolf, and Hermann Bock. In each instance, strong circumstantial evidence existed attesting to his guilt.

In the case of Hermann Wolf, police established that prior to the youth&#x27;s disappearance, he had informed his father he had conversed with a detective at Hanover station. Haarmann is known to have given many of Wolf&#x27;s clothes to his landlady in the days immediately following his 44th birthday (shortly after Wolf was reported missing). Moreover, the youth&#x27;s distinctive belt buckle was found at Haarmann&#x27;s Rote Reihe address. Haarmann only chose to deny this murder midway through his trial, following heated threats made against him by the father of the murdered youth.

Haarmann was acquitted of the murder of Adolf Hennies due to conflicting testimony regarding the circumstances as to whether he or Grans actually murdered the youth. Although Haarmann admitted at his trial to having dismembered Hennies&#x27;s body, he claimed to have returned to his apartment and &quot;found a dead body lying there,&quot; to which, he claimed, Grans simply replied, &quot;One of yours.&quot; Grans would deny this claim, and would state that he had bought Hennies&#x27;s distinctive coat from Haarmann for eight Marks, after having been warned the coat was stolen. Due to this conflicting testimony, and the lack of an actual witness to the murder, neither Haarmann nor Grans were convicted of Hennies&#x27;s murder.

In the case of Hermann Bock, several friends of his testified at Haarmann&#x27;s trial that, prior to Haarmann&#x27;s arrest, they were actively dissuaded from filing a missing person report with police; these witnesses testified that Haarmann was insistent on filing the report himself (he had never done so). Other witnesses testified to having acquired various personal possessions belonging to the youth from Haarmann. In addition, a tailor testified at Haarmann&#x27;s trial to having been asked by Haarmann to alter the suit. Haarmann repeatedly contradicted himself regarding his claims as to how he acquired the youth&#x27;s possessions. It is likely that Haarmann chose to deny this murder due to evidence suggesting the murder had been premeditated, as opposed to being committed in the throes of passion. He had known the youth for several years prior to his murder, and Bock was known to be heterosexual. Due to his denial of having committed this particular murder, Haarmann was acquitted.

===Suspected victims===
===Hermann Koch===
In September 1918, Haarmann is believed to have killed a 14-year-old named Hermann Koch, a youth who disappeared just weeks prior to his first confirmed victim, Friedel Rothe. Haarmann is known to have kept company with Koch. He is also known to have written a letter to Koch&#x27;s school providing an explanation for the youth&#x27;s prolonged absence. As had been the case in the disappearance of Friedel Rothe, police had searched Haarmann&#x27;s Cellerstraße apartment in search of the youth, although no trace of Koch was found and charges against Haarmann in relation to the disappearance were dropped. Koch&#x27;s father had petitioned in 1921 for Haarmann to be tried for his son&#x27;s murder however his requests were officially rejected.

===Hans Keimes===
Haarmann is also strongly suspected of the murder of Hans Keimes, a 17-year-old Hanover youth who was reported missing on 17 March 1922 and whose nude, bound body was found in a canal on 6 May. The cause of death was listed as strangulation, and the body bore no signs of mutilation. A distinctive handkerchief bearing Grans&#x27; name was found lodged in Keimes&#x27;s throat.

Prior to the discovery of Keimes&#x27;s body, Haarmann is known to have both visited the youth&#x27;s parents offering to locate their son and to have immediately thereafter informed police that he believed Grans was responsible for Keimes&#x27;s disappearance. However, Hans Grans is known to have been in custody at the time of the disappearance of Keimes.

Two weeks before the disappearance of Keimes, Haarmann had returned to his Neue Straße apartment, having served six months in a labour camp for several acts of theft he committed in August 1921. Upon his return, Haarmann discovered that Grans had stolen much of his personal property and fraudulently obtained and spent his military pension while he had been incarcerated. This resulted in a violent argument between the two men culminating in Haarmann evicting Grans. Shortly thereafter, Grans and a criminal acquaintance named Hugo Wittkowski returned and further ransacked the apartment. Haarmann likely murdered Keimes in an attempt to frame Grans in reprisal for the theft of his property and pension.

Haarmann was not tried for the murder of either Koch or Keimes. Officially, both cases remain unsolved.

==Aftermath==
Following Haarmann&#x27;s execution, sections of his brain were removed for forensic analysis. An examination of slices of Haarmann&#x27;s brain revealed traces of meningitis, although no sections of Haarmann&#x27;s brain were permanently preserved. Nonetheless, Haarmann&#x27;s head was preserved in formaldehyde and remained in the possession of the Göttingen medical school from 1925 until 2014, when it was cremated.
The remains of Haarmann&#x27;s victims which had been recovered were buried together in a communal grave in Stöckener Cemetery in February 1925. In April 1928, a large granite memorial in the form of a triptych, inscribed with the names and ages of the victims, was erected over the communal grave.

The discovery of a letter from Haarmann declaring Hans Grans&#x27; innocence subsequently led to Grans receiving a second trial. This letter was dated 5 February 1925, and was addressed to the father of Grans. In this letter, Haarmann claimed that although he had been frustrated at having been seen as little more than a &quot;meal ticket&quot; by Grans, Grans &quot;had absolutely no idea that I killed&quot;. Furthermore, Haarmann claimed many of his accusations against Grans prior to his trial were obtained under extreme duress, and that he falsely accused Grans of instigating the murders of Hannappel and Witzel as a means of revenge. Haarmann claimed that his pastor would be informed as to the contents and the authenticity of the letter.

Hans Grans was retried in January 1926. He was charged with aiding and abetting Haarmann in the murders of victims Adolf Hannappel and Fritz Wittig. Although Grans stated in one address to the judge at this second trial that he expected to be acquitted, on 19 January, he was again found guilty of aiding and abetting Haarmann in both cases, although in this instance, he was sentenced to two concurrent 12-year sentences. After serving this 12-year sentence, Grans was extralegally interned in Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where he remained until the camp&#x27;s liberation in April 1945. Following the conclusion of the Second World War, he continued to live in Hanover until his death in 1975.

The murders committed by Haarmann stirred much discussion in Germany regarding methods used in police investigation, the treatment of mentally ill offenders, and the validity of the death penalty. However, the most heated topic of discussion in relation to the murders committed by Haarmann were issues relating to the subject of homosexuality, which was then illegal and punishable by imprisonment in Germany. The discovery of the murders subsequently stirred a wave of homophobia throughout Germany, with one historian noting: &quot;It split the [gay rights] movement irreparably, fed every prejudice against homosexuality, and provided new fodder for conservative adversaries of legal sex reform.&quot;

===Film===
* The first film to draw inspiration from the Haarmann case, &quot;M&quot;, was released in 1931. Directed by Fritz Lang, &quot;M&quot; starred Peter Lorre as a fictional child killer named Hans Beckert. In addition to drawing inspiration from the case of Fritz Haarmann, &quot;M&quot; was also inspired by the then-recent and notorious crimes of Peter Kürten and Carl Großmann.
* The film &quot;The Tenderness of the Wolves&quot; (&quot;Die Zärtlichkeit der Wölfe&quot;) was directly based upon Haarmann&#x27;s crimes. This film was released in July 1973 and was directed by Ulli Lommel. &quot;The Tenderness of the Wolves&quot; was both written by and starred Kurt Raab, who cast himself as Fritz Haarmann. German film director Rainer Werner Fassbinder produced the film and also appeared in a minor role as Haarmann&#x27;s criminal accomplice, Hugo Wittkowski.
* The most recent film to be directly based upon Haarmann&#x27;s murder spree, &quot;Der Totmacher&quot; (&quot;The Deathmaker&quot;), was released in 1995. This film starred Götz George as Haarmann. &quot;Der Totmacher&quot; focuses upon the written records of the psychiatric examinations of Haarmann conducted by Ernst Schultze; one of the main psychiatric experts who was to testify at Haarmann&#x27;s 1924 trial. The plot of &quot;Der Totmacher&quot; revolves around Haarmann&#x27;s interrogation after his arrest, as he is being interviewed by a court psychiatrist.
* The 2010 film &quot;&quot;, written and directed by Mark Vadik, was loosely based on both Haarmann and American serial killer Henry Lee Lucas.

<doc id="169967" wikidata="Q216608" url="?curid=169967" title="Bob Geldof">
<text>Robert Frederick Zenon Geldof (; born 5 October 1951) is an Irish singer-songwriter and political activist. He rose to prominence in the late 1970s as the lead singer of the Irish rock band the Boomtown Rats, who achieved popularity as part of the punk rock movement. The band had UK number one hits with his co-compositions &quot;Rat Trap&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like Mondays&quot;. Geldof starred as Pink in Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1982 film &quot;Pink Floyd – The Wall&quot;. As a fundraiser, Geldof organised the charity supergroup Band Aid and the concerts Live Aid and Live 8, and co-wrote &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, one of the best-selling singles to date.

Geldof is widely recognised for his activism, especially his anti-poverty efforts concerning Africa. In 1984, he and Midge Ure founded the charity supergroup Band Aid to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia. They went on to organise the charity super-concert Live Aid the following year and the Live 8 concerts in 2005. Geldof currently serves as an adviser to the ONE Campaign, co-founded by fellow Irish rock singer and activist Bono, and is a member of the Africa Progress Panel (APP), a group of ten distinguished individuals who advocate at the highest levels for equitable and sustainable development in Africa.

Geldof was granted an honorary knighthood (KBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in 1986 for his charity work in Africa: it is an honorary award as Geldof is an Irish citizen, but he is often referred to as &#x27;Sir Bob&#x27;. He is a recipient of the Man of Peace title which recognises individuals who have made &quot;an outstanding contribution to international social justice and peace&quot;, among numerous other awards and nominations. In 2005, he received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.

==Early life==
Geldof was born and brought up in Dún Laoghaire, Ireland, a son of Robert and Evelyn Geldof. His paternal grandfather, Zenon Geldof, was a Belgian immigrant and a hotel chef. His paternal grandmother, Amelia Falk, was a British Jew from London of German-Jewish descent. When Geldof was six years old, his mother Evelyn died at age 45 of a cerebral haemorrhage.

Geldof attended Blackrock College, where he was bullied for being a poor rugby player and for his middle name, Zenon. After working as a slaughterman, a road navvy and pea canner in Wisbech, England, he was hired as a music journalist in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, for &quot;The Georgia Straight&quot;. He briefly guest hosted the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation children&#x27;s program &quot;Switchback&quot;.

Returning to Ireland in 1975, he became the lead singer of the Boomtown Rats, a rock group closely linked with the punk movement. In 1978, The Boomtown Rats had their first No. 1 single in the UK with &quot;Rat Trap&quot;, the first new wave chart-topper in Britain. In 1979, they gained international attention with their second UK No. 1, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like Mondays&quot;. This was both successful and controversial. Geldof had written it in the aftermath of Brenda Ann Spencer&#x27;s attempted massacre at an elementary school in San Diego, California, in 1979. In 1980, The Boomtown Rats released the album &quot;Mondo Bongo&quot;.

Geldof became known as a colourful interview subject. The Boomtown Rats&#x27; first appearance on Ireland&#x27;s &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; saw Geldof as deliberately brusque to host Gay Byrne and during his interview, he attacked Irish politicians and the Catholic Church, which he blamed for many of the country&#x27;s problems. He responded to nuns in the audience who tried to shout him down by saying they had &quot;an easy life with no material worries in return for which they gave themselves body and soul to the church&quot;. He also criticised Blackrock College. The interview caused uproar, making it impossible for The Boomtown Rats to play in Ireland again.

In January 2013, Geldof announced The Boomtown Rats would be reforming to play together for the first time since 1986 at that year&#x27;s Isle of Wight Festival in June. They have subsequently announced further tour dates and released a new CD &quot;Back to Boomtown: Classic Rats Hits&quot;.

===After the Boomtown Rats===
Geldof left the Boomtown Rats in 1986 to launch a solo career and publish his autobiography, &quot;Is That It?&quot;, which was a UK best-seller.

His first solo records sold reasonably well and spawned the hit singles &quot;This Is The World Calling&quot; (co-written with Dave Stewart of Eurythmics) and &quot;The Great Song of Indifference&quot;. He also occasionally performed with other artists, such as David Gilmour and Thin Lizzy; a performance of &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; with Gilmour is documented in the DVD release &quot;David Gilmour in Concert&quot; (2002). In 1992, he performed at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert with the surviving members of Queen at the old Wembley Stadium, singing a song he jokingly claimed to have co-written with Mercury, called &quot;Too Late God&quot;. (The song was actually co-written by Karl Hyde.)

Geldof has also worked as a DJ for XFM radio. In 1998, he erroneously announced Ian Dury&#x27;s death from cancer, possibly due to hoax information from a listener who was disgruntled at the station&#x27;s change of ownership. The event caused music paper &quot;NME&quot; (who had been involved in a running feud with Geldof since his Boomtown Rats days—primarily due to his disparagement of The Clash) to call Geldof &#x27;the world&#x27;s worst DJ&#x27;.
Along with U2&#x27;s Bono, he has devoted much time since 2000 to campaigning for debt relief for developing countries. His commitments in this field, including the organisation of the Live 8 concerts, kept Geldof from producing any more musical output since 2001&#x27;s album &quot;Sex, Age &amp; Death&quot;.

In 2002, he was listed as one of the 100 Greatest Britons in a poll conducted among the general public, despite not being British.

After Live 8, Geldof returned to his career as a musician by releasing a box set containing all of his solo albums entitled &quot;Great Songs of Indifference – The Anthology 1986–2001&quot; in late 2005. Following that release, Geldof toured, albeit with mixed success.

In July 2006, Geldof arrived at Milan&#x27;s Arena Civica, a venue capable of holding 12,000 people, to play a scheduled concert to find that the organisers had not put the tickets on general sale and that only 45 people had shown up. Geldof refused to go on stage once he found out how small the attendance was. To offer some compensation for fans, Geldof stopped to sign autographs for those who had shown up. He then played a well-attended free &quot;Storytellers&quot; concert for MTV Italy in Naples, in October 2006.

==Charity work==
Geldof&#x27;s first major charity involvement took place in September 1981 when he performed as a solo artist for Amnesty International&#x27;s benefit show &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball&quot;, held at Drury Lane theatre in London&#x27;s West End. At the invitation of Amnesty show producer Martin Lewis, Geldof performed a solo version of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like Mondays&quot;. Other rock artists had &#x27;planted a seed&#x27; and appeared to have affected Geldof in a similar manner. Monty Python alumnus John Cleese conceived (and directed) the show, and on its impact on Geldof, Sting states &quot;he took the &#x27;Ball&#x27; and ran with it.&quot;

===Band Aid===

In 1984, Geldof responded to a BBC News report from Michael Buerk about the famine in Ethiopia by mobilising the pop world to do something about the images he had seen. With Midge Ure of Ultravox he wrote &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; in order to raise funds. The song was recorded in a single day at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London on 25 November 1984 by various artists performing under the name of Band Aid.

In its first week of release, the single became the UK&#x27;s fastest-seller of all time, entering the UK Singles Chart at number one and staying there for five weeks, becoming the Christmas number one of 1984. It went on to sell over three million copies, making it the biggest-selling single in UK history up to that point, a title it held for almost 13 years. The single was also a major US hit, peaking at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and selling an estimated 2.5 million copies in the US by January 1985. The single would eventually sell 11.7 million copies worldwide.

New versions of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; were recorded in 1989 and 2004. In November 2014, Geldof announced that he would be forming a further incarnation of Band Aid, to be known as Band Aid 30, to record an updated version of the charity single, with the proceeds going to treat victims of the Ebola virus in West Africa.

===Live Aid===
As Geldof began to learn more about the situation, he discovered that one of the main reasons why African nations were in such dire peril was the obligation to make repayments on loans that their countries had taken from Western banks. For every pound donated in aid, ten times as much would have to leave the country in loan repayments. It became obvious that one song was not enough.

Geldof and Ure organised Live Aid, a huge event staged simultaneously on 13 July 1985 at the Wembley Stadium in London and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia. Thanks to an unprecedented decision by the BBC to clear its schedules for 16 hours of rock music, the event was also broadcast live in the UK on television and radio.

It was one of the most monumental stage shows in history, with Phil Collins flying on Concorde so that he could play at both Wembley and Philadelphia on the same day.

During the broadcast of Live Aid, Geldof shocked viewers into giving cash by not only twice mouthing profanities but also by slamming his fist on the table and ordering them not to go out to the pub but to stay in and watch the show. Nearly seven hours into the concert in London, Geldof gave an infamous interview in which he used the word &quot;fuck&quot;. The BBC presenter David Hepworth, conducting the interview, had attempted to provide a list of addresses to which potential donations should be sent; Geldof interrupted him in mid-flow and shouted: &quot;Fuck the address, let&#x27;s get the [phone] numbers!&quot; It has passed into folklore that he yelled at the audience, &quot;Give us your fucking money!&quot; although Geldof has stated that this phrase was never uttered. Due to his Irish accent, the profanity was stated to be misheard as &quot;fock&quot; and &quot;focking&quot; respectively. After the outburst, donations increased to £300 per second.

The harrowing video of dying, skeletal children—introduced by David Bowie following the end of his set—that had been made by CBC photo-journalists setting their films to the tune of &quot;Drive&quot; by The Cars, contributed to the concert&#x27;s success.

In total, Live Aid raised over £150 million for famine relief. Geldof subsequently received an honorary knighthood, at age 34, for his efforts. His autobiography, written soon after with Paul Vallely, was entitled &quot;Is That It?&quot;. The book achieved further fame for being featured on the General Certificate of Secondary Education examination syllabus in a following year.

Much of the money raised by Live Aid went to NGOs in Ethiopia, some of which were under the influence or control of the Derg military junta. Some journalists have suggested that the Derg was able to use Live Aid and Oxfam money to fund its enforced resettlement and &quot;villagification&quot; programmes, under which at least 3 million people are said to have been displaced and between 50,000 and 100,000 killed. However, in November 2010 the BBC formally apologised to Geldof for misleading implications in its stories on the subject of Band Aid, saying it had &#x27;no evidence&#x27; that Band Aid money specifically went to buy weapons.

===Commission for Africa===
In January 2004, on a visit to friends in Africa, Geldof came to believe that more people were at risk of starvation there than had died in the famine of 1984/85 which had prompted Live Aid. He telephoned the British Prime Minister Tony Blair from Addis Ababa. According to the Live 8 programme notes by Geldof&#x27;s biographer and friend, Paul Vallely, the Prime Minister responded: &quot;Calm down Bob. ... And come and see me as soon as you get back.&quot;

The result was the Commission for Africa. Blair invited Geldof and 16 other Commissioners, the majority from Africa and many of them politicians in power, to undertake a year-long study of Africa&#x27;s problems. They came up with two conclusions: that Africa needed to change, to improve its governance and combat corruption, and that the rich world needed to support that change in new ways. That meant doubling aid, delivering debt cancellation, and reforming trade rules. The Commission drew up a detailed plan of how that could be done. It reported in March 2005. To force the issue Geldof decided to create a new international lobby for Africa with eight simultaneous concerts around the world to put pressure on the G8. He called it Live 8. The commission&#x27;s recommendations later became the blueprint for the G8 Gleneagles African debt and aid package.

===Africa Progress Panel===
Geldof is a member of the Africa Progress Panel (APP), a group of ten distinguished individuals who advocate at the highest levels for equitable and sustainable development in Africa. Every year, the Panel releases a report, the Africa Progress Report, that outlines an issue of immediate importance to the continent and suggests a set of associated policies. In 2012, the Africa Progress Report highlighted issues of Jobs, Justice and Equity. The 2013 report outlined issues relating to oil, gas and mining in Africa.

===DATA and One Campaign===
Bob Geldof worked closely with DATA (Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa), an organisation founded by U2&#x27;s Bono in 2002 to promote debt relief, third-world trade and AIDS relief in Africa. It merged with One Campaign in 2008, where Geldof also is very active. In June 2009, on behalf of One Campaign, he co-edited a special edition of the Italian newspaper &quot;La Stampa&quot; with a view on 35th G8 summit.

===Live 8 concerts===

On 31 March 2005, Geldof and Ure announced the Live 8 project, to raise awareness of issues that burden Africa, including government debt, trade barriers, hunger, and AIDS issues. Geldof organised ten concerts on 2 July 2005 in large cities throughout the industrialised world. They featured musicians from different genres and locations around the world. The cities where Live 8 concerts were played were in industrialised countries, and drew huge crowds. The locations were London, Paris, Berlin, Rome, Philadelphia, Barrie, Chiba, Johannesburg, Moscow, Cornwall and Edinburgh.

The concerts were free, and were scheduled just days before world leaders gathered in Gleneagles, for the G8 economic summit, on 6 July. Ure organised the &#x27;final push&#x27; Live 8 concert at Edinburgh. &#x27;The boys and girls with guitars will finally get to turn the world on its axis,&#x27; Geldof said in a statement. Pink Floyd&#x27;s performance in London was their first since 1981 to include original vocalist/bassist, Roger Waters.

===Night for Ukraine benefit===
Geldof performed his rendition of Nick Lowe&#x27;s &quot;(What&#x27;s So Funny &#x27;Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding&quot; at Night for Ukraine, a fundraising benefit held at the Roundhouse in north London on the evening of March 9, 2022, with the funds raised being donated to the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal, to provide aid to people fleeing Ukraine following the Russian invasion. The event was organized by Fabien Riggall in collaboration with the Ukrainian pop duo Bloom Twins.

==Criticism of his charity work==
Although part of the campaign &quot;Make Poverty History&quot; (MPH), Live 8 was accused by John Hilary, then a senior executive of the campaign, of hijacking MPH by planning its concerts on the same day as the march in Edinburgh, which was said to be the biggest social justice march in Scottish history.

Geldof was also criticised for the lack of African acts performing at Live 8. Geldof responded that only the biggest-selling artists would attract the huge audience required to capture the attention of the world in the run-up to the G8 meeting. In the lead-up to the G8 summit, Geldof, who had been a member of Tony Blair&#x27;s Commission for Africa on which the Gleneagles recommendations were largely based, labelled Kumi Naidoo&#x27;s criticism of the summit &quot;a disgrace&quot;. Some leading African campaigners have asked Geldof to stand down from the global anti-poverty movement, and the &quot;New Internationalist&quot; (between January and February 2006) said &#x27;It would be long overdue if he did.&#x27;

There were also accusations that Live 8 gave unqualified support to the personal and political agendas of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, particularly in the lead-up to an election. Though many felt that it was the British politicians who had accepted Geldof&#x27;s agenda, rather than the other way round, this led to accusations that Geldof had compromised his cause.

The promises made for Africa at the Gleneagles summit were widely praised: &quot;the greatest summit for Africa ever&quot; (Kofi Annan), &quot;an important, if incomplete, boost to the development prospects of the poorest countries&quot; economist (Jeffrey Sachs) or &quot;a major breakthrough on debt&quot; (Kevin Wakins, former head of research at Oxfam). But many aid agencies pronounced their disappointment with the outcome, feeling that the strict conditions imposed on African countries for accepting debt relief left them little better off than before. The &quot;New Internationalist&quot; scathingly stated, since becoming prominent in the salvation of Africa, &quot;Geldof has re-released the entire back catalogue of the Boomtown Rats.&quot;

Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher became one of the more vocal sceptics about the impact of Live 8, citing his belief that rock stars have less influence over world leaders than popular culture may believe. His explanation was:
==Controversies==
Geldof swore on the music television programme &quot;&quot;, saying &quot;Fuck the tape&quot; while concluding his chat with Cat Deeley. At the NME awards in 2006, when accepting an award, Geldof referred to the host Russell Brand as a &quot;cunt&quot;. Brand responded by saying &quot;It&#x27;s no wonder Bob Geldof knows so much about famine – he&#x27;s been dining out on &#x27;I Don&#x27;t Like Mondays&#x27; for 30 years&quot;. Then, in mid-July 2006, he infuriated many New Zealanders by criticising the New Zealand government&#x27;s foreign aid contribution as &quot;shameful&quot; and &quot;pathetic&quot;. Winston Peters, the Minister of Foreign Affairs responded that Geldof failed to recognise the &quot;quality&quot; of New Zealand aid as well as other New Zealand contributions.

During mid-November 2008, a local for-profit organisation, Diversity@Work, invited Geldof to Melbourne, to speak about Third World poverty and the failure of governments to combat the crisis. It was later revealed that he was paid $100,000 for his speech, which included a luxury hotel room and first-class airfares.

===AIDS 2014 Conference===
During a special session at the XX International AIDS Conference, 2014, Geldof referred to sex workers as &quot;hookers&quot;, for which he was subsequently criticised. Christian Vega, a sex workers&#x27; rights activist and a member of Victoria&#x27;s peer-only Victorian Sex Industry Network (VIXEN), criticised speakers including Geldof for their use of pejorative language; Vega contended that this language perpetuated stigmas that are among the key barriers to HIV prevention. Geldof responded to the criticism during the closing session of the conference: &quot;I read today in the paper that my talk yesterday was littered with profanities – fuck them.&quot; In Geldof&#x27;s view, rights-based language hampered HIV prevention, and he defended using terms such as &quot;hookers&quot; and &quot;&quot;: &quot;Let&#x27;s not get distracted by diversionary language. Let&#x27;s call it as it is&quot;. In a radio show after the conference on Joy 94.9, Vega dismissed Geldof&#x27;s view that rights-based language was a waste of time as &quot;ridiculous&quot;. In Vega&#x27;s view, this language served as an important tool to challenge stigma and discrimination, particularly within an HIV context.

===Freedom of Dublin and Easter Rising comments===
In 2016, when Ireland was marking the 100th anniversary of the Easter Rising, Geldof caused controversy when he likened the rebel leaders to Islamist suicide bombers. The uprising in Dublin against British rule was a key event that led to Irish independence. Geldof called it the &quot;original sin&quot; of the Irish state.

The following year, Geldof returned his Freedom of Dublin award in protest at Burmese leader Aung San Suu Kyi holding the same honour. He said he does not want to be associated &quot;with an individual currently engaged in the mass ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya people&quot;. He added that if Suu Kyi &quot;is stripped of her Dublin Freedom, perhaps the council would see fit to restore to me that which I take such pride in&quot;. The Lord Mayor of Dublin, Mícheál Mac Donncha, accused Geldof of hypocrisy, saying &quot;I find it ironic that he makes this gesture while proudly retaining his title as Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, given the shameful record of British imperialism&quot;.

One month later, Dublin City Council voted to revoke the Freedom of the City from both Suu Kyi and Geldof, with several councillors saying Geldof had &quot;insulted&quot; Dublin. Geldof was furious at the decision to revoke his award, calling it a &quot;Sinn Féin stitch-up&quot; because of his Easter Rising comments.

===Mauritius Leaks===
After being criticised earlier in the decade for his stance on aid to African countries, in July 2019, according to a report on its &quot;Mauritius Leaks&quot; project by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), Bob Geldof was mentioned as allegedly involved in tax avoidance by corporations and individuals doing business in Africa and other continents. His private equity fund 8 Miles (named after the shortest distance between Europe and Africa: the eight miles width of the Strait of Gibraltar), which aimed to generate a 20 per cent return by exclusively buying stakes in African startup businesses, had set up subsidiaries in the tax haven of Mauritius, &quot;an offshore jurisdiction with a wide network of double taxation treaties in interesting markets&quot;. Geldof declined to comment on the leaks.

==Businessman==
By 1992, Geldof had established himself as a businessman through co-ownership of the TV production company Planet 24, which made early-morning Channel 4 show &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;. Planet 24 was sold to Carlton TV in 1999. TV production company Ten Alps was founded the next day by Geldof and business partner Alex Connock. In April 2011, a new entertainment-formats company, Pretend, was launched.

The &quot;Dictionary of Man&quot;, announced by Geldof in 2007, is a project he started with director John Maguire, and is financed by the BBC. It was planned that the collected material would be displayed on a website, and be available for distribution through DVDs, books, magazines, CDs, and exhibitions. Geldof reportedly had been planning it since he visited Niger in the 1980s and became aware of the number of native languages becoming lost forever as native speakers died.

, he served a term as patron of the Exeter Entrepreneurs&#x27; Society at the University of Exeter.

Geldof is chairman of 8 Miles, a private equity firm active in Africa.

===Groupcall===
In 2002, he became a founding partner of Groupcall, which specialises in providing communication software and data extraction tools to the education, public and business sectors. His initial involvement arose from concerns for his children&#x27;s safety.

==Views==
===Politics===

In 2002, Geldof appeared in an advertisement opposing the possibility of the United Kingdom joining the single EU currency, saying it was &quot;not anti-European to be against the euro&quot;. He also criticised the European Union in 2004 for what he called its &quot;pathetic&quot; response to Ethiopia&#x27;s food crisis. MEP Glenys Kinnock responded that Geldof&#x27;s comments were &quot;unhelpful and misinformed&quot;.

In 2003, during a visit to Ethiopia, Geldof praised U.S. President George W. Bush&#x27;s proposal to fight AIDS in Africa.

In December 2005, Geldof agreed to give advice on global poverty to the Conservative Party. He stated, however, that he was uninterested in party politics: &quot;I&#x27;ve said I&#x27;ll shake hands with the devil on my left and the devil on my right to get to where we need to be.&quot;

Geldof was a vocal supporter of the unsuccessful campaign for the UK to vote &quot;Remain&quot; in the 2016 referendum on the UK&#x27;s membership of the European Union. Shortly before the vote, in what was described as the &quot;most surreal day in British politics ever&quot;, Geldof led a flotilla on the River Thames to attack an opposition flotilla led by Eurosceptic politician Nigel Farage. Later that year, Geldof campaigned for the Liberal Democrat candidate Sarah Olney at the Richmond Park by-election. He described Brexit as &quot;the greatest act of national self-harm&quot; in British history and vowed to &quot;undermine&quot; Theresa May every step of the way. He said the EU was &quot;a mess&quot; but warned Britain&#x27;s young people had their futures &quot;taken from them&quot; as a result of the referendum.

Ahead of the 2024 United Kingdom general election Geldof posted a video endorsing the re-election of Conservative candidate and Minister of State for Development and Africa Andrew Mitchell.

===Fathers&#x27; rights===
From January 2002 until sometime in 2005, Geldof listened very closely to Father&#x27;s Rights campaigners, and it was reported that he had sacks of mail arriving at his door on a daily basis from fathers who were unhappy with the British family courts. He said, &quot;I am heartbroken. I just cannot believe what happens to people, what is done to them in the name of the law. You only have to open your eyes to see what I call the &#x27;Sad Dads on Sundays Syndrome&#x27;&quot;. He has also called for The Children Act to be repealed and his latest statement to Father&#x27;s Rights campaigners was, &quot;It&#x27;s not in my nature to shut up&quot;.

===Population===
In March 2012, Geldof expressed concern about rising population and falling water levels in Arab countries. He also predicted famine, plague, and wars if the population did not stabilise. Geldof asked countries to lower their birth rates to lessen the burden on the environment. &quot;We must see the possibility of life, not just to individual children, but to the human species,&quot; he said &quot;And I&#x27;m not that optimistic.&quot;

==Awards and honours==
Geldof has received many awards for his fund-raising work including being invested by Elizabeth II as an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1986. Geldof is entitled to use the post-nominal letters &quot;KBE&quot; but not to be styled &quot;Sir&quot;, as he is not a citizen of a Commonwealth realm; nevertheless the nickname &quot;Sir Bob&quot; has stuck and media reports continue to refer to him as &quot;Sir Bob Geldof&quot;.

In 1985, he was made a Grand Officer of the Order of the Two Niles by Sudan&#x27;s president Abdel Rahman Swar al-Dahab. In 1986 Geldof was made a Freeman of the Borough of Swale, in north Kent, England. Geldof had for some years been resident in the borough, at Davington Priory, Faversham, and was still living there . He received his award during a special meeting of the Swale Borough Council from the mayor, Councillor Richard Moreton, and the mayoress, Rose Moreton.

In 2004, Geldof was made a development chief in Ghana. This subsequently led to some controversy, as a number of people have since questioned why he hardly ever returns to Ajumako-Bisease (the village that ennobled him) anymore.

In 2006 the &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine conducted a survey of their readers to find the &quot;Heroes of our Time&quot;, Geldof was voted third behind Aung San Suu Kyi and Nelson Mandela.

===Other awards===
*2005: received a Man of Peace Award.
*2006: awarded the medal of Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.
*2006: awarded the Freedom of Dublin City for his humanitarian work. In 2017, Geldof returned the award in a protest at Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi holding the same honour. Dublin City Council voted to revoke both Suu Kyi&#x27;s and Geldof&#x27;s awards.
*2010: awarded Hon. Master of Arts degree from the University for the Creative Arts.
*2013: awarded the Freedom of the City of London.

==Personal life==
Geldof&#x27;s longtime girlfriend and first wife was Paula Yates. Yates was a rock journalist, and later became the presenter of the music show &quot;The Tube&quot; which ran from 1982 to 1987. She was known for her in-bed interviews on the show &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; from 1992. Geldof met Yates when she became an obsessed fan of The Boomtown Rats during the band&#x27;s early days. They became a couple in 1976 when Yates flew to Paris to surprise him when the band was playing there.

Before they were married, the couple had their first daughter, Fifi Trixibelle Geldof, born 31 March 1983. She was named Fifi after Bob&#x27;s aunt Fifi and Trixibelle because Yates wanted a &#x27;belle&#x27; in the family.

After 10 years together, Geldof and Yates married in June 1986 in Las Vegas, with Simon Le Bon (of Duran Duran) acting as Geldof&#x27;s best man. The couple later had two more daughters, Peaches Honeyblossom Geldof (known as Peaches Geldof) on 13 March 1989, and Little Pixie Geldof (known as Pixie Geldof) on 17 September 1990. Pixie is said to be named after a celebrity daughter character from the cartoon &quot;Celeb&quot; in the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye,&quot; itself a lampoon of the names the Geldofs gave to their other children.

In February 1995, Yates left Geldof for Michael Hutchence, the lead singer of Australian band INXS. Yates had first met Hutchence in 1985 when she interviewed him on &quot;The Tube.&quot; Geldof and Yates divorced in May 1996. Yates and Hutchence had a daughter, Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence (known as Tiger), in July 1996.

Hutchence died by suicide in a Sydney hotel room on 22 November 1997. After Hutchence&#x27;s death, Geldof and Yates each gave police statements on the phone calls they exchanged with Hutchence that morning but did not volunteer their phone records. Yates&#x27; statement on 26 November included &quot;He was frightened and couldn&#x27;t stand a minute more without his baby ... [he] was terribly upset and he said, &#x27;I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ll live without seeing Tiger. Yates contended that Geldof had repeatedly said, &quot;Don&#x27;t forget, I am above the law,&quot; referring to his influence since Live Aid. Geldof&#x27;s police statements and evidence to the coroner indicated that he patiently listened to Hutchence who was &quot;hectoring and abusive and threatening.&quot; A friend of Yates and Geldof confirmed the substance of this call and added that Geldof had said, &quot;I know what time the call ended, it was 20 to 7, I was going to log it as a threatening call.&quot; The occupant in the hotel room next to Hutchence&#x27;s heard a loud male voice and swearing at about 5:00 a.m. The coroner was satisfied that this voice was Hutchence arguing with Geldof.

Geldof later went to court and obtained full custody of his three children. He has since become an outspoken advocate of fathers&#x27; rights. After Yates&#x27; death from a heroin overdose in 2000, Geldof became the legal guardian of Tiger Hutchence and later adopted her in 2007. As of 2019, Tiger&#x27;s legal name is Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence Geldof.

In April 2014, his daughter Peaches died at the age of 25, of a heroin overdose. Geldof stated the family was &quot;beyond pain&quot; after he confirmed the news of her death.

Geldof announced his engagement to French actress Jeanne Marine, his partner of 18 years, on 1 May 2014, and they were married in France on 28 April 2015. They currently reside in Battersea, South London.

Regarding his Jewish ancestry, in an interview with the Manchester-based &quot;Jewish Telegraph&quot;, Geldof said &quot;I was a quarter Catholic, a quarter Protestant, a quarter Jewish and a quarter nothing – the nothing won.&quot;

According to The Sunday Times Rich List, Geldof was worth £32 million in 2012.

<text>Orleans is an American pop rock band formed in 1972 in Woodstock, New York by John Hall, Larry Hoppen and Wells Kelly. Larry&#x27;s younger brother, bassist Lance Hoppen and drummer Jerry Marotta joined the band in 1972 and 1976, respectively. The band is best known for its hits &quot;Dance with Me&quot; (No. 6 in 1975); &quot;Still the One&quot; (No. 5 in 1976), from the album &quot;Waking and Dreaming&quot;; and &quot;Love Takes Time&quot; (No. 11 in 1979). The group&#x27;s name evolved from the music it was playing when it formed; their music is inspired in part by Louisiana artists, including Allen Toussaint and the Neville Brothers.

==History==
===1960s===
Drummer Wells Kelly, the son of Cornell University&#x27;s dean of Architecture, Burnham Kelly, first met John Hall, an in-demand session player and member of the group Kangaroo, in the late 1960s when he played with him in a group called Thunderfrog and later appeared on John&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Action&quot;, released in 1970.

In 1969 Wells joined the first incarnation of King Harvest who would have a hit four years later, in 1973, with the song &quot;Dancing in the Moonlight&quot;, a song written by Wells&#x27; brother, Sherman Kelly, and first recorded by Boffalongo, an Ithaca-based group Wells joined in 1970 after leaving King Harvest.

Hall and his wife, Johanna, gained some notability when their song &quot;Half Moon&quot; appeared on Janis Joplin&#x27;s posthumous album &quot;Pearl&quot;. Hall had recorded and toured with Taj Mahal and Seals and Crofts and decided to relocate from New York City to Woodstock, New York, at the request of producer and pianist John Simon, to be close to Bearsville Studios and the musical scene there.

Larry Hoppen grew up in Bay Shore on Long Island and relocated to Ithaca, New York to attend college there in the late 1960s. He was a founding member of Boffalongo, who had two albums released by United Artists. Sherman Kelly and &quot;Dancin&#x27; in the Moonlight&quot; appeared on the second album. Wells Kelly joined the band after that.

===1970s===
After a swing through Europe playing guitar behind Karen Dalton on a Santana tour, Hall decided to start his own band in Woodstock, New York. After months of playing the Café Expresso with different rhythm sections, Hall called his old friend Wells Kelly in Ithaca in December 1971 and asked him to join his group. Multi-instrumentalist Kelly accepted the offer on the condition that he play piano. 

The group initially included Hall on guitar, Roy Markowitz on drums, Bill Gelber on bass and Kelly on electric piano. When Markowitz and Gelber left the band, Wells told John about his former bandmate from the Ithaca-based Boffalongo. Hall, who had once jammed with him before, encouraged Kelly to call Larry Hoppen, who accepted the invitation to join the new group, christened &quot;Orleans&quot; by Wells in late January 1972. For months they played as a trio, often switching instruments throughout the show.

Larry&#x27;s 18-year-old brother, Lance Hoppen, was brought into Orleans around Halloween 1972 to play bass, freeing up Larry to play more guitar and keyboards.

Orleans found its core audience touring the clubs and college circuit of the Northeastern United States, crossing paths with other up-and-comers such as Bonnie Raitt, Tom Waits and Hall &amp; Oates. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine called Orleans &quot;the best unrecorded band in America&quot;. Showcase performances in New York led to a recording contract with ABC Dunhill Records and the release of the self-titled debut album in the fall of 1973, which had been recorded in Muscle Shoals, Alabama with producers Roger Hawkins and Barry Beckett at the helm.

The group&#x27;s second record, &quot;Orleans II&quot; recorded at Bearsville Studios, was originally released in Europe in 1974 but ABC declined to release it in the US since management felt there were &quot;no hit singles&quot; on the album (despite the fact that it contained the first-version recordings of both &quot;Let There Be Music&quot; and &quot;Dance With Me&quot;) and dropped the group from the label. After the band&#x27;s later successes, &quot;Orleans II&quot; was finally put out in America in 1978, combined with the first album as a double LP called &quot;Before the Dance&quot;. It was also released as a CD in Japan later on in the 1990s under its originally slated title &quot;Dance With Me&quot;.

In the meantime, the group was back to showcasing for a new record deal. When Orleans was heard at Max&#x27;s Kansas City, they were signed and produced by Chuck Plotkin, then head of A&amp;R for Asylum Records. The band then scored its first &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charting single &quot;Let There Be Music&quot; (No. 55), taken from their third album, &quot;Let There Be Music&quot;, released in March 1975.

The follow-up single, &quot;Dance With Me&quot; (reshaped and re-recorded from &quot;Orleans II&quot; with Plotkin at the helm), went to No. 6 on the pop charts and the band became part of mainstream of American pop music. Atypical of the high-energy, earthy, R&amp;B and Rock n&#x27; Roll mix of styles they had been previously identified with, &quot;Dance With Me&quot; cast the band in a more &quot;soft-rock&quot; light and landed them a tour with Melissa Manchester.

While recording their next album, &quot;Waking and Dreaming&quot;, in early 1976, the group was joined by second drummer Jerry Marotta, freeing Wells Kelly to sing more and play keyboards.

&quot;Still the One&quot; (released in July 1976), from &quot;Waking and Dreaming&quot;, cemented Orleans&#x27; relationship with the American public. While the single peaked eventually at No. 5, the band was on a major cross-country ten-week tour with label-mate Jackson Browne, ending in November 1976.

In January 1977 the single was chosen as the theme song for the ABC television network (the parent of ABC Records) and has since been used for an endless number of commercials and movie soundtracks.

===John Hall departs===
The follow-up, &quot;Reach&quot;, with John Hall on lead, peaked at No. 51 in March 1977. Around then, however, internal stresses and disagreements over material and musical direction prompted guitarist and songwriter Hall to announce his intention to leave the band in search of a solo career, which he did in June 1977 after touring commitments were satisfied. Marotta departed not long afterwards to join Hall &amp; Oates and eventually moved to Peter Gabriel&#x27;s band.

After several months of mulling things over and working with other musicians (Lance and Larry joined Marotta in the backing band for Garland Jeffreys while Kelly worked with the Beach Boys), the Hoppen brothers and Kelly decided to continue the band in late 1977, bringing in new members Robert Martin (vocals, keyboards, sax, horns) and Connecticut musician Bob Leinbach (vocals, keyboards, trombone), who had played with Larry Hoppen and the Kellys in Boffalongo during the Ithaca years and had completed a stint with the group the Fabulous Rhinestones. The new lineup signed a contract with the Infinity Records label and their debut there, &quot;Forever&quot; (April 1979), produced the No. 11 hit &quot;Love Takes Time&quot;. Collectively, the three Hot 100 top 20 Orleans hits have been aired over 10 million times.

===1980s===
In 1980 Infinity went bankrupt after an album with performances by Pope John Paul II (who was on a tour of the U.S. in the fall of 1979) failed to sell. Infinity was absorbed into MCA Records, who failed to promote their follow-up album, simply titled &quot;Orleans&quot;. This last, recorded in Woodstock, featured only the Hoppens and Wells Kelly as Orleans proper, since the others had left earlier in the year. Nonetheless, the album featured guest appearances from all past members, including John Hall who was in the process of forming the John Hall Band with Leinbach as a member. &quot;Orleans&quot; was produced by Englishman Robin Lumley, mixed at Trident Studios in London and featured Lumley&#x27;s friend, Phil Collins, contributing backing vocals to one track.

Just after recording that 1980 release, the group added Dennis &quot;Fly&quot; Amero (guitars, vocals) to replace Leinbach. The live lineup still featured Robert (R.A.) Martin and the band completed a tour of amusement parks that summer, only to learn that their accountant had misappropriated funds, leaving them in debt. Martin left, &quot;Fly&quot; stayed, Larry and Lance recruited their younger brother, Lane Hoppen, to play keyboards and drummer Charlie Shew, at that time performing under the pseudonym Eric Charles, was brought aboard to play alongside Wells Kelly. Charlie then replaced Wells when he left by early 1981 to relocate to New York City.

Reviewing &quot;Orleans&quot; in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau said, &quot;In case you&#x27;re interested, this band is mucho hot among Eastern rock cognoscenti (read, know-it-alls). Very pleasant, too, although John Hall doesn&#x27;t sing as tasty as he plays. The only impressive song is &#x27;Half Moon.&#x27; Anything Janis Joplin used to sing is impressive, so that may not mean much.&quot;

Orleans then signed with the fledgling Radio Records and recorded their next album, &quot;One of a Kind&quot;, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in the summer of 1982. The album (released in September 1982) put forth a more &quot;early 80s style&quot; Pop keyboard driven sound and included brand new band member Michael Mugrage, replacing &quot;Fly&quot; Amero on guitar at the request of the album&#x27;s producers, Don Silver and Ben Wisch. Jerry Marotta briefly rejoined the band to play on the album but was soon replaced by drummer Nicholas Parker after its release. But Radio Records, likewise, went bankrupt just as &quot;One of a Kind&quot; was hitting the record store shelves.

Without a record label, Orleans struggled in the early 1980s, playing mostly small clubs in the Northeast. At the same time, Larry and Lance formed a side group, Mood Ring, with Bob Leinbach, Nicholas Parker, singer/songwriter Robbie Dupree (of &quot;Steal Away&quot; fame) and various other Woodstockers who drifted in and out to play for fun, mostly at parties and clubs. Mood Ring played some club dates in 1984 &amp; 1985 billed as Robbie Dupree and Orleans (In the late 2000s, Mood Ring reconvened to do occasional concert dates).

After a couple of years touring the Northeast club circuit, during a two-week stint in Bermuda in September 1984, Larry lost his voice just one day into the gig due to a combination of air-conditioning and high humidity. After this, he returned to his home in Woodstock and decided to take some time off to allow his voice to heal. At that low point, both Larry and Lance felt that was the likely end of Orleans.

Kelly went on to join Steve Forbert&#x27;s Flying Squirrels in 1981 and did a few shows in the Central New York area with Mick Ronson. He also played with Clarence Clemons and the Red Bank Rockers before joining Meat Loaf&#x27;s Neverland Express in 1983. On October 29, 1984, Wells died while on tour in England with Meat Loaf. After a night of partying, his body was found on the front stairs of a London flat at which he was staying. According to pathologist Dr. Ian West, a post mortem examination revealed &quot;high levels of morphine and cocaine&quot; in Kelly&#x27;s body. &quot;Death came from the drummer inhaling his own vomit &#x27;induced by snorting a mixture of heroin and cocaine&#x27;.&quot;

Wells Kelly&#x27;s untimely death was the catalyst for a reunion of Hall and the Hoppen brothers. John Hall and Bob Leinbach joined Larry in Ithaca, New York, to play at a memorial for Wells (Lance was unable to make the wake due to another commitment). Here, John and Larry decided to continue with Orleans.

In 1985, through the Halls&#x27; connections in Nashville, the reunited lineup of John Hall, Larry Hoppen, Lance Hoppen and Bob Leinbach cut the album &quot;Grown Up Children&quot; (June 1986), with guest appearances from heavyweights like Chet Atkins, Ricky Skaggs, Steve Wariner and Bela Fleck, under the direction of Nashville producer/MCA label chief Tony Brown. Although this album had some playing by John and Larry, most of the instrumental tracks were played by session players, including guitarist Richard Bennett, drummer Larrie London and bassist David Hungate, with the Orleans members providing mostly vocals.

During their Nashville period, the band added bassist Glen Worf and drummer Paul Cook (who was eventually replaced by Tommy Wells) for concert dates, as Lance switched to acoustic guitar.

By late 1987, John and Larry began to realize that, while Nashville was a great place for them as songwriters, it was not so accommodating to Orleans&#x27; career as a band. For the next 2 plus years, Orleans was in a fairly dormant state, again basing their activities back in Woodstock, New York. In early 1989, Lance was offered an opportunity to move to Nashville to work with old friends Kathie Baillie and Michael Bonagura as part of the then-hit RCA act Baillie &amp; the Boys. For a while, he was no longer available for all Orleans&#x27; gigs, so bassist Jim Curtin became Lance&#x27;s sub, as needed, between 1989 and 1994. Meanwhile New York native Peter O&#x27;Brien had been brought in on drums.

Orleans slowly re-established their presence in the Northeast over the next couple of years.

===1990s===

In 1990, Robbie Dupree approached them to make a live album for their growing fan base in Japan. Two shows at Woodstock&#x27;s Bearsville Theater were recorded on October 6 and 7, 1990, as John, Larry and Lance were joined by Bob Leinbach, Paul Branin (sax, guitar) and special guests: Rob Leon, John Sebastian, Jonell Mosser, Artie Traum, Jim Curtin and Lane Hoppen.

The double &quot;Orleans Live&quot; CD set, culled from the two Bearsville Theater shows, came out in Japan in February 1991, followed in April by their first trip to perform in Japan with a lineup of John, Larry, Lance, Leinbach, O&#x27;Brien and Paul Branin. 

In 1993 &quot;Orleans Live: Volume 1&quot;, a single disc CD version, was released; it was the first release on the band&#x27;s own Major Records label. &quot;Live Volume 2&quot;, featuring the rest of the show, was released later.

Still without a traditional label in the U.S., Orleans recorded a new album, &quot;Analog Men&quot;, for the Japanese label Pioneer. It came out there in 1994 and was followed by a return to Japan for more shows.

Later that year, Orleans played at Woodstock 94, which was practically in their backyard, in Saugerties, New York. Bob Leinbach once again rejoined the group for this show and continued to make occasional guest appearances with them throughout the 1990s.

The following year, they toured as an acoustic trio (John, Larry and Lance). While most of the venues were small listening clubs, the real highlight of 1995 was being the opening act on the &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Rockin&quot; tour with Fleetwood Mac, REO Speedwagon and Pat Benatar.

Yet another new album, &quot;Ride&quot;, was recorded at John&#x27;s Saugerties studio and released through an independent label, Dinosaur Entertainment, out of New Orleans. &quot;Ride&quot; emerged in the summer of 1996 and included just a couple of reworkings of the best and still unheard-in-the-US tunes from &quot;Analog Men&quot;. The single &quot;I Am on Your Side&quot; even began to make its way up the charts, but the label proved inexperienced and it folded shortly afterward, killing the song&#x27;s chances for more radio play.

Orleans continued on but in late 1997, decided to take another break. By this time, John was spending more and more time writing in Nashville.

===2000s===

In the early 2000s, Lance was touring with various Nashville-based artists and Larry, who had remarried and started a family, relocated to Florida in 2000 and formed his own Larry Hoppen Band. Since 1997, Larry had also been involved with Voices of Classic Rock, who in 2003 became known as RPM (Rock &amp; Pop Masters) This was a &quot;supergroup&quot; of lead singers of popular 1970s and &#x27;80s groups (Toto, Survivor, Santana, Rainbow, etc.), backed by a single world-class touring band.

In the summer of 2001, nearly four years after their last gig, Orleans (John Hall, Larry, Lance, Peter O&#x27;Brien and Bob Leinbach) reunited on Labor Day weekend to play the Opus 40 Amphitheatre in Saugerties. The band decided to remain together and continue performing. For some shows the band included Peter and Bob. For others, Charlie Morgan (ex-Elton John) became the drummer and Lane Hoppen rejoined the band on keyboards in 2003. By 2005, Charlie and Lane had become permanent in their positions.

The band then picked up Jake Hooker, from Malibu, California, as their new manager.

Orleans continued to play live and record. A studio album, &quot;Dancin&#x27; in the Moonlight&quot;, was recorded in May and June 2004 at Charlie Morgan&#x27;s Thynne Man Studios and first released in October 2005 on the CD Baby label. After that the band&#x27;s lineup was Larry, Lance and Lane Hoppen, Charlie Morgan and the returning Dennis &quot;Fly&quot; Amero (who replaced John Hall as he began his campaign for Congress in 2006) on guitar.

In 2007 Orleans released a live DVD/CD, &quot;We&#x27;re Still Havin&#x27; Fun&quot;, recorded in August 2006 in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, which included both John Hall and &quot;Fly&quot; Amero, as well as the three Hoppen Brothers and drummer Charlie Morgan. Also appearing at this show were special guests: percussionist Manuel Quintana and Charles DeChant (from Hall &amp; Oates) on sax.

During his 2006 bid for a U.S. Congressional seat, Hall appeared with the group on only a few occasions. 

On November 7, 2006 Hall was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives from the state of New York. He was reelected in 2008. During the 2010 midterm elections, a political ad parody supporting John Hall&#x27;s opponent, Nan Hayworth, promoted the fictitious organization &quot;Young Voters for an Orleans Reunion Tour&quot; as a means of voting Hall from Congress. Hayworth defeated Hall in the election. He had served four years (two terms) representing District 19 in the Hudson Valley, between New York City and Albany, New York.

Orleans continued to write, record and perform. In 2010 they had repeat performances in both Washington, DC (in support of DCCC), and in Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands (fundraising for the Nana Baby Home, the orphanage there).

====2010s====

On July 24, 2012 founding band member Larry Hoppen took his own life. Shows planned for the rest of the year were suddenly in jeopardy. But Lance quickly announced that although the band was in deep mourning for Larry, they had decided to finish the year&#x27;s remaining dates (about 8) as best they could. It was at this point that John Hall returned to the live lineup and other alumni joined them on various shows. The first of those was 30 days later, in Deadwood, South Dakota, on August 24, 2012. 

The group then played a free show at SteelStacks in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania on September 2 in memoriam and continued on from there. On September 16, 2012 a memorial gathering of friends and family was held at the Bearsville Theater in Woodstock. Bob Leinbach, among the performers, sang &quot;Forever&quot;, a song he had written with Larry about undying friendship.

Orleans carried on to November 11, 2012 with a lineup consisting of John Hall, Dennis &quot;Fly&quot; Amero, Charlie Morgan, and Lance and Lane Hoppen, ending the year with a memorial show at Mercy Lounge in Nashville, joined by many artist supporters including Jimi Jamison, John Ford Coley, Henry Paul, Jonell Mosser, Kathie Baillie &amp; Michael Bonagura, Pete Huttlinger and Bill Lloyd. Again, it seemed to Lance that this would be the natural ending of Orleans&#x27; 40-year run. But that was not to be.

In the summer of 2013, supported by new manager Len Fico, the band appeared as part of the &quot;Sail Rock Tour&quot;, not only playing a set of their own hits, but providing back up for headliner Christopher Cross and contemporaries Firefall, Gary Wright, John Ford Coley, Robbie Dupree, Player and Al Stewart. &quot;The Last Band Standing&quot; DVD was released in 2013 as well as the double-disc compilation CD, &quot;No More Than You Can Handle: A 40 Year Musical Journey&quot;, featuring several previously unreleased recordings Among them is the title cut, which was the last in which Larry participated as co-writer, singer and player.

In the years following, Orleans continued to tour the US. Charlie Morgan departed in April 2018 and was replaced by drummer Brady Spencer.

In July 2019 John Hall announced his retirement from performing. Daniel &quot;Chip&quot; Martin, a Nashville musician friend of Lance and Brady, then joined Orleans on guitar and vocals. But John&#x27;s &quot;retirement&quot; turned out to be a temporary sabbatical. In March 2020 he was just about to return to touring when everything came to a halt due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===2020s===
In 2020, the band released an in isolation video performance of &quot;No More Than You Can Handle&quot; in memory of Larry Hoppen and as an aid for those who are struggling with the challenges of everyday life during the Covid-19 Pandemic &amp; quarantine. 

During the summer of 2021, Orleans resumed in person appearances and in August of that year, vocalist/guitarist Tom Lane came to fill in for an ill &quot;Fly&quot; Amero, then ended up taking his place permanently.

The band released the Christmas album &quot;New Star Shining&quot; in September of 2021 that featured guest appearances by John Jorgenson, Bill Payne, Dan Dugmore, Andrea Zonn and others.

In March 2022 the band toured as a quartet of Lance, Lane, Brady Spencer and Tom Lane after John Hall retired from the road once again. But shortly afterwards, they were again a quintet when &quot;Fly&quot; Amero rejoined them.

But just before their appearance on a Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Romance Cruise in February 2023, Amero was once again forced to bow out. Nashville guitarist Michael Severs filled in for the cruise, then Tom Lane&#x27;s friend Tony Hooper joined as Fly&#x27;s permanent replacement.

Currently Lance is the only original member still active in the band.

<text>Dwight David Yoakam (born October 23, 1956) is an American singer-songwriter, actor, and filmmaker. He first achieved mainstream attention in 1986 with the release of his debut album &quot;Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.&quot;. Yoakam had considerable success throughout the late 1980s onward, with a total of ten studio albums for Reprise Records. Later projects have been released on Audium (now MNRK Music Group), New West, Warner, and Sugar Hill Records.

His first three albums&quot;Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.&quot;, &quot;Hillbilly Deluxe&quot;, and &quot;Buenas Noches from a Lonely Room&quot;all reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart. Yoakam also has two number-one singles on Hot Country Songs with &quot;Streets of Bakersfield&quot; (a duet with Buck Owens) and &quot;I Sang Dixie&quot;, and twelve additional top-ten hits. He has won two Grammy Awards and one Academy of Country Music award. 1993&#x27;s &quot;This Time&quot; is his most commercially successful album, having been certified triple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Yoakam&#x27;s musical style draws from a wide variety of influences including alternative country, neotraditional country, honky-tonk, rock, and the Bakersfield sound. He is known for his distinctive tenor singing voice and unconventional image. Yoakam writes most of his own songs but has recorded many successful cover songs by a wide range of artists including Johnny Horton, Elvis Presley, Cheap Trick, The Blasters, Lefty Frizzell, and Queen. He has collaborated with Beck, John Mellencamp, k.d. lang, Ralph Stanley, and members of Alison Krauss &amp; Union Station. His albums featured production and lead guitar work by Pete Anderson until the beginning of the 21st century.

As an actor, Yoakam has appeared in the movies &quot;Red Rock West&quot;, &quot;Sling Blade&quot;, &quot;Panic Room&quot;, &quot;The Minus Man&quot;, and &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot;, as well as &quot;South of Heaven, West of Hell&quot;, which he wrote and directed. He also appeared in the TV series &quot;P.S. I Luv U&quot; and &quot;Under the Dome&quot;, as well as the Amazon Prime Video original series &quot;Goliath&quot;.

==Biography==

Dwight David Yoakam was born October 23, 1956, in Pikeville, Kentucky. He is the eldest of three children to Ruth (née Tibbs) and David Yoakam. At the time of Yoakam&#x27;s birth, his father was serving in the United States Army. After David Yoakam was discharged from the Army, the Yoakams moved to Columbus, Ohio. By this point the couple had a second son named Ronald and a daughter named Kimberly. Meanwhile, David supported his family by working at a Westinghouse Electric Corporation factory and later by ownership of a Texaco gas station. Yoakam&#x27;s father had acquired a guitar manufactured by the Kay Musical Instrument Company while in the Army, and gave it to Yoakam after being unable to learn to play it himself. Although Yoakam later broke this guitar, he received another one as a Christmas present while he was in the fourth grade. He also wrote his first song around this point. As a child, Yoakam took influence from the music that his parents listened to on records as well as WMNI, then an AM country music radio station in Columbus. Among these records were compilations by Johnny Cash and Johnny Horton. According to his mother, the family would also sing songs to each other when on road trips to visit Yoakam&#x27;s maternal grandparents. Yoakam himself also stated that he was influenced by rock and roll acts he had seen on television, such as Elvis Presley.

The Yoakam family moved to another neighborhood of Columbus in 1968, where Yoakam attended Northland High School. His mother encouraged all three of her children to join the school&#x27;s band, in which Yoakam played drums. He also attended drama class at Northland High School, which led to him playing the role of Charlie in a production of &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot;. Yoakam later attributed this performance as giving him more confidence performing in front of others. In his senior year of high school, Yoakam and some classmates formed a rock and roll band to compete in the school&#x27;s talent show. The band became popular enough that they began performing at a number of private parties throughout Columbus as The Greaser Band. Yoakam attended Ohio State University, but quickly dropped out in order to focus on his musical career. While playing at a club in Gahanna, Ohio, Yoakam was approached by a man who promised a musical contract but later turned out to be a con artist. Despite this, Yoakam chose to move to Nashville, Tennessee, to continue pursuing a career in country music. He faced difficulty in the Nashville music scene, as his style was more indebted to honky-tonk and bluegrass music at a time when such sounds were not popular compared to country pop and Nashville sound.

Yoakam then moved to Los Angeles, California, at the encouragement of Billy Alves, a former member of the Greaser Band. While he was initially unsuccessful there as well, he met guitarist and record producer Pete Anderson at a Los Angeles bar in 1982. The two became friends when they realized they had common interest in musicians such as Merle Haggard. Anderson also observed that cowpunk and alternative country were popular in California through acts such as Joe Ely, Rank and File, and Lone Justice. By performing at clubs where these acts also performed, Yoakam was thus able to gain further exposure.

==Musical career==
===19841986: &quot;Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.&quot;===

By 1984, Yoakam had written a large number of songs. Anderson then encouraged him to record some of them on an extended play. He also served as producer and lead guitarist on the project, roles he would serve throughout most of Yoakam&#x27;s career. The EP was titled &quot;Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.&quot; and was released through the Oak Records label. It consisted of five of Yoakam&#x27;s original compositions, plus a cover of Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;. Songs from the extended play received airplay on independent radio stations throughout Los Angeles. Later in the year Yoakam was chosen to serve as an opening act for The Blasters. This led to him being discovered by Reprise Records executive Paige Levy, who helped Yoakam sign with the label in 1986. Reprise re-issued &quot;Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.&quot; that year with four more tracks, thus making it his debut album. One of the added tracks was &quot;Bury Me&quot;, a duet with Maria McKee. The first single off the album was a cover of Johnny Horton&#x27;s 1956 single &quot;Honky Tonk Man&quot;. Yoakam&#x27;s rendition of the song charted at number three on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs in mid-1986. The song was even more successful in Canada, reaching the number one position on that nation&#x27;s country music charts then published by &quot;RPM&quot;. &quot;Honky Tonk Man&quot; also received a music video, which in 1986 became the first by a country artist to air on MTV. The album itself reached the number one position on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums.

Two more singles followed, both of which Yoakam wrote himself. These were &quot;Guitars, Cadillacs&quot; and &quot;It Won&#x27;t Hurt&quot;, both of which made Hot Country Songs. Thirteen years after its release, &quot;Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.&quot; was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), honoring shipments of two million copies in the United States. At the 29th Annual Grammy Awards in 1987, the album was nominated for Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance and &quot;Guitars, Cadillacs&quot; was nominated for Best Country Song. The Country Music Association (CMA) also nominated Yoakam for the Horizon Award (now called Best New Artist) and &quot;Honky Tonk Man&quot; for Music Video of the Year. Yoakam also won Top New Male Vocalist at the 1986 Academy of Country Music (ACM) awards.

The album was reviewed favorably. Thom Jurek of AllMusic wrote of the album that it contained influences of Bob Dylan and Bakersfield sound. His review also noted the number of personal songs written by Yoakam himself, as well as the cover versions of &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; and Ray Price&#x27;s &quot;Heartaches by the Number&quot;. Ron Fell of &quot;Gavin Report&quot; compared Yoakam&#x27;s musical image favorably to Buddy Holly and Bruce Springsteen while also stating that Yoakam had &quot;an authenticity to his persona&quot;. Writing for the &quot;Rapid City Journal&quot;, Leonard Running noted the use of fiddle, steel guitar, and Dobro in the production.

===19871989: &quot;Hillbilly Deluxe&quot;, &quot;Buenas Noches from a Lonely Room&quot;, and &quot;Just Lookin&#x27; for a Hit&quot;===
Yoakam&#x27;s second Reprise album &quot;Hillbilly Deluxe&quot; was released in 1987. The album was also led off by a cover song; specifically, Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Little Sister&quot;. After this were Yoakam&#x27;s original compositions &quot;Little Ways&quot; and &quot;Please, Please Baby&quot;, followed by a cover of Lefty Frizzell&#x27;s &quot;Always Late with Your Kisses&quot;. All four of these cuts made top ten on the country music charts between 1987 and early 1988. &quot;Little Ways&quot; was a number one single on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; country charts. Also covered on the album was Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Smoke Along the Track&quot;. One of the other tracks on the album was &quot;Readin&#x27;, Rightin&#x27;, Rt. 23&quot;, an autobiographical song which Yoakam wrote about the towns along U.S. Route 23 in Kentucky near his grandparents&#x27; houses. &quot;Hillbilly Deluxe&quot; was certified platinum for shipments of one million copies, and earned Yoakam another Grammy Award nomination in the category Best Male Country Vocal Performance. It also reached number one on Top Country Albums. Jurek praised the cover songs in his review for AllMusic, where he compared Yoakam&#x27;s vocal phrasing favorably to Merle Haggard. He also noted the use of lap steel guitar and fiddle in Anderson&#x27;s production, as well as Yoakam&#x27;s lyrics on &quot;Readin&#x27;, Rightin&#x27;, Rt. 23&quot;. An uncredited review in &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; magazine stated, &quot;The album features sophisticated, yet fresh country music with rollicking C&amp;W guitar lines, supplemented with Yoakam&#x27;s straight, yearning vocals.&quot;
His third Reprise album was 1988&#x27;s &quot;Buenas Noches from a Lonely Room&quot;. The album was his third and final to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart. Its first two singles were also his only number one entries on Hot Country Songs, both peaking there in 1988. These were a cover of Buck Owens&#x27; &quot;Streets of Bakersfield&quot; which featured Owens on duet vocals, and &quot;I Sang Dixie&quot;. Before &quot;Streets of Bakersfield&quot; was recorded for the album, Yoakam had contacted Owens (who was retired from performing at the time) and convinced him to sing the song on a television special for CBS. The commercial success of the studio version also led to Owens ending his retirement and re-signing with Capitol Records later in the decade. The third single from &quot;Buenas Noches from a Lonely Room&quot; was &quot;I Got You&quot;; while this song reached number five on the country charts, the album&#x27;s title track failed to enter top 40. This album once again featured Maria McKee on backing vocals, along with accompaniment by Tejano accordionist Flaco Jiménez. Also covered on the album were Hank Locklin&#x27;s &quot;Send Me the Pillow You Dream On&quot; and Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;Home of the Blues&quot;. Jurek thought that the album &quot;shows the first signs of beginning to stretch out and be comfortable with his unique approach to hard honky tonk music, Bakersfield-style&quot;. &quot;Buenas Noches from a Lonely Room&quot; and &quot;Streets of Bakersfield&quot; were respectively nominated for Best Male Country Vocal Performance and Best Country Collaboration with Vocals at the 31st Annual Grammy Awards. The latter also received a CMA nomination for Vocal Event of the Year.

Yoakam ended the 1980s with his first greatest hits album, &quot;Just Lookin&#x27; for a Hit&quot;. The album consisted of eight previously released singles and two newly recorded cover songs. These were of The Blasters&#x27; &quot;Long White Cadillac&quot; and The Flying Burrito Brothers&#x27; &quot;Sin City&quot;, the latter of which Yoakam recorded as a duet with k.d. lang. &quot;Long White Cadillac&quot; was issued as a single, reaching number 35 on the country music charts. The &quot;Sin City&quot; cover received a Grammy nomination for Best Country Vocal Collaboration.

===19901992: &quot;If There Was a Way&quot; and soundtrack contributions===

In 1990, Yoakam entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts for the thirteenth time with &quot;Turn It On, Turn It Up, Turn Me Loose&quot;, which peaked at number eleven. This song led off his fourth studio album &quot;If There Was a Way&quot;. The album would account for five more singles between 1990 and 1992: &quot;You&#x27;re the One&quot;, &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Changed Here&quot;, &quot;It Only Hurts When I Cry&quot;, &quot;The Heart That You Own&quot;, and the Patty Loveless duet &quot;Send a Message to My Heart&quot;. Of these, all except &quot;Send a Message to My Heart&quot; were top-20 country hits. &quot;Turn It On, Turn It Up, Turn Me Loose&quot; was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance, Yoakam&#x27;s fourth nomination in that category.

Unlike his previous albums, Yoakam co-wrote several tracks on &quot;If There Was a Way&quot; with other writers. He wrote with Roger Miller on &quot;It Only Hurts When I Cry&quot;, a song to which Miller also contributed backing vocals. Yoakam had met Miller at the Grammy Awards and presented him with the title, and Miller agreed to co-write the song after Yoakam stated he was a fan of Miller&#x27;s music. &quot;Turn It On, Turn It Up, Turn Me Loose&quot; was one of the first successful cuts for Greek-American songwriter Kostas. Record producer Tony Brown had sent Kostas&#x27; demo of the song to Pete Anderson because he thought the song sounded like Yoakam had written it. Because of this, Anderson suggested that Yoakam begin writing songs with Kostas. The two co-wrote both &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Changed Here&quot; and &quot;Send a Message to My Heart&quot; on &quot;If There Was a Way&quot;, leading to further collaborations on subsequent albums. Yoakam had written &quot;You&#x27;re the One&quot; in 1978 about a woman with whom he had ended a relationship. In addition to Roger Miller, backing vocals on the album included Amy Ray (of the Indigo Girls) and bluegrass musician Tim O&#x27;Brien. Alanna Nash of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated the album &quot;A&quot;, stating that it continued on the &quot;hillbilly&quot; themes of his previous albums while also containing more rock and roll influence than its predecessors. Jurek praised the album for rock influences as well, particularly the cover of &quot;Let&#x27;s Work Together&quot;.

Yoakam contributed to two movie soundtracks in 1992. First, he cut two songs for &quot;Falling from Grace&quot;, the 1992 directorial debut of rock singer John Mellencamp. Yoakam performed Mellencamp&#x27;s composition &quot;Common Day Man&quot;; the two also joined Joe Ely, John Prine, and James McMurtry on the track &quot;Sweet Suzanne&quot;. Credited to Buzzin&#x27; Cousins, this song charted on Hot Country Songs for five weeks in early 1992. It also accounted for Yoakam&#x27;s second CMA nomination in the category of Vocal Event of the Year. Later in the year, Yoakam covered Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; for the soundtrack of &quot;Honeymoon in Vegas&quot;. This rendition charted on Hot Country Songs by year&#x27;s end. In addition to these, he re-recorded &quot;Miner&#x27;s Prayer&quot;, a track from &quot;Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.&quot;, as a duet with bluegrass singer Ralph Stanley on the latter&#x27;s 1992 album &quot; Saturday Night &amp; Sunday Morning&quot;. This track was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Country Vocal Collaboration. Finally, Yoakam released an album titled &quot;La Croix d&#x27;Amour&quot; for the European market in 1992. This consisted mainly of selections from other albums, as well as previously unreleased cover songs.

===19931996: &quot;This Time&quot;, &quot;Dwight Live&quot;, and &quot;Gone&quot;===
For his next studio album, 1993&#x27;s &quot;This Time&quot;, Yoakam wrote either by himself or in collaboration with Kostas. The only exception was the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Lonely Yet&quot;, which Kostas co-wrote with James House. This song peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts, while also topping the American &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; country music charts and Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; country charts. It won Yoakam the Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 1993, his first win from that association. &quot;This Time&quot; charted four more singles between 1993 and 1994. First were &quot;A Thousand Miles from Nowhere&quot; and &quot;Fast as You&quot;, which both achieved peaks of number two as well. The latter also became Yoakam&#x27;s first entry on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at 70. After these were &quot;Try Not to Look So Pretty&quot; and &quot;Pocket of a Clown&quot;, which were less successful on the charts. Of the album, Anderson told &quot;Gavin Report&quot; that &quot;It&#x27;s really the first record we&#x27;ve made where we just took all the boundaries down&quot;, while Yoakam himself said that &quot;I felt that my musical statements on the preceding albums were valid, but that they were complete statements and there was no need to further articulate them. It was time to allow my music latitude.&quot; He cited the track &quot;Home for Sale&quot; as an example, describing it as a &quot;stone country&quot; lyric backed by a Hammond organ, an instrument not commonly used in country. Jurek noted influences of doo-wop in &quot;Pocket of a Clown&quot; and of Roy Orbison in &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Lonely Yet&quot;. In July 1994, Yoakam began the This Time Tour, a 75-city tour which featured Alison Krauss and Union Station as an opening act. The Country Music Association nominated &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Lonely Yet&quot; for Single of the Year in 1993, and Yoakam himself in the category Male Vocalist of the Year in 1994. The album achieved his highest RIAA certification, for triple-platinum in 1996.

Yoakam released two albums in 1995. The first was &quot;Dwight Live&quot;, a live album recorded in July 1994 in San Francisco. Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote of this album that &quot;nothing on the album improves on the original recorded versions&quot;, while Tony Scherman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; thought the album was &quot;beautifully paced&quot; and showed Yoakam&#x27;s strengths as a vocalist. The album was certified gold in 1996. His other release for 1995 was the studio album &quot;Gone&quot;. Yoakam wrote the entire album, collaborating with Kostas on two songs. Among the backing vocalists were Carl Jackson, Jim Lauderdale, Joy Lynn White, and The Rembrandts. &quot;Nothing&quot;, one of the collaborations with Kostas, was selected as the lead single and charted at number 20 on Hot Country Songs in 1995. The song&#x27;s B-side &quot;Gone (That&#x27;ll Be Me)&quot; and &quot;Sorry You Asked?&quot; were released as singles as well, though neither reached top 40. Jurek thought that individual tracks displayed influences of rhythm and blues, mariachi, Tejano music, and psychedelic rock. Jeffrey B. Remz of Country Standard Time wrote that &quot;Gone&quot; was &quot;a critically received album, which did not do boffo numbers because Yoakam received very little airplay for what was probably his most musically diverse album. And in some parts of the country, his tour did not draw crowds either.&quot;

===19971998: &quot;Under the Covers&quot;, &quot;Come On Christmas&quot;, &quot;A Long Way Home&quot;===
Yoakam&#x27;s next release for Reprise was 1997&#x27;s &quot;Under the Covers&quot;, an album composed entirely of cover songs. Yoakam and Anderson had begun recording songs for this project prior to &quot;Gone&quot;, while other selections previously appeared on &quot;La Croix d&#x27;Amour&quot;. The project accounted for only one single in a rendition of The Everly Brothers&#x27; &quot;Claudette&quot;. Bluegrass musician Ralph Stanley played banjo on a cover of The Clash&#x27;s &quot;Train in Vain&quot;, while Sheryl Crow sang duet vocals on a cover of Sonny &amp; Cher&#x27;s &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Go&quot;. Jurek wrote of this album, &quot;While this set is not perfect, it&#x27;s still damn fine and warrants repeated listens to come to grips with Yoakam&#x27;s visionary ambition.&quot; Remz praised the covers of Glen Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Wichita Lineman&quot; and &quot;Train in Vain&quot; in particular, but criticized the cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Things We Said Today&quot;. After this was an album of Christmas music titled &quot;Come On Christmas&quot;, released later in the year. Yoakam wrote the title track and &quot;Santa Can&#x27;t Stay&quot;, while the rest of the album largely consisted of traditional Christmas songs such as &quot;Away in a Manger&quot; and &quot;Silver Bells&quot;. Thom Owens of AllMusic wrote that the album contained &quot;high-spirited, entertaining country-rockers that may not add anything new to Yoakam&#x27;s catalog, but they make the record an enjoyable holiday album.&quot;

Between 1995 and 1997, Yoakam received three consecutive Grammy nominations in the category of Best Male Country Vocal Performance. The songs nominated in this category were &quot;Pocket of a Clown&quot;, &quot;A Thousand Miles from Nowhere&quot;, and &quot;Nothing&quot;. He also received three consecutive nominations for Best Country Album between 1996 and 1998, with the nominations going to &quot;Dwight Live&quot;, &quot;Gone&quot;, and &quot;Under the Covers&quot;. After these was his next studio album of original content, 1998&#x27;s &quot;A Long Way Home&quot;. Yoakam wrote the entire project by himself, making it his first not to have any co-writers or cover songs. The album charted two singles in &quot;Things Change&quot; and &quot;These Arms&quot;. This album also featured Ralph Stanley, this time as a duet partner on &quot;Traveler&#x27;s Lantern&quot;. Brian Steinberg of Country Standard Time thought that the album was &quot;back to basics&quot; and comparable to Yoakam&#x27;s releases in the 1980s, stating that &quot;This isn&#x27;t Yoakam&#x27;s most innovative work, but it contains enough moments to make it worth attention.&quot; Also in 1998, Yoakam funded a charity album for release on Little Dog Records, a label which his then-producer and guitarist Pete Anderson owned. This album was titled &quot;Will Sing for Food&quot; and featured other artists recording renditions of Yoakam&#x27;s songs. Among the artists contributing were Sara Evans, Mandy Barnett, Kim Richey, Gillian Welch, and David Ball. Nash contrasted these two albums in a double review, calling &quot;A Long Way Home&quot; &quot;a fresh, dynamic set, updating his trademark Bakersfield-does-L.A. sound without sacrificing his honky-tonk roots&quot; while stating that &quot;Will Sing for Food&quot; had &quot;stunningly original interpretations&quot;. Steinberg gave the latter a mixed review, praising the contributions of Bonnie Bramlett and Scott Joss while considering other cuts on the album too similar in sound to Yoakam&#x27;s originals.

===19981999: &quot;Last Chance for a Thousand Years: Dwight Yoakam&#x27;s Greatest Hits from the 90&#x27;s&quot;===

In 1998, Columbia Records released &quot;A Tribute to Tradition&quot;, a multi-artist tribute album to 1960s and 1970s country music. Yoakam was one of several artists featured on the album&#x27;s closing track &quot;Same Old Train&quot;, an original composition by Marty Stuart. The track featured twelve other country musicians, including Earl Scruggs, Merle Haggard, Clint Black, and Randy Travis. It charted for five weeks on Hot Country Songs in late 1998. The song won Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards, thus giving Yoakam his second win from the organization. It was also nominated for CMA Vocal Event of the Year.

Yoakam ended the decade with his second greatest-hits package, &quot;Last Chance for a Thousand Years: Dwight Yoakam&#x27;s Greatest Hits from the 90&#x27;s&quot;. In addition to tracks from his 1990s Reprise albums, the compilation included three new songs. These were covers of Queen&#x27;s &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; and Waylon Jennings&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;ll Go Back to Her&quot; and the new song &quot;Thinking About Leaving&quot;, which Yoakam wrote with Rodney Crowell. The cover of &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; served as the album&#x27;s lead single, peaking at 12 on the country charts and 64 on the Hot 100. It was also his final number one on the Canadian country music charts published by &quot;RPM&quot; before that publication closed in 2000. &quot;Thinking About Leaving&quot; was also issued as a single, but did not enter the country music top 40. In 2000, &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance.

===200001: &quot;dwightyoakamacoustic.net&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Sounds Today&quot;===
Yoakam&#x27;s tenure with Reprise Records ended with a pair of albums both released in 2000. The first was &quot;dwightyoakamacoustic.net&quot;, composed entirely of acoustic recordings with just Yoakam&#x27;s vocal and acoustic guitar. The only exception was a re-recording of &quot;Guitars, Cadillacs&quot;, which Yoakam performed &quot;a cappella&quot;. Yoakam said that he was inspired to do such an album due to the success of similar acoustic renditions in his concerts. He had originally planned to release the album through his website until representatives of Reprise Records thought the album had sales potential. The album itself had minimalistic packaging as well, consisting solely of a sticker with the album&#x27;s name on the front of an otherwise-clear CD case. Steve Huey of AllMusic thought that the album&#x27;s minimalism allowed a greater focus on Yoakam&#x27;s vocal interpretation than previous albums.

His other release in 2000 was &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Sounds Today&quot;. The album accounted for two charted singles in &quot;What Do You Know About Love&quot; and a cover of Cheap Trick&#x27;s &quot;I Want You to Want Me&quot;. Yoakam co-wrote with Buck Owens on three tracks: &quot;The Sad Side of Town&quot;, &quot;Alright, I&#x27;m Wrong&quot;, and &quot;I Was There&quot;, the latter two of which were also recorded as duets with him. Although the two had previously sung together on &quot;Streets of Bakersfield&quot;, Owens rejected further collaborations throughout the 1990s as he considered Yoakam &quot;too young&quot;, but ultimately agreed to collaborate again when the two met at a concert in 1999. Writing for AllMusic, Hal Horowitz thought the Owens collaborations showed Yoakam&#x27;s continued influence of the Bakersfield sound of which Owens was a part. He also praised the guitar work of Pete Anderson and compared Yoakam&#x27;s lyrical style to that of Hank Williams. Scherman was less favorable, considering the material &quot;forgettable&quot; despite describing Anderson&#x27;s guitar work with favor. Yoakam received his final CMA nomination in 2001, when that institution nominated &quot;Alright, I&#x27;m Wrong&quot; for Vocal Event of the Year. At the end of his contract with Reprise, parent company Warner Records issued a box set album titled &quot;Reprise Please Baby: The Warner Bros. Years&quot;. The package consisted of 89 tracks from Yoakam&#x27;s Reprise catalog, including previously unreleased songs and early demos. Also included was a duet with Kelly Willis on a cover of George Jones and Tammy Wynette&#x27;s &quot;Golden Ring&quot;.

===200204: &quot;Population Me&quot; and compilations===
Yoakam spent much of 2001 and 2002 touring with Brooks &amp; Dunn. He also founded a new record label called Electrodisc after his contract with Reprise expired. The label partnered with Audium Records (now MNRK Music Group) for distribution. His first Audium release was 2003&#x27;s &quot;Population Me&quot;. This album charted two singles, both of which were covers: Gregg Henry&#x27;s &quot;The Back of Your Hand&quot; and Mike Stinson&#x27;s &quot;The Late Great Golden State&quot;. Also covered on this album was Burt Bacharach&#x27;s &quot;Trains and Boats and Planes&quot;. Timothy B. Schmit provided backing vocals on &quot;The Late Great Golden State&quot;, while Willie Nelson sang duet vocals on &quot;If Teardrops Were Diamonds&quot;. Jurek found influences of Jackson Browne, the Eagles, and Chuck Berry in the album&#x27;s sound. Messinger wrote of the album that &quot;the complex, innovative sound he and Anderson have developed certainly merits repeated exploration.&quot;

Between 2003 and 2004, Yoakam released three more compilations of covers albums to fulfill contractual obligations with his labels. The first was 2003&#x27;s &quot;In Others&#x27; Words&quot; on Reprise. This consisted entirely of cover songs mostly from movie soundtracks and tribute albums to which Yoakam contributed. The oldest track was a cover of the Grateful Dead&#x27;s &quot;Truckin&#x27;&quot;, which Yoakam cut in 1991. Jurek wrote that the compilation was &quot;far from a stellar set but does fill in the gaps nicely.&quot; Rhino Records released a greatest-hits package titled &quot;The Very Best of Dwight Yoakam&quot; in 2004. This compilation was certified gold after its release. Erlewine thought that while the album did not contain many of his earlier songs, it otherwise showed the range of his styles and would have potential appeal to fans who preferred his more rock-influenced cuts such as the covers of &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; and &quot;I Want You to Want Me&quot;. His third and final compilation was &quot;Dwight&#x27;s Used Records&quot; on Audium also in 2004. Among the collaborators on this project were Heather Myles, Deana Carter, and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Artists covered included John Prine&#x27;s &quot;Paradise&quot;, ZZ Top&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Bad, I&#x27;m Nationwide&quot;, and Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;Understand Your Man&quot;. Country Standard Time writer Eli Messinger thought that, by drawing from a decade&#x27;s worth of material, the album showed new variety in Yoakam&#x27;s style over his traditional studio albums.

===20052007: &quot;Blame the Vain&quot; and &quot;Dwight Sings Buck&quot;===
In 2005, Yoakam signed with New West Records, an Americana music label based out of California. His first release for the label was 2005&#x27;s &quot;Blame the Vain&quot;. It was also Yoakam&#x27;s first credit as a producer, as he had ended his relationship with Pete Anderson in 2004. At the time, former RCA Records artist Keith Gattis had taken over as Yoakam&#x27;s guitarist and bandleader. Yoakam said that he had contacted a number of producers until Gattis encouraged him to produce by himself. New West partnered with Columbia Records to release two singles to radio. These were &quot;Intentional Heartache&quot; and the title track, which both made the lower regions of the country charts in 2005 and accounted for Yoakam&#x27;s last appearance there. In the book &quot;Dwight Yoakam: A Thousand Miles from Nowhere&quot;, Don McLeese thought that Anderson&#x27;s absence gave the album &quot;an unbridled lack of restraint&quot;, citing the hard rock sound and spoken-word coda of &quot;Intentional Heartache&quot; as examples. Ray Waddell of &quot;Billboard&quot; also noted a &quot;hard-charging&quot; sound to the album, comparing various tracks to Elvis Presley. Rhino Records re-issued &quot;Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc, Etc.&quot; in 2006 to honor the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary. This re-issue included previously unreleased demos and live tracks, along with liner notes written by Yoakam.

After Buck Owens&#x27; death in 2006, Yoakam began performing covers of his songs in concert. This culminated in his 2007 album &quot;Dwight Sings Buck&quot;, composed entirely of Owens covers. Yoakam recorded the project with his touring band, which at the time included then-former Mavericks member Eddie Perez on lead guitar. Yoakam stated that he and the band listened to Owens&#x27; originals to draw inspiration from the recordings. Among the songs chosen were &quot;Act Naturally&quot;, &quot;Crying Time&quot;, and &quot;Close Up the Honky Tonks&quot;, the last of which served as the lead single. A review in AllMusic was favorable, stating that &quot;He doesn&#x27;t set out to imitate Owens&#x27; style or delivery, but he does capture the essence of each song, playing them as Buck intended: no frills, no foolin&#x27; around&quot;.

===20082020: &quot;3 Pears&quot;, &quot;Second Hand Heart&quot;, and &quot;Swimmin&#x27; Pools, Movie Stars...&quot;===

Yoakam performed at the CMA Music Festival in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2008, where he was joined by Faith Hill. This was Yoakam&#x27;s first appearance at the event in over 20 years. He otherwise performed very few concerts in 2009 and 2010, citing the Great Recession and the rise of digital music distribution as a reason behind the slower pace of his career at the time. Despite this, he still stated that he planned to continue releasing albums. In July 2011, he re-signed with Warner for his next album, 2012&#x27;s &quot;3 Pears&quot;. The album included production from rock musician Beck on two tracks. Upon release, it became Yoakam&#x27;s highest entry on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, reaching number 18. Mikael Wood of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; thought the album displayed a &quot;softer side&quot; than Yoakam&#x27;s previous efforts. Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote of the album, &quot;Yoakam has surprised by digging deeper into every one of his obsessions, creating a record that captures the careening, adventurous spirit of the &#x27;60s without ever feeling doggedly retro. It&#x27;s as fresh as any music he&#x27;s ever made, and one of his very best albums.&quot;

His next Warner album was 2015&#x27;s &quot;Second Hand Heart&quot;. It reached the number two position on Top Country Albums after its release, his highest peak on that chart since &quot;Buenas Noches from a Lonely Room&quot; in 1988. It consisted almost entirely of original songs written by Yoakam, except a cover of the standard &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; and Anthony Crawford&#x27;s &quot;V&#x27;s of Birds&quot;. Erlewine found influences of The Beatles, Buck Owens, and cowpunk in the album&#x27;s arrangements. Ann Powers of NPR&#x27;s First Listen shared a similar opinion of the album, also praising the &quot;brightness&quot; of its sound.

In 2016 Yoakam was contacted by a label executive of Sugar Hill Records, who wanted him to record a bluegrass music album for them. This album, &quot;Swimmin&#x27; Pools, Movie Stars...&quot;, was released that same year. It mostly comprises re-recordings of previous songs in his career, including &quot;Guitars, Cadillacs&quot; and &quot;Please, Please Baby&quot;. Yoakam co-produced with Jon Randall and Gary Paczosa. The album included musical accompaniment by Alison Krauss &amp; Union Station members Adam Steffey and Barry Bales on mandolin and upright bass respectively. Also contributing were guitarist Bryan Sutton, fiddler Stuart Duncan, and banjoist Scott Vestal. In addition to his own material, Yoakam covered Prince&#x27;s &quot;Purple Rain&quot;. Yoakam chose to cover the song the day Prince died, as he had seen the news of the musician&#x27;s death on television prior to recording. Chuck Dauphin of Sounds Like Nashville thought the album brought out the bluegrass influences already present in such songs as &quot;What I Don&#x27;t Know&quot;. Deming called the album &quot;a stylistic detour for Dwight Yoakam, but its execution sums up many of his greatest strengths as an artist&quot;. Also in 2016, Yoakam released covers of The Monkees&#x27; &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Gonna Be Another Day&quot; and Johnny Rivers&#x27; &quot;Mountain of Love&quot; on limited edition vinyl through Third Man Records, a label owned by Jack White.

===2017present: Bakersfield Beat and &quot;Brighter Days&quot;===
In 2017, Yoakam covered &quot;Wichita Lineman&quot; at a tribute ceremony to songwriter Jimmy Webb held at Carnegie Hall. In 2018, Yoakam was selected by SiriusXM satellite radio to curate his own show, Bakersfield Beat, on that company&#x27;s Prime Country channel. The success of this led to Yoakam receiving his own channel also named Bakersfield Beat, in which he plays his own songs as well as those in the genres of Bakersfield sound, cowpunk, and country rock. In 2022, he started the LSD Tour with Lucinda Williams and Steve Earle. He also performed a concert with Old Crow Medicine Show in 2022 to honor the 30th anniversary of &quot;Hillbilly Deluxe&quot;.

Yoakam announced in November 2024 the release of his first studio album in nine years, &quot;Brighter Days&quot;. The album is his first for Via Records/Thirty Tigers and it includes the single &quot;I&#x27;ll Pay the Price&quot;. Also released in advance of the album was a duet with Post Malone titled &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know How to Say Goodbye (Bang Bang Boom Boom)&quot;. The project, produced by Yoakam, also includes covers of Cake&#x27;s &quot;Bound Away&quot; and the Byrds&#x27;s &quot;Time Between&quot;.

==Acting==
Yoakam holds several acting roles in both film and television. One of his first was a recurring role in the 1991 CBS crime drama &quot;P.S. I Luv U&quot;. He also had a role in the 1993 movie &quot;Red Rock West&quot;. In 1994 Yoakum portrayed rancher Mac Brazel in the made-for-TV movie &quot;Roswell&quot;. In 1996, actor-director Billy Bob Thornton cast Yoakam as the character Doyle Hargraves in the film &quot;Sling Blade&quot;. Yoakam had been recommended the role by his manager, and told the website Country Daily in 2016 that &quot;Sling Blade&quot; was the first role in his acting career which he thought would have a lasting impact. Yoakam and the rest of the film&#x27;s cast were nominated in 1997 for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. He appeared in the 1998 Richard Linklater film &quot;The Newton Boys&quot;, and wrote most of the songs for his album &quot;A Long Way Home&quot; at this film&#x27;s shooting locations throughout Austin, Texas. In 1999, Yoakam and Sheryl Crow appeared in the thriller &quot;The Minus Man&quot;.

A year later he co-wrote, directed, and starred in a Western film titled &quot;South of Heaven, West of Hell&quot;. He also composed a soundtrack of the same name. The movie was a financial failure, leading to many of its crew members filing claims against Yoakam in small claims court. In addition, Yoakam fired Pete Anderson from his touring band in 2002 as a means of recouping the finances lost by this movie. Zac Johnson of AllMusic criticized the soundtrack for including snippets of film dialogue between tracks, although he praised the individual songs and their inclusion of collaborators such as Bekka Bramlett, Mick Jagger, and Billy Gibbons.

In 2002, Yoakam had a role in the David Fincher movie &quot;Panic Room&quot;. Before the movie&#x27;s release, he told the Associated Press that he did not consider acting significantly different from recording music because both roles were &quot;fragmented&quot; and required &quot;repetition of performance&quot;. Between 2005 and 2006, he also appeared in the movies &quot;Bandidas&quot;, &quot;The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada&quot;, and &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot;. In 2008, he appeared in &quot;Four Christmases&quot; as Pastor Phil. In 2014, Yoakam had a recurring role in season two of the CBS science fiction series &quot;Under the Dome&quot;. He also reunited with Thornton for season one of the Amazon Prime Video original series &quot;Goliath&quot;.

==Musical styles and influences==
Yoakam&#x27;s style is defined by a variety of influences both inside and outside country music. These influences include rockabilly, honky-tonk, neotraditional country, Bakersfield sound, and country rock. Colin Larkin wrote in &quot;The Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music&quot; that Yoakam&#x27;s music showed influences of &quot;the honky-tonk country music of Buck Owens and Lefty Frizzell&quot; and &quot;a distinct antipathy toward the Nashville pop/country scene.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated that &quot;With his stripped-down approach to traditional honky tonk and Bakersfield country, Dwight Yoakam helped return country music to its roots in the late &#x27;80s.&quot; Erlewine also noted that Yoakam&#x27;s fanbase typically consisted of people who listened to roots rock and rock and roll. Thom Jurek of AllMusic thought that Pete Anderson&#x27;s electric guitar work was also an important part of his sound, comparing such work to Don Rich of Buck Owens&#x27; backing band The Buckaroos. Jurek also thought that the prominent uses of electric guitar and Hammond organ were examples of Yoakam&#x27;s rock influences.

Yoakam describes his own songwriting style as &quot;fragmented&quot;. He told Al Caudell of &quot;American Songwriter&quot; that he usually wrote songs by coming up with a melody and then determining the intended mood. From there, he said he would come up with a &quot;thesis&quot; for the song. He also stated that he preferred not to write in a linear fashion, as he thought writing a song in one sitting would cause him to feel creatively burnt out. He also said that memories of his childhood were influential in his songwriting style, particularly in the bluegrass music to which he listened; he told &quot;American Songwriter&quot; that he enjoyed the &quot;irony that&#x27;s always been part of bluegrass in that it sets melodic, lilting melodies and upbeat tempos with the most tragic lyrics.&quot;

Cyndi Hoelzle of &quot;Gavin Report&quot; noted Yoakam&#x27;s appeal outside traditional country music, stating in 1993 that &quot;[h]is records sold across the board-to middle-aged Stonewall Jackson fans and to young punk rockers who&#x27;d seen Dwight do his thing in L.A., opening shows for Los Lobos and the Violent Femmes.&quot; Richard Cromelin of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that Yoakam&#x27;s musical image was that of a &quot;brooding, intensely private figure driven by restless ambition and an edgy intellectuality more commonly found in rock stars.&quot; In the same article, Yoakam stated that &quot;I found out early that one of the ways I was able to make contact was through musical expression.&quot; Similarly, he told &quot;Gavin Report&quot; in 1993 that &quot;My nature is to be absolutely dissectively analytic. But with songwriting I have to leave it in a place that&#x27;s not.&quot; Al Caudell of &quot;American Songwriter&quot; called Yoakam &quot;a bluntly outspoken advocate of hardcore honky-tonk music&quot;. Yoakam received negative attention from the Nashville music scene early in his career due to his constant criticism of the genre. Among his criticisms were Columbia Records dropping Johnny Cash and MTV refusing to play country music videos. Of these criticisms, he later stated that &quot;I learned a couple albums in... that my opinions and observations on the industry were not pertinent to what I needed to do as an artist, so I just really began to focus solely on what I was doing at the time.&quot;

Yoakam&#x27;s musical image is also defined by his typical outfits when onstage. Colin Larkin of &quot;The Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music&quot; wrote that &quot;like Don Williams and others, he retains the traditional Stetson hat.&quot; Alanna Nash wrote in a review of &quot;If There Was a Way&quot; that &quot;When Dwight Yoakam first came on the scene, with his hip retro-attitude, concha-studded jeans, and music that often grazed the edge of rock &amp; roll, it was hard to tell whether the California cowboy was for real. The verdict was clear by his third album, &quot;Buenas Noches from a Lonely Room&quot;, whose key cycle of songs is a classic murder tale that echoes the pride, heartbreak, betrayal, and vengeance of the age-old hillbilly experience.&quot; Al Caudell of &quot;American Songwriter&quot; noted that Yoakam frequently wore &quot;ripped jeans&quot;. Darryl Smyers of the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; wrote that &quot;With his absurdly large hat and Flying Burrito Brothers fashion sense, Yoakam was championed by a surprising mix of punks, rockabilly hounds, and hard-core honky-tonkers.&quot;

Leonard Running of the &quot;Rapid City Journal&quot; referred to Yoakam&#x27;s singing style as a &quot;plaintive, yodel-edged voice&quot;. An uncredited review of &quot;Gone&quot; in &quot;No Depression&quot; stated, &quot;His voice is pure and sweet, but a precise tool. Only rarely, like on &#x27;Try Not to Look So Pretty&#x27;...does it really fall down into an emotional fit.&quot; J. D. Considine of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; wrote of Yoakam&#x27;s singing voice that it was a &quot;high, lonesome twang&quot; and a &quot;sweetly nasal tenor&quot;. Similarly, the editors of &quot;The Encyclopedia of Country Music&quot; described Yoakam as having a &quot;twangy tenor... simply too spellbinding for country radio to ignore.&quot; These editors also thought that Yoakam was more able to break through into mainstream country music than contemporaries such as Lyle Lovett and Steve Earle because &quot;mainstream country has found it easier to digest distorted guitars than ironic lyrics&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1992, Yoakam began dating actress Sharon Stone. He appeared alongside her at that year&#x27;s Academy Awards ceremony. This encounter led to both of them receiving media attention from tabloids, along with rumors from fans that songs on &quot;This Time&quot; were about Stone. Yoakam denied these rumors and stated that the two dated for five weeks. Yoakam met MTV personality Karen Duffy at a party in 1994 and began dating soon afterward. The two ended their relationship in 1996. Yoakam married Emily Joyce on May 4, 2020, in Santa Monica, California. Because their wedding occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, only ten guests were in attendance. The couple had their first child on August 16, 2020.

===Legal issues===
After a long tenure as Yoakam&#x27;s bandleader and producer, Pete Anderson filed a lawsuit against him in 2004, stating that he had breached an oral contract by failing to perform a number of concert dates in mid-2002. The lawsuit claimed that by failing to perform these concerts, Yoakam had cost Anderson over $44,000 in salary. Yoakam and Anderson settled the lawsuit out of court, with the former stating that some of the financial issues stemming from these concerts were due to money lost in the commercial failure of &quot;South of Heaven, West of Hell&quot;. This financial dispute also ended the two&#x27;s musical partnership, with Anderson saying that Yoakam &quot;didn&#x27;t want [him] around anymore&quot;. Anderson said in a 2011 interview with &quot;Style Weekly&quot; that he still respected Yoakam&#x27;s artistry but had no intention of working with him again.

Yoakam filed a lawsuit against Warner Music in 2021 when the label withdrew several of his songs from streaming services due to expiration of contract. He claimed that the label was denying his reclamation of copyright toward the songs. The dispute was resolved in February 2022 and the songs re-appeared on streaming services soon afterward.

<text>Tax Avoiders is a single-player video game for the Atari 2600 released in 1982. It was conceived by Darrell Wagner at Dunhill Electronics; he was billed on the packaging as a &quot;Licensed Tax Consultant and former IRS Revenue Agent&quot;. The game was developed by Todd Clark Holm, &quot;an investment advisor, registered with the S.E.C.&quot; The game was designed by John Simonds and published by American Videogame.

==Gameplay==
The object of &quot;Tax Avoiders&quot; is to help &quot;John Q&quot; become a millionaire within one game year by collecting income and avoiding taxes. There are two alternating game phases. In one, the player moves around the screen, collecting dollar bills and avoiding red tape; this represents maximizing income for the quarter. At the end of the quarter, the other phase has the player move around to manage his investments while another sprite oscillates between an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agent, a certified public accountant (CPA), and an investment advisor. If the player is caught by the IRS agent, he is audited, and always loses the audit, which takes 50% of his income. If he encounters the CPA, he is charged a fee but gains new tax-sheltered investment options. If he encounters an investment advisor, he can maximize his tax-sheltered investment returns.

<doc id="169979" wikidata="Q366584" url="?curid=169979" title="George Strait">
<text>George Harvey Strait Sr. (born May 18, 1952) is an American country music singer, songwriter, actor, and music producer. 

Strait has sold over 120 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He holds the RIAA record for most certified albums by any artist, with 33 different albums that are certified platinum or gold. Considering singles and albums, he has a total of 20 multi-platinum, 33 platinum and 24 gold certification. According to the RIAA, Strait is the 12th best-selling album recording artist in the United States overall selling over 70 million records across the United States.

He is credited for pioneering the neotraditional country style in the 1980s, famed for his authentic cowboy image and roots-oriented sound at a time when the Nashville music industry was dominated by country pop crossover acts. Given his influence on the genre, Strait has been nicknamed the &quot;King of Country Music&quot; by writers and music critics. He currently holds the record for the most number one songs on all charts by an artist, in any genre of music.

Strait&#x27;s career in country music began performing with his band Ace in the Hole in Texas honky-tonks in the 1970s, recording tracks for the Houston-based independent record label D Records. Strait&#x27;s success began when his first single &quot;Unwound&quot; was a hit in 1981, helping introduce the neotraditional movement to the mainstream. During the 1980s, seven of his albums reached number one on the country charts. In the 2000s, he was named Artist of the Decade by the Academy of Country Music, elected into the Country Music Hall of Fame, and won his first Grammy award for the album &quot;Troubadour&quot;. Strait was named CMA Entertainer of the Year in 1989, 1990 and 2013, and ACM Entertainer of the Year in 1990 and 2014. He has been nominated for more CMA and ACM awards and has more wins in both categories than any other artist.

Strait has been known for his touring career beginning when he designed a 360-degree configuration and introduced festival style tours. His final concert for The Cowboy Rides Away Tour at AT&amp;T Stadium drew 104,793 people, setting a new record for the largest indoor concert in North America. In mid-2024, Strait set the record for the largest ticketed concert for a single act in U.S. history, with over 110,905 people at Kyle Field in College Station, Texas. He additionally was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the same year for its class of 2025.
==Early life==
George Harvey Strait Sr. was born on May 18, 1952, in Poteet, Texas, to John Byron Strait Sr. (January 11, 1922 – June 4, 2013), and Doris Jean Couser (June 26, 1930 – January 30, 2010). 

He grew up in nearby Pearsall, in Frio County, where his father was a junior high school mathematics teacher and the owner of a cattle ranch outside of Big Wells, Texas. The family worked at the ranch on the weekends and in the summers. When George was in the fourth grade, his father and mother were divorced, and his mother moved away with his sister, Pency. George and his brother John &quot;Buddy&quot; Jr. (1950–2009) grew up with their father. For most of his early life, George was in ranching alongside his older brother Buddy and his father John.

Strait began his musical career while attending Pearsall High School, where he performed in a rock and roll garage band, known as the Stoics, taking most of their influence and inspiration from the Beatles and other British Invasion-era rock groups. &quot;The Beatles were big,&quot; Strait confirmed. &quot;I listened to them a lot and that whole bunch of groups that were popular then.&quot; He performed in other rock bands during his high school tenure. His musical preference soon turned to country with singers Hank Thompson, Lefty Frizzell, Merle Haggard, George Jones, Bob Wills, Hank Williams, and Frank Sinatra influencing his style. Strait did not tune in to and listen to country music radio often as a youth, usually selecting the news and the farmer&#x27;s report instead. His introduction to country music came mostly by way of live performances, which according to Strait could be heard in every town in Texas.

==Marriage and military service==
He eloped with his high school sweetheart, Norma Voss after their high school graduation. The couple initially married in Mexico on December 4, 1971. In the same year, he enlisted in the United States Army as an infantryman. While stationed at Schofield Barracks adjacent to Wahiawa, Hawaii, as part of the 25th Infantry Division, George auditioned and began performing with an Army-sponsored country music band, Rambling Country, which also played off-base under the name Santee. On October 6, 1972, while still in Hawaii, George and Norma had their first child, Jenifer. He served in the United States Army from 1971 to 1975 and ultimately attained the rank of corporal.

==Higher education==
After George Strait was honorably discharged from the Army in 1975, he enrolled at Southwest Texas State University (now Texas State University) in San Marcos. He graduated with a degree in agriculture. He was also presented an honorary doctoral degree by his alma mater–Texas State University in San Marcos–in a private ceremony on May 26, 2006. Strait is a loyal alumnus of the college; in 1985 he established an endowment fund for the development and operation of the Freeman Ranch for agricultural purposes, land and wildlife management, and gifts of scholarships.
==Music career==
===1970s===

During his college years, Strait joined the country band Stoney Ridge, answering a flyer the band posted around campus looking for a new vocalist. Strait renamed the group the Ace in the Hole Band, and quickly became the lead; they began to perform at different honky-tonks and bars around south and central Texas, traveling as far east as Huntsville and Houston. They gained a regional following and opened for national acts such as The Texas Playboys and Asleep at the Wheel. Soon his band was given the opportunity to record several Strait-penned singles, including &quot;That Don&#x27;t Change The Way I Feel About You&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Go On Dying Like This&quot; for the Houston-based D Records independent label. However, the songs never achieved wide recognition, and Strait continued to manage his family cattle ranch during the day to make some extra cash. 

While he continued to play with his band, without any real connections to the recording industry, Strait became friends with Erv Woolsey, who operated one of the bars in which the Ace in the Hole band played and who had previously worked for the major label MCA Records. Woolsey convinced some of his Music Row (Nashville) connections to come to Texas and to listen to Strait and his band play. Impressed with the performance but concerned that they could not market the Western swing sound that the band featured, they left without offering a deal.

After several unsuccessful trips to Nashville in search of a record deal in which Strait was turned down by every label in town, he considered giving up music altogether. He was offered a job designing cattle pens and decided to take it. He gave the band notice that he was leaving, but after a discussion with his wife, she convinced him to give pursuing music one more year. Not long afterward, a major label, MCA, signed Strait to a recording contract in February 1981. The initial deal was for one song. If the single did well, the label would consider doing an album. The Ace in the Hole band remained with Strait, performing as the backup and touring band for the now solo career of Strait.

===1980s===
In the spring of 1981, Strait released his first single for MCA Records, titled &quot;Unwound&quot;, which climbed to number six on the &quot;Billboard &quot;Hot Country Songs chart that year and was included on his debut album &quot;Strait Country&quot;. The record featured two other singles including &quot;Down and Out&quot;, a number 16 hit for Strait, and &quot;If You&#x27;re Thinking You Want a Stranger (There&#x27;s One Coming Home)&quot;.

&quot;Strait Country&quot; was hailed by critics as being a &quot;new-traditionalist&quot; breakthrough that broke the trend of pop-influenced country prevalent at the time. The critically acclaimed &quot;Strait from the Heart&quot;, his second album, was released in 1982 and featured the first number-one single of his career, &quot;Fool Hearted Memory&quot; and the top-five Western ballad &quot;Amarillo by Morning&quot; which was originally sung and written by Terry Stafford in 1973. It later became one of Strait&#x27;s signature songs. In 1983, Strait made his first appearance at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, when the headlining star, Eddie Rabbitt became sick with the flu. Performing at that rodeo has since become a mainstay throughout his career. He has made more than 20 appearances at the rodeo and played for more than one million fans.

Strait recorded 17 number ones during the decade, including a string of five that lasted from 1983 to 1984 from his next two albums &quot;Right or Wrong&quot;, his first number-one album and the CMA award-winning &quot;Does Fort Worth Ever Cross Your Mind&quot;. The next year, he won the CMA award for top male vocalist, and released his first greatest hits compilation, which featured songs from his first three albums. Also in 1985, Strait released &quot;Something Special&quot;, the third-straight number-one album of his career, featuring the number-one single &quot;The Chair&quot;. In 1986, Strait repeated as the CMA vocalist of the year and released his fourth number-one album &quot;#7&quot;.

Strait and his family were struck with tragedy when his 13-year-old daughter, Jenifer, was killed in a one-car, alcohol-unrelated accident in 1986. She was riding in a Ford Mustang driven by Gregory Wilson Allen, 18, of Staples, Texas. Allen was charged with a class A misdemeanor for vehicular homicide. Mike Cox, spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety in Austin, said, &quot;The responding trooper determined the cause of accident to be excessive speed and that the car did not negotiate the turn properly. Jenifer was riding in the front passenger seat, and none of the four occupants was wearing seat belts at the time. When the vehicle flipped over onto its passenger&#x27;s side, Jenifer was partially ejected, killing her on impact. The incident caused George to greatly limit his contact with the media. He stopped doing interviews for many years after the accident; he and his family did not wish to discuss Jenifer&#x27;s death.

George Strait&#x27;s grief did not hinder his performance, however, or his output; as he released 11 straight number-one hits, starting with &quot;Nobody in His Right Mind Would&#x27;ve Left Her&quot; in 1986 and ending with &quot;Ace in the Hole&quot; in 1989. The singles spanned four albums including &quot;#7&quot;, &quot;Ocean Front Property&quot; in 1987, &quot;If You Ain&#x27;t Lovin&#x27; You Ain&#x27;t Livin&#x27;&quot; in 1988, and 1989&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Blue Neon&quot;, all of which reached the number one spot on country album charts. &quot;Ocean Front Property&quot; was the first country album to ever debut at number one on the charts by any artist. The streak included such songs as &quot;Ocean Front Property&quot;, &quot;All My Ex&#x27;s Live in Texas&quot;, &quot;Famous Last Words of a Fool&quot;, and &quot;Baby Blue&quot;. Strait finished the decade by winning the CMA Entertainer of the Year award in 1989. One year later, he won the award again.

===1990s===

Strait began the decade with the release of his 10th studio album, &quot;Livin&#x27; It Up&quot;, which featured two number-one hits, including &quot;Love Without End, Amen&quot;, his first multiweek hit, and &quot;I&#x27;ve Come to Expect It From You&quot;. Both songs remained first for five weeks in 1990. &quot;Chill of an Early Fall&quot; shortly followed in 1991, and received positive reviews. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; noted that the album marked a shift for Strait from &quot;repeating himself&quot; in his previous works to producing different material. It produced the number-one songs &quot;If I Know Me&quot; and &quot;You Know Me Better Than That&quot;, but ended his streak of 31 straight top-10 hits with the cover of &quot;Lovesick Blues&quot;, which peaked at number 24. The record blocked his run of eight top-charting albums with its peak of number four. In the spring of 1992, &quot;Holding My Own&quot; was released. It did not produce any number ones, but did include two top-five songs, including &quot;So Much Like My Dad&quot;.

Later in 1992, Strait played the main character in the film &quot;Pure Country&quot;, and released the film&#x27;s soundtrack. It was his most successful studio album, producing such hits as &quot;Heartland&quot;, &quot;I Cross My Heart&quot;, and &quot;When Did You Stop Loving Me&quot;, and peaked at number one and number six respectively on the Country and &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album charts. The success continued with his next album, &quot;Easy Come, Easy Go&quot; in 1993, which reached the top five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and featured the hits &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Have That One Back&quot;, &quot;The Man in Love with You&quot;, and the number-one title track.

His next four albums, including &quot;Lead On&quot; in 1994, &quot;Blue Clear Sky&quot; in 1996, &quot;Carrying Your Love with Me&quot; in 1997, and 1998&#x27;s &quot;One Step at a Time&quot;, all charted at number one, with &quot;Blue Clear Sky&quot; claiming the spot on its debut week, and &quot;Carrying Your Love with Me&quot; peaking at number one on the&quot; Billboard &quot;200 for the first time in Strait&#x27;s career. This series of albums produced eight number-one singles for Strait, including &quot;You Can&#x27;t Make a Heart Love Somebody&quot;, &quot;Carried Away&quot;, &quot;One Night at a Time&quot;, and &quot;I Just Want to Dance with You&quot;.

During this period, Strait also released a four-disc, box-set career retrospective, &quot;Strait Out of the Box&quot;, in 1995, which also included two new songs, the top 5 hit &quot;I Know She Still Loves Me&quot; and the No.1 hit &quot;Check Yes or No&quot;. It became the second-best selling box set ever with shipments of 8 million in the United States. He was named as the CMA&#x27;s Top Male Vocalist in 1997 and 1998. Starting in 1997, and continuing until 2001, Strait headlined the George Strait Country Music Festival, which included artists such as Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Kenny Chesney, Alan Jackson, and others.

In an effort to introduce these acts to as many fans as possible, the festival promised not to visit any market more than twice. It played only a small number of dates, usually no more than 20 a year, but still managed to be the ninth-biggest grossing tour of 1998.

Strait completed the decade with the album &quot;Always Never the Same&quot; in 1999, which peaked at number two on country charts and matched the cross-over success of &quot;Pure Country&quot; by reaching number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The record produced the hits &quot;What Do You Say to That&quot;, &quot;Meanwhile&quot;, and the number-one &quot;Write This Down&quot;. Reviews of the album&#x27;s material were generally mixed, but &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; observed that at this point in his career, Strait could record the &quot;most lightweight&quot; material and &quot;make it soar&quot; on the radio with his &quot;grace&quot;. All in all, Strait scored 17 number-one hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country airplay charts in the decade, and carried his successes into the next century.

===2000s===

Strait released a self-titled album in 2000, which despite a number-one and number-seven showing on the country and &quot;Billboard &quot;200 album charts, respectively, produced no number-one singles, and was the first studio album of his career to not be certified platinum. The singles &quot;Go On&quot; and &quot;If You Can Do Anything Else&quot; were released from the record, with both peaking in the top five. In May 2001, &quot;The Road Less Traveled&quot; was released. Reviews for the album were mostly positive; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described it as sticking to the formula, &quot;but adds a few twists that make it superior to his last few releases.&quot; It featured &quot;vocal processing&quot;, and was considered by some critics as an experimental album. Three singles were released from it, two of which reached number one, including &quot;She&#x27;ll Leave You with a Smile&quot;, his 50th on combined charts and &quot;Living and Living Well&quot;, both of which reached the top 30 of &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with the former peaking at number 23, Strait&#x27;s highest rank on the chart. The single &quot;Run&quot; peaked at number two and reached number 34 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 100. Strait released two records in 2003. &quot;For the Last Time: Live from the Astrodome&quot; was a recording of the last Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo to take place in the Astrodome. The performance itself set the record for paid attendance at the venue, with 68,266 people, breaking Latin superstar Selena&#x27;s previous record of about 67,000 in 1995.

His next album, &quot;Honkytonkville&quot; was described as &quot;a fiery set of hard country&quot;, and was praised &quot;for its mixture of the old Strait with his modern, superstar self.&quot; It did not produce any number ones for Strait, but included the hits &quot;Cowboys Like Us&quot; and a cover of Bruce Robison&#x27;s &quot;Desperately&quot;. His 2004 performance at Reliant Stadium set a new rodeo attendance record, with 68,679 spectators. That year, he issued a greatest hits package billed as &quot;50 Number Ones&quot;, chronicling the number-one hits of his career from all charts, starting with &quot;Fool Hearted Memory&quot; and ending with &quot;She&#x27;ll Leave You With a Smile.&quot; A new track, &quot;I Hate Everything&quot;, was also included, and became his 51st overall number one in 2004.

The next year, &quot;Somewhere Down in Texas&quot; arrived, which produced the hit &quot;You&#x27;ll Be There&quot;, marking Strait&#x27;s first appearance on the adult contemporary chart. The next year, he embarked on a tour that included only 18 performances, but grossed over $15 million. He attributed this success to the fact that his band and he are &quot;musically very tight&quot;, have a large pool of songs to draw from, and perform those songs very similarly to how they sound on their albums.

On October 3, 2006, Strait marked his 30th year in the music industry with the release of a new album titled &quot;It Just Comes Natural&quot;. The album was recorded in Key West, Florida, in Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s Shrimp Boat Sound Studio (said to be a better recording location due to lack of allergy flare-ups during recording process), which was also the recording location of &quot;Troubadour&quot;. It featured 15 new songs. Strait&#x27;s long-time friend and songwriter, Dean Dillon, co-wrote two of the songs on the album. It received generally positive reviews from critics. &quot;People&quot;, in their four-star review, remarked, &quot;If ever there was a natural in country music, it&#x27;s Strait,&quot; while &quot;USA Today&quot; raved that &quot;he continues to make such consistent quality look easy&quot;. The first single from the album, &quot;Give It Away&quot; reached number one, making one of its co-writers, country legend &quot;Whispering Bill&quot; Anderson, the first songwriter to have a number-one hit in five different decades. The title track, &quot;It Just Comes Natural&quot; became his 42nd &quot;Billboard&quot; number one.

In 2007, &quot;Wrapped&quot; reached number one on the Mediabase 24/7 country music charts, giving Strait his 55th overall number-one single. From January through April of that year, Strait headlined a 23-date arena tour with country-music legend Ronnie Milsap and then-newcomer Taylor Swift. He released a new album titled &quot;Troubadour&quot; on April 1, 2008. The CD contained 12 tracks, including a duet with Patty Loveless and another with long-time songwriter Dean Dillon. The lead single from the album, &quot;I Saw God Today&quot;, debuted at number 19 on the &quot;Radio and Records&quot; and &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. It is the highest debut ever for a single from Strait and the fourth-highest debut for a song in country-music history. &quot;Troubadour&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 album charts, selling over 160,000 copies in its first week of release. &quot;River of Love&quot;, the third single from the album, became his 57th number-one song in 2009.

In April 2009, Strait was honored by the Academy of Country Music with the Artist of the Decade Award, which was presented to Strait by the previous ACM Artist of the Decade, Garth Brooks. In June of that year, he headlined the first event at the new Dallas Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Strait&#x27;s single &quot;Living for the Night&quot; was released on May 28, 2009, and was written by Strait, his son Bubba, and Dean Dillon. The song was the lead single from his album &quot;Twang&quot;, released on August 11, 2009. &quot;Twang&quot; was certified gold for selling over 500,000 copies. By 2009, he broke Conway Twitty&#x27;s previous record for the most number-one hits on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Country Songs chart when his 44 number one singles surpassed Twitty&#x27;s 40. 

=== 2010s ===

In 2010, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked Strait number one in the top-25 country artists of the past 25 years. On September 6, 2011, Strait released the album, &quot;Here for a Good Time&quot;, which yielded two number-one singles—&quot;Here for a Good Time&quot; and &quot;Love&#x27;s Gonna Make It Alright&quot;—bringing Strait&#x27;s number-one singles total to 59. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Drinkin&#x27; Man&quot;, was less successful, peaking at number 37.

In October 2012, Strait released the single &quot;Give It All We Got Tonight&quot;, which was included on his album &quot;Love Is Everything&quot;, released on May 14, 2013. The song initiated a &quot;60 for 60&quot; movement by Strait&#x27;s label, to make the song his 60th number-one single on all country charts while he was still 60 years old. The song reached the top of the &quot;Mediabase&quot; charts in May 2013. The album&#x27;s next single, &quot;I Believe&quot;, reached number 50 on the U.S. Country Airplay chart, making it Strait&#x27;s first single to miss the top 40. Strait won the 2013 CMA Entertainer of the Year award.

In November 2013, &quot;Billboard&quot; presented Strait with its Legend of Live honor during the 10th annual Billboard Touring Awards ceremony. The award honors the concert industry&#x27;s top artist based on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Boxscore chart and box-office performance. Strait is the first country artist to receive &quot;Billboard&quot;″s highest touring accolade. On April 19, 2015, Strait made a guest appearance at the 2015 ACM Awards, he performed &quot;All My Ex&#x27;s Lives in Texas&quot; and his new single &quot;Let it Go&quot;.

In 2016, Strait was selected as one of 30 artists to perform on &quot;Forever Country&quot;, for a mash-up track of &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot;, &quot;On the Road Again&quot;, and &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;, which celebrates 50 years of the CMA Awards.

In 2018, Strait released a single called &quot;Codigo&quot;, after a brand of tequila produced by a company in which he had invested.

===The Cowboy Rides Away Tour===
On September 26, 2012, Strait announced that he was retiring from touring, and that his Cowboy Rides Away Tour would be his last. Tickets for both arenas and stadiums on the Cowboy Rides Away Tour sold out in a matter of hours. The tour started on January 18, 2013, in Lubbock, Texas, and was divided into two legs: 21 concerts in 2013 and 26 concerts in 2014. The tour ended in Arlington, Texas, on June 7, 2014. Strait was supported on the tour by his longtime 11-member touring group, the Ace in the Hole Band. For the 2013 leg, Martina McBride was the opening performer.

On January 9, 2014, Strait initiated the second leg of the tour, which featured the opening performers Jason Aldean, Eric Church, Martina McBride, Miranda Lambert, Little Big Town, Vince Gill, Lee Ann Womack, Merle Haggard, Chris Young, Ronnie Dunn, Luke Bryan, Tim McGraw, Kenny Chesney, Alan Jackson, and Asleep at the Wheel. Many of these performers gathered together for the tour&#x27;s final concert in Arlington, Texas on June 7, before 104,793 fans - at the time both the largest attendance at a single-headliner concert in the United States, and the largest ticketed attendance ever at a concert in a stadium in the United States. Strait would then break both his own records ten years later, at Kyle Field in College Station, Texas. The concert also set a record for the largest gross at a single-show country concert, $18,194,374, and broke the 33-year-old record as well for &quot;largest indoor concert ever,&quot; easily surpassing the 87,500 fans who attended the December 5, 1981, Rolling Stones concert at the New Orleans Superdome (opening acts, The Neville Brothers, followed by George Thorogood and the Destroyers).

A live album recorded from the final concert in Arlington titled &quot;The Cowboy Rides Away: Live from AT&amp;T Stadium&quot; was released on September 16, 2014, with DVD/CDs of the concert being released on November 10, 2014, with Walmart exclusively releasing a deluxe edition including two CDs, as well. This deluxe DVD is the entire over three-hour concert and the accompanying two CDs have 28 of the 40 songs sung that night. On August 29, 2014, the Country Music Television channel broadcast a two-hour concert special of the event titled &quot;George Strait: The Cowboy Rides Away&quot;. This CMT concert special had hours of music from the concert and interviews.

===2020s===
Strait broke the record for most fans at a U.S. concert by a single headlining act on Saturday, June 15, 2024, with a concert at Kyle Field at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, Texas, with 110,905 fans in attendance. The record was previously held by The Grateful Dead who had 107,019 fans in attendance at their 1977 show at Raceway Park in New Jersey. The show also set a new record for Texas A&amp;M’s Kyle Field for most fans at a single event. The previous record was on October 11, 2014, with 110,633 fans, for a Texas A&amp;M football game against Ole Miss.

==Musical style==
Strait&#x27;s style of country music has been largely labeled as neotraditional country, which relies on traditional instrumentation in country music, i.e. fiddle and pedal steel guitar. His style has also been labeled as Texas country, Western swing, and honky-tonk.

==Personal life==

Strait eloped in Mexico with his high school sweetheart Norma in December 1971. Their first child, Jenifer, was born on October 6, 1972. Their son, George Harvey Strait Jr., known as &quot;Bubba&quot;, was born in 1981.

Jenifer was killed in an automobile accident in San Marcos on June 25, 1986, at age 13. The family set up the Jenifer Lyn Strait Foundation, which donates money to children&#x27;s charities in the San Antonio area. George Strait Jr., who is a graduate of Texas A&amp;M, competed as a Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association team-roping competitor. Strait was able to watch his son compete at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo in 2006 shortly before taking the stage for his own performance.

On April 10, 2009, John Byron &quot;Buddy&quot; Strait, who was George&#x27;s older brother, died at the age of 58.

Since 2010, Strait has served as spokesman for the Wrangler National Patriot program, a campaign designed to raise awareness and funds for America&#x27;s wounded and fallen military veterans and their families. Strait says, &quot;I&#x27;ve been a part of the Wrangler family for a long time... when they came to me with the idea for supporting fallen and wounded American veterans and their families, I knew I wanted to get involved.&quot; He also appeared in commercials for Tractor Supply Company.

In February 2012, Strait became a grandfather when George Strait Jr. and his wife Tamara had their first child, a son, George Harvey Strait III. 

From 1983 through 2017, Strait hosted a prestigious, annual team-roping event; &quot;The George Strait Team Roping Classic&quot;. It was originally held in Kingsville, Texas, but then took place for several years at the San Antonio Rose Palace.

Strait owns a Gulfstream G450 business jet; its tail number is N518GS. His personal aircraft is housed at the Landmark Aviation facility in San Antonio. He teamed up with Texas Governor Greg Abbott to help with disaster relief efforts in the wake of Hurricane Harvey which devastated coastal areas of Texas.

Strait along with long-time friend and business partner Tom Cusick created the Vaqueros Del Mar (Cowboys of the Sea) Invitational Golf Tournament and Concert held annually at Strait and Cusick&#x27;s Texas Hill Country resort Tapatio Springs Resort near Boerne, Texas. The Invitational raises money for David Feherty&#x27;s Troops First Foundation, benefiting wounded servicemen, servicewomen and their families. Since its beginning in 2012, more than US$5 million have been raised by the events. In January 2018, George Strait was named the 2018 Texan of the Year by the Texas Legislative Conference, a statewide group of business and political leaders. Strait was honored for his fundraising efforts in the wake of the widespread flooding following Hurricane Harvey.

==Discography==

In more than 30 years of recording, all of which have been spent with MCA Records, George Strait has garnered 61 number-one songs on all country charts (including &quot;Mediabase 24/7&quot;, the former &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; chart, and the now-defunct Gavin Report chart), and has more number-one hits than any other artist in a single genre. His 44 &quot;Billboard&quot; country number-one hits are a record, four more than Conway Twitty&#x27;s total that includes several duets with Loretta Lynn. Additionally, Strait is also the first artist in the history of &quot;Billboard&quot; to have at least one single enter the top 10 of a &quot;Billboard&quot; chart for 30 consecutive years, starting in 1981 when his debut single &quot;Unwound&quot; peaked at number six on the Hot Country Singles chart. All of his top-10 singles have been on that chart. Strait has sold more than 70 million records in the United States alone, and his certifications from the RIAA include 13 multiplatinum, 33 platinum, and 38 gold albums.

== Filmography ==

Strait has acted in several films. He had a bit part in &quot;The Soldier&quot; (1982) and starred in &quot;Pure Country&quot; (1992). He also appeared as himself in &quot;Grand Champion&quot; (2002).

The film &quot;Pure Country&quot; featured George Strait in the lead role as Dusty Chandler, a famous country singer who strays too far from his country roots and traditional sound. It provided the opportunity for Strait to branch out from his own traditional country sound for a more rock-and-roll approach. The film had little success at the box office and took in only $15 million, but the soundtrack also called &quot;Pure Country&quot;, produced several hit singles for Strait. It has become his best-selling album to date. Strait had a limited role in the sequel to &quot;Pure Country&quot;, &quot;Pure Country 2: The Gift&quot;.

== Honors and awards ==

Strait holds the record for most number-one albums and singles, gold albums, platinum albums, and multiplatinum albums in the history of country music, and is 11th in the most number-one albums in all other genres. Strait is third only to Elvis Presley and The Beatles with the most gold and platinum albums in the history of music. Strait has been certified as the 12th-best selling artist in American history, with career record sales of 70 million in the United States.

Strait has held the world record for most number one hit singles across all charts and genres with 60 number-one hits since 2013, and is the only artist in the history of music of any kind to have a top-10 hit every year for 30 years. He is also second all-time in top-10 hits in the history of music, currently five away from breaking the all-time record held by Eddy Arnold, who had 92 in his historic career. Strait has won 22 CMA Awards, including consecutive Entertainer of the Year honors in 1989 and 1990, and also just recently won that same honor in 2013 (and is the only artist to win the top honor in three different decades) and holds the career record for CMA nominations (as a whole) and the most consecutively of all time.

As of 2009, he holds the record for the most CMA awards. Strait also holds those same records for wins and nominations for the Academy of Country Music Awards. Strait was elected into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2006, performing his then-latest number-one hit &quot;Give it Away&quot; right before accepting his replica Hall of Fame plaque at the 40th CMA Awards. He was only the second artist (after Eddy Arnold in 1966) to be inducted into the Hall of Fame while still actively recording and producing chart-topping hits and albums.

As of June 8, 2010, Strait was named the top country-music artist of the past 25 years according to &quot;Billboard&quot;. In October 2008, the Academy of Country Music Awards named Strait their Artist of the Decade for the 2000s. He was presented the award by the previous winner Garth Brooks. Past winners of the award are Marty Robbins (1960s), Loretta Lynn (1970s), Alabama (1980s), and Garth Brooks (1990s). With the win of the entertainer-of-the-year award in 2013, he is the only artist to ever win that award in three different decades and also was the oldest winner. The win is currently the longest span between wins for that award, as well. Strait is also tied with Merle Haggard for the most male vocalist-of-the-year awards.

On June 1, 2013, Strait appeared at the Alamodome, in San Antonio, Texas, before 70,000 fans in the last concert of the first half of his two-year farewell tour. Governor Rick Perry, who was in attendance with First Lady Anita Thigpen Perry, announced that May 18, Strait&#x27;s birthday, would be George Strait Day in Texas each year.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Strait at number 156 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

<text>The Prix de Rome () or Grand Prix de Rome was a French scholarship for arts students, initially for painters and sculptors, that was established in 1663 during the reign of Louis XIV of France. Winners were awarded a bursary that allowed them to stay in Rome for three to five years at the expense of the state. The prize was extended to architecture in 1720, music in 1803 and engraving in 1804. The prestigious award was abolished in 1968 by André Malraux, then Minister of Culture, following the May 68 riots that called for cultural change.

==History==
The Prix de Rome was initially created for painters and sculptors in 1663 in France, during the reign of Louis XIV. It was an annual bursary for promising artists having proved their talents by completing a very difficult elimination contest. To succeed, a student had to create a sketch on an assigned topic while isolated in a closed booth with no reference material to draw on. The prize, organised by the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture), was open to their students. From 1666, the award winner could win a stay of three to five years at the Palazzo Mancini in Rome at the expense of the King of France. In 1720, the Académie Royale d’Architecture began a prize in architecture. Six painters, four sculptors, and two architects would be sent to the French Academy in Rome founded by Jean-Baptiste Colbert from 1666.

Expanded after 140 years into five categories, the contest started in 1663 as two categories: painting and sculpture. Architecture was added in 1720. In 1803, music was added, and after 1804 there was a &quot;prix&quot; for engraving as well. The primary winner took the &quot;First Grand Prize&quot; (called the &quot;agréé&quot;), and the &quot;Second Prizes&quot; were awarded to the runners-up.

In 1803, Napoleon Bonaparte moved the French Academy in Rome to the Villa Medici, with the intention of preserving an institution once threatened by the French Revolution. At first, the villa and its gardens were in a sad state, and they had to be renovated in order to house the winners of the Prix de Rome. In this way, he hoped to retain for young French artists the opportunity to see and copy the masterpieces of antiquity and the Renaissance.

Jacques-Louis David, having failed to win the prize three years in a row, considered suicide. Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Ernest Chausson, and Maurice Ravel attempted the Prix de Rome but did not gain recognition. Ravel tried a total of five times to win the prize, and the last failed attempt in 1905 was so controversial that it led to a complete reorganization of the administration at the Paris Conservatory.

During World War II (1939–45), the prize winners were accommodated in the Villa Paradiso in Nice.
The Prix de Rome was abolished in 1968 by André Malraux, who was Minister of Culture at the time. Since then, a number of contests have been created, and the academies, together with the Institut de France, were merged by the State and the Minister of Culture. Selected residents now have an opportunity for study during an 18-month (sometimes 2-year) stay at The Academy of France in Rome, which is accommodated in the Villa Medici.

The heyday of the Prix de Rome was during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. It was later imitated by the Prix Abd-el-Tif and the Villa Abd-el-Tif in Algiers, 1907–1961, and later Prix d&#x27;Indochine including a bursary to visit the École des Beaux-Arts de l&#x27;Indochine in Hanoi, 1920–1939, and bursary for residence at the Casa de Velázquez in Madrid, 1929–present.

==Prix de Rome (Netherlands)==
A Prix de Rome was also established in the Kingdom of Holland by Lodewijk Napoleon to award young artists and architects. During the years 1807–1810 prize winners were sent to Paris and onwards to Rome for study. In 1817, after the Netherlands had gained its independence, King Willem I restarted the prize; though it took until 1823 before the new &quot;Royal Academies&quot; of Amsterdam and Antwerp could organize the juries. Suspended in 1851 it was reinstated in 1870 by William III of the Netherlands. Since then the winners have been selected by the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam under the main headings of architecture and the visual arts.

==Prix de Rome (Belgium)==
The Belgian Prix de Rome (Dutch: Prijs van Rome) is an award for young artists, created in 1832, following the example of the original French Prix de Rome. The Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp organised the prize until 1920, when the national government took over. The first prize is also sometimes called the Grand Prix de Rome. There were distinct categories for architecture, painting, sculpture and music.

<doc id="169981" wikidata="Q467519" url="?curid=169981" title="Randy Travis">
<text>Randy Bruce Traywick (born May 4, 1959), known professionally as Randy Travis, is an American country and gospel music singer and songwriter, as well as a film and television actor. Active since 1979, he has recorded over 20 studio albums and charted over 50 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts, including sixteen that reached the number-one position. 

Travis&#x27;s commercial success began in the mid-1980s with the release of his album &quot;Storms of Life&quot;, which was certified triple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. He followed up his major-label debut with a string of platinum and multi-platinum albums, but his commercial success declined throughout the 1990s. In 1997, he left Warner Bros. Records for DreamWorks Records; he signed to Word Records for a series of gospel albums beginning in 2000 before transferring back to Warner at the end of the 21st century&#x27;s first decade. His musical accolades include seven Grammy Awards, eleven ACM Awards, eight Dove Awards, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and a 2016 induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Major songs of his include &quot;On the Other Hand&quot;, &quot;Forever and Ever, Amen&quot;, &quot;I Told You So&quot;, &quot;Hard Rock Bottom of Your Heart&quot;, and &quot;Three Wooden Crosses&quot;.

He is noted as a key figure in the neotraditional country movement, a return to more traditional sounds within the genre following the country pop crossovers of the early 1980s. Nearly all of his albums were produced or co-produced by Kyle Lehning, and feature frequent co-writing credits from Paul Overstreet, Don Schlitz, and Skip Ewing. Critics have compared his baritone singing voice to other artists such as Lefty Frizzell, Merle Haggard, and George Jones. Since surviving a near-fatal stroke in 2013, which severely limited his singing and speaking ability, he has released archival recordings and made limited public appearances. James Dupré has toured singing Travis&#x27;s songs with his road band. Between mid-2024 and January 2025, Travis released two new songs where his voice was re-created via artificial intelligence.

Travis&#x27;s acting career includes roles in the television movies &quot;Wind in the Wire&quot; (1993) and &quot;A Holiday to Remember&quot; (1995), as well as the Patrick Swayze movie &quot;Black Dog&quot; (1998).

==Early life==
Randy Bruce Traywick was born May 4, 1959, in Marshville, North Carolina. He is the second of six children to Bobbie and Harold Traywick. Harold Traywick worked as a meat packer and also built houses. He also enjoyed listening to country music such as Ernest Tubb and Patsy Cline, in addition to singing, playing guitar, and writing his own songs. By the time Randy was eight years old, his father would send him and his brothers to the house of a friend named Kate Magnum, who would teach him and his brothers Ricky and David how to play guitar. Harold also constructed a stage behind the family house, where he would invite friends over to hear his sons sing. Randy and Ricky performed publicly for the first time in 1968 at a talent show held at the local elementary school; while the brothers did not win, they continued to perform at local talent shows, with David later joining to accompany them on bass guitar.

Randy dropped out of school in the ninth grade. As a teenager, he committed a number of criminal offenses. These included reckless driving after he crashed Ricky&#x27;s car in a cornfield, breaking into a church to hold a party, driving under the influence, resisting arrest, and stealing knives and watches from a local store. On his seventeenth birthday, Randy was arrested for public intoxication and faced imprisonment. Despite his charges, Don Cusic noted in the 1990 book &quot;Randy Travis: The King of the New Country Traditionalists&quot; that his parents still supported him, as they would pay his bail and support him in court whenever he was arrested.

In 1977, the Traywicks entered a talent competition held in Charlotte, North Carolina, after hearing an advertisement for it on the radio. The grand prize for the contest was $100 cash and a recording session. The contest consisted of eight semi-final audition rounds held every Tuesday at Country City USA, a nightclub co-owned by Randy&#x27;s future wife, Mary Elizabeth &quot;Lib&quot; Hatcher. At the performance, Randy played rhythm guitar and sang, while Ricky played lead guitar. However, Ricky had to drop out of the competition partway through because he had to serve time at a youth detention center, leaving Randy to continue as a solo act. Randy ended up winning the competition. Afterward, he held a conversation with Hatcher about his then-impending arrest charges for hot-wiring a neighbor&#x27;s truck. Hatcher and disc jockey John Harper, who also worked at the club, chose to represent Randy in court, which led to him serving probation and coming under the custody of Hatcher in lieu of a jail sentence. Additionally, Hatcher employed Randy as a singer at Country City USA. During this time, Hatcher advised him on his singing and performance. Harold would attend Randy&#x27;s performances in this timespan, but was later banned from the club after altercations with patrons.

==Music career==
Hatcher booked a number of country music singers to perform at her club as a means of making connections with country music personnel in Nashville, Tennessee. One such singer, Joe Stampley, agreed to produce a session for Traywick in Nashville. Hatcher paid $10,000 for the recording session and promotion, which was done through an independent label based out of Shreveport, Louisiana, called Paula Records. The session accounted for the singles &quot;She&#x27;s My Woman&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Take Any Willing Woman&quot;. Traywick and Hatcher promoted copies of the single to radio stations throughout the Southern United States in 1979. The former reached number 91 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts. After the failure of these singles, Hatcher and Traywick continued submitting demo recordings to executives but were unable to garner interest at first. In 1981, Traywick and Hatcher chose to move to Nashville to put themselves closer to the center of the country music industry. Despite this, they would still travel back to Charlotte on weekends to tend to business at Country City USA, which by that point had relocated to a larger building. They supported themselves by renting out part of their Nashville house to songwriter Keith Stegall, who used it as an office. Stegall then introduced the two to song publisher and disc jockey Charlie Monk at a golf game, which led to Traywick performing songs for Monk. Stegall also submitted Traywick&#x27;s demos to various Nashville producers to garner interest in a recording contract. Traywick recorded one session with producer John Ragsdale for the intent of signing him to Curb Records, but the label ultimately chose not to sign him.

In 1982 Hatcher began managing a nightclub called the Nashville Palace through the recommendation of singer Ray Pillow. She initially hired Traywick to wash dishes, but soon began to have him perform there as well. By this point, he began crediting himself as Randy Ray, as he and Hatcher thought the name was easier to pronounce than &quot;Traywick&quot;. Hatcher also rented her in-house office space out to other industry executives, including staff of &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; magazine; meanwhile, Randy Ray continued to work on his songwriting under Stegall&#x27;s mentorship. By the end of the year, Hatcher and Nashville Palace owner John Hobbs financed an independent album titled &quot;Randy Ray Live at the Nashville Palace&quot;, which consisted of ten songs recorded by him at the Palace. Stegall served as producer on this project. He also auditioned on &quot;You Can Be a Star&quot;, a talent show on the former Nashville Network (TNN), in early 1983. He placed second behind Lang Scott, who would later marry country singer Linda Davis. Ralph Emery also invited him to perform several times on the TNN talk show &quot;Nashville Now&quot;, which he hosted.

Despite the exposure from &quot;Nashville Now&quot;, he still failed to secure a recording contract throughout 1984. Martha Sharp, then working in artists and repertoire (A&amp;R) at Warner Bros. Records&#x27;s Nashville division, attended a seminar in late 1984 where executives suggested signing attractive young artists with a &quot;traditional&quot; sound. Through mutual contacts with Monk and Stegall, she became aware of Randy Ray, who at the time was working on more songs with the latter. Sharp arranged for him to be signed to a contract initially consisting of four songs. Executives disliked the name &quot;Randy Ray&quot; as they thought it sounded &quot;podunk&quot;, and Sharp suggested &quot;Randy Travis&quot;.

===19851986: &quot;Storms of Life&quot;===
Travis signed with Warner Nashville in early 1985. His first contract with them resulted in the recording of four songs: &quot;Prairie Rose&quot;, &quot;On the Other Hand&quot;, &quot;Carrying Fire&quot;, and &quot;Reasons I Cheat&quot;. &quot;Prairie Rose&quot; appeared on the soundtrack of the 1985 film &quot;Rustlers&#x27; Rhapsody&quot;. Keith Whitley also recorded &quot;On the Other Hand&quot; for his 1985 debut album &quot;L.A. to Miami&quot;. These four songs were all recorded in the same session, with Stegall and Kyle Lehning co-producing. At the time, Lehning was best known for producing Dan Seals and had also worked with Stegall on his own singles for Epic Records. Although Lehning did not want to work with Travis at first, he chose to do so after Monk and Sharp encouraged him. After recording these songs, Travis appeared on &quot;Nashville Now&quot; again on May 17, 1985, where he performed with Johnny Russell and Lorrie Morgan. Warner also included him among the performers at their talent showcase at the Fan Fair (now CMA Music Festival) in downtown Nashville in mid-1985. Warner released &quot;On the Other Hand&quot; in August 1985, and it peaked at number 67 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts. The follow-up &quot;1982&quot; peaked at number six on the country charts in early 1986, thus becoming Travis&#x27;s first hit single. Following the success of &quot;1982&quot;, Travis was booked as an opening act for Barbara Mandrell and T. G. Sheppard, leading to both Travis and Hatcher quitting the Palace. The song&#x27;s success also led to him performing on the Grand Ole Opry for the first time in March 1986. He also received an award for Top New Male Vocalist from the Academy of Country Music (ACM). This was followed by further opening act gigs throughout early 1986, which resulted in gigs from California to Georgia. Hatcher and Travis bought a former bread truck which they converted to a tour bus, in addition to hiring a five-piece band to perform with him.

After &quot;1982&quot; became Travis&#x27;s first top-ten hit, Warner executives chose to re-release &quot;On the Other Hand&quot;. Nick Hunter, who promoted singles to country radio for Warner, noted that the song was popular in sales and listener demand despite its initially low chart peak. Upon re-release, &quot;On the Other Hand&quot; became his first number-one single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts in July 1986. &quot;On the Other Hand&quot; and &quot;1982&quot; were both included on Travis&#x27;s debut album for Warner, &quot;Storms of Life&quot;. The album was released on June 2, 1986, and sold over 100,000 copies in its first sales week in addition to reaching number one on Top Country Albums. Six years after its release, the album was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), honoring U.S. sales of three million copies. One of the tracks, Travis&#x27;s own composition &quot;Send My Body&quot;, had previously appeared on the Randy Ray album in 1982. Lehning and Stegall co-produced the album; they also contributed on keyboard and guitar, respectively. Other musicians on the project included drummers Eddie Bayers, Larrie Londin, and James Stroud; guitarist Larry Byrom; Dobro player Jerry Douglas; bassist David Hungate; and backing vocals from Lehning, Baillie &amp; the Boys, Paul Davis, and Paul Overstreet. The album produced another number-one in &quot;Diggin&#x27; Up Bones&quot; in late 1986, and a number two single in &quot;No Place Like Home&quot; in early 1987. Overstreet wrote &quot;On the Other Hand&quot; with Don Schlitz, &quot;Diggin&#x27; Up Bones&quot; with Nat Stuckey, and &quot;No Place Like Home&quot; by himself. The latter was also Travis&#x27;s first single to be promoted through a music video.

In late 1986, Travis was asked to host the Country Music Association (CMA) Awards telecast to replace original host Ricky Skaggs, who had to back out after his son was hospitalized with a neck injury. Travis won the Horizon Award (now called Best New Artist) at that ceremony, while also receiving a nomination for Male Vocalist of the Year. Additionally, &quot;On the Other Hand&quot; was nominated for Single of the Year and &quot;Storms of Life&quot; for Album of the Year. On November 15, 1986, Travis performed a concert with George Jones and Patty Loveless in Charlotte, North Carolina, where Charlotte&#x27;s then-mayor Harvey Gantt declared November 15 to be &quot;Randy Travis Day&quot;. A similar acknowledgement was passed as a city ordinanace in Travis&#x27;s hometown of Marshville soon afterward. Warner also issued a Christmas single in December 1986 titled &quot;White Christmas Makes Me Blue&quot;, which sold over 79,000 copies. By year&#x27;s end, Skaggs had inducted Travis into the Grand Ole Opry. &quot;Diggin&#x27; Up Bones&quot; also accounted for Travis&#x27;s first Grammy Award nomination, in the category of Best Male Country Vocal Performance, in early 1987.

&quot;Storms of Life&quot; received critical favor. Mark A. Humphrey of AllMusic wrote that Travis had &quot;astonishing Lefty Frizzell-style pipes, excellent material, and sympathetic production&quot;. An uncredited review in &quot;Billboard&quot; also described Travis&#x27;s voice with favor, additionally stating that &quot; He has the materialintrospective lyrics and gorgeous melodiesand the understated, classic country production here to make the most of his gifts.&quot; Writing for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Jack Hurst also compared Travis&#x27;s voice favorably to both Frizzell and Merle Haggard, while also praising the lyrics of the singles in particular.

===19871988: &quot;Always &amp; Forever&quot;===
In early 1987, Travis released the single &quot;Forever and Ever, Amen&quot;. It held the number-one position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts for three weeks, becoming the first song to hold that position for that long since Johnny Lee&#x27;s &quot;Lookin&#x27; for Love&quot; in 1980. The song served as the lead single to his second Warner album &quot;Always &amp; Forever&quot;. As with &quot;On the Other Hand&quot;, Schlitz and Overstreet co-wrote the song. Corresponding with this song&#x27;s success, Travis won Male Vocalist of the Year from the ACM awards, where &quot;Storms of Life&quot; won Album of the Year and &quot;On the Other Hand&quot; won both Song and Single of the Year. During the awards ceremony, Travis performed &quot;Forever and Ever, Amen&quot; live for the first time. Cusic described the song in 1990 as a &quot;career record&quot;. In addition to topping the country charts, &quot;Forever and Ever, Amen&quot; was a minor hit single in the United Kingdom, reaching number 55 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2019, editors of &quot;The Tennessean&quot; listed it as one of the 100 greatest country songs of all time, while also referring to it as Travis&#x27;s signature song. &quot;Forever and Ever, Amen&quot; is also Travis&#x27;s highest-certified single, having earned double-platinum RIAA certification in 2021. 

&quot;Always &amp; Forever&quot; included Lehning as producer, with many of the same vocal and instrumental contributors as its predecessor such as Baillie &amp; the Boys, Douglas, and Overstreet. Lehning worked with Travis, Hatcher, and Sharp to pick from several hundred songs before determining which ones would appear on the album. One track on the album was Dennis Linde&#x27;s composition &quot;What&#x27;ll You Do About Me&quot;, which was previously released by Steve Earle in 1984; the song would later be released by the Forester Sisters in 1992, and Doug Supernaw in 1995. During the promotion of the album, Travis began to notice strain on his vocal cords, which was treated through consultations at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. &quot;Always &amp; Forever&quot; spent 43 weeks at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums charts, breaking the previous longevity record of 28 weeks set by Alabama&#x27;s &quot;Mountain Music&quot; earlier in the decade.

&quot;I Won&#x27;t Need You Anymore (Always and Forever)&quot;, &quot;Too Gone Too Long&quot;, and &quot;I Told You So&quot; were all released as singles from &quot;Always &amp; Forever&quot;, with all three reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts between 1987 and 1988. Travis wrote &quot;I Told You So&quot; by himself in 1982 around the time he attempted to sign with Curb Records. Monk submitted the song to Lee Greenwood at that time, although he declined it. Both Darrell Clanton and Barbara Mandrell had recorded the song, the former as the B-side of his 1985 single &quot;I Forgot That I Don&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Always &amp; Forever&quot; received Travis&#x27;s highest certification of quintuple platinum for sales of five million copies.

&quot;Always &amp; Forever&quot; and its singles accounted for several award wins and nominations for Travis. &quot;Forever and Ever, Amen&quot; won both Song and Single of the Year at the following year&#x27;s ACM awards (honoring the year 1987), where Travis also won Top Male Vocalist. He was also nominated for Entertainer of the Year, while &quot;Forever and Ever, Amen&quot; received a Music Video of the Year nomination and &quot;Always &amp; Forever&quot; was nominated for Album of the Year. At the 1987 CMA Awards, Travis won Male Vocalist of the Year and was nominated for Entertainer of the Year while &quot;Forever and Ever, Amen&quot; won Single of the Year and was nominated for Music Video of the Year and &quot;Always &amp; Forever&quot; won Album of the Year. Additionally, &quot;Always &amp; Forever&quot; accounted for Travis&#x27;s first Grammy Award win, for Best Male Country Vocal Performance at the 30th Annual Grammy Awards in March 1988. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, writing for AllMusic, thought the album &quot;rivaled its predecessor in its quality&quot; while also stating that it had &quot;lean&quot; production and &quot;nuanced&quot; vocals.

===19881990: &quot;Old 8×10&quot; and &quot;No Holdin&#x27; Back&quot;===
Travis continued to tour throughout the United States in 1988, including a spot on the Marlboro Country Music Tour in Madison Square Garden, which also featured Alabama, the Judds, and George Strait. That same year he released his third Warner album, &quot;Old 8×10&quot;. The album was originally slated to be released on July 12, but was moved up to June 30 to make it eligible for CMA Awards. The first three singles off the album all went to number one on the country charts between 1988 and early 1989. These were &quot;Honky Tonk Moon&quot;, &quot;Deeper Than the Holler&quot; (another Overstreet-Schlitz collaboration), and &quot;Is It Still Over?&quot; The fourth and final single, &quot;Promises&quot; (which Travis wrote with John Lindley), was much less successful with a number 17 peak on Hot Country Songs. Music journalists Tom Roland and Colin Larkin both attributed the song&#x27;s failure to it featuring just vocals and acoustic guitar. &quot;Old 8×10&quot; became his third consecutive album to reach the number one position on Top Country Albums. It also won Travis a Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance. &quot;I Told You So&quot; received a Single of the Year nomination from the Academy of Country Music, while Travis himself was nominated as both Entertainer of the Year and Top Male Vocalist in 1988 and 1989. Also in 1988, the Country Music Association awarded him as Male Vocalist of the Year a second time, along with an Entertainer of the Year nomination, as well as Single and Song of the Year nominations for &quot;I Told You So&quot;. The foundation also nominated &quot;Old 8×10&quot; for Album of the Year alongside additional Male Vocalist and Entertainer of the Year nominations. Reviewing the album for AllMusic, Brian Mansfield stated that it &quot;lacks the monster hits of his debut but wears just as well.&quot; In 1997, &quot;Old 8×10&quot; received its highest certification of double-platinum.

Travis ended 1989 with two studio albums. First was a Christmas album titled &quot;An Old Time Christmas&quot;, which included the previously-released Christmas single &quot;White Christmas Makes Me Blue&quot;. The other tracks included a mix of Christmas standards and original songs, one of which (&quot;How Do I Wrap My Heart Up for Christmas&quot;) Travis co-wrote with Overstreet. A month later was the studio release &quot;No Holdin&#x27; Back&quot;. Prior to the album&#x27;s release, Travis had recorded a cover of Brook Benton&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Just a Matter of Time&quot; with producer Richard Perry for a covers album titled &quot;Rock, Rhythm &amp; Blues&quot;. Because he liked the sound of the recording, he chose to include it on &quot;No Holdin&#x27; Back&quot; as the album&#x27;s first single. The rendition reached number one on the country charts in December 1989. At the 32nd Annual Grammy Awards, this rendition was nominated for Best Male Country Vocal Performance. After the &quot;It&#x27;s Just a Matter of Time&quot; cover came &quot;Hard Rock Bottom of Your Heart&quot;. Written by Hugh Prestwood, the song held the number one position on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs for four weeks, accounting for Travis&#x27;s longest stay at that position. The third and final single from &quot;No Holdin&#x27; Back&quot; was &quot;He Walked on Water&quot;, which peaked at number two. The song was the first successful cut for songwriter Allen Shamblin. Also included on &quot;No Holdin&#x27; Back&quot; were a cover of Marty Robbins&#x27; &quot;Singing the Blues&quot; and the track &quot;Somewhere in My Broken Heart&quot;, later a single for its co-writer Billy Dean. Thom Jurek&#x27;s review for AllMusic praised Travis&#x27;s vocal deliveries on &quot;It&#x27;s Just a Matter of Time&quot; and &quot;Hard Rock Bottom of Your Heart&quot; while also calling Lehning&#x27;s production &quot;flawless&quot;. In a review for &quot;Cash Box&quot; magazine, Kimmy Wix described &quot;He Walked on Water&quot; as having &quot;detailed lyrics to which we can all relate&quot; and thought the song was well suited for Travis&#x27;s voice.

===19901992: &quot;Heroes &amp; Friends&quot;, &quot;High Lonesome&quot;, and greatest-hits albums===
Travis&#x27;s first album to be released in the 1990s was &quot;Heroes &amp; Friends&quot;, a duets album. Among the duet artists featured were Tammy Wynette, Merle Haggard, George Jones, B. B. King, and Clint Eastwood. According to journalist Gary Graff, Travis had wanted to record a duet album for several years, and he and Hatcher spent over a year and a half arranging for the recording sessions. The album accounted for two singles in &quot;A Few Ole Country Boys&quot; (a duet with Jones) and title track &quot;Heroes and Friends&quot; (the only track on the album not to be a duet). Both songs peaked within the top 10 of the country charts between late 1990 and early 1991. Travis performed &quot;Heroes and Friends&quot; at the 1991 CMA Awards telecast, joined by Jones, Wynette, Vern Gosdin, and Roy Rogers. Unlike his previous albums, &quot;Heroes &amp; Friends&quot; was met with mixed reception from critics. &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot; writer Lee Nichols thought that the album&#x27;s songs were &quot;not particularly notable, but nonetheless enjoyable&quot;. Knight Ridder writer Dan DeLuca (in a review re-published in &quot;The Anniston Star&quot;) praised the duets with Haggard and Jones, and considered the duet version of Dolly Parton&#x27;s &quot;Do I Ever Cross Your Mind&quot; to be the strongest track, although he also panned the contributions of King and Eastwood. In a review for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Alanna Nash thought that &quot;[t]he guests show up more to bolster Travis&#x27;s profile than to actually perform full-out&quot;, although she praised Loretta Lynn&#x27;s duet vocals on &quot;Shopping for Dresses&quot;. Despite the mixed reception, &quot;Heroes &amp; Friends&quot; certified platinum in 1991. Travis also noted that 1990 was the first year in which he did not receive any ACM or CMA awards, but that he was still receiving significant radio airplay and sales, and positive feedback from fans in concert. Relatedly, Mansfield and Colin Larkin both observed that in the early 1990s, Travis&#x27;s success began to diminish as newer artists such as Clint Black and Garth Brooks grew in popularity.

Travis&#x27;s next studio album was 1991&#x27;s &quot;High Lonesome&quot;, led off by the single &quot;Point of Light&quot;. George H. W. Bush, then President of the United States, commissioned Schlitz and Thom Schuyler to write the song as a tie-in to his &quot;thousand points of light&quot; campaign for volunteerism. Because of its inspiration, Travis noted that journalists often asked him about political matters, and he refused to answer them as he did not think the song itself was political. He also performed the song for a number of events intended to honor American soldiers returning from Operation Desert Storm. Next from &quot;High Lonesome&quot; was Travis&#x27;s twelfth number-one, &quot;Forever Together&quot;, one of several songs he wrote with Alan Jackson while the two were on tour together in 1991. These collaborations also produced the album&#x27;s next two singles &quot;Better Class of Losers&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;d Surrender All&quot; between late 1991 and early 1992, as well as Jackson&#x27;s number one single &quot;She&#x27;s Got the Rhythm (And I Got the Blues)&quot; later in 1992. Jackson also co-wrote the track &quot;Allergic to the Blues&quot;, while Travis wrote &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Have a Little Talk&quot; (featuring backing vocals from gospel group Take 6) and &quot;Oh, What a Time to Be Me&quot;. Travis noted that the project contained more songs written by him than his previous ones did. Jurek praised the Jackson co-writes in particular, highlighting their lyrics and vocal deliveries in his review for AllMusic. Nash also praised the lyrics on the songs co-written by Jackson, while also stating that Travis &quot;never sounded so relaxed or so confident&quot;.

Later the same year, Warner released a pair of greatest hits albums: &quot;Greatest Hits, Volume One&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits, Volume Two&quot;. In addition to featuring most of his hit singles to this point, the projects also included four new tracks and the album cut &quot;Reasons I Cheat&quot; from &quot;Storms of Life&quot;. Among the new tracks, &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Have You&quot; and &quot;Look Heart, No Hands&quot; both went to number one upon release as singles that year. Skip Ewing and Max D. Barnes wrote the former, while Trey Bruce and Russell Smith wrote the latter. Despite these songs&#x27; successes on radio, their follow-up &quot;An Old Pair of Shoes&quot; reached number 21 upon release in early 1993. Both greatest-hits albums certified platinum in 1995.

===19921995: &quot;Wind in the Wire&quot; and &quot;This Is Me&quot;===
Travis took a hiatus from touring in 1992 and 1993, citing exhaustion as the reason for doing so. He and Hatcher chose to spend time at a property in Maui they had acquired. According to Travis, the touring hiatus caused some fans and news reporters to believe he had retired, so he asked his publicists to put out press releases indicating he was &quot;merely taking a break&quot;. During the hiatus, he released an album of Western music titled &quot;Wind in the Wire&quot;, a tie-in to a television movie of the same name in which he starred. The album was produced by session guitarist Steve Gibson, making it his first since the Randy Ray album not to be produced by Kyle Lehning. It was commercially unsuccessful, with none of its singles reaching top 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. However, lead single &quot;Cowboy Boogie&quot; reached number 10 on the Canadian country music charts then published by &quot;RPM&quot;. Travis and one of his managers later attributed the album&#x27;s commercial failure to its Western swing sound proving unpopular with radio.

In late 1993, Travis began working on a follow-up album with Lehning when he was contacted by a representative for the then-under construction MGM Grand Las Vegas in Las Vegas, Nevada. The representative wanted Travis to be the first country artist to perform at the new venue once it opened, which inspired Travis to begin touring again. He and Hatcher joined with Jeff Davis, another former manager of Travis&#x27;s who was then working with Brother Phelps, to assemble a backing band for the Las Vegas shows, which included Lehning as keyboardist. The Las Vegas shows, held in early 1994, were his first concerts in over 14 months. Due to the success of these shows, Travis resumed his touring schedule soon afterward. He re-established his existing touring band and performed at a showcase of Warner Bros. artists held in Nashville during the Country Radio Seminar, an annual promotional concert series held by Country Radio Broadcasters. At the same time, Travis continued writing and compiling songs for his next studio album. &quot;Before You Kill Us All&quot; was released on February 28, 1994, as the lead single to his next Warner album &quot;This Is Me&quot;. The song peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts. Travis and Lehning chose the song because the two wanted &quot;story songs and some with a wink of humor&quot;. Similarly, he told &quot;Billboard&quot; in 1994 that the song was an example of a more modern and &quot;rowdy&quot; sound he wanted to achieve relative to his prior albums. It was followed later in the year by &quot;Whisper My Name&quot;, his fifteenth number-one on &quot;Billboard&quot;. The album&#x27;s title track and &quot;The Box&quot; were both top-ten hits between late 1994 and early 1995 as well. Travis wrote &quot;The Box&quot; with Buck Moore and later said he became emotional writing and performing the song, as its theme of a father struggling to express love to his children reminded him of his own &quot;fractured&quot; relationship with his father.

Bob Saporiti, then an executive at Warner Bros. Nashville, noted that the failure of &quot;Wind in the Wire&quot; and length of time since &quot;High Lonesome&quot; had created &quot;angst&quot; among label executives, but added that they considered &quot;This Is Me&quot; &quot;back to the basics&quot;. To promote the album, Travis hosted an episode of the TNN talk show &quot;Music City Tonight&quot;; the network also re-aired the Country Radio Seminar concert. Jurek praised the lyrical contributions of Trey Bruce, Larry Gatlin, and Kieran Kane, and considered &quot;Whisper My Name&quot; to be &quot;among the greatest songs Travis has ever recorded&quot;. Nash thought that the lyrics of the singles were among Travis&#x27;s strongest, also stating that the album had &quot;zippier instrumental touches&quot; than his 1980s albums. Additionally, Larkin stated that the album was &quot;as strong as ever&quot;. By mid-1994, &quot;This Is Me&quot; was certified gold by the RIAA. Despite spending most of 1995 without a charted single, Travis continued to tour throughout the year alongside Sammy Kershaw and George Jones.

===19961997: &quot;Full Circle&quot;===

Travis&#x27;s final album for Warner was &quot;Full Circle&quot; in 1996. Travis told &quot;Billboard&quot; prior to its release that he and Lehning spent over a year selecting songs for the album because they wanted to be sure they were fully satisfied with its content. Its lead single was &quot;Are We in Trouble Now&quot;, a song written by Mark Knopfler. Both this song and follow-up &quot;Would I&quot; failed to reach the top 20 on the country charts, while neither &quot;Price to Pay&quot; nor a cover of Roger Miller&#x27;s &quot;King of the Road&quot; (which also appeared on the soundtrack of the 1997 movie &quot;Traveller&quot;) made top 40. &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; writer Gordon Ely noted the failure of the album&#x27;s lead single and questioned whether the album and Travis in general could still be successful in the long term, due to an influx of younger artists in the intervening years. Ely considered the album &quot;strong as ever&quot;, with a focus on Lehning&#x27;s production and Travis&#x27;s voice, as well as the lyrics of &quot;Price to Pay&quot;. Country Standard Time writer Don Yates found the influence of honky-tonk in certain songs and praised the lyrics and vocal delivery of &quot;Are We in Trouble Now&quot;, but criticized &quot;Would I&quot; as &quot;gimmicky&quot; and closing track &quot;Ants on a Log&quot; as &quot;trite&quot;. AllMusic writer Thom Owens said of &quot;Full Circle&quot;, &quot;his mid-&#x27;90s albums suffered from a tendency to sound a bit too similar to each other. &quot;Full Circle&quot; solves that problem by simultaneously reaching back into his hardcore honky-tonk roots and moving toward more contemporary material&quot;.

In mid-1997, Travis announced that he had departed from Warner Bros. due to disagreements over the promotion of &quot;Full Circle&quot;, as well as concerns that the country music industry was beginning to move toward back country pop influences. Additionally, Hatcher thought that Warner executives were not allowing her, Travis, and Lehning to have as much liberty on selecting singles as they had on previous albums. At the time of his departure from Warner, Travis was offered contracts by the Nashville divisions of both Asylum Records and the then-new DreamWorks Records. Lehning had just become president of Asylum Records&#x27;s Nashville division at the time, but Travis chose not to follow him to that label as he did not think Lehning&#x27;s position was long-term.

===19971999: DreamWorks Records===
By August 1997, Travis had become the first artist signed to DreamWorks Records&#x27;s Nashville division. The new label&#x27;s president was musician and producer James Stroud, whom Travis knew because he had played drums on some of his earlier singles such as &quot;Forever and Ever, Amen&quot;. Because Lehning&#x27;s duties as president of Asylum left him temporarily unavailable as a producer, Stroud and Byron Gallimore (best known for his work with Tim McGraw) produced Travis&#x27;s music for DreamWorks. Travis&#x27;s late-1997 single &quot;Out of My Bones&quot; was the first release for DreamWorks Nashville. Co-written by Gary Burr and Sharon Vaughn, it peaked at number two on the country charts in early 1998. It appeared on his first DreamWorks album &quot;You and You Alone&quot;, issued in April. The project also accounted for the top-ten hits &quot;The Hole&quot; and &quot;Spirit of a Boy, Wisdom of a Man&quot; and the top-20 &quot;Stranger in My Mirror&quot;. Both &quot;The Hole&quot; and &quot;Stranger in My Mirror&quot; were co-written by Skip Ewing. &quot;Spirit of a Boy, Wisdom of a Man&quot; was previously recorded by Mark Collie on his 1995 album &quot;Tennessee Plates&quot;. Jeffrey B. Remz of Country Standard Time criticized the heavy drums on &quot;I Did My Part&quot;, but otherwise praised the use of acoustic instruments and the strength of Travis&#x27;s voice. &quot;Lincoln Journal Star&quot; writer L. Kent Wolgamott noted the presence of fiddle and steel guitar in the production while also calling Travis&#x27;s voice &quot;expressive&quot;.

In 1999, Travis was one of several artists on the collaborative song &quot;Same Old Train&quot;, featured on the multi-artist album &quot;Tribute to Tradition&quot;. Other acts appearing on the song included Clint Black, Dwight Yoakam, Pam Tillis, and Marty Stuart, the last of whom also wrote and produced it. The track won a Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals for all artists involved. Travis&#x27;s second and final DreamWorks album &quot;A Man Ain&#x27;t Made of Stone&quot; also came out in 1999. The title track (also co-written by Burr) was a top-20 country hit by year&#x27;s end, but the other singles&quot;Where Can I Surrender&quot;, &quot;A Little Left of Center&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Right Here Loving You&quot;all failed to reach top 40. Gallimore and Stroud recorded the album largely in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where Travis and Hatcher had a house at the time. Following the failure of the album&#x27;s singles, Travis exited DreamWorks Records in October 2000. Shortly after his departure, Travis said in an interview with Country Standard Time that he chose to leave DreamWorks because he felt the label was not properly distributing the album to stores. He also thought that Stroud&#x27;s production style put too much emphasis on the instrumentation instead of his singing voice.

===20002003: Switch to gospel and &quot;Three Wooden Crosses&quot;===

While he was still on Warner, Travis had begun working with Lehning on a gospel music album. Other than a cover of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, the two intentionally sought to include original content. Travis finished the tracks at a time when he was not on a record label. Through a connection Lehning had with Word Records executive Barry Landis, Travis was signed to that label in late 2000 and released the gospel album, by then titled &quot;Inspirational Journey&quot;. Waylon Jennings and Jessi Colter provided guest vocals on the track &quot;The Carpenter&quot;. Kenny Chesney sang duet vocals on the track &quot;Baptism&quot; (also titled &quot;Down with the Old Man (Up with the New)&quot;), which served as the first single. The two had previously recorded the track on Chesney&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Everywhere We Go&quot;. &quot;Inspirational Journey&quot; won Travis two Dove Awards in 2001: Bluegrass Album of the Year for the album itself, and Country Recorded Song of the Year for &quot;Baptism&quot;. AllMusic reviewer Todd Everett found influences of bluegrass, Don Williams, and Lefty Frizzell, and found it consistent with Travis&#x27;s 1980s and 1990s albums in tone. Alanna Nash of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; was less favorable, as she thought that the album had strong opening tracks but added that &quot;midway, it deteriorates into Nashville formula, with simplistic homilies [and] overblown production&quot;.

Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, Travis co-wrote and released a promotional patriotic single titled &quot;America Will Always Stand&quot;. Proceeds from sales of the single were donated to the American Red Cross. He continued to record on Word Records as a gospel artist and put out his next album for the label, &quot;Rise and Shine&quot;, in late 2002. The album&#x27;s lead single was &quot;Three Wooden Crosses&quot;. According to Travis, songwriters Kim Williams and Doug Johnson had provided the song to Michael Peterson, who at the time was recording material with Lehning. Peterson suggested Lehning take the song to Travis, for whom he thought it was better suited. By early 2003, &quot;Three Wooden Crosses&quot; became Travis&#x27;s sixteenth and final number-one on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs. It also accounted for his highest solo peak on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 31. The project charted one other single in &quot;Pray for the Fish&quot;, which fell below top 40 on the country charts. Robert L. Doerschuk of AllMusic called the album &quot;a strong performance, presented with flawless studio clarity and persuasive, understated feeling.&quot; Remz noted the consistency of Lehning&#x27;s production and Travis&#x27;s voice, as well as the presence of original songs co-written by Travis. In October 2003, &quot;Rise and Shine&quot; was certified gold. At the 2004 Grammy Awards, &quot;Rise and Shine&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Southern, Country or Bluegrass Gospel Album, while &quot;Three Wooden Crosses&quot; was nominated for Best Male Country Vocal Performance. That same year, &quot;Pray for the Fish&quot; won a Dove Award for Country Recorded Song of the Year.

===20032007: Continued gospel albums===
His next gospel album was 2003&#x27;s &quot;Worship &amp; Faith&quot;. Unlike the previous projects, it included 20 acoustic covers of existing praise songs and hymns. Among the tracks included were &quot;In the Garden&quot;, &quot;How Great Thou Art&quot;, &quot;Peace in the Valley&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Fly Away&quot;. Jurek called the album &quot;direct, unfiltered, hard-line gospel at its best, by a master&quot; in a review for AllMusic. &quot;Worship &amp; Faith&quot; also became a gold album, and accounted for his second consecutive Grammy Award for Best Southern, Country or Bluegrass Gospel Album. A year later he released &quot;Passing Through&quot;. This album accounted for his last solo chart singles until 2024, &quot;Four Walls&quot; and &quot;Angels&quot;. The latter was Travis&#x27;s 50th entry on the chart. Co-writers on the album included Jamie O&#x27;Hara, Dennis Linde, Sharon Vaughn, and Travis. &quot;Four Walls&quot; was previously cut by Keith Harling, while the album track &quot;That Was Us&quot; was previously recorded by both Tracy Lawrence and Chad Brock, whose version was a single in 2003. Erlewine wrote of &quot;Passing Through&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s inspirational music in the purest senseit doesn&#x27;t preach, it instructs and inspires through its carefully observed tales.&quot; Travis received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in September 2004.

In 2005, Travis released another gospel album, &quot;Glory Train: Songs of Faith, Worship, and Praise&quot;. It, too, won a Grammy Award for Best Southern, Country or Bluegrass Gospel Album. Some tracks on the project included backing vocals from the Blind Boys of Alabama. Unlike the previous albums, it contained a mix of Black spirituals and contemporary Christian music such as Darlene Zschech&#x27;s &quot;Shout to the Lord&quot;. Erlewine thought the inclusion of such material made it &quot;Travis&#x27;s best gospel album to date&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;, Nick Marino praised Travis&#x27;s &quot;bluesy&quot; vocals and the variety of songs. Altogether, Travis&#x27;s first four gospel albums each won the Dove Award for Country Album of the Year, accounting for a streak of four consecutive wins in that category from 2003 to 2006. Also in 2006, Travis began recording footage for a Christmas DVD titled &quot;Christmas on the Pecos&quot;. This footage consisted of him singing Christmas songs and reading Helen Steiner Rice&#x27;s poem &quot;The Christmas Guest&quot; inside the Big Room, a cavern at Carlsbad Caverns National Park. Some of the performances also included vocal accompaniment from the choir of the Carlsbad First Baptist Church. The DVD was released in late 2006. Another Christmas project, the album &quot;Songs of the Season&quot;, followed in 2007.

===20082011: Return to Warner and Carrie Underwood version of &quot;I Told You So&quot;===
In 2008, he released his next studio album &quot;Around the Bend&quot;. The project was his first country music release since &quot;A Man Ain&#x27;t Made of Stone&quot;. The album also placed him back on Warner, which had been a distributor of his Word Records releases. Travis promoted the album in an interview with WSM-FM radio host Bill Cody. He also released its lead single &quot;Faith in You&quot; as a free download from his website. &quot;Dig Two Graves&quot; was the project&#x27;s second single. In addition to these songs, the album included a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Think Twice, It&#x27;s All Right&quot;. Jeff DeDekker of &quot;The Leader-Post&quot; noted that while it was not marketed as a Christian album, individual songs still held themes of &quot;redemption and the afterlife&quot;. He praised the lyrics of &quot;Dig Two Graves&quot; and Travis&#x27;s singing voice in particular. Erlewine criticized the use of a string section on &quot;Faith in You&quot;, but otherwise reviewed the album&#x27;s song selection and Travis&#x27;s voice with favor. Despite not being explicitly marketed as a Christian album, it won Travis his eighth and final Dove Award, in the category of Country Album of the Year.

Carrie Underwood recorded a cover of &quot;I Told You So&quot; on her late-2007 album &quot;Carnival Ride&quot;. Her version was released in January 2009 as the album&#x27;s fifth single. Two months after her rendition was released to radio, disc jockey Jesse Tack at WUBE-FM in Cincinnati, Ohio combined Underwood&#x27;s recording with the vocal track from Travis&#x27;s original and distributed the results to 75 other radio stations. Due to the popularity of the combined recording with radio listeners, Underwood and Travis performed the song together on &quot;American Idol&quot; soon after. The two also recorded an official duet version, which was sent to radio as well. With both Travis and Underwood receiving chart credit, the duet version of &quot;I Told You So&quot; peaked at number two on the country charts in 2009, and accounted for Travis&#x27;s highest overall &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 peak of number nine. The duet won both artists the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals.

Travis continued to record for Warner at the time. To honor the 25th anniversary of &quot;Storms of Life&quot;, he released &quot;Anniversary Celebration&quot; in 2011. The album consisted entirely of collaborations, on both re-recordings of Travis&#x27;s previous singles and new songs. Among the artists involved were Zac Brown Band (&quot;Forever and Ever, Amen&quot;), Kenny Chesney (&quot;He Walked on Water&quot;), and Jamey Johnson (&quot;A Few Ole Country Boys&quot;). Alan Jackson contributed to a medley of Travis&#x27;s &quot;Better Class of Losers&quot; and Jackson&#x27;s &quot;She&#x27;s Got the Rhythm (And I Got the Blues)&quot;, both of which the two co-wrote. George Jones, Lorrie Morgan, Ray Price, Connie Smith, Joe Stampley, and Gene Watson all provided vocals to the track &quot;Didn&#x27;t We Shine&quot;. Karlie Justus of Country Standard Time highlighted these tracks in particular among the strongest.

===20132018: Stroke and subsequent career===
In July 2013, Travis experienced difficulty breathing while working out at his home gym. He was hospitalized in Dallas, Texas, for viral cardiomyopathy. While undergoing treatment, Travis suffered congestive heart failure and a stroke. The stroke affected the left side of Travis&#x27;s brain, impacting movement on the right side of his body. Travis was placed on life support after the infection caused his lungs to collapse, and was declared to have a one percent chance of survival. The infection, subsequent stroke, and three separate bouts of pneumonia led to Travis undergoing three tracheostomies and two brain surgeries. He also suffered aphasia, lost the ability to speak and sing, and had vision problems. These issues were mitigated through years of therapy. While the stroke largely left him unable to sing or speak, he soon began recovering. According to Taste of Country, within a year of the stroke, he was able to walk short distances without assistance, and was re-learning to write and to play guitar.

Despite his stroke, Travis released a pair of previously-recorded cover song projects between late 2013 and early 2014. The first was &quot;Influence Vol. 1: The Man I Am&quot;. Among the covers were Lefty Frizzell&#x27;s &quot;Saginaw, Michigan&quot;, Ernest Tubb&#x27;s &quot;Thanks a Lot&quot;, and George Jones&#x27;s &quot;Why Baby Why&quot;. The only track on the album not to be a cover was &quot;Tonight I&#x27;m Playin&#x27; Possum&quot;, a duet with Joe Nichols. Remz noted that many of the cover songs chosen were written or performed by Merle Haggard, and spoke favorably of Lehning&#x27;s &quot;low-key&quot; production. The second volume of this project, &quot;Influence Vol. 2: The Man I Am&quot;, followed in 2014. Like the first volume, it included covers from Haggard, Tubb, and Frizzell, as well as Kris Kristofferson and Waylon Jennings. Erlewine said of this project, &quot;he makes it sound easy when you know damn well it isn&#x27;t.&quot; In 2015, he made a guest appearance at the Academy of Country Music awards ceremony, where Lee Brice paid tribute to him by singing &quot;Forever and Ever, Amen&quot;.

In 2016, Travis was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, and sang &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; at the induction ceremony. The same year, he appeared in the music video for &quot;Forever Country&quot;, a multi-artist medley of &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot;, &quot;On the Road Again&quot;, and &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; done to honor the 50th anniversary of the Country Music Association. Although he had begun appearing in public again at this point, his speech remained limited and he was confined to a wheelchair. Despite the limitations, Travis appeared onstage with singer Michael Ray during a cover performance of &quot;Forever and Ever, Amen&quot; in June 2017. He did the same during his 60th birthday party, hosted by the Grand Ole Opry on May 4, 2019.

===2019present: Return to touring, &quot;Precious Memories&quot;, and artificial intelligence===
In September 2019, Travis announced his return to touring. The tour features James Dupré as lead vocalist singing with Travis&#x27;s backing band. Travis selected Dupré after seeing him perform on &quot;The Voice&quot;. During these shows, Travis makes selected appearances throughout, which include singing the final &quot;Amen&quot; at the end of &quot;Forever and Ever, Amen&quot;. Announced as a twelve-city tour, the first performances with Dupré cut back to three concerts shortly before the tour began in October &quot;due to unexpected production and technical issues related to the elaborate content of the show,&quot; with the intent to reschedule the canceled shows after the technical problems were resolved. Dupré has continued to tour with Travis as of 2025, in a tour known as the More Life Tour.

Travis released &quot;Precious Memories (Worship &amp; Faith)&quot; through Gaither Music, a label owned by gospel singer Bill Gaither, in February 2020. The project contains 12 songs that were recorded in 2003 at the Calvary Assembly of God Church in Orlando, Florida. This was followed four months later by a new single titled &quot;Fool&#x27;s Love Affair&quot;, consisting of a demo recording he had done in the early 1980s. In April 2024, Travis posted to TikTok a clip of a new song titled &quot;Where That Came From&quot;, his first new studio recording since the stroke. The song was released to country radio soon afterward. CBS News correspondence revealed that Lehning created the song with voice cloning technology, wherein he used an artificial intelligence program to re-create Travis&#x27;s voice. The program was trained on 42 recordings of Travis&#x27;s voice and composited over an existing recording of the song Dupré had cut in 2011. &quot;Where That Came From&quot; made the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts a month after its release, peaking at number 45. A second song, &quot;Horses in Heaven&quot;, followed in January 2025. This song&#x27;s vocal track was created through the same voice cloning technology as &quot;Where That Came From,&quot; but with a newly recorded vocal bed featuring four singers. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Travis dedicated the song to victims of the 2025 Potomac River mid-air collision.

==Musical style==
Travis is noted as a key figure in the neotraditional country movement, a shift in mainstream country music sound toward a more traditional style after the country pop crossovers of the early 1980s. Brian Mansfield wrote in AllMusic that &quot;At a time when most were still pursuing the pop-oriented sound of the &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot; craze, Travis&#x27;s strong, honest vocal style and relatable songs of everyday life helped launch the New Traditionalist movement&quot;. In the &quot;Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music&quot;, Colin Larkin wrote that Travis &quot;was the first modern performer to demonstrate that country music could appeal to a wider public, and perhaps Garth Brooks owes him a debt.&quot; Alanna Nash similarly stated that Travis was a &quot;standard bearer&quot; for the genre&#x27;s shift toward neotraditional country through later acts such as Brooks and Clint Black, whom she stated &quot;immediately began to surpass Travis at the awards shows and in record stores.&quot; Regarding his physical appearance, Gary Graff stated that &quot;his hunkish, weight-pumping good looks have established a physical sexuality that had been missing from many of country&#x27;s male stars.&quot;

Writing for AllMusic, Mansfield found influences of Merle Haggard and George Jones in Travis&#x27;s singing voice, and Mark A. Humphrey compared his voice to Lefty Frizzell on the same site. Nash called his voice a &quot;glass-rattling baritone&quot;. Cusic found influences of Waylon Jennings and Ernest Tubb in tracks from &quot;Storms of Life&quot;, highlighting conventionally country lyrical themes of &quot;lost love&quot; in &quot;1982&quot; and infidelity in &quot;Reasons I Cheat&quot;. Critics have also noted Lehning&#x27;s long-time role as Travis&#x27;s producer, with Jurek stating in a review of &quot;High Lonesome&quot; that the &quot;production is unobtrusive and clean, setting Travis in perfect balance with a band that feels live.&quot; In a review for Country Standard Time, Karlie Justus referred to Travis as having a &quot;trademark baritone&quot; and &quot;steel [guitar]-laced, storytelling catalog.&quot; Robert L. Doerschuk said that Travis has a &quot;familiar unforced, relaxed style&quot;. Reviewing &quot;You and You Alone&quot;, Jeffrey B. Remz wrote that &quot;He generally remains tried and true to his roots dishing out ballads with his usual great vocal phrasing...Travis doesn&#x27;t rush through the songs, delivering them in a passionate, understated singing style&quot;. Of his shift to gospel music at the beginning of the 21st century, Erlewine wrote that such albums were &quot;fruitful, producing a series of good, heartfelt records, yet they also had a nice side effect of putting commercialism way on the back burner, as the gospel albums were made without the charts in mind&quot;.

Travis has been cited as an influence on later generations of singers. Travis and Hatcher booked Daryle Singletary as an opening act and member of their touring band after hearing his vocals on the demo of &quot;An Old Pair of Shoes&quot;, and he would often join Travis in this capacity to sing &quot;It&#x27;s Just a Matter of Time&quot;. After Singletary signed a recording contract with Giant Records in 1995, Travis co-produced Singletary&#x27;s self-titled debut album. Nash referred to Singletary as a &quot;protégé&quot; of Travis&#x27;s with a &quot;sonorous baritone&quot;. Josh Turner cites Travis as an influence, and said that &quot;Diggin&#x27; Up Bones&quot; was the first song he performed in public. The two collaborated in 2006 on the show &quot;CMT Cross Country&quot;. Travis contributed a guest vocal to Turner&#x27;s cover of &quot;Forever and Ever, Amen&quot; on his 2020 covers album &quot;Country State of Mind&quot;. Turner and Chris Janson both cited &quot;Diggin&#x27; Up Bones&quot; as an influence when interviewed for a 2017 tribute concert. Justus also noted Turner as a successor to Travis in a review of &quot;Anniversary Celebration&quot;, where she also thought the themes of musical aspiration in &quot;A Few Ole Country Boys&quot;, originally a duet with George Jones, were a &quot;full circle moment&quot; when Travis sang the same song with Jamey Johnson.

==Acting==

Travis made his acting debut in 1988 with an uncredited cameo in the Emilio Estevez movie &quot;Young Guns&quot;. Although most of his part was cut from the final movie, he sang the title track to the movie&#x27;s soundtrack. He began acting on television in the early 1990s when he was cast as a house painter in an episode of &quot;Matlock&quot;. A year later he starred in the television movie &quot;Wind in the Wire&quot; which aired on ABC. His album of the same name is a soundtrack to the movie. Travis&#x27;s acting roles would continue into the mid-1990s with such films as &quot;Frank and Jesse&quot; and &quot;Maverick&quot;. In late 1995, he and Rue McClanahan starred in the CBS television movie &quot;A Holiday to Remember&quot;. Before the movie&#x27;s release, Travis stated that the appearance on &quot;Matlock&quot; earlier in the decade was what inspired him to take on more acting roles, and that &quot;A Holiday to Remember&quot; was one of his first roles not related to the Western genre. Coinciding with the release of &quot;You and You Alone&quot;, Travis starred alongside Patrick Swayze in the film &quot;Black Dog&quot;, playing the role of a country music singer. In turn, Swayze sang backing vocals on &quot;I Did My Part&quot;, an album track on &quot;You and You Alone&quot;. In February 2024, Travis appeared as a special guest on an episode of the game show &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;.

==Personal life==
Travis and Hatcher lived together for several years at early points in their career. The couple secretly married on May 31, 1991 and bought a house on Maui soon afterward. Because of the secrecy of their marriage and the relocation to Maui, Travis later noted that many fans theorized he was gay and had contracted HIV/AIDS. In early 1991, the tabloid &quot;National Enquirer&quot; ran an article alleging that Travis was gay. In response, Travis considered suing the publication until a lawyer convinced him otherwise. Journalist Michael Corcoran noted that their marriage was seen as controversial at first, due both to its initial secrecy and the fact that Hatcher was 18 years older than Travis. Travis and Hatcher divorced in October 2010, citing incompatibility. Despite this, Hatcher continued to serve as his manager at the time. After a period of engagement, he married Mary Davis on March 21, 2015. The couple reside at Chrysalis Ranch, a property they own near Tioga, Texas. Davis tended to Travis&#x27;s medical needs during his stroke in 2013, and has made public appearances on his behalf to compensate for his limited speech.

Several incidents in which the singer became publicly intoxicated were reported in the early 2010s. Travis was arrested in February 2012, when he was found in a parked car outside a church in Sanger, Texas, with an open bottle of wine and smelling of alcohol. On August 7, 2012, state troopers in Grayson County, Texas, responded to a call that an unclothed man was lying in the road. Troopers reported that they arrived to find Travis unclothed and smelling of alcohol. The Texas Highway Patrol said that Travis crashed his car in a construction zone, and that when they attempted to apprehend him, the singer threatened their lives. Travis was subsequently arrested for driving under the influence and making terroristic threats against a public servant. He posted bail in the amount of $21,500. Travis filed a lawsuit to block the release of police dashcam video of the incident. After a five-year legal battle, a judge ruled that the video did not violate his right to privacy; it was released to the public in December 2017.

==Awards==

Travis has won seven Grammy Awards, six CMA Awards, and eleven ACM awards.

<text>Jamieson &quot;Junior&quot; Brown (born June 12, 1952) is an American country guitarist and singer. He has released twelve studio albums in his career, and has charted twice on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles charts. Brown&#x27;s signature instrument is the &quot;guit-steel&quot; double neck guitar, a hybrid of electric guitar and lap steel guitar.

==Life and career==
Brown was born in Cottonwood, Arizona; at an early age his family moved to Kirksville, Indiana. He first learned to play piano from his father (Samuel Emmons Brown Jr.) &quot;before I could talk&quot;. His music career began in the 1960s, and he worked through that decade and the next singing and playing pedal steel and guitar for groups such as The Last Mile Ramblers, Dusty Drapes and the Dusters, Billy Spears and Asleep at the Wheel while developing his guitar skills. In the early 1980s, he appeared on stage with Rank and File as the replacement for Alejandro Escovedo. However, he did not feature on any recordings by that band.

By the mid-1980s, Brown was teaching guitar at the Hank Thompson School of Country Music at Rogers State University, in Claremore, Oklahoma.

In 1985, Brown created a new type of double-neck guitar, with some assistance from Michael Stevens. Brown called the instrument his &quot;guit-steel&quot;. When performing, Brown plays the guitar by standing behind it, while it rests on a small music stand. The top neck on the guit-steel is a traditional six-string guitar, while the lower neck is a full-size lap steel guitar for slide playing. Brown has two guit-steels for recording and live work. The original instrument, dubbed &quot;Old Yeller&quot;, has as its standard six-string guitar portion the neck and pickups from Brown&#x27;s previous stage guitar, a Fender Bullet. The second guit-steel, named &quot;Big Red&quot;, has a neck laser-copied from the Bullet neck; but in addition to electric guitar pickups, both the standard and lap-steel necks use identical Sho-Bud lap-steel pickups. There is a pocket in the upper bout of the guitar to hold the slide bar when it is not in use. Brown also commissioned a &quot;pedal guit-steel&quot; which adds pedals to the instrument for more musical control. Brown has stated that the invention of the guit-steel was always a matter of convenience so that he could play both lap steel and lead guitar during live performances and not directly motivated by a desire to be a &quot;one man band&quot;.
Brown quickly became a local success in Austin, Texas, as the house band at the Continental Club. His debut album was &quot;12 Shades of Brown&quot; (1990), released by the British Demon Records; it was re-released in 1993 on Curb Records in the United States, followed by &quot;Guit with It&quot;. In 1996, Brown released &quot;Semi Crazy&quot;, and followed it with &quot;Long Walk Back&quot; (1998).

In 1996, Brown was featured on the Beach Boys&#x27; now out-of-print album &quot;Stars and Stripes Vol. 1&quot; performing a cover of their 1962 hit &quot;409&quot;. The song features Brown playing guitar and singing lead with the Beach Boys singing harmonies and backing vocals.

Brown appeared in the music video for &quot;Honky Tonk Song&quot; by George Jones in 1996 and also won the CMA Country Music Video of the Year award that year for his video, &quot;My Wife Thinks You&#x27;re Dead&quot;, which featured 6-foot-7-inch Gwendolyn Gillingham. Brown played a cameo part in &quot;Drive&quot;, the second episode of season six of &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Brown&#x27;s music has been showcased on various television series and movie soundtracks, including &quot;Me, Myself &amp; Irene&quot;, &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; and the 2005 &quot;Dukes of Hazzard&quot; remake, in which he also played the narrator.

Although Brown plays such neotraditional country styles as honky-tonk, Western swing, etc., some of his performances will finish with some blues and Tex-Mex tunes playing as well as surf rock instrumentals.

Beginning in August 2006, Brown joined Webb Wilder&#x27;s tour of American minor league baseball stadiums. He reprised his role in an episode (&quot;World of Hurt, BC&quot;) of Adult Swim&#x27;s &quot;&quot; created by rock band PFFR. In April 2008, Brown shot three pilot episodes of a country music program modeled after programs from the early 1960s, in which Brown will play with a house band as well as guests as host of the show. On October 12, 2012, Brown released the EP &quot;Volume 10&quot;, containing six new songs.

AMC previewed the video of his new song &quot;Better Call Saul&quot;, on October 5, 2014. On May 24, 2018, Brown released his 11th album, &quot;Deep in the Heart Of Me&quot;.

On October 6, 2019, Junior Brown&#x27;s &quot;guit-steel&quot; guitar, along with his wife&#x27;s Shenandoah acoustic guitar, was reported as stolen from a vehicle parked at a hotel in North Attleboro, Massachusetts near Providence, Rhode Island. Brown and his wife had been in the area visiting relatives.

On May 27, 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s listing of 50 Country Albums Every Rock Fan Should Own, honored Brown’s US released album, &quot;12 Shades of Brown&quot; (Curb Records, 1993).

In May 2020, Brown and his wife began hosting a series of live Facebook concerts under the name, &quot;The Junior &amp; Tanya Rae Brown Show&quot;.

<doc id="169983" wikidata="Q4922415" url="?curid=169983" title="Black people and early Mormonism">
<text>Early Mormonism had a range of doctrines related to race with regards to Black people of African descent. References to Black people, their social condition during the 19th and 20th centuries, and their spiritual place in Western Christianity as well as in Mormon scripture were complicated.

From the beginning, Black people have been members of Mormon congregations and Mormon congregations have always been interracial. When the Mormons migrated to Missouri, they encountered the pro-slavery sentiments of their neighbors. Joseph Smith upheld the laws regarding Black enslavement, and affirmed the curse of Ham as placing his descendants into slavery, &quot;to the shame and confusion of all who have cried out against the South.&quot; After the Mormons were expelled from Missouri, Smith took an increasingly strong anti-slavery position, and several Black men were ordained to the LDS priesthood.

==New York era (1820s and early 1830s)==

The first reference to dark skin as a curse and mark from God in Latter Day Saint writings can be found in the Book of Mormon, published in 1830. It refers to a group of people called the Lamanites and states that when they rebelled against God they were cursed with &quot;a skin of blackness&quot; ().

The mark of blackness was placed upon the Lamanites so the Nephites &quot;might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction&quot; (). The Book of Mormon records the Lord as forbidding miscegenation between Lamanites and Nephites () and saying they were to stay &quot;separated from thee and thy seed [Nephites], from this time henceforth and forever, except they repent of their wickedness and turn to me that I may have mercy upon them&quot; ().

However, states: &quot;[The Lord] inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come, black and white, bond and free, male and female...and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile.&quot; Although the Lamanites are labelled as wicked, they actually became more righteous than the Nephites as time passed ().

Throughout the Book of Mormon narrative, several groups of Lamanites did repent and lose the curse. The Anti-Nephi-Lehies or Ammonites &quot;open[ed] a correspondence with them [Nephites], and the curse of God did no more follow them&quot; (). There is no reference to their skin color being changed. Later, the Book of Mormon records that an additional group of Lamanites converted and that &quot;their curse was taken from them, and their skin became white like unto the Nephites… and they were numbered among the Nephites, and were called Nephites&quot; ().

The curse was also put on others who rebelled. One group of Nephites, called Amlicites &quot;had come out in open rebellion against God; therefore it was expedient that the curse should fall upon them&quot;. () The Amlicites then put a mark upon themselves. At this point, the author stops the narrative to say &quot;I would that ye should see that they brought upon themselves the curse; and even so doth every man that is cursed bring upon himself his own condemnation.&quot;() Eventually, the Lamanites &quot;had become, the more part of them, a righteous people, insomuch that their righteousness did exceed that of the Nephites, because of their firmness and their steadiness in the faith.&quot; ()

The &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; did not countenance any form of curse-based discrimination. It stated that the Lord &quot;denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile&quot;. (). In fact, prejudice against people of dark skin was condemned more than once, as in this example:
O my brethren, I fear that unless ye shall repent of your sins that their skins will be whiter than yours, when ye shall be brought with them before the throne of God. Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, which is the word of God, that ye revile no more against them because of the darkness of their skins; neither shall ye revile against them because of their filthiness... ().

==Missouri era (early 1830s to 1838)==
In the summer of 1833 W. W. Phelps published an article in the church&#x27;s newspaper, seeming to invite free Black people into the state to become Mormons, and reflecting &quot;in connection with the wonderful events of this age, much is doing towards abolishing slavery, and colonizing the blacks, in Africa.&quot; Outrage followed Phelps&#x27; comments, (Roberts [1930] 1965, p. 378.) and he was forced to reverse his position, which he claimed was &quot;misunderstood&quot;, but this reversal did not end the controversy, and the Mormons were violently expelled from Jackson County, Missouri five months later in December 1833.

In 1835, the Church issued an official statement indicating that because the United States government allowed Black enslavement, the Church would not &quot;interfere with bond-servants, neither preach the gospel to, nor baptize them contrary to the will and wish of their masters, nor meddle with or influence them in the least to cause them to be dissatisfied with their situations in this life, thereby jeopardizing the lives of men.&quot; (D&amp;C ).

On February 6, 1835, an assistant president of the church, W. W. Phelps, wrote a letter theorizing that the curse of Cain survived the deluge by passing through the wife of Ham, son of Noah, who according to Phelps was a descendant of Cain. (Messenger and Advocate 1:82) In addition, Phelps introduced the idea of a third curse upon Ham &quot;himself&quot; for &quot;marrying a black wife&quot;. (Messenger and Advocate 1:82) This Black wife, according to Phelps, was not just a descendant of Cain, but one of the pre-flood &quot;people of Canaan&quot;, not directly related to the Biblical Canaanites after the flood.

In 1836, the rules established by the church for governing assemblies in the Kirtland Temple included attendees who were &quot;bond or free, black or white.&quot; (History of the Church, Vol. 2, Ch. 26, p. 368)

Writing for the &quot;Messenger and Advocate&quot; newspaper on the subject of Black enslavement, Joseph Smith states:

In April 1836, Smith said:
In 1836, Warren Parrish (Smith&#x27;s secretary) wrote regarding the sentiments of the people of Kirtland:
The Church never denied membership based on race (although enslaved Black people had to have their enslaver&#x27;s permission to be baptized), and several Black men were ordained to the priesthood during Joseph Smith&#x27;s lifetime. The first known Black Latter-day Saint was &quot;Black Pete&quot;, who joined the Church in Kirtland, Ohio, and there is evidence that he held the priesthood. Other African Americans, including Elijah Abel in 1832, Joseph T. Ball in 1835 or 1836 (who also presided over the Boston Branch from 1844–1845), and Walker Lewis in 1843 (and probably his son, Enoch Lovejoy Lewis), were ordained to the priesthood during Smith&#x27;s lifetime. William McCary was ordained in Nauvoo in 1846 by Apostle Orson Hyde. Two of the descendants of Elijah Abel were also ordained Elders, and two other Black men, Samuel Chambers and Edward Leggroan, were ordained Deacons.

Early Black members in the Church were admitted to the temple in Kirtland, Ohio, where Elijah Abel received the ritual of washing and anointing (see &quot;Journal of Zebedee Coltrin&quot; ). Abel also participated in at least two baptisms for the dead in Nauvoo, Illinois, as did Elder Joseph T. Ball.

==Nauvoo era prior to Smith&#x27;s death (1838 to 1844)==
In 1838, Joseph Smith had the following conversation:
In 1838, and throughout the 19th century the term &quot;species&quot; was borrowed and commonly used to imply that the Black population was inferior. The biological use of the term species was first defined in 1686.

In 1838, Joseph Smith answered the following question while en route from Kirtland to Missouri, as follows: &quot;Are the Mormons abolitionists? No ... we do not believe in setting the Negroes free.&quot; (Smith 1977, p. 120)

By 1839 there were about a dozen Black members in the Church. Nauvoo, Illinois was reported to have 22 Black members, including free and enslaved individuals, between 1839–1843 (&quot;Late Persecution of the Church of Latter-day Saints&quot;, 1840).

Beginning in 1842, Smith made known his increasingly strong anti-slavery position. In March 1842, he began studying some abolitionist literature, and stated, &quot;it makes my blood boil within me to reflect upon the injustice, cruelty, and oppression of the rulers of the people. When will these things cease to be, and the Constitution and the laws again bear rule?&quot; (History of the Church, 4:544).

On February 7, 1844, Joseph Smith wrote his views as a candidate for president of the United States. The anti-slavery plank of his platform called for a gradual end to Black enslavement by the year 1850 . His plan called for the government to buy the freedom of enslaved persons using money from the sale of public lands.

==Notable Black members of the early LDS movement==

===Elijah Abel===

Although Joseph Smith is not known to have made any statements regarding Black men and the priesthood, he was aware of the ordination of at least one Black man to the office of elder. Elijah Abel was ordained on 3 March 1836 by Zebedee Coltrin. Six months later, he was ordained to the office of seventy and was called to serve in the Third Quorum of the Seventy. Abel served his first mission for the church to New York and Upper Canada. In 1836, he moved from Kirtland to Nauvoo, Illinois, where he participated in the temple ordinance of baptism for the dead. In 1843, a traveling high council visited Cincinnati, where Abel lived, but refused to recognize Abel for the sake of public appearance and called him to his second mission to the &quot;colored population&quot; of Cincinnati.

Abel joined the other Latter-day Saints in Utah Territory in 1853. By then, Brigham Young had formalized church&#x27;s policies against Black people. However, no attempt was made to remove Abel&#x27;s priesthood or drop him from the Third Quorum of the Seventy. He remained active in the Quorum until his death.

===Green Flake===

Born in 1829, Green Flake was enslaved by James Madison Flake, converted to the LDS Church, and was baptized at the age of 16 in 1844. He accompanied the Flake family to Nauvoo, Illinois. Green continued to be held as a slave, but was a member of the church throughout his life. From family diaries and the memory of a grandson, it is believed that it was Green who drove the carriage and team that brought President Brigham Young into the Salt Lake Valley. Brigham Young ended Flake&#x27;s enslavement in 1854.

===Walker Lewis===

Walker Lewis was another free Black man who held the Mormon priesthood prior to the death of Joseph Smith. A prominent radical abolitionist, Episcopalian, and Most Worshipful Grand Master of Freemasonry from Lowell and Boston, Massachusetts, Lewis became a Latter Day Saint about 1842. In the summer of 1843, he was ordained an elder in the Melchizedek priesthood. His son, Enoch Lovejoy Lewis, also joined the Latter Day Saints about the same time, and Quaker poet John Greenleaf Whittier heard young Enoch preaching in Lowell just after the death of Joseph Smith in July or August 1844. It has been speculated that Enoch led Young to instigate the ban against Black men holding Mormon priesthood when Enoch L. Lewis married a white Mormon woman, Mary Matilda Webster, in Cambridge, Massachusetts on September 18, 1846 . On December 3, 1847, Young told the Quorum of the Twelve at Winter Quarters that &quot;if they [Enoch and Matilda] were far away from the Gentiles they wod. [would] all be killed – when they mingle seed it is death to all.&quot; (Quorum of the Twelve Minutes, December 3, 1847, pp. 6–7, LDS Archives.)

<text>It&#x27;s Magic, Charlie Brown is the 21st prime-time animated television special based upon the comic strip &quot;Peanuts,&quot; by Charles M. Schulz. It originally aired on April 28, 1981.

==Plot==
Charlie Brown decides that Snoopy needs to educate himself, and gives him his library card to check out a few books. Snoopy takes out a book about magic and performs a magic show as &quot;The Great Houndini.&quot; He ends the show by making Charlie Brown disappear. A sudden rainstorm ends the show early, and Charlie Brown is left invisible. Snoopy tries several ideas to make him visible again, including draping a sheet over him, which only scares Charlie Brown when he looks in the mirror and sees what he thinks is a ghost.

Charlie Brown realizes he has a golden opportunity to kick Lucy&#x27;s football without her knowing. Charlie Brown finally succeeds in kicking the football four times and taunts her about it. Furious, Lucy threatens Snoopy into bringing back Charlie Brown.

Snoopy manages to bring Charlie Brown back after blindly shooting his invisibility counter spell in an attempt to find him. Charlie Brown turns back to normal while he attempts to kick Lucy&#x27;s football again before she pulls it away at the last second. Regardless, Charlie Brown is happy that he finally kicked the football, although Lucy says no one will believe him. Charlie Brown says that Snoopy will believe him since he made it possible for him. When Lucy scoffs at Snoopy, the insulted beagle magically levitates Lucy into the sky, and leaves her stuck there as payback until Linus pulls her down with his blanket during the credits. After being brought down by Linus, a defeated and humiliated Lucy walks home.

<doc id="169989" wikidata="Q857965" url="?curid=169989" title="Alien Ant Farm">
<text>Alien Ant Farm is an American rock band that formed in Riverside, California in 1996. They have released six studio albums and sold over 5 million units worldwide. The band&#x27;s cover of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative songs charts in 2001, and was featured in the film &quot;American Pie 2&quot;.

They released their debut album &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; independently in 1999, then signed to DreamWorks Records in 2000. Their second album &quot;ANThology&quot; was released in 2001 and has been certified platinum by the RIAA, selling over one million copies and reaching number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Following up that was their third album, &quot;TruANT&quot;, released in 2003. The album was produced by brothers Robert and Dean DeLeo of Stone Temple Pilots, and made it to number 42 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. 

In 2005, the band recorded their next album &quot;3rd Draft&quot;, however its release was denied by the label after Geffen bought out DreamWorks. It was eventually released in 2006 as &quot;Up in the Attic&quot;, charting at number 114 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. After several years of sporadic touring, the band&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Always and Forever&quot; was released in February 2015. After 9 years, the band released their sixth album &quot;Mantras&quot; in early 2024.

==History==

===Early years (1996–2000)===
The band was formed in 1996 in Riverside, California, the original lineup consisting of Dryden Mitchell (vocals), Terry Corso (guitars), Mike Cosgrove (drums) and Tye Zamora (bass).Their name comes from an idea Corso had about aliens and the Earth: &quot;It was just my daydream about our planet being seeded by entities from other dimensions.&quot; Each member was in a prior band before forming (Corso and Cosgrove were in &quot;Brother Vibe&quot;, Zamora was in a band with brothers Marc and Jon named &quot;The Color Red&quot;, and Mitchell was in a band named &quot;Dragonfly&quot;). Originally, the band considered themselves to be cheating on their other bands, and intended to wear masks while performing. 

In 1996 they recorded a demo tape titled the &quot;$100 EP&quot; containing five songs, and in 1998 they recorded a second demo tape &quot;Love Songs&quot;, featuring four songs.

In 1999, Alien Ant Farm released their debut album, titled &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; which featured early versions of songs to be featured on later releases. It went on to win Best Independent Album in the L.A. Music Awards that year.

In 2000, after forging a friendship with the band Papa Roach, Alien Ant Farm signed with Dreamworks SKG for their second studio album, &quot;Anthology&quot;. They proceeded to tour with Papa Roach to support the album.

===&quot;ANThology&quot; (2001–2002)===
In 2001, their cover of Michael Jackson&#x27;s song, &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot;, was a No. 1 single in Australia and No. 4 in New Zealand, a No. 3 single in the UK, and No. 1 on the US Modern Rock charts. The music video features numerous homages to Michael Jackson and his videos. Corso, the band&#x27;s guitarist, addressed this in an MTV interview on the set of the music video, saying, &quot;We want to pay homage to Michael Jackson, but on our level. Obviously we&#x27;re not that glitzy, so we just want to tastefully take the stuff that&#x27;s cool in his videos and apply it in our own dirty little backyard way.&quot;

The song appeared on the soundtrack of the first season of &quot;WWE Tough Enough&quot; and in the film &quot;American Pie 2&quot;. Their following single &quot;Movies&quot; was a Top 5 hit in the UK and a Top 20 hit in New Zealand. The band began touring in promotion of these two singles and their album, which later went platinum.

In spring of 2002, the band contributed &quot;Bug Bytes&quot; to the first &quot;Spider-Man&quot; soundtrack.

In May 2002, the band was involved in a bus accident while touring in Spain. While the whole band suffered minor injuries, the driver, 26-year-old Christopher Holland, was killed, and lead singer Mitchell suffered a fractured C2 vertebra.

===&quot;TruANT&quot; (2003–2004)===

Alien Ant Farm soon returned to the studio to work on their next album, &quot;Truant&quot;, which was released in 2003 and produced by Stone Temple Pilots&#x27; Robert and Dean DeLeo. The video for &quot;These Days&quot;, the first single from the album, was filmed on top of a nearby building during the Red Carpet at the 2003 BET Awards. &quot;Glow&quot; was a mainstream radio success, achieving long lasting Top 20 success in New Zealand. Two months after this album was released, however, their record label closed its doors. This hindered the album&#x27;s popularity over time, and the album was much less successful than their platinum-selling debut.

In October 2003, guitarist Corso split with the band citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;. Victor Camacho (a long-time friend of the band and guitar player) immediately joined the band and completed the remainder of the Truant tour until the band returned home. Joe Hill was named the new guitarist in 2005 (formerly of Spiderworks).

In 2004, the band recorded the song &quot;Dark in Here&quot; for &quot;The Punisher&quot; video game. The band was forced to wait for Geffen to allow them to record another album (after Universal Music bought DreamWorks and assigned the band to its Geffen Records label).

===&quot;3rd Draft&quot; and &quot;Up in the Attic&quot; (2005–2007)===

In 2005, the band recorded with producer Jim Wirt (who recorded their independent, debut release &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;) and planned to release the album during that summer. However, Geffen shelved the album and subsequently denied the band the rights to release it themselves. The band hit the road and made bootleg copies of the album material available to all of their fans. This unofficial release was dubbed &quot;3rd Draft&quot; by fans.

Four video games have featured the band&#x27;s songs. Their song &quot;Wish&quot; was in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot;, while the song &quot;Courage&quot; also featured in &quot;Shaun Palmer&#x27;s Pro Snowboarder&quot; and &quot;ATV Offroad Fury 2&quot;. The song &quot;These Days&quot; was featured in &quot;Madden NFL 2004&quot; and the song &quot;S.S Recognize&quot; were featured in &quot;NHL 2004&quot;.

In late 2005, Geffen finally agreed to let the band release the album on another Universal label, Universal Music Enterprises (its catalog division). On May 30, 2006, the new album, &quot;Up in the Attic&quot;, was released digitally on iTunes and sold at various retailers. The Best Buy Edition included a bonus track, &quot;Repeat Defender&quot;. The first single was &quot;Forgive and Forget&quot;, the one added track to &quot;3rd Draft&quot;.

In April 2006, bassist Tye Zamora left the band and decided to go to college. The short amount of live shows thereafter featured Alex Barreto on bass. On June 29, 2006, the band performed on G4&#x27;s &quot;Attack of the Show&quot;, and on July 18, 2006, &quot;Up In The Attic&quot; was released worldwide, along with &quot;BUSted: The Definitive DVD&quot;. Included on the DVD were music videos for &quot;Forgive and Forget&quot;, &quot;Around the Block&quot;, and &quot;She&#x27;s Only Evil&quot;. Notably, the three videos feature only Dryden Mitchell and Mike Cosgrove.

The band released &quot;Around the Block&quot;, the second single from &quot;Up in the Attic&quot;, on the iTunes Store in 2007.

===Rejoining of Zamora and Corso (2007–2010)===

On February 11, 2008, the band posted a statement on their website stating Terry Corso and Tye Zamora had rejoined the band. It was also revealed that the band had &quot;unofficially broken up&quot; in 2007 due to the fact that 2006&#x27;s &quot;Up in the Attic&quot; was their least successful album.

Around this time, vocalist Dryden Mitchell formed a new band, Send the Sages. Guitarist Terry Corso and drummer Michael Cosgrove worked on a side project titled Ghost In The Flesh, bassist Tye Zamora worked with the band . Alien Ant Farm toured sporadically, and released a new live album, Alien Ant Farm: Live In Germany.

In 2009, they played the Sonisphere Festival in Knebworth, UK on August 1. They had also performed &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; at the 2009 Vans&#x27; Warped Tour in memory of Michael Jackson, who had recently died.

On February 9, 2010, Alien Ant Farm posted on their official website that the original line up (Dryden Mitchell, Terry Corso, Tye Zamora and Mike Cosgrove) was back together for the first time since 2003. On February 27, 2010, the Alien Ant Farm official website released the band&#x27;s first &quot;webizode&quot; titled Bassmasters.

===&quot;Always and Forever&quot; and &quot;Mantras&quot; (2011–present)===

The band&#x27;s &quot;ANTicipation&quot; 2011 Tour took place across the continental U.S. from July to October 2011. They also took part in the &quot;Michael Forever Tribute Concert&quot; which took place on October 8, 2011 in Cardiff, Wales. Alien Ant Farm started writing new material and in July 2012 started recording their fifth album, &quot;Always and Forever,&quot; at Groovemaster Studios in Chicago in July 2012. In March 2013 they set up a crowdfund, using PledgeMusic, to finance the album&#x27;s release. The first single from &quot;Always and Forever&quot;, &quot;Let &#x27;Em Know&quot;, was released in May 2013. Also in the summer of 2013, Alien Ant Farm participated in &quot;The Big Night Out Tour&quot;, opening for Hoobastank and Fuel.

Zamora left the band for a second time in March 2014 and was replaced by Tim Peugh. At the same time Michael Anaya joined as a touring member of the band, providing backing vocals, percussion, and keyboards. Another single, &quot;Homage&quot;, was released in September 2014, followed a month later by &quot;E.P. Phone Home&quot;. The album &quot;Always and Forever&quot; was released on February 24, 2015.

On March 31, 2016, Alien Ant Farm announced on their official Facebook page that they were writing material for a new album. On May 17, 2016, the band took part in the Make America Rock Again super tour throughout the summer and fall 2016. In addition, they announced a headlining tour where they intend to perform the album &quot;Anthology&quot; in its entirety. 

On October 26, 2016, guitarist Terry Corso assaulted a fan during a show in Chester because he mistakenly believed the fan threw urine at him. Corso pled guilty to assault and was ordered to pay a fine to the victim.

In early 2018, they toured the UK with Soil and Local H, and then embarked on the &quot;Gen-X Tour&quot;, alongside Buckcherry, P.O.D., and Lit. On May 8, 2020, they released a cover of the Wham! song &quot;Everything She Wants&quot;. Released on February 17, 2021, they collaborated with Insane Clown Posse on the single &quot;Afraid of Life&quot; from the EP &quot;Yum Yum&#x27;s Lure&quot;.

On December 30, 2022, Dryden Mitchell was charged with battery after an incident during the Alien Ant Farm concert at Fort Lauderdale&#x27;s Broward Center for the Performing Arts on October 29. It is alleged that Mitchell grabbed the hand of a male audience member and forced his hand to touch his &quot;genital area&quot;.

In 2023, the band played Sick New World and The 23rd Annual Gathering of the Juggalos. Their sixth album, titled &quot;Mantras&quot;, was released on April 26, 2024. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;So Cold&quot;, was released on January 19.

In November 2024, Alien Ant Farm kicked CKY off their joint European tour because CKY singer Chad I Ginsburg allegedly punched Dryden Mitchell in the face.

==Musical style and influences==
Although initially grouped in with the nu metal movement of the late 1990s and early 2000s, the band has since been classified under various other genres, such as alternative rock, alternative metal, post-grunge, punk rock, and pop punk. &quot;Spin&quot; stated in 2003 that their hit cover of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; proved that &quot;nu metal could be funny on purpose&quot;.

The band&#x27;s influences include Faith No More and Primus.

<doc id="169991" wikidata="Q22714" url="?curid=169991" title="Karl May">
<text>Karl Friedrich May ( , ; 25 February 1842 – 30 March 1912) was a German author. He is best known for his novels of travels and adventures, set in the American Old West, the Orient, the Middle East, Latin America, China and Germany. He also wrote poetry, a play, and composed music. He was a proficient player of several musical instruments. Many of his works were adapted for film, theatre, audio dramas and comics. Later in his career, May turned to philosophical and spiritual genres. He is one of the best-selling German writers of all time, with about 200,000,000 copies sold worldwide.

== Early life ==
May was the fifth child of a poor family of weavers in Ernstthal, Schönburgische Rezessherrschaften (then part of the Kingdom of Saxony). He had 13 siblings, of whom nine died in infancy. His parents were Heinrich August May and Wilhelmine Christiane Weise. During his school years, he received instruction in music and composition. At age twelve, May was making money at a skittle alley, where he was exposed to rough language.

=== Delinquency ===
In 1856, May commenced teacher training in Waldenburg, but in 1859 was expelled for stealing six candles. After an appeal, he was allowed to continue in Plauen. Shortly after graduation, when his roommate accused him of stealing a watch, May was jailed in Chemnitz for six weeks and his license to teach was revoked. After this, May worked with little success as a private tutor, an author of tales, a composer and a public speaker. For four years, from 1865 to 1869, May was jailed in the workhouse at Osterstein Castle, Zwickau. With good behaviour, May became an administrator of the prison library, which gave him the chance to read widely. He made a list of the works he planned to write (&quot;Repertorium C. May&quot;.)

On his release, May continued his life of crime, impersonating various characters (policemen, doctors etc.) and spinning fantastic tales as a method of fraud. He was arrested, but when he was transported to a crime scene during a judicial investigation, he escaped and fled to Bohemia, where he was detained for vagrancy. For another four years, from 1870 to 1874, May was jailed in Waldheim, Saxony. There he met a Catholic Catechist, Johannes Kochta, who assisted May.

==Career==
After his release in May 1874, May returned to his parents&#x27; home in Ernstthal and began to write. In November 1874, &quot;Die Rose von Ernstthal&quot; (&quot;The Rose from Ernstthal&quot;) was published. May then became an editor in the publishing house of Heinrich Gotthold Münchmeyer in Dresden. May managed entertainment papers such as &quot;Schacht und Hütte&quot; (&quot;Mine and Mill&quot;) and continued to publish his own works such as &quot;Geographische Predigten&quot; (&quot;Collected Travel Stories&quot;) (1876). May resigned in 1876 and was employed by Bruno Radelli of Dresden.

In 1878, May became a freelance writer. Once again, May was insolvent. In 1882, May returned to the employ of Münchmeyer and began the first of five large colportage novels. One of these was &quot;Das Waldröschen&quot; (1882–1884). From 1879, May was also published in &quot;Deutscher Hausschatz&quot; (&quot;German House Treasure&quot;), a Catholic weekly journal from the press of Friedrich Pustet in Regensburg. In 1880, May began the &quot;Orient Cycle&quot;, which ran, with interruption, until 1888. May was also published in the teenage boys&#x27; journal &quot;Der Gute Kamerad&quot; (&quot;The Good Comrade&quot;) of Wilhelm Spemann, Stuttgart. In 1887, it published &quot;Der Sohn des Bärenjägers&quot; (&quot;Son of the Bear Hunter&quot;). In 1891 &quot;Der Schatz im Silbersee&quot; (&quot;The Treasure of Silver Lake&quot;) was published. May published in other journals using pseudonyms. In all, he published over one hundred articles. In October 1888, May moved to Kötzschenbroda (a part of Radebeul) and in 1891 to &quot;Villa Agnes&quot; in Oberlößnitz. In 1891, Friedrich Ernst Fehsenfeld offered to print the &quot;Deutscher Hausschatz&quot; &quot;Son of the Bear Hunter&quot; stories as books. In 1892, the publication of &quot;Carl May&#x27;s Gesammelte Reiseromane&quot; (&quot;Collected Travel Accounts&quot; or &quot;Karl May&#x27;s Gesammelte Reiseerzählungen&quot;) brought financial security and recognition. May became deeply absorbed in the stories he wrote and the lives of his characters. Readers wrote to May, addressing him as the protagonists of his books. May conducted talking tours in Germany and Austria and allowed autographed cards to be printed and photos in costume to be taken. In December 1895, May moved to the Villa Shatterhand in Alt-Radebeul, which he purchased from the Ziller brothers.

=== Later career ===
In 1899, May traveled to Egypt then Sumatra with his servant, Sejd Hassan. In 1900, he was joined by Klara and Richard Plöhn. The group returned to Radebeul in July 1900. May demonstrated some emotional instability during his travels.

Hermann Cardauns and Rudolf Lebius criticised May for his self-promotion with the Old Shatterhand legend. He was also reproached for his writing for the Catholic &quot;Deutscher Hausschatz&quot; and several Marian calendars. There were also charges of unauthorised book publications and the use of an illegal doctoral degree. In 1902, May did receive a Doctor honoris causa from the Universitas Germana-Americana in Chicago for &quot;Im Reiche des Silbernen Löwen&quot; (&quot;In the Realm of the Silver Lion.&quot;) In 1908, Karl and Klara May spent six weeks in North America. They traveled through Albany, New York, Buffalo, New York, the Niagara Falls and visited friends in Lawrence, Massachusetts. May was inspired to write &quot;Winnetou IV&quot;.

On his return, May began work on complex allegorical texts. He considered the &quot;question of mankind&quot;, pacifism and the raising of humans from evil to good. Sascha Schneider provided symbolist covers for the Fehsenfeld edition. On 22 March 1912, May was invited by the Academic Society for Literature and Music in Vienna to present a lecture entitled &quot;Empor ins Reich der Edelmenschen&quot; (&quot;Upward to the Realm of Noble Men&quot;). There, he met pacifist and Nobel Laureate Bertha von Suttner.

==Death==
May died in his own Villa Shatterhand on 30 March 1912. According to the register of deaths, the cause was cardiac arrest, acute bronchitis and asthma, but according to Ralf Harder from the Karl-May-Stiftung, May&#x27;s death certificate does not include the cause of death. Scientists examining the remains of May in 2014 found excessive quantities of lead and other heavy metals, and concluded that his death was probably due to a long-time exposure to lead in water as well as tobacco. May was buried in Radebeul East. His tomb was inspired by the Temple of Athena Nike.

==Personal life==
In 1880, he married Emma Pollmer. They divorced in 1903 and had no children. May subsequently married Klara Plöhn, who was widowed.

== Works ==
May used many pseudonyms, including &quot;Capitan Ramon Diaz de la Escosura&quot;, &quot;D. Jam&quot;, &quot;Emma Pollmer&quot;, &quot;Ernst von Linden&quot;, &quot;Hobble-Frank&quot;, &quot;Karl Hohenthal&quot;, &quot;M. Gisela&quot;, &quot;P. van der Löwen&quot;, &quot;Prinz Muhamel Lautréamont&quot; and &quot;Richard Plöhn&quot;. Most pseudonymously or anonymously published works have been identified.

For the novels set in America, May created the characters of Winnetou, the wise chief of the Apaches, and Old Shatterhand, Winnetou&#x27;s white blood brother. Another series of novels were set in the Ottoman Empire. In these, the narrator-protagonist, Kara Ben Nemsi, travels with his local guide and servant Hadschi Halef Omar through the Sahara desert to the Near East, experiencing many exciting adventures.

May&#x27;s writing developed from the anonymous first-person observer-narrator (for example &quot;Der Gitano&quot;, 1875) to a narrator with heroic skills and equipment, to a fully formed first-person narrator-hero.

With few exceptions, May had not visited the places he described, but he compensated successfully for his lack of direct experience through a combination of creativity, imagination, and documentary sources including maps, travel accounts and guidebooks, as well as anthropological and linguistic studies. The work of writers such as James Fenimore Cooper, Gabriel Ferry, Friedrich Gerstäcker, Balduin Möllhausen and Mayne Reid served as his models.

Non-dogmatic Christian values play an important role in May&#x27;s works. Some of the characters are described as being of German, particularly Saxon, origins.

In a letter to a young Jew who intended to become a Christian after reading May&#x27;s books, May advised him first to understand his own religion, which he described as holy and exalted, until he was experienced enough to choose.

In his later works (after 1900) May left the adventure fiction genre to write symbolic novels with religious and pacifistic content. The change is best shown in &quot;Im Reiche des silbernen Löwen&quot;, where the first two parts are adventurous and the last two parts belong to the mature work.

=== Early work ===
In his early work, May wrote in a variety of genres until he showed his proficiency in travel stories. During his time as an editor, he published many of these works within the periodicals for which he was responsible.

* &quot;Das Buch der Liebe&quot; (1876, educational work)
* &quot;Geographische Predigten&quot; (1876, educational work)
* &quot;Der beiden Quitzows letzte Fahrten&quot; (1877, unfinished)
* &quot;Auf hoher See gefangen&quot; (&quot;Auf der See gefangen&quot;, parts later revised for &quot;Old Surehand II&quot;) (1878)
* &quot;Scepter und Hammer&quot; (1880)
* &quot;Im fernen Westen&quot; (reworked in &quot;Old Firehand&quot; (1875) and later in &quot;Winnetou II&quot;)(1879)
* &quot;Der Waldläufer&quot; (reworked in &quot;Le Coureur de Bois&quot;, a novel by Gabriel Ferry)
* &quot;Die Juweleninsel&quot; (1882)

The shorter stories of the early work can be grouped as follows, although in some works genres overlap. Some of the shorter stories were later published in anthologies, for example, &quot;Der Karawanenwürger und andere Erzählungen&quot; (1894), &quot;Humoresken und Erzählungen&quot; (1902) and &quot;Erzgebirgische Dorfgeschichten&quot; (1903).

* Adventure fiction and early travel stories (for example, &quot;Inn-nu-woh, der Indianerhäuptling&quot;, 1875)
* Crime fiction (for example, &quot;Wanda&quot;, 1875)
* Historical fiction (for example, &quot;Robert Surcouf&quot;, 1882)
* Humorous stories (for example, &quot;Die Fastnachtsnarren&quot;, 1875)
* Series about &quot;the Old Dessauer&quot;, Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau (for example, &quot;Pandur und Grenadier&quot;, 1883)
* Stories of villages in the Ore Mountains (for example, &quot;Die Rose von Ernstthal&quot;, 1874 or 1875)
* Natural history works (for example, &quot;Schätze und Schatzgräber&quot;, 1875)
* Letters and poems (for example, &quot;Meine einstige Grabinschrift&quot;, 1872).

=== Colportage novels ===

May wrote five large (many thousands of pages) colportage novels, which he published either anonymously or under pseudonyms between 1882 and 1888.

* &quot;Das Waldröschen&quot; (1882–1884, a part was later revised for &quot;Old Surehand II&quot;)
* &quot;Die Liebe des Ulanen&quot; (1883–1885)
* &quot;Der verlorne Sohn oder Der Fürst des Elends&quot; (1884–1886)
* &quot;Deutsche Herzen&quot; (&quot;Deutsche Helden&quot;) (1885–1888)
* &quot;Der Weg zum Glück&quot; (1886–1888)

From 1900 to 1906, Münchmeyer&#x27;s successor Adalbert Fischer published the first book editions. These were revised by third hand and published under May&#x27;s real name instead of pseudonyms. This edition was not authorized by May and he tried to stop its publication.

=== Travel stories ===

Thirty-three volumes of &quot;Carl May&#x27;s Gesammelte Reiseromane&quot;, (&quot;Karl May&#x27;s Gesammelte Reiseerzählungen&quot;) were published from 1892 to 1910 by Friedrich Ernst Fehsenfeld. Most had been previously published in &quot;Deutscher Hausschatz&quot;, but some were new. The best known titles are the &quot;Orient Cycle&quot; (volumes 1–6) and the &quot;Winnetou-Trilogy&quot; (volumes 7–9). Beyond these shorter cycles, the works are troubled by chronological inconsistencies arising when original articles were revised for book editions.

May&#x27;s &quot;oeuvre&quot; includes some shorter travel stories that were not published within this series (for example, &quot;Eine Befreiung&quot; in &quot;Die Rose von Kaïrwan&quot;, 1894). After the founding of the Karl May Press in 1913, works in &quot;Gesammelte Werke&quot; were revised (sometimes extensively) and many received new titles. Texts (other than those from Fehsenfeld Press) were also added to the new series.

=== Stories for young readers ===

These stories were written from 1887 to 1897 for the magazine &quot;Der Gute Kamerad&quot;. Most of the stories are set in the Wild West, but Old Shatterhand is just a figure and not the first-person narrator as he is in the travel stories. The best-known volume is &quot;Der Schatz im Silbersee&quot;. In the broadest sense, the early works &quot;Im fernen Westen&quot; and &quot;Der Waldläufer&quot; belong in this category.

* &quot;Der Sohn des Bärenjägers&quot; (1887, since 1890 within &quot;Die Helden des Westens&quot;)
* &quot;Der Geist des Llano estakata&quot; (1888, since 1890 correctly titled as &quot;Der Geist des Llano estakado&quot; within &quot;Die Helden des Westens&quot;)
* &quot;Kong-Kheou, das Ehrenwort&quot; (1888/89, since 1892 titled &quot;Der blaurote Methusalem&quot;)
* &quot;Die Sklavenkarawane&quot; (1890)
* &quot;Der Schatz im Silbersee&quot; (1891)
* &quot;Das Vermächtnis des Inka&quot; (1892)
* &quot;Der Oelprinz&quot; (1894, since 1905 titled as &quot;Der Ölprinz&quot;)
* &quot;Der schwarze Mustang&quot; (1897)
* Replies to letters from readers in &quot;Der Gute Kamerad&quot;.

=== Mature work ===

May&#x27;s mature work dates to 1900, after his travels to the East. Many of them were published by Fehsenfeld.

* &quot;Himmelsgedanken&quot; (1900, poem collection)
* &quot;Im Reiche des silbernen Löwen III&quot; (1902)
* &quot;Erzgebirgische Dorfgeschichten&quot; (1903, anthology) 
* &quot;Im Reiche des silbernen Löwen IV&quot; (1903)
* &quot;Und Friede auf Erden!&quot; (1904)
* &quot;Babel und Bibel&quot; (1906, drama)
* &quot;Ardistan und Dschinnistan I&quot; (1909)
* &quot;Ardistan und Dschinnistan II&quot; (1909)
* &quot;Winnetou IV&quot; (1910)
* &quot;Mein Leben und Streben&quot; (1910, autobiography)
* &quot;Schamah&quot; (1907) and other short stories.
* &quot;Briefe über Kunst&quot; (1907) and other articles. 
* &quot;&quot;Karl May als Erzieher&quot; und &quot;Die Wahrheit über Karl May&quot; oder Die Gegner Karl Mays in ihrem eigenen Lichte&quot; (1902) and other legal proceedings.

=== Other works ===
May was a member of the &quot;Lyra&quot; choir in about 1864 and composed musical works, including a version of &quot;Ave Maria&quot; and &quot;Vergiss mich nicht&quot; within &quot;Ernste Klänge&quot;, 1899.

During his last years, May lectured on his philosophical ideas.
* &quot;Drei Menschheitsfragen: Wer sind wir? Woher kommen wir? Wohin gehen wir?&quot; (Lawrence, 1908)
* &quot;Sitara, das Land der Menschheitsseele&quot; (Augsburg, 1909)
* &quot;Empor ins Reich der Edelmenschen&quot; (Vienna, 1912)

Furthermore, there are posthumous publications of fragments of stories and dramas, lyrics, musical compositions, letters and the library catalog.

== Reception ==
=== Number of copies and translations ===
According to an encyclopedia dedicated to May, he is the &quot;most read writer of the German tongue&quot;. The total number of copies published is about 200 million, half of them in German.

May&#x27;s first translated work is considered to have been the first half of the &quot;Orient Cycle&quot; into a French daily in 1881. Recently, it was discovered, and confirmed by Hans Dieter Steinmet (Karl May Museum) that Croatian writer Nikola Tordinac published a translation of May&#x27;s novel &quot;Tree carde monte&quot; in the magazine Sriemski Hrvat in 1880. Tordinac&#x27;s translation became a part of the permanent exhibition of the Karl May Museum in 2017. Since that time, May&#x27;s work has been translated into more than 30 languages, including Latin and Esperanto. In the 1960s, UNESCO indicated that May was the most frequently translated German writer. His most popular translations are in Bulgarian, Czech, Hungarian and Dutch. Seabury Press, New York, began publishing English translations by Michael Shaw in 1977. In 2001, Nemsi Books Publishing Company, Pierpont, South Dakota, was one of the first English publishing houses to produce the unabridged translations of May&#x27;s &quot;oeuvre&quot;. Since the closing of Nemsi Books in 2023, some of the English translations by Juergen Nett have been made available on Amazon through KDP.

=== Influence ===
May had a substantial influence on a number of well-known German-speaking people and on the German population itself. The popularity of his writing, and his (generally German) protagonists, are seen as having filled a lack in the German psyche, which had few popular heroes until the 19th century. His readers longed to escape from an industrialised, capitalist society, an escape which May offered. May &quot;helped shape the collective German dream of feats far beyond middle-class bounds.&quot; and contributed to the popular image of Native Americans in German-speaking countries, which has been described by many as racist and harmful.

The name &quot;Winnetou&quot; has an entry in the German dictionary, Duden. The wider influence on the populace also surprised US occupation troops after World War II, who realised that thanks to May, &quot;Cowboys and Indians&quot; were familiar concepts to local children (though fantastic and removed from reality).

Many well-known German-speaking people used May&#x27;s heroes as models in their childhood. Albert Einstein enjoyed May&#x27;s books and said, &quot;My whole adolescence stood under his sign. Indeed, even today, he has been dear to me in many a desperate hour...&quot;

==== Influence on the Nazis ====
Adolf Hitler was an admirer, who noted in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; that the novels &quot;overwhelmed&quot; him as a boy, going as far as to ensure &quot;a noticeable decline&quot; in his school grades. According to an anonymous friend, Hitler attended the lecture given by May in Vienna in March 1912 and was enthusiastic about the event. The lecture was an appeal for peace, also heard by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Bertha von Suttner. May died suddenly only ten days after the lecture, leaving the young Hitler deeply upset. Claus Roxin noted that he doubts the anonymous description, because Hitler had said much about May, but not that he had seen him. Hitler defended May against critics in the men&#x27;s hostel where he lived in Vienna, as the evidence of May&#x27;s earlier time in jail had come to light; although it was true, Hitler confessed that May had never visited the sites of his American adventure stories. This made him a greater writer in Hitler&#x27;s view since it showed the author&#x27;s powers of imagination. 

Hitler later recommended the books to his generals and had special editions distributed to soldiers at the front, praising Winnetou as an example of &quot;tactical finesse and circumspection&quot;, though some note that the latter claims of using the books as military guidance are not substantiated. However, as told by Albert Speer, &quot;when faced by seemingly hopeless situations, he [Hitler] would still reach for these stories,&quot; because &quot;they gave him courage like works of philosophy for others or the Bible for elderly people.&quot; Hitler&#x27;s admiration for May led the German writer Klaus Mann to accuse May of having been a form of &quot;mentor&quot; for Hitler. In his admiration, Hitler ignored May&#x27;s Christian and humanitarian approach and views completely, not mentioning his relatively sympathetic description of Jews and other persons of non-Northern European ancestry. The National Socialists in particular tried to use May&#x27;s popularity and his work for their purposes.

==== &quot;Indianertümelei&quot; ====

The popularity of May&#x27;s books sparked a fascination in German popular culture with the Indigenous peoples of North America that continues to this day. In 1985, the German scholar Hartmut Lutz invented the term &quot;Deutsche Indianertümelei&quot; (&quot;German Indian Enthusiasm&quot;) for the phenomenon. The phrase &quot;Indianertümelei&quot; is a reference to the German term (&quot;German Enthusiasm&quot;) which mockingly describes the phenomenon of celebrating in an excessively nationalistic and romanticized manner &quot;Deutschtum&quot; (&quot;Germanness&quot;). In the English-speaking world, the phenomenon of the German obsession with the First Nations of North America is known as &quot;Indianthusiasm&quot;. In a 1999 speech delivered in the United States in English, Lutz declared:

As part of the phenomenon of &quot;Indianertümelei&quot; a number of Western and Indian theme parks operate in Germany, the most popular of which are the Pullman City theme park outside of Munich and El Dorado theme park outside of Berlin. May&#x27;s books also inspired hobbyist clubs, where Germans pretend to be cowboys or Indians, the first of which was the Cowboy Club founded in Munich in 1913. In 2019, it was estimated that between 40,000 and 100,000 Germans are involved in &quot;Indianer&quot; hobbyist clubs at any given moment. Interviewed in 2007, one member of an &quot;Indianer&quot; club stated: &quot;Our camp is always in summer, in July for two weeks. During this time, we live in tipis, we wear only Indian clothes. We don&#x27;t use technology and we try to follow Indian traditions. We have those [pretending to be] Lakota, Oglala, Blackfeet, Blood, Siksika, Pawneee... and we go on the warpath against each other day and night, anytime at all. In two weeks, every tribe can fight each other. We don&#x27;t know when somebody will attack or when they will come to steal our horses. And the battles are always exciting, too. I really enjoy them&quot;. 

Regarding the role of Karl May&#x27;s works, Karl May movies and Karl May stage adaptations for the German image of Native Americans, Rivka Galchen notes in her essay on &quot;Wild West Germany&quot; in 2012:

==== Influence on other authors ====
The German writer Carl Zuckmayer was intrigued by May&#x27;s Apache chief and named his daughter &quot;Maria Winnetou&quot;. Max von der Grün said he read May as a young boy. When asked whether reading May&#x27;s books had given him anything, he answered, &quot;No. It took something away from me. The fear of bulky books, that is.&quot; 
Heinz Werner Höber, the twofold Glauser prize winner, was a follower of May. He said, &quot;When I was about 12 years old I wrote my first novel on Native Americans which was, of course, from the beginning to the end completely stolen from Karl May.&quot; He had pleaded with friends to get him to Radebeul &quot;because Radebeul meant Karl May&quot;. There, he was deeply impressed by the museum and said, &quot;My great fellow countryman from Hohenstein-Ernstthal and his immortal heroes have never left me ever since.&quot;

=== Honors ===
Asteroids 348 May and 15728 Karlmay are named in May&#x27;s honour.

== Adaptations ==
May&#x27;s poem &quot;Ave Maria&quot; (1896) was set to music in at least 19 versions. Other poems, especially from the collection &quot;Himmelsgedanken&quot; were also set to music. Carl Ball wrote &quot;Harp Clangs&quot; for the drama &quot;Babel und Bibel&quot; for May. The Swiss composer Othmar Schoeck adapted &quot;Der Schatz im Silbersee&quot; for opera. May&#x27;s concepts, such as Winnetou&#x27;s death, inspired musical works.

The first stage adaptation of May&#x27;s work was &quot;Winnetou&quot; (1919) by Hermann Dimmler. Dimmler and Ludwig Körner made revised editions of the play. Different novel revisions have been played on outdoor stages since the 1940s. The Karl May Festival in Bad Segeberg has been held every summer since 1952 and in Lennestadt-Elspe since 1958. At some of these festivals, Pierre Brice has played Winnetou. Another festival has been conducted on a rock stage in Rathen, in Saxon Switzerland near Radebeul in 1940 and then since 1984.

In 1920, May&#x27;s friend Marie Luise Droop, her husband Adolf Droop and the Karl May Press founded Ustad-Film, a production company. Ustad-Film made three silent movies (&quot;Auf den Trümmern des Paradieses&quot;, &quot;Die Todeskarawane&quot; and &quot;Die Teufelsanbeter&quot;) after the &quot;Orientcycle&quot;. The company became bankrupt in 1921 and the films are lost. In 1936 a first sound movie &quot;Durch die Wüste&quot; was shown. &#x27; (1958) and its sequel &#x27; (1959) were the first colour movies.

From 1962 to 1968, a series of May movies were made. While most of the seventeen movies of this series were Wild West movies (beginning with &quot;Der Schatz im Silbersee&quot;), three were based on the &quot;Orientcycle&quot; and two on &quot;Das Waldröschen&quot;. Most of these movies were made separately by the two competitors Horst Wendlandt and Artur Brauner. Several actors were employed, including Lex Barker (Old Shatterhand, Kara Ben Nemsi, Karl Sternau), Pierre Brice (Winnetou), Gojko Mitić (Winnetou), Stewart Granger (Old Surehand), Milan Srdoč (Old Wabble) and Ralf Wolter (Sam Hawkens, Hadschi Halef Omar, André Hasenpfeffer). The film score by Martin Böttcher and the landscape of Yugoslavia are associated with the movies. Other movies such as &quot;Die Spur führt zum Silbersee&quot; (1990) and TV productions such as &quot;Das Buschgespenst&quot; (1986) and the television series &quot;Kara Ben Nemsi Effendi&quot; (1973) were produced. The productions vary from the original written works.

In 2016, German RTL Television premiered three-part television movies based on Winnetou, directed by Philipp Stölzl. In the part &quot;Winnetou and Old Shatterhand&quot;, Gojko Mitić, one of the actors who played Winnetou in the &#x27;60s movies, portrayed Intschu Tschuna, Winnetou&#x27;s father.

May&#x27;s works (about 300) have been adapted for audio dramas, particularly in the 1960s. The first, &quot;Der Schatz im Silbersee&quot;, was written by Günther Bibo in 1929. There are also Czech and Danish versions of the audio dramas. In 1988, &quot;Der Schatz im Silbersee&quot; was read by Gert Westphal and published as an audiobook. &quot;Wann sehe ich dich wieder, du lieber, lieber Winnetou?&quot; (1995) is a compendium of Karl May texts read by Hermann Wiedenroth.

In the 1950s Croatian comic book artist Walter Neugebauer finished his 1930s comic book adaptation of Karl May&#x27;s stories. Serbian artist Aleksandar Hecl also drew one. In the 1960s and 1970s, May&#x27;s works were adapted for German comics including an eight-issue series based on &quot;Winnetou&quot; and a further nine-issue series titled &quot;Karl May&quot; (1963–1965). The series was drawn by Helmut Nickel and Harry Ehrt and published by Walter Lehning Verlag. Belgian comics artist Willy Vandersteen created a whole series of comics based on May&#x27;s stories, simply titled &quot;Karl May&quot; (1962–1977). Eighty-seven issues of &quot;Karl May&quot; were published by Standaard Uitgeverij from 1962 to 1987. Comics based on May&#x27;s novels were also produced in Czechoslovakia, Denmark, France, Mexico, Spain and Sweden.

May&#x27;s life has been the subject of screen works, novels and a stage play, including 
* &quot;Freispruch für Old Shatterhand&quot; (1965, directed by Hans Heinrich)
* &quot;Karl May&quot; (1974, directed by Hans-Jürgen Syberberg)
* &quot;Karl May&quot; (1992, directed by. Klaus Überall, a television series in 8 episodes)
* &quot;Swallow, mein wackerer Mustang&quot; (1980) by Erich Loest
* &quot;Vom Wunsch, Indianer zu werden. Wie Franz Kafka Karl May traf und trotzdem nicht in Amerika landete&quot; (1994) by Peter Henisch
* &quot;Old Shatterhand in Moabit&quot; (1994) by Walter Püschel
* &quot;Karl May und der Wettermacher&quot; (2001) by Jürgen Heinzerling
* &quot;Die Taschenuhr des Anderen&quot; by Willi Olbrich.

=== Copies, parodies, and sequels ===
May was copied or parodied during his lifetime. Some wrote similar Wild West stories. Others, such as Franz Treller, published under May&#x27;s name. Novelizations of May&#x27;s characters include 
* &quot;Hadschi Halef Omar&quot; (2010) Jörg Kastner describes the first contact of the titular character with Kara Ben Nemsi. 
* &quot;In Mekka&quot; (1923) Franz Kandolf, a sequel to &quot;Am Jenseits&quot; (&quot;Karl May&#x27;s Gesammelte Werke&quot; volume 50).
* &quot;Die Schatten des Schah-in-Schah&quot; (2006) Heinz Grill, an alternative to &quot;Im Reiche des silbernen Löwen III/IV&quot;.
* &quot;Winnetous Testament&quot; Jutta Laroche and Reinhard Marheinecke, a series of eight volumes as a sequel to &quot;Winnetou IV&quot;.
* &quot;Der Schuh des Manitu&quot; (2001) Michael Herbig, a parody on the Karl May films of the 1960s.

== Karl May institutions ==
=== Karl May Foundation ===
In his will, May made his second wife, Klara, his sole heiress. He instructed that after her death all of his property and any future earnings from his work should go to a foundation. This foundation should support the education of the gifted poor including writers, journalists, and editors. One year after May&#x27;s death, on 5 March 1913, Klara May established the &quot;Karl May Foundation&quot; (&quot;Karl-May-Stiftung&quot;). Contributions have been made since 1917. Klara and Karl May&#x27;s estate went to the foundation. The foundation established the Karl May Museum to maintain the Villa Shatterhand, the estates, the collections and May&#x27;s tomb. In 1960, the Karl May Foundation received the Karl May Press.

=== Karl May Press ===
On 1 July 1913, Klara May, Friedrich Ernst Fehsenfeld (May&#x27;s main publisher) and the jurist Euchar Albrecht Schmid established the &quot;Foundation Press Fehsenfeld &amp; Co.&quot; (&quot;Stiftungs-Verlag Fehsenfeld &amp; Co.&quot;) in Radebeul. In 1915, the name changed to &quot;Karl May Press&quot; (&quot;Karl-May-Verlag&quot; (KMV)). The KMV consolidated the rights to May&#x27;s works from internal discord and from other publishers. Third-hand revisions of these texts were added to the series &quot;Karl May&#x27;s Gesammelte Reiseerzählungen&quot;, which was renamed to &quot;Karl May&#x27;s Gesammelte Werke (und Briefe)&quot;. The existing 33 volumes of the original series were also revised, some extensively. By 1945 there were 65 volumes. The press is exclusive to May&#x27;s work and subsidiary literature. Besides the &quot;Gesammelte Werke&quot; (the classical &quot;green volumes&quot;), which have 91 volumes today, the press has a huge reprint programme.

The Karl May Press aims to rehabilitate May from literary criticism and to support the Karl May Foundation. In 1921, Fehsenfeld left and in 1960, the foundation fell to Klara May&#x27;s estate, and thus the Press is owned by the Schmid family. In 1959, due to censorship in the Soviet occupation zone and East Germany, the Press moved to Bamberg (Germany). In 1963, when copyright ended, the Press began commercialising May&#x27;s works. After German reunification, in 1996, the Press took a second office in Radebeul. The name &quot;Karl May&quot; is a registered trade mark of the &quot;Karl May Verwaltungs- und Vertriebs-GmbH&quot;, which belongs to the Karl May Press.

=== Museums ===

==== Radebeul ====
The Karl May Museum is in the Villa Shatterhand in Radebeul and contains artifacts from May&#x27;s life as well as from life on the American frontier and Native American life of that era. It was founded in 1928 by May&#x27;s widow and an eccentric Austrian named Ernst Tobis. When the Nazis took over Germany, they appropriated the museum and the image of May, and were especially focused on swastikas that appeared in some of the Native American artwork. Hitler Youth were encouraged to visit the museum and hear stories from Tobis. After World War II, the original museum remained in East Germany and a replica was built in Bamberg in West Germany. From 1956 to 1984, the museum in Radebeul was called the &quot;Indianer Museum&quot;, because May&#x27;s books were suppressed by the East German government; its original name was restored in 1986. Around 2010, controversy arose over scalps, some of them from Native Americans, that were in the museum&#x27;s collection.

==== Hohenstein-Ernstthal ====
The &quot;Karl May House&quot; (&quot;Karl-May-Haus&quot;) is the three-centuries-old weaver house where May was born. Since 12 March 1985, it has been a memorial and museum. It shows an original weaving room and non-German book editions. The garden has been arranged according to May&#x27;s description in his memoirs.

Opposite the house is the International Karl May Heritage Center (&quot;Karl-May-Begegnungsstätte&quot;), which is used for events and special exhibitions. In Hohenstein-Ernstthal, called &quot;Karl May Home Town&quot; since 1992, every May-related place has a commemorative plaque. These places are connected by a &quot;Karl May Path&quot; (&quot;Karl-May-Wanderweg&quot;). Outside the city lies the &quot;Karl May Cave&quot; (&quot;Karl-May-Höhle&quot;), where May found shelter during his criminal times.

=== Societies ===
In the 1890s, there were Karl May clubs. Today, various entities focus on research about the author. These organisations exist in German-speaking regions, the Netherlands, Australia and Indonesia. While such societies are responsible for the release of most May-related periodicals, for example, &quot;Der Beobachter an der Elbe&quot;, &quot;Karl-May-Haus Information&quot;, &quot;Wiener Karl-May-Brief&quot;, and &quot;Karl May in Leipzig&quot;, the magazine &quot;Karl May &amp; Co.&quot; is published independently.

The &quot;Karl May Society&quot; (KMG), founded on 22 March 1969, is the largest organisation, with approximately 1800 members. The KMG publishes &quot;Jahrbuch&quot;, &quot;Mitteilungen&quot;, &quot;Sonderhefte der Karl-May-Gesellschaft&quot;, and &quot;KMG-Nachrichten&quot; and reprints. Since 2008 and in cooperation with the Karl May Foundation and the Karl May Press, the KMG has published the critiqued edition of &quot;Karl Mays Werke&quot;. This project was initiated by Hans Wollschläger and Hermann Wiedenroth in 1987.

<text>Nada Surf is an American alternative rock band formed in New York City in 1992, consisting of Matthew Caws (guitar, vocals), Ira Elliot (drums), and Daniel Lorca (bass, backing vocals).

After initially operating under the name Helicopter, Caws and Lorca switched to Nada Surf. In 1995, Ira Elliot joined on drums, and they met Ric Ocasek, former frontman of the Cars, who produced their debut album, &quot;High/Low&quot;, in 1996. Despite experiencing significant success with their single &quot;Popular&quot; and touring extensively, their follow-up album, &quot;The Proximity Effect&quot;, was not well received by their record label, Elektra, resulting in the band being dropped, and they self-released the album.

Throughout the early 2000s, members worked regular day jobs while continuing to create music, leading to the release of the critically acclaimed album &quot;Let Go&quot;, in 2002. Their subsequent albums included &quot;The Weight Is a Gift&quot; (2005), &quot;Lucky&quot; (2008), the covers album &quot;If I Had a Hi-Fi&quot; (2010), and &quot;The Stars Are Indifferent to Astronomy&quot; (2012). They issued their eighth studio album, &quot;You Know Who You Are&quot;, in 2016, and followed it with &quot;Never Not Together&quot; in 2020. Their tenth studio album, &quot;Moon Mirror&quot;, was released in September 2024.

==History==
===1990s===
Nada Surf was formed in 1992 by Matthew Caws and Daniel Lorca. They originally went by the name Helicopter but later changed it to Nada Surf, which Caws said is &quot;actually referring to something much more existential, it&#x27;s just surfing on nothing. Being lost in your head or in your imagination but you know, whenever I listen to music I always find myself off somewhere. Somewhere in space. You know, in mental space and it&#x27;s a reference to that.&quot; Caws and Lorca met at the Lycée Français de New York; both spent some of their childhood in France and Belgium, and played in many bands, including the Cost of Living and Because Because Because. Their first drummer, Daniel (later alluded to in the song &quot;The Plan&quot;, from the album &quot;High/Low&quot;), was replaced by Aaron Conte, with whom the band recorded their first 7&quot;, &quot;The Plan/Telescope&quot; (1994), as well as the demo tape &quot;Tafkans&quot;, the raw version of &quot;High/Low&quot;. Those raw versions were later released on their second 7&quot;, &quot;Deeper Well/Pressure Free&quot; (1995), on the EP &quot;Karmic&quot;, and on &quot;North 6th Street&quot;.

In 1995, Conte left the band and was replaced by Ira Elliot, former drummer of the Fuzztones, a band from the 1980s New York scene, and of whom both Caws and Lorca were fans. After a Blonde Redhead show at the Knitting Factory, Nada Surf met former Cars frontman and Weezer producer Ric Ocasek. With little hope, they presented him with a copy of &quot;Tafkans&quot;. Three weeks later, Ocasek called back with news of his intention to produce the album. Soon after, the band was finalizing a contract with Elektra Records through an executive, Josh Deutsch.

On June 18, 1996, they released their debut album, &quot;High/Low&quot;, which was recorded and mastered within a nineteen-day period. Prior to this, the band released &quot;Karmic&quot; on No. 6 Records, a label run by Elektra A&amp;R head Terry Tolkin. That summer, as Nada Surf toured the United States with Superdrag, their song &quot;Popular&quot; became a summer anthem, and the band toured overseas.

In 1998, they released &quot;The Proximity Effect&quot;, their follow-up album, in Europe. Produced by Fred Maher, the album gained little commercial success in the US. Their record label, thinking the album lacked a hit like &quot;Popular&quot;, had the band record several covers, including &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; (The dBs) and &quot;Why Are You So Mean to Me?&quot; (Vitreous Humor), to use as singles. Tired of the requirements of the A&amp;R director, the band judged the album was perfect as-is (even though Elektra suggested the inclusion of an acoustic version of &quot;Popular&quot;), and broke their contract. As a consequence, Elektra did not release the album in the US and dropped the band while they were on a promotional tour in Europe. Despite these events, this album was critically acclaimed in France, where the band did a 30-show tour the following year.

===2000s===
In 2000, Nada Surf released &quot;The Proximity Effect&quot; in the United States on their own label, MarDev (named after Caws&#x27; maternal grandmother, Margaret Devereux Lippitt, daughter of the painter Margaret Walthour Lippitt), after being dropped by Elektra. Subsequently, the band performed at their record release party at Luna Lounge in New York City and toured extensively for several months to rebuild their North American fan base.

From 1999 to 2002, the band members took regular day jobs: Caws worked at a Brooklyn record store called Earwax, Lorca worked on some computer projects, and Elliot did drum and guitar session work for other artists. Caws later referred to these times as a period of luxury, and the record store job as his &quot;favorite job ever.&quot;

In 2002, they released &quot;Let Go&quot;, a critically acclaimed album that included the single &quot;Inside of Love&quot;. They went on tour for several months, including many European festivals, in the summer of 2003. Mostly recorded the year before, the album was produced by their friends Louie Lino and Chris Fudurich, who had engineered &quot;The Proximity Effect&quot;; the band paid them with $1 and $5 bills, the money earned from tour merchandise sales.

In 2005, Nada Surf released &quot;The Weight Is a Gift&quot;, an album produced by Chris Walla (among others), and finished touring for this album in October of the following year. The record was made during a month spent at John Vanderslice&#x27;s Tiny Telephone Studios in San Francisco.

In 2008, the band released &quot;Lucky&quot;, an album made with producer John Goodmanson at the Robert Lang Studios in Seattle, from material recorded the year before. That same year, their song &quot;No Quick Fix&quot; was featured as the Spinner MP3 of the Day, and they were featured on the cover of &quot;Beyond Race Magazine&quot; for the publication&#x27;s winter issue.

===2010s===
In 2010, the band released &quot;If I Had a Hi-Fi&quot;, an album of covers including songs by the likes of Depeche Mode, Kate Bush, Spoon, and The Go-Betweens. Milwaukee noise rock band IfIHadAHiFi reciprocally titled their next album &quot;Nada Surf EP+3&quot;.

In January 2012, Nada Surf released &quot;The Stars Are Indifferent to Astronomy,&quot; an album that included the single &quot;Waiting for Something&quot;.

Later in 2012, Caws, who had moved to England, recorded acoustic versions of five of the songs from &quot;The Stars Are Indifferent to Astronomy&quot; as b-sides, in collaboration with record producer Lee Russell. The material was released as &quot;The Dulcitone Files EP.&quot; The group released a compilation of rarities called &quot;B-Sides&quot; in 2014.

Nada Surf&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;You Know Who You Are&quot;, with an official release date of March 4, 2016, was released for streaming in late February 2016.

In 2018, for the fifteenth anniversary of &quot;Let Go&quot;, the charity album &quot;Standing at the Gates: The Songs of Nada Surf&#x27;s Let Go&quot; was released to benefit the ACLU and The Pablove Foundation. It consists of tracks from the band&#x27;s 2002 album, covered by various artists, including the Long Winters, Ed Harcourt, Ron Gallo, Rogue Wave, Holly Miranda, and Aimee Mann.

===2020s===
In November 2019, Nada Surf announced that their ninth studio album, &quot;Never Not Together&quot;, would be released via Barsuk Records (US) and City Slang (UK) on February 7, 2020. At the time of the announcement, they released a new single and lyric video, &quot;Something I Should Do&quot;. According to the band, their experience while celebrating the 15th anniversary of &quot;Let Go&quot; in 2017 pushed them into a different creative mindset. They recorded many demos before thinning down the selection in an effort to find focus. The band also announced a major world tour to celebrate the album&#x27;s release, starting on January 14 in Seattle, before moving through the US and also encompassing dates in the UK, Germany, Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. Another single followed in December, entitled &quot;Looking for You&quot;, accompanied by a music video directed by the band themselves.

Nada Surf opened the new decade with a single release, &quot;So Much Love&quot;, on January 8, the third from &quot;Never Not Together&quot;. It garnered &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s attention, who reviewed the single favorably. Double J in Australia added it and the previous single &quot;Something I Should Do&quot; to their playlist. On January 15, Nada Surf began their &quot;Never Not Together&quot; world tour at Neptune Theatre in Seattle.

On May 14, 2024, Nada Surf announced that their new album, titled &quot;Moon Mirror&quot;, would be released on September 13.

==Musical style==
Nada Surf have been described as both an indie rock and &quot;melodic&quot; alternative rock band, with their lyrics characterized as &quot;witty and literate&quot;. They have also been classified as part of &quot;nerd rock revival&quot;, along with Weezer, Superdrag, and Cake.

Longtime rhythm guitarist and lyricist Steve Klein left the band in late 2013. During their lengthy recording career, the band have released twelve studio albums, one live album, two EPs, and four cover albums.

After forming in 1997, New Found Glory released their debut studio album &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot; in 1999. The band then released their self-titled major label debut in 2000, with the album&#x27;s song &quot;Hit or Miss&quot; peaking at number 15 the Alternative Songs chart. In 2002, the band became mainstream with their album &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot; and the album&#x27;s hit &quot;My Friends Over You&quot;. The group&#x27;s popularity continued with their 2004 album &quot;Catalyst&quot;, of which the video for &quot;All Downhill From Here&quot; was nominated for a VMA for Breakthrough Video of the Year. Led by single &quot;It&#x27;s Not Your Fault&quot;, the mid-tempo and critically acclaimed &quot;Coming Home&quot; followed in 2006. The release showcased a temporary move to an alternative rock style instead of their usual pop punk sound. The quintet returned to their energetic roots with the release of &quot;Not Without a Fight&quot; in 2009. They have since released four more albums; &quot;Radiosurgery&quot; in 2011, &quot;Resurrection&quot; in 2014, &quot;Makes Me Sick&quot; in 2017, and their tenth studio album &quot;Forever + Ever x Infinity&quot; in 2020.

Emerging as part of the second wave of pop punk in the late 1990s, music critics consider them a key pioneer of the genre. Often labelled the &quot;godfathers of pop punk&quot;, AllMusic notes how their &quot;raucous, fast-paced anthems carried them through the decades&quot;, whilst crediting them for &quot;practically serving alongside the work of Blink-182 as the blueprint to the entire genre for the early 2000s.&quot; &quot;Rock Sound&quot; have championed their &quot;classic sugar sweet sound&quot;, which combines &quot;pop-punk and hardcore in one neat package.&quot; &quot;Alternative Press&quot; have praised the group for their &quot;innovative and entirely irresistible fusion of punk melodies and hardcore breakdowns.&quot; As such, the band is considered highly influential in the development of the subgenre easycore.

==History==

===Formation and debut releases (1997–1999)===
The origins of New Found Glory date back to 1997 when Jordan Pundik (vocals) and Ian Grushka (bass) played together in the bands Inner City Kids and Flip 60. After disbanding Flip 60, they recruited Stephen Klein (guitar), who Pundik met at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and had previously played with him in the band Fallview. The three began to jam together. Practicing in Grushka&#x27;s garage, they later invited Joe &quot;Taco Joe&quot; Marino to play drums. Shortly thereafter, Chad Gilbert (lead guitar), former vocalist of Shai Hulud, joined to complete the quintet.

Pundik later stated the band name was created while he and Klein were working at Red Lobster together; &quot;We came up with A New Found Glory, we wrote it on a napkin. I think we pulled some of it from &quot;A Newfound Interest in Massachusetts&quot; by the Get Up Kids&quot;. 
The band recorded their debut EP, &quot;It&#x27;s All About the Girls&quot; (1997) in a friend&#x27;s apartment, and the EP was distributed by local independent label Fiddler Records. Soon after, Marino was replaced by current drummer Cyrus Bolooki after two rehearsal sessions. The band went on to tour up and down the East Coast and quickly sold out the entire pressing of the EP. The band&#x27;s underground success soon caught the attention of Eulogy Recordings and the quintet subsequently signed shortly afterwards in order to increase distribution of their music.

Following the success of their EP, the band recorded their debut full-length album, &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot; (1999), initially selling one-page insert copies at their shows supporting MxPx. Richard Reines, co-founder of Drive-Thru Records had also noted their devout following and held talks with the band. Drive-Thru subsequently signed the five-piece and paid Eulogy $5,000 to license &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot;, which went on to sell more than 300,000 copies.

===Rise in popularity and stardom (2000–2005)===
The five-piece signed their first proper record deal with Drive-Thru Records, and released an EP of cover songs from film soundtracks entitled &quot;From the Screen to Your Stereo&quot; in 2000. Drive-Thru&#x27;s relationship with MCA Records ensured that the smaller label&#x27;s more popular bands would be picked up by the major. Later that year, debut single &quot;Hit or Miss&quot; peaked at No. 15 on the US Modern Rock Chart, which helped propel the band to a mainstream audience. Subsequently, their self-titled second album and major label debut &quot;New Found Glory&quot; (2000) reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers chart, and spent 21 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. In a &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine article years later, they referred to the album as the band&#x27;s &quot;Essential Purchase&quot;. They wrote, &quot;marking one of the biggest and quickest improvements in alternative music, the major label debut hurled them to the forefront of the punk scene barely 12 months after its predecessor. Packed with infectious melodies and sing-along anthems, it would see them jostling with the likes of Blink-182 for the genre&#x27;s crown.&quot; The album also marked the official debut of the band&#x27;s new moniker, which dropped the indefinite article &quot;A&quot; from their original name due to some fans struggling to find the band&#x27;s records in stores. The album was certified gold by the RIAA. In 2001 the band performed at EdgeFest Calgary.

Between 2002 and 2004, the band experienced the height of their popularity with headline slots on the Warped Tour with Blink-182 and a supporting tour with Green Day. Third album &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot; was released on June 11, 2002, and peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The record spawned two popular singles; &quot;My Friends Over You&quot; and &quot;Head on Collision&quot;. Following the success of the album, the band headlined the 2002 Warped Tour and later saw the album certified gold by the RIAA.

The lead single for their fourth album, &quot;All Downhill from Here&quot; reached number eleven in the Rock Chart before &quot;Catalyst&quot; (2004) was released. The album peaked at a career-high number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 146,000 copies in its first week. The heavier style of the record, which included some metal and new wave influences, was due to the comparisons that magazines and other media outlets would make between New Found Glory and other popular bands. Chad Gilbert stated: &quot;Well, when &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot; came out and we were doing that Honda Civic Tour, we were getting compared to bands like Good Charlotte and Simple Plan we were angry with that. At that point, we were getting compared to more pop bands and we aren&#x27;t a pop band.&quot; The band promoted the album with a supporting tour with Green Day during the fall of 2004 on the American Idiot Tour. The song &quot;This Disaster&quot; was featured in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;Madden NFL 2005&quot;, and &quot;At Least I&#x27;m Known for Something&quot; was featured in EA&#x27;s &quot;Burnout 3: Takedown&quot;. This became the band&#x27;s third record to be certified gold by the RIAA.

===Maturity into later albums (2006–2009)===

Demos for the next album were tracked with long-term friend and studio engineer Paul Miner, before the band worked with Thom Panunzio (Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen, Ozzy Osbourne) having moved into a house together in Malibu, California called the Morning View Mansion to write and record. Gilbert took into the studio a book containing over 40 riff ideas that were written during the previous tour. Unlike their previous releases, Gilbert and Pundik also worked on lyrics alongside primary lyricist Steve Klein for the first time. The band had decided against working with Neal Avron, who had produced the band&#x27;s three previous albums, as they wanted to try something different. Their fifth album titled &quot;Coming Home&quot; was released on September 19, 2006, with first single, &quot;It&#x27;s Not Your Fault&quot; in July 2006. The release proved popular with many critics giving the album positive reviews. It was acclaimed for its &quot;matured and nuanced songwriting&quot;, and was generally recognised as being the band&#x27;s most mature work.

&quot;From the Screen to Your Stereo Part II&quot;, the band&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;From the Screen to Your Stereo&quot; – a full-length album, containing 11 songs plus one bonus track for the Japanese edition and iTunes – was released on September 18, 2007, via Drive-Thru Records. The first and only single from the album was &quot;Kiss Me&quot;, which would become the band&#x27;s last charting single. The music video can be viewed on MySpace. In March 2008, a compilation named &quot;Hits&quot; was released. Two previously unreleased songs, &quot;Situations&quot; and &quot;Constant Static&quot;, are also featured on the album. This was their last release on Drive-Thru/Geffen before signing with independent labels, Bridge Nine Records and Epitaph Records. In April 2008, the band released a new EP &quot;Tip of the Iceberg&quot; on CD, 7-inch and through digital music outlets on Bridge 9 Records containing both new material that paid homage to their melodic hardcore influences. The CD also included an extra disc from the band&#x27;s side project, the International Superheroes of Hardcore, named &quot;Takin&#x27; It Ova!&quot;.
Their sixth studio album, &quot;Not Without a Fight&quot;, was released on March 10, 2009, and was produced by Mark Hoppus. It was released through the band&#x27;s new label, Epitaph Records. Hoppus has said that during recording, they had felt like a different band altogether. The lead single from the album was called &quot;Listen to Your Friends&quot;. The music video for the song was filmed in Los Angeles. The single was released December 23, 2008, in the US &amp; a day earlier in the UK, both via iTunes &amp; AmazonMP3. Following the album&#x27;s release, the quintet set out on the &quot;Not Without a Fight Tour&quot; with support from Set Your Goals, Bayside and Shai Hulud.

The video for second single &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Her Pull You Down&quot; premiered on October 15, and was released on October 20 via limited orange and sky blue vinyl prints. On October 17 the band played a free show for around 120 fans packed into the studio where the band played a setlist made up of fan requests. 

===Return to pop punk sound and line-up change (2010–2013)===
A special edition re-release to celebrate the tenth anniversary of their self-titled album was released on January 26, 2010, through Geffen Records. The additional material included new liner notes, demos, b-sides, &quot;The Story So Far&quot; DVD and a remix of debut single &quot;Hit or Miss&quot; by the late Jerry Finn. A full tour was also confirmed where the band would play the record in its entirety, with support from Saves the Day, Hellogoodbye and Fireworks. On the 29th and 30 May, the band headlined the Pop-Punk festival &quot;SlamDunk Festival&quot; held in Hatfield and Leeds. Shortly before the start of the band&#x27;s commemorative tour, Gilbert visited his doctor for pneumonia. After suspicious cells were discovered in his thyroid, he underwent surgery which caused him to miss the first three dates of the new tour. Anthony Raneri of Bayside replaced him for this period. The surgery was a success. Later that year, the band headlined the Slam Dunk Festival along with Alkaline Trio and Capdown.

New Found Glory began the new year by participating in the 2011 Soundwave Festival, and were later confirmed for the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August. The band also played a full tribute set to The Ramones with Marky Ramone on drums at The Bamboozle 2011 Festival.

They returned to the studio in April to record their seventh album, titled &quot;Radiosurgery&quot; with Neal Avron the producer having also produced their second, third and fourth albums. Chad Gilbert has said that &quot;Radiosurgery&quot; &quot;is the most upbeat, fun record we&#x27;ve ever recorded. Catchy but not in a fake pop sounding way. I wanted to go back to more of the roots of punk rock and pop punk and put a whole new NFG spin on it. The record goes from song to song never letting up the energy.&quot; The lead single and title track, &quot;Radiosurgery&quot; was released on August 2. In March 2012, New Found Glory had announced via their website that they would be a part of the Vans Warped Tour lineup. New Found Glory will celebrate the 10th anniversary of Sticks And Stones by going on a small club tour in the fall, all around the country.

In November Pundik said that the band will take a break and won&#x27;t release a new album until 2014. AbsolutePunk confirmed that the band would be releasing &quot;A Very New Found Glory Christmas&quot; via cassette tape on December 1, as well as a live album some time in 2013. The band recorded three new songs which are on their upcoming live album &quot;Kill It Live&quot; released on October 7. Also announced in this period was the departure of founding member and rhythm guitarist Steve Klein, due to him being charged with multiple counts of inappropriate contact with a minor. On their Facebook page the band noted that there had been some disparity in the intended direction progressing forward, and that Steve and the remaining members had experienced insurmountable differences &quot;over the years.&quot;

On March 2, 2021, it was reported that Steve Klein was convicted of indecent exposure.

===Continuing as a quartet, Hopeless Records era (2014–present)===
On February 25, 2014, the band announced an 11 date UK tour with main support by The Story So Far, stopping in cities around the country including London, Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Cardiff and Leeds. On May 18, the band announced on their Facebook page that they would release a new album in the fall of 2014. They also mentioned that it would be released by Hopeless Records. On May 27, the band announced that they had left Epitaph Records and would be signing to Hopeless Records, where their new album will be released in the fall of 2014. On August 5, they released a new single &quot;Selfless&quot; from the upcoming album &quot;Resurrection&quot;. The band also filmed a music video to release with the single. On September 9, they released a new single &quot;Ready and Willing&quot; from the upcoming album &quot;Resurrection&quot;. The band also filmed a music video to release with the single. On October 7, 2014, they released &quot;Resurrection&quot;. On July 22, 2015, the band announced they would reissue the album on October 8, retitled &quot;Resurrection: Ascension&quot;. It features two brand new studio tracks, two reworked songs and three acoustic tracks. On the day of announcement, they also rereleased &quot;Vicious Love&quot; featuring Hayley Williams on vocals.
On September 28, 2016, New Found Glory announced via Facebook that pre-production had officially began for a new album and have since been posting pictures showing the progress of the writing process. On January 25, 2017, the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Makes Me Sick&quot; was announced for release on April 28. The first single &quot;Happy Being Miserable&quot;, along with its music video, was released on February 15, 2017. The influence for the music video came from the pie eating scene from the movie &quot;Stand By Me&quot;.

In January 2019, New Found Glory announced the third instalment of their cover series, the &quot;From the Screen to Your Stereo 3&quot; EP, for release in May.

On February 20, 2019, the band released the first song/video off their new cover series EP &quot;From The Screen To Your Stereo 3&quot;. They covered &quot;The Power Of Love&quot; by Huey Lewis and the News, which comes from the &quot;Back To The Future&quot; movies. It was also revealed they&#x27;ll be covering songs from &quot;Frozen&quot;, &quot;Rocky&quot; and &quot;Twilight&quot; on the new release.

On February 10, 2020, the band announced their tenth studio album &quot;Forever + Ever x Infinity&quot;, slated for release for May 29, 2020. The album features 15 songs, as the band did not want to cut any of the recorded material for the album. The first single, &quot;Greatest of All Time&quot;, released the same day.

On April 16, 2020, the band confirmed that they had delayed the release of &quot;Forever + Ever x Infinity&quot; to June 19, 2020, because it would initially be sold exclusively at Target and the band didn&#x27;t want fans to have to go to the store during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In December 2021, the band released &quot;December&#x27;s Here&quot;, a collection of 10 original Christmas songs through Hopeless Records. Shortly after this, guitarist Chad Gilbert shared that he had been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called pheochromocytoma. After two weeks in the hospital, surgeons were able to remove the cancer. In January 2022, he was officially cancer free. 

In 2022, the band embarked on a full US tour with Four Year Strong and Be Well, celebrating the 20th Anniversary of Sticks and Stones. Stickers were distributed at the merch table announcing their next album: &quot;New Found Glory - &quot;Make the Most of It&quot;. A new 14 song acoustic LP by New Found Glory. Featuring 7 brand new songs and 7 classics reimagined. Mixed by Mark Trombino. Coming Soon on Revelation Records.&quot; Gilbert had to leave the tour abruptly due to back pains, only to discover that the cancer had regrown in certain parts of his body including a spine vertebrae which was ultimately removed, and that he would be unable to perform with the band for the rest of the year as a result.

==Side projects and collaborations==
The International Superheroes of Hardcore is a side project of all members of the band and features Gilbert on vocals and Pundik on guitar, with the remaining members playing the same instruments they play in New Found Glory. All the members use pseudonyms for their characters in the band (e.g. Gilbert is known as Captain Straightedge). The band&#x27;s songs are humorous in nature with titles such as &quot;Back to the Future&quot; and &quot;Superhero Sellouts&quot;. The band also recorded an internet-only music video for &quot;Dig My Own Grave&quot; with director Joseph Pattisall. While not currently active, the band went to Australia in February 2011 for the Soundwave Festival, replacing Sum 41 after frontman Deryck Whibley fell ill with pneumonia for the Melbourne and Adelaide shows. The band did not play the Perth show of the festival, due to Captain Straight Edge himself falling sick too. In an interview in 2012, Ian Grushka and Steve Klein announced that the band had been scrapped.

In April 2008 a compilation from the &quot;Punk Goes...&quot; series, called &quot;Punk Goes Crunk&quot;, was released, and features New Found Glory covering &quot;Tennessee&quot;, originally by Arrested Development. New Found Glory had previously released another cover song, &quot;Heaven&quot;, on &quot;Punk Goes Metal&quot;.

During &quot;Not Without a Fight&quot; tour, a split EP with Shai Hulud titled &quot;Not Without a Heart Once Nourished by Sticks and Stones Within Blood Ill-Tempered Misanthropy Pure Gold Can Stay&quot; was exclusively released. There were two colors limited to a total of only 500 copies and only for sale from either Shai Hulud or New Found Glory at these shows.

Dashboard Confessional were to be main support for New Found Glory&#x27;s headline American tour in 2010. However, shortly before the tour was due to commence, Dashboard withdrew for personal reasons and the tour was subsequently canceled. A split EP, titled &quot;Swiss Army Bro-Mance&quot; had initially been due for sale on the previously cancelled tour, but was later made available online on a limited pressing of 2,500 copies. The two bands played several acoustic dates in December 2010.

On December 10, 2011, New Found Glory performed a live set for &quot;Guitar Center Sessions&quot; on DirecTV. The episode included an interview with program host, Nic Harcourt.

==Style, influences and legacy==
New Found Glory are widely recognized for their fast and energetic pop-punk music. The band temporarily moved to an alternative rock style with their album &quot;Coming Home&quot; in 2006, and is sometimes described as such in general. The aforementioned &quot;Coming Home&quot; was viewed as a change in direction for the band with its more layered and mid-tempo sound and has been described as a &quot;somber, honest, polished and alternative record.&quot; They have also been described as melodic hardcore. The band&#x27;s traditional sound has been described as &quot;chunky and melodic&quot;, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noting their penchant for &quot;catchy, riffy punk-rock.&quot; &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; writer Megan Ritt called the band &quot;paragons&quot; of the pop punk genre and noted how &quot;the seasoned Floridian rockers are renowned for their heartfelt guitar anthems.&quot; The band&#x27;s music typically builds upon verse-chorus song structures, combining pop-influenced melodies with fast punk rock tempos, hardcore-tinged breakdowns, and often gang vocals. Their fusion of pop punk with hardcore breakdowns has been labeled as easycore, a genre they are considered to have helped pioneer and named with one of their tours.

Critics have praised the band for their ability to write infectious hooks and the sincerity of their lyrics, often about growing up and relationships. Chad Gilbert has noted that, &quot;if the delivery is honest and real, that&#x27;s what keeps it from being the corniest thing you&#x27;ve ever heard before. New Found Glory is a band that people enjoy listening to not because we give off this harsh message. We write about who we are and what affects us in life and those are our relationships&quot;. Bassist Ian Grushka has stated that &quot;all of the lyrics are based on real life experiences. A song can be created from something one of us is going through or a conversation we&#x27;ve had.&quot; While also adding, &quot;We only really talk about personal things that have affected us first-hand, our songs are about emotions rather than some political agenda.&quot; Rhythm guitarist Steve Klein was the band&#x27;s primary lyricist, while lead guitarist Chad Gilbert is the main composer of the songs. Although since the recording of &quot;Coming Home&quot;, Klein, Pundik and Gilbert all worked on lyrics together. They have recorded covers of The Ramones, Shelter, Lifetime, Gorilla Biscuits, Bing Crosby, Nat King Cole, The Wonders, Limahl, Aerosmith, Cyndi Lauper, Peter Cetera, Bryan Adams, Celine Dion, Sixpence None The Richer, Bob Dylan, When In Rome, Go West, Lisa Loeb, The Cardigans, Goo Goo Dolls, Simple Minds, Yann Tiersen, Madonna, Tears For Fears and Survivor. New Found Glory&#x27;s influences include Green Day, Texas Is the Reason, Björk, Silverchair, They Might Be Giants, The Get Up Kids, Earth Crisis, Discount, The Promise Ring, Blink-182, Unwritten Law, Britney Spears, The Beatles, Pennywise, NOFX, Bad Religion, Superchunk, Dinosaur Jr., Nirvana, Sparklehorse, Rocket from the Crypt, Descendents, My Bloody Valentine, and Sugar.

In recent years, the band have been cited for their long lasting influence on contemporary pop-punk music. Josh Martin, bassist for band The Wonder Years, has claimed that &quot;Influentially, when you think about the top three pop-punk bands of all time...it&#x27;s Blink-182, New Found Glory and Green Day. At least in my brain, they&#x27;re on that level eternally.&quot; In 2009, &quot;Alternative Press&quot; included &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot; in their &quot;Classic Albums of &#x27;99&quot; feature. Brendan Manley wrote, &quot;Like its title implies, &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot; is the sonic transcript of a glorious, fleeting time for NFG - and for pop-punk. But just as gold never loses its luster, it&#x27;s only fitting that 10 years later, &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot; still shines&quot;. Likewise, Jason Heller of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; reflected how their debut &quot;snuck beneath the radar to become a massive influence on the new millennium&#x27;s eruption of pop-punk.&quot;

<text>Christopher Ballew (born May 28, 1965) is an American musician best known as the lead singer and bassist of the alternative rock group the Presidents of the United States of America. He also performs and records as a children&#x27;s artist under the pseudonym Caspar Babypants.

Ballew&#x27;s career in music traces back to his street performances in a duo called Egg, during his time in Boston in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Following a brief period in Los Angeles performing with Beck, Ballew returned to Washington and formed the Presidents of the United States of America in 1993, a band that lasted until 2015. In 1998, he started a solo project known as the Giraffes, which turned into a band the following year. In 2009, he launched Caspar Babypants, a children&#x27;s music project that has since released numerous albums. He has also issued music under his own name. Ballew uses unconventional instruments, notably a two-string &quot;basitar&quot;, and he performs without distortion pedals, relying on the natural distortion of the amplifier. He is married to collage artist Kate Endle.

==Biography==
===Early life and musical beginnings===
Ballew grew up in Seattle and attended middle and high school at Bush School, where he met Dave Dederer, with whom he would later form the Presidents of the United States of America. In the late 1980s and early &#x27;90s, Ballew lived in Boston, where he performed as a street musician in a duo called Egg with Phil Franklin (later of Caroliner Rainbow and Sunburned Hand of the Man). Many of Ballew&#x27;s songs with Egg would become well-known Presidents songs, most notably &quot;Naked and Famous&quot;, which is performed by Egg as a bonus track on a 2005 reissue of the Presidents&#x27; eponymous debut album. The two members of Egg were also part of the experimental triple-bass guitar ensemble Balls, which released a 12-inch EP in 1991. While in Boston, Ballew also played briefly with Mary Lou Lord, and with Mark Sandman of Treat Her Right and Morphine, in a duo called Supergroup, in which they developed the oddly-stringed instruments that would become a staple of both the Presidents&#x27; and Morphine&#x27;s sound.

===The Presidents of the United States of America===
Ballew moved to Los Angeles in the early 1990s, where he shared an apartment with musician Beck and played in his live band. Ballew told &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot; that playing with Beck &quot;was the beginning of my professional career as a guy getting paid to make music.&quot; He returned to his native Washington in 1993 and started the Presidents of the United States of America. The band released six studio albums, then split up in July 2015.

In 1998, Ballew released a solo album credited to the Giraffes. The recording project turned into a band between 1999 and 2000. For the live version of the Giraffes, Ballew was joined by Jason Staczek (organ, clarinet) and Mike Musburger (drums).

===Caspar Babypants===
Ballew&#x27;s first brush with children&#x27;s music came in 2002, when he recorded and donated an album of traditional children&#x27;s songs to the nonprofit Program for Early Parent Support, titled &quot;PEPS Sing a Long!&quot; Although this was a positive experience for him, he did not consider making music for children until he met his wife, collage artist Kate Endle. Her art inspired Ballew to consider making music that &quot;sounded like her art looked&quot;, as he has said. Ballew began writing original songs and digging up nursery rhymes and folk songs in the public domain to interpret and make his own. The first album, &quot;Here I Am!&quot;, was recorded during the summer of 2008 and released in February 2009.

In 2009, Ballew launched a project targeted toward toddlers, called Caspar Babypants. Ballew uses a three-string acoustic guitar when performing Caspar Babypants songs. Caspar Babypants has released numerous albums, all with exclamatory titles such as &quot;Here I Am!&quot;, &quot;More Please!&quot;, &quot;This Is Fun!&quot;, &quot;Sing Along!&quot;, &quot;Hot Dog!&quot;, &quot;I Found You!&quot;, &quot;Baby Beatles!&quot;, &quot;Rise and Shine!&quot;, &quot;Night Night!&quot;, &quot;Beatles Baby!&quot;, &quot;Away We Go!&quot;, &quot;Winter Party!&quot;, &quot;Jump for Joy!&quot;, &quot;Keep It Real!&quot;, &quot;Flying High!&quot;, &quot;Bug Out!&quot;, and &quot;Happy Heart!&quot;.

===Other projects===
In 2015, fifteen years after the last official release, Chris Ballew put together &quot;We Hear Music&quot;, a 33-track double album consisting of previously unreleased Giraffes material. The record was shared privately with a few fans through the internet, with a note allowing the recipients to redistribute the music freely.

Ballew also publishes as a solo artist under his own name. His first album, &quot;I Am Not Me&quot;, came out in July 2021. In 2022, he released two albums, &quot;Soul Unfolded&quot; and &quot;Primitive God&quot;.

In June 2022, he performed &quot;Peaches&quot; with &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic.

==Equipment==
During his time with the Presidents, Ballew was endorsed by Epiphone Guitars and Orange amplifiers, utilizing an Epiphone SG-400 guitar (converted into a two-string &quot;basitar&quot;), as well as an AD200B MK 3 200-Watt Bass Head from Orange. No distortion pedals are used live; just the natural distortion of the amp is heard. Regarding his two-string &quot;basitar&quot;, Ballew admits: &quot;I&#x27;m technically not really a bass player, although, I play as if I&#x27;m playing bass lines, a lot of times I strum like (on a) guitar and make chords.&quot;

==Personal life==
Ballew is married to collage artist Kate Endle.

<text>Moonraker is the third novel by the British author Ian Fleming to feature his fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond. It was published by Jonathan Cape on 5 April 1955 and featured a cover design conceived by Fleming. The plot is derived from a Fleming screenplay that was too short for a full novel, so he added the passage of the bridge game between Bond and the industrialist Hugo Drax. In the latter half of the novel, Bond is seconded to Drax&#x27;s staff as the businessman builds the Moonraker, a prototype missile designed to defend England. Unknown to Bond, Drax is German, an ex-Nazi now working for the Soviets; his plan is to build the rocket, arm it with a nuclear warhead, and fire it at London. Uniquely for a Bond novel, &quot;Moonraker&quot; is set entirely in Britain, which raised comments from some readers, complaining about the lack of exotic locations.

&quot;Moonraker&quot;, like Fleming&#x27;s previous novels, was well received by critics. It plays on several 1950s fears, including attack by rockets (following the V-2 strikes of the Second World War), nuclear annihilation, Soviet communism, the re-emergence of Nazism and the &quot;threat from within&quot; posed by both ideologies. Fleming examines Englishness, and the novel shows the virtues and strength of England. Adaptations include a broadcast on South African radio in 1956 starring Bob Holness and a 1958 &quot;Daily Express&quot; comic strip. The novel&#x27;s name was used in 1979 for the eleventh official film in the Eon Productions Bond series and the fourth to star Roger Moore as Bond; the plot was significantly changed from the novel to include excursions into space.

==Plot==
The British Secret Service agent James Bond is asked by his superior, M, to join him at M&#x27;s club, Blades. A club member, the multi-millionaire businessman Sir Hugo Drax, is winning considerable money playing bridge, seemingly against the odds. M suspects Drax is cheating, and while claiming indifference, is concerned as to why a multi-millionaire and national hero would cheat. Bond confirms Drax&#x27;s deception and manages to turn the tables—aided by a stacked deck of cards—and wins £15,000 (about seven times his own annual salary).

Drax is the product of a mysterious background, purportedly unknown even to himself. Presumed to have been a British Army soldier during the Second World War, he was badly injured and stricken with amnesia in the explosion of a bomb planted by a German saboteur at a British field headquarters. After extensive rehabilitation in an army hospital, he returned home to become a wealthy industrialist. After building his fortune and establishing himself in business and society, Drax started building the &quot;Moonraker&quot;, Britain&#x27;s first nuclear missile project, intended to defend Britain against its Cold War enemies. The Moonraker rocket is an upgraded V-2 rocket using liquid hydrogen and fluorine as propellants; to withstand the ultra-high combustion temperatures of its engine, it uses columbite, in which Drax had a monopoly. Because the rocket&#x27;s engine can withstand high heat, the Moonraker is able to use these powerful fuels, expanding its range across Europe.

After a Ministry of Supply security officer working at the project is shot dead, M assigns Bond to replace him and also to investigate what has been going on at the missile-building base, located between Dover and Deal on the south coast of England. All the rocket scientists working on the project are German. At his post on the complex, Bond meets Gala Brand, a beautiful police Special Branch officer working undercover as Drax&#x27;s personal assistant. Bond also uncovers clues concerning his predecessor&#x27;s death, concluding that the man may have been killed for witnessing a submarine off the coast.

Bond catches Drax&#x27;s henchman Krebs snooping through his room. Later, an attempted assassination by triggering a landslide nearly kills Bond and Brand, as they sunbathe beneath the Dover cliffs. Drax takes Brand to London, where she discovers the truth about the Moonraker by comparing her own launch trajectory figures with those in a notebook picked from Drax&#x27;s pocket. She is captured by Krebs, and finds herself captive in a secret radio homing station—intended to serve as a beacon for the missile&#x27;s guidance system—in the heart of London. While Brand is being taken back to the Moonraker facility by Drax, Bond gives chase, but is also captured by Drax and Krebs.

Drax tells Bond that he was never a British soldier and has never suffered from amnesia: his real name is Graf Hugo von der Drache, the German commander of a Werwolf commando unit. Disguised in an Allied uniform, he was the saboteur whose team placed the car bomb at the army field headquarters, only to be injured himself in the detonation. The amnesia story was simply a cover he used while recovering in hospital to avoid recognition, although it would lead to a whole new British identity. Drax remains a dedicated Nazi, bent on revenge against England for the wartime defeat of his Fatherland and his prior history of social slights suffered as a youth growing up in an English boarding school before the war. He explains that he now means to destroy London, with a Soviet-supplied nuclear warhead that has been secretly fitted to the Moonraker. His company is also selling the British pound short in order to make a huge profit from the disaster.

Brand and Bond are imprisoned where the blast from the Moonraker&#x27;s engines will incinerate them, to leave no trace of them once the missile is launched. Before the launch, the couple escape. Brand gives Bond the coordinates he needs to redirect the gyros and send the Moonraker into the sea. Having been in collaboration with Soviet Intelligence all along, Drax and his henchmen escape by Soviet submarine—only to be killed as the vessel makes its escape through the waters onto which the Moonraker has been re-targeted. After their debriefing at headquarters, Bond meets up with Brand, expecting her company—but they part ways after she reveals that she is engaged to a fellow Special Branch officer.

==Background and writing history==
In early 1953 the film producer Alexander Korda read a proof copy of &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, and informed its author, Ian Fleming, that he was excited by the book, but that it would not make a good basis for a film. Fleming told the producer that his next book was to be an expansion of an idea for a screenplay, set in London and Kent, adding that the location would allow &quot;for some wonderful film settings&quot;.
Fleming undertook a significant amount of background research in preparation for writing &quot;Moonraker&quot;; he asked his fellow correspondent on &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Anthony Terry, for information on the Second World War German resistance force—the Werewolves—and German V-2 rockets. The latter was a subject on which he wrote to the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke and the British Interplanetary Society. Fleming also visited the Wimpole Street psychiatrist Eric Strauss to discuss the traits of megalomaniacs; Strauss lent him the book &quot;Men of Genius&quot;, which provided the link between megalomania and childhood thumb-sucking. Fleming used this information to give Drax diastema, a common result of thumb-sucking. According to his biographer Andrew Lycett, Fleming &quot;wanted to make &quot;Moonraker&quot; his most ambitious and personal novel yet.&quot; Fleming, a keen card player, was fascinated by the background to the 1890 royal baccarat scandal, and when in 1953 he met a woman who had been present at the game, he questioned her so intently that she burst into tears.

In January 1954 Fleming and his wife, Ann, travelled to their Goldeneye estate in Jamaica for their annual two-month holiday. He had already written two Bond novels, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, which had been published in April 1953, and &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, whose publication was imminent. He began writing &quot;Moonraker&quot; on his arrival in the Caribbean. He later wrote an article for &quot;Books and Bookmen&quot; magazine describing his approach to writing, in which he said: &quot;I write for about three hours in the morning ... and I do another hour&#x27;s work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written ... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day.&quot; By 24 February he had written over 30,000 words, although he wrote to a friend that he felt like he was already parodying the two earlier Bond novels. Fleming&#x27;s own copy bears the following inscription, &quot;This was written in January and February 1954 and published a year later. It is based on a film script I have had in my mind for many years.&quot; He later said that the idea for the film had been too short for a full novel, and that he &quot;had to more or less graft the first half of the book onto my film idea in order to bring it up to the necessary length&quot;.

Fleming considered several titles for the story; his first choice had been &quot;The Moonraker&quot;, until Noël Coward reminded him of a novel of the same name by F. Tennyson Jesse. Fleming then considered &quot;The Moonraker Secret&quot;, &quot;The Moonraker Plot&quot;, &quot;The Inhuman Element&quot;, &quot;Wide of the Mark&quot;, &quot;The Infernal Machine&quot;, &quot;Mondays are Hell&quot; and &quot;Out of the Clear Sky&quot;. George Wren Howard of Jonathan Cape suggested &quot;Bond &amp; the Moonraker&quot;, &quot;The Moonraker Scare&quot; and &quot;The Moonraker Plan&quot;, while his friend, the writer William Plomer, suggested &quot;Hell is Here&quot;; the final choice of &quot;Moonraker&quot; was a suggestion by Wren Howard.

Although Fleming provided no dates within his novels, two writers have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole. John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both of whom have written books on behalf of Ian Fleming Publications—put the events of &quot;Moonraker&quot; in 1953; Griswold is more precise, and considers the story to have taken place in May of that year.

==Development==

===Plot inspirations===

The locations draw from Fleming&#x27;s personal experiences. &quot;Moonraker&quot; is the only Bond novel that takes place solely in Britain, which gave Fleming the chance to write about the England he cherished, such as the Kent countryside, including the White Cliffs of Dover, and London clubland. Fleming owned a cottage in St Margaret&#x27;s at Cliffe, near Dover, and he went to great lengths to get the details of the area right, including lending his car to his stepson to time the journey from London to Deal for the car chase passage. Fleming used his experiences of London clubs for the background of the Blades scenes. As a clubman, he enjoyed membership of Boodle&#x27;s, White&#x27;s and the Portland Club, and a combination of Boodles and the Portland Club is thought to be the model for Blades; the author Michael Dibdin found the scene in the club to be &quot;surely one of the finest things that Ian Fleming ever did&quot;.

The early chapters of the novel centre on Bond&#x27;s private life, with Fleming using his own lifestyle as a basis for Bond&#x27;s. Fleming used further aspects of his private life, such as his friends, as he had done in his previous novels: Hugo Drax was named after his brother-in-law Hugo Charteris and a navy acquaintance Admiral Sir Reginald Aylmer Ranfurly Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, while Fleming&#x27;s friend Duff Sutherland (described as &quot;a scruffy looking chap&quot;) was one of the bridge players at Blades. The name of the Scotland Yard superintendent, Ronnie Vallance, was made up from those of Ronald Howe, the actual assistant commissioner at the Yard, and of Vallance Lodge &amp; Co., Fleming&#x27;s accountants. Other elements of the plot came from Fleming&#x27;s knowledge of wartime operations carried out by T-Force, a secret British Army unit formed to continue the work of the Fleming-established 30 Assault Unit.

===Characters===
According to the author Raymond Benson, &quot;Moonraker&quot; is a deeper and more introspective book than Fleming&#x27;s previous work, which allows the author to develop the characters further. As such, Bond &quot;becomes something more than ... [the] cardboard figure&quot; that he had been in the previous two novels. The start of the book concentrates on Bond at home and his daily routines, which Fleming describes as &quot;Elastic office hours from around ten until six, ... evenings spent playing cards in the company of a few close friends, ... or making love, with rather cold passion, to one of three similarly disposed married women.&quot; This lifestyle was largely modelled on Fleming&#x27;s own, which the journalist and writer Matthew Parker sees as showing &quot;a sourness&quot; in the author&#x27;s character. According to Chancellor, two of Bond&#x27;s other vices were also displayed in the book: his fondness for gambling—illegal except in private members clubs in 1955—and excessive drink and drug taking, neither of which were frowned upon in post-war upper class circles. In preparation for beating Drax at cards, Bond consumes a vodka martini, a carafe of vodka shared with M, two bottles of champagne and a brandy; he also mixes a quantity of Benzedrine, an amphetamine, into a glass of the champagne. According to &quot;The Times&quot; journalist and historian Ben Macintyre, to Fleming the alcohol consumption &quot;meant relaxation, ritual and reliability&quot;. Benzedrine was regularly taken by troops during the war to remain awake and alert, and Fleming was an occasional consumer.

Drax is physically abnormal, as are many of Bond&#x27;s later adversaries. He has very broad shoulders, a large head and protruding teeth with diastema; his face is badly scarred from a wartime explosion. According to the writers Kingsley Amis and Benson—both of whom subsequently wrote Bond novels—Drax is the most successful villain in the Bond canon. Amis considers this to be &quot;because the most imagination and energy has gone into his portrayal. He lives in the real world ... [and] his physical presence fills &quot;Moonraker&quot;. The view is shared by Chancellor, who considers Drax &quot;perhaps the most believable&quot; of all Fleming&#x27;s villains. The cultural historian Jeremy Black writes that as with Le Chiffre and Mr Big—the villains of the first two Bond novels—Drax&#x27;s origins and war history are vital to an understanding of the character. Like several other antagonists in the Bond canon, Drax was German, reminding readers of a familiar threat in 1950s Britain. Because Drax is without a girlfriend or wife he is, according to the norms of Fleming and his works, abnormal in Bond&#x27;s world.

Benson considers Brand to be one of the weakest female roles in the Bond canon and &quot;a throwback to the rather stiff characterization of Vesper Lynd&quot; from &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. Brand&#x27;s lack of interest in Bond removes sexual tension from the novel; she is unique in the canon for being the one woman that Bond does not seduce. The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and Tony Bennett write that the perceived reserve shown by Brand to Bond was not due to frigidity, but to her engagement to a fellow police officer.

M is another character who is more fully realised than in the previous novels, and for the first time in the series he is shown outside a work setting at the Blades club. It is never explained how he received or could afford his membership of the club, which had a restricted membership of only 200 gentlemen, all of whom had to show £100,000 in cash or gilt-edged securities. Amis, in his study &quot;The James Bond Dossier&quot;, considers that on M&#x27;s salary his membership of the club would have been puzzling; Amis points out that in the 1963 book &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; it is revealed that M&#x27;s pay as head of the Secret Service is £6,500 a year.

==Style==
Benson analysed Fleming&#x27;s writing style and identified what he described as the &quot;Fleming Sweep&quot;: a stylistic technique that sweeps the reader from one chapter to another using &#x27;hooks&#x27; at the end of each chapter to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next: Benson feels that the sweep in &quot;Moonraker&quot; was not as pronounced as Fleming&#x27;s previous works, largely due to the lack of action sequences in the novel.

According to the literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek, in his examination of 20th-century British spy novels, in &quot;Moonraker&quot; Fleming uses a technique closer to the detective story than to the thriller genre. This manifests itself in Fleming placing clues to the plot line throughout the story, and leaving Drax&#x27;s unveiling of his plan until the later chapters. Black sees that the pace of the novel is set by the launch of the rocket (there are four days between Bond&#x27;s briefing by M and the launch) while Amis considers that the story to have a &quot;rather hurried&quot; ending.

&quot;Moonraker&quot; uses a literary device Fleming employs elsewhere, that of having a seemingly trivial incident between the main characters—the card game—that leads to the uncovering of a greater incident—the main plot involving the rocket. Dibdin sees gambling as the common link, thus the card game acts as an &quot;introduction to the ensuing encounter ... for even higher stakes&quot;. Savoye sees this concept of competition between Bond and villain as a &quot;notion of game and the eternal fight between Order and Disorder&quot;, common throughout the Bond stories.

==Themes==

Parker describes the novel as &quot;a hymn to England&quot;, and highlights Fleming&#x27;s description of the white cliffs of Dover and the heart of London as evidence. Even the German Krebs is moved by the sight of the Kent countryside in a country he hates. The novel places England—and particularly London and Kent—in the front line of the cold war, and the threat to the location further emphasises its importance. Bennett and Woollacott consider that &quot;Moonraker&quot; defines the strengths and virtues of England and Englishness as being the &quot;quiet and orderly background of English institutions&quot;, which are threatened by the disturbance Drax brings.

The literary critic Meir Sternberg considers the theme of English identity can be seen in the confrontation between Drax and Bond. Drax—whose real name is German for dragon—is in opposition to Bond, who takes the role of Saint George in the conflict.

As with &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, &quot;Moonraker&quot; involves the idea of the &quot;traitor within&quot;. Drax, real name Graf Hugo von der Drache, is a &quot;megalomaniac German Nazi who masquerades as an English gentleman&quot;, while Krebs bears the same name as Hitler&#x27;s last Chief of Staff. Black sees that, in using a German as the novel&#x27;s main enemy, &quot;Fleming ... exploits another British cultural antipathy of the 1950s. Germans, in the wake of the Second World War, made another easy and obvious target for bad press.&quot; &quot;Moonraker&quot; uses two of the foes feared by Fleming, the Nazis and the Soviets, with Drax being German and working for the Soviets; in &quot;Moonraker&quot; the Soviets were hostile and provided not just the atomic bomb, but support and logistics to Drax. &quot;Moonraker&quot; played on fears of the audiences of the 1950s of rocket attacks from overseas, fears grounded in the use of the V-2 rocket by the Nazis during the Second World War. The story takes the threat one stage further, with a rocket based on English soil, aimed at London and &quot;the end of British invulnerability&quot;.

==Publication and reception==

===Publication history===
&quot;Moonraker&quot; was published in the UK by Jonathan Cape in hardback format on 5 April 1955 with a cover designed by Kenneth Lewis, following Fleming&#x27;s suggestions of using a stylised flame motif; the first impression was of 9,900 copies. The US publication was by Macmillan on 20 September that year. In October 1956 Pan Books published a paperback version of the novel in the UK, which sold 43,000 copies before the end of the year. In December that year the US paperback was published under the title &quot;Too Hot to Handle&quot; by Permabooks. This edition was rewritten to Americanise the British idioms used, and Fleming provided explanatory footnotes such as the value of English currency against the dollar. Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.

===Reception===

Fleming&#x27;s friend—and neighbour in Jamaica—Noël Coward considered &quot;Moonraker&quot; to be the best thing Fleming had written to that point: &quot;although as usual too far-fetched, not quite so much so as the last two ... His observation is extraordinary and his talent for description vivid.&quot; Fleming received numerous letters from readers complaining about the lack of exotic locations; one of which protested &quot;We want taking out of ourselves, not sitting on the beach in Dover.&quot;

Julian Symons, writing in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, found &quot;Moonraker&quot; &quot;a disappointment&quot;, and considered that &quot;Fleming&#x27;s tendency ... to parody the form of the thriller, has taken charge in the second half of this story.&quot; Maurice Richardson, in his review for &quot;The Observer&quot;, was more welcoming: &quot;Do not miss this&quot;, he urged, saying that &quot;Mr. Fleming continues to be irresistibly readable, however incredible&quot;. Hilary Corke, writing in &quot;The Listener&quot;, thought that &quot;Fleming is one of the most accomplished of thriller-writers&quot;, and considered that &quot;Moonraker&quot; &quot;is as mercilessly readable as all the rest&quot;. Corke warned Fleming away from being over-dramatic, declaring that &quot;Mr Fleming is evidently far too accomplished to need to lean upon these blood-and-thunder devices: he could keep our hair on end for three hundred pages without spilling more blood than was allowed to Shylock.&quot; The reviewer in &quot;The Scotsman&quot; considered that Fleming &quot;administers stimuli with no mean hand ... &#x27;Astonish me!&#x27; the addict may challenge: Mr Fleming can knock him sideways.&quot;

John Metcalf for &quot;The Spectator&quot; thought the book &quot;utterly disgraceful—and highly enjoyable ... without [&quot;Moonraker&quot;] no forthcoming railway journey should be undertaken&quot;, although he also considered that it was &quot;not one of Mr. Fleming&#x27;s best&quot;. Anthony Boucher, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, was equivocal, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know anyone who writes about gambling more vividly than Fleming and I only wish the other parts of his books lived up to their gambling sequences&quot;. Richard Lister in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; thought that &quot;Mr. Fleming is splendid; he stops at nothing.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Al Manola believed that the &quot;British tradition of rich mystery writing, copious description and sturdy heroism all blend nicely&quot; in &quot;Moonraker&quot;, providing what he considered was &quot;probably the best action novel of the month&quot;.

==Adaptations==

 The actor John Payne attempted to take up the option on the film rights to the book in 1955, but nothing came of the attempt. The Rank Organisation also came to an agreement to make a film, but this likewise fell through. 

The novel was not one of Fleming&#x27;s stories acquired by Eon Productions in 1961; in 1969 the company acquired the rights and commissioned Gerry Anderson to produce and co-write a screenplay. Anderson and Tony Barwick prepared a 70-page treatment that was never filmed, but some elements were similar to the final screenplay of &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;.

The first adaptation of &quot;Moonraker&quot; was for South African radio in 1956, with Bob Holness providing the voice of Bond. According to &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;listeners across the Union thrilled to Bob&#x27;s cultured tones as he defeated evil master criminals in search of world domination&quot;. The novel was adapted as a comic strip that was published in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper and syndicated worldwide. The adaptation was written by Henry Gammidge and illustrated by John McLusky, and ran daily from 30 March to 8 August 1959. Titan Books reprinted the strip in 2005 along with &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; as a part of the &quot;Casino Royale&quot; anthology.

&quot;Moonraker&quot; was used as the title for the eleventh James Bond film, produced by Eon Productions and released in 1979. Directed by Lewis Gilbert and produced by Albert R. Broccoli, the film features Roger Moore in his fourth appearance as Bond. The Nazi-inspired element of Drax&#x27;s motivation in the novel was indirectly preserved with the &quot;master race&quot; theme of the film&#x27;s plot. Since the screenplay was original, Eon Productions and Glidrose Publications authorised the film&#x27;s writer, Christopher Wood, to produce his second novelization based on a film; this was entitled &quot;James Bond and Moonraker&quot;. Elements of &quot;Moonraker&quot; were also used in the 2002 film &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, with a scene set in the Blades club. The actress Rosamund Pike, who plays Miranda Frost in the film, later said that her character was originally to have been named Gala Brand.

<text>Kevin Michael Griffin(born October 1, 1968) is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. He is best known as the lead vocalist of the rock band Better Than Ezra.

His songs have been performed and recorded by artists such as Taylor Swift, Train, Sugarland, James Blunt, Dierks Bentley, The Record Company, Wilder Woods, Moon Taxi, Saint Motel, Andy Grammer, Christina Perri, Trombone Shorty, Howie Day, Barenaked Ladies, Tom Morello, Boys Like Girls, Blondie, Chase Rice, The Struts, Andrew McMahon, Matt Nathanson, Meat Loaf, Missy Higgins, and many others.

He is a co-founder and partner of the Pilgrimage Music &amp; Cultural Festival in Franklin, Tennessee. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s review of the festival&#x27;s inaugural year was positive, saying it had &quot;an A-list lineup (arguably the best curated of the year)&quot; and &quot;established itself as a festival to watch.&quot; Performers at the festival have included Justin Timberlake, Foo Fighters, Willie Nelson, Chris Stapleton, The Killers, Dave Matthews Band, Maren Morris, The Black Keys, Cage the Elephant, and Black Pumas.

Griffin formed the alternative rock band Better Than Ezra in 1988. They had platinum success in the 1990s with hits such as &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;In the Blood&quot;, and &quot;Desperately Wanting&quot;, and have continued in the 2000s with hits such as &quot;Extra Ordinary&quot;, &quot;A Lifetime&quot;, and &quot;Juicy&quot;. The band continues to tour and produce new recordings, the most recent of which is &quot;All Together Now&quot;, released in September 2014. As a performer, Griffin is known for singing in falsetto, inviting audience members onstage to play guitar, and interrupting his own songs with verses of well-known rock songs. He is also a mimic, imitating singers such as Aaron Neville, Bruce Springsteen, and Dave Matthews.

His first solo album, &quot;Anywhere You Go&quot;, was released on October 4, 2019. Griffin also performs as part of the supergroup Ezra Ray Hart with Mark McGrath of Sugar Ray and Emerson Hart of Tonic.

==Personal life==
Griffin was born in Atlanta, Georgia, and grew up in Monroe, Louisiana. He attended River Oaks School, where he met his bandmate Jim Payne. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English and a minor in political science from Louisiana State University in 1990. He was a member of the Kappa Sigma fraternity. He took the LSAT with the intention of attending law school and working in entertainment law. He then took a job with Creative Artists Agency in Los Angeles during the early 1990s, before Better Than Ezra achieved commercial success.

Griffin and his family largely resided in the Uptown neighborhood of New Orleans until Hurricane Katrina devastated the city in 2005. He purchased a home in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles in July 2006 and in 2011, he sold his house and moved to Franklin, Tennessee, with his family.

==Career==
Griffin has produced, written, and co-written platinum albums and songs that have sold more than thirty million copies.

Griffin&#x27;s first number-one with Better Than Ezra was the 1995 song &quot;Good&quot;, and it stayed on top of the Alternative Chart for seven weeks. It reached No. 1 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, No. 3 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and No. 30 on the Billboard Hot 100.

His other number-one songs are Howie Day&#x27;s &quot;Collide&quot; and Sugarland&#x27;s &quot;Stuck Like Glue&quot; in 2011, which became the eleventh most-downloaded song in country music history.

In 2010, his song &quot;Breathless&quot; was covered by Taylor Swift at the Hope for Haiti telethon, the most widely distributed telethon in history.

Griffin has won numerous BMI pop and country awards, and his song &quot;Scar&quot;, with Missy Higgins, won Song of the Year at the Australian ARIA Awards.

In 2018, he was an adjunct professor at NYU&#x27;s Clive Davis School of Recorded Music.

He is active with Better Than Ezra&#x27;s foundation, MusiCares, and St. Jude. In 2020, through a series of livestream acoustic performances, he was able to raise more than $220K for various charities helping those adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>13 Other Dimensions is an album by the American band the Giraffes. It was released through the Seattle label My Own Planet, on CD and vinyl in 1998. It is essentially a solo effort by Chris Ballew (ex-Presidents of the United States of America), recorded in Ballew&#x27;s basement. The album was published as being a work by a fictional band composed of Ballew&#x27;s childhood stuffed animals. Ballew&#x27;s name appears nowhere on the album.

The Giraffes record was the first of a planned series of six made under a volume agreement with Ballew&#x27;s main label, Columbia; however only two albums were made, the second was released by Orange Recordings. Roni Sarg, in &quot;Tucson Weekly&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Rhythm and Views&quot; section, postulates that the putative stars of the Giraffes were chosen for their &quot;photogenic cuteness&quot;.

<text>Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (), or more formally Lieutenant General and General Governor of Ireland, was the title of the chief governor of Ireland from the Williamite Wars of 1690 until the Partition of Ireland in 1922. This spanned the Kingdom of Ireland (1541–1800) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1801–1922). The office, under its various names, was often more generally known as the [[Viceroy]], and his wife was known as the vicereine. The government of Ireland in practice was usually in the hands of the Lord Deputy up to the 17th century, and later of the Chief Secretary for Ireland.

==Role==

The Lord Lieutenant possessed a number of overlapping roles. He was
* the representative of the King (the &quot;viceroy&quot;);
* the head of the executive in Ireland;
* (on occasion) a member of the English or British Cabinet;
* the fount of mercy, justice and patronage;
* (on occasion) commander-in-chief in Ireland.
* Grand Master of the Order of St. Patrick

Prior to the Act of Union 1800 which abolished the Irish parliament, the Lord Lieutenant formally delivered the Speech from the Throne outlining his Government&#x27;s policies. His Government exercised effective control of parliament through the extensive exercise of the powers of patronage, namely the awarding of peerages, baronetcies and state honours. Critics accused successive viceroys of using their patronage power as a corrupt means of controlling parliament. On one day in July 1777, Lord Buckinghamshire as Lord Lieutenant promoted 5 viscounts to earls, 7 barons to viscounts, and created 18 new barons. The power of patronage was used to bribe MPs and peers into supporting the Act of Union 1800, with many of those who changed sides and supported the Union in Parliament awarded peerages and honours for doing so.

==Constitutional structure==
The Lord Lieutenant was advised in the governance by the Irish Privy Council, a body of appointed figures and hereditary title holders, which met in the Council Chamber in Dublin Castle and on occasion in other locations. The chief constitutional figures in the viceregal court were:

* Chief Secretary for Ireland: From 1660, originally the chief administrator, but by the end of the 19th century effectively the prime minister in the administration, with the Lord Lieutenant becoming a form of constitutional monarch.
* Under-Secretary for Ireland: The head of the civil service in Ireland.
* Lord Justices: Three office-holders who acted in the Lord Lieutenant&#x27;s stead during his absence. The Lord Justices were before 1800 the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, the Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, and the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh as Primate of All Ireland.

Lords Lieutenant were appointed for no set term but served for &quot;His/Her Majesty&#x27;s pleasure&quot; (in reality, as long as wished by the British government). When a ministry fell, the Lord Lieutenant was usually replaced by a supporter of the new ministry.

==Officeholders==

Until the 16th century, Anglo-Irish noblemen such as the 8th Earl of Kildare and the 9th Earl of Kildare traditionally held the post of Justiciar or Lord Deputy. From the Tudor reconquest of Ireland the post was increasingly given to Englishmen, whose loyalty to the Crown was not doubted.

Although it was the faith of the overwhelming majority on the island of Ireland, Roman Catholics were excluded being able to hold the office from Glorious Revolution in 1688 until the Government of Ireland Act 1920.

Until 1767 Lords Lieutenant did not live full-time in Ireland. Instead they resided in Ireland during meetings of the Irish Parliament (a number of months every two years). However the British cabinet decided in 1765 that full-time residency should be required to enable the Lord Lieutenant to keep a full-time eye on public affairs in Ireland.

==Importance of the post==
The post ebbed and flowed in importance, being used on occasion as a form of exile for prominent British politicians who had fallen afoul of the Court of St. James&#x27;s or Westminster. On other occasions it was a stepping stone to a future career. Two Lords Lieutenant, Lord Hartington and the Duke of Portland, went from Dublin Castle to 10 Downing Street as Prime Minister of Great Britain, in 1756 and 1783 respectively.

By the mid-to-late 19th century the post had declined from being a powerful political office to that of being a symbolic quasi-monarchical figure who reigned, not ruled, over the Irish administration. Instead it was the Chief Secretary for Ireland who became central, with him, not the Lord Lieutenant, sitting on occasion in the British cabinet.

==Official residence==
The official residence of the Lord Lieutenant was the Viceregal Apartments in Dublin Castle, where the Viceregal Court was based. Other summer or alternative residences used by Lord Lieutenant or Lords Deputy included Abbeville in Kinsealy, Chapelizod House, in which the Lord Lieutenant lived while Dublin Castle was being rebuilt following a fire but which he left due to the building being supposedly haunted, Leixlip Castle and St. Wolstan&#x27;s in Celbridge. The Geraldine Lords Deputy, the 8th Earl of Kildare and the 9th Earl of Kildare, being native Irish, both lived in, among other locations, their castle in Maynooth, County Kildare. Lord Essex owned Durhamstown Castle near Navan in County Meath, a short distance from the residence of the Lord Bishop of Meath at Ardbraccan House.

The decision to require the Lord Lieutenant to live full-time in Ireland necessitated a change in living arrangements. As the location of the Viceregal Court, the Privy Council and of various governmental offices, Dublin Castle became a less than desirable full-time residence for the viceroy, vicereine and their family. In 1781 the British government bought the former ranger&#x27;s house in Phoenix Park to act as a personal residence for the Lord Lieutenant. The building was rebuilt and named the Viceregal Lodge. It was not however until major renovations in the 1820s that the Lodge came to be used regularly by viceroys. It is now known as Áras an Uachtaráin and is the residence of the President of Ireland.

By the mid-19th century, Lords Lieutenant lived in the Castle only during the Social Season (early January to St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, 17 March), during which time they held social events; balls, drawing rooms, etc. By tradition the coat of arms of each Lord Lieutenant was displayed somewhere in the Chapel Royal in Dublin Castle; some were incorporated into stained glass windows, some carved into seating, etc.

==Irish attitudes==

The office of Lord Lieutenant, like the British government in Ireland, was greatly resented by some Irish nationalists, though it was supported with varying degrees of enthusiasm by the minority Irish unionist community. Some Lords Lieutenant did earn a measure of popularity in a personal capacity among nationalists. From the early 19th century, calls were made frequently for the abolition of the office and its replacement by a &quot;Secretary of State for Ireland&quot;. A bill to effect this change was introduced in Parliament in 1850 by the government of Lord John Russell but was subsequently withdrawn when it became clear that it would receive insufficient support to pass. The office survived until the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922.

Irish nationalists throughout the 19th century and early 20th century campaigned for a form of Irish self-government. Daniel O&#x27;Connell sought repeal of the Act of Union, while later nationalists such as Charles Stewart Parnell sought a lesser measure, known as home rule. All four Home Rule bills provided for the continuation of the office.

==Abolition==
The Government of Ireland Act 1920 divided Ireland into two devolved entities inside the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. Two institutions were meant to join the two; a Council of Ireland (which was hoped would evolve into a working all-Ireland parliament) and the Lord Lieutenant who would be the nominal chief executive of both regimes, appointing both prime ministers and dissolving both parliaments. In fact only Northern Ireland functioned, with Southern Ireland being quickly replaced by the Irish Free State with its own Governor-General. The Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922 provided that, once the Parliament of Northern Ireland opted out of the Free State, the office of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland would be abolished and its residual powers transferred to the new position of Governor of Northern Ireland. This duly happened on 8 December 1922, two days after the Free State Constitution came into force.
