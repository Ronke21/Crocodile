<text>British Honduras was a Crown colony on the east coast of Central America, south of Mexico, from 1783 to 1964, then a self-governing colony, renamed Belize in June 1973, until September 1981, when it gained full independence as Belize. British Honduras was the last continental possession of the United Kingdom in the Americas.

The colony grew out of the Treaty of Versailles (1783) between Britain and Spain, which gave the British rights to cut logwood between the Hondo and Belize rivers. The Convention of London (1786) expanded this concession to include the area between the Belize and Sibun rivers. In 1862, the Settlement of Belize in the Bay of Honduras was declared a British colony called British Honduras, and the Crown&#x27;s representative was elevated to a lieutenant governor, subordinate to the governor of Jamaica.

==History==

===Maya emigration and conflict===
As the British consolidated their settlement and pushed deeper into the interior in search of mahogany in the late 18th century, they encountered resistance from the Maya. In the second half of the 19th century, however, a combination of events outside and inside the colony redefined the position of the Maya. During the Caste War of Yucatán, a devastating struggle that halved the population of the area between 1847 and 1855, thousands of refugees fled to British Honduras. The Legislative Assembly had given large landowners in the colony firm titles to their vast estates in 1855 but did not allow the Maya to own land. The Maya could only rent land or live on reservations. Nevertheless, most of the refugees were small farmers, who by 1857 were growing considerable quantities of sugar, rice, corn, and vegetables in the Northern District (now Corozal and Orange Walk districts). In 1857, the town of Corozal, then six years old, had 4,500 inhabitants, second in population only to Belize Town, which had 7,000 inhabitants. Some Maya who had fled the strife in the north, but had no wish to become British subjects, settled in the remote Yalbac Hills, just beyond the woodcutting frontier in the northwest. 

By 1862, about 1,000 Maya established themselves in 10 villages in this area, with the center in San Pedro. One group of Maya, led by Marcos Canul, attacked a mahogany camp on the Bravo River in 1866, demanding ransom for their prisoners and rent for their land. A detachment of soldiers from the West India Regiments (WIR) sent to San Pedro was defeated by the Maya later that year. Early in 1867, more than 300 WIR troops marched into the Yalbac Hills and destroyed several Mayan villages, provision stores, and granaries in an attempt to drive them out of the district. The Maya returned, however, and in April 1870, Canul and his men marched into Corozal and occupied the town. Two years later, Canul and 150 men attacked the barracks at Orange Walk. After several hours of fighting, Canul&#x27;s group retired. Canul, mortally wounded, died on 1 September 1872. That battle was the last serious attack on the colony. In the 1880s and 1890s, Mopán and Kekchí Maya fled from forced labor in Guatemala and came to British Honduras. They settled in several villages in southern British Honduras, mainly around San Antonio in Toledo District. The Maya could use Crown lands set aside as reservations, but they did had rights over the lands. 

Under the policy of indirect rule, a system of elected alcaldes (mayors), adopted from Spanish local government, linked these Maya to the colonial administration. However, the remoteness of the area of British Honduras in which they settled, combined with their largely subsistence way of life, resulted in the Mopán and Kekchí Maya maintaining more of their traditional way of life and becoming less assimilated into the colony than the Maya of the north. The Mopán and Kekchí Maya maintained their languages and a strong sense of identity. But in the north, the distinction between Maya and Spanish was increasingly blurred, and a Mestizo culture emerged. In different ways and to different degrees, then, the Maya who returned to British Honduras in the 19th century became incorporated into the colony as poor and dispossessed ethnic minorities. By the end of the 19th century, the ethnic pattern that remained largely intact throughout the 20th century was in place: Protestants largely of African descent, who spoke either English or Creole, lived in Belize Town; the Roman Catholic Maya and Mestizos spoke Spanish and lived chiefly in the north and west; and the Roman Catholic Garifuna who spoke English, Spanish, or Garifuna and settled on the southern coast.

===Formal establishment of the colony, 1862–1871===
The forestry industry&#x27;s control of land and its influence in colonial decision making hindered the development of agriculture and the diversification of the economy. In many parts of the Caribbean, large numbers of former slaves, some of whom had engaged in the cultivation and marketing of food crops, became landowners. British Honduras had vast areas of sparsely populated, unused land. Nevertheless, land ownership was controlled by a small European monopoly, thwarting the evolution of a Creole landowning class from the former slaves. Rather than the former slaves, it was the Garifuna, Maya and Mestizos who pioneered agriculture in 19th-century British Honduras. These groups either rented land or lived as squatters. However, the domination of the land by forestry interests continued to stifle agriculture and kept much of the population dependent on imported foods.

Landownership became even more consolidated during the economic depression of the mid-19th century. Exports of mahogany peaked at over 4 million linear metres in 1846 but fell to about 1.6 million linear meters in 1859 and 8,000 linear meters in 1870, the lowest level since the beginning of the century. Mahogany and logwood continued to account for over 80 percent of the total value of exports, but the price of these goods was so low that the economy was in a state of prolonged depression after the 1850s. Major results of this depression included the decline of the old settler class, the increasing consolidation of capital and the intensification of British landownership. The British Honduras Company emerged as the predominant landowner of the Crown colony. The firm originated in a partnership between one of the old settler families and a London merchant and was registered in 1859 as a limited company. The firm expanded, often at the expense of others who were forced to sell their land.

Largely as a result of the costly military expeditions against the Maya, the expenses of administering the new colony of British Honduras increased, and that at a time of severe depression in the economy. Large landowners and merchants dominated the Legislative Assembly, which controlled the colony&#x27;s revenues and expenditures. Some of the landowners also had involvement in commerce, but their interest differed from those of the other merchants of Belize Town. The former group resisted the taxation of land and favoured an increase in import duties; the latter preferred the opposite. Moreover, the merchants in the town felt relatively secure from Mayan attacks and reluctant to contribute toward the protection of mahogany camps, whereas the landowners felt that they should not be required to pay taxes on lands given inadequate protection. These conflicting interests produced a stalemate in the Legislative Assembly, which failed to authorise the raising of sufficient revenue. Unable to agree among themselves, the members of the Legislative Assembly surrendered their political privileges and asked for the establishment of direct British rule in return for the greater security of Crown colony status. The new constitution was inaugurated in April 1871 and the Legislative Council became the new legislature.

===Colonial order, 1871–1931===

Under the new constitution of 1871, the Lieutenant Governor and the Legislative Council, consisting of five ex-officio or &quot;official&quot; and four appointed or &quot;unofficial&quot; members, governed British Honduras. This constitutional change confirmed and completed a change in the locus and form of power in the colony&#x27;s political economy that had evolved during the preceding half-century. The change moved power from the old settler oligarchy to the boardrooms of British companies and to the Colonial Office in London. In 1875, the British Honduras Company became the Belize Estate and Produce Company, a London-based business that owned about half of all the privately held land in the colony. The new company was the chief force in British Honduras&#x27;s political economy for over a century. This concentration and centralisation of capital meant that the direction of the colony&#x27;s economy was henceforth determined largely in London. It also signalled the eclipse of the old settler elite. 

By about 1890, most commerce in British Honduras was in the hands of a clique of Scottish and German merchants, most of them newcomers. This clique encouraged consumption of imported goods and thus furthered British Honduras&#x27;s dependence on Britain. The European minority exercised great influence in the colony&#x27;s politics, partly because it was guaranteed representation on the wholly appointed Legislative Council. The manager of the Belize Estate and Produce Company, for example, was automatically a member of the council, while members of the emerging Creole elite were excluded from holding seats on the council. The Creoles requested in 1890 that some seats on the council be opened to election (as had occurred in Canada and New Zealand) in the hope of winning seats, but the Legislative Council refused. In 1892, the Governor appointed several Creole members, but whites remained the majority. On 11 December 1894, a crowd of 200–600 rioters rampaged throughout the Belize Town central business district in response to Sir Cornelius Alfred Moloney&#x27;s rejection of a petition to improve working conditions. The crowd looted stores and freed a labour leader imprisoned in a police station before the riot eventually subsided. 

A brief revival in the forestry industry took place early in the next century as new demands for forest products came from the United States. Exports of chicle, a gum taken from the sapodilla tree and used to make chewing gum, propped up the economy from the 1880s. Much of the gum was tapped in Mexican and Guatemalan forests by Mayan chicleros who had been recruited by labour contractors in British Honduras. A short-lived boom in the mahogany trade occurred around 1900 in response to growing demand for the wood in the United States, but the ruthless exploitation of the forests without any conservation or reforestation depleted resources. On 22 July 1919, a riot erupted in Belize Town, as a mob consisting of hundreds of rioters, many of them demobilised Belizean servicemen, protested racial discrimination and rising prices in the colony. Eventually, a contingent of ex-servicemen loyal to the colonial government subdued the riots, and order was restored. In the 1920s, the Colonial Office supported agitation for an elective council as long as the Governor had reserve powers to allow him to push through any measures he considered essential without the council&#x27;s assent. But the council rejected these provisos, and the issue of restoring elections was postponed. 

Despite the prevailing stagnation of the colony&#x27;s economy and society during most of the century prior to the 1930s, seeds of change were being sown. The mahogany trade remained depressed, and efforts to develop plantation agriculture in several crops, including sugarcane, coffee, cocoa, cotton, bananas and coconuts failed. The introduction of tractors and bulldozers opened up new areas in the west and south in the 1920s, but this development led again to only a temporary revival. At this time, mahogany, cedar and chicle together accounted for 97 percent of forest production and 82 percent of the total value of exports. The economy, which was increasingly oriented toward trade with the United States, remained dependent and underdeveloped. Creoles, who were well-connected with businesses in the United States, challenged the traditional political-economic connection with Britain as trade with the United States intensified. Men such as Robert S. Turton, the Creole chicle buyer for Wrigley&#x27;s, and Henry I. Melhado, whose merchant family dealt in illicit liquor during prohibition, became major political and economic figures. In 1927, Creole merchants and professionals replaced the representatives of British landowners, (except for the manager of the Belize Estate and Produce Company) on the Legislative Council. The participation of this Creole elite in the political process was evidence of emerging social changes that were largely concealed by economic stagnation. These changes accelerated with such force in the 1930s that they ushered in a new era of modern politics.

===Genesis of modern politics, 1931–1954===

The Great Depression shattered the colony&#x27;s economy, and unemployment increased rapidly. The Colonial Report for 1931 stated that &quot;contracts for the purchase of mahogany and chicle, which form the mainstay of the Colony, practically ceased altogether, thereby throwing a large number of the woodcutters and chicle-gatherers out of work&quot;. On top of this economic disaster, the worst hurricane in the country&#x27;s recent history demolished Belize Town on 10 September 1931, killing more than 1,000 people and destroying at least three-quarters of the housing. The British relief response was tardy and inadequate. The British government seized the opportunity to impose tighter control on the colony and endowed the Governor with reserve powers, or the power to enact laws in emergency situations without the consent of the Legislative Council. The Legislative Council resisted but eventually passed a resolution agreeing to give the Governor reserve powers to obtain disaster aid. Meanwhile, people in the town were making shelters out of the wreckage of their houses. The economy continued to decline in 1932 and 1933. The total value of imports and exports in the latter year was little more than one-fourth of what it had been in 1929.

The Belize Estate and Produce Company survived the depression years because of its special connections in British Honduras and London. Since 1875 various members of the Hoare family had been principal directors and maintained a controlling interest in the company. Sir Samuel Hoare, a shareholder and former director, had been a British cabinet member and a friend of Leo Amery, the British secretary of state for the colonies. In 1931, when the company was suffering from the aftereffects of the hurricane and the depression, family member Oliver V.G. Hoare contacted the Colonial Office to discuss the possibility of selling the company to buyers in the United States. The British government rescued the company by granting it an area of virgin mahogany forest and a loan of US$200,000 to erect a sawmill in Belize Town. When the government almost doubled the land tax, the large landowners refused to pay. The government accepted some virtually worthless land in lieu of taxes and in 1935 capitulated completely, reducing the tax to its former rate and annulling the landowners&#x27; arrears by making them retroactive to 1931. But small landowners had paid their taxes, often at a higher rate.

Robert Turton, the Creole millionaire who made his fortune from chicle exports, defeated C.H. Brown, the expatriate manager of the company, in the first elections for some of the Legislative Council seats in 1936. After the elections, the Governor promptly appointed Brown to the council, presumably to maintain the influence of what had for so long been the colony&#x27;s chief business. But Brown&#x27;s defeat by Turton, one of the company&#x27;s chief local business rivals, marked the decline of old British enterprises in relation to the rising Creole entrepreneurs with their United States commercial connections.

Meanwhile, the Belize Estate and Produce Company drove Maya villagers from their homes in San Jose and Yalbac in the northwest and treated workers in mahogany camps almost like slaves. Investigators of labour conditions in the 1930s were appalled to discover that workers received rations of inferior flour and mess pork and tickets to be exchanged at the commissaries, in lieu of cash wages. As a result, workers and their families suffered from malnutrition and were continually in debt to their employers. The law governing labour contracts, the Masters and Servants Act of 1883, made it a criminal offence for a labourer to breach a contract. The offence was punishable by twenty-eight days of imprisonment with hard labour. In 1931 the Governor, Sir John Burdon, rejected proposals to legalise trade unions and to introduce a minimum wage and sickness insurance. The conditions, aggravated by rising unemployment and the disastrous hurricane, were responsible for severe hardship among the poor. The poor responded in 1934 with a series of demonstrations, strikes, petitions and riots that marked the beginning of modern politics and the independence movement.

====Labour disturbances====
Riots, strikes and rebellions had occurred before, during and after the period of slavery, but the events of the 1930s were modern labour disturbances in the sense that they gave rise to organisations with articulate industrial and political goals. A group calling itself the Unemployed Brigade marched through Belize Town on 14 February 1934, to present demands to the Governor and started a broad movement. Poor people, in desperation, turned to the Governor, who responded by creating a little relief work—stone-breaking for US$0.10 a day. The Governor also offered a daily ration of two kilograms of cooked rice at the prison gates. The leaders of the Unemployed Brigade gave up hope of further action and resigned.

The unemployed, demanding a cash dole, turned to Antonio Soberanis Gómez (1897–1975), who denounced the Unemployed Brigade&#x27;s leaders as cowards. He said that he would continue fighting for the cause and that he was not afraid to die. In his most famous quote, he said, &quot;I&#x27;d rather be a dead hero than a living coward&quot;. At a meeting on 16 March 1934, he took over the movement, which became the Labourers and Unemployed Association (LUA). For the next few weeks, Soberanis and his colleagues in the LUA attacked the Governor and his officials, the rich merchants, and the Belize Estate and Produce Company at biweekly meetings attended by 600 to 800 people. The workers demanded relief and a minimum wage. They couched their demands in broad moral and political terms that began to define and develop a new nationalistic and democratic political culture.

Soberanis was jailed under a new sedition law in 1935. Still, the labour agitation achieved a great deal. Of most immediate importance was the creation of relief work by a Governor who saw it as a way to avoid civil disturbances. Workers built more than 300 kilometres of roads. The Governor also pressed for a semi-representative government. But when the new constitution was passed in April 1935, it included the restrictive franchise demanded by the appointed majority of the Legislative Council, which had no interest in furthering democracy. High voter-eligibility standards for property and income limited the electorate to the wealthiest 2 percent of the population. Poor people, therefore, could not vote; they could only support members of the Creole middle classes that opposed big-business candidates. The Citizens&#x27; Political Party and the LUA endorsed Robert Turton and Arthur Balderamos, a Creole lawyer, who formed the chief opposition in the new council of 1936. Working-class agitation continued, and in 1939 all six seats on the Belize Town Board (the voting requirements allowed for a more representative electorate) went to middle-class Creoles who appeared more sympathetic to labour.

The greatest achievements of the agitation of the 1930s were the labour reforms passed between 1941 and 1943. Trade unions were legalised in 1941, but the laws did not require employers to recognise these unions. Furthermore, the penal clauses of the old Masters and Servants Act rendered the new rights ineffectual. Employers among the unofficial members at the Legislative Council defeated a bill to repeal these penal clauses in August 1941, but the Employers and Workers Bill passed on 27 April 1943, finally removed breach-of-labour-contract from the criminal code and enabled British Honduras&#x27;s infant trade unions to pursue the struggle for improving labour conditions. The General Workers&#x27; Union (GWU), registered in 1943, quickly expanded into a nationwide organisation and provided crucial support for the nationalist movement that took off with the formation of the People&#x27;s United Party (PUP) in 1950. The 1930s were therefore the crucible of modern Belizean politics. It was a decade during which the old phenomena of exploitative labour conditions and authoritarian colonial and industrial relations began to give way to new labour and political processes and institutions.

The same period saw an expansion in voter eligibility. Between 1939 and 1954, less than 2 percent of the population elected six members in the Legislative Council of thirteen members. In 1945 only 822 voters were registered in a population of over 63,000. The proportion of voters increased slightly in 1945, partly because the minimum age for women voters was reduced from thirty to twenty-one years. The devaluation of the British Honduras dollar in 1949 effectively reduced the property and income voter-eligibility standards. Finally, in 1954 British Honduras achieved suffrage for all literate adults as a result of the emerging independence movement. This development was a prelude to the process of constitutional decolonisation.

====Independence movement====

The origins of the independence movement also lay in the 1930s and 1940s. Three groups played important roles in the colony&#x27;s politics during this period. One group consisted of working-class individuals and emphasised labour issues. This group originated with Soberanis&#x27;s LUA between 1934 and 1937 and continued through the GWU. The second group, a radical nationalist movement, emerged during World War II. Its leaders came from the LUA and the local branch of Marcus Garvey&#x27;s Universal Negro Improvement Association. The group called itself variously the British Honduras Independent Labour Party, the People&#x27;s Republican Party and the People&#x27;s National Committee. The third group consisted of people such as the Christian Social Action Group (CSAG) who engaged in electoral politics within the narrow limits defined by the constitution and whose goals included a &quot;Natives First&quot; campaign and an extension of the franchise to elect a more representative government.

In 1947 a group of graduates of the elite Catholic Saint John&#x27;s College formed the CSAG and won control of the Belize City Council. One member of this group, George Cadle Price, topped the polls in the 1947 election when he opposed immigration schemes and import controls and rode a wave of feeling against a British proposal for a federation of its colonies in the Caribbean. Price was an eclectic and pragmatic politician whose ideological position was often obscured under a cloak of religious values and quotations. He remained the predominant politician in the country from the early 1950s until his retirement in 1996. The CSAG also started a newspaper, the &quot;Belize Billboard&quot; edited by Philip Goldson and Leigh Richardson.

The event that precipitated Price&#x27;s political career and the formation of the PUP, was the devaluation of the British Honduras dollar on 31 December 1949. In September 1949, the British government devalued the British pound sterling. In spite of repeated denials by the Governor that the British Honduras dollar would be devalued to maintain the old exchange rate with the British pound, devaluation was nevertheless effected by the Governor, using his reserve powers in defiance of the Legislative Council. The Governor&#x27;s action angered the nationalists because it reflected the limits of the legislature and revealed the extent of the colonial administration&#x27;s power. The devaluation enraged labour because it protected the interests of the big transnationals, such as the Belize Estate and Produce Company, whose trade in British pounds would have suffered without devaluation while it subjected British Honduras&#x27;s working class, already experiencing widespread unemployment and poverty, to higher prices for goods—especially food—imported from the United States. Devaluation thus united labour, nationalists and the Creole middle classes in opposition to the colonial administration. On the night that the Governor declared the devaluation, the People&#x27;s Committee was formed and the nascent independence movement suddenly matured.

Before the end of January 1950, the GWU and the People&#x27;s Committee were holding joint public meetings and discussing issues such as devaluation, labour legislation, the proposed West Indies Federation, and constitutional reform. The GWU was the only mass organisation of working people, so the early success of the independence movement would have been impossible without the support of this union. In fact, the GWU president, Clifford Betson was one of the original members of the People&#x27;s Committee. On 28 April 1950, the middle-class members of the People&#x27;s Committee (formerly members of the CSAG) took over the leadership of the union and gave Betson the dubious honorific title of &quot;patriarch of the union&quot;. On 29 September 1950, the People&#x27;s Committee was dissolved and the People&#x27;s United Party (PUP) formed in its place.

====Rise of the PUP====

Between 1950 and 1954, the People&#x27;s United Party consolidated its organisation, established its popular base, and articulated its primary demands. &quot;Belize Billboard&quot; editors Philip Goldson and Leigh Richardson were prominent members of the PUP and gave the party their full support through anti-colonial editorials. A year later, George Price, the secretary of the PUP, became vice-president of the GWU. The political leaders took control of the union to use its strength, and in turn the union movement declined as it became increasingly dependent upon politicians in the 1950s.

The PUP concentrated on agitating for constitutional reforms, including universal adult suffrage without a literacy test, an all- elected Legislative Council, an Executive Council chosen by the leader of the majority party in the legislature, the introduction of a ministerial system, and the abolition of the Governor&#x27;s reserve powers. In short, PUP pushed for representative and responsible government. The colonial administration, alarmed by the growing support for the PUP, retaliated by attacking two of the party&#x27;s chief public platforms. In July 1951, the Governor dissolved the Belize City Council on the pretext that it had shown disloyalty by refusing to display a picture of King George VI. Then, in October, the Governor charged &quot;Belize Billboard&quot; publishers and owners, including Richardson and Goldson, with sedition. The Governor jailed them for twelve months with hard labour. Soon after, PUP leader John Smith resigned because the party would not agree to fly the British flag at public meetings. The removal of three of four chief leaders was a blow to the party, but the events left Price in a powerful position. In 1952 he comfortably topped the polls in Belize City Council elections. Within just two years, despite persecution and division, the PUP had become a powerful political force, and George Price had clearly become the party&#x27;s leader.

The colonial administration and the National Party, which consisted of loyalist members of the Legislative Council, portrayed the PUP as pro-Guatemalan and even communist. The leaders of the PUP, however, perceived British Honduras as belonging to neither Britain nor Guatemala. The Governor and the National Party failed in their attempts to discredit the PUP on the issue of its contacts with Guatemala, which was then ruled by the democratic, reformist government of president Jacobo Arbenz. When voters went to the polls on 28 April 1954, in the first election under universal literate adult suffrage, the main issue was clearly colonialism—a vote for the PUP was a vote in favour of self-government. Almost 70 percent of the electorate voted. The PUP gained 66.3 percent of the vote and won eight of the nine elected seats in the new Legislative Assembly. Further constitutional reform was unequivocally on the agenda.

===Decolonisation and the border dispute with Guatemala===

British Honduras faced two obstacles to independence: British reluctance until the early 1960s to allow citizens to govern themselves, and Guatemala&#x27;s complete intransigence over its long-standing claim to the entire territory. By 1961, the United Kingdom was willing to let the colony become independent and from 1964 controlled only defence, foreign affairs, internal security, and the terms and conditions of the public service. On 1 June 1973, the colony&#x27;s name was changed to Belize in anticipation of independence. The stalemate in the protracted negotiations between the UK and Guatemala over the future status of Belize led Belizeans after 1975 to seek the international community&#x27;s assistance in resolving issues associated with independence. Even after Belize became independent in 1981, however, the territorial dispute remained unsettled.

The territorial dispute&#x27;s origins lay in the 18th-century treaties in which Great Britain acceded to Spain&#x27;s assertion of sovereignty while British settlers continued to occupy the sparsely settled and ill-defined area. The 1786 Convention of London, which affirmed Spanish sovereignty was never renegotiated, but Spain never attempted to reclaim the area after 1798.

At the centre of Guatemala&#x27;s oldest claim was the 1859 treaty between the United Kingdom and Guatemala. From Britain&#x27;s viewpoint, this treaty merely settled the boundaries of an area already under British dominion. Guatemala had an alternative view that this agreement stated that Guatemala would give up its territorial claims only under certain conditions, including the construction of a road from Guatemala to the Caribbean coast. The UK never built the road, and Guatemala said it would repudiate the treaty in 1884 but never followed up on the threat.

The dispute appeared to have been forgotten until the 1930s when the government of General Jorge Ubico claimed that the treaty was invalid because the road had not been constructed. Britain argued that because neither the short-lived Central American Federation (1821–1839) nor Guatemala had ever exercised any authority in the area or even protested the British presence in the 19th century, British Honduras was clearly under British sovereignty. In its constitution of 1945, however, Guatemala stated that British Honduras was the twenty-third department of Guatemala.
In February 1948, Guatemala threatened to invade and forcibly annex the territory, and the British responded by deploying two companies from 2nd Battalion Gloucestershire Regiment. Since 1954 a succession of military and right-wing governments in Guatemala frequently whipped up nationalist sentiment, with incursions in 1957 and 1958.
Negotiations between Britain and Guatemala began again in 1961, but the elected representatives of British Honduras had no voice in these talks. As a result, in 1965 the United States President Lyndon Johnson agreed to mediate and proposed a draft treaty that gave Guatemala control over the newly independent country in areas including internal security, defence and external affairs. All parties in British Honduras, however, denounced the proposals.

A series of meetings, begun in 1969, ended abruptly in 1972 when tensions flared over a possible Guatemalan invasion. Talks resumed in 1973, but broke off again in 1975 when tensions flared once more. Between 1975 and 1981, the Belizean and British governments, frustrated at dealing with the military-dominated regimes in Guatemala, began to state their case for self-determination at international forums such as a meeting of the heads of Commonwealth of Nations governments in Jamaica, the conference of ministers of the Nonaligned Movement in Peru, and at meetings of the United Nations (UN).

The support of the Nonaligned Movement proved crucial and assured success at the UN. Latin American governments initially supported Guatemala, however Cuba, Mexico, Panama and Nicaragua later declared unequivocal support for an independent Belize. Finally, in November 1980, with Guatemala completely isolated, the UN passed a resolution that demanded the independence of Belize, with all its territory intact, before the next session of the UN in 1981.

A last attempt was made to reach an agreement with Guatemala prior to the independence of Belize and a proposal, called the Heads of Agreement, was initialled on 11 March 1981. However, the Guatemalan government refused to ratify the agreement and withdrew from the negotiations, and the opposition in Belize engaged in violent demonstrations against it. With the prospect of independence celebrations in the offing, the opposition&#x27;s morale fell and independence came to Belize on 21 September 1981, without an agreement with Guatemala.

==Government==

Before 1884 the colonial administration of British Honduras was rather haphazard. In the early days, the colonists governed themselves under a public meeting system, similar to the town meeting system used in New England. A set of regulations called &quot;Burnaby&#x27;s Code&quot; was adopted in 1765, which continued in force until 1840, when an executive council was created. Also in 1840, the colony formally became known as British Honduras, although it was also referred to as &quot;the Belize&quot;. In 1853 the public meeting system was abandoned in favour of a legislative assembly, part of which was elected by a restricted franchise. The assembly was presided over by the British superintendent, an office created in 1784.

From 1749 until 1884, British Honduras was governed as a dependency of the British colony of Jamaica. Upon its designation as a Crown colony in 1871, a Lieutenant Governor under the Governor of Jamaica replaced the superintendent, and a nominated legislative council replaced the legislative assembly. When the colony was finally severed from the administration of Jamaica in 1884, it gained its own Governor.

In 1935 legislative franchise was reintroduced with a lower income qualification. Universal adult franchise was adopted in 1954, and a majority of seats in the legislature were made elective. A ministerial system was introduced in 1961, and the colony achieved self-government status in 1964.

==Economy==
Forestry dominated the economy of British Honduras. Initially, the focus was upon logwood, which was used in dye manufacture. Falling prices for logwood in the 1770s led to a shift toward logging mahogany, which would dominate the economy until the mid-20th century. As the logging of mahogany was far more labour-intensive, this also led to a significant increase of the importation of African slaves to the colony, mainly from Britain&#x27;s Caribbean colonies. Due largely to extremely harsh working conditions, the colony experienced four slave revolts, the first in 1765 and the last in 1820. Slavery was finally abolished in 1838. Exports of mahogany continued as an economic mainstay, as commercial agriculture remained unprofitable due to unfavourable colonial tax policies and trade restrictions. Colonial officials provided incentives during the 1860s that resulted in a large influx of Americans from the Southern United States, especially Louisiana, during and after the American Civil War. The Confederate settlements in British Honduras introduced large-scale sugar production to the colony and proved that it could be profitable where others had previously failed.

The lack of diversification in the economy left the colony very susceptible to swings in the mahogany market. The Great Depression of the 1930s and an especially destructive hurricane in 1931, further depressed the economy and already low living conditions. From 1914 on, the forestry industry was in steady decline, except for a brief revival during World War II (1939–1945). In the 1950s agriculture finally became a dominant part of economy, and in the 1970s fishing became significant. Land reform after World War II aided this expansion of the economy.

==Demographics==
By the time of the colony&#x27;s 1790 census, three-quarters of the population of British Honduras were Creole people&quot;.
They were the ancestors of the original Belizean-Creole population, who were, and still are, the biological offspring of African men enslaved African women. The original Belizean-Creole people consisted mainly of west African slaves descendants .

The abolition of the slave trade in 1807, high death rates and low birth rates substantially reduced the ethnic African portion of the population. The white portion of the population left back to Europe and imported other whites to live in Belize The largest portion of the population the creole people, now about 45% of modern Belize. The Mayans are still present in Belize and comprise around 11% of the population.

The population of the colony was always fairly small. In 1790 it was around 4,000. In 1856 it was estimated to be 20,000. By 1931 this figure grew to just over 50,000, and in 1946 to just under 60,000. However, by 1970 the population doubled to just under 120,000. On the eve of independence in 1980, the population stood at over 145,000.

<doc id="172714" wikidata="Q2106693" url="?curid=172714" title="Baozhong tea">
<text>Baozhong tea, sometimes romanized as pouchong, is a lightly oxidized tea, twist shape, with floral notes, and usually not roasted, somewhere between green tea and what is usually considered oolong tea, though often classified with the latter due to its lack of the sharper green tea flavours. It is produced mainly in Fujian, China and in Pinglin District, New Taipei, Taiwan.

Its name in Chinese, literally &quot;the wrapped kind&quot;, refers to a practice of wrapping the leaves in paper during the drying process that has largely been discontinued due to advancement in tea processing. At its best, baozhong gives off a floral and melon fragrance and has a rich, mild taste. The picking season of this famous Taiwan &quot;spring tea&quot; () usually begins around the end of March.

Before 1873, oolong tea was widely sold in mainland China and Taiwan, but after an economic slump, some tea companies stopped selling oolong tea because of decreasing demand. At this time, tea companies moved production from Taiwan to Fuzhou and began producing baozhong tea. Baozhong tea is referred to as &quot;flower tea&quot; because of its fragrant smell.

==Health benefits==
Together with green tea, oolong tea, and black tea, baozhong tea has been shown to have antioxidant activity and antimutagenic properties. Tea catechins are important antioxidants and one study found baozhong tea to have over three times the amount of these compounds relative to black tea, although it was found to have less than green or oolong teas.

==Baozhong tea in Taiwan==
Farmers from Taiwan imported trees and growing techniques from Fujian during the nineteenth century. The name of baozhong tea means “wrapped” tea and refers to the former paper package style. The most popular kinds of baozhong tea are from the Nankang and Wenshan regions. It has been produced since about 1885, but today very little is grown. Wenshan Baozhong Tea is also one of the ten most popular teas in Taiwan.

==Characteristics==
The appearance of baozhong tea is similar to a rope and is curled up. It has a deep green color with tiny grayish white spots. The oxidation is between 8 and 12%. It has a delicate fragrance similar to fresh flowers. The taste is not harsh and its sweet flavor has a moisturizing effect.

<doc id="172716" wikidata="Q736050" url="?curid=172716" title="Caltrop">
<text>A caltrop (also known as caltrap, galtrop, cheval trap, galthrap, galtrap, calthrop, jackrock or crow&#x27;s foot) is an area denial weapon made up of usually four, but possibly more, sharp nails or spines arranged in such a manner that one of them always points upward from a stable base (for example, a tetrahedron). Historically, caltrops were part of defences that served to slow the advance of troops, especially horses, chariots, and war elephants, and were particularly effective against the soft feet of camels. In modern times, caltrops are effective when used against wheeled vehicles with pneumatic tires.

==Name==
The modern name &quot;caltrop&quot; is derived from the Old English (heel-trap), such as in the French usage (shoe-trap). The Latin word originally referred to this and provides part of the modern scientific name of a plant commonly called the caltrop, &quot;Tribulus terrestris&quot;, whose spiked seed cases resemble caltrops and can injure feet and puncture bicycle tires. This plant can also be compared to &quot;Centaurea calcitrapa&quot;, which is also sometimes referred to as the &quot;caltrop&quot;. &quot;Trapa natans&quot;, a water plant with similarly shaped spiked seeds and edible fruit, is called the &quot;water caltrop&quot;.

==History==

The caltrop was called by the ancient Romans, or sometimes , the latter meaning &quot;jagged iron&quot; (literally &quot;iron spiny snail-shell&quot;). The former term derives from the ancient Greek word meaning three spikes.

The late Roman writer Vegetius, referring in his work &quot;De re militari&quot; to scythed chariots, wrote:

Another example of the use of caltrops was found in Jamestown, Virginia, in the United States:

The Japanese version of the caltrop is called . Makibishi were sharp spiked objects that were used in feudal Japan to slow pursuers and also were used in the defence of samurai fortifications. Iron makibishi were called , while the makibishi made from the dried seed pod of the water caltrop, or water chestnut (genus &quot;Trapa&quot;), formed a natural type of makibashi called . Both types of makibishi could penetrate the thin soles of shoes, such as the sandals, which were commonly worn in feudal Japan.

==Modern uses==
===World War I===
During service in World War I, Australian Light Horse troops collected caltrops as keepsakes. These caltrops were either made by welding two pieces of wire together to form a four-pointed star or pouring molten steel into a mould to form a solid, seven-pointed star. The purpose of these devices was to disable horses. They were exchanged with French troops for bullets. The Australian Light Horse troops referred to them as &quot;Horse Chestnuts&quot;.

===World War II===
Caltrops were used extensively and effectively during World War II. The modifications and variants produced by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) of the United States are still in use today within special forces and law enforcement bodies.

The Germans dropped &quot;crow&#x27;s feet&quot; (). These were made from two segments of sheet metal welded together into a tetrapod with four barbed points and then painted in camouflage colours. They came in two sizes with a side length of either . They were dropped from aircraft in containers the same size as bombs and were dispersed by a small explosive charge.

===Tire deflation device===
Inventors patented caltrop-like devices to deflate vehicle tires in a manner useful to law enforcement agencies or the military. They are currently used by the military and police.

===Labour disputes===
Caltrops have been used at times during labour strikes and other disputes. Such devices were used by some to destroy the tires of management and replacement workers.

Caltrops, referred to as &quot;jack rocks&quot; in news articles, were used during the Caterpillar strike in 1995, puncturing tires on vehicles crossing the picket line in Peoria, Illinois. Because of their small size and the difficulty proving their source, both the company and the United Auto Workers blamed each other. Collateral damage included a school bus and a walking mail carrier. In Illinois, the state legislature passed a law making the possession of such devices a misdemeanor.

=== Via drones ===
During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ukraine has used drones to drop caltrops on key roads to disrupt wheeled vehicles carrying Russian military materiel, and make them easier to target with loitering munitions.

==Symbol==

A caltrop has a variety of symbolic uses and is commonly found as a charge in heraldry. For instance, the Finnish noble family Fotangel (Swedish for &#x27;caltrop&#x27;) had arms &quot;gules&quot;, three caltrops &quot;argent&quot;.

It has also been adopted by military units: the caltrop is the symbol of the US Army&#x27;s III Corps, which is based at Fort Cavazos, Texas. III Corps traces its lineage to the days of horse cavalry, which used the caltrop as a defensive area denial weapon.

The caltrop is also the symbol of the United States Marine Corps&#x27; 3rd Division, formed on 16 September 1942.

==Similar devices==

Punji sticks perform a similar role to caltrops. These are sharpened sticks placed vertically in the ground. Their use in modern times targets the body and limbs of a falling victim by means of a pit or tripwire.

During the Second World War, large caltrop-shaped objects made from reinforced concrete were used as anti-tank devices, although it seems that these were rare. Much more common were concrete devices called dragon&#x27;s teeth, which were designed to wedge into tank treads. Large ones weighing over are still used defensively to deny access to wheeled vehicles, especially in camp areas. As dragon&#x27;s teeth are immobile, the analogy with the caltrop is inexact. Another caltrop-like defence during World War II was the massive steel, freestanding Czech hedgehog; the works were designed as anti-tank obstacles and could also damage landing craft and warships that came too close to shore. These were used by the Germans to defend beaches in Normandy and other coastal areas. Czech hedgehogs are heavily featured and plainly visible in the 1998 Steven Spielberg-directed American epic war film &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, throughout the scenes early in the film depicting the June6, 1944 Omaha Beach assault (part of the Normandy landings during World War II).

Tetrapods are concrete blocks shaped like caltrops, which interlock when piled up. They are used as riprap in the construction of breakwaters and other sea defences, as they have been found to let the water pass through them and interrupt natural processes less than some other defenses.

<text>Fortune (stylized in all caps) is an American global business magazine headquartered in New York City. It is published by Fortune Media Group Holdings, a global business media company. The publication was founded by Henry Luce in 1929. The magazine competes with &quot;Forbes&quot; and &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; in the national business magazine category and distinguishes itself with long, in-depth feature articles.

The magazine regularly publishes ranked lists including ranking companies by revenue such as in the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 that it has published annually since 1955, and in the &quot;Fortune&quot; Global 500. The magazine is also known for its annual &quot;Fortune Investor&#x27;s Guide&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Fortune&quot; was founded by &quot;Time&quot; magazine co-founder Henry Luce in 1929, who declared it as &quot;the Ideal Super-Class Magazine&quot;, a &quot;distinguished and de luxe&quot; publication &quot;vividly portraying, interpreting and recording the Industrial Civilization&quot;. Briton Hadden, Luce&#x27;s business partner, was not enthusiastic about the idea – which Luce originally thought to title &quot;Power&quot; – but Luce went forward with it after Hadden&#x27;s sudden death on February 27, 1929.

In late October 1929, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 occurred, marking the onset of the Great Depression. In a memo to the Time Inc. board in November 1929, Luce wrote: &quot;We will not be over-optimistic. We will recognize that this business slump may last as long as an entire year.&quot; The publication made its official debut in February 1930. Its editor was Luce, managing editor Parker Lloyd-Smith, and art director Thomas Maitland Cleland.
Single copies of the first issue cost US$1 (). An urban legend says that Cleland mocked up the cover of the first issue with the $1 price because no one had yet decided how much to charge; the magazine was printed before anyone realized it, and when people saw it for sale, they thought that the magazine must really have worthwhile content. In fact, there were 30,000 subscribers who had already signed up to receive that initial 184-page issue. By 1937, the number of subscribers had grown to 460,000, and the magazine had turned half million dollars in annual profit.

At a time when business publications were little more than numbers and statistics printed in black and white, &quot;Fortune&quot; was an oversized 11&quot; × 14&quot;, using creamy heavy paper, and art on a cover printed by a special process. &quot;Fortune&quot; was also noted for its photography, featuring the work of Margaret Bourke-White, Ansel Adams, and others. Walker Evans served as its photography editor from 1945 to 1965.

During the Great Depression, the magazine developed a reputation for its social conscience, for Walker Evans and Margaret Bourke-White&#x27;s color photographs, and for a team of writers including James Agee, Archibald MacLeish, John Kenneth Galbraith, and Alfred Kazin, hired specifically for their writing abilities. The magazine became an important leg of Luce&#x27;s media empire; after the successful launch of &quot;Time&quot; in 1923 and &quot;Fortune&quot; in 1930, Luce went on to launch &quot;Life&quot; in 1936 and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in 1954.

From its launch in 1930 to 1978, &quot;Fortune&quot; was published monthly. In January 1978, it began publishing biweekly. In October 2009, citing declining advertising revenue and circulation, &quot;Fortune&quot; began publishing every three weeks. As of 2018, &quot;Fortune&quot; is published 14 times a year.

Marshall Loeb was named managing editor in 1986. During his tenure at &quot;Fortune&quot;, Loeb was credited with expanding the traditional focus on business and the economy with added graphs, charts, and tables, as well as the addition of articles on topics such as executive life and social issues connected to the world of business, including the effectiveness of public schools and on homelessness.

During the years when Time Warner owned Time Inc., &quot;Fortune&quot; articles (as well as those from &quot;Money&quot; magazine) were hosted at CNNMoney.com.

In June 2014, after Time Inc. spun off from its corporate parent, &quot;Fortune&quot; launched its own website at Fortune.com.

On November 26, 2017, it was announced that Meredith Corporation would acquire Time Inc. in a $2.8 billion deal. The acquisition was completed on January 31, 2018.

On November 9, 2018, it was announced that Meredith Corporation was selling &quot;Fortune&quot; to Thai billionaire Chatchaval Jiaravanon for $150 million. Jiaravanon is affiliated with the Thailand-based conglomerate Charoen Pokphand Group, which has holdings in agriculture, telecommunications, retail, pharmaceutical, and finance.

<doc id="172718" wikidata="Q1027095" url="?curid=172718" title="Call Level Interface">
<text>The Call Level Interface (CLI or SQL/CLI) is an application programming interface (API) and software standard to embed Structured Query Language (SQL) code in a host program as defined in a joint standard by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The Call Level Interface defines how a program should send SQL queries to the database management system (DBMS) and how the returned recordsets should be handled by the application in a consistent way. Developed in the early 1990s, the API was defined only for the programming languages C and COBOL.

The interface is part of what The Open Group, publishes in a part of the X/Open Portability Guide, termed the Common Application Environment, which is intended to be a wide standard for programming open applications, i.e., applications from different programming teams and different vendors that can interoperate efficiently. SQL/CLI provides an international standard implementation-independent CLI to access SQL databases. Client–server tools can easily access databases through dynamic-link libraries (DLL). It supports and encourages a rich set of client–server tools.

The most widespread use of the CLI standard is the basis of the Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) specification, which is widely used to allow applications to transparently access database systems from different vendors. ODBC incorporates features from both the ISO and X/Open standards. Examples of languages that support Call Level Interface are ANSI C, C#, Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET), Java, Pascal, and Fortran.

==History==

The work with the Call Level Interface began in a subcommittee of the US-based SQL Access Group (SAG) In 1992, it was initially published and marketed as Microsoft&#x27;s ODBC API. The CLI specification was submitted as to the ISO and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards committees in 1993. The standard has the book number and the internal document number is C451.

ISO SQL/CLI is an addendum to 1992 SQL standard (SQL-92). It was completed as ISO standard ISO/IEC 9075-3:1995 Information technology—Database languages—SQL—Part 3: Call-Level Interface (SQL/CLI).

In the fourth quarter of 1994, control over the standard was transferred to the X/Open Company, which significantly expanded and updated it. The X/Open CLI interface is a superset of the ISO SQL CLI.

<text>Dangriga, formerly known as Stann Creek Town, is a town in southern Belize, located on the Caribbean coast at the mouth of the North Stann Creek River. It is the capital of Belize&#x27;s Stann Creek District. Dangriga is served by the Dangriga Airport. Commonly known as the &quot;culture capital of Belize&quot; due to its influence on punta music and other forms of Garifuna culture, Dangriga is the largest settlement in southern Belize.

==History==
Dangriga, declared a town 15 February 1895, was settled before 1832 by Garinagu (Black Caribs, as they were known to the British) from Honduras. For years, it was the second largest population centre in the country behind Belize City, but in recent years has been surpassed by San Ignacio, Belmopan and Orange Walk Town. Since the early 1980s, Garífuna culture has undergone a revival, as part of which the town&#x27;s name of Dangriga, a Garífuna word meaning &quot;standing waters&quot;, became more widely used (but was initially adopted around 1975).

==Demographics==
The population is mostly a mixture of Garinagu, Kriols and Mestizos. According to the Statistical Institute of Belize, Dangriga&#x27;s population in 2010 was 8,767 – 4,302 males and 4,465 females.

==Culture==
Dangriga is home to the Garifuna, a cultural and ethnic group, descendants of shipwrecked slaves and native Caribs. The Garifuna have adopted the Carib language but kept their African musical and religious traditions, while holding a central place in the history of the Catholic church and Catholic education in Belize. Dangriga is also where the Caribbean music, Punta Rock, originated and where some of Belize&#x27;s folk bands can be found.

In November, each year, there is a week-long festivity leading up to Garifuna Settlement Day, attended by Garifuna people from around the region. It includes a torchlit parade and wreath-laying ceremony at the monument of the patriot and social activist Thomas Vincent Ramos, selection of Miss Garifuna, parades and special church services, and The T.V. Ramos Classic Bike Race.

The 19 November is Garifuna Settlement Day.

==Attractions==
*Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary, located southwest of Dangriga.
*Mayflower Archeological Reserve, consisting of three ruins, two waterfalls and a view of Hopkins village as well as of the Caribbean Sea.
*Dangriga is also a mainland access point to popular cayes in Southern Belize, including Tobacco Caye and Royal Belize.

==Healthcare==
The city is served by Southern Regional Hospital.

==Notable residents==
*Arlie Petters, mathematician and astrophysicist
*Pen Cayetano, artist and musician residing in Germany. Originator of Punta Rock.
*Maxime Faget, designer of the Mercury capsule, and contributed to the later Gemini and Apollo spacecraft as well as the Space Shuttle.
*T. V. Ramos, Garifuna civil rights activist from Puerto Cortez, Honduras.
* Osmond P. Martin, first native Belizean Catholic bishop.
* Rakeem Nuñez-Roches, American football player for the New York Giants

<doc id="172732" wikidata="Q132501" url="?curid=172732" title="Glycerol">
<text>Glycerol () is a simple triol compound. It is a colorless, odorless, viscous liquid that is sweet-tasting and non-toxic. The glycerol backbone is found in lipids known as glycerides. It is also widely used as a sweetener in the food industry and as a humectant in pharmaceutical formulations. Because of its three hydroxyl groups, glycerol is miscible with water and is hygroscopic in nature.

Modern use of the word glycerine (alternatively spelled glycerin) refers to commercial preparations of less than 100% purity, typically 95% glycerol. 

==Structure==
Although achiral, glycerol is prochiral with respect to reactions of one of the two primary alcohols. Thus, in substituted derivatives, the stereospecific numbering labels the molecule with a &quot;sn&quot;- prefix before the stem name of the molecule.

==Production==
===Natural sources===
Glycerol is generally obtained from plant and animal sources where it occurs in triglycerides, esters of glycerol with long-chain carboxylic acids. The hydrolysis, saponification, or transesterification of these triglycerides produces glycerol as well as the fatty acid derivative:


Triglycerides can be saponified with sodium hydroxide to give glycerol and fatty sodium salt or soap.

Typical plant sources include soybeans or palm. Animal-derived tallow is another source. From 2000 to 2004, approximately 950,000 tons per year were produced in the United States and Europe; 350,000 tons of glycerol were produced in the U.S. alone. Since around 2010, there is a large surplus of glycerol as a byproduct of biofuel, enforced for example by EU directive 2003/30/EC that required 5.75% of petroleum fuels to be replaced with biofuel sources across all member states.
Crude glycerol produced from triglycerides is of variable quality, with a low selling price of as low as US$0.02–0.05 per kilogram already in 2011. It can be purified in a rather expensive process by treatment with activated carbon to remove organic impurities, alkali to remove unreacted glycerol esters, and ion exchange to remove salts. High purity glycerol (greater than 99.5%) is obtained by multi-step distillation; a vacuum chamber is necessary due to its high boiling point (290 °C).

Consequently, glycerol recycling is more of a challenge than its production, for instance by conversion to glycerol carbonate or to synthetic precursors, such as acrolein and epichlorohydrin.

===Synthetic glycerol===
Although usually not economical anymore, glycerol can be synthesized by various routes. During World War II, synthetic glycerol processes became a national defense priority because it is a precursor to nitroglycerine. Epichlorohydrin is the most important precursor. Chlorination of propylene gives allyl chloride, which is oxidized with hypochlorite to dichlorohydrin, which reacts with a strong base to give epichlorohydrin. Epichlorohydrin can be hydrolyzed to glycerol. Chlorine-free processes from propylene include the synthesis of glycerol from acrolein and propylene oxide.

==Applications==
===Food industry===
In food and beverages, glycerol serves as a humectant, solvent, and sweetener, and may help preserve foods. It is also used as filler in commercially prepared low-fat foods (e.g., cookies), and as a thickening agent in liqueurs. Glycerol and water are used to preserve certain types of plant leaves. As a sugar substitute, it has approximately 27 kilocalories per teaspoon (sugar has 20) and is 60% as sweet as sucrose. It does not feed the bacteria that form a dental plaque and cause dental cavities. As a food additive, glycerol is labeled as E number E422. It is added to icing (frosting) to prevent it from setting too hard.

As used in foods, glycerol is categorized by the U.S. Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics as a carbohydrate. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) carbohydrate designation includes all caloric macronutrients excluding protein and fat. Glycerol has a caloric density similar to table sugar, but a lower glycemic index and different metabolic pathway within the body.

It is also recommended as an additive when polyol sweeteners such as erythritol and xylitol are used, as its heating effect in the mouth will counteract these sweeteners&#x27; cooling effect.

===Medical===

Glycerol is used in medical, pharmaceutical and personal care preparations, often as a means of improving smoothness, providing lubrication, and as a humectant.

Ichthyosis and xerosis have been relieved by the topical use of glycerin. It is found in allergen immunotherapies, cough syrups, elixirs and expectorants, toothpaste, mouthwashes, skin care products, shaving cream, hair care products, soaps, and water-based personal lubricants. In solid dosage forms like tablets, glycerol is used as a tablet holding agent. For human consumption, glycerol is classified by the FDA among the sugar alcohols as a caloric macronutrient. Glycerol is also used in blood banking to preserve red blood cells prior to freezing.

Taken rectally, glycerol functions as a laxative by irritating the anal mucosa and inducing a hyperosmotic effect, expanding the colon by drawing water into it to induce peristalsis resulting in evacuation. It may be administered undiluted either as a suppository or as a small-volume (2–10 ml) enema. Alternatively, it may be administered in a dilute solution, such as 5%, as a high-volume enema.

Taken orally (often mixed with fruit juice to reduce its sweet taste), glycerol can cause a rapid, temporary decrease in the internal pressure of the eye. This can be useful for the initial emergency treatment of severely elevated eye pressure.

In 2017, researchers showed that the probiotic &quot;Limosilactobacillus reuteri&quot; bacteria can be supplemented with glycerol to enhance its production of antimicrobial substances in the human gut. This was confirmed to be as effective as the antibiotic vancomycin at inhibiting &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infection without having a significant effect on the overall microbial composition of the gut.

Glycerol has also been incorporated as a component of bio-ink formulations in the field of bioprinting. The glycerol content acts to add viscosity to the bio-ink without adding large protein, saccharide, or glycoprotein molecules.

===Botanical extracts===
When utilized in &quot;tincture&quot; method extractions, specifically as a 10% solution, glycerol prevents tannins from precipitating in ethanol extracts of plants (tinctures). It is also used as an &quot;alcohol-free&quot; alternative to ethanol as a solvent in preparing herbal extractions. It is less extractive when utilized in a standard tincture methodology. Alcohol-based tinctures can also have the alcohol removed and replaced with glycerol for its preserving properties. Such products are not &quot;alcohol-free&quot; in a scientific or FDA regulatory sense, as glycerol contains three hydroxyl groups. Fluid extract manufacturers often extract herbs in hot water before adding glycerol to make glycerites.

When used as a primary &quot;true&quot; alcohol-free botanical extraction solvent in non-tincture based methodologies, glycerol has been shown to possess a high degree of extractive versatility for botanicals including removal of numerous constituents and complex compounds, with an extractive power that can rival that of alcohol and water–alcohol solutions. That glycerol possesses such high extractive power assumes it is utilized with dynamic (critical) methodologies as opposed to standard passive &quot;tincturing&quot; methodologies that are better suited to alcohol. Glycerol does not denature or render a botanical&#x27;s constituents inert as alcohols (ethanol, methanol, and so on) do. Glycerol is a stable preserving agent for botanical extracts that, when utilized in proper concentrations in an extraction solvent base, does not allow inverting or reduction-oxidation of a finished extract&#x27;s constituents, even over several years. Both glycerol and ethanol are viable preserving agents. Glycerol is bacteriostatic in its action, and ethanol is bactericidal in its action.

===Electronic cigarette liquid===

Glycerin, along with propylene glycol, is a common component of e-liquid, a solution used with electronic vaporizers (electronic cigarettes). This glycerol is heated with an atomizer (a heating coil often made of Kanthal wire), producing the aerosol that delivers nicotine to the user.

===Antifreeze===

Like ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, glycerol is a non-ionic kosmotrope that forms strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules, competing with water-water hydrogen bonds. This interaction disrupts the formation of ice. The minimum freezing point temperature is about corresponding to 70% glycerol in water.

Glycerol was historically used as an anti-freeze for automotive applications before being replaced by ethylene glycol, which has a lower freezing point. While the minimum freezing point of a glycerol-water mixture is higher than an ethylene glycol-water mixture, glycerol is not toxic and is being re-examined for use in automotive applications.

In the laboratory, glycerol is a common component of solvents for enzymatic reagents stored at temperatures below due to the depression of the freezing temperature. It is also used as a cryoprotectant where the glycerol is dissolved in water to reduce damage by ice crystals to laboratory organisms that are stored in frozen solutions, such as fungi, bacteria, nematodes, and mammalian embryos. Some organisms like the moor frog produce glycerol to survive freezing temperatures during hibernation.

===Chemical intermediate===
Glycerol is used to produce a variety of useful derivatives.

Nitration gives nitroglycerin, an essential ingredient of various explosives such as dynamite, gelignite, and propellants like cordite. Nitroglycerin under the name glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) is commonly used to relieve angina pectoris, taken in the form of sub-lingual tablets, patches, or as an aerosol spray.

Trifunctional polyether polyols are produced from glycerol and propylene oxide.

Oxidation of glycerol affords mesoxalic acid. Dehydrating glycerol affords hydroxyacetone.

Chlorination of glycerol gives the 1-chloropropane-2,3-diol:
The same compound can be produced by hydrolysis of epichlorohydrin.

Epoxidation by reaction with epichlorohydrin and a Lewis acid yields Glycerol triglycidyl ether.

===Vibration damping===
Glycerol is used as fill for pressure gauges to damp vibration. External vibrations, from compressors, engines, pumps, etc., produce harmonic vibrations within Bourdon gauges that can cause the needle to move excessively, giving inaccurate readings. The excessive swinging of the needle can also damage internal gears or other components, causing premature wear. Glycerol, when poured into a gauge to replace the air space, reduces the harmonic vibrations that are transmitted to the needle, increasing the lifetime and reliability of the gauge.

===Niche uses===
====Entertainment industry====
Glycerol is used by set decorators when filming scenes involving water to prevent an area meant to look wet from drying out too quickly.

Glycerine is also used in the generation of theatrical smoke and fog as a component of the fluid used in fog machines as a replacement for glycol, which has been shown to be an irritant if exposure is prolonged.

====Ultrasonic couplant====
Glycerol can be sometimes used as replacement for water in ultrasonic testing, as it has favourably higher acoustic impedance (2.42 MRayl versus 1.483 MRayl for water) while being relatively safe, non-toxic, non-corrosive and relatively low cost.

===Internal combustion fuel===
Glycerol is also used to power diesel generators supplying electricity for the FIA Formula E series of electric race cars.

===Research on additional uses===
Research continues into potential value-added products of glycerol obtained from biodiesel production. Examples (aside from combustion of waste glycerol):
* Hydrogen gas production.
* Glycerine acetate is a potential fuel additive.
* Additive for starch thermoplastic.
* Conversion to various other chemicals:
** Propylene glycol
** Acrolein
** Ethanol
** Epichlorohydrin, a raw material for epoxy resins

==Metabolism==
Glycerol is a precursor for synthesis of triacylglycerols and of phospholipids in the liver and adipose tissue. When the body uses stored fat as a source of energy, glycerol and fatty acids are released into the bloodstream.

Glycerol is mainly metabolized in the liver. Glycerol injections can be used as a simple test for liver damage, as its rate of absorption by the liver is considered an accurate measure of liver health. Glycerol metabolism is reduced in both cirrhosis and fatty liver disease.

Blood glycerol levels are highly elevated during diabetes, and is believed to be the cause of reduced fertility in patients who suffer from diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Blood glycerol levels in diabetic patients average three times higher than healthy controls. Direct glycerol treatment of testes has been found to cause significant long-term reduction in sperm count. Further testing on this subject was abandoned due to the unexpected results, as this was not the goal of the experiment.

Circulating glycerol does not glycate proteins as do glucose or fructose, and does not lead to the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). In some organisms, the glycerol component can enter the glycolysis pathway directly and, thus, provide energy for cellular metabolism (or, potentially, be converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis).

Before glycerol can enter the pathway of glycolysis or gluconeogenesis (depending on physiological conditions), it must be converted to their intermediate glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the following steps:



The enzyme glycerol kinase is present mainly in the liver and kidneys, but also in other body tissues, including muscle and brain. In adipose tissue, glycerol 3-phosphate is obtained from dihydroxyacetone phosphate with the enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

==Toxicity and safety==
Glycerol has very low toxicity when ingested; its LD50 oral dose for rats is 12600 mg/kg and 8700 mg/kg for mice. It does not appear to cause toxicity when inhaled, although changes in cell maturity occurred in small sections of lung in animals under the highest dose measured. A sub-chronic 90-day nose-only inhalation study in Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats exposed to 0.03, 0.16 and 0.66 mg/L glycerin (Per liter of air) for 6-hour continuous sessions revealed no treatment-related toxicity other than minimal metaplasia of the epithelium lining at the base of the epiglottis in rats exposed to 0.66 mg/L glycerin.
===Glycerol intoxication===
Excessive consumption by children can lead to glycerol intoxication. Symptoms of intoxication include hypoglycemia, nausea and a loss of consciousness. While intoxication as a result of excessive glycerol consumption is rare and its symptoms generally mild, occasional reports of hospitalization have occurred. In the United Kingdom in August 2023, manufacturers of syrup used in slush ice drinks were advised to reduce the amount of glycerol in their formulations by the Food Standards Agency to reduce the risk of intoxication.

Food Standards Scotland advises that slush ice drinks containing glycerol should not be given to children under the age of 4, owing to the risk of intoxication. It also recommends that businesses do not use free refill offers for the drinks in venues where children under the age of 10 are likely to consume them, and that products should be appropriately labelled to inform consumers of the presence of glycerol.
==Historical cases of contamination with diethylene glycol==
On 4 May 2007, the FDA advised all U.S. makers of medicines to test all batches of glycerol for diethylene glycol contamination. This followed an occurrence of hundreds of fatal poisonings in Panama resulting from a falsified import customs declaration by Panamanian import/export firm Aduanas Javier de Gracia Express, S. A. The cheaper diethylene glycol was relabeled as the more expensive glycerol. Between 1990 and 1998, incidents of DEG poisoning reportedly occurred in Argentina, Bangladesh, India, and Nigeria, and resulted in hundreds of deaths. In 1937, more than one hundred people died in the United States after ingesting DEG-contaminated elixir sulfanilamide, a drug used to treat infections.

==Etymology==
The origin of the &quot;gly-&quot; and &quot;glu&quot;- prefixes for glycols and sugars is from Ancient Greek &quot;glukus&quot; which means sweet. Name &quot;glycérine&quot; was coined ca. 1811 by Michel Eugène Chevreul to denote what was previously called &quot;sweet principle of fat&quot; by its discoverer Carl Wilhelm Scheele. It was borrowed into English ca. 1838 and in the 20th c. displaced by 1872 term glycerol featuring an alcohols&#x27; suffix -ol.

<text>Junior is a computer chess program written by the Israeli programmers Amir Ban and Shai Bushinsky. Grandmaster Boris Alterman assisted, in particular with the opening book. Junior can take advantage of multiple processors, taking the name Deep Junior when competing this way in tournaments.

According to Bushinsky, one of the innovations of Junior over other chess programs is the way it counts moves. Junior counts orthodox, ordinary moves as two moves, while it counts interesting moves as only one move, or even less. In this way interesting variations are analyzed more meticulously than less promising lines. This seems to be a generalization of search extensions already used by other programs.

Another approach its designers claim to use is &#x27;opponent modeling&#x27;; Junior might play moves that are not objectively the strongest but that exploit the weaknesses of the opponent. According to Don Dailey ″It has some evaluation that can sting if it&#x27;s in the right situation—that no other program has.″

==Results==
In 2003 Deep Junior played a six-game match against Garry Kasparov, which resulted in a 3–3 tie. 

It won a 2006 rapid game against Teimour Radjabov.

In June 2007, Deep Junior won the &quot;ultimate computer chess challenge&quot; organized by FIDE, defeating Deep Fritz 4–2. These programs opted out of the World Computer Chess Championship, which was held at the same time and won by Rybka with a score of 10/11.

Junior won the World Microcomputer Chess Championship in 1997 and 2001 and the World Computer Chess Championship in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2013; both organized by the International Computer Games Association.

<doc id="172734" wikidata="Q385853" url="?curid=172734" title="De facto standard">
<text>A &quot;de facto&quot; standard is a custom or convention that is commonly used even though its use is not required.

 is a Latin phrase (literally &quot;&quot;), here meaning &quot;in practice but not necessarily ordained by law&quot; or &quot;in practice or actuality, but not officially established&quot;. 

A &quot;de facto&quot; standard contrasts an international standard which is defined by an organization such as International Standards Organization, or a standard required by law (also known as &quot;de jure&quot; standards). 

Joint technical committee on information technology (ISO/IEC JTC1) developed a procedure in order for de facto standards to be processed through the formal standardization system to be transformed into international standards from ISO and IEC.

In social sciences a voluntary standard that is also a &quot;de facto&quot; standard is a typical solution to a coordination problem. The choice of a &quot;de facto&quot; standard tends to be stable in situations in which all parties can realize mutual gains, but only by making mutually consistent decisions. In contrast, an enforced de jure standard is a solution to the prisoner&#x27;s problem.

== Examples ==
Examples of some well known &quot;de facto&quot; standards:
* The driver&#x27;s seat side in a given country often starts as a user/industry preference, turning to a local tradition, then a traffic code.
* The QWERTY layout was one of several options for the layout of letters on typewriter (and later keyboard) keys.
* Early entrance to the market 
===File formats===

* PDF was first created in 1993 by Adobe. Adobe internal standards were part of its software quality systems, but they were neither published nor coordinated by a standards body. With the Acrobat Reader program available for free, and continued support of the format, PDF eventually became the &quot;de facto&quot; standard for printable documents. In 2005, PDF/A became a de jure standard as ISO 19005-1:2005. In 2008 Adobe&#x27;s PDF 1.7 became ISO 32000-1:2008.

* AutoCAD DXF, an ASCII format for import and export of CAD drawings and fragments in the 1980s and 1990s. In the 2000s, XML based standards emerged as &quot;de facto&quot; standards.
* The MP3 audio format started as an alternative to WAV for internet music distribution, then replaced it. It is now supported by the vast majority of music players, audio transport, audio storage, and non-commercial media
* Microsoft Word DOC. Due to the market dominance of Word, it is supported by all office applications that intend to compete with it, typically by reverse engineering the undocumented file format. Microsoft has repeatedly internally changed the file specification between versions of Word to suit their own needs, while continuing to reuse the same file extension identifier for different versions.
* FITS and CSV file formats, commonly used in science and engineering, with FITS traditionally used in astronomy.

===Connectors and interconnect standards===

* Phone connector (3.5 mm jack), RCA and XLR connectors, used in the audio industry for connecting audio equipment such as headphones, mixing desks, microphones, stage lighting, etc.
* MIDI connection (using DIN connector or Phone connector), electrical and protocol standard for connecting musical instruments, synthesizers, drum machines, sequencers, and some audio equipment.
* DMX512 (commonly just DMX) with XLR connector to control and sometimes power stage and venue lights, effects, smoke machines, laser projectors, and pyrotechnics.
* PCI Express electrical and mechanical interface, and interconnect protocol used in computers, servers, and industrial applications.
* GPIB, multi-device bus protocol, mechanical and electronic interface commonly found in electronic test equipment, e.g. digital multimeters, oscilloscopes, etc. Initially created by Hewlett Hewlett-Packard as HP-IP. Commonly used with SCPI protocol.
* HDMI, Display Port, VGA for video, RS-232 for low bandwidth serial communication.
* USB for high speed serial interface in computers and for powering or charging low power external devices (like mobile phones, headphones, portable hard drives) usually using micro USB plug and socket.
* BNC for medium frequency signal in electronic engineering testing (commonly used by signal generators, oscilloscopes, multimeters, etc.) and sometimes in video signal delivery between devices in studios and other professional settings.
* AMP&#x27;s AMP MATE-N-LOK / Molex&#x27;s Standard .093&quot; Pin Power plug and socket, commonly used on hard drives, and other medium power devices both in PC, server, industrial applications, and others where standardized power connector for 5V and 12V is required, and off the shelf PSU can be used. In embedded applications it is usually replaced with smaller square connector, that is easier to connect.
* 2.54 mm (0.1 inch) pin spacing on many electronic components, including DIP, SIL packages, header connectors, and many more. The standard spacing enable use of these devices in prototyping boards and standardized sockets.
* 4-20mA current loop, used in industrial control and automation.
* 3.5 inch and 2.5 inch hard drives.
* 19-inch rack standards for telecommunication, server, storage, audio, music, video, and power equipment.
* ATX motherboard, back plane, and power standards.

===Materials and units of packaging===

* Soldering alloys in electronics, like .
* Aluminium alloys, such as 6061.
* Intermodal 48-foot container.

===Miscellaneous===
* Many American-made spark plugs require a -inch hex socket (21mm) to remove or install.
* The 1/2 inch (12.7mm) spacing of the rollers in a bicycle chain.
* The IBM Personal Computer (PC). By one year after its 1981 release, John Dvorak described the PC as rapidly becoming a &quot;de facto standard microcomputer&quot;. With the MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems, it gained a large share of the personal computer market. Because of the great influence of the IBM PC on the personal computer market, competing products like the Rainbow 100 were eventually withdrawn.
* Programming languages that have multiple implementations such as PHP tend to also have a &quot;de facto&quot; standard. In PHP&#x27;s case the &quot;de facto&quot; standard is the binaries available from php.net, rather than the Phalanger implementation.
* Use of programming languages R and Python in science and engineering disciplines, other than computer science, where automated analysis of data is required, while remaining simple enough for a non-professional.
* TeX typesetting system, commonly used in creating scientific articles and reports for publication (in fact many journals require the publication to be fully written in TeX).

== Standardization disputes ==
There are many examples of &quot;de facto&quot; consolidation of a standard by market forces and competition, in a two-sided market, after a dispute. Examples:
* Alternating current and direct current in the war of the currents.
* VHS over Betamax in the videotape format war.
* Blu-ray and HD DVD during the high definition optical disc format war.
* Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) over Adobe Flash for vector graphics web page animations.

An example of an ongoing dispute is OASIS&#x27;s OpenDocument format &quot;vs&quot; Microsoft&#x27;s Office Open XML format.

known locally as P.G., is the capital and largest town of Toledo District in southern Belize. Punta Gorda is the southernmost sizable town in the nation, with a population of about 5,000 people. Although the town bears a Spanish name, its inhabitants are mostly Kriol/English-speaking and are primarily of Garifuna, East Indian, Kriol, and Maya descent.

Punta Gorda is a seaport and fishing town on the Caribbean Sea. It was a small fishing village before it was settled by a number of Garifuna emigrants from Honduras in 1823. The Garifuna refer to the town as Peini. The town is about fifteen feet above sea level.

==Demographics==
At the time of the 2010 census, Punta Gorda had a population of 5,351. Of these, 24.2% were Garifuna, 17.2% Mestizo, 14.2% Ketchi Maya, 13.8% Mixed, 10.5% Creole, 8.3% East Indian, 8.1% Mopan Maya, 1.4% Caucasian, 0.9% Asian, 0.5% African, 0.1% Hindu, 0.1% Mennonite, 0.1% Yucatec Maya and 0.4% others.

===Religion===
St. Peter Claver Catholic parish, with a large elementary school, serves the predominantly Catholic population of the town.

== Climate ==
The climate is tropical rainforest (Köppen: &quot;Af&quot;), similar to that found in the Amazon Basin, with precipitation being high and with temperatures always above 25 °C on average every month.

==Tourism==

There are several hotels in Punta Gorda that draw tourists with their ocean views. Punta Gorda is also a gateway to several well-regarded jungle accommodations, The Lodge at Big Falls, Copal Tree Lodge, and Hickatee Cottages. Every May, the town hosts the Toledo Cacao Festival, held over the Commonwealth Day holiday weekend, which celebrates Toledo district&#x27;s ancient and modern-day links with cacao and chocolate.

==Transport==

Punta Gorda is the main point of transportation for people visiting the Toledo district and the offshore southern cayes. There is a small airport which serves domestic flights from Maya Island Air and Tropic Air. James Bus Line is based in Punta Gorda and offers a regular service to points north, such as Independence, Dangriga, Belmopan, and Belize City. Water taxis offer daily crossings to Puerto Barrios and twice weekly service to Livingston in Guatemala. Unlike the purpose-built water taxis plying the routes between Belize city and the northern cays, the services from Punta Gorda are provided by small, open boats. Punta Gorda will have railway lines to Dangriga and Belize City that are currently in the feasibility study being conducted by CRECG.

==Health care==
The town is served by Punta Gorda Polyclinic, as well as a few private doctors.

==Education==
Punta Gorda is served by 3 primary schools: St. Peter Claver School, Bethel Seventh Day Adventist School, and Punta Gorda Methodist School. It also has one high school, the Toledo Community College, and the Punta Gorda campus of the University of Belize.

==Notable people==
Notable people from Punta Gorda include paranda musician Paul Nabor, Belize&#x27;s &quot;Queen of Brukdown&quot;, Leela Vernon and Destiny Wagner, Miss Earth 2021, the first Belizean woman to win the Miss Earth title.

<text>Elias James Corey (born July 12, 1928) is an American organic chemist. In 1990, he won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for his development of the theory and methodology of organic synthesis&quot;, specifically retrosynthetic analysis. 

Regarded by many as one of the greatest living chemists, he has developed numerous synthetic reagents, methodologies and total syntheses and has advanced the science of organic synthesis considerably.

==Biography==
E.J. Corey (the surname was anglicized from Levantine Arabic &quot;Khoury&quot;, meaning &quot;priest&quot;) was born to Lebanese Greek Orthodox Christian immigrants Fatima (née Hasham) and Elias Corey in Methuen, Massachusetts, north of Boston. His mother changed his name from William to &quot;Elias&quot; to honor his father, who died eighteen months after Corey&#x27;s birth. His widowed mother, brother, two sisters, aunt and uncle all lived together in a spacious house, struggling through the Great Depression. As a young boy, Corey was independent and enjoyed sports such as baseball, football, and hiking. He attended a Catholic elementary school and Lawrence High School in Lawrence, Massachusetts.

At the age of 16 Corey entered MIT, where he earned both a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1948 and a Ph.D. under Professor John C. Sheehan in 1951. Upon entering MIT, Corey&#x27;s only experience with science was in mathematics, and he began his college career pursuing a degree in engineering. After his first chemistry class in his sophomore year he began rethinking his long-term career plans and graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemistry. Immediately thereafter, at the invitation of Professor John C. Sheehan, Corey remained at MIT for his Ph.D. After his graduate career he was offered an appointment at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where he became a full professor of chemistry in 1956 at the age of 27. He was initiated as a member of the Zeta chapter of Alpha Chi Sigma at the University of Illinois in 1952. In 1959, he moved to Harvard University, where he is currently an emeritus professor of organic chemistry with an active Corey Group research program. He chose to work in organic chemistry because of &quot;its intrinsic beauty and its great relevance to human health&quot;. He has also been an advisor to Pfizer for more than 50 years.

Among numerous honors, Corey was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1988, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1990, and the American Chemical Society&#x27;s greatest honor, the Priestley Medal, in 2004.

==Major contributions==

===Reagents===
Corey has developed several new synthetic reagents: 

===Methodology===
Several reactions developed in Corey&#x27;s lab have become commonplace in modern synthetic organic chemistry. At least 302 methods have been developed in the Corey group since 1950. Several reactions have been named after him: 

===Total syntheses===
E. J. Corey and his research group have completed many total syntheses. At least 265 natural compounds have been synthesized in the Corey group since 1950.

His 1969 total syntheses of several prostaglandins are considered classics. Specifically the synthesis of Prostaglandin F2α presents several challenges. The presence of both &quot;cis&quot; and &quot;trans&quot; olefins as well as five asymmetric carbon atoms renders the molecule a desirable challenge for organic chemists. Corey&#x27;s retrosynthetic analysis outlines a few key disconnections that lead to simplified precursors (scheme 23). 

Molecular simplification began first by disconnecting both carbon chains with a Wittig reaction and Horner-Wadsworth Emmons modification. The Wittig reaction affords the &quot;cis&quot; product, while the Horner-Wadsworth Emmons produces the &quot;trans&quot; olefin. The published synthesis reveals a 1:1 diastereomeric mixture of the carbonyl reduction using zinc borohydride. However, years later Corey and co-workers established the CBS reduction. One of the examples that exemplified this protocol was an intermediate in the prostaglandin synthesis revealing a 9:1 mixture of the desired diastereomer (scheme 24). 

The iodolactonization transform affords an allylic alcohol leading to a key Baeyer-Villiger intermediate. This oxidation regioselectively inserts an oxygen atom between the ketone and the most electron-rich site. The pivotal intermediate leads to a straightforward conversion to the Diels-Alder structural goal, which provides the carbon framework for the functionalized cyclopentane ring. Later Corey developed an asymmetric Diels-Alder reaction employing a chiral oxazoborolidine, greatly simplifying the synthetic route to the prostaglandins.

Other notable syntheses: 
* Longifolene
* Ginkgolides A and B
* Lactacystin
* Miroestrol
* Ecteinascidin 743
* Salinosporamide A

===Computer programs===
Corey and his research group created LHASA, a program that uses artificial intelligence to discover sequences of reaction which may lead to total synthesis. The program was one of the first to use a graphical interface to input and display chemical structures.

===Publications===
E.J. Corey has more than 1100 publications. In 2002, the American Chemical Society (ACS) recognized him as the &quot;Most Cited Author in Chemistry&quot;. In 2007, he received the first ACS Publications Division &quot;Cycle of Excellence High Impact Contributor Award&quot; and was ranked the number one chemist in terms of research impact by the Hirsch Index (h-index). His books include:

==Altom suicide==

Jason Altom, one of Corey&#x27;s students, committed suicide in 1998. Altom&#x27;s suicide caused controversy because he explicitly blamed Corey, his research advisor, for his suicide. Altom cited in his 1998 farewell note &quot;abusive research supervisors&quot; as one reason for taking his life. Altom&#x27;s suicide note also contained explicit instructions on how to reform the relationship between students and their supervisors.

Altom was the third member of Corey&#x27;s lab to commit suicide since 1980. Corey was reportedly devastated and bewildered by his student&#x27;s death. Corey said, &quot;That letter doesn&#x27;t make sense. At the end, Jason must have been delusional or irrational in the extreme.&quot; Corey also claimed he never questioned Altom&#x27;s intellectual contributions. &quot;I did my best to guide Jason as a mountain guide would to guide someone climbing a mountain. I did my best every step of the way,&quot; Corey states. &quot;My conscience is clear. Everything Jason did came out of our partnership. We never had the slightest disagreement.&quot; The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) cited &quot;The New York Times&quot; article on Altom&#x27;s suicide as an example of problematic reporting, arguing that Altom presented warning signs of depression and suicidal ideation and that the article had scapegoated Corey despite a lack of secondary evidence that the advisor&#x27;s behavior had contributed to Altom&#x27;s distress. According to &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, students and professors said Altom actually retained Corey&#x27;s support.
==Corey Group members==
As of 2010, approximately 700 people have been Corey Group members including notable students Eric Block,
Dale L. Boger, Weston T. Borden, David E. Cane, Rick L. Danheiser, William L. Jorgensen, John Katzenellenbogen, Alan P. Kozikowski, Bruce H. Lipshutz, David R. Liu, Albert Meyers, K. C. Nicolaou, Ryōji Noyori, Gary H. Posner, Bengt I. Samuelsson, Dieter Seebach, Vinod K. Singh, Brian Stoltz, Alice Ting, Hisashi Yamamoto, Phil Baran and Jin-Quan Yu. A database of 580 former members and their current affiliation was developed for Corey&#x27;s 80th birthday in July 2008.

==Woodward–Hoffmann rules==
When awarded the Priestley Medal in 2004, E. J. Corey created a controversy with his claim to have inspired Robert Burns Woodward prior to the development of the Woodward–Hoffmann rules. Corey wrote:

&quot;On May 4, 1964, I suggested to my colleague R. B. Woodward a simple explanation involving the symmetry of the perturbed (HOMO) molecular orbitals for the stereoselective cyclobutene → 1,3-butadiene and 1,3,5-hexatriene → cyclohexadiene conversions that provided the basis for the further development of these ideas into what became known as the Woodward–Hoffmann rules.&quot;

This was Corey&#x27;s first public statement on his claim that starting on May 5, 1964, Woodward put forth Corey&#x27;s explanation as his own thought with no mention of Corey and the conversation of May 4. Corey had discussed his claim privately with Hoffmann and close colleagues since 1964. Corey mentions that he made the Priestley statement &quot;so the historical record would be correct&quot;.

Corey&#x27;s claim and contribution were publicly rebutted by Roald Hoffmann in the journal &quot;Angewandte Chemie&quot;. In the rebuttal, Hoffmann states that he asked Corey over the course of their long discussion of the matter why Corey did not make the issue public. Corey responded that he thought such a public disagreement would hurt Harvard and that he would not &quot;consider doing anything against Harvard, to which I was and am so devoted.&quot; Corey also hoped that Woodward himself would correct the historical record &quot;as he grew older, more considerate, and more sensitive to his own conscience.&quot; Woodward died suddenly of a heart attack in his sleep in 1979.

==Awards and honors==
E.J. Corey has received more than 40 major awards including the Linus Pauling Award (1973), Franklin Medal (1978), Tetrahedron Prize (1983), Wolf Prize in Chemistry (1986), National Medal of Science (1988), Japan Prize (1989), Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1990), Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (1991), Roger Adams Award (1993), and the Priestley Medal (2004). He was inducted into the Alpha Chi Sigma Hall of Fame in 1998.
As of 2008, he has been awarded 19 honorary degrees from universities around the world including Oxford University (UK), Cambridge University (UK), and National Chung Cheng University. In 2013, the E.J. Corey Institute of Biomedical Research (CIBR) opened in Jiangyin, Jiangsu Province, China.

Corey was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1998.

<text>The Shetland pony or Sheltie is a Scottish breed of pony originating in the Shetland Islands in the north of Scotland. It may stand up to at the withers. It has a heavy coat and short legs, is strong for its size, and is used for riding, driving, and pack purposes.

== History ==

Shetland ponies originated in the Shetland Islands, located northeast of mainland Scotland. Small horses have been kept in the Shetland Islands since the Bronze Age. People who lived on the islands probably later crossed the native stock with ponies imported by Norse settlers. Shetland ponies were probably also influenced by the Celtic pony, brought to the islands by settlers between 2000 and 1000 BCE. The harsh climate and scarce food developed the ponies into extremely hardy animals.

Shetland ponies were first used for pulling carts and for carrying peat, seaweed, and ploughing land. Then, as the Industrial Revolution increased the need for coal in the mid-nineteenth century, thousands of Shetland ponies were taken to mainland Britain to be pit ponies, working underground hauling coal, often for their entire (frequently shortened) lives. Coal mines in the eastern United States also imported some of these animals. The last mine that used Shetland ponies in the United States closed in 1971.

The Shetland Pony Stud-Book Society is the breed society for the traditional Shetland throughout the world. It was started in 1890 to maintain purity and encourage high-quality animals. In 1957, the Shetland Islands Premium Stallion Scheme was formed to subsidise high-quality registered stallions to improve the breeding stock.

A number of pony breeds derive from the traditional Shetland. These include the American Shetland Pony and Pony of the Americas in the United States, and the Deutsches Classic Pony in Germany.

== Characteristics ==

The Shetland Pony is hardy and strong, in part because it developed in the harsh conditions of the Shetland Islands. It has a small head, widely spaced eyes and small and alert ears. It has a short muscular neck, a compact stocky body, short strong legs and a shorter-than-normal cannon-bone in relation to its size. A short broad back and deep girth are universal characteristics, as is a springy stride. It has a long thick mane and tail, and a dense double winter coat to withstand harsh weather. It may be of any known horse coat colour other than spotted.

It is not unusual for a Shetland pony to live more than 30 years.

==Uses==
Today, Shetlands are ridden by children and are shown by both children and adults at horse shows in harness driving classes as well as for pleasure driving outside of the show ring. Shetlands are ridden by small children at horse shows, in riding schools and stables as well as for pleasure. They are seen working in commercial settings such as fairs or carnivals to provide short rides for visitors. They are also seen at petting zoos and sometimes are used for therapeutic horseback riding purposes. In the United Kingdom, Shetlands are also featured in the Shetland Pony Grand National, galloping around a racecourse with young jockeys. A few Shetland ponies still fulfil traditional working roles on the islands, and can be seen carrying peat (which is abundant and used as a fuel source in Shetland) cut from the hillsides in large saddlebags. Their strong physique and ability to cross a variety of difficult terrain types means they are still a viable choice for the job, even in an age of mechanised agriculture.

Junior Harness Racing was founded in Queensland by a group of breeders to give young people aged 6–16 an opportunity to obtain a practical introduction to the harness racing industry. The children have the opportunity to drive Shetland ponies in harness under race conditions. No prize money is payable on pony races, although winners and place-getters receive medallions.

Miniature Shetlands have been trained as guide horses to take the same role as guide dogs. This task is also performed by other miniature horse breeds.

<doc id="172745" wikidata="Q379169" url="?curid=172745" title="Carmageddon">
<text>Carmageddon is a vehicular combat video game released for personal computers in 1997. It was produced by Stainless Games and published by Interplay Productions and Sales Curve Interactive. It was ported to other platforms, and spawned a series.

In 2011, Stainless Games obtained the rights to &quot;Carmageddon&quot; from Square Enix Europe. iOS and Android ports were released in 2012 and 2013, respectively. THQ Nordic acquired the rights to the &quot;Carmageddon&quot; series from Stainless Games in December 2018.

==Gameplay==
The player races a vehicle against several other computer-controlled competitors in various settings, including city, mine and industrial areas. The player has a certain amount of time to complete each race, and more time may be gained by collecting bonuses, damaging the competitors&#x27; cars or by running over pedestrians.

Races are completed by either completing the course as one would a normal racing game, &quot;wasting&quot; (wrecking) all other race cars or killing all pedestrians on the level. The game includes thirty-six racetracks, played across eleven different locations. The game features three instrumental remixes from Fear Factory&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Demanufacture&quot;.

==Development==
The game that became &quot;Carmageddon&quot; started out as &quot;3D Destruction Derby&quot;, a banger racing sim prototyped by Stainless Software. This was signed by SCi in 1995, with the condition that it be made into a licensed game to guarantee popularity. Initially, SCi wanted to use the &quot;Mad Max&quot; license, but was unable to find out who owned the rights to the franchise. It instead secured the &quot;Death Race 2000&quot; license, as a sequel to the original film was at that time planned.

According to head programmer Patrick Buckland, the initial concept stemmed from team members getting bored while playing racing games, leading them to ultimately drive in the wrong direction and crash into other cars. They decided it made sense to create a game where this was the objective to begin with. Shortly after, Psygnosis released a game with this same concept, &quot;Destruction Derby&quot;.

The notion of running over pedestrians was added to distinguish the game from &quot;Destruction Derby&quot; and arouse controversy. However, there had been a number of recent games which involved running over pedestrians, such as &quot;Quarantine&quot; and &quot;Die Hard Trilogy&quot;. Rob Henderson from SCi suggested increasing the potential for controversy by awarding the player points for the pedestrian kills.

The sequel to &quot;Death Race 2000&quot; was later cancelled, but by this point SCi were impressed enough by Stainless&#x27;s work that they felt Stainless could try creating their own intellectual property. The name &quot;Carmageddon&quot; was coined, and development proceeded with the designers allowed unusually free rein with regard to the content of the game.

The game uses the BRender engine, which Stainless Software were already thoroughly familiar with; one of their previous contracts was to port BRender to Macintosh and build the corresponding tools and demos. The PlayStation conversion was subcontracted to developer Elite, with the plan to release the PC and PlayStation versions simultaneously. Buckland anticipated that Elite would have problems with the conversion due to &quot;Carmageddon&quot;″s open environments.

==Release==
&quot;Carmageddon&quot; was originally released for MS-DOS, Windows, and Mac OS in 1997. It won the &quot;Game of the Year&quot; trophy in the 1997 PC Zone reader awards and &quot;Driving Game of the Year&quot; 1997. An expansion pack, &quot;Splat Pack&quot;, was released in 1997. It included new tracks, vehicles, environments, network levels, and 3Dfx support.

The &quot;Carmageddon Max Pack&quot;, released on February 17, 1998, bundled the original game and its expansion pack into one package. As a bonus, it also included a strategy guide, mousepad, and a leather car key chain with &quot;Carmageddon&quot;″s logo. During the inaugural Interactive Achievement Awards, the &quot;Max Pack&quot; received a nomination for &quot;PC Action Game of the Year&quot; by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences.

A port was in development for the Gizmondo, but was never released. &quot;Carmageddon&quot; and its expansion &quot;Splat Pack&quot; were released on GOG.com on September 27, 2012, for modern operating systems. In addition, a port of the game for Apple&#x27;s mobile devices (iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad) was released on October 17 the same year. In July 2011, the City of Los Angeles launched a massive media campaign under the title &quot;Carmageddon&quot; to warn drivers about a major closure on the 405 Freeway during the weekend of July 15–17. Stainless Games capitalized on the coincidence to promote the upcoming &quot;Carmageddon&quot; releases by announcing on the official web site that &quot;L.A. Celebrates &quot;Carmageddon&quot;&quot; and &quot;Yes, it&#x27;s official! The news that &quot;Carmageddon&quot; is back has been such a hit in California, that the authorities have decided to dedicate a whole weekend to the game!&quot;

A port for Android based devices was released on May 10, 2013.

===Controversy===

In many countries (including Germany and, for a short time, the United Kingdom), the first release of the game was censored.

The censored version contained zombies with green blood or robots with black oil instead of humans, as running over the non-human figures was considered more acceptable by their respective ratings boards. In the United Kingdom, the BBFC refused to certify the game unless all blood and gore was removed. After ten months of appeal, the BBFC certified the original version.

In some countries, such as Brazil, the game was banned completely. In Australia, the game was passed completely uncut with a MA15+ rating.

==Reception==
According to the co-founders of Stainless Games, about two million copies of the &quot;Carmageddon&quot; series were sold in total. NPD Techworld, a firm that tracked sales in the United States, reported 118,500 units sold of &quot;Carmageddon&quot;″s computer version by December 2002.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; was enamoured of the open ended, chaotic nature of the game, commenting that &quot;&quot;Carmageddon&quot; touches that particular collective nerve that fuses the wholesome popularity of the All-American Racing Game with the homicidal singularity of the 70s cult film into an onscreen experience that can only be compared to the kind of automotive mayhem that a five-year-old American male wreaks with his Matchbox and Hot Wheels cars.&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot; stated that &quot;if you&#x27;re willing to sweep your morals under the rug for a while, and shamelessly commit auto homicide on a grand scale, then &quot;Carmageddon&quot; is an absolute blast.&quot; &quot;GamePro&quot; gave a more mixed review, commenting that the game is intense and high on longevity, but that its focus on wanton destruction and gore is in questionable taste and ultimately to the detriment of the gameplay. They also found the graphics mediocre and the controls when using a keyboard to be &quot;frustrating and sluggish&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Carmageddon&quot; had two sequels, &quot;Carmageddon II: Carpocalypse Now&quot; (1998) and &quot;Carmageddon TDR 2000&quot; (2000). SCi planned &quot;Carmageddon 4&quot; for a release in the end of 2005. In August 2005 SCi (at the time operating under the name Eidos) put development at Visual Science on hold for unspecified reasons. SCi and Eidos went on to focus on other projects, while Square Enix Europe obtained the series&#x27;s intellectual property rights.

=== Mobile versions ===
In 2005, Swedish publisher Synergenix released two adaptations of the game for mobile devices entitled &quot;Carmageddon&quot; and &quot;Carmageddon 3D&quot;, developed by Impressionware and Kampo Interactive, respectively. Released on July 4, 2005, &quot;Carmageddon&quot; features a top-down perspective for lower-end Java devices. The game was later made available for BREW-compatible devices. &quot;Carmageddon 3D&quot; features three-dimensional graphics and was released on November 29, 2005, for Symbian and Mophun-based mobile devices.

===Reboot===
A reboot of the series, &quot;&quot;, was developed by Stainless Games, who re-acquired the rights to the &quot;Carmageddon&quot; name and released the game in May 2015. The game is downloadable for Windows. Funding for the game came partially from a Kickstarter campaign and donations through their main website. Further funds were secured from Les Edgar (co-founder of Bullfrog Productions). An updated version of the game, &quot;Max Damage&quot;, was released the following year for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

===THQ Nordic===
In 2018, THQ Nordic bought the rights to the &quot;Carmageddon&quot; intellectual property. On August 3, 2021, THQ Nordic announced a &quot;Carmageddon&quot;-themed tournament in their &quot;Wreckfest&quot; racing game. It includes two race tracks, &quot;Bleak City&quot; and &quot;Devil&#x27;s Canyon&quot;, and the Eagle R car from &quot;Max Damage&quot;.

<doc id="172748" wikidata="Q882907" url="?curid=172748" title="Corozal Town">
<text>Corozal is a town in Belize, capital of Corozal District. Corozal is located about 84 miles north of Belize City, and 9 miles from the border with Mexico. The population of Corozal, according to the main results of the 2010 census, is 9,871.

Corozal was a private estate before becoming a town in the 1840s, mostly settled by Maya Mestizo refugees from the Caste War of Yucatán. Much of the town was built over an ancient Maya city, sometimes known as Santa Rita; this may have been the original Pre-Columbian town called Chactemal, which extended from present day Corozal to Chetumal, Mexico. Corozal Town was badly damaged by Hurricane Janet in 1955 and was substantially rebuilt afterward.

== History ==

Corozal, the northmost town in Belize, was founded in 1848 by refugees from the Maya Indian uprising against the Spanish in neighboring Yucatán. This uprising, known as the Caste War of Yucatán (from the Spanish &quot;castes&quot; or race), began as a war against the Spaniards, but it eventually became a war against the Mestizos. The Mestizos, half Spanish and half Indian, had proved to be formidable allies of the Spaniards and were thus mortal enemies of the Maya Indians.

A massacre at Bacalar, Mexico — a Mestizo stronghold about thirty miles north of Corozal Town — finally led to the exodus of thousands of Mestizos from Bacalar and the surrounding area. Between 1848 and 1856 more than 10,000 refugees crossed the Rio Hondo, the river that now serves as a boundary between Belize and Mexico. These immigrants sought refuge in northern Belize and increased the population of Corozal Town to 4500. Mr. James Blake, a magistrate, let them settle on lands in the Corozal District and helped them to establish the new crop — sugar cane.

The Mestizo refugees were far from safe in Corozal Town as the Maya Indians from the Mexican base in Santa Cruz Bravo — today Carrillo Puerto — made several incursions in Corozal Town. In defense, Corozal became a garrison town and Fort Barlee was built here in 1870. Today, the brick corner supports of the fort surround the post office complex of the buildings across from the central town square.

The immigrants brought with them Maya Mestizo culture: Spanish and Yucatec Maya language, Catholicism and Maya folklore, the use of alcalde, their family structure and way of life. Soon, there emerged a local replication of the society of the Yucatán within the boundaries of a country ruled by English expatriates.

Across the bay from Corozal Town are the mounds of Cerros, the first Maya coastal trading center. Cerros is considered one of the most important late preclassic Maya sites because it represented the first experiment with kingship in the Maya world. The remains include a number of temples, plazas, ball courts, canals, and minor structures. The most interesting artifacts so far discovered are the five jade head pendants.

Within Corozal, itself can be found another Maya ruins from the fourteenth century AD. Known as Santa Rita, the pyramid site sits atop the remains of a Maya city that dominated the area for more than 2000 years, and burial sites rich in jewelry and artifacts have been unearthed there. The monument is said to be the center of ancient Chactemal, the Maya capital of the area at the time of the first Spanish attempt to conquer the Yucatec Mayas in the early 16th century. The ruins of Santa Rita is located near the town&#x27;s Hospital and is surrounded by the villages of San Andres, San Antonio, and Paraiso, by walking distances. An estimated 90% of the town was destroyed by Hurricane Janet in 1955, and most of the present structures post-date that hurricane.

The town is served by Corozal Hospital.

==Demographics==
At the time of the 2010 census, Corozal had a population of 10,287. Of these, 66.2% were Mestizo, 12.7% Creole, 9.4% Mixed, 3.1% East Indian, 2.5% Asian, 1.2% Garifuna, 1.1% Caucasian, 1.0% Hindu, 0.8% Ketchi Maya, 0.5% Lebanese, 0.5% Yucatec Maya, 0.3% African, 0.2% Mopan Maya, 0.2% Mennonite and 0.2% others.

In terms of languages spoken (multiple answers allowed), 77.8% spoke Spanish, 75.8% English, 35.1% Creole, 2.5% Mandarin or Cantonese, 1.0% Hindi, 0.8% Garifuna, 0.5% Yucatec Maya, 0.2% Ketchi Maya, 0.2% Mopan Maya, 0.1% German and 0.8% other languages; 0.2% could not speak.

<doc id="172753" wikidata="Q1776859" url="?curid=172753" title="Christmas cracker">
<text>Christmas crackers are festive table decorations that make a snapping sound when pulled open, and typically contain a small gift, paper hat and a joke. They are part of Christmas celebrations in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Commonwealth countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa.

A cracker consists of a segmented cardboard tube wrapped in a brightly decorated twist of paper with a prize in the centre, making it resemble an oversized sweet-wrapper. The cracker is pulled apart by two people, each holding an outer chamber, causing the cracker to split unevenly and leaving one person holding the central chamber and prize. The split is accompanied by a mild bang or snapping sound produced by the effect of friction on a shock-sensitive, chemically impregnated card strip (similar to that used in a cap gun). One chemical used for the friction strip is silver fulminate.

==Tradition==

Crackers are traditionally pulled during Christmas dinner or at Christmas parties. One version of the cracker ritual holds that the person who ends up with the larger end of cracker earns the right to keep the contents of the cardboard tube. Sometimes, each participant retains ownership of their own cracker and keeps its contents regardless of the outcome. Christmas crackers traditionally contain a colourful crown-shaped hat made of tissue paper, a small toy, a plastic model, or a trinket, and a small strip of paper with a motto, a joke, a riddle, or a piece of trivia. The paper hats, with the appearance of crowns, are usually worn at Christmas dinner. The tradition of wearing festive hats is believed to date back to Roman times and the Saturnalia celebrations, which also involved decorative headgear.

Christmas crackers are also associated with Knut&#x27;s parties, held in Sweden at the end of the Christmas season.

Author and historian John Julius Norwich (Viscount Norwich) was known for sending his family and friends a Christmas Cracker each year which was a kind of expanded Christmas card of anecdotes, trivia and witticisms collected from history and literature. Initially he printed them privately to give to friends but also sold via some London bookstores. His 49th and final cracker was published posthumously in the year of his death.

==History==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; records the pulling of &quot;crackers&quot; from 1847.

=== Tom Smith ===

Tradition tells of how Tom Smith (1823–1869) of London invented crackers in 1847. He created the crackers as a development of his bon-bon sweets, which he sold in a twist of paper (the origins of the traditional sweet-wrapper). As sales of bon-bons slumped, Smith began to come up with new promotional ideas. His first tactic was to insert love messages into the wrappers of the sweets (similar to fortune cookies).

Smith was inspired to add a &quot;crackle&quot; element after hearing the crackle of a log he had just put on a fire. The size of the paper wrapper had to be increased to incorporate the banger mechanism, and the sweet itself was eventually dropped, to be replaced by a : fans, jewellery and other substantial items. The new product was initially marketed as the &quot;Cosaque&quot; (French for Cossack), but the onomatopoeic &quot;cracker&quot; soon became the commonly used name, as rival varieties came on the market.

The other elements of the modern cracker—the gifts, paper hats and varied designs—were all introduced by Tom Smith&#x27;s son, Walter Smith, to differentiate his product from the rival cracker manufacturers which had suddenly sprung up.

Tom Smith &amp; Company merged with Caley Crackers in 1953.

A memorial water fountain to Tom Smith and his family stands in Finsbury Square, London.

=== Art ===

A Christmas cracker is the subject of &quot;The Party Favor&quot;, an oil painting by American artist Norman Rockwell.
 The painting appeared as cover art for &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; on 26 April 1919.

=== Records ===
The World&#x27;s Largest Christmas Cracker was measured at 63.1 m (207 ft) long and 4 m (13 ft) in diameter and was made by the parents of children at Ley Hill School and Pre-School, Chesham, Buckinghamshire, UK on 20 December 2001.

The longest Christmas cracker pulling chain consisted of 1081 people and was achieved by The Harrodian School in London on 10 December 2015.

On 17 August 2020, while filming a Christmas episode of the television series &quot;QI&quot;, British comedian Alan Davies set a Guinness World Record for the most crackers pulled by an individual in 30 seconds. He achieved 35 successful cracks, outscoring fellow panelist Justin Moorhouse by five in a head-to-head competition. Davies&#x27; record stood until Joel Corry achieved 41 successful cracks at Capital&#x27;s Jingle Bell Ball on 12 December 2021.

== Flight restrictions ==
Rules on transporting Christmas crackers in luggage vary by airline and airport. Passengers on commercial flights in and to the United States are explicitly prohibited from carrying Christmas crackers on board or in checked baggage.

<doc id="172756" wikidata="Q882964" url="?curid=172756" title="Orange Walk Town">
<text>Orange Walk is the fourth largest town in Belize, with a population of about 13,400 (Official Release of the Main Findings of the 2010 Population and Housing Census). It is the capital of the Orange Walk District. Orange Walk Town is located on the left bank of the New River, north of Belize City and south of Corozal Town. Despite the English name of the city, its residents are primarily Spanish-speaking mestizos.

==History==
In the days of the Maya civilization, the area was known as Holpatin. The district is home to the largest Maya temple of the pre-classic period. The Maya of the area came in contact with the Europeans in the 1530s, after which the two groups fought over land. In 1848, there was a massive influx of Maya and Mestizos from Mexico, fleeing the Caste War of Yucatán (1847–1901). This caused a rapid growth of population. In 1872, it was the site of the Battle of Orange Walk. Lamanai (meaning &quot;submerged crocodile&quot; in Mayan dialect) and Cuello (&quot;neck&quot; in Spanish) are two very early Mayan ruins located in Orange Walk. Cuello is in fact the oldest Mayan settlement in Belize, dating back to around 2000 BC.

In the nineteenth century, Orange Walk was a small township located mostly on the western banks of the New River, consisting mainly of thatched and wooden dwellings. The town had grown from a stop on the New River by logwood, mahogany and chicle workers who used the New River as a transport system and stopped on their way to the sea with their products at the logging camp known as Orange Walk. With time the settlement continued growing, especially after the Caste War in neighbouring Mexico brought many migrants escaping the war and who settled in town or in villages around the town. In 1963 a sugar mill was started that brought another influx of migrant workers from other districts and surrounding countries, looking for work and land. Population in Orange Walk Town grew as a result.

==Economy==

With the Maya and Mestizos came their many traditions that today abound in the region. One such thing that they brought was sugar cane, which in the years to come became the basis of one of Belize&#x27;s leading industries. Today, this industry continues to thrive in the region, and Orange Walk Town is nicknamed &quot;Sugar City&quot;. The local Tower Hill Sugar Factory (Belize Sugar Industries) handles all of the country&#x27;s sugar cane output. Rum is also made from the local cane by refineries such as Cuello Refinery Ltd, Caribbean Refinery and Old Master Rum. It is then mostly consumed nationally and not customarily exported. The farming of other crops, and tourism, also play a role in the economy. Overall, Orange Walk has one of Belize&#x27;s strongest and most productive economies. The poverty rate in Orange Walk is 24.9%, the second-lowest in the country. The quality of life is also comparatively high due to the strong economy. The median income adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is about US$12,000.

Tourism in Orange Walk is mostly ecotourism.

<text>Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (stylized as Give me convenience OR give me death) is a compilation album by the American hardcore punk band Dead Kennedys. It was released in June 1987 through front man Jello Biafra&#x27;s record label Alternative Tentacles.

The image on its album cover is a composite of a 1950s Barbasol shaving cream ad and a 1946 famine in Calcutta.

==Overview==
The album consists of songs (or in some cases, different versions of songs) that were not released on the band&#x27;s studio albums. The original vinyl version had tracks 16 and 17 on an extra flexi disc. The album was certified gold by both BPI and the RIAA in December 2007. The title is a play on the ultimatum by Patrick Henry, &quot;Give me liberty or give me death!&quot;, and is intended as a commentary on American consumerism. &quot;Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death&quot; was the last Dead Kennedys album that Biafra approved the production of, and their last album released through Alternative Tentacles.

The album includes &quot;Pull My Strings&quot;, recorded live, which they played only once on March 25, 1980 at the Bay Area Music Awards (&quot;BAMMIES&quot;) in front of music industry bigwigs to give the event some &quot;new wave credibility&quot;. The band spent the day of the show practicing their increasingly popular &quot;California Über Alles&quot;, the song they were asked to play. About 15 seconds into the song Jello Biafra said, &quot;Hold it! We&#x27;ve gotta prove that we&#x27;re adults now. We&#x27;re not a punk rock band, we&#x27;re a new wave band.&quot;
The band, who all wore white shirts with a big, black S painted on the front, pulled black ties from around the backs of their necks to form a dollar sign, then started playing &quot;Pull My Strings&quot;, a satirical attack on the ethics of the mainstream music industry. The song also referenced the Knack&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;My Sharona&quot;. The song was never recorded in the studio but this performance, the only time the song was ever performed, was included on the album.

Also included is &quot;Night of the Living Rednecks&quot;, which was recorded during a show in Portland, Oregon in 1979 when East Bay Ray snapped a guitar string as the band finished their song &quot;Chemical Warfare&quot;. While the guitar string was being replaced, Biafra vamped for time by telling a story, backed by Ted and Flouride performing a jazz-style instrumental, about how on the last trip the band made to Portland, where he had a confrontation with some &quot;dumb rich kids&quot; in a &quot;life-size Hot Wheels car&quot; that involved him throwing a rock at their vehicle after they sprayed water on him and later trapping himself in a telephone booth when they retaliated.

<doc id="172758" wikidata="Q300403" url="?curid=172758" title="A Farewell to Kings">
<text>A Farewell to Kings is the fifth studio album by Canadian rock band Rush, released on Anthem Records on August 29, 1977. The album reached No. 11 in Canada and marked a growth in the band&#x27;s international fanbase, becoming their first Top 40 album in the US and the UK.

After reaching a critical and commercial peak with &quot;2112&quot; and touring the album, Rush decided to record the follow-up outside Toronto for the first time and settled in Rockfield Studios in Wales after their debut European tour. &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; is noted for the band expanding their sound with greater use of synthesizers and each member playing more instruments than before, and having long and short tracks such as the 11-minute &quot;Xanadu&quot; and the under 3-minute &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot;, both of which became live favourites. The closing science-fiction themed &quot;Cygnus X-1 Book I: The Voyage&quot; ends on a cliffhanger which concludes on the next album, &quot;Hemispheres&quot;. 

&quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; received a generally positive reception from critics. &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s first single, which reached No. 36 in the UK. Rush supported the album with their most extensive tour at the time, headlining major venues across North America and Europe for over 140 dates. A 40th anniversary remastered edition with bonus tracks and a 5.1 surround sound mix was released in 2017.

==Background and recording==
In June 1977, Rush ended their tour supporting their breakthrough album &quot;2112&quot; and subsequent live release, &quot;All the World&#x27;s a Stage&quot;. The tour culminated in the band&#x27;s first European dates with shows in England, two in Scotland at the Glasgow Apollo. At one of those nights at the Apollo, Geddy changed his lyrics on Working Man singing that when he got home at five O&#x27;clock he took out a McEwan&#x27;s beer, which led to a large cheer from the crowd, and one in Sweden, which attracted widespread praise from fans and critics. It was around this time when Rush decided against their usual post-tour break to continue momentum and produce a follow-up album, but wanted to record somewhere other than Toronto, Canada. Following what drummer and lyricist Neil Peart described as an &quot;extremely difficult&quot; search for a studio that suited the band, their longtime producer and engineer Terry Brown discovered Rockfield Studios in Monmouthshire, Wales. His enthusiasm at the idea of recording at the facility convinced the band to work there. Rush were keen to work in England as they were fans of British pop music, and the seclusion eliminated the distractions they usually faced at home. Peart felt the seclusion and mellow atmosphere at the studio created a productive environment, with the album put down in three weeks. Apart from early ideas for &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot;, the songs were put together at Rockfield.

&quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; marked a development in the group&#x27;s sound, with greater use of synthesizers and each member playing additional instruments. Peart said it was the result of the decision to put out &quot;All the World&#x27;s a Stage&quot;, which caused an extended creative hiatus that gave the band time &quot;to think about ourselves as musicians.&quot; In addition, Rush declared the release of the latter as &quot;the close of chapter one&quot; of their history, further suggesting a shift in the group&#x27;s approach. The trio had looked back on &quot;2112&quot; and felt their sound was too confined, so they decided to feature new and different instruments that they were comfortable enough with on their new material without bringing in a fourth member, which Peart said would have been &quot;the easy way out.&quot; Peart added orchestra and tubular bells, chimes, and other percussion to his drum kit; bassist and vocalist Geddy Lee added a Rickenbacker 4080 double neck bass and Minimoog; and guitarist Alex Lifeson plays new guitar models and a Moog Taurus bass pedal synthesizer, which Lee also used. Once recording finished, the album was mixed at Advision Studios in London. Lee was particularly excited at visiting the studio as it was where Yes and Emerson, Lake and Palmer had recorded hit albums. 

In 2017, Lee considered the album as a particularly important one in regard to his musical development. &quot;I learned a lot; I was learning a lot. I was always challenged and I was very stimulated and the result was &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot;, so I guess it was a pivotal record in that regard.&quot;

==Songs==
===Side one===

The album&#x27;s title track features an acoustic guitar introduction from Lifeson that was recorded outside the studio building as he walked around a stereo microphone, with Lee outside with him playing a Minimoog. Its title originated from an idea Peart had about a year prior to working on the album, until Lee and longtime Rush manager Ray Danniels pushed him to work the phrase into a complete lyric, and was subsequently used as the album&#x27;s title. Although Lee considered the track difficult to reproduce on stage it became a group favourite, as Peart wrote in the album&#x27;s tour book: &quot;It seems to encapsulate everything that we want Rush to represent.&quot;

The 11-minute &quot;Xanadu&quot; opens with a five-minute instrumental section that includes birds chirping that was also recorded outside the studio. It is a fantasy-inspired song that Peart described at the time as &quot;the most complex and multi-textured piece we have ever attempted&quot;. The opening line is taken from &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; by English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Initially Peart had an idea based on the 1941 drama film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; before he found Coleridge&#x27;s poem, the lines of which &quot;etched like a burning image in my head&quot;, although Lee had the film&#x27;s opening montage in mind when creating the soundscape in its introduction. Rush had performed the song during their debut UK tour. After playing an initial run-through of the track to gauge the balance and tone of the microphones in the recording room, the group performed it a second time once the equipment was set up, which was used on the album. On some later tours Lifeson and Lee played a double neck guitar and bass, respectively, when performing the song live in order to play the 6-string and 12-string parts, which became an iconic look for the band. The pair brought back the double necked guitars for their final R40 Live Tour.

===Side two===
&quot;Closer to the Heart&quot; was the first song that the band worked on for the album; it was also an early title for the album&#x27;s name. Lifeson picked the song as an example of Lee devising melodic bass lines on an acoustic guitar, such as the song&#x27;s opening riff, which caught his attention and asked Lee to teach it to him. It was the first Rush song in which Peart collaborated with someone on the lyrics; the title and first verse was written by Peter Talbot, a friend of the group who, in addition to being a writer, worked in the media. In regard to its meaning, Peart noted that as &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; deals with the idea of problems, &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot; addresses the solutions.

&quot;Cinderella Man&quot; is based on one of Lee&#x27;s favourite films, the 1936 romantic comedy drama &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot;, and the themes that it portrays. A self-described film buff, he had secret inspirations of being a film director and realised most of them &quot;have to be part megalomaniac, I think I sort of went off that idea.&quot; After writing the lyrics, with some assistance from Lifeson, Lee handed them to Peart who subsequently helped him &quot;clean it up a bit.&quot; &quot;Madrigal&quot; is a love ballad. The drums were recorded in an echo room.

The album closes with &quot;Cygnus X-1 Book I: The Voyage&quot;, a science-fiction song that tells the story of an unnamed explorer who travels to the centre of Cygnus X-1, a real black hole, in a spaceship named the Rocinante, believing there may be something beyond it. Upon approaching the centre the protagonist loses control of the ship and is drawn into it by the pull of gravity, its body destroyed. Peart was inspired by an article he had read in &quot;Time&quot; magazine about black holes and their origins, after which he researched on the topic further and wrote the lyrics. The Rocinante is named after the horse in the novel &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. Lee thought the science-fiction genre presented limitless musical ideas which inspired the band to &quot;use all your goofy, weird sounds because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening out in space.&quot; The words &quot;To be continued&quot; are written on the album liner notes, revealing the group&#x27;s decision to conclude the story on their next record, which became the 18-minute opener &quot;Cygnus X-1 Book II: Hemispheres&quot; on 1978&#x27;s &quot;Hemispheres&quot;.

==Artwork==
The cover artwork was produced by longtime Rush art director and graphic artist Hugh Syme, who started on the design before the band had left to tour England. He based it on an idea the group had described to him which covers the themes addressed on the title track. The front cover features a composite photograph of puppet-like king slumped on a throne in front of a demolished building, contrasted with the Toronto skyline in the background that depicts the city&#x27;s Harbour Castle Hotel. Syme was inspired to make a composite design from looking at covers produced by Hipgnosis, of which he was a particularly big fan. A resident of the Niagara region, Syme had spotted a &quot;beautiful, dilapidated&quot; building in ruins in nearby Buffalo, New York, and visited it with guitarist Josh Anderson, his bandmate in the Ian Thomas Band. The setting was used for the cover and Syme had Anderson pose as the puppet as his thin figure was ideal for the character. In post-production Syme altered the mouth, jaw, and eyes, and added the sky, smokestack and strings, plus a prosthetic to make the character appear more mechanical.

==Release==
&quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; was released on August 29, 1977 on Anthem Records, an independent label formed in May 1977 by Danniels and business partner Vic Wilson in order for Rush to have greater creative control over their product. The name was derived from the same-titled Ayn Rand novel and the track on the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Fly by Night&quot;. The albums were distributed across North America through Polydor Records. In the UK, Anthem distributor Phonogram prepared an extensive advertising campaign for the album to increase the band&#x27;s profile there.

In November 1977, &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; was one of three Rush albums to be certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling 500,000 copies. The others were &quot;2112&quot; and &quot;All the World&#x27;s a Stage&quot;, and were the band&#x27;s first albums to reach the certification. &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; also reached gold in the UK, signifying 100,000 copies sold.

== Reception and legacy ==
On release, &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote that &quot;this trio has abated its heavy metal thunder somewhat for a lavishly orchestrated extravaganza that has a rock opera feel to it&quot;.

AllMusic&#x27;s Greg Prato said that Rush &quot;had improved their songwriting and strengthened their focus and musical approach&quot;. He took notice of the synthesizers that were creeping into the arrangements, &quot;a direction the band would continue to pursue on future releases&quot;. He said &quot;Xanadu&quot; &quot;remains an outstanding accomplishment all these years later&quot;. 

Conversely, &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau gave the record a D grade, panning Rush as &quot;the most obnoxious band currently making a killing on the zonked teen circuit&quot;; he further compared them to bands such as Angel, Kansas, and Uriah Heep, &quot;with vocals revved up an octave. Or two.&quot;

In the &quot;Q&quot; &amp; &quot;Mojo&quot; 2005 Classic Special Edition &quot;Pink Floyd &amp; The Story of Prog Rock&quot;, the album came in sixth in a list of &quot;40 Cosmic Rock Albums&quot;. 

In 2021, American funk metal band Primus embarked on their &quot;A Tribute to Kings&quot; Tour. At each show, Primus played their original material in the first set before covering the entire &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; album in their second set. The first leg began August 10, 2021, in Boise, Idaho, and ended October 25 in Phoenix, Arizona. The second leg began April 15, 2022, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and was finished June 25, 2022, in Las Vegas, Nevada.

==Tour==
&quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; was supported with a tour of Canada, the US, and Europe between August 1977 and May 1978. The 140-date tour was particularly taxing on the group, who dubbed it the Drive &#x27;til You Die Tour. It was their most extensive tour since their formation, and marked the group headlining major venues for the first time and a growth in their international fanbase. Early into the tour, Rush performed a sold-out show at Toronto&#x27;s Exhibition Stadium that was attended by over 22,000 people. Tickets for a 16-date leg across the UK in February 1978, double the size of their first visit one year prior, quickly sold out. Excerpts from the 20 February 1978 concert was included in the &quot;Different Stages&quot; compilation, and released in full on the 40th anniversary box set of &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot;.

<text>The Corris Railway () is a narrow gauge railway based in Corris on the border between Merionethshire (now Gwynedd) and Montgomeryshire (now Powys) in Mid-Wales.

The line opened in 1859 as a horse tramway, running from quays on the River Dyfi at Morben and Derwenlas, through the town of Machynlleth and then following the Dulas Valley north to Corris and on to Aberllefenni. Branches served the slate quarries at Corris Uchaf, Aberllefenni, the isolated quarries around Ratgoed and quarries along the length of the Dulas Valley. In 1878, the railway was rebuilt and steam locomotives were introduced. It was taken over by the Great Western Railway in 1929 and closed in 1948.

A preservation society was formed in 1966, initially opening a museum at Corris. A short section of line between Corris and Maespoeth was re-opened to passengers in 2002. The railway now operates as a tourist attraction. Two new steam locomotives have been built for the railway, in 2005 and 2023. Two of the original locomotives and some of the original rolling stock are preserved on the nearby Talyllyn Railway.

The railway has the unusual gauge of which was shared by only three other public railways in the United Kingdom: the Talyllyn Railway and the short-lived Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway in Mid Wales, and the Campbeltown and Machrihanish Light Railway in Scotland.

== History ==
=== Commercial history ===
==== Precursor schemes: 1850 to 1858 ====
Before 1859, slate from the quarries at Corris, Corris Uchaf and Aberllefenni was hauled by horse-drawn carts and sledges to wharves on the banks of the River Dyfi. The first proposal to construct a railway connecting the quarries to the coast came in August 1850, when the owners of the Aberllefenni, Abercorris, Gaewern and Hengae quarries met with engineer Arthur Causton to propose the &quot;Abercorris and Aberdovey Railway&quot;. By November 1850, the name had changed to the &quot;Corris, Machynlleth &amp; River Dovey Railway or Tramroad&quot; which was planned to run down the Dulas Valley and then along the north shore of the Dyfi past Pennal to Pant Eidal, near the later main-line Gogarth Halt. A bill was submitted in early 1851, withdrawn, then resubmitted in December. The bill specified the tramroad&#x27;s gauge as ; due to the narrow gauge selected, the House of Lords committee imposed a restriction in the bill that forbade the use of locomotives.

This 1851 scheme was not constructed, and was followed by two further proposals in the early 1850s. Following the plans for a railway along the Dyfi valley, these early proposals were shelved.

In December 1857, a fourth bill was set before Parliament to create the &quot;Corris Machynlleth &amp; River Dovey Tramroad&quot; (CM&amp;RDT). This was similar to the 1851 scheme, except that it proposed to cross the Dyfi near Machynlleth and then follow the south bank of the river, and proposed a tramway from the &quot;machine house&quot; (i.e. the slate mill) at Aberllefenni, down to the wharf at &quot;Cae Goch on the River Dovey&quot; (Cae Goch was near to the later main line Glandyfi station). The gauge specified for the tramroad was increased to , and the same restriction forbidding locomotives was imposed. This bill was passed on 12 July 1858.

==== The Tramroad Era: 1858 to 1878 ====
After more than eight years of proposals, the 1859 scheme was the one that was built. Construction proceeded quickly, and by April 1859 the tramroad opened between Machynlleth and Corris. The section from Aberllefenni to Corris was built later that year. The section from Machynlleth to Morben was opened later. It is thought that the tramroad never extended beyond Morben.

On 3 January 1863, the standard gauge Newtown and Machynlleth Railway had opened, followed on 1 July of the same year by the Aberystwith and Welsh Coast Railway&#x27;s (A&amp;WCR) line from Machynlleth to Borth. These two lines became part of the Cambrian Railways by August 1865. The opening of the standard gauge line to Borth made the section of the CM&amp;RDT from Machynlleth to Morben obsolete. It was much easier to transship slates to the main line at Machynlleth and most of the lower section of the tramway was abandoned, probably in 1869.
In 1862, a new bill was deposited, seeking to extend the Upper Corris Tramway to iron ore mines at Tir Stent, near the pub at &quot;Cross Foxes&quot;. The bill also sought powers to raise further capital for the tramroad and allow the use of locomotives. But the directors of the A&amp;WCR objected and the bill failed. Another similar bill was deposited in December 1863, and again the A&amp;WCR opposed it. This time, however, they withdrew their objection; the CM&amp;RDT company had been acquired by Thomas Savin, who was the principal contractor in the construction of the tramroad, and Savin had offered to sell the company to the A&amp;WCR. The second bill passed on 25 July as the (27 &amp; 28 Vict. c. ccxxv); it formally converted the tramroad to a railway changing the company&#x27;s name to the &quot;Corris Railway Company&quot;, allowed the use of steam locomotives and allowed the abandonment of the section west of Ffynnon Garsiwn in Machynlleth.

In 1863, a new transshipment wharf was built at to allow slate to be loaded from CM&amp;RDT waggons into standard gauge wagons. Passenger and goods trains continued to run to Machynlleth Town station on the west side of Machynlleth, with some slate trains continuing to the wharfs at Morben.

It took until the 1870s for work to begin to upgrade the Corris Railway to a standard where locomotives could be used. The original tramroad was laid with light bridge rail suitable for waggons to traverse as they were pulled by horses. These rails would not support the weight of much heavier steam locomotives. Although the Corris Railway Act 1864 did not permit passengers to be carried, a timetabled passenger service was started in 1872. In 1874, a new goods warehouse and horse stable was built besides the transshipment wharves at Machynlleth, this was later converted to form the first passenger station here.

In 1878, control of the railway passed to the Imperial Tramways Company of London. The new owners ordered new passenger carriages for the railway. They also appointed Joseph R. Dix, son of the main-line stationmaster at Machynlleth, as Manager in succession to David Owen.

==== The Dix Years: 1879 to 1907 ====
In 1880 and 1883, two new acts were obtained which adjusted the tolls on the railway and permitted the carriage of passengers. The second of these acts was necessary because the owners of the quarries served by the railway objected that passenger trains would interfere with their mineral traffic. Initially the railway ran a test passenger service on the local roads; this proved to be so popular that they were able to pass the act of Parliament over the opposition of the quarry owners. It was also the first instance of a long history of the Corris Railway operating passenger road services in the area.

In December 1878 the first steam locomotive purchased from the Hughes Locomotive Company arrived. By February 1879 it had been joined by the other two that had been ordered and all three had begun work. Although the carriages arrived in 1878 it was not until 1883 that the act of Parliament was secured to allow the formal commencement of passenger services. A semi-official passenger service had been running since the early 1870s using adapted waggons to convey quarry workers and visitors.

The line was now in its settled form and began to operate a full service under Dix&#x27;s energetic management. The railway was widely promoted to visitors as the best route to Tal-y-llyn Lake and Cader Idris (ignoring the claims of the rival Talyllyn Railway). The initial passenger service ran from to , with new stations at and opening in 1884. The track was upgraded beyond Corris so that passenger services could reach the line&#x27;s northern terminus at , with services starting on 25 August 1887, and in the same year stations were also opened at and .
The railway developed a network of horse-hauled road services, including providing a link between Corris station and Abergynolwyn station on the Talyllyn Railway. This was promoted as part of a circular &quot;Grand Tour&quot; which took in the two narrow gauge railways and the Cambrian service between Tywyn and Machynlleth.

In 1892, control of Imperial Tramways moved to Bristol and George White of Bristol Tramways became chairman and Clifton Robinson became managing director. In the 1900s, Bristol motor buses were sent by the parent company to run the road services.

The closure of Braichgoch Quarry in 1906 brought the railway its first loss, and although the line continued on through subsequent decades, serving the quarries around Corris and Aberllefenni, it never again showed a profit. The bridge over the River Dyfi was rebuilt that year replacing the second timber viaduct with a steel bridge on slate piers.

==== Decline: 1907 to 1930 ====
Following a dispute with the directors, Dix was dismissed in June 1907, and replaced by John J O&#x27;Sullivan (formerly of the Cork, Blackrock and Passage Railway). A new station building at Machynlleth was completed towards the end of 1907. As well as slate and passengers, the line hauled timber extracted from the Dyfi forest in the 1910s through 1930s. There was also a constant traffic in coal and general goods to the quarries and communities served by the railway.

After World War I, the decline in slate traffic continued as cheaper foreign slate and alternative roofing materials became popular. O&#x27;Sullivan had died in office in 1917; the parent company&#x27;s Secretary, Frederick H Withers, acted as manager until a new manager, Daniel J McCourt (who had worked on Imperial&#x27;s Middlesbrough system until that was taken over by the local municipality) took over in 1921 and was responsible for developing and extending the connecting bus services as partial compensation for the decline in rail traffic.

==== Takeover and nationalisation: 1931 to 1948 ====
In late 1929, Imperial Tramways sold the Corris to the Great Western Railway (GWR), who by that time were the owners of the main line serving Machynlleth, whose primary interest was taking control of the railway&#x27;s bus routes. After running a bus in direct competition with the railway in 1930, the railway&#x27;s passenger service was withdrawn at the beginning of 1931. While the GWR did not relish owning another Welsh narrow gauge line, they did perform some track maintenance, and on at least two occasions the rolling stock was repainted.

On 1 January 1948, the line was nationalised along with its parent company, becoming part of British Railways (BR). While the GWR had tolerated the Corris, BR was looking for an excuse to close the loss making railway. In August 1948, that excuse came when the River Dyfi flooded. The waters began to undermine the Corris Railway embankment on the south side of the Dovey Bridge, and although the track was never breached, it was the excuse that BR needed to close the line. The last train ran on 20 August 1948 and the following day the railway was closed, without notice. The Aberllefenni to Corris section was lifted in November 1948, and 10 tons of the rail was purchased by Henry Haydn Jones for use on his Talyllyn Railway. By the end of 1950, track lifting had reached Machynlleth station.

In 1951, the Talyllyn Railway became the first railway in the world to be preserved. The Talyllyn purchased the two remaining locomotives, which had been stored out of use at Machynlleth, along with several goods waggons and the brake van – see &quot;List of Talyllyn Railway rolling stock&quot;. In 1958, the Talyllyn also purchased one of the Corris carriages, which had been in use as a summerhouse in a garden in Gobowen.

=== Preservation ===
==== Early days: 1966 to 1980 ====
In the early 1960s a group of volunteers from the Talyllyn Railway, led by Alan Meaden, began visiting Corris. They wanted to establish a museum for the line and formed The Corris Society in December 1966. Another group, the Corris Railway Preservation Society, was set up in the West Midlands around the same time. The two groups merged, forming the Corris Railway Society in 1968 with the aim of preserving what was left of the railway, opening a dedicated museum, and to explore reviving some or all of the line. Many of the founding members of the Society were volunteers on the Talyllyn.

Other than at Aberllefenni and Braichgoch quarries, no rails remained in situ along the Corris route. Initially the Society sought to purchase Machynlleth station for its museum, but when this proved impossible it turned its sights elsewhere. The main buildings of Corris station were demolished in 1968 leaving only the adjacent railway stable block standing, and these buildings – badly in need of maintenance – were acquired, along with a short section of trackbed leading southwards. In 1970 the first part of the building was opened as the Corris Railway Museum. A short length of &quot;demonstration&quot; track was laid in 1971.

During the 1970s, the Society undertook lengthy negotiations with the relevant authorities to establish the requirements for re-opening the line for passengers, while steadily building up funds and equipment In 1974, planning permission was received to re-open the line from Maespoeth Junction to Corris station. A new Corris Railway Company, reviving the original name, was incorporated to act as the Society&#x27;s trading and operating arm, while the Society achieved charitable status. The Museum was extended as more of the building was returned to satisfactory condition.

==== Restoring from Maespoeth: 1981 to 2001 ====
In 1981 the line&#x27;s original locomotive shed at Maespoeth was acquired and became the railway&#x27;s operational base. During the 1980s light track was laid between Maespoeth and Corris, a distance of just under a mile (1.6 km). The formal &quot;first train&quot; back to Corris ran on 24 April 1985. In the following years the track was upgraded to passenger standards while negotiations with the authorities continued.

==== Passenger services resume: 2002 to present ====
In the summer of 2002, passenger services resumed after a break of seventy-two years, initially diesel-hauled. The railway built a new steam locomotive, to a design based on the Kerr Stuart No. 4, which arrived on the railway on 17 May 2005 and runs as No. 7 (the Corris Railway never officially named its locomotives). No. 7 went into service on 20 August 2005, fifty-seven years to the day since the last train on the original railway, and now hauls the regular passenger service between Corris and Maespoeth.

The railway is also actively pursuing a southwards extension towards Machynlleth, with the initial aim of extending the line to Tan-y-Coed, midway between Esgairgeiliog and Llwyngwern and some 2 miles south of Corris. As always, this is involving lengthy negotiations with the authorities, not least due to the line south of Maespoeth running immediately adjacent to the A487 trunk road. While these are continuing the railway has consolidated its facilities at Maespoeth with the construction of a new two-road carriage shed in the adjacent field (the original carriage sheds at Corris and Machynlleth having been demolished). In 2015 work began on building the new diversion embankment to enable the southerly extension.

During 2009, the railway marked the 150th anniversary of the first train on the Corris with a series of events, including demonstration horse-worked freight trains and gravity runs of rakes of waggons.

The revived Corris Railway has maintained friendly links with the Talyllyn Railway, which resulted in both of the original Corris locos and rolling stock returning to the railway. In 1996 ex-Corris loco No. 4 returned to celebrate its 75th anniversary. In 2003, ex-Corris loco No. 3 returned on the occasion of its 125th anniversary with a heritage train of carriage No. 17, brake van No. 6 and two trucks. Corris No. 5 visited the Talyllyn Railway in 1983 and 1990, and No. 7 in October 2011. It hauled a few charter trains and played a part in the TR&#x27;s Corris Weekend, when it ran with the two surviving ex Corris engines; No. 4 (&quot;Edward Thomas&quot;) and No. 3 (&quot;Sir Haydn&quot;) and stock.

Both the surviving original locomotives have visited the Corris since its reopening. In 2012, No. 3 featured in a steam Gala over May Bank Holiday weekend along with the railway&#x27;s resident steam loco No. 7. No. 3&#x27;s boiler ticket expired on 17 May 2012 and the loco was on static display at Maespoeth until February 2013, when the loco left the Corris to tour heritage railways and museums in the UK to raise awareness of the Talyllyn and to raise funds for its overhaul.

== About the railway ==
The Corris Railway had several unusual features:

*The gauge is rare, shared by only three other public lines in the UK: the nearby Talyllyn Railway and Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway and the Campbeltown and Machrihanish Light Railway in Scotland. The Glyn Valley Tramway between Chirk and Pontfaen is being rebuilt to 2ft 3in to allow for stock transfer at gala events.
*Its origins as a horse tramroad and ascent through the narrow and winding Dulas valley meant it had exceptionally tight curves. Its original passenger carriages were simple 4-wheelers derived from urban horse-drawn tramway designs with end balconies; they rode poorly and were quickly rebuilt into longer bogie carriages by placing two of the original bodies end-to-end on a longer underframe.
*The stations were exceptionally narrow, again because of the geography of the line, and all were on the east side of the rails, so the carriages and locomotives had doors on that side only, as on the Talyllyn Railway.
*The vertical trestle waggons for carrying large slabs of slate from the quarries were also rarely found on other railways, notable exceptions being the Ffestiniog Railway and the nearby Hendre-Ddu Tramway.
*Corris Station and the original Machynlleth Station had overall roofs, features which were rare on a British narrow gauge railway. At Corris, the roof was over the main running line and trains for Aberllefenni passed under it; at Machynlleth the rear of the train rested under the station roof while the front was in the open air. The original Machynlleth station was demolished and replaced in 1907 with the building that still stands alongside the A487 trunk road north of the main-line railway overbridge. The track bed continued under the main-line railway overbridge alongside Heol Y Doll, through its own arch that is closed with stone blocks. Beyond the overbridge, a Texaco petrol station is sited on the former route.

== Route ==
=== Stations and halts ===
* Morben Cei (or Quay) Ward was the wharf on the River Dyfi that was the main transshipment point for the original tramroad. Closed in 1869. An extension of the line beyond Cei Ward was planned, but never built.
* Derwenlas at the Cei Tafarn Isa and Cei Ellis wharves on the River Dyfi . Closed in 1863 when the river wharves were cut off by the construction of the Aberystwith and Welsh Coast Railway.
* the original passenger and goods station, opened around 1860. Closed between 1874 and 1880, when it was replaced by the passenger station at .
* , from 1878 the southern passenger terminus serving the town of Machynlleth. This was the main slate transshipment point following the building of Cambrian Railways yard. The passenger station was an interchange with the Cambrian Railways station, and was rebuilt in 1904. At various times there were horse stables, a carriage shed and two signal boxes. The trackbed here is now covered by an industrial estate, but the station building survives.
* for Llanwrin village and the small hamlet of Fridd. The station was situated beside the railway&#x27;s Level crossing over the B4404 road.
* , an unofficial stopping point, in the Ffridd Woods.
* , an unofficial stopping point, slightly closer to Pantperthog village than Llwyngwern station.
* serving Pantperthog village and the &quot;Plas Llyn-gwern&quot; house, on the opposite side of the valley.
* , serving the Tan-y-Coed Natural Resources Wales picnic site. This station never existed on the original railway (neither did the picnic site), but is proposed as a major station and temporary terminus of the revived railway.
* serving Esgairgeiliog village - also known as Ceinws - on the opposite side of the Dulas River.
* signalled level crossing and unofficial stopping point.
* Maespoeth Junction the locomotive and carriage shed, with no passenger station before preservation. The site housed a signal box until the Second World War, which controlled the points for the junction with the Upper Corris Tramway and points in the yard. Maespoeth is the current southern terminus of the preserved railway.
* Corris, the railway&#x27;s primary northern station serving Corris village. As well as the station building, there was a stable, a parcel office, and a carriage shed. There was a signal box here until the Second World War, which controlled points in the yard. Corris station is the northern terminus of the preserved railway.
* , serving the hamlet of Garneddwen – a row of Aberllefenni quarry workers&#x27; housing. The trackbed here is now an access road for the hamlet.
* , the northern passenger terminus serving the village of Aberllefenni. A narrow station, perched on a steep slope. The site is now covered by a housing estate.

=== Branch lines and tramways ===
The Corris Railway had numerous branch lines, mainly built to serve the slate quarries along its route. The principal branches were:

* The Llwyngwern quarry tramway, at .
* The Era quarry tramway at .
* The Upper Corris Tramway from serving Braichgoch slate mine and quarries surrounding Corris Uchaf.
* The Matthew&#x27;s Mill Siding near serving the slate enamelling works known at different times as Y Magnus and Matthew&#x27;s mill.
* The Aberllefenni quarry tramway connecting the slate mill with three quarries.
* The Ratgoed Tramway north of serving Cymerau Quarry and Ratgoed Quarry.

Only the Aberllefenni Quarry tramway may have been locomotive worked, and in the 1960s and 1970s a tractor was used to haul waggons along it. The rest of these branches were operated by gravity and horses.

Other temporary branches were built to aid forestry works from the First World War until the 1930s.

=== Quarries served ===
The principal reason for the existence of the Corris Railway was to serve the slate quarries of this district. Although usually referred to as quarries, those on the Narrow Vein were usually underground mine workings, following the course of the vein, while those on the Broad Vein were more usually opencast quarries. The outliers in the south of the valley were also opencast. This list shows the main quarries that the railway served:

* Morben quarry - an early quarry that was connected to the CM&amp;RDT by an incline
* Ogo Fach Quarry - an early quarry connected to the CM&amp;RDT by a short tramway through a tunnel.
* Llwyngwern quarry – connected to by its own tramway
* Rhiw&#x27;r Gwreiddyn quarry – not directly connected, but slate was carted to and loaded onto Corris trains.
* Era quarry – connected to by its own tramway
* Abercorris quarry – connected to Maespoeth Junction by the Upper Corris Tramway
* Gaewern quarry – connected to the Upper Corris Tramway, subsequently worked together with Braichgoch.
* Braichgoch quarry – connected to the Upper Corris Tramway
* Abercwmeiddaw quarry – the main Broad Vein quarry in the Corris area. Connected to the Upper Corris Tramway.
* Aberllefenni quarries – connected via internal tramway at Aberllefenni
* Cambergi quarry – not directly connected, but output carried by cart to Aberllefenni
* Cymerau quarry – connected to the Ratgoed Tramway
* Ratgoed quarry – connected to the Ratgoed Tramway

The railway also served Y Magnus (Matthew&#x27;s Mill), a slate enamelling works situated between Aberllefenni and Garneddwen with its own tramway.

== Locomotives ==

=== Original railway ===
Three locomotives were supplied in 1878, and partially rebuilt between 1883 and 1900 from s to s. By the 1920s the locomotives were badly worn. A new locomotive, No. 4, was supplied in 1921. In 1923, parts from Nos. 1 and 3 were combined to produce one working locomotive, which carried the number 3. The remaining original locomotive, No 2, was held in reserve until 1928. A report dated 12 October 1929 stated that locomotives 1 and 2 had been &quot;marked off for some time as scrap&quot; and the remains of both engines were handed over to a local scrap merchant and excluded from the assets taken over by the GWR.

The locomotives that ran on the original Corris Railway between 1878 and 1948 (none carried names on the Corris) were:

=== Preserved railway ===
Locomotives brought to the restored Corris Railway since 1967 have been numbered in the original locomotive numbering series, from 5 onwards. They are:


=== Usage ===
, locomotives 7 and 10 are the only steam engines, and share passenger duties. Locomotive 11 is the main diesel motive power unit for both works trains and out of season passenger trains, supported by the lighter diesel locomotives 5 and 6, which are currently the main works and shunting units.

== Carriages ==

=== Historic ===
The CM&amp;RDT carried passengers from as early as 1860, despite this being explicitly prohibited by its authorising Act. Until 1874, passengers travelled in open waggons attached to the quarry trains. From October 1874, the railway ran separate, timetabled passenger trains. Around 1875, at least two wagons were converted to crude, almost windowless closed carriages.

In November 1878, ten four-wheel, tramcar-like carriages were delivered from the Falcon Works, Loughborough. They were numbered 1 to 10, with a brake van from the same source taking the number 11. The first bogie carriage, also from Falcon, which looked like two four-wheel bodies mounted on a single chassis, received number 12, and the four-wheelers were rebuilt over a five-year period on new chassis to form five bogie vehicles. A renumbering had the rebuilds as 1 to 5 and the former 12 becoming 6.

Two all-new carriages to a similar design were built by the Metropolitan Railway Carriage and Wagon Company Ltd and numbered 7 &amp; 8. Nos. 1 to 6 disappeared, presumed scrapped, after 1930; however Nos. 7 and 8 were used by a GWR employee at his home in Gobowen and subsequently preserved. No. 8 (used as a greenhouse-cum-garden shed) was recovered in 1958 and rebuilt for use on the Talyllyn Railway as their No.17 while No.7 (used as a chicken coop) was recovered ten years later and is on display in the Corris Railway Museum. The brake van was also preserved on the Talyllyn but has been substantially rebuilt after being damaged in a fire.

=== Current ===
As nineteen passenger vehicles (ten four-wheel carriages, eight bogie carriages and the brake van) ran on the original railway, the preservation Society has numbered its new build carriages from 20 onwards.

Carriage 7 is an original bogie carriage, but not available for service. It is on display in the railway museum at Corris.

Carriage 20 is similar in appearance to the bogie vehicles, but on a shorter, ex-National Coal Board four-wheel chassis. The southern compartment is fitted for the use of the train guard. It currently carries a plain un-lined livery but is due to be fully lined and lettered in due course.

Carriage 21 has been designed to appear as similar as possible to the original 19th Century bogie vehicles, but constructed to 21st Century safety standards with a steel chassis based on the Talyllyn Railway&#x27;s standard bogie carriage design and a steel skeleton with timber cladding for the body. Completed in May 2003, it has a plain roof.

Carriage 22 has been constructed to the same standards as outlined above. Completed in July 2015, it has a clerestory roof, similar to those carried by two original carriages in the 1920s. From the completion of fitting-out in September 2015 the railway was again able to run an authentic-looking &quot;1920s&quot; train with the &quot;Tattoo&quot; locomotive and two bogie carriages.

Carriage 23 is another plain roof example. Assembly of the woodwork for the body commenced in autumn 2015, with the panelling and beading completed by the end of 2017; painting and fitting of seats continued during the Coronavirus lockdown, and the completed carriage was mounted on its bogies and test run in July 2020; it entered passenger service in 2021; the final stage was the addition of gold lining and lettering (to match coaches 21 and 22), which was completed by Easter 2022.

Carriage 24 is currently under construction at Maespoeth. It will be a first class carriage, with a clerestory roof. The main frame was constructed, and the metal body frame added, before the Coronavirus pandemic, during which construction slowed. Construction resumed apace in 2021, and body panels (with beading) have been fitted.

<text>Benque Viejo del Carmen (&quot;Benque&quot;) is the westernmost town in Belize, by road west and south of Belize City, at the Guatemalan border. San Ignacio lies 13 km to the east and Melchor de Mencos just across the border. The Mopan River runs along the town&#x27;s north and west edges.

==Historical background==
Benque was first settled by Maya from Flores, El Petén, Guatemala. It grew as a lumber camp on the Mopan River that flowed into the Belize River, to the coast at Belize Town. The Mayas had been catechized by Spanish Catholic missionaries, leading to the predominance of the Catholic church in Benque, which holds the earliest Baptismal records in Cayo District from Jesuit Fr. Bavastro in May 1865. In 1877 the town was served by Manuel Ignacio Santa Cruz Loidi, a Basque priest and military leader in the unsuccessful effort to defeat the liberals in Spain&#x27;s Third Carlist War. During the 1880s Fr. Jose Maria Pinelo, a refugee from Petén during the presidency of Manuel Barillas, visited Benque, remaining from 1887 to 1889. In the 1890s the population was about 500. In 1904 a permanent Catholic residency was established by Jesuit Fr. William “Buck” Stanton. 

Then in 1913, at the persuasion of Jesuit Fr. Versavel, the Pallottine sisters came from Germany and served first in Benque. Mother (Saint) Katharine Drexel subsidized their convent from her inheritance. On the night of 16 November 1937 a fire destroyed the Church of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel and Fr. Kuenzel undertook to build the new church. In 1950, Kuenzel persuaded the Town Board to name the new football field after Corporal Marchalleck through whose &quot;self-sacrificing interest and persevering efforts [the] football campus came as if by magic out of what was hitherto useless tropical bush.&quot;. St. Joseph Convent on the street of that name was completed in 1952. On 18 January 1961 Fr. Sontag, Jesuit pastor in Benque, was found murdered at his desk in the rectory, with a machete the likely weapon. The perpetrator and motive remain a mystery. In 1963 a Catholic primary school building of reinforced concrete was built. The next year the Jesuits handed the parish over to the diocesan clergy, with Fr. Herbert Panton its first native pastor. The Catholic community SOLT increased its presence in Belize from the early 1990s, beginning in Benque. Deacon Cal Cathers of SOLT founded BRC printing in Benque to improve the quality of elementary school textbooks in Belize, with his grandson Daryl Rene Calvin Cathers to implement and encourage further development for humble town.

==Demographics==
At the time of the 2010 census, Benque Viejo del Carmen had a population of 6,148. Of these, 93.4% were Mestizo, 2.4% Mixed, 1.5% Creole, 0.7% Asian, 0.5% Garifuna, 0.4% Mennonite, 0.3% Caucasian, 0.3% Mopan Maya, 0.2% Yucatec Maya, 0.1% Ketchi Maya and 0.1% African.

During the first years of the 21st century Benque experienced a rapid boom in population. In 2010 its population, mostly of Maya or Mestizo descent, was 5,824 (2,906 males and 2,918 females); households numbered 1,415 with average size 4.1. 

In terms of languages spoken (multiple answers allowed), 97.0% spoke Spanish, 69.9% English, 7.4% Creole, 0.6% Mandarin or Cantonese, 0.5% Garifuna, 0.3% Yucatec Maya, 0.2% Ketchi Maya, 0.2% Mopan Maya, 0.1% German and 0.3% other languages; 0.1% could not speak.

Benque has long been the place where tourists and merchants cross to Melchor and purchase Maya textiles. Now Guatemalan youth cross the border each day to receive a secondary education in English. Benque offers primary and secondary education, supermarkets, an annual fiesta, and is home to a Belize Premier Football League team.

The ancient Maya ruins of Xunantunich are nearby. Film director Caleb Botton used the town as the backdrop for &quot;7 Days in Carmel&quot; which featured Benque&#x27;s Holy Week processions. 

As of May 2015, the mayor is Heraldo &quot;Rancha&quot; Ramcharan Jr. of the United Democratic Party, which also controls the town council.

<text>A tricycle, sometimes abbreviated to trike, is a human-powered (or gasoline or electric motor powered or assisted, or gravity powered) three-wheeled vehicle.

Some tricycles, such as cycle rickshaws (for passenger transport) and freight trikes, are used for commercial purposes, especially in the developing world, particularly Africa and Asia.

In the West, adult-sized tricycles are used primarily for recreation, shopping, and exercise. Tricycles are favoured by children, the disabled, and senior adults for their apparent stability versus a bicycle; however a conventional trike may exhibit poor dynamic lateral stability, and the rider should exercise appropriate operating caution when cornering (e.g., with regard to speed, rate of turn, slope of surface) and operating technique (e.g., leaning the body &#x27;into&#x27; the turn) to avoid tipping the trike over. Designs such as recumbents or others which place the rider lower relative to the wheel axles have a lower centre of gravity, and/or designs with canted wheels (tilted at the top towards the centerline) may be more resistant to lifting inner wheels or tipping during fast sharp turns, but still require operator awareness and technique.

==History==
A three-wheeled wheelchair was built in 1655 or 1680 by a disabled German man, Stephan Farffler, who wanted to be able to maintain his mobility. A watch-maker, Farffler created a vehicle that was powered by hand cranks.

In 1789, two French inventors developed a three-wheeled vehicle, powered by pedals; they called it the tricycle.

In 1818, British inventor Denis Johnson patented his approach to designing tricycles. In 1876, James Starley developed the Coventry Lever Tricycle, which used two small wheels on the right side and a large drive wheel on the left side; power was supplied by hand levers. In 1877, Starley developed a new vehicle he called the Coventry Rotary, which was &quot;one of the first rotary chain drive tricycles.&quot; Starley&#x27;s inventions started a tricycling craze in Britain; by 1879, there were &quot;twenty types of tricycles and multi-wheel cycles ... produced in Coventry, England, and by 1884, there were over 120 different models produced by 20 manufacturers.&quot; The first front steering tricycle was manufactured in 1881 by The Leicester Safety Tricycle Company of Leicester, England, which was brought to the market in 1882 costing £18 (). They also developed a folding tricycle at the same time.

Tricycles were used by riders who did not feel comfortable on the high wheelers, such as women who wore long, flowing dresses (see rational dress).

In September, 1903 Edmund Payne, the popular comedian, started an attempt to beat the twenty-four hours&#x27; unpaced Tricycle record. At 100 miles Payne was inside his schedule time, but shortly afterwards had to desist at Wisbech, having encountered five hours of incessant rain.

==Associations==
In the UK, upright tricycles are sometimes referred to as &quot;barrows&quot;. Many trike enthusiasts in the UK belong to the Tricycle Association, formed in 1929. They participate in day rides, tours, time trials, and a criterium (massed start racing) series.

==Wheel configurations==

===Delta===

A delta tricycle has one front wheel and two rear wheels.

===Tadpole===
A tadpole tricycle has two front wheels and one rear wheel. Rear wheel steering is sometimes used, although this increases the turning circle and can affect handling (the geometry is similar to a regular tricycle operating in reverse, but with a steering damper added).

===Other===
Some early pedal tricycles from the late 19th century used two wheels in tandem on one side and a larger driving wheel on the other.

An in-line three-wheeled vehicle has two steered wheels, one at the front and the other in the middle or at the rear.

==Types==
===Upright===
Upright trikes resemble a two-wheeled bicycle, traditionally diamond frame, or open frame, but with either two widely spaced wheels at the back (called &quot;delta&quot;) or two wheels at the front (called &quot;tadpole&quot;). The rider straddles the frame in both delta and tadpole configurations. Steering is through a handlebar directly connected to the front wheel via a conventional bicycle fork in delta, or via a form of Ackermann steering geometry in the case of the upright tadpole.

All non-tilting trikes have stability issues and great care must be used when riding a non-tilting upright trike. The center of gravity is quite high compared to recumbent trikes. Because of this, non-tilting trikes are more prone to tipping over in corners and on uneven or sloping terrain. Conversely, the rider enjoys better visibility than on a recumbent because their head is higher.

===Recumbent===

Recumbent trikes&#x27; advantages (over conventional trikes) include stability (through low centre of gravity) and low aerodynamic drag. Disadvantages (compared to bicycles) include greater cost, weight, and width. The very low seat may make entry difficult, and on the road they may be less visible to other traffic.

====Delta====

A recumbent delta is similar to an upright, with two wheels at the back and one at the front, but has a recumbent layout in which the rider is seated in a chair-like seat. One or both rear wheels can be driven, while the front is used for steering (the usual layout). Steering is either through a linkage, with the handlebars under the seat (under seat steering) or directly to the front wheel with a large handlebar (over seat steering). Some delta trikes can be stored upright by lifting the front wheel and resting the top of the seat on the ground.

Delta trikes generally have higher seats and a tighter turning radius than tadpole trikes. The tight turning radius is useful if riding on trails with offset barriers, or navigating around closely placed obstacles. The higher seat makes mounting and dismounting easier. Even with the higher seat a delta trike can be quite stable provided most of the weight (including the rider) is shifted back towards the rear wheels. Many delta trikes place the seat too far forward and that takes weight off the two rear wheels and puts more weight onto the front wheel making the trike more unstable. The Hase Kettwiesel delta trike has an high seat that is placed to put most of the weight onto the cambered rear wheels making it more stable.
Delta trikes are suitable to be used as manual scooters for mobility, rehabilitation and/or exercise. The Hase Lepus Comfort is an example of a rehabilitation delta trike designed mainly for comfort and ease of use. It has a lowered front boom and the seat can be adjusted to a height of , which aids in mounting and dismounting. It also has rear wheel suspension for comfort. The Lepus can be folded for easier storage and transportation.

The weight of a delta trike can be quite close to the weight of a tadpole trike if they are both of a similar quality and similar materials are used. The Hase Kettwiesel Allround delta trike has an aluminium frame and weighs 39.4 lbs (17.9 kg). The Catrike Road tadpole trike has an aluminium frame and weighs 37.5 lbs (17 kg).

====Tadpole====

The recumbent tadpole or reverse trike is a recumbent design with two steered wheels at the front and one driven wheel at the back, though one model has the front wheels driven while the rear wheel steers. Steering is either through a single handlebar linked with tie rods to the front wheels&#x27; stub axle assemblies (indirect) or with two handlebars (rather, two half-handlebars) each bolted to a steerer tube, usually through a bicycle-type headset and connected to a stub axle assembly (direct). A single tie rod connects the left and right axle assemblies.

The tadpole trike is often used by middle-aged or retiree-age former bicyclists who are tired of the associated pains from normal upright bikes. With its extremely low center of gravity, aerodynamic layout and light weight (for trikes), tadpoles are considered the highest performance trikes.

Most velomobiles are built in a tadpole trike configuration since a wide front and narrow rear offer superior aerodynamics to a delta trike configuration.

====Hand-crank====

Hand-crank trikes use a hand-operated crank, either as a sole source of power or a double drive with footpower from pedals and hand-power from the hand crank. The hand-power only trikes can be used by individuals who do not have the use of their legs due to a disability or an injury. They are made by companies including Greenspeed, Invacare, Quickie and Druzin.

In case of paralysis of the legs, more speed and range of distance can be obtained by adding functional electrical stimulation to the legs. The large leg muscles are activated by electrical impulses synchronized with the hand cranking movement.

====Tandem====
Recumbent tandem trikes allow two people to ride in a recumbent position with an extra-strong backbone frame to hold the extra weight. Some allow the &quot;captain&quot; (the rider who steers) and &quot;stoker&quot; (the rider who only pedals) to pedal at different speeds. They are often made with couplers so the frames can be broken down into pieces for easier transport. Manufacturers of recumbent trikes include Greenspeed, WhizWheelz and Inspired Cycle Engineering.

===Rickshaw===


Most cycle rickshaws, used for carrying passengers for hire, are tricycles with one steering wheel in the front and two wheels in the back supporting a seating area for one or two passengers. Cycle rickshaws often have a parasol or canopy to protect the passengers from sun and rain. These vehicles are widely used in South Asia and Southeast Asia, where rickshaw driving provides essential employment for recent immigrants from rural areas, generally impoverished men. In the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, rickshaws became increasingly popular in big cities in Britain, Europe and the United States, where they provide urban transportation, novelty rides, and serve as advertising media.
Spidertrike is a recumbent cycle rickshaw that is used in central London and operated by Eco Chariots. The trike pictured is called the SUV (Sensible Utility Vehicle) and is produced by the company Organic Engines, which operates in Florida in the United States. It is a front wheel drive tricycle, articulated behind the driver seat, and has hydraulic double disc brakes and internal hub gears. The passenger is protected from rain and sun with a canopy.

===Freight===


Urban delivery trikes are designed and constructed for transporting large loads. These trikes include a cargo area consisting of a steel tube carrier, an open or enclosed box, a flat platform, or a large, heavy-duty wire basket. These are usually mounted over one or both wheels, low behind the front wheel, or between parallel wheels at either the front or rear of the vehicle, to keep the center of gravity low. The frame and drivetrain must be constructed to handle loads several times that of an ordinary bicycle; as such, extra low gears may be added. Other specific design considerations include operator visibility and load suspension. Many, but not all, cycles used for the purpose of vending goods such as ice cream cart trikes or hot dog vending trikes are cargo bicycles.

Many freight trikes are of the tadpole configuration, with the cargo box (platform, etc.) mounted between the front wheels. India and China are significant strongholds of the rear-loading &quot;delta&quot; carrier trike. Freight trikes are also designed for indoor use in large warehouses or industrial plants. The advantage of using freight trikes rather than a motor vehicle is that there is no exhaust, which means that the trike can be used inside warehouses. While another option is electric golf cart-style vehicles, freight trikes are human-powered, so they do not have the maintenance required to keep batteries on golf carts charged up.

Common uses include:
*Delivery services in dense urban environments
*Food vending in high foot traffic areas (including specialist ice cream bikes)
*Transporting trade tools, including around large installations such as power stations and CERN
*Airport cargo handling
*Recycling collections
*Warehouse inventory transportation
*Mail
*Food collection
*Child transport (in Amsterdam, freight trikes are used primarily to carry children)

===Children&#x27;s===
A tricycle is a typical toy for children between the ages of eighteen months and five years before a balance bike. Compared to adult models, children&#x27;s trikes are simpler, without brakes or gears, and often with crude front-drive. Child trikes can be unstable, particularly if the wheelbase or track are insufficient. Some trikes have a push bar so adults can control the trike. Child trikes have frames made of metal, plastic, or wood.

Children&#x27;s trikes can have pedals directly driving the front wheels, allowing braking with the pedals, or they can use chain drive the rear wheels, often without a differential, so one rear wheel spins free. Children&#x27;s trikes do not always have pneumatic tires, having instead wheels of solid rubber or hollow plastic. While this may add to the weight of the tricycle and reduces the shock-absorbing qualities, it eliminates the possibility of punctures. Pull brakes are rarely fitted to front-drive trikes, but the child can slow the trike down by resisting the forward motion through the pedals.

===Drift===
Drift trikes are a variety of tricycle with slick rear wheels, enabling them to drift, being countersteered round corners. They are commonly used for gravity-powered descents of paved roads with steep gradients.

===Hand and foot===

With hand and foot trikes, the rider makes a pair of front wheels change directions by shifting the center of weight and moves forward by rotating the rear wheel. The hand and foot trike can be also converted into a manual tricycle designed to be driven with both hands and both feet. There are also new hybrids between a handcycle, a recumbent bike and a tricycle, these bikes make it even possible to cycle with legs despite a spinal cord injury.

===Tilting===

Tricycles have been constructed that tilt in the direction of a turn, as a bicycle does, to avoid rolling over without a wide axle track. Examples have included upright, recumbent, delta, and tadpole configurations.

==Conversion sets==
Tricycle conversion sets or kits convert a bicycle to an upright tricycle. Tricycle kit can remove the front wheel and mounts two wheels under the handlebars for a quick and easy conversion.

The advantages of a trike conversion set include lower cost compared with new hand built tricycles and the freedom to choose almost any donor bicycle frame. Tricycle conversion sets tend to be heavier than a high quality, hand built, sports, touring or racing tricycle. Conversion sets can give the would-be serious tricyclist a taste of triking before making the final decision to purchase a complete tricycle. Conversion sets can also supplied ready to be brazed onto a lightweight, steel bicycle frame to form a complete trike.

Some trike conversion sets can also be used with recumbent bicycles to form recumbent trikes.

==Operation==
Adults may find upright tricycles difficult to ride because of familiarity with the counter-steering required to balance a bicycle. The variation in the camber of the road is the principal difficulty to be overcome once basic tricycle handling is mastered. Recumbent trikes are less affected by camber and, depending on track width and riding position, capable of very fast cornering. Some trikes are tilting three-wheelers, which lean into corners much as bicycles do.

In the case of delta tricycles, the drive is often to just one of the rear wheels, though in some cases both wheels are driven through a differential. A double freewheel, preferably using no-backlash roller clutches, is considered superior. Trikes with a differential often use an internally geared hub as a gearbox in a &#x27;mid drive&#x27; system. A jackshaft drive permits either single or two-wheel drive. Tadpoles generally use a bicycle&#x27;s rear wheel drive and for that reason are usually lighter, cheaper and easier to replace and repair.

===Braking===
Some trikes use a geometry (also called center point steering) with the kingpin axis intersecting the ground directly ahead of the tire contact point, producing a normal amount of trail. This arrangement, elsewhere called &quot;zero scrub radius&quot; is used to mitigate the effects of one-sided braking on steering. While zero scrub can reduce steering feel and increase wandering it can also protect novices from spinning out and/or flipping.
Tadpole trikes tend also to use Ackermann steering geometry, perhaps with both front brakes operated by the stronger hand. While the KMX Kart stunt trike with this setup allows the rear brake to be operated separately, letting the rider do &quot;bootlegger turns&quot;, the standard setup for most trikes has the front brake for each side operated by each hand. The center-of-mass of most tadpole trikes is close to the front wheels, making the rear brake less useful. The rear brake may instead be connected to a latching brake lever for use as a parking brake when stopped on a hill.

Recumbent trikes often brake one wheel with each hand, allowing the rider to brake one side alone to pull the trike in that direction.

== Records ==
On 1 July 2005, Sudhakar Yadav from India rode a tricycle in Hyderabad with a height of , a wheel diameter of and length of . This tricycle is exhibited at the Sudha Cars Museum and has been verified as the largest tricycle by the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;.

<doc id="172763" wikidata="Q1174644" url="?curid=172763" title="Nroff">
<text>nroff (short for &quot;new roff&quot;) is a text-formatting program on Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It produces output suitable for simple fixed-width printers and terminal windows. It is an integral part of the Unix help system, being used to format man pages for display.

nroff and the related troff were both developed from the original roff. While nroff was intended to produce output on terminals and line printers, troff was intended to produce output on typesetting systems. Both used the same underlying markup and a single source file could normally be used by nroff or troff without change.

==History==
nroff was written by Joe Ossanna for Version 2 Unix, in Assembly language and then ported to C.

It was a descendant of the RUNOFF program from CTSS, the first computerized text-formatting program, and is a predecessor of the Unix troff document processing system.

There is also a free software version of nroff in the groff package.

==Variants==
The Minix operating system, among others, uses a clone of nroff called cawf by Vic Abell, based on awf, the Amazingly Workable Formatter designed in awk by Henry Spencer. These are not full replacements for the nroff/troff suite of tools, but are sufficient for display and printing of basic documents and manual pages.

In addition, a simplified version of nroff is available in Ratfor source code form as an example in the book &quot;Software Tools&quot; by Brian Kernighan and P. J. Plauger.

<doc id="172764" wikidata="Q648932" url="?curid=172764" title="Talyllyn Railway">
<text>The Talyllyn Railway () is a narrow-gauge railway in Wales running for from Tywyn on the Mid-Wales coast to Nant Gwernol near the village of Abergynolwyn. The line was opened in 1865 to carry slate from the quarries at Bryn Eglwys to Tywyn, and was the first narrow gauge railway in Britain authorised by Act of Parliament to carry passengers using steam haulage. Despite severe underinvestment, the line remained open, and in 1951 it became the first railway in the world to be preserved as a heritage railway by volunteers.

Since preservation, the railway has operated as a tourist attraction, expanding its rolling stock through acquisition and an engineering programme to build new locomotives and carriages. In 1976, an extension was opened along the former mineral line from Abergynolwyn to the new station at Nant Gwernol. In 2005 a major rebuilding and extension of Tywyn Wharf station took place, including a much-expanded facility for the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum, and in 2021 the railway was designated a World Heritage Site as part of the slate landscape of north-west Wales.

The fictional Skarloey Railway, which formed part of &quot;The Railway Series&quot; of children&#x27;s books by the Rev. Wilbert Awdry, was based on the Talyllyn Railway. The preservation of the line inspired the Ealing Comedy film &quot;The Titfield Thunderbolt&quot;.

==Name==
The origin of the railway&#x27;s name is uncertain: it may refer to the parish of Tal-y-llyn, which contains its eastern terminus, or it may come from Tal-y-llyn, a large glacial ribbon lake at the foot of Cadair Idris further east.

==Gauge==
The gauge of the track is unusual, and was shared by only three other public railways in the United Kingdom: the Corris Railway and the Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway both a few miles from the Talyllyn, and the Campbeltown and Machrihanish Light Railway in Scotland.

==History==
===Commercial history===
====Origins and construction: up to 1866====
Slate quarrying began in the hills above Tywyn in the 1830s, but although many small quarries and test levels were established, only one major quarry was developed in the region, the Bryn Eglwys quarry, north east of the town. Underground working began in the early 1840s, and by 1847 the quarry was being worked by local landowner John Pughe. The finished slates were sent by packhorse to the wharf at Pennal, transferred to boats for a river trip to Aberdyfi (also spelled as &quot;Aberdovey&quot;), and then finally loaded into seagoing vessels, a complex and expensive transportation arrangement which limited the quarry&#x27;s output. In 1861 the outbreak of the American Civil War cut off supplies of cotton to the mills of the north west of England and as a result a number of prosperous mill owners looked for new business opportunities to diversify their interests. One such owner was William McConnel of Lancashire who, in 1859, had purchased Hengwrt Hall near Dolgellau, north of Tywyn. In January 1864, McConnel formed the Aberdovey Slate Company, which leased the land including Bryn Eglwys from the landowner, Lewis Morris of Machynlleth.

McConnel set about improving Bryn Eglwys to increase its output. He focused on providing rail transport for the isolated quarry, and in April 1864 he reached agreement with local landowners to purchase the land necessary to build a railway towards Tywyn and onwards to the port of Aberdyfi. Construction was well underway by July 1864. The standard gauge Aberystwith and Welsh Coast Railway was expanding rapidly from its base at Machynlleth, however, and in 1863 had reached Tywyn, so McConnel decided to build his line from the quarry to Tywyn, as the nearest point where slate could be transferred to the standard gauge railway. This was despite the line&#x27;s initial isolation from the rest of the system because of difficulties in bridging the estuary of the Afon Dyfi to the south. An act of Parliament, the (28 &amp; 29 Vict. c. cccxv) allowing the company to operate passenger trains as a public railway was given royal assent on 5 July 1865, and the company appointed James Swinton Spooner as engineer for the construction. He laid out plans for a relatively straight line climbing steadily from Tywyn to the quarry and work quickly got underway. By September 1866 construction had advanced to the point where the Board of Trade inspector Captain Henry Tyler could make an initial inspection and report.

Tyler&#x27;s report led to an unusual alteration, as it was discovered that the internal width of the overbridges was only , but the railway&#x27;s passenger carriages were wide, leaving only clearance on either side, which was less than the minimum required clearance of . To alleviate this problem, McConnel proposed that the doors on one side of each carriage be permanently barred and the track slewed off-centre beneath the bridges to allow adequate clearance at least on the side with doors, which would allow passengers to get out of the carriages if the train stopped underneath a bridge. Tyler agreed to this arrangement, and to this day all carriages on the Talyllyn have doors on one side only, an unusual feature for a public railway which is shared (albeit for different reasons) with the neighbouring Corris Railway. Tyler also required that improvements be made to the railway&#x27;s first two steam locomotives, as locomotive No. 1 suffered from excessive &quot;vertical motion&quot; and No. 2 was said to suffer from &quot;horizontal oscillation&quot;. No. 1 was returned to its manufacturer where a set of trailing wheels was added to reduce the rear overhang, and the springs on No. 2 were adjusted and the crank pins shortened to reduce its oscillation.

Tyler did not approve the opening until his listed improvements were completed, although slate trains and unofficial passenger trains were running in 1865. During November of that 1866, Tyler returned to Tywyn and re-inspected the railway following which, subject to some further minor improvements, he approved its formal opening for passenger service. The first public passenger timetable was issued in December 1866, and the first purpose-built, steam-worked, narrow gauge public railway in Britain opened for service.

====Prosperity under McConnel: 1866–1880s====
The railway opened with two locomotives, one carriage and several goods vehicles in use and was operated under a &quot;one engine in steam&quot; policy to ensure that two trains could not collide. Initially the working locomotive was housed in a wooden shed at Ty Dwr on the mineral line above Abergynolwyn station, while the main engineering works at were constructed. The Pendre works opened on 17 February 1867 and from then on trains began working from Pendre instead of Abergynolwyn.

At the time of the line&#x27;s opening, stations were provided at Pendre and Abergynolwyn. In 1867, the halt at opened, followed by later that year and in 1872. Some time shortly after the opening of the railway a branch to Abergynolwyn village was provided. A steep incline dropped from the mineral line east of Abergynolwyn station to the village below, where a series of tram lines radiated. Coal, building materials and general goods were delivered down the incline and the contents of the village cesspits were hauled back up for disposal along the lineside.

The railway used steam locomotives from the start, unlike its neighbour the horse-drawn Corris Railway. The original two locomotives, although of entirely different design, were both purchased from Fletcher, Jennings &amp; Co. of Whitehaven in Cumbria, and both are still in service, 150 years on, although so many of their parts have been replaced down the years that much of their present-day component metal is not original. The Talyllyn&#x27;s rare gauge is thought to have been adopted to match that of the Corris Railway, and the line&#x27;s two original steam locomotives were among the earliest locomotives built for such a narrow gauge. No. 1 &quot;Talyllyn&quot; is an and No. 2 &quot;Dolgoch&quot; is an . The line carried slate from the quarry to the wharf at Tywyn and general goods along its length. Public passenger trains initially ran between Abergynolwyn, Dolgoch and Pendre stations only; quarrymen were carried on unofficial trains that continued on from Abergynolwyn to the foot of the Alltwyllt incline in Nant Gwernol gorge.

The line operated successfully during its early years, serving the quarry and the local district. By 1880, Bryn Eglwys employed 300 workers and was producing of finished slate per year, all shipped via the railway. Passenger traffic was substantial, rising from 11,500 passengers carried in 1867 to over 23,000 (roughly equivalent to 40,000 passenger journeys) in 1877.

====Declining fortunes: 1880s–1910====
In 1879, McConnel bought out the other shareholders of the Aberdovey Slate Company, and became the sole owner of the railway, the quarry and much of Abergynolwyn village.

From the 1880s onwards the &quot;Grand Tour&quot; was a popular option with tourists. This used charabancs to link the Talyllyn and Corris railways via Tal-y-llyn Lake and Cadair Idris, returning on Cambrian Railways trains. The last two decades of the 19th century saw a decline in the demand for slate and many smaller quarries fell on hard times, including Bryn Eglwys, where by 1890 production had halved to a year. In 1896, production at the Penrhyn Quarry in north Wales, one of the largest producers of slate, was stopped due to labour disputes, resulting in a temporary increase in demand at other quarries. McConnel expanded production at Bryn Eglwys to take advantage of the sudden demand, but only with the aim of maximising profits during the remainder of his lease, which was to expire in 1910. He built new trial levels without proper provision for the removal of overburden and pushed the limits of safe working in the existing chambers. As McConnel&#x27;s lease drew to its close, there was no prospect of a further lessee coming forward and work began on dismantling the quarry&#x27;s equipment.

====Haydn Jones era: 1911–1950====
The Bryn Eglwys quarry was the primary employer in the Abergynolwyn district, so its closure caused significant distress. In 1910, local landowner Henry Haydn Jones was elected the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Merioneth. He understood the importance of Bryn Eglwys, and at the end of the year he purchased the quarry company for just over £5000. The quarry re-opened in January 1911, though Haydn Jones did not have capital to invest in the quarry. The first workings reopened were on the Broad Vein, which yielded relatively hard slate that was less popular and therefore difficult to sell. The lack of an available market for this output forced the quarry to switch to extracting softer slate from the Narrow Vein but, because Haydn Jones could not afford to open new workings into the Narrow Vein, he resorted to the dangerous practice of narrowing the columns that supported the roofs of the underground chambers. This practice had begun under McConnel&#x27;s ownership and Haydn Jones continued it throughout his ownership of the quarry. A brief construction boom after the First World War saw production return to around per year.

The 1920s also saw an upsurge in holiday traffic, as Britain recovered from the war and tourism gained in popularity. The Talyllyn saw summer passenger numbers grow significantly and regularly had to supplement its formal passenger stock with slate wagons fitted with planks as seats. An unusual tourist service offered by the railway was to hire a slate wagon, which would be left at Abergynolwyn. At the end of the day the tourists would return to Tywyn in the wagon, powered by gravity. This service was discontinued in the early 1930s. The additional income from the tourist trade defrayed some of the costs of operating the railway, but never enough for it to make a profit during Haydn Jones&#x27; ownership.

The lease on Bryn Eglwys expired in 1942, but was extended on an annual basis. The October 1942 Bradshaw&#x27;s Guide shows two return passenger trains operating only on Monday, Wednesday and Fridays, taking 45 minutes in each direction. No passenger service was provided on other days. Overnight on 26 December 1946, several weakened support columns in the quarry gave way, resulting in a significant collapse; the quarry was deemed unsafe and closed immediately. Haydn Jones had promised to continue operating the railway as long as he was alive and so, despite the closure of the quarry, the railway continued to run trains on a shoestring budget. In 1947 the British railway system was nationalised and the Talyllyn was one of the few operating railways not included. The reasons for this are unclear, but it is significant that all official mention of the railway had ceased several decades before and it is likely that the line was simply forgotten by officialdom. Between 1947 and 1949 the railway ran a passenger service two days a week. In 1949 Haydn Jones, who owned the Aberllefenni Slate Quarry purchased 10 tons of rail from the recently lifted Corris Railway. On 2 July 1950 Haydn Jones died and closure of the railway seemed inevitable, but the line continued to operate for the remainder of the summer season, ending on 6 October.
===Preservation===
====Rescue: 1951–1960====

The author and biographer Tom Rolt visited the line in 1949, along with the locomotive engineer David Curwen. In the summer of 1950, Rolt wrote a letter to the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot; newspaper suggesting that a rescue of the Talyllyn be undertaken. He received sufficient positive response for a meeting of interested enthusiasts to be held on 11 October 1950 at the Imperial Hotel in Birmingham. Around 70 people, including Patrick Whitehouse, attended the meeting, with Rolt proposing the formation of a committee to look into the acquisition of the railway. With the support of the meeting, the committee – with Rolt as chairman and Whitehouse as Secretary – met for the first time on 23 October and immediately entered into negotiation with Haydn Jones&#x27; executors.

The transfer of ownership to the committee was legally complex, but both parties agreed that all shares in the railway company would be transferred from Haydn Jones&#x27; estate to a new company called Talyllyn Holdings Ltd., whose board consisted of two directors from the executors and two from the committee. The transfer took place on 8 February 1951, at which point the newly formed Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society effectively took control of the railway. The Society immediately began to publicise its efforts, hoping to raise funds and find further volunteers to help reopen the railway, and by May nearly 650 members had joined the society. The railway re-opened under the control of the Society for the first time on the Whit Monday bank holiday, 14 May 1951, with trains running between Wharf and Rhydyronen stations. Regular trains began to run on 4 June and continued through the summer, with David Curwen acting as the first Chief Mechanical Engineer. One of the volunteers who worked on the railway that month was Vic Mitchell.

In the early years of preservation, the line struggled to operate using the original rolling stock. When the line was taken over in 1950 &quot;Dolgoch&quot; was the only operating locomotive and it was apparent that it was in need of a major overhaul. To enable operations to continue, two further steam locomotives, Nos. 3 and 4, were purchased from the recently closed Corris Railway in 1951 and named &quot;Sir Haydn&quot; and &quot;Edward Thomas&quot; respectively. Because both railways were built to the unusual gauge of it was relatively easy to adapt the Corris locomotives to work on the Talyllyn. No. 3 became the first new locomotive to travel on the railway for over 80 years in 1951, but it frequently derailed, and on inspection it turned out that the Talyllyn track was laid approximately half an inch (13 mm) wider than the official gauge, a deliberate policy by the old company to accommodate the long wheelbase of &quot;Talyllyn&quot;. Both &quot;Talyllyn&quot; and &quot;Dolgoch&quot; had unusually wide wheel treads that allowed them to stay on the wide-of-gauge track. This problem was eventually cured by relaying the railway to its correct gauge and altering &quot;Talyllyn&quot;″s trailing wheels to allow them to swivel horizontally, shortening the locomotive&#x27;s fixed wheelbase. No. 4 was unserviceable when it arrived, but John Alcock, the chairman of the Hunslet Engine Company, was a member of the Preservation Society and had No. 4 overhauled free of charge at his works. No. 4 then began service on the railway in 1952 and worked the majority of the trains that season.

Another early addition to the locomotive fleet was No. 6 &quot;Douglas&quot;, donated to the society by the Birmingham engineering firm Abelsons Ltd. This locomotive was built for the depot railway serving RAF Calshot where it worked until 1945, and, after rebuilding from its original gauge, it entered service in 1954. Through the 1950s the volunteers and staff members of the TRPS rebuilt the line and rescued it from its state of decay, during a period characterised by a &quot;&quot;Boy&#x27;s Own&quot; comic spirit of adventure, involving enthusiasm, ingenuity and a fair degree of irresponsibility&quot;.

On 22 May 1957 the BBC produced a live outside broadcast from the railway, during which Wynford Vaughan Thomas and Huw Weldon commentated on a trip from Dolgoch to Abergynolwyn. The publicity from this broadcast drew substantial numbers of visitors to the railway that summer, with more than 57,500 passengers carried, and this increase in revenue in turn enabled the railway to continue to improve its infrastructure and provide tourists with a better experience. The following year locomotive No. 1 &quot;Talyllyn&quot; returned to steam after an extensive overhaul.
An important development during this period was the establishment of the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum at Tywyn Wharf station. The first exhibit for what was to become the museum was a locomotive donated in 1952 by Guinness from their recently closed St. James&#x27;s Gate Brewery railway. In 1954 the Preservation Society agreed to start work on a formal museum, and exhibits from around the United Kingdom were acquired to form the nucleus of the collection. In 1955 work started on converting the old gunpowder store at Wharf station into a temporary museum building, and in 1956 the first exhibit arrived at Tywyn.

====Securing the infrastructure: 1960–1969====
The 1960s proved to be a decade of consolidation for the Talyllyn. Pendre works underwent several much-needed expansions, adding additional covered storage for carriages and more workshop room. Modern machine tools, along with proper lighting and a new power supply were added. Substantial improvements to Tywyn Wharf station were also made, along with continued relaying and upgrading of the track to Abergynolwyn. Passenger numbers continued to climb after the 1957 BBC broadcast; in 1960, 67,000 passenger journeys were made, increasing to 78,500 in 1964. In response to this growing popularity the railway undertook a programme of new rolling stock construction.

By the early 1960s Tywyn Wharf station was in need of major improvements. Before preservation, the station had contained only a fan of sidings, which meant that there was no way for the locomotive of an arriving train to run round the carriages. As a result, trains were pushed from behind as far as Pendre, where the locomotive could be moved past the carriages to the front of the train. A loop was installed at Wharf in 1952, being used from the start of the 1952 season, to avoid having to propel trains to Pendre, but in the winter of 1964/65 a major upgrade of the station was carried out. This improved the track layout and extended the original office building to provide covered accommodation for passengers and a shop.

As passenger numbers continued to grow during the late 1960s it became clear that further motive power was needed, especially as the rebuilt No. 1 was not performing well. The Talyllyn&#x27;s unusual track gauge and restricted loading gauge meant that it was unlikely that a locomotive could be found that could work on the line unaltered, so in 1969 a gauge steam locomotive was purchased from the Bord na Mona (Irish Peat Board) with a view to rebuilding it for use on the Talyllyn. This locomotive was unofficially known as &quot;Irish Pete&quot;, a nod to its original use.
====Extension to Nant Gwernol: 1969–1980====

The preservation society had long held ambitions to extend the railway along the former mineral extension from Abergynolwyn to the foot of the Alltwyllt incline, and as early as 1959 work had begun to trace the owners of the land that the extension traversed. Planning began in the mid-1960s, but construction did not start until 1968 when the winding house for the Abergynolwyn village incline was demolished. To bring the line up to passenger standards some of the curves needed to be eased, and this required blasting work, as the line runs on a narrow ledge on the hillside at this point. The extension and new station at Nant Gwernol were opened on 22 May 1976 by Wynford Vaughan Thomas who drove in the ceremonial &quot;golden spike&quot; to complete the extension. Despite this official opening ceremony, minor work still remained to bring the extension to the standard required to run regular passenger trains, but regular train services began on 29 May 1976.
Although the extension of the railway was completed in 1976, work in the vicinity continued with the creation of footpaths connecting to the new station. A new footbridge was built crossing the Nant Gwernol gorge and connecting the station with the existing path on the east side of the river. The bridge and paths were opened on 3 May 1980 by Lord Parry, the chairman of the Wales Tourist Board. By the mid-1970s, it had become clear that passenger numbers were no longer increasing. After 1973, the peak year for passengers on the Talyllyn with 186,000 passenger journeys made, numbers were to decline consistently until the 1990s. Preliminary work on the conversion of &quot;Irish Pete&quot; for use on the Talyllyn, which had begun in the early 1970s, was put on hold in 1975 and the chassis and boiler were put into storage at Pendre.

====Consolidation: 1980–2001====

With passenger numbers falling and the line extended to Nant Gwernol, the railway entered a period of consolidation. By 1987, the boiler on locomotive No. 6 &quot;Douglas&quot; was life expired and in need of replacement. Consideration was given to reviving the project to build a new locomotive from the components of &quot;Irish Pete&quot; instead of purchasing a new boiler for &quot;Douglas&quot; and in early 1988 work recommenced on the rebuilding of the ex-Bord na Mona locomotive. A new design for an 0-4-2 side tank locomotive was prepared by the railway&#x27;s Chief Engineer John Bate, which reused the chassis and boiler from the locomotive with a new superstructure and the addition of trailing wheels, and the new locomotive, officially named &quot;Tom Rolt&quot; after the Preservation Society&#x27;s first chairman, was put into service on 6 May 1991. During this period further expansions of both Tywyn Wharf and Pendre stations were undertaken and Abergynolwyn station, which had been rebuilt as part of the Nant Gwernol extension in the 1970s, was expanded further to provide an additional attraction at the eastern end of the line.

One major anomaly remained in the railway&#x27;s operations: the Regulation of Railways Act 1889 had required, amongst other measures, that all British passenger trains be fitted with continuous brakes. McConnel had secured an exemption for the Talyllyn Railway, on the basis that the low speed of operation meant they were unnecessary and that the cost of compliance would bankrupt the enterprise, but by the end of the 1990s the Railway Inspectorate was insisting that the Talyllyn be brought into compliance with the act, a little over 100 years after it had passed. By 2001, the railway had fitted its entire passenger fleet with the necessary equipment, operated by air brake pumps mounted on the locomotives.
====New museum: 2001–present====
The Preservation Society celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2001, and as part of the year of celebrations a major new project was launched to once more extend and improve facilities at Tywyn Wharf station. For many years the station had been home to semi-permanent buildings housing the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum, but the new plans for the station included the construction of a new two-storey building to house the museum and the extension of the existing station building to house a new cafe and booking office. Work began on the first phase of the project in January 2002. In 2003 the railway received a £682,500 Heritage Lottery grant towards the £1,170,000 cost of redeveloping Wharf station, and the new station and museum were officially opened by Prince Charles (later King Charles III) and Camilla, then Duchess of Cornwall, on 13 July 2005. The railway has seen a steady increase in passengers carried since the turn of the millennium, with nearly 51,000 passenger bookings and 95,500 passenger journeys recorded in 2006, although this figure is still only around half the peak figure carried in 1973. In 2011, the railway celebrated 60 years of preservation, and received an Engineering Heritage Award from the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in recognition of its importance in Welsh industrial heritage.

The railway struggled financially for several years after the banking collapse of 2007, but slowly began to recover. In 2008 a large amount of equipment was purchased from the gauge military railway at RNAD Trecwn, including a large quantity of track components and three diesel locomotives. In 2011 the railway celebrated the 60th anniversary of its rescue by the volunteers of 1951.

In April 2012 locomotive No.2 &quot;Dolgoch&quot; appeared at the Steel Steam and Stars Gala at the Llangollen Railway, running on a temporary section of narrow gauge track. This was the first time that &quot;Dolgoch&quot; had operated away from its home railway in 146 years. In June 2013 the railway was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Award for Voluntary Service. 2015 was the 150th anniversary of the official opening of the railway, and this was celebrated with a series of events throughout the year. In 2021, the Slate Landscape of North-west Wales, which includes the Talyllyn Railway and Bryn Eglwys Quarry, was designated a World Heritage Site.

==Today==
The Talyllyn Railway remains a successful and popular tourist attraction. The original 1860s locomotives and passenger stock still run regularly alongside the roster of more modern rolling stock. The railway is promoted as one of &quot;The Great Little Trains of Wales&quot;, a joint marketing scheme launched in 1970 that encompasses ten narrow gauge railways in the country, mostly found in north and mid Wales.

===Special events===
The railway operates a programme of special events throughout the year. These have include in the past the Anything-Goes Gala, Have-A-Go Gala, Tom Rolt Steam and Vintage Rally and Victorian Week. Occasional events are based on locomotives masquerading as their fictional counterparts from the Skarloey Railway. Since 1984 there has been an annual running event called Race the Train, which follows the railway track from Tywyn to Abergynolwyn and back again. The challenge is for runners to complete the cross country route faster than the train, which takes around 1 hour 47 minutes.

===Young Members Group===
The Young Members Group (YMG) are members and volunteers of the Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society who are between the ages of 14 and 25. On occasions during the peak season, the Railway has held Young Members Days in which the youngest qualified people available that day run the railway.

==Route==


===Original passenger line===
The main terminus of the line is at (originally known as King&#x27;s Station, after a local landowner), where the railway&#x27;s administrative headquarters and the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum are located. When the line carried traffic from the quarry, slates were transferred to the Cambrian Railways on the transhipment sidings. Leaving Wharf station, which stands at an elevation of above sea level, the line passes immediately under the A493 Machynlleth to Dolgellau road and enters a long cutting that climbs towards , at a maximum gradient of 1 in 60. On the left (north) side of the cutting there was once a long siding used for gravity shunting of wagons into the sidings at Wharf station. The railway runs through the cutting for about , before passing under another road bridge and passing the locomotive and carriage sheds and works at Pendre.

From Pendre, the railway passes over a gated level crossing and runs beside an industrial estate before climbing up to Ty Mawr bridge and on to Hendy, the first of five minor halts, which serves the adjacent farm. The railway runs in an approximately north-easterly direction along the Fathew valley, mainly through fields of local farms on the valley floor, although this is where some of the steepest gradients on the line are to be found. The ruling gradient of the line is 1 in 60.

More local halts follow at Fach Goch, and Cynfal, the latter having a small platform. The section from Cynfal to was relaid in 1951 using rail purchased from the Corris Railway after the latter line&#x27;s closure in 1948. Rhydyronen, a request stop, was the first intermediate station built on the line, opening in 1867. A siding at the station was shortened in 1957 and removed completely circa 1975. A short steep climb under a road bridge follows the station, followed by a slight downhill gradient. Unlike the Ffestiniog Railway, the Talyllyn was not designed to be worked as a gravity line, however this is the only downhill section between Pendre and Nant Gwernol. Another minor halt follows at Tynllwynhen, before the passing loop and request stop at .

Above Brynglas, the line crosses the Cwm Pandy stream and enters a shallow cutting, climbing as it goes. The cutting ends at a road overbridge after which the line runs through open countryside as it starts to ascend the valley side on a ledge. After approximately it enters woodlands west of , climbing steadily, then curves to the south east and crosses the Dolgoch gorge on the Dolgoch viaduct, which carries the line above the Dolgoch ravine. Dolgoch station is immediately east of the viaduct, situated on a left-hand curve at above sea level, and is the main intermediate station on the line, being popular with tourists visiting the nearby falls. The railway continues in a north easterly direction, curving through the woods and climbing the valley side. It shortly passes Quarry Siding, where a halt and passing loop are located; this is the site of a small old shale quarry, the rock from which was used for ballasting on the railway. A large permanent way and storage shed opened on the site in 2013. The line continues its ascent towards Abergynolwyn station, situated on a ledge cut into the hillside.

===Abergynolwyn to Nant Gwernol===

The original terminus of the statutory railway was Abergynolwyn, beyond which the railway continued as a long mineral extension, now converted for passenger use. The extension was originally sharply curved, as the line turns south east into the steeply sided Nant Gwernol gorge but these curves were eased when conversion for passenger use took place in 1976. The whole section is within woods, now owned by the Natural Resources Wales. Shortly after crossing over the forestry road the line reaches Tŷ Dŵr, where the original locomotive shed stood from 1865 until it was demolished after Pendre works opened in 1867. A slate water tower at this point was in use into the 1950s, and was rebuilt in 2022.
After passing the site of Ty Dwr the railway bends around &#x27;Amen&#x27; corner and soon after the Village Incline is reached. From here the line runs into the gorge, high above the river on a narrow ledge, ending at the foot of the first incline leading to the Bryn Eglwys quarry. The original line fanned out into a set of three sidings, used to marshal trains of loaded slate wagons coming down from the quarry and empty wagons waiting to ascend. Nant Gwernol station, the eastern terminus of the line, was built on the site of the sidings.

The village of Abergynolwyn was built to house the quarrymen of Bryn Eglwys and their families, and to serve the village an incline with winding house was laid three quarters of the way along the mineral extension. The winding house for the incline stood on the narrow ledge, with the mineral line passing through it. The two-track incline dropped over a distance of . At its foot, the line crossed the Nant Gwernol on a girder bridge. Immediately after the bridge, short lines branched off to the east from a wagon turntable to the coal yard and smithy of Pandy Farm and west to a writing slate factory (later a carpenter&#x27;s yard). The main branch then split to form a storage loop, with a further wagon turntable and a longer branch serving the houses and school to the north east. The main branch continued north, crossing the main road then passing between the two main terraces in the village before ending in a turntable and a final short line connecting to the Capel Jerusalem chapel. The village incline was lifted during the early years of preservation, to provide much needed rail to replace the existing track. The winding house was demolished in 1968 to allow realignment of the railway to form the extension to Nant Gwernol.

===Galltymoelfre Tramway===

Until the closure of the quarries in 1946, the line east from Abergynolwyn was worked as a mineral tramway – only slate and goods trains serving Bryn Eglwys ran on this section. The quarry lay about south-east of Nant Gwernol station and above it, with a further mineral tramway connecting the quarry with the railway. What is now Nant Gwernol station was the terminus of the Talyllyn Railway proper. Here the line fanned out into a set of sidings where inbound trains were left and outbound slate trains assembled. The sidings were located on a narrow ledge in the side of the Nant Gwernol gorge.
Rising south-east from the end of the sidings was the long, double track gravity operated, Alltwyllt incline, from the top of which the Galltymoelfre Tramway ran south-east towards the quarry for about . The tramway was laid in light bridge rail and worked for its entire existence using horses. The tramway ended at the foot of the Cantrybedd incline, a long double track, gravity operated incline. This final incline rose to the north edge of Bryn Eglwys quarry, reaching a height of above sea level.

==Operation==

The line has six steam locomotives for passenger trains and four diesel locomotives, which are primarily used for shunting and to haul works trains. It is unusual for all steam locomotives to be operable at the same time, as at least one is normally scheduled for overhaul. The railway also owns 23 carriages and vans, including all of the original carriages and the brake van built for the railway.
The railway is single track, so special measures have to be taken to prevent collisions. Before preservation, the railway operated a &quot;one engine in steam&quot; policy, but with growing passenger numbers it became necessary to install passing loops and a more stringent method of single line control was introduced. The line is worked by Electric Key tokens installed in 1973, which authorise the driver to enter a section of single line, and these are interlocked to prevent more than one token being withdrawn for a section at any one time. There is a loop at Pendre, which was used from the opening of the railway for shunting purposes, and further loops were installed at Brynglas in 1953 and Quarry Siding in 1963. When the Nant Gwernol extension opened in 1976, Abergynolwyn also became a passing loop.

Each passing loop is controlled by a small signal box, known as a block-post. These house the lever frames that control the points, the token equipment and telephones. The railway has few signals; instead it has stop boards at Pendre, Brynglas, Quarry Siding and Nant Gwernol, and the blockman allows trains to proceed by use of flags. There are colour light signals located at Tywyn Wharf, operated from the Control Office and disc signals controlled from the ground frame. Abergynolwyn has colour light signals, which are operated from the blockpost. When the block-post is unmanned, it is the responsibility of the locomotive crew to change the token before proceeding.

==In popular culture==

===&quot;The Railway Series&quot;===

The Talyllyn Railway is represented in &quot;The Railway Series&quot; books by the Reverend W. Awdry and its television adaptation &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; as the Skarloey Railway; most of the fictional locomotives are based on real-life equivalents. Awdry visited the line on a family holiday in the early days of preservation and became involved as a volunteer soon afterwards. Several of the stories in &quot;The Railway Series&quot; come from his real-life experiences at the Talyllyn, and some of the books contain full-page illustrations of Talyllyn locomotives. One of Awdry&#x27;s early experiences as a volunteer guard was waving for a train to depart Abergynolwyn too soon, causing the line&#x27;s Refreshment Lady to miss the train; an event adapted in both the books and the TV series. His son Christopher and his wife Diana, and their son Richard would all volunteer with the Talyllyn as well. Wilbert&#x27;s study along with his model trains were donated to the Talyllyn after his death and placed on display in the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum. In 2021 the railway began hosting the &quot;Awdry Extravaganza&quot; sharing lectures on &quot;The Railway Series&quot; from the Awdry study collection, and displaying artifacts and fan creations related to &quot;The Railway Series&quot; and &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;. The railway was briefly threatened legally by TV series creator Britt Allcroft for using the characters without paying her production company licensing fees, however since the railway&#x27;s agreement to use the Skarloey Railway characters predated the TV series; the railway was able to continue using them without licensing them as part of Day Out with Thomas.

===&quot;The Titfield Thunderbolt&quot;===

The preservation of the Talyllyn Railway by volunteers was the inspiration for the 1953 film &quot;The Titfield Thunderbolt&quot;, an Ealing Studios comedy about a group of villagers attempting to run a service on a disused branch line after closure. T. E. B. Clarke, the script writer for the film, had heard about the preservation of the Talyllyn and spent a day on the railway in 1951, and some of the early incidents in preservation were incorporated into the film. In the book &quot;Railway Adventure&quot; Tom Rolt recalled that he had hoped the film might be produced on the Talyllyn, but it was eventually filmed on the recently closed Camerton branch of the Bristol and North Somerset Railway branch line along the Cam Brook valley in Somerset. The actor Hugh Griffith, who played Dan in the film, was a friend of Tom Rolt and an early vice-president of the preservation society.

===&quot;Railway with a Heart of Gold&quot;===

In 1953, the American film producer Carson &quot;Kit&quot; Davidson produced a documentary film entitled &quot;Railway with a Heart of Gold&quot;, portraying the early days of preservation. Some incidents were staged for the film, such as a piece falling off the locomotive, which Davidson later described as &quot;corny&quot;. However most of the film was simply a record of the work and incidents that took place on the railway at the time, including a dramatic shot of &quot;Sir Haydn&quot; derailing due to the poor condition of the track at the time. The film, which was preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2012, ends with the quote
&quot;It is a relic, this railway, a bit of ornamental scrollwork lifted from the pattern of yesterday and kept as a memento.&quot;

<doc id="172765" wikidata="Q502652" url="?curid=172765" title="Stann Creek District">
<text>Stann Creek is a district in the south east region of Belize. According to the 2022 census, the district had a population of 48,162 people. Its capital is the town of Dangriga, formerly known as &quot;Stann Creek Town.&quot; Stann comes from &quot;stanns,&quot; or safe havens used by colonialists coming from the &quot;old world&quot; to the &quot;new world.&quot;

== Geography ==

Located within the district are the port of Big Creek (the main port of Belize&#x27;s banana industry), the peninsula and village of Placencia (a popular tourist destination), the villages of Santa Cruz, Alta Vista, Georgetown, Independence, Kendal, Maya Mopan, Middlesex, Mullins River, Pomona, Red Bank, Sarawee, Silk Grass, San Roman, Sittee River and the Garifuna village of Hopkins.

=== Political divisions ===
The district is split into two constituencies. They are Dangriga, which contains the town proper and two villages (including Hope Creek and Sarawee) and the offshore islands (cayes), and Stann Creek West, which contains most of the remaining villages including Santa Cruz, Placencia and Independence.

=== Transportation ===
The district is served by the Hummingbird Highway and the Thomas Vincent Ramos Highway, connecting to Belize City by way of the George Price Highway at Belmopan.

== Language ==
Mostly used language in Stann Creek is English, with the main town of Dangriga having a mix of English and Garifuna, since the majority of the residents are Garifuna.

== Attractions ==
The Stann Creek District is also home to the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary where South Stann Creek rises. Within the preserve is Victoria Peak, the second highest point in Belize, at above sea level. The ethnic Garifuna village of Hopkins has recently undergone a huge transformation due to the growing tourism industry. Placencia is home to one of Belize&#x27;s most popular tourist destinations due to its large selection of resorts, guest houses, hotels and white sandy beaches. The Garifuna are direct descendants of a group of African slaves who escaped two ship-wrecked Spanish slave ships near St. Vincent in 1635. They celebrate a diverse and rich culture that is a blend of African traditions of music, dance and religious ceremonies; Native American farming, hunting, and fishing techniques; and a French and Arawak influenced language.

<doc id="172769" wikidata="Q506049" url="?curid=172769" title="Toledo District">
<text>Toledo is the southernmost and least populated district in Belize. Punta Gorda is the District capital. According to the Human Development Index (HDI), it is the second most developed region in the country. The district has a diverse topography which features rainforests, extensive cave networks, coastal lowland plains, and offshore cays. Toledo is home to a wide range of cultures such as Mopan, Kekchi Maya, Creole, Garifuna, East Indians, Mennonites, Mestizos, and descendants of US Confederate settlers.

==Geography==
The District has many villages, including Monkey River Town and the Toledo Settlement; the Maya villages of San Pedro Columbia, Blue Creek, Indian Creek, Santa Cruz, San Antonio, San Jose, San Felipe; and the Garifuna village of Barranco. It also has a number of Maya ruins, including Lubaantun, Nim Li Punit, Uxbenka, and Pusilha. According to a 2022 mid-year census estimate, Toledo District had a population of 41,537 people, 6,801 of whom lived in Punta Gorda.

==Economy==

The economy of Toledo relies heavily upon agriculture. Crops grown include beans and corn, as well as rice, which is sold to the Big Falls Rice Mill. Cacao is grown organically and sold via the Toledo Cacao Growers Association to Green &amp; Black&#x27;s for their renowned Maya Gold chocolate, as well as to chocolatiers within Belize. The District&#x27;s ancient and modern-day links with chocolate are celebrated annually in May (Commonwealth Day Holiday weekend) at the Toledo Cacao Festival. Farmers grow additional crops such as coffee, yams, sweet potato, hot chilli peppers, avocado, oranges and plantain for sale at the market in Punta Gorda, held each Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday.

Fishermen in Toledo engage in small-scale fishing using dug-out canoes, and they also partake in lobster and conch diving during the open season. The Port Honduras Marine Reserve, situated just north of Punta Gorda Town, is a designated protected area. Toledo&#x27;s waters are renowned for being a prime location for catching permit fish. Many traditional fishermen have transitioned to becoming fly-fishing guides, thanks to alternative livelihood initiatives offered by local conservation groups.

Tourism has emerged as a significant industry in Toledo. While it was once considered a destination mainly for the intrepid, the establishment of new tourist accommodations and the development of guided tours, coupled with the district&#x27;s abundance of protected areas, diverse wildlife, exceptional bird-watching opportunities, and appealing offshore cays, have collectively contributed to Toledo&#x27;s recognition as a burgeoning and valuable travel destination.

== Language ==
According to the 2010 census, Mayan languages are spoken by 68.4% of the population. This makes Toledo the only district in Belize where native languages are spoken by a majority. 

On the 2010 census, about 18% of the population were native spanish speakers. Only 12.6% of the population had English as their first language, making it by far one of the least english-speaking districts of Belize.

==Gallery==
==Transportation==
The Toledo District is served by the paved Thomas Vincent Ramos Highway, as well as several bush roads to the many rural villages in the District. Regular bus service is provided by Punta Gorda-based James Bus Line, shuttling passengers between the other districts, and Punta Gorda is served by several daily commuter flights on Tropic Air, Maya Island Air and several small, family-run bus services that transport passengers to and from the rural villages.

==Events==
Each year, during the Commonwealth Day weekend, Toledo hosts the Chocolate Festival of Belize. The festival features chocolatiers from across the country as well as chocolate-related arts and crafts. According to the project coordinator for the Toledo Cacao Growers Association Thomas Tillett, the Association currently has a membership of about 1,100 cacao farmers.

<doc id="172770" wikidata="Q1493856" url="?curid=172770" title="Electro-Theremin">
<text>The Electro-Theremin is an electronic musical instrument developed by trombonist Paul Tanner and amateur inventor Bob Whitsell in the late 1950s to produce a sound to mimic that of the theremin. The instrument features a tone and portamento similar to that of the theremin, but with a different control mechanism. It consisted of a sine wave generator with a knob that controlled the pitch, placed inside a wooden box. The pitch knob was attached to a slider on the outside of the box with some string. The player would move the slider, thus turning the knob to the desired frequency, with the help of markings drawn on the box. This contrasts with the theremin, which a performer plays without touching as two antennas sense the position and movement of the performer&#x27;s hands.

==Background==
The instrument was custom-built at Tanner&#x27;s request. Tanner appreciated the theremin&#x27;s sound, but wanted greater control of pitch and attack. The Electro-Theremin uses mechanical controls, a long slide bar for the pitch (analogous to the slide of the trombone that was Tanner&#x27;s main instrument) and a knob to adjust volume. This contrasts with the hand movements in space that formed the original theremin&#x27;s signal feature. The Electro-Theremin also produces a slightly less complex timbre than the original. This is not due to the nature of the instrument, but due to the intentional harmonic generation in the output of the theremin, which Tanner did not do.

Tanner played it for the 1958 LP record &quot;Music for Heavenly Bodies&quot;, the first full-length album featuring the instrument, and played it subsequently on several television and movie soundtracks, including George Greeley&#x27;s theme for the 1960s TV series &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot; and on an LP record titled &quot;Music from Outer Space&quot;.

Tanner played his Electro-Theremin on four songs by The Beach Boys: &quot;I Just Wasn&#x27;t Made for These Times&quot;, &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, &quot;Wild Honey&quot; and a studio outtake written by Dennis Wilson known as &quot;Tune L&quot;. The instrument used in &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; was a Heathkit tube-type audio oscillator coupled to a mechanical action that allowed the player to mark notes along a ruler-type scale where notes could be located quickly and precisely.

Tanner&#x27;s prototype Electro-Theremin appears to have been the only one made. In the late 1960s, Tanner donated or sold the instrument to a hospital to use for audiology work, because he believed that newer keyboard synthesizers made it obsolete.

==Tannerin==
In 1999, Tom Polk built a replica of the original Electro-Theremin for Brian Wilson&#x27;s solo tour of that year. Polk called his instrument the Tannerin in honor of the original creator and performer.

== Similar instruments ==
* A musical saw, also called a singing saw, is the application of a hand saw as a musical instrument, played with a bow. The sound creates an ethereal tone, very similar to the theremin. The musical saw is classified as a friction idiophone with direct friction (131.22) under the Hornbostel-Sachs system of musical instrument classification.
* The Ondes-Martenot, 1928, which uses the principle of heterodyning oscillators, but has a keyboard as well as a slide controller and is touched while playing.
*Trautonium, a monophonic electronic musical instrument by Friedrich Trautwein, invented in 1929
* The Electronde, invented in 1929 by Martin Taubman, has an antenna for pitch control, a handheld switch for articulation and a foot pedal for volume control.
* The MC-505 by Roland, using the integrated D-Beam-sensor, sounds like a Theremin.
* The Haken Continuum Fingerboard uses a continuous, flat playing surface along which the player slides his fingers to create the desired pitch and timbre values. It is described as &quot;a continuous pitch controller that resembles a keyboard, but has no keys.&quot;
* The Persephone, an analogue fingerboard synthesizer with CV and MIDI, inspired by the trautonium. The Persephone allows continuous variation of the frequency range from 1 to 10 octaves. The ribbon is pressure and position sensitive. 
* The Therevox ET series of instruments are modern Electro-Theremins, while the ET-4 is based on the Ondes-Martenot.
* Audiocubes by Percussa are light-emitting &quot;smart blocks&quot; with four sensors, one on each side (optical theremin). The sensors measure the distance to the hands to control an effect or sound.
* The Otamatone by the Cube Works company, which is played by sliding the fingers up and down a stem to control a three-level pitch sound.

<doc id="172777" wikidata="Q690207" url="?curid=172777" title="Perceptron">
<text>In machine learning, the perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class. It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector.

==History==

The artificial neuron network was invented in 1943 by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in &quot;A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity&quot;. 

In 1957, Frank Rosenblatt was at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory. He simulated the perceptron on an IBM 704. Later, he obtained funding by the Information Systems Branch of the United States Office of Naval Research and the Rome Air Development Center, to build a custom-made computer, the Mark I Perceptron. It was first publicly demonstrated on 23 June 1960. The machine was &quot;part of a previously secret four-year NPIC [the US&#x27; National Photographic Interpretation Center] effort from 1963 through 1966 to develop this algorithm into a useful tool for photo-interpreters&quot;.

Rosenblatt described the details of the perceptron in a 1958 paper. His organization of a perceptron is constructed of three kinds of cells (&quot;units&quot;): AI, AII, R, which stand for &quot;projection&quot;, &quot;association&quot; and &quot;response&quot;. He presented at the first international symposium on AI, &quot;Mechanisation of Thought Processes&quot;, which took place in 1958 November.

Rosenblatt&#x27;s project was funded under Contract Nonr-401(40) &quot;Cognitive Systems Research Program&quot;, which lasted from 1959 to 1970, and Contract Nonr-2381(00) &quot;Project PARA&quot; (&quot;PARA&quot; means &quot;Perceiving and Recognition Automata&quot;), which lasted from 1957 to 1963.

In 1959, the Institute for Defense Analysis awarded his group a $10,000 contract. By September 1961, the ONR awarded further $153,000 worth of contracts, with $108,000 committed for 1962.

The ONR research manager, Marvin Denicoff, stated that ONR, instead of ARPA, funded the Perceptron project, because the project was unlikely to produce technological results in the near or medium term. Funding from ARPA go up to the order of millions dollars, while from ONR are on the order of 10,000 dollars. Meanwhile, the head of IPTO at ARPA, J.C.R. Licklider, was interested in &#x27;self-organizing&#x27;, &#x27;adaptive&#x27; and other biologically-inspired methods in the 1950s; but by the mid-1960s he was openly critical of these, including the perceptron. Instead he strongly favored the logical AI approach of Simon and Newell.

=== Mark I Perceptron machine ===
The perceptron was intended to be a machine, rather than a program, and while its first implementation was in software for the IBM 704, it was subsequently implemented in custom-built hardware as the Mark I Perceptron with the project name &quot;Project PARA&quot;, designed for image recognition. The machine is currently in Smithsonian National Museum of American History.

The Mark I Perceptron had 3 layers. One version was implemented as follows:

* An array of 400 photocells arranged in a 20x20 grid, named &quot;sensory units&quot; (S-units), or &quot;input retina&quot;. Each S-unit can connect to up to 40 A-units.
* A hidden layer of 512 perceptrons, named &quot;association units&quot; (A-units).
* An output layer of 8 perceptrons, named &quot;response units&quot; (R-units).
Rosenblatt called this three-layered perceptron network the &quot;alpha-perceptron&quot;, to distinguish it from other perceptron models he experimented with.

The S-units are connected to the A-units randomly (according to a table of random numbers) via a plugboard (see photo), to &quot;eliminate any particular intentional bias in the perceptron&quot;. The connection weights are fixed, not learned. Rosenblatt was adamant about the random connections, as he believed the retina was randomly connected to the visual cortex, and he wanted his perceptron machine to resemble human visual perception.

The A-units are connected to the R-units, with adjustable weights encoded in potentiometers, and weight updates during learning were performed by electric motors.The hardware details are in an operators&#x27; manual.
In a 1958 press conference organized by the US Navy, Rosenblatt made statements about the perceptron that caused a heated controversy among the fledgling AI community; based on Rosenblatt&#x27;s statements, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the perceptron to be &quot;the embryo of an electronic computer that [the Navy] expects will be able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence.&quot;

The Photo Division of Central Intelligence Agency, from 1960 to 1964, studied the use of Mark I Perceptron machine for recognizing militarily interesting silhouetted targets (such as planes and ships) in aerial photos.

Rosenblatt described his experiments with many variants of the Perceptron machine in a book &quot;Principles of Neurodynamics&quot; (1962). The book is a published version of the 1961 report.

Among the variants are:

* &quot;cross-coupling&quot; (connections between units within the same layer) with possibly closed loops, 
* &quot;back-coupling&quot; (connections from units in a later layer to units in a previous layer), 
* four-layer perceptrons where the last two layers have adjustible weights (and thus a proper multilayer perceptron),
* incorporating time-delays to perceptron units, to allow for processing sequential data,
* analyzing audio (instead of images).
The machine was shipped from Cornell to Smithsonian in 1967, under a government transfer administered by the Office of Naval Research.

=== &quot;Perceptrons&quot; (1969) ===

Although the perceptron initially seemed promising, it was quickly proved that perceptrons could not be trained to recognise many classes of patterns. This caused the field of neural network research to stagnate for many years, before it was recognised that a feedforward neural network with two or more layers (also called a multilayer perceptron) had greater processing power than perceptrons with one layer (also called a single-layer perceptron).

Single-layer perceptrons are only capable of learning linearly separable patterns. For a classification task with some step activation function, a single node will have a single line dividing the data points forming the patterns. More nodes can create more dividing lines, but those lines must somehow be combined to form more complex classifications. A second layer of perceptrons, or even linear nodes, are sufficient to solve many otherwise non-separable problems.

In 1969, a famous book entitled &quot;Perceptrons&quot; by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert showed that it was impossible for these classes of network to learn an XOR function. It is often incorrectly believed that they also conjectured that a similar result would hold for a multi-layer perceptron network. However, this is not true, as both Minsky and Papert already knew that multi-layer perceptrons were capable of producing an XOR function. (See the page on &quot;Perceptrons (book)&quot; for more information.) Nevertheless, the often-miscited Minsky and Papert text caused a significant decline in interest and funding of neural network research. It took ten more years until neural network research experienced a resurgence in the 1980s. This text was reprinted in 1987 as &quot;Perceptrons - Expanded Edition&quot; where some errors in the original text are shown and corrected.

=== Subsequent work ===
Rosenblatt continued working on perceptrons despite diminishing funding. The last attempt was Tobermory, built between 1961 and 1967, built for speech recognition. It occupied an entire room. It had 4 layers with 12,000 weights implemented by toroidal magnetic cores. By the time of its completion, simulation on digital computers had become faster than purpose-built perceptron machines. He died in a boating accident in 1971.

The kernel perceptron algorithm was already introduced in 1964 by Aizerman et al. Margin bounds guarantees were given for the Perceptron algorithm in the general non-separable case first by Freund and Schapire (1998), and more recently by Mohri and Rostamizadeh (2013) who extend previous results and give new and more favorable L1 bounds.

The perceptron is a simplified model of a biological neuron. While the complexity of biological neuron models is often required to fully understand neural behavior, research suggests a perceptron-like linear model can produce some behavior seen in real neurons.

The solution spaces of decision boundaries for all binary functions and learning behaviors are studied in.

== Definition ==
In the modern sense, the perceptron is an algorithm for learning a binary classifier called a threshold function: a function that maps its input formula_1 (a real-valued vector) to an output value formula_2 (a single binary value):

formula_3

where formula_4 is the Heaviside step-function (where an input of formula_5 outputs 1; otherwise 0 is the output ), formula_6 is a vector of real-valued weights, formula_7 is the dot product formula_8, where is the number of inputs to the perceptron, and is the &quot;bias&quot;. The bias shifts the decision boundary away from the origin and does not depend on any input value.

Equivalently, since formula_9, we can add the bias term formula_10 as another weight formula_11 and add a coordinate formula_12 to each input formula_1, and then write it as a linear classifier that passes the origin:formula_14

The binary value of formula_2 (0 or 1) is used to perform binary classification on formula_1 as either a positive or a negative instance. Spatially, the bias shifts the position (though not the orientation) of the planar decision boundary.

In the context of neural networks, a perceptron is an artificial neuron using the Heaviside step function as the activation function. The perceptron algorithm is also termed the single-layer perceptron, to distinguish it from a multilayer perceptron, which is a misnomer for a more complicated neural network. As a linear classifier, the single-layer perceptron is the simplest feedforward neural network.

== Power of representation ==

===Information theory===

From an information theory point of view, a single perceptron with &quot;K&quot; inputs has a capacity of &quot;2K&quot; bits of information. This result is due to Thomas Cover.

Specifically let formula_17 be the number of ways to linearly separate &quot;N&quot; points in &quot;K&quot; dimensions, thenformula_18When &quot;K&quot; is large, formula_19 is very close to one when formula_20, but very close to zero when formula_21. In words, one perceptron unit can almost certainly memorize a random assignment of binary labels on N points when formula_20, but almost certainly not when formula_21.

=== Boolean function ===
When operating on only binary inputs, a perceptron is called a linearly separable Boolean function, or threshold Boolean function. The sequence of numbers of threshold Boolean functions on n inputs is OEIS . The value is only known exactly up to formula_24 case, but the order of magnitude is known quite exactly: it has upper bound formula_25 and lower bound formula_26.

Any Boolean linear threshold function can be implemented with only integer weights. Furthermore, the number of bits necessary and sufficient for representing a single integer weight parameter is formula_27.

===Universal approximation theorem===

A single perceptron can learn to classify any half-space. It cannot solve any linearly nonseparable vectors, such as the Boolean exclusive-or problem (the famous &quot;XOR problem&quot;).

A perceptron network with one hidden layer can learn to classify any compact subset arbitrarily closely. Similarly, it can also approximate any compactly-supported continuous function arbitrarily closely. This is essentially a special case of the theorems by George Cybenko and Kurt Hornik.

=== Conjunctively local perceptron ===

&quot;Perceptrons&quot; (Minsky and Papert, 1969) studied the kind of perceptron networks necessary to learn various Boolean functions.

Consider a perceptron network with formula_28 input units, one hidden layer, and one output, similar to the Mark I Perceptron machine. It computes a Boolean function of type formula_29. They call a function conjuctively local of order formula_30, iff there exists a perceptron network such that each unit in the hidden layer connects to at most formula_30 input units.

Theorem. (Theorem 3.1.1): The parity function is conjuctively local of order formula_28.

Theorem. (Section 5.5): The connectedness function is conjuctively local of order formula_33.

== Learning algorithm for a single-layer perceptron ==

Below is an example of a learning algorithm for a single-layer perceptron with a single output unit. For a single-layer perceptron with multiple output units, since the weights of one output unit are completely separate from all the others&#x27;, the same algorithm can be run for each output unit.

For multilayer perceptrons, where a hidden layer exists, more sophisticated algorithms such as backpropagation must be used. If the activation function or the underlying process being modeled by the perceptron is nonlinear, alternative learning algorithms such as the delta rule can be used as long as the activation function is differentiable. Nonetheless, the learning algorithm described in the steps below will often work, even for multilayer perceptrons with nonlinear activation functions.

When multiple perceptrons are combined in an artificial neural network, each output neuron operates independently of all the others; thus, learning each output can be considered in isolation.

=== Definitions ===

We first define some variables:
*formula_34 is the learning rate of the perceptron. Learning rate is a positive number usually chosen to be less than 1. The larger the value, the greater the chance for volatility in the weight changes.
*formula_35 denotes the &quot;output&quot; from the perceptron for an input vector formula_36.
*formula_37 is the &quot;training set&quot; of formula_38 samples, where:
** formula_39 is the formula_28-dimensional input vector.
** formula_41 is the desired output value of the perceptron for that input.
We show the values of the features as follows:
*formula_42 is the value of the formula_43th feature of the formula_44th training &quot;input vector&quot;.
*formula_45.
To represent the weights: 
*formula_46 is the formula_43th value in the &quot;weight vector&quot;, to be multiplied by the value of the formula_43th input feature.
*Because formula_45, the formula_50 is effectively a bias that we use instead of the bias constant formula_10.
To show the time-dependence of formula_6, we use:
*formula_53 is the weight formula_43 at time formula_55.

=== Steps===

The algorithm updates the weights after every training sample in step 2b.

===Convergence of one perceptron on a linearly separable dataset===

A single perceptron is a linear classifier. It can only reach a stable state if all input vectors are classified correctly. In case the training set is &quot;not&quot; linearly separable, i.e. if the positive examples cannot be separated from the negative examples by a hyperplane, then the algorithm would not converge since there is no solution. Hence, if linear separability of the training set is not known a priori, one of the training variants below should be used. Detailed analysis and extensions to the convergence theorem are in Chapter 11 of &quot;Perceptrons&quot; (1969).

Linear separability is testable in time formula_56, where formula_28 is the number of data points, and formula_58 is the dimension of each point.

If the training set &quot;is&quot; linearly separable, then the perceptron is guaranteed to converge after making finitely many mistakes. The theorem is proved by Rosenblatt et al.

The following simple proof is due to Novikoff (1962). The idea of the proof is that the weight vector is always adjusted by a bounded amount in a direction with which it has a negative dot product, and thus can be bounded above by , where is the number of changes to the weight vector. However, it can also be bounded below by because if there exists an (unknown) satisfactory weight vector, then every change makes progress in this (unknown) direction by a positive amount that depends only on the input vector.
While the perceptron algorithm is guaranteed to converge on &quot;some&quot; solution in the case of a linearly separable training set, it may still pick &quot;any&quot; solution and problems may admit many solutions of varying quality. The &quot;perceptron of optimal stability&quot;, nowadays better known as the linear support-vector machine, was designed to solve this problem (Krauth and Mezard, 1987).

=== Perceptron cycling theorem ===
When the dataset is not linearly separable, then there is no way for a single perceptron to converge. However, we still have
This is proved first by Bradley Efron.

=== Learning a Boolean function ===
Consider a dataset where the formula_59 are from formula_60, that is, the vertices of an n-dimensional hypercube centered at origin, and formula_61. That is, all data points with positive formula_62 have formula_63, and vice versa. By the perceptron convergence theorem, a perceptron would converge after making at most formula_28 mistakes.

If we were to write a logical program to perform the same task, each positive example shows that one of the coordinates is the right one, and each negative example shows that its &quot;complement&quot; is a positive example. By collecting all the known positive examples, we eventually eliminate all but one coordinate, at which point the dataset is learned.

This bound is asymptotically tight in terms of the worst-case. In the worst-case, the first presented example is entirely new, and gives formula_28 bits of information, but each subsequent example would differ minimally from previous examples, and gives 1 bit each. After formula_66 examples, there are formula_67 bits of information, which is sufficient for the perceptron (with formula_67 bits of information).

However, it is not tight in terms of expectation if the examples are presented uniformly at random, since the first would give formula_28 bits, the second formula_70 bits, and so on, taking formula_71 examples in total.

== Variants ==
The pocket algorithm with ratchet (Gallant, 1990) solves the stability problem of perceptron learning by keeping the best solution seen so far &quot;in its pocket&quot;. The pocket algorithm then returns the solution in the pocket, rather than the last solution. It can be used also for non-separable data sets, where the aim is to find a perceptron with a small number of misclassifications. However, these solutions appear purely stochastically and hence the pocket algorithm neither approaches them gradually in the course of learning, nor are they guaranteed to show up within a given number of learning steps.

The Maxover algorithm (Wendemuth, 1995) is &quot;robust&quot; in the sense that it will converge regardless of (prior) knowledge of linear separability of the data set. In the linearly separable case, it will solve the training problem – if desired, even with optimal stability (maximum margin between the classes). For non-separable data sets, it will return a solution with a computable small number of misclassifications. In all cases, the algorithm gradually approaches the solution in the course of learning, without memorizing previous states and without stochastic jumps. Convergence is to global optimality for separable data sets and to local optimality for non-separable data sets.

The Voted Perceptron (Freund and Schapire, 1999), is a variant using multiple weighted perceptrons. The algorithm starts a new perceptron every time an example is wrongly classified, initializing the weights vector with the final weights of the last perceptron. Each perceptron will also be given another weight corresponding to how many examples do they correctly classify before wrongly classifying one, and at the end the output will be a weighted vote on all perceptrons.

In separable problems, perceptron training can also aim at finding the largest separating margin between the classes. The so-called perceptron of optimal stability can be determined by means of iterative training and optimization schemes, such as the Min-Over algorithm (Krauth and Mezard, 1987) or the AdaTron (Anlauf and Biehl, 1989)). AdaTron uses the fact that the corresponding quadratic optimization problem is convex. The perceptron of optimal stability, together with the kernel trick, are the conceptual foundations of the support-vector machine.

The formula_72-perceptron further used a pre-processing layer of fixed random weights, with thresholded output units. This enabled the perceptron to classify analogue patterns, by projecting them into a binary space. In fact, for a projection space of sufficiently high dimension, patterns can become linearly separable.

Another way to solve nonlinear problems without using multiple layers is to use higher order networks (sigma-pi unit). In this type of network, each element in the input vector is extended with each pairwise combination of multiplied inputs (second order). This can be extended to an &quot;n&quot;-order network.

It should be kept in mind, however, that the best classifier is not necessarily that which classifies all the training data perfectly. Indeed, if we had the prior constraint that the data come from equi-variant Gaussian distributions, the linear separation in the input space is optimal, and the nonlinear solution is overfitted.

Other linear classification algorithms include Winnow, support-vector machine, and logistic regression.

=== Multiclass perceptron ===
Like most other techniques for training linear classifiers, the perceptron generalizes naturally to multiclass classification. Here, the input formula_59 and the output formula_74 are drawn from arbitrary sets. A feature representation function formula_75 maps each possible input/output pair to a finite-dimensional real-valued feature vector. As before, the feature vector is multiplied by a weight vector formula_76, but now the resulting score is used to choose among many possible outputs:

:formula_77

Learning again iterates over the examples, predicting an output for each, leaving the weights unchanged when the predicted output matches the target, and changing them when it does not. The update becomes:

:formula_78

This multiclass feedback formulation reduces to the original perceptron when formula_59 is a real-valued vector, formula_74 is chosen from formula_81, and formula_82.

For certain problems, input/output representations and features can be chosen so that formula_83 can be found efficiently even though formula_74 is chosen from a very large or even infinite set.

Since 2002, perceptron training has become popular in the field of natural language processing for such tasks as part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing (Collins, 2002). It has also been applied to large-scale machine learning problems in a distributed computing setting.

<text>Belize is a district of the nation of Belize. Its capital is Belize City.

== Geography ==

Most of the Belize District is in the east central mainland of Belize; the Belize District also includes various offshore islands, including Ambergris Caye, Caye Caulker, St. George&#x27;s Caye, Caye Chapel, English Caye, Goff&#x27;s Caye, and Turneffe Atoll. Ambergris Caye and Caye Caulker are considered two of the country&#x27;s primary tourism areas. The longest river in the country, the Belize River, passes through the district and joins the Caribbean Sea along its coast. The Northern River, Sibun River, and Manatee River are also in this District.

=== Settlements ===

San Pedro Town, which is situated on the island of Ambergris Caye, is also in the Belize District. Caye Caulker and St. George&#x27;s Caye are the island villages in this district. Maskall, Bomba, Corozalito, Santana, Lucky Strike, Rockstone Pond, Boston, Crooked Tree, Biscayne, May Pen, Gardenia, Grace Bank, Sand Hill, Lord&#x27;s Bank, Ladyville, Burrel Boom, Buttercup, Scotland Halfmoon, Flowers Bank, Bermudian Landing, Isabella Bank, Double Head Cabbage, Willows Bank, Saint Paul&#x27;s Bank, Big Falls, Rancho Dolores, Hattieville, Freetown Sibun, Gracie Rock, La Democracia, and Gales Point are all mainland villages in the Belize District. The Crooked Tree and Monkey Bay Wildlife Sanctuaries, the Belize Zoo (30 miles west of Belize City), as well as the ancient Maya ruins of Altun Ha are all in this district.

== History ==

The Belize District was the area first settled by Europeans. They developed estates along the rivers and creeks; because these waterways were their transportation highways. Many of the estates were referred to as the owner&#x27;s &#x27;bank&#x27;(as in the banks of a river). Therefore, Mr. Lord&#x27;s estate on the bank of the Belize River became Lord&#x27;s Bank and Mr. Flowers&#x27; home place on this same river became Flowers Bank. Many of these old estates have grown into villages; while other places on our map such as Baker, Bob Eiley, Bocotora, Butcher Burns, Lime Walk, More Force, Nago Bank, Washing Tree, Cedar Bank, Churchyard, Egypt, Watters Bank, and White Hill are old estates which did not become villages. Some places like Davis Bank and Tropical Park have now become parts of larger communities.

== Demographics ==

In 2005 mid-year population estimate to the Belize District was 87,000 with an estimated number of 69,200 of these living in the two urban areas. Belize City is by far the large of the two with an estimated population of 60,800. San Pedro Town has a population of about 8,900. The population of all the villages and outlying communities combined is about 17,800 people.

===Population and housing===
2010 Population and Housing Census has Belize district&#x27;s total population as 89,247 residents, of this 43,980 are males and 45,267 are females. The total number of households is 27,161 and the average household size is 3.3.

== Political divisions ==
Politically, Belize District contains 13 constituencies according to the Elections and Boundaries Department. 10 of these are in Belize City proper; the remainder are classified as rural.

=== Belize City constituencies ===
The 10 constituencies that fall within the city limits of Belize City are: Albert, Caribbean Shores, Collet, Fort George, Freetown, Lake Independence, Mesopotamia, Pickstock, Port Loyola, and Queen&#x27;s Square. Both Leader of the Opposition Shyne Barrow (Mesopotamia) and former Leader of the Opposition Francis Fonseca (Freetown) represent Belize City constituencies.

=== Belize Rural North ===
Belize Rural North contains the northern half of mainland Belize District, including Maskall, Lucky Strike and villages in the Belize River Valley and along the Northern Highway, except for Ladyville and Lord&#x27;s Bank. Its current representative is Marconi Leal of the People&#x27;s United Party.

=== Belize Rural Central ===

<doc id="172781" wikidata="Q512273" url="?curid=172781" title="Corozal District">
<text>Corozal is the northernmost district of the nation of Belize. The population was 46,071 in 2024. The district capital is Corozal Town.

Pre-Columbian Maya ruins are found in Corozal at Santa Rita near Corozal Town, and at Cerros.

==Towns and Villages==
Corozal District includes Corozal Town and the villages of Buena Vista, Calcutta, Caledonia, Carolina, Chan Chen, Chunox, Concepcion, Consejo, Copper Bank, Cristo Rey, Estrella, Libertad, Little Belize, Louisville, Paraiso, Patchacan, Progresso, Ranchito, San Andres, San Antonio, San Joaquin, San Narciso, San Roman, San Victor, San Pedro, Santa Clara, Sarteneja, Xaibe, and Yo Chen.

In addition, the island of Ambergris Caye is geographically closer to Corozal District than the district in which it is administrated, Belize District.

==Political divisions==
There are four political divisions in the Corozal District.

*&quot;Corozal Bay&quot; is represented by the Peoples United Party&#x27;s David &quot;Dido&quot; Vega, in his first term. The division includes most of Corozal Town proper.
*&quot;Corozal North&quot; covers the villages immediately north and west of Corozal Town and is held by three-term representative Hugo Patt of the UDP.
*&quot;Corozal South East&quot; has long been a PUP stronghold under father and son Florencio Marin Sr. (who stepped down in 2008 after seven terms) and Florencio Marin Jr., who is now in his fourth term.
*&quot;Corozal South West&quot; is represented by the PUP representative Ramiro Ramirez, who beat incumbent Dr. Angel Campos of the UDP in 2020.

== Economy ==
While Corozal District depended for many years on the sugar industry, at one time having its own sugar factory in Libertad Village, today the economy is more diversified. Sugar production and other agricultural crops such as papaya are still central to the way of life of many rural Corozalenos, but occupations in the tourism industry are slowly becoming more prominent. Now almost 65% of Corozalenos depend on the Commercial Free Zone for employment. The Zone is located on the border of Belize and Mexico.

Contraband is the biggest source of growing income in Corozal since it is adjacent to Mexico, and includes such things as vegetables, fruits, liquors, cigarettes, and gasoline.

==Languages==
English is the most spoken language in Corozal, followed by Spanish. 80% speak English very well and 60% speak Spanish very well.

Corozal&#x27;s villages are divided by colour and language:

Corozal Town, the main centre of the District, is peopled by a mix of Belize&#x27;s races and cultures, most notably the Maya Mestizos. Spanish and English are the major languages spoken.

Calcutta, Estrella Village, Libertad, Ranchito, and San Antonio are populated by East Indian people and speak English and Spanish very well.

Chan Chen, Chunox, Cristo Rey, Louisville, Patchakan, San Pedro, San Victor Village, Xaibe, and Yo Chen are populated by Maya people and speak Spanish and Yucatec Maya language very well, along with some English.

Buena Vista, Caledonia, Conception, San Narciso, San Roman, and Santa Clara are populated by Maya-Mestizo people who speak Spanish, some English and elders speaking Yucatec Maya. They are not obliged to learn English, because school teachers teach in Spanish but write in English and because at work the primary language is Spanish, so villagers are not exposed to English on a daily basis.

Progresso, San Andres, and Sarteneja Village are populated by Creole and Hispanic people, who share their cultures and languages in English and Spanish.

Little Belize is populated by Mennonites, who speak German.

==Education==
Belize Adventist College and Belize Adventist Junior College are located in the village of Calcutta in the Corozal District.
Corozal Community College and Corozal Junior College are found in the village of San Andres and also near San Antonio in Corozal District.

St. Viator Vocational High School is located just outside Chunox in the Corozal District.

Centro Escolar Mexico Junior College(CEMJC) and Escuela Secundaria Tecnica Mexico or E.S.T.M. is located in the village of San Roman in the Corozal District.

<text>Joseph Frank Ossanna, Jr. (December 10, 1928 – November 28, 1977) was an American electrical engineer and computer programmer who worked as a member of the technical staff at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey. He became actively engaged in the software design of Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service), a general-purpose operating system used at Bell.

== Education and career ==
Ossanna received his Bachelor of Engineering (B.S.E.E.) from Wayne State University in 1952.

At Bell Telephone Labs, Ossanna was concerned with low-noise amplifier design, feedback amplifier design, satellite look-angle prediction, mobile radio fading theory, and statistical data processing. He was also concerned with the operation of the Murray Hill Computation Center and was actively engaged in the software design of Multics.

After learning how to program the PDP-7 computer, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Joe Ossanna, and Rudd Canaday began to program the operating system that was designed earlier by Thompson (Unics, later named Unix). After writing the file system and a set of basic utilities, and assembler, a core of the Unix operating system was established. Doug McIlroy later wrote, &quot;Ossanna, with the instincts of a motor pool sergeant, equipped our first lab and attracted the first outside users.&quot;

When the team got a Graphic Systems CAT phototypesetter for making camera-ready copy of professional articles for publication and patent applications, Ossanna wrote a version of &quot;nroff&quot; that would drive it. It was dubbed &quot;troff&quot;, for &quot;typesetter roff&quot;. So it was that in 1973 he authored the first version of troff for Unix entirely written in PDP-11 assembly language. However, two years later, Ossanna re-wrote the code in the C programming language. He had planned another rewrite which was supposed to improve its usability but this work was taken over by Brian Kernighan.

Ossanna was a member of the Association for Computing Machinery, Sigma Xi, and Tau Beta Pi.

== Later life and death ==
He died as a consequence of heart disease.

<text>Orange Walk is a district in the northwest of the nation of Belize, with its district capital in Orange Walk Town.

==Main settlements==
The Orange Walk District, with an area of 1,829 square miles (4,636 square km), is located north-northwest of the Belize District. This is the second largest district in terms of total area in comparison to other districts in Belize, and lies between the Belize and Corozal districts to the east, Mexico to the north and Guatemala to the west. Villages in Orange Walk District include August Pine Ridge, Blue Creek, Carmelita, Chan Pine Ridge, Douglas, Indian Church, Guinea Grass, San Antonio, San Carlos, San Estevan, San Felipe, San José, San Jose Palmar, Nuevo San Juan, San Lazaro, San Luis, San Pablo, San Román, Santa Cruz, Santa Martha, Shipyard, Trial Farm, Trinidad and Yo Creek. Other settlements with smaller numbers of inhabitants may also be found, as well as ancient Mayan sites such as Cuello, Lamanai, Noh Mul and Chan Chich. The Rio Bravo Conservation and Management Area, a large private nature reserve in the Yalbac Hills, is also located in this district. The land is highly cultivated with sugar cane, sorghum, rice, corn and vegetables, with a significant amount of this agriculture done by Mennonite farmers. 
According to the Statistical Institute of Belize, the Orange Walk District had an estimated population of 45,419 persons for the 2010 population and housing census; 13,400 of these persons lived in the urban area of Orange Walk Town while 32,019 lived in rural areas.

==Economy==
The capital of the district is Orange Walk Town, with an estimated population of 13,400. The district is home to mostly Maya mestizo descendants of Mexican refugees who fled from the 1840 Caste War. The district&#x27;s main economic base is drawn from agriculture, with sugar cane being the primary crop. This is slowly being replaced by a combination of alternative crops such potatoes, onions and soya beans. Orange Walk is also important for its production of dairy products, citrus fruits, beef and rum production. Another emerging industry is tourism due to healthy populations of tropical wildlife and the rich archaeological sites now coming to light. There are over 400 recorded bird species in the district, making Orange Walk a birdwatcher&#x27;s paradise. Several settlements in the district are also home to German speaking Amish Mennonites. The district is also the home of two rivers, the Rio Hondo, which also forms part of the border with Mexico, and the New River, which has as its source Belize&#x27;s largest body of water, the New River Lagoon.

==History==
Industry in Orange Walk was previously dominated by logging for over a hundred years until the refugees of the Caste War arrived in the late 19th century. At the time of logging, all the timber was floated down the New River into the Corozal Bay, then to Belize City and shipped abroad. At the time of the arrival of the Caste War refugees, the logging industry was in decline and eventually the sugar industry was established. There has been evidence that some Yucatec Maya were still living in a remote area of Yalbac hills of the district when the British arrived in the Orange walk District.

Although the Orange Walk District has no coast because it is locked inland, it boasts the remains of two forts, Forts Mundy and Cairns, built by soldiers of the British Honduras West India Regiment. The forts were built in the 19th century after battles between earlier Mayan inhabitants of the district, most notably Marcus Canul and his Icaiche Indians, and settlers.

==Political divisions==
Politically, Orange Walk is divided into 4 constituencies, three currently under the People&#x27;s United Party (PUP) and one under the United Democratic Party (UDP).

*Orange Walk Central: Orange Walk Central generally includes the vicinity of Orange Walk Town and the village of San Estevan. Since 1993, this seat has been held by the PUP&#x27;s John Briceno. Briceno was re-elected in the 2015 elections.
*Orange Walk East: Orange Walk East includes the eastern area of Orange Walk Town and the easternmost villages in the district, particularly San Jose Palmar, Chan Pine Ridge, Tower Hill, Carmelita and Santa Martha. Elodio Aragon of the UDP won this seat in the 2015 elections.
*Orange Walk North: Gaspar Vega won this seat for the UDP in the 2015 elections. The area includes the Otro Benque area of Orange Walk Town and the villages of Trial Farm, San Jose, San Pablo, Douglas, San Roman, San Luis, Nuevo San Juan, San Antonio and Santa Cruz.
*Orange Walk South: Orange Walk South contains the villages of San Lazaro, Yo Creek, Trinidad, August Pine Ridge, San Felipe, Guinea Grass, Blue Creek, Shipyard and a number of other villages. Jose Abelardo Mai for the PUP is the recently elected area representative in the 2015 elections.

==Language==
In the Orange Walk District, Spanish, Kriol and English are the most spoken languages. The Mennonite community, which is around 37.5% of the district&#x27;s population, speaks primarily German. In many villages Yucatec Maya is still spoken by elders.

<doc id="172791" wikidata="Q3805414" url="?curid=172791" title="JT Storage">
<text>JTS Corporation was a maker of inexpensive IDE hard drives for personal computers based in San Jose, California. It was founded in 1994 by &quot;Jugi&quot; Tandon—the inventor of the double-sided floppy disk drive and founder of Tandon Corporation—and David B. Pearce, of former bankrupt disk manufacturer Kalok. Its name is derived from its co-founder, standing for &quot;Jugi Tandon Storage&quot;.

The company later reverse-merged with Jack Tramiel&#x27;s Atari Corporation in 1996, sold all Atari assets to Hasbro Interactive in 1998 and was finally declared bankrupt in 1999.

==History==
It was founded under the legal name JT Storage, Inc., but traded as JTS Corp. A few months after its foundation, Pearce departed the company, with Tandon filling his role as president. Then in June 1995, Tom Mitchell, a co-founder of Seagate and former president and Chief Operating Officer of both Seagate and Conner Peripherals, was appointed the Chief Executive Officer of JTS.

===First products===

JTS initially focused on a new 3&quot; form-factor drive for laptops. The 3&quot; form factor allowed a larger drive capacity for laptops with the existing technology. Compaq was actively engaged in qualifying these drives and built several laptops with this form factor drive. Lack of a second source was a major obstacle for this new form factor to gain a foothold; JTS licensed the form factor to Western Digital to attempt to remedy this problem. Eventually, as 2.5&quot; drives became cheaper to build, interest in the 3&quot; form factor waned, and JTS and WD stopped the project in 1998.

JTS by then had become a source of cheap, medium-performance 3.5&quot; drives with 5400 RPM spindles. The drives, produced in a factory in India (the factory was in the Madras Export Processing Zone in the suburbs of the Southern Indian city of Madras, now known as Chennai), were known for poor reliability. Failure rates were very high and quality control was inconsistent: good drives were very good, still running after 5 years, whereas bad drives almost always failed within a few weeks. Because of their low-tier reputation, JTS drives were rare in brand-name PCs and most frequently turned up in home-built and whitebox PCs. Product lines included Palladium and Champion internal IDE hard drives.

The basic design of their drives was done by Kalok for TEAC in the early 1990s. TEAC used the design as part of a removable HDD system, which was also sold under the Kalok name. After Kalok failed in 1994, JTS hired its founder as their chief technical officer, and licensed the patents involved from TEAC and Pont Peripherals.

===Merger with Atari Corporation===

On February 13, 1996, JTS announced a reverse merger with former video game and home computer manufacturer, Atari Corporation. It was primarily a marriage of convenience; JTS had products but little cashflow, while Atari had money, primarily from a series of successful lawsuits earlier in the decade followed by good investments. However, with the failure of its Jaguar game console, losses mounting, and no other products to sell, Atari expected to run out of money within two years. Originally it was planned that the storage company and Atari would be two separate divisions under JTS, but in April the merger was amended so that Atari would merge into JTS, with JTS being the surviving entity. Atari&#x27;s Jack Tramiel would take a place on JTS&#x27;s board of directors. 

Within a few months of the merger becoming official on July 30, all former Atari employees were either dismissed or relocated to JTS&#x27;s headquarters. Atari&#x27;s remaining inventory of Jaguar products proved difficult to get rid of, even at liquidation prices, and the bulk of them remained in stock months after the merger until finally being moved out to a private liquidator on December 23, 1996. Next Generation Online reported that JTS did not honor the Atari side of the business despite owning all these assets: no video game software was developed during this time, although licensing to third-parties did result in a handful of releases: THQ&#x27;s &quot;Super Breakout / Battlezone&quot; on Game Boy, Midway&#x27;s &quot;Arcade&#x27;s Greatest Hits: The Atari Collection 1&quot;, Activision&#x27;s &quot;Battlezone&quot; on PC, and a number of Jaguar games by Telegames.

=== Demise ===
The company secured $25 million in finances in September 1997. But even with the cash infusion from Atari and the investments, JTS quickly ran out of money. On March 13, 1998, JTS sold the Atari name and assets to Hasbro Interactive for $5 million, less than a fifth of what Warner Communications had paid the original Atari company 22 years earlier. On two occasions in April, JTS staff were laid off including some former long-time Atari individuals, and the company was soon forced out of AMEX. Later that year, on December 11, JTS filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, with a reported $4.2 million assets and $136 million of liabilities. However, on January 28, 1999, the company was closed down for good when its filing was ultimately converted into involuntary Chapter 7 liquidation by the bankruptcy courts. Its president and CEO, Tom Mitchell, returned to the disk storage industry the following year when he founded Fabrinet.

<doc id="172794" wikidata="Q356745" url="?curid=172794" title="Billy Ocean">
<text>Leslie Sebastian Charles (born 21 January 1950), known professionally as Billy Ocean, is a Trinidadian-born British singer and songwriter. Between 1976 and 1988, he had a series of hit songs in the UK and internationally.

After releasing several recordings under other stage names, he achieved breakthrough success with the 1976 single &quot;Love Really Hurts Without You&quot;. It was the second single released under the stage name Billy Ocean and peaked at no. 2 in the UK and no. 3 in Australia. Later that year, he achieved two additional top 20 singles in the UK. In 1977, his single &quot;Red Light Spells Danger&quot; also peaked at no. 2. After a period of limited chart success, he released the single &quot;Caribbean Queen (No More Love on the Run)&quot; in 1984. In the UK, the song peaked at no. 6. In the U.S., it entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at no. 85 but peaked at no. 1 ten weeks later. Ocean won the 1985 Grammy Award for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance for the song. It also charted in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa and across Europe under three different titles. Across the next three years, Ocean accumulated a series of international hit singles. Released in 1985, &quot;When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going&quot; peaked at no. 1 in the UK and no. 2 in the U.S. the following year. In the same year, he achieved an American no. 1 with the single &quot;There&#x27;ll Be Sad Songs (To Make You Cry)&quot;. In 1988, his single &quot;Get Outta My Dreams, Get into My Car&quot; reached no. 1 in the U.S. and no. 3 in the UK.

In recognition of his success and influence, Ocean has received a number of awards. In 2002, he was presented with an honorary doctorate of music by the University of Westminster. In 2010, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the MOBO Awards. The following year, he became a Companion of the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts.

== Early life and stardom ==
Ocean was born on 21 January 1950 in Fyzabad, Trinidad and Tobago, to Hainsley Charles, a Grenadian musician, and his wife Violet. He moved to Romford, Essex, England, when he was 10 years old, shortly before Trinidad and Tobago became independent in 1962. He was exposed to music at an early age. During his teenage years, he sang regularly in a London nightclub while also working as a tailor in London&#x27;s Savile Row.

He was discovered by his first manager, John Morphew, who recorded a double A-side single at Pye Studios in London with a full orchestra. However, the ballad-singing style of Ocean was going out of fashion, and Morphew was unable to get any major label to release it. It remains unreleased. Ocean&#x27;s father — who had countersigned the management contract as Ocean was underage — asked Morphew to release him from the recording contract, which he did without penalty. In 1969, he joined a local band, the Shades of Midnight, playing in the Shoreditch area of London. He recorded a David Myers and John Worsley composition, &quot;Nashville Rain&quot;, his first single, backed with &quot;Sun in the Morning&quot;, in 1971 for Spark Records under the name Les Charles, and for two years fronted a studio band called Scorched Earth, with whom he released &quot;On The Run&quot; backed with &quot;Super Woman, Super Lover&quot; in 1974.
In an interview with Myf Warhurst on ABC Radio Melbourne, Ocean stated that the story of his stage name being taken from the local Ocean Estate, Stepney in London&#x27;s East End, where he was living at the time, was incorrect. According to the interview, the name was derived from a local football team that was in his home town in Trinidad and Tobago, who called themselves &quot;Oceans 11&quot;.

== International success ==

Between 1976 and 1982, Ocean released four studio albums: &quot;Billy Ocean&quot; (1976), &quot;City Limit&quot; (1980), &quot;Nights (Feel Like Getting Down)&quot; (1981) and &quot;Inner Feelings&quot; (1982) through his record label GTO, none of which scored success on any musical charts, aside from his biggest single up to that point, 1976&#x27;s &quot;Love Really Hurts Without You&quot;, which was a top 40 and a top 10 hit in both the UK (no. 2) and the U.S. (no. 22).

As Sony Music acquired GTO Records in 1978, Ocean was shifted to Jive from Epic, in which he received a second breakthrough in his career in the early 1980s. Late 1984 saw the release of his fifth studio album &quot;Suddenly&quot; and its main single, &quot;Caribbean Queen (No More Love on the Run)&quot; becoming successes on the charts. &quot;Caribbean Queen&quot; became Ocean&#x27;s first no. 1 single on both the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Hot Black Singles charts in late 1984, and the album debuted in the top ten, peaking at no. 9 on both the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the UK Albums Chart simultaneously in the U.S. and UK. &quot;Suddenly&quot; reached gold in the UK, and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). He also recorded with Scott Walker in 1984, singing harmony vocals on &quot;Track Three&quot; from Walker&#x27;s eleventh studio album &quot;Climate of Hunter&quot;.

“Caribbean Queen” scored Ocean two Grammy Award nominations, and he won the Grammy Award for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance at the 1985 Grammy Awards. Ocean was later presented his award by Jeffrey Daniel of vocal group Shalamar on &quot;620 Soul Train&quot;, a UK incarnation of the American musical variety television show &quot;Soul Train&quot;. The album&#x27;s title track also became a success, peaking at no. 4 in both the U.S. and the UK. The song &quot;Loverboy&quot; was a no. 2 U.S. success in 1985. Ocean appeared at Live Aid from JFK Stadium in Philadelphia in 1985, singing &quot;Caribbean Queen&quot; and &quot;Loverboy&quot;.

His sixth studio album &quot;Love Zone&quot; (1986) also sold well. It included the successful singles &quot;When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going&quot;, the theme from the film &quot;The Jewel of the Nile&quot; (1985); this was a no. 1 success in the UK and a no. 2 in the United States; and &quot;There&#x27;ll Be Sad Songs (To Make You Cry)&quot; (a U.S. no. 1 and a major UK success). Also included were the title track and &quot;Love Is Forever&quot;, which were no. 10 and no. 16 U.S. successes for Ocean, respectively. It also earned Ocean a second nomination for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance at the 1987 Grammy Awards.

In February 1986, Ocean&#x27;s music video for &quot;When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going&quot; was banned by the BBC, owing to such non-union members as the American actors Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito, all three of whom were cast members of &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Jewel of the Nile&quot; (1985), miming to the backing vocals. In 1987, he was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Male Artist. He was the most popular British R&amp;B singer-songwriter of the early to mid- 1980s.

&quot;Tear Down These Walls&quot; (1988), Ocean&#x27;s next studio album, featured the no. 1 single &quot;Get Outta My Dreams, Get into My Car&quot;, and the album was certified platinum.

== Later career ==
Ocean&#x27;s eighth studio album &quot;Time to Move On&quot; (1993) failed to produce any major successes, but his 1989 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; collection has been a steady seller over the years, and his 1997 compilation album &quot;L.I.F.E. – Love Is for Ever&quot; made no. 7 on the UK Albums Chart. Ocean&#x27;s last studio album for Jive Records was &quot;Time to Move On&quot;, which he recorded in Chicago with R&amp;B star R. Kelly.

In 2002, the University of Westminster in London awarded Ocean an honorary doctorate of music. The awards ceremony took place in the Barbican Centre in London. He continues to tour and record in Europe. Ocean is now a patron for Tech Music Schools in London, made up of Drumtech, Vocaltech, Guitar-X and Keyboardtech. He regularly visits to hold clinics and seminars for the students.

In 2004, &quot;Caribbean Queen (No More Love on the Run)&quot; was re-released as a digital single for its 20th anniversary, shooting up to no. 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; digital singles chart and garnering radio play across the United States and UK.

<text>TYPSET is an early document editor that was used with the 1964-released RUNOFF program, one of the earliest text formatting programs to see significant use.

Of two earlier print/formatting programs DITTO and TJ-2, only the latter had, and introduced, text justification; RUNOFF also added pagination.

The name RUNOFF, and similar names led to other formatting program implementations. By 1982, &quot;Runoff&quot; (a name not possible before lowercase letters were introduced to filenames) largely became associated with Digital Equipment Corporation and Unix computers. DEC used the terms &quot;VAX DSR&quot; and &quot;DSR&quot; to refer to &quot;VAX DIGITAL Standard Runoff&quot;.

==History==

===CTSS===
The original RUNOFF type-setting program for CTSS was written by Jerome H. Saltzer circa 1964. Bob Morris and Doug McIlroy translated that from MAD to BCPL. Morris and McIlroy then moved the BCPL version to Multics when the IBM 7094 on which CTSS ran was being shut down.

===Multics===
Documentation for the Multics version of RUNOFF described it as &quot;types out text segments in manuscript form.&quot;

===Other versions and implementations===
A later version of runoff for Multics was written in PL/I by Dennis Capps, in 1974.
This runoff code was the ancestor of &quot;roff&quot; that was written for the fledgling Unix in assembly language by Ken Thompson.

Other versions of Runoff were developed for various computer systems including Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s PDP-11 minicomputer systems running RT-11, RSTS/E, RSX on Digital&#x27;s PDP-10 and for OpenVMS on VAX minicomputers, as well as UNIVAC Series 90 mainframes using the EDT text editor under the VS/9 operating system. These different releases of Runoff typically had little in common except the convention of indicating a command to Runoff by beginning the line with a period.

The origin of IBM&#x27;s SCRIPT software began in 1968 when IBM contracted Stuart Madnick of MIT to write a simple document preparation tool for CP/67, which he modelled on MIT&#x27;s CTSS RUNOFF.

==Background==
RUNOFF was written in 1964 for the CTSS operating system by Jerome H. Saltzer in MAD and FAP.

It actually consisted of a pair of programs, TYPSET (which was basically a document editor), and RUNOFF (the output processor). RUNOFF had support for pagination and headers, as well as text justification (TJ-2 appears to have been the earliest text justification system, but it did not have the other capabilities).

RUNOFF is a direct predecessor of the runoff document formatting program of Multics, which in turn was the ancestor of the roff and nroff document formatting programs of Unix, and their descendants. It was also the ancestor of FORMAT for the IBM System/360, and of course indirectly of every computerized word processing system.

Likewise, RUNOFF for CTSS was the predecessor of the various RUNOFFs for DEC&#x27;s operating systems, via the RUNOFF developed by the University of California, Berkeley&#x27;s Project Genie for the SDS 940 system.

The name is alleged to have come from the phrase at the time, &quot;I&#x27;ll run off a copy&quot;.

TYPESET contains features inspired by a variety of other programs including Colossal Typewriter and Expensive Typewriter.

<text>roff is a typesetting markup language. As the first Unix text-formatting computer program, it is a predecessor of the nroff and troff document processing systems. 

Roff was a Unix version of the runoff text-formatting program from Multics, which was a descendant of RUNOFF for CTSS (the first computerized text-formatting application). 

==History==
===CTSS===
&quot;roff&quot; is a descendant of the RUNOFF program by Jerry Saltzer, which ran on CTSS. Douglas McIlroy and Robert Morris wrote codice_1 for Multics in BCPL based on Saltzer&#x27;s program written in MAD assembler. Their program in turn was &quot;transliterated&quot; by Ken Thompson into PDP-7 assembler language for his early Unix operating system, circa 1970.

When the first PDP-11 was acquired for Unix in late 1970, the justification cited to management for the funding required was that it was to be used as a word processing system, and so &quot;roff&quot; was quickly transliterated again, into PDP-11 assembly, in 1971.

&quot;roff&quot; printed the man pages for Versions 1 through 3 of Unix, and when the Bell Labs patent department began using it, it became the first Unix application with an outside client. Dennis Ritchie noted that the ability to rapidly modify &quot;roff&quot; (because it was locally written software) to provide special features was an important factor in leading to the adoption of Unix by the patent department to fill its word processing needs. This in turn gave Unix enough credibility inside Bell Labs to secure the funding to purchase one of the first PDP-11/45s produced.

<doc id="172798" wikidata="Q724815" url="?curid=172798" title="San Ignacio, Belize">
<text>San Ignacio and Santa Elena are towns in western Belize. San Ignacio serves as the cultural-economic hub of Cayo District. It got its start from mahogany and chicle production during British colonisation. Over time it attracted people from the surrounding areas, which led to the diverse population of the town today. San Ignacio is the largest settlement in Cayo District and the second largest in the country, after Belize City.

==History==

The town was originally named El Cayo by the Spanish. On 19 October 1904, El Cayo was officially declared a town by the government of British Honduras. In the past a creek ran between the Macal and the Mopan rivers one mile outside of San Ignacio going toward Benque Viejo. This creek then fulfilled the definition of an area of land completely surrounded by water and thus the name Cayo, &quot;island&quot;. There was a large wooden bridge across this creek in the late 1940s, but since the creek eventually dried up, the area was filled with limestone gravel and today there remains no evidence of its existence. The demise of the creek, however, took away the distinction for the classification of a &#x27;cayo&#x27; from the venerable western town of &#x27;El Cayo&#x27; and returned it to a regular land mass.

==Geography==
San Ignacio is situated on the banks of the Macal River, about 63 miles (101 km) west of Belize City and 22 miles (35 km) west of the country&#x27;s capital: Belmopan. The town has an area of approximately .

==Demographics==

The population is largely Mestizo, followed by Kriol, and some Lebanese and Mopan Maya. San Ignacio also boasts a fairly large Chinese population, most of whom emigrated from Guangzhou in waves in the mid-20th century. The Mennonite community of Spanish Lookout is situated a few miles outside San Ignacio. The 2010 census counted 17,878 inhabitants in San Ignacio and Santa Elena, of whom 8,751 are males and 9,127 are females. The total number of households is 4,351 and the average household size is 4.1.

===Santa Elena===
In recent years San Ignacio has absorbed the formerly separate town of Santa Elena. San Ignacio and its sister-town Santa Elena make up Belize&#x27;s third largest urban area. The two towns are connected by Belize&#x27;s only suspension bridge, the one-lane Hawkesworth Bridge across the Macal river, built in 1949 and another one lane, low lying wooden bridge at the market and a two lane bridge, the Santa Elena Bridge constructed in 2018. The two are collectively referred to as the &quot;Twin Towns&quot; although San Ignacio has a larger population. , Santa Elena has a population of 7,389 compared with San Ignacio&#x27;s population of 10,489.

==Government==

San Ignacio is currently governed by a town council affiliated with the United Democratic Party (UDP). The mayor is Earl Trapp, also of the UDP. Town council elections are held every three years to elect the mayor and council. Both UDP and People&#x27;s United Party (PUP) candidates participate in town elections. The next municipal elections are scheduled for the year 2020.

At the national level, the San Ignacio/Santa Elena area is represented by three constituencies in the Belize House of Representatives, Cayo Central, Cayo North and Cayo North East.

==Educational institutions==
San Ignacio has three main colleges. Sacred Heart College of Catholic denomination is the largest institution, with both a high school and a junior college division, and is one of the largest high schools in Belize. Eden Seventh Day Adventist High School and Saint Ignatius High School (Catholic) are also found here.

Galen University was founded in 2003 and is located at Central Farm, a couple of minutes east of San Ignacio. The University of Belize also has an agricultural campus next to Galen.

==Health care==
The city is served by the San Ignacio Hospital, which is a regional clinic, and the Loma Luz Adventist hospital in Santa Elena. It also has various clinics, doctors and pharmacies scattered around town, and &quot;the only official medical electives program run by Belizians.&quot;

==Attractions==
The area around San Ignacio is one of the most popular parts of the country for tourism. Nearby attractions include the ancient Maya ruins of Caracol, Xunantunich, Cahal Pech, and El Pilar. Notable caves to explore include the Actun Tunichil Muknal cave, which includes skeletons, ceramics, and stoneware, and Barton Creek Cave, which is popular among adventure tourists interested in cave canoeing. 

Also popular among adventure travelers are nature reserves such as the Chaa Creek Nature Reserve, and the Mountain Pine Ridge Forest Reserve. A day trip to Mountain Pine Ridge allows visitors to go on several hikes and visit waterfalls, caves, and Maya ruins.

<text>GNU Libtool is a software development tool, part of the GNU build system, consisting of a shell script created to address the software portability problem when compiling shared libraries from source code.
It hides the differences between computing platforms for the commands which compile shared libraries.
It provides a command-line interface that is identical across platforms and it executes the platform&#x27;s native commands.

== Rationale ==

Different operating systems handle shared libraries differently.
Some platforms do not use shared libraries at all.
It can be difficult to make a software program portable: the C compiler differs from system to system; certain library functions are missing on some systems; header files may have different names.

Libtool helps manage the creation of static and dynamic libraries on various Unix-like operating systems.
Libtool accomplishes this by abstracting the library-creation process, hiding differences between various systems (e.g. Linux systems vs. Solaris).

GNU Libtool is designed to simplify the process of compiling a computer program on a new system, by &quot;encapsulating both the platform-specific dependencies, and the user interface, in a single script&quot;.

When porting a program to a new system, Libtool is designed so the porter need not read low-level documentation for the shared libraries to be built, rather just run a &quot;configure&quot; script (or equivalent).
== Use ==

Libtool is used by Autoconf and Automake, two other portability tools in the GNU build system.
It can also be used directly.
== Clones and derivatives ==

Since GNU Libtool was released, other free software projects have created drop-in replacements under different software licenses. slibtool is one such implementation.

<doc id="172801" wikidata="Q710323" url="?curid=172801" title="Jim Diamond (singer)">
<text>James Aaron Diamond (28 September 1951 – 8 October 2015) was a Scottish singer-songwriter, best known for his three top 5 hits: &quot;I Won&#x27;t Let You Down&quot; (1982), as the lead singer of PhD; and his solo performances &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot;, a United Kingdom No. 1 in 1984, and &quot;Hi Ho Silver&quot;, the theme song from &quot;Boon&quot;, which reached No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart in 1986.

==Early life and career==
Diamond was born in the Bridgeton area in the East End of Glasgow in 1951.

He started his music career at the age of 15 with Tony Divers band, The Method. When aged 16, he also fronted a Glasgow band called Jade. That line-up included bassist Chris Glen who went on to play with the Sensational Alex Harvey Band, and Jim Lacey on lead guitar who later went on to join the Alan Bown Set. Jade played many pub, club and university gigs in London in 1969, playing at Brunel University, West London College in Cricklewood, The Pied Bull in Islington, West Hampstead Country Club, another college in Virginia Water and many more in 1969. They also supported The Move on their Scottish tour with The Stoics in the same year.

Alexis Korner then discovered Diamond, who spent the next couple of years as part of Korner&#x27;s band. He provided additional and backing vocals on many of Korner&#x27;s songs, most of which would appear on &quot;The Lost Album&quot;.

Diamond left Korner in 1976, to form Bandit. The line-up included future AC/DC member Cliff Williams. They were soon signed up by Arista Records and released a début album, &quot;Bandit&quot;, which failed to reach the chart. In 1979, Diamond was lead vocalist for a Japanese band called BACCO, whose debut album was &quot;Cha Cha Me&quot;.

He went to Los Angeles, California to form Slick Diamond with Earl Slick. He spent some time touring and recording and provided music for a film soundtrack. He wrote the lyrics to many songs on Carmen Maki&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;Night Stalker&quot;.

==Big break==
In 1981, Diamond formed PhD (Phillips, Hymas and Diamond), with pianist/keyboard player Tony Hymas and drummer Simon Phillips. They were signed by WEA Records and had a hit single with the multi-million selling &quot;I Won&#x27;t Let You Down&quot;.

The band later decided to part ways. In 1984, he decided to go solo and was signed to A&amp;M Records. He had a number-one hit with &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot;, and was also number one in Latin America. Bob Geldof praised Diamond for publicly encouraging fans to buy the Band Aid single instead of his own.

He scored another hit soon afterward with the theme song from &quot;Boon&quot;, &quot;Hi Ho Silver&quot;. It reached No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart in May 1986. Diamond is also known for some guest vocals on two Genesis band members&#x27; solo outings, including:
*&quot;You Call This Victory&quot; (from the movie &quot;Starship&quot;) on the album &quot;Soundtracks&quot; by Tony Banks in 1986.
*&quot;Days of Long Ago&quot; on the album &quot;Darktown&quot; by Steve Hackett in 1999.

The 1999 compilation &quot;The Best of Jim Diamond&quot; compiles singles and B-sides from his short time with A&amp;M Records.

==Later years==
In the late 1990s, Diamond teamed up with saxophonist Chris &quot;Snake&quot; Davis, known for his work with soul outfit M People. The pair were known as The Blue Shoes, but were later billed as Jim Diamond and Snake Davis.

In 2005, Diamond released his first studio album in eleven years, &quot;Souled and Healed&quot;. The singles &quot;When You Turn&quot; and &quot;Blue Shoes&quot; were released from this. In 2009 he re-united with Tony Hymas to produce a third PhD album entitled &quot;Three&quot;.

Jim Diamond&#x27;s last album, &quot;City of Soul&quot;, released by Camino Records in 2011, featured among others Wet Wet Wet drummer Tommy Cunningham and Greg Kane of Hue and Cry. All proceeds from this album of soul music covers benefited the children&#x27;s charity, Radio Clyde Cash for Kids.

==Personal life and death==
Diamond married Christine Bailey in 1978. The couple had two children; their son Lawrence is the keyboard player of the UK indie pop group Citizens! and the former bass player of Official Secrets Act.

In the early 1980s, Diamond contracted hepatitis.

Diamond died in his sleep on 8 October 2015, at the age of 64. According to his daughter Sara, the cause of death was a pulmonary edema.

<doc id="172803" wikidata="Q57239" url="?curid=172803" title="Ludwig Tieck">
<text>Johann Ludwig Tieck (; ; 31 May 177328 April 1853) was a German poet, fiction writer, translator, and critic. He was one of the founding fathers of the Romantic movement in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

==Early life==
Tieck was born in Berlin, the son of a rope-maker. His siblings were the sculptor Christian Friedrich Tieck and the poet Sophie Tieck. He was educated at the , where he learned Greek and Latin, as required in most preparatory schools. He also began learning Italian at a very young age, from a grenadier with whom he became acquainted. Through this friendship, Tieck was given a first-hand look at the poor, which could be linked to his work as a Romanticist. He later attended the universities of Halle, Göttingen, and Erlangen. At Göttingen, he studied Shakespeare and Elizabethan drama.

On returning to Berlin in 1794, Tieck attempted to make a living by writing. He contributed a number of short stories (1795–98) to the series &quot;Straussfedern&quot;, published by the bookseller C. F. Nicolai and originally edited by J. K. A. Musäus. He also wrote &quot;Abdallah&quot; (1796) and a novel in letters, &quot;William Lovell&quot; (3 vols, 1795–96).

==Adoption of Romanticism==
Tieck&#x27;s transition to Romanticism is seen in the series of plays and stories published under the title &quot;Volksmärchen von Peter Lebrecht&quot; (3 vols., 1797), a collection containing the fairy tale &quot;Der blonde Eckbert&quot;, which blends exploration of the paranoiac mind with the realm of the supernatural, and a witty dramatic satire on Berlin literary taste, &quot;Der gestiefelte Kater&quot;. With his school and college friend Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder (1773–1798), he planned the novel &quot;Franz Sternbalds Wanderungen&quot; (vols. i–ii. 1798) which, with Wackenroder&#x27;s &quot;Herzensergiessungen&quot; (1796), was the first expression of the Romantic enthusiasm for old German art.

In 1798 Tieck married and in the following year settled in Jena, where he, the two brothers August and Friedrich Schlegel, and Novalis were the leaders of the early Romantic school (also known as Jena Romanticism). His writings between 1798 and 1804 include the satirical drama, &quot;Prinz Zerbino&quot; (1799), and &quot;Romantische Dichtungen&quot; (2 vols., 1799–1800). The latter contains Tieck&#x27;s most ambitious dramatic poems, &quot;Leben und Tod der heiligen Genoveva&quot;, &quot;Leben und Tod des kleinen Rotkäppchens&quot;, which were followed in 1804 by the &quot;comedy&quot; in two parts, &quot;Kaiser Oktavianus&quot;. These dramas are typical plays of the first Romantic school. Although formless and destitute of dramatic qualities, they show the influence of both Calderón and Shakespeare. &quot;Kaiser Oktavianus&quot; is a poetic glorification of the Middle Ages.

In 1801 Tieck went to Dresden, then lived for a time at Ziebingen near Frankfurt (Oder), and spent many months in Italy. In 1803 he published a translation of &quot;Minnelieder aus der schwäbischen Vorzeit&quot;, then between 1799 and 1804 an excellent version of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, and in 1811 two volumes of Elizabethan dramas, &quot;Altenglisches Theater&quot;. From 1812 to 1817 he collected in three volumes a number of his earlier stories and dramas, under the title &quot;Phantasus&quot;. In this collection appeared the stories &quot;Der Runenberg&quot;, &quot;Die Elfen&quot;, &quot;Der Pokal&quot;, and the dramatic fairy tale &quot;Fortunat&quot;.

In 1817 Tieck visited England in order to collect materials for a work on Shakespeare, which was never finished. In 1819 he settled permanently in Dresden, and from 1825 he was literary adviser to the Court Theatre. His semi-public readings from the dramatic poets gave him a reputation which extended far beyond the capital of the Kingdom of Saxony. The new series of short stories which he began to publish in 1822 also won him a wide popularity. Notable among these are &quot;Die Gemälde&quot;, &quot;Die Reisenden&quot;, &quot;Die Verlobung&quot;, and &quot;Des Lebens Überfluss&quot;.

More ambitious and on a wider canvas are the historical or semi-historical novels &quot;Dichterleben&quot; (1826), &quot;Der Aufruhr in den Cevennen&quot; (1826, unfinished), and &quot;Der Tod des Dichters&quot; (1834). &quot;Der junge Tischlermeister&quot; (1836; but begun in 1811) is a work written under the influence of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Apprenticeship&quot;. His story of &quot;Vittoria Accorombona&quot; (1840) was written in the style of the French Romanticists and shows a falling-off.

==Later years==

In later years Tieck carried on a varied literary activity as a critic (&quot;Dramaturgische Blätter&quot;, 2 vols., 1825–1826; &quot;Kritische Schriften&quot;, 2 vols., 1848). He also edited the translation of Shakespeare by August Wilhelm Schlegel, who was assisted by Tieck&#x27;s daughter Dorothea (1790–1841) and by Wolf Heinrich, Graf von Baudissin (1789–1878); &quot;Shakespeares Vorschule&quot; (2 vols., 1823–1829); and the works of Heinrich von Kleist (1826) and of Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz (1828). In 1841 Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia invited Tieck to Berlin, where he received a pension for his remaining years. He died in Berlin on 28 April 1853.

==Literary significance==
Tieck&#x27;s importance lay in the readiness with which he adapted himself to the emerging new ideas which arose at the close of the 18th century, as well as his Romantic works, such as &quot;Der blonde Eckbert&quot;. However, his importance in German poetry is restricted to his early period. In later years it was as the helpful friend and adviser of others, or as the well-read critic of wide sympathies, that Tieck distinguished himself.

Tieck also influenced Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;. It was from &quot;Phantasus&quot; that Wagner based the idea of Tannhäuser going to see the Pope and of Elisabeth dying in the song battle.

German composer Wilhelmine Schwertzell (1787-1863) used Tieck’s text in her songs “Herbstlied” and “Aus Genoveva.”

==Works==
Tieck&#x27;s &quot;Schriften&quot; appeared in twenty volumes (1828–1846), and his &quot;Gesammelte Novellen&quot; in twelve (1852–1854). &quot;Nachgelassene Schriften&quot; were published in two volumes in 1855. There are several editions of &quot;Ausgewählte Werke&quot; by H. Welti (8 vols., 1886–1888); by J. Minor (in Kirschner&#x27;s &quot;Deutsche Nationalliteratur&quot;, 144, 2 vols., 1885); by G. Klee (with an excellent biography, 3 vols., 1892), and G. Witkowski (4 vols., 1903) and Marianne Thalmann (4 vols., 1963–66).

==Translations==
&quot;The Enchanted Castle&quot;, &quot;Auburn Egbert&quot; and &quot;Elfin-Land&quot; were translated in &quot;Popular Tales and Romances of the Northern Nations&quot; (1823). &quot;The Fair-haired Eckbert&quot;, &quot;The Trusty Eckart&quot;, &quot;The Runenberg&quot;, &quot;The Elves&quot; and &quot;The Goblet&quot; were translated by Thomas Carlyle in &quot;German Romance&quot; (1827), &quot;The Pictures&quot; and &quot;The Betrothal&quot; by Bishop Thirlwall (1825). A translation of &quot;Vittoria Accorombona&quot; was published in 1845. In the same year James Anthony Froude, Julius Hare and others collaborated in translating ten of Tieck&#x27;s stories, published as &quot;Tales from the &quot;Phantasus&quot; Etc.&quot; &quot;Des Lebens Überfluss&quot; was translated anonymously as &quot;The Superfluities of Life. A Tale Abridged from Tieck&quot; in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Edinburgh Magazine&quot; in February 1845, and again by E. N. Bennett as &quot;Life&#x27;s Luxuries&quot; in &quot;German Short Stories&quot; in the Oxford University Press &quot;World&#x27;s Classics&quot; series in 1934. &quot;The Journey into the Blue Distance&quot; (&quot;Das Alte Buch: oder Reise ins Blaue hinein&quot;, 1834). &quot;The Romance of Little Red Riding Hood&quot; (1801) was translated by Jack Zipes and included in his book &quot;The Trials and Tribulations of Little Red Riding Hood&quot; (1983).

<text>Frank A. Stevenson (born 1970) is a Norwegian software developer, and part-time cryptanalyst. He is primarily known for his exposition of weaknesses in the DVD Forum&#x27;s Content Scramble System (CSS). Although the cryptoanalysis was done independently, he is known for his relations to DeCSS, and appeared before the courts as a witness in the Jon Johansen court trial. He also gave a deposition for the DVD CCA v. McLaughlin, Bunner, et al. case.

Stevenson worked for Funcom as a game developer for many years, after which he moved to Kvaleberg to work on mobile phone software. In July 2010, Stevenson published information about vulnerabilities in the A5/1 encryption algorithm used by most 2G GSM networks, and also showed the &quot;Kraken&quot; software, that demonstrates that the crypto indeed can be broken with modest hardware.

<doc id="172809" wikidata="Q3783103" url="?curid=172809" title="DVD player">
<text>A DVD player is a machine that plays DVDs produced under both the DVD-Video and DVD-Audio technical standards, two different and incompatible standards. Some DVD players will also play audio CDs. DVD players are connected to a television to watch the DVD content, which could be a movie, a recorded TV show, or other content.

== History ==
The first DVD player is claimed to have been created by the Japanese electronics vendor Toshiba in November 1996, and the first to be released to US customers is claimed to have been by Sony in April 1997.

Some manufacturers originally announced that DVD players would be available as early as the middle of 1996. These predictions were too optimistic. Delivery was initially held up for &quot;political&quot; reasons of copy protection demanded by movie studios, but was later delayed by lack of movie titles. The first players appeared in Japan on November 1, 1996, followed by the United States on March 31, 1997, with distribution limited to only seven major cities for the first six months.

Fujitsu released the first DVD-ROM-equipped computer on November 6 in Great Britain. Toshiba released a DVD-ROM-equipped computer and a DVD-ROM drive in Japan in early 1997 (moved back from December which was moved back from November). DVD-ROM drives from Toshiba, Pioneer, Panasonic, Hitachi, and Sony began appearing in sample quantities as early as January 1997, but none were available before May. The first PC upgrade kits (a combination of DVD-ROM drive and hardware decoder card) became available from Creative Labs, Hi-Val, and Diamond Multimedia in April and May 1997. In 2014, every major PC manufacturer had models that include DVD-ROM drives.

The first DVD-Audio players were released in Japan by Pioneer in late 1999, but they did not play copy-protected discs. Matsushita (under the Panasonic and Technics labels) first released full-fledged players in July 2000 for $700 to $1,200. Sony released the first SACD players in May 1999 for $5,000. Pioneer&#x27;s first DVD-Audio players released in late 1999 also played SACD.

== Technical details ==
A DVD player has to be able to read a DVD in ISO – UDF version 1.02 format, and needs to read and obey the DVDs Regional lockout codes and display a warning if the player is not authorized to play the DVD.

To play a DVD smoothly, it needs to be able to decode the MPEG-2 video stream with a maximum bit rate of 10 Mbit/s at peak and 8 Mbit/s continuously.

A DVD player may be able to:
*Optionally decrypt the data with either CSS and/or Macrovision
*Decode sound in MP2, PCM or AC-3 format and output (with optional AC-3 to stereo downmixing) on stereo connector, optical or electric digital connector
*Output a video signal, either an analog one (in NTSC or PAL format) on the composite, S-Video, SCART, or component video connectors, or a digital one on the DVI or HDMI connectors.
*Jump to manually entered titles, chapters, and time stamps.

DVD players cannot play Blu-ray discs due to using different wavelength lasers (Blu-ray discs use a blue-violet laser, hence their name, rather than a red laser). However, Blu-ray players are typically backwards compatible, meaning they will play DVDs. Some are compatible with CD and other disc formats. The short-lived HD DVD format is also incompatible with DVD for the same reason, however, HD DVD players do play standard DVDs and CDs.

DVD players are largely controlled through a remote control. Built-in controls on the main unit&#x27;s panel such as a four-directional buttons vary depending on model. Some models may lack advanced built-in controls, making operation more dependent on the remote control.

== CD/DVD/AVI/MP4 playback ==
Additionally, most DVD players allow users to play audio CDs (CD-DA, MP3, etc.) and Video CDs (VCD). A few include a home cinema decoder (i.e. Dolby Digital, Digital Theater Systems (DTS)). Some newer devices also play videos in the MPEG-4 ASP video compression format (such as DivX) popular in the Internet.

== Progressive scan DVD player ==
A progressive scan DVD player is a DVD player that can produce video in a progressive scan format such as 480p (NTSC) or 576p (PAL). Players which can output resolutions higher than 480p or 576p are often called upconverting DVD players.

Before HDTVs became common, players were sold which could produce 480p or 576p. TVs with this feature were often in the upper price range of a manufacturer&#x27;s line. To utilize this feature, a TV or other display with a progressive scan input was needed. HDTVs usually have a progressive scan input; progressive scan inputs are less common on standard definition TVs (often called SDTVs.)

Some players have a feature called &quot;3:2 pulldown detection&quot; or &quot;inverse telecine&quot; which attempts to better handle the artifacts which result from differing film and video rates in conjunction with interlaced scanning of the film. However most line doublers used in these players are not able to achieve the anticipated inverse telecine functionality. (See Line doubler for details.)

Progressive scan output cannot use connections intended for interlaced video, such as composite video (single RCA terminated cable) and S-Video (Mini-DIN terminated cable). The following connection methods are common for using progressive scan:

* VGA (analog)
* SCART (using analog RGB-video in PAL areas)
* Component video (using three cables terminated with RCA connectors)
* DVI or HDMI (Most recent methods, supported by many newer HDTVs)

== Portable players ==
Most hardware DVD players must be connected to a television; there are portable players which have an attached LCD screen and stereo speakers. Portable DVD players are often used for long road trips and travel. They often have a plug for the 12 volt power jack in cars. Some models have two screens, so that two people in the back seat can both watch the movie. Other portable DVD players have a single screen that opens up like a laptop computer screen.

== Output ==

Due to multiple audio (and video) output devices, there are many outputs on a DVD player, such as an RCA jack, component outputs, and an HDMI output. Consumers may become confused with how to connect a player to a TV or amplifier. Most systems include an optional digital audio connector for this task, which is then paired with a similar input on the amplifier. The physical connection is typically RCA connectors or TOSLINK, which transmits a S/PDIF stream carrying either uncompressed digital audio (PCM) or the original compressed audio data (Dolby Digital, DTS, MPEG audio) to be decoded by the audio equipment.

=== Video ===
Video is another issue which continues to present the most problems. Early generations of DVD players usually outputted analog video only, via both composite video on an RCA jack and S-Video. However, neither connector was intended to be used for progressive video, and most later players sold then gained another set of connectors, component video, which keeps the three components of the video, luminance and two color differentials, on fully separate wires. This video information is taken directly from the DVD itself. The three components compare well to S-Video, which uses two wires, uniting and degrading the two color signals, and composite, which uses only wire one, uniting and degrading all three signals.

The connectors are further confused by using a number of different physical connectors on different player models, RCA or BNC, as well as using VGA cables in a non-standard way (VGA is normally analog RGB—a different, incompatible form of component video). Even worse, there are often two sets of component outputs, one carrying interlaced video, and the other progressive, or an interlaced/progressive switch (either a physical switch or a menu setting).

In Europe (but not most other PAL areas), SCART connectors are generally used, which can carry composite and analog RGB interlaced video signals (RGB can be progressive, but not all DVD players and displays support this mode) or Y/C (S-Video), as well as analog two-channel sound and automatic 4:3 or 16:9 (widescreen) switching on a single convenient multi-wire cable. The analog RGB component signal offers video quality which is superior to S-Video and identical to YPbPr component video. However, analog RGB and S-Video signals can not be carried simultaneously, due to each using the same pins for different uses, and displays often must be manually configured as to the input signal, since no switching mode exists for S-Video. (A switching mode does exist to indicate whether composite or RGB is being used.) Some DVD players and set-top boxes offer YPbPr component video signals over the wires in the SCART connector intended for RGB, though this violates the official specification and manual configuration is again necessary. (Hypothetically, unlike RGB component, YPbPr component signals and S-Video Y/C signals could both be sent over the wire simultaneously, since they share the luminance (Y) component.)

HDMI is a digital connection for carrying high-definition video, similar to DVI. Along with video, HDMI also supports up to eight-channel digital audio. DVD players with connectors for high-definition video can upconvert the source to formats used for higher definition video (e.g., 720p, 1080i, 1080p, etc.), before outputting the signal. By no means, however, will the resulting signal be high-definition video; that is, aside from optional deinterlacing, upconverting generally consists of merely scaling the video&#x27;s dimensions to match that of higher resolution formats, foregoing the scaling that would normally occur in the output device.

=== USB ===
Some DVD players include a USB video recorder. As well as such, there are also have DVD players with a USB port to be able to play digital media types as well as MP4, MP3, etc.

=== Wireless ===
Wireless connections (bluetooth and/or Wi-Fi) are useful to manage (play/record) wirelessly content from or to other devices (i.e. cell phones).

== Prices ==
, retail prices for such a device, depending on its optional features (such as digital sound or video output), start between 30 and 80 USD/Euro. They are usually cheaper than VCRs.

== Manufacture ==
 the largest producer of DVD players is China; in 2002 they produced 30 million players, more than 70% of the world output. These producers have to pay US$15–$20 per player in license fees, to the patent holders of the DVD technology (Sony, Philips, Toshiba) as well as for MPEG-2 licenses. To avoid these fees, China developed the Enhanced Versatile Disc standard as an intended successor of DVD; , EVD players were only being sold in China.

== Software ==
Software DVD players are programs that allow users to view DVD videos on a computer with a DVD-ROM drive. Some examples are PowerDVD, VLC media player, Windows DVD Player, and DVD Player on Mac.

Among others, there are variants &amp; huge kinds of software DVD players as well as multimedia player software which has DVD video playback capability, whether its proprietary-type (as commercial software), freeware, shareware or just a free software are available in the market.

== Successors ==
In the battle to succeed and to improve upon the role of the DVD player as the mainstream medium for stored audiovisual content on optical disc, there were two major contestants: the HD DVD player and the Blu-ray player, utilizing two incompatible technologies that reproduced higher resolution video images and more complete audio information than was possible with DVD. On February 19, 2008, Toshiba, creator of the former technology, announced it would cease production on all HD DVD products, leaving Blu-ray as the high definition successor to DVD players.

As technology improved, various players were sold, some of which were also Blu-ray players, that could upscale and up-convert DVD content, increasing the overall perceived picture quality.

<text>A news server is a collection of software used to handle Usenet articles. It may also refer to a computer itself which is primarily or solely used for handling Usenet. Access to Usenet is only available through news server providers.

==Articles and posts==
End users often use the term &quot;posting&quot; to refer to a single message or file posted to Usenet. For articles containing plain text, this is synonymous with an article. For binary content such as pictures and files, it is often necessary to split the content among multiple articles. Typically through the use of numbered Subject: headers, the multiple-article postings are automatically reassembled into a single unit by the newsreader. Most servers do not distinguish between single and multiple-part postings, dealing only at the level of the individual component articles.

===Headers and overviews===
Each news article contains a complete set of header lines, but in common use the term &quot;headers&quot; is also used when referring to the News Overview database. The overview is a list of the most frequently used headers, and additional information such as article sizes, typically retrieved by the client software using the NNTP command. Overviews make reading a newsgroup faster for both the client and server by eliminating the need to open each individual article to present them in list form.

If non-overview headers are required, such as for when using a kill file, it may still be necessary to use the slower method of reading all the complete article headers. Many clients are unable to do this, and limit filtering to what is available in the summaries.

==News server attributes==
Among the operators and users of commercial news servers, common concerns are the continually increasing storage and network capacity requirements and their effects. Completion (the ability of a server to successfully receive all traffic), retention (the amount of time articles are made available to readers) and overall system performance. With the increasing demands, it is common for the transit and reader server roles to be subdivided further into numbering, storage and front end systems. These server farms are continually monitored by both insiders and outsiders, and measurements of these characteristics are often used by consumers when choosing a commercial news service.

=== Speed ===
Speed, in relation to Usenet, is how quickly a server can deliver an article to the user. The server that the user connects to is typically part of a server farm that has many servers dedicated to multiple tasks. How fast the data can move throughout this farm is the first thing that affects the speed of delivery.

The speed of data traveling throughout the farm can be severely bottlenecked through hard drive operations. Retrieving the article and overview information can cause massive stress on hard drives. To combat this, caching technology and cylindrical file storage systems have been developed. 

Once the farm is able to deliver the data to the network, then the provider has limited control over the speed to the user. Since the network path to each user is different, some users will have good routes and the data will flow quickly. Other users will have overloaded routers between them and the provider which will cause delays. About all a provider can do in that case is try moving the traffic through a different route. If the ISP has limited connectivity to the network, routing changes may have little effect.

Frequently a user can reduce the impact of network problems by using multiple connections. Some servers allow as many as 60 simultaneous connections, but this varies widely based on the provider.

===Article sizes===
Article sizes are limited to what each news server will accept. The larger the article size, the more space it occupies, and thus the fewer articles on each server. This generally means that a server can run with less overhead which makes for a more efficient server, but gives less articles for users to access.

===Retention===
Retention is simply defined as how long the server keeps articles. Historically, most users want retention to be long enough so that they don&#x27;t need to access the server every day but not overly long retention that can overwhelm users with slow computers or network connections. In the modern era, high speed connections, large storage capacity, and advanced search tools allows users to utilize extensive retention without any drawbacks.

Retention is generally quoted separately for text and binary articles, though it may also vary between different groups within these categories. The times vary greatly according to the amount of storage available on the servers and continually increasing traffic. As of 2009, it is common for average news providers to have text retention of over 1000 days and binary retention of over 200 days. Large news providers offer text retention up to 2480 days and binary retention of 850 days or more. It&#x27;s important to understand that retention time varies between different newsgroups within the text and binary categories. Omicron&#x27;s HW Media is currently the Usenet server with the highest amount of binary retention, while Google is the Usenet server with the highest amount of text retention.

It can be difficult for end users to accurately measure the retention of a server. One common method is to examine the oldest articles in a group and examine the date, but this is not always accurate. Some articles in a group may be retained for longer than others, articles from remote servers do not always arrive promptly, and at times the date headers are simply incorrect. A sampling of many or all articles, preferably in more than one newsgroup, is required to detect such anomalies.

News servers do not have unlimited storage, and due to this fact they can only hold posts for a length of time before they must delete them in order to make room for new posts. This is a particular problem to binary newsgroups which transmit large volumes of articles.

For news servers provided by Internet Service Providers as part of a user&#x27;s subscription package, typical retention rates are usually only 2–4 days. To deal with the increase of Usenet traffic, many providers turn to a hybrid system, in which old articles not found on the provider&#x27;s server will request the article from another server with longer retention.

===Completion===
Given the large number of articles transferred between servers and the large size of individual articles, their complete propagation to any one server farm is not guaranteed. The term &quot;completion&quot; is used to describe how well a service is keeping up with the traffic.

The primary obstacle to calculating the completion percentage is how many articles were posted. Looking at only one server, one cannot know how many articles were actually inserted throughout the network. Articles may never make their way outside the originating server, or may fail to find their way out to the transit cloud. Very large articles are frequently dropped, and tend to propagate less well than smaller ones.

One way to measure completion is to access multiple servers and retrieve lists of articles. Because Message-ID: headers are nominally unique throughout the network, comparison of the lists is mostly a straightforward task. Practical limitations to this type of measurement include the impossibility of obtaining lists from all servers worldwide, the fact that many servers filter out spam or employ Usenet Death Penalties, and that some servers mask incompletion by hiding multipart binary sets with missing articles. It is also necessary to take into account propagation times and retention; an article may simply have not yet arrived at a given server, or it may have been present but already expired. 

==News server operation==
===Peering===
All Usenet servers peer with one or more other servers in order to exchange articles. Occasionally, new servers appear. Although there are several web resources which may aid in finding peers, a better resource is the newsgroup news.admin.peering (Google Groups portal). 

As of 2020, text feeds can usually be attained for free, while full binary feeds can be free or paid (depending on how many articles each server sends to the other). Due to the large amount of data in a full binary+text Usenet feed (can be high as 30 terabytes a day) and the high costs of transmitting that data through an IP transit provider like Cogent, Telia, or Zayo, most Usenet providers will only engage in binary peering when they are interconnected at an Internet exchange like AMS-IX, SIX, or DeCIX.

===Spools===
When the server stores the body of an article, it places it in a disk storage area generically called a &quot;spool&quot;. There are several common ways in which the spool may be organized:

*One file per article is the oldest storage scheme, still in common use on smaller servers and replicated in many clients. Its performance capability is a direct function of the underlying operating system&#x27;s ability to create, remove and locate files within a directory, and often this scheme is insufficient to keep up with modern Usenet traffic. It does, however, allow for the greatest flexibility in managing the amount and location of storage used by the server. Nearly all current software using this scheme stores articles using the B News 2.10 layout.
*Cyclical storage has been in increasingly common use since the 1990s. In this storage method, articles are appended serially to large indexed container files. When the end of the file is reached, new articles are written at the beginning of the file, overwriting the oldest entries. On some servers, this overwriting is not performed, but instead new container files are created as older ones are deleted. The major advantages of this system include predictable storage requirements if an overwriting scheme is employed, and some freedom from dependency on the underlying performance of the operating system. There is, however, less flexibility to retain articles by age rather than space used, and traditional text manipulation tools such as grep are less well suited to analyzing these files. Some degree of article longevity control can be exercised by directing subsets of the newsgroups to specific sets of container files.
*In some cases, a relational database or similar is used to contain the spool. This is most commonly seen with Internet forum software that also offers an NNTP interface. 
*Some servers, such as INN, allow multiple storage schemes to be used at once. Various hybrid storage schemes have also been used in news servers, including different organizations of the file-per-article method, or smaller containers carrying perhaps 100 articles apiece.

==Types of Servers==
A &quot;reader server&quot; provides an interface to read and post articles, generally with the assistance of a news client. A &quot;transit server&quot; exchanges articles with other servers. Most servers can provide both functions.

===Transit server===
Modern transit servers usually use NNTP to exchange news continually over the Internet and similar always-on connections. In the past, servers normally employed the UUCP protocol, which was designed for intermittent dial-up connections. Other &quot;ad hoc&quot; protocols, including e-mail, are less commonly seen. News servers normally connect with multiple peers, with the redundancy helping to spread loads and ensure that articles are not lost. Smaller sites, called &quot;leaf nodes&quot;, are connected to one other major server.

Articles are routed based on information found in the header lines defined in RFC 1036. Of particular interest to a transit server are:

*&quot;Message-ID&quot; – a globally unique key
*&quot;Newsgroups&quot; – a list of one or more newsgroups where the article is intended to appear
*&quot;Distribution&quot; – (optional) a supplement to Newsgroups, used to restrict circulation of articles.
*&quot;Date&quot; – the time when the article was created
*&quot;Path&quot; – a list of the servers an article passed through on its way to the local server
*&quot;Expires&quot; – (optional) the time when it is requested that the article be deleted
*&quot;Approved&quot; – (optional) indicates an article that has been accepted for a moderated newsgroup
*&quot;Control&quot; – (optional) contains command requests

In most cases, the sending server controls the article transfer process. It compares the Newsgroups and Distribution of each newly arrived article against a set of patterns called &quot;newsfeeds&quot;, listing each remote server and the newsgroups its operator wishes to receive. Some senders also examine the Path; if the receiving server appears in this line, it is not offered. Other local rules may also be added. The sender transmits matching articles&#x27; Message-IDs to the receiving server. The receiver indicates which Message-IDs it has not yet stored locally, and those articles are sent.

The receiving server examines the incoming articles. A message is normally discarded if the Message-ID is duplicated by an article already received (i.e., another server sent it in the meantime), the Date or Expires lines indicate that the article is too old, the header syntax appears to be invalid, the Approved header is missing for a moderated newsgroup, or additional local rules disallow it. Most servers also maintain a list of active newsgroups. If the Newsgroups header of a new article does not match the active list, it may be discarded or placed in a special &quot;junk&quot; newsgroup. Once the article is stored, the server attempts to retransmit it to any servers in its own newsfeed list.

Articles with Control lines are given special handling. They are typically filed in special &quot;control&quot; newsgroups and may cause the server to automatically carry out exceptional actions. The &quot;codice_1&quot; and &quot;codice_2&quot; commands can cause newsgroups to be created or removed; &quot;codice_3&quot; can be used to reconcile the local active list with a commonly accepted set; and &quot;codice_4&quot; commands are used to request the deletion of a specific article. &quot;codice_5&quot; and &quot;codice_6&quot; are sometimes used with UUCP to transmit lists of offered and wanted Message-IDs. Other commands (&quot;codice_7&quot;, &quot;codice_8&quot;, and &quot;codice_9&quot;) are requests for server configuration details. Once used to create network maps, they now are generally obsolete.

===Reader server===
A reader server is one that makes the articles available in the hierarchical disk directory format originated by B News 2.10, or offers the NNTP or IMAP commands, for use by newsreaders. A reader server typically also works as a transit server, but it may operate independently or serve as an alternative interface to an Internet forum. When receiving news, this type of server must perform the additional steps of filing articles into newsgroups and assigning sequential numbers within each group. An &quot;Xref&quot; line is usually added, listing all the groups where the message appears and the sequence numbers. Unlike Message IDs, the numbers and ordering of articles will differ on each server; but related servers may force agreement by operating in a slave mode, re-using their siblings&#x27; Xref lines. Reader servers typically also maintain a News Overview (NOV) database that allows newsreaders to quickly obtain message summaries and present messages in threaded form.

Most reader servers support posting, either through NNTP or a special &quot;inews&quot; program. When an article is posted, the process is much the same as when a transit server receives news, but with additional checks. For posting, the server will normally fill in missing Path and Message-ID lines and check the syntax of headers intended for human readers, such as &quot;From&quot; and &quot;Subject&quot;. If the article is posted to a moderated group, the server will attempt to mail it to the newsgroup moderator if the Approved header is absent. Additional identity checks and filters are also typically applied at this point.

===Hybrid or cache server===
Smaller sites with limited network bandwidth may operate &quot;sucking&quot; or cache servers. These perform the same reader server role as conventional news servers, but themselves act as newsreaders to exchange articles with other reader servers. Hybrid servers allow greater flexibility for the server operator in that received groups can be adjusted without manual intervention by operators. They may also be the only available means to obtain articles from remote servers that do not offer conventional feeding.

Because hybrid servers usually use the posting function to send news, article headers are reformatted by the posting function and tracing information can be lost. Also, the delayed sucking process can result in excess activity on the remote reader servers. For these reasons, the use of hybrid servers is often discouraged or disallowed without prior agreement.

<doc id="172813" wikidata="Q252248" url="?curid=172813" title="Link Wray">
<text>Fred Lincoln &quot;Link&quot; Wray Jr. (May 2, 1929 – November 5, 2005) was an American guitarist, songwriter, and vocalist who became popular in the late 1950s. His 1958 instrumental single &quot;Rumble&quot;, reached the top 20 in the United States; and was one of the earliest songs in rock music to utilize distortion and tremolo.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Wray at No. 45 on its list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time. He received two nominations for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, prior to being inducted in the Musical Influence category in 2023.

==Early life==
Wray was born on May 2, 1929, in Dunn, North Carolina, to Fred Lincoln Wray Sr. and Lillian Mae (née Coats), whom her son identified as being of Shawnee descent. He recalled living in very harsh conditions during childhood, in mud huts, without electricity or heating, going to school barefoot, barely clothed. He recounted that his family experienced discrimination, including times when they had to hide from the Ku Klux Klan. Wray later said: &quot;The cops, the sheriff, the drugstore owner—they were all Ku Klux Klan. They put the masks on and, if you did something wrong, they&#x27;d tie you to a tree and whip you or kill you.&quot; His family listed themselves as White on census records. Three songs Wray performed during his career were named for Indigenous peoples: &quot;Shawnee&quot;, &quot;Apache&quot;, and &quot;Comanche&quot;.

Wray lived with his family in Portsmouth, Virginia from 1942 until 1955. He and his brothers Ray and Doug (born July 4, 1933 – died April 29, 1984) drove cabs during the day while working at night clubs in the Portsmouth and Norfolk, Virginia area. Wray&#x27;s first bands, The Lucky Wray Band and The Palomino Ranch Gang, formed in Portsmouth and included brothers Ray, Doug, and Vernon (born January 7, 1924 – died March 26, 1979) and two other musicians, Dixie Neal and Shorty Horton.

Wray served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War (1950–53). He contracted tuberculosis, which hospitalized him for a year. His stay concluded with the removal of a lung, which doctors predicted would mean he would never be able to sing again.

==Career==
Building on the distorted electric guitar sound of early records, Wray&#x27;s first hit was the 1958 instrumental &quot;Rumble&quot;. The record was first released on Cadence Records (catalog number 1347) as by &quot;Link Wray &amp; His Ray Men&quot;. &quot;Rumble&quot; was banned in New York and Boston for fear that it would incite teenage gang violence, &quot;rumble&quot; being slang for a gang fight.

Before, during, and after his stints with major labels Epic and Swan, Wray released 45s under many names. Tiring of the corporate music machine, he began recording albums using a three-track studio he converted from an outbuilding on his brother&#x27;s property that his father used to raise chickens, in Accokeek, Maryland. He wrote and recorded the LP &quot;Link Wray&quot; (1971), on which he wrote about his frustrations. The Neville Brothers have recorded two tracks from it, &quot;Fallin&#x27; Rain&quot; and &quot;Fire and Brimstone&quot;.

While living in the San Francisco Bay Area in the early 1970s, Wray was introduced to Quicksilver Messenger Service guitarist John Cipollina by bassist James &quot;Hutch&quot; Hutchinson. He subsequently formed a band initially featuring special guest Cipollina along with the rhythm section from Cipollina&#x27;s band Copperhead, bassist Hutch Hutchinson, and drummer David Weber. They opened for the band Lighthouse at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles from May 15–19, 1974. He later did numerous concerts and radio broadcasts in the Bay Area, including at KSAN and at promoter Bill Graham&#x27;s Winterland Ballroom venue, with Les Lizama later replacing Hutchinson on bass. He toured and recorded two albums with retro-rockabilly artist Robert Gordon in the late 1970s. The 1980s to the present day saw a large number of reissues as well as new material. One member of his band in the 1980s, session drummer Anton Fig, later became drummer in the CBS Orchestra on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. In 1994, he played on four songs of the album &quot;Chatterton&quot; by French rocker Alain Bashung. He went on to release two albums of new music: &quot;Shadowman&quot; (1997) and &quot;Barbed Wire&quot; (2000).

In November 2017, Easy Eye Records announced the future release of two recently discovered recordings, &quot;Son of Rumble&quot;, presumably a follow-up to 1958&#x27;s &quot;Rumble&quot;, and &quot;Whole Lotta Talking&quot;, recorded in 1970. The recordings were issued as a 45rpm single in April 2018.
Easy Eye released another 45rpm single of newly discovered/unreleased material for RSD 2019, &quot;Vernon&#x27;s Diamond&quot; b/w &quot;My Brother, My Son&quot;. &quot;Vernon&#x27;s Diamond&quot; was recorded circa 1958-59 and is an early version of &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;, and &quot;My Brother, My Son&quot; was recorded at the same sessions as &quot;Whole Lotta Talking&quot; in 1970. 

==Personal life and death==

Wray&#x27;s first three marriages, to Elizabeth Canady Wray, Ethel Tidwell Wray, and Sharon Cole Wray, produced eight children. In the early 1980s, Wray relocated to Denmark and married Olive Poulsen, who became his manager.

Wray died of heart failure at his home in Copenhagen, on November 5, 2005, at the age of 76. He was survived by his nine children, 24 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. Wray was cremated, and his ashes were buried in the crypt of the Christian&#x27;s Church, Copenhagen.

== Musical style and influence ==

Link Wray&#x27;s 1950s recordings &quot;straddled country and rockabilly&quot;. He later performed surf influenced garage rock in the 1960s, swamp rock and country rock in the early 1970s and hard rock in the late 1970s and onward.

Wray is credited with inventing the power chord. According to AllMusic&#x27;s Cub Koda, Wray&#x27;s instrumental recordings starting with &quot;Rumble&quot; through his Swan singles in the early 1960s laid the blueprints for &quot;heavy metal, thrash, you name it.&quot; &quot;Rumble&quot; facilitated the emergence of &quot;punk and heavy rock&quot;, according to Jeremy Simmonds.

Wray has influenced a wide range of artists. Jimmy Page described Link Wray as having a &quot;real rebel attitude&quot; and credited Wray in the documentary &quot;It Might Get Loud&quot; as a major influence in his early career. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Pete Townshend of The Who once said, &quot;If it hadn&#x27;t been for Link Wray and &#x27;Rumble,&#x27; I never would have picked up a guitar.&quot; Mark E. Smith of The Fall wrote in his autobiography: &quot;The only people I ever really looked up to were Link Wray and Iggy Pop... Guys like [Wray] are very special to me.&quot; Iggy Pop and Neil Young have also cited Wray as an influence on their work.
Bob Dylan refers to Wray in his song &quot;Sign Language&quot;, which he recorded as a duet with Eric Clapton in 1975: &quot;Link Wray was playin&#x27; on a juke box I was payin&#x27;/ for the words I was saying, so misunderstood/he didn&#x27;t do me no good&quot; Both Dylan and Bruce Springsteen performed Wray&#x27;s tune &quot;Rumble&quot; in concert as a tribute to the influential musician upon his 2005 death. In 2007, musician Steven Van Zandt inducted Link Wray into the Native American Music Hall of Fame with a tribute performance by his grandson Chris Webb and Native artist Gary Small.

==Discography==
===Singles===
Wray was a featured collaborator on Robert Gordon&#x27;s 1977 single &quot;Red Hot&quot; (Private Stock 45–156). The single peaked at No. 83 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

<doc id="172814" wikidata="Q489801" url="?curid=172814" title="INXS">
<text>INXS (a phonetic play on &quot;in excess&quot;) were an Australian rock band, formed as the Farriss Brothers in 1977 in Sydney. The founding members were bassist Garry Gary Beers, main composer and keyboardist Andrew Farriss, drummer Jon Farriss, guitarist Tim Farriss, lead singer and main lyricist Michael Hutchence, and guitarist and saxophonist Kirk Pengilly. For 20 years, INXS was fronted by Hutchence, whose magnetic stage presence made him the focal point of the band. Initially known for their new wave/pop style, the band later developed a harder pub rock style that included funk and dance elements.

In 1984, INXS had their first number-one hit in Australia with &quot;Original Sin&quot;. The band achieved international success in the mid-to-late 1980s and early 1990s with the hit albums &quot;Listen Like Thieves&quot;, &quot;Kick&quot;, and &quot;X&quot;, and the singles &quot;What You Need&quot;, &quot;Need You Tonight&quot; (the band&#x27;s only US number-one single), &quot;Devil Inside&quot;, &quot;Never Tear Us Apart&quot;, &quot;Suicide Blonde&quot; and &quot;New Sensation&quot;.

After Hutchence&#x27;s death on 22 November 1997, INXS made appearances with several guest singers, and toured and recorded with Jon Stevens as lead singer, beginning in 2000. In 2005, members of INXS participated in &quot;Rock Star: INXS&quot;, a reality television series that culminated in the selection of Canadian J.D. Fortune as their new lead singer. Irish singer-songwriter Ciaran Gribbin replaced Fortune as lead singer in 2011. During a concert on 11 November 2012, INXS stated that the performance would be their last, although they did not announce the band&#x27;s permanent retirement.

INXS has won six Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) awards, including three for &quot;Best Group&quot; in 1987, 1989 and 1992; the band was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2001. INXS has sold over 75 million albums worldwide, making them one of Australia&#x27;s highest selling music acts of all time.

==History==
===Early years===
The origins of the band began with Andrew Farriss convincing his fellow Davidson High School classmate, Michael Hutchence, to join his band, Doctor Dolphin. The band contained two further classmates, Kent Kerny and Neil Sanders, as well as Garry Beers and Geoff Kennely, both from a nearby high school, Forest High School. In 1977, Tim Farriss, Andrew&#x27;s older brother, invited Andrew, Hutchence and Beers to join him and his schoolmate Kirk Pengilly. Tim and Pengilly had been playing together since 1971 as either an acoustic duo, Kirk and Tim, or as a four-piece band called Guinness (named after their bass player&#x27;s dog). Together with younger brother Jon Farriss they formed &quot;The Farriss Brothers&quot;, who consisted of Garry Beers on bass guitar, Andrew Farriss on keyboards, Jon Farriss on drums, Tim Farriss on lead guitar, Michael Hutchence on lead vocals and Kirk Pengilly on guitar and saxophone. The band made their debut on 16 August 1977 at Whale Beach, 40 km (25 mi) north of Sydney.

The parents of the Farriss boys relocated to Perth, Western Australia in 1978, taking Jon to continue his schooling and as soon as Hutchence and Andrew finished school, the rest of the band followed. They briefly performed as The Vegetables, singing &quot;We Are the Vegetables&quot;, before returning to Sydney ten months later, where they recorded a set of demos. At a chance meeting in the car park of the Royal Antler, a pub in Narrabeen on the Northern Beaches of Sydney, New South Wales, Tim was approached by Gary Morris who was the manager of Midnight Oil.

The band began to regularly support Midnight Oil and other local bands. Morris advised that a member of the Oils crew had come up with a new name and suggested they change it to INXS. The name INXS was inspired by English band XTC and Australian jam makers IXL. Pengilly later explained that Morris was interested in turning the group into a Christian band, which the band briefly considered before rejecting the idea.

The band&#x27;s first performance as INXS was on 1 September 1979 at the Ocean Beach Hotel in Umina on the Central Coast of New South Wales and by the end of 1979, after passing on the Christian band image, they hired Chris &quot;CM&quot; Murphy as their manager and continued taking on the Oz pub circuit. Murphy was an adept business manager and negotiator and by early 1980 the band had signed a five-album record deal with a Sydney independent label, Deluxe Records, run by Michael Browning, a former manager of AC/DC.

===1980s===
====From &quot;Simple Simon&quot; to &quot;Shabooh Shoobah&quot;====

INXS released their first single, &quot;Simple Simon&quot;/&quot;We Are the Vegetables&quot;, in Australia and France in May 1980. The single had its debut TV performance on &quot;Simon Townsend&#x27;s Wonder World&quot;. Their self-titled debut album, &quot;INXS&quot;, was recorded at Trafalgar Studios in Annandale, Sydney. It was co-produced by the band and Duncan McGuire (ex-Ayers Rock), with all songs attributed to the entire band, at the insistence of Murphy. Deluxe gave them a budget of $10,000 to record the album, so to keep within the budget they had to record from midnight to dawn, usually after doing one or more performances earlier that night. The album was released in October 1980. It featured &quot;Just Keep Walking&quot; which was their first Australian Top 40 single, with the album peaking in the Top 30 of the Kent Music Report for Australian albums. The album eventually went gold (selling over 35,000 units) but it took a number of years to do so.

These early records demonstrated their new wave/ska/pop style, and were followed by near constant touring with almost 300 shows during 1981 as the band developed their status as a live act. In 1981, they signed Gary Grant as their tour manager, who then became co-manager a year later. Between touring commitments, the band released their third single in May 1981, &quot;The Loved One&quot;, which was a cover of a 1966 song by Australian group The Loved Ones. The song was recorded at Studios 301 in Sydney; it was produced by Richard Clapton and peaked in the Top 20.

The success of the single led to Clapton and the band returning to Studios 301 between July and August 1981 to create an album. In October 1981, their second album &quot;Underneath the Colours&quot; was released and became a hit in Australia peaking at No. 15.

Soon after recording sessions had finished, band members started work on outside projects. Beers, Jon and Andrew Farriss played on Clapton&#x27;s solo album, &quot;The Great Escape&quot;. Hutchence recorded &quot;Speed Kills&quot;, written by Don Walker of Cold Chisel for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Freedom&quot; directed by Scott Hicks. It was his first solo single and was released by WEA in early 1982. In January, INXS toured New Zealand as support act for Cold Chisel. Murphy eventually became convinced their future no longer lay with Deluxe Records.

RCA (who distributed Deluxe) had employed music lover Rockin Rod Woods, who had been promoting Eric Clapton, Split Enz and some of the world&#x27;s biggest acts. Woods was passionate about the band and brought key music people along to their gigs. He encouraged RCA to sign them worldwide because Murphy had played him some demos. Deluxe had been unable to attract international interest so the band decided to record a new song, &quot;The One Thing&quot; at their own expense, with Mark Opitz at Paradise Studios. The song turned out so well that Murphy hired Opitz to produce three more songs. Murphy approached WEA Australia with copies of the song, leading to INXS signing a recording deal in July 1982 with WEA for releases in Australia, South East Asia, Japan, New Zealand, Atco Records (a subsidiary of Atlantic Records) for North America, and PolyGram for Europe including the UK.

Murphy and the band were not entirely convinced that Opitz could produce an entire album that would attract international interest, so before recording their third album Pengilly, Hutchence, and Andrew Farriss visited the United Kingdom and USA, with a view to selecting a suitable producer, only to find that no one they wanted was available and that most people advised them that Opitz&#x27;s work on their single was as good as they could wish for.

To complete the band&#x27;s contract with DeLuxe Records, INXS produced their first compilation album, INXSIVE, released in early 1982 for the Australian market only, featuring highlights from the band&#x27;s first two studio albums, related B-sides, and two non-album singles.

In mid-1982 they began recording at Rhinoceros Studios with Opitz. In October 1982, &quot;Shabooh Shoobah&quot; was released internationally on Atlantic/Atco Records, peaking at No. 52 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 46 on the Hot Pop Albums chart. In Australia it peaked at No. 5 and remained in the albums charts for 94 weeks. The single &quot;The One Thing&quot; brought them their first Top 30 hit in United States peaking at No. 30 on 28 May 1983, It was also a Top 20 hit in Canada, and peaked at No. 14 in Australia on 23 August 1982. &quot;One Thing&quot; was their first video to air on the fledgling MTV and significantly added to the ultimate success of the single.

13 February 1983, saw INXS play the Stop The Drop nuclear disarmament concert to 14,000 at the Myer Music Bowl in Melbourne, alongside Midnight Oil, Colin Hay, Redgum and Goanna. It was simulcast on Australian TV by Channel 10 and Radio 2MMM.

INXS undertook their first US performance in San Diego in March 1983, to a crowd of 24 patrons. Their first tour was as support for Adam and the Ants, then support for Stray Cats, The Kinks, and Hall &amp; Oates followed by The Go-Go&#x27;s. INXS played alongside many of their contemporaries on New Wave Day in May 1983 at the &quot;US Festival&quot; in Devore, San Bernardino, California. During that time, their co-manager Gary Grant relocated permanently to New York City to ensure a continual presence in the northern hemisphere. The band remained on the road in the US for most of the year, including support for Men at Work and by mid-1983 were headlining venues such as The Ritz in New York.

====From &quot;Original Sin&quot; to &quot;Listen Like Thieves&quot;====

After a performance in Toronto the band was approached by producer Nile Rodgers; by September 1983, the band had recorded &quot;Original Sin&quot; (originally entitled &quot;Brand New Day&quot;) at New York&#x27;s Power Station Studios. Three tracks from &quot;Shabooh Shoobah&quot; were featured in the soundtrack for the 1984 film &quot;Reckless&quot;. The band then travelled to the UK to begin sessions on their fourth album with Nick Launay at the Manor Studios in Oxford.

The album &quot;The Swing&quot;, released in April 1984, received significant attention from around the world, as &quot;Original Sin&quot; became the band&#x27;s first No. 1 single in Australia and was popular worldwide with fans and reviewers. During 1984, the single reached no. 1 in Australia (for two weeks in January), Argentina, and France; No. 6 in New Zealand; No. 11 in Canada; No. 23 in Switzerland; No. 31 in the Netherlands; and No. 58 in the U.S. However, &quot;Original Sin&quot; was largely ignored in the U.K., and INXS would not have any Top 50 chart success in the United Kingdom until the 1985 album &quot;Listen Like Thieves&quot;.

During 1984, INXS toured non-stop, performing across Europe, the UK, the US and Australia. By December 1984, &quot;The Swing&quot; had gone double platinum, making it one of the five biggest domestic albums in the history of Australian music at the time.

In March 1985, the band returned to Sydney&#x27;s Rhinoceros Studios and recorded the Listen Like Thieves album along with producer Chris Thomas (Sex Pistols, Pink Floyd, The Pretenders, Elton John). As the band was finishing the recording sessions, Thomas stated that the album was not good enough and still had no &quot;killer&quot; track. Andrew produced a demo tape of a funk song he had been working on called &quot;Funk Song No. 13&quot; and evolved it into &quot;What You Need&quot;.

While the band was recording, WEA released &quot;Dekadance&quot;, a limited edition 12&quot; Vinyl and cassette only EP of INXS remixes from their albums &quot;The Swing&quot; and &quot;Shabooh Shoobah&quot;.

On 19 May 1985, INXS won seven awards at the 1984 &quot;Countdown&quot; Music and Video Awards ceremony. They performed &quot;Burn for You&quot;, dressed in Akubras (hats) and Drizabones (outdoor coats/oilskin jackets). The band performed five songs for the July 1985 Oz for Africa concert, in conjunction with the Live Aid benefit. Two INXS songs, &quot;What You Need&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Change&quot;, were also in the BBC broadcast and are contained on Live Aid&#x27;s four DVD boxed set released in 2004.

&quot;Listen Like Thieves&quot; was released in October 1985 to critical approval, reaching No. 3 on the Australian charts and No. 11 on the US charts. With the release of &quot;Listen Like Thieves&quot;, the band developed a rock sound influenced by Led Zeppelin and XTC while remaining true to the band&#x27;s original roots in Aussie pubs. It was also the first album to feature songs written by a combination of band members, with Andrew Farris and Hutchence becoming the primary songwriters in the years to follow. The first U.S. single from the album, &quot;This Time&quot;, stalled at No. 81 in late 1985, but the next single, &quot;What You Need&quot;—released there in early 1986—became a top five &quot;Billboard&quot; hit, bringing INXS its first break-out US success. The single was also a top 20 hit in Canada and reached No. 2 in Australia (September 1985), but only reached No. 51 on the UK charts. The British press dismissed the album, with New Musical Express calling the band &#x27;INX-cusable&#x27; and a reviewer declaring &quot;Listen Like Thieves&quot; to be a &#x27;complete and utter turkey&#x27;. In the United States, however, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote, &quot;INXS rocks with passion and seals the deal with a backbeat that&#x27;ll blackmail your feet.&quot;

In August 1985, INXS toured ahead of the release of &quot;Listen Like Thieves&quot;, touring South America before returning to Melbourne to play for Prince Charles and Princess Diana of Wales at a concert. The concert was filmed and later released on a home video entitled &quot;Living INXS&quot;; an edited version of the concert was played on MTV in the U.S. in 1985 on its Saturday night concert series. INXS toured North America, Europe, and New Zealand from November 1985 to February 1986. Next the band took a two-month break, with Andrew Farriss writing and producing &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Get Hurt&quot; for Jenny Morris (who had previously been a backing vocalist with the band), and Hutchence featuring in Richard Lowenstein&#x27;s second feature film &quot;Dogs in Space&quot;. Lowenstein had previously made the video clip for &quot;Dancing on the Jetty&quot;. While a song from the movie, &quot;Rooms for the Memory&quot;, written by Ollie Olsen, with vocals by Hutchence charted, the movie was received well by critics but was not a commercial success. Beginning in May 1986, the band performed 32 European shows (including support for Queen at their Live at Wembley &#x27;86 concert on 12 July), 42 U.S. shows, and 12 Australian shows. America&#x27;s influential Musician magazine called INXS &quot;the best live band in the world.&quot;

====From &quot;Good Times&quot; to &quot;Kick&quot;====

While on an eight-month break before beginning work on a new album, Murphy, their manager, decided to stage a series of major outdoor concerts across Australia, featuring INXS, Jimmy Barnes, Models, Divinyls, Mental as Anything, The Triffids and I&#x27;m Talking. To promote the tour, INXS recorded two songs with Jimmy Barnes of Cold Chisel: The Easybeats cover &quot;Good Times&quot; and &quot;Laying Down the Law&quot; which Barnes co-wrote with Beers, Andrew Farriss, Jon Farriss, Hutchence and Pengilly. &quot;Good Times&quot; was used as the theme song for the Australian Made series of concerts in the summer of 1986–1987. It peaked at No. 2 on the Australian charts, and months later was featured in the Joel Schumacher film &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; and its soundtrack, allowing it to peak at No. 47 in the US on 1 August 1987.
After the success of &quot;What You Need&quot; and &quot;Listen Like Thieves&quot;, the band knew their new material would have to be even better and wanted every song on the album to be good enough to be a single. They recorded &quot;Kick&quot; in Sydney and Paris, produced by Chris Thomas. According to the 2005 official autobiography, Atlantic Records was not happy with the result; the label offered the band $1 million to go back to Australia and record another album, but the band declined.

Despite Atlantic&#x27;s protests, &quot;Kick&quot; was released in October 1987 and provided the band with worldwide popularity. The album peaked at No. 1 in Australia, No. 3 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, No. 9 in UK, and No. 15 in Austria. It was an upbeat, confident album that yielded four Top 10 US singles: No. 1 single &quot;Need You Tonight&quot;, &quot;Devil Inside&quot;, &quot;New Sensation&quot;, and &quot;Never Tear Us Apart&quot;. &quot;Need You Tonight&quot; peaked No. 2 on the UK charts, No. 3 in Australia, and No. 10 in France. The band toured heavily behind the album throughout 1987 and 1988. The video for the 1987 INXS track &quot;Mediate&quot; (which played after the video for &quot;Need You Tonight&quot;) replicated the format of Bob Dylan&#x27;s video for &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot;, even in its use of apparently deliberate errors. In September 1988, the band swept the MTV Video Music Awards with the video for &quot;Need You Tonight/Mediate&quot; winning in 5 categories. &quot;Kick&quot; was, by far, INXS&#x27;s best-selling album of all time.

During 1989, Hutchence collaborated with Ian &quot;Ollie&quot; Olsen on a side project, Max Q, the two had previously worked together on Lowenstein&#x27;s film &quot;Dogs in Space&quot;. The rest of the band also took a break to work on side projects, but soon returned to the studio to record their follow-up album to &quot;Kick&quot;.

===1990–1997: From &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Elegantly Wasted&quot;===

In October 1990, INXS released &quot;X&quot; which was produced by Chris Thomas. The album peaked at No. 3 in Australia, No. 5 in the US, No. 2 in the UK, No. 5 in Switzerland and No. 10 in Sweden. It followed in the same vein as &quot;Kick&quot;, and added harmonica to some songs. &quot;X&quot; scored hits with &quot;Suicide Blonde&quot; and &quot;Disappear&quot; (both Top 10 in the US). &quot;Suicide Blonde&quot; peaked at No. 2 in Australia, No. 11 in the UK and in Switzerland. Other singles from &quot;X&quot; were &quot;Bitter Tears&quot; and &quot;By My Side&quot;, which had less chart success.

INXS performed at Wembley Stadium on 13 July 1991, during their &quot;Summer XS&quot; tour stop in London to a sold-out audience of 74,000 fans. This performance was recorded and filmed to become &quot;Live Baby Live&quot;, a live album that was released in November 1991 and peaked in the Top 30 in the Australia and UK album charts. The album had less success on The &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. A video version of the album was also released under the same title.
This concert was the band&#x27;s most well-attended show of all time; according to a 2017 article by Paul Donoughue of ABC.net.au, it &quot;solidified [INXS&#x27;s] place in pop history&quot;.

On 28 March 1992, INXS performed at the controversial Concert for Life at Centennial Park in Sydney (a fundraiser for the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Centre), and other performers included Crowded House, Yothu Yindi, Jenny Morris, Diesel, Ratcat, and Def FX. Due to inclement weather, the expected attendance of 100,000 never came through, and the event only raised $500,000.

&quot;Welcome to Wherever You Are&quot;, produced by Mark Opitz and released in August 1992, was an experimental album using sitars and a 60-piece orchestra while adding a more &quot;raw&quot; sound. It received good critical reviews reaching No. 1 in the UK and in Sweden; No. 2 in Australia and Switzerland, and No. 3 in Norway, but had less chart success in the US (peaking at No. 16). Singles from the album included &quot;Taste It&quot; and &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, which were Top 20 successes in UK but had less success in US and Australian markets.

&quot;Full Moon, Dirty Hearts&quot;, produced by Opitz, was released in November 1993 and peaked at No. 3 on the UK charts, No. 4 in Australia, No. 8 in Sweden, No. 9 in Switzerland, No. 14 in Norway; it did not reach the Top 50 in the US. The title track featured The Pretenders&#x27; Chrissie Hynde, and another track--&quot;Please (You Got That)&quot;—featured Ray Charles. The band made a full video album for the record using unknown Australian students to direct with help from Richard Lowenstein. &quot;Full Moon, Dirty Hearts&quot; received mixed reviews, and was the last record under INXS&#x27; contract with Atlantic in the States. The band took time off to rest and be with their families, while Hutchence remained in the public eye through modelling and film acting.

In 1997, the group released a comeback album titled &quot;Elegantly Wasted&quot;, which garnered mixed reviews. It fared respectably in Australia (No. 14), Canada (No. 14), France (No. 30), UK (No. 16) (where INXS had more success in the 1990s than in the 1980s), Belgium (No. 7), Switzerland (No. 13), but only No. 41 in US.

On 22 November 1997, Michael Hutchence was found dead in his Sydney Ritz-Carlton hotel room. On 6 February 1998, New South Wales State Coroner Derrick Hand presented his report, which ruled that Hutchence&#x27;s death was a suicide while depressed and under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Despite the official coroner&#x27;s report, there was continued speculation that Hutchence&#x27;s death was accidental.

===1997–2003: Transitional years===

After Hutchence&#x27;s death, INXS did not perform publicly for almost a year, and then only made a few one-off performances with different guest singers until 2000. On 14 November 1998, they played at the Mushroom 25 Concert with Jimmy Barnes fronting for two songs: &quot;The Loved One&quot; and &quot;Good Times&quot;. On 12 June 1999, they headlined the opening of Stadium Australia in Sydney, with US singer-songwriter Terence Trent D&#x27;Arby and Russell Hitchcock as guest vocalists, they performed &quot;New Sensation&quot;, &quot;Kick&quot;, &quot;Never Tear Us Apart&quot; and &quot;What You Need&quot;.

In December 2000, INXS performed a concert with singers Suze DeMarchi and Jon Stevens sharing the spotlight. DeMarchi was reportedly offered the role of permanent singer in the band. The former lead singer of Australian band Noiseworks, Jon Stevens began singing with INXS on a regular basis. INXS played as one of the headline acts at the Sydney 2000 Olympics and then toured through South America and Europe. Stevens was officially named a member of INXS in 2002, and the band started recording new material in November. He left the band in October 2003 to pursue a solo career, and only recorded a contractual obligation song called &quot;I Get Up&quot;.

===2004–2005: &quot;Rock Star: INXS&quot;===
INXS returned to the news in 2004 when it was announced that a new reality television program titled &quot;Rock Star: INXS&quot; would feature a contest to find a new lead vocalist for the band. The show, which debuted on the CBS network on 11 July 2005, featured 15 contestants vying for the position of lead singer. The show was executive produced by &quot;Survivor&quot;&#x27;s Mark Burnett and hosted by Brooke Burke and Jane&#x27;s Addiction and former Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Dave Navarro.

On 20 September 2005, J.D. Fortune won the eleven-week competition, which culminated in his singing the Rolling Stones&#x27;s &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot; and INXS&#x27; &quot;What You Need&quot; in the finale to become the new lead singer of INXS.

===2005–2011: J.D. Fortune era===

With Fortune as lead singer, INXS released the single &quot;Pretty Vegas&quot; on 4 October 2005. The single reached No. 5 on the iTunes Store ranking of daily most downloaded songs on its first day. It peaked at No. 9 in Australia and No. 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and became a huge radio airplay hit in Fortune&#x27;s native Canada. On 29 November 2005, &quot;Switch&quot;—the band&#x27;s first album with Fortune as lead singer—was released in the United States via Epic Records. The band&#x27;s new line-up started a world tour in support of &quot;Switch&quot; in January 2006. In September 2006, INXS and Epic Records parted ways. The band then performed at the 2006 NRL Grand Final.

INXS toured Australia and New Zealand in March 2007, with Simple Minds and support band Arrested Development. After the cancellation of a 31 August 2007 show in Cleveland, Ohio, INXS placed a statement on their website saying &quot;Due to ongoing medical issues with Garry Beers&#x27; hand, the band&#x27;s doctor has urged the band to not play more than three shows in a row or risk permanent damage to Garry&#x27;s hand.&quot;

The band signed with Petrol Electric Records in December 2008, reuniting them with former manager Chris Murphy. On 16 February 2009, J.D. Fortune told Entertainment Tonight Canada that INXS had let him go from the band with a shake of the hand at an airport in Hong Kong. On 23 February 2009, Chris Murphy, INXS creative director and global business strategist and former manager, in an interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, said J.D. was not sacked and, in fact, &quot;the band made it known to him that they had not ruled out seeing a return by Fortune.&quot; He also stated J.D. was next on his list to call regarding a major recording contract he was negotiating for the band. 
In an interview with &quot;Sun Media&quot; published on 6 March 2009, J.D. Fortune clarified his claim that he had been fired at an airport. After returning to Canada from Hong Kong, Fortune believed there were still two more legs of the INXS 2007 tour to complete. When the rest of the tour was cancelled and the band did not return his calls for 10 months, he believed he was out of the band.

On 30 November 2009, Andrew Farriss, Jon Farriss, and Kirk Pengilly performed an acoustic version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Change&quot; with the Qantas Choir at the Pride of Australia Awards. On 8 December 2009, INXS announced they would be embarking on a world tour commencing with a performance in Vancouver for the 2010 Olympic Winter Games. The band announced on 11 February 2010 that J.D. Fortune would be vocalist for the performance at the 2010 Winter Olympics, but that it would be a one-off performance; they added that a vocalist for the upcoming world tour had yet to be announced. The band performed at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics on 24 February 2010 with guest singers J.D. Fortune and Argentine singer Deborah de Corral. 

On 22 April 2010, INXS announced that Fortune would again front the band for a performance on 10 July 2010 at Townsville, Queensland and also on 16 July 2010 in Broome, Western Australia. During a radio interview with Kirk Pengilly and J.D. Fortune in July 2010 just before the Broome concert, Pengilly confirmed that Fortune had returned as the band&#x27;s permanent singer. In August 2010, Petrol Records issued Australian radio stations with a one-track promo &quot;Never Tear Us Apart&quot; featuring Ben Harper on vocals, a preview from the upcoming INXS Michael Hutchence tribute album &quot;Original Sin&quot;. On 25 September 2010, the band performed before the 2010 AFL Grand Final. On 19 October 2010, it was announced in the Courier Mail that INXS, fronted by J.D. Fortune, would tour as part of the A Day on the Green winery concerts in February.&quot;

The band recorded an album in memory of Michael Hutchence titled &quot;Original Sin&quot;. Released in November 2010, the album featured well-known singers from Australia and around the world, including Ben Harper, Patrick Monahan, and Rob Thomas.

In March 2011, INXS confirmed they would return to the UK and headlining with support from New Zealand band Shihad for an outdoor event called Southern Sounds on Clapham Common, London on Saturday 11 June. The event was an all-Australian, New Zealand and South African celebration lineup, with INXS fronted by J.D. Fortune. INXS toured extensively throughout 2011 with singer J.D. Fortune to support the album &quot;Original Sin&quot;.

===2011–2019: Later activities===

The band released a demo of a song, called &quot;Tiny Summer&quot; in streaming format on their official website in September 2011; they also announced that J.D. Fortune had again left the band and Northern Irish singer-songwriter Ciaran Gribbin was the band&#x27;s frontman for their forthcoming tour of Australia, South America, and Europe in November and December 2011. On 6 October 2012, INXS were the headline act at the annual charity ball organised by the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondent&#x27;s Club.

During a concert on 11 November 2012 at the newly opened Perth Arena, while supporting Matchbox Twenty, INXS announced that they would no longer be touring. Kirk Pengilly stated that it was appropriate to finish where they had started 35 years earlier. Jon Farriss admitted that he was &quot;getting teary&quot; before the band performed their biggest hit, &quot;Need You Tonight&quot;. In 2014, INXS released a tell-all history of the band on an Australian television interview special, &quot;The Story Behind INXS&quot;. During the interview, Jon Farriss made the statement, &quot;Never say never&quot; regarding the possibility that the band could record and perform more music in the future.

In 2013, Australian TV network Seven Network announced that it would produce a miniseries focusing on the band&#x27;s behind-the-scenes stories called &quot;&quot;. Band member Tim Farriss was a pre-production consultant on the show. The miniseries commenced production at the end of June 2013 and premiered on 9 February 2014; the finale aired the following Sunday night (16 February 2014). The miniseries rated very highly for both nights and created a renewed interest in the band, which translated to a resurgence in sales of their music that brought them once again to the number one position on the Australian popular music charts. Luke Arnold was cast as Michael Hutchence, Alex Williams as Kirk Pengilly, Nicholas Masters as Tim Farriss, Hugh Sheridan as bass guitarist Gary Beers, Ido Drent as Jon Farriss and Andy Ryan as Andrew Farriss. In addition, Damon Herriman played band manager CM Murphy and Samantha Jade played Kylie Minogue. Given the popularity of this TV miniseries, there was talk of a Broadway musical and a feature film about INXS in the future.

In 2019, a documentary film was released about Michael Hutchence titled &quot;Mystify&quot;. A was also released featuring INXS tracks.

<text>Dredg (stylized as dredg) is an American rock band formed in 1993 in Los Gatos, California. The band&#x27;s lineup consists of vocalist Gavin Hayes, guitarist Mark Engles, bassist Drew Roulette and drummer and pianist Dino Campanella.

Originally starting out as an alternative metal outfit, Dredg established themselves in the indie scene with their debut album &quot;Leitmotif&quot; (1999), which showed the band stylistically moving into progressive rock and art rock; the album&#x27;s local success landed them a deal with Interscope Records in 2001, who re-released the album later in the year. Dredg&#x27;s major label debut, &quot;El Cielo&quot; (2002), was lauded by critics and helped establish a wider cult following for the band. The band experienced mainstream success with &quot;Catch Without Arms&quot; (2005), which became the band&#x27;s first album to chart in the United States, and the band received exposure on MTV with the single &quot;Bug Eyes&quot;. Following their departure from Interscope in 2009, Dredg independently released &quot;The Pariah, the Parrot, the Delusion&quot;, which saw the band reach their highest charting positions yet. The band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Chuckles and Mr. Squeezy&quot; (2011), was a stylistic departure for the band and received a negative response from the band&#x27;s fanbase. Following the conclusion of the album&#x27;s promotional tour in May 2014, the band went on an &quot;extended hiatus&quot;. 

In January 2018, the band announced that they had reunited and have since been writing material for their sixth studio album; they are planning to record the album in the winter of 2022. 

==History==

===Early years (1993–1998)===
While attending middle school in Los Gatos, Engles and Campanella started playing together. After they graduated to Los Gatos High School, older friends Hayes and Roulette joined the group.

In a 2005 interview, when asked about the origin of the band&#x27;s name, Campanella said, &quot;It was so long ago that we named it I can&#x27;t even remember. Honestly, we don&#x27;t even like the name anymore. We mostly don&#x27;t like the way it sounds. It doesn&#x27;t roll off the tongue well.&quot;

In 1996, Dredg recorded and released their first demos of original material, the Conscious EP, garnering them exposure as far away as Boston. Currently, very little information has ever been released about these demos. In 1997, they released what would become the early stages of their musical transition, the &quot;Orph EP&quot;. It includes the group&#x27;s first instrumental track, &quot;Orph&quot;. Additionally, the track &quot;Kayasuma&quot; shares its title with the name of the shaman in &quot;Leitmotif&quot;&#x27;s liner notes for &quot;Lechium&quot;. With the release, Dredg slowly built a name for themselves in the Bay Area, as well as on the East Coast, such as in Boston and New York.

===&quot;Leitmotif&quot; (1999–2001)===
In May 1999, Dredg independently released their first full-length, &quot;Leitmotif&quot;, a concept album about a man traveling the world to cure his moral disease. The story was included in the liner notes, in lieu of the actual lyrics. Written by Roulette, the band had planned to release a movie of the story; however, upon the death of the lead actor, the project was scrapped.

Over the next two years, Dredg toured mostly within California, slowly expanding their fan base. The band began sending out a demo tape to several labels with four new songs intended for their next album, &quot;Of the Room&quot;, &quot;Redrawing the Island Map&quot;, &quot;Running Through Propellers&quot; and &quot;The Papal Insignia&quot;. In January 2001, Dredg was offered a deal by Interscope Records, and the band signed to the label in February 2001. As part of the deal, &quot;Leitmotif&quot; was re-released by Interscope on September 11, 2001.

With the re-release of &quot;Leitmotif&quot;, Dredg toured nationally and internationally in support of the record with bands such as Alien Ant Farm, Pressure 4-5, the Apex Theory, Taproot, Deadsy and Onesidezero.

===&quot;El Cielo&quot; (2002–2004)===
After signing to Interscope Records, the band began work on their major label debut, &quot;El Cielo&quot;. Like its predecessor, &quot;El Cielo&quot; was a concept album. Initially intended to revolve around Salvador Dalí&#x27;s &quot;Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bumblebee around a Pomegranate One Second Before Awakening&quot;, the band expanded the focus to include sleep paralysis after learning of Dalí&#x27;s own influences. As they had done with the liner notes of &quot;Leitmotif&quot;, Dredg chose not to include the lyrics; instead, they printed letters sent to them by people suffering from sleep paralysis. Several songs on the album even included lyrics taken directly from the letters.

When the band began writing material for the new album, they secluded themselves in the deserts around Palm Desert. The majority of the album was recorded at Skywalker Ranch. The band used three producers, Ron Saint Germain, Tim Palmer and Jim Scott, on the record, adding another layer of diversity to the album. Completed in May 2002, the album was widely available on the internet before being released on October 8, 2002. Dredg made music videos for two of the album&#x27;s tracks, &quot;Same Ol&#x27; Road&quot; and &quot;Of The Room&quot;.

Upon releasing the album, the band once again returned to their hectic touring schedule, including their first national headline tour with Codeseven, a then-unsigned Strata and either STUN or Woven supporting. They also toured with acts such as Ozomatli, Deftones, Chevelle, Hoobastank and Phantom Planet, as well as earning a spot on the Sno-Core Tour with Sparta, Glassjaw and Hot Water Music.

===&quot;Catch Without Arms&quot; (2005–2006)===

While touring in support of &quot;El Cielo&quot;, Dredg began work on their third album, &quot;Catch Without Arms&quot;, spending 8 months writing material before taking another 10 months to record and mix the album. Like their previous albums, &quot;Catch Without Arms&quot; was a concept album; however, differing from the concrete stories and events surrounding their earlier releases, &quot;Catch Without Arms&quot; was about opposites, mainly focused on positives and negatives. Produced by Terry Date, &quot;Catch Without Arms&quot; was Dredg&#x27;s most successful album, debuting at 123 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts, selling over 9,000 copies, and eventually reaching the top of the Heatseekers chart. The only single on the album, &quot;Bug Eyes&quot;, was made into a music video directed by Philip Andelman.

With the release of &quot;Catch Without Arms&quot;, Dredg began a treasure hunt based around the Bay Area. The three winners each received a painting from &quot;Catch Without Arms&quot;, as well as the opportunity to name a song for the next album, &quot;Vague Clues and Long Days&quot;.

Dredg headlined several tours in support of &quot;Catch Without Arms&quot;, playing with bands such as Circa Survive, Day One Symphony, Delta Activity, Vedera, Ours and Ambulette. They played the Taste of Chaos tour in 2006 with Deftones, Atreyu, Thrice and Story of the Year, as well as shows with Coheed and Cambria, the Blood Brothers and MewithoutYou. Engles and Campanella also took some time to record the soundtrack for the 2005 independent film, &quot;Waterborne&quot;.

On May 11, 2006, Dredg recorded their concert in San Francisco for a live CD entitled &quot;Live at the Fillmore&quot;. Released on November 7, 2006, &quot;Live at the Fillmore&quot; contained songs from all three studio albums, as well as a new song titled &quot;The Warbler&quot;. A remix of &quot;Sang Real&quot; by Dan the Automator was released with purchase of the album on iTunes.

On September 14 and 15, 2006, Dredg played two special shows at the Catalyst in Santa Cruz, California, playing &quot;Leitmotif&quot; and &quot;El Cielo&quot; in their entirety on separate nights. During these shows the band played songs from &quot;Catch Without Arms&quot; before diving into the full album of the night. Of note, each night they played a very early version of &quot;It&#x27;s Not Worth It&quot; (a song that did not make it into the final album) at about the midpoint of each album. On the second night, as a segue into &quot;El Cielo&quot;, they performed an early instrumental version of &quot;Wonderous Miracle&quot; (another song that did not make it into the final album).

===Exit from Interscope and &quot;The Pariah, the Parrot, the Delusion&quot; (2007–2009)===

On February 14, 2007, Dredg issued an update indicating production had begun on their next album and released several new song titles as part of the update. Gavin Hayes posted a Myspace blog on July 8, 2007, with new information that the band had 12-15 songs that might or might not make the final cut. Of the songs previously written, only a few were being worked on from prior updates. Hayes stated that on December 21, 2007, the writing process for their new album was almost done, and they planned to enter the studio in early 2008 to start recording. This would be followed by extensive touring in the spring. The songs that were played at live shows during the writing process but were not released on the album include: &quot;Wondrous Miracle&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Not Worth It&quot;, &quot;Push Away&quot;, &quot;Holding a Remedy Potion&quot;, &quot;Hurricane Felix&quot;, &quot;Pieces of Gold&quot;, &quot;Fleeing to Mexico&quot;, &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;MacGuffin&quot; and &quot;Fucking Smile Pt. 2&quot;.

The band played at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in California on April 26, 2008, during their tour to introduce the new tracks to their fans, with the exception of a few past hits and some tracks already performed such as &quot;Long Days and Vague Clues&quot;. After Coachella, Dredg released demos for songs rumored to be on their upcoming album up to February 2009. They also added a song entitled &quot;entire new album&quot;, which was a track consisting of every song played simultaneously. Also on February 23, 2009, Dredg announced their exit from Interscope Records as well their new record&#x27;s title, &quot;The Pariah, the Parrot, the Delusion&quot;. They confirmed joining with Independent Label Group (ILG, which is a part of Warner Music Group), and Ohlone Recordings. The album was released on June 9, 2009, with a Limited Edition release with alternate artwork (as well as a Vinyl recording) made available to the public. Music videos have been made for &quot;Information&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know&quot;. The album reached number 71 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 7,492 copies in its first week.

The album was inspired by the essay &quot;Imagine There Is No Heaven: A Letter to the Six Billionth Citizen&quot;. The essay was written by British-Indian novelist Salman Rushdie, who found controversy in 1988 over one of his books gaining him a religious fatwa for Rushdie&#x27;s death from Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini which ultimately resulted in United Kingdom and Iran breaking diplomatic ties to each other a year later. In consideration of the essay, the album has common themes in agnosticism and the questioning of beliefs and society. Album and liner notes artwork resembled an Air Mail letter (addressed to &quot;SEVEN BILLIONTH&quot;) and was done by Rohner Segnitz of the band Division Day. Segue tracks on the album are called &quot;Stamps of Origin&quot;, and unlike prior albums a few of these segue tracks contain lyrics.

===&quot;Chuckles and Mr. Squeezy&quot; (2010–2014)===
Dredg suggested on their Twitter account that they began recording their fifth album on June 23, 2010.

On August 17, 2010, Dredg announced via their official website that they had begun the process of recording a new album. Unlike the long gaps between their last two efforts, the band expected an early 2011 release. The announcement was posted in the news section and reads as follows: &quot;Yesterday, we began working on our fifth record with musician/producer Dan the Automator. We will be writing and recording it in San Francisco for the next month and a half and are hoping for an early 2011 release. Stay tuned as there will be more updates and studio footage in the coming months.&quot;

On February 18, 2011, Dredg announced via Twitter that their fifth studio album, &quot;Chuckles and Mr. Squeezy&quot;, was to be released on May 3, 2011, in the United States and April 29 everywhere else. The album received a negative response from the band&#x27;s fans, many who derided the album&#x27;s production and sound.

In February 2014, Dredg released a non-album track, &quot;I Left My Heart In San Francisco&quot;, in conjunction with a stop-motion music video touring the city. Touring in support of the album took place from 2011, until May 2014.

===Hiatus and side projects (2014–2017)===
After the release of &quot;Chuckles and Mr. Squeezy&quot;, Dino Campanella stated in an interview in 2014 that Dredg was taking an indefinite hiatus: 
Mark Engles joined the band Black Map during the hiatus.

=== Return (2018–present) ===
On January 27, 2018, it was announced that the band was working on their first release since &quot;Chuckles And Mr. Squeezy&quot;. In March 2019, vocalist-guitarist Gavin Hayes confirmed in an interview they were working on a new album originally planned to be released in 2019. In a late 2021 interview, Hayes said that work on new material had been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. He went on to note that they had &quot;probably two albums worth&quot; of new material to work through, and that their goal was to release an album in 2022. In June 2022, the band stated that they were now aiming to start recording the album in the winter of 2022.

==Musical style==
Dredg&#x27;s early music in 1990s is rooted in alternative metal styles. Nevertheless, the band eschewed the nu metal style of the early EPs in favor of a progressive rock and art rock sound. The band was also labeled as alternative rock and experimental rock.

<doc id="172817" wikidata="Q1455662" url="?curid=172817" title="Local anesthesia">
<text>Local anesthesia is any technique to induce the absence of sensation in a specific part of the body, generally for the aim of inducing local analgesia, i.e. local insensitivity to pain, although other local senses may be affected as well. It allows patients to undergo surgical and dental procedures with reduced pain and distress. In many situations, such as cesarean section, it is safer and therefore superior to general anesthesia.

The following terms are often used interchangeably:
* &quot;Local anesthesia&quot;, in a strict sense, is anesthesia of a small part of the body such as a tooth or an area of skin.
* &quot;Regional anesthesia&quot; is aimed at anesthetizing a larger part of the body such as a leg or arm.
* &quot;Conduction anesthesia&quot; encompasses a great variety of local and regional anesthetic techniques.

==Medical==

A local anesthetic is a drug that causes reversible local anesthesia and a loss of nociception. When it is used on specific nerve pathways (nerve block), effects such as analgesia (loss of pain sensation) and paralysis (loss of muscle power) can be achieved. Clinical local anesthetics belong to one of two classes: aminoamide and aminoester local anesthetics. Synthetic local anesthetics are structurally related to cocaine. They differ from cocaine mainly in that they have no abuse potential and do not act on the sympathoadrenergic system, i.e. they do not produce hypertension or local vasoconstriction, with the exception of Ropivacaine and Mepivacaine that do produce weak vasoconstriction. Unlike other forms of anesthesia, a local can be used for a minor procedure in a surgeon&#x27;s office as it does not put one into a state of unconsciousness. However, the physician should have a sterile environment available before doing a procedure in their office.

Local anesthetics vary in their pharmacological properties and they are used in various techniques of local anesthesia such as:
* Topical anesthesia (surface) - Similar to topical gel numbing before getting injected with Lidocaine.
* Infiltration
* Plexus block

Adverse effects depend on the local anesthetic method and site of administration discussed in depth in the local anesthetic sub-article, but overall, adverse effects can be:
# localized prolonged anesthesia or paresthesia due to infection, hematoma, excessive fluid pressure in a confined cavity, and severing of nerves &amp; support tissue during injection.
# systemic reactions such as depressed CNS syndrome, allergic reaction, vasovagal episode, and cyanosis due to local anesthetic toxicity.
# lack of anesthetic effect due to infectious pus such as an abscess.

==Non-medical local anesthetic techniques==
Local pain management that uses other techniques than analgesic medication include:
* Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, which has been found to be ineffective for lower back pain, however, it might help with diabetic neuropathy.
* Pulsed radiofrequency, neuromodulation, direct introduction of medication and nerve ablation may be used to target either the tissue structures and organ/systems responsible for persistent nociception or the nociceptors from the structures implicated as the source of chronic pain.

<text>InterNetNews (INN) is a Usenet news server package, originally released by Rich Salz in 1991, and presented at the Summer 1992 USENIX conference in San Antonio, Texas. It was the first news server with integrated NNTP functionality.

While previous servers processed articles individually or in batches, &quot;innd&quot; is a single continuously running process that receives articles from the network, files them, and records what remote hosts should receive them. Readers can access articles directly from the disk in the same manner as B News and C News, but an included program, called &quot;nnrpd&quot;, also serves newsreaders that employ NNTP.

A later improvement was the Cyclical News Filesystem (CNFS), which sequentially stores articles in large on-disk buffers. This method, implemented by Scott Fritchie, greatly increased performance by eliminating the operating system overhead needed to deal with thousands of individual article files.

James Brister&#x27;s &quot;innfeed&quot; program was also added to the package. Like &quot;innd&quot;, &quot;innfeed&quot; operates continuously to feed articles out to other servers, while the earlier &quot;innxmit&quot; processed them in batches. This combination allows articles to be received and redistributed with virtually no latency, and has substantially changed the nature of Usenet interaction by reducing the time for messages to be posted, read across the network and answered, from hours or days, to seconds or minutes. A similar earlier program, called &quot;nntplink,&quot; provided a comparable function, but it was produced independently.

INN is under active development . The package is maintained by volunteers, and development is hosted by the Internet Systems Consortium. The current maintainer of INN is Russ Allbery, Julian Elie, and the ISC.

<text>Juan Leovigildo Brouwer Mezquida (born March 1, 1939) is a Cuban composer, conductor, and classical guitarist. He is a Member of Honour of the International Music Council.

==Early years==
Brouwer was born in Havana. When he was 13, he began classical guitar with the encouragement of his father, who was an amateur guitarist. His teacher was Isaac Nicola, who was a student of Emilio Pujol, who was himself a student of Francisco Tárrega. At age 17 he performed publicly for the first time and began composing.

Brouwer went to the United States to study music at the Hartt College of Music of the University of Hartford, and later at the Juilliard School, where he studied under Vincent Persichetti and took composition classes with Stefan Wolpe.

In 1970 Brouwer played in the premiere of &quot;El Cimarrón&quot; by Hans Werner Henze in Berlin. Together with Morton Feldman, he was awarded a 1972 scholarship by the DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) and to work as a guest composer and lecturer at the Academy of Science and Arts of Berlin. In Germany Brouwer also recorded a number of LPs for Deutsche Grammophon.

==Composing and performing==
In his early compositions, Brouwer remained close to the rhythms of Cuban music, while later he was drawn to aleatoric music. During the 1960s and 70s, he became interested in the music of modernist composers such as Luigi Nono and Iannis Xenakis, using indeterminacy in works such as &quot;Sonograma I&quot;. Other works from this period include the guitar pieces &quot;Canticum&quot; (1968), &quot;La espiral eterna&quot; (1971), &quot;Parábola&quot; (1973) and &quot;Tarantos&quot; (1974). More recently, Brouwer&#x27;s works have leaned towards tonality and modality. The solo guitar works &quot;El Decamerón Negro&quot; (1981), &quot;Paisaje cubano con campanas&quot; (1986), and the &quot;Sonata&quot; (1990; for Julian Bream) exemplify this tendency. His playing career ended in the early 1980s due to an injury to a tendon in his right hand middle finger.

Brouwer has written for guitar, piano, and percussion, and has composed orchestral works, ballet, and music for over one hundred movies, including the film &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot;. For a guitar competition in Hungary in 1979, he wrote a composition that employed 200 guitarists. He is known for a series of studies called the Etudes Simples. Brouwer has also transcribed Beatles songs for classical guitar.

He has performed and recorded works by Sylvano Bussotti, Hans Werner Henze, Maurice Ohana, Cristóbal Halffter, Leni Alexander, Cornelius Cardew, and Heitor Villa-Lobos.

==Other activities==

<text>Klezmer ( or ) is an instrumental musical tradition of the Ashkenazi Jews of Central and Eastern Europe. The essential elements of the tradition include dance tunes, ritual melodies, and virtuosic improvisations played for listening; these would have been played at weddings and other social functions. The musical genre incorporated elements of many other musical genres including Ottoman (especially Greek and Romanian) music, Baroque music, German and Slavic folk dances, and religious Jewish music. As the music arrived in the United States, it lost some of its traditional ritual elements and adopted elements of American big band and popular music. Among the European-born klezmers who popularized the genre in the United States in the 1910s and 1920s were Dave Tarras and Naftule Brandwein; they were followed by American-born musicians such as Max Epstein, Sid Beckerman and Ray Musiker.

After the destruction of Jewish life in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust, and a general fall in the popularity of klezmer music in the United States, the music began to be popularized again in the late 1970s in the so-called Klezmer Revival. During the 1980s and onwards, musicians experimented with traditional and experimental forms of the genre, releasing fusion albums combining the genre with jazz, punk, and other styles.

==Etymology==
The term , as used in the Yiddish language, has a Hebrew etymology: &quot;klei&quot;, meaning &quot;tools, utensils or instruments of&quot; and &quot;zemer&quot;, &quot;melody&quot;; leading to &quot;k&#x27;lei zemer&quot; , meaning &quot;musical instruments&quot;. This expression would have been familiar to literate Jews across the diaspora, not only Ashkenazi Jews in Eastern Europe. Over time the usage of &quot;&quot; in a Yiddish context evolved to describe musicians instead of their instruments, first in Bohemia in the second half of the sixteenth century and then in Poland, possibly as a response to the new status of the musicians who were at that time forming professional guilds. Previously the musician may have been referred to as a () or other terms. After the term became the preferred term for these professional musicians in Yiddish-speaking Eastern Europe, other types of musicians were more commonly known as or .

It was not until the late 20th century that the word &quot;klezmer&quot; became a commonly known English-language term. During that time, through metonymy it came to refer not only to the musician but to the musical genre they played, a meaning which it had not had in Yiddish. Early 20th century recording industry materials and other writings had referred to it as Hebrew, Jewish, or Yiddish dance music, or sometimes using the Yiddish term &quot;Freilech music&quot; (&quot;Cheerful music&quot;).

Twentieth century Russian scholars sometimes used the term klezmer; Ivan Lipaev did not use it, but Moisei Beregovsky did when publishing in Yiddish or Ukrainian.

The first postwar recordings to use the term &quot;klezmer&quot; to refer to the music were The Klezmorim&#x27;s &quot;East Side Wedding&quot; and &quot;Streets of Gold&quot; in 1977/78, followed by Andy Statman and Zev Feldman&#x27;s &quot;Jewish Klezmer Music&quot; in 1979.

==Musical elements==
===Style===
The traditional style of playing klezmer music, including tone, typical cadences, and ornamentation, sets it apart from other genres. Although klezmer music emerged from a larger Eastern European Jewish musical culture that included Jewish cantorial music, Hasidic Niguns, and later Yiddish theatre music, it also borrowed from the surrounding folk musics of Central and Eastern Europe and from cosmopolitan European musical forms. Therefore it evolved into an overall style which has recognizable elements from all of those other genres.

Few klezmer musicians before the late nineteenth century had formal musical training, but they inherited a rich tradition with its own advanced musical techniques. Each musician had their understanding of how the style should be &quot;correctly&quot; performed. The usage of these ornaments was not random; the matters of &quot;taste&quot;, self-expression, variation and restraint were and remain important elements of how to interpret the music.

Klezmer musicians apply the overall style to available specific techniques on each melodic instrument. They incorporate and elaborate the vocal melodies of Jewish religious practice, including &quot;khazones&quot;, &quot;davenen&quot;, and paraliturgical song, extending the range of human voice into the musical expression possible on instruments. Among those stylistic elements that are considered typically &quot;Jewish&quot; in klezmer music are those which are shared with cantorial or Hasidic vocal ornaments, including imitations of sighing or laughing. Various Yiddish terms were used for these vocal-like ornaments such as (&quot;Krekhts&quot;, &quot;groan&quot; or &quot;moan&quot;), (, &quot;wrinkle&quot; or &quot;fold&quot;), and (, &quot;pressure&quot; or &quot;stress&quot;). Other ornaments such as trills, grace notes, appoggiaturas, &quot;glitshn&quot; (glissandos), &quot;tshoks&quot; (a kind of bent notes of cackle-like sound), flageolets (string harmonics), pedal notes, mordents, slides and typical klezmer cadences are also important to the style. In particular, the cadences which draw on religious Jewish music identify a piece more strongly as a klezmer tune, even if its broader structure was borrowed from a non-Jewish source. Sometimes the term &quot;dreydlekh&quot; is used only for trills, while other use it for all klezmer ornaments. Unlike in Classical music, vibrato is used sparingly, and is treated as another type of ornament.

In an article about Jewish music in Romania, Bob Cohen of Di Naye Kapelye describes krekhts as &quot;a sort of weeping or hiccoughing combination of backwards slide and flick of the little finger high above the base note, while the bow does, well, something – which aptly imitates Jewish liturgical singing style.&quot; He also noted that the only other place he has heard this particular ornamentation is in Turkish music on the violin. Yale Strom wrote that the use of &quot;dreydlekh&quot; by American violinists gradually diminished since the 1940s, but with the klezmer revival in 1970, dreydlekh had become prominent again.

The accompaniment style of the accompanist or orchestra could be fairly impromptu, called (, holding onto).

===Historical repertoire===
The repertoire of klezmer musicians was very diverse and tied to specific social functions and dances, especially of the traditional wedding. These melodies might have a non-Jewish origin, or have been composed by a klezmer, but only rarely are they attributed to a specific composer. Generally klezmer music can be divided into two broad categories: music for specific dances, and music for listening (at the table, in processions, ceremonial, etc.).

====Dances====
* Freylekhs. The simplest and most widespread type of klezmer dance tunes are those played in and intended for group circle dances. Depending on the location this basic dance may also have been called a (circle), , (round dance, literally the Belarusian translation of the Russian &quot;khorovod&quot;), , , etc.
* Bulgar, or , became the most popular klezmer dance form in the United States. Its origin is thought to be in Moldavia and with a deep connection to the Sârbă genre there.
* Sher is a contra dance in . Beregovsky, writing in the 1930s, noted that despite the dance being very commonly played across a wide area, he suspected that it had its roots in an older German dance. This dance continued to be known in the United States even after other complex European klezmer dances had been forgotten. In some regions the music of a Sher could be interchangeable with a Freylekhs.
* , or , named after Hasidic Jews, is a more dignified embellished dance in or . The dance steps can be performed in a circle or in a line.
* Hora or (from the Romanian ) is a circle dance in . In the United States, it came to be one of the main dance types after the Bulgar.
* Kolomeike is a fast and catchy dance in time, which originated in Ukraine, and is prominent in the folk music of that country.
* &quot;Skotshne&quot; is generally thought to be a more elaborate which could be played either for dancing or listening.
* &quot;Nigun&quot;, a very broad term which can refer to melodies for listening, singing or dancing. Usually a mid-paced song in .
* Waltzes were very popular, whether classical, Russian, or Polish. A &quot;padespan&quot; was a sort of Russian/Spanish waltz known to klezmers.
* Mazurka and polka, Polish and Czech dances, respectively, were often played for both Jews and Gentiles.
* Sirba – a Romanian dance in or (Romanian &quot;sârbă&quot;). It features hopping steps and short bursts of running, accompanied by triplets in the melody.

====Non-dance repertoire====
* The is a freeform instrumental form borrowed from the Romanian shepherd&#x27;s doina. Although there are many regional types of doina in Romania and Moldova, the Jewish form is typically simpler, with a minor key theme which is then repeated in a major key, followed by a . A is a related genre.
* (table tune)
* , a type of Nigun, called Devekut in Hebrew, which inspires spiritual arousal or a pious mood.
* A (Waltz), pieces in especially in the Hasidic context, may be slower than non-Jewish waltzes and intended for listening while the wedding parties are seated at their tables.
* Forms centering on bridal rituals, including (seating of the bride)
* A (March) can be non-Jewish march melodies adapted into joyful singing or playing contexts.
* Processional melodies, including (street tunes), (to the table). According to Beregovski the was always in time.
* The , whose name is borrowed from the Ottoman/Arab Taqsim is a freeform fantasy on a particular motif, ornamented with trills, roulades and so on; it usually ends with a . By the twentieth century it had mostly become obsolete and was replaced by the doina.
* Fantazi or fantasy is a freeform song, traditionally played at Jewish weddings to the guests as they dined. It resembles the fantasia of &quot;light&quot; classical music.
* A is a type of virtuosic solo piece in performed by leading klezmorim such as Dave Tarras and Naftule Brandwein. There is no dance for this type of melody, rather it references an Ottoman or &quot;oriental&quot; style, and melodies may incorporate references to Greek Hasapiko into an Ashkenazic musical aesthetic.
* Parting melodies played at the beginning or end of a wedding day, such as the (be healthy), , (good day), or (good night) etc. These types of pieces were sometimes in which may have given an air of dignity and seriousness.

===Orchestration===
Klezmer music is an instrumental tradition, without much of a history of songs or singing. In Eastern Europe, Klezmers did traditionally accompany the vocal stylings of the Badchen (wedding entertainer), although their performances were typically improvised couplets and the calling of ceremonies rather than songs. (The importance of the Badchen gradually decreased by the twentieth century, although they still continued in some traditions.)

As for the klezmer orchestra, its size and composition varied by time and place. The klezmer bands of the eighteenth and early nineteenth century were small, with roughly three to five musicians playing woodwind or string instruments. Another common configuration in that era was similar to Hungarian bands today, typically a lead violinist, second violin, cello, and cimbalom. In the mid-nineteenth century, the Clarinet started to appear in those small Klezmer ensembles as well. By the last decades of the century, in Ukraine, the orchestras had grown larger, averaging seven to twelve members, and incorporating brass instruments and up to twenty for a prestigious occasion. (However, for poor weddings a large klezmer ensemble might only send three or four of its junior members.) In these larger orchestras, on top of the core instrumentation of strings and woodwinds, cornets, C clarinets, trombones, a contrabass, a large Turkish drum, and several extra violins. The inclusion of Jews in tsarist army bands during the 19th century may also have led to the introduction of typical military band instruments into klezmer. With such large orchestras, the music was arranged so that the bandleader soloist could still be heard at key moments. In Galicia, and Belarus, the smaller string ensemble with cimbalom remained the norm into the twentieth century. American klezmer as it developed in dancehalls and wedding banquets of the early twentieth century had a more complete orchestration not unlike those used in popular orchestras of the time. They use a clarinet, saxophone, or trumpet for the melody, and make great use of the trombone for slides and other flourishes.
The melody in klezmer music is generally assigned to the lead violin, although occasionally the flute and eventually clarinet. The other instrumentalists provide harmony, rhythm, and some counterpoint (the latter usually coming from the second violin or viola). The clarinet now often plays the melody. Brass instruments—such as the French valved cornet and keyed German trumpet—eventually inherited a counter-voice role. Modern klezmer instrumentation is more commonly influenced by the instruments of the 19th-century military bands than the earlier orchestras.

Percussion in early 20th-century klezmer recordings was generally minimal—no more than a wood block or snare drum. In Eastern Europe, percussion was often provided by a drummer who played a frame drum, or &quot;poyk&quot;, sometimes called baraban. A poyk is similar to a bass drum and often has a cymbal or piece of metal mounted on top, which is struck by a beater or a small cymbal strapped to the hand.

===Melodic modes===
====Western, Cantorial, and Ottoman music terminology====
Klezmer music is a genre that developed partly in the Western musical tradition but also in the Ottoman Empire, and is primarily an oral tradition which does not have a well-established literature to explain its modes and modal progression. But, as with other types of Ashkenazic Jewish music, it has a complex system of modes which were used in its compositions. Many of its melodies do not fit well in the major and minor terminology used in Western music, nor is the music systematically microtonal in the way that Middle Eastern music is. Nusach terminology, as developed for Cantorial music in the nineteenth century, is often used instead, and indeed many klezmer compositions draw heavily on religious music. But it also incorporates elements of Baroque and Eastern European folk musics, making description based only on religious terminology incomplete. Still, since the Klezmer revival of the 1970s, the terms for Jewish prayer modes are the most common to describe those used in klezmer. The terms used in Yiddish for these modes include &quot;nusach&quot; (); (), &quot;manner, mode of life&quot;, which describes the typical melodic character, important notes and scale; and (), a word meaning &quot;taste&quot; which was commonly used by Moisei Beregovsky.

Beregovsky, who was writing in the Stalinist era and was constrained by having to downplay klezmer&#x27;s religious aspects, did not use the terminology of synagogue modes, except in some early work in 1929. Instead, he relied on German-inspired musical terminology of major, minor, and &quot;other&quot; modes, which he described in technical terms. In his 1940s works he noted that the majority of the klezmer repertoire seemed to be in a minor key, whether natural minor or others, that around a quarter of the material was in Freygish, and that around a fifth of the repertoire was in a major key.

Another set of terminology sometimes used to describe klezmer music is that of the Makams used in Ottoman and other Middle Eastern music. This approach dates back to Idelsohn in the early twentieth century, who was very familiar with Middle Eastern music, and has been developed in the past decade by Joshua Horowitz.

Finally, some Klezmer music, and especially that composed in the United States from the mid-twentieth century onwards, may not be composed with these traditional modes, but rather built around chords.

====Description====
Because there is no agreed-upon, complete system for describing modes in Klezmer music, this list is imperfect and may conflate concepts which some scholars view as separate. Another problem in listing these terms as simple eight-note (octatonic) scales is that it makes it harder to see how Klezmer melodic structures can work as five-note pentachords, how parts of different modes typically interact, and what the cultural significance of a given mode might be in a traditional Klezmer context.
* , , or Phrygian dominant scale resembles the Phrygian mode, having a flat second but also a permanent raised third. It is among the most common modes in Klezmer and is closely identified with Jewish identity; Beregovsky estimated that roughly a quarter of the Klezmer music he had collected was in Freygish. Among the most well-known pieces composed in this mode are &quot;Hava Nagila&quot; and &quot;&quot;. It is comparable to the Maqam Hijaz found in Arabic music.
* , &quot;Av HaRachamim&quot;, &quot;altered Dorian&quot; or Ukrainian Dorian scale is a minor mode which has a raised fourth. It is sometimes compared to .

==History==
===Europe===
====Development of the genre====
The Bible has several descriptions of orchestras and Levites making music, but after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, many rabbis discouraged musical instruments. Therefore, while there may have been Jewish musicians in different times and places since then, the &quot;Klezmer&quot; arose much more recently. The earliest written record of the use of the word was identified by as being in a Jewish council meeting from Kraków in 1595. They may have existed even earlier in Prague, as references to them have been found as early as 1511 and 1533. It was in the 1600s that the situation of Jewish musicians in Poland improved, as they gained the right to form Guilds (&quot;Khevre&quot;), and therefore to set their own fees, hire Christians, and so on. Therefore over time this new form of professional musician developed new forms of music and elaborated this tradition across a wide area of Eastern European Jewish life. The rise of Hasidic Judaism in the late eighteenth century and onwards also contributed to the development of klezmer, due to their emphasis on dancing and wordless melodies as a component of Jewish practice.
====The Eastern European klezmer profession (1700–1930s)====
The nineteenth century also saw the rise of a number of klezmer violin virtuosos who combined the techniques of classical violinists such as Ivan Khandoshkin and of Bessarabian folk violinists, and who composed dance and display pieces that became widespread even after the composers were gone. Among these figures were Aron-Moyshe Kholodenko &quot;Pedotser&quot;, Yosef Drucker &quot;Stempenyu&quot;, Alter Goyzman &quot;Alter Chudnover&quot; and Josef Gusikov.

Unlike in the United States, where there was a robust Klezmer recording industry, there was relatively less recorded in Europe in the early twentieth century. The majority of European recordings of Jewish music consisted of Cantorial and Yiddish Theatre music, with only a few dozen known to exist of Klezmer music. These include violin pieces by artists such as Oscar Zehngut, Jacob Gegna, H. Steiner, Leon Ahl, and Josef Solinski; flute pieces by S. Kosch, and ensemble recordings by Belf&#x27;s Romanian Orchestra, the Russian-Jewish Orchestra, Jewish Wedding Orchestra, and Titunshnayder&#x27;s Orchestra.

====Klezmer in the late Russian empire and Soviet era====
The loosening of restrictions on Jews in the Russian Empire, and their newfound access to academic and conservatory training, created a class of scholars who began to reexamine and evaluate klezmer using modern techniques. Abraham Zevi Idelsohn was one such figure, who sought to find an ancient Middle Eastern origin for Jewish music in the diaspora. There was also new interest in collecting and studying Jewish music and folklore, including Yiddish songs, folk tales, and instrumental music. An early expedition was by Joel Engel, who collected folk melodies in his birthplace of Berdyansk in 1900. The first figure to collect large amounts of klezmer music was Susman Kiselgof, who made several expeditions to the Pale of Settlement from 1907 to 1915. He was soon followed by other scholars such as Moisei Beregovsky and Sofia Magid, Soviet scholars of Yiddish and klezmer music. Most of the materials collected in those expeditions are now held by the Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine.
 Beregovsky, writing in the late 1930s, lamented how little scholars knew about the range of playing technique and social context of Klezmers from past eras, except for the late nineteenth century which could be investigated through elderly musicians who still remembered it.

Jewish music in the Soviet Union, and the continued use of klezmer music, went through several phases of official support or censorship. The officially supported Soviet Jewish musical culture of 1920s involved works based on or satirizing traditional melodies and themes, whereas those of the 1930s were often &quot;Russian&quot; cultural works translated into a Yiddish context. After 1948, Soviet Jewish culture entered a phase of repression, meaning that Jewish music concerts, whether tied to Hebrew, Yiddish, or instrumental klezmer, were no longer allowed to be performed. Moisei Beregovsky&#x27;s academic work was shut down in 1949 and he was arrested and deported to Siberia in 1951. The repression was eased in the mid-1950s as some Jewish and Yiddish performances were allowed to return to the stage once again. However, the main venue for klezmer has always been traditional community events and weddings, not the concert stage or academic institute; those traditional venues were repressed along with Jewish culture in general, according to anti-religious Soviet policy.

===United States===
====Early American klezmer (1880s–1910s)====
The first klezmers to arrive in the United States followed the first large waves of Eastern European Jewish immigration which began after 1880, establishing themselves mainly in large cities like New York, Philadelphia and Boston. Klezmers—often younger members of klezmer families, or less established musicians—started to arrive from the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Romania and Austria-Hungary. Some of them found work in restaurants, dance halls, union rallies, wine cellars, and other modern venues in places like New York&#x27;s Lower East Side. But the major source of income for klezmer musicians seems to have remained weddings and Simchas, as in Europe. Those early generations of klezmers are much more poorly documented than those working in the 1910s and 1920s; many never recorded or published music, although some are remembered through family or community history, such as the Lemish klezmer family of Iași, Romania, who arrived in Philadelphia in the 1880s and established a klezmer dynasty there.

====Big band klezmer orchestras (1910s–1920s)====
The vitality of the Jewish music industry in major American cities attracted ever more klezmers from Europe in the 1910s. This coincided with the development of the recording industry, which recorded a number of these klezmer orchestras. By the time of the First World War, the industry turned its attention to ethnic dance music and a number of bandleaders were hired by record companies such as Edison Records, Emerson Records, Okeh Records, and the Victor Recording Company to record 78 rpm discs. The first of these was Abe Elenkrig, a barber and cornet player from a klezmer family in Ukraine whose 1913 recording (From the Wedding) has been recognized by the Library of Congress.

Among the European-born klezmers recording during that decade were some from the Ukrainian territory of the Russian Empire (Abe Elenkrig, Dave Tarras, Shloimke Beckerman, Joseph Frankel, and Israel J. Hochman), some from Austro-Hungarian Galicia (Naftule Brandwein, Harry Kandel and Berish Katz), and some from Romania (Abe Schwartz, Max Leibowitz, Max Yankowitz, Joseph Moskowitz).

The mid-1920s also saw a number of popular novelty &quot;Klezmer&quot; groups which performed on the radio or vaudeville stages. These included Joseph Cherniavsky&#x27;s Yiddish-American Jazz Band, whose members would dress as parodies of Cossacks or Hasidim. Another such group was the Boibriker Kapelle, which performed on the radio and in concerts trying to recreate a nostalgic, old-fashioned Galician Klezmer sound. With the passing of the Immigration Act of 1924, which greatly restricted Jewish immigration from Europe, and then the onset of the Great Depression by 1930, the market for Yiddish and klezmer recordings in the United States saw a steep decline, which essentially ended the recording career of many of the popular bandleaders of the 1910s and 1920s, and made the large klezmer orchestra less viable.

====Celebrity clarinetists====
Along with the rise of klezmer &quot;big bands&quot; in the 1910s and 1920s, a handful of Jewish clarinet players who had led those bands became celebrities in their own right, with a legacy that lasted into subsequent decades. The most popular among these were Naftule Brandwein, Dave Tarras, and Shloimke Beckerman.

====Klezmer revival====
In the mid-to-late 1970s there was a klezmer revival in the United States and Europe, led by Giora Feidman, The Klezmorim, Zev Feldman, Andy Statman, and the Klezmer Conservatory Band. They drew their repertoire from recordings and surviving musicians of U.S. klezmer. In particular, clarinetists such as Dave Tarras and Max Epstein became mentors to this new generation of klezmer musicians. In 1985, Henry Sapoznik and Adrienne Cooper founded KlezKamp to teach klezmer and other Yiddish music.
The 1980s saw a second wave of revival, as interest grew in more traditionally inspired performances with string instruments, largely with non-Jews of the United States and Germany. Musicians began to track down older European klezmer, by listening to recordings, finding transcriptions, and making field recordings of the few klezmorim left in Eastern Europe. Key performers in this style are Joel Rubin, Budowitz, Khevrisa, Di Naye Kapelye, Yale Strom, The Chicago Klezmer Ensemble, The Maxwell Street Klezmer Band, the violinists Alicia Svigals, Steven Greenman, Cookie Segelstein and Elie Rosenblatt, flutist Adrianne Greenbaum, and tsimbl player Pete Rushefsky. Bands like Brave Old World, Hot Pstromi and The Klezmatics also emerged during this period.

In the 1990s, musicians from the San Francisco Bay Area helped further interest in klezmer music by taking it into new territory. Groups such as the New Klezmer Trio inspired a new wave of bands merging klezmer with other forms of music, such as John Zorn&#x27;s Masada and Bar Kokhba, Naftule&#x27;s Dream, Don Byron&#x27;s Mickey Katz project and violinist Daniel Hoffman&#x27;s klezmer/jazz/Middle-Eastern fusion band Davka. The New Orleans Klezmer All-Stars also formed in 1991 with a mixture of New Orleans funk, jazz, and klezmer styles.

Starting in 2008, &quot;The Other Europeans&quot; project, funded by several EU cultural institutions, spent a year doing intensive field research in the region of Moldavia under the leadership of Alan Bern and scholar Zev Feldman. They wanted to explore klezmer and lăutari roots, and fuse the music of the two &quot;other European&quot; groups. The resulting band now performs internationally.

A separate klezmer tradition had developed in Israel in the 20th century. Clarinetists Moshe Berlin and Avrum Leib Burstein are known exponents of the klezmer style in Israel. To preserve and promote klezmer music in Israel, Burstein founded the Jerusalem Klezmer Association, which has become a center for learning and performance of klezmer music in the country.

Since the late 1980s, an annual klezmer festival is held every summer in Safed, in the north of Israel.

==Popular culture==
===In music===
While traditional performances may have been on the decline, many Jewish composers who had mainstream success, such as Leonard Bernstein and Aaron Copland, continued to be influenced by the klezmeric idioms heard during their youth (as Gustav Mahler had been). George Gershwin was familiar with klezmer music, and the opening clarinet glissando of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; suggests this influence, although the composer did not compose klezmer directly. Some clarinet stylings of swing jazz bandleaders Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw can be interpreted as having been derived from klezmer, as can the &quot;freilach swing&quot; playing of other Jewish artists of the period such as trumpeter Ziggy Elman.

At the same time, non-Jewish composers were also turning to klezmer for a prolific source of fascinating thematic material. Dmitri Shostakovich in particular admired klezmer music for embracing both the ecstasy and the despair of human life, and quoted several melodies in his chamber masterpieces, the Piano Quintet in G minor, op. 57 (1940), the Piano Trio No. 2 in E minor, op. 67 (1944), and the String Quartet No. 8 in C minor, op. 110 (1960).

The compositions of Israeli-born composer Ofer Ben-Amots incorporate aspects of klezmer music, most notably his 2006 composition &quot;Klezmer Concerto&quot;. The piece is for klezmer clarinet (written for Jewish clarinetist David Krakauer), string orchestra, harp and percussion.

===In visual art===

The figure of the klezmer, as a romantic symbol of nineteenth century Jewish life, appeared in the art of a number of twentieth century Jewish artists such as Anatoli Lvovich Kaplan, Issachar Ber Ryback, Marc Chagall, and Chaim Goldberg. Kaplan, making his art in the Soviet Union, was quite taken by the romantic images of the Klezmer in literature, and in particular in Sholem Aleichem&#x27;s Stempenyu, and depicted them in rich detail.

===In literature===
In Jewish literature, the klezmer was often represented as a romantic and somewhat unsavory figure. However, in nineteenth century works by writers such as Mendele Mocher Sforim and Sholem Aleichem they were also portrayed as great artists and virtuosos who delighted the masses. Klezmers also appeared in non-Jewish Eastern European literature, such as in the epic poem &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot;, which depicted a character named Jankiel Cymbalist, or in the short stories of Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. In George Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Daniel Deronda&quot; (1876), the German Jewish music teacher is named Herr Julius Klesmer. The novel was later adapted into a Yiddish musical by Avram Goldfaden titled (1908).

<text>In organic chemistry, a condensation reaction is a type of chemical reaction in which two molecules are combined to form a single molecule, usually with the loss of a small molecule such as water. If water is lost, the reaction is also known as a dehydration synthesis. However other molecules can also be lost, such as ammonia, ethanol, acetic acid and hydrogen sulfide.

The addition of the two molecules typically proceeds in a step-wise fashion to the addition product, usually in equilibrium, and with loss of a water molecule (hence the name condensation). The reaction may otherwise involve the functional groups of the molecule, and is a versatile class of reactions that can occur in acidic or basic conditions or in the presence of a catalyst. This class of reactions is a vital part of life as it is essential to the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids and to the biosynthesis of fatty acids.

Many variations of condensation reactions exist. Common examples include the aldol condensation and the Knoevenagel condensation, which both form water as a by-product, as well as the Claisen condensation and the Dieckman condensation (intramolecular Claisen condensation), which form alcohols as by-products.

== Synthesis of prebiotic molecules ==

Condensation reactions likely played major roles in the synthesis of the first biotic molecules including early peptides and nucleic acids. In fact, condensation reactions would be required at multiple steps in RNA oligomerization: the condensation of nucleobases and sugars, nucleoside phosphorylation, and nucleotide polymerization.

<doc id="172827" wikidata="Q529344" url="?curid=172827" title="Ron Wyden">
<text>Ronald Lee Wyden ( ; born May 3, 1949) is an American politician serving as the senior United States senator from Oregon, a seat he has held since 1996. A member of the Democratic Party, he served in the United States House of Representatives from 1981 until 1996. He is the dean of Oregon&#x27;s congressional delegation and serves as the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. Known for his libertarian-leaning stances within the Democratic Party, Wyden has been a prominent advocate for privacy rights, internet freedom, and limiting government surveillance, positioning him as a defender of civil liberties.
==Early life, education, and early career==
Ronald Wyden was born in Wichita, Kansas, the son of Edith (née Rosenow) and Peter H. Wyden (originally Weidenreich, 1923–1998), both of whom were Jewish and had fled Nazi Germany. He grew up in Palo Alto, California, where he played basketball for Palo Alto High School. He attended the University of California, Santa Barbara, on a basketball scholarship, and later transferred to Stanford University, where he majored in political science and received his Bachelor of Arts in 1971. He received a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Oregon School of Law in 1974, but has never been a member of the Oregon State Bar.

While teaching gerontology at several Oregon universities, Wyden founded the Oregon chapter of the Gray Panthers, which he led from 1974 to 1980. He was also the director of the Oregon Legal Services Center for Elderly, a nonprofit law service. From 1977 to 1979 he served on the Oregon State Board of Examiners of Nursing Home Administrators.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

Wyden ran for the United States House of Representatives in 1980. In the Democratic primary, Wyden, who was just 31 at the time, upset incumbent Representative Bob Duncan in , which includes most of Portland. Later that fall, Wyden defeated his Republican opponent, Darrell Conger, with 71% of the vote. The 3rd has long been the most Democratic district in Oregon, and Wyden was reelected seven times, never with less than 70% of the vote.

In the House, Wyden played an influential role in the passage of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996.

==U.S. Senate==
===Elections===

==== 1996 Special ====
In January 1996, in a special election to fill the Senate seat vacated by Bob Packwood, Wyden defeated Oregon State Senate President Gordon Smith by just over 18,000 votes, mainly due to swamping Smith by over 89,000 votes in Multnomah County. Smith won the November 1996 Senate election to succeed the retiring Mark Hatfield, and Smith and Wyden served together until Smith&#x27;s defeat in 2008 by Democrat Jeff Merkley.

Wyden holds the Senate seat that was once held by Wayne Morse, a man whom Wyden worked for in the summer of 1968 as Morse&#x27;s driver, and whom Wyden calls his mentor.

==== 1998 ====

Wyden was elected to a full term in 1998 with 61% of the vote.

==== 2004 ====

Wyden was reelected in 2004 with 64% of the vote to Republican nominee Al King&#x27;s 31%.

==== 2010 ====

In 2010, Wyden was reelected with 57% of the vote to Jim Huffman&#x27;s 39%.

==== 2016 ====

In 2016, Wyden was reelected with 57% of the vote to Republican nominee Mark Callahan&#x27;s 33%.

==== 2022 ====

In 2022, Wyden was reelected with 56% of the vote to Republican nominee Jo Rae Perkins&#x27;s 41%.

===Tenure===
In June 1996, Wyden offered an amendment to the mission of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that was endorsed by Transportation Secretary Federico F. Peña. In September, Wyden joined Wendell H. Ford in requesting that the FAA publicize information on the federal government&#x27;s reason for not making safety data on the airlines more readily available to travelers.

In late 1999, Wyden threatened a filibuster amid Senate debate over banning physician-assisted suicide.

In May 2000, Wyden and Republican Representative Bill Thomas announced they would collaborate on an attempt to add prescription drug benefits to Medicare that year.

In January 2001, Wyden and Chuck Schumer were the only two senators on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to vote against the confirmation of Gale Norton as United States Secretary of the Interior. Wyden admitted reluctance in his opposition and said he hoped that Norton would change his view of her.

In February 2001, after the U.S. Department of Transportation&#x27;s Inspector General&#x27;s Office released a report on airlines providing &quot;untimely, incomplete, or unreliable reports&quot; on flight delays and cancellations, Wyden said the matter amounted to a &quot;failure to communicate honestly about delays and cancellations&quot; as well as the bumping of passengers from flights and that Congress was capable of taking action to give passengers &quot;timely, accurate information and reasonable service.&quot; In March, Wyden stated his support for ending a federal rule requiring commercial pilots to cease flying after age 60.

In April 2001, Wyden joined Gordon H. Smith in introducing a proposal for a change in a budget resolution, saying Congress not responding at a time of layoffs was &quot;nothing short of government malpractice.&quot; The change was adopted without dissent.

In May 2001, Wyden released a letter by Inspector General Kenneth M. Mead in which he stated that airlines had admitted to him that they deliberately delayed some evening flights to accommodate late-arriving passengers who would otherwise have had to wait until the next morning without notifying passengers of the change in schedule. During an address to the International Aviation Club days later, Wyden warned that airlines that persisted in fighting modest steps like informing the public of perpetually late flights would encounter more burdensome requirements later.

In January 2002, Wyden charged Enron with resorting &quot;to a variety of legal, regulatory and accounting contortions to keep investors and the public in the dark&quot; and called for Congress to begin an investigation into the matter. In February, he said that thousands of Oregonians had been harmed by Enron&#x27;s collapse and advocated that the Senate Commerce Committee continue inquiring about Enron until they had all the facts.

In March 2002, amid the Senate&#x27;s inability to reach an agreement on legislation intended to overhaul American election procedures, Wyden said the bill was &quot;not a corpse&quot; and must not disrupt Oregon&#x27;s and Washington&#x27;s vote-by-mail systems.

In November 2003, Wyden announced his support for the Bush administration-backed Medicare bill, touted as &quot;the biggest expansion of Medicare since its creation in 1965.&quot;

In April 2004, Wyden was among a group of senators who took to the Senate floor to endorse a permanent ban on taxes on Internet access. Wyden said the subject was &quot;about as interesting as prolonged root-canal work&quot; but that it was &quot;fair to say that the decisions the Senate makes with respect to this subject will say a whole lot about the future of the Internet.&quot;

In August 2004, amid Democratic opposition to the nomination of Porter Goss for Director of Central Intelligence, Wyden said that Democrats were aware &quot;of what happened in the last election cycle on homeland security&quot; and that he hoped &quot;that Democrats aren&#x27;t accused by anybody of being obstructionist just by asking tough questions.&quot;

In December 2004, Wyden was one of four Democratic senators to refuse to sign &quot;conference sheets&quot; used by the House-Senate conference committee that was working on the 2005 intelligence authorization bill, the four objecting to a classified item in the bill that they believed the funding of which &quot;should be expended on other intelligence programs that will make a surer and greater contribution to national security.&quot;

On March 2, 2006, Wyden unveiled the Internet Nondiscrimination Act of 2006, legislation intended to prohibit network operators from charging companies &quot;for faster delivery of their content to consumers over the internet or favoring certain content over others.&quot; He said a two-tier system &quot;could have a chilling effect on small mom and pop businesses that can&#x27;t afford the priority lane, leaving these smaller businesses no hope of competing against the Wal-Marts of the world&quot; and that neutrality in technology allowed &quot;small businesses to thrive on the Internet&quot;.

In July 2009, President Barack Obama praised Wyden as a &quot;real thought leader&quot; and an ally on health care reform, but announced he would not support Wyden&#x27;s health care plan because parts of it were too radical for the United States.

Wyden characterizes himself as an &quot;independent voice for Oregonians and the nation&quot; and emphasizes his positions on health care reform, national security, consumer protection, and government transparency. &quot;On the Issues&quot; characterizes him as a &quot;Hard-Core Liberal.&quot;

On March 6, 2013, Wyden crossed party lines to join Republican Senator Rand Paul, who was engaged in a talking filibuster to block voting on the nomination of John O. Brennan as the Director of the CIA. Wyden questioned the use of drones, saying, &quot;what it comes down to is every American has the right to know when their government believes that it is allowed to kill them.&quot;
&quot;Politico&quot; reported that Wyden&#x27;s ascent to chair of the Senate Finance Committee would vault him into the ranks of the chamber&#x27;s most influential. He has been praised for his ability to defuse partisan tensions and encourage bipartisan cooperation.

In August 2016, in response to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump&#x27;s refusal to disclose his tax returns, Wyden and Chris Murphy announced that they would press for consideration of Wyden&#x27;s bill that if enacted would require major-party presidential nominees to disclose at least three years of tax returns and thereby authorize the Treasury Department to release Trump&#x27;s returns over Trump&#x27;s objections. Wyden asserted that Americans expect candidates to release their tax returns and Trump&#x27;s break from tradition was &quot;an exceptional moment where a long-standing precedent has been broken, and it presents enormous peril to the public to have this information as private.&quot;

In May 2017, after Trump announced the firing of FBI Director James Comey, Wyden restated his past criticisms and said the decision to fire him amid investigation of Trump and his associate into possible Russian ties was &quot;outrageous&quot;. Wyden advocated that Comey be called to testify in an open hearing about the investigation of Russia and Trump associates at the time his tenure was terminated.

In August 2017, Wyden was one of four senators to unveil the Internet of Things Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2017, legislation intended to establish &quot;thorough, yet flexible, guidelines for Federal Government procurements of connected devices.&quot;

In December 2017, Wyden called for Trump to resign over allegations of sexual misconduct and said Congress should investigate the matter in the event Trump decided to remain in office.

In May 2018, Wyden was one of six Democratic senators to sign a letter asking that all members of Senate be authorized to read a report from the Department of Justice underpinning the decision to not seek charges in the CIA&#x27;s destruction of videotapes.

In July 2018, after Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, Wyden said Trump had begun &quot;a forced march back to the days when women&#x27;s health care choices were made by government&quot; and &quot;a direct attempt to overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;.&quot;

On August 1, 2018, Wyden announced his intent to put a formal hold on Treasury deputy secretary nominee Justin Muzinich after his confirmation by the Senate Finance Committee. He also confirmed his support for IRS general counsel nominee Michael Desmond and criticized Treasury consideration of indexing capital gains taxes to inflation as contributing extra tax savings to the wealthy along with possibly being illegal.

In August 2018, after the White House barred CNN reporter Kaitlan Collins from covering an open press event after she repeatedly asked Trump about his relationship with his former attorney Michael Cohen, Wyden cosponsored a resolution urging Trump to respect the press.

On July 9, 2024, it was reported that Wyden and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse sent an official letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland the previous week requesting that he appoint a special counsel to investigate Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas for tax and ethics violations. The letter says, &quot;The breadth of the omissions uncovered to date, and the serious possibility of additional tax fraud and false statement violations by Justice Thomas and his associates, warrant the appointment of a Special Counsel to investigate this misconduct.&quot;

===Committee assignments===
Wyden&#x27;s committee assignments for the 118th Congress are as follows:
*Committee on the Budget
*Committee on Energy and Natural Resources
**Subcommittee on Energy
**Subcommittee on Public Lands, Forests and Mining
**Subcommittee on Water and Power (Chair)
*Committee on Finance (Chair)
** As Chair, Wyden is an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of all subcommittees.
*Select Committee on Intelligence
*Joint Committee On Taxation (Vice Chair)

===Caucus memberships===
* Congressional Coalition on Adoption
*Congressional Fire Services Caucus
*Congressional Internet Caucus
*International Conservation Caucus
*Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus
*Senate Diabetes Caucus

==Political positions==
===Civil liberties===
====Abortion====
Wyden supports legal abortion. Almost every year, he has maintained a 100% rating or close to it with pro-choice groups: NARAL Pro-Choice America, Planned Parenthood, and National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, and a 0% rating or close to it from the National Right to Life Committee.

====Assisted suicide====
Wyden personally opposes assisted suicide and said he voted against the Oregon Death with Dignity Act, first enacted in Oregon in 1997, each time it appeared on the ballot by voter referendum. Nevertheless, he successfully blocked congressional attempts to pass federal legislation to override Oregon&#x27;s law. In 2000, Wyden blocked attempts in Congress to overturn the Oregon assisted-suicide law by threatening a filibuster. In 2001, he wrote to President George W. Bush urging him to not alter the law through federal executive action. In 2005, he and four other Democratic members of Oregon&#x27;s congressional delegation filed an amicus brief in the Supreme Court case of &quot;Gonzales v. Oregon&quot; in support of the State of Oregon, and praised the eventual decision to uphold the law. In 2006, Wyden informed Senate leadership that he would block legislation overturning the Death with Dignity Act. In 2009 he said that he would continue to &quot;fight tooth and nail&quot; to block new federal attempts to block the law.

====Gun control====
Wyden has been an advocate of gun control. He voted against limiting lawsuits against gun manufacturers and in favor of increasing background checks. Wyden also voted to renew the Federal Assault Weapons Ban.

In October 2015, Wyden was one of the Senate Democrats to unveil a new gun control campaign in the aftermath of the Umpqua Community College shooting. Wyden said the three areas the senators were focusing on, that of increasing background check requirements, closing &quot;loopholes&quot; on background checks when guns are purchased at gun shows or online, and closing the &quot;pipeline of illegal guns&quot; by rendering gun trafficking as a federal crime, were &quot;common sense&quot; and should have bipartisan support.

In January 2016, Wyden was one of 18 senators to call on the appropriations committee leadership to hold a hearing on funding for gun violence research at the CDC and spoke with other Democratic senators and researchers supporting federal funding for investigation into gun violence prevention.

At a March 2018 town hall, Wyden answered &quot;Yes&quot; when asked if he intended to pass bans on bump stocks and assault rifles. He expressed optimism about the chances of passing national gun legislation, noting that legislation passed in Florida in the wake of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting was strong enough to warrant lawsuit by the NRA. In July, Wyden confirmed he had joined other senators in introducing legislation intended to ensure gun dealers were not engaging in illegal sales and bestowing the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives with clear enforcement mechanisms. He said gun violence &quot;demands real action by Congress&quot; and the legislation &quot;takes a long-overdue critical step in the right direction, holding gun dealers accountable for illegal sales, reducing the number of guns that fall into the wrong hands.&quot;

In February 2019, Wyden was one of 38 senators to sign a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham calling on him to &quot;hold a hearing&quot; on universal background checks and noting Graham&#x27;s statement that he &quot;intended to have the Committee work on ‘red flag’ legislation and potentially also background checks, both actions&quot; the senators supported.

====LGBTQIA+ rights====
In late 1995, Wyden became the first U.S. Senate candidate (and then senator) to publicly support same-sex marriage. He was one of just 14 senators to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996. He has voted against the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment, which would have proposed an amendment to the Constitution to bar recognition of same-sex marriages. Despite undergoing tests in advance of prostate surgery scheduled two days later, Wyden appeared in the Senate chamber in December 2010 to vote for the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010.

In May 2017, Wyden was one of 46 senators to introduce the Equality Act of 2017, described by Representative David Cicilline as ensuring &quot;that every LGBT person can live their lives free from the fear of discrimination. Above all, it’s about honoring the values that have guided our nation since its founding. It’s critical that Congress pass the Equality Act into law.&quot;

In October 2018, Wyden was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging him to reverse the rollback of a policy that granted visas to same-sex partners of LGBTQIA+ diplomats who had unions not recognized by their home countries, writing that too many places around the world have seen LGBTQIA+ individuals &quot;subjected to discrimination and unspeakable violence, and receive little or no protection from the law or local authorities&quot; and that the US refusing to let LGBTQIA+ diplomats bring their partners to the US would be equivalent of America upholding &quot;the discriminatory policies of many countries around the world.&quot;

====National language====
In June 2007, Wyden was among the minority of Democrats to vote in favor of declaring English the official language of the United States.

====Net neutrality====
In September 2017, Wyden was one of nine senators to sign a letter to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai that charged the FCC with failing &quot;to provide stakeholders with an opportunity to comment on the tens of thousands of filed complaints that directly shed light on proposed changes to existing net neutrality protections.&quot;

In March 2018, Wyden was one of 10 senators to sign a letter spearheaded by Jeff Merkley lambasting a proposal by Pai that would curb the scope of benefits from the Lifeline program during a period where roughly 6.5 million people in poor communities relied on Lifeline to receive access to high-speed Internet, writing that it was Pai&#x27;s &quot;obligation to the American public, as the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, to improve the Lifeline program and ensure that more Americans can afford access, and have means of access, to broadband and phone service.&quot; The senators also advocated for insuring &quot;Lifeline reaches more Americans in need of access to communication services.&quot;

====Patriot Act====
Wyden joined the Senate Intelligence Committee in January 2001, and voted for the Patriot Act following 9/11. In 2006, he was one of 10 senators to vote against reauthorizing the Patriot Act.

In 2011, with the expiration of the Patriot Act approaching and efforts to reauthorize it intensifying, Wyden and Merkley sharply criticized the rush to pass the bill. Wyden said on the Senate floor, &quot;The Patriot Act was passed a decade ago during a period of understandable fear. Now is the time to revisit this, revisit it and ensure that a better job is done of striking that balance between fighting terror and protecting individual liberty.&quot; Wyden and Merkley expressed particular concern about a provision of current law allowing law enforcement authorities to collect &quot;a vast array of business records, emails, phone numbers, [and] even DNA from anyone deemed &#x27;relevant&#x27; to an investigation.&quot; Wyden offered an amendment to reform the &quot;business-records provision&quot; of the Patriot Act, which he views as being used in an abusive and secret way.

In a Senate speech two days later, Wyden sharply criticized the use of Patriot Act, saying: &quot;The fact is that anyone can read the plain text of the Patriot Act, and yet many members of Congress have no idea how the law is being secretly interpreted by the executive branch, because that interpretation is classified. It&#x27;s almost as if there were two Patriot Acts, and many members of Congress have not read the one that matters. Our constituents, of course, are totally in the dark. Members of the public have no access to the secret legal interpretations, so they have no idea what their government believes the law actually means.
In an interview for the January 2013 documentary &quot;Dirty Wars: The World is a Battlefield&quot;, Wyden was asked about legal reviews and the scope of potential assassinations (or &quot;targeted killings&quot;) of American citizens by their government, and responded, &quot;the American people would be extraordinarily surprised if they could see the difference between what they believe a law says and how it has actually been interpreted in secret&quot;, but that he &quot;is not permitted&quot; to disclose the difference publicly.

Per a 2013 &quot;Washington Post&quot; article, Wyden&#x27;s concerns &quot;stemmed from top-secret information he had learned as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee&quot;, a position he&#x27;d held for a dozen years by 2013, but he was &quot;bound by secrecy rules.&quot;

On March 12, 2013, during a United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing, Wyden quoted NSA director Keith B. Alexander&#x27;s keynote speech at the 2012 DEF CON. Alexander had said that &quot;Our job is foreign intelligence&quot; and that &quot;those who would want to weave the story that we have millions or hundreds of millions of dossiers on people, is absolutely false... From my perspective, this is absolute nonsense.&quot; Wyden then asked James Clapper, &quot;Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?&quot; He responded, &quot;No, sir.&quot; Wyden asked, &quot;It does not?&quot; and Clapper said, &quot;Not wittingly. There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.&quot;

When Edward Snowden was asked during a 2014 television interview what the decisive moment was or what caused him to whistle-blow, he replied: &quot;Sort of the breaking point was seeing the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, directly lie under oath to Congress. ... Seeing that really meant for me there was no going back.&quot;

Following news of Snowden&#x27;s leaks in early June 2013, Wyden noted on June 11 that Clapper&#x27;s office had been provided with the question a day in advance of the hearing and was given the opportunity following Clapper&#x27;s testimony to amend his response.

===Defense and foreign policy===
On November 10, 2005, Wyden was one of five Senate Democrats who joined 44 Republicans in voting for Amendment no. 2516, brought to the floor by Republican senator Lindsey Graham, which ruled that enemy combatants did not have the right to Habeas Corpus.

====Cybersecurity====
In September 2018, Wyden was one of five senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging him to employ more multifactor authentication measures in order to secure the State Department&#x27;s information systems and seeking answers on how the department would boost its security after the Office of Management and Budget designated the department&#x27;s cyber-readiness as &quot;high risk&quot; as well as what the department would do to address the lack of multifactor authentication required by law and for statistics detailing the department&#x27;s cyber incidents over the preceding three years.

In December 2020, in light of the 2020 United States federal government data breach, Wyden renewed calls for the introduction of mandatory security reviews for software used by federal agencies.

====Iran====
In 2007 Wyden and Representative Gabby Giffords sponsored the Stop Arming Iran Act, which would have barred the Defense Department from selling surplus F-14 parts and prohibited buyers who had already acquired surplus Tomcat parts from exporting them in order to prevent Iran from acquiring the parts.

In July 2017, Wyden voted for the Countering America&#x27;s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act that placed sanctions on Iran, Russia and North Korea.

====Iraq====
Wyden was one of 23 senators to vote against the authorization of military force in Iraq in 2002. In 2003, he voted to bar excessive overseas deployments of members of the National Guard and Reserves. In 2006, Wyden was one of 13 senators to vote to require the redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq by July 2007, and one of 39 senators to vote to call on President George W. Bush to begin withdrawing forces from Iraq and establish a timeline for withdrawal. Wyden also voted many other times for withdrawal of combat forces from Iraq, against funding for the war without binding timelines, and against the establishment of permanent military bases in Iraq. He also opposed President Barack Obama&#x27;s plan for a &quot;troop surge&quot; in Afghanistan in 2009.

====Israel====
In September 2016, in advance of a UN Security Council resolution 2334 condemning Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories, Wyden signed an AIPAC-sponsored letter urging Obama to veto &quot;one-sided&quot; resolutions against Israel.

In May 2017, Wyden co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, Senate Bill 720, which made it a federal crime, punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment, for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government. The bill would make it legal for U.S. states to refuse to do business with contractors that engage in boycotts against Israel.

====Libya====
In 2011, Wyden supported the no-fly zone and military intervention in Libya in order to protect civilians, saying, &quot;The violence of Colonel [Muammar] Gaddafi against his own people is a humanitarian crisis. I support the international effort to protect the civilians of Libya.&quot; Wyden also stressed that his support was not unlimited and that he expected that the military action would be completed quickly. Along with Obama and Senator Merkley, Wyden agreed that U.S. forces should not be on the ground in Libya.

====Myanmar====
Wyden condemned the genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar and called for a stronger response to the crisis.

====Russia====
In December 2010, Wyden voted for the ratification of New START, a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the U.S. and the Russian Federation obliging both countries to have no more than 1,550 strategic warheads and 700 launchers deployed during the next seven years along with providing a continuation of on-site inspections that halted when START I expired the previous year. It was the first arms treaty with Russia in eight years.

In December 2018, after United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the Trump administration was suspending its obligations in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 60 days in the event that Russia continued to violate the treaty, Wyden was one of 26 senators to sign a letter expressing concern that the administration was &quot;abandoning generations of bipartisan U.S. leadership around the paired goals of reducing the global role and number of nuclear weapons and ensuring strategic stability with America&#x27;s nuclear-armed adversaries&quot; and calling on Trump to continue arms negotiations.

====Saudi Arabia====
In March 2018, Wyden voted against tabling a resolution spearheaded by Bernie Sanders, Chris Murphy, and Mike Lee that would have required Trump to withdraw American troops either in or influencing Yemen within the next 30 days unless they were combating Al-Qaeda.

====Syria====
Wyden&#x27;s office has questioned the CIA-led Timber Sycamore covert operation to train and arm Syrian rebels, releasing a statement that &quot;the US is trying to build up the battlefield capabilities of the anti-Assad opposition, but they haven&#x27;t provided the public with details about how this is being done, which US agencies are involved, or which foreign partners those agencies are working with.&quot;

=== Disaster relief ===
In March 2019, Wyden was one of 11 senators to sign a letter to congressional leaders urging them to &quot;bring legislation providing disaster supplemental appropriations to your respective floors for consideration immediately&quot; after noting that the previous year had seen 124 federal disaster declarations approved for states, territories, and tribal nations.

=== Drug policy ===

Wyden has supported efforts to legalize cannabis at the federal level, cosponsoring the Marijuana Justice Act in 2017 and the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act in 2019. He also introduced Senate Bill 420 in 2019 to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act and tax it similarly to alcohol.

In December 2018, Wyden was one of 21 senators to sign a letter to FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb stating their approval of the agency&#x27;s actions to hinder youth access to e-cigarettes and urging the FDA &quot;to take additional, stronger steps to prevent and reduce e-cigarette use among youth&quot;.

=== Education ===
In June 2017, Wyden, Elizabeth Warren, Mike Lee, and Tim Scott introduced legislation allowing graduate students to allocate money from stipends and fellowships into tax-deferred individual retirement accounts (IRAs).

===Health care===
In 2009, Wyden sponsored the Healthy Americans Act, an act that would institute a national system of market-based private insurance. Union interests attacked him for advocating replacement of the employer tax exclusion with a tax deduction that would apply to all Americans.

Wyden supported increasing Medicare funding, enrolling more of the uninsured in federal programs (although his Healthy Americans Act would eliminate many of these programs including Medicaid and SCHIP and replace them with private insurance), importing lower priced prescriptions from Canada, and negotiating bulk drug purchases for Medicare in order to lower costs.

In 2003, Wyden joined Senators Lindsey Graham and Trent Lott to help pass the Bush administration&#x27;s Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act. The Bush administration is alleged to have forced officials to hide its true cost, which was triple its original claim. The bill has been criticized as favoring pharmaceutical companies, as it prohibits the federal government from negotiating prescription drug rates.

Not long after Tom Daschle&#x27;s withdrawal as Obama&#x27;s nominee for United States Secretary of Health and Human Services due to a scandal over his failure to pay taxes, &quot;The Oregonian&quot; reported that Wyden was being touted by many health care experts as a likely candidate for secretary-designate. Although Obama chose Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius instead, Wyden took advantage of the interim to reintroduce his Healthy Americans Act, with additional co-sponsorship from fellow Oregonian Democratic senator Jeff Merkley and Republican senators Lamar Alexander and Bob Bennett.

In late 2011 and early 2012, Wyden attracted attention for working with GOP House Budget Committee Chair Paul Ryan to develop a Medicare reform plan that would result in semi-privatization of the system, provoking a negative response from his Democratic allies, including Obama. The proposal would have kept traditional Medicare as an option, but would also have introduced private health insurance companies into an exchange in which they would offer competing plans to be paid for with government vouchers.

In March 2018, Wyden and Representative Frank Pallone sent a letter to Comptroller General of the United States Gene Dodaro calling for an investigation of eligibility requirements of Medicaid programs, writing, &quot;If CMS continues to approve work requirements and other restrictions on Medicaid, the consequences could be severe for federal spending and the sustainability of the Medicaid program&quot; and that the public &quot;should have complete information about the consequences of proposed Section 1115 waivers to ensure limited taxpayer dollars are being used efficiently, appropriately, and towards the goal of promoting, not obstructing, access to health care.&quot;

In December 2018, Wyden was one of 42 senators to sign a letter to Trump administration officials Alex Azar, Seema Verma, and Steven Mnuchin arguing that the administration was improperly using Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act to authorize states to &quot;increase health care costs for millions of consumers while weakening protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions.&quot; The senators requested the administration withdraw the policy and &quot;re-engage with stakeholders, states, and Congress.&quot;

In January 2019, during the 2018–19 United States federal government shutdown, Wyden was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to Commissioner of Food and Drugs Scott Gottlieb recognizing the FDA&#x27;s efforts to address the shutdown&#x27;s effect on public health and employees while remaining alarmed &quot;that the continued shutdown will result in increasingly harmful effects on the agency’s employees and the safety and security of the nation’s food and medical products.&quot;

=== Immigration ===
In November 2018, Wyden was one of 11 senators to sign a letter to then-United States Secretary of Defense James Mattis about &quot;the overt politicization of the military&quot; with the Trump administration&#x27;s deployment of 5,800 troops to the U.S.–Mexico border and requesting a briefing and written justification from the U.S. Northern Command for troop deployment while urging Mattis to &quot;curb the unprecedented escalation of DOD involvement in immigration enforcement.&quot;

In January 2019, Wyden was one of 20 senators to sponsor the Dreamer Confidentiality Act, a bill that would ban the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from passing information collected on DACA recipients to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Department of Justice, or any other law enforcement agency with exceptions in the case of fraudulent claims, national security issues, or non-immigration related felonies being investigated.

In the past, Wyden voted to continue federal funds for declared &quot;sanctuary cities&quot; and to declare English as the official language of the U.S. government.

===Science and environment===
Wyden voted for the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005, which would change federal law to allow federal money to fund embryonic stem-cell research, ending a federal ban. He urged President Bush to sign it, saying, &quot;I see no reason why embryonic stem-cell research should be treated any differently than other research&quot; in terms of federal grant funding. Bush vetoed the act twice. In 2007, Wyden and Senator Gordon Smith again supported the bill.

Wyden is a supporter of environmental protection measures, and was among the minority of senators to vote against confirming the appointment of Gale Norton as Secretary of the Interior. In May 2007, he also opposed the appointment of Lyle Laverty as assistant interior secretary for fish, wildlife and parks, this time on ethical grounds.

====Climate change====
On April 6, 2011, Wyden voted against limiting the EPA&#x27;s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. On March 22, 2013, he voted against concurrent resolution creating a point of order that would make it harder for Congress to put a price on carbon. In November 2015, he voted in support of the Obama administration&#x27;s Clean Power Plan.

In May 2014, in response to the National Climate Assessment, Wyden said that the &quot;report adds to the ever-growing body of scientific evidence and on-the-ground proof that the effects of climate change are already being felt in every region of the United States&quot;. In June 2014, he said that &quot;climate change is the most important environmental challenge of our time&quot;.

In October 2017, Wyden was one of 19 senators to sign a letter to EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, who had been appointed by Donald Trump, questioning Pruitt&#x27;s decision to repeal the Clean Power Plan. The letter asserted that the repeal proposal used &quot;mathematical sleights of hand to over-state the costs of industry compliance with the 2015 Rule and understate the benefits that will be lost if the 2017 repeal is finalized&quot; and that denying science and fabricating math would fail to &quot;satisfy the requirements of the law, nor will it slow the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, the inexorable rise in sea levels, or the other dire effects of global warming that our planet is already experiencing.&quot;

In November 2018, Wyden was one of 25 Democratic senators to cosponsor a resolution specifying key findings of the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change report and National Climate Assessment. The resolution affirmed the senators&#x27; acceptance of the findings and their support for bold action toward addressing climate change.

===Tax policy===

Wyden is critical of the estate tax, which he feels is inefficient, and has voted repeatedly to abolish it. He co-authored the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act, which bans Internet taxes in the United States. He has also voted with Republicans to lower the capital gains tax, to encourage the study of the flat tax, and to require a 3/5 majority to raise taxes. Wyden voted against the Bush tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003. He has also voted against the balanced budget amendment.

Wyden supports lower corporate taxes and was generally supportive of the draft proposal for deficit reduction released by the chairs of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform in November 2010.

Len Burman of the Tax Policy Center has praised Wyden as a legislator who &quot;has worked tirelessly to try to advance the cause of tax reform, [despite having] few allies in this quest.&quot;

In May 2016, Wyden introduced the Presidential Tax Transparency Act, legislation requiring sitting presidents and presidential nominees to release their tax returns publicly. Wyden reintroduced the legislation in January 2019, saying in a statement, &quot;Trump blew off a 40-year, bipartisan, pro-transparency tradition by refusing to release his tax returns—a tradition that dates all the way back to Watergate. It’s not just a matter of the president destroying a good-government campaign tradition.&quot; He called the legislation &quot;the one-two punch needed to keep the Trump administration from stonewalling congressional oversight efforts, and ensure public transparency if Trump&#x27;s tax returns get tied up in court.&quot;

In January 2019, during the 2018–19 United States federal government shutdown, Wyden sent a letter to United States Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and Commissioner of Internal Revenue Charles P. Rettig questioning the possible &quot;increased risk of taxpayer ID theft&quot; in the event the lRS attempted to &quot;maintain normal operations&quot; during the shutdown and related concerns of his constituents &quot;that there may be no resolution in sight&quot;.

In February 2019, Wyden, Roy Blunt, and Tammy Baldwin led nine other senators in sponsoring the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act, legislation imposing a reduction in excise taxes, compliance burdens, and regulations for brewers, cider makers, vintners, and distillers as part of an attempt to ensure the continued growth of the craft beverage industry.

In 2024, Wyden co-sponsored the Stop Predatory Investing Act to ban corporate investors that buy up more than 50 single-family homes from deducting interest or depreciation from their taxes on those properties.

===Technology===
On November 19, 2010, Wyden announced he would take the steps necessary to put a hold on the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA) so it would not be enacted that year. If it were enacted, it would allow the Attorney General the authority to order internet providers in the U.S. to block access to websites deemed to infringe copyright. This effectively required the law to be resubmitted the next year rather than be rushed through the system at the end of the congress. Wyden said:

It seems to me that online copyright infringement is a legitimate problem, but it seems to me that COICA as written is the wrong medicine. Deploying this statute to combat online copyright infringement seems almost like using a bunker-busting cluster bomb when what you really need is a precision-guided missile. The collateral damage of this statute could be American innovation, American jobs, and a secure Internet.

In June 2011, Wyden announced his Geolocation Privacy and Surveillance Act in partnership with Representative Jason Chaffetz. The bill would establish a legal framework for the sharing and access of private tracking data by corporations, individuals, and federal agencies.

Wyden was the first politician in Congress to stand against the controversial Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) (in the House) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA) (in the Senate) on the grounds that it would &quot;step towards an Internet in which those with money and lawyers and access to power have a greater voice than those who don&#x27;t.&quot; Wyden delayed PIPA in the Senate by placing a hold on the legislation in 2010, which prevented it from being considered by the full Senate even after it was unanimously voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Wyden&#x27;s hold was credited with &quot;[g]iving time for the Internet to rally against&quot; SOPA and PIPA. With Representative Darrell Issa in the House, Wyden also introduced the Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act as an alternative to SOPA and PIPA.

Ezra Klein wrote: &quot;Perhaps no single member of Congress deserves as much credit for slowing the advance&quot; of the bills than Wyden, who for much of 2010 &quot;fought a one-man battle to keep the Senate version of the legislation from moving through on a unanimous vote.&quot; Wyden was called the &quot;primary driver of opposition to the bill within the Senate.&quot;

When Senate leadership announced it was indefinitely postponing the bill following &quot;massive protests&quot; in January 2012, Wyden called it a &quot;grassroots victory for the history books.&quot; For his role in fighting against SOPA and PIPA, &quot;The Daily Dot&quot; named Wyden one of the top ten most influential activists of 2012.

====Algorithmic Accountability Act====
On April 10, 2019, Wyden, Senator Cory Booker, and Representative Yvette Clarke introduced the Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2019, legislation granting additional powers to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in addition to forcing companies to study whether race, gender or other biases influence their technology. Wyden said in a statement that computers were &quot;increasingly involved in the most important decisions affecting Americans’ lives&quot; and that too frequently &quot;algorithms depend on biased assumptions or data that can actually reinforce discrimination against women and people of color.&quot;

====Mind Your Own Business Act====
In October 2019, Wyden proposed The Mind Your Own Business Act to allow the FTC to issue penalties for first-time privacy violators of up to 4% of annual revenue, like the European regulation GDPR.

===Trade and business===
====Bailouts====
During the 2007–2008 financial crisis, Wyden voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 backed by the George W. Bush administration. He did not vote on the automobile industry bailout, but said he would have voted for cloture if he had been present. Wyden added, &quot;While I continue to have concerns about ensuring that taxpayers are protected if this loan is to occur, I believe that if the President can unwisely provide $750 billion of taxpayer money for the investment banks who took horribly unacceptable risks and helped trigger an economic collapse, we certainly have a duty to attempt to preserve a cornerstone domestic industry and the jobs of hundreds of thousands of working people whose personal actions are in no way responsible for the current economic crisis.&quot;

In early January 2009, Wyden was among several moderate Democratic senators who criticized President-elect Barack Obama&#x27;s stimulus plan, calling for a greater emphasis on &quot;tangible infrastructure investments&quot; and warning that an effort had to be made to differentiate it from the Bush bailouts Wyden had opposed. Wyden ultimately voted for the bill and mostly voted with his party on various amendments to the bill.

====Bankruptcy====
Wyden voted against the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, a Republican effort to restrict the number of class actions suits against businesses, and the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, a bipartisan change in bankruptcy law designed to make it more difficult to file for bankruptcy and to make those in bankruptcy pay more of their debts. He voted for the previous Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2001 (S-420, substituted by amendment into H.R. 433), which contained many of the same provisions.

====China====
American video game company Activision Blizzard punished a Hong Kong-based professional gamer for supporting the pro-democracy 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. Many felt that Blizzard was cautious about potential repercussions from China&#x27;s government, which had censored any support for the Hong Kong protests. Wyden accused Blizzard of censorship and tweeted: &quot;Blizzard shows it is willing to humiliate itself to please the Chinese Communist Party. No American company should censor calls for freedom to make a quick buck.&quot;

====Cuba====
Wyden supports lifting the United States embargo against Cuba as a more viable way to reach the Cuban people. In 2016, he and Senator Byron Dorgan offered an unsuccessful amendment to end funding for TV Martí, an anti-Castro broadcasting project of the U.S. government aimed at Cuba. Dorgan and Wyden argued that the U.S. should &quot;pull the plug on U.S. government television broadcasts to Cuba, broadcasts even the American government acknowledges Fidel Castro routinely jams and the Cuban people can&#x27;t see&quot;, calling it a &quot;complete and total waste of taxpayers&#x27; dollars&quot; and noting that the transmissions would cost $21.1 million in the next year, but would &quot;reach virtually no one in Cuba.&quot; The amendment was not adopted.

====Free trade====
Wyden supports free trade. In the House, he voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement, and he has supported many trade deals in the Senate, one of very few Democrats to vote for the Central America Free Trade Agreement. He has voted against free trade agreements with Chile, Singapore, and Oman.

Wyden supported the reimposition of tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber in 2017, saying, &quot;Canadian policies ... distort trade and hold American lumber businesses back from fully realizing their potential.&quot;

==Personal life==

Wyden&#x27;s home is in Portland, Oregon, and he has an apartment in Washington, D.C. He has two grown children, Adam and Lilly, by his first wife, Laurie (née Oseran); they divorced in 1999 after 20 years of marriage. His son Adam owns the hedge fund ADW Capital Partners LP.

Wyden married his current wife, Nancy Wyden (née Bass), daughter of an owner of New York&#x27;s Strand Bookstore, in September 2005. They have three children: twins born in 2007, and a daughter born in 2012. In 2016, they sold their 5,300-square-foot townhouse in Manhattan for $7.5 million. During Wyden&#x27;s 2010 Senate campaign, opponents questioned how much time Wyden spent in Oregon given his wife&#x27;s New York residency.

In December 2010, Wyden underwent surgery for very early-stage prostate cancer, detected during a routine screening. He recovered quickly and returned to Congress in January 2011.

<text>Scientific [[citation]] is providing detailed reference in a scientific publication, typically a paper or book, to previously published (or occasionally private) communications that have a bearing on the subject of the new publication. The purpose of citations in original work is to allow readers of the paper to refer to cited work to assist them in judging the new work, source background information vital for future development, and acknowledge the contributions of earlier workers.

To a considerable extent the quality of work, in the absence of other criteria, is judged on the number of citations received, adjusting for the volume of work on the relevant topic. While this is not necessarily a reliable measure, counting citations is trivially easy; judging the merit of complex work can be very difficult.

Previous work may be cited regarding experimental procedures, apparatus, goals, previous theoretical results upon which the new work builds, theses, and so on. Typically such citations establish the general of and the mindset of research, and especially as &quot;part of what science&quot; it is, and to help determine who conducts the peer review.

==Patent references==
In patent law, the citation of previous works, or prior art, helps establish the uniqueness of the invention being described. The focus in this practice is to claim originality for commercial purposes, and so the author is motivated to avoid citing works that cast doubt on their originality. This does not appear to be &quot;scientific&quot; citation. Inventors and lawyers have a legal obligation to cite all relevant art; not doing so risks invalidating the patent. The patent examiner is obliged to list all further prior art found in searches.

==Digital object identifier (DOI)==

== Research and development ==
Citation analysis is a method widely used in metascience:

=== Citation analysis ===

=== Citation frequency ===

Modern scientists are sometimes judged by the number of times their work is cited by others—this is actually a key indicator of the relative importance of a work in science. Accordingly, individual scientists are motivated to have their own work cited early and often and as widely as possible, but all other scientists are motivated to eliminate unnecessary citations so as not to devalue this means of judgment. A formal citation index tracks which referred and reviewed papers have referred which other such papers. Baruch Lev and other advocates of accounting reform consider the number of times a patent is cited to be a significant metric of its quality, and thus of innovation. Reviews often replace citations to primary studies.

Citation-frequency is one indicator used in scientometrics.

=== Replication crisis ===
Some studies explore citations and citation-frequencies. Researchers found that papers in leading journals with findings that can not be replicated tend to be cited more than reproducible science. Results that are published unreproducibly – or not in a replicable sufficiently transparent way – are more likely to be wrong, may slow progress and, according to an author, &quot;a simple way to check how often studies have been repeated, and whether or not the original findings are confirmed&quot; is needed. The authors also put forward possible explanations for this state of affairs.

=== Progress and citation consolidation ===

Two metascientists reported that in a growing scientific field, citations disproportionately cite already well-cited papers, possibly slowing and inhibiting canonical progress to some degree in some cases. They find that &quot;structures fostering disruptive scholarship and focusing attention on novel ideas&quot; could be important.

Other metascientists introduced the &#x27;CD index&#x27; intended to characterize &quot;how papers and patents change networks of citations in science and technology&quot; and reported that it has declined, which they interpreted as &quot;slowing rates of disruption&quot;. They proposed linking this to changes which they interpreted as &quot;contemporary discovery and invention&quot; being informed by &quot;a narrower scope of existing knowledge&quot;. The overall number of papers has risen while the total of &quot;highly disruptive&quot; papers has not. The 1998 discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe has a CD index of 0. Their results also suggest scientists and inventors &quot;may be struggling to keep up with the pace of knowledge expansion&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/s41586-022-05543-x&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IT systems ===
==== Research discovery ====

Recommendation systems sometimes also use citations to find similar studies to the one the user is currently reading or that the user may be interested in and may find useful. Better availability of integrable open citation information could be useful in addressing the &quot;overwhelming amount of scientific literature&quot;.

==== Q&amp;A agents ====
Knowledge agents may use citations to find studies that are relevant to the user&#x27;s query.

==== Wikipedia ====

There have been analyses of citations of science information on Wikipedia or of scientific citations on the site, e.g. enabling listing the most relevant or most-cited scientific journals and categories and dominant domains. Since 2015, the altmetrics platform Altmetric.com also shows citing English Wikipedia articles for a given study, later adding other language editions.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1371/journal.pone.0228713&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Wikimedia platform under development Scholia also shows &quot;Wikipedia mentions&quot; of scientific works. A study suggests a citation on Wikipedia &quot;could be considered a public parallel to scholarly citation&quot;. A scientific publication being &quot;cited in a Wikipedia article is considered an indicator of some form of impact for this publication&quot; and it may be possible to detect certain publications through changes to Wikipedia articles. Wikimedia Research&#x27;s Cite-o-Meter tool showed a league table of which academic publishers are most cited on Wikipedia as does a page by the &quot;Academic Journals WikiProject&quot;. Research indicates a large share of academic citations on the platform are paywalled and hence inaccessible to many readers. &quot;citation needed]&quot; is a tag added by Wikipedia editors to unsourced statements in articles requesting citations to be added. The phrase is reflective of the policies of verifiability and no original research on Wikipedia and has become a general Internet meme.

==== Differentiation of semantic citation contexts ====

The tool scite.ai tracks and links citations of papers as &#x27;Supporting&#x27;, &#x27;Mentioning&#x27;, or &#x27;Contrasting&#x27; the study, differentiating between these contexts of citations to some degree which may be useful for evaluation/metrics and e.g. discovering studies or statements contrasting statements within a specific study.

==== Retractions ====
The Scite Reference Check bot is an extension of scite.ai that scans new article PDFs &quot;for references to retracted papers, and posts both the citing and retracted papers on Twitter&quot; and also &quot;flags when new studies cite older ones that have issued corrections, errata, withdrawals, or expressions of concern&quot;. Studies have suggested as few as 4% of citations to retracted papers clearly recognize the retraction. Research found &quot;that authors tend to keep citing retracted papers long after they have been red flagged, although at a lower rate&quot;.

<doc id="172830" wikidata="Q185676" url="?curid=172830" title="Fado">
<text>Fado (; &quot;destiny, fate&quot;) is a music genre which can be traced to the 1820s in Lisbon, Portugal, but probably has much earlier origins. Fado historian and scholar Rui Vieira Nery states that &quot;the only reliable information on the history of fado was orally transmitted and goes back to the 1820s and 1830s at best. But even that information was frequently modified within the generational transmission process that made it reach us today.&quot;

Although the origins are difficult to trace, today fado is commonly regarded as simply a form of song which can be about anything, but must follow a certain traditional structure. In popular belief, fado is a form of music characterized by mournful tunes and lyrics, often about the sea or the life of the poor, and infused with a sense of resignation, fate and melancholy. This is loosely captured by the Portuguese word &quot;saudade&quot;, or longing, symbolizing a feeling of loss (a permanent, irreparable loss and its consequent lifelong damage). This is similar to the character of several musical genres in Portuguese ex-colonies such as morna from Cape Verde, which may be historically linked to fado in its earlier form and have retained its rhythmic heritage. This connection to the music of a historic Portuguese urban and maritime proletariat (sailors, bohemians, dock workers, prostitutes, taverna frequenters, port traders, fishwives and other working-class people) can also be found in Brazilian modinha and Indonesian kroncong, although all these music genres subsequently developed their own independent traditions.

Some famous singers of fado, of which there are many, include Alfredo Marceneiro, Amália Rodrigues, Carlos do Carmo, Mariza, António Zambujo, and Camané. On 27 November 2011, fado was added to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. It is one of two Portuguese music traditions part of the lists, the other being Cante Alentejano.

Modern fado is popular in Portugal, and has been performed by many renowned musicians.

==Etymology==

The word fado possibly comes from the Latin word &quot;fatum&quot; (&quot;fate&quot;, &quot;death&quot; or &quot;utterance&quot;). The word is linked to the music genre itself, although both meanings are approximately the same in the two languages. Nevertheless, many songs play on the double meaning, such as the Amália Rodrigues song &quot;Com que voz&quot;, which includes the lyric &quot;Com que voz chorarei meu triste fado&quot; (&quot;With what voice should I lament my sad fate/sing my sad fado?&quot;).

Perhaps shedding light on &quot;fadista&quot; are the Proto-Celtic &quot;*wātis&quot; (prophet, poet; see Proto-Celtic language), the English-Latin &quot;vates&quot; (Celtic bard, prophet, philosopher), and the Old French &quot;fatiste&quot; (poet), evolving to the Middle French &quot;fatiste&quot; (actor in a medieval mystery play).

==History==
Fado appeared during the early 19th century in Lisbon, and is believed to have its origins in the bohemian areas of the capital such as Bairro Alto, Mouraria and Alfama districts.

A totally different theory about the origin of fado was defended by Brazilian musical critic José Ramos Tinhorão, who said that fado was brought into Portugal by the hands and craft of a mixed-race Brazilian musician called Domingos Caldas Barbosa in the mid 18th century.

There are numerous theories about the origin of fado. Some trace its origins or influences to the medieval &quot;cantigas de amigo&quot; (song of a friend), others suggest some ancient Moorish influence, and yet others point to the chants of (enslaved) Africans sailing at sea. None of these are compelling. It possibly evolved and formed from various older musical genres.

Fado performers in the middle of the 19th century were mainly from the urban working-class, namely sailors, bohemians and courtesans in popular taverns, who not only sang but also danced and beat the fado. During the second half of the 19th century, the dance rhythms faded away, and the performers became merely singers (fadistas). 
The 19th century&#x27;s fadista Maria Severa, a half Cigano woman considered scandalous by some at the time, was the artist who made this genre famous.

More recently Amália Rodrigues, known as the &quot;Rainha do Fado&quot; (&quot;Queen of Fado&quot;) was most influential in popularizing fado worldwide. Fado performances today may be accompanied by a string quartet or a full orchestra.

==Musicological aspects==
Fado typically employs the Dorian mode or Ionian mode (natural major), sometimes switching between the two during a melody or verse change.
A particular stylistic trait of fado is the use of rubato, where the music pauses at the end of a phrase and the singer holds the note for dramatic effect. The music uses double time rhythm and triple time (waltz style).

==Varieties==
There are two main varieties of fado, linked respectively to the cities of Lisbon and Coimbra. 

The Lisbon style is better known, owing much to the popularity of Amália Rodrigues. It has been suggested that fado appeared on the streets of Lisbon only after 1840. Before then the sailor&#x27;s fado was sung at the bow of a boat, serving as a model for the first fados sung on land. Lisbon hosts a Fado Museum. 
===Coimbra fado===
The fado style of Coimbra is traditionally linked to the city&#x27;s university and the style of medieval serenading troubadours. It is sung exclusively by men; both the singers and musicians wear the academic outfit (traje académico): dark robe, cape and leggings. Dating to the troubadour tradition of medieval times, it is sung at night, almost in the dark, in city squares or streets. Typical venues are the steps of the Santa Cruz Monastery and the Old Cathedral of Coimbra. It is also customary to organize serenades where songs are performed before the window of a woman to be courted.

As in Lisbon, Coimbra fado is accompanied by the &quot;guitarra portuguesa&quot; and &quot;viola&quot; (a type of guitar). The Coimbra guitar has evolved into an instrument different from that of Lisbon, with its own tuning, sound colouring, and construction. Artur Paredes, a progressive and innovative singer, revolutionised the tuning of the guitar and the style with which it accompanied Coimbra fado. Artur Paredes was the father of Carlos Paredes. He followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and expanded on his work, making the Portuguese guitar an instrument known around the world.

In the 1950s, a new movement led the singers of Coimbra to adopt the ballad and folklore. They began interpreting lines of the great poets, both classical and contemporary, as a form of resistance to the Salazar dictatorship. In this movement names such as Adriano Correia de Oliveira and José Afonso (Zeca Afonso) had a leading role in popular music during the Carnation Revolution of 1974.

Some of the most famous fados of Coimbra include: &quot;Fado Hilário&quot;, &quot;Saudades de Coimbra&quot; (&quot;Do Choupal até à Lapa&quot;), &quot;Balada da Despedida&quot; (&quot;Coimbra tem mais encanto, na hora da despedida&quot; - the first phrases are often more recognizable than the song titles), &quot;O meu menino é d&#x27;oiro&quot;, and &quot;Samaritana&quot;. The &quot;judge-singer&quot; Fernando Machado Soares is an important figure, being the author of some of those famous fados.

Curiously, it is not a Coimbra fado but a popular song which is the most known title referring to this city: &quot;Coimbra é uma lição&quot;, which had success with titles such as &quot;April in Portugal&quot;.

<text>San Pablo is a village in the Orange Walk District of the nation of Belize. At the 2000 census the population was 926. The people of the village are mainly of Yucatec Maya(Maya Mestizo) Descent. Most of the villagers of San Pablo speak Spanish inside the village but they also understand English. Many of the elders continue speaking Yucatec Maya.

The village had milpas since 1886 but was permanently settled around 1915 by Maya people who came from the Caste War of Yucatán. Many before reaching San Pablo, lived a semi Nomadic life moving from one place to
another seeking new land to do milpas and the search for peace.
