<text>Sir Timothy Miles Bindon Rice (born 10 November 1944) is an English songwriter. He is best known for his collaborations with Andrew Lloyd Webber, with whom he wrote, among other shows, &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;, &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, and &quot;Evita&quot;; &quot;Chess&quot; (with Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson of ABBA); &quot;Aida&quot; (with Elton John); and, for Disney, &quot;Aladdin&quot; (with Alan Menken), &quot;The Lion King&quot; (with John), both the stage adaptation of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and the live-action film adaption (with Menken). He also wrote lyrics for the Alan Menken musical &quot;King David&quot;, and for DreamWorks Animation&#x27;s &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot; (with John).

Rice was knighted by Elizabeth II for services to music in 1994. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, is a 1999 inductee into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and is the 2023 recipient of its Johnny Mercer Award, is a Disney Legend recipient, and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors. In addition to his awards in the UK, he is one of twenty-one artists to have won an Emmy, Oscar, Grammy and Tony in the US.

Rice twice hosted the Brit Awards (in 1983 and 1984). The 2020 &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; values Rice&#x27;s wealth at £155m; the 21st-richest music millionaire in the UK.

== Early life ==
Rice was born at Shardeloes, a historic English country house near Amersham, Buckinghamshire, that was requisitioned as a maternity hospital during the Second World War. His father, Hugh Gordon Rice (1917–1988), served with the Eighth Army and reached the rank of major during the Second World War, and afterward worked for the De Havilland Aircraft Company, becoming Far East representative, and for the Diplomatic Service, including as adviser to the Ministry of Overseas Development at Amman, Jordan. Rice&#x27;s mother, Joan Odette (née Bawden; 1919–2009), daughter of an entrepreneur in the London fashion trade, served in the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) as a photographic interpreter, and in her eighties became known as a writer on the publication of her wartime diaries.

== Education ==
Rice was educated at three independent schools: Aldwickbury School in Hertfordshire, St Albans School and Lancing College. He left Lancing with GCE A-Levels in History and French and then started work as an articled clerk for a law firm in London, having decided not to apply for a university place. He later attended the Sorbonne in Paris for a year.

== Career ==

=== Music industry ===
After studying for a year in Paris at the Sorbonne, Rice joined EMI Records as a management trainee in 1966. 

In the liner notes of the 2006 CD compilation &quot;That&#x27;s my Story&quot;, (Sunbeam Catalogue No.: SBRCD5017)&quot; Rice notes that he played tambourine on Ross Hannaman&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll give all my Love to Southend&quot;), whom he briefly managed.

When EMI producer Norrie Paramor left to set up his own organization in 1968, Rice joined him as an assistant producer, working with, among others, Cliff Richard and the Scaffold.

=== Musical theatre ===
Rice became famous for his collaborations with Andrew Lloyd Webber, with whom he wrote &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;, &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, &quot;Evita&quot;, &quot;Cricket&quot;, &quot;The Likes of Us,&quot; and additional songs for the 2011 West End production of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. &quot;Joseph&quot; and &quot;Superstar&quot; were additionally known as two of the first hit musicals that drew their sound from the rock and pop music that became embedded in culture in the 1960s.

For The Walt Disney Company, Rice has collaborated individually with Alan Menken and Elton John, creating productions including &quot;Aladdin&quot; (winning an Academy Award for Best Original Song, Golden Globe and Grammy Award for Song of the Year for &quot;A Whole New World&quot; in 1992) and &quot;The Lion King&quot; (winning an Academy Award and Golden Globe for &quot;Can You Feel the Love Tonight&quot; in 1994).

In 1996, his collaboration with Lloyd Webber for the film version &quot;Evita&quot; won Rice his third Academy Award for Best Original Song with the song &quot;You Must Love Me&quot;. Rice has also collaborated with Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson of ABBA on &quot;Chess&quot; and with Rick Wakeman on the albums &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;Cost of Living&quot;. In 2009, he wrote the lyrics for Andrei Konchalovsky&#x27;s critically panned reimagining of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, set to the music of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.

Rice reunited with Andrew Lloyd Webber in 2011 to pen new songs for Lloyd Webber&#x27;s newest production of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; which opened in March 2011 at the London Palladium. Rice has since, however, rejected working with Lloyd Webber again, claiming their partnership has run its course, and they are &quot;no longer relevant as a team&quot;.

=== Media ===
On 9 November 1979, Rice hosted a highly publicised edition of &quot;Friday Night, Saturday Morning&quot; on the BBC which had a heated debate on the newly released film &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot;, a film that had been banned by many local councils and caused protests throughout the world with accusations that it was blasphemous (as the lyricist of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, Rice himself had been accused of blasphemy a decade before). To argue in favour of this accusation were veteran broadcaster and noted Christian Malcolm Muggeridge and Mervyn Stockwood (the Bishop of Southwark). In defence of the film were two members of the Monty Python team, John Cleese and Michael Palin.

Rice has also been a frequent guest panellist for many years on the radio panel games &quot;Just a Minute&quot; and &quot;Trivia Test Match&quot;. He also made an appearance in the film &quot;About a Boy&quot;. The film includes several clips from an edition of the game show &quot;Countdown&quot; on which he was the guest adjudicator. His other interests include cricket (he was president of the Marylebone Cricket Club in 2002) and maths. He wrote the foreword to the book &quot;Why Do Buses Come In Threes&quot; by Rob Eastaway and Jeremy Wyndham, and featured prominently in Tony Hawks&#x27;s &quot;One Hit Wonderland&quot;, where he co-wrote the song which gave Hawks a top twenty hit in Albania. On 2 December 2010 he addressed the eighth Bradman Oration in Adelaide. In October 2011 and November 2016 to February 2017, Rice was guest presenter for the BBC Radio 2 show &quot;Sounds of the &#x27;60s&quot;, standing in for regular presenter Brian Matthew who was unwell.

Beginning in the lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in partnership with Broadway Podcast Network, Rice has presented &quot;Get Onto My Cloud&quot;, a podcast retrospective of his career. A number of episodes feature verbatim excerpts of his autobiography and all include various recordings of his and other associated musicians&#x27; work.

=== Literature ===
He released his autobiography &quot;Oh What a Circus: The Autobiography of Tim Rice&quot; in 1998, which covered his childhood and early adult life until the opening of the original London production of &quot;Evita&quot; in 1978. He also took part in the Bush Theatre&#x27;s 2011 project &quot;Sixty Six Books&quot; for which he wrote a piece based upon a book of the King James Bible.

Rice was the president of the London Library, the largest independent lending library in Europe from 2017–2022.

=== Publishing ===
Along with his brother, Jo, and the radio presenters Mike Read and Paul Gambaccini, he was a co-founder of the &quot;Guinness Book of British Hit Singles&quot; and served as an editor from 1977 to 1996. In September 1981, Rice, along with Colin Webb and Michael Parkinson, launched Pavilion Books, a publishing house with a publishing focus on music and the arts. He held it until 1997.

=== Patronage ===
Rice is a patron of the London-based drama school, Associated Studios and was for several years, a patron of Thame Players Theatre along with Bruce Alexander.

=== Honours ===
Rice was made a Knight Bachelor by Queen Elizabeth II in 1994 (entitling him to the address &quot;Sir Tim Rice&quot; or &quot;Sir Tim&quot;), was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1999, and was named a Disney Legend in 2002.

In 2008, Rice received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

He is a fellow member of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.

== Personal life ==
On 19 August 1974, Rice married Jane Artereta, daughter of Colonel Alexander Henry McIntosh, OBE, and former wife of producer and talent agent Michael Whitehall, the couple having met while working at Capital Radio. The marriage unravelled in the late 1980s after the British tabloid newspapers revealed that he had been conducting an affair with the singer Elaine Paige. Jane retains the title Lady Rice as, despite obtaining a divorce decree nisi, the couple never made it absolute and therefore they remain legally married.

Lady Rice manages the family&#x27;s 33,000-acre Dundonnell estate which Sir Tim Rice bought in 1998 for £2 million. She has won awards for her conservation work with red squirrels. They have two children, Eva Jane Florence, a novelist and singer-songwriter, and Donald Alexander Hugh, a film director and theatre producer who also helps to run Dundonnell. Eva, who was named after Eva Perón, is the author of the novel &quot;The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets&quot;, which was a finalist for the British Book Award Best Read of the Year.

Rice has a second daughter, Zoe Joan Eleanor, from a relationship with Nell Sully, an artist. He has a third daughter, Charlotte Cordelia Violet Christina, from a relationship with Laura-Jane Foley, a writer. He has seven grandchildren.

Despite having no familial or personal ties to the club, Rice has been a fan of Sunderland AFC since his early childhood.

=== Political views ===
Rice was a supporter of the Conservative Party, but, in 2007, stated that the party were no longer interested in him and that his relationship with them had &quot;irrevocably changed.&quot; Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, both supporters of Margaret Thatcher, attended her funeral in 2013.

Rice raised funds for the Euro No campaign in 2000. In 2014, he donated £7,500 to the UK Independence Party. In May 2016, he told &quot;The Spectator&quot; that he would vote for Brexit in the following month&#x27;s referendum on the issue, saying: &quot;It would be good to spend one&#x27;s final years as part of a truly independent nation once more.&quot; He said he had voted to remain in the European Economic Community in 1975 &quot;from a standpoint of ignorance&quot;.

=== Religion ===
Describing his religion, Rice stated in a 1982 interview, &quot;Technically I&#x27;m Church of England, which is really nothing. But I don&#x27;t follow it. I wouldn&#x27;t say I was a Christian. I have nothing against it.&quot; Conversely, he also stated that he adapted the Biblical stories of Joseph and Jesus to musicals because &quot;I&#x27;d always rather take a true story over an untrue one.&quot;

=== Wealth ===
According to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; Rich List of the UK&#x27;s richest millionaires, Rice is worth £155 million as of 2020.

In 2015, Rice expressed his indebtedness to the journalist Angus McGill as &quot;the man responsible for Andrew Lloyd Webber and I having our first song recorded&quot;. Speaking at McGill&#x27;s funeral, Rice told a tale from his days at EMI about trying to rig the results of the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; Girl of the Year competition in 1967. As &quot;glorified office boy&quot;, Rice was writing songs with Lloyd Webber and desperate to find anybody to record one of their songs. Rice and colleagues filled in 5,000 entry forms overnight voting for the contestant who was a singer, and delivered them to McGill, who supervised the competition. Rice said it was &quot;a disgraceful act of dishonesty on my part... without actually breaking the rules&quot;. As a result, the &quot;Standard&quot; proclaimed two Girls of the Year and Rice&#x27;s choice, Rosalind (&quot;Ross&quot;) Hannaman, was signed to EMI, where she made her first record. Rice said at the funeral: &quot;I owe [Angus] an awful lot, which is just one of the reasons why I&#x27;m here today.&quot;

<text>BattleBots is an American robot combat television series and company. The show is an adaptation of the American Robot Wars competitions hosted in the mid–late 1990s by Marc Thorpe, in which competitors design and operate remote-controlled armed and armored machines designed to fight in an arena combat elimination tournament. The same competitions inspired the British TV program &quot;Robot Wars&quot;, which acquired the name in 1995.

Legally barred from the name &quot;Robot Wars&quot;, American robot combat aficionados created a new company, BattleBots, under the ownership of Greg Munson and Trey Roski. The first official BattleBots event was hosted at the Long Beach Pyramid in Long Beach, California in August 1999, while a second event in Las Vegas was used to pitch the competition to television networks. For five seasons, &quot;BattleBots&quot; aired on the American Comedy Central and was hosted by Bil Dwyer, Sean Salisbury, and Tim Green. Comedy Central&#x27;s first season premiered on August 23, 2000, and its fifth and last season ended on December 21, 2002. While small untelevised competitions continued to be run under the BattleBots name, the show was on hiatus until it was revived on ABC in 2015.

A six-episode revival series premiered on ABC on June 21, 2015, to generally favorable reviews and ratings. Additionally, ABC renewed &quot;BattleBots&quot; for a seventh season, which premiered on June 23, 2016. In February 2018, Discovery Channel and Science picked up the show for an eighth season, which premiered on May 11, 2018. A ninth season of &quot;BattleBots&quot; premiered on Discovery Channel on June 7, 2019, the tenth season premiered on December 3, 2020, the eleventh season on January 6, 2022, and the twelfth season on January 5, 2023.

Two spin-off competitions have debuted on Discovery+. The first spin-off, &quot;&quot;, premiered on January 4, 2021 on Discovery+. A second spin-off premiered on August 5, 2022, under the name &quot;BattleBots: Champions&quot;.

==History==

=== Early competitions ===
&quot;BattleBots&quot; is an offshoot of the original Robot Wars tournaments, the brainchild of Marc Thorpe. Robot Wars had financial backing from Sm:)e communications, a New York record company. The Thorpe partnership broke up in 1997, starting many years of legal wrangling between Thorpe and Profile Records (the former Sm:)e Communications). Profile licensed &quot;Robot Wars&quot; to a UK production company&quot;. Robot Wars&quot; ran from 1998 to 2004 as a popular television program in the UK, with a short-lived revival from 2016 to 2017.

The robot builders left behind in San Francisco formed BattleBots, Inc. and began a series of larger competitions. The first was held in Long Beach, California in August 1999 and streamed online, attracting 40,000 streams. Lenny Stucker, a television producer known for his work on telecasts of professional boxing, was in attendance and showed interest in being involved with &quot;BattleBots&quot;—believing the concept of robot combat was &quot;hip&quot; and have shown an interest in technology. Stucker made changes to the competition&#x27;s format and presentation to make it more suitable for television, including elements reminiscent of boxing (such as a red and blue corner) and shifting to a single-elimination format. The creators tried selling the competition as a television series to networks such as CBS, NBC, HBO, and Showtime, but none picked it up. A second event was held as a pay-per-view in Las Vegas in 1999, the PPV was in turn, used as a pilot to pitch the show again, with a higher rate of success.

=== Comedy Central seasons (2000–2002) ===
Among the networks interested was Comedy Central, who ultimately picked up the program. Debbie Liebling, the network&#x27;s Senior Vice President of original programming and development, felt that the concept would appeal to the network&#x27;s young adult demographic, explaining that &quot;it was really funny and really nerdy. The Internet was not a big thing yet, so the nerd culture wasn&#x27;t so celebrated. It was sports for the nerdy person, I guess.&quot; Co-creator Greg Munson viewed the deal as a double-edged sword; it gave &quot;BattleBots&quot; an outlet and a larger budget, but the network insisted on the addition of comedic aspects to &quot;BattleBots&quot; as a program, such as sketches involving contestants. However, the competition itself was not affected by this mandate; Liebling described the final product as being &quot;a parody of a sports show without being a parody&quot;. Munson lamented that the network had also ignored his suggestion for the co-host role to be filled by &quot;attractive geek girls&quot; with sufficient knowledge to speak with builders, having elected to &quot;[keep] throwing bigger and better hot babes at it&quot;, such as Carmen Electra.

Despite this, viewership and awareness of &quot;BattleBots&quot; grew progressively over time; contestants Christian Carlberg and Lisa Winter were invited to appear on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, &quot;BattleBots&quot; beat &quot;South Park&quot; as Comedy Central&#x27;s highest-rated program for a period during Season 3, competitor interest grew and licensing deals also emerged. The success of &quot;BattleBots&quot;, however, resulted in competition from other broadcasters; TLC introduced a competing program, &quot;Robotica&quot;, while other channels imported episodes of the British &quot;Robot Wars&quot; series. By 2002, the program had begun to face further difficulties; Munson felt that the bouts had become &quot;homogenized&quot; because the participants had &quot;perfected&quot; the sport of robot fighting, leading to a lack of innovation in robot designs and strategies. Furthermore, &quot;BattleBots&quot; had sued Anheuser-Busch and its advertising agency for producing and airing a commercial during Super Bowl XXXVII that parodied the program and featured a robot greatly resembling one from &quot;BattleBots&quot; (this lawsuit, however, was dismissed in 2004, after a judge ruled that the ad was a parody protected by fair use). In September 2002, Comedy Central cancelled &quot;BattleBots&quot; after its fifth season, &quot;BattleBots 5.0&quot;. Viacom acquired full control of the network in April 2003; Stucker believed that Comedy Central had become &quot;tired&quot; of the program, and Roski stated that Viacom had wanted to shift Comedy Central back towards traditional comedy programming.

Between August 21 and 26, 2009 a BattleBots-branded event was held and filmed in California. Three competitions were held: The High School Championship, Collegiate Championship and Pro Championship. Competitors included a mix of Comedy Central stars and newcomers who would return to the reboot. CBS sport originally agreed to air the Collegiate Championship before dropping out due to lack of commercial interest. A deal with Fox was later signed before also falling apart for unknown reasons. The pilot episode of the Collegiate Championship was released onto the official BattleBots YouTube Channel on the 17th of September 2010.

=== ABC/Discovery Channel revival (2015–present) ===
In December 2014, ABC announced that it had picked up a six-episode revival of &quot;BattleBots&quot;, produced by Whalerock Industries, to premiere in June 2015. Roski and Munson served as executive producers, joined by Lloyd Braun. The 2015 revival drew an average viewership of 5.4 million in its Sunday-night timeslot, with a 1.9 share in the 18-49 demographic. In November 2015, ABC announced that it had renewed the &quot;BattleBots&quot; revival for the seventh overall season of the series. The 2016 competition expanded to a 56-team field.

After ABC declined to renew the revival for a subsequent season, the series was picked up by Discovery Channel and sister network Science. In April 2018, the networks announced that a new season would premiere that year: May 11 on Discovery and May 16 on Science Channel. The announcement reported that among the returning bots would be favorites Tombstone, Minotaur, Chomp, Witch Doctor, Bronco, Bombshell, Bite Force, and Yeti. Chris Rose and Kenny Florian return to call the action, provide background information about the bots and teams, and offer commentary. Jessica Chobot served again as the sideline reporter. Faruq Tauheed returned as the ring announcer.

BattleBots returned for another season on June 5, 2019, on Discovery and Science Channel. Chris Rose and Kenny Florian returned as hosts with a new sideline reporter, Jenny Taft, interviewing all of the BattleBots competitors in the workshop. The COVID-19 pandemic delayed the tenth season premiere on Discovery, planned for May 2020. Filming finally occurred October 10–21 for the season 10 premiere on December 3, 2020. An eleventh season ran from January 6 to April 7, 2022, establishing a permanent base for production at Caesars Entertainment Studios in Las Vegas. A twelfth season—marketed as &quot;World Championship VII&quot;—ran from January 5 to May 25, 2023.

Apart from the televised competitions, BattleBots has hosted several untelevised shows in Las Vegas. In 2019 and 2022, minor tournaments were hosted in collaboration with re:MARS, a technology conference run by Amazon. The re:MARS competition on June 6, 2019 was won by Witch Doctor (out of ten competitors), while the competition on June 23, 2022 was won by HyperShock (out of eight competitors). A live show, &#x27;BattleBots: Destruct-A-Thon&#x27;, was presented four days a week from February to May 2023. &#x27;Destruct-A-Thon&#x27; exhibited unscripted fights between replicas of classic and reboot BattleBots competitors. The replica bots, or &#x27;ShowBots&#x27;, were built and driven by a production crew with guidance from the original teams who designed them. Starting May 2023, the production space was utilized for another live show, &#x27;BattleBots Proving Ground&#x27;, which involved fights between newly designed or untested bots from newcomers or unproven teams.

==Personalities==
For the first five seasons, &quot;BattleBots&quot; was hosted by Bil Dwyer, Sean Salisbury, and Tim Green. Correspondents included former &quot;Baywatch&quot; actresses Donna D&#x27;Errico, Carmen Electra, and Traci Bingham, former Playboy Playmate Heidi Mark, comedian Arj Barker and identical twins Randy and Jason Sklar. Bill Nye was the show&#x27;s &quot;technical expert&quot;. The show&#x27;s match announcer was longtime boxing ring announcer Mark Beiro.

The 2015 edition was hosted by Molly McGrath, with Chris Rose and former UFC fighting legend Kenny Florian as commentators. The battle arena announcer was Faruq Tauheed, and Alison Haislip conducted interviews on the sidelines and behind the scenes. The judges were engineer and NASA astronaut Leland Melvin, &quot;Nerdist News&quot; anchor Jessica Chobot and visual effects artist, and former competitor, Fon Davis.

For the 2016 season, Samantha Ponder was added as host, replacing Molly McGrath. The returning judges were Fon Davis, Jessica Chobot, and Leland Melvin, as well as celebrity guest judges actor Clark Gregg, &quot;MythBusters&quot; host and former Battlebots builder Adam Savage, NFL tightend Vernon Davis, and YouTube star Michael Stevens a.k.a. Vsauce.

For the 2018 season, Rose, Florian, and Tauheed all returned in their roles, with Rose and Florian taking over as the primary hosts of the show. Chobot and Haislip switched their roles, with Chobot becoming the new sideline reporter and Haislip one of the rotating judges. Other judges include former &quot;Battlebots&quot; competitors Lisa Winter, Derek Young, Grant Imahara and Mark Setrakian.

For the 2019 season, Chobot was replaced with Jenny Taft as a sideline reporter, and the judging panel was fixed to Winter, Young, and former competitor Jason Bardis instead of rotating as it had done in previous seasons.

For the 2020 season, former builder Peter Abrahamson was added as a ringside &quot;bot whisperer&quot; who provided technical details and in-depth analysis of matchups, robots, and damage.
* Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage (creators of heavyweight Blendo), and Grant Imahara (creator of middleweight Deadblow) of Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;MythBusters&quot; are former competitors. Deadblow sometimes appeared as a &quot;guest MythBuster&quot;, assisting Grant with various experiments including &quot;Driving In The Dark&quot;.
* Will Wright, the creator of &quot;SimCity&quot; and other Sim games, as well as &quot;Spore&quot;, was a long-time contestant. He competed with middleweight Chiabot in Seasons 1–5, multibot RACC along with Mike Winter in Long Beach 1999, and lightweight The Aggressive Polygon in Season 1. His daughter Cassidy competed with middleweight Misty the WonderBot in Seasons 4–5.
* Michael Loren Mauldin, founder of Lycos, entered multiple bots over the series, competing with Team Toad.
* One of the founders of &quot;BattleBots&quot;, Trey Roski, is the son of Edward Roski Jr., one of the owners of the STAPLES Center sports arena in Los Angeles.
* Jay Leno appeared with a novelty BattleBot, Chinkilla – a lift-type robot, Chinkilla did not comply with the competition rules and only competed in special exhibition matches at BattleBots events.
* Mark Setrakian, builder/creator of the fighting robots and control suits used on &quot;Robot Combat League&quot;, is known for his visually appealing robots such as Mechadon and Snake. He has also worked on control technology used for films like &quot;Men In Black&quot;, &quot;The Grinch&quot;, and &quot;Hellboy&quot;. Whilst Setrakian did not compete in the ABC revival series, he built Axis, a claw-like podium that rotated the Giant Nut on top of it while it was on display.
* Gary Coleman, in promotion with UGO.com, joined Jim Smentowski on Team Nightmare for &quot;BattleBots&quot; Season 5.
* Dan Barry, retired NASA astronaut and &quot;&quot; contestant, competed in &quot;BattleBots&quot; Season 7 with Black Ice.

==Format==
===Weight classes===
Robots at BattleBots tournaments were separated into four weight classes in seasons 1–5. The weight limits increased slightly over time. At the final tournaments, the classes were:

*Lightweight – 60 pounds (30 kilograms)
*Middleweight – 120 pounds (54 kilograms)
*Heavyweight – 220 pounds (100 kilograms)
*Superheavyweight – 340 pounds (154 kilograms)

Starting in season 6, there were no longer separate weight classes, while the weight limit for heavyweights was increased from 220 to 250 pounds.

&quot;Walking&quot; robots (stompbots) propelled by means other than wheels were initially given a 50% weight bonus. The rules changed following the victory of a heavyweight stompbot (Son of Whyachi) at BattleBots 3.0. For BattleBots 4.0 and beyond only a 20% weight bonus was given to walkers and the technical rules specified that walking mechanisms do not use cam operated walking mechanisms as they were functionally too similar to wheel operation. Since the rules change, walking robots have entered the competition, but none has achieved any success beyond preliminary rounds. As of 2020, true walkers are given a 100% weight bonus, allowing the only competing walker, Chomp, to weigh 500 pounds.

===Matches===
Matches are three minutes long. During a match, two robots do their best to destroy or disable each other using whatever means available. The match begins with a series of lights that flash from yellow to green. The original Comedy Central version used a standard Christmas tree as seen in the sport of drag racing; the ABC revival uses just one box of lights that flash yellow three times, and then flash green.

If a robot pins or grabs an opposing robot by any means, the aggressor can hold the defender for up to 30 seconds before needing to release, though they are allowed to attempt another pin/grab after releasing, thereby granting another 30 seconds. Robots that are unable to release their opponent or otherwise become entangled may cause the match to be paused, allowing BattleBots technicians to enter the BattleBox and attempt to separate them. If they are able to be separated, the match restarts with the remaining time on the clock. If unable, the match will be ended prematurely and sent to the judges.

If a robot is unable to move for ten seconds, because it is too badly damaged or it is stuck in some manner (e.g., ensnared in an arena-trap), it is declared knocked out. In the Comedy Central version, the driver could also call a &quot;tap-out&quot; to forfeit the match if his or her robot is about to be destroyed. This ends the match ten seconds later; the opposing driver is &quot;asked&quot; (but not instructed) not to attack during the ten-second count.

If both robots survive the three minutes, or if the match is prematurely halted, a panel of judges distribute a total of 33 points (11 points a judge) over three categories: Damage, Aggression, and Control. Damage is weighted more heavily with five possible points, while Aggression and Control account for three each. Judges are provided with detailed guidelines for scoring, but in general terms, Damage points are awarded for how much non-cosmetic damage is inflicted to both robots either directly by their opponent and/or by arena hazards, Aggression refers to how much each robot engaged or avoided the other, and Control points are awarded based on how skillfully the drivers either evaded their opponents&#x27; attacks or positioned their own for maximum effectiveness. The robot with the higher score wins. Starting in Season 7, competitors who disagreed with the judges&#x27; decision may file an appeal, prompting a closer look at the fight and potentially overturning the decision. If this appeal fails, that team loses the ability to challenge further rulings that season.

At the end of the tournament, a series of &#x27;rumbles&#x27; or &#x27;melee rounds&#x27; is typically held in each weight class, allowing robots that survived the main tournament to fight in a &#x27;free for all&#x27; in a 5-minute match. Occasionally, there are too many robots for one rumble, and multiple rumbles are held with the top surviving bots competing in a final event. During the Season 5 Heavyweight rumble (the first rumble of that competition), a sheared-off robot part went through the Lexan arena roof and fell (harmlessly) into the audience. Because of this, the rest of the rumbles were canceled due to safety concerns.

===Arena===
The BattleBox is a square arena designed to protect the drivers, officials, and audience from flying debris and charging bots. It was originally designed by Pete Lampertson. As of the 2015 season, Pete was still overseeing the box with the help of Matt Neubauer. It has a steel floor and steel-framed walls and roof paneled with thick, bulletproof polycarbonate plastic. The teams bring their robots in through doorways, which are sealed after all humans have exited. The drivers control their machines from outside the sealed arena.

Arena booby-traps are intended to make fights more interesting and unpredictable and to reward drivers who can avoid the traps while pushing or carrying their opponent into them.

=== Prizes ===

Besides the Giant Nut trophy awarded to the winning team of the championship tournament, there are cash prizes for all robots that compete in combat at the tournament. In the second season of the ABC revival series, the winner of the championship tournament finals was awarded a cash prize of US$. During Season 10, the prize was US$.

Additionally, the Giant Bolt trophies are awarded to teams based on their robot’s design and operation, regardless of their performance in the tournament. The awarded categories are: Most Destructive Robot, Best Design, and the Founder’s Award (which celebrates those that &quot;best represent the spirit and values&quot; of &quot;BattleBots&quot;). Following the death of longtime competitor Grant Imahara in 2020, the Best Designer award was renamed to the Grant Imahara Award for Best Design in his honor.

==Episodes==
This is counting of all seasons. It is also usual to start counting again from 1 after the reboot, so that season 6 is season 1 and so on.

== Spin-off series ==

=== &quot;BattleBots: Bounty Hunters&quot; ===

On December 3, 2020, a spin-off streaming series was announced, titled &quot;BattleBots: Bounty Hunters&quot;. The streaming series was filmed concurrently with the 2020–2021 season and aired from January 4 to March 18, 2021 on Discovery+.

&quot;BattleBots: Bounty Hunters&quot; is a six-episode series involving 48 bots in total. Each episode is themed around a &quot;bounty&quot; placed on the heads of six destructive veteran bots: Bronco, Icewave, Tombstone, Beta, Witch Doctor, and Son of Whyachi. In each episode, eight bots (including newcomers) fight through a single-elimination tournament for the chance to fight in a bounty match against the veteran bot in question. Whichever team wins the bounty match earns US$25,000.

=== &quot;BattleBots: Champions&quot; ===
On July 19, 2022, a second spin-off, titled &quot;BattleBots: Champions&quot;, was announced. The streaming series aired from August 4 to September 8, 2022 on Discovery+. &quot;BattleBots: Champions&quot; is a sequel to &quot;BattleBots: Bounty Hunters&quot;, filmed concurrently with the 2022 season.

&quot;BattleBots: Champions&quot; is a six-episode series involving 48 bots in total. In each of the first five episodes, eight bots fight through a single-elimination tournament, called the &quot;Sin City Slugfest&quot;. Each winner of the Sin City Slugfest then battles a winner of a &quot;BattleBots: Bounty Hunters&quot; bounty match. The victor progresses to the Golden Bolt tournament. The sixth episode is the Golden Bolt tournament, where the five surviving bots face off against each other and three current or former BattleBots champions (for 2022, Tombstone, End Game, and Tantrum). The overall winner of &quot;BattleBots: Champions&quot; is awarded the Golden Bolt.

From October 5 to November 9, 2023, a second season of &quot;BattleBots: Champions&quot;, titled &quot;BattleBots II: Sin City&quot; aired on Discovery Channel and streamed on MAX. The format was similar to the earlier series, eschewing the bounty match battle and replacing Tombstone with SawBlaze as an automatic Golden Bolt qualifier. It was filmed concurrently with the 2023 &quot;BattleBots&quot; World Championship VII (season 12).

Currently, End Game is the reigning champion with two consecutive wins.

<doc id="172840" wikidata="Q153008" url="?curid=172840" title="Zoltán Kodály">
<text>Zoltán Kodály (, ; , ; 16 December 1882 – 6 March 1967) was a Hungarian composer, ethnomusicologist, music pedagogue, linguist, and philosopher. He is well known internationally as the creator of the Kodály method of music education.

==Life==
Born in Kecskemét, Kingdom of Hungary, Kodály learned to play the violin as a child. In 1900, he entered the Department of Languages at the University of Budapest and at the same time Hans von Kössler&#x27;s composition class at the Royal Hungarian Academy of Music. After completing his studies, he studied in Paris with Charles-Marie Widor for a year.

In 1905 he visited remote villages to collect songs, recording them on phonograph cylinders. In 1906 he wrote a thesis on Hungarian folk song, &quot;Strophic Construction in Hungarian Folksong&quot;. At around this time Kodály met fellow composer and compatriot Béla Bartók, whom he took under his wing and introduced to some of the methods involved in folk song collecting. The two became lifelong friends and champions of each other&#x27;s music.


All these works show great originality of form and content, a blend of highly sophisticated mastery of the western European style of music, including classical, late-romantic, impressionistic and modernist traditions, and on the other hand a profound knowledge and respect for the folk music of Hungary (including the Hungarian-inhabited areas of modern-day Slovakia and Romania, as those territories were part of Hungary). Partly because of the Great War and subsequent major geopolitical changes in the region, and partly because of a naturally rather diffident temperament in youth, Kodály had no major public success until 1923. This was the year when one of his best-known pieces, &quot;Psalmus Hungaricus&quot;, was given its first performance at a concert to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the union of Buda and Pest (Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Dance Suite&quot; premiered on the same occasion.)

Kodály&#x27;s first wife was Emma Gruber (née Schlesinger, later Sándor), the dedicatee of Ernő Dohnányi&#x27;s Waltz for piano with four hands, Op. 3, and &quot;Variations and Fugue on a theme by E.G.&quot;, Op. 4 (1897). Emma died in November 1958, after 48 years of marriage.

Thirteen months later, in December 1959, Kodály married , his 19-year-old student at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music with whom he lived happily until his death in 1967 at the age of 84 in Budapest.

In 1966, Kodály toured the United States and gave a special lecture at Stanford University, where some of his music was performed in his presence.

==Kodály methodology of musical education==
Throughout his adult life, Kodály was very interested in the problems of many types of music education, and he wrote a large amount of material on teaching methods as well as composing plenty of music intended for children&#x27;s use. Beginning in 1935, along with his colleague Jenő Ádám (14 years his junior), he embarked on a long-term project to reform music teaching in Hungary&#x27;s lower and middle schools. His work resulted in the publication of several highly influential books.

The goals of the Kodály method can summarized into the following points: 

* Music is for everyone. 
* Music teaching should be sequential and begin with the child in mind. 
* Children should be taught music from an early age. 
* The sequence should be logical and follow the same process children learn language. 
* Music classes should be enjoyable and engaging. 
* Singing is the first and most valuable tool for learning musical concepts. 
* Teachers should pull from quality folk song materials in the &quot;mother tongue&quot; of the students. 

The Hungarian music education program that developed in the 1940s became the basis for the Kodály Method. Although Kodály himself did not write down a comprehensive method, he did establish a set of principles to follow in music education, and these principles were widely taken up by pedagogues (above all in Hungary, but also in many other countries) after World War II. His practices also have evolved Kodály hand signs.

In the motion picture &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, a visual learning aid distributed to members of a conference of ufologists was named the Kodály Method and referenced musical notes as hand signals.

==Legacy and memorials==

The city of Pécs commissioned a life-sized bronze statue, located in Szent István square, in his honour in 1976. The sculptor, Imre Varga, positioned the statue so that its back is to the Cathedral and it faces a former children&#x27;s playground, reflecting the central importance to Kodály of musical education for children. He is depicted as an aged man, walking among horse-chestnut trees.

At one point during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, the Workers Councils proposed to form a government with Kodály as president &quot;because of his great national and international reputation.&quot;

<text>Carmelita is a rapidly-expanding village in the Orange Walk District of the nation of Belize. According to the 2010 census, it had a population of 1,474 people. It lies along the New River. Carmelita has the country&#x27;s only toll booth at the New River bridge on the Northern Highway where the village begins. Beside the bridge lies an access point for boat tours to the Maya historic site, Lamanai.

Carmelita was the inland village featured in the documentary where John McAfee built multiple properties including a police station (which has since been converted into a house).

<doc id="172846" wikidata="Q994426" url="?curid=172846" title="Guinea Grass">
<text>Guinea Grass is a village in the Orange Walk District of the nation of Belize. It is 38 metres (127 feet) above sea level. According to the 2000 census, Guinea Grass had a population of 2,510 people; by 2010 the census figures showed a population of 3,500. The population is made up of mostly Mestizos, Creoles, and East Indians. There are a number of Mennonites, Taiwanese and other Central American immigrants living near or immediately in the village.

==Origin of Name==

There are two stories which explain the origin of the village&#x27;s name. The first is that, after the emancipation of slavery in the British Caribbean, indentured labourers from India, known as &quot;East Indians,&quot; settled in the area and began to plant and cultivate bananas for a British estate. The locals knew banana as &quot;Guineo,&quot; and from there it morphed into &quot;Guineal&quot; and the then settlement became known as &quot;Guinea Grass.&quot; The other version is that there was an Englishman an agent for the Belize Estate Company known as &quot;Chichiri&quot; Price, relative to the Rt. Hon. George Price who lived on a farm on the northern outskirts of the village and raised livestock. In order to feed the livestock he had grass imported from England and Mexico. The grass that he imported was Guinea Grass, (Megathyrsus maximus). The locals then began to call the community Guinea Grass after the imported grass scattered and spread beyond the farm and in to the community. The grass can still be seen on the outskirts of the village&#x27;s main road towards the Philip Goldson Highway.

==History==

The area presently Known as Guinea Grass village limits, Tower hill area, and the San Juan Corridor were inhabited by the Maya through a number of linked Mayan settlement known as &quot; Posito&quot; or wells because of the vast amount of wells build by the Mayas on the area especially by the San Juan Corridor and along the river bank of the New River by the Guinea Grass main road. Some wells can still be seen up to today and are used by farmers to water crops. Villagers of Guinea Grass have also spotted a tunnel made by the Mayas which runs from near the Catholic Church to a hilltop going to Ship Yard village by where the Pech family resides. As in most cases after the Europeans came to the Americas the population of the indigenous people declined and many settlements were abandoned which is exactly what happened in Posito.

Based on Oral History passed on by the older generations. The village started when a few runaway slaves from Crooked Tree and Belize River Valley and many light skinned (red skinned) who were half British and children of slave owners or daughter of English men ran away with black slaves or workers and settled by a stem of the New River not the main river which is presently Guinea Grass Village to not be found as marriage with a dark skinned person was not allowed. They settled in the community with the remaining Mayas of the area returning to the location. Later on came the Waiika and Mosquito people from the British Owned Nicaraguan Coast and a few families settled in the village along with a British farmer from the Belize Estate to cultivate the land.

Then in the 1800s after slavery was abolished in the British West Indies the British recruited indenture servants from China and India to come and work in agriculture at British Honduras. Then a British man opened a banana plantation and brought a couple of Indian labourers to cultivate and work on the plantation at Guinea Grass. After a short period of time in 1847 came the Mestizos (mixture of Spanish and Maya), the Yucatec Mayas and the Yucatecos (Spaniards born in Yucatán Mexico to Spanish Parents or grand parents from both sides) to the north of Belize escaping La Guerra de Castas (the Caste War) of Yucatán, Mexico. The settlement composed with different ethnicity and different language speakers had to find ways of communication and soon used English creole as a means to communicate with different ethnic groups.

The mestizo population soon grew and outnumber the other cultures through intermarriages and high fertility rate. Although presently the number of households is lower in the village the Mestizo population is still the largest ethnic group followed by those identifying as mixed race. The community had no law officials or form of governance so justice was taken by their own hands and many white Spanish &quot;Yucatecos&quot; were feared because of that and many altercations with the wiika population arose due to cultural and economic differences.

=== Colonial Days, WW1 AND WW2 ===

In the mid-1880s the Settlement was officially recognized by the colonial Governor of British Honduras as Guinea Grass and a representative of the crown, Mr. Price and Belize estate, the Ayuso and Disus family were relocated in the village along with a militia Edward Alamilla from Corozal and a Primary School along with a catholic church with a teacher Mr. Martinez a carib/ Garifuna from Silk Grass were established. The villagers did subsistence farming in order to have food on the table as they were only paid BZD $10- $12 per month as chicleros and log wood cutters and had to camp in the Yalbac Hills for months. The job and ways to have an income were based on a complex scheme as in order to use the lands for living and farming they had to pay taxes to the crown, in order to afford and maintain the household and be able to pay taxes they had to get a job it was a complex scheme used by the colony&#x27;s government in British Honduras as subjects were always in debt with leased land in order to be eligible to get a salary and do subsistence farming. Mr. Desiderio Perez clearly describes his time working on the forest and while at camp they received weekly rations by the coronel; 7 quarts of flour and four pounds of pork meat.

The river served as the main rout for exporting and importing thing from and to the village. The colonial area of the village was only three blocks from the river bank in size. Going through the lush forest especially at night was dangerous as wild animals such as jaguars and pumas and snakes roamed freely. 
On the northern side of the village was a banana plantation owned by an American Mr. Mason. On the southern end of the village lived the east Indians and the Waiikas who after working on the banana farm would collect cohune nuts to make cohune oil. There was a small Cohune Oil factory with an industrial machine, Mr. Florencio Garcia and Mr. Donatilo Bustillos recall that at the small plant, the East Indians crushed the kernel and extracted the oil to be sent to Belize City for exportation. The plant was later abandoned and the piles of metal ruins were removed and used by Mennonites from Shipyard in the 1960s.

After World War One tragedy struck the village, the Yellow Fever and influenza epidemic struck the north of Belize which wiped out 2/3 of the then Orange Walk District capital San Esteban and due to that the District Capital was relocated to Present day Orange Walk Town. Many people were killed by the disease and the death rate out numbered the pace of coffin making hence a big hole was dug to place in the dead. Many count the times when they were playing with their friends and then they dropped dead in the middle of the game with their ears, nose and mouth bleeding. Many women while cooking dropped dead on the floor and infants while being breast fed started bleeding and died. It was a catastrophe in the community and across Belize. This along with the devaluation of the Belize Dollar in 1949 after WWII and the scarcity of food caused by the war delaying food product shipments to British Honduras and the rest of the West Indian territories brought in economic distress and greater dependencies to self sustainment as England was going through an economic crisis. In the 1950s a new set of people came to Belize running from religious persecution the Mennonites whom after various consultations and agreements with the Governor had their first settlement approved and it was in Shipyard Village about 4–5 miles away from the village which brought employment to the people of Guineas Grass.

After Hurricane Hattie hit Belize many Belizeans were granted residency to the United States and many people from Guinea Grass migrated to the US along with many other Belizeans back in the 60s and 70s 
In the 1960s during the rebuilding of the colony Guinea Grass was finally constructed a road connecting it to the presently Philip Goldson Highway.
In the early 1980s Guinea Grass along with San Felipe, August Pine Ridge and San Lazaro got electricity thanks to the newly elected Area Representative Hon. Onesimo Pech who resided in the village at the time.

==Language==
The village is predominantly a Mestizo community. About 80% of the population are Mestizo and Hispanic Belizeans, hence Spanish followed by English are the predominant languages of the community with Spanish and &#x27;Spanglish&#x27; spoken mostly at home and English taught at the primary schools, used to access public services and when watching Television. English Creole is used for trading with locals and other Belizeans so is Spanish. 89- 92% of Guinea Grass residents can have an understandable conversation in Spanish with you but may tend to add English words along with it.72% can have an understandable conversation in English with you while 80% of the population understands English. 52% of the population understand or can speak English Creole. It is a language on the rise in the village specially among the Younger Population. Spanglish is probably the most widely spoken language in the village a combination of Spanish and English mix on a conversation.

EXAMPLE:

* &quot;Excuse me, where is the police station located?- Scuse, donde esta located el police station?&quot; 
* &quot;what was your grade on the spanish test ?- Que fue tu grade en el Spanish test?&quot; 
* &quot;what time does the bank open? I want to make a loan appointment. - Que time hace open el bank, porque quiero hacer un loan.&quot;

More than half of toddlers born from 2008 to 2018 can understand both Spanish and English before entering school.

==Profession==
The people of Guinea Grass once survived by practicing subsistence farming and working in the chicle industry as chicleros and cutting mahogany and logwood for the timber industry owned by the British Honduras Estate which changed to the Belize Estate in the early 1970s just a couple of years before Belize gained independence from the United Kingdom . Since the early 1970s, most of the people in the north, including Guinea Grass, turned to the sugar industry as a factory was opened in Libertad Village and then at Tower Hill. According to the Sugar Cane Farmers Association Act of 2000 on the Orange Walk District Divisional Association Guinea Grass falls under the following district branch: Guinea Grass, Tower Hill, Shipyard, Chan Pine Ridge, Carmelita and Tiger Creek branch.

In the late 1980s after independence, with a wave of infrastructural development carrying across Belize, many labourers from the village learnt trades in masonry, carpentry, electricity and plumbing and most of the male labour force aged 35–50 are still in those trades. Many younger people now have office jobs, work with government and even have their own businesses. Many young adults who can not afford a higher education work in the tourism and hospitality industry.

Nowadays many women also work and have a professional job, something that was rarely seen 20 years ago and many house holds are now double income household.
About 45% of all household are double income households as both men and women work.

==Climate==
Guinea Grass has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen: &quot;Am&quot;).

==Population &amp; Culture==
At the time of the 2010 census, Guinea Grass had a population of 3,500. Of these, 87.9% were Hispanic this includes the 79.9% of Mestizo and the estimated 12% of Central American immigrants and refugees residing in the village, 6% Mixed, 3.7% Creole, 1% white includes Mennonite and Caucasian,0.8% Mopan Maya, 0.3% Ketchi Maya, 0.2% Asian and 0.1% Yucatec Maya.

The village of Guinea Grass is mostly a Mestizo-dominated society, hence heavily influenced by Spanish culture and tradition. Families are mostly patriarchal and the father gives or buys a piece of lot for his children before they become independent adults, previously only Sons were eligible for this but it changed by the mid 20th century making daughters eligible as well. The Spanish language in the village has also been modified by the village&#x27;s long history and influence of the Mayan and English Creole language. The village lifestyle has also been heavily influenced by American, Jamaican and Mexican culture in the way of dressing, standard of living, music etc. The most notable Mestizo tradition can be found on the food. Most typical foods from Guinea Grass are Mestizo foods such as salbutes, tamales, escabeche, chirmole, caldo (chicken soup), Tamalitos/ Dukunu. 
The village is also heavily influenced by Caribbean and creole culture also seen through many typical cuisines such as the national dish Rice &amp; Beans, Boil up, Serre, Cow foot soup, creole bread, meat pies, Journey Cake, fry jack, Dumplings etc. We can wrap up by saying that the village has a Latin-Caribbean Mestizo culture.
The traditional Yucatec Mayan dishes are also a unique blend to the diverse cuisine of the village with notable foods like Pibil, caldo,Perix P&#x27;aak, Pibil Ka’ax and Pozole.

Some of the most festive times of year in the village are Easter in which the village council does many family activities by the river side at the New River Park, followed by the September Celebrations which starts by commemorating the Battle of St George&#x27;s Caye. Then by a beauty Queen pageant contest for Miss Guinea Grass on the 20th of September who will parade the village streets on independence day followed by a motorcade going to Orange Walk town to watch the flag raising ceremony and fireworks display. The independence day parade and celebration is on the 21st of September just after 1:00 PM. After this the villagers go to Orange Walk Town to see the Independence Carnival Parade. The biggest festivity of the year is Christmas in which from the 24th Christmas Eve families gather to make traditional foods and pastries for Christmas. Many attend church that night and on the 25th People have food, drinks and pastries to share with neighbours, family and friends. It&#x27;s a long lasting tradition of sharing in the village. The last festivity in the village is New Year&#x27;s Eve Where the traditional tamales can be found on every home on New Year&#x27;s Eve. Many churches across the village have New Years Programmes and many families host New Year&#x27;s Eve Parties.

There is a sizeable population of Guinea Grass Villagers living on the diaspora about 100–350, Mainly to the United States (California, Miami, Texas, Illinois), Mexico, United Kingdom ( East London, Edinburgh), Canada and the Anglo-Caribbean islands.

==Housing and Infrastructure==
In the 1880s houses were made in a primitive style. they were constructed from pimento stems (tasiste) in Spanish and the roof were thatched with cohune palms, some houses were also made with palm tree logs. To keep the inside homes always cool they plastered the walls with white marl. In the 1940s and the golden era of the sugar cane industry colonial styled wooden houses similar to those in Belize city started to be built by affluent families. Many can still be seen in the colonial area of the village and on the main road.
After the 1960s Hurricane concrete houses with flat top and concrete bungalow houses began to be built. Zinc or sheet metal houses are also commonly seen in resent day Guinea Grass as they are more economic to build but are not strong enough to last a category 2 hurricane.

The 1960s were the glory days of the Sugar Industry in Belize and the District of Orange Walk and Corozal had a way higher standard of living because of it. People stopped doing subsistent farming, and dedicated to the sugar industry and infrastructure. It was during that time that indoor plumbing was being introduced to communities and townships out of the capital colonial city of Belize, Belize City. People imported trucks, vehicles from Germany, the United Kingdom and the US, travelling and going on international flight was also a new thing for the villagers, by the blink of an eye the way of life of simple countryfolks changed. Although much more development is still needed in the village due to many years of a stagnant economy the village is now growing and striving once again.

==Politics==
The Village was involved in the George Price Movement on the right to vote and have a voice after the 1949 devaluation of the Belizean Dollar. As only whites and selected coloureds (who owned land) could vote or take part in Government. in 1950 when the People&#x27;s United Party was formed, the Village supported the party especially since the Rt. Hon. George Price lived in the village for a short period of time back in his tween years. They remained loyal to the Party until the late 1980s when Onesimo Pech the first person from the village decided to run for Area Representative of Orange Walk South for the United Democratic Party. Since then the village has been a strong hold for the United Democratic Party and has the biggest number of registered voters for the Orange Walk South Constituency.

The UDP has had the lead on village council election over the PUP, but in 2013 for the first time in the village history a newly formed third party won the village council elections The United Community Association of Guinea Grass (UCA) winning over the 3 consecutive reelected UDP council. On that election the PUP had no candidates to run for the village council.

The village council was previously formed by a full UDP slate with a woman being elected as the Chair-Lady for the Second time Mrs Myrna Santos. The first elected woman as Chair-Lady was Mrs Estella Perez-Santos. In 2019 after more than 20 years the PUP finally won the Village Council elections full slate with Benito Uk becoming the new appointed chairman. The PUP is a left-center party and one of the two major parties in the country.

In regards to the national elections, the village of Guinea Grass is a key village to win an elected seat in the house of representatives as the village has the biggest number of voters for the Orange Walk South constituency so winning that village indicates a high possibility for a political party to have a winning area representative in the north and a seat in parliament.

== Religion ==
89% of the Populations identifies with the Christian faith while the other 11% have no religious affiliation. The high influence of Christianity was influenced by the strong Spanish and Mestizo culture. Specially to Catholicism. 
Until the late 1950s British and American missionaries along with Belizeans of Creole descent brought to the village the Protestant Christian movement under the religious Organization Full Gospel church of God which stills stands today and is the Oldest Evangelical denomination in the village. Soon after the Seven DAY Adventist came to establish a church in the village. On the early 1970s the full gospel church split. 

A new Evangelical church and mission was established in the village called Pentecostal Church of God &quot;Rock Of Ages&quot; This was the pioneer church for the PCG World mission in Central America, Belize specifically its church in Guinea Grass is the mother Church of the PCG denomination in Central America and Parts of the English West Indies. Although P.C.G started in 1957 in Belize it was not until the late 1960s to early 1970&#x27;s that its first official church was established in Belize at Guinea Grass.Back then the country was called British Honduras and changed its name to Belize in 1973.
Just until recently the evangelic churches which are presently 7 congregations have grown to the extent that 1 out of 2 villagers is either a Roman Catholic or Evangelical Christian.

==Education==
70% have a Primary School education; of the other 30% that did not finish primary school, about 70% can read and write in both English and Spanish. The other 10% are illiterate. 45% have a secondary education, which has tripled in one decade as only ~12% of the population had a secondary education in the 1990s. 30% have a tertiary education and a hand full have graduate degrees.

As the official Language of the country is English, All Primary schools in Belize teach with a full English curriculum. Hence, the same thing applies to Guinea Grass from infant division to Upper School (Standard 5 &amp; 6) teaching is done in English but are not limited to use different languages for better illustration and understanding of the subject specially helpful for foreigners and those whose first language is not English such as Spanish or Low German.

The village has two primary schools, namely Guinea Grass Pentecostal Primary School and Guinea Grass Roman Catholic Primary School.

Over the past 13 years the Guinea Grass Pentecostal School has ranked amongst the Top 25 schools nationwide and has consecutively ranked among the top 3 schools in the District, the categories vary each year due to the number of standard six students enrolled. (Each year they are on either the 25-35 categories or the 50- above category) 
==Public Services and Recreation Centres==
The village hosts two Public schools one under the Roman Catholic and Ministry of Education Administration and one under the Pentecostal Church of God Belize and Ministry of Education Administration. There is one Private School that opened in 2023 administered by the Apostolic Church; there are no government schools in the village but all schools must teach the Ministry of Education curriculums and must use Standard Caribbean or UK English as the means of education and instruction.
The village holds a functioning Community Health clinic and a Community Police Station on the Marcus Canul Area of the village, beside it is the village&#x27;s football field.
The village has 3 parks one located in the north east part of the village which also hosts the village library and Community Centre, the other park is located by the river bank of the new river hence the name New River Park beside it is also a football/ cricket/ softball field, the third park is located in the Felix Estate area and is mostly a big empty field.

<doc id="172847" wikidata="Q451858" url="?curid=172847" title="King Tubby">
<text>Osbourne Ruddock (28 January 1941 – 6 February 1989), better known as King Tubby, was a Jamaican sound engineer who influenced the development of dub music in the 1960s and 1970s.

Tubby&#x27;s studio work, in which as a mixing engineer he achieved creative fame previously only reserved for composers and musicians, was influential across many genres of popular music. He is often cited as the inventor of the concept of the remix that later became ubiquitous in dance and electronic music production. Singer Mikey Dread stated, &quot;King Tubby truly understood sound in a scientific sense. He knew how the circuits worked and what the electrons did. That&#x27;s why he could do what he did&quot;.

==Career==
In the late 1950s, Jamaican sound systems were becoming popular in Kingston and were developing into enterprising businesses. A radio repairman, Tubby found frequent work for the sound systems, as the tropical weather of the Caribbean island (often combined with sabotage by rival sound system owners) led to malfunctions and equipment failure. Tubby owned an electrical repair shop on Drumalie Avenue, Kingston, that fixed televisions and radios. He built large amplifiers for the local sound systems. In 1961–62 he built his own radio transmitter and briefly ran a pirate radio station playing ska and rhythm and blues which he soon shut down when he heard that the police were looking for the pirate broadcasters. Tubby eventually formed his own sound system, Tubby&#x27;s Hometown Hi-Fi, in 1958. It was popular due to the high quality of his equipment, exclusive releases and Tubby&#x27;s own echo and reverb sound effects, at that point a novelty which had not been created outside of a studio setting. The sound also launched the career of U-Roy, its featured toaster.

===Remixes===
Tubby began working as a disc cutter for producer Duke Reid in 1968. Reid, one of the major figures in early Jamaican music alongside rival Clement &quot;Coxsone&quot; Dodd, ran Treasure Isle studios, one of Jamaica&#x27;s first independent production houses, and was a key producer of ska, rocksteady and eventually reggae recordings. Before the advent of dub, most Jamaican 45s featured an instrumental version of the main song on the flipside, which was called the &quot;version&quot;. When Tubby was asked to produce versions of songs for sound system MCs or toasters, he initially worked to remove the vocal tracks with the faders on Reid&#x27;s mixing desk, but soon discovered that the various instrumental tracks could be accentuated, reworked and emphasised through the settings on the mixer and early effects units. In time, Tubby began to create wholly new pieces of music by shifting the emphasis in the instrumentals, adding sounds and removing others and adding various special effects, like extreme delays, echoes, reverb and phase effects. Partly due to the popularity of these early remixes, in 1971, Tubby&#x27;s soundsystem consolidated its position as one of the most popular in Kingston and Tubby decided to open a studio of his own in Waterhouse in 1971, initially using a 4-track mixer purchased from Byron Lee&#x27;s Dynamic studio.

===Dub music production===
King Tubby&#x27;s production work in the 1970s made him one of the best-known celebrities in Jamaica, and generated interest in his production techniques from producers, sound engineers and musicians across the world. Tubby built on his knowledge of electronics to repair, adapt and design his own studio equipment, which made use of a combination of old devices and new technologies to produce a studio capable of the precise, atmospheric sounds which would become Tubby&#x27;s trademark. With a variety of effects units connected to his mixer, Tubby &quot;played&quot; the mixing desk like an instrument, bringing instruments and vocals in and out of the mix to create an entirely new genre known as dub music. By the end of 1971 he was already providing dub mixes for producers such as Glen Brown and Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry.

Using existing multitrack master tapes—his small studio in fact had no capacity to record session musicians—Tubby re-taped, or &quot;dubbed&quot;, the original after passing it through his 12-channel, custom-built MCI mixing desk, twisting the songs into unexpected configurations which highlighted the heavy rhythms of their bass and drum parts with minute snatches of vocals, horns, piano and organ. These techniques mirrored the actions of the sound system selectors (reggae disc jockeys), who had long used EQ equipment to emphasise certain aspects of particular records, but Tubby used his custom-built studio to take this technique into new areas, often transforming a hit song to the point where it was almost unrecognisable from the original version. One unique aspect of his remixes or dubs was the result of creative manipulating of the built-in high-pass filter on the MCI mixer he had bought from Dynamic Studios. The filter was a parametric EQ which was controllable by a large knob—a.k.a. the &quot;big knob&quot;—which allowed Tubby to introduce a dramatic narrowing sweep of any signal, such as the horns, until the sound disappeared into a thin squeal.

Tubby engineered/remixed songs for Jamaica&#x27;s top producers such as Lee Perry, Bunny Lee, Augustus Pablo and Vivian Jackson, that featured artists such as Johnny Clarke, Cornell Campbell, Linval Thompson, Horace Andy, Big Joe, Delroy Wilson and Jah Stitch. In 1973, he added a second 4-track mixer, and built a vocal booth at his studio so he could record vocal tracks onto the instrumental tapes brought to him by various producers. This process is known as &quot;voicing&quot; in Jamaican recording parlance. It is unlikely that a complete discography of Tubby&#x27;s production work could be created based on the number of labels, artists and producers with whom he worked, and also subsequent repressings of these releases sometimes contained contradictory information. His name is credited on hundreds of B-side labels, with the possibility that many others were by his hand yet uncredited, due to similarities with his known work. Several albums of Tubby&#x27;s dub mixes were released, among the earliest the Perry-produced &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; and Bunny Lee&#x27;s &quot;Dub from the Roots&quot; (both 1974).

His most famous dub and one of the most popular dubs of all time was &quot;King Tubby Meets Rockers Uptown&quot; from 1974. The original session was for a Jacob Miller song called &quot;Baby I Love You So&quot;, which featured Bob Marley&#x27;s drummer Carlton Barrett playing a traditional one drop rhythm. When Tubby completed the dub, which also featured Augustus Pablo on melodica, Barrett&#x27;s drums regenerated several times and created a totally new rhythm which was later tagged &quot;rockers&quot;. This seminal track later also appeared on Pablo&#x27;s 1976 album &quot;King Tubby Meets Rockers Uptown&quot;.

By the later part of the 1970s, King Tubby had mostly retired from music, still occasionally mixing dubs and tutoring a new generation of artists, including King Jammy and perhaps his greatest protege, Hopeton Brown a.k.a. Scientist. In the 1980s, he built a new, larger studio in the Waterhouse neighbourhood of Kingston with increased capabilities, and focused on the management of his labels Firehouse, Waterhouse, Kingston 11, and Taurus, which released his productions of Anthony Red Rose, Sugar Minott, Conroy Smith, King Everald and other popular musicians.

==Death==
King Tubby was shot dead on 6 February 1989, outside his home in Duhaney Park, Kingston, upon returning from a session at his Waterhouse studio. His death was believed to be the outcome of a robbery.

<text>In the Islamic study of hadith, an isnād (chain of transmitters, or literally &quot;supporting&quot;; ) refers to a list of people who passed on a tradition, from the original authority to whom the tradition is attributed to, to the present person reciting or compiling that tradition. The tradition an &quot;isnad&quot; is associated with is called the &quot;matn&quot;. Isnads are an important feature of the genre of Islamic literature known as hadith and are prioritized in the process that seeks to determine if the tradition in question is authentic or inauthentic.

According to the traditional Islamic view, the tradition of the hadith sciences has succeeded in the use of isnads to distinguish between authentic and inauthentic traditions going back to Muhammad and his companions. The contemporary view in modern hadith studies, however, is that isnads were commonly susceptible to forgery and so had to be scrutinized before being used to guarantee the transmission of a tradition.

== Pre-Islamic background ==
Chains of transmission are found in many religious texts as an oral guarantor for the preservation of tradition (by contrast, written transmission was perceived to be unreliable). These include sources from rabbinic, Christian (including Papias, Ephrem, and the Pseudo-Clementine Homilies), and Manichaean backgrounds. The practice of attributing the transmission of a tradition to a line of known tradents has been compared to the practice of apostolic succession in Christianity, a claim made on the part of Christian churches that their legitimacy in carrying on the traditions of Jesus and the disciples is based on a continuous succession of authorities, especially bishops, from the earliest moments of the Church. These methods of transmission likely arose independently.

Joseph Horowitz proposed that the Islamic version of the practice of combining a tradition or saying with a chain of transmitters going back to an original authority stems from the instance of this tradition in rabbinic literature from whence it got adopted into the nascent hadith sciences, before it underwent a much more elaborate native systematization in the Islamic tradition. According to Michael Cook:We can then go on to find elements in the Islamic edifice that look like specific borrowings from Judaism ... the chain of transmitters that accompanies an oral account, known on the Muslim side as the isnād, as in &quot;Muḥammad ibn Yūsuf informed us from Sufyān from Abū ʾl-Zinād from Mūsā ibn Abī ʿUthmān from his father from Abū Hurayra from the Prophet who said...&quot; The only other religious culture in which we find such a style of attribution is Judaism, as in “Rabbi Zeriqa said: Rabbi Ammi said: Rabbi Simeon ben Laqish said:...” What was different was that once adopted in Islam the practice was developed much more systematically and applied to a much wider range of material.One Jewish chain of transmission is reiterated in the Quran (5:44).

== Origins in Islam ==
A number of propositions have been made concerning the time that isnads began to be used in conjunction with the passing on of tradition in the Islamic world. One of the most common pieces of evidence considered in these discussions is in a statement that has been attributed to the Basran scholar Ibn Sirin (d. 110/728 AD), which states:

Lam yakūnū yas’alūna ‘an al-isnād. Fa-lammā waqa‘at al-fitna qālū: &quot;Sammū la-nā rijāla-kum fa-yunẓaru ilā ahl al-sunna fa-yu’khadhu ḥadīthu-hum wa-yunẓaru ilā ahl al-bida‘ fa-lā yu’khadhu ḥadīthu-hum.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
They were not asking about the &quot;isnād&quot;. When the &quot;fitna&quot; (civil war) broke out, they said, &quot;name to us your informants (&quot;rijāl&quot;), so that we can recognize the people of [orthodox] tradition and accept their ḥadīth, and recognize the people of [heretical] innovation and accept not their ḥadīth.&quot;

According to this tradition, the use of isnads begins with the era of the &quot;fitna&quot;. However, this term is ambiguous, and so much scholarly debate has concerned the meaning of &quot;fitna&quot; in this passage, as it could be taken as a reference to the First Fitna (656–616 AD) (the view of Muhammad Mustafa Azmi), the Second Fitna (680–692) (the view of G.H.A. Juynboll), or the Third Fitna (744–750) (the view of Joseph Schacht, only possible if the tradition has been misattributed to, and therefore post-dates, Ibn Sirin). Since Juynboll, who has observed that the earliest sources most commonly associate the use of this word in isolation with the Second Fitna, it has become increasingly accepted that the tradition in question localizes the beginnings of the use of isnads to the era of the Second Fitna. Furthermore, Juynboll&#x27;s assessment has alleviated the skepticism towards the question of whether Ibn Sirin made this claim.

Therefore, isnads emerged in the Islamic tradition in the late first Islamic century. This occurred during the beginnings of efforts to offer systematic support for collected traditions. In this early stage, however, isnads were still not systematically invoked. The pivotal figure in the emergence of traditions concerning the Prophetic biography, Urwa ibn al-Zubayr, used isnads, but not consistently. Later on, as the hadith sciences emerged and were formalized, they were documented more rigidly.

== Reliability ==
In contemporary hadith studies, isnads have been subjected to a heightened level of scrutiny, and virtually all authorities believe that isnads have been afflicted with higher levels of partial or complete forgery than had been commonly presumed. Complete forgeries would constitute a wholesale invention of an isnad, whereas partial forgery typically involves fabricating a list of early transmitters of a tradition to connect it with a figure of higher prestige, such as Muhammad himself or one of his reputable followers. One of the most skeptical instances of modern views on isnads comes from the influential writings of Joseph Schacht (d. 1969), who, in his &quot;Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence&quot; (1950), argued that isnads were sweepingly fabricated towards the end of the second Islamic century. For Schacht, isnads &quot;grew backwards&quot;, meaning that over time, the tradition was attributed to earlier and earlier authorities until they reached back to Muhammad. According to this view, as the hadith sciences developed and increasingly prioritized complete Prophetic isnads (without any missing links and going back to Muhammad) in the post-150 AH period, there was a growing incentive to modify or forge isnads to meet these criteria. Isnads recorded in this era but do not meet this criteria are therefore more likely to be real, as they had not been furnished and shaped according to the emerging editorial standards of hadith scholars (&quot;muhaddithin&quot;). This view has materialized in Schacht&#x27;s oft-quoted maxim: &quot;the more perfect the isnad, the later the tradition&quot;.

Today, isnads are thought to have entered usage three-quarters of a century after Muhammad&#x27;s death, before which hadith were transmitted haphazardly and anonymously. Once they began to be used, the names of authorities, popular figures, and sometimes even fictitious figures would be supplied. Over time, isnads would be polished to meet stricter standards. Additional concerns are raised by the substantial percentages of hadith that traditional critics are reported to have dismissed and difficulties in parsing out historical hadith from the vast pool of ahistorical ones. This perspective casts doubt on traditional methods of hadith verification, given their presupposition that the isnad of a report offers a sufficiently accurate history of its transmission to be able to verify or nullify it and the prioritization of isnads over other criteria like the presence of anachronisms in a hadith which might have an isnad that passes traditional standards of verification.

== Isnad-cum-matn analysis ==
In the 1990s, hadith historians developed a method known as &quot;isnad-cum-matn&quot; analysis (ICMA) as an alternative approach compared with traditional hadith sciences towards identifying the origins and developmental stages of hadith traditions. ICMA was invented twice independently in two publications that came out in 1996, one by Harald Motzki and the other by Schoeler. The primary advocate of ICMA in the initial stages of the development and application of the method was Motkzi; Motzki believed that the oral transmission of hadith would result in a progressive divergence of multiple versions of the same original report along different lines of transmitters. By comparing them to pinpoint shared wording, motifs and plots, the original version of a hadith that existed prior to the accrual of variants among different transmitters may be reconstructed. In addition, Motzki believed that a comparative study of the differences between reports could enable the identification of particular manipulations and other alterations. Put another way, ICMA seeks to date and trace the evolution of hadith by identifying how variation in the text or content (&quot;matn&quot;) of a hadith correlates with the variation in the listed chain of transmitters (&quot;isnād&quot;) across multiple versions of the same report.

<doc id="172851" wikidata="Q852817" url="?curid=172851" title="Radiosonde">
<text>A radiosonde is a battery-powered telemetry instrument carried into the atmosphere usually by a weather balloon that measures various atmospheric parameters and transmits them by radio to a ground receiver. Modern radiosondes measure or calculate the following variables: altitude, pressure, temperature, relative humidity, wind (both wind speed and wind direction), cosmic ray readings at high altitude and geographical position (latitude/longitude). Radiosondes measuring ozone concentration are known as ozonesondes.

Radiosondes may operate at a radio frequency of 403 MHz or 1680 MHz. A radiosonde whose position is tracked as it ascends to give wind speed and direction information is called a rawinsonde (&quot;radar wind -sonde&quot;). Most radiosondes have radar reflectors and are technically rawinsondes. A radiosonde that is dropped from an airplane and falls, rather than being carried by a balloon is called a dropsonde. Radiosondes are an essential source of meteorological data, and hundreds are launched all over the world daily.

== History ==

The first flights of aerological instruments were done in the second half of the 19th century with kites and meteographs, a recording device measuring pressure and temperature that would be recovered after the experiment. This proved difficult because the kites were linked to the ground and were very difficult to manoeuvre in gusty conditions. Furthermore, the sounding was limited to low altitudes because of the link to the ground.

Gustave Hermite and Georges Besançon, from France, were the first in 1892 to use a balloon to fly the meteograph. In 1898, Léon Teisserenc de Bort organized at the &quot;Observatoire de Météorologie Dynamique de Trappes&quot; the first regular daily use of these balloons. Data from these launches showed that the temperature lowered with height up to a certain altitude, which varied with the season, and then stabilized above this altitude. De Bort&#x27;s discovery of the tropopause and stratosphere was announced in 1902 at the French Academy of Sciences. Other researchers, like Richard Aßmann and William Henry Dines, were working at the same times with similar instruments.

In 1924, Colonel William Blaire in the U.S. Signal Corps did the first primitive experiments with weather measurements from balloon, making use of the temperature dependence of radio circuits. The first true radiosonde that sent precise encoded telemetry from weather sensors was invented in France by . Bureau coined the name &quot;radiosonde&quot; and flew the first instrument on January 7, 1929. Developed independently a year later, Pavel Molchanov flew a radiosonde on January 30, 1930. Molchanov&#x27;s design became a popular standard because of its simplicity and because it converted sensor readings to Morse code, making it easy to use without special equipment or training.

Working with a modified Molchanov sonde, Sergey Vernov was the first to use radiosondes to perform cosmic ray readings at high altitude. On April 1, 1935, he took measurements up to using a pair of Geiger counters in an anti-coincidence circuit to avoid counting secondary ray showers. This became an important technique in the field, and Vernov flew his radiosondes on land and sea over the next few years, measuring the radiation&#x27;s latitude dependence caused by the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.

In 1936, the U.S. Navy assigned the U.S. Bureau of Standards (NBS) to develop an official radiosonde for the Navy to use. The NBS gave the project to Harry Diamond, who had previously worked on radio navigation and invented a blind landing system for airplanes. The organization led by Diamond eventually (in 1992) became a part of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory. In 1937, Diamond, along with his associates Francis Dunmore and Wilbur Hinmann, Jr., created a radiosonde that employed audio-frequency subcarrier modulation with the help of a resistance-capacity relaxation oscillator. In addition, this NBS radiosonde was capable of measuring temperature and humidity at higher altitudes than conventional radiosondes at the time due to the use of electric sensors.

In 1938, Diamond developed the first ground receiver for the radiosonde, which prompted the first service use of the NBS radiosondes in the Navy. Then in 1939, Diamond and his colleagues developed a ground-based radiosonde called the “remote weather station,” which allowed them to automatically collect weather data in remote and inhospitable locations. By 1940, the NBS radiosonde system included a pressure drive, which measured temperature and humidity as functions of pressure. It also gathered data on cloud thickness and light intensity in the atmosphere. Due to this and other improvements in cost (about $25), weight (&gt; 1 kilogram), and accuracy, hundreds of thousands of NBS-style radiosondes were produced nationwide for research purposes, and the apparatus was officially adopted by the U.S. Weather Bureau.

Diamond was given the Washington Academy of Sciences Engineering Award in 1940 and the IRE Fellow Award (which was later renamed the Harry Diamond Memorial Award) in 1943 for his contributions to radio-meteorology.

The expansion of economically important government weather forecasting services during the 1930s and their increasing need for data motivated many nations to begin regular radiosonde observation programs

In 1985, as part of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Vega program, the two Venus probes, Vega 1 and Vega 2, each dropped a radiosonde into the atmosphere of Venus. The sondes were tracked for two days.

Although modern remote sensing by satellites, aircraft and ground sensors is an increasing source of atmospheric data, none of these systems can match the vertical resolution ( or less) and altitude coverage () of radiosonde observations, so they remain essential to modern meteorology.

Although hundreds of radiosondes are launched worldwide each day year-round, fatalities attributed to radiosondes are rare. The first known example was the electrocution of a lineman in the United States who was attempting to free a radiosonde from high-tension power lines in 1943. In 1970, an Antonov 24 operating Aeroflot Flight 1661 suffered a loss of control after striking a radiosonde in flight resulting in the death of all 45 people on board.

== Operation ==
A rubber or latex balloon filled with either helium or hydrogen lifts the device up through the atmosphere. The maximum altitude to which the balloon ascends is determined by the diameter and thickness of the balloon. Balloon sizes can range from . As the balloon ascends through the atmosphere, the pressure decreases, causing the balloon to expand. Eventually, the balloon will expand to the extent that its skin will break, terminating the ascent. An balloon will burst at about . After bursting, a small parachute on the radiosonde&#x27;s support line may slow its descent to Earth, while some rely on the aerodynamic drag of the shredded remains of the balloon, and the very light weight of the package itself. A typical radiosonde flight lasts 60 to 90 minutes. One radiosonde from Clark Air Base, Philippines, reached an altitude of .

The modern radiosonde communicates via radio with a computer that stores all the variables in real time. The first radiosondes were observed from the ground with a theodolite, and gave only a wind estimation by the position. With the advent of radar by the Signal Corps it was possible to track a radar target carried by the balloons with the SCR-658 radar. Modern radiosondes can use a variety of mechanisms for determining wind speed and direction, such as a radio direction finder or GPS. The weight of a radiosonde is typically .

Sometimes radiosondes are deployed by being dropped from an aircraft instead of being carried aloft by a balloon. Radiosondes deployed in this way are called dropsondes.

== Routine radiosonde launches ==
Radiosondes weather balloons have conventionally been used as means of measuring atmospheric profiles of humidity, temperature, pressure, wind speed and direction. High-quality, spatially and temporally “continuous” data from upper-air monitoring along with surface observations are critical bases for understanding weather conditions and climate trends and providing weather and climate information for the welfare of societies. Reliable and timely information underpin society’s preparedness to extreme weather conditions and to changing climate patterns.

Worldwide, there are about 1,300 radiosonde launch sites. Most countries share data with the rest of the world through international agreements. Nearly all routine radiosonde launches occur one hour before the official observation times of 0000 UTC and 1200 UTC to center the observation times during the roughly two-hour ascent. Radiosonde observations are important for weather forecasting, severe weather watches and warnings, and atmospheric research. 

The United States National Weather Service launches radiosondes twice daily from 92 stations, 69 in the conterminous United States, 13 in Alaska, nine in the Pacific, and one in Puerto Rico. It also supports the operation of 10 radiosonde sites in the Caribbean.
A list of U.S. operated land based launch sites can be found in Appendix C, U.S. Land-based Rawinsonde Stations of the Federal Meteorological Handbook #3, titled Rawinsonde and Pibal Observations, dated May 1997.

The UK launches Vaisala RS41 radiosondes
four times daily (an hour before 00, 06, 12, and 18 UTC) from 6 launch sites (south to north): Camborne, (lat,lon)=(50.218, -5.327), SW tip of England; Herstmonceux (50.89, 0.318), near SE coast; Watnall, (53.005, -1.25), central England; Castor Bay, (54.50, -6.34), near the SE corner of Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland; Albemarle, (55.02, -1.88), NE England; and Lerwick, (60.139, -1.183), Shetland, Scotland. 
== Uses of upper air observations ==
Raw upper air data is routinely processed by supercomputers running numerical models. Forecasters often view the data in a graphical format, plotted on thermodynamic diagrams such as Skew-T log-P diagrams, Tephigrams, and or Stüve diagrams, all useful for the interpretation of the atmosphere&#x27;s vertical thermodynamics profile of temperature and moisture as well as kinematics of vertical wind profile.

Radiosonde data is a crucially important component of numerical weather prediction. Because a sonde may drift several hundred kilometers during the 90- to 120-minute flight, there may be concern that this could introduce problems into the model initialization. However, this appears not to be so except perhaps locally in jet stream regions in the stratosphere. This issue may in future be solved by weather drones, which have precise control over their location and can compensate for drift.

Lamentably, in less developed parts of the globe such as Africa, which has high vulnerability to impacts of extreme weather events and climate change, there is paucity of surface- and upper-air observations. The alarming state of the issue was highlighted in 2020 by the World Meteorological Organisation which stated that &quot;the situation in Africa shows a dramatic decrease of almost 50% from 2015 to 2020 in the number of radiosonde flights, the most important type of surface-based observations. Reporting now has poorer geographical coverage&quot;. Over the last two decades, some 82% of the countries in Africa have experienced severe (57%) and moderate (25%) radiosonde data gap. This dire situation has prompted call for urgent need to fill the data gap in Africa and globally. The vast data gap in such a large part the global landmass, home to some of the most vulnerable societies, the aforementioned call has galvanised a global effort to “plug the data gap” in the decade ahead and halt a further deterioration in the observation networks.

==International regulation==

According to the International Telecommunication Union, a meteorological aids service (also: &quot;meteorological aids radiocommunication service&quot;) is – according to &quot;Article 1.50&quot; of the ITU Radio Regulations (RR) – defined as &quot;&quot;A radiocommunication service used for meteorological, including hydrological, observations and exploration.&quot;
Furthermore, according to &quot;article 1.109&quot; of the ITU RR: 
===Frequency allocation===
The allocation of radio frequencies is provided according to &quot;Article 5&quot; of the ITU Radio Regulations (edition 2012).

In order to improve harmonisation in spectrum utilisation, the majority of service-allocations stipulated in this document were incorporated in national Tables of Frequency Allocations and Utilisations which is with-in the responsibility of the appropriate national administration. The allocation might be primary, secondary, exclusive, and shared.
*primary allocation: is indicated by writing in capital letters (see example below)
*secondary allocation: is indicated by small letters
*exclusive or shared utilization: is within the responsibility of administrations 
However, military usage, in bands where there is civil usage, will be in accordance with the ITU Radio Regulations.

<text>San Estevan was the first town in the Orange Walk District of the nation of Belize but later became a village due to migration of villagers to other parts of the country during a great epidemic. According to the 2010 census, it had a population of 1,573 people. The village is approximately 6 miles northeast from Orange Walk Town.

Most villagers rely on sugar cane as a source of income to their families. As much as 90% of the villagers own a parcel of sugar cane and are very active cane farmers. The village is the number one producer of sugar cane in the entire two divisions which are Corozal and Orange Walk. San Estevan is surrounded by thousands of acres of lush cane plantations. The New River passes through the left side of the village and the river is still used for transportation of sugar through barges up to Belize City where it is sent abroad.

Sugarcane is cultivated all year long and harvested from November to June. Cane is delivered to BSI (Belize Sugar Industries) which is located in Orange Walk on the Tower Hill Area.

<text> (; meaning &quot;The Diplomatic World&quot;, and shortened as Le Diplo in French) is a French monthly newspaper founded in 1954, offering mostly analysis and opinion on international politics, culture, and current affairs. there are 33 editions (9 digital-only) in 24 languages worldwide.

Their editorial line has been described as left-wing, particularly for its consistent criticisms of neoliberalism and support of alter-globalization, starting around 1973.

The publication is 51% owned by Le Monde diplomatique SA, a subsidiary company of , from which it remains editorially independent.

==History==
===1954–1989===
 was founded in 1954 by Hubert Beuve-Méry, founder and director of , the French newspaper of record. Subtitled the &quot;organ of diplomatic circles and of large international organisations,&quot; 5,000 copies were distributed, comprising eight pages, dedicated to foreign policy and geopolitics. Its first editor-in-chief, , developed the newspaper as a scholarly reference journal. Honti attentively followed the birth of the Non-Aligned Movement, created out of the 1955 Bandung Conference, and the issues of the &quot;Third World&quot;.

Claude Julien became the newspaper&#x27;s second editor in January 1973. At this point, the circulation of had increased from 5,000 to 50,000 copies; under Julien, and with the help of Micheline Paunet, the paper&#x27;s circulation would grow to 120,000 in the next 20 years. Around this time, as &quot;Le Monde&quot; shifted its editorial line towards favoring neoliberal ideology, &quot;Le Monde Diplomatique&quot; shifted its focus toward a radical critique of Reagan policy, and criticism of imperialistic liberal policy. Without renouncing its &quot;Third-worldism&quot; position, it extended the treatment of its subjects, concentrating on international economic and monetary problems, strategic relations, the Middle-East conflict, etc. One of the contributors was Samir Frangieh, a leftist Lebanese journalist.

===1989–present===
After the November 1989 Fall of the Berlin Wall following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the 1990-1991 Gulf War, the newspaper began to criticise what it described as an &quot;American crusade&quot;.

Under his leadership, analysed the post-Cold War world, paying specific attention to &quot;ethnic&quot; conflicts that arose in this period: the wars in former Yugoslavia, the 1994 Rwandan genocide, the conflicts in the Caucasus, etc., as well as to the new information technology.

Ramonet has also published books about the media and their relationship to national societies. As noted by François Cusset, French universities have not developed an interdisciplinary approach to media studies. He says that leftist journals including have had an editorial approach that is committed to &quot;critique of dominant media&quot;, both in terms of their roles in setting agendas and in enjoying status perks. Both Ramonet and his successor, Serge Halimi, published books that critiqued the media from outside academic circles.

The newspaper established financial and editorial independence from in 1996, forming its own company. owns 51%; the Friends of Le Monde diplomatique and Günter Holzmann Association, comprising the paper&#x27;s staff, together own 49%.

In an editorial in January 1995, Ignacio Ramonet coined the term &quot;pensée unique&quot; (&quot;single thought&quot;) to describe the supremacy of the neoliberal ideology. The newspaper supported the November–December 1995 general strike in France against Prime minister Alain Juppé&#x27;s (RPR) plan to cut pensions.

Three years later, after a proposal in a 1997 editorial by Ramonet, took a founding role in the creation of ATTAC, an alter-globalisation NGO. It was founded to advocate the Tobin tax, and chapters have been started throughout the world. It now supports a variety of left-wing causes. The newspaper also took an important role in the organisation of the 2001 Porto Alegre World Social Forum.

Ramonet devoted considerable space to reporting on Hugo Chávez, with whom he was said to have developed a close relationship, and his Bolivarian Revolution.

Ramonet was succeeded by Serge Halimi who had a PhD in political science from the University of California Berkeley. In 2018, LMD published a total of 37 print and online editions, in a total of 20 languages.

The August 2017 issue of the monthly was not marketed in Algeria. According to sources close to the distributor, the newspaper did not get permission to do so. Algerian authorities did not explain. The heads of the newspaper claim that it was &quot;banned&quot; from sale in the country because of a report by journalist Pierre Daum. He is best known for writing a book about the &quot;Harkis&quot; who stayed in Algeria after Independence, and about the difficult social and economic situation of some young Algerians.

==&quot;Le Monde diplomatique&quot; SA==
André Fontaine, the director of , signed a 1989 convention with Claude Julien which guaranteed the monthly&#x27;s autonomy. But it gained complete statutory, economic and financial independence in 1996 with the creation of &quot;Le Monde diplomatique SA&quot;. With a donation from , a German antifascist exiled before World War II to Bolivia, the monthly&#x27;s employees acquired approximately one-quarter of the capital, while &quot;Les Amis du Monde diplomatique&quot;, a 1901 Law association of readers, bought another quarter.

Thus, since the end of 2000, the newspaper&#x27;s employees and readers retain 49% of &quot;Le Monde diplomatique SA&quot; capital, largely above the control stock necessary to control the direction and editorial line of the &quot;Monde diplo&quot;. The remaining 51% is owned by .

==Controversies==
===Criticism===
Jean-Marie Colombani, former editor of the daily , was attributed by s former director general Bernard Cassen as saying: &quot; is a journal of opinion; is a journal of opinions.&quot;

===9/11 conspiracy theories===
The Norwegian version of the July 2006 sparked interest when the editors ran, on their own initiative, a three-page main story on the September 11, 2001 attacks and summarised the various types of 9/11 conspiracy theories (which were not specifically endorsed by the newspaper, only reviewed).

In December 2006, the French version published an article by Alexander Cockburn, co-editor of &quot;CounterPunch&quot;, which strongly criticised the endorsement of conspiracy theories by the US left-wing, alleging that it was a sign of &quot;theoretical emptiness.&quot; The Norwegian , did again however mark its difference from the mother edition by allowing David Ray Griffin&#x27;s response to Cockburn to be published in their March 2007 issue.

===Advertising===
Although publishes few advertisements in order to retain its editorial independence, it has sometimes been criticised for the quantity and nature of the published advertisements In November and December 2003, two-page advertisements by IBM and a car manufacturer were placed. The issues of February and March 2004 contained advertisements by Microsoft in a &quot;social&quot; atmosphere with a picture of children, which led to agitation.

== Communication ==
On February 2, 1995, the newspaper became the first in France to have a presence on the internet.

Some substantial artificial mounds at Louisville are the remains of an ancient city of the Maya civilization. The site seems to have been occupied from about 400 BC to about 950 AD. Excavations, made here by Dr. Thomas Gann in the mid-1930s, uncovered polychrome stucco portrait heads.

Much of the ancient remains were demolished to reuse stone and make fill for roads. Further investigations and excavations of Louisville were made in 2000.</text><links>

<text>War (originally called Eric Burdon and War) is an American R&amp;B and progressive soul band from Long Beach, California, formed in 1969. 

The band is known for several hit songs in the 1970s (including &quot;Spill the Wine&quot;, &quot;The World Is a Ghetto&quot;, &quot;The Cisco Kid&quot;, &quot;Why Can&#x27;t We Be Friends?&quot;, &quot;Low Rider&quot;, and &quot;Summer&quot;). A musical crossover band, War became known for its eclectic blend of funk, soul, jazz, and rock, an amalgam of the different sounds and styles the band members heard living in the racially diverse ghettos of Los Angeles.

Their album &quot;The World Is a Ghetto&quot; was &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s best-selling album of 1973. The band transcended racial and cultural barriers with a multi-ethnic lineup. War was subject to many lineup changes over the course of its existence, leaving member Leroy &quot;Lonnie&quot; Jordan as the only original member in the current lineup; four other members created a new group called the Lowrider Band.

===1960s: Beginnings===
In 1962, Howard E. Scott and Harold Brown formed a group called the Creators in Long Beach, California. Within a few years, they had added Charles Miller, Morris &quot;B. B.&quot; Dickerson, and Lonnie Jordan to the lineup. Lee Oskar and Papa Dee Allen later joined as well. They all shared a love of diverse styles of music, which they had absorbed living in the racially mixed Los Angeles ghettos. The Creators recorded several singles on Dore Records while working with Tjay Contrelli, a saxophonist from the band Love. In 1968, the Creators became Nightshift (named because Brown worked nights at a steel yard) and started performing with Melvyn “Deacon” Jones from Richmond Indiana, a rhythm and blues artist. Deacon Jones, as he was referred to, is often confused with Deacon Jones, the American football player who was from the same era. The band then changed their name from Nightshift to War.

Nightshift was conceived by record producer Jerry Goldstein (&quot;My Boyfriend&#x27;s Back&quot;, &quot;Hang on Sloopy&quot;, &quot;I Want Candy&quot;) and singer Eric Burdon (ex-lead singer of the British band the Animals). In 1969, Goldstein saw musicians who would eventually become War playing at the Rag Doll in North Hollywood, backing Deacon Jones, the blues artist, and he was attracted to the band&#x27;s sound. Jordan claimed that the band&#x27;s goal was to spread a message of brotherhood and harmony, using instruments and voices to speak out against racism, hunger, gangs, crimes, and turf wars, and promote hope and the spirit of brotherhood. Eric Burdon and War began playing live shows to audiences throughout Southern California before entering into the studio to record their debut album &quot;Eric Burdon Declares &quot;War&quot;&quot;. The album&#x27;s best known track, &quot;Spill the Wine&quot;, was a hit and launched the band&#x27;s career.

===1970s: Height of popularity===
Eric Burdon and War toured extensively across Europe and the United States. The subtitle of a 1970 review in the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; of their first UK gig in London&#x27;s Hyde Park read: &quot;Burdon and War: Best Live Band We&#x27;ve Ever Seen&quot;. Their show at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Club in London on September 16, 1970, is historically notable for being the last public performance for Jimi Hendrix, who joined them onstage for the last 35 minutes of Burdon and War&#x27;s second set; a day later he was dead. A second Eric Burdon and War album, a two-disc set titled &quot;The Black-Man&#x27;s Burdon&quot; was released in 1970. During the subsequent tour, Burdon collapsed on the stage during a concert, caused by an asthma attack, and the band continued the tour without him before Burdon left the band in the middle of its European tour. They finished the tour without him and returned to record their first album as War.

&quot;War&quot; (1971) met with only modest success, but later that year, the band released &quot;All Day Music&quot; which included the singles &quot;All Day Music&quot; and &quot;Slippin&#x27; into Darkness&quot;. The latter single sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in June 1972. In 1972, they released &quot;The World Is a Ghetto&quot; which was even more successful. Its second single, &quot;The Cisco Kid&quot;, shipped gold, and the album attained the number one spot on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Album of the Year as the best-selling album of 1973.

&quot;Deliver the Word&quot; (1973), the next album, contained the hits &quot;Gypsy Man&quot; and a studio version of &quot;Me and Baby Brother&quot; (previously issued as a live recording), which peaked at No. 8 and #15 on the Billboard chart. The album went on to sell nearly 2 million copies. The album &quot;Why Can&#x27;t We Be Friends?&quot; was released in 1975. It included &quot;Low Rider&quot; and the title track, which were among the band&#x27;s bigger hits.

In 1976, War released a greatest hits record that contained one new song &quot;Summer&quot;, which, as a single, went gold and peaked at number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. Also released that year were &quot;Love Is All Around&quot; by Eric Burdon and War, containing mostly unreleased recordings from 1969 and 1970, and &quot;Platinum Jazz&quot;, a one-off album for jazz label Blue Note. The latter double album had cover art to match the greatest hits album, and was half new material and half compilation, focusing on (but not restricted to) instrumental music. The group continued to attain success with their next album &quot;Galaxy&quot; (1977), and its title single was inspired by &quot;Star Wars&quot;. War&#x27;s next project was a soundtrack album for the movie &quot;Youngblood&quot; in 1978.

===1980s: The Music Band===
In 1979, following the departure of B. B. Dickerson during recording sessions for their next album (replaced by Luther Rabb on bass who completed the album), the band considered changing their name to The Music Band, but decided at the last minute to continue as War, and use &quot;The Music Band&quot; as the title of a series of albums. The series originally consisted of two studio albums (&quot;The Music Band&quot;, &quot;The Music Band 2&quot;, both in 1979) and a live album (&quot;The Music Band Live&quot;, 1980), but after the band left MCA in 1981 and had already made records for other labels, MCA expanded the series with a compilation (&quot;The Best of the Music Band&quot;, 1982) and a third original album of left-over material (&quot;The Music Band – Jazz&quot;, 1983).

The group lost another member when Charles Miller (saxophone) was murdered in 1980. He had already been replaced by Pat Rizzo (ex Sly and the Family Stone) in 1979. Other new members joining at this time were Alice Tweed Smith (credited as &quot;Tweed Smith&quot; and &quot;Alice Tweed Smyth&quot; on various albums) on percussion and vocals (giving the band its first female vocalist), and Ronnie Hammon as a third drummer.

After making the one-off single &quot;Cinco de Mayo&quot; for LAX Records in 1981 (Jerry Goldstein&#x27;s own label, which also reissued &quot;Eric Burdon Declares &quot;War&quot;&quot; under the title &quot;Spill the Wine&quot; the same year), War signed with RCA Victor Records and recorded &quot;Outlaw&quot; (1982) which included the single plus additional singles &quot;You Got the Power&quot;, &quot;Outlaw&quot;, and &quot;Just Because&quot;. It was followed by &quot;Life (is So Strange)&quot; (1983) from which the title track was also a single. War&#x27;s records from 1979 to 1983 were not as successful as those from the preceding decade, and after the two RCA albums, the band&#x27;s activities became sporadic. They did not record another full album until a decade later. The 1987 compilation album &quot;The Best of War ...and More&quot; included two new tracks, &quot;Livin&#x27; in the Red&quot; and &quot;Whose Cadillac Is That?&quot;, and a remixed version of &quot;Low Rider&quot; (in addition to the original version). Papa Dee Allen died of a brain aneurysm which struck him onstage in 1988.

===1990s: Reformations===

Sampling of War by hip hop artists was prevalent enough to merit the compilation album &quot;Rap Declares War&quot; in 1992, which was sanctioned by the band.
In 1993, War reformed with most surviving previous members (including original members Brown, Jordan, Oskar, and Scott, and later members Hammon and Rizzo), augmented by a large lineup of supporting musicians and still under the management and production of Jerry Goldstein, and released a new album, &quot;☮&quot; in 1994.

In 1996, the group attempted to gain independence from Goldstein, but were unable to do so under the name &quot;War&quot; which remains a trademark owned by Goldstein and Far Out Productions. In response, Brown, Oskar, Scott, and a returning B. B. Dickerson (who had not worked with War since 1979) adopted a name which referenced one of War&#x27;s biggest hits: Lowrider Band. They have yet to record a studio album.

Lonnie Jordan opted to remain with Goldstein and create a new version of War with himself as the only original member. Some other musicians who had joined between 1983 and 1993 were also part of the new lineup. Both the &quot;new&quot; War and the Lowrider Band are currently active as live performance acts.

1996 also saw the release of a double CD compilation, &quot;Anthology (1970–1994)&quot;, later updated in 2003 with a few track substitutions, as &quot;The Very Best of War&quot;. Another CD compilation from 1999, &quot;Grooves and Messages&quot;, included a second disc of remixes done by various producers.

===21st century===

On April 21, 2008, Eric Burdon performed &quot;Spill the Wine&quot; with War in concert at the London Royal Albert Hall, released as &quot;Greatest Hits Live&quot; on Avenue / Rhino Records, who also reissued much of War&#x27;s back catalog that year.

War were unsuccessfully nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2009 and 2014.

In 2014, War released a new studio album, &quot;Evolutionary&quot; as a double CD, the second disc being a reissue of their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album from 1976.

==Musical style==
According to music writer Colin Larkin, their &quot;potent fusion of funk, R&amp;B, rock and Latin styles produced a progressive soul sound&quot;, while Martin C. Strong calls them &quot;one of the fiercest progressive soul combos of the &#x27;70s&quot;. The liner notes to the 2003 greatest hits album &quot;The Very Best of War&quot; described the band&#x27;s sound as a mix of &quot;rock, jazz, Latin, and R&amp;B&quot;, while The Maui News described the band&#x27;s sound in an October 2024 article as blending &quot;R&amp;B, rock, Latin music, jazz, and blues.&quot; 

The band has been described as: progressive soul, funk rock, black rock, jazz-rock, Latin rock and Latin jazz.

<text>Starland Vocal Band was an American pop band, known for &quot;Afternoon Delight&quot;, one of the biggest-selling singles of 1976.

==Career==
The group began as Fat City, a husband/wife duo of Bill Danoff and Taffy Nivert.

Danoff and Nivert co-wrote the song &quot;I Guess He&#x27;d Rather Be in Colorado&quot; and then, with John Denver, &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot;, which became a hit single in 1971 and became an official song of West Virginia in 2014. The duo recorded two albums as Fat City (&quot;Reincarnation&quot;, &quot;Welcome to Fat City&quot;), and two more as Bill &amp; Taffy (&quot;Pass It On&quot;, &quot;Aces&quot;), all released from 1969 to 1974.

In the mid-1970s, Starland Vocal Band was formed and subsequently signed to Denver&#x27;s label Windsong Records. Starland Vocal Band also included Jon Carroll (keyboards, guitar, vocals) and Margot Chapman (vocals). Carroll and Chapman also became a couple, marrying in 1978.

The group&#x27;s debut album was the self-titled &quot;Starland Vocal Band&quot; and included &quot;Afternoon Delight&quot;. The song was a US number one hit and the album also charted. They were nominated for four Grammy Awards in 1977 and won two: Best Arrangement for Voices and Best New Artist, the latter award over the group Boston. The song also reached number 18 on the UK Singles Chart. The follow-up album, &quot;Rear View Mirror&quot;, did not fare as well, with 13 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and a peak of number 104.

The band hosted a variety show, &quot;The Starland Vocal Band Show&quot;, that ran on CBS for six weeks in the summer of 1977. David Letterman was a writer and regular on the show, which also featured Mark Russell, Jeff Altman, and Proctor and Bergman. April Kelly was a writer for the series.

Unable to match their previous success, the band broke up in 1981. Carroll and Chapman divorced later that year followed by Danoff and Nivert in 1982. All four members went on to pursue solo careers. They have remained on friendly terms, and in 1998 the group reunited for a few concerts, often featuring the children of the four original members as additional vocalists. In 2007, they appeared on a 1970s special on the New Jersey Network (NJN), singing &quot;Afternoon Delight&quot;.

In 2010, &quot;Billboard&quot; named &quot;Afternoon Delight&quot; the 20th sexiest song of all time. Due to its success, the song was featured in such films as &quot;PCU&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, and used in episodes of numerous TV shows, including &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;South Park&quot;. In 2011, it was performed in the musical television series &quot;Glee&quot;.

A CD compilation album, &quot;Afternoon Delight: The Best of the Starland Vocal Band&quot;, was released in 1995 by K-tel. Also in 1995, Collectables released &quot;Afternoon Delight: A Golden Classics Edition&quot; which included all tracks from the first two albums.

<doc id="172867" wikidata="Q5683715" url="?curid=172867" title="Xaibe">
<text>Xaibe () is a small rural settlement in the country of Belize mainly consisting of people from the Yucatec Maya ethnicity. It is located in Corozal District. The name Xaibe literally means &#x27;crossroads&#x27;. The people of the Maya civilization often traversed across the village to reach other Maya villages. The population of the village is very small. The last available data of the population of Xaibe in 2010 revealed that it had a modest population of approximately 1,575 people. There is, however, evidence of the fact that the people belonging to the Maya civilization resided in the Xaibe village. These people then gradually shifted to Mexico, just across the border at the time of the Caste War of Yucatán. The village is known for celebrating the Maya tradition Hanal Pixan which means &quot;food for the souls&quot; also known as Day of the Dead.

==Demographics==
At the time of the 2010 census, Xaibe had a population of 1,575. Of these, 96.2% were Mestizo, 1.5% Mixed, 0.6% Creole, 0.5% Mennonite, 0.3% Caucasian, 0.3% East Indian, 0.3% Ketchi Maya, 0.1% Asian, 0.1% Mopan Maya, 0.1% Yucatec Maya and 0.1% others. 

In terms of languages spoken (multiple answers allowed), 98.4% spoke Spanish, 59.7% English, 7.9% Creole, 4.4% Yucatec Maya, 0.2% German, 0.2% Ketchi Maya, 0.2% Mopan Maya, 0.1% Mandarin or Cantonese and 0.1% other languages; 0.1% could not speak.

==Disasters==

Because of its location on the Caribbean coastline, it is vulnerable to tropical cyclones; Hurricane Janet and Hurricane Dean, both Category 5 storms, made landfall near Xaibe village in 1955 and 2007 respectively. The village was badly damaged by Hurricane Janet in 1955 and was substantially rebuilt.

==Access==

The nearest airports to the region include the San Pedro International Airport which is only 3 mi (4.82 km) away, the Philip S. W. Goldson International Airport being 60 mi (96.5 km) far and the Chetumal International Airport located 10 mi(16.09 km) away at neighboring country Mexico. The cities and towns close to Xaibe are Xcanluum, Patchakan, Chan Chen, Carolina, Calcutta, San Antonio, Ranchito and San Andres. Xaibe is also located only 2.5 mi (4 km) from the District&#x27;s Capital, Corozal Town located at the Corozal bay.

==Education==

There is only one school located within the village limits: Xaibe Roman Catholic School (Xaibe R.C. School). The school has three main divisions: Infant Division, Middle Division, and Upper Division. Infant Division is divided into Infant I, Infant II, and Standard I, where kids from five to seven years old attend. Middle Division comprises Standard II and Standard III. Students from eight to ten years old attend. Upper Division comprises Standard IV, Standard V, and Standard VI, which are for students from eleven to thirteen years of age. At this last level students start to prepare for their Primary School Examination (PSE) for primary school graduation.

==Politics==

The village as a whole has repeatedly voted the UDP village council, headed by Luciano Noh, for over 6 years and community affairs have – according to nearly all residents – worked well under the current council. However, as is the case throughout Belize, finances are getting tighter and employment opportunities scarcer, and villagers from Xaibe are not immune to ‘feeling the pinch’. Shop-keepers complain of heightened competition between vendors, a situation made worse by the overall decreasing demand for goods as more villagers are forced to rely on contraband Mexican goods solely to be able to provide for themselves and their families as inflation continues to afflict rural communities throughout our country.

==Economy==

The majority of villagers made their wealth during the climax of the sugar cane industry, and villagers are grateful to the past economy for having provided houses and land which, in today&#x27;s tight times, would be impossible to acquire. However, the labour force of Xaibe today has forcibly become more fluid, adjusting to new industries and job vacancies that will at least provide a bare minimum salary, such as at the nearby Fruta Bomba papaya farm, and in the retail and service industry in the Free Zone and border Casinos. For those who have not been able to secure employment locally, many have left the village to join more promising tourist industries in the Cayes and elsewhere in the country, although the current economic crisis is warranting many of these to suffer un- (or under-) employment too.

== Climate ==
The climate in Xaibe is subtropical, similar to that in central or south Florida. In winter, temperatures may drop to the high 50s F at night, but there&#x27;s never a frost. In spring and summer, the thermometer may hit the low 90s at midday and drop only to the 70s at night.

<text>Little Belize is a colony of conservative Plautdietsch-speaking &quot;Russian&quot; Mennonites, known as &quot;Old Colony Mennonites&quot;, in the Corozal District of Belize. It is part of the Corozal South East constituency. Little Belize is located east of Progresso at an elevation of 1 meter above sea level. Because the Mennonite colony is close to Progresso, it is sometimes called &quot;Progresso&quot;.

According to the 2000 census, the population of Little Belize was 2,059 people. In 2010 the population had grown to 2,650 people in 427 households. Of these, 98.8% were Mennonite, 0.8% Mestizo, 0.2% Mixed, 0.1% Yucatec Maya and 0.1% Ketchi Maya.

In terms of languages spoken (multiple answers allowed), 98.3% spoke German, 19.5% Spanish, 4.5% English and 0.2% Garifuna; 0.3% could not speak.

In 2017 population has reached 2,830 people. Little Belize is the second most populous Mennonite settlement in the country, after Shipyard.

<doc id="172875" wikidata="Q187930" url="?curid=172875" title="Bayard Rustin">
<text>Bayard Rustin ( ; March 17, 1912 – August 24, 1987) was an American political activist, a prominent leader in social movements for civil rights, socialism, nonviolence, and gay rights. Rustin was the principal organizer of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963.

Rustin worked in 1941 with A. Philip Randolph on the March on Washington Movement to press for an end to racial discrimination in the military and defense employment. Rustin later organized Freedom Rides, and helped to organize the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to strengthen Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s leadership; he taught King about non-violence. Rustin worked alongside Ella Baker, a co-director of the Crusade for Citizenship, in 1954; and before the Montgomery bus boycott, he helped organize a group called &quot;In Friendship&quot; to provide material and legal assistance to people threatened with eviction from their tenant farms and homes. Rustin became the head of the AFL–CIO&#x27;s A. Philip Randolph Institute, which promoted the integration of formerly all-white unions and promoted the unionization of African Americans. During the 1970s and 1980s, Rustin served on many humanitarian missions, such as aiding refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia. 

Rustin was a gay man and, due to criticism over his sexuality, usually advised other civil rights leaders from behind the scenes. During the 1980s, he became a public advocate on behalf of gay causes, speaking at events as an activist and supporter of human rights.

Later in life, while still devoted to securing workers&#x27; rights, Rustin joined other union leaders in aligning with ideological neoconservatism, earning posthumous praise from President Ronald Reagan. On November 20, 2013, President Barack Obama posthumously awarded Rustin the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

==Early life and education==
Rustin was born in 1912 in West Chester, Pennsylvania, to Florence Rustin and Archie Hopkins, but raised by his maternal grandparents, Julia (Davis) and Janifer Rustin, as the ninth of their twelve children; growing up he believed his biological mother was his older sister. His grandparents were relatively wealthy local caterers who raised Rustin in a large house. Julia Rustin was a Quaker, although she attended her husband&#x27;s African Methodist Episcopal Church. She was also a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). NAACP leaders such as W. E. B. Du Bois and James Weldon Johnson were frequent guests in the Rustin home. With these influences in his early life, in his youth Rustin campaigned against racially discriminatory Jim Crow laws.

One of the first documented realizations Rustin had of his sexuality was when he mentioned to his grandmother that he preferred to spend time with males rather than females. She responded, &quot;I suppose that&#x27;s what you need to do&quot;.

In 1932, Rustin entered Wilberforce College, a historically black college in Ohio operated by the AME Church. Rustin was active in a number of campus organizations, including the Omega Psi Phi fraternity. He was expelled from Wilberforce in 1936 after organizing a strike, and later attended Cheyney State Teachers College (now Cheyney University of Pennsylvania). Cheyney honored Rustin with a posthumous Doctor of Humane Letters degree at its 2013 commencement.

After completing an activist training program conducted by the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), Rustin moved to Harlem in 1937 and began studying at City College of New York. There he became involved in efforts to defend and free the Scottsboro Boys, nine young black men in Alabama who were accused of raping two white women. He joined the Young Communist League in 1936, and left in 1941 after the Communist Party USA reversed its anti-war policy in response to Nazi Germany&#x27;s invasion of the USSR. This conflicted with Rustin&#x27;s anti-war stance. Soon after arriving in New York City, he became a member of Fifteenth Street Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers).

Rustin was an accomplished tenor vocalist, an asset that earned him admission to both Wilberforce University and Cheyney State Teachers College with music scholarships. In 1939, he was in the chorus of the short-lived Broadway musical &quot;John Henry&quot; that starred Paul Robeson. Blues singer Josh White was also a cast member and later invited Rustin to join his gospel and vocal harmony group Josh White and the Carolinians, with whom he made several recordings. With this opportunity, Rustin became a regular performer at the Café Society nightclub in Greenwich Village, widening his social and intellectual contacts. A few albums on Fellowship Records featuring his singing, such as &quot;Bayard Rustin Sings a Program of Spirituals&quot;, were produced from the 1950s through the 1970s.

==Evolving affiliations==
At the direction of the Soviet Union, the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) and its members, including Rustin at that time, were active in the 1930s in supporting civil rights for African Americans. The CPUSA, at the time following Stalin&#x27;s &quot;theory of nationalism&quot;, favored the creation of a separate nation for African Americans to be located in the American Southeast where the greatest proportion of the black population was concentrated.

In 1941, after Germany invaded the Soviet Union, Communist International ordered the CPUSA to abandon civil rights work and focus on supporting U.S. entry into World War II. Disillusioned, Rustin began working with members of the Socialist Party of Norman Thomas, particularly A. Philip Randolph, the head of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.

Another of Rustin&#x27;s socialist mentors was the pacifist A. J. Muste, leader of the Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR). FOR hired Rustin as a race relations secretary in the late summer of 1941. He considered Rustin to be a fine young man of oratorical ability and intelligence who would sacrifice himself repeatedly for a good cause.  Muste, Randolph and Rustin proposed a march on Washington, D.C., in 1941 to protest racial segregation in the armed forces and widespread discrimination in employment. Meeting with President Roosevelt in the Oval Office, Randolph respectfully and politely but firmly told President Roosevelt that African Americans would march in the capital unless desegregation occurred. To prove their good faith, the organizers canceled the planned march after Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 (the Fair Employment Act), which banned discrimination in defense industries and federal agencies.

Rustin had an &quot;infinite capacity for compassion,&quot; according to Daniel Levinson. Having an interest in social change from a young age, he would work with the Democratic Party and be influenced by their ideals. However, this changes later in his life when he begins to align with conservative views. In 1944, while imprisoned in North Carolina, Rustin displayed nonviolent tactics. He would allow himself to get beaten repeatedly by a white inmate until he gave up, as Rustin was unnerved. Rustin defied segregation during that time and practiced his tactic while incarcerated.

Randolph&#x27;s decision as leader of the organizers to cancel the march was made against Rustin&#x27;s advice. The armed forces, in which Black troops typically had white commanding officers, remained racially segregated until 1948, when President Harry S. Truman issued an Executive Order. (The various branches took years to abide by that order, with the U.S. Marine Corps in 1960 being the last to desegregate.)

Randolph felt that FOR had succeeded in their goal and wanted to dissolve the committee. Again, Rustin disagreed with him and voiced his differing opinion in a national press conference, which he later said he regretted.

Rustin traveled to California to help protect the property of the more than 120,000 Japanese-Americans (most of whom were U.S.-born citizens) who had been imprisoned in internment camps. In the 6-3 Korematsu Decision, the Supreme Court upheld the forcible internment. Impressed with Rustin&#x27;s organizational skills, A. J. Muste appointed him as FOR&#x27;s secretary for student and general affairs.

Rustin was also a pioneer in the movement to desegregate interstate bus travel. In 1942, he boarded a bus in Louisville, bound for Nashville, and sat in the second row. A number of drivers asked him to move to the back, according to Southern practice of Jim Crow, but Rustin refused. The bus was stopped by police 13 miles north of Nashville and Rustin was arrested. He was beaten and taken to a police station but was released uncharged.

He spoke about his decision to be arrested, and how that moment also clarified his witness as a gay person, in an interview with the &quot;Washington Blade&quot; in the 1980s:

In 1942, Rustin assisted two other FOR staffers, George Houser and James Farmer, and activist Bernice Fisher as they formed the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). Rustin was not a direct founder, but was later described as &quot;an uncle of CORE&quot;. CORE had been conceived as a pacifist organization based on the writings of Mohandas Gandhi, who used non-violent resistance against British rule in India. CORE was also influenced by his protégé Krishnalal Shridharani&#x27;s book &quot;War without Violence&quot;.

As declared conscientious objectors who refused induction into the military, Rustin, Houser, and other members of FOR and CORE were convicted of violating the Selective Service Act. From 1944 to 1946, Rustin was imprisoned in Ashland Federal Prison in Kentucky, and later the Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary, in Pennsylvania. At both, he organized protests against racially segregated housing and dining facilities. During his incarceration, he also organized FOR&#x27;s Free India Committee. After his release from prison, he was frequently arrested for protesting against British colonial rule, in both India and Africa.

Just before a trip to Africa while college secretary of the FOR, Rustin recorded a 10-inch LP, &quot;Elizabethan Songs and Negro Spirituals,&quot; for the Fellowship Records label. He sang spirituals and Elizabethan songs, accompanied on the harpsichord by Margaret Davison.

==Influence on the Civil Rights Movement==

Rustin and Houser organized the Journey of Reconciliation in 1947. This was the first of the Freedom Rides to test the 1946 ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States in &quot;Morgan v. Commonwealth of Virginia&quot; that banned racial discrimination in interstate travel as unconstitutional. Rustin and CORE executive secretary George Houser recruited a team of fourteen men, divided equally by race, to ride in pairs through Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky. The NAACP opposed CORE&#x27;s Gandhian tactics as too meek. Participants in the Journey of Reconciliation were arrested several times. Arrested with Igal Roodenko and Joe Felmet, Rustin served twenty-two days on a chain gang in North Carolina for violating state Jim Crow laws regarding segregated seating on public transportation. On June 17, 2022, Chapel Hill Superior Court Judge Allen Baddour, with full consent of the state, dismissed the 1947 North Carolina charges against the four Freedom Riders, with members of the exonerees&#x27; families in attendance.

In 1948, Rustin traveled to India to learn techniques of nonviolent civil resistance directly from the leaders of the Gandhian movement. The conference had been organized before Gandhi&#x27;s assassination earlier that year. Between 1947 and 1952, Rustin also met with leaders of independence movements in Ghana and Nigeria. In 1951, he formed the committee to Support South African Resistance, which later became the American Committee on Africa.

Rustin was arrested in Pasadena, California, in January 1953 for sexual activity in a parked car with two men in their 20s. Originally charged with vagrancy and lewd conduct, he pleaded guilty to a single, lesser charge of &quot;sex perversion&quot; (as sodomy was officially referred to in California at the time, even if consensual) and served 60 days in jail. The Pasadena arrest was the first time that Rustin&#x27;s homosexuality had come to public attention. He had been and remained candid in private about his sexuality, although homosexual activity was still criminalized throughout the United States. Rustin resigned from the Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR) because of his convictions. They also greatly affected Rustin&#x27;s relationship with A. J. Muste, the director of the FOR. Muste had already tried to change Rustin&#x27;s sexuality earlier in their relationship with no success. Later in Rustin&#x27;s life, they continued their relationship with more tension than they had previously. Rustin became the executive secretary of the War Resisters League. An American Legion chapter in Montana used Rustin&#x27;s Pasadena conviction to try to cancel his lectures in the state.

Rustin served as an unidentified member of the American Friends Service Committee&#x27;s task force to write &quot;Speak Truth to Power: A Quaker Search for an Alternative to Violence&quot;, published in 1955. This was one of the most influential and widely commented upon pacifist essays in the United States. Rustin had wanted to keep his participation quiet, as he believed that his known sexual orientation would be used by critics as an excuse to compromise the 71-page pamphlet when it was published. It analyzed the Cold War and the American response to it, and recommended non-violent solutions.

Rustin took leave from the War Resisters League in 1956 to advise minister Martin Luther King Jr. of the Baptist Church on Gandhian tactics. King was organizing the public transportation boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, which became known as the Montgomery bus boycott. According to Rustin, &quot;I think it&#x27;s fair to say that Dr. King&#x27;s view of non-violent tactics was almost non-existent when the boycott began. In other words, Dr. King was permitting himself and his children and his home to be protected by guns.&quot; Rustin convinced King to abandon the armed protection, including a personal handgun. In a 1964 interview with Robert Penn Warren for the book &quot;Who Speaks for the Negro?,&quot; Rustin also reflected that his integrative ideology began to differ from King&#x27;s. He believed a social movement &quot;has to be based on the collective needs of people at this time, regardless of color, creed, race.&quot;

The following year, Rustin and King began organizing the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). Many African-American leaders were concerned that Rustin&#x27;s sexual orientation and past Communist membership would undermine support for the civil rights movement. After the organization of the SCLC, Rustin and King planned a civil rights march adjacent to the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. This did not sit well with U.S. Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Powell threatened to leak to the press rumors of a fake affair between Rustin and King. King, acting in his interests, canceled the march, and Rustin left his position in the SCLC. King received criticism for this action from &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; magazine, which wrote about him: &quot;Lost much moral credit ... in the eyes of the young.&quot; Although Rustin was open about his sexual orientation and his convictions were a matter of public record, the events had not been discussed widely beyond the civil rights leadership. Rustin did not let this setback change his direction in the movement.
===March on Washington===
Despite shunning from some civil rights leaders,

A few weeks before the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in August 1963, South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond railed against Rustin as a &quot;Communist, draft-dodger, and homosexual&quot;, and had his entire Pasadena arrest file entered in the record. Thurmond also produced a Federal Bureau of Investigation photograph of Rustin talking to King while King was bathing, to imply that there was a same-sex relationship between the two. Both men denied the allegation of an affair.

Rustin became involved in the March on Washington in 1962 when he was recruited by A. Philip Randolph. The march was planned to be a commemoration of the Emancipation Proclamation one hundred years earlier. Rustin was instrumental in organizing the march. He drilled off-duty police officers as marshals, bus captains to direct traffic, and scheduled the podium speakers. Eleanor Holmes Norton and Rachelle Horowitz were aides. Despite King&#x27;s support, NAACP chairman Roy Wilkins did not want Rustin to receive any public credit for his role in planning the march. Roy Wilkins said, &quot;This march is of such importance that we must not put a person of his liabilities at the head.&quot; Because of this conflict, Randolph served as the director of the march and Rustin as his deputy. During the planning of the march, Rustin feared his previous legal issues would pose a threat to the march. Nevertheless, Rustin did become well known. On September 6, 1963, a photograph of Rustin and Randolph appeared on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine, identifying them as &quot;the leaders&quot; of the March. Rustin stated his thoughts on the march and said it &quot;made Americans feel for the first time that we were capable of being truly a nation, that we were capable of moving beyond division and bigotry&quot;.

===New York City school boycott===

At the beginning of 1964, Reverend Milton Galamison and other Harlem community leaders invited Rustin to coordinate a citywide boycott of public schools to protest their de facto segregation. Prior to the boycott, the organizers asked the United Federation of Teachers Executive Board to join the boycott or ask teachers to join the picket lines. The union declined, promising only to protect from reprisals any teachers who participated. More than 400,000 New Yorkers participated in a one-day February 3, 1964, boycott. Historian Daniel Perlstein notes that &quot;newspapers were astounded both by the numbers of black and Puerto Rican parents and children who boycotted and by the complete absence of violence or disorder from the protesters.&quot; It was, Rustin stated, and newspapers reported, &quot;the largest civil rights demonstration&quot; in American history. Rustin said that &quot;the movement to integrate the schools will create far-reaching benefits&quot; for teachers as well as students.

The protest demanded complete integration of the city&#x27;s schools (which would require some whites to attend schools in black neighborhoods), and it challenged the coalition between African Americans and white liberals. An ensuing white backlash affected relations among the black leaders. Writing to black labor leaders, Rustin denounced Galamison for seeking to conduct another boycott in the spring and soon abandoned the coalition.

Rustin organized a May March 18 which called for &quot;maximum possible&quot; integration. Perlstein recounts: &quot;This goal was to be achieved through such modest programs as the construction of larger schools and the replacement of junior high schools with middle schools. The UFT and other white moderates endorsed the May rally, yet only four thousand protesters showed up, and the Board of Education was no more responsive to the conciliatory May demonstration than to the earlier, more confrontational boycott.&quot;

When Rustin was invited to speak at the University of Virginia in 1964, school administrators tried to ban him, out of fear that he would organize a school boycott there.

===From protest to politics===
In the spring of 1964, Martin Luther King was considering hiring Rustin as executive director of SCLC but was advised against it by Stanley Levison, a longtime activist friend of Rustin&#x27;s. He opposed the hire because of what he considered Rustin&#x27;s growing devotion to the political theorist Max Shachtman. Other SCLC leaders opposed Rustin due to his sexuality.

At the 1964 Democratic National Convention, which followed Freedom Summer in Mississippi, Rustin became an adviser to the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP); they were trying to gain recognition as the legitimate, non-Jim Crow delegation from their state, where blacks had been officially disenfranchised since the turn of the century (as they were generally throughout the South) and excluded from the official political system. DNC leaders Lyndon Johnson and Hubert Humphrey offered only two non-voting seats to the MFDP, with the official seating going to the regular segregationist Mississippi delegation. Rustin and the AFL–CIO leaders urged the MFDP to take the offer. MFDP leaders, including Fannie Lou Hamer and Bob Moses, angrily rejected the arrangement; many of their supporters became highly suspicious of Rustin. Rustin&#x27;s attempt to compromise appealed to the Democratic Party leadership.

After the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Rustin advocated closer ties between the civil rights movement and the Democratic Party, specifically the party&#x27;s base among the white working class, many of whom still had strong union affiliations. With Tom Kahn, Rustin wrote an influential article in 1964 called &quot;From Protest to Politics&quot;, published in &quot;Commentary&quot; magazine; it analyzed the changing economy and its implications for African Americans. Rustin wrote presciently that the rise of automation would reduce the demand for low-skill high-paying jobs, which would jeopardize the position of the urban African-American working class, particularly in northern states. He believed that the working class had to collaborate across racial lines for common economic goals. His prophecy has been proven right in the dislocation and loss of jobs for many urban African Americans due to the restructuring of industry in the coming decades.
Rustin believed that the African-American community needed to change its political strategy, building and strengthening a political alliance with predominately white unions and other organizations (churches, synagogues, etc.) to pursue a common economic agenda. He wrote that it was time to move from protest to politics. Rustin&#x27;s analysis of the economic problems of the Black community was widely influential.

Rustin argued that since black people could now legally sit in the restaurant after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, they needed to be able to afford service financially. He believed that a coalition of progressive forces to move the Democratic Party forward was needed to change the economic structure.

He also argued that the African-American community was threatened by the appeal of identity politics, particularly the rise of &quot;Black power&quot;. He thought this position was a fantasy of middle-class black people that repeated the political and moral errors of previous black nationalists, while alienating the white allies needed by the African-American community. &quot;Nation&quot; editor and Harvard Law Professor Randall Kennedy noted later that, while Rustin had a general &quot;disdain of nationalism&quot;, he had a &quot;very different attitude toward Jewish nationalism&quot; and was &quot;unflaggingly supportive of Zionism&quot;.

&quot;Commentary&quot; editor-in-chief Norman Podhoretz had commissioned the article from Rustin, and the two men remained intellectually and personally aligned for the next 20 years. Podhoretz and the magazine promoted the neoconservative movement, which had implications for civil rights initiatives as well as other economic aspects of the society. In 1985, Rustin publicly praised Podhoretz for his refusal to &quot;pander to minority groups&quot; and for opposing affirmative action quotas in hiring as well as black studies programs in colleges.

Because of these positions, Rustin was criticized as a &quot;sell-out&quot; by many of his former colleagues in the civil rights movement, especially those connected to grassroots organizing. They charged that he was lured by the material comforts that came with a less radical and more professional type of activism. Biographer John D&#x27;Emilio rejects these characterizations, and &quot;portrays the final third of Rustin&#x27;s life as one in which his reputation among his former allies was routinely questioned. After decades of working outside the system, they simply could not accept working within the system.&quot; However, Randall Kennedy wrote in a 2003 article that descriptions of Rustin as &quot;a bought man&quot; are &quot;at least partly true&quot;, noting that his sponsorship by the AFL–CIO brought him some financial stability but imposed boundaries on his politics.

Kennedy notes that despite Rustin&#x27;s conservative turn in the mid-1960s, he remained a lifelong socialist, and D&#x27;Emilio argues that in the final phase of his life, Rustin remained on the left: &quot;D&#x27;Emilio explains, even as Rustin was taking what appeared to be a more &quot;conservative&quot; turn, he remained committed to social justice. Rustin was making radical and ambitious demands for a basic redistribution of wealth in American society, including universal healthcare, the abolition of poverty, and full employment.&quot;

===Labor movement: Unions and social democracy===
Rustin increasingly worked to strengthen the labor movement, which he saw as the champion of empowerment for the African American community and for economic justice for all Americans. He contributed to the labor movement&#x27;s two sides, economic and political, through the support of labor unions and social-democratic politics.
He was the founder and became the Director of the A. Philip Randolph Institute, which coordinated the AFL-CIO&#x27;s work on civil rights and economic justice. He became a regular columnist for the AFL-CIO newspaper.

On the political side of the labor movement, Rustin increased his visibility as a leader of the American movement for social democracy. In early 1972, he became a national co-chairman of the Socialist Party of America. In December 1972, when the Socialist Party changed its name to Social Democrats, USA (SDUSA) by a vote of 73–34, Rustin continued to serve as national co-chairman, along with Charles S. Zimmerman of the International Ladies Garment Workers&#x27; Union (ILGWU). In his opening speech to the December 1972 Convention, Co-Chairman Rustin called for SDUSA to organize against the &quot;reactionary policies of the Nixon Administration&quot;; Rustin also criticized the &quot;irresponsibility and élitism of the &#x27;New Politics&#x27; liberals&quot;. In later years, Rustin served as the national chairman of SDUSA.

During the 1960s, Rustin was a member of the League for Industrial Democracy. He would remain a member for years, and became vice president during the 1980s.

===Foreign policy===
Like many liberals and some socialists, Rustin supported President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s containment policy against communism, while criticizing specific conduct of this policy. In particular, to maintain independent labor unions and political opposition in Vietnam, Rustin and others gave critical support to U.S. military intervention in the Vietnam War, while calling for a negotiated peace treaty and democratic elections. Rustin criticized the specific conduct of the war, though. For instance, in a fundraising letter sent to War Resisters League supporters in 1964, Rustin wrote of being &quot;angered and humiliated by the kind of war being waged, a war of torture, a war in which civilians are being machine-gunned from the air, and in which American napalm bombs are being dropped on the villages.&quot;

Along with Allard Lowenstein and Norman Thomas, Rustin worked with the CIA-sponsored Committee on Free Elections in the Dominican Republic, which lent international credibility to a 1966 ballot effectively rigged against the socialist former president, Juan Bosch.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Rustin worked as a human rights and election monitor for Freedom House.

In 1970, Rustin called for the U.S. to send military jets in the fight against Arab states by Israel; referring to a &quot;New York Times&quot; article he wrote, Rustin wrote to Prime Minister Golda Meir &quot;...I hope that the ad will also have an effect on a serious domestic question: namely, the relations between the Jewish and the Negro communities in America.&quot; Rustin was concerned about unity between two groups that he argued faced discrimination in America and abroad, and also believed that Israel&#x27;s democratic ideals were proof that justice and equality would prevail in the Arab territories despite the atrocities of war. His former colleagues in the peace movement considered it to be a profound betrayal of Rustin&#x27;s nonviolent ideals.

Rustin maintained his strongly anti-Soviet and anti-communist views later in his life, especially with regard to Africa. Rustin co-wrote with Carl Gershman (a former director of Social Democrats, USA and future Ronald Reagan appointee) an essay entitled &quot;Africa, Soviet Imperialism &amp; the Retreat of American Power&quot;, in which he decried Russian and Cuban involvement in the Angolan Civil War and defended the military intervention by apartheid South Africa on behalf of the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). &quot;And if a South African force did intervene at the urging of &quot;black&quot; leaders and on the side of the forces that clearly represent the &quot;black&quot; majority in Angola, to counter a non-African army of Cubans ten times its size, by what standard of political judgment is this immoral?&quot; Rustin accused the Soviet Union of a classic imperialist agenda in Africa in pursuit of economic resources and vital sea lanes, and called the Carter Administration &quot;hypocritical&quot; for claiming to be committed to the welfare of blacks while doing too little to thwart Russian and Cuban expansion throughout Africa.

In 1976, Rustin was a member of the anti-communist Committee on the Present Danger (CPD), founded by politician Paul Nitze. Nitze was a member of Team B, the independent analysts commissioned by George Bush to scrutinize the CIA&#x27;s assessments of the Soviet nuclear threat. CPD promoted Team B&#x27;s controversial intelligence claims about Soviet foreign policy, using them as an argument against arms control agreements such as SALT II.

=== Soviet Jewry movement ===

The plight of Jews in the Soviet Union reminded Rustin of the struggles that blacks faced in the United States. Soviet Jews faced many of the same forms of discrimination in employment, education, and housing, while also being prisoners within their own country by being denied the chance to emigrate by Soviet authorities. After seeing the injustice that Soviet Jews faced, Rustin became a leading voice in advocating for the movement of Jews from the Soviet Union to Israel. He worked closely with Senator Henry Jackson of Washington, who introduced legislation that tied trade relations with the Soviet Union to their treatment of Jews. In 1966 he chaired the historic Ad hoc Commission on Rights of Soviet Jews organized by the Conference on the Status of Soviet Jews, leading a panel of six jurors in the commission&#x27;s public tribunal on Jewish life in the Soviet Union. Members of the panel included Telford Taylor, the Nuremberg war trial prosecutor and Columbia University professor of law, Dr. John C. Bennett, president of the Union Theological Seminary; Reverend George B. Ford, pastor emeritus of the Corpus Christi Church; Samuel Fishman representing United Automobile Workers; and Norman Thomas, veteran Socialist leader. The commission collected testimonies from Soviet Jews and compiled them into a report that was delivered to the secretary-general of the United Nations. The report urged the international community to demand that the Soviet authorities allow Jews to practice their religion, preserve their culture, and emigrate from the USSR at their will. The testimonies from Soviet Jews were published by Moshe Decter, the executive secretary of the Conference on the Status of Soviet Jews, in a book—&quot;Redemption! Jewish freedom letters from Russia&quot;, with a foreword by Rustin. Through the 1970s and 1980s Rustin wrote several articles on the subject of Soviet Jewry and appeared at Soviet Jewry movement rallies, demonstrations, vigils, and conferences, in the United States and abroad. He co-sponsored the National Interreligious Task Force on Soviet Jewry. Rustin allied with Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, an outspoken advocate for Soviet Jewry, and worked closely with Senator Henry Jackson, informing the Jackson–Vanik amendment, vital legislation that restricted United States trade with the Soviet Union in relation to its treatment of Jews.

=== Criticisms ===
Rustin was at the forefront of the freedom struggle for African Americans but parted ways from the activists in 1968. He was considered an “Uncle Tom” by some as he started to fight for equality for all and not just blacks. An incident in the summer of 1964 in which a police officer killed a black child led to violence. “When he urged blacks to resist with non-violence, they spat at him and shot back “Uncle Tom! Uncle Tom!”. Rustin’s views of the protest were to “urge them not to behave with desperation but politically and rationally.” He would later switch from radicalism to a truly collaborative approach. Rustin wanted blacks to align themselves with whites to see progression.

===Gay rights===
Davis Platt, Bayard&#x27;s partner from the 1940s, said &quot;I never had any sense at all that Bayard felt any shame or guilt about his homosexuality. That was rare in those days. Rare.&quot;

Bayard often would be viewed as bisexual because of those attracted to him. His relationships were mainly with the men, both black and white. However, his longer relationships were with the latter. Rustin did not realize his sexual orientation when he was in school. His awareness left no worry, and his family openly accepted it.

Rustin did not engage in any gay rights activism until the 1980s. He was urged to do so by his partner Walter Naegle, who has said that &quot;I think that if I hadn&#x27;t been in the office at that time, when these invitations [from gay organizations] came in, he probably wouldn&#x27;t have done them.&quot; He was an advocate for people with AIDS/HIV, and because of his public works, he may have “came out” to the public. Rustin no longer hid his sexual orientation from others. “His aim--to how people responded to him as a black gay man—was “the new barometer for social change”.

Because same-sex marriage was not officially recognized at the time, Rustin and Naegle undertook to solidify their partnership and protect their union legally through adoption: in 1982 Rustin adopted Naegle, 30 years old at the time. Naegle explained that Bayard:

Rustin testified in favor of the New York City Gay Rights Bill. In 1986, he gave a speech titled &quot;The New Niggers Are Gays&quot;, in which he asserted:

Also in 1986, Rustin was invited to contribute to the book &quot;In the Life: A Black Gay Anthology&quot;. He declined, explaining:

I was not involved in the struggle for gay rights as a youth... I did not &quot;come out of the closet&quot; voluntarily—circumstances forced me out. While I have no problem with being publicly identified as homosexual, it would be dishonest of me to present myself as one who was in the forefront of the struggle for gay rights... I fundamentally consider sexual orientation to be a private matter. As such, it has not been a factor which has greatly influenced my role as an activist.

==Death and beliefs==

Rustin died on August 24, 1987, of a perforated appendix. An obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, &quot;Looking back at his career, Mr. Rustin, a Quaker, once wrote: &#x27;The principal factors which influenced my life are 1) nonviolent tactics; 2) constitutional means; 3) democratic procedures; 4) respect for human personality; 5) a belief that all people are one. Rustin was survived by Walter Naegle, his partner of ten years.

Rustin&#x27;s personal philosophy is said to have been inspired by combining Quaker pacifism with socialism (as taught by A. Philip Randolph), and the theory of non-violent protest popularized by Mahatma Gandhi.

President Ronald Reagan issued a statement on Rustin&#x27;s death, praising his work for civil rights and &quot;for human rights throughout the world&quot;. He added that Rustin &quot;was denounced by former friends, because he never gave up his conviction that minorities in America could and would succeed based on their individual merit&quot;.

==Legacy==
According to journalist Steve Hendrix, Rustin &quot;faded from the shortlist of well-known civil rights lions&quot;, in part because he was active behind the scenes, and also because of public discomfort with his sexual orientation and former communist membership. In addition, Rustin&#x27;s tilt toward neo-conservatism in the late 1960s led him into a disagreement with most civil rights leaders. But, the 2003 documentary film &quot;Brother Outsider: The Life of Bayard Rustin&quot;, a Sundance Festival Grand Jury Prize nominee, and the March 2012 centennial of Rustin&#x27;s birth have contributed to renewed recognition of his extensive contributions.

Rustin served as chairman of Social Democrats, USA, which, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote in 2013, &quot;was a breeding ground for many neoconservatives&quot;. French historian Justin Vaïsse classifies him as a &quot;right-wing socialist&quot; and &quot;second age neoconservative&quot;, citing his role as vice-chair of the Coalition for a Democratic Majority, which was involved in the second incarnation of the Committee on the Present Danger.

According to Daniel Richman, former clerk for United States Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall, Marshall&#x27;s friendship with Rustin, who was open about his homosexuality, played a significant role in Marshall&#x27;s dissent from the court&#x27;s 5–4 decision upholding the constitutionality of state sodomy laws in the later overturned 1986 case &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot;.

Several buildings have been named in honor of Rustin, including the Bayard Rustin Educational Complex located in Chelsea, Manhattan; Bayard Rustin High School near his hometown of West Chester, Pennsylvania; Bayard Rustin Library at the Affirmations Gay/Lesbian Community Center in Ferndale, Michigan; the Bayard Rustin Social Justice Center in Conway, Arkansas, and the Bayard Rustin Center for Social Justice in Princeton, New Jersey; the Bayard Rustin Room at Friends House, London, UK.

Rustin is one of two men who have both participated in the Penn Relays and had a school, West Chester Rustin High School, named in his honor that participates in the relays. In 1968, two months after the King assassination, Montclair State University gave Rustin an honorary Doctor of Letters degree. In 1985, Haverford College awarded Rustin an honorary doctorate in law.

===1990s and 2000s===
In 1995, a Pennsylvania State Historical Marker was placed at Lincoln and Montgomery Avenues, West Chester, Pennsylvania, on the grounds of Henderson High School, which he attended.

A 1998 anthology movie, &quot;Out of the Past&quot;, featured letters and archival footage of Rustin.

The West Chester Area School District voted in 2002 to approve the creation of Bayard Rustin High School in a 6–3 vote. Those in favor mentioned Rustin&#x27;s involvement in the civil rights movement, and opposition was tied to Rustin&#x27;s sexuality and political views. The school opened in 2006.

In July 2007 after a year&#x27;s collaboration starting in June 2006, a group of San Francisco Bay Area Black LGBT community leaders officially formed the Bayard Rustin Coalition (BRC), with the permission of the Estate of Bayard Rustin. The BRC promotes greater Black participation in the electoral process, advances civil and human rights issues, and promotes the legacy of Rustin.

===2010s and beyond===

In 2011, the Bayard Rustin Center for LGBTQA Activism, Awareness, and Reconciliation was announced at Guilford College, a Quaker school. Formerly the Queer and Allied Resource Center, the center was rededicated in March 2011 with the permission of the Estate of Bayard Rustin and featured a keynote address by social justice activist Mandy Carter.

In 2012, Rustin was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display which celebrates LGBTQ history and people. In 2013, Rustin was selected as an honoree in the United States Department of Labor Hall of Honor.

On August 8, 2013, President Barack Obama posthumously awarded Rustin the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. The citation in the press release stated:

Bayard Rustin was an unyielding activist for civil rights, dignity, and equality for all. An advisor to the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., he promoted nonviolent resistance, participated in one of the first Freedom Rides, organized the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, and fought tirelessly for marginalized communities at home and abroad. As an openly gay African American, Mr. Rustin stood at the intersection of several of the fights for equal rights.

At the White House ceremony on November 20, 2013, President Obama presented Rustin&#x27;s award to Walter Naegle, his partner of ten years at the time of Rustin&#x27;s death.

In 2014, Rustin was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco&#x27;s Castro neighborhood noting LGBTQ people who have &quot;made significant contributions in their fields&quot;. In April 2018, the Montgomery County Board of Education in Maryland voted to name the Bayard Rustin Elementary School after Rustin.

Canadian writer Steven Elliott Jackson wrote a play that stages an imaginary meeting and one-night-stand between Rustin and Walter Jenkins of the Johnson administration called &quot;The Seat Next to the King&quot;. The play won the award for Best Play at the 2017 Toronto Fringe Festival. A full-length play with music, written by Steve H. Broadnax III, &quot;Bayard Rustin Inside Ashland&quot;, dramatizing Rustin&#x27;s World War II prison experience and its central role in his lifetime of activism, had its world premiere on May 22, 2022, at People&#x27;s Light and Theatre Company in Malvern, Pennsylvania.

The Bayard Rustin Center for Social Justice was established in Princeton, New Jersey in 2018, with Naegle acting as Board Member Emeritus. It serves as a community activist center and safe space for LGBTQ kids, intersectional families, and marginalized people.

Rustin was one of the fifty inaugural American &quot;pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes&quot; inducted in June 2019 to the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor, within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City&#x27;s Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and queer history, with the unveiling timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.

In January 2020, California State Senator Scott Wiener, chair of the California Legislative LGBT Caucus, and Assemblywoman Shirley Weber, chair of the California Legislative Black Caucus, called for Governor Gavin Newsom to issue a pardon for Rustin&#x27;s 1953 Pasadena arrest, citing Rustin&#x27;s legacy as a civil rights icon. Newsom issued the pardon on February 5 while also announcing a new process for fast-tracking pardons for those convicted under historical laws criminalizing homosexuality.

In 2021 Higher Ground Productions, founded by Michelle and Barack Obama, announced production of &quot;Rustin&quot;, a biographical film directed by George C. Wolfe and starring Colman Domingo in the title role. The film premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on August 31, 2023, and was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 13, 2023. It received a limited theatrical release on November 3, 2023, followed by a Netflix release on November 17. Reviews were generally positive, with Colman Domingo&#x27;s performance garnering numerous accolades including Best Actor nominations for the Academy Award, BAFTA Award, and Golden Globe Award.

A street in Nyack, New York was renamed &quot;Bayard Rustin Way&quot; in 2022 to honor Rustin&#x27;s memory.

On June 5, 2023, the Pasadena City Council adopted a resolution introduced by Councilmember Jason Lyon declaring that the &quot;City of Pasadena celebrates and concurs in the Governor&#x27;s 2020 pardon of Bayard Rustin&quot; and supporting the issuance of a commemorative United States postage stamp honoring Rustin.

<text>The Doobie Brothers are an American rock band formed in San Jose, California in 1970. Known for their flexibility in performing across numerous genres and their vocal harmonies, the band has been active for over five decades, with their greatest success taking place in the 1970s. The group&#x27;s current lineup consists of founding members Tom Johnston (guitars, keyboards, harmonica, vocals) and Patrick Simmons (guitars, banjo, recorder, vocals), alongside Michael McDonald (keyboards, synthesizers, vocals) and John McFee (guitars, pedal steel guitar, mandolin, banjo, violin, cello, harmonica, vocals), and touring musicians including John Cowan (bass, vocals), Marc Russo (saxophones), Ed Toth (drums), and Marc Quiñones (percussion, backing vocals). Other long-serving members of the band include guitarist Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter, bassist Tiran Porter and drummers John Hartman, Michael Hossack, and Keith Knudsen.

Johnston provided the lead vocals for the band from 1970 to 1975, when they featured a mainstream rock sound with elements of folk, country and R&amp;B. Michael McDonald joined the band in 1975 as a keyboardist and second lead vocalist, to give some relief to Johnston, who was suffering health problems at the time. McDonald&#x27;s interest in soul music introduced a new sound to the band. Johnston and McDonald performed together as co-lead vocalists for one album, &quot;Takin&#x27; It to the Streets&quot;, before Johnston retired fully in 1977. Frequent lineup changes followed through the rest of the 1970s, and the band broke up in 1982 with Simmons being the only constant member having appeared on all of their albums. In 1987, the Doobie Brothers reformed with Johnston back in the fold. McDonald, who had previously made several guest appearances since their reformation, returned to the band full-time in 2019 for their 50th anniversary tour.

The group&#x27;s fourteen studio albums include six top-ten appearances on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, including 1978&#x27;s &quot;Minute by Minute&quot;, which reached number one for five weeks, and won the band a Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group, while the single &quot;What a Fool Believes&quot; from the album won three Grammys itself. Their sixteen &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top-40 hits include &quot;Listen to the Music&quot;, &quot;Jesus Is Just Alright&quot;, &quot;Long Train Runnin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;China Grove&quot;, &quot;Black Water&quot; (#1 in 1974), &quot;Takin&#x27; It to the Streets&quot;, &quot;What a Fool Believes&quot; (#1 in 1979), and &quot;The Doctor&quot;, all of which receive rotation on classic hits radio stations. They have also released six live albums, and numerous greatest hits compilations, including 1976&#x27;s &quot;Best of the Doobies&quot;, which was certified diamond by the RIAA for reaching album sales of ten million copies, the band&#x27;s best selling album. The Doobie Brothers were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on November 7, 2020. The group has sold more than 40 million records worldwide.

==Career==
===Original incarnation===
Drummer John Hartman arrived in California in 1969 determined to meet Skip Spence of Moby Grape and join an aborted Grape reunion. Spence introduced Hartman to singer, guitarist, and songwriter Tom Johnston and the two proceeded to form the nucleus of what would become the Doobie Brothers. Johnston and Hartman called their fledgling group &quot;Pud&quot; and experimented with lineups (occasionally including Spence) and styles as they performed in and around San Jose. They were mostly a power trio (along with bassist Greg Murphy) but briefly worked with a horn section.

In 1970 they teamed up with singer, guitarist, and songwriter Patrick Simmons and bassist Dave Shogren. Simmons had belonged to several area groups (among them &quot;Scratch&quot;, an acoustic trio with future Doobies bassist Tiran Porter) and also performed as a solo artist. He was already an accomplished fingerstyle player whose approach to the instrument complemented Johnston&#x27;s rhythmic R&amp;B strumming.

While still playing locally around San Jose, the group adopted the name &quot;Doobie Brothers&quot;. Their friend Keith &quot;Dyno&quot; Rosen, who lived with or next-door to the band, came up with the name after the band had difficulty coming up with one on their own. According to Tom Johnston, Rosen said, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you call yourself the Doobie Brothers because you&#x27;re always smoking pot?&quot; Hartman has said he wasn&#x27;t involved with choosing the name, and didn&#x27;t know that &quot;doobie&quot; meant a marijuana joint until Rosen told him. Everyone in the band agreed that &quot;Doobie Brothers&quot; was a &quot;dumb&quot; or &quot;stupid&quot; name. Simmons has said the band intended to use the name only for a few early performances until they came up with something better, but they never did.

The Doobie Brothers improved their playing by performing live all over Northern California in 1970. They attracted a particularly strong following among local chapters of the Hells Angels and got a recurring gig at one of the bikers&#x27; favorite venues, the Chateau Liberté {{citation needed span|in the Santa Cruz mountains, playing there through the summer of 1975 (although some of these concerts did not include all band members and were of an impromptu nature). A set of demos, which showcased fuzz-toned dual lead electric guitars, three-part harmonies and Hartman&#x27;s drumming, caught the ear of Warner Brothers&#x27; staff A &amp; R representative Ted Templeman, and eventually earned the group a contract at Warner Bros. Records before the year was out.

The band&#x27;s image originally reflected that of their biggest fans—leather jackets and motorcycles. Released in April 1971, their self-titled debut album departed significantly from that image and their live sound of the period. Produced at Pacific Recorders in San Mateo, the album, which failed to chart, emphasized acoustic guitars and reflected country influences. The leadoff song &quot;Nobody&quot;, the band&#x27;s first single, has surfaced in their live set several times over the ensuing decades. Most recently, this song was re-recorded and added to their 2010 album &quot;World Gone Crazy&quot;.

In the late spring/summer of 1971, their record label sent the Doobies out on their first national tour in tandem with the group Mother Earth, the &quot;Mother Brothers Tour&quot;. Also in 1971, the group toyed with the idea of adding a second drummer, supplementing Hartman&#x27;s drumming on some of their shows with that of United States Navy veteran Michael Hossack while still touring behind their first album.

Moving to Warner Brothers&#x27; newly acquired Amigo Studios in North Hollywood starting in late October 1971, the band recorded several songs for their next album with Shogren on bass, guitar, and background vocals, but Shogren left after disagreements with the group&#x27;s producer, Ted Templeman. Shogren was replaced in December 1971 with singer, songwriter, and bass guitarist Tiran Porter, while Hossack was added to the lineup at the same time as a regular. Porter and Hossack were both stalwarts of the Northern California music scene, Porter having previously played in Scratch with Simmons. Porter brought a funkier bass style and added his husky baritone to the voices of Johnston and Simmons, resulting in a rich three-part blend.

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Toulouse Street&quot; (which contained the hits &quot;Listen to the Music&quot; and &quot;Jesus Is Just Alright&quot;), brought their breakthrough success after its release in July 1972. In collaboration with manager Bruce Cohn, producer Ted Templeman and engineer Donn Landee, the band put forward a more polished and eclectic set of songs. Pianist Bill Payne of Little Feat contributed keyboards for the first time, beginning a decades-long collaboration that included many recording sessions and even a two-week stint touring with the band in early 1974.

A string of hits followed, including Johnston&#x27;s &quot;Long Train Runnin&#x27;{{-&quot;}} and &quot;China Grove&quot;, from the 1973 album &quot;The Captain and Me&quot;. Other noteworthy songs on the album were Simmons&#x27; country-ish ode &quot;South City Midnight Lady&quot; and the explosive, hard rocking raveup &quot;Without You&quot;, for which the entire band received songwriting credit. Onstage, the latter song sometimes stretched into a 15-minute jam with additional lyrics completely ad-libbed by Johnston. A 1973 appearance on the debut episode of the television music variety show &quot;Don Kirshner&#x27;s Rock Concert&quot; featured one such performance of the tune.

In the midst of recording sessions for their next album, 1974&#x27;s &quot;What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits&quot;, and rehearsals for a 1973 fall tour, Hossack abruptly departed the band, citing burnout from constant touring. Drummer, songwriter, and vocalist Keith Knudsen (who previously drummed for Lee Michaels of &quot;Do You Know What I Mean&quot; fame) was recruited promptly in September 1973 and left with the Doobies on a major tour a few weeks later (Hossack subsequently replaced Knudsen in the band Bonaroo, which served as an opening act for the Doobies shortly thereafter). Both Hossack&#x27;s drums and Knudsen&#x27;s voice are heard on &quot;Vices&quot;.

In 1974, Steely Dan co-lead guitarist Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter learned that his band was retiring from the road and that Donald Fagen and Walter Becker intended to work almost exclusively with session players in the future. In need of a steady gig, he joined the Doobie Brothers as third lead guitarist in the middle of their current tour. He had previously worked with the band in the studio, adding pedal steel guitar to both &quot;Captain&quot; (&quot;South City Midnight Lady&quot;) and &quot;Vices&quot; (&quot;Black Water&quot;, &quot;Tell Me What You Want&quot;) and was already playing with the band as a special guest during that year&#x27;s tour.

&quot;Vices&quot; included the band&#x27;s first No. 1 single, Simmons&#x27; signature tune &quot;Black Water&quot;. It topped the charts in March 1975 and eventually propelled the album to multi-platinum status. Johnston&#x27;s lyrical &quot;Another Park, Another Sunday&quot; (as a single, it featured &quot;Black Water&quot; as the B-side) and his horn-driven funk song &quot;Eyes of Silver&quot; also charted the year before at numbers 32 &amp; 52, respectively.

During this period and for several subsequent tours, the Doobies were often supported on stage by Stax Records mainstays the Memphis Horns. Live recordings with the horn section have aired on radio on the &quot;King Biscuit Flower Hour&quot;, but none have been officially released. The Memphis Horns also appeared as session players on multiple Doobies albums.

By the end of 1974, Johnston&#x27;s health was suffering from the rigors of the road. He was absent when the band joined the Beach Boys, Chicago, and Olivia Newton-John on &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve&quot; that December. By then, the western-themed &quot;Stampede&quot; had been completed for release in 1975. It featured yet another hit single, Johnston&#x27;s cover of the Holland–Dozier–Holland-written Motown hit &quot;Take Me in Your Arms&quot; (originally sung by Kim Weston and also covered by the Isley Brothers, Blood Sweat and Tears and Mother Earth). Simmons contributed the atmospheric &quot;I Cheat the Hangman&quot;, as well as &quot;Neal&#x27;s Fandango&quot;, an ode to Santa Cruz, Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady. Ry Cooder added his slide guitar to Johnston&#x27;s cowboy song, &quot;Rainy Day Crossroad Blues&quot;.

By the start of the Spring 1975 promotional tour for &quot;Stampede&quot;, Johnston&#x27;s condition was so precarious that he required emergency hospitalization for a bleeding ulcer. With Johnston convalescing and the tour already underway, Baxter proposed recruiting a fellow Steely Dan alum to fill the hole: singer, songwriter, and keyboardist Michael McDonald. Simmons, Knudsen, Porter and McDonald divided Johnston&#x27;s singing parts on tour while Simmons and Baxter shared lead guitar responsibilities.

===Michael McDonald years===
Under contract to release another album in 1976, the Doobies were at a crossroads. Their primary songwriter and singer remained unavailable, so they turned to McDonald and Porter for material to supplement that of Simmons. The resulting LP, &quot;Takin&#x27; It to the Streets&quot;, debuted a radical change in their sound. Their electric guitar-based rock and roll gave way to a more soft rock and blue-eyed soul sound, emphasizing keyboards and horns and subtler, more syncopated rhythms. Baxter contributed jazz-inflected guitar stylings reminiscent of Steely Dan, along with unusual, complex harmony and longer, more developed melody. Above all, McDonald&#x27;s voice became the band&#x27;s new signature sound. &quot;Takin&#x27; It to the Streets&quot; featured McDonald&#x27;s title track and &quot;It Keeps You Runnin&#x27;&quot;, both hits. (A second version of &quot;It Keeps You Runnin&#x27;&quot;, performed by Carly Simon, appeared on her album &quot;Another Passenger&quot;, with the Doobies backing her.) Bassist Porter wrote and sang &quot;For Someone Special&quot; as a tribute to the absent Johnston. A greatest hits compilation, &quot;Best of the Doobies&quot;, followed before year&#x27;s end. (In 1996, the Recording Industry Association of America certified &quot;Best of the Doobies&quot; &quot;Diamond&quot; for sales in excess of 10 million units.)

Their new sound was further refined, and McDonald&#x27;s dominant role cemented with 1977&#x27;s &quot;Livin&#x27; on the Fault Line&quot;. It featured a cover of the Motown classic &quot;Little Darling (I Need You)&quot; and &quot;Echoes of Love&quot;, which had been written by Willie Mitchell for, but not recorded by, Al Green. Mitchell (then of the Memphis Horns) and Earl Randle had both worked with Green a good bit. Simmons added some music and lyrics, co-writing the finished version with Mitchell and Randle; the song was later covered not just by the Pointer Sisters but by Lyn Paul, the ex-New Seekers vocalist. The album also featured the song &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; (co-written by McDonald and Carly Simon, who had a hit with her own version of the tune). To help promote &quot;Fault Line&quot;, the band performed live on the PBS show &quot;Soundstage&quot;. Baxter used an early type of guitar synthesizer (made by Roland) on many of the tracks (especially the title track and &quot;China Grove&quot;).

Both &quot;Streets&quot; and &quot;Fault Line&quot; reflected Johnston&#x27;s diminished role in the group following his illness. Restored to fitness and briefly back in the fold, he contributed one original song to &quot;Streets&quot; (&quot;Turn It Loose&quot;), and also sang a verse on Simmons&#x27; tune &quot;Wheels of Fortune&quot;. He also made live appearances with the band in 1976 (documented in a concert filmed that year at the Winterland in San Francisco, excerpts of which appear occasionally on VH1 Classic) but was sidelined once again that fall due to exhaustion. None of Johnston&#x27;s songs appeared on &quot;Fault Line&quot;, though he had written and the band had recorded five of his compositions for the album. Regardless, he received credit for guitars and vocals and was pictured on the album&#x27;s inner sleeve band photo. He soon left the band he co-founded, embarking on a solo career that eventually yielded one modestly successful 1979 Warner Brothers album, &quot;Everything You&#x27;ve Heard is True&quot;, which featured the single &quot;Savannah Nights&quot;, and the less successful album &quot;Still Feels Good&quot; in 1981.

During this period of transition, the band also elevated former roadie Bobby LaKind to onstage backup vocalist and percussionist. In the studio, LaKind first contributed percussion to &quot;Streets&quot; but had been a member of the band&#x27;s lighting crew since 1974. Additionally, in January 1978, the band appeared as themselves in two episodes of the ABC sitcom &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot;, performing &quot;Little Darlin&#x27; (I Need You)&quot;, &quot;Black Water&quot;, &quot;Takin&#x27; It to the Streets&quot;, and &quot;Take Me in Your Arms&quot;. Performances were done live (versus lip synching to a pre-recorded track), with some overdubs added in post production, notably during Baxter&#x27;s solo on &quot;Take Me in Your Arms (Rock Me a Little While),&quot; which was lifted from the album version.

After almost a decade on the road, and with seven albums to their credit, the Doobies&#x27; profile was substantially elevated by the success of their next album, 1978&#x27;s &quot;Minute by Minute&quot;. It spent five weeks atop the charts and dominated several radio formats for the better part of two years. McDonald&#x27;s song &quot;What a Fool Believes&quot;, written with Kenny Loggins, was the band&#x27;s second No. 1 single and earned the songwriting duo (along with producer Ted Templeman) a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. The album won a Grammy for Pop Vocal Performance by a Group and was nominated for Album of the Year. Both &quot;What a Fool Believes&quot; and the title track were nominated for Song of the Year, with &quot;What a Fool Believes&quot; winning the award. Among the other memorable songs on the album are &quot;Here to Love You&quot;, &quot;Dependin&#x27; On You&quot; (co-written by McDonald and Simmons), &quot;Steamer Lane Breakdown&quot; (a Simmons bluegrass instrumental) and McDonald&#x27;s &quot;How Do the Fools Survive?&quot; (co-written by Carole Bayer Sager). Nicolette Larson and departed former bandleader Johnston contributed guest vocals on the album.

&quot;Minute by Minute&quot;{{&#x27;}}s triumph was bittersweet because it coincided with the near dissolution of the band. The pressure of touring while recording and releasing an album each year had worn the members down. Baxter and McDonald had been in creative conflict for some time. McDonald desired a direct, soulful and polished rock/R&amp;B sound, while Baxter insisted on embellishing guitar parts in an increasingly avant-garde style. (Both McDonald and Baxter elaborated on the matter in the documentary series &quot;Behind the Music&quot;, which aired on VH1 in February 2001.) Just as &quot;Minute by Minute&quot;{{&#x27;}}s success became apparent, Hartman, Baxter, and LaKind left the band. A two-song set on the January 27, 1979, broadcast of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (with guest host Michael Palin) marked the final television appearance of this lineup, and a brief tour of Japan marked the band&#x27;s last live performances in this configuration (Hartman subsequently joined Johnston&#x27;s touring band in 1979 and taped an appearance with him that aired on &quot;Soundstage&quot; in 1980).

Looking to capitalize on the momentum provided by the success of &quot;Minute by Minute&quot;, the remaining Doobies (Simmons, Knudsen, McDonald and Porter) decided to embark on a national tour with a reconstituted lineup. In 1979 Hartman was replaced by session drummer Chet McCracken and Baxter by multi-instrumental string player John McFee (late of Huey Lewis&#x27;s early band Clover); Cornelius Bumpus (who had been part of a recent reunion of Moby Grape) was also recruited to add vocals, keyboards, saxophones, and flute to the lineup. This lineup toured throughout 1979, including stops at Madison Square Garden and New York City&#x27;s Battery Park for the No Nukes benefit shows with like-minded artists such as Bonnie Raitt, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, James Taylor, Carly Simon, Jackson Browne, Bruce Springsteen and John Hall.

1980 marked LaKind&#x27;s return to the lineup as a full-time member and the Doobies&#x27; ninth studio album, &quot;One Step Closer&quot;. The LP featured the hit title track and the Top 10 hit &quot;Real Love&quot; (not to be confused with the John Lennon composition) but did not dominate the charts and the radio as &quot;Minute by Minute&quot; had, largely due to an oversaturation of the &quot;McDonald sound&quot; by many other artists (such as Robbie Dupree&#x27;s hit &quot;Steal Away&quot;, which copied the &quot;McDonald sound&quot; nearly note for note) on the radio at the time—not to mention McDonald&#x27;s numerous guest vocal appearances on hits by other artists, such as Kenny Loggins, Christopher Cross, Lauren Wood and Nicolette Larson. The album itself was also noticeably weaker musically than the previous three with the band sounding tired and seemingly devolving to little more than McDonald&#x27;s &quot;backup band&quot; (according to contemporary sources). &quot;Ted and Michael became one faction against Pat and the rest of us&quot;, Porter said in an interview. Long frustrated with the realities of relentless touring and yearning for a stable home life, as well as battling an admitted cocaine problem, Porter left the band after the recording of &quot;Closer&quot;. Session bassist Willie Weeks joined the band and the Doobies continued touring throughout 1980 and 1981 (post-Doobies, Weeks has performed with the Gregg Allman Band, Eric Clapton, and many others).{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Also, during the 1981 tour, veteran session drummer Andy Newmark stepped in briefly for Knudsen, who was then in rehab. And by the end of 1981, even Simmons had left the band. Now with no remaining original members and a &quot;leader&quot; in McDonald who was ready for a solo career, the group elected instead to disband after a rehearsal without Simmons, according to an interview with McDonald for &quot;Listen to the Music&quot;, the Doobie Brothers&#x27; official video history/documentary released in 1989. He went on to say that by that point they could not have gotten further away from the Doobies sound if they had tried. Simmons, already at work on his first solo album, &quot;Arcade&quot;, rejoined for a 1982 farewell tour on the condition that this truly would be the end of the Doobie Brothers. At their last concert at the Greek Theatre in Berkeley, California, on September 11, 1982, they were joined onstage by founding member Tom Johnston for what was presumed to be the final rendition of his staple, &quot;China Grove&quot;. Former members Porter, Hossack and Hartman subsequently took the stage for an extended version of &quot;Listen to the Music&quot;. Knudsen sang lead vocals while Johnston, Simmons and McFee traded licks on guitar. The live album &quot;Farewell Tour&quot; was released in 1983 and the Greek Theatre concert was released in 2011 as &quot;Live at the Greek Theatre 1982&quot;.

===Reunion===
The Doobies did not work together for the next five years, though various members got together in different configurations for annual Christmas season performances for the patients and staff at the Stanford Children&#x27;s Hospital in the Bay area. Simmons released a commercially disappointing solo album, &quot;Arcade&quot;, in April 1983. During the mid-1980s, Johnston toured U.S. clubs with a band called Border Patrol, which did not release any recordings. Hossack and (briefly) Simmons worked with the group. Around 1986, Johnston and Simmons began working on an album together (according to a 1989 interview with Simmons) but abandoned the project soon after with no known finished tracks. 

In 1983 Knudsen and McFee formed the band Southern Pacific and recorded four albums that found success in the country charts (former Creedence Clearwater Revival bassist Stu Cook joined the band in 1986 and former Pablo Cruise guitarist David Jenkins in 1988).

Out of print for many years, Simmons&#x27; &quot;Arcade&quot; was reissued on compact disc in 2007 by specialty label Wounded Bird Records, which is also the home of Southern Pacific&#x27;s and Tom Johnston&#x27;s catalogs. 

Post-Doobies, McDonald became established as a solo artist. His voice dominated adult contemporary radio throughout the 1980s, and he experienced a renaissance of popularity in the 21st century as an interpreter of Motown classics.

The reformation of the Doobie Brothers was not intentional. On a personal quest for a worthy cause and after conquering his drug addiction, Knudsen became active in the Vietnam Veterans Aid Foundation. In early 1987, he persuaded 11 Doobie alumni to join him for a concert to benefit veterans&#x27; causes. Answering the call were Tom Johnston, Pat Simmons, Jeff Baxter, John McFee, John Hartman, Michael Hossack, Chet McCracken, Michael McDonald, Cornelius Bumpus, Bobby LaKind and Tiran Porter, plus their long-time record producer and good friend, Ted Templeman. There were no surplus bass players as Weeks had other commitments. They soon discovered that tickets were in great demand, so the concert quickly evolved into a 12-city tour that began on May 21, 1987, in San Diego. The third concert, held at the Hollywood Bowl, was reportedly the venue&#x27;s fastest sell-out since the Beatles had played there just over 20 years earlier. The band performed selections from every album using a wide variety of instrumentation that they could not have previously duplicated onstage without the expanded lineup. Baxter and McFee played pedal steel and violin, respectively, during &quot;Black Water&quot; and &quot;Steamer Lane Breakdown&quot;. &quot;Without You&quot; featured four drummers and four lead guitarists. Producer Ted Templeman played percussion and LaKind sometimes played Knudsen&#x27;s drum set while Knudsen went to the front of the stage to join the chorus. Templeman also played the drum set on &quot;What a Fool Believes&quot;, as he did on the original hit record. The tour culminated (sans McDonald, LaKind, McFee and Knudsen) at the Glasnost-inspired July 4 &quot;Peace Concert&quot; in Moscow, with Bonnie Raitt, James Taylor and Santana sharing the bill. Excerpts appearing later that year on the Showtime cable network included a performance of &quot;China Grove&quot;.

The successful 1987 reunion sparked discussions about reconstituting the band on a permanent basis. They eventually decided to replicate the &quot;Toulouse Street&quot;/&quot;Captain and Me&quot; incarnation, settling on a lineup featuring Johnston, Simmons, Hartman, Porter and Hossack, plus more recent addition LaKind, and released &quot;Cycles&quot; on Capitol Records in 1989. The album featured a Top 10 single, &quot;The Doctor&quot;. The song is very similar to &quot;China Grove&quot;, and the connection was further enhanced by guest Bill Payne&#x27;s tinkling piano. Other material on the album included Johnston&#x27;s &quot;South of the Border&quot;, Dale Ockerman&#x27;s and Pat Simmons&#x27; &quot;Take Me to the Highway&quot;, and &quot;I Can Read Your Mind&quot;, a version of the Isley Brothers&#x27; &quot;Need a Little Taste of Love&quot;, and a version of the Four Tops classic, &quot;One Chain (Don&#x27;t Make No Prison)&quot;, which had been covered by Santana years before. &quot;Cycles&quot; proved a successful comeback album and was certified Gold. Bumpus participated in the 1989 and 1990 tours, adding his distinctive voice, keyboards, saxophone and flute. His presence bridged the gap between the current band and the McDonald era; he sang lead vocals on &quot;One Step Closer&quot; (as he originally had on the 1980 album) while Simmons took McDonald&#x27;s part. The group was further augmented on the 1989 tour by Dale Ockerman (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), Richard Bryant (percussion, vocals) and Jimi Fox (percussion, backing vocals). After being diagnosed with terminal colon cancer, LaKind stepped down before the tour to focus on his health.

===The 1990s===
The success of &quot;Cycles&quot; led to the release of 1991&#x27;s &quot;Brotherhood&quot;, also on Capitol. The group members grew their hair back out, wore denim and leather, and attempted to revive their biker image of the early 1970s. In spite of the makeover and strong material led by Simmons&#x27; now trademark &quot;Dangerous&quot; (featured in the Brian Bosworth biker film &quot;Stone Cold&quot;), &quot;Brotherhood&quot; was unsuccessful, in part due to a lack of support from Capitol Records, who dropped the group from their roster by the end of 1991.

The accompanying tour (with the 1989 lineup, but without Bumpus), which also featured Joe Walsh on the bill, was ranked among the ten least profitable tours of the disappointing 1991 summer season by the North American Concert Promoters Association, and after losing the Capitol deal, the group was inactive by the end of &#x27;91, its future uncertain.

The 1987 Doobie Brothers alumni band reunited on October 17 and 19, 1992, at the Concord Pavilion in Concord, California to perform benefit shows for LaKind&#x27;s children. LaKind, terminally ill with colon cancer, joined the group on percussion for a few numbers. The concerts were recorded and subsequently broadcast on the Superstars in Concert radio series accompanied by a plea for contributions to the LaKind family fund.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} LaKind died on December 24, 1992, at the age of 47.

Another brief hiatus followed during which Simmons collaborated with bassist and songwriter John Cowan (ex-New Grass Revival), Rusty Young (of Poco) and Bill Lloyd (of Foster &amp; Lloyd) on an unreleased project called Four Wheel Drive.

When the band emerged yet again in 1993, Hartman and Porter had retired from the road for good but Knudsen and McFee rejoined the Doobie Brothers on a full-time basis after Southern Pacific disbanded. Joined by Ockerman, Bumpus and Weeks, the group toured with Four Wheel Drive as the opening act. After Weeks left the tour to resume his session work, Cowan played bass for both bands. Bumpus also left to join the reunited Steely Dan, giving way to saxophonist, keyboardist and harmonica player Danny Hull. Former band member Chet McCracken temporarily filled in for an injured Hossack in July 1993. Their 1994 tour included co-headlining appearances with Foreigner.

With renewed energy in the mid-1990s, the band began to experiment with different arrangements of several tunes. They even pulled from McDonald&#x27;s songbook from time to time, eventually restoring &quot;Takin&#x27; it to the Streets&quot; to the setlist with Simmons and new bass guitarist Skylark (who joined in 1995) substituting for McDonald on lead vocals.

====Return to permanent touring====
The band has toured continuously since 1993. In 1995 they reunited with McDonald for a co-headlining tour with the Steve Miller Band. The &quot;Dreams Come True&quot; tour featured all three primary songwriters and singers and reflected all phases of the band&#x27;s career. Bumpus rejoined for the 1995 tour, with McCracken replacing the absent Knudsen and Bernie Chiaravalle sitting in for McFee.

On January 28, 1996, they performed during the Super Bowl XXX pre-game show at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona.

A 1996 double live album, &quot;Rockin&#x27; Down the Highway: The Wildlife Concert&quot;, featured McDonald on three of his signature tunes. McDonald was a reoccurring special guest with the group for benefits, private corporate shows and parties (such as the wedding reception of Liza Minnelli and David Gest, their former advance publicist), until returning as a permanent member in 2019 for the band&#x27;s 50th Anniversary Tour, which resumed in 2021 after being halted due to COVID-19.

In mid-1996, Ockerman was replaced by keyboardist Guy Allison (ex–Moody Blues and Air Supply). Saxophonist Marc Russo (ex-Yellowjackets) joined in early 1998, replacing Hull.

In 1999 the band obtained an injunction preventing a tribute band featuring former members McCracken, Bumpus and Shogren from performing under any variation of the &quot;Doobie Brothers&quot; name.

===The 2000s===
In 1999 Rhino Records released the group&#x27;s first box set, &quot;Long Train Runnin&#x27;: 1970–2000&quot;, which featured remastered tunes from the band&#x27;s entire catalog, a new studio recording of the live concert staple &quot;Little Bitty Pretty One&quot; and an entire disc of previously unreleased studio outtakes and live recordings. And Rhino&#x27;s release the following year, &quot;Sibling Rivalry&quot;, was the band&#x27;s first new studio album since 1991. The material reflected contributions from both Knudsen and McFee, ranging from rock to hip-hop, jazz, adult contemporary and country. The album sold poorly, reflecting the declining sales throughout the adult-oriented rock musical scene.

On June 22, 2001, while heading to a show at Caesars Tahoe in Lake Tahoe, Hossack suffered multiple fractures in a motorcycle accident on Highway 88 and had to be airlifted to a Sacramento-area hospital, where he underwent surgery. Drummer and percussionist M. B. Gordy was recruited to fill in for Hossack. After being sidelined for months, Hossack returned to the band in mid-2002. Gordy remained with the band as an auxiliary percussionist until 2005.

Saxophonist Ed Wynne, from the Wayne Brady Show, filled in for Marc Russo for the Doobies&#x27; 2002 summer tour.

On October 26, 2004, the Doobie Brothers released &quot;Live at Wolf Trap&quot;, a live album that was recorded at Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts in Vienna, Virginia on July 25 of that year. The album features the final recordings of drummer and vocalist Keith Knudsen, who died in February 2005. Ed Toth, from the band Vertical Horizon, took over Keith&#x27;s spot .

===The 2010s===
For its 2010 and 2012 summer tours, the band was once again paired with Chicago, as it had been in 1974, 1999 and 2008.

In March 2010 longtime bass guitarist/vocalist Skylark resigned from the band after suffering a serious stroke. John Cowan, who had originally toured with the band in the mid-1990s, returned to take Skylark&#x27;s place, and has been with the band ever since. Three months later, before the band embarked on its 2010 summer tour with Chicago, Hossack was forced to sit out following a diagnosis of cancer. Tony Pia, a member of the Brian Setzer Orchestra, was recruited to substitute for Hossack. Pia became an official touring member of the band following Hossack&#x27;s death in 2012.

On September 28, 2010 the Doobie Brothers released their 13th studio album, &quot;World Gone Crazy&quot;, produced by their longtime producer Ted Templeman. &quot;World Gone Crazy&quot; was the first Doobie Brothers album Templeman produced since 1980&#x27;s &quot;One Step Closer&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Nobody&quot;, was free-streamed on their website.

By March 2012, five members of the Doobie Brothers family were deceased: percussionist/vocalist LaKind on December 24, 1992, of colon cancer; original bass guitarist / vocalist Shogren of unreported causes on December 14, 1999; saxophonist, keyboardist, vocalist, and flutist Bumpus of a heart attack on February 3, 2004, while in the air en route to California for a solo tour; drummer, vocalist, and activist Keith Knudsen on February 8, 2005, of cancer and chronic pneumonia; and drummer Michael Hossack of cancer on March 12, 2012.

On November 13, 2012 the Doobie Brothers released an official documentary, &quot;Let the Music Play: The Story of the Doobie Brothers&quot;. It features interviews and rare footage from their early days of the 1970s to the present day. Johnston, Simmons, McDonald, McFee, Porter, and Baxter, along with manager Bruce Cohn, producer Ted Templeman, and members of the Johnston and Simmons families are interviewed in the film.

In March 2014 the Doobie Brothers, in conjunction with Sony Music Nashville, announced that their 14th studio album would be released featuring the greatest hits of their 40+-year career. The album would feature lead and backing vocals from several country artists, and Michael McDonald returned to collaborate on the album. Featured artists included Sara Evans, Vince Gill, Hunter Hayes, Casey James, Toby Keith, Love and Theft, Jerrod Niemann, Brad Paisley, Blake Shelton, Tyler Farr, Chris Young, Charlie Worsham, and the Zac Brown Band.

The album, entitled &quot;Southbound&quot;, was released on November 4, 2014. The following day, the Doobie Brothers and Michael McDonald were featured musical guests on the 47th Annual CMA Awards to celebrate its release, and were joined by Hunter Hayes, Jennifer Nettles, and Hillary Scott in a performance of &quot;Listen to the Music&quot;. At the end of the ceremony, in addition to Hayes, Nettles, and Scott, they were joined by co-host Brad Paisley for &quot;Takin&#x27; It to the Streets&quot;.

The Doobie Brothers performed at Music City Roots on May 13, 2015, sharing the stage with Béla Fleck and Dan Tyminski. This was the band&#x27;s second performance at the venue, after an all-acoustic performance in 2011. The acoustic portion of the 2015 show featured songs that had not been heard by audiences in years, including the bluesy Chicago from their debut album and the title track from &quot;Toulouse Street&quot;.

In early August 2015, keyboardist/backing vocalist Guy Allison was called to fly out to Japan to work on an album project. Little Feat co-founder and pianist Bill Payne, known for his contributions to many of the band&#x27;s early studio albums, was selected to temporarily fill in for Allison in his absence. Allison briefly returned to the band after their September 5 show at Susquehanna Bank Center in Camden, New Jersey.

On August 20, 2015, the Doobie Brothers and Michael McDonald were the featured musical guests on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, where they performed a medley of &quot;Long Train Runnin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Takin&#x27; It to the Streets&quot;. The band also performed a web-exclusive performance of &quot;What a Fool Believes&quot; that was made available on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;{{&#x27;}}s website.

On the afternoon of September 11, 2015, the Doobie Brothers performed at the Lockn&#x27; Festival in Arrington, Virginia, sharing the stage with the jam band the String Cheese Incident. The Doobies then flew to Cherokee, North Carolina for an evening concert.

In October 2015 Payne officially took over Guy Allison&#x27;s duties as the Doobies&#x27; keyboardist, whilst remaining an active member of Little Feat.

On November 24, 2015, the Doobie Brothers together with Journey launched a tour featuring Dave Mason. The pairing with Journey continued on May 12, 2016, at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre and concluded on September 4, 2016, when the Doobies and Journey joined the Steve Miller Band and Santana at AT&amp;T Park. They also appeared at Warren Haynes Christmas Jam on December 12, 2015, however Johnston did not appear at the show due to knee surgery. They officially announced that Payne would replace Allison on December 1, 2015.

In March 2016 the Doobie Brothers signed under new management with Irving Azoff. Drummer Tony Pia left the band in the summer of 2016, leaving Ed Toth as the band&#x27;s sole drummer.

In January 2017 the Doobie Brothers announced that Chicago would once again join them for their Summer 2017 tour. The tour began on June 7 at the Concord Pavilion and wrapped up on July 30 in Virginia Beach. They appeared with the Eagles and Steely Dan at the Classic concerts for two weekends in July 2017. These concerts took place on July 15 at Dodger Stadium billed as the Classic West and July 29 Citi Field as the Classic East. The success of these concerts led an appearance at the Classic Northwest concert on September 30 held at Safeco Field, opening again for the Eagles. The band took the last leg of their 2017 world tour to Europe in late October and early November, opening for Steely Dan.

During 2018, they announced that they would tour again with Steely Dan. This tour began in Charlotte, North Carolina and concluded in Bethel, New York in July. Former Allman Brothers percussionist Marc Quiñones joined the band in May 2018, and on July 16, 2018, the band announced that they would perform the &quot;Toulouse Street&quot; and &quot;The Captain and Me&quot; albums in their entirety along with a selection select of hits, at the Beacon Theatre in New York City on November 15–16, 2018. These shows marked the first time the band performed at the theatre in 25 years. The concerts were recorded and subsequently released as a live album on June 28, 2019.

During the summer of 2019, the band toured with Santana. On November 18, 2019, the band performed at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville and performed the &quot;Toulouse Street&quot; and &quot;The Captain and Me&quot; albums in their entirety once again. Michael McDonald joined the band for an encore and they performed &quot;Takin&#x27; It to the Streets&quot;. At the end of the concert, Simmons made the announcement that McDonald would re-join the band and participate in the band&#x27;s 50th Anniversary tour .

Since the early 2000s, they have headlined and performed at many benefit concerts including former manager Cohn&#x27;s B.R. Cohn Winery in Glen Ellen where they had also shared the stage with McDonald in 2006 and 2012. Cohn sold his winery in 2015 to set his primary focus on managing the band and the B.R Cohn Charity Fall Music Festival was relocated to the Sonoma Valley Field of Dreams. The festival was renamed the Sonoma Music Festival. The Doobie Brothers and McDonald, Chicago and Ringo Starr headlined the three-day event.

===The 2020s===
On January 15, 2020, it was announced that the Doobie Brothers were one of the six groups that would be inducted into the 2020 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The induction included living members Tom Johnston, Patrick Simmons, Michael McDonald, John McFee, Tiran Porter, John Hartman and Jeff Baxter, while drummer &amp; vocalist Keith Knudsen and drummer Michael Hossack would be inducted posthumously. The induction ceremony was originally scheduled to take place on May 2, 2020, in Cleveland, but was postponed to November 7 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The November 7 induction ceremony was held virtually on HBO Max, with Johnston, McDonald, and Simmons pre-recording their induction speeches on behalf of the other band members who were inducted alongside them.

In February 2020, the Doobie Brothers had a scheduled residency at the Venetian in Las Vegas. The band was only three shows into their eight-day residency when they were forced to cancel the remaining five dates after it was mentioned that there was an illness in the band. It was later discovered that Johnston had an early version of COVID-19, the virus that would end up becoming designated as a pandemic just one month later.

On May 26, 2020, the Doobie Brothers officially announced that they had rescheduled their 50th Anniversary tour to 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and confirmed that the line up of this tour would include McDonald for the first time in 25 years.

During their time in isolation throughout 2020, the Doobie Brothers released at-home performances of &quot;Black Water&quot;, &quot;Listen to the Music&quot;, and &quot;Takin&#x27; it to the Streets&quot;. These performances can be found on their social media accounts, such as YouTube and Facebook. In addition, they collaborated with Dave Mason for a cover of Traffic&#x27;s &quot;Feelin&#x27; Alright&quot; and Peter Frampton for a cover of Eric Clapton&#x27;s &quot;Let it Rain&quot;.

On August 6, 2021, the Doobie Brothers released the EP of four songs that would eventually be featured on their fifteenth studio album. These songs included Johnston&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Ya Mess with Me&quot; and &quot;Oh Mexico&quot; along with Simmons&#x27;s &quot;Better Days&quot; and &quot;Cannonball&quot;.

After just over 18 months of not being able to tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the band (with McDonald back in the fold) finally began their 50th Anniversary Tour at the Iowa State Fair on Sunday, August 22, 2021. The first leg of the tour concluded at the PPL Center in Allentown, Pennsylvania on October 29, 2021, and the second leg began in West Palm Beach, Florida on June 2, 2022. Bill Payne left the touring band at the end of the first leg, citing his desire to commit &quot;100%&quot; to Little Feat. He was not replaced, and the tour continued with McDonald returning to his original role of primary keyboardist.

The Doobie Brothers were featured musical guests on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; on Thursday, September 23, 2021.

On October 29, 2021, the band released &quot;Liberté&quot;, their fifteenth full-length studio album and first album of original material in 11 years. All of the tracks on the album were co-written with John Shanks. Shanks is known for his work with Bon Jovi, Sheryl Crow, and Melissa Etheridge, to name a few.

Original drummer John Hartman died on December 29, 2021. The band posted a tribute to him on their website in September 2022.{{refn|group=nb|Due to the timing of the tribute being posted, many news articles mistakenly report that Hartman died in September 2022.}}

In 2023, Johnston, McDonald, and Simmons (as the Doobie Brothers) were nominated for induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In addition, a continuation of their 50th Anniversary tour was planned for the year.

The Doobies started their 2023 touring schedule in Australia and Japan in April before making their way to Hawaii and then returning to the continental U.S. in May. Three days before they were set to perform in Hollywood, Florida, the band released a statement that Tom Johnston would be undergoing surgery following severe back pain and wouldn&#x27;t be able to join the band on the upcoming leg of the 50th Anniversary Tour. Simmons, McDonald, and McFee continued the 2023 touring schedule in Johnston&#x27;s absence. Lead vocal duties normally done by Johnston were shared between Simmons, McDonald, and bassist John Cowan.

In June 2023, Simmons said in an interview that the band will be releasing new music the next year with McDonald.

The band opened for the Eagles on the latter&#x27;s The Long Goodbye Tour in November 2023, replacing Steely Dan due to health issues surrounding Donald Fagen.

On November 17, 2023, the Doobie Brothers released a new single entitled &quot;Lahaina&quot; to benefit the families and individuals affected by the 2023 Hawaii wildfires. The song, produced by John Shanks, features Mick Fleetwood on drums, Jake Shimabukuro on ukulele, and Henry Kapono on vocals.

In 2024 a fully healed Tom Johnston rejoined the Doobies, who continued on with their 50th Anniversary tour.

<text>GNAT is a free-software compiler for the Ada programming language which forms part of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). It supports all versions of the language, i.e. Ada 2012, Ada 2005, Ada 95 and Ada 83. Originally its name was an acronym that stood for &quot;GNU NYU Ada Translator&quot;, but that name no longer applies. The front-end and run-time are written in Ada.

== History ==

The GNAT project started in 1992 when the United States Air Force awarded New York University (NYU) a contract to build a free compiler for Ada to help with the Ada 9X standardization process. The 3-million-dollar contract required the use of the GNU GPL for all development, and assigned the copyright to the Free Software Foundation. The first official validation of GNAT occurred in 1995.

In 1994 and 1996, the original authors of GNAT founded two sister companies, Ada Core Technologies in New York City and ACT-Europe (later AdaCore SAS) in Paris, to provide continuing development and commercial support of GNAT. The two companies always operated as one entity, but did not formally unify until 2012 as AdaCore.

GNAT was initially released separately from the main GCC sources. On October 2, 2001, the GNAT sources were contributed to the GCC CVS repository. The last version to be released separately was GNAT 3.15p, based on GCC 2.8.1, on October 2, 2002. Starting with GCC 3.4, on major platforms the official GCC release is able to pass 100% of the ACATS Ada tests included in the GCC testsuite. By GCC 4.0, more exotic platforms were also able to pass 100% of the ACATS tests.

== License ==

The compiler is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL 3+ with GCC Runtime Library Exception.

All versions leading up to and including 3.15p are licensed under the GMGPL offering similar runtime exceptions. The GMGPL license is GNU GPL 2 with a linking exception that permits software with licenses that are incompatible with the GPL to be linked with the output of Ada standard generic libraries that are supplied with GNAT without breaching the license agreement.

== Versions ==

FSF GNAT is part of most major Linux or BSD distributions and is included in the main GCC Sources.

GNAT Pro is a supported version of GNAT from AdaCore.

In addition to FSF GNAT and AdaCore&#x27;s GNAT Pro, AdaCore releases additional versions (GNAT-GPL, a public older version of GNAT Pro, and GNAT GAP, a version for AdaCore&#x27;s educational programs). These AdaCore versions have the runtime exceptions removed, this requires software that is linked with the standard libraries to have GPL-compatible licenses to avoid being in breach of the license agreement.

JGNAT was a GNAT version that compiled from the Ada programming language to Java bytecode.
GNAT for dotNET is a GNAT version that compiles from the Ada programming language to Common Language Infrastructure for the .NET Framework and the free and open source implementations Mono and Portable.NET.

<doc id="172880" wikidata="Q696647" url="?curid=172880" title="Mountbatten-Windsor">
<text>Mountbatten-Windsor is the personal surname used by some of the male-line descendants of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Under a declaration made at a Privy Council meeting in 1960, the name &quot;Mountbatten-Windsor&quot; applies to male-line descendants of Queen Elizabeth II without royal styles and titles. Individuals with royal styles do not usually use a surname, but some descendants of the Queen with royal styles have used &quot;Mountbatten-Windsor&quot; when a surname was required.

==Privy Council Declaration==
The full text of the 1960 Privy Council declaration is:
My Lords
Whereas on the 9th day of April 1952, I did declare in Council My Will and Pleasure that I and My children shall be styled and known as the House and Family of Windsor, and that My descendants, other than female descendants who marry and their descendants, shall bear the name of Windsor:
And whereas I have given further consideration to the position of those of My descendants who will enjoy neither the style, title or attribute of Royal Highness, nor the titluar dignity of Prince and for whom therefore a surname will be necessary:
And whereas I have concluded that the Declaration made by Me on the 9th day of April 1952, should be varied in its application to such persons:
Now therefore I declare My Will and Pleasure that, while I and My Children shall continue to be styled and known as the House and Family of Windsor, My descendants other than descendants enjoying the style, title or attribute of Royal Highness and the titular dignity of Prince or Princess and female descendants who marry and their descendants shall bear the name of Mountbatten-Windsor.
The Privy Council declaration made it so that Elizabeth&#x27;s descendants with princely titles and male-line descendants who bear princely titles keep the name Windsor, pursuant to a declaration she made in a previous Privy Council meeting at the beginning of her reign; female descendants who marry, their descendants, and any other descendants who do not hold princely titles use the surname Mountbatten-Windsor. While many of her descendants hold princely titles and styles, they usually use Mountbatten-Windsor instead of Windsor.

==Current use==
The British monarchy asserts that the name &quot;Mountbatten-Windsor&quot; is used by members of the royal family who do not have a surname, when a surname is required. For example, Anne, Princess Royal, and Prince Andrew, Duke of York, children of Queen Elizabeth II, used the surname &quot;Mountbatten-Windsor&quot; in official marriage registry entries in 1973 and 1986 respectively. Likewise, William, Prince of Wales, used the name when filing a French lawsuit related to the topless pictures of his wife published by the French magazine &quot;Closer&quot;.

At the time of the 1960 declaration, palace officials claimed in private communications that it created a hidden surname that would emerge several generations later when some of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s descendants were further removed from the throne. On the wedding of Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones in 1999, the Queen decided, with their agreement, that any of their future children should not be styled His or Her Royal Highness. Consequently, the birth of their daughter in 2003 marked the first emergence of the Mountbatten-Windsor surname. Their daughter was named Louise Alice Elizabeth Mary Mountbatten-Windsor, and she goes by the title of Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor, her father being the Duke of Edinburgh.

Mountbatten-Windsor differs from the official name of the British royal family, which remains the House of Windsor. In accordance with law and custom in the English-speaking world, the surname &quot;Mountbatten-Windsor&quot; belongs to all male-line descendants of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, and is used by them if and when a surname is needed. In contrast, male-line descendants of King George V, the first monarch of the House of Windsor, use &quot;Windsor&quot; as their surname if and when a surname is needed, as for example Lady Davina Windsor and Lady Marina Windsor, respectively descended from George V&#x27;s sons Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Prince George, Duke of Kent. (George V&#x27;s other sons have no male-line descendants: King George VI had only daughters while King Edward VIII had no issue and Prince John was unmarried.) After the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was renamed Windsor, other descendants of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert could also use the name Windsor, as for example, Alastair Arthur Windsor, 2nd Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, grandson of their son Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. None do so today, however, because the only male line (apart from the descendants of King George V) is through Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, whose descendants use the surname Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (English) or von Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha (German).

==Male-line descendants of Elizabeth II and Philip==
The family tree is based on the current line of succession to the British throne (addition of last heir)

<text>A private copying levy (also known as blank media tax or levy) is a government-mandated scheme in which a special tax or levy (additional to any general sales tax) is charged on purchases of recordable media. Such taxes are in place in various countries and the income is typically allocated to the developers of &quot;content&quot;. (A distinction is sometimes made between &quot;tax&quot; and &quot;levy&quot; based on the recipient of the accumulated funds; taxes are received by a government, while levies are received by a private body, such as a copyright collective.)

Levy system may operate in principle as a system of collectivisation, partially replacing a property approach of sale of individual units.

==History==

Such levies were first introduced in Germany in the 1960s. With the advent of the audio cassette, legislators were persuaded that cassette recorders would decimate sales of records as friend after friend would then make copies of only one purchased album. Levies today are assessed on recordable compact discs, a form of media that did not exist when levies were first conceived. Although the bulk of unrecorded compact discs are actually used in the computing industry, they are still &quot;taxed&quot; to provide a revenue stream to the recording industry.

A common misconception is that levies are compensation for illegal copying such as file sharing. This is incorrect, however, levies are only intended to compensate for private copying that is legally allowed in many jurisdictions. For example, uploading a purchased CD on to another personal device such as a laptop or MP3 player. Generally, legislators allow private copies for two reasons: firstly, because otherwise, the enforcement would be unfeasible for private reasons, and secondly, because the administrative burden would be disproportionate.

=== European Union review ===

In the European Union, the legal basis for levies is the 2001 InfoSoc Directive. It mandates that EU countries must put in place a compensation scheme to compensate rightsholders for harm caused where there is a private copy exemption. 

In 2015, the European Parliament approved a non-binding resolution (Reda Report) asking a review of the levy in the European Union, building on previous resolutions and studies. However, there has been no change in the EU legal framework since. Industry players continue to lobby for reform of the system which they argue is outdated and does not reflect the rise in streaming services which has caused a drop in private copying.

==Questions on fairness==
A difficulty that immediately arises is the practical impossibility of devising a mechanism for distributing the proceeds to copyright holders that is considered &quot;fair&quot; by all copyright holders and consumers. Implemented systems are typically restricted to music and may distribute the proceeds proportionally to a measurement of sales of CDs in music shops or amount of air-play on radio or the like. This ignores other distribution channels such as the Internet, and it disproportionally benefits popular artists and publishers of the related products. Fairer methods would arguably involve extensive sampling of purchasers to determine actual recording behaviour, or alternatively paying all musicians at a simple flat-rate (the preferred method will depend on one&#x27;s political views).

While the prime purpose of levy systems is to compensate authors, some part of the collected money is also used for general cultural funding purposes. In Germany this is even required by law. It acknowledges the purpose of cultural diversity - which is not necessarily identical to free market effects. This funding is usually executed by the same entities (collecting societies) that distribute the levy money to individual authors. One may question however whether these entities are properly qualified to make culture policy.

Levy systems assume that all authors want to exploit their work for money. However this is not always true, especially on the internet. Many authors do not write to entertain, but to inform readers, listeners and viewers. Often their purpose is to reach the widest possible audience rather than make the maximum profit from the copyrighted work by itself. The discrepancy between reality and the assumption underlying a levy system is growing as the World Wide Web matures, with pervasive user-supplied content, from Wikipedia to YouTube.

A further problem is to find a proper tariff base for levies. Conceivably the levy may be a percentage of storage media sales price (e.g. 3% in the US). The implication of such a scheme is however that the author gets ever less as technology proceeds and becomes less expensive. But a price based on units of information (bits, or megabits) is not fair either, as for instance a DVD can be used to store a film, a computer game, a large amount of documents, or measurement data. The cost of producing a certain amount of bits widely varies by type of information. Measurement data is even not copyrighted at all. Yet in today&#x27;s world of converging technology, storage media can be used for a wide range of purposes.

An implementation question that arises is whether the tax applies to any type of copyrighted work or is restricted to a limited field such as music. If it is restricted then the issue arises of how to collect the tax on media which can also be used for other purposes. The options include:

* Collecting the tax on all media, regardless of the end use, and ignoring the injustice to purchasers with non-covered uses.
* Allowing taxed and untaxed media to be sold, but with only the taxed media providing the copyright-relaxation benefits.
* Collecting the tax on all media but allowing purchasers to claim a refund for media applied to non-covered uses.

Contrary Fairness arguments
* Although these complexities make the systems of levies are far from perfect they do have some advantages related to fairness in that since there is compensation for private copying whereas in countries where there is no levies, there is a substantial amount of copying taking place without any due compensation being made.
* With respect to fairness in countries with the levy everyone is shares in the financial burden caused by the levy. In countries that do not have the levy, many people are copying music and never receive any reprimands while others are made an example and prosecuted. This is the similar argument that non-proponents to the levy system use to show fault. They advocate that if the levy cannot be precisely applied to the people that are private copying, it is a faulty system. Likewise, if one cannot reprimand all people that are copying illegally and not compensating the music industry, this is also a faulty system. One system over subscribes, the other undersubscribes, both have faults.
* Finally, those countries that do not have private copying laws are in fact making many of their citizens criminals. A law which makes potentially more than 50% of the population criminals does not seem to be a fair business practice. Lawyers rather than artists may well be the greatest beneficiaries in non-private copying countries. This argument assumes that private copying can only be allowed with a levy.

==Legal effects==
It is theorized that such levy may be linked to a corresponding relaxation of copyright law, by permitting the recording of copyrighted works on media for which the tax has been paid. However, there is little evidence to support this theory. On the contrary, lobbyists representing publishers and copyright holders have increased pressures to implement more restrictive laws, even on countries that have implemented private copying levy. In 2007, it was reported that International Intellectual Property Alliance put 23 of the world&#x27;s 30 most populous countries into Priority Watch List, even though the United States, which was not in the list, has laws that are more liberal than the laws from the countries within the list.

Even when restricting levy system to devices that primarily play music, this itself creates loopholes that prevents collecting levies from cellphones, PDAs, and other all-in-one portable electronic devices. As a result, copyright holders will have to rely on even more laws to collect levy, and to increase rates of already levied product to recover perceived losses, which run against the political trends toward eliminating levy systems.

==Regulations==
Examples of countries operating such schemes:

===Australia===

Australia had a public levy on cassette tapes. The legislation establishing the levy was passed in 1989, challenged in the High Court of Australia in &quot;Australian Tape Manufacturers Association Ltd v Commonwealth&quot;. The court found the tax legal even though it went to private sources because it served a public purpose.

Copyright Amendment Act 1989 (Cth) introduced the Levy on blank tapes but was later repealed by Copyright Amendment (Re-Enactment) Act 1993 following the &quot;blank tapes levy case&quot; in the HCA in 1993.

===Belgium===
In Belgium a fee is charged on both blank media and recording equipment which is passed on to &quot;Auvibel&quot;, which is in charge of distributing the funds. As of 1 February 2010, these fees are applicable for the following:

===Canada===

A blank media levy was introduced in Canada in 1997, by the addition of Part VIII, &quot;Private Copying&quot;, to the Canadian Copyright Act. The power to set rates and to set the distribution allocation is vested in the Copyright Board of Canada. The Copyright Board has handed the task of collecting and distributing the funds to the Canadian Private Copying Collective, which is a non-profit private organization.

In Canada:

* The levy applies to &quot;blank audio recording media&quot;, such as CD-Rs.
* The levy is paid by importers and manufacturers of such media sold within Canada (and typically passed on to the retailer, and passed on to the purchaser).
* With the exception of the zero-rating exemption, the levy is collected regardless of the purchaser&#x27;s end use of the media.
* The private copying levy, less CPCC operating costs, is distributed as per the Copyright Board&#x27;s allocation as: 58.2% to eligible authors and publishers, 23.8% to eligible performers and 18.0% to eligible record companies.
* The Canadian Private Copying Collective has developed a method by which the proceeds are distributed to rights holders based on commercial radio airplay and commercial sales samples, ignoring radio/college airplay and independent record sales not logged by Soundscan. This method has been criticised as favouring major-label artists at the expense of the long-tail. As of September 7, 2007 over one hundred million dollars has been distributed.
* In conjunction with the levy, the Copyright Act allows individuals to make copies of sound recordings for their own private, non-commercial use. They may not distribute the copy.
* In 2005, the Federal Court of Appeal overruled a 2003 Copyright Board decision which had applied the blank media levy to MP3 players such as Apple Inc.&#x27;s iPod, on the basis that such devices did not qualify as &quot;audio recording medium&quot; as per the Copyright Act definition. Before this, the proposed rates were C$2 for players with less than 1 GB of capacity, $15 for players up to 15 GB, and $25 for players 15 GB and over.
*On February 12, 2007, CPCC asked the Copyright Board of Canada to reintroduce the levy of $5 to $75, this time onto the memory component of the digital audio recorders (such as MP3 players) in Canada. In addition, CPCC also proposed levies of $2 to $10 for memory cards (since withdrawn), 8 cent increases to CD, CD-R Audio, CD-RW Audio and MiniDiscs. Certain parties objected to this tariff based on the 2005 Federal Court of Appeal precedent and brought a preliminary motion before the Copyright Board that would have prevented that part of the tariff application from being considered. The Copyright Board dismissed this preliminary motion in July 2007.
*In September 2007, an application for judicial review was brought before the Federal Court of Appeal to appeal the Copyright Board&#x27;s dismissal. On October 26, 2007, the court granted the Canadian Recording Industry Association&#x27;s request to intervene in the private copying/iPod levy judicial review. Some argue that CRIA wanted to limit the scope of the private copying levy, given that it legalizes copying for the private use of the person making the copy, possibly regardless of whether the source is non-infringing or not.
*In January 2008, the Federal Court of Appeal overturned the Copyright Board&#x27;s July 2007 decision, stating that its previous ruling in the 2005 &quot;Canadian Private Copying Collective v. Canadian Storage Media Alliance&quot; case is dispositive authority for the proposition that &quot;the Copyright Board has no legal authority to certify a tariff on digital audio recorders or on the memory permanently embedded in digital audio recorders.&quot;

Canada&#x27;s current private copying levies are as follows: $0.29 per unit for CD-R, CD-RW, CD-R Audio, CD-RW Audio disks. The Pirate Party of Canada, or the PPCA, has called for the scrapping the levy, as there are plenty of non-piracy related uses for CDs and it is unjust to punish Canadians who don&#x27;t use them for these purposes.

===Finland===
Finland had a blank media levy 1984-2015. From 2015 on the funds come directly from the state budget.

As of beginning of 2012, the fees were (in Euros):
* €0.005/min for analog audio tapes (e.g. €0.30 for a 60-minute cassette)
* €0.0076/min for analog video tapes (e.g. €1.37 for an E180 tape)
* €0.20 per disk for CD and MiniDisc (capacity: up to 1 GB)
* €0.60 per disk for DVD, DVD-RAM, DVD-R DL and DVD+R DL (capacity: from 1 GB to 10 GB)
* €1.20 per disk for Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD (capacity: over 10 GB to 25 GB)
* €1.80 per disk for Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD (capacity: over 25 GB)
* €4 to €36 depending on capacity of digital audio players or personal video recorders.
** €4, memory up to 512 MB
** €7, over 512 MB to 1 GB
** €10, over 1 GB to 20 GB
** €12, over 20 GB to 50 GB
** €15, over 50 GB to 150 GB
** €18, over 150 GB to 250 GB
** €25, over 250 GB to 500 GB
** €30, over 500 GB to 750 GB
** €36, over 750 GB
* €5 to €18 for external hard disk drives:
** €9, over 50 GB to 250 GB
** €12, over 250 GB to 1 TB
** €18, over 1TB to 3 TB
** smaller and bigger drives have no levies

There was no levy fee on mobile phones, computers, memory cards, game consoles, USB flash drives and CDs/DVDs. VAT of 9% is added to the levies.

===Germany===

The world&#x27;s first private copying system was created in Germany in 1965. It was a result of earlier successful litigation by GEMA against an audio equipment manufacturer in GEMA v. Grundig.

===Luxembourg===
Luxembourg is the only EU member state on the continent without a private copying levy, making it a popular &quot;copying levy haven&quot; for blank media buyers from countries such as France and Germany.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands a fee is charged on blank media which is passed on to &quot;Stichting Thuiskopie&quot; (Foundation Homecopy), which is in charge of distributing the funds. Fees for January 1, 2021 until December 31, 2023 are as follows:
*PC / Laptop / notebook / server / mediacenter: €2,70
*Tablet: €2,20
*Smartphone: €7,30
*Portable audio- / videoplayer: €2,10
*Settopbox with hard disk / HDD-recorder: €3,80
*E-reader: €1,10
*External Hard Disk Drive (HDD), Solid State Disk (SSD) and USB flash drive &gt;= 256 GB: €1,00
*USB flash drive &lt; 256 GB: €0,50
*Wearables with storage capabilities: €0,60

===Portugal===

Portugal established a levy on CDs and DVDs in 1998.

===Russian Federation===
Article 1245 of Civil Code of Russian Federation &quot;Remuneration for free reproduction of phonograms and audiovisual products for private purposes&quot; (&quot;Вознаграждение за свободное воспроизведение фонограмм и аудиовизуальных произведений в личных целях&quot;) mandates a fee, which is to be distributed in the following proportion: 40% to the authors, 30% to the singers, 30% to the manufacturers of the media. In practice, this fee had not been charged until after the Regulation of the Government of Russian Federation 829 from October 14, 2010, which mandated a uniform 1% tax on computers, blank optical disks, memory sticks, TVs, video and audio recorders, radios, mobile phones, etc. The controversial decision of the government to award the collected funds to the Russian Union of Rights-Holders for further distribution was criticized by the public and disputed in a lawsuit.

===Sweden===
In Sweden there is a fee called &quot;privatkopieringsersättning&quot; (private copy remuneration) earlier called &quot;kassettersättning&quot; (cassette tape remuneration) on storage media. The levy is handled by Copyswede. The extent of what is included in the copy levy has changed several times the past decade. In September 2019 the copy levy looks as follows https://www.copyswede.se/elektronikbranschen/produkter-och-ersattningsnivaer/:

===United States===

====Audio home recording in general====
, as legislated by the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992, says that non-commercial copying by consumers of digital and analog musical recordings is not copyright infringement. Non-commercial includes such things as resale not in the course of business, perhaps of normal use working copies which are no longer wanted. It is unlikely to include resale of copies in bulk; Napster tried to use the Section 1008 defense but was rejected because it was a business.

From House Report No. 102-873(I), September 17, 1992: &quot;In the case of home taping, the [Section 1008] exemption protects all noncommercial copying by consumers of digital and analog musical recordings&quot; .

From House Report No. 102-780(I), August 4, 1992: &quot;In short, the reported legislation [Section 1008] would clearly establish that consumers cannot be sued for making analog or digital audio copies for private noncommercial use&quot;.

The United States music industry administers the Audio Home Recording Act and foreign hometaping royalties for artists on US sound recordings as well as US record labels. These royalties were previously administered by the Alliance of Artists and Recording Companies (AARC) for Featured Artists and Copyright Owners until it ceased operations in 2021 and is now administered by SoundExchange, ASCAP/BMI/SESAC for writers, Harry Fox Agency for publishers, and The AFM/SAG-AFTRA Intellectual Property Rights Distribution Fund (Joint venture of AFM and SAG-AFTRA ) for non-featured artists. All societies also collect foreign remuneration for their respective funds.

====Blank music CDs and recorders====
 bars copyright infringement action and provides for a royalty of 2% of the initial transfer price for devices and 3% for media. The royalty rate in was established by the Fairness in Music Licensing Act of 1998. This only applies to CDs which are labeled and sold for music use; they do not apply to blank computer CDs, even though they can be (and often are) used to record or &quot;burn&quot; music from the computer to CD. The royalty also applies to stand-alone consumer-grade CD recorders, but not to professional CD recorders or CD burners used with computers. Most recently, portable satellite radio recording devices contribute to this royalty fund.

Thanks to a precedent established in a 1998 lawsuit involving the Rio PMP300 player, most MP3 players are deemed &quot;computer peripherals&quot; and are not subject to a royalty of this type in the U.S.

Currently, private copy royalties are generated in the US by the sale of &quot;blank CDs and personal audio devices, media centers, satellite radio devices, and car audio systems that have recording capabilities.&quot;

===United Kingdom===
Currently there is no proper private copy exception in the United Kingdom, there is only a narrow exception regarding broadcast time-shifting (s70(1) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (CDPA)).

On 1 June 2014, the UK implemented art. 5(2)b of the Infosoc Directive via the Copyright and Rights in Performance (Personal Copies for Private Use) Regulations 2014. This provided an exception limited to the personal use, to the owners of a personal copy and with the exclusion of indirectly commercial uses. It did not provide for compensation. The UK Government&#x27;s view was that &quot;levies or other compensation are neither required nor desirable in the context of a narrow provision that causes minimal harm. Levies are an unnecessary and inefficient tax on consumers. They are unfair to consumers in that they are payable regardless of the use to which a levied device (for example a hard disk) is put and regardless of whether a user has already paid for the copies they store on a device. Furthermore, particularly in the current economic climate, it is not right to extract more money from the pockets of hard pressed consumers.&quot; The British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA), the Musicians&#x27; Union, and UK Music challenged the introduction of these regulations, and brought an application for judicial review. Their application succeeded when, in June 2015, the High Court ruled that the regulations were unlawful because of a flawed impact assessment.

<text>Dennis Gabor ( ; , ; 5 June 1900 – 9 February 1979) was a Hungarian-British physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1971 for his invention of holography. He obtained British citizenship in 1946 and spent most of his life in England.

== Life and career ==
Gabor was born as Günszberg Dénes, into a Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary. In 1900, his family converted to Lutheranism. Dennis was the first-born son of Günszberg Bernát and Jakobovits Adél. Despite having a religious background, religion played a minor role in his later life and he considered himself agnostic. In 1902, the family received permission to change their surname from Günszberg to Gábor. He served with the Hungarian artillery in northern Italy during World War I.

He began his studies in engineering at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics in 1918, later in Germany, at the &quot;Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg&quot; in Berlin, now known as Technische Universität Berlin. At the start of his career, he analysed the properties of high voltage electric transmission lines by using cathode-beam oscillographs, which led to his interest in electron optics. Studying the fundamental processes of the oscillograph, Gabor was led to other electron-beam devices such as electron microscopes and TV tubes. He eventually wrote his PhD thesis on Recording of Transients in Electric Circuits with the Cathode Ray Oscillograph in 1927, and worked on plasma lamps.

In 1933 Gabor fled from Nazi Germany, where he was considered Jewish, and was invited to Britain to work at the development department of the British Thomson-Houston company in Rugby, Warwickshire. During his time in Rugby, he met Marjorie Louise Butler, and they married in 1936. He became a British citizen in 1946, and it was while working at British Thomson-Houston in 1947 that he invented holography, based on an electron microscope, and thus electrons instead of visible light. He experimented with a heavily filtered mercury arc light source. The earliest visual hologram was only realised in 1964 following the 1960 invention of the laser, the first coherent light source. After this, holography became commercially available.

Gabor&#x27;s research focused on electron inputs and outputs, which led him to the invention of holography. The basic idea was that for perfect optical imaging, the total of all the information has to be used; not only the amplitude, as in usual optical imaging, but also the phase. In this manner, a complete holo-spatial picture can be obtained. Gabor published his theories of holography in a series of papers between 1946 and 1951.

Gabor also researched how human beings communicate and hear; the result of his investigations was the theory of granular synthesis, although Greek composer Iannis Xenakis claimed that he was actually the first inventor of this synthesis technique. Gabor&#x27;s work in this and related areas was foundational in the development of time–frequency analysis.

In 1948 Gabor moved from Rugby to Imperial College London, and in 1958 became professor of Applied Physics until his retirement in 1967. His inaugural lecture on 3 March 1959, &#x27;Electronic Inventions and their Impact on Civilisation&#x27; provided inspiration for Norbert Wiener&#x27;s treatment of self-reproducing machines in the penultimate chapter in the 1961 edition of his book .

As part of his many developments related to CRTs, in 1958 Gabor patented a new flat screen television concept. This used an electron gun aimed perpendicular to the screen, rather than straight at it. The beam was then directed forward to the screen using a series of fine metal wires on either side of the beam path. The concept was significantly similar to the Aiken tube, introduced in the US the same year. This led to a many-years patent battle which resulted in Aiken keeping the US rights and Gabor the UK. Gabor&#x27;s version was later picked up by Clive Sinclair in the 1970s, and became a decades-long quest to introduce the concept commercially. Its difficult manufacturing, due to the many wires within the vacuum tube, meant this was never successful. While looking for a company willing to try to manufacture it, Sinclair began negotiations with Timex, who instead took over production of the ZX81.

In 1963 Gabor published &quot;Inventing the Future&quot; which discussed the three major threats Gabor saw to modern society: war, overpopulation and the Age of Leisure. The book contained the now well-known expression that &quot;the future cannot be predicted, but futures can be invented.&quot; Reviewer Nigel Calder described his concept as, &quot;His basic approach is that we cannot predict the future, but we can invent it...&quot; Others such as Alan Kay, Peter Drucker, and Forrest Shaklee have used various forms of similar quotes. His next book, &quot;Innovations: scientific, technological, and social&quot; which was published in 1970, expanded on some of the topics he had already earlier touched upon, and also pointed to his interest in technological innovation as mechanism of both liberation and destruction.
In 1971 he was the single recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics with the motivation &quot;for his invention and development of the holographic method&quot; and presented the history of the development of holography from 1948 in his Nobel lecture.

While spending much of his retirement in Italy at Lavinio Rome, he remained connected with Imperial College as a senior research fellow and also became staff scientist of CBS Laboratories, in Stamford, Connecticut; there, he collaborated with his lifelong friend, CBS Labs&#x27; president Dr. Peter C. Goldmark in many new schemes of communication and display. One of Imperial College&#x27;s new halls of residence in Prince&#x27;s Gardens, Knightsbridge is named Gabor Hall in honour of Gabor&#x27;s contribution to Imperial College. He developed an interest in social analysis and published &quot;The Mature Society: a view of the future&quot; in 1972. He also joined the Club of Rome and supervised a working group studying energy sources and technical change. The findings of this group were published in the report &quot;Beyond the Age of Waste&quot; in 1978, a report which was an early warning of several issues that only later received widespread attention.

Following the rapid development of lasers and a wide variety of holographic applications (e.g., art, information storage, and the recognition of patterns), Gabor achieved acknowledged success and worldwide attention during his lifetime. He received numerous awards besides the Nobel Prize.

Gabor died in a nursing home in South Kensington, London, on 9 February 1979. In 2006 a blue plaque was put up on No. 79 Queen&#x27;s Gate in Kensington, where he lived from 1949 until the early 1960s.

<doc id="172889" wikidata="Q2334035" url="?curid=172889" title="History of Statoil (1972–2007)">
<text>Statoil ASA was a Norwegian petroleum company established in 1972. It merged with the oil and gas division of Norsk Hydro in 2007 and was known as StatoilHydro until 2009, when the name was changed back to Statoil ASA. The brand Statoil was retained as a chain of fuel stations owned by StatoilHydro. Statoil was the largest petroleum company in the Nordic countries. In the 2013 Fortune 500, Statoil was ranked as the 39th -largest company in the world. While Statoil was listed on both the Oslo Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange, the Norwegian state still held majority ownership, with 64%. The company&#x27;s headquarters are located in Norway&#x27;s oil capital Stavanger. The name Statoil was a truncated form of &quot;the State&#x27;s oil (company)&quot;.

Statoil was one of the largest net sellers of crude oil in the world, and a major supplier of natural gas to the European continent, Statoil also operated around 2000 service stations in 9 countries. The company&#x27;s CEO from mid-2004 onwards was Helge Lund, formerly CEO of Aker Kværner.

==History==

===Early years===
Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (&quot;Norwegian State Oil Company&quot;) was founded as a private limited company owned by the Government of Norway on 14 July 1972 by a unanimous act passed by the Storting, the Norwegian parliament. The political motivation was Norwegian participation in the oil industry on the continental shelf and to build up Norwegian competency within the petroleum industry to establish the foundations of a domestic petroleum industry. Statoil was required to discuss important issues with the Minister of Industry, later Minister of Petroleum and Energy. Statoil was also required to submit an annual report to the parliament.

In 1973, the company started work acquiring a presence in the petrochemical industry. This resulted in the development of processing plants in Rafsnes and, in partnership with Norsk Hydro, the Mongstad plant in 1980. In 1981 the company acquired, as the first Norwegian company, operator rights on the Norwegian continental shelf on the Gullfaks field. 1987–88 saw the largest scandal in the companies history, the Mongstad scandal that made the until then unassailable CEO Arve Johnsen withdraw.

===Privatization===
The company was privatised and made a public limited company (allmennaksjeselskap) in 2001, becoming listed on both the Oslo Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. At the same time it changed its name to Statoil ASA.

===Merger with Hydro===

In December 2006 Statoil revealed a proposal to merge with the oil business of Norsk Hydro, a Norwegian conglomerate. Under the rules of the EEA the proposal was approved by the European Union on 3 May 2007 and by the Norwegian Parliament on 8 June 2007. Former Statoil&#x27;s shareholders hold 67.3% of the new company StatoilHydro, which started operations on 1 October 2007. The company is the biggest offshore oil and gas company in the world.

In November 2009, StatoilHydro changed its name to simply Statoil, following a prolonged name debate that sparked considerable public interest.

==Environmental record==
Statoil had three oil spills in Arctic waters near Norway. All the spills occurred from its ocean rig called the Erik Raude. The company was searching for oil in the region, which environmentalists were against because they wanted the sensitive area free from pollution. However, the Norwegian government allowed oil exploration, as long as there were no emissions. After the merger to StatoilHydro, in December 2007, of oil leaked into the North Sea. This was Statoil&#x27;s 2nd worst oil spill. Two leaks also occurred in February 2008. In March, Statoil dropped about 1.6 tons of pure hydraulic oil in the Barents Sea. Hydraulic oil is said to be the 2nd most hazardous pollutant. Since the leaks, Statoil has stated that the oil has mostly dissolved, and there is not much proof of ecological harm. The Norwegian government has not stopped the oil drilling in the Arctic waters, and Statoil started up its oil operations in April 2005. Bellona, a Norwegian environmental group, is looking to take legal action. They want the end of oil drilling in the Barents Sea.

==Controversy and corruption==

===Rotvoll controversy===

In 1991 there arose a controversy between Statoil and local environmentalists, mainly from Natur og Ungdom and Friends of the Earth Norway, who protested the building of a new research and development centre at Rotvoll in Trondheim, Norway, wetlands area close to the city with significant bird life. The controversy was climaxed with civil disobedience by the environmentalists, but the centre was still built.

===Statoil corruption case===
The Statoil corruption case refers to the company&#x27;s misconduct and use of corruption in Iran in 2002/2003 in an attempt to secure lucrative oil contracts in that country. This was mainly achieved by hiring the services of Horton Investments, an Iranian consultancy firm owned by Mehdi Hashemi Rafsanjani, son of former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani. Horton Investments was paid US$15.2 million by Statoil to influence important political figures in Iran to grant oil contracts to Statoil. The corruption scandal was uncovered by Norwegian paper Dagens Næringsliv on 3 September 2003.

===Corrib gas project===

Statoil was a partner of Royal Dutch Shell in the Corrib gas project, which entails developing a natural gas field off the west of Ireland. The project has proved controversial. In the summer of 2005, five men from County Mayo were jailed for contempt of court after refusing to obey a temporary court injunction forbidding them to interfere with work being undertaken on their land. The ensuing protests led to the Shell to Sea campaign that opposes the project.

<doc id="172890" wikidata="Q854062" url="?curid=172890" title="Wusun">
<text>The Wusun ( ) were an ancient semi-nomadic steppe people mentioned in Chinese records from the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD.

The Wusun originally lived between the Qilian Mountains and Dunhuang (Gansu) near the Yuezhi. Around 176 BC the Xiongnu raided the lands of the Yuezhi, who subsequently attacked the Wusun, killing their king and seizing their land. The Xiongnu adopted the surviving Wusun prince and made him one of their generals and leader of the Wusun. Around 162 BC the Yuezhi were driven into the Ili River valley in Zhetysu, Dzungaria and Tian Shan, which had formerly been inhabited by the Saka. The Wusun then resettled in Gansu as vassals of the Xiongnu. In 133–132 BC, the Wusun drove the Yuezhi out of the Ili Valley and settled the area.

The Wusun then became close allies of the Han dynasty and remained a powerful force in the region for several centuries. The Wusun are last mentioned by the Chinese as having settled in the Pamir Mountains in the 5th century AD due to pressure from the Rouran. They possibly became subsumed into the later Hephthalites.

==Etymology==
&quot;Wusun&quot; is a modern pronunciation of the Chinese Characters &#x27;烏孫&#x27;. The Chinese name &#x27;烏孫&#x27; (Wūsūn) literally means &quot;wū&quot; &#x27;crow, raven&#x27; + &quot;sūn&quot; &#x27;grandson, descendant&#x27;. There are several theories about the origin of the name.

Canadian Sinologist Edwin Pulleyblank reconstructed the pronunciation of 烏孫&#x27; Wūsūn as in Middle Chinese as &quot;ou-suən&quot;, from Old Chinese &quot;aĥ-smən&quot; and linked the Wusun to the Άσμίραιοι &quot;Asmiraioi&quot;, who inhabited modern Issyk-Kul and Semirechiye and were mentioned in Ptolemy&#x27;s Geography (VI.16.3). Another theory links them to the Issedones.

Sinologist Victor H. Mair compared &quot;Wusun&quot; with Sanskrit &quot;áśva&quot; &#x27;horse&#x27;, &quot;aśvin&quot; &#x27;mare&#x27; and Lithuanian &quot;ašvà&quot; &#x27;mare&#x27;. The name would thus mean &#x27;the horse people&#x27;. Hence he put forward the hypothesis that the Wusun used a satem-like language within the Indo-European languages. However, the latter hypothesis is not supported by Edwin G. Pulleyblank. Christopher I. Beckwith&#x27;s analysis is similar to Mair&#x27;s, reconstructing the Chinese term Wusun as Old Chinese *&quot;âswin&quot;, which he compares to Old Indic &quot;aśvin&quot; &#x27;the horsemen&#x27;, the name of the Rigvedic twin equestrian gods.

Étienne de la Vaissière identifies the Wusun with the &quot;wδ&#x27;nn&#x27;p&quot;, mentioned on Kultobe inscriptions as enemies of the Sogdian-speaking Kangju confederation. &quot;Wδ&#x27;nn&#x27;p&quot; contains two morphemes &quot;n&#x27;p&quot; &quot;people&quot; and *&quot;wδ&#x27;n&quot; [wiðan], which is cognate with Manichaean Parthian &quot;wd&#x27;n&quot; and means &quot;tent&quot;. Vaissière hypothesized that the Wusun likely spoke an Iranian language closely related to Sogdian, permitting Sogdians to translate their endonym as *&quot;wδ&#x27;n&quot; [wiðan] and Chinese to transcribe their endonym with a native Chinese /s/ standing for a foreign dental fricative. Therefore, Vaissière reconstructs Wusun&#x27;s endonym as *&quot;Wəθan&quot; &quot;[People of the] Tent(s)&quot;.

==History==

===Early history===
The Wusun were first mentioned by Chinese sources as living together with the Yuezhi between the Qilian Mountains and Dunhuang (Gansu). although different locations have been suggested for these toponyms.

Beckwith suggests that the Wusun were an eastern remnant of the Indo-Aryans, who had been suddenly pushed to the extremities of the Eurasian Steppe by the Iranian peoples in the 2nd millennium BC.

Around 210–200 BC, prince Modu Chanyu, a former hostage of the Yuezhi and prince of the Xiongnu, who were also vassals of the Yuezhi, became leader of the Xiongnu and conquered the Mongolian Plain, subjugating several peoples. Around 176 BC Modu Chanyu launched a fierce raid against the Yuezhi. Around 173 BC, the Yuezhi subsequently attacked the Wusun, at that time a small nation, killing their king (Kunmi or Kunmo ) Nandoumi ().

According to legend Nandoumi&#x27;s infant son Liejiaomi was left in the wild. He was miraculously saved from hunger being suckled by a she-wolf, and fed meat by ravens. The Wusun ancestor myth shares striking similarities with those of the Hittites, the Zhou Chinese, the Scythians, the Romans, the Goguryeo, Turks, Mongols and Dzungars. Based on the similarities between the ancestor myth of the Wusun and later Turkic peoples, Denis Sinor has suggested that the Wusun, Sogdians, or both could represent an Indo-Aryan influence, or even the origin of the royal Ashina Türks.

In 162 BC, the Yuezhi were finally defeated by the Xiongnu, after which they fled Gansu. According to Zhang Qian, the Yuezhi were defeated by the rising Xiongnu empire and fled westward, driving away the Sai (Scythians) from the Ili Valley in the Zhetysu and Dzungaria area. The Sai would subsequently migrate into South Asia, where they founded various Indo-Scythian kingdoms. After the Yuezhi retreat the Wusun subsequently settled the modern province of Gansu, in the valley of the &quot;Wushui-he&quot; (lit. &quot;Raven-Water River&quot;), as vassals of the Xiongnu. It is not clear whether the river was named after the tribe or vice versa.

===Migration to the Ili Valley===
The Xiongnu ruler was impressed with Liejiaomi, considering him a supernatural being, and adopted the child. When the child grew up the Chanyu made him leader of the Wusun and a Xiongnu general. He won many victories for the Xiongnu and the Wusun became powerful. Liejiaomi constantly requested the Xiongnu ruler for permission to avenge his father, and around 133–132 BC, he successfully attacked the Yuezhi in the Ili Valley. The Yuezhi then migrated to Sogdia and then Bactria, where they became unified under Kujula Kadphises and expanded into South Asia, founding the Kushan Empire, which at its peak under Kanishka stretched from Turpan in the Tarim Basin to Pataliputra on the Gangetic plain and played an important role in the development of the Silk Road and the transmission of Buddhism to China.

The Wusun subsequently took over the Ili Valley, expanding over a large area and trying to keep away from the Xiongnu. According to Shiji, Wusun was a state located west of the Xiongnu. When the Xiongnu ruler died, Liejiaomi refused to serve the Xiongnu. The Xiongnu then sent a force against the Wusun but were defeated, after which the Xiongnu even more than before considered Liejiaomi a supernatural being, avoiding conflict with him.

===Establishing relations with the Han===

After settling in the Ili Valley the Wusun became so strong that the Han was compelled to win their friendship in alliance. Chinese sources name the Scythian &quot;Sai&quot; (Saka), and the &quot;Yuezhi&quot; who are often identified as Tocharians, among the people of the Wusun state in the Zhetysu and Dzungaria area. The Wusun realm probably included both Yuezhi and Saka. It is clear that the majority of the population consisted of linguistically Iranian Saka tribes.

In 125 BC, under the Han Emperor Wu of Han (156–87 BC), the Chinese traveller and diplomat Zhang Qian was sent to establish an alliance with the Wusun Against the Xiongnu. Qian estimated the Wusun to number 630,000, with 120,000 families and 188,000 men capable of bearing arms. Hanshu described them as occupying land that previously belonged to the Saka (Sai). To their north-west the Wusun bordered Kangju, located in modern Kazakhstan. To the west was Dayuan (Ferghana), and to the south were various city states. The Royal Court of the Wusun, the walled city of Chigu (), was located in a side valley leading to Issyk Kul. Lying on one of the branches of the Silk Road Chigu was an important trading centre, but its exact location has not been established.

According to Sima Qian in the &quot;Shiji&quot;:

The Wusun approved of a possible alliance, and Zhang Qian was sent as ambassador in 115 BC. According to the agreement the Wusun would jointly attack the Xiongnu with the Han, while they were offered a Han princess in marriage and the return of their original Gansu homeland (heqin). Due to fear of the Xiongnu, the Wusun however had second thoughts and suggested sending a delegation to the Han rather than moving their capital further west.

===As Han allies===
Some time after the Han-Wusun negotiations had ended, the Han inflicted several blows to the Xiongnu. The Han then threatened war upon the Wusun, after which Liejiaomi finally agreed to an alliance, sending tributary horses and accepting Princess Xijun as his wife. Along with the Yuezhi and the Kangju of the Ferghana Valley, the Wusun became the main suppliers of horses for the Han. The Xiongnu had however also sent a princess to marry Liejiaomi, and the Xiongnu princess was declared his senior consort, with Xijun becoming his junior wife. Since Liejiaomi was already an old man, Xijun was however married to his successor Cenzou (), to which Wu agreed. Xijun wrote a famous poem, the &quot;Beichouge&quot; (), in which she complains about her exile in the land of the &quot;barbarians&quot;:

Xijun bore the Wusun a daughter but died soon afterward, at which point the Han court sent Princess Jieyou () to succeed her. After the death of Cenzou, Jieyou married Wengguimi (), Cenzou&#x27;s cousin and successor. Jieyou lived for fifty years among the Wusun and bore five children, including the oldest Yuanguimi (), whose half-brother Wujiutu () was born to a Xiongnu mother. She sent numerous letters to the Han requesting assistance against the Xiongnu.

Around 80 BC, the Wusun were attacked by the Xiongnu, who inflicted a devastating defeat upon them. In 72 BC, Kunmi, chief of the Wusun requested assistance from the Han against the Xiongnu. The Han sent an army of 160,000 men, inflicting a crushing defeat upon the Xiongnu, capturing much booty and many slaves. In the campaign the Han captured the Tarim Basin city-state of Cheshi (Turpan region), a previous ally of the Xiongnu, giving them direct contact with the Wusun. Afterwards the Wusun allied with the Dingling and Wuhuan to counter Xiongnu attacks. After their crushing victory against the Xiongnu the Wusun increased in strength, achieving significant influence over the city-states of the Tarim Basin. The son of the Kunmi became the ruler of Yarkand, while his daughter became the wife of the lord of Kucha. They came to play a role as a third force between the Han and the Xiongnu.

Around 64 BC, according to Hanshu, Chinese agents were involved in a plot with a Wusun kunmi known as Wengguimi (&quot;Fat King&quot;), to kill a Wusun kunmi known to the Chinese as Nimi (&quot;Mad King&quot;). A Chinese deputy envoy called Chi Tu who brought a doctor to attend to Nimi was punished by castration by the Han dynasty when he returned to China for treating the mad king&#x27;s illness instead of killing him which the Han court ordered them to do.

In 64 BC another Han princess was sent to Kunmi Wengguimi, but he died before her arrival. Han emperor Xuan then permitted the princess to return, since Jieyou had married the new Kunmi, Nimi (), the son of Cenzou. Jieyou bore Nimi the son Chimi (). Prince Wujiutu later killed Nimi, his half-brother. Fearing the wrath of the Han, Wujiutu adopted the title of Lesser Kunmi, while Yuanguimi was given the title Greater Kunmi. The Han accepted this system and bestowed both of them with the imperial seal. After both Yuanguimi and Chimi were dead, Jieyou asked Emperor Xuan for permission to return to China. She died in 49 BC. Over the next decades the institution of Greater and Lesser Kunmi continued, with the Lesser Kunmi being married to a Xiongnu princess and the Greater Kunmi married to a Han princess.

In 5 BC, during the reign of Wuzhuliu Chanyu (8 BCAD 13), the Wusun attempted to raid Yueban pastures, but Wuzhuliu repulsed them, and the Wusun commander had to send his son to the Yueban court as a hostage. The forceful intervention of the Chinese usurper Wang Mang and internal strife brought disorder, and in 2 BC one of the Wusun chieftains brought 80,000 Wusun to Kangju, asking for help against the Chinese. In a vain attempt to reconcile with China, he was duped and killed in 3 AD.

In 2 AD, Wang Mang issued a list of four regulations to the allied Xiongnu that the taking of any hostages from Chinese vassals, i.e. Wusun, Wuhuan and the statelets of the Western Regions, would not be tolerated.

In 74 AD the Wusun are recorded as having sent tribute to the Han military commanders in Cheshi. In 80 AD Ban Chao requested assistance from the Wusun against the city-state Quchi (Kucha) in the Tarim Basin. The Wusun were subsequently rewarded with silks, while diplomatic exchanges were resumed. During the 2nd century AD the Wusun continued their decline in political importance.

===Later history===

In the 5th century AD the Wusun were pressured by the Rouran and may have migrated to the Pamir Mountains. They are last mentioned in Chinese historical sources in 436 AD, when a Chinese envoy was sent to their country and the Wusun reciprocated. It is possible that they became subsumed into the later Hephthalites. After this event the Wusun seem to disappear from Chinese records: Wusun were last mentioned in 938 AD alongsides Tuyuhun and Mohe, as tributary states to the Khitan Liao.

==Physical appearance==

The &quot;Hanshu&quot; and &quot;Shiji&quot; do not make any special note of the physical appearance of the Wusun. The first description of the Wusun&#x27;s physical appearance is found in a Western Han dynasty book of divination, the &quot;Jiaoshi Yilin&quot;, which describes the women of the Wusun as &quot;with deep eyesockets, dark, ugly: their preferences are different, past their prime [still] without spouse.&quot; A later 7th century commentary to the Hanshu by Yan Shigu says:

Initially, when only a few number of skulls from Wusun territory were known, the Wusun were recognized as a Caucasoid people with slight Mongoloid admixture. Later, in a more thorough study by Soviet archaeologists of eighty-seven skulls of Zhetysu, the six skulls of the Wusun period were determined to be purely Caucasoid or close to it.

==Language==

The Wusun are generally believed to be an Indo-European people and speak a language belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch. They are thought to be Iranian-speaking by the archaeologist Elena Kuzmina, linguist János Harmatta, Joseph Kitagawa, David Durand-Guédy, Turkologist Peter B. Golden and Central Asian scholar Denis Sinor. Yan Shigu (581–645) described the Wusun&#x27;s descendants with the exonym &quot;Húrén&quot; &quot;foreigners, barbarians&quot;, which had been used since the 6th century to denote Iranian peoples, especially Sogdians, in Central Asia, besides other non-Chinese peoples. Archaeological evidence also supports the idea that Wusuns were Iranian speakers.

Edwin G. Pulleyblank has suggested that the Wusun, along with the Yuezhi, the Dayuan, the Kangju and the people of Yanqi, could have been Tocharian-speaking. Colin Masica and David Keightley also suggest that the Wusun were Tocharian-speaking. Sinor finds it difficult to include the Wusun within the Tocharian category of Indo-European until further research. J. P. Mallory has suggested that the Wusun contained both Tocharian and Iranian elements. Central Asian scholar Christopher I. Beckwith suggests that the Wusun were Indo-Aryan-speaking. The first syllable of the Wusun royal title Kunmi was probably the royal title while the second syllable referred to the royal family name. Beckwith specifically suggests an Indo-Aryan etymology of the title Kunmi.

In the past, some scholars suggested that the Wusun spoke a Turkic language. Chinese scholar Han Rulin, as well as Ármin Vámbéry, A. Scherbak, P. Budberg, L. Bazin and V.P. Yudin, noted that the Wusun king&#x27;s name &quot;Fu-li&quot; 拊離 (OC (20 BC) &gt; LHC ), as reported in Chinese sources and translated as &#x27;wolf&#x27;, resembles Proto-Turkic *&quot;bȫrü&quot; &#x27;wolf&#x27;. This suggestion however is rejected by Classical Chinese Literature expert Francis K. H. So, Professor at National Sun Yat-sen University. Other words listed by these scholars include the title &quot;bag&quot;, &quot;beg&quot; &#x27;lord&#x27;. This theory has been criticized by modern Turkologists, including Peter B. Golden and Carter V. Findley, who explain that none of the mentioned words are actually Turkic in origin. Findley notes that the term &quot;böri&quot; is probably derived from one of the Iranian languages of Central Asia (cf. Khotanese &quot;birgga-&quot;). Meanwhile, Findley considers the title &quot;beg&quot; as certainly derived from the Sogdian &quot;baga&quot; &#x27;lord&#x27;, a cognate of Middle Persian &quot;baγ&quot; (as used by the rulers of the Sassanid Empire), as well as Sanskrit &quot;bhaga&quot; and Russian &quot;bog&quot;. According to Encyclopædia Iranica: &quot;The origin of beg is still disputed, though it is mostly agreed that it is a loan-word. Two principal etymologies have been proposed. The first etymology is from a Middle Iranian form of Old Iranian &quot;baga&quot;; though the meaning would fit since the Middle Persian forms of the word often mean &#x27;lord,&#x27; used of the king or others. The second etymology is from Chinese 伯 (MC &quot;pˠæk̚&quot; &gt; &quot;bó&quot;) &#x27;eldest (brother), (feudal) lord&#x27;. Gerhard Doerfer on the other hand seriously considers the possibility that the word is genuinely Turkish. Whatever the truth may be, there is no connection with Turkish &quot;berk&quot;, Mongolian &quot;berke&quot; &#x27;strong&#x27; or Turkish &quot;bögü&quot;, Mongolian &quot;böge&quot; &#x27;wizard, shaman.&#x27;&quot;

==Economy==
According to the &quot;Shiji&quot; (c. 123) and the &quot;Hanshu&quot; (c. 96), Liu Xijun, a daughter of the Han prince Liu Jian, was sent to the ruler (Kunmi or Kunmo) of the Wusun between 110 BC and 105 BC. She describes them as nomads who lived in felt tents, ate raw meat and drank fermented mare&#x27;s milk. Some early Chinese descriptions of the people were pejorative, describing them as &quot;bad, greedy and unreliable, and much given to robbery&quot;, but their state was also described as very strong. However, the Wusun were also noted for their harmony towards their neighbours, even though they were constantly raided by the Xiongnu and Kangju.

The principal activity of the Wusun was cattle-raising, but they also practiced agriculture. Since the climate of Zhetysu and Dzungaria did not allow constant wandering, they probably wandered with each change of season in the search of pasture and water. Numerous archaeological finds have found querns and agricultural implements and bones of domesticated animals, suggesting a semi-nomadic pastoral economy.

==Social structure==
The social structure of the Wusun resembled that of the Xiongnu. They were governed by the Great Kunmi, whose power was hereditary. The Great Kunmi and his two sons, who commanded the east and left flanks of the Wusun realm, each commanded a force of 10,000 men. The Wusun also fielded a regular army, with each freeman being considered a warrior. Their administrative apparatus was fairly sophisticated, consisting of sixteen officials. The Great Kunmi was assisted by a council of elders, which limited his power to some degree. The Wusun elite maintained itself through tribute from conquered tribes, war booty and trading profits. The booty acquired by the Wusun in their frequent conflicts enabled the administrative elite and members of the Kunmi&#x27;s guard to amass enormous riches.

Wusun society seems to have been highly stratified. The main source of this stratification seems to have been property ownership. The wealthiest Wusuns are believed to have owned as many as 4,000 to 5,000 horses, and there is evidence pointing to privileged use of certain pastures. Typical of early patriarchal stratified societies, Wusun widows were obliged to remain within the family of their late husband by marrying one of his relatives, a concept known as levirate marriage. Y. A. Zadneprovskiy writes that the social inequality among the Wusun created social unrest among the lower strata. Wusun society also included many slaves, mostly prisoners of war. The Wusun are reported as having captured 10,000 slaves in a raid against the Xiongnu. Wusun slaves mainly laboured as servants and craftsmen, although the freemen formed the core of the Wusun economy.

==Archaeology==
Numerous sites belonging to the Wusun period in Zhetysu and the Tian Shan have been excavated. Most of the cemeteries are burial grounds with the dead interred in pit-graves, referred to as the Chil-pek group, which probably belong the local Saka population. A second group of kurgans with burials in lined &quot;catacomb&quot; chamber graves, of the so-called Aygîrdzhal group, are found together with the Chil-pek tombs from the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD, and have been attributed to the Yuezhi. Graves of the Wusun period typically contain personal belongings, with the burials of the Aygîrdzhal group often containing weapons.

A famous find is the Kargali burial of a female Shaman discovered at an altitude of 2,300 m, near Almaty, containing jewellery, clothing, head-dress and nearly 300 gold objects. A beautiful diadem of the Kargali burial attest to the artistic skill of these ancient jewellers. Another find at Tenlik in eastern Zhetysu contained the grave of a high-ranking warrior, whose clothing had been decorated with around 100 golden bosses.

==Connection to Western histography==
Some scholars such as Peter B. Golden have proposed that the Wusun may have been identical with the people described by Herodotus (IV. 16–25) and in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; as Issedones (also &quot;Issedoni&quot;, &quot;Issedoi&quot; or &quot;Essedoni&quot;). Their exact location of their country in Central Asia is unknown. The Issedones are &quot;placed by some in Western Siberia and by others in Chinese Turkestan,&quot; according to E. D. Phillips.

French historian Iaroslav Lebedynsky suggests that the Wusun may have been the Asii of &quot;Geographica&quot;.

==Genetics==
A genetic study published in &quot;Nature&quot; in May 2018 examined the remains of four Wusun buried between 300 BC and 100 BC. The sample of Y-DNA extracted belonged to haplogroup R1. The samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to C4a1, HV6, J1c5a and U5b2c. The authors of the study found that the Wusun and Kangju had less East Asian admixture than the Xiongnu and the Saka. Both the Wusun and Kangju were suggested to be descended from Western Steppe Herders (WSHs) of the Late Bronze Age who admixed with Siberian hunter-gatherers and peoples related to the Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex.

One theory has suggested that the Uissun tribe of Kazakhstan is descended from the Wusun, based on the superficial similarity of the ethnonym &#x27;Uissun&#x27; to Wusun. A 2020 study could not find support for this theory, as the Uissun have a very low frequency of Haplogroup R1a (6%), most of it belonging to the Z94 clade rather than the Iranian Z93 clade. Most of the Uissun lineages were typical of Mongols, supporting their historically attested Mongolian origin.

<text>Kjell Magne Bondevik (; born 3 September 1947) is a Norwegian Lutheran minister and politician. As leader of the Christian Democratic Party, he served as the prime minister of Norway from 1997 to 2000, and from 2001 to 2005, making him, after Erna Solberg, Norway&#x27;s second longest serving non-Labour Party prime minister since World War II. Currently, Bondevik is president of the Oslo Centre for Peace and Human Rights.

== Family and early life ==
Bondevik was born in Molde, the son of Johannes Bondevik, a principal at the Christian folk high school Rauma folkehøyskole who also was a local politician for the Christian Democratic Party, and Margit, née Hæreid. He became a theological candidate from MF Norwegian School of Theology in 1975. As Bondevik was active in Norwegian politics at a young age, he did not serve in the military. In 1979, he was ordained as pastor in the (Lutheran) Church of Norway.

He is married to Bjørg Bondevik (née Rasmussen) and has three children: Bjørn (born 1972), Hildegunn (born 1973), and John Harald (born 1976). Kjell Magne Bondevik is the nephew of politician Kjell Bondevik, the cousin of former bishop Odd Bondevik and brother in law of author and priest Eyvind Skeie.

==Political career==

In 2008, Bondevik said that he regards himself as a &quot;68&#x27;er&quot;, and that he was &quot;influenced by the radical wind of the time&quot;. While he remained in the movement of Young Christian Democrats (Norway, KrFU), he claims to have &quot;radicalized the organization to great despair in the party&quot;. He has also said that he would likely rather have &quot;oriented&quot; himself towards the Socialist People&#x27;s Party, had his radicalization of the Christian Democratic Party not gone through.

Representing the Christian Democratic Party, Bondevik was a member of the Storting (Parliament) from 1973 to 2005. He was his party&#x27;s parliamentary leader in the periods of 1981–1983, 1986–1989, 1993–1997, 1997, and 2000–2001, and party leader from 1983 to 1995. In this position, he was succeeded by Valgerd Svarstad Haugland. He was also Minister of Foreign Affairs in Jan P. Syse&#x27;s government of 1989–1990, Minister of Church and Education in Kåre Willoch&#x27;s government 1983–1986, also Prime Minister Willoch&#x27;s deputy 1985–1986, and state secretary at the Office of the Prime Minister during Lars Korvald&#x27;s government 1972–1973.

=== As Prime Minister=== 

Bondevik&#x27;s first term as prime minister lasted from 17 October 1997 to 3 March 2000, in a coalition cabinet consisting of the Christian Democratic Party, the Centre Party and the Liberal Party.

While serving his first term as prime minister, Bondevik attracted international attention in August 1998 when he announced that he was suffering from depressive episode, becoming the highest ranking world leader to admit to suffering from a mental illness while in office. Upon this revelation, Anne Enger became acting prime minister for three weeks, from 30 August to 23 September, while he recovered from the depressive episode. Bondevik then returned to office. Bondevik received thousands of supportive letters, and said that the experience had been positive overall, both for himself and because it made mental illness more publicly acceptable.

Bondevik&#x27;s first cabinet resigned after losing a confidence vote in March 2000 as a result of a dispute over the construction of gas-fired power stations and was replaced by a Labour Party government led by Jens Stoltenberg until their defeat in the 2001 parliamentary election. Bondevik then formed his second cabinet, consisting of the Christian Democratic Party, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party, which took office on 19 October 2001.

The second Bondevik government carried out reforms and left a booming economy; however, Bondevik was defeated in the 2005 parliamentary election, with 81 seats obtained for Bondevik&#x27;s coalition and its supporters to the opposition Red-Green Coalition&#x27;s 88.

Bondevik announced his retirement from national-level politics at the end of his term as prime minister, and did not seek re-election for his seat in parliament.

==Post-premiership==

The Oslo Centre for Peace and Human Rights was founded by Bondevik in January 2006. The purpose of the centre is to work for world peace, human rights and inter-religious tolerance worldwide. The centre cooperates closely with the Carter Center in Atlanta, the Kim Dae Jung Library in Seoul and the Crisis Management Initiative in Helsinki.

On 31 October 2006, he published his memoir, called &quot;Et liv i spenning&quot; (&quot;A life of excitement and tension&quot;).

On 31 January 2017, he was the first high-ranking politician from another country detained and questioned in the United States as a result of President Donald Trump&#x27;s executive orders banning immigration from seven predominantly Muslim nations, because of a diplomatic visit to Iran he had made in 2014.

In 2022, it was revealed that Bondevik had published a glowing appraisal of Kazakhstan in the Norwegian daily newspaper &quot;Vårt Land&quot; after receiving cash payments from the government of Kazakhstan.

Earlier, in 2021, the Norwegian newspaper &quot;Dagbladet&quot; had revealed that one of Bondevik&#x27;s colleagues, the Conservative Party politician Aamir J. Sheikh, had requested a cash payment of 704,000 NOK from the government of Bahrain in an e-mail, with Bondevik as one of the carbon-copied (CC) recipients. &quot;A month later, Bondevik and Sheikh handed out an &#x27;honorary prize&#x27; to representatives of Bahrain&#x27;s prime minister,&quot; the newspaper wrote.

==Awards and decorations==
Bondevik was awarded the Grand Cross of St. Olav in 2004, the first sitting Norwegian Prime Minister to receive the Order of St. Olav in 80 years. The award happened due to a change in the Statutes of the Order with automatic awards to the prime minister and Ministers of the Government that stirred some debate and criticism. With the succeeding Stoltenberg Government, the practice was halted.

He is a full member of the Club de Madrid, a group of former leaders of democratic states that works to strengthen democratic governance and leadership.

Bondevik is an Honorary Member of The International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation.

In 2009, Bondevik was awarded an honorary degree from the University of San Francisco.

<text>Bob Kerr&#x27;s Whoopee Band, also billed as Bob Kerr and His Whoopee Band, is a jazz band which started in 1967 and continues to perform today. It was an offshoot of the eclectic Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, and shared many similarities with other outfits of the time such as The New Vaudeville Band and The Temperance Seven. Founder Bob Kerr had been a member of both the Bonzos and the New Vaudeville Band.

==Membership==
Started in 1967, by 1971, for the album &quot;Making Whoopee&quot;, the band&#x27;s membership consisted of Bob Kerr, Vernon Dudley Bowhay Nowell, Sam Spoons, James Chambers, John &quot;Evil Gieves&quot; Watson, Biff Harrison, Franklin Tomes and David Glasson. Kerr, Nowell and Spoons had all been members of the Bonzo Dog Band.

In 1976, for the album &quot;The Whoopee Band&quot;, the membership consisted of Evil John Gieves Watson (banjo), Vernon Dudley Bowhay Nowell (tenor banjo), Biff Harrison, David Glasson (piano), Jim &quot;Golden Boots&quot; Chambers, and Bob Kerr.

For an August 1977 gig, the membership consisted of Bob Kerr (trumpet, trombone), Vernon Dudley Bowhay-Nowell (banjo), &quot;Gentleman Frankie&quot; Tooms (sousaphone), Sam Spoons (drums), &quot;Evil John&quot; Gieves Watson (banjo), Biff Harrison (clarinet, saxophone), Jim &quot;Golden Boots&quot; Chambers (saxophone), and David &quot;Mr. Piano&quot; Glasson (piano).

In 1978, for the &quot;Hard Pressed&quot; album, the membership consisted of Bob Kerr (cornet), Jim &quot;Golden Boots&quot; Chambers (alto sax), Vernon Dudley Bowhay Nowell (tenor banjo), &quot;Evil&quot; John Gieves Watson, Biff Harrison, David Glasson (piano), Sam Spoons (drums) and Frank Tooms.

In 1981, for the &quot;Things That Go Bump in the Mike&quot; album, the membership consisted of Bob Kerr, Jim Chambers, Vernon Dudley Bowhay Nowell, Biff Harrison, Sam Spoons, Hugh Crozier (piano) and Frank Tooms.

Two years later, the band split with Biff Harrison, Sam Spoons, Jim Chambers and John Gieves Watson moving off to the Bill Posters Will Be Band. This band continued with Megs Etherington and another former Whoopee member, Peter Shade.

By the time of a 1987 performance in Germany, the Whoopee Band consisted of Bob Kerr - tuba, Vernon Dudley Bowhay-Nowell - banjo, Richard White - clarinet, Hugh Crozier - piano, Frank Tomes - sousaphone and Colin Bowden - drums

Members of Bob Kerr&#x27;s Whoopee Band are Bob Kerr, John &quot;The Professor&quot; Percival, Malcolm Sked, Bert Lamb and Henri Harrison.

<doc id="172896" wikidata="Q155887" url="?curid=172896" title="L. E. J. Brouwer">
<text>Luitzen Egbertus Jan &quot;Bertus&quot; Brouwer (27 February 1881 – 2 December 1966) was a Dutch mathematician and philosopher who worked in topology, set theory, measure theory and complex analysis. Regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century, he is known as one of the founders of modern topology, particularly for establishing his fixed-point theorem and the topological invariance of dimension.

Brouwer also became a major figure in the philosophy of intuitionism, a constructivist school of mathematics which argues that math is a cognitive construct rather than a type of objective truth. This position led to the Brouwer–Hilbert controversy, in which Brouwer sparred with his formalist colleague David Hilbert. Brouwer&#x27;s ideas were subsequently taken up by his student Arend Heyting and Hilbert&#x27;s former student Hermann Weyl. In addition to his mathematical work, Brouwer also published the short philosophical tract &quot;Life, Art, and Mysticism&quot; (1905).

==Biography==
Brouwer was born to Dutch Protestant parents. Early in his career, Brouwer proved a number of theorems in the emerging field of topology. The most important were his fixed point theorem, the topological invariance of degree, and the topological invariance of dimension. Among mathematicians generally, the best known is the first one, usually referred to now as the Brouwer fixed point theorem. It is a corollary to the second, concerning the topological invariance of degree, which is the best known among algebraic topologists. The third theorem is perhaps the hardest.

Brouwer also proved the simplicial approximation theorem in the foundations of algebraic topology, which justifies the reduction to combinatorial terms, after sufficient subdivision of simplicial complexes, of the treatment of general continuous mappings. In 1912, at age 31, he was elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1908 at Rome and in 1912 at Cambridge, UK. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1943.

Brouwer founded intuitionism, a philosophy of mathematics that challenged the then-prevailing formalism of David Hilbert and his collaborators, who included Paul Bernays, Wilhelm Ackermann, and John von Neumann (cf. Kleene (1952), p. 46–59). A variety of constructive mathematics, intuitionism is a philosophy of the foundations of mathematics. It is sometimes (simplistically) characterized by saying that its adherents do not admit the law of excluded middle as a general axiom in mathematical reasoning, although it may be proven as a theorem in some special cases.

Brouwer was a member of the Significs Group. It formed part of the early history of semiotics—the study of symbols—around Victoria, Lady Welby in particular. The original meaning of his intuitionism probably cannot be completely disentangled from the intellectual milieu of that group.

In 1905, at the age of 24, Brouwer expressed his philosophy of life in a short tract &quot;Life, Art and Mysticism&quot;, which has been described by the mathematician Martin Davis as &quot;drenched in romantic pessimism&quot; (Davis (2002), p. 94). Arthur Schopenhauer had a formative influence on Brouwer, not least because he insisted that all concepts be fundamentally based on sense intuitions. Brouwer then &quot;embarked on a self-righteous campaign to reconstruct mathematical practice from the ground up so as to satisfy his philosophical convictions&quot;; indeed his thesis advisor refused to accept his Chapter II &quot;as it stands, ... all interwoven with some kind of pessimism and mystical attitude to life which is not mathematics, nor has anything to do with the foundations of mathematics&quot; (Davis, p. 94 quoting van Stigt, p. 41). Nevertheless, in 1908:
: &quot;... Brouwer, in a paper titled &#x27;The untrustworthiness of the principles of logic&#x27;, challenged the belief that the rules of the classical logic, which have come down to us essentially from Aristotle (384--322 B.C.) have an absolute validity, independent of the subject matter to which they are applied&quot; (Kleene (1952), p. 46).

&quot;After completing his dissertation, Brouwer made a conscious decision to temporarily keep his contentious ideas under wraps and to concentrate on demonstrating his mathematical prowess&quot; (Davis (2000), p. 95); by 1910 he had published a number of important papers, in particular the Fixed Point Theorem. Hilbert—the formalist with whom the intuitionist Brouwer would ultimately spend years in conflict—admired the young man and helped him receive a regular academic appointment (1912) at the University of Amsterdam (Davis, p. 96). It was then that &quot;Brouwer felt free to return to his revolutionary project which he was now calling &quot;intuitionism&quot; &quot; (ibid).

He was combative as a young man. According to Mark van Atten, this pugnacity reflected his combination of independence, brilliance, high moral standards and extreme sensitivity to issues of justice. He was involved in a very public and eventually demeaning controversy with Hilbert in the late 1920s over editorial policy at &quot;Mathematische Annalen&quot;, at the time a leading journal. According to Abraham Fraenkel, Brouwer espoused Germanic Aryanness and Hilbert removed him from the editorial board of Mathematische Annalen after Brouwer objected to contributions from Ostjuden.

In later years Brouwer became relatively isolated; the development of intuitionism at its source was taken up by his student Arend Heyting. Dutch mathematician and historian of mathematics Bartel Leendert van der Waerden attended lectures given by Brouwer in later years, and commented: &quot;Even though his most important research contributions were in topology, Brouwer never gave courses in topology, but always on — and only on — the foundations of his intuitionism. It seemed that he was no longer convinced of his results in topology because they were not correct from the point of view of intuitionism, and he judged everything he had done before, his greatest output, false according to his philosophy.&quot;

About his last years, Davis (2002) remarks:
: &quot;...he felt more and more isolated, and spent his last years under the spell of &#x27;totally unfounded financial worries and a paranoid fear of bankruptcy, persecution and illness.&#x27; He was killed in 1966 at the age of 85, struck by a vehicle while crossing the street in front of his house.&quot; (Davis, p. 100 quoting van Stigt. p. 110.)

<text>The Storting ( ; ) is the supreme legislature of Norway, established in 1814 by the Constitution of Norway. It is located in Oslo. The unicameral parliament has 169 members and is elected every four years based on party-list proportional representation in nineteen multi-seat constituencies. A member of the Storting is known in Norwegian as a &quot;stortingsrepresentant&quot;, literally &quot;Storting representative&quot;.

The assembly is led by a president and, since 2009, five vice presidents: the presidium. The members are allocated to twelve standing committees as well as four procedural committees. Three ombudsmen are directly subordinate to parliament: the Parliamentary Intelligence Oversight Committee and the Office of the Auditor General.

Parliamentarianism was established in 1884, with the Storting operating a form of &quot;qualified unicameralism&quot;, in which it divided its membership into two internal chambers making Norway a de facto bicameral parliament, the Lagting and the Odelsting. Following a constitutional amendment in 2007, this was abolished, taking effect following the 2009 election.

Following the 2021 election, ten parties are represented in parliament: the Labour Party (48), the Conservative Party (36), the Centre Party (28), the Progress Party (21), the Socialist Left Party (13), the Red Party (8), the Liberal Party (8), the Christian Democratic Party (3), the Green Party (3), and the Patient Focus Party (1). Since 2021, Masud Gharahkhani has been President of the Storting.

== History ==
The parliament in its present form was first constituted at Eidsvoll in 1814, although its origins can be traced back to the allting, as early as the 9th century, a type of &quot;thing&quot;, or common assembly of free men in Germanic societies that would gather at a place called a thingstead and were presided over by lawspeakers. The alltings were where legal and political matters were discussed. These gradually were formalised so that the things grew into regional meetings and acquired backing and authority from the Crown, even to the extent that on occasions they were instrumental in effecting change in the monarchy itself.

As oral laws became codified and Norway unified as a geopolitical entity in the 10th century, the lagtings (&quot;law things&quot;) were established as superior regional assemblies. During the mid-13th century, the by then archaic regional assemblies, the Frostating, the Gulating, the Eidsivating and the Borgarting, were amalgamated and the corpus of law was set down under the command of King Magnus Lagabøte. This jurisdiction remained significant until King Frederick III proclaimed absolute monarchy in 1660; this was ratified by the passage of the King Act of 1665, and this became the constitution of the Union of Denmark and Norway and remained so until 1814 and the foundation of the Storting.

The Parliament of Norway Building opened in 1866.

===World War II===
On 27 June 1940 the presidium signed an appeal to King Haakon, seeking his abdication. (The presidium then consisted of the presidents and vice-presidents of parliament, Odelstinget and Lagtinget. Ivar Lykke stepped in (according to mandate) in place of the president in exile, C. J. Hambro; Lykke was one [of the six] who signed.)

In September 1940 the representatives were summoned to Oslo, and voted in favour of the results of the negotiations between the presidium and the authorities of the German invaders. (92 voted for, and 53 voted against.) However, directives from Adolf Hitler resulted in the obstruction of &quot;the agreement of cooperation between parliament and [the] occupation force&quot;.

===Qualified unicameralism (1814–2009)===
The Storting has always been &quot;de jure&quot; unicameral, but before a constitutional amendment in 2009 it was de facto bicameral. After an election, the Storting would elect a quarter of its membership to form the Lagting, a sort of &quot;upper house&quot; or revising chamber, with the remaining three-quarters forming the Odelsting or &quot;lower house&quot;. The division was also used on very rare occasions in cases of impeachment. The original idea in 1814 was probably to have the Lagting act as an actual upper house, and the senior and more experienced members of the Storting were placed there. Later, however, the composition of the Lagting closely followed that of the Odelsting, so that there was very little that differentiated them, and the passage of a bill in the Lagting was mostly a formality.
Bills were submitted by the Government to the Odelsting or by a member of the Odelsting; members of the Lagting were not permitted to propose legislation by themselves. A standing committee, with members from both the Odelsting and Lagting, would then consider the bill, and in some cases hearings were held. If passed by the Odelsting, the bill would be sent to the Lagting for review or revision. Most bills were passed unamended by the Lagting and then sent directly to the king for royal assent. If the Lagting amended the Odelsting&#x27;s draft, the bill would be sent back to the Odelsting. If the Odelsting approved the Lagting&#x27;s amendments, the bill would be signed into law by the King. If it did not, then the bill would return to the Lagting. If the Lagting still proposed amendments, the bill would be submitted to a plenary session of the Storting. To be passed, the bill required the approval of a two-thirds majority of the plenary session. In all other cases a simple majority would suffice. Three days had to pass between each time a chamber voted on a bill. In all other cases, such as taxes and appropriations, the Storting would meet in plenary session.

A proposal to amend the constitution and abolish the Odelsting and Lagting was introduced in 2004 and was passed by the Storting on 20 February 2007 (159–1 with nine absentees). It took effect with the newly elected Storting in 2009.

===Number of seats===
The number of seats in the Storting has varied over the years. In 1882 there were 114 seats, increasing to 117 in 1903, 123 in 1906, 126 in 1918, 150 in 1921, 155 in 1973, 157 in 1985, 165 in 1989, and 169 as of 2005.

==Procedure==

===Legislative===

The legislative procedure goes through five stages. First, a bill is introduced to parliament either by a member of government or, in the case of a private member&#x27;s bill, by any individual representative. Parliament will refer the bill to the relevant standing committee, where it will be subjected to detailed consideration in the committee stage. The first reading takes place when parliament debates the recommendation from the committee, and then takes a vote. If the bill is dismissed, the procedure ends. The second reading takes place at least three days after the first reading, in which parliament debates the bill again. A new vote is taken, and if successful, the bill is submitted to the King in Council for royal assent. If parliament comes to a different conclusion during the second reading, a third reading will be held at least three days later, repeating the debate and vote, and may adopt the amendments from the second reading or finally dismiss the bill.

===Royal assent===
Once the bill has reached the King in Council, the bill must be signed by the monarch and countersigned by the prime minister. It then becomes Norwegian law from the date stated in the Act or decided by the government.

Articles 77–79 of the Norwegian constitution specifically grant the King of Norway the right to withhold Royal Assent from any bill passed by the Storting. This right has never been exercised by any Norwegian monarch since the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905 (though it was exercised by Swedish monarchs before then when they ruled Norway). Should the king ever choose to exercise this privilege, Article 79 provides a means by which his veto may be overridden if the Storting passes the same bill after a general election:

&quot;If a Bill has been passed unaltered by two sessions of the Storting, constituted after two separate successive elections and separated from each other by at least two intervening sessions of the Storting, without a divergent Bill having been passed by any Storting in the period between the first and last adoption, and it is then submitted to the King with a petition that His Majesty shall not refuse his assent to a Bill which, after the most mature deliberation, the Storting considers to be beneficial, it shall become law even if the Royal Assent is not accorded before the Storting goes into recess.&quot;

==Organisation==
===Presidium===

The presidium is chaired by the president of the Storting, consisting of the president and five vice presidents of the Storting. The system with five vice presidents was implemented in 2009. Before this there was a single holder of the office.
===Standing committees===
The members of parliament are allocated into twelve standing committees, of which eleven are related to specific political topics. The last is the Standing Committee on Scrutiny and Constitutional Affairs. The standing committees have a portfolio that covers that of one or more government ministers.
===Other committees===
There are four other committees, that run parallel to the standing committees. The Enlarged Committee on Foreign Affairs consists of members of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, the presidium, and the parliamentary leaders. The committee discusses important issues related to foreign affairs, trade policy, and national safety with the government. Discussions are confidential. The European Committee consists of the members of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and the parliamentary delegation to the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Free Trade Area (EFTA). The committee conducts discussions with the government regarding directives from the European Union.

The Election Committee consists of 37 members, and is responsible for internal elections within the parliament, as well as delegating and negotiating party and representative allocation within the presidium, standing committees, and other committees. The Preparatory Credentials Committee has 16 members and is responsible for approving the election.

===Appointed agencies===
Five public agencies are appointed by parliament rather than by the government. The Office of the Auditor General is the auditor of all branches of the public administration and is responsible for auditing, monitoring and advising all state economic activities. The Parliamentary Ombudsman is an ombudsman responsible for public administration. It can investigate any public matter that has not been processed by an elected body, the courts, or within the military. The Ombudsman for the Armed Forces is an ombudsman responsible for the military. The Ombudsman for Civilian National Servicemen is responsible for people serving civilian national service. The Parliamentary Intelligence Oversight Committee is a seven-member body responsible for supervising public intelligence, surveillance, and security services. Parliament also appoints the five members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that award the Nobel Peace Prize.

===Administration===
Parliament has an administration of about 450 people, led by Director of the Storting Marianne Andreassen, who assumed office in 2018. She also acts as secretary for the presidium.

===Party groups===
Each party represented in parliament has a party group. It is led by a board and chaired by a parliamentary leader. It is customary for the party leader to also act as parliamentary leader, but since party leaders of government parties normally sit as ministers, governing parties elect other representatives as their parliamentary leaders. The table reflects the results of the September 2021 election.
==Elections==

Members to the Storting are elected based on party-list proportional representation in plural member constituencies. This means that representatives from different political parties are elected from each constituency. The constituencies are identical to the 19 former counties of Norway. Although county mergers have brought the number of counties down to 11, the 19 constituencies are unchanged. The electorate does not vote for individuals but rather for party lists, with a ranked list of candidates nominated by the party. This means that the person on top of the list will get the seat unless the voter alters the ballot. Parties may nominate candidates from outside their own constituency, and even Norwegian citizens currently living abroad.

The Sainte-Laguë method is used for allocating parliamentary seats to parties. As a result, the percentage of representatives is roughly equal to the nationwide percentage of votes. Still, a party with a high number of votes in only one constituency can win a seat there even if the nationwide percentage is low. This has happened several times in Norwegian history. Conversely, if a party&#x27;s initial representation in Stortinget is proportionally less than its share of votes, the party may seat more representatives through leveling seats, provided that the nationwide percentage is above the election threshold, currently at 4%. In 2009, nineteen seats were allocated via the leveling system. Elections are held each four years (in odd-numbered years occurring after a year evenly divisible by four), normally on the second Monday of September.

Unlike most other parliaments, the Storting always serves its full four-year term; the Constitution does not allow snap elections. Substitutes for each deputy are elected at the same time as each election, so by-elections are rare.

Norway switched its parliamentary elections from single-member districts decided by two-round run-offs to multi-member districts with proportional representation in 1919.

== Historical composition of the Storting ==
=== Norway parliamentary election (since 1921 - proportional election) ===
==Members==

The parliament has 169 members. If a member of parliament cannot serve (for instance because he or she is a member of the cabinet), a deputy representative serves instead. The deputy is the candidate from the same party who was listed on the ballot immediately behind the candidates who were elected in the last election.
In the plenary chamber, the seats are laid out in a hemicycle. Seats for cabinet members in attendance are provided on the first row, behind them the members of parliament are seated according to county, not party group. Viewed from the president&#x27;s chair, Aust-Agder&#x27;s representatives are seated near the front, furthest to the left, while the last members (Østfold) are seated furthest to the right and at the back.

==Code of conduct==
Unparliamentary language includes: one-night stand, smoke screen government, pure nonsense, Molbo politics, may God forbid, lie, and &quot;som fanden leser Bibelen&quot;.

==Building==
Since 5 March 1866, parliament has met in the Parliament of Norway Building at Karl Johans gate 22 in Oslo. The building was designed by the Swedish architect Emil Victor Langlet and is built in yellow brick with details and basement in light gray granite. It is a combination of several styles, including inspirations from France and Italy. Parliament do also include offices and meeting rooms in the nearby buildings, since the Parliament building is too small to hold all the current staff of the legislature. The buildings in Akersgata 18, Prinsens Gate 26, Akersgata 21, Tollbugata 31 and Nedre Vollgate 18 also contains parliamentary staff and members of Parliament.

<doc id="172898" wikidata="Q50040" url="?curid=172898" title="Dire Straits">
<text>Dire Straits were a British rock band formed in London in 1977 by Mark Knopfler (lead vocals, lead guitar), David Knopfler (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), John Illsley (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Pick Withers (drums, percussion). The band was active from 1977 to 1988 and again from 1990 to 1995.

Their first single, &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;, from their 1978 self-titled debut album, reached the top ten in the UK and US charts. It was followed by a series of hit singles including &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1981), &quot;Private Investigations&quot; (1982), &quot;Twisting by the Pool&quot; (1983), &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; (1985), and &quot;Walk of Life&quot; (1985). Their most commercially successful album, &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; (1985), has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide; it was the first album to sell a million copies on CD and is the eighth-best-selling album in UK history. According to the &quot;Guinness Book of British Hit Albums&quot;, as of 2005, Dire Straits had spent over 1,100 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, the fifth-most at that time.

Dire Straits drew from influences including country, folk, the blues rock of J. J. Cale, and jazz. Their stripped-down sound contrasted with punk rock and demonstrated a roots rock influence that emerged from pub rock. The band experienced several changes in personnel, with Mark Knopfler and Illsley being the only members who remained with the band for its entire history. After their first breakup in 1988, Knopfler told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;A lot of press reports were saying we were the biggest band in the world. There&#x27;s not an accent then on the music, there&#x27;s an accent on popularity. I needed a rest.&quot; They regrouped in 1990 and disbanded permanently in June 1995, after which Knopfler launched a solo career full-time. He has declined numerous reunion offers, and confirmed in April 2024 that he would never play as part of the group again.

Dire Straits were called &quot;the biggest British rock band of the 80s&quot; by &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine; their 1985–1986 world tour, which included a performance at Live Aid in July 1985, set a record in Australasia. Their final world tour from 1991 to 1992 sold 7.1 million tickets. The band won four Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards (including Best British Group twice) and two MTV Video Music Awards, among various others. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018. Dire Straits have sold between 100 million and 120 million records worldwide, including 51.4 million certified units, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time.

==History==

===1977–1979: Early years and first two albums ===

Brothers Mark and David Knopfler were born in Glasgow and raised in Blyth in the northeast of England. With John Illsley and Pick Withers, from Leicester in the East Midlands, they formed Dire Straits in Deptford, south east London, in 1977. Withers was already a 10-year music business veteran, having been a session drummer for Dave Edmunds, Gerry Rafferty, Magna Carta and others through the 1970s. He was house drummer at Rockfield Studios in Monmouthshire and was part of the group Spring, which recorded an album for RCA in 1971. At the time of the band&#x27;s formation, Mark was working as an English teacher, Illsley was studying at Goldsmiths&#x27; College, and David was a social worker. Mark and Withers had both been part of the pub rock group Brewers Droop around 1973.

The new band was initially known as the Café Racers. The name Dire Straits was coined by a musician flatmate of Withers, allegedly thought up while they were rehearsing in the kitchen of a friend, Simon Cowe, of Lindisfarne. In 1977, the group recorded a five-song demo tape which included their future hit single, &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;, as well as &quot;Water of Love&quot; and &quot;Down to the Waterline&quot;. After a performance at the Rock Garden in 1977, they took a demo tape to MCA in Soho but were turned down. They sent a tape to DJ Charlie Gillett, presenter of &quot;Honky Tonk&quot; on BBC Radio London. The band simply wanted advice, but Gillett liked the music so much that he played &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot; on his show. Two months later, Dire Straits signed a recording contract with the Vertigo division of Phonogram Inc. In October 1977, the band recorded demo tapes of &quot;Southbound Again&quot;, &quot;In the Gallery&quot; and &quot;Six Blade Knife&quot; for BBC Radio London; in November, demo tapes were made of &quot;Setting Me Up&quot;, &quot;Eastbound Train&quot; and &quot;Real Girl&quot;.
The group&#x27;s first album, &quot;Dire Straits&quot;, was recorded at Basing Street studios in Notting Hill, London in February 1978, at a cost of £12,500. Produced by Muff Winwood, it was first released in the United Kingdom on Vertigo Records, then a division of Phonogram Inc. It came to the attention of A&amp;R representative Karin Berg, working at Warner Bros. Records in New York City. She felt that it was the kind of music audiences were hungry for, but only one person in her department agreed at first. Many of the songs on the album reflected Mark Knopfler&#x27;s experiences in Newcastle, Leeds and London. &quot;Down to the Waterline&quot; recalled images of life in Newcastle; &quot;In the Gallery&quot; is a tribute to Leeds sculptor/artist Harry Phillips (father of Steve Phillips); &quot;Wild West End&quot; and &quot;Lions&quot; were drawn from Knopfler&#x27;s early days in the capital.

That year, Dire Straits began a tour as opening band for Talking Heads, after the re-released &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot; finally started to climb the UK charts. This led to a United States recording contract with Warner Bros. Records; before the end of 1978, Dire Straits had released their self-titled debut worldwide. They received more attention in the US, but also arrived at the top of the charts in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. &quot;Dire Straits&quot; eventually went top 10 in every European country.

The following year, Dire Straits embarked on their first North American tour. They played 51 sold-out concerts over a 38-day period. &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot; scaled the charts to No. 4 in the US and No. 8 in the United Kingdom. The song was one of Dire Straits&#x27; biggest hits and became a fixture in the band&#x27;s live performances. Bob Dylan, who had seen the band play in Los Angeles, was so impressed that he invited Mark Knopfler and drummer Pick Withers to play on his next album, &quot;Slow Train Coming&quot;.

Recording sessions for the group&#x27;s second album, &quot;Communiqué&quot;, took place in December 1978 at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas. Released in June 1979, &quot;Communiqué&quot; was produced by Jerry Wexler and Barry Beckett and went to No. 1 on the German album charts, with the debut album &quot;Dire Straits&quot; simultaneously at No. 3. In the United Kingdom, the album peaked at No. 5 in the album charts. Featuring the single &quot;Lady Writer&quot;, the second album continued in a similar vein to the first and displayed the expanding scope of Knopfler&#x27;s lyricism on the opening track, &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;. In the coming year, however, this approach began to change, along with the group&#x27;s line-up.

===1980–1984: &quot;Making Movies&quot;, &quot;Love Over Gold&quot; and other side projects===

In 1980, Dire Straits were nominated for two Grammy Awards for Best New Artist and Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group for &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;. In July 1980, the band started recording tracks for their third album. Produced by Jimmy Iovine, with Mark Knopfler also sharing credit, &quot;Making Movies&quot; was released in October 1980. During the recording sessions, tensions between the Knopfler brothers reached a point where David Knopfler decided to leave the band for a solo career. The remaining trio continued the album, with a session guitarist Sid McGinnis on rhythm guitar, although he was uncredited on the album, and Roy Bittan from Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band guesting on keyboards. After the recording sessions were completed, keyboardist Alan Clark and Californian guitarist Hal Lindes joined Dire Straits as full-time members for the &quot;On Location&quot; tour of Europe, North America, and Oceania.

&quot;Making Movies&quot; received mostly positive reviews and featured longer songs with more complex arrangements, a style which would continue for the rest of the band&#x27;s career. The album featured many of Mark Knopfler&#x27;s most personal compositions. The most successful chart single was &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (number 8 in the UK Singles Chart), a song about a failed love affair, with Knopfler&#x27;s trademark in keeping personal songs under fictitious names. Although never released as a hit single, &quot;Solid Rock&quot; was featured in all Dire Straits&#x27; live shows from this point on for the remainder of their career, while the album&#x27;s lengthy opening track, &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;, with its intro &quot;The Carousel Waltz&quot; by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, was featured in the 1982 Richard Gere film &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;. Although &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; reached only no. 54 in the UK when released as a single in 1981, it remains one of Dire Straits&#x27; most famous and popular songs and immediately became a favourite live staple, entering the band’s concert repertoire from this point onwards. &quot;Making Movies&quot; stayed in the UK Albums Chart for five years, peaking at No. 4. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Making Movies&quot; number 52 on its list of the &quot;100 Best Albums of the Eighties&quot;.
Dire Straits&#x27; fourth studio album &quot;Love Over Gold&quot;, an album of songs filled with lengthy passages that featured Alan Clark&#x27;s piano and keyboard work, was well received when it was released in September 1982, going gold in America and spending four weeks at number one in the United Kingdom. The title was inspired by graffiti seen from the window of Knopfler&#x27;s old council flat in London. The phrase was taken from the sleeve of an album by Captain Beefheart. &quot;Love Over Gold&quot; was the first Dire Straits album produced solely by Mark Knopfler, and its main chart hit, &quot;Private Investigations&quot;, gave Dire Straits their first top 5 hit single in the United Kingdom, where it reached the number 2 position, despite its almost seven-minute length, and became another of the band&#x27;s most popular live songs.

In other parts of the world, &quot;Industrial Disease&quot;, a song that looks at the decline of the British manufacturing industry in the early 1980s, focusing on strikes, depression and dysfunctionality, was the main single from the album, particularly in Canada, where it became a top 10 hit. As well as the title track and &quot;It Never Rains&quot;, &quot;Love Over Gold&quot; featured the 14-minute epic &quot;Telegraph Road&quot;. Also written by Knopfler during this period was &quot;Private Dancer&quot;, which did not appear on the album, but was eventually given to Tina Turner for her comeback album of the same name. &quot;Love Over Gold&quot; reportedly sold two million copies during the first six weeks after its release. Shortly after the release of &quot;Love Over Gold&quot;, drummer Pick Withers left the band. His replacement was Terry Williams, formerly of Rockpile and a range of other Welsh bands, including Man.
In January 1983, a four-song EP titled &quot;ExtendedancEPlay&quot; was released while &quot;Love Over Gold&quot; was still in the album charts. It featured the hit single &quot;Twisting By the Pool&quot;, which reached the Top 20 in the UK and Canada. The band won Best British Group at the 1983 Brit Awards. Dire Straits embarked on an eight-month-long Love over Gold Tour, which finished with two concerts at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Odeon on 22 and 23 July 1983. King Crimson saxophonist Mel Collins and session keyboardist Tommy Mandel, who had played with Bryan Adams since 1981, joined the live line-up to help Clark cover his increasingly detailed keyboard parts and arrangements. The double album &quot;&quot; was a recording of excerpts from the final two concerts and was reportedly released without studio overdubs. It was released in March 1984, reaching the Top 3 in the UK Albums Chart.

During 1983 and 1984, Mark Knopfler was also involved with other projects outside of Dire Straits, some of which other band members contributed towards. Knopfler and Terry Williams contributed to Phil Everly´s and Cliff Richard´s UK hit single &quot;She Means Nothing To Me&quot;, released in early 1983, and Knopfler had also expressed his interest writing film music, and after producer David Puttnam responded he wrote and produced the music score to the film &quot;Local Hero&quot;. The album was released in April 1983 and received a BAFTA Award nomination for Best Original Film Music the following year. Alan Clark contributed significantly, and other Dire Straits members Illsley, Lindes and Williams played on one track, &quot;Freeway Flyer&quot;, while Gerry Rafferty sang lead vocals on &quot;The Way It Always Starts&quot;. The closing track on the album and played during the credits in the film is the instrumental &quot;Going Home: Theme of the Local Hero&quot; which was released as a single, and remains very popular among football fans, especially those of Knopfler’s home town club, Newcastle United, as it is played as the team runs out before every home game. The track immediately became a popular live staple for Dire Straits, entering the band&#x27;s repertoire from 1983 onwards.

&quot;Local Hero&quot; was followed in 1984 by &quot;Cal&quot;, which was also released on album and to which John Illsley and Terry Williams contributed, and &quot;Comfort and Joy&quot;, which also featured contributions from Williams. Also, during this time Knopfler produced Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Infidels&quot; which also featured Alan Clark, as well as albums for Aztec Camera and Willy DeVille. Also in 1984, John Illsley released his first solo album, &quot;Never Told a Soul&quot;, to which Knopfler, Clark and Williams all contributed. Knopfler also teamed up with Bryan Ferry to contribute lead guitar to one track from his solo album &quot;Boys and Girls&quot;, released in June 1985.

===1985–1986: &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; and international success===
Dire Straits returned to recording at the end of 1984 and began recording tracks at George Martin&#x27;s AIR Studios in Montserrat for their upcoming fifth studio album, to be titled &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;, with Mark Knopfler and Neil Dorfsman producing. The recording sessions saw further personnel changes. Taking the place of Tommy Mandel, Guy Fletcher, who had previously worked as a session musician with Roxy Music and had worked with Knopfler on the &quot;Cal&quot; and &quot;Comfort and Joy&quot; soundtracks, joined Dire Straits full time so that the band had a permanent second keyboardist. Hal Lindes left the band early on during the recording sessions and was replaced in December 1984 by Jack Sonni, a New York-based guitarist and longstanding friend of Knopfler (although Sonni&#x27;s contribution to the album was minimal).

According to a &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; magazine interview with Neil Dorfsman, the drumming style of Terry Williams was considered to be unsuitable for the desired sound of the album during the first month of the recording sessions at Montserrat. Williams was released from the recording sessions and temporarily replaced by jazz session drummer Omar Hakim, who re-recorded the album&#x27;s drum parts within three days before leaving for other commitments. Both Hakim and Williams are credited on the album, although Williams’ sole contribution on the finished album was the song &quot;Walk of life&quot; and the improvised crescendo at the beginning of &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;. According to another interview with Dorfsman, Williams played toms and tom fills throughout &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; and &quot;Walk of life&quot;, while Omar Hakim played drums on all the remaining tracks on the album. According to Williams, he recorded all his drum parts to a click track which he felt hindered his ability to channel the rhythmic feel he wanted. Around six weeks after the recording sessions started, Williams voiced his disappointment to Mark Knopfler over some of his playing so far after listening to a playback of what was recorded; shortly after this, he was dismissed from the sessions. Williams would however be back in the band as a full time member for the music videos and the 1985–1986 Brothers in Arms world tour that followed.

Released in May 1985, &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; entered the UK Albums Chart at number 1 and spent a total of 228 weeks in the charts and sold over 4 million copies. It went on to become the best-selling album of 1985 in the UK. &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; was similarly successful in the US, peaking at No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for nine weeks, going multi-platinum and selling nine million copies there. The album spent 34 weeks at number 1 on the Australian ARIA Charts, and it remains the longest-running number one album in Australia.
The album featured a more lavish production and overall sound than Dire Straits&#x27; earlier work and spawned several big chart singles: &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;, which reached number 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and number 4 in the UK Singles Chart, &quot;So Far Away&quot; (No. 20 UK, No. 19 US), &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; (No. 16 UK), &quot;Walk of Life&quot; (No. 2 UK, No. 7 US), and &quot;Your Latest Trick&quot; (No. 26 UK). &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; was the first video to be played on MTV in the UK and featured guest vocals by Sting, who is credited with co-writing the song with Mark Knopfler, although it was the inclusion of the melody from &quot;Don&#x27;t Stand So Close To Me&quot; that triggered the copyright credit, as no actual lyrics were written by Sting. It also won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in February 1986.

Some sources cite &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; as the first album recorded entirely digitally, but the history of commercially-released all-digital recordings goes back to the early 1970s, and multitrack digital recorders were used for popular music albums by the late 1970s. Written during Britain&#x27;s involvement in the Falklands War of 1982, the album&#x27;s title track, &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;, deals with the senselessness of war. In 2007, the 25th anniversary of the war, Knopfler recorded a new version of the song at Abbey Road Studios to raise funds for British veterans who he said &quot;are still suffering from the effects of that conflict.&quot; &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; has become a favourite at military funerals. Reported to be the world&#x27;s first CD single, it was issued in the UK as a promotional item distinguished with a logo for the tour, Live in &#x27;85, while a second to commemorate the Australian leg of the tour marked Live in &#x27;86. &quot;Walk of Life&quot;, meanwhile, was nearly excluded from the album when co-producer Neil Dorfsman voted against its inclusion, but the band members out-voted him. The result was Dire Straits&#x27; most commercially successful hit single in the UK, peaking at number two.
The album is listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the first compact disc (CD) to sell a million copies, and it has been credited with popularising the CD format. &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; CD number 38 in their list of the 50 key events in rock music history. The album featured the full version of the &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; cut, rather than the LP version, and it also includes extended versions of all tracks on the first side of the LP, with the exception of &quot;Walk of Life&quot;.

The 1985–1986 Brothers in Arms world tour which followed the album&#x27;s release was phenomenally successful, with over 2.5 million tickets sold. The tour included dates in Europe, Israel, North America, and Australia and New Zealand. The band, joined by saxophonist Chris White, played 248 shows in over 100 different cities. The tour began on 25 April 1985 in Split, Croatia (then part of Yugoslavia). While playing a 13-night residency at Wembley Arena in London, the band moved down the road to Wembley Stadium on the afternoon of 13 July 1985, to appear in a Live Aid slot, in which their set included &quot;Money For Nothing&quot; with Sting as guest vocalist. John Illsley states, &quot;It was a very special feeling to be part of something so unique. Live Aid was a unique privilege for all of us. It’s become a fabulous memory.&quot; The tour ended at the Sydney Entertainment Centre, Australia, on 26 April 1986, where Dire Straits still holds the record for consecutive appearances at 21 nights. The band also made an impromptu attempt at the Australian folk song &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;. With 900,000 tickets sold in Australia and New Zealand, it was the biggest concert tour in Australasian music history, until it was overtaken in 2017–2018 by Ed Sheeran.
Additionally, in 1985, a group that set out from London to Khartoum to raise money for famine relief, led by John Abbey, was called &quot;The Walk of Life&quot;. Dire Straits donated the &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; Gold disc to the participants in recognition of what they were doing.

The band&#x27;s concert of 10 July 1985 at Wembley Arena, in which they were accompanied by Nils Lofgren for &quot;Solid Rock&quot; and Hank Marvin joined the band at the end to play &quot;Going Home&quot; (the theme from &quot;Local Hero&quot;), was partially televised in the United Kingdom on The Tube on Channel 4 in January 1986. (Although never officially released, bootleg recordings of the performance entitled &quot;Wembley does the Walk&quot; (2005) have been circulated.)

In 1986, &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; won two Grammy Awards and also won Best British Album at the 1987 Brit Awards. &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed the album at number 51 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever in 2000. The album also ranked number 351 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; in 2003. &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; is also ranked number 3 in the best albums of 1985 and number 31 in the best albums of the 1980s, and as of December 2017, the album was ranked the eighth-best-selling album in UK chart history, and is the 107th-best-selling album in the United States. In August 1986, MTV Europe was launched with Dire Straits&#x27; &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;.

===1987–1990: First break-up===
After the &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; tour ended, Mark Knopfler took a break from Dire Straits, and, during 1987, he concentrated on solo projects and film soundtracks. Dire Straits regrouped in 1988 for the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute concert, staged on 11 June 1988 at Wembley Stadium, in which they were the headline act. Guitarist Jack Sonni was unable to play the show as it coincided with the birth of his twin daughters, so Eric Clapton played rhythm guitar with the band, and during the set performed his hit &quot;Wonderful Tonight&quot; with them. Sonni and Terry Williams both officially left the band shortly afterwards.
Mark Knopfler announced the dissolution of Dire Straits in September 1988. He told Rob Tannenbaum in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;A lot of press reports were saying we were the biggest band in the world. There&#x27;s not an accent then on the music, there&#x27;s an accent on popularity. I needed a rest.&quot; The tremendous success of the &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; album and the tour that went with it left the band members under a significant amount of stress, and Knopfler announced that he wanted to work on more personal projects. A best of / greatest hits compilation, &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;, was released in October 1988 and reached number one in the UK. The group&#x27;s first hit single &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot; was re-released as a single in the UK to promote the album. Also in 1988, John Illsley released his second solo album, &quot;Glass&quot;, which featured Mark Knopfler, Alan Clark, Guy Fletcher and Chris White. During this period, Alan Clark joined Eric Clapton&#x27;s band for three years, during which time Knopfler also briefly joined.

In May 1989, Dire Straits reunited for a one off charity concert at the Mayfair Ballroom in Newcastle in honour of 11-year-old Joanne Gillespie – the National Children of Courage and North East Personality award winner who published the 1989 book Brave Heart about her fight against cancer. The concert raised more than £35,000. This was the last ever appearance by Terry Williams as the band’s drummer, and Brendan Croker played rhythm guitar in place of Jack Sonni. Also in 1989 over a meal at a Notting Hill wine bar, Knopfler formed the Notting Hillbillies, a country band featuring Guy Fletcher, Brendan Croker, and Steve Phillips, and their manager, Ed Bicknell on drums. The Notting Hillbillies&#x27; one album, &quot;Missing...Presumed Having a Good Time&quot;, with its single &quot;Your Own Sweet Way&quot;, was released in March 1990. The Notting Hillbillies toured for the remainder of the year and appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Knopfler further emphasised his country music influences on his 1990 collaboration with the guitarist Chet Atkins, &quot;Neck and Neck&quot;.

In 1990, Dire Straits (Knopfler, Illsley, Clark and Fletcher), performed alongside Eric Clapton and his band at the Knebworth Festival, playing &quot;Solid Rock&quot;, &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; and &quot;I Think I Love You Too Much&quot;. Knopfler explained that the latter was an experimental song and was unsure if they should record it on a following record. The song, a blues rock track with solos by Knopfler and Clapton, also appeared on the 1990 album &quot;Hell To Pay&quot; as a gift to Canadian blues/jazz artist Jeff Healey from Knopfler. This was prior to the time that Knopfler, Illsley and manager Ed Bicknell decided to reform the band the following year.

=== 1990–1995: &quot;On Every Street&quot; and final dissolution ===
In 1990, Dire Straits reunited. Retaining Bicknell as their manager, Mark Knopfler, John Illsley, Alan Clark and Guy Fletcher were joined in the studio by saxophonist Chris White, steel guitarist Paul Franklin, percussionist Danny Cummings and guitarist Phil Palmer, with drums split between Jeff Porcaro of Toto and Manu Katché. The new album was produced by Knopfler, Clark and Fletcher.

Dire Straits released their sixth studio album, &quot;On Every Street&quot;, in September 1991, which turned out to be their final studio release. It was met with more moderate success and mixed reviews, as well as a significantly reduced audience. Some retrospective reviewers, including the All Music Guide, dubbed &quot;On Every Street&quot; an &quot;underwhelming&quot; follow-up to &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;. However, it had sold 15 million copies by 2008, and on release, it went straight to number 1 in the UK Albums Chart. The album also reached number 1 in numerous European countries and Australia, and was particularly successful in France, where it achieved Diamond certification. In the US, it peaked at number 12.

Several singles were released from the album, some of which achieved success in Europe, Australasia and the US; however, none were successful in the UK. An edited version of the opening track &quot;Calling Elvis&quot; was the first single released from the album. With a video based on the 1960s television show &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, the track charted at number 21 on its first week in the UK Singles Chart but dropped out of the charts within four weeks. The track fared much better elsewhere, however, reaching the top 10 in Australia, New Zealand and throughout Europe, peaking as high as the number 2 position in several countries, including Denmark and Switzerland, and number 1 in Italy.

The follow-up single, &quot;Heavy Fuel&quot;, failed to reach the Top 50 in the UK Singles chart; however, it reached number one in the US on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, their second song to do so (after &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;). The track reached the top 20 in Canada and Belgium and peaked inside the top 30 in other European countries, as well as Australia. The album&#x27;s title track was also relatively unsuccessful in the UK, failing to reach the top 40, although it reached the top 25 in France. The final single released in the UK was &quot;The Bug&quot;, which reached the top 25 in Canada and contains backing vocals by Vince Gill, who was invited to join the band full-time but declined and pursued a solo career. &quot;You and Your Friend&quot; was also released as a single in France and Germany, but not in the UK.

Dire Straits, with Chris Whitten on drums, embarked on a world tour to promote the album, which lasted until October 1992. The On Every Street Tour featured 300 shows in front of some 7.1 million ticket-buying fans. While musically more elaborate than the previous 1985–86 world tour, the band&#x27;s gruelling final tour was not as critically acclaimed nor as commercially successful. This proved to be too much for Dire Straits, and by this time Mark Knopfler had enough of such massive operations. This led to the second and final break-up. Bill Flanagan described the sequence of events in &quot;GQ&quot;: &quot;The subsequent world tour lasted nearly two years, made mountains of money and drove Dire Straits into the ground. When the tour was over, both Knopfler&#x27;s marriage and his band were gone.&quot;
Manager Ed Bicknell also said, &quot;The last tour was utter misery. Whatever the zeitgeist was that we had been part of, it had passed.&quot; John Illsley agreed, saying &quot;Personal relationships were in trouble and it put a terrible strain on everybody, emotionally and physically. We were changed by it.&quot; The last stop and final touring concert of the group took place on 9 October 1992 in Zaragoza, Spain.

After the end of the tour, Mark Knopfler expressed a wish to give up touring on a big scale and took some time out from the music business. A live album, &quot;On the Night&quot;, was released in May 1993, which documented the tour, again to very mixed reviews. Nevertheless, it reached the UK Top 5, a rare achievement for a live album. The four track &quot;Encores&quot; EP was also released and rose to number one in the French and Spanish singles charts and reached number 31 in the UK.

Dire Straits&#x27; final album, &quot;Live at the BBC&quot;, is a collection of live recordings from 1978 to 1981, which mostly feature the original line-up of the band. Released in June 1995, their third and final live album was a contractual release to Vertigo Records (now a division of Mercury Records). At this time, Mark Knopfler quietly disbanded Dire Straits and prepared to work on his first full-fledged solo album (still signed to Mercury Records). Knopfler later recalled that, &quot;I put the thing to bed because I wanted to get back to some kind of reality. It&#x27;s self-protection, a survival thing. That kind of scale is dehumanizing.&quot; Knopfler spent two years recovering from the experience, which had taken a toll on his creative and personal life.

===1996–present: Reunion speculations and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction===
After disbanding Dire Straits, Mark Knopfler started a career as a solo artist, releasing his first solo album, &quot;Golden Heart&quot;, in March 1996 after nearly 20 years of collaborations. &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; was certified nine times platinum in the US in August 1996. During that year, the entire Dire Straits catalogue was remastered by Bob Ludwig and re-released on CD on Mercury Records, in most of the world outside the US. The remasters were released in September 2000 in the US on Warner Bros.

Knopfler, John Illsley, Alan Clark, and Guy Fletcher reunited for one last time on 19 June 1999, with Ed Bicknell on drums, playing five songs, including Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Nadine&quot;, for Illsley&#x27;s wedding. In July 2002, Knopfler was joined by Illsley, Fletcher, Danny Cummings and Chris White for four charity concerts under the name of &quot;Mark Knopfler and friends&quot;. Brendan Croker joined Knopfler during the first half, playing mainly material composed with The Notting Hillbillies. Illsley came on for a Dire Straits session toward the end of which, at a Shepherd&#x27;s Bush concert, Jimmy Nail provided backing vocals for Knopfler&#x27;s solo composition, &quot;Why Aye Man&quot;. This song appeared on &quot;The Ragpicker&#x27;s Dream&quot; (2002), an album that contained references to Knopfler&#x27;s home area in the north east of England.

A compilation album, &quot;The Best of Dire Straits &amp; Mark Knopfler: Private Investigations&quot;, was released in November 2005 and reached the UK Top 20. Featuring material from the majority of Dire Straits&#x27; studio albums and Knopfler&#x27;s solo and soundtrack material, it was released in two editions, a single CD with a grey cover and a double CD in a blue cover. The only previously unreleased track on the album, &quot;All the Roadrunning&quot;, was a duet with singer Emmylou Harris. The album was well received. In 2005, &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; was re-released in a limited 20th anniversary edition which won a Grammy Award for Best Surround Sound Album at the 48th Grammy Awards ceremony.
Since the break-up of Dire Straits, Knopfler has shown no interest in re-forming the band and is quoted as saying he was not interested in &quot;getting all that stuff back together again.&quot; He said, &quot;I would only do that for a charity. I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve experienced it all – I had a lot of fun with it – but I like things the way they are.&quot; Keyboardist Guy Fletcher has been associated with almost all of Knopfler&#x27;s solo work to date and Danny Cummings has been a frequent contributor, notably to Knopfler&#x27;s solo album releases &quot;All the Roadrunning&quot; (with Emmylou Harris), &quot;Kill to Get Crimson&quot;, &quot;Get Lucky&quot; and &quot;One Deep River&quot;.

In 2007, Knopfler said he did not miss the global fame that came his way at the height of the band&#x27;s success. He said, &quot;It just got too big.&quot; In October 2008, Illsley told the BBC that he hoped Knopfler would agree to re-form Dire Straits for a comeback tour. Knopfler declined, saying that he was reluctant to re-form the group and that he was not &quot;a fan of Dire Straits&#x27; early hits.&quot; In the same interview, Illsley said Knopfler was enjoying his continuing success as a solo artist. &quot;He&#x27;s doing incredibly well as a solo artist, so hats off to him. He&#x27;s having a perfectly good time doing what he&#x27;s doing.&quot; Guy Fletcher stated on his website that Knopfler had no interest in re-forming Dire Straits.

In December 2009, the band were commemorated with a Heritage Award from PRS for Music. A plaque was placed on a block of flats in Deptford, London, where Dire Straits was formed and played their first gig. In 2011, Alan Clark, Chris White, and Phil Palmer, along with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers&#x27; drummer Steve Ferrone, formed a new band, the Straits, to perform at a charity show at the Royal Albert Hall in London.

On 13 December 2017, Dire Straits were announced as inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for 2018. Speaking to &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, Illsley said he was pleased to have his work as a musician recognised, but felt that Knopfler was not enthusiastic about a possible reunion performance. Knopfler did not appear at the ceremony. They were the first act ever inducted without anyone introducing them, and they did not perform.

In 2009, Illsley and Clark performed several Dire Straits songs in an open air concert in San Vigilio, and since then, Clark, Palmer, Illsley, Cummings, Collins, Sonni and Withers, in various line-ups, have toured as the Dire Straits Legends and continue as the Dire Straits Legacy. They have released an album, &quot;3 Chord Trick&quot;. In a 2018 US tour they were joined by Trevor Horn on bass and Steve Ferrone on drums.

In September 2021, Alan Clark released his piano solo album &quot;Backstory&quot;, and in November 2021 Illsley published his autobiography &quot;My Life in Dire Straits&quot;. Former Straits guitarist Jack Sonni died on 30 August 2023 at the age of 68.

In November 2023, Illsley reiterated in an interview that he and Knopfler had no interest in reforming Dire Straits, in spite of having received large financial offers to get back together. He reflected that the band members had &quot;reached the end of the road&quot; after the end of their final world tour in 1992, and that he was &quot;pretty happy&quot; when the band’s run came to an end, recalling feeling &quot;mentally, physically and emotionally exhausted&quot; by the time Dire Straits disbanded. He said he and Knopfler had enjoyed the success of the band, despite the stress of keeping it working, and quoted Knopfler&#x27;s comment that &quot;success is great, but fame is [...] something you don’t really want&quot;. Knopfler said: &quot;I had an absolute ball for as long as it lasted, until it got so big that I didn&#x27;t know the names of all the roadies [...] It got so big, we were actually leapfrogging stages [running duplicate convoys of equipment].&quot;

Dire Straits remains one of the most popular British rock bands as well as one of the world&#x27;s most commercially successful artists, with total worldwide album sales of more than 120 million.

<text>Walt Disney Pictures is an American film production company and subsidiary of the Walt Disney Studios, a division of Disney Entertainment, which is owned by the Walt Disney Company. The studio is the flagship producer of live-action feature films and animation within the Walt Disney Studios unit and is based at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. Animated films produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar Animation Studios are also released under the studio banner. Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures distributes and markets the films produced by Walt Disney Pictures.

Disney began producing live-action films in the 1950s. The live-action division became Walt Disney Pictures in 1983, when Disney reorganized its entire studio division, which included the separation from the feature animation division and the subsequent creation of Touchstone Pictures. At the end of that decade, combined with Touchstone&#x27;s output, Walt Disney Pictures elevated Disney to one of Hollywood&#x27;s major film studios.

Walt Disney Pictures is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongside Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, and Searchlight Pictures. &quot;Inside Out 2&quot; is the studio&#x27;s highest-grossing release overall with $1.6 billion, and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; is the studio&#x27;s most successful commercial film franchise, with five films earning a total of over $4.5 billion in worldwide box office gross.

== History ==
=== Predecessor unit ===

The studio&#x27;s predecessor (and the modern-day the Walt Disney Company&#x27;s as a whole) was founded as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, by filmmaker Walt Disney and his business partner and brother, Roy, in 1923.

The creation of Mickey Mouse and subsequent short films and merchandise generated revenue for the studio, which was renamed as The Walt Disney Studio at the Hyperion Studio in 1926. In 1929, it was renamed again to Walt Disney Productions. The studio&#x27;s streak of success continued in the 1930s, culminating with the 1937 release of the first feature-length animated film, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, which becomes a huge financial success. With the profits from &quot;Snow White&quot;, Walt relocated to a third studio in Burbank, California.

In the 1940s, Disney began experimenting with full-length live-action films, with the introduction of hybrid live action-animated films such as &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot; (1941) and &quot;Song of the South&quot; (1946). That same decade, the studio began producing nature documentaries with the release of &quot;Seal Island&quot; (1948), the first of the &quot;True-Life Adventures&quot; series and a subsequent Academy Award winner for Best Live-Action Short Film.

Walt Disney Productions had its first fully live-action film in 1950 with the release of &quot;Treasure Island&quot;&quot;,&quot; considered by Disney to be the official conception for what would eventually evolve into the modern-day Walt Disney Pictures. By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors as RKO Radio Pictures and United Artists and formed their own distribution company, Buena Vista Distribution. By the 1950s, the company had purchased the rights to the work of L. Frank Baum.

=== 1980s–2000s ===

The live-action division of Walt Disney Productions was incorporated as Walt Disney Pictures on April 1, 1983, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases. In April 1983, Richard Berger was hired by Disney CEO Ron W. Miller as film president. Touchstone Films was started by Miller in February 1984 as a label for the studio&#x27;s PG-13 and R-rated films with an expected half of Disney&#x27;s yearly 6-to-8-movie slate, which would be released under the label. That same year, newly named Disney CEO Michael Eisner pushed out Berger, replacing him with Eisner&#x27;s own film chief from Paramount Pictures, Jeffrey Katzenberg. and Frank Wells from Warner Bros. Pictures. Touchstone and Hollywood Pictures were formed within that unit on February 15, 1984, and February 1, 1989, respectively.

The Touchstone Films banner was used by then-new Disney CEO Michael Eisner in the 1984–1985 television season with the short-lived western, &quot;Wildside&quot;. In the next season, Touchstone produced a hit in &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;.

David Hoberman was promoted to president of production at Walt Disney Pictures in April 1988. In April 1994, Hoberman was promoted to president of motion picture production at Walt Disney Studios, and David Vogel was appointed as Walt Disney Pictures president. The following year, however, Hoberman resigned from the company and instead began a production deal with Disney and his newly formed production company, Mandeville Films. In addition to Walt Disney Pictures, Vogel added the head position of Hollywood Pictures in 1997, while Donald De Line remained as head of Touchstone. Vogel was then promoted in 1998 to the head of Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, the newly formed division that oversaw all live-action production within the Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone, and Hollywood labels. The move was orchestrated by Walt Disney Studios chairman Joe Roth, as an effort to scale back and consolidate the studio&#x27;s film production. As a result of the restructuring, De Line resigned.
That same year, Nina Jacobson became executive vice-president of live-action production for Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group. Jacobson remained under this title until May 1999, when Vogel resigned from the company, and Jacobson was appointed by Roth to the role of president of production. During her tenure, Jacobson oversaw the production of films at Walt Disney Pictures, including &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean, The Chronicles of Narnia, Bridge to Terabithia, National Treasure,&quot; &quot;Remember the Titans&quot;, and &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;&quot;,&quot; and was responsible for establishing a first-look deal with Jerry Bruckheimer Films. In 2006, Jacobson was fired by studio chairman Dick Cook, and replaced by Oren Aviv, the head of marketing. In July 2007, Disney CEO Bob Iger banned the depiction of smoking and tobacco products from Walt Disney Pictures films.

After two films based on Disney theme park attractions, Walt Disney Pictures selected it as a source of a line of films starting with &quot;The Country Bears&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Haunted Mansion&quot; and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; (both 2003). The latter film—the first film produced by the studio to receive a PG-13 rating—began a film series that was followed by four sequels, with the franchise taking in more than $5.4 billion worldwide from 2003 to 2017. On January 12, 2010, Aviv stepped down as the studio&#x27;s president of live-action production.

=== 2010s–present ===
In January 2010, Sean Bailey was appointed the studio&#x27;s president of live-action production, replacing Aviv. Bailey had produced &quot;&quot; for the studio, which was released later that same year. Under Bailey&#x27;s leadership and with support from then Disney CEO Bob Iger—and later studio chairman Alan Horn—Walt Disney Pictures pursued a tent-pole film strategy, which included an expanded slate of original and adaptive large-budget tentpole films. Beginning in 2011, the studio simplified the branding in its production logo and marquee credits to just &quot;Disney&quot;. Concurrently, Disney was struggling with PG-13 tentpole films outside of the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; series, with films such as &quot;John Carter&quot; (2012) and &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; (2013) becoming some of the biggest box-office bombs of all time. However, the studio had found particular success with live-action fantasy adaptations of properties associated with their animated films, which began with the commercial success of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (2010), that became the second billion-dollar-grossing film in the studio&#x27;s history. With the continued success of &quot;Maleficent&quot; (2014) and &quot;Cinderella&quot; (2015), the studio saw the potential in these fantasy adaptations and officiated a trend of similar films, which followed with &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (2016) and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (2017). In March 2015, Iger expanded the studio&#x27;s smoking and tobacco prohibition to include all films released by the studio—including PG-13 rated films and below—unless such depictions are historically pertinent.

Despite the acclaim and commercial success of several smaller-budgeted genre films throughout the 2010s, such as &quot;The Muppets&quot; (2011), &quot;Saving Mr. Banks&quot; (2013), and &quot;Into the Woods&quot; (2014), Walt Disney Pictures shifted its production model entirely on tent-pole films as they had found that a majority of the smaller genre films were becoming financially unsustainable in the theatrical market. By July 2016, Disney had announced development of nearly eighteen films consisting of sequels to existing adaptations, origin stories and prequels.

In 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced it was creating its own streaming service platform. The new service, known as Disney+, would feature original programming created by the company&#x27;s vast array of film and television production studios, including Walt Disney Pictures. As part of this new distribution platform, Bailey and Horn confirmed that Walt Disney Pictures would renew development on smaller-budgeted genre films that the studio had previously stopped producing for the theatrical exhibition market a few years prior. In 2018, nine films were announced to be in production or development for the service. These films would be budgeted between $20 million and $60 million. The studio was expected to produce approximately 3–4 films per year exclusively for Disney+, alongside its theatrical tentpole slate. Disney+ was launched on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, with subsequent international expansions. Within the first two months of the service&#x27;s launch, Walt Disney Pictures had released three films (&quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot;, &quot;Noelle,&quot; and &quot;Togo&quot;) exclusively for Disney+.

On March 12, 2020, 20th Century Family president Vanessa Morrison was named president of live-action development and production of streaming content for both Disney and 20th Century Studios, reporting directly to Bailey. That same day, Philip Steuer and Randi Hiller were also appointed as president of the studio&#x27;s physical, post-production and VFX, and executive vice president for casting, respectively–overseeing these functions for both Walt Disney Pictures and 20th Century Studios. In 2023, Walt Disney Pictures celebrated its centennial alongside Walt Disney Animation Studios and their corporate parent company as a whole. That same year, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny&quot; marked the studio&#x27;s first official co-production with Lucasfilm.

On February 26, 2024, Disney announced a leadership change, with Bailey stepping down as president and replaced by David Greenbaum, who formerly co-led Searchlight Pictures. Greenbaum will lead Walt Disney Pictures and co-lead 20th Century Studios with current 20th Century president Steve Asbell. On February 19, 2025, Daria Cercek joined the studio as president of theatrical.

== Logo ==
Until 1983, instead of a traditional production logo, the opening credits of Disney films used to feature a title card that read &quot;Walt Disney Presents&quot;, and later, &quot;Walt Disney Productions Presents&quot;.

Beginning with the release of &quot;Return to Oz&quot; in 1985, Walt Disney Pictures introduced its fantasy castle logo. The version with its accompanying music premiered with &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;. The logo was created by Walt Disney Productions in traditional animation and featured a white silhouette of Disneyland&#x27;s Sleeping Beauty Castle against a blue background, with the studio&#x27;s name in Walt Disney&#x27;s signature style and underscored by &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot;, in arrangement composed by John Debney. A short rendition of the logo was used as a closing logo as well as in the movie &quot;Return to Oz&quot;, although the film was released months before &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; was released. An animated RenderMan variant appeared before every Pixar Animation Studios film from &quot;Toy Story&quot; until &quot;Ratatouille&quot;, featuring an original fanfare composed by Randy Newman, based on the opening score cue from &quot;Toy Story&quot;, called &quot;Andy&#x27;s Birthday&quot;. Beginning with &quot;Dinosaur&quot; (2000), an alternative logo featuring an orange castle and logo against a black background, was occasionally presented with darker tone and live-action films, though a few animated films such as &quot;Brother Bear&quot;, the 2003 re-release of &quot;The Lion King&quot; and &quot;The Wild&quot; (the final film to use this logo) used this logo.

In 2006, the studio&#x27;s vanity card logo was updated with the release of &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; at the behest of then-Walt Disney Studios chairman Dick Cook and studio marketing president Oren Aviv. Designed by Disney animation director Mike Gabriel and producer Baker Bloodworth, the modernized logo was created completely in computer animation by Wētā FX and yU+co and featured a 3D Walt Disney logo. The final rendering of the logo was done by Cameron Smith and Cyrese Parrish. In addition, the revamped logo includes visual references to &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;Dumbo&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;Peter Pan&quot; and &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, and its redesigned castle incorporates elements from both the Cinderella Castle and the Sleeping Beauty Castle, as well as fireworks and Walt Disney&#x27;s family crest on the flag. Mark Mancina wrote a new composition and arrangement of &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; to accompany the 2006 logo. It was co-arranged and orchestrated by David Metzger. In 2011, starting with &quot;The Muppets&quot;, the sequence was modified to truncate the &quot;Walt Disney Pictures&quot; branding to &quot;Disney&quot;, which has mainly been used originally in home media releases in 2007. The new logo sequence has been consistently modified for high-profile releases including &quot;&quot;, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&quot;, &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot;, &quot;Maleficent&quot;, &quot;Tomorrowland&quot;, &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.

In 2022, a new vanity card logo was introduced for the studio&#x27;s 100th anniversary in 2023, which premiered at the 2022 D23 Expo. The new castle logo features an updated opening sequence in computer animation created by Industrial Light &amp; Magic and an arrangement of &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; composed by Christophe Beck and conducted by Tim Davies. The magical arc that usually flies from right to left above the castle now flies from left to right. A byline appeared below the Disney100 logo during the studio&#x27;s 100th anniversary in 2023, reading &quot;100 Years of Wonder&quot;, which was later removed starting with &quot;Chang Can Dunk&quot; but returned with the international prints of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny&quot; in theaters. While containing the same visual references as the previous logo, new references added to it include &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, &quot;Up&quot;, &quot;Hercules&quot;, &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, &quot;Tangled&quot;, &quot;Brave&quot; and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, with the addition of Disneyland&#x27;s Matterhorn from &quot;Third Man on the Mountain&quot; and Pride Rock from &quot;The Lion King&quot; in the background beyond the castle. Its first film appearance was with the release of &quot;Strange World&quot;. The logo received widespread praise from critics and audiences and won Gold in the &quot;Theatrical | Film: Design&quot; medium at the 2023 Clio Entertainment Awards in November 2023. The standard version of the logo premiered theatrically with &quot;The Beach Boys&quot;.

<doc id="172902" wikidata="Q1341482" url="?curid=172902" title="OpenEXR">
<text>OpenEXR is a high-dynamic range, multi-channel raster file format, released as an open standard along with a set of software tools created by Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), under a free software license similar to the BSD license.

It is notable for supporting multiple channels of potentially different pixel sizes, including 32-bit unsigned integer, 32-bit and 16-bit floating point values, as well as various compression techniques which include lossless and lossy compression algorithms. It also has arbitrary channels and encodes multiple points of view such as left- and right-camera images.

==Overview==
A full technical introduction of the format is available on the OpenEXR website.

OpenEXR, or EXR for short, is a deep raster format developed by ILM and broadly used in the computer-graphics industry, both visual effects and animation.

OpenEXR&#x27;s multi-resolution and arbitrary channel format makes it appealing for compositing, as it alleviates several painful elements of the process. Since it can store arbitrary channels—specular, diffuse, alpha, RGB, normals, and various other types—in one file, it takes away the need to store this information in separate files. The multi-channel concept also reduces the necessity to &quot;bake&quot; in the aforementioned data to the final image. If a compositor is not happy with the current level of specularity, they can adjust that specific channel.

OpenEXR&#x27;s API makes tools development a relative ease for developers. Since there are almost never two identical production pipelines, custom tools always need to be developed to address problems (e.g. image-manipulation issue). OpenEXR&#x27;s library allows quick and easy access to the image&#x27;s attributes such as tiles and channels.

The OpenEXR library is developed in C++ and is available in source format as well as compiled format for Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux. Python bindings for the library are also available for version 2.x.

===History===
OpenEXR was created by ILM in 1999 and released to the public in 2003 along with an open source software library. It soon received wide adoption by software used in computer graphics, particularly for film and television production. The format has been updated several times, adding support for tiles, mipmaps, new compression methods, and other features. In 2007, OpenEXR was honored with an Academy Award for Technical Achievement.

OpenEXR 2.0 was released in April 2013, extending the format with support for deep image buffers and multiple images embedded in a single file. Version 2.2, released August 2014, added the lossy DWA compression format.

==Distribution==
The OpenEXR software distribution includes:
* libraries
* Half, a C++ class for manipulating half values as if they were a built-in C++ data type
* exrdisplay, a sample application for viewing OpenEXR images on a display at various exposure settings

===Libraries===
* = library made by Industrial Light &amp; Magic (Ilm) for low-level operations on the files with OpenEXR image format (Imf)
** on linux
** on windows
* 

==Color depth==
OpenEXR has support for color depth using:
* 16-bit floating-point (half)
* 32-bit floating-point
* 32-bit unsigned integer

==Compression methods==
There are three general types of lossless compression built into OpenEXR, with two different methods of Zip compressing. For most images without a lot of grain, the two Zip compression methods seem to work best, while the PIZ compression algorithm is better suited to grainy images. The following options are available:

; None: Disables all compression.
; Run Length Encoding (RLE): This is a basic form of compression that is comparable to that used by standard Targa files.
; Zip (per scanline): deflate compression with zlib wrapper applied to individual scanlines (not based on the ZIP file format despite its name).
; Zip (16 scanline blocks): deflate compression applied to blocks of 16 scanlines at time. This tends to be the most effective style of compression to use with rendered images that do not have film grain applied.
; PIZ (wavelet compression): This lossless method uses a new combined wavelet / Huffman compression. This form of compression is quite effective when dealing with grainy images, and will often surpass any of the other options under grainy conditions.
; PXR24 (24-bit data conversion then deflate compression): This form of compression from Pixar Animation Studios converts 32-bit floats to 24 bits then uses deflate compression. It is lossless for half and 32-bit integer data and slightly lossy for 32-bit float data.
; B44: This form of compression is lossy for half data and stores 32-bit data uncompressed. It maintains a fixed compression size of either 2.28:1 or 4.57:1 and is designed for realtime playback. B44 compresses uniformly regardless of image content. 
; B44A: An extension to B44 where areas of flat color are further compressed, such as alpha channels.
; DWAA: JPEG-like lossy compression format contributed by DreamWorks Animation. Compresses 32 scanlines together.
; DWAB: Same as DWAA, but compresses blocks of 256 scanlines.

==Credits==
From OpenEXR.org&#x27;s Technical Introduction:

The ILM OpenEXR file format was designed and implemented by Florian Kainz, Wojciech Jarosz, and Rod Bogart. The PIZ compression scheme is based on an algorithm by Christian Rouet. Josh Pines helped extend the PIZ algorithm for 16-bit and found optimizations for the float-to-half conversions. Drew Hess packaged and adapted ILM&#x27;s internal source code for public release and maintains the OpenEXR software distribution. The PXR24 compression method is based on an algorithm written by Loren Carpenter at Pixar Animation Studios.

<doc id="172905" wikidata="Q81589" url="?curid=172905" title="House of Windsor">
<text>The House of Windsor is the reigning house of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms. The house&#x27;s name was inspired by the historic Windsor Castle estate. The house was founded on 17 July 1917, when King George V changed the name of the royal house from the German Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the English Windsor due to anti-German sentiment during the First World War. There have been five British monarchs of the House of Windsor: George V, Edward VIII, George VI, Elizabeth II, and Charles III. The children and male-line descendants of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, also genealogically belong to the House of Oldenburg since Philip was by birth a member of the Glücksburg branch of that house. 

The monarch is head of state of fifteen sovereign states. These are the United Kingdom, Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, The Bahamas, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu. As well as these separate monarchies, there are also three Crown Dependencies, fourteen British Overseas Territories, two associated states of New Zealand, and one territory.

==History==
In 1701, succession to the throne was given to Sophia of Hanover, who was born into the House of Wittelsbach, married into the House of Hanover, and was a granddaughter of James VI and I of the House of Stuart. Succession was passed to her son who became George I in 1714, marking the start of a long ruling period by the Hanoverian royal house. Eventually in 1901, a line of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha succeeded the House of Hanover to the British monarchy with the accession of King Edward VII, son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In 1917, the name of the British royal house was changed from the German &quot;Saxe-Coburg and Gotha&quot; to the English &quot;Windsor&quot;, taking its name from the royal residence in Berkshire.
King Edward VII and, in turn, his son, George V, were members of the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha branch of the House of Wettin by virtue of their descent from Albert, Prince Consort, husband of Queen Victoria, the last British monarch from the House of Hanover. High anti-German sentiment amongst the people of the British Empire during the First World War reached a peak in March 1917, when the Gotha G.IV, a heavy aircraft capable of crossing the English Channel, began bombing London directly and became a household name. In the same year, on 15 March, King George&#x27;s first cousin Emperor Nicholas II of Russia was forced to abdicate, which raised the spectre of the eventual abolition of all the monarchies in Europe. The king and his family were finally persuaded to abandon all titles held under the German Crown and to change German titles and house names to anglicised versions. Hence, on 17 July 1917, a royal proclamation issued by George V declared:

The name had a long association with monarchy in Britain, through the town of Windsor, Berkshire, and Windsor Castle. It was suggested by Arthur Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham. Upon hearing that his cousin had changed the name of the British royal house to Windsor and in reference to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, German Emperor Wilhelm II remarked jokingly that he planned to see &quot;The Merry Wives of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha&quot;.

George V also restricted the use of British princely titles to his nearest relations, and in 1919, he stripped three of his German relations of their British titles and styles under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917.

The children and male-line descendants of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip also genealogically belong to the House of Oldenburg since Philip was by birth a member of the Glücksburg branch of that house.

==List of monarchs==



== Members ==
The 1917 proclamation stated that the name of the Royal House and all British descendants of Victoria and Albert in the male line were to bear the name of Windsor, except for women who married into other families.

===Descendants of Elizabeth II===
In 1947, Princess Elizabeth (who would become Queen Elizabeth II), heir presumptive to King George VI, married Philip Mountbatten (born Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark), a member of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, a branch of the House of Oldenburg. A few months before his marriage, Philip abandoned his princely titles and adopted the surname &quot;Mountbatten&quot;, which was that of his maternal uncle and mentor, Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, and had itself been adopted by Lord Mountbatten&#x27;s father (Philip&#x27;s maternal grandfather), Prince Louis of Battenberg, in 1917. It is the literal translation of the German &quot;Battenberg&quot;, which refers to Battenberg, a small town in Hesse.

Soon after Elizabeth became Queen in 1952, Lord Mountbatten observed that because it was the standard practice for the wife in a marriage to adopt her husband&#x27;s surname, the &quot;House of Mountbatten&quot; now reigned. When Elizabeth&#x27;s grandmother, Queen Mary, heard of this comment, she informed British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and he later advised the Queen to issue a royal proclamation declaring that the royal house was to remain known as the House of Windsor.
This she did on 9 April 1952, officially declaring it her &quot;Will and Pleasure that I and My children shall be styled and known as the House and Family of Windsor, and that My descendants, other than female descendants who marry and their descendants, shall bear the name of Windsor.&quot; Philip privately complained, &quot;I am nothing but a bloody amoeba. I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.&quot;

On 8 February 1960, some years after both the death of Queen Mary and the resignation of Churchill, the Queen confirmed that she and her children would continue to be known as the &quot;House and Family of Windsor&quot;, as would any agnatic descendants (through the male line of succession, or patrilineality) who enjoy the style of Royal Highness and the title of prince or princess. Still, Elizabeth also decreed that her agnatic descendants who do not have that style and title would bear the surname Mountbatten-Windsor.

This came after some months of correspondence between the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and the constitutional expert Edward Iwi. Iwi had raised the prospect that the royal child due to be born in February 1960 would bear &quot;the Badge of Bastardy&quot; if it were given its mother&#x27;s maiden name (Windsor) rather than its father&#x27;s name (Mountbatten). Macmillan had attempted to rebuff Iwi, until the Queen advised Rab Butler in January 1960 that for some time she had her heart set on a change that would recognise the name, Mountbatten. She wished to make this change before the birth of her child. The issue did not affect Prince Charles or Princess Anne, as they had been born Mountbatten before the Queen&#x27;s accession to the throne. Prince Andrew was born 11 days later, on 19 February 1960.

Any future monarch can change the dynastic name through a similar royal proclamation, as the royal prerogative in the United Kingdom covers it.

==States reigned over==
At the creation of the House of Windsor, its head reigned over the British Empire. Following the end of the First World War, however, shifts took place that saw the emergence of the Dominions of the British Commonwealth as independent states. The shift was recognised in the Balfour Declaration of 1926, the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927, and the Statute of Westminster 1931. The Windsors became recognised as the royal family of multiple independent countries, a number that shifted over the decades, as some Dominions became republics and Crown colonies became realms, republics, or monarchies under a different sovereign. Since 1949, three monarchs of the House of Windsor, George VI, Elizabeth II and Charles III, have also been Head of the Commonwealth of Nations, comprising most parts of the former British Empire and some states that were never part of it.

<doc id="172907" wikidata="Q1064017" url="?curid=172907" title="Monkey's Audio">
<text>Monkey&#x27;s Audio is an algorithm and file format for lossless audio data compression. Lossless data compression does not discard data during the process of encoding, unlike lossy compression methods such as Advanced Audio Coding, MP3, Vorbis, and Opus. Similar to other lossless audio codecs, files encoded to Monkey&#x27;s Audio are typically reduced to about half of the original size, with data transfer time and storage requirements being reduced accordingly.

==Comparisons==
Like any lossless compression scheme, Monkey&#x27;s Audio format takes up several times as much space as lossy compression formats - typically, about twice as much as a 320 kbit/s bitrate MP3 file. The upside is that no data is lost compared to the input file, making lossless codecs suitable for transcoding, or simply taking up approximately half as much space as raw PCM data.

Relative to FLAC, Apple Lossless Audio Codec, or WavPack, Monkey&#x27;s Audio is slow to encode or decode files.

While Monkey&#x27;s Audio can achieve high compression ratios, the cost is a dramatic increase in requirements on the decoding end. Many older portable media players, and even older smartphones, have difficulty handling this. In comparison, most lossless codecs are asymmetric, meaning that the work done to achieve higher compression ratios, if selected by the user, slows down the encoding process, but has essentially no effect on the decoding requirements.

==Licensing==

On 10 August 2023, with the release of version 10.18, Monkey&#x27;s Audio switched to the Open Source Initiative-approved 3-Clause BSD Licence.

Other lossless codecs such as FLAC and WavPack are also available under open source licences, and are well supported in Linux distributions and in many applications. Since all of these formats are lossless, users can transcode between formats without generation loss.

==Supported platforms==
Officially, Monkey&#x27;s Audio is available for the Microsoft Windows platform. As of version 4.02 (19 January 2009) a DirectShow filter is distributed with the installer, allowing for compatibility with most media players running on the Windows operating system.

Monkey&#x27;s Audio is also supported on Linux and OS X using JRiver Media Center or Plex.

A GPL-licensed version of the Monkey&#x27;s Audio decoder has been independently written for Rockbox and is included in FFmpeg. This code also provides playback support in applications that use GStreamer, as well as DeaDBeeF.

A number of players and rippers support the format as well.
It is also available as a port and package on FreeBSD.

Monkey&#x27;s Audio files can be encoded and decoded on any platform which has a J2SE implementation, by the means of the unofficial JMAC library, which is free software licensed under the GNU LGPL.

===Hardware support===

Monkey&#x27;s Audio is supported natively on all modern Cowon multimedia media players, the FiiO X Series and some Cayin digital audio players.

On other hardware platforms, the open source firmware project Rockbox supports playback of Monkey&#x27;s Audio files on most of its supported targets, but many lack sufficient processing power to play them on the higher compression settings.

<text>Peter Kenneth Frampton (born 22 April 1950) is an English-American guitarist, singer, and songwriter who rose to prominence as a member of the rock bands the Herd and Humble Pie. Later in his career, Frampton found significant success as a solo artist. He has released several albums, including his breakthrough album, the live recording &quot;Frampton Comes Alive!&quot; (1976), which spawned several hit singles and has been certified 8× Platinum by the RIAA in the United States. He has also worked with various other acts such as Ringo Starr, John Entwistle of the Who, David Bowie, Joe Bonamassa, and both Matt Cameron and Mike McCready of Pearl Jam.

Frampton is known for his signature hit songs &quot;Show Me the Way&quot;, &quot;Baby, I Love Your Way&quot;, &quot;Do You Feel Like We Do&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m in You&quot;, all of which remain staples of classic rock radio. He has also appeared as himself in television shows such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, and &quot;Madam Secretary&quot;. Frampton was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2024.

==Early life==
Peter Kenneth Frampton was born to Owen Frampton and Peggy (née ) Frampton in Beckenham, Kent. He attended Bromley Technical High School, at which his father was a teacher and the head of the Art department. He first became interested in music when he was seven years old. Having discovered his grandmother&#x27;s banjolele in the attic, he taught himself to play it, going on to later teach himself how to play guitar and piano as well. At the age of eight, he began taking classical music lessons.

Frampton was influenced by late 1950s and early 1960s rock acts such as Cliff Richard and the Shadows, Buddy Holly, Eddie Cochran and later the Ventures, Jimi Hendrix and the Beatles. His father introduced him to the recordings of French gypsy jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt.

==Music career==
===Early career===
By the age of 12, Frampton played in a band called the Little Ravens. Both he and David Bowie, who was three years older, were pupils at Bromley Technical School, where Frampton&#x27;s father was Bowie&#x27;s art teacher. The Little Ravens played on the same bill at school as Bowie&#x27;s band, George and the Dragons. Peter and David would spend lunch breaks together, playing Buddy Holly songs.

At the age of 14, Peter was playing with a band called the Trubeats followed by a band called the Preachers, who later became Moon&#x27;s Train, produced and managed by Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones. Frampton&#x27;s parents were at the time concerned about their son playing regular late night gigs whilst still at school, so Alex Brown, a member of The Preachers, was designated to meet his parents at their house, along with his son Steven, to show that the band members were responsible people. After this meeting, Frampton was allowed to join the band.

Frampton became a successful child singer, and in 1966 he became a member of the Herd. He was the lead guitarist and singer, scoring several British pop hits. Frampton was named &quot;The Face of 1968&quot; by teen magazine &quot;Rave&quot;.

In 1969, when Frampton was 18 years old, he joined Steve Marriott of the Small Faces to form Humble Pie.

While playing with Humble Pie, Frampton also did session recording with other artists, including: George Harrison, Harry Nilsson, Jerry Lee Lewis, and John Entwistle&#x27;s &quot;Whistle Rymes&quot; in 1972. During a recording session with George Harrison at Abbey Road Studios in London in 1970, Pete Drake introduced him to the &quot;talk box&quot; that was to become one of his trademark guitar effects.

===Solo career===
After four studio albums and one live album with Humble Pie, Frampton left the band and went solo in 1971, just in time to see &quot;Rockin&#x27; the Fillmore&quot; rise up the US charts. He remained with Dee Anthony (1926–2009), the same personal manager that Humble Pie had used.

Frampton&#x27;s own debut was 1972&#x27;s &quot;Wind of Change&quot;, with guest artists Ringo Starr and Billy Preston. This album was followed by &quot;Frampton&#x27;s Camel&quot; in 1973, which featured Frampton working within a group project. In 1974, Frampton released &quot;Somethin&#x27;s Happening&quot;. Frampton toured extensively to support his solo career, joined for three years by his former Herd mate Andy Bown on keyboards, Rick Wills on bass, and American drummer John Siomos. In 1975, the &quot;Frampton&quot; album was released. The album went to No. 32 in the US charts and is certified Gold by the RIAA.

Frampton had little commercial success with his early albums. This changed with his best-selling live album, &quot;Frampton Comes Alive!&quot;, in 1976, from which &quot;Baby, I Love Your Way&quot;, &quot;Show Me the Way&quot;, and an edited version of &quot;Do You Feel Like We Do&quot;, were hit singles. The latter two tracks also featured his use of the talk box guitar effect. The album was recorded in 1975, mainly at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, California, where Humble Pie had previously enjoyed a good following. Frampton had a new line-up, with Americans Bob Mayo on keyboards and rhythm guitar and Stanley Sheldon on bass. Wills had been sacked by Frampton at the end of 1974, and Bown had left on the eve of &quot;Frampton Comes Alive&quot;, to return to England and new fame with Status Quo. &quot;Frampton Comes Alive&quot; was released in early January, debuting on the charts on 14 February at number 191. The album was on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for 97 weeks, of which 55 were in the top 40, of which 10 were at the top. The album beat, among others, Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; to become the top selling album of 1976, and it was also the 14th best seller of 1977. The album won Frampton a Juno Award in 1977.

A tribute to the album&#x27;s staying power, readers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Frampton Comes Alive&quot; No. 3 in a 2012 poll of all-time favourite live albums. The article&#x27;s text stated, &quot;He was loved by teenage girls, &quot;and&quot; their older brothers. He owned the year 1976 like nobody else in rock.&quot; The success of &quot;Frampton Comes Alive!&quot; put him on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, in a famous shirtless photo by Francesco Scavullo. Frampton later said he regrets the photo because it changed his image as a credible artist into a teen idol.

In late 1976, Frampton and manager Dee Anthony visited the White House at the invitation of Steven Ford, the president&#x27;s son.

On 24 August 1979, Frampton received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6819 Hollywood Boulevard for his contributions to the recording industry.

=== Setbacks and decline in popularity ===
Frampton&#x27;s following album, &quot;I&#x27;m in You&quot; (1977), contained the hit title single and went platinum, but fell well short of expectations compared to &quot;Frampton Comes Alive!&quot;. He starred, with the Bee Gees, in producer Robert Stigwood&#x27;s poorly received film &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1978). Frampton&#x27;s career seemed to be falling as quickly as it had risen. He also played guitar on the title song of the 1978 film &quot;Grease&quot;, a song newly written for the film by Barry Gibb.

Frampton suffered a near-fatal car accident in the Bahamas in 1978 that marked the end of his prolific period and the beginning of a long period during which he was less successful. He returned in 1979 to record the album &quot;Where I Should Be&quot;. Among those contributing to the album were past band members Stanley Sheldon (bass), Bob Mayo (keyboards/guitar/vocals), and John Siomos (drums/vocals).

In 1980, Frampton&#x27;s album &quot;Rise Up&quot; was released to promote his tour in Brazil, although he suffered another serious setback that year when all his guitars were thought destroyed in a cargo plane crash that killed four people. Among the instruments he lost was the black Les Paul Custom which he had named &quot;Phenix&quot; (pictured on the cover of &quot;Frampton Comes Alive&quot;) given to him by Mark Mariana and first used on the night of the recording of the Humble Pie live album &quot;Performance&quot;, and which he had used all through his early solo career. The guitar was recovered and returned to him in December 2011. The album eventually turned into &quot;Breaking All the Rules&quot;, released the next year in 1981. These albums were the first he recorded almost completely live. In 1982, following the release of &quot;The Art of Control&quot;, Frampton tried unsuccessfully to split his ties with A&amp;M Records; he re-signed with the label in 2006 and released his Grammy Award–winning &quot;Fingerprints&quot;.

=== Return ===
Although his albums generally met with little commercial success, Frampton continued to record throughout the 1980s. He achieved a brief, moderate comeback of sorts in 1986 with the release of his &quot;Premonition&quot; album, and the single &quot;Lying&quot;, which became a hit on Mainstream Rock chart. Most notably, he also united with old friend David Bowie, and both worked together to make albums. Frampton played on Bowie&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; and sang and played on the accompanying Glass Spider Tour. In 2013, he credited his participation in this tour for helping revive his career.

Looking for the band experience again after touring with Bowie, Frampton kept referencing Steve Marriott, and at the beginning of 1991 rejoined his old Humble Pie mate for some shows (Marriott&#x27;s last English gigs) at the Half Moon in Putney, London. The chemistry was still there for a while, as both Frampton and Marriott laid down some tracks in L.A. and prepared to do a &quot;Frampton-Marriott&quot; tour. Marriott abruptly returned to England in April and he died in a house fire less than 24 hours after his return. Broken up by Marriott&#x27;s death, Frampton went off the road for a time, then reformed his old touring band with his old friends Bob Mayo and John Regan. At least three songs, and possibly a fourth, from the ended Marriott-Frampton partnership were subsequently recorded; two ending up on Frampton&#x27;s &quot;Shine On&quot; compilation, a third on his subsequent solo album.

In the late 1990s, Frampton starred in an infomercial plugging the eMedia Guitar Method, a piece of instructional software represented as an alternative to taking actual guitar lessons. He claimed in the infomercial that the software was the best way to learn guitar.

In 1994, Frampton wrote and released the album &quot;Peter Frampton&quot;, the final version of which contained material recorded on Tascam cassette recorders. Originally released on the Relativity label, this record was re-released in 2000 by Legacy Records, with four bonus tracks and additional notes by Frampton.

In 1995, Frampton released &quot;Frampton Comes Alive! II&quot;, which contained live versions of many of the songs from his 1980s and 1990s solo albums. &quot;Frampton Comes Alive! II&quot; was recorded at The Fillmore Theater on 15 June 1995. Although there was a large amount of marketing for the album, it did not sell well. After &quot;Frampton Comes Alive! II&quot;, he recorded and toured with Bill Wyman&#x27;s Rhythm Kings and Ringo Starr&#x27;s All-Starr Band, where he and Jack Bruce performed a cover version of Cream&#x27;s &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot;.
In 2003, Frampton released the album &quot;Now&quot;, and embarked on a tour with Styx to support it. It was on this tour in 2004 he lost good friend and long time bandmate Bob Mayo. He also toured with the Elms, and appeared in 2006 on the Fox variety show &quot;Celebrity Duets&quot;, paired with Chris Jericho of WWE fame. They were the first pair voted out.

On 12 September 2006, Frampton released an instrumental work titled &quot;Fingerprints&quot;. His band consisted of drummer Shawn Fichter, guitarist Audley Freed, bassist John Regan (Frampton&#x27;s lifelong best friend,), and keyboardist-guitarist Rob Arthur, and guest artists such as members of Pearl Jam, Hank Marvin, Warren Haynes and his bassist on &quot;Frampton Comes Alive!&quot;, Stanley Sheldon – the only member of the backing band on that album still alive.

=== 2007 to present ===
On 11 February 2007, &quot;Fingerprints&quot; was awarded the 2007 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Album. In February 2007, he also appeared on the Chicago-based PBS television show &quot;Soundstage&quot;.

Frampton released his 14th studio album, &quot;Thank You Mr. Churchill&quot;, on 27 April 2010. In summer 2010 he began touring North America with the English band Yes; the two acts had played stadium shows on a bill together in 1976. His 2010 band consisted of Rob Arthur (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), John Regan (bass), Adam Lester (guitar), and Dan Wojciechowski (drums).

Frampton embarked on a UK tour in March 2011 in support of his new album, visiting Leamington Spa, Glasgow, Manchester, London and Bristol.

Frampton went on tour in 2011 with The Frampton Comes Alive 35th Anniversary Tour that showcased and followed exactly the songs on the setlist for the original tour from 1976, recorded for &quot;Frampton Comes Alive!&quot; The concerts each night started with the prerecorded thump of a microphone being turned on, familiar to many fans of the album, followed by the recorded voice of Jerry Pompili saying, &quot;If there was ever a musician that was an honorary member of San Francisco society, Mr. Peter Frampton ...&quot;, and then the crowd goes wild. He played the album song-for-song at 69 locations between 15 June 2011 and 22 October 2011 throughout the US.

On 11 June 2011, Frampton performed a live set for &quot;Guitar Center Sessions&quot; on DirecTV. The episode included an interview with program host Nic Harcourt.

In 2013, Frampton performed throughout North America as part of the &quot;Frampton&#x27;s Guitar Circus&quot; tour which featured periodic guest performers including B.B. King, Robert Cray, Don Felder, Rick Derringer, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Steve Lukather, Sonny Landreth, Davy Knowles, David Hidalgo, Mike McCready, Roger McGuinn and Vinnie Moore.

On 9 February 2014, Frampton was one of several musicians to participate in &quot;The Night That Changed America: A Grammy Salute to The Beatles&quot;, a tribute to the Beatles on the 50th anniversary of their first appearance on American television.

On 23 June 2014, Frampton released a new album entitled &quot;Hummingbird in a Box&quot;.

On 11 June 2015, Frampton announced his new studio album, &quot;Acoustic Classics&quot;; then, on 14 January 2016, he launched the first song: a version of &quot;Do You Feel Like I Do&quot;.

In 2016, Frampton was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum.

In 2017 and 2018, Frampton toured with the Steve Miller Band, opening the show.

On 22 February 2019, Frampton announced he would be retiring from touring with his &#x27;Peter Frampton Finale—The Farewell Tour&#x27; commencing on 18 June 2019 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, running through 12 October ending in Concord, California at the Concord Pavilion. The tour featured special guest Jason Bonham&#x27;s Led Zeppelin Evening, as well as Peter&#x27;s son Julian Frampton on the West Coast stops. He also revealed the reason for the farewell tour; he received a diagnosis of inclusion body myositis (IBM), a progressive muscle disorder characterised by muscle inflammation, weakness, and atrophy (wasting). A dollar of every ticket sold for the tour was donated to benefit Frampton&#x27;s myositis research fund established at Johns Hopkins, where he was treated.

In June 2019, Frampton&#x27;s album &quot;All Blues&quot; debuted at number one in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Blues Albums Chart.

In December 2019, Frampton announced his farewell UK tour to consist of five performances in May 2020. In April this UK/EU tour was cancelled &quot;because of the COVID-19 virus&quot;. In November 2022 Frampton resumed his &quot;Finale, the Farewell Tour&quot; with three dates in the UK (Stoke, Glasgow, London) and five more in the rest of Europe, then one concert at Joe Satriani&#x27;s workshop in Las Vegas, announcing in advance that he would be seated on stage during these performances. &quot;Standing&quot;, he told &quot;Guitar World&quot; in September 2022, &quot;would be dangerous for me now, because I get so carried away when I&#x27;m playing that I&#x27;m liable to fall over&quot;. Of how the disease is affecting his ability to actually play the guitar, Frampton continued, &quot;It&#x27;s starting to affect my hands, but not enough yet, so I can still play a good lick. But I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;m anxious about it.&quot;

On 6 August 2022, Frampton came out of retirement for one night to perform during &quot;Buddy Holly&#x27;s 85th Birthday Celebration&quot; at the Buddy Holly Hall of Performing Arts and Sciences in Lubbock, Texas. &quot;I sat down for the first time ever on stage,&quot; he told &quot;Guitar World&quot; later. &quot;And it felt very comfortable [laughs]. Better than leaning on a piano.&quot;

As of 2023, Frampton embarked on the &quot;Never Say Never&quot; tour. Frampton has noted that he did not expect to be able to play again as a result of his diagnosis. He has stated that while his fingers do not work as well as they used to, they worked better than he thought they would, citing it as reason enough to keep doing what he loved on stage.

In 2024, Frampton contributed guitar to a re-release of Mark Knopfler&#x27;s &quot;Going Home: Theme of the Local Hero&quot; in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust.

On 19 October 2024, Frampton was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by his long-time friend Roger Daltrey. Frampton performed at the ceremony with Keith Urban.

Crudup is quoted as saying, &quot;Who could ask for a better tutor than Peter Frampton?&quot; As an inside joke, he also appears briefly in the film as &quot;Reg&quot;, a road manager for Humble Pie, Frampton&#x27;s real-life former band.

In 2001, Frampton appeared as himself in &quot;Drew Carey&#x27;s Back-to-School Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Comedy Hour&quot;, in which he performed &quot;You Had To Be There&quot; and appeared in a brief scene with Mimi, in which he recalls their past relationship.

On 20 December 2006, Frampton appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;. Stephen Colbert had a fake feud with the Decemberists to be decided by a head cutting duel.

==Personal life==
===Marriages, other relationships and family===
Frampton has been married three times and has three children. His first marriage was to Mary Lovett, from 1972 to 1976.

Frampton was sued by J. &quot;Penny&quot; McCall in 1978 for palimony. McCall asked for Frampton&#x27;s earnings during the five years that they were together. According to McCall, she left her husband and gave up her job as a rock promoter and devoted herself full-time to Frampton, just as he achieved superstar status. A New York judge ruled that Frampton and McCall never intended to marry each other and &quot;never held themselves out to the public as husband and wife&quot; and dismissed her complaint because to act otherwise would condone adultery. The case set precedent in New York.

From 1983 to 1993, Frampton was married to Barbara Gold, with whom he had two children named Jade and Julian. The latter co-wrote and sang on Frampton&#x27;s song &quot;Road to the Sun&quot; from &quot;Thank You Mr. Churchill&quot;.

Frampton&#x27;s third marriage was on 13 January 1996 to Tina Elfers, with whom he had a daughter, actress Mia Frampton, and a stepdaughter named Tiffany Wiest. Frampton filed for divorce from Elfers in Los Angeles, California, on 22 June 2011, citing irreconcilable differences.

===Other===
In June 1978, Frampton was involved in a near-fatal car accident in the Bahamas and suffered broken bones, a concussion, and muscle damage. Dealing with the pain of the accident led to a brief period of drug abuse.

Frampton has lived in London and various U.S. locations, including Westchester County, New York; Los Angeles; and Nashville, Tennessee. He moved to Indian Hill, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati, in June 2000. This is the birthplace of his ex-wife Elfers, and the city in which they were married in 1996. They chose to live there to be closer to Elfers&#x27; family. In 2014, Frampton moved back to Nashville.

Frampton cited the September 11 attacks as his reason for obtaining American citizenship, saying he wanted to begin voting in U.S. elections.

On 20 October 2020, Frampton published his memoir &quot;Do You Feel Like I Do?&quot;, co-written with Alan Light.

In December 2022, it was announced BMG had acquired the rights to Frampton&#x27;s catalogue.

In 2024, Frampton and his son Julian appeared on the January 31 episode of &quot;We Are Family&quot; game show hosted by Anthony Anderson.

=== Health ===
Frampton is a vegetarian. He sobered up in 2002 with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous, which he says saved his life. Since 2019, Frampton has been &quot;living with&quot; the muscle-wasting disease known as IBM. He has continued to perform, confirming 2025 tour dates. Of his health issues he says:

As to people asking if he&#x27;s depressed with his condition, he responds, &quot;you have to accept the things you cannot change. I learned that in A.A., and in many other places. . What I have is not life-threatening, thank God, but it’s life-changing, and I’m going with the flow.”

==Equipment==
On the cover of the double live album &quot;Frampton Comes Alive&quot;, Frampton plays a highly customized 1954 black Gibson Les Paul Custom that was given to him during a concert by his friend, Marc Mariana. While touring in 1980, the guitar and other instruments and stage equipment were placed on a cargo flight from Venezuela to Panama. The plane crashed shortly after takeoff and the cargo was presumed destroyed. However, the guitar apparently had survived and Frampton was able to recover it in 2011 after a collector spotted it in Curaçao . He continues to play the Les Paul now known as the &quot;Phenix&quot;.

Frampton was known as the artist who made the talk box famous. Frampton&#x27;s talk box was used to transfer the guitar&#x27;s sound through a plastic tube attached to a microphone. The effect is Frampton&#x27;s melodic guitar simulating speech while asking the audience on the live track &quot;Do You Feel Like We Do?&quot; Frampton also now sells his own line of custom-designed &quot;Frampton&quot; products, including the talk box.

In 1987, Frampton played two natural-finish maple bodies Pensa-Suhr Strat types, hand-made by New York-based John Suhr. He used a Coral electric sitar, given to him in the late 70s and previously owned by Jimi Hendrix, on David Bowie&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot;.

<text>Sementivae, also known as Feriae Sementivae or Sementina dies (in the country called Paganalia), was a Roman festival of sowing.

It was a type of &quot;feriae conceptivae&quot; [or &quot;conceptae&quot;]. These free days were held every year, but not on certain or fixed days, the time being every year appointed by the magistrates or priests (&quot;quotannis a magistratibus vel sacerdotibus concipiuntur&quot;).

It was held in honor of Ceres (the goddess of agriculture) and Tellus (Mother Earth). The initial half of the event was a festival in honor of Tellus which ran from January 24 through January 26. The festival honoring Ceres occurred one week later, starting February 2. The &quot;Sementina dies&quot; were kept in seed-time at Rome for the purpose of praying for a good crop; it lasted only for one day, which was fixed by the pontiffs. At the same time the Paganalia were observed in the country.

<text>The University of Galway () is a public research university located in the city of Galway, Ireland.

The university was founded in 1845 as &quot;Queen&#x27;s College, Galway&quot;. It was known as &quot;University College, Galway&quot; (UCG) () from 1908 to 1997 and as &quot;National University of Ireland Galway&quot; (NUI Galway) () from 1997 to 2022. In September 2022, it changed its name to &quot;University of Galway&quot;.

The University of Galway is a member of the Coimbra Group, a network of 40 long-established European universities.

==History==
The university was established in 1845 as Queen&#x27;s College, Galway, together with Queen&#x27;s College, Cork, and Queen&#x27;s College, Belfast. It opened for teaching on 30 October 1849 with 68 students. In 1850, it became part of the Queen&#x27;s University of Ireland, and its degrees were conferred in the name of that university.
Located close to the city centre, the university campus stretches along the River Corrib. The oldest part of the university, the Quadrangle with its &quot;Aula Maxima&quot;, was designed by John Benjamin Keane in a Tudor Gothic architectural style and was constructed from local limestone; it is a replica of Christ Church, one of the colleges at the University of Oxford.

The Queen&#x27;s University was dissolved on 3 February 1882 under the University Education (Ireland) Act 1879, and was replaced by the Royal University of Ireland (RUI), which had been established on 27 April 1880.

Under the Irish Universities Act 1908, the RUI was dissolved and was replaced by the National University of Ireland (NUI) and Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast (QUB). The name of Queen&#x27;s College, Galway, was changed to University College, Galway (UCG), and it became a constituent college of the new National University of Ireland, together with University College Dublin (UCD), and University College Cork (UCC). Queen&#x27;s College, Belfast, became an independent university, called the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast. University College, Galway (UCG), was given special statutory responsibility under the University College Galway Act 1929 with respect of the use of the Irish language as a working language of the university.

Members of the Franciscan Order from St. Anthony&#x27;s College would have studied for degrees in UCG, similarly members of the Society of African Missions at their House of Philosophy, at Cloughballymore, Kilcolgan, Co Galway, studied for degrees in UCG. St. Anthony&#x27;s is now used by the economics department.

Several new buildings were constructed on the university campus in the 1970s and were designed by architects Scott Tallon Walker. The 1990s also saw considerable development, including the conversion of an old munitions factory into a student centre. Under the early 21st-century Presidency of Iognáid G. Ó Muircheartaigh, the university announced details of plans to make the university a &quot;campus of the future&quot; at a cost of around €400 million. Ó Muircheartaigh&#x27;s successor James J. Browne continued and implemented that plan.

Under the Universities Act 1997, the name of University College, Galway, was changed to National University of Ireland, Galway (NUI Galway), and it became a university in its own right, as a constituent university of the National University of Ireland (NUI). The university had hoped to change its name to University of Galway, but had received legal advice that this was not possible under the provisions of the Act.

Visiting the university in 2003, on what was to be his last visit to Ireland, Nelson Mandela condemned U.S. foreign policy and received an honorary doctorate from the NUI Chancellor, Garret FitzGerald.

21st-century developments include a state-of-the-art University Sports Centre (), Áras Moyola, J.E. Cairnes School of Business &amp; Economics, the Alice Perry Engineering Building, the BioSciences Research Building, the Life Course Institute, the Lambe Institute and the O&#x27;Donoghue Centre for Drama, Theatre and Performance, and the Human Biology Building.

In 2014, the Equality Tribunal ruled in favor of Dr Micheline Sheehy Skeffington, granddaughter of the famous Irish feminist couple Hannah Sheehy Skeffington and Francis Sheehy Skeffington, who claimed she had been discriminated against on the grounds of gender during 2009. The university &quot;unreservedly&quot; accepted the decision that the &quot;hiring process was flawed&quot;. In 2015 with &quot;widespread concern&quot; among staff, mandatory unconscious bias training was introduced for senior staff, including heads of school and interview boards. In 2017 Dr Elizabeth Tilley was deemed to have exceeded qualifications for senior lectureship following a Labour Court hearing and promoted. In 2017, the gender ratio of senior lecturers in the university was 60:40 in favour of men. The ratio of professorships, the most senior academic grade, was 87:13 in favor of men. In 2018 the university achieved bronze status in the Athena SWAN recognises a commitment to advancing gender equality in higher education and research careers. In 2018 a further four female lecturers who had also applied for promotion in 2009 were promoted having settled their cases &quot;amicably&quot;.

The university launched its Strategic Plan &quot;Shared Vision, Shaped By Values&quot; (for the period 2020–2025) in 2020. Also in 2020, the university was awarded €4 million from the EU&#x27;s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme to support its Solar2chem project.

In April 2022, it was announced that NUI Galway would be renamed &quot;Ollscoil na Gaillimhe – University of Galway&quot; in summer 2022, amid confusion over its proper title. On 1 September 2022, the university changed its name to the &quot;University of Galway&quot;. This change took legal effect in February 2024.

==Colleges and schools==
Up until 2007, the university was divided into seven faculties (Arts, Celtic Studies, Commerce, Law, Medicine and Health Sciences, and Science), which were further subdivided into some 69 departments. In 2007–2008, the university transitioned from the faculties and departments structure to a structure of five colleges divided into various schools.

The following are the current colleges and schools of the university:
* College of Arts, Social Sciences and Celtic Studies
** School of Political Science and Sociology

Since 2015 the Shannon College of Hotel Management has been fully incorporated into the university — becoming part of the College of Business, Public Policy &amp; Law at Galway — formally marked by the then Minister for Education and Skills Jan O&#x27;Sullivan at an event held in Shannon College on 9 November 2015. All staff of Shannon College of Hotel Management became staff of the university and all students of Shannon College of Hotel Management became students of the university.

==Research==
There are five designated Research Institutes and a number of Research Centres and Units at the University of Galway. Designated Research Institutes at the university are characterised by significant interdisciplinary (generally cross-College) and high-quality research activity, including extensive collaboration nationally and internationally.
Examples of mould-breaking research include sugar coating devices and how spider bites can lead to hospitalisation.

==Foundation==
Galway University Foundation (GUF) was established in 1998 with the intention of generating financial support for the university from private individuals and institutions. It nurtures relationships with donors for whom the university&#x27;s approach to education appeals. The Foundation has many &#x27;Priority Projects&#x27; in development.
The main library building of the University of Galway is named the James Hardiman Library after the library&#x27;s first librarian, James Hardiman.

==Student life==
===Societies===
University of Galway has about 150 active student societies, ranging from the academic to artistic and performing, lifestyle and wellbeing, religious and political, social action and volunteering, social and cultural, and special interest.

The oldest society on the campus is the Literary and Debating Society, founded in 1846. The university&#x27;s drama society, Dramsoc, was founded in 1914 after the earliest recorded student production in 1904 demonstrated the need for a student-run drama society. Cumann Staire is one of Europe&#x27;s oldest history societies, and is a member of Comhaltas na gCumann Staire and the International Students of History Association. The university&#x27;s Fianna Fáil branch, Cumann de Barra, was founded in 1954, making it the oldest university political party branch in Ireland. Fine Gael&#x27;s youth wing was founded in the university in 1973 during the Liam Cosgrave-led Fine Gael/Labour Coalition government, with Enda Kenny and Madeleine Taylor-Quinn among those behind its establishment there. Official Sinn Féin were also influential in campus politics in the 1970s, and Students Union Presidents Eamon Gilmore and Johnny Curran were party members. CompSoc (the university&#x27;s computer society) is the oldest of its kind in the country, established in 1977.

Most of Ireland&#x27;s main political parties have active societies at the university including Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Green, Labour, People Before Profit, Sinn Féin and the Social Democrats.

Flirt FM is a community radio station located on campus, spearheaded by the Radio Society.

GUMS, the university musical society, hosts annual musicals in the Dubhlann/Black Box Theatre.

In 2014, the Christian and LGBT societies were involved in a showdown over same-sex marriage. The incident was provoked by the auditor of the Christian Society, running for the position of Equality Officer in that year&#x27;s student union election. Earlier, in the late part of 2013, the university suspended the Legion of Mary Society after it failed to satisfactorily explain its connection to posters containing information on a Christian support group for homosexual persons.

An Cumann Gaelach and An Cumann Drámaíochta are the university&#x27;s main Irish language societies, following the demise of the Cumann Craic. One of the main events of the Cumann Gaelach is the yearly celebration of Seachtain na Gaeilge. The society was awarded the Best New Entry Award at the Glór na nGael awards in 2011.

===Clubs===
University of Galway has more than 40 sports clubs based on campus, ranging from indoor sports (such as archery, badminton, fencing, weightlifting, table tennis, and squash), to water sports (such as rowing, kayaking, sailing, windsurfing, and scuba diving), as well as martial arts (such as judo, karate, aikido, Muay Thai, kendo, and taekwondo), plus equestrian, triathlon, athletics, and snow sports.

The university also competes in the most popular Irish field sports of association football, Gaelic football, hurling, and rugby union, as well as cricket, hockey, and lacrosse.

NUI Galway GAA compete in the Sigerson Cup (Gaelic football) and the Fitzgibbon Cup (hurling). They are the second most prolific winners of the Sigerson Cup.

NUI Galway RFC compete in the Connacht Senior Cup, and are the competition&#x27;s most successful side with 34 wins.

University of Galway FC compete in the Galway &amp; District League, the CUFL (Colleges and Universities Football League), Collingwood Cup and Harding Cup (Freshers).

The campus is home to a wide range of sport facilities. Facilities include Dangan Sportsground, where the university&#x27;s GAA teams compete, and the Kingfisher, where Moycullen Basketball Club play their games.

===Connacht Rugby===
In 2013, the university announced it would sponsor Connacht Rugby, the nearby professional Pro12 (now URC) rugby union team, for the following three years and would put in place a &quot;High Performance Education Partnership&quot; that would give players from the Connacht Rugby Academy and age-grade teams the chance to educated there. At the time of the announcement 17 members of Connacht&#x27;s squad were either attending the university as students or were graduates.

Within a few years of the start of the university&#x27;s sponsorship of the Connacht Rugby Academy, the team had won, what was then the 2015–16 Pro12 title, for the first time by defeating Leinster in the 2016 Pro12 Grand Final. Seven players from the Connacht Rugby Academy played 55 times for their team during that campaign, with others in that squad also graduates of the Connacht Rugby Academy.

The deal was renewed in 2017, covering the period until 2019.

===Students&#x27; Union===

The Students&#x27; Union&#x27;s primary role is to provide a recognised representative channel between undergraduates and the university and college authorities.

In February 2009, the university announced the Students&#x27; Union-run RAG Week would &quot;no longer form part of the university calendar&quot;. The President of the Students&#x27; Union expressed the belief that the decision was unjustified, citing the more than €20,000 raised for charities that year. RAG Week continued unofficially until 2024, when the fundraising event returned with support from the Students&#x27; Union.

===International===
International students make up over 12 percent of the student population at the University of Galway.

<text>Nuclear weapons design are physical, chemical, and engineering arrangements that cause the physics package of a nuclear weapon to detonate. There are three existing basic design types:
# Pure fission weapons are the simplest, least technically demanding, were the first nuclear weapons built, and so far the only type ever used in warfare, by the United States on Japan in World War II.
# [[Boosted fission weapon]]s increase yield beyond that of the implosion design, by using small quantities of fusion fuel to enhance the fission chain reaction. Boosting can more than double the weapon&#x27;s fission energy yield.
# Staged [[thermonuclear weapon]]s are arrangements of two or more &quot;stages&quot;, most usually two. The first stage is typically a boosted fission weapon (except for the earliest thermonuclear weapons, which used a pure fission weapon). Its detonation causes it to shine intensely with X-rays, which illuminate and implode the second stage filled with fusion fuel. This initiates a sequence of events which results in a thermonuclear, or fusion, burn. This process affords potential yields up to hundreds of times those of fission weapons.

Pure fission weapons have been the first type to be built by new nuclear powers. Large industrial states with well-developed nuclear arsenals have two-stage thermonuclear weapons, which are the most compact, scalable, and cost effective option, once the necessary technical base and industrial infrastructure are built.

Most known innovations in nuclear weapon design originated in the United States, though some were later developed independently by other states.

In early news accounts, pure fission weapons were called atomic bombs or A-bombs and weapons involving fusion were called hydrogen bombs or H-bombs. Practitioners of nuclear policy, however, favor the terms nuclear and thermonuclear, respectively.
==Nuclear reactions==
Nuclear fission separates or splits heavier atoms to form lighter atoms. Nuclear fusion combines lighter atoms to form heavier atoms. Both reactions generate roughly a million times more energy than comparable chemical reactions, making nuclear bombs a million times more powerful than non-nuclear bombs, which a French patent claimed in May 1939.

In some ways, fission and fusion are opposite and complementary reactions, but the particulars are unique for each. To understand how nuclear weapons are designed, it is useful to know the important similarities and differences between fission and fusion. The following explanation uses rounded numbers and approximations.

===Fission===

When a free neutron hits the nucleus of a fissile atom like uranium-235 (235U), the uranium nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei called fission fragments, plus more neutrons (for 235U three about as often as two; an average of just under 2.5 per fission). The fission chain reaction in a supercritical mass of fuel can be self-sustaining because it produces enough surplus neutrons to offset losses of neutrons escaping the supercritical assembly. Most of these have the speed (kinetic energy) required to cause new fissions in neighboring uranium nuclei.

The uranium-235 nucleus can split in many ways, provided the atomic numbers add up to 92 and the mass numbers add up to 236 (uranium-235 plus the neutron that caused the split). The following equation shows one possible split, namely into strontium-95 (95Sr), xenon-139 (139Xe), and two neutrons (n), plus energy:
:::formula_1

The immediate energy release per atom is about 180 million electron volts (MeV); i.e., 74 TJ/kg. Only 7% of this is gamma radiation and kinetic energy of fission neutrons. The remaining 93% is kinetic energy (or energy of motion) of the charged fission fragments, flying away from each other mutually repelled by the positive charge of their protons (38 for strontium, 54 for xenon). This initial kinetic energy is 67 TJ/kg, imparting an initial speed of about 12,000 kilometers per second (i.e. 1.2 cm per nanosecond). The charged fragments&#x27; high electric charge causes many inelastic coulomb collisions with nearby nuclei, and these fragments remain trapped inside the bomb&#x27;s fissile pit and tamper until their kinetic energy is converted into heat. Given the speed of the fragments and the mean free path between nuclei in the compressed fuel assembly (for the implosion design), this takes about a millionth of a second (a microsecond), by which time the core and tamper of the bomb have expanded to a ball of plasma several meters in diameter with a temperature of tens of millions of degrees Celsius.

This is hot enough to emit black-body radiation in the X-ray spectrum. These X-rays are absorbed by the surrounding air, producing the fireball and blast of a nuclear explosion.

Most fission products have too many neutrons to be stable so they are radioactive by beta decay, converting neutrons into protons by throwing off beta particles (electrons), neutrinos and gamma rays. Their half-lives range from milliseconds to about 200,000 years. Many decay into isotopes that are themselves radioactive, so from 1 to 6 (average 3) decays may be required to reach stability. In reactors, the radioactive products are the nuclear waste in spent fuel. In bombs, they become radioactive fallout, both local and global.

Meanwhile, inside the exploding bomb, the free neutrons released by fission carry away about 3% of the initial fission energy. Neutron kinetic energy adds to the blast energy of a bomb, but not as effectively as the energy from charged fragments, since neutrons do not give up their kinetic energy as quickly in collisions with charged nuclei or electrons. The dominant contribution of fission neutrons to the bomb&#x27;s power is the initiation of subsequent fissions. Over half of the neutrons escape the bomb core, but the rest strike 235U nuclei causing them to fission in an exponentially growing chain reaction (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.). Starting from one atom, the number of fissions can theoretically double a hundred times in a microsecond, which could consume all uranium or plutonium up to hundreds of tons by the hundredth link in the chain. Typically in a modern weapon, the weapon&#x27;s pit contains of plutonium and at detonation produces approximately yield, representing the fissioning of approximately of plutonium.

Materials which can sustain a chain reaction are called fissile. The two fissile materials used in nuclear weapons are: 235U, also known as highly enriched uranium (HEU), &quot;oralloy&quot; meaning &quot;Oak Ridge alloy&quot;, or &quot;25&quot; (a combination of the last digit of the atomic number of uranium-235, which is 92, and the last digit of its mass number, which is 235); and 239Pu, also known as plutonium-239, or &quot;49&quot; (from &quot;94&quot; and &quot;239&quot;).

Uranium&#x27;s most common isotope, 238U, is fissionable but not fissile, meaning that it cannot sustain a chain reaction because its daughter fission neutrons are not (on average) energetic enough to cause follow-on 238U fissions. However, the neutrons released by fusion of the heavy hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium will fission 238U. This 238U fission reaction in the outer jacket of the secondary assembly of a two-stage thermonuclear bomb produces by far the greatest fraction of the bomb&#x27;s energy yield, as well as most of its radioactive debris.

For national powers engaged in a nuclear arms race, this fact of 238U&#x27;s ability to fast-fission from thermonuclear neutron bombardment is of central importance. The plenitude and cheapness of both bulk dry fusion fuel (lithium deuteride) and 238U (a byproduct of uranium enrichment) permit the economical production of very large nuclear arsenals, in comparison to pure fission weapons requiring the expensive 235U or 239Pu fuels.

===Fusion===

Fusion produces neutrons which dissipate energy from the reaction. In weapons, the most important fusion reaction is called the D-T reaction. Using the heat and pressure of fission, hydrogen-2, or deuterium (2D), fuses with hydrogen-3, or tritium (3T), to form helium-4 (4He) plus one neutron (n) and energy:
:::formula_2
The total energy output, 17.6 MeV, is one tenth of that with fission, but the ingredients are only one-fiftieth as massive, so the energy output per unit mass is approximately five times as great. In this fusion reaction, 14 of the 17.6 MeV (80% of the energy released in the reaction) shows up as the kinetic energy of the neutron, which, having no electric charge and being almost as massive as the hydrogen nuclei that created it, can escape the scene without leaving its energy behind to help sustain the reaction – or to generate x-rays for blast and fire.

The only practical way to capture most of the fusion energy is to trap the neutrons inside a massive bottle of heavy material such as lead, uranium, or plutonium. If the 14 MeV neutron is captured by uranium (of either isotope; 14 MeV is high enough to fission both 235U and 238U) or plutonium, the result is fission and the release of 180 MeV of fission energy, multiplying the energy output tenfold.

For weapon use, fission is necessary to start fusion, helps to sustain fusion, and captures and multiplies the energy carried by the fusion neutrons. In the case of a neutron bomb (see below), the last-mentioned factor does not apply, since the objective is to facilitate the escape of neutrons, rather than to use them to increase the weapon&#x27;s raw power.

===Tritium production===
An essential nuclear reaction is the one that creates tritium, or hydrogen-3. Tritium is employed in two ways. First, pure tritium gas is produced for placement inside the cores of boosted fission devices in order to increase their energy yields. This is especially so for the fission primaries of thermonuclear weapons. The second way is indirect, and takes advantage of the fact that the neutrons emitted by a supercritical fission &quot;spark plug&quot; in the secondary assembly of a two-stage thermonuclear bomb will produce tritium &quot;in situ&quot; when these neutrons collide with the lithium nuclei in the bomb&#x27;s lithium deuteride fuel supply.

Elemental gaseous tritium for fission primaries is also made by bombarding lithium-6 (6Li) with neutrons (n), only in a nuclear reactor. This neutron bombardment will cause the lithium-6 nucleus to split, producing an alpha particle, or helium-4 (4He), plus a triton (3T) and energy:
:::formula_3

But as was discovered in the first test of this type of device, Castle Bravo, when lithium-7 is present, one also has some amounts of the following two net reactions:
:Li + n → T + He + n
:Li + H → 2 He + n + 15.123 MeV

Most lithium is 7Li, and this gave Castle Bravo a yield 2.5 times larger than expected.

The neutrons are supplied by the nuclear reactor in a way similar to production of plutonium 239Pu from 238U feedstock: target rods of the 6Li feedstock are arranged around a uranium-fueled core, and are removed for processing once it has been calculated that most of the lithium nuclei have been transmuted to tritium.

Of the four basic types of nuclear weapon, the first, pure fission, uses the first of the three nuclear reactions above. The second, fusion-boosted fission, uses the first two. The third, two-stage thermonuclear, uses all three.

==Pure fission weapons==

The first task of a nuclear weapon design is to rapidly assemble a supercritical mass of fissile (weapon grade) uranium or plutonium. A supercritical mass is one in which the percentage of fission-produced neutrons captured by other neighboring fissile nuclei is large enough that each fission event, on average, causes more than one follow-on fission event. Neutrons released by the first fission events induce subsequent fission events at an exponentially accelerating rate. Each follow-on fissioning continues a sequence of these reactions that works its way throughout the supercritical mass of fuel nuclei. This process is conceived and described colloquially as the nuclear chain reaction.

To start the chain reaction in a supercritical assembly, at least one free neutron must be injected and collide with a fissile fuel nucleus. The neutron joins with the nucleus (technically a fusion event) and destabilizes the nucleus, which explodes into two middleweight nuclear fragments (from the severing of the strong nuclear force holding the mutually-repulsive protons together), plus two or three free neutrons. These race away and collide with neighboring fuel nuclei. This process repeats over and over until the fuel assembly goes sub-critical (from thermal expansion), after which the chain reaction shuts down because the daughter neutrons can no longer find new fuel nuclei to hit before escaping the less-dense fuel mass. Each following fission event in the chain approximately doubles the neutron population (net, after losses due to some neutrons escaping the fuel mass, and others that collide with any non-fuel impurity nuclei present).

For the gun assembly method (see below) of supercritical mass formation, the fuel itself can be relied upon to initiate the chain reaction. This is because even the best weapon-grade uranium contains a significant number of 238U nuclei. These are susceptible to spontaneous fission events, which occur randomly (it is a quantum mechanical phenomenon). Because the fissile material in a gun-assembled critical mass is not compressed, the design need only ensure the two sub-critical masses remain close enough to each other long enough that a 238U spontaneous fission will occur while the weapon is in the vicinity of the target. This is not difficult to arrange as it takes but a second or two in a typical-size fuel mass for this to occur. (Still, many such bombs meant for delivery by air (gravity bomb, artillery shell or rocket) use injected neutrons to gain finer control over the exact detonation altitude, important for the destructive effectiveness of airbursts.)

This condition of spontaneous fission highlights the necessity to assemble the supercritical mass of fuel very rapidly. The time required to accomplish this is called the weapon&#x27;s critical insertion time. If spontaneous fission were to occur when the supercritical mass was only partially assembled, the chain reaction would begin prematurely. Neutron losses through the void between the two subcritical masses (gun assembly) or the voids between not-fully-compressed fuel nuclei (implosion assembly) would sap the bomb of the number of fission events needed to attain the full design yield. Additionally, heat resulting from the fissions that do occur would work against the continued assembly of the supercritical mass, from thermal expansion of the fuel. This failure is called predetonation. The resulting explosion would be called a &quot;fizzle&quot; by bomb engineers and weapon users. Plutonium&#x27;s high rate of spontaneous fission makes uranium fuel a necessity for gun-assembled bombs, with their much greater insertion time and much greater mass of fuel required (because of the lack of fuel compression).

There is another source of free neutrons that can spoil a fission explosion. All uranium and plutonium nuclei have a decay mode that results in energetic alpha particles. If the fuel mass contains impurity elements of low atomic number (Z), these charged alphas can penetrate the coulomb barrier of these impurity nuclei and undergo a reaction that yields a free neutron. The rate of alpha emission of fissile nuclei is one to two million times that of spontaneous fission, so weapon engineers are careful to use fuel of high purity.

Fission weapons used in the vicinity of other nuclear explosions must be protected from the intrusion of free neutrons from outside. Such shielding material will almost always be penetrated, however, if the outside neutron flux is intense enough. When a weapon misfires or fizzles because of the effects of other nuclear detonations, it is called nuclear fratricide.

For the implosion-assembled design, once the critical mass is assembled to maximum density, a burst of neutrons must be supplied to start the chain reaction. Early weapons used a modulated neutron generator code named &quot;Urchin&quot; inside the pit containing polonium-210 and beryllium separated by a thin barrier. Implosion of the pit crushes the neutron generator, mixing the two metals, thereby allowing alpha particles from the polonium to interact with beryllium to produce free neutrons. In modern weapons, the neutron generator is a high-voltage vacuum tube containing a particle accelerator which bombards a deuterium/tritium-metal hydride target with deuterium and tritium ions. The resulting small-scale fusion produces neutrons at a protected location outside the physics package, from which they penetrate the pit. This method allows better timing of the first fission events in the chain reaction, which optimally should occur at the point of maximum compression/supercriticality. Timing of the neutron injection is a more important parameter than the number of neutrons injected: the first generations of the chain reaction are vastly more effective due to the exponential function by which neutron multiplication evolves.

The critical mass of an uncompressed sphere of bare metal is for uranium-235 and for delta-phase plutonium-239. In practical applications, the amount of material required for criticality is modified by shape, purity, density, and the proximity to neutron-reflecting material, all of which affect the escape or capture of neutrons.

To avoid a premature chain reaction during handling, the fissile material in the weapon must be kept subcritical. It may consist of one or more components containing less than one uncompressed critical mass each. A thin hollow shell can have more than the bare-sphere critical mass, as can a cylinder, which can be arbitrarily long without ever reaching criticality. Another method of reducing criticality risk is to incorporate material with a large cross-section for neutron capture, such as boron (specifically 10B comprising 20% of natural boron). Naturally this neutron absorber must be removed before the weapon is detonated. This is easy for a gun-assembled bomb: the projectile mass simply shoves the absorber out of the void between the two subcritical masses by the force of its motion.

The use of plutonium affects weapon design due to its high rate of alpha emission. This results in Pu metal spontaneously producing significant heat; a 5 kilogram mass produces 9.68 watts of thermal power. Such a piece would feel warm to the touch, which is no problem if that heat is dissipated promptly and not allowed to build up the temperature. But this is a problem inside a nuclear bomb. For this reason bombs using Pu fuel use aluminum parts to wick away the excess heat, and this complicates bomb design because Al plays no active role in the explosion processes.

A tamper is an optional layer of dense material surrounding the fissile material. Due to its inertia it delays the thermal expansion of the fissioning fuel mass, keeping it supercritical for longer. Often the same layer serves both as tamper and as neutron reflector.

===Gun-type assembly===
Little Boy, the Hiroshima bomb, used of uranium with an average enrichment of around 80%, or of uranium-235, just about the bare-metal critical mass . When assembled inside its tamper/reflector of tungsten carbide, the was more than twice critical mass. Before the detonation, the uranium-235 was formed into two sub-critical pieces, one of which was later fired down a gun barrel to join the other, starting the nuclear explosion. Analysis shows that less than 2% of the uranium mass underwent fission; the remainder, representing most of the entire wartime output of the giant Y-12 factories at Oak Ridge, scattered uselessly.

The inefficiency was caused by the speed with which the uncompressed fissioning uranium expanded and became sub-critical by virtue of decreased density. Despite its inefficiency, this design, because of its shape, was adapted for use in small-diameter, cylindrical artillery shells (a gun-type warhead fired from the barrel of a much larger gun). Such warheads were deployed by the United States until 1992, accounting for a significant fraction of the 235U in the arsenal, and were some of the first weapons dismantled to comply with treaties limiting warhead numbers. The rationale for this decision was undoubtedly a combination of the lower yield and grave safety issues associated with the gun-type design.

===Implosion-type===

For both the Trinity device and the Fat Man (Nagasaki) bomb, nearly identical plutonium fission through implosion designs were used. The Fat Man device specifically used , about in volume, of Pu-239, which is only 41% of bare-sphere critical mass . Surrounded by a U-238 reflector/tamper, the Fat Man&#x27;s pit was brought close to critical mass by the neutron-reflecting properties of the U-238. During detonation, criticality was achieved by implosion. The plutonium pit was squeezed to increase its density by simultaneous detonation, as with the &quot;Trinity&quot; test detonation three weeks earlier, of the conventional explosives placed uniformly around the pit. The explosives were detonated by multiple exploding-bridgewire detonators. It is estimated that only about 20% of the plutonium underwent fission; the rest, about , was scattered.

An implosion shock wave might be of such short duration that only part of the pit is compressed at any instant as the wave passes through it. To prevent this, a pusher shell may be needed. The pusher is located between the explosive lens and the tamper. It works by reflecting some of the shock wave backward, thereby having the effect of lengthening its duration. It is made out of a low density metal – such as aluminium, beryllium, or an alloy of the two metals (aluminium is easier and safer to shape, and is two orders of magnitude cheaper; beryllium has high neutron-reflective capability). Fat Man used an aluminium pusher.

The series of RaLa Experiment tests of implosion-type fission weapon design concepts, carried out from July 1944 through February 1945 at the Los Alamos Laboratory and a remote site east of it in Bayo Canyon, proved the practicality of the implosion design for a fission device, with the February 1945 tests positively determining its usability for the final Trinity/Fat Man plutonium implosion design.

The key to Fat Man&#x27;s greater efficiency was the inward momentum of the massive U-238 tamper. (The natural uranium tamper did not undergo fission from thermal neutrons, but did contribute perhaps 20% of the total yield from fission by fast neutrons). After the chain reaction started in the plutonium, it continued until the explosion reversed the momentum of the implosion and expanded enough to stop the chain reaction. By holding everything together for a few hundred nanoseconds more, the tamper increased the efficiency.

====Plutonium pit====

The core of an implosion weapon – the fissile material and any reflector or tamper bonded to it – is known as the &quot;pit&quot;. Some weapons tested during the 1950s used pits made with U-235 alone, or in composite with plutonium, but all-plutonium pits are the smallest in diameter and have been the standard since the early 1960s.

Casting and then machining plutonium is difficult not only because of its toxicity, but also because plutonium has many different metallic phases. As plutonium cools, changes in phase result in distortion and cracking. This distortion is normally overcome by alloying it with 30–35 mMol (0.9–1.0% by weight) gallium, forming a plutonium-gallium alloy, which causes it to take up its delta phase over a wide temperature range. When cooling from molten it then has only a single phase change, from epsilon to delta, instead of the four changes it would otherwise pass through. Other trivalent metals would also work, but gallium has a small neutron absorption cross section and helps protect the plutonium against corrosion. A drawback is that gallium compounds are corrosive and so if the plutonium is recovered from dismantled weapons for conversion to plutonium dioxide for power reactors, there is the difficulty of removing the gallium.

Because plutonium is chemically reactive it is common to plate the completed pit with a thin layer of inert metal, which also reduces the toxic hazard. The gadget used galvanic silver plating; afterward, nickel deposited from nickel tetracarbonyl vapors was used, but thereafter and since, gold became the preferred material. Recent designs improve safety by plating pits with vanadium to make the pits more fire-resistant.

===Levitated-pit implosion===

The first improvement on the Fat Man design was to put an air space between the tamper and the pit to create a hammer-on-nail impact. The pit, supported on a hollow cone inside the tamper cavity, was said to be &quot;levitated&quot;. The three tests of Operation Sandstone, in 1948, used Fat Man designs with levitated pits. The largest yield was 49 kilotons, more than twice the yield of the unlevitated Fat Man.

It was immediately clear that implosion was the best design for a fission weapon. Its only drawback seemed to be its diameter. Fat Man was wide vs for Little Boy.

The Pu-239 pit of Fat Man was only in diameter, the size of a softball. The bulk of Fat Man&#x27;s girth was the implosion mechanism, namely concentric layers of U-238, aluminium, and high explosives. The key to reducing that girth was the two-point implosion design.

===Two-point linear implosion===

In the two-point linear implosion, the nuclear fuel is cast into a solid shape and placed within the center of a cylinder of high explosive. Detonators are placed at either end of the explosive cylinder, and a plate-like insert, or &quot;shaper&quot;, is placed in the explosive just inside the detonators. When the detonators are fired, the initial detonation is trapped between the shaper and the end of the cylinder, causing it to travel out to the edges of the shaper where it is diffracted around the edges into the main mass of explosive. This causes the detonation to form into a ring that proceeds inward from the shaper.

Due to the lack of a tamper or lenses to shape the progression, the detonation does not reach the pit in a spherical shape. To produce the desired spherical implosion, the fissile material itself is shaped to produce the same effect. Due to the physics of the shock wave propagation within the explosive mass, this requires the pit to be a prolate spheroid, that is, roughly egg shaped. The shock wave first reaches the pit at its tips, driving them inward and causing the mass to become spherical. The shock may also change plutonium from delta to alpha phase, increasing its density by 23%, but without the inward momentum of a true implosion.

The lack of compression makes such designs inefficient, but the simplicity and small diameter make it suitable for use in artillery shells and atomic demolition munitions – ADMs – also known as backpack or suitcase nukes; an example is the W48 artillery shell, the smallest nuclear weapon ever built or deployed. All such low-yield battlefield weapons, whether gun-type U-235 designs or linear implosion Pu-239 designs, pay a high price in fissile material in order to achieve diameters between six and ten inches (15 and 25 cm).

===Hollow-pit implosion===

A more efficient implosion system uses a hollow pit.

A hollow plutonium pit was the original plan for the 1945 Fat Man bomb, but there was not enough time to develop and test the implosion system for it. A simpler solid-pit design was considered more reliable, given the time constraints, but it required a heavy U-238 tamper, a thick aluminium pusher, and three tons of high explosives.

After the war, interest in the hollow pit design was revived. Its obvious advantage is that a hollow shell of plutonium, shock-deformed and driven inward toward its empty center, would carry momentum into its violent assembly as a solid sphere. It would be self-tamping, requiring a smaller U-238 tamper, no aluminium pusher, and less high explosive.

==Fusion-boosted fission==
The next step in miniaturization was to speed up the fissioning of the pit to reduce the minimum inertial confinement time. This would allow the efficient fission of the fuel with less mass in the form of tamper or the fuel itself. The key to achieving faster fission would be to introduce more neutrons, and among the many ways to do this, adding a fusion reaction was relatively easy in the case of a hollow pit.

The easiest fusion reaction to achieve is found in a 50–50 mixture of tritium and deuterium. For fusion power experiments this mixture must be held at high temperatures for relatively lengthy times in order to have an efficient reaction. For explosive use, however, the goal is not to produce efficient fusion, but simply provide extra neutrons early in the process. Since a nuclear explosion is supercritical, any extra neutrons will be multiplied by the chain reaction, so even tiny quantities introduced early can have a large effect on the outcome. For this reason, even the relatively low compression pressures and times (in fusion terms) found in the center of a hollow pit warhead are enough to create the desired effect.

In the boosted design, the fusion fuel in gas form is pumped into the pit during arming. This will fuse into helium and release free neutrons soon after fission begins. The neutrons will start a large number of new chain reactions while the pit is still critical or nearly critical. Once the hollow pit is perfected, there is little reason not to boost; deuterium and tritium are easily produced in the small quantities needed, and the technical aspects are trivial.

The concept of fusion-boosted fission was first tested on May 25, 1951, in the Item shot of Operation Greenhouse, Eniwetok, yield 45.5 kilotons.

Boosting reduces diameter in three ways, all the result of faster fission:
* Since the compressed pit does not need to be held together as long, the massive U-238 tamper can be replaced by a light-weight beryllium shell (to reflect escaping neutrons back into the pit). The diameter is reduced.
* The mass of the pit can be reduced by half, without reducing yield. Diameter is reduced again.
* Since the mass of the metal being imploded (tamper plus pit) is reduced, a smaller charge of high explosive is needed, reducing diameter even further.

The first device whose dimensions suggest employment of all these features (two-point, hollow-pit, fusion-boosted implosion) was the Swan device. It had a cylindrical shape with a diameter of and a length of .

It was first tested standalone and then as the primary of a two-stage thermonuclear device during Operation Redwing. It was weaponized as the Robin primary and became the first off-the-shelf, multi-use primary, and the prototype for all that followed.

After the success of Swan, seemed to become the standard diameter of boosted single-stage devices tested during the 1950s. Length was usually twice the diameter, but one such device, which became the W54 warhead, was closer to a sphere, only long.

One of the applications of the W54 was the Davy Crockett XM-388 recoilless rifle projectile. It had a dimension of just , and is shown here in comparison to its Fat Man predecessor ().

Another benefit of boosting, in addition to making weapons smaller, lighter, and with less fissile material for a given yield, is that it renders weapons immune to predetonation. It was discovered in the mid-1950s that plutonium pits would be particularly susceptible to partial predetonation if exposed to the intense radiation of a nearby nuclear explosion (electronics might also be damaged, but this was a separate problem). RI was a particular problem before effective early warning radar systems because a first strike attack might make retaliatory weapons useless. Boosting reduces the amount of plutonium needed in a weapon to below the quantity which would be vulnerable to this effect.

==Two-stage thermonuclear==

Pure fission or fusion-boosted fission weapons can be made to yield hundreds of kilotons, at great expense in fissile material and tritium, but by far the most efficient way to increase nuclear weapon yield beyond ten or so kilotons is to add a second independent stage, called a secondary.

In the 1940s, bomb designers at Los Alamos thought the secondary would be a canister of deuterium in liquefied or hydride form. The fusion reaction would be D-D, harder to achieve than D-T, but more affordable. A fission bomb at one end would shock-compress and heat the near end, and fusion would propagate through the canister to the far end. Mathematical simulations showed it would not work, even with large amounts of expensive tritium added.

The entire fusion fuel canister would need to be enveloped by fission energy, to both compress and heat it, as with the booster charge in a boosted primary. The design breakthrough came in January 1951, when Edward Teller and Stanislaw Ulam invented radiation implosion – for nearly three decades known publicly only as the Teller-Ulam H-bomb secret.

The concept of radiation implosion was first tested on May 9, 1951, in the George shot of Operation Greenhouse, Eniwetok, yield 225 kilotons. The first full test was on November 1, 1952, the Mike shot of Operation Ivy, Eniwetok, yield 10.4 megatons.

In radiation implosion, the burst of X-ray energy coming from an exploding primary is captured and contained within an opaque-walled radiation channel which surrounds the nuclear energy components of the secondary. The radiation quickly turns the plastic foam that had been filling the channel into a plasma which is mostly transparent to X-rays, and the radiation is absorbed in the outermost layers of the pusher/tamper surrounding the secondary, which ablates and applies a massive force (much like an inside out rocket engine) causing the fusion fuel capsule to implode much like the pit of the primary. As the secondary implodes a fissile &quot;spark plug&quot; at its center ignites and provides neutrons and heat which enable the lithium deuteride fusion fuel to produce tritium and ignite as well. The fission and fusion chain reactions exchange neutrons with each other and boost the efficiency of both reactions. The greater implosive force, enhanced efficiency of the fissile &quot;spark plug&quot; due to boosting via fusion neutrons, and the fusion explosion itself provide significantly greater explosive yield from the secondary despite often not being much larger than the primary.

For example, for the Redwing Mohawk test on July 3, 1956, a secondary called the Flute was attached to the Swan primary. The Flute was in diameter and long, about the size of the Swan. But it weighed ten times as much and yielded 24 times as much energy (355 kilotons vs 15 kilotons).

Equally important, the active ingredients in the Flute probably cost no more than those in the Swan. Most of the fission came from cheap U-238, and the tritium was manufactured in place during the explosion. Only the spark plug at the axis of the secondary needed to be fissile.

A spherical secondary can achieve higher implosion densities than a cylindrical secondary, because spherical implosion pushes in from all directions toward the same spot. However, in warheads yielding more than one megaton, the diameter of a spherical secondary would be too large for most applications. A cylindrical secondary is necessary in such cases. The small, cone-shaped re-entry vehicles in multiple-warhead ballistic missiles after 1970 tended to have warheads with spherical secondaries, and yields of a few hundred kilotons.

In engineering terms, radiation implosion allows for the exploitation of several known features of nuclear bomb materials which heretofore had eluded practical application. For example:
* The optimal way to store deuterium in a reasonably dense state is to chemically bond it with lithium, as lithium deuteride. But the lithium-6 isotope is also the raw material for tritium production, and an exploding bomb is a nuclear reactor. Radiation implosion will hold everything together long enough to permit the complete conversion of lithium-6 into tritium, while the bomb explodes. So the bonding agent for deuterium permits use of the D-T fusion reaction without any pre-manufactured tritium being stored in the secondary. The tritium production constraint disappears.
* For the secondary to be imploded by the hot, radiation-induced plasma surrounding it, it must remain cool for the first microsecond, i.e., it must be encased in a massive radiation (heat) shield. The shield&#x27;s massiveness allows it to double as a tamper, adding momentum and duration to the implosion. No material is better suited for both of these jobs than ordinary, cheap uranium-238, which also happens to undergo fission when struck by the neutrons produced by D-T fusion. This casing, called the pusher, thus has three jobs: to keep the secondary cool; to hold it, inertially, in a highly compressed state; and, finally, to serve as the chief energy source for the entire bomb. The consumable pusher makes the bomb more a uranium fission bomb than a hydrogen fusion bomb. Insiders never used the term &quot;hydrogen bomb&quot;.
* Finally, the heat for fusion ignition comes not from the primary but from a second fission bomb called the spark plug, embedded in the heart of the secondary. The implosion of the secondary implodes this spark plug, detonating it and igniting fusion in the material around it, but the spark plug then continues to fission in the neutron-rich environment until it is fully consumed, adding significantly to the yield.

In the ensuing fifty years, no one has come up with a more efficient way to build a thermonuclear bomb. It is the design of choice for the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, China, and France, the five thermonuclear powers. On 3 September 2017 North Korea carried out what it reported as its first &quot;two-stage thermo-nuclear weapon&quot; test. According to Dr. Theodore Taylor, after reviewing leaked photographs of disassembled weapons components taken before 1986, Israel possessed boosted weapons and would require supercomputers of that era to advance further toward full two-stage weapons in the megaton range without nuclear test detonations. The other nuclear-armed nations, India and Pakistan, probably have single-stage weapons, possibly boosted.

===Interstage===
In a two-stage thermonuclear weapon the energy from the primary impacts the secondary. An essential energy transfer modulator called the interstage, between the primary and the secondary, protects the secondary&#x27;s fusion fuel from heating too quickly, which could cause it to explode in a conventional (and small) heat explosion before the fusion and fission reactions get a chance to start.

There is very little information in the open literature about the mechanism of the interstage. Its first mention in a U.S. government document formally released to the public appears to be a caption in a graphic promoting the Reliable Replacement Warhead Program in 2007. If built, this new design would replace &quot;toxic, brittle material&quot; and &quot;expensive &#x27;special&#x27; material&quot; in the interstage. This statement suggests the interstage may contain beryllium to moderate the flux of neutrons from the primary, and perhaps something to absorb and re-radiate the x-rays in a particular manner. There is also some speculation that this interstage material, which may be code-named Fogbank, might be an aerogel, possibly doped with beryllium and/or other substances.

The interstage and the secondary are encased together inside a stainless steel membrane to form the canned subassembly (CSA), an arrangement which has never been depicted in any open-source drawing. The most detailed illustration of an interstage shows a British thermonuclear weapon with a cluster of items between its primary and a cylindrical secondary. They are labeled &quot;end-cap and neutron focus lens&quot;, &quot;reflector/neutron gun carriage&quot;, and &quot;reflector wrap&quot;. The origin of the drawing, posted on the internet by Greenpeace, is uncertain, and there is no accompanying explanation.

==Specific designs==
While every nuclear weapon design falls into one of these categories, specific designs have occasionally become the subject of news accounts and public discussion, often with incorrect descriptions about how they work and what they do. Examples:

===Alarm Clock/Sloika===

The first effort to exploit the symbiotic relationship between fission and fusion was a 1940s design that mixed fission and fusion fuel in alternating thin layers. As a single-stage device, it would have been a cumbersome application of boosted fission. It first became practical when incorporated into the secondary of a two-stage thermonuclear weapon.

The U.S. name, Alarm Clock, came from Teller: he called it that because it might &quot;wake up the world&quot; to the possibility of the potential of the Super. The Russian name for the same design was more descriptive: Sloika (), a layered pastry cake. A single-stage Soviet Sloika was tested as RDS-6s on August 12, 1953. No single-stage U.S. version was tested, but the code named Castle Union shot of Operation Castle, April 26, 1954, was a two-stage thermonuclear device code-named Alarm Clock. Its yield, at Bikini, was 6.9 megatons.

Because the Soviet Sloika test used dry lithium-6 deuteride eight months before the first U.S. test to use it (Castle Bravo, March 1, 1954), it was sometimes claimed that the USSR won the H-bomb race, even though the United States tested and developed the first hydrogen bomb: the Ivy Mike H-bomb test. The 1952 U.S. Ivy Mike test used cryogenically cooled liquid deuterium as the fusion fuel in the secondary, and employed the D-D fusion reaction. However, the first Soviet test to use a radiation-imploded secondary, the essential feature of a true H-bomb, was on November 23, 1955, three years after Ivy Mike. In fact, real work on the implosion scheme in the Soviet Union only commenced in the very early part of 1953, several months after the successful testing of Sloika.

===Clean bombs===

On March 1, 1954, the largest-ever U.S. nuclear test explosion, the 15-megaton Castle Bravo shot of Operation Castle at Bikini Atoll, delivered a promptly lethal dose of fission-product fallout to more than of Pacific Ocean surface. Radiation injuries to Marshall Islanders and Japanese fishermen made that fact public and revealed the role of fission in hydrogen bombs.

In response to the public alarm over fallout, an effort was made to design a clean multi-megaton weapon, relying almost entirely on fusion. The energy produced by the fissioning of unenriched natural uranium, when used as the tamper material in the secondary and subsequent stages in the Teller-Ulam design, can far exceed the energy released by fusion, as was the case in the Castle Bravo test. Replacing the fissionable material in the tamper with another material is essential to producing a &quot;clean&quot; bomb. In such a device, the tamper no longer contributes energy, so for any given weight, a clean bomb will have less yield. The earliest known incidence of a three-stage device being tested, with the third stage, called the tertiary, being ignited by the secondary, was May 27, 1956, in the Bassoon device. This device was tested in the Zuni shot of Operation Redwing. This shot used non-fissionable tampers; an inert substitute material such as tungsten or lead was used. Its yield was 3.5 megatons, 85% fusion and only 15% fission.

The Ripple concept, which used ablation to achieve fusion using very little fission, was and still is by far the cleanest design. Unlike previous clean bombs, which were clean simply by replacing fission fuel with inert substance, Ripple was by design clean. Ripple was also extremely efficient; plans for a 15 kt/kg were made during Operation Dominic. Shot Androscoggin featured a proof-of-concept Ripple design, resulting in a 63-kiloton fizzle (significantly lower than the predicted 15 megatons). It was repeated in shot Housatonic, which featured a 9.96 megaton explosion that was reportedly &gt;99.9% fusion.

The public records for devices that produced the highest proportion of their yield via fusion reactions are the peaceful nuclear explosions of the 1970s. Others include the 10 megaton Dominic Housatonic at over 99.9% fusion, 50-megaton Tsar Bomba at 97% fusion, the 9.3-megaton Hardtack Poplar test at 95%, and the 4.5-megaton Redwing Navajo test at 95% fusion.

The most ambitious peaceful application of nuclear explosions was pursued by the USSR with the aim of creating a long canal between the Pechora river basin and the Kama river basin, about half of which was to be constructed through a series of underground nuclear explosions. It was reported that about 250 nuclear devices might be used to get the final goal. The &quot;Taiga&quot; test was to demonstrate the feasibility of the project. Three of these &quot;clean&quot; devices of 15 kiloton yield each were placed in separate boreholes spaced about apart at depths of . They were simultaneously detonated on March 23, 1971, catapulting a radioactive plume into the air that was carried eastward by wind. The resulting trench was around long and wide, with an unimpressive depth of just . Despite their &quot;clean&quot; nature, the area still exhibits a noticeably higher (albeit mostly harmless) concentration of fission products, the intense neutron bombardment of the soil, the device itself and the support structures also activated their stable elements to create a significant amount of man-made radioactive elements like 60Co. The overall danger posed by the concentration of radioactive elements present at the site created by these three devices is still negligible, but a larger scale project as was envisioned would have had significant consequences both from the fallout of radioactive plume and the radioactive elements created by the neutron bombardment.

On July 19, 1956, AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss said that the Redwing Zuni shot clean bomb test &quot;produced much of importance ... from a humanitarian aspect.&quot; However, less than two days after this announcement, the dirty version of Bassoon, called Bassoon Prime, with a uranium-238 tamper in place, was tested on a barge off the coast of Bikini Atoll as the Redwing Tewa shot. The Bassoon Prime produced a 5-megaton yield, of which 87% came from fission. Data obtained from this test, and others, culminated in the eventual deployment of the highest-yielding US nuclear weapon known, and the highest yield-to-weight weapon ever made, a three-stage thermonuclear weapon with a maximum &quot;dirty&quot; yield of 25 megatons, designated as the B41 nuclear bomb, which was to be carried by U.S. Air Force bombers until it was decommissioned; this weapon was never fully tested.

===Third generation===
First and second generation nuclear weapons release energy as omnidirectional blasts. Third generation nuclear weapons are experimental special effect warheads and devices that can release energy in a directed manner, some of which were tested during the Cold War but were never deployed. These include:
* Project Prometheus, also known as &quot;Nuclear Shotgun&quot;, which would have used a nuclear explosion to accelerate kinetic penetrators against ICBMs.
* Project Excalibur, a nuclear-pumped X-ray laser to destroy ballistic missiles.
* Nuclear shaped charges that focus their energy in particular directions.
* Project Orion explored the use of nuclear explosives for rocket propulsion.

===Fourth generation===
The idea of &quot;4th-generation&quot; nuclear weapons has been proposed as a possible successor to the examples of weapons designs listed above. These methods tend to revolve around using non-nuclear primaries to set off further fission or fusion reactions. For example, if antimatter were usable and controllable in macroscopic quantities, a reaction between a small amount of antimatter and an equivalent amount of matter could release energy comparable to a small fission weapon, and could in turn be used as the first stage of a very compact thermonuclear weapon. Extremely-powerful lasers could also potentially be used this way, if they could be made powerful-enough, and compact-enough, to be viable as a weapon. Most of these ideas are versions of pure fusion weapons, and share the common property that they involve hitherto unrealized technologies as their &quot;primary&quot; stages.

While many nations have invested significantly in inertial confinement fusion research programs, since the 1970s it has not been considered promising for direct weapons use, but rather as a tool for weapons- and energy-related research that can be used in the absence of full-scale nuclear testing. Whether any nations are aggressively pursuing &quot;4th-generation&quot; weapons is not clear. In many case (as with antimatter) the underlying technology is presently thought to be very far from being viable, and if it was viable would be a powerful weapon in and of itself, outside of a nuclear weapons context, and without providing any significant advantages above existing nuclear weapons designs

===Pure fusion weapons===
Since the 1950s, the United States and Soviet Union investigated the possibility of releasing significant amounts of nuclear fusion energy without the use of a fission primary. Such &quot;pure fusion weapons&quot; were primarily imagined as low-yield, tactical nuclear weapons whose advantage would be their ability to be used without producing fallout on the scale of weapons that release fission products. In 1998, the United States Department of Energy declassified the following:
Red mercury, a likely hoax substance, has been hyped as a catalyst for a pure fusion weapon.

===Cobalt bombs===
A doomsday bomb, made popular by Nevil Shute&#x27;s 1957 novel, and subsequent 1959 movie, &quot;On the Beach&quot;, the cobalt bomb is a hydrogen bomb with a jacket of cobalt. The neutron-activated cobalt would have maximized the environmental damage from radioactive fallout. These bombs were popularized in the 1964 film &quot;Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&quot;; the material added to the bombs is referred to in the film as &#x27;cobalt-thorium G&#x27;.

Such &quot;salted&quot; weapons were investigated by U.S. Department of Defense. Fission products are as deadly as neutron-activated cobalt.

Initially, gamma radiation from the fission products of an equivalent size fission-fusion-fission bomb are much more intense than Cobalt-60 (): 15,000 times more intense at 1 hour; 35 times more intense at 1 week; 5 times more intense at 1 month; and about equal at 6 months. Thereafter fission drops off rapidly so that fallout is 8 times more intense than fission at 1 year and 150 times more intense at 5 years. The very long-lived isotopes produced by fission would overtake the again after about 75 years.

The triple &quot;taiga&quot; nuclear salvo test, as part of the preliminary March 1971 Pechora–Kama Canal project, produced a small amount of fission products and therefore a comparatively large amount of case material activated products are responsible for most of the residual activity at the site today, namely . fusion generated neutron activation was responsible for about half of the gamma dose at the test site. That dose is too small to cause deleterious effects, and normal green vegetation exists all around the lake that was formed.

===Arbitrarily large multi-staged devices===
The idea of a device which has an arbitrarily large number of Teller-Ulam stages, with each driving a larger radiation-driven implosion than the preceding stage, is frequently suggested, but technically disputed. There are &quot;well-known sketches and some reasonable-looking calculations in the open literature about two-stage weapons, but no similarly accurate descriptions of true three stage concepts.&quot;

During the mid-1950s through early 1960s, scientists working in the weapons laboratories of the United States investigated weapons concepts as large as 1,000 megatons, and Edward Teller announced the design of a 10,000-megaton weapon code-named SUNDIAL at a meeting of the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission. Much of the information about these efforts remains classified, but such &quot;gigaton&quot; range weapons do not appear to have made it beyond theoretical investigations.

While both the US and Soviet Union investigated (and in the case of the Soviets, tested) &quot;very high yield&quot; (e.g. 50 to 100-megaton) weapons designs in the 1950s and early 1960s, these appear to represent the upper-limit of Cold War weapon yields pursued seriously, and were so physically heavy and massive that they could not be carried entirely within the bomb bays of the largest bombers. Cold War warhead development trends from the mid-1960s onward, and especially after the Limited Test Ban Treaty, instead resulted in highly-compact warheads with yields in the range from hundreds of kilotons to the low megatons that gave greater options for deliverability.

Following the concern caused by the estimated gigaton scale of the 1994 Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 impacts on the planet Jupiter, in a 1995 meeting at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), Edward Teller proposed to a collective of U.S. and Russian ex-Cold War weapons designers that they collaborate on designing a 1,000-megaton nuclear explosive device for diverting extinction-class asteroids (10+ km in diameter), which would be employed in the event that one of these asteroids were on an impact trajectory with Earth.

===Neutron bombs===
A neutron bomb, technically referred to as an enhanced radiation weapon (ERW), is a type of tactical nuclear weapon designed specifically to release a large portion of its energy as energetic neutron radiation. This contrasts with standard thermonuclear weapons, which are designed to capture this intense neutron radiation to increase its overall explosive yield. In terms of yield, ERWs typically produce about one-tenth that of a fission-type atomic weapon. Even with their significantly lower explosive power, ERWs are still capable of much greater destruction than any conventional bomb. Meanwhile, relative to other nuclear weapons, damage is more focused on biological material than on material infrastructure (though extreme blast and heat effects are not eliminated).

ERWs are more accurately described as suppressed yield weapons. When the yield of a nuclear weapon is less than one kiloton, its lethal radius from blast, , is less than that from its neutron radiation. However, the blast is more than potent enough to destroy most structures, which are less resistant to blast effects than even unprotected human beings. Blast pressures of upwards of are survivable, whereas most buildings will collapse with a pressure of only .

Commonly misconceived as a weapon designed to kill populations and leave infrastructure intact, these bombs (as mentioned above) are still very capable of leveling buildings over a large radius. The intent of their design was to kill tank crews – tanks giving excellent protection against blast and heat, surviving (relatively) very close to a detonation. Given the Soviets&#x27; vast tank forces during the Cold War, this was the perfect weapon to counter them. The neutron radiation could instantly incapacitate a tank crew out to roughly the same distance that the heat and blast would incapacitate an unprotected human (depending on design). The tank chassis would also be rendered highly radioactive, temporarily preventing its re-use by a fresh crew.

Neutron weapons were also intended for use in other applications, however. For example, they are effective in anti-nuclear defenses – the neutron flux being capable of neutralising an incoming warhead at a greater range than heat or blast. Nuclear warheads are very resistant to physical damage, but are very difficult to harden against extreme neutron flux.

ERWs were two-stage thermonuclears with all non-essential uranium removed to minimize fission yield. Fusion provided the neutrons. Developed in the 1950s, they were first deployed in the 1970s, by U.S. forces in Europe. The last ones were retired in the 1990s.

A neutron bomb is only feasible if the yield is sufficiently high that efficient fusion stage ignition is possible, and if the yield is low enough that the case thickness will not absorb too many neutrons. This means that neutron bombs have a yield range of 1–10 kilotons, with fission proportion varying from 50% at 1 kiloton to 25% at 10 kilotons (all of which comes from the primary stage). The neutron output per kiloton is then 10 to 15 times greater than for a pure fission implosion weapon or for a strategic warhead like a W87 or W88.

==Weapon design laboratories==

All the nuclear weapon design innovations discussed in this article originated from the following three labs in the manner described. Other nuclear weapon design labs in other countries duplicated those design innovations independently, reverse-engineered them from fallout analysis, or acquired them by espionage.

===Lawrence Berkeley===

The first systematic exploration of nuclear weapon design concepts took place in mid-1942 at the University of California, Berkeley. Important early discoveries had been made at the adjacent Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, such as the 1940 cyclotron-made production and isolation of plutonium. A Berkeley professor, J. Robert Oppenheimer, had just been hired to run the nation&#x27;s secret bomb design effort. His first act was to convene the 1942 summer conference.

By the time he moved his operation to the new secret town of Los Alamos, New Mexico, in the spring of 1943, the accumulated wisdom on nuclear weapon design consisted of five lectures by Berkeley professor Robert Serber, transcribed and distributed as the (classified but now fully declassified and widely available online as a PDF) Los Alamos Primer. The Primer addressed fission energy, neutron production and capture, nuclear chain reactions, critical mass, tampers, predetonation, and three methods of assembling a bomb: gun assembly, implosion, and &quot;autocatalytic methods&quot;, the one approach that turned out to be a dead end.

===Los Alamos===

At Los Alamos, it was found in April 1944 by Emilio Segrè that the proposed Thin Man Gun assembly type bomb would not work for plutonium because of predetonation problems caused by Pu-240 impurities. So Fat Man, the implosion-type bomb, was given high priority as the only option for plutonium. The Berkeley discussions had generated theoretical estimates of critical mass, but nothing precise. The main wartime job at Los Alamos was the experimental determination of critical mass, which had to wait until sufficient amounts of fissile material arrived from the production plants: uranium from Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and plutonium from the Hanford Site in Washington.

In 1945, using the results of critical mass experiments, Los Alamos technicians fabricated and assembled components for four bombs: the &quot;Trinity&quot; Gadget, Little Boy, Fat Man, and an unused spare Fat Man. After the war, those who could, including Oppenheimer, returned to university teaching positions. Those who remained worked on levitated and hollow pits and conducted weapon effects tests such as Crossroads Able and Baker at Bikini Atoll in 1946.

All of the essential ideas for incorporating fusion into nuclear weapons originated at Los Alamos between 1946 and 1952. After the Teller-Ulam radiation implosion breakthrough of 1951, the technical implications and possibilities were fully explored, but ideas not directly relevant to making the largest possible bombs for long-range Air Force bombers were shelved.

Because of Oppenheimer&#x27;s initial position in the H-bomb debate, in opposition to large thermonuclear weapons, and the assumption that he still had influence over Los Alamos despite his departure, political allies of Edward Teller decided he needed his own laboratory in order to pursue H-bombs. By the time it was opened in 1952, in Livermore, California, Los Alamos had finished the job Livermore was designed to do.

===Lawrence Livermore===

With its original mission no longer available, the Livermore lab tried radical new designs that failed. Its first three nuclear tests were fizzles: in 1953, two single-stage fission devices with uranium hydride pits, and in 1954, a two-stage thermonuclear device in which the secondary heated up prematurely, too fast for radiation implosion to work properly.

Shifting gears, Livermore settled for taking ideas Los Alamos had shelved and developing them for the Army and Navy. This led Livermore to specialize in small-diameter tactical weapons, particularly ones using two-point implosion systems, such as the Swan. Small-diameter tactical weapons became primaries for small-diameter secondaries. Around 1960, when the superpower arms race became a ballistic missile race, Livermore warheads were more useful than the large, heavy Los Alamos warheads. Los Alamos warheads were used on the first intermediate-range ballistic missiles, IRBMs, but smaller Livermore warheads were used on the first intercontinental ballistic missiles, ICBMs, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles, SLBMs, as well as on the first multiple warhead systems on such missiles.

In 1957 and 1958, both labs built and tested as many designs as possible, in anticipation that a planned 1958 test ban might become permanent. By the time testing resumed in 1961 the two labs had become duplicates of each other, and design jobs were assigned more on workload considerations than lab specialty. Some designs were horse-traded. For example, the W38 warhead for the Titan I missile started out as a Livermore project, was given to Los Alamos when it became the Atlas missile warhead, and in 1959 was given back to Livermore, in trade for the W54 Davy Crockett warhead, which went from Livermore to Los Alamos.

Warhead designs after 1960 took on the character of model changes, with every new missile getting a new warhead for marketing reasons. The chief substantive change involved packing more fissile uranium-235 into the secondary, as it became available with continued uranium enrichment and the dismantlement of the large high-yield bombs.

Starting with the Nova facility at Livermore in the mid-1980s, nuclear design activity pertaining to radiation-driven implosion was informed by research with &quot;indirect drive&quot; laser fusion. This work was part of the effort to investigate Inertial Confinement Fusion. Similar work continues at the more powerful National Ignition Facility. The Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program also benefited from research performed at NIF.

==Explosive testing==
Nuclear weapons are in large part designed by trial and error. The trial often involves test explosion of a prototype.

In a nuclear explosion, a large number of discrete events, with various probabilities, aggregate into short-lived, chaotic energy flows inside the device casing. Complex mathematical models are required to approximate the processes, and in the 1950s there were no computers powerful enough to run them properly. Even today&#x27;s computers and simulation software are not adequate.

It was easy enough to design reliable weapons for the stockpile. If the prototype worked, it could be weaponized and mass-produced.

It was much more difficult to understand how it worked or why it failed. Designers gathered as much data as possible during the explosion, before the device destroyed itself, and used the data to calibrate their models, often by inserting into equations to make the simulations match experimental results. They also analyzed the weapon debris in fallout to see how much of a potential nuclear reaction had taken place.

===Light pipes===
An important tool for test analysis was the diagnostic light pipe. A probe inside a test device could transmit information by heating a plate of metal to incandescence, an event that could be recorded by instruments located at the far end of a long, very straight pipe.

The picture below shows the Shrimp device, detonated on March 1, 1954, at Bikini, as the Castle Bravo test. Its 15-megaton explosion was the largest ever by the United States. The silhouette of a man is shown for scale. The device is supported from below, at the ends. The pipes going into the shot cab ceiling, which appear to be supports, are actually diagnostic light pipes. The eight pipes at the right end (1) sent information about the detonation of the primary. Two in the middle (2) marked the time when X-rays from the primary reached the radiation channel around the secondary. The last two pipes (3) noted the time radiation reached the far end of the radiation channel, the difference between (2) and (3) being the radiation transit time for the channel.
From the shot cab, the pipes turned horizontally and traveled along a causeway built on the Bikini reef to a remote-controlled data collection bunker on Namu Island.

While x-rays would normally travel at the speed of light through a low-density material like the plastic foam channel filler between (2) and (3), the intensity of radiation from the exploding primary creates a relatively opaque radiation front in the channel filler, which acts like a slow-moving logjam to retard the passage of radiant energy. While the secondary is being compressed via radiation-induced ablation, neutrons from the primary catch up with the x-rays, penetrate into the secondary, and start breeding tritium via the third reaction noted in the first section above. This 6Li + n reaction is exothermic, producing 5 MeV per event. The spark plug has not yet been compressed and thus remains subcritical, so no significant fission or fusion takes place as a result. If enough neutrons arrive before implosion of the secondary is complete, though, the crucial temperature differential between the outer and inner parts of the secondary can be degraded, potentially causing the secondary to fail to ignite. The first Livermore-designed thermonuclear weapon, the Morgenstern device, failed in this manner when it was tested as Castle Koon on April 7, 1954. The primary ignited, but the secondary, preheated by the primary&#x27;s neutron wave, suffered what was termed as an &quot;inefficient detonation&quot;; thus, a weapon with a predicted one-megaton yield produced only 110 kilotons, of which merely 10 kt were attributed to fusion.

These timing effects, and any problems they cause, are measured by light-pipe data. The mathematical simulations which they calibrate are called radiation flow hydrodynamics codes, or channel codes. They are used to predict the effect of future design modifications.

It is not clear from the public record how successful the Shrimp light pipes were. The unmanned data bunker was far enough back to remain outside the mile-wide crater, but the 15-megaton blast, two and a half times as powerful as expected, breached the bunker by blowing its 20-ton door off the hinges and across the inside of the bunker. (The nearest people were farther away, in a bunker that survived intact.)

===Fallout analysis===

The most interesting data from Castle Bravo came from radio-chemical analysis of weapon debris in fallout. Because of a shortage of enriched lithium-6, 60% of the lithium in the Shrimp secondary was ordinary lithium-7, which doesn&#x27;t breed tritium as easily as lithium-6 does. But it does breed lithium-6 as the product of an (n, 2n) reaction (one neutron in, two neutrons out), a known fact, but with unknown probability. The probability turned out to be high.

Fallout analysis revealed to designers that, with the (n, 2n) reaction, the Shrimp secondary effectively had two and half times as much lithium-6 as expected. The tritium, the fusion yield, the neutrons, and the fission yield were all increased accordingly.

As noted above, Bravo&#x27;s fallout analysis also told the outside world, for the first time, that thermonuclear bombs are more fission devices than fusion devices. A Japanese fishing boat, &quot;Daigo Fukuryū Maru&quot;, steamed home with enough fallout on her decks to allow scientists in Japan and elsewhere to determine, and announce, that most of the fallout had come from the fission of U-238 by fusion-produced 14 MeV neutrons.

===Underground testing===
The global alarm over radioactive fallout, which began with the Castle Bravo event, eventually drove nuclear testing literally underground. The last U.S. above-ground test took place at Johnston Island on November 4, 1962. During the next three decades, until September 23, 1992, the United States conducted an average of 2.4 underground nuclear explosions per month, all but a few at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) northwest of Las Vegas.

The Yucca Flat section of the NTS is covered with subsidence craters resulting from the collapse of terrain over radioactive caverns created by nuclear explosions (see photo).

After the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT), which limited underground explosions to 150 kilotons or less, warheads like the half-megaton W88 had to be tested at less than full yield. Since the primary must be detonated at full yield in order to generate data about the implosion of the secondary, the reduction in yield had to come from the secondary. Replacing much of the lithium-6 deuteride fusion fuel with lithium-7 hydride limited the tritium available for fusion, and thus the overall yield, without changing the dynamics of the implosion. The functioning of the device could be evaluated using light pipes, other sensing devices, and analysis of trapped weapon debris. The full yield of the stockpiled weapon could be calculated by extrapolation.

==Production facilities==

When two-stage weapons became standard in the early 1950s, weapon design determined the layout of the new, widely dispersed U.S. production facilities, and vice versa.

Because primaries tend to be bulky, especially in diameter, plutonium is the fissile material of choice for pits, with beryllium reflectors. It has a smaller critical mass than uranium. The Rocky Flats plant near Boulder, Colorado, was built in 1952 for pit production and consequently became the plutonium and beryllium fabrication facility.

The Y-12 plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where mass spectrometers called calutrons had enriched uranium for the Manhattan Project, was redesigned to make secondaries. Fissile U-235 makes the best spark plugs because its critical mass is larger, especially in the cylindrical shape of early thermonuclear secondaries. Early experiments used the two fissile materials in combination, as composite Pu-Oy pits and spark plugs, but for mass production, it was easier to let the factories specialize: plutonium pits in primaries, uranium spark plugs and pushers in secondaries.

Y-12 made lithium-6 deuteride fusion fuel and U-238 parts, the other two ingredients of secondaries.

The Hanford Site near Richland WA operated Plutonium production nuclear reactors and separations facilities during World War 2 and the Cold War. Nine Plutonium production reactors were built and operated there. The first being the B-Reactor which began operations in September 1944 and the last being the N-Reactor which ceased operations in January 1987.

The Savannah River Site in Aiken, South Carolina, also built in 1952, operated nuclear reactors which converted U-238 into Pu-239 for pits, and converted lithium-6 (produced at Y-12) into tritium for booster gas. Since its reactors were moderated with heavy water, deuterium oxide, it also made deuterium for booster gas and for Y-12 to use in making lithium-6 deuteride.

==Warhead design safety==
Because even low-yield nuclear warheads have astounding destructive power, weapon designers have always recognised the need to incorporate mechanisms and associated procedures intended to prevent accidental detonation.

===Gun-type===
It is inherently dangerous to have a weapon containing a quantity and shape of fissile material which can form a critical mass through a relatively simple accident. Because of this danger, the propellant in Little Boy (four bags of cordite) was inserted into the bomb in flight, shortly after takeoff on August 6, 1945. This was the first time a gun-type nuclear weapon had ever been fully assembled.

If the weapon falls into water, the moderating effect of the water can also cause a criticality accident, even without the weapon being physically damaged. Similarly, a fire caused by an aircraft crashing could easily ignite the propellant, with catastrophic results. Gun-type weapons have always been inherently unsafe.

===In-flight pit insertion===
Neither of these effects is likely with implosion weapons since there is normally insufficient fissile material to form a critical mass without the correct detonation of the lenses. However, the earliest implosion weapons had pits so close to criticality that accidental detonation with some nuclear yield was a concern.

On August 9, 1945, Fat Man was loaded onto its airplane fully assembled, but later, when levitated pits made a space between the pit and the tamper, it was feasible to use in-flight pit insertion. The bomber would take off with no fissile material in the bomb. Some older implosion-type weapons, such as the US Mark 4 and Mark 5, used this system.

In-flight pit insertion will not work with a hollow pit in contact with its tamper.

===Steel ball safety method===
As shown in the diagram above, one method used to decrease the likelihood of accidental detonation employed metal balls. The balls were emptied into the pit: this prevented detonation by increasing the density of the hollow pit, thereby preventing symmetrical implosion in the event of an accident. This design was used in the Green Grass weapon, also known as the Interim Megaton Weapon, which was used in the Violet Club and Yellow Sun Mk.1 bombs.

===Chain safety method===
Alternatively, the pit can be &quot;safed&quot; by having its normally hollow core filled with an inert material such as a fine metal chain, possibly made of cadmium to absorb neutrons. While the chain is in the center of the pit, the pit cannot be compressed into an appropriate shape to fission; when the weapon is to be armed, the chain is removed. Similarly, although a serious fire could detonate the explosives, destroying the pit and spreading plutonium to contaminate the surroundings as has happened in several weapons accidents, it could not cause a nuclear explosion.

===One-point safety===
While the firing of one detonator out of many will not cause a hollow pit to go critical, especially a low-mass hollow pit that requires boosting, the introduction of two-point implosion systems made that possibility a real concern.

In a two-point system, if one detonator fires, one entire hemisphere of the pit will implode as designed. The high-explosive charge surrounding the other hemisphere will explode progressively, from the equator toward the opposite pole. Ideally, this will pinch the equator and squeeze the second hemisphere away from the first, like toothpaste in a tube. By the time the explosion envelops it, its implosion will be separated both in time and space from the implosion of the first hemisphere. The resulting dumbbell shape, with each end reaching maximum density at a different time, may not become critical.

It is not possible to tell on the drawing board how this will play out. Nor is it possible using a dummy pit of U-238 and high-speed x-ray cameras, although such tests are helpful. For final determination, a test needs to be made with real fissile material. Consequently, starting in 1957, a year after Swan, both labs began one-point safety tests.

Out of 25 one-point safety tests conducted in 1957 and 1958, seven had zero or slight nuclear yield (success), three had high yields of 300 t to 500 t (severe failure), and the rest had unacceptable yields between those extremes.

Of particular concern was Livermore&#x27;s W47, which generated unacceptably high yields in one-point testing. To prevent an accidental detonation, Livermore decided to use mechanical safing on the W47. The wire safety scheme described below was the result.

When testing resumed in 1961, and continued for three decades, there was sufficient time to make all warhead designs inherently one-point safe, without need for mechanical safing.

===Wire safety method===
In the last test before the 1958 moratorium the W47 warhead for the Polaris SLBM was found to not be one-point safe, producing an unacceptably high nuclear yield of of TNT equivalent (Hardtack II Titania). With the test moratorium in force, there was no way to refine the design and make it inherently one-point safe. A solution was devised consisting of a boron-coated wire inserted into the weapon&#x27;s hollow pit at manufacture. The warhead was armed by withdrawing the wire onto a spool driven by an electric motor. Once withdrawn, the wire could not be re-inserted. The wire had a tendency to become brittle during storage, and break or get stuck during arming, preventing complete removal and rendering the warhead a dud. It was estimated that 50–75% of warheads would fail. This required a complete rebuild of all W47 primaries. The oil used for lubricating the wire also promoted corrosion of the pit.

===Strong link/weak link===

Under the strong link/weak link system, &quot;weak links&quot; are constructed between critical nuclear weapon components (the &quot;hard links&quot;). In the event of an accident the weak links are designed to fail first in a manner that precludes energy transfer between them. Then, if a hard link fails in a manner that transfers or releases energy, energy can&#x27;t be transferred into other weapon systems, potentially starting a nuclear detonation. Hard links are usually critical weapon components that have been hardened to survive extreme environments, while weak links can be both components deliberately inserted into the system to act as a weak link and critical nuclear components that can fail predictably.

An example of a weak link would be an electrical connector that contains electrical wires made from a low melting point alloy. During a fire, those wires would melt, breaking any electrical connection.

===Permissive action link===

A &quot;permissive action link&quot; is an access control device designed to prevent unauthorised use of nuclear weapons. Early PALs were simple electromechanical switches and have evolved into complex arming systems that include integrated yield control options, lockout devices and anti-tamper devices.

<doc id="172913" wikidata="Q19256" url="?curid=172913" title="Lake of Tears">
<text>Lake of Tears is a Swedish heavy metal band originally formed in 1994, generally considered to play gothic metal/gothic rock and doom metal. However, their sound has expanded to include psychedelic rock and progressive rock elements. The band broke up in 2000 amid creative differences, but reunited in late 2003, releasing the acclaimed album &quot;Black Brick Road&quot;. They released their eighth studio album, &quot;Illwill&quot;, in April 2011. In 2014 they released their first live album, &quot;By the Black Sea&quot;. The band&#x27;s newest album, titled &quot;Ominous&quot;, was released on 18 February 2021.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
Lake of Tears was founded in the early 1990s by Daniel Brennare, Jonas Eriksson, Mikael Larsson and Johan Oudhuis. Their first album, entitled &quot;Greater Art&quot;, was released through the record label Black Mark Production in 1994. The album is doom metal featuring coarse, ragged vocals and crushing guitars. The band would subsequently steer away from such a directly categorized style, only revisiting it on their 2011 release &quot;Illwill&quot;.

Lake of Tears wowed critics and fans alike with their second recording, &quot;Headstones&quot;, released in 1995. The music underwent important changes, expanding on the riff-base of doom metal to achieve a more melodic and melancholic sound. The lyrics also explored new territory, intensely mournful and psychedelic fantasy imagery enhancing the album&#x27;s heavy, autumnal soundscapes.


=== Mid-career success: A Crimson Cosmos ===
1997 brought the release of the band&#x27;s most popular studio effort until then, &quot;A Crimson Cosmos&quot;. If &quot;Headstones&quot; had been a revision of their earlier sound, &quot;A Crimson Cosmos&quot; was a complete rebirth, being a hypnotically melodic album. The release&#x27;s closing track, &quot;A Crimson Cosmos&quot;, reflected a marked influence by progressive/psychedelic luminaries Pink Floyd, while other tracks, such as Lady Rosenred and Raistlin and the Rose reflected popular fantasy themes. Rhythm guitarist Jonas Eriksson had left the band before the release, being replaced by guitarist Ulrik Lindblom. After recording &quot;A Crimson Cosmos&quot; and touring with Lake of Tears until 1999, he also left the band and had to be substituted by Magnus Sahlgren, who played as lead guitarist, but only as a guest artist. Although he played on &quot;Forever Autumn&quot; and every subsequent Lake of Tears album, often composing the majority of lead guitar riffs, Sahlgren was only formally accepted as a band member following the release of 2004&#x27;s &quot;Black Brick Road&quot;.

Lake of Tears&#x27; 1999 album, &quot;Forever Autumn&quot;, did not follow the trend settled by &quot;Headstones&quot; and &quot;A Crimson Cosmos&quot;, resulting an intensely quiet and introspective album. Keyboardist Christian Saarinen was briefly included as an official band member, adding an extra layer to the band&#x27;s sound. Fantasy imagery was rife and the album&#x27;s overall effect was sedate and sorrowful.

=== The breakup ===
Because of personal and creative differences, but also (and perhaps more-so) because of the lack of attention the band received from their label, the band went their separate ways shortly after the release of &quot;Forever Autumn&quot;, though they were still contractually bound to deliver one more album for Black Mark Production. This being the case, Brennare and Sahlgren retreated to the studio to record &quot;The Neonai&quot;, an electronica-influenced album relying on drum machines and uncharacteristically slick production values. The resulting album was released in 2002, and featured some of the band&#x27;s most inspired songwriting and memorable melodies, regardless of the hasty manner in which it was composed and recorded.

=== The reunion and recent activity ===
In 2003 the band reunited out of boredom, participating in several jams. They were quick to realize that the brief hiatus had reinvigorated their collective spirits, and began to tentatively compose the material eventually released on their 2004 endeavor, &quot;Black Brick Road&quot;. Feeling that Black Mark Production had failed to market them appropriately, Lake of Tears began shopping for a new record label, and eventually settled on Noise Records. The subsequent release of &quot;Black Brick Road&quot; found the band exploring fresh concepts -the majority of the songs are highly abstract in nature, focusing on emotional states and dream- like imagery over specific nods to fantasy fiction and narrative structure. Following the album&#x27;s release, Magnus Sahlgren was finally accepted as a member of the band, making his almost five years association official.

Lake of Tears released their seventh studio album &quot;Moons and Mushrooms&quot; on 26 April 2007. The album featured a heavier approach to the guitar-work, unlike &quot;Black Brick Road&quot; whose melodies were primarily conceived via keyboard experimentation. The music was created directly in the rehearsal room, a new approach for the band. &quot;Moons and Mushrooms&quot; has a harder rock sound, though Brennare&#x27;s lyrics continued to lean towards the melancholic and conceptual.

A new album titled &quot;Illwill&quot; was released on 29 April 2011. It features an even heavier, darker approach, eschewing the band&#x27;s typical evocation of mournful themes in favor of bleak and disturbing imagery.

Lake of Tears released their first-ever live album on 31 January 2014. The album is titled &quot;By the Black Sea,&quot; and includes a full concert with 16 songs recorded earlier this year in Bucharest, Romania. It is also available as DVD/CD set.

On 13 July 2020, Daniel Brennare publicly disclosed that he had been diagnosed with chronic leukemia, and that Illwill was &quot;maybe a more obscure way&quot; of dealing with it The same post suggests the name of the next album is &quot;Ominous&quot;.

<doc id="172914" wikidata="Q285108" url="?curid=172914" title="Suicide (band)">
<text>Suicide was an American musical duo composed of vocalist Alan Vega and instrumentalist Martin Rev, intermittently active between 1970 and 2016. The group&#x27;s pioneering music used minimalist electronic instrumentation, including synthesizers and primitive drum machines, and their early performances were confrontational and often ended in violence. They were among the first acts to use the phrase &quot;punk music&quot; in an advertisement for a concert in 1970—during their very brief stint as a three-piece including Paul Liebegott.

Though never widely popular among the general public, Suicide have been recognized as among the most influential acts of their era. Their debut album &quot;Suicide&quot; (1977) was described by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; as &quot;a landmark of electronic music&quot;, while AllMusic stated that it &quot;provided the blueprints for post-punk, synth pop, and industrial rock.&quot;

==History==
In 1969, Alan Bermowitz became involved with the publicly funded : A Project of Living Artists—an artist-run 24-hour multimedia gallery at 729 Broadway in Manhattan. Producing visual art under the name Alan Suicide, Bermowitz graduated from painting to light sculptures, many of which were constructed from electronic debris. He gained a residency at the OK Harris Gallery in SoHo where he continued to exhibit until 1975. Barbara Gladstone continued to show his work well into the 1980s.

Later that same year, Bermowitz saw The Stooges perform at the New York State Pavilion; an epiphany for Bermowitz. He would later say, &quot;It showed me you didn&#x27;t have to do static artworks, you could create situations, do something environmental. That&#x27;s what got me moving more intensely in the direction of doing music. Compared with Iggy, whatever I was doing as an artist felt insignificant.&quot; 

After this, in 1970, Alan Vega and Martin &quot;Rev&quot; Reverby met through the Art Workers&#x27; Coalition. With Rev, Bermowitz began experimenting with electronic music, and formed Suicide, along with guitarist Paul Liebgott. According to a 2002 interview of Alan Vega, the name of the band was inspired by the title of a Ghost Rider comic book issue titled &quot;Satan Suicide&quot;. He further explained, &quot;We were talking about society&#x27;s suicide, especially American society. New York City was collapsing. The Vietnam War was going on. The name Suicide said it all to us.&quot;

Their first show was June 19, 1970 at the Project of Living Artists in lower Manhattan. They soon began billing themselves as &quot;punk music&quot;. Liebegott left at the end of 1971, and they continued as a duo. By that point, Vega was no longer playing any instruments, and began performing only vocals. Rev stopped playing drums and blowing whistle by early 1975. Suicide emerged alongside the early glam punk scene in New York, playing with the likes of the New York Dolls and the Fast. They began to court a reputation for confrontational live shows inspired by Iggy Pop. Many of the band&#x27;s early shows were at the Mercer Arts Center, alongside bands such as the New York Dolls and Eric Emerson and the Magic Tramps. During an early show at the Mercer Arts Center David Johansen played harmonica with Suicide. Vega and Rev both dressed like &#x27;arty street thugs&#x27;, and Vega was notorious for brandishing a motorcycle drive chain onstage. Vega once stated, &quot;We started getting booed as soon as we came onstage. Just from the way we looked, they started giving us hell already.&quot; After the collapse of the Mercer Arts Center in 1973, Suicide played at Max&#x27;s Kansas City and CBGB (before being banned), often sharing the bill with emerging punk bands. Their first album was reissued with bonus material, including &quot;23 Minutes in Brussels&quot;, a recording of a Suicide concert that later deteriorated into a riot.

Their first release was &quot;Rocket U.S.A.&quot;, which was included on the &quot;1976 Max&#x27;s Kansas City&quot; compilation. The following year, they recorded and independently released their debut album, &quot;Suicide&quot; (1977), on Red Star Records. Although initial press reviews were divided (with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in particular giving it a scathing review), media recognition has changed over the years. Nick Hornby writes, Che&#x27;, &#x27;Ghost Rider&#x27;—these eerie, sturdy, proto-punk anthems rank among the most visionary, melodic experiments the rock realm has yet produced.&quot; Of note is the ten-minute &quot;Frankie Teardrop&quot;, which tells the story of a poverty-stricken 20-year-old factory worker pushed to the edge. Critic Emerson Dameron writes that the song is &quot;one of the most terrifying, riveting, absurd things I’ve ever heard.&quot; Hornby, in his book &quot;31 Songs,&quot; describes the track as something you would listen to &quot;only once&quot;.

They played their first overseas shows in 1978, supporting Elvis Costello and the Clash in the UK and Western Europe. After a tour opening for the Cars, Alan Vega received a call from Michael Zilkha of Ze Records asking if he could sign Suicide to his label. They subsequently recorded their sophomore album &quot;&quot; with Ze at the Power Station studios. While the album was a critical success, it was not a commercial success, Alan Vega felt that &quot;nothing big for us happened&quot; after the second album was released in comparison to the first album.

===1980s and beyond===
After the second album&#x27;s release, Suicide would sporadically release new music, mostly to mixed critical and commercial reception, releasing their last album, American Supreme, in 2002. During this time, they both became involved in their own projects. In 1986, Alan Vega collaborated with Andrew Eldritch of The Sisters of Mercy on the &quot;Gift&quot; album, released under the name of The Sisterhood. In 1996, Vega collaborated with Alex Chilton and Ben Vaughn on the album &quot;Cubist Blues&quot;. Vega and Rev have both released solo albums.

In 2008, Blast First Petite released &quot;Alan Vega 70th Birthday Limited Edition EP Series&quot;—a monthly, limited-edition series of 10&quot; vinyl EPs and downloads by major artists, honoring Alan Vega&#x27;s 70th birthday. Among those paying tribute were Bruce Springsteen, Primal Scream, Peaches, Grinderman, Spiritualized, The Horrors, +Pansonic, Julian Cope, Lydia Lunch, Vincent Gallo, LIARS, and The Klaxons. The label also released &quot;Suicide: 1977–1978&quot;, a 6-CD box set, the same year.

In September 2009, the group performed their debut LP live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties-curated Don&#x27;t Look Back series.

In May 2010, the band performed the entire first album live at two London concerts, double billed with Iggy &amp; The Stooges performing &quot;Raw Power&quot;. The band performed their final concert at London&#x27;s Barbican Centre on 9 July 2015. Billed as &#x27;A Punk Mass&#x27;, the show featured solo sets by both Rev and Vega before a headlining Suicide performance. Henry Rollins, Bobby Gillespie, and Jehnny Beth made guest appearances. The concert received positive reviews.

They played their final shows in 2015, canceling Shows scheduled for the following year due to Vega&#x27;s declining health and eventual death. Alan Vega died in his sleep on July 16, 2016, at the age of 78. His death was announced by musician and radio host Henry Rollins, who shared an official statement from Vega&#x27;s family on his website.

==Musical style==
Rev&#x27;s simple keyboard riffs, which were initially played on a battered Farfisa organ combined with effects units, before changing to a synthesizer, were accompanied by primitive drum machines. This provided a pulsing, minimalistic, electronic backdrop for Vega&#x27;s murmuring and nervy vocals. It was the first band to use the term &quot;punk&quot; to describe itself, which the band had adopted from an article by Lester Bangs. Some of the band&#x27;s earliest posters use the terms &quot;&quot;punk music&quot; and &quot;punk music mass&quot;&quot;.

According to writer Alexandre Breton, the duo was influenced by musicians such as Elvis Presley, Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, Johnny Burnette, Lou Reed and Captain Beefheart. Vega directly cited artists including the Velvet Underground, Iggy Pop, ? and the Mysterians, and Silver Apples. The duo were also influenced by films and directors such as Alejandro Jodorowsky’s El Topo, David Lynch and John Waters.

==Legacy==
Musicians who have cited Suicide as an influence include Depeche Mode, Radiohead, U2, New Order, Daft Punk, Aphex Twin, Bruce Springsteen, Nick Cave, Steve Albini, Ariel Pink and AFI. Music journalist Colin Larkin wrote that Suicide, &quot;with their potent fusion of rockabilly and electronic music on cheap equipment&quot;, became an important influence on the Birthday Party, Soft Cell, Sigue Sigue Sputnik and Nine Inch Nails. Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reported that &quot;countless artists&quot; have been heavily inspired by Suicide&#x27;s debut album, including the Human League, Bauhaus and Spacemen 3.

Critic Toby Creswell identified bands such as Devo, Ultravox, the Jesus and Mary Chain, the Sisters of Mercy and Air among &quot;Suicide&#x27;s heirs&quot;, having &quot;benefited from their pioneering sheets of industrial music&quot;. According to AllMusic, Suicide&#x27;s followers include Ladytron, Perfume Genius, Sleaford Mods, Sonic Youth, the Cars, the Rapture, the Soft Moon, Laurie Anderson and Momus.

==Covers==
In 1994, &quot;The Crow: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; contains &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;, covered by the Rollins Band. That same year The Fatima Mansions released a cover of &quot;Diamonds, Fur Coat, Champagne&quot;, as part of their 1994 single &quot;Nite Flights&quot;. In May 1999, ? and the Mysterians released a cover of &quot;Cheree&quot; on the album &quot;More Action&quot;.

The riff from &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; was sampled extensively in M.I.A.&#x27;s single, &quot;Born Free&quot;, released in April 2010. Martin Rev joined M.I.A. to perform the song on the Late Show with David Letterman.

In mid-2009, the band The Horrors released a cover of the song &quot;Shadazz&quot;, as part of a tribute to Alan Vega and his work. They have performed it many times live, along with another Suicide song, &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;. Later that year, Primal Scream and Miss Kittin covered the song &quot;&quot; for a limited-edition 10-inch vinyl pressing. A total of 3,000 copies were pressed and released on March 30, 2009.

&quot;Ghost Rider&quot; was covered by the garage punk band the Gories, and released on the album &quot;Cheapo Crypt Sampler No. 2.&quot; In April 2011, the influential dance-punk band LCD Soundsystem used a snippet from &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; during the song &quot;Losing My Edge&quot;, and covered the Alan Vega solo effort &quot;Bye Bye Bayou&quot; during their final concert, held in a sold-out Madison Square Garden. The song was also covered by British duo The Last Shadow Puppets at New York City&#x27;s Terminal 5, as a tribute to Alan Vega, shortly after his death in 2016. 

In April 2012, Neneh Cherry released a cover of the song &quot;Dream Baby Dream&quot;, which appeared on her album &quot;The Cherry Thing&quot;. In May 2014, The band Savages, also released a live cover of the song as a b-side of their single &quot;Fuckers&quot;/&quot;Dream Baby Dream&quot; 12&quot;. Other artists who covered the song include Bruce Springsteen in 2016, and Many Angled Ones &amp; Guy McKnight, in August 2018.
