<text>A dark ride or ghost train is an indoor amusement ride on which passengers aboard guided vehicles travel through specially lit scenes that typically contain animation, sound, music and special effects. Appearing as early as the 19th century, such exhibits include tunnels of love, scary themes and interactive stories. Dark rides are intended to tell stories with thematic elements that immerse riders, which unfold throughout the course of the attraction.

==Terminology==

In its most traditional form, the term &quot;dark ride&quot; refers to ride-through attractions with scenes that use black lights, whereby visible light is prevented from entering the space, and only show elements that fluoresce under ultraviolet radiation are seen by the riders. The size of each room containing a scene or scenes is thus concealed, and the set designer can use forced perspective, Pepper&#x27;s ghost and other visual tricks to create the illusion of distance. Typically, these experiences also use a series of opaque doors between scenes to further control riders&#x27; views within a space-constrained building. Prominent examples include Disneyland&#x27;s Snow White&#x27;s Scary Adventures, Pinocchio&#x27;s Daring Journey, Peter Pan&#x27;s Flight, Mr. Toad&#x27;s Wild Ride and Alice in Wonderland, which all rely on the use of blacklights in almost every scene.

==History==
The first dark rides appeared in the late 19th century and were called &quot;scenic railways&quot; and &quot;pleasure railways&quot;. A popular type of dark ride commonly referred to as an old mill or tunnel of love used small boats to carry riders through water-filled canals. A Trip to the Moon began operation at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition. Marvin Rempfer and Leon Cassidy of the Pretzel Amusement Ride Company patented the first single-rail electric dark ride in 1928. Historically notable dark rides include Futurama at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, and Pirates of the Caribbean and The Haunted Mansion at Disneyland.

Modern attractions in this genre vary widely in technical sophistication. Smaller-scale rides often feature the same sorts of simple animation and sounds used since the genre&#x27;s early days, while more ambitious projects feature complex animatronics, special effects and ride vehicles utilizing cutting-edge technology.

To improve the effect and give a sense of journey, passages in dark rides frequently change direction. Sudden curves give a sense of disorientation and allow new scenes to surprise the rider. The rides may also feature sudden ascents or descents to further the excitement.

==Empirical research==
Although ever increasing investments are made in dark rides, empirical research in this area is relatively scarce. Based on a systematic literature review, a team of researchers from the University of Liechtenstein developed a model that illustrates the underlying effect mechanism that attendees of Dark Rides experience.
The model suggests that &quot;Storytelling&quot; in Dark Rides influences an attendee&#x27;s &quot;emotional attachment&quot; to the ride through the mediator of &quot;Immersion&quot;. It is assumed that a person&#x27;s prior knowledge about the ride&#x27;s story and a person&#x27;s cultural background have moderating effects on the relationship between &quot;storytelling&quot; and &quot;immersion&quot;.

==Variations==
Dark rides have a number of variations that are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

===Ghost train===

In the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand, China and Australia, dark rides with a scary theme are called &quot;ghost trains&quot;.

The first ride to use the name &quot;Ghost Train&quot; was that of Blackpool Pleasure Beach. The ride was imported in 1930 and originally called The Pretzel (due to the curving shape of its track layout); but as pretzels were little-known in Britain, it was soon renamed after &quot;The Ghost Train&quot;, a play which ran for a year in London, a film adaptation of which was showing in 1931. It was rebuilt in 1936 and has remained unchanged since. Blackpool Pleasure Beach is also home to Valhalla, a large indoor dark ride.

In Australia, a dark ride is named The Ghost Train at Luna Park, Melbourne, and a similarly-named ride was destroyed by fire in 1979 at Luna Park Sydney.

The concept is also popular in the United States. One notable ghost train from the country is The Haunted Mansion, first opened in Disneyland in Anaheim, California, on August 9, 1969.

===Interactive dark ride===

&quot;Interactive&quot; dark rides feature a component that allows riders to be involved in the attraction&#x27;s story. The first interactive dark ride ever built is El Paso at the Belgium theme park Bobbejaanland.

The vast majority of interactive dark rides are shooting dark rides, which require riders to aim and shoot at targets throughout the ride using handheld or vehicle-mounted light guns. Successfully shooting a target usually triggers special animation, such as flashing lights or moving the target. The more targets riders hit, the higher their scores at the end of the ride. The use of light guns varies between rides, from killing aliens on Men in Black: Alien Attack at Universal Studios Florida to calling turkeys on Gobbler Getaway at Holiday World &amp; Splashin&#x27; Safari. The ride systems of conventional dark rides can be easily converted into shooting dark rides. Such conversions include Duel: The Haunted House Strikes Back! at Alton Towers (until 2023 when the ride was altered) and Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s Space Ranger Spin at Disney&#x27;s Magic Kingdom. The latter uses facilities that previously housed If You Had Wings, Delta Dreamflight, and Take Flight. A recent dark ride, Wonder Mountain&#x27;s Guardian at Canada&#x27;s Wonderland, has the world&#x27;s longest interactive screen at over .

Among non-shooting interactive dark rides, Etnaland&#x27;s award-winning Haunted School is described by &quot;Park World&quot; magazine as &quot;one of the most idiosyncratic dark rides&quot;. It is themed to a school exam, with riders individually answering multiple-choice questions throughout it. Riders are graded on their responses, and each receives a school report at the end of the ride. While technically a coaster, the Gekion Live coaster at Joypolis had elements of a dark ride. It used to have a shooting element, only for it to be refurbished with a dance element (tapping buttons on the restraints) later.

===Trackless dark ride===

The Walt Disney Company is the first to develop a trackless ride system for its dark ride attractions. Trackless dark rides utilize automated guided vehicles that do not require guide rails, and thus are able to cross existing paths, reverse, and rotate. Some trackless dark rides, such as the Big Red Car Ride at Dreamworld, relied on a buried wire for navigation. Others, such as &quot;Star Wars&quot;: Rise of the Resistance at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios and Disneyland Park, Mystic Manor at Hong Kong Disneyland or at Disneyland Paris and Epcot, use Wi-Fi and RFID-based local positioning systems. The system provides more versatility for the vehicles to move in randomized patterns. The magnets in the attractions’ floor keep the vehicles “on track” with a guiding master computer system telling the vehicles where to go. The earliest form of this technology existed in warehouses, where electric box lifts robotically moved across the floor to transport boxes. In addition, the technology has been used in autonomous vacuum robots that rely on motion sensors to freely roam the floor since 1996. The trackless dark ride system as it is known today, debuted in 2000 at Tokyo Disneyland&#x27;s “Pooh&#x27;s Hunny Hunt” attraction– a dark ride based on Disney&#x27;s 1977 hit animated feature film &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;. However, while Pooh&#x27;s Hunny Hunt pioneered the trackless ride system, it was Hollywood Studio&#x27;s Tower of Terror and Epcot&#x27;s Universe of Energy attractions that first utilized the technology.

The use of virtual reality in the development of trackless technology is often overlooked. The Disney VR Studio, founded in 1992, allowed the exploration of virtual reality technology for theme park rides. Before its role in the development of the trackless system, the VR Studio used virtual prototypes to model attractions such as California Screamin’ at Disney&#x27;s California Adventure Park. Disney has used virtual simulations to allow designers to experience roller coasters before they are built and as a means of previewing complex new ride vehicles such as the free-ranging vehicles used in &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Hunny Hunt&quot;. Moreover, this computer visualization is a powerful tool for transcending language barriers. Showing a virtual prototype of &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Hunny Hunt&quot; to Japan was a cause of the implementation of the ride at Tokyo Disneyland due to its use of imaging over speech.

==== Social Barriers ====

Some dark rides are intense for riders, as they contain vigorous themed elements such as flashing lights, black light effects, sudden drops, stoppages, or other turbulent movements that may be harmful to impaired riders. As more thrill rides are created, the number of attractions that limit riders with disabilities increases. Most commonly, guests who are prohibited from riding are those who are too overweight for the ride vehicle to safely hold the guest&#x27;s weight or prevent the safety harness from locking in place. Other ride restrictions include those who do not meet a certain height requirement or are too tall to clear the attractions’ set pieces, or those who lack a certain number of arms and legs. Ride requirements are created to ensure all guests’ safety throughout the ride and are posted throughout the attractions’ queue to prevent the companies’ liability if a rider is physically harmed. However, according to Title III of the Americans Disability Act it is illegal for amusement parks to discriminate against any persons with disabilities from equal enjoyment of goods of services in a public place of accommodation. Therefore, companies such as The Walt Disney Company are required by law to accommodate any person with a physical disability who still meets the ride requirements. This often includes guests who use wheelchairs or crutches.

Services such as the Disability Access Service (DAS) at Disney theme parks instates equality between disabled and non-disabled riders in its theme parks and resorts, making these attractions largely accessible for its guests. Companies such as Universal Studios offer similar services such as the Attractions Assistance Pass (AAS). The DAS pass allows guests to reserve a spot in an attraction&#x27;s line, select a time to board the attraction, and return at their scheduled time. This allows guests who cannot physically wait in a trackless dark ride queue to still ride without being present at the queue, but still wait the same amount of time as other abled guests. Many trackless dark ride queues are tight, enclosed spaces for guests to wind through, which are often difficult for people with wheelchairs or aids to navigate.

Moreover, as the trackless ride systems are complex and the vehicles run constantly, more ride breakdowns and stoppages occur. Due to the many elements of these attractions, breakdowns occur more frequently and take more time to address. Hollywood Studio&#x27;s Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance had more than 540 unplanned stoppages in 2022, breaking down more than any other attraction at Walt Disney World that year. This can be frustrating for guests as trackless rides are some of the most popular, yet break down the most often. Trackless dark rides often have some of the longest wait times at theme parks. Wait time data from Walt Disney World in 2022 shows that Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance has an average wait time of 127 minutes at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios park, whereas the average wait time for other Disney World, non-trackless attractions is just 36 minutes. Long wait times coupled with frequent ride stoppages can be vexing for guests, but may be well worth it to those who prefer trackless dark rides to other experiences.

===Enclosed roller coaster===
While some roller coasters may be indoors, simply enclosing a roller coaster does not make it a dark ride. Dark coasters are roller coasters that feature heavily themed layouts, special effects (such as animated characters, fire, smoke, and sound/lighting effects), and a dark ride portion that abruptly transitions into a roller coaster-style layout with heavily banked turns, sharp turns, steep drops, and helices. Some of them include backward motion, and many have launch mechanisms rather than lifts. Examples include:

*Flight of Fear at Kings Island and Kings Dominion
*Blazing Fury at Dollywood
*Revenge of the Mummy at many of the Universal Destinations &amp; Experiences (themed to The Mummy film franchise, featuring a launch from the dark ride section into the coaster section)
*Seven Dwarfs Mine Train at the Magic Kingdom and Shanghai Disneyland
*Scooby-Doo Spooky Coaster at Warner Bros. Movie World (a wild mouse roller coaster with a ghost-train section, vertical lift and backwards drop)
*Space Mountain at Disney World, Disneyland Park, Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland, and Hong Kong Disneyland
*Star Wars Hyperspace Mountain at Disneyland Park (Paris)
*Verbolten at Busch Gardens Williamsburg (themed to an escape from the haunted Bavarian Black Forest, with a free-fall track section)
*Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind at EPCOT

Test Track at Epcot, Journey to the Center of the Earth at Tokyo DisneySea, and Radiator Springs Racers at Disney California Adventure each use a slot car track rather than that of a roller coaster, but they provide a similar pairing of dark ride scenes with a high-speed thrill ride.

Saw – The Ride at Thorpe Park features an enclosed dark section with strobe lighting and special effects, before the car enters the outdoor section of the ride.

===Other attractions incorporating dark ride elements===
Particularly in Disney-built or -influenced parks, a number of attractions use traditional dark-ride features, such as animatronics and theatrical lighting, but are not &quot;dark rides&quot; in that patrons do not board vehicles. Examples include the walk-through dioramas in Disneyland&#x27;s Sleeping Beauty Castle, and theater-based Disney attractions like Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln, The Hall of Presidents, The American Adventure and Walt Disney&#x27;s Enchanted Tiki Room. Walt Disney&#x27;s Carousel of Progress (and its now-closed Disneyland replacement America Sings) had four auditoriums that rotated audiences around a stationary core with show scenes.

The Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover in the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World and the Disneyland Railroad both include brief dark-ride scenes, but for the most part transport guests outdoors. Expedition Everest at Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom, Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad and Space Mountain at several Disney parks, and Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars at Hong Kong Disneyland likewise include some dark-ride elements, but function primarily as indoor/outdoor roller coasters.

<text>Guy Berkeley &quot;Berke&quot; Breathed (; born June 21, 1957) is an American cartoonist, children&#x27;s book author, director, and screenwriter, known for his comic strips &quot;Bloom County&quot;, &quot;Outland&quot;, and &quot;Opus&quot;. &quot;Bloom County&quot; earned Breathed the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning in 1987.

==Early life==
Born in Encino, California, but raised in Houston, Texas, Breathed attended Westchester High School in Houston.

==Cartooning career==
Breathed was first published when he was hired part-time by the &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot; to draw editorial cartoons for the newspaper. This job was short-lived; he was dismissed shortly after one of his cartoons (about a busing order imposed on the local school system) caused outrage. His first comic strip published regularly was &quot;The Academia Waltz,&quot; which appeared in the &quot;Daily Texan&quot;, in 1978 while he was a student at the University of Texas. During his time at the University of Texas, Breathed self-published two collections of &quot;The Academia Waltz&quot;, using the profits to pay his tuition. The comic strip attracted the notice of the editors of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, who recruited him to do a nationally syndicated strip.

On December 8, 1980, &quot;Bloom County&quot; made its debut. It featured some of the characters from &quot;Academia Waltz,&quot; including former frat-boy Steve Dallas and the paraplegic Vietnam War veteran Cutter John. At its start, the strip&#x27;s style was so similar to that of another popular strip, &quot;Doonesbury&quot;, that Doonesbury&#x27;s creator Garry Trudeau wrote to Breathed several times to indicate their similarities. Breathed has acknowledged that he borrowed liberally from &quot;Doonesbury&quot; during his early career. In the &quot;Outland&quot; collection &quot;One Last Little Peek&quot;, Breathed even put an early &quot;Bloom County&quot; side by side with the &quot;Doonesbury&quot; comic strip from which it obviously took its idea.

&quot;Bloom County&quot; earned Breathed the Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning during 1987. The strip eventually appeared in over 1,200 newspapers around the world until Breathed retired the daily strip in 1989, stating that he wanted to terminate the strip while it was still popular. At that time, he said, &quot;A good comic strip is no more eternal than a ripe melon. The ugly truth is that in most cases, comics age less gracefully than their creators&quot;.

Breathed replaced the strip with the surreal Sunday-only cartoon &quot;Outland&quot; in 1989, which reused some of the &quot;Bloom County&quot; characters, including Opus the Penguin and Bill the Cat. He ended &quot;Outland&quot; in 1995.

In 2003, Breathed began the comic strip &quot;Opus&quot;, a Sunday-only strip featuring Opus the Penguin, who was one of the main characters of &quot;Bloom County&quot;.

Several newspapers chose not to run the August 26, 2007, &quot;Opus&quot; cartoon because it might offend Muslims.

On October 6, 2008, Breathed announced plans to discontinue all work on comic strips with the final &quot;Opus&quot; strip to run on November 2, 2008. Breathed planned to focus on writing children&#x27;s books. Breathed explained that he felt that the United States was going to face &quot;tough times&quot;, and that he wanted to end the saga of his most memorable character &quot;on a lighter note&quot;.

The last &quot;Opus&quot; comic strip appeared on schedule, but in what may be a comic first, the final panel required an online link. The final panel of the strip showed Opus sleeping peacefully in the bed depicted in the classic children&#x27;s book, &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot;. This panel was available only online, and the Humane Society of the United States page that displayed it was later removed.

Breathed said that he had no regrets in leaving political cartooning, as he believed the atmosphere became too bitter for him to make quality cartoons.

In July 2015 Breathed hinted at a return to the strip when he posted a photo to Facebook of him at his computer, starting a cartoon entitled &quot;Bloom County 2015&quot;. He added: &quot;A return after 25 years. Feels like going home.&quot; The strip was later posted to Facebook. He has subsequently been posting new &quot;Bloom County&quot; strips via Facebook on an almost-daily basis, as of January 2018. (In 2016, &quot;2015&quot; was dropped from the new strip&#x27;s name.)

In 2021, Breathed penned a series of strips featuring characters from Bill Watterson&#x27;s &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;. Panels featured Watterson&#x27;s Calvin as Spaceman Spiff and Hobbes the Tiger.

==Other works==
Breathed&#x27;s syndicated and Facebook cartoon work has produced at least thirteen cartoon anthology books, as of January 2018. Starting in 1992, he designed a greeting card and gift ensemble collection for American Greetings, featuring the &quot;Bloom County&quot; characters Opus, Bill the Cat, and Milquetoast the Cockroach.

As of January 2018, Breathed has produced ten children&#x27;s picture books. Two were made into the animated films: &quot;A Wish for Wings That Work&quot; (Amblin Television/Universal Cartoon Studios, 1991) and &quot;Edwurd Fudwupper Fibbed Big&quot; (Nickelodeon Movies, 2000); one was made into the motion-capture film &quot;Mars Needs Moms&quot; (Disney, 2011). Another animated film; &quot;Hitpig!&quot;, which Breathed himself loosely adapted from his book &quot;Pete and Pickles&quot;, was produced by Aniventure, and released in 2024.

Breathed&#x27;s writing has also been featured in numerous publications, including &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Boating&quot;, and &quot;Travel and Leisure&quot;. He produced the cartoon art for the closing credits of the Texas-based 2003 film &quot;Secondhand Lions&quot;, which featured a strip called &quot;Walter and Jasmine&quot;. The panels that Breathed drew for &quot;Secondhand Lions&quot; appear in his cartoon anthology book &quot;Opus: 25 Years of His Sunday Best&quot;, in which Breathed terms them &quot;the comic strip that never was&quot;.

Breathed has been a supporter of the animal rights group PETA and illustrated the cover of earlier printings of PETA&#x27;s cookbook &quot;The Compassionate Cook, or, &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Eat the Animals!&quot;&quot;, T-shirts, and other merchandise.

Breathed cameos as himself in the 2004 short film &quot;Tim Warner: A Life in the Clouds&quot;, a fictional tale about an unhappy cartoonist and his unfunny strip, &quot;The Silver Lining&quot;.

==Personal life==

Breathed is a fan of outdoor activities such as powerboating and motorcycling. In 1986, he broke his back in an ultralight-plane crash, later incorporated into a &quot;Bloom County&quot; storyline in which Steve Dallas breaks his back after being attacked by an angry Sean Penn. Breathed also nearly lost his right arm to a boating accident.

Breathed has said that he is an atheist, yet he does not fear death more than &quot;sharing a room in a detox center with a sobbing Rush Limbaugh&quot;.

On May 18, 2008, in his comic strip &quot;Opus&quot;, Breathed announced he was suffering from a condition known as spasmodic torticollis.

<doc id="175581" wikidata="Q205204" url="?curid=175581" title="Women's suffrage">
<text>Women&#x27;s suffrage is the right of women to vote in elections. Several instances occurred in recent centuries where women were selectively given, then stripped of, the right to vote. In Sweden, conditional women&#x27;s suffrage was in effect during the Age of Liberty (1718–1772), as well as in Revolutionary and early-independence New Jersey (1776–1807) in the US.

The first territory to &quot;continuously&quot; allow women to vote to the present day is the Pitcairn Islands since 1838. The Kingdom of Hawai&#x27;i, which originally had universal suffrage in 1840, rescinded this in 1852 and was subsequently annexed by the United States in 1898. In the years after 1869, a number of provinces held by the British and Russian empires conferred women&#x27;s suffrage, and some of these became sovereign nations at a later point, like New Zealand, Australia, and Finland. Several states and territories of the United States, such as Wyoming (1869) and Utah (1870), also granted women the right to vote. Women who owned property gained the right to vote in the Isle of Man in 1881, and in 1893, women in the then self-governing British colony of New Zealand were granted the right to vote. In Australia, the colony of South Australia granted women the right to vote and stand for parliament in 1895 while the Australian Federal Parliament conferred the right to vote and stand for election in 1902 (although it allowed for the exclusion of &quot;aboriginal natives&quot;). Prior to independence, in the Russian Grand Duchy of Finland, women gained equal suffrage, with both the right to vote and to stand as candidates in 1906. National and international organizations formed to coordinate efforts towards women voting, especially the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (founded in 1904 in Berlin, Germany). 

Most major Western powers extended voting rights to women by the interwar period, including Canada (1917), Germany (1918), the United Kingdom (1918 for women over 30 who met certain property requirements, 1928 for all women), Austria, the Netherlands (1919) and the United States (1920). Notable exceptions in Europe were France, where women could not vote until 1944, Greece (equal voting rights for women did not exist there until 1952, although, since 1930, literate women were able to vote in local elections), and Switzerland (where, since 1971, women could vote at the federal level, and between 1959 and 1990, women got the right to vote at the local canton level). The last European jurisdictions to give women the right to vote were Liechtenstein in 1984 and the Swiss canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden at the local level in 1990, with the Vatican City being an absolute elective monarchy (the electorate of the Holy See, the conclave, is composed of male cardinals, rather than Vatican citizens). In some cases of direct democracy, such as Swiss cantons governed by &quot;Landsgemeinden&quot;, objections to expanding the suffrage claimed that logistical limitations, and the absence of secret ballot, made it impractical as well as unnecessary; others, such as Appenzell Ausserrhoden, instead abolished the system altogether for both women and men. 

Leslie Hume argues that the First World War changed the popular mood:

The women&#x27;s contribution to the war effort challenged the notion of women&#x27;s physical and mental inferiority and made it more difficult to maintain that women were, both by constitution and temperament, unfit to vote. If women could work in munitions factories, it seemed both ungrateful and illogical to deny them a place in the voting booth. But the vote was much more than simply a reward for war work; the point was that women&#x27;s participation in the war helped to dispel the fears that surrounded women&#x27;s entry into the public arena.

Pre-WWI opponents of women&#x27;s suffrage such as the Women&#x27;s National Anti-Suffrage League cited women&#x27;s relative inexperience in military affairs. They claimed that since women were the majority of the population, women should vote in local elections, but due to a lack of experience in military affairs, they asserted that it would be dangerous to allow them to vote in national elections.

Extended political campaigns by women and their supporters were necessary to gain legislation or constitutional amendments for women&#x27;s suffrage. In many countries, limited suffrage for women was granted before universal suffrage for men; for instance, literate women or property owners were granted suffrage before all men received it. The United Nations encouraged women&#x27;s suffrage in the years following World War II, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (1979) identifies it as a basic right with 189 countries currently being parties to this convention.

==History==

===Before the 19th century===
In ancient Athens, often cited as the birthplace of democracy, only adult male citizens who owned land were permitted to vote. Through subsequent centuries, Europe was ruled by monarchs, though various forms of parliament arose at different times. The high rank ascribed to abbesses within the Catholic Church permitted some women the right to sit and vote at national assemblies – as with various high-ranking abbesses in Medieval Germany, who were ranked among the independent princes of the empire. Their Protestant successors enjoyed the same privilege almost into modern times.

Marie Guyart, a French nun who worked with the First Nations people of Canada during the 17th century, wrote in 1654 regarding the suffrage practices of Iroquois women: &quot;These female chieftains are women of standing amongst the savages, and they have a deciding vote in the councils. They make decisions there like their male counterparts, and it is they who even delegated as first ambassadors to discuss peace.&quot; The Iroquois, like many First Nations in North America, had a matrilineal kinship system. Property and descent were passed through the female line. Women elders voted on hereditary male chiefs and could depose them.


The first independent country to introduce women&#x27;s suffrage was arguably Sweden. In Sweden, conditional women&#x27;s suffrage was in effect during the Age of Liberty (1718–1772).

In 1756, Lydia Taft became the first legal woman voter in colonial America. This occurred under British rule in the Massachusetts Colony. In a New England town meeting in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, she voted on at least three occasions. Unmarried white women who owned property could vote in New Jersey from 1776 to 1807.

In the 1792 elections in Sierra Leone, then a new British colony, all heads of household could vote and one-third were ethnic African women.

Other early instances of women&#x27;s suffrage include the Corsican Republic (1755), the Pitcairn Islands (1838), the Isle of Man (1881), and Franceville (1889–1890), but some of these operated only briefly as independent states and others were not clearly independent.

===19th century===
The female descendants of the &quot;Bounty&quot; mutineers who lived on Pitcairn Islands could vote from 1838. This right was transferred after they resettled in 1856 to Norfolk Island (now an Australian external territory).

The emergence of modern democracy generally began with male citizens obtaining the right to vote in advance of female citizens, except in the Kingdom of Hawai&#x27;i, where universal suffrage was introduced in 1840 without mention of sex; however, a constitutional amendment in 1852 rescinded female voting and put property qualifications on male voting.

The seed for the first Woman&#x27;s Rights Convention in the United States in Seneca Falls, New York, was planted in 1840, when Elizabeth Cady Stanton met Lucretia Mott at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London. The conference refused to seat Mott and other women delegates from the U.S. because of their sex. In 1851, Stanton met temperance worker Susan B. Anthony, and shortly the two would be joined in the long struggle to secure the vote for women in the U.S. In 1868 Anthony encouraged working women from the printing and sewing trades in New York, who were excluded from men&#x27;s trade unions, to form Working Women&#x27;s Associations. As a delegate to the National Labor Congress in 1868, Anthony persuaded the committee on female labor to call for votes for women and equal pay for equal work. The men at the conference deleted the reference to the vote. In the US, women in the Wyoming Territory were permitted to both vote and stand for office in 1869. Subsequent American suffrage groups often disagreed on tactics, with the National American Woman Suffrage Association arguing for a state-by-state campaign and the National Woman&#x27;s Party focusing on an amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

The 1840 constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii established a House of Representatives, but did not specify who was eligible to participate in the election of it. Some academics have argued that this omission enabled women to vote in the first elections, in which votes were cast by means of signatures on petitions; but this interpretation remains controversial. The second constitution of 1852 specified that suffrage was restricted to males over twenty years-old.

In 1849, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, in Italy, was the first European state to have a law that provided for the vote of women, for administrative elections, taking up a tradition that was already informally sometimes present in Italy.

The 1853 Constitution of the province of Vélez in the Republic of New Granada, modern day Colombia, allowed for married women, or women older than the age of 21, the right to vote within the province. However, this law was subsequently annulled by the Supreme Court of the Republic, arguing that the citizens of the province could not have more rights than those already guaranteed to the citizens of the other provinces of the country, thus eliminating female suffrage from this province in 1856.

In 1881 the Isle of Man, an internally self-governing dependent territory of the British Crown, enfranchised women property owners. With this it provided the first action for women&#x27;s suffrage within the British Isles.

The Pacific commune of Franceville (now Port Vila, Vanuatu), maintained independence from 1889 to 1890, becoming the first self-governing nation to adopt universal suffrage without distinction of sex or color, although only white males were permitted to hold office.

For countries that have their origins in self-governing colonies but later became independent nations in the 20th century, the Colony of New Zealand was the first to acknowledge women&#x27;s right to vote in 1893, largely due to a movement led by Kate Sheppard. The British protectorate of Cook Islands rendered the same right in 1893 as well. Another British colony, South Australia, followed in 1895, enacting laws which not only extended voting to women, but also made women eligible to stand for election to its parliament.

===20th century===

Following the federation of the British colonies in Australia in 1901, the new federal government enacted the Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902 which allowed female British subjects to vote and stand for election on the same terms as men. However, many indigenous Australians remained excluded from voting federally until 1962.

The first place in Europe to introduce women&#x27;s suffrage was the Grand Duchy of Finland in 1906, and it also became the first place in continental Europe to implement racially-equal suffrage for women. As a result of the 1907 parliamentary elections, Finland&#x27;s voters elected 19 women as the first female members of a representative parliament. This was one of many self-governing actions in the Russian autonomous province that led to conflict with the Russian governor of Finland, ultimately leading to the creation of the Finnish nation in 1917.

In the years before World War I, women in Norway also won the right to vote. During WWI, Denmark, Russia, Germany, and Poland also recognized women&#x27;s right to vote.

Canada gave right to vote to some women in 1917; women getting vote on same basis as men in 1920, that is, men and women of certain races or status being excluded from voting until 1960, when universal adult suffrage was achieved.
The Representation of the People Act 1918 saw British women over 30 gain the vote. Dutch women won the passive vote (allowed to run for parliament) after a revision of the Dutch Constitution in 1917 and the active vote (electing representatives) in 1919, and American women on August 26, 1920, with the passage of the 19th Amendment (the Voting Rights Act of 1965 secured voting rights for racial minorities). Irish women won the same voting rights as men in the Irish Free State constitution, 1922. In 1928, British women won suffrage on the same terms as men, that is, for ages 21 and older. The suffrage of Turkish women was introduced in 1930 for local elections and in 1934 for national elections.

By the time French women were granted the suffrage in July 1944 by Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s government in exile, by a vote of 51 for, 16 against, France had been for about a decade the only Western country that did not at least allow women&#x27;s suffrage at municipal elections.

Voting rights for women were introduced into international law by the United Nations&#x27; Human Rights Commission, whose elected chair was Eleanor Roosevelt. In 1948 the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; Article 21 stated: &quot;(1) Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives. (3) The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.&quot;

The United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Political Rights of Women, which went into force in 1954, enshrining the equal rights of women to vote, hold office, and access public services as set out by national laws.

===21st century===
One of the most recent jurisdictions to acknowledge women&#x27;s full right to vote was Bhutan in 2008 (its first national elections). Most recently, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, after both national and international condemnation and activism by feminist groups, granted Saudi women the vote and right to run for office for the first time in the 2015 local elections.

==Suffrage movements==
The suffrage movement was a broad one, made up of women and men with a wide range of views. In terms of diversity, the greatest achievement of the 20th-century woman suffrage movement was its extremely broad class base. One major division, especially in Britain, was between suffragists, who sought to create change constitutionally, and suffragettes, led by English political activist Emmeline Pankhurst, who in 1903 formed the more militant Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union. Pankhurst would not be satisfied with anything but action on the question of women&#x27;s enfranchisement, with &quot;deeds, not words&quot; the organization&#x27;s motto.

Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott were the first two women in America to organize the women&#x27;s rights convention in July 1848. Susan B. Anthony later joined the movement and helped form the National Woman&#x27;s Suffrage Association (NWSA) in May 1869. Their goal was to change the 15th Amendment because it did not mention nor include women which is why the NWSA protested against it. Around the same time, there was also another group of women who supported the 15th amendment and they called themselves American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). The American Women Suffrage Association was founded by Lucy Stone, Julia Ward Howe, and Thomas Wentworth Higginson, who were more focused on gaining access at a local level. The two groups united became one and called themselves the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA).

Throughout the world, the Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), which was established in the United States in 1873, campaigned for women&#x27;s suffrage, in addition to ameliorating the condition of prostitutes. Under the leadership of Frances Willard, &quot;the WCTU became the largest women&#x27;s organization of its day and is now the oldest continuing women&#x27;s organization in the United States.&quot;

There was also a diversity of views on a &quot;woman&#x27;s place&quot;. Suffragist themes often included the notions that women were naturally kinder and more concerned about children and the elderly. As Kraditor shows, it was often assumed that women voters would have a civilizing effect on politics, opposing domestic violence, liquor, and emphasizing cleanliness and community. An opposing theme, Kraditor argues, held that women had the same moral standards. They should be equal in every way and that there was no such thing as a woman&#x27;s &quot;natural role&quot;.

For Black women in the United States, achieving suffrage was a way to counter the disfranchisement of the men of their race. Despite this discouragement, black suffragists continued to insist on their equal political rights. Starting in the 1890s, African American women began to assert their political rights aggressively from within their own clubs and suffrage societies. &quot;If white American women, with all their natural and acquired advantages, need the ballot,&quot; argued Adella Hunt Logan of Tuskegee, Alabama, &quot;how much more do black Americans, male and female, need the strong defense of a vote to help secure their right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?&quot;

==Explanations for suffrage extensions==
Scholars have proposed different theories for variations in the timing of women&#x27;s suffrage across countries. These explanations include the activism of social movements, cultural diffusion and normative change, the electoral calculations of political parties, and the occurrence of major wars. According to Adam Przeworski, women&#x27;s suffrage tends to be extended in the aftermath of major wars.

==Impact==
Scholars have linked women&#x27;s suffrage to subsequent economic growth, the rise of the welfare state, and less interstate conflict.

==Timeline==


== By continent ==
=== Africa ===

==== Algeria ====

Women&#x27;s suffrage was in place in Algeria from 1962. 

Women&#x27;s suffrage was introduced in Algeria by the French colonial authorities after a long struggle, and confirmed after Algeria became an independent nation in 1962.
Women&#x27;s suffrage was introduced in France in 1944. This right automatically included French women residing in French Algeria; but it did not include Muslim Algerian women, since indigenous Algerians was not governed by French law, but indigenous Islamic law. 

The advocates of women&#x27;s suffrage raised the question of an extention of suffrage to Muslim women in Algeria to the French Natonal Assembly 
in 1947; in September 1947 the Organic Statute was passed which granted citizenship to Muslim women in Algeria, but Article 4 of the statue gave the Algerian Assembly free choice to decide when to exercise and introduce that reform. 
In 1949 the Justrabo Proposal put forvard in the Algerian Assembly suggested to extend suffrage to educated Muslim women, which was a very small minority, but the suggestion did not pass.

When the UN created the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) the French UN-delegate 
Marie-Hélène Lefaucheux worked to have France ratify it in order to force them to introduce suffrage in Algeria. 
She succeeded on 20 December 1952 when General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Political Rights of Women.
After this, there was great pressure on France to introduce this reform in the Algerian colony. The French colonial authorities finally passed women&#x27;s suffrage in 1958.

Algeria became an independent nation in 1962, and the Algerian Constitution of 1962 confirmed the excisting equal political rights to vote and be elected to all citizens.

==== Egypt ====
The struggle for women&#x27;s suffrage in Egypt first sparked from the nationalist 1919 Revolution in which women of all classes took to the streets in protest against the British occupation. The struggle was led by several Egyptian women&#x27;s rights pioneers in the first half of the 20th century through protest, journalism, and lobbying, through women&#x27;s organizations, primarily the Egyptian Feminist Union (EFU). President Gamal Abdel-Nasser supported women&#x27;s suffrage in 1956 after they were denied the vote under the British occupation.

==== Liberia ====

In 1920, the women&#x27;s movement organized in the National Liberian Women&#x27;s Social and Political Movement, who campaigned without success for women&#x27;s suffrage, followed by the Liberia Women&#x27;s League and the Liberian Women&#x27;s Social and Political Movement, and in 1946, limited suffrage was finally introduced for women of the privileged Libero-American elite, and expanded to universal women&#x27;s suffrage in 1951.

==== Libya ====

In Kingdom of Libya (1951-1969) the 1951 Constitution did secure women basic rights, since they were not excluded from the rights granted to all citizens under the constitution. A women&#x27;s movement was organized by a minority of educated urban elite women who wished to secure women equal rights, starting with the first women&#x27;s association in Benghazi 1955, followed by bone in Tripoli in 1957. 

The municial suffrage was granted in 1951. The Constitution of 1963 extended the suffrage to women.

====Morocco====

Women&#x27;s suffrage was introduced in Morocco in 1963. 

The right to vote was technically granted for both the local and national levels on 1 September 1959. This right was however not enforced until 18 June 1963.

The first woman was elected to Parliament in 1993, thirty years after women first participated in the election as voters.

==== Sierra Leone ====
One of the first occasions when women were able to vote was in the elections of the Nova Scotian settlers at Freetown. In the 1792 elections, all heads of household could vote and one-third were ethnic African women.
Women won the right to vote in Sierra Leone in 1930.

==== South Africa ====
The campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage was conducted largely by the Women&#x27;s Enfranchisement Association of the Union, which was founded in 1911.

The franchise was extended to white women 21 years or older by the Women&#x27;s Enfranchisement Act, 1930. The first general election at which women could vote was the 1933 election. At that election Leila Reitz (wife of Deneys Reitz) was elected as the first female MP, representing Parktown for the South African Party. The limited voting rights available to non-white men in the Cape Province and Natal (Transvaal and the Orange Free State practically denied all non-whites the right to vote, and had also done so to white foreign nationals when independent in the 1800s) were not extended to women, and were themselves progressively eliminated between 1936 and 1968.

The right to vote for the Transkei Legislative Assembly, established in 1963 for the Transkei bantustan, was granted to all adult citizens of the Transkei, including women. Similar provision was made for the Legislative Assemblies created for other bantustans. All adult coloured citizens were eligible to vote for the Coloured Persons Representative Council, which was established in 1968 with limited legislative powers; the council was however abolished in 1980. Similarly, all adult Indian citizens were eligible to vote for the South African Indian Council in 1981. In 1984 the Tricameral Parliament was established, and the right to vote for the House of Representatives and House of Delegates was granted to all adult Coloured and Indian citizens, respectively.

In 1994 the bantustans and the Tricameral Parliament were abolished and the right to vote for the National Assembly was granted to all adult citizens.

==== Southern Rhodesia ====
Southern Rhodesian white women won the vote in 1919 and Ethel Tawse Jollie (1875–1950) was elected to the Southern Rhodesia legislature 1920–1928, the first woman to sit in any national Commonwealth Parliament outside Westminster. The influx of women settlers from Britain proved a decisive factor in the 1922 referendum that rejected annexation by a South Africa increasingly under the sway of traditionalist Afrikaner Nationalists in favor of Rhodesian Home Rule or &quot;responsible government&quot;. Black Rhodesian males qualified for the vote in 1923 (based only upon property, assets, income, and literacy). It is unclear when the first black woman qualified for the vote.

====Tunisia====

Women&#x27;s suffrage was introduced in Tunisia in 1957. 

The context of the introduction of women&#x27;s suffrage in Tunisia was a part of a big reform program in women&#x27;s rights. Tunisia became an independent nation in 1956 and saw a number of progressive reforms in favor of women&#x27;s rights under the Secular President Habib Bourguiba, whose Code of Personal Statue (CSP) replaced the Islamic sharia law with a secular family law: raised the age of marriage, abolished arranged marriages and polygamy and introduced equal divorce law, as well as breaking Islamic sex segregation and encouraged women to appear unveiled. This progressive policy was compleeted by the introduction of women&#x27;s suffrage the same year. 
Women were granted the right to vote in 1957, and became eligible for political office in 1959.

=== Asia ===
==== Afghanistan ====
Women were granted suffrage in 1919 but elections were abolished in 1929. Women were again granted suffrage in 1964, and have been able to vote in Afghanistan since 1965 (except during Taliban rule, 1996–2001, when no elections were held). , women have been casting fewer ballots in part due to being unaware of their voting rights. In the 2014 election, Afghanistan&#x27;s elected president pledged to bring women equal rights.

In early 2021, there were 69 women elected as Members of Parliament in Afghanistan; however, after the Fall of Kabul in late 2021, 60 of them fled the country. Legally, women are allowed to vote. However, there have been no government elections in the country since 2021, and all political parties have been banned since 2023.

====Bahrain ====

The Bahrain formally introduced women&#x27;s suffrage in 2002, when Article 1, Paragraph E, of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Bahrain, explicitly included women in the citizens eligible to vote.

==== Bangladesh ====
Bangladesh was (mostly) the province of Bengal in British India until 1947 when it became part of Pakistan. It became an independent nation in 1971. Women have had equal suffrage since 1947, and they have reserved seats in parliament. Bangladesh is notable in that since 1991, two women, namely Sheikh Hasina and Begum Khaleda Zia, have served terms as the country&#x27;s Prime Minister continuously. Women have traditionally played a minimal role in politics beyond the anomaly of the two leaders; few used to run against men; few have been ministers. Recently, however, women have become more active in politics, with several prominent ministerial posts given to women and women participating in national, district and municipal elections against men and winning on several occasions. Choudhury and Hasanuzzaman argue that the strong patriarchal traditions of Bangladesh explain why women are so reluctant to stand up in politics.

==== China ====
The fight for women&#x27;s suffrage in China was organized when Tang Qunying founded the women&#x27;s suffrage organization Nüzi chanzheng tongmenghui, to ensure that women&#x27;s suffrage would be included in the first Constitution drafted after the abolition of the Chinese monarchy in 1911–1912. A short but intense period of campaigning was ended with failure in 1914.

In the following period, local governments in China introduced women&#x27;s suffrage in their own territories, such as Hunan and Guangdong in 1921 and Sichuan in 1923.

Women&#x27;s suffrage was included by the Kuomintang Government in the Constitution of 1936, but because of the war, the reform could not be enacted until after the war and was finally introduced in 1947.

==== India ====

Women in India were allowed to vote right from the first general elections after the independence of India in 1947 unlike during the British rule who resisted allowing women to vote. The Women&#x27;s Indian Association (WIA) was founded in 1917. It sought votes for women and the right to hold legislative office on the same basis as men. These positions were endorsed by the main political groupings, the Indian National Congress. British and Indian feminists combined in 1918 to publish a magazine &quot;Stri Dharma&quot; that featured international news from a feminist perspective. In 1919 in the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms, the British set up provincial legislatures which had the power to grant women&#x27;s suffrage. Madras in 1921 granted votes to wealthy and educated women, under the same terms that applied to men. The other provinces followed, but not the princely states (which did not have votes for men either, being monarchies). In Bengal province, the provincial assembly rejected it in 1921 but Southard shows an intense campaign produced victory in 1921. Success in Bengal depended on middle class Indian women, who emerged from a fast-growing urban elite. The women leaders in Bengal linked their crusade to a moderate nationalist agenda, by showing how they could participate more fully in nation-building by having voting power. They carefully avoided attacking traditional gender roles by arguing that traditions could coexist with political modernization.

Whereas wealthy and educated women in Madras were granted voting right in 1921, in Punjab the Sikhs granted women equal voting rights in 1925, irrespective of their educational qualifications or being wealthy or poor. This happened when the Gurdwara Act of 1925 was approved. The original draft of the Gurdwara Act sent by the British to the Sharomani Gurdwara Prabhandak Committee (SGPC) did not include Sikh women, but the Sikhs inserted the clause without the women having to ask for it. Equality of women with men is enshrined in the Guru Granth Sahib, the sacred scripture of the Sikh faith.

In the Government of India Act 1935 the British Raj set up a system of separate electorates and separate seats for women. Most women&#x27;s leaders opposed segregated electorates and demanded adult franchise. In 1931 the Congress promised universal adult franchise when it came to power. It enacted equal voting rights for both men and women in 1947.

==== Indonesia ====
Indonesia granted women voting rights for municipal councils in 1905. Only men who could read and write could vote, which excluded many non-European males. At the time, the literacy rate for males was 11% and for females 2%. The main group that pressed for women&#x27;s suffrage in Indonesia was the Dutch Vereeninging voor Vrouwenkiesrecht (VVV-Women&#x27;s Suffrage Association), founded in the Netherlands in 1894. VVV tried to attract Indonesian members, but had very limited success because the leaders of the organization had little skill in relating to even the educated class of Indonesians. When they eventually did connect somewhat with women, they failed to sympathize with them and ended up alienating many well-educated Indonesians. In 1918, the first national representative body, the Volksraad, was formed which still excluded women from voting. Indigenous women did not organize until the Perikatan Perempuan Indonesia (PPI, Indonesian Women Association) in 1928. In 1935, the colonial administration used its power of nomination to appoint a European woman to the Volksraad. In 1938, women gained the right to be elected to urban representative institutions, which led to some Indonesian and European women entering municipal councils. Eventually, only European women and municipal councils could vote, excluding all other women and local councils. In September 1941, the Volksraad extended the vote to women of all races. Finally, in November 1941, the right to vote for municipal councils was granted to all women on a similar basis to men (subject to property and educational qualifications).

==== Iran ====
Women&#x27;s suffrage had been expressly excluded in the Iranian Constitution of 1906 and a women&#x27;s rights movement had been organized, which supported women&#x27;s suffrage.

In 1942, the Women’s party of Iran (Ḥezb-e zanān-e Īrān) was founded to work to introduce the reform, and in 1944, the women&#x27;s group of the Tudeh Party of Iran, the Democratic Society of Women (Jāmeʿa-ye demokrāt-e zanān) put forward a suggestion of women&#x27;s suffrage in the Parliament, which was however blocked by the Islamic conservatives. In 1956, a new campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage was launched by the New Path Society (Jamʿīyat-e rāh-e now), the Association of Women Lawyers (Anjoman-e zanān-e ḥoqūqdān) and the League of Women Supporters of Human Rights (Jamʿīyat-e zanān-e ṭarafdār-e ḥoqūq-e bašar).

After this, the reform was actively supported by the Shah and included as a part of his modernization program, the White Revolution. A referendum in January 1963 overwhelmingly approved by voters gave women the right to vote, a right previously denied to them under the Iranian Constitution of 1906 pursuant to Chapter 2, Article 3.

==== Iraq ====

Full women&#x27;s suffrage was introduced in Iraq in 1980. 

The campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage started in the 1920s. The women&#x27;s movement in Iraq organized in 1923 with the &quot;Nahda al-Nisa&quot; (Women&#x27;s Awakening Club), lead by Asma al-Zahawi and with elite women such as Naima a-Said, and Fakhriyya al-Askari among their members. 
King Faysal himself had supported women&#x27;s suffrage during his prior short tenure as king in Syria. 
Feminists such as Mary Wazir and Paulina Hasun raised the issue in the 1920s. 
Paulina Hassan published the first Iraqi women&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Layla&quot;, in 1923-1925, followed by a number of women&#x27;s magazines in the 1930s and 1940s that voiced feminist demands. 
When the Constituent Assembly of Iraq was inaugurated in 1924, Paulina Hassun appealed to the Assembly that women should not be excluded from political participation in the new nation, and one of the members, Amjad al-Umari, unsuccesfully proposed that the word &quot;male&quot; be erased from the Electoral Law to include women in it.

The Women&#x27;s suffrage reform was primarily supported by the opposition parties, notably the Iraq Communist Party.
During the 1930s, the Communist ICP and the leftist al-Ahali supported women&#x27;s suffrage. 
Even those supporting the reform, however, often did so with the reservation that woman should reach a higher level of education before they were ready for it.

The Iraqi monarchy prioritized foreign policy rather than internal issues and showed little enthusiasm to adress the issue of women&#x27;s suffrage.
The monarchy was careful to avoid alienating conservative and religious circles, who considered women&#x27;s suffrage as imcompatible with the &quot;nature&quot; of women, the proper social order and gender hierarchies, and women&#x27;s suffrage was not given refused serious consideration. 
Both the Sunni and Shia clergy rejected women&#x27;s suffrage as being in opposition to the natural roles of gender, as the &quot;joke of the day&quot;, an attack on the law of nature and the proper way of life, since women were the weaker sex and &quot;lesser persons&quot; similar to children.
When women&#x27;s suffrage in Syria was introduced in 1949, MP Farhan al-Irs of al-Amara commented: &quot;Women are shameful. How could they possibly sit with men?&quot;

In 1951 a motion to include women in the Electoral Law was rejected in the Chamber of Deputies.
During the discussion to change the electoral law to include women&#x27;s suffrage in March-April 1951, the MP Abd al-Abbas of Diwaniyya oposed suffrage as this would contradict Islamic sex segregation, as elected women MP would then sit among male MPs in the Chamber of Deputies: &quot;Is this not forbidden? Are we not all of Islam?&quot; 
An electoral decree in December 1952 provided direct elections but did not include women.
A Sunni scholar published an article in the paper al-Sijill in October 1952 named &quot;The Crime of Equality Between Men and Women&quot;: as an imam and khatib of the mosques of Bahgdad and scholar of the al-Azhar Unversity, he stated that women&#x27;s suffrage was a plot againat Islam and contrary to Quranic verses which delineated gender hierarchies that made women in politics incompatible.

A number of women&#x27;s organization was founded in the 1940s and 1950s that campaigned for women&#x27;s rights including suffrage, notably the Iraqi Union for Women&#x27;s Rights (1952). 
Naziha al-Dulaimi of the League for Defence of Women&#x27;s Rights (Iraqi Women&#x27;s League), which gathered 42,000 members, campaigned for gender equality (including suffrage), organized educational programs, proviced social services, established 78 literacy centers, and drafted the 1959 Personal Status Law, which was accepted and introduced by the Government. 
In the 1950s the Iraqi Women&#x27;s Union petitioned senior state figures including the prime minister and wrote articles in the press. 

A Week of Women&#x27;s Rights was launched in October 1953 by Iraqi Women&#x27;s Union suffrage, who arranged a sumposium and voiced their demand in radio programs and articles in the press to campaigned for women&#x27;s suffrage.
As a response, the Islamic clergy launched a Week of Virtue and called for a general strike against women&#x27;s suffrage and called for women to &quot;stay at home&quot; since women&#x27;s suffrage was against Islam. 
During the Week of Virtue, the Sunni Nihal al-Zahawi, daughter of Amjad al-Zahawi, head of the Muslim Sisters Society (Jamiyyat al-Aukht al-Muslima), spoke on the radio against women&#x27;s suffrage: she described the suffragists as women who revolted against the very Islam that gave them rights, and that women&#x27;s suffrage was lamentable since it broke sex segregation and resulted in gender mixing, which was an unrestricted liberty that broke the rules of against islam.

A breakthrough came in 1958. During the Arab Union of Iraq-Jordan, the Iraqi Constitution was set, in March 1958, to be amended to include women&#x27;s suffrage later that year, but the matter became moot when the monarchy was abolished in July that year.
An unnamed MP to the newspaper al-Hawadith that he could never run against a female candidate, since if he lost he would have lost to a woman, which would have been disonorable, and if he won, he would only have won over a woman; he claimed many male MPs felt the same, and that voters would also feel dishonored by being represented and ruled by a woman. 
The MP Tawfq al-Mukhtar commented to a reporter: &quot;Friends, women&#x27;s rights bother me a lot, and anybody who condemns or criticizes them gives me great pleasure&quot;; he added that he would withdraw if he was put against a female candidate, and he was one of four MPs to vote against the proposed amendment of March 1958.

In 1958 the Iraqi Monarchy was replaced by the Baathis regime. The early Baathist regime saw women&#x27;s emancipation in many aspects, with urban liberal modernist women enjoying professional and educational equality and appearing unveiled.
The Baathist Party supported women&#x27;s rights by principle, though it initially focused in expanding women&#x27;s educational and professional rights rather than their political rights.
Article 19 of the Iraqi Provisional Constitution of 1970 granted all Iraqi citizens equal before the law regardless of sex, blood, language, social origin or religion, and the state women&#x27;s umbrella organization General Foundation of Iraqi Women (GFIW) of 1972 guaranteed women&#x27;s full equal rights in the professional and educational sphere, prevented all discrimination and recognized women&#x27;s political participation in principle.
However, while women&#x27;s rights progressed in other aspects, the political rights was delayed. The regime was unstable and saw four regime changes in the 1960s.

In 1980 full suffrage was granted and women were given the right to vote and be elected to political office.
The suffrage reform was granted when the new Iraq National Assembly was formed before the 1980s Elections, and 16 of 250 seats where filled by women.

==== Israel ====
Women have had full suffrage since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.

In 1920, the Union of Hebrew Women for Equal Rights in Erez Israel launched a campaign that women&#x27;s suffrage and equal rights for women should be included in the Jewish Authority of the British Palestina Mandate; in 1926, the Jewish Authority granted women&#x27;s suffrage to the Jewish Authority, and declared that women would be given equal right to vote in the future Jewish State, a promise that was fullfilled upon the foundation of Israel in 1947, followed by equal rights being included in the Constitution of 1951.

The first (and only) woman to be elected Prime Minister of Israel was Golda Meir in 1969.

==== Japan ====

Although women were allowed to vote in some prefectures in 1880, women&#x27;s suffrage was enacted at a national level in 1945 with the end of the world war.

The campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage started in 1923, when the women&#x27;s umbrella organization Tokyo Rengo Fujinkai was founded and created several sub groups to address different women&#x27;s issues, one of whom, Fusen Kakutoku Domei (FKD), was to work for the introduction of women&#x27;s suffrage and political rights. The campaign was gradually reduced due to difficulties in the 1930s fascist era; the FKD was banned after the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese war, and women&#x27;s suffrage could not be introduced until it was incorporated in the new constitution after the war.

====Jordan====

The Arab Women&#x27;s Federation under Emily Bisharat worked for the introduction of women&#x27;s suffrage in Jordan in the 1950s.

Suffrage were given to educated women in 1955, but the Federation continued to campaign for universal suffrage for women, collecting the thumb prints as signatures from illiterate women in support for women&#x27;s suffrage. 
Universal women&#x27;s suffrage was finally granted in 1974. However, since no elections was held in Jordan until 1989, women&#x27;s suffrage was not enforced until that year.

==== Korea ====
South Korean people, including South Korean women, were universally granted the vote in 1948.

==== Kuwait ====

When voting was first introduced in Kuwait in 1985, Kuwaiti women had the right to vote. The right was later removed. In May 2005, the Kuwaiti parliament re-granted female suffrage.

==== Lebanon ====
The women&#x27;s movement organized in Lebanon with the creation of the Syrian-Lebanese Women&#x27;s Union in 1924; it split into the Women&#x27;s Union under Ibtihaj Qaddoura and the Lebanese Women Solidarity Association under Laure Thabet in 1946. The women&#x27;s movement united again when the two biggest women&#x27;s organizations, the Lebanese Women&#x27;s Union and the Christian Women&#x27;s Solidarity Association created the Lebanese Council of Women in 1952 to campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage, a task that finally succeeded, after an intense campaign.

==== Oman ====
After the 1970 Omani coup d&#x27;état, women&#x27;s position in society was being reassessed in connection to the national modernization program, and many reforms in women&#x27;s rights was introduced alongside the establishment of the state feminist Omani Women&#x27;s Association.

The modernization in women&#x27;s rights in Oman was followed by municipial suffrage in Muscat in 1994 (with the first two women elected to the local Shura the same year), municipial suffrage in all Oman in 1996, and national suffrage in 2002.

==== Pakistan ====
The provinces that now constitute Pakistan were a part of northwest British India until 1947, when the partition of India occurred. Women received full suffrage in 1947. Muslim women leaders from all classes actively supported the Pakistan movement in the mid-1940s. Their movement was led by wives and other relatives of leading politicians. Women were sometimes organized into large-scale public demonstrations.
In November 1988, Benazir Bhutto became the first Muslim woman to be elected as prime minister of a Muslim country.

==== Philippines ====
The Philippines was one of the first countries in Asia to grant women the right to vote. 
The women&#x27;s movement organized in the early 20th-century in organizations such as the Asociacion Feminista Filipina (1904) the Society for the Advancement of Women (SAW) and the Asociaction Feminist Ilonga, who campaigned for women&#x27;s suffrage and other rights for gender equality. 
Suffrage for Filipinas was achieved following an all-female, special plebiscite held on April 30, 1937. 447,725 – some ninety percent – voted in favour of women&#x27;s suffrage against 44,307 who voted no. In compliance with the 1935 Constitution, the National Assembly passed a law which extended the right of suffrage to women, which remains to this day.

====Qatar ====

Qatar formally introduced women&#x27;s suffrage in 1997.

==== Saudi Arabia ====
In late September 2011, King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz al-Saud declared that women would be able to vote and run for office starting in 2015. That applies to the municipal councils, which are the kingdom&#x27;s only semi-elected bodies. Half of the seats on municipal councils are elective, and the councils have few powers. The council elections have been held since 2005 (the first time they were held before that was the 1960s). Saudi women did first vote and first run for office in December 2015, for those councils. Salma bint Hizab al-Oteibi became the first elected female politician in Saudi Arabia in December 2015, when she won a seat on the council in Madrakah in Mecca province. In all, the December 2015 election in Saudi Arabia resulted in twenty women being elected to municipal councils.

The king declared in 2011 that women would be eligible to be appointed to the Shura Council, an unelected body that issues advisory opinions on national policy. This is great news,&quot; said Saudi writer and women&#x27;s rights activist Wajeha al-Huwaider. &quot;Women&#x27;s voices will finally be heard. Now it is time to remove other barriers like not allowing women to drive cars and not being able to function, to live a normal life without male guardians. Robert Lacey, author of two books about the kingdom, said, &quot;This is the first positive, progressive speech out of the government since the Arab Spring... First the warnings, then the payments, now the beginnings of solid reform.&quot; The king made the announcement in a five-minute speech to the Shura Council. In January 2013, King Abdullah issued two royal decrees, granting women thirty seats on the council, and stating that women must always hold at least a fifth of the seats on the council. According to the decrees, the female council members must be &quot;committed to Islamic Shariah disciplines without any violations&quot; and be &quot;restrained by the religious veil&quot;. The decrees also said that the female council members would be entering the council building from special gates, sit in seats reserved for women and pray in special worshipping places. Earlier, officials said that a screen would separate genders and an internal communications network would allow men and women to communicate. Women first joined the council in 2013, holding a total of thirty seats. There are two Saudi royal women among these thirty female members of the assembly, Sara bint Faisal Al Saud and Moudi bint Khalid Al Saud. Furthermore, in 2013 three women were named as deputy chairpersons of three committees: Thurayya Obeid was named deputy chairwoman of the human rights and petitions committee, Zainab Abu Talib, deputy chairwoman of the information and cultural committee, and Lubna Al Ansari, deputy chairwoman of the health affairs and environment committee.

====Syria====

Women&#x27;s suffrage was introduced in Syria in 1953. 

While the women&#x27;s suffrage reform was supported by the women&#x27;s magazine &quot;Nur al-Faya&quot; of Nazik al-Abid and &quot;al-Arus&quot; of Mary Ajami, there was no organized suffrage movement in Syria, and the majority was convinced that women preserved their virtue by staying away from politics.

In 1920, the feminist Mary Ajami presented a petition to the Syrian Congress of 1920 during the Faisal-Government, but the subject was postphoned and forgotten after the fall of the Faisal regime. 
When the petition of women&#x27;s suffrage was discussed in the Syrian Congress in 1920, Shaykh Abd al-Qadir al-Kaylani stated that to given women the right to vote would be the same thing as abolish sex segregation and allow women to appear unveiled.

In the 1930s and 1940s, the Arab Women&#x27;s Union of Damascus presented a women&#x27;s suffrage petition to President Hashim al-Atassi and to President Shukri al-Quwatli, as well as directly to the Parliament.
When the influential feminist Adila Bayhum gave her support to Husni al-Za&#x27;im, he promised her to introduce women&#x27;s suffrage when he came to power in 1949, and the reform was finally introduced in 1953. 

==== Sri Lanka ====

In 1931, Sri Lanka (at that time Ceylon) became one of the first Asian countries to allow voting rights to women over the age of 21 without any restrictions. Since then, women have enjoyed a significant presence in the Sri Lankan political arena.

The women&#x27;s movement organized on Sri Lanka under the Ceylon Women&#x27;s Union in 1904, and from 1925, the Mallika Kulangana Samitiya and then the Women&#x27;s Franchise Union (WFU) campaigned successfully for the introduction of women&#x27;s suffrage, which was achieved in 1931.

The zenith of this favourable condition to women has been the 1960 July General Elections, in which Ceylon elected the world&#x27;s first female prime minister, Sirimavo Bandaranaike. She became the world&#x27;s first democratically elected female head of government. Her daughter, Chandrika Kumaratunga also became the Prime Minister later in 1994, and the same year she was elected as the Executive president of Sri Lanka, making her the fourth woman in the world to be elected president, and the first female executive president.

==== Thailand ====
The Ministry of Interior&#x27;s Local Administrative Act of May 1897 (Phraraachabanyat 1897 [BE 2440]) granted municipal suffrage in the election of village leader to all villagers “whose house or houseboat was located in that village,” and explicitly included women voters who met the qualifications. 
This was a part of the far-reaching administrative reforms enacted by King Chulalongkorn (r. 1868–1919), in his efforts to protect Thai sovereignty.

In the new constitution introduced after the Siamese revolution of 1932, which transformed Siam from an absolute monarchy to a parliamentary constitutional monarchy, women were granted the right to vote and run for office. This reform was enacted without any prior activism in favor of women&#x27;s suffrage and was followed by a number of reforms in women&#x27;s rights, and it has been suggested that the reform was part of an effort by Pridi Bhanomyong to put Thailand on 
equal political terms with modern Western powers and establish diplomatic recognition by those as a modern nation. The new right was used for the first time in 1933, and the first female MPs were elected in 1949.

====United Arab Emirates ====

The United Arab Emirates formally introduced women&#x27;s suffrage in 2006.

==== Yemen ====

Historically Yemen was divided in two nations prior to its unification in 1990, both of whom already had women&#x27;s suffrage prior to the unification. The history of women&#x27;s suffrage is therefore split. 

Women&#x27;s suffrage was granted in South Yemen in 1967. 
The reform was a part of a number of reforms introduced in women&#x27;s rights under Socialist rule. When the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen was founded as an independent nation under the Socialist NLF Party in 1967, the General Union of Yemeni Women was founded as a part of the regime&#x27;s policy. The purpose of the GUYW was to enforce the official women&#x27;s policy of the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic regime, which was a radical and ambitions state feminism.

Women&#x27;s suffrage was granted in North Yemen in 1970. The Northern Yemen Arab Republic was a deeply conservative state with sharia law and no strong women&#x27;s movement, were no reforms in women&#x27;s rights were not prioritised during the Yemen civil war of 1962-1970. 
However, the Second Permanent Constitution of 1970 stated that &quot;all citizens are equal before the law&quot;; and while this phrase did not explicitly include women, women voters used this phrase to vote in the next election, which was held in 1983.

=== Europe ===
In Europe, the first two countries to enact women&#x27;s suffrage were Finland in 1906 and Denmark in 1913, and the last two were Switzerland and Liechtenstein. In Switzerland, women gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1971; but in the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland. In Liechtenstein, women were given the right to vote by the women&#x27;s suffrage referendum of 1984. Three prior referendums held in 1968, 1971 and 1973 had failed to secure women&#x27;s right to vote.

==== Albania ====
Albania introduced a limited and conditional form of women&#x27;s suffrage in 1920, and subsequently provided full voting rights in 1945.

==== Andorra ====

The Principality of Andorra introduced women&#x27;s suffrage in 1970 (third last in Europe), though Andorra did not have a democratic constitution until 1993.

In 1969, 3708 signatures demanding women&#x27;s suffrage and eligibility was presented to the Andorra Council Parliament. In April 1970, women&#x27;s suffrage was introduced after a vote with 10 votes for and eight against, while however eligibility was voted down. Women&#x27;s eligibility was introduced on 5 September 1973. The first woman became MP in 1984.

==== Austria ====

After the breakdown of the Habsburg monarchy in 1918, Austria granted the general, equal, direct and secret right to vote to all citizens, regardless of sex, through the change of the electoral code in December 1918. The first elections in which women participated were the February 1919 Constituent Assembly elections.

==== Azerbaijan ====
Universal voting rights were recognized in Azerbaijan in 1918 by the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. Thus, making Azerbaijan the first Muslim-majority country to enfranchise women. This early commitment to women&#x27;s rights was part of a broader movement towards secularization and modernization in the country.

==== Belgium ====

A revision of the constitution in October 1921 (it changed art. 47 of the Constitution of Belgium of 1831) introduced the general right to vote according to the &quot;one man, one vote&quot; principle. Art. 47 allowed widows of World War I to vote at the national level as well. The introduction of women&#x27;s suffrage was already put onto the agenda at the time, by means of including an article in the constitution that allowed approval of women&#x27;s suffrage by special law (meaning it needed a 2/3 majority to pass). Belgian socialists opposed the women&#x27;s suffrage, fearing their conservative leanings and their &quot;domination&quot; by the clergy. This happened on March 27, 1948. In Belgium, voting is compulsory.

==== Bulgaria ====
Bulgaria left Ottoman rule in 1878. Although the first adopted constitution, the Tarnovo Constitution (1879), gave women equal election rights, in fact women were disenfranchised, not allowed to vote and to be elected. The Bulgarian Women&#x27;s Union was an umbrella organization of the 27 local women&#x27;s organisations that had been established in Bulgaria since 1878. It was founded as a reply to the limitations of women&#x27;s education and access to university studies in the 1890s, with the goal to further women&#x27;s intellectual development and participation, arranged national congresses and used &quot;Zhenski glas&quot; as its organ. However, they had limited success, and women were allowed to vote and to be elected only after when Communist rule was established.

==== Croatia ====

==== Czech Republic ====
In the former Bohemia, taxpaying women and women in &quot;learned profession[s]&quot; were allowed to vote by proxy and made eligible to the legislative body in 1864. The first Czech female MP was elected to the Diet of Bohemia in 1912. The Declaration of Independence of the Czechoslovak Nation from October 18, 1918, declared that &quot;our democracy shall rest on universal suffrage. Women shall be placed on equal footing with men, politically, socially, and culturally,&quot; and women were appointed to the Revolutionary National Assembly (parliament) on November 13, 1918. On June 15, 1919, women voted in local elections for the first time. Women were guaranteed equal voting rights by the constitution of the Czechoslovak Republic in February 1920 and were able to vote for the parliament for the first time in April 1920.

==== Cyprus ====

Cyprus had no organized women&#x27;s movement until the mid-20th century and no activism in favor of women&#x27;s suffrage, which was introduced in the new constitution of 1961 after the liberation from Britain, simply because women&#x27;s suffrage had at that point came to be regarded as a given thing in international democratic standard.

==== Denmark ====
In Denmark, the Danish Women&#x27;s Society (DK) debated, and informally supported, women&#x27;s suffrage from 1884, but it did not support it publicly until in 1887, when it supported the suggestion of the parliamentarian Fredrik Bajer to grant women municipal suffrage. In 1886, in response to the perceived overcautious attitude of DK in the question of women suffrage, Matilde Bajer founded the &quot;Kvindelig Fremskridtsforening&quot; (or KF, 1886–1904) to deal exclusively with the right to suffrage, both in municipal and national elections, and it 1887, the Danish women publicly demanded the right for women&#x27;s suffrage for the first time through the KF. However, as the KF was very much involved with worker&#x27;s rights and pacifist activity, the question of women&#x27;s suffrage was in fact not given full attention, which led to the establishment of the strictly women&#x27;s suffrage movement &quot;Kvindevalgretsforeningen&quot; (1889–1897). In 1890, the KF and the Kvindevalgretsforeningen united with five women&#x27;s trade worker&#x27;s unions to found the &quot;De samlede Kvindeforeninger&quot;, and through this form, an active women&#x27;s suffrage campaign was arranged through agitation and demonstration. However, after having been met by compact resistance, the Danish suffrage movement almost discontinued with the dissolution of the De samlede Kvindeforeninger in 1893.

In 1898, an umbrella organization, the &quot;Danske Kvindeforeningers Valgretsforbund&quot; or DKV was founded and became a part of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWSA). In 1907, the Landsforbundet for Kvinders Valgret (LKV) was founded by Elna Munch, Johanne Rambusch and Marie Hjelmer in reply to what they considered to be the much too careful attitude of the Danish Women&#x27;s Society. The LKV originated from a local suffrage association in Copenhagen, and like its rival DKV, it successfully organized other such local associations nationally.

Women won the right to vote in municipal elections on April 20, 1908. However it was not until June 5, 1915 that they were allowed to vote in Rigsdag elections.

==== Estonia ====
Estonia gained its independence in 1918 with the Estonian War of Independence. However, the first official elections were held in 1917. These were the elections of temporary council (i.e. Maapäev), which ruled Estonia from 1917 to 1919. Since then, women have had the right to vote.

The parliament elections were held in 1920. After the elections, two women got into the parliament – history teacher Emma Asson and journalist Alma Ostra-Oinas. Estonian parliament is called Riigikogu and during the First Republic of Estonia it used to have 100 seats.

==== Finland ====
The area that in 1809 became Finland had been a group of integral provinces of the Kingdom of Sweden for over 600 years. Thus, women in Finland were allowed to vote during the Swedish Age of Liberty (1718–1772), during which conditional suffrage was granted to tax-paying female members of guilds. However, this right was controversial. In Vaasa, there was opposition against women participating in the town hall discussing political issues, as this was not seen as their right place, and women&#x27;s suffrage appears to have been opposed in practice in some parts of the realm: when Anna Elisabeth Baer and two other women petitioned to vote in Turku in 1771, they were not allowed to do so by town officials.

The predecessor state of modern Finland, the Grand Duchy of Finland, was part of the Russian Empire from 1809 to 1917 and enjoyed a high degree of autonomy. In 1863, taxpaying women were granted municipal suffrage in the countryside, and in 1872, the same reform was implemented in the cities. 
The issue of women&#x27;s suffrage was first raised by the women&#x27;s movement when it organized in the Finnish Women&#x27;s Association (1884), and the first organization exclusively devoted to the issue of suffrage was Naisasialiitto Unioni (1892).

In 1906, Finland became the first province in the world to implement racially-equal women&#x27;s suffrage, unlike Australia in 1902. Finland also elected the world&#x27;s first female members of parliament the following year. In 1907, the first general election in Finland that had been open to women took place. Nineteen women were elected which was less than 10% of the total members of parliament. The successful women included Lucina Hagman, Miina Sillanpää, Anni Huotari, Hilja Pärssinen, Hedvig Gebhard, Ida Aalle, Mimmi Kanervo, Eveliina Ala-Kulju, Hilda Käkikoski, Liisi Kivioja, Sandra Lehtinen, Dagmar Neovius, Maria Raunio, Alexandra Gripenberg, Iida Vemmelpuu, Maria Laine, Jenny Nuotio and Hilma Räsänen. Many had expected more. A few women realised that the women of Finland needed to seize this opportunity and organisation and education would be required. Newly elected MPs Lucina Hagman and Maikki Friberg together with Olga Oinola, Aldyth Hultin, Mathilda von Troil, Ellinor Ingman-Ivalo, Sofia Streng and Olga Österberg founded the Finnish Women&#x27;s Association&#x27;s first branch in Helsinki. Miina Sillanpää became Finland&#x27;s first female government minister in 1926.

==== France ====
The April 21, 1944 ordinance of the French Committee of National Liberation, confirmed in October 1944 by the French provisional government, extended the suffrage to French women. The first elections with female participation were the municipal elections of April 29, 1945 and the parliamentary elections of 21 October 1945. &quot;Indigenous Muslim&quot; women in French Algeria also known as Colonial Algeria, had to wait until a July 3, 1958, decree. Although several countries had started extending suffrage to women from the end of the 19th century, France was one of the last countries to do so in Europe. In fact, the Napoleonic Code declares the legal and political incapacity of women, which blocked attempts to give women political rights. First feminist claims started emerging during the French Revolution in 1789. Condorcet expressed his support for women&#x27;s right to vote in an article published in Journal de la Société de 1789, but his project failed. On 17 January 1913, Marie Denizard was the first woman to stand as a candidate in a French presidential election but the state refused to acknowledge her. After World War I, French women continued demanding political rights, and despite the Chamber of Deputies being in favor, the Senate continuously refused to analyze the law proposal. Socialists, and more generally, the political left repeatedly opposed the right to vote for women because they feared their more conservative preferences and their &quot;domination&quot; by priests. It was only after World War II that women were granted political rights.

==== Georgia ====
Upon its declaration of independence on May 26, 1918, in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, the Democratic Republic of Georgia extended suffrage to its female citizens. The women of Georgia first exercised their right to vote in the 1919 legislative election.

==== Germany ====
Women were granted the right to vote and be elected from November 12, 1918. The Weimar Constitution established a &quot;new&quot; Germany after the end of World War I and extended the right to vote to all citizens above the age of 20, with some exceptions.

==== Greece ====
Greece had universal suffrage since its independence in 1832, but this suffrage excluded women. The first proposal to give Greek women the right to vote was made on May 19, 1922, by a member of parliament, supported by then Prime Minister Dimitrios Gounaris, during a constitutional convention. The proposal garnered a narrow majority of those present when it was first proposed, but failed to get the broad 80% support needed to add it to the constitution. In 1925 consultations began again, and a law was passed allowing women the right to vote in local elections, provided they were 30 years of age and had attended at least primary education. The law remained unenforced, until feminist movements within the civil service lobbied the government to enforce it in December 1927 and March 1929. Women were allowed to vote on a local level for the first time in the Thessaloniki local elections, on December 14, 1930, where 240 women exercised their right to do so. Women&#x27;s turnout remained low, at only around 15,000 in the national local elections of 1934, despite women being a narrow majority of the population of 6.8 million. Women could not stand for election, despite a proposal made by Interior minister Ioannis Rallis, which was contested in the courts; the courts ruled that the law only gave women &quot;a limited franchise&quot; and struck down any lists where women were listed as candidates for local councils. Misogyny was rampant in that era; Emmanuel Rhoides is quoted as having said that &quot;two professions are fit for women: housewife and prostitute&quot;. Another misogynistic &quot;argument&quot; employed against women&#x27;s right to vote was that &quot;during menstruation women are loony and in a frantic psychological state, and since they may be menstruating at the time of the elections, they can&#x27;t vote&quot;.

On a national level women over 18 voted for the first time in April 1944 for the National Council, a legislative body set up by the National Liberation Front resistance movement. Ultimately, women won the legal right to vote and run for office on May 28, 1952. Eleni Skoura, again from Thessaloniki, became the first woman elected to the Hellenic Parliament in 1953, with the conservative Greek Rally, when she won a by-election against another female opponent. Women were finally able to participate in the 1956 election, with two more women becoming members of parliament; Lina Tsaldari, wife of former Prime Minister Panagis Tsaldaris, won the most votes of any candidate in the country and became the first female minister in Greece under the conservative National Radical Union government of Konstantinos Karamanlis.

No woman has been elected Prime Minister of Greece, but Vassiliki Thanou-Christophilou served as the country&#x27;s first female prime minister, heading a caretaker government, between August 27 and September 21, 2015. The first woman to lead a major political party was Aleka Papariga, who served as General Secretary of the Communist Party of Greece from 1991 to 2013.

==== Hungary ====
In Hungary, although it was already planned in 1818, the first occasion when women could vote was the elections held in January 1920.

==== Iceland ====
Iceland was under Danish rule until 1944. Icelandic women acquired full voting rights along with Danish women in 1915.

==== Ireland ====
From 1918, with the rest of the United Kingdom, women in Ireland could vote at age 30 with property qualifications or in university constituencies, while men could vote at age 21 with no qualification. From separation in 1922, the Irish Free State gave equal voting rights to men and women. [&quot;All citizens of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) without distinction of sex, who have reached the age of twenty-one years and who comply with the provisions of the prevailing electoral laws, shall have the right to vote for members of Dáil Eireann, and to take part in the Referendum and Initiative.&quot;] Promises of equal rights from the Proclamation were embraced in the Constitution in 1922, the year Irish women achieved full voting rights. However, over the next ten years, laws were introduced that eliminated women&#x27;s rights from serving on juries, working after marriage, and working in industry. The 1937 Constitution and Taoiseach Éamon de Valera’s conservative leadership further stripped women of their previously granted rights. As well, though the 1937 Constitution guarantees women the right to vote and to nationality and citizenship on an equal basis with men, it also contains a provision, Article 41.2, which states:

==== Isle of Man ====
In 1881, The Isle of Man (in the British Isles but not part of the United Kingdom) passed a law giving the vote to single and widowed women who passed a property qualification. This was to vote in elections for the House of Keys, in the Island&#x27;s parliament, Tynwald. This was extended to universal suffrage for men and women in 1919.

==== Italy ====
In Italy, women&#x27;s suffrage was not introduced following World War I, but upheld by Socialist and Fascist activists and partly introduced on a local or municipal level by Benito Mussolini&#x27;s government in 1925. In April 1945, the provisional government led by the Italian Resistance decreed the universal enfranchisement of women in Italy, allowing for the immediate appointment of women to public office, of which the first was Elena Fischli Dreher. In the 1946 election, all Italians simultaneously voted for the Constituent Assembly and for a referendum about keeping Italy a monarchy or creating a republic instead. Elections were not held in the Julian March and South Tyrol because they were under Allied occupation.

The new version of article 51 Constitution recognizes equal opportunities in electoral lists.

==== Liechtenstein ====
: &quot;See also Women&#x27;s suffrage in Liechtenstein&quot;
In Liechtenstein, women&#x27;s suffrage was granted via referendum in 1984.

==== Luxembourg ====
In Luxembourg, Marguerite Thomas-Clement spoke in favour of women suffrage in public debate through articles in the press in 1917–19; however, there was never any organized women suffrage movement in Luxembourg, as women suffrage was included without debate in the new democratic constitution of 1919.

==== Malta ====

Malta was a British colony, but when women&#x27;s suffrage was finally introduced in Great Britain in 1918, this had not been included in the 1921 Constitution on Malta, when Malta was given its own parliament, although the Labour Party did support the reform. 
In 1931, Mabel Strickland, assistant secretary of Constitution Party, delivered a petition signed by 428 to the Royal Commission on Maltese Affairs requesting women&#x27;s suffrage without success.

However, there had been no organized movement for women&#x27;s suffrage on Malta. In 1944 the Women of Malta Association was founded by Josephine Burns de Bono and Helen Buhagiar. The purpose was to work for the inclusion of women&#x27;s suffrage in the new Malta constitution, which was to be introduced in 1947 and which was at that time prepared in parliament. The Women of Malta Association was officially registered as a labor union, in order to give its representatives the right to speak in parliament. 
The Catholic church as well as the Nationalist Party opposed women&#x27;s suffrage with the argument that suffrage would be an unnecessary burden for women who had family and household to occupy them. The Labour Party as well as the labour movement in general supported the reform. An argument was that women paid taxes and should therefore also vote to decide what to do with them. Women&#x27;s suffrage was approved with the votes 145 to 137. 
However, this did not include women&#x27;s right to be elected to political office, and the Women of Malta Association therefore continued the campaign to include also this right. The debate continued with the same supporters and opponents, and the same arguments for and against, until this right was approved as well.

Women&#x27;s suffrage and right to be elected to political office were included in the MacMichael Constitution, which was finally introduced on September 5, 1947. A politician at the time commented that the reform had been possible only because of women&#x27;s participation in the war effort during the World War II.

==== Monaco ====

Monaco introduced women&#x27;s suffrage in 1962, as the fourth last in Europe. In Monaco, Women&#x27;s suffrage was not introduced after a long campaign – although supported by the Union of Monegasque Women, itself only founded in 1958 – but was introduced as a part of the new Constitution, alongside Parliamentarism, an independent court system and a number of other legal and political reforms.

==== Netherlands ====
Women were granted the right to vote in the Netherlands on August 9, 1919. In 1917, a constitutional reform already allowed women to be electable. However, even though women&#x27;s right to vote was approved in 1919, this only took effect from January 1, 1920.

The women&#x27;s suffrage movement in the Netherlands was led by three women: Aletta Jacobs, Wilhelmina Drucker and Annette Versluys-Poelman. In 1889, Wilhelmina Drucker founded a women&#x27;s movement called Vrije Vrouwen Vereeniging (Free Women&#x27;s Union) and it was from this movement that the campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage in the Netherlands emerged. This movement got a lot of support from other countries, especially from the women&#x27;s suffrage movement in England. In 1906 the movement wrote an open letter to the Queen pleading for women&#x27;s suffrage. When this letter was rejected, in spite of popular support, the movement organised several demonstrations and protests in favor of women&#x27;s suffrage. This movement was of great significance for women&#x27;s suffrage in the Netherlands.

==== Norway ====
Liberal politician Gina Krog was the leading campaigner for women&#x27;s suffrage in Norway from the 1880s. She founded the Norwegian Association for Women&#x27;s Rights and the National Association for Women&#x27;s Suffrage to promote this cause. Members of these organisations were politically well-connected and well organised and in a few years gradually succeeded in obtaining equal rights for women. Middle-class women won the right to vote in municipal elections in 1901 and parliamentary elections in 1907. Universal suffrage for women in municipal elections was introduced in 1910, and in 1913 a motion on universal suffrage for women was adopted unanimously by the Norwegian parliament (Stortinget). Norway thus became the first independent country to introduce women&#x27;s suffrage.

==== Poland ====
Regaining independence in 1918 following the 123-year period of partition and foreign rule, Poland immediately granted women the right to vote and be elected as of November 28, 1918.

The first women elected to the Sejm in 1919 were: Gabriela Balicka, Jadwiga Dziubińska, Irena Kosmowska, Maria Moczydłowska, Zofia Moraczewska, Anna Piasecka, Zofia Sokolnicka, and Franciszka Wilczkowiakowa.

==== Portugal ====
Carolina Beatriz Ângelo was the first Portuguese woman to vote, in the Constituent National Assembly election of 1911, taking advantage of a loophole in the country&#x27;s electoral law.

In 1931, during the Estado Novo regime, women were allowed to vote for the first time, but only if they had a high school or university degree, while men had only to be able to read and write. In 1946 a new electoral law enlarged the possibility of female vote, but still with some differences regarding men. A law from 1968 claimed to establish &quot;equality of political rights for men and women&quot;, but a few electoral rights were reserved for men. After the Carnation Revolution, women were granted full and equal electoral rights in 1976.

==== Romania ====
The timeline of granting women&#x27;s suffrage in Romania was gradual and complex, due to the turbulent historical period when it happened. The concept of universal suffrage for all &quot;men&quot; was introduced in 1918, and reinforced by the 1923 Constitution of Romania. Although this constitution opened the way for the possibility of women&#x27;s suffrage too (Article 6), this did not materialize: the Electoral Law of 1926 did not grant women the right to vote, maintaining all male suffrage. Starting in 1929, women who met certain qualifications were allowed to vote in local elections. After the Constitution from 1938 (elaborated under Carol II of Romania who sought to implement an authoritarian regime) the voting rights were extended to women for national elections by the Electoral Law 1939, but both women and men had restrictions, and in practice these restrictions affected women more than men (the new restrictions on men also meant that men lost their previous universal suffrage). Although women could vote, they could be elected only to the Senate and not to the Chamber of Deputies (Article 4 (c)). (the Senate was later abolished in 1940). Due to the historical context of the time, which included the dictatorship of Ion Antonescu, there were no elections in Romania between 1940 and 1946. In 1946, Law no. 560 gave full equal rights to men and women to vote and to be elected in the Chamber of Deputies; and women voted in the 1946 Romanian general election. The Constitution of 1948 gave women and men equal civil and political rights (Article 18). Until the collapse of communism in 1989, all the candidates were chosen by the Romanian Communist Party, and civil rights were merely symbolic under this authoritarian regime.

==== Russia ====
Despite initial apprehension against enfranchising women for the right to vote for the upcoming Constituent Assembly election, the League for Women&#x27;s Equality and other suffragists rallied throughout the year of 1917 for the right to vote. After much pressure (including a 40,000-strong march on the Tauride Palace), on July 20, 1917, the Provisional Government enfranchised women with the right to vote.

==== San Marino ====
San Marino introduced women&#x27;s suffrage in 1959, following the 1957 constitutional crisis known as Fatti di Rovereta. It was however only in 1973 that women obtained the right to stand for election.

==== Spain ====
During the Miguel Primo de Rivera regime (1923–1930) only women who were considered heads of household were allowed to vote in local elections, but there were none at that time. Women&#x27;s suffrage was officially adopted in 1931 despite the opposition of Margarita Nelken and Victoria Kent, two female MPs (both members of the Republican Radical-Socialist Party), who argued that women in Spain at that moment lacked social and political education enough to vote responsibly because they would be unduly influenced by Catholic priests. Most Spanish Republicans at the time held the same view. The other female MP at the time, Clara Campoamor of the liberal Radical Party, was a strong advocate of women&#x27;s suffrage and she was the one leading the Parliament&#x27;s affirmative vote. During the Franco regime in the &quot;organic democracy&quot; type of elections called &quot;referendums&quot; (Franco&#x27;s regime was dictatorial) women over 21 were allowed to vote without distinction. From 1976, during the Spanish transition to democracy women fully exercised the right to vote and be elected to office.

==== Sweden ====
During the Age of Liberty (1718–1772), Sweden had conditional women&#x27;s suffrage. Until the reform of 1865, the local elections consisted of mayoral elections in the cities, and elections of parish vicars in the countryside parishes. The &quot;Sockenstämma&quot; was the local parish council who handled local affairs, in which the parish vicar presided and the local peasantry assembled and voted, an informally regulated process in which women are reported to have participated already in the 17th century. The national elections consisted of the election of the representations to the Riksdag of the Estates.

Suffrage was gender neutral and therefore applied to women as well as men if they filled the qualifications of a voting citizen. These qualifications were changed during the course of the 18th-century, as well as the local interpretation of the credentials, affecting the number of qualified voters: the qualifications also differed between cities and countryside, as well as local or national elections.

Initially, the right to vote in local city elections (mayoral elections) was granted to every &quot;burgher&quot;, which was defined as a taxpaying citizen with a guild membership. Women as well as men were members of guilds, which resulted in women&#x27;s suffrage for a limited number of women.
In 1734, suffrage in both national and local elections, in cities as well as countryside, was granted to every property owning taxpaying citizen of legal majority. This extended suffrage to all taxpaying property owning women whether guild members or not, but excluded married women and the majority of unmarried women, as married women were defined as legal minors, and unmarried women were minors unless they applied for legal majority by royal dispensation, while widowed and divorced women were of legal majority. The 1734 reform increased the participation of women in elections from 55 to 71 percent.

Between 1726 and 1742, women voted in 17 of 31 examined mayoral elections. Reportedly, some women voters in mayoral elections preferred to appoint a male to vote for them by proxy in the city hall because they found it embarrassing to do so in person, which was cited as a reason to abolish women&#x27;s suffrage by its opponents. The custom to appoint to vote by proxy was however used also by males, and it was in fact common for men, who were absent or ill during elections, to appoint their wives to vote for them. In Vaasa in Finland (then a Swedish province), there was opposition against women participating in the town hall discussing political issues as this was not seen as their right place, and women&#x27;s suffrage appears to have been opposed in practice in some parts of the realm: when Anna Elisabeth Baer and two other women petitioned to vote in Åbo in 1771, they were not allowed to do so by town officials.

In 1758, women were excluded from mayoral elections by a new regulation by which they could no longer be defined as burghers, but women&#x27;s suffrage was kept in the national elections as well as the countryside parish elections. Women participated in all of the eleven national elections held up until 1757. In 1772, women&#x27;s suffrage in national elections was abolished by demand from the burgher estate. Women&#x27;s suffrage was first abolished for taxpaying unmarried women of legal majority, and then for widows.
However, the local interpretation of the prohibition of women&#x27;s suffrage varied, and some cities continued to allow women to vote: in Kalmar, Växjö, Västervik, Simrishamn, Ystad, Åmål, Karlstad, Bergslagen, Dalarna and Norrland, women were allowed to continue to vote despite the 1772 ban, while in Lund, Uppsala, Skara, Åbo, Gothenburg and Marstrand, women were strictly barred from the vote after 1772.

While women&#x27;s suffrage was banned in the mayoral elections in 1758 and in the national elections in 1772, no such bar was ever introduced in the local elections in the countryside, where women therefore continued to vote in the local parish elections of vicars. In a series of reforms in 1813–1817, unmarried women of legal majority, &quot;Unmarried maiden, who has been declared of legal majority&quot;, were given the right to vote in the &quot;sockestämma&quot; (local parish council, the predecessor of the communal and city councils), and the &quot;kyrkoråd&quot; (local church councils).

In 1823, a suggestion was raised by the mayor of Strängnäs to reintroduce women&#x27;s suffrage for taxpaying women of legal majority (unmarried, divorced and widowed women) in the mayoral elections, and this right was reintroduced in 1858.

In 1862, tax-paying women of legal majority (unmarried, divorced and widowed women) were again allowed to vote in municipal elections, making Sweden the first country in the world to grant women the right to vote. This was after the introduction of a new political system, where a new local authority was introduced: the communal municipal council. The right to vote in municipal elections applied only to people of legal majority, which excluded married women, as they were juridically under the guardianship of their husbands. In 1884 the suggestion to grant women the right to vote in national elections was initially voted down in Parliament. During the 1880s, the Married Woman&#x27;s Property Rights Association had a campaign to encourage the female voters, qualified to vote in accordance with the 1862 law, to use their vote and increase the participation of women voters in the elections, but there was yet no public demand for women&#x27;s suffrage among women. In 1888, the temperance activist Emilie Rathou became the first woman in Sweden to demand the right for women&#x27;s suffrage in a public speech. In 1899, a delegation from the Fredrika Bremer Association presented a suggestion of women&#x27;s suffrage to prime minister Erik Gustaf Boström. The delegation was headed by Agda Montelius, accompanied by Gertrud Adelborg, who had written the demand. This was the first time the Swedish women&#x27;s movement themselves had officially presented a demand for suffrage.

In 1902 the Swedish Society for Woman Suffrage was founded, supported by the Social Democratic women&#x27;s Clubs. In 1906 the suggestion of women&#x27;s suffrage was voted down in parliament again. In 1909, the right to vote in municipal elections were extended to also include married women. The same year, women were granted eligibility for election to municipal councils, and in the following 1910–11 municipal elections, forty women were elected to different municipal councils, Gertrud Månsson being the first. In 1914 Emilia Broomé became the first woman in the legislative assembly.

The right to vote in national elections was not returned to women until 1919, and was practiced again in the election of 1921, for the first time in 150 years.

After the 1921 election, the first women were elected to Swedish Parliament after women&#x27;s suffrage were Kerstin Hesselgren in the Upper chamber and Nelly Thüring (Social Democrat), Agda Östlund (Social Democrat) Elisabeth Tamm (liberal) and Bertha Wellin (Conservative) in the Lower chamber. Karin Kock-Lindberg became the first female government minister, and in 1958, Ulla Lindström became the first acting prime minister.

==== Switzerland ====

A referendum on women&#x27;s suffrage was held on February 1, 1959. The majority of Switzerland&#x27;s men (67%) voted against it, but in some French-speaking cantons women obtained the vote. The first Swiss woman to hold political office, Trudy Späth-Schweizer, was elected to the municipal government of Riehen in 1958.

Switzerland was the last Western republic to grant women&#x27;s suffrage; they gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1971 after a second referendum that year. In 1991 following a decision by the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland, Appenzell Innerrhoden became the last Swiss canton to grant women the vote on local issues.

The first female member of the seven-member Swiss Federal Council, Elisabeth Kopp, served from 1984 to 1989. Ruth Dreifuss, the second female member, served from 1993 to 1999, and was the first female President of the Swiss Confederation for the year 1999. From September 22, 2010, until December 31, 2011, the highest political executive of the Swiss Confederation had a majority of female councillors (4 of 7); for the three years 2010, 2011, and 2012 Switzerland was presided by female presidency for three years in a row. In 2015, 2017, 2020 and 2024, the country was presided by a woman.

==== Turkey ====

In Turkey, Atatürk, the founding president of the republic, led a secularist cultural and legal transformation supporting women&#x27;s rights including voting and being elected. Women won the right to vote in municipal elections on March 20, 1930. Women&#x27;s suffrage was achieved for parliamentary elections on December 5, 1934, through a constitutional amendment. Turkish women, who participated in parliamentary elections for the first time on February 8, 1935, obtained 18 seats.

In the early republic, when Atatürk ran a one-party state, his party picked all candidates. A small percentage of seats were set aside for women, so naturally those female candidates won. When multi-party elections began in the 1940s, the share of women in the legislature fell, and the 4% share of parliamentary seats gained in 1935 was not reached again until 1999. In the parliament of 2011, women hold about 9% of the seats. Nevertheless, Turkish women gained the right to vote a decade or more before women in such Western European countries as France, Italy, and Belgium – a mark of Atatürk&#x27;s far-reaching social changes.

Tansu Çiller served as the 22nd prime minister of Turkey and the first female prime minister of Turkey from 1993 to 1996. She was elected to the parliament in 1991 general elections and she became prime minister on June 25, 1993, when her cabinet was approved by the parliament.

==== United Kingdom ====

The campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland gained momentum throughout the early part of the 19th century, as women became increasingly politically active, particularly during the campaigns to reform suffrage in the United Kingdom. John Stuart Mill, elected to Parliament in 1865 and an open advocate of female suffrage (about to publish &quot;The Subjection of Women&quot;), campaigned for an amendment to the Reform Act 1832 to include female suffrage. Roundly defeated in an all-male parliament under a Conservative government, the issue of women&#x27;s suffrage came to the fore.

Until the 1832 Reform Act specified &quot;male persons&quot;, a few women had been able to vote in parliamentary elections through property ownership, although this was rare. In local government elections, women lost the right to vote under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. Unmarried women ratepayers received the right to vote in the Municipal Franchise Act 1869. This right was confirmed in the Local Government Act 1894 and extended to include some married women. By 1900, more than 1 million women were registered to vote in local government elections in England.

In 1881, the Isle of Man (in the British Isles but not part of the United Kingdom) passed a law giving the vote to single and widowed women who passed a property qualification. This was to vote in elections for the House of Keys, in the Island&#x27;s parliament, Tynwald. This was extended to universal suffrage for men and women in 1919.

During the later half of the 19th century, a number of campaign groups for women&#x27;s suffrage in national elections were formed in an attempt to lobby members of parliament and gain support. In 1897, seventeen of these groups came together to form the National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), who held public meetings, wrote letters to politicians and published various texts. In 1907 the NUWSS organized its first large procession. This march became known as the Mud March as over 3,000 women trudged through the streets of London from Hyde Park to Exeter Hall to advocate women&#x27;s suffrage.

In 1903 a number of members of the NUWSS broke away and, led by Emmeline Pankhurst, formed the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU). As the national media lost interest in the suffrage campaign, the WSPU decided it would use other methods to create publicity. This began in 1905 at a meeting in Manchester&#x27;s Free Trade Hall where Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon, a member of the newly elected Liberal government, was speaking. As he was talking, Christabel Pankhurst and Annie Kenney of the WSPU constantly shouted out: &quot;Will the Liberal Government give votes to women?&quot; When they refused to cease calling out, police were called to evict them and the two suffragettes (as members of the WSPU became known after this incident) were involved in a struggle that ended with them being arrested and charged for assault. When they refused to pay their fine, they were sent to prison for one week, and three days. The British public were shocked and took notice at this use of violence to win the vote for women.

After this media success, the WSPU&#x27;s tactics became increasingly violent. This included an attempt in 1908 to storm the House of Commons, the arson of David Lloyd George&#x27;s country home (despite his support for women&#x27;s suffrage). In 1909 Lady Constance Lytton was imprisoned, but immediately released when her identity was discovered, so in 1910 she disguised herself as a working class seamstress called Jane Warton and endured inhumane treatment which included force-feeding. In 1913, suffragette Emily Davison protested by interfering with a horse owned by King George V during the running of The Derby; she was struck by the horse and died four days later. The WSPU ceased their militant activities during World War I and agreed to assist with the war effort.

The National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies, which had always employed &quot;constitutional&quot; methods, continued to lobby during the war years, and compromises were worked out between the NUWSS and the coalition government. The Speaker&#x27;s Conference on electoral reform (1917) represented all the parties in both houses, and came to the conclusion that women&#x27;s suffrage was essential. Regarding fears that women would suddenly move from zero to a majority of the electorate due to the heavy loss of men during the war, the Conference recommended that the age restriction be 21 for men, and 30 for women.

On February 6, 1918, the Representation of the People Act 1918 was passed, enfranchising women over the age of 30 who met minimum property qualifications. About 8.4 million women gained the vote in Great Britain and Ireland. In November 1918, the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918 was passed, allowing women to be elected into Parliament. The Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928 extended the franchise in Great Britain and Northern Ireland to all women over the age of 21, granting women the vote on the same terms as men.

In 1999, &quot;Time&quot; magazine, in naming Emmeline Pankhurst as one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century, states: &quot;...she shaped an idea of women for our time; she shook society into a new pattern from which there could be no going back&quot;.

=== Oceania ===
==== Australia, Pitcairn and Norfolk Islands ====

The female descendants of the &quot;Bounty&quot; mutineers who lived on Pitcairn Islands could vote from 1838, and this right transferred with their resettlement to Norfolk Island (now an Australian external territory) in 1856. 
Propertied women in the colony of South Australia were granted the vote in local elections (but not parliamentary elections) in 1861. Henrietta Dugdale formed the first Australian women&#x27;s suffrage society in Melbourne in 1884. The Womanhood Suffrage League of New South Wales was founded in Sydney in 1891. Women became eligible to vote for the Parliament of South Australia in 1895, as were Aboriginal men and women. In 1897, Catherine Helen Spence became the first female political candidate for political office, unsuccessfully standing for election as a delegate to Federal Convention on Australian Federation. Western Australia granted voting rights to women in 1899.

The first election for the Parliament of the newly formed Commonwealth of Australia in 1901 was based on the electoral provisions of the six pre-existing colonies, so that women who had the vote and the right to stand for Parliament at state level had the same rights for the 1901 Australian Federal election. In 1902, the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Commonwealth Franchise Act, which enabled all non-indigenous women to vote and stand for election to the Federal Parliament. The following year Nellie Martel, Mary Moore-Bentley, Vida Goldstein, and Selina Siggins stood for election. The Act specifically excluded &#x27;natives&#x27; from Commonwealth franchise unless already enrolled in a state, the situation in South Australia. In 1949, the right to vote in federal elections was extended to all indigenous people who had served in the armed forces, or were enrolled to vote in state elections (Queensland, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory still excluded indigenous women from voting rights). Remaining restrictions were abolished in 1962 by the Commonwealth Electoral Act.

Edith Cowan was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly in 1921, the first woman elected to any Australian Parliament. Dame Enid Lyons, in the Australian House of Representatives and Senator Dorothy Tangney became the first women in the Federal Parliament in 1943. Lyons went on to be the first woman to hold a Cabinet post in the 1949 ministry of Robert Menzies. Rosemary Follett was elected Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory in 1989, becoming the first woman elected to lead a state or territory. By 2010, the people of Australia&#x27;s oldest city, Sydney had female leaders occupying every major political office above them, with Clover Moore as Lord Mayor, Kristina Keneally as Premier of New South Wales, Marie Bashir as Governor of New South Wales, Julia Gillard as prime minister, Quentin Bryce as Governor-General of Australia and Elizabeth II as Queen of Australia.

==== Cook Islands ====

Women in Rarotonga won the right to vote in 1893, shortly after New Zealand.

==== New Zealand ====

New Zealand&#x27;s Electoral Act of September 19, 1893 made the self-governing British colony the first country in the world to grant women the right to vote in parliamentary elections.

Although the Liberal government which passed the bill generally advocated social and political reform, the electoral bill was only passed because of a combination of personality issues and political accident. The bill granted the vote to women of all races. New Zealand women were denied the right to stand for parliament, however, until 1920. In 2005 almost a third of the Members of Parliament elected were female. Women recently have also occupied powerful and symbolic offices such as those of Prime Minister (Jenny Shipley, Helen Clark and Jacinda Ardern), Governor-General (Catherine Tizard, Patsy Reddy, Cindy Kiro and Silvia Cartwright), Chief Justice (Sian Elias and Helen Winkelmann), Speaker of the House of Representatives (Margaret Wilson), and from March 3, 2005, to August 23, 2006, all four of these posts were held by women, along with Queen Elizabeth as Head of State.

=== The Americas ===
Women in Central and South America, and in Mexico, lagged behind those in Canada and the United States in gaining the vote. Ecuador enfranchised women in 1929 and the last was Paraguay in 1961. By date of full suffrage:

* 1929: Ecuador
* 1932: Uruguay
* 1934: Brazil, Cuba
* 1939: El Salvador
* 1941: Panama
* 1946: Guatemala, Venezuela
* 1947: Argentina
* 1948: Suriname
* 1949: Chile, Costa Rica
* 1950: Haiti
* 1952: Bolivia
* 1953: Mexico
* 1954: Belize, Colombia
* 1955: Honduras, Nicaragua, Peru,
* 1961: Paraguay
There were political, religious, and cultural debates about women&#x27;s suffrage in the various countries. Important advocates for women&#x27;s suffrage include Hermila Galindo (Mexico), Eva Perón (Argentina), Alicia Moreau de Justo (Argentina), Julieta Lanteri (Argentina), Celina Guimarães Viana (Brazil), Ivone Guimarães (Brazil), Henrietta Müller (Chile), Marta Vergara (Chile), Lucila Rubio de Laverde (Colombia), María Currea Manrique (Colombia), Josefa Toledo de Aguerri (Nicaragua), Elida Campodónico (Panama), Clara González (Panama), Gumercinda Páez (Panama), Paulina Luisi Janicki (Uruguay), Carmen Clemente Travieso, (Venezuela).

==== Argentina ====
The modern suffragist movement in Argentina arose partly in conjunction with the activities of the Socialist Party and anarchists of the early twentieth century. Women involved in larger movements for social justice began to agitate equal rights and opportunities on par with men; following the example of their European peers, Elvira Dellepiane Rawson, Cecilia Grierson and Alicia Moreau de Justo began to form a number of groups in defense of the civil rights of women between 1900 and 1910. The first major victories for extending the civil rights of women occurred in the Province of San Juan. Women had been allowed to vote in that province since 1862, but only in municipal elections. A similar right was extended in the province of Santa Fe where a constitution that ensured women&#x27;s suffrage was enacted at the municipal level, although female participation in votes initially remained low. In 1927, San Juan sanctioned its Constitution and broadly recognized the equal rights of men and women. However, the 1930 coup overthrew these advances.

A great pioneer of women&#x27;s suffrage was Julieta Lanteri, the daughter of Italian immigrants, who in 1910 requested a national court to grant her the right to citizenship (at the time not generally given to single female immigrants) as well as suffrage. The Claros judge upheld her request and declared: &quot;As a judge, I have a duty to declare that her right to citizenship is enshrined in the Constitution, and therefore that women enjoy the same political rights as the laws grant to male citizens, with the only restrictions expressly determined such laws, because no inhabitant is deprived of what they do not prohibit.&quot;

In July 1911, Dr. Lanteri were enumerated, and on November 26 of that year exercised her right to vote, the first Ibero-American woman to vote. Also covered in a judgment in 1919 was presented as a candidate for national deputy for the Independent Centre Party, obtaining 1,730 votes out of 154,302.

In 1919, Rogelio Araya UCR Argentina had gone down in history for being the first to submit a bill recognizing the right to vote for women, an essential component of universal suffrage. On July 17, 1919, he served as deputy national on behalf of the people of Santa Fe.

On February 27, 1946, three days after the elections that consecrated president Juan Perón and his wife First Lady Eva Perón 26 years of age gave his first political speech in an organized women to thank them for their support of Perón&#x27;s candidacy. On that occasion, Eva demanded equal rights for men and women and particularly, women&#x27;s suffrage:

The bill was presented the new constitutional government assumed immediately after the May 1, 1946. The opposition of conservative bias was evident, not only the opposition parties but even within parties who supported Peronism. Eva Perón constantly pressured the parliament for approval, even causing protests from the latter for this intrusion.

Although it was a brief text in three articles, that practically could not give rise to discussions, the Senate recently gave preliminary approval to the project August 21, 1946, and had to wait over a year for the House of Representative to publish the September 9, 1947, Law 13,010, establishing equal political rights between men and women and universal suffrage in Argentina. Finally, Law 13,010 was approved unanimously.

In an official statement on national television, Eva Perón announced the extension of suffrage to Argentina&#x27;s women:

On September 23, 1947, they enacted the Female Enrollment Act (No. 13,010) during the first presidency of Juan Domingo Perón, which was implemented in the elections of November 11, 1951, in which 3,816,654 women voted (63.9% voted for the Justicialist Party and 30.8% for the Radical Civic Union). Later in 1952, the first 23 senators and deputies took their seats, representing the Justicialist Party.

==== The Bahamas ====

In 1951, a women&#x27;s committee, the Women&#x27;s Suffrage Movement (WSM), was formed under the leadership of Mary Ingraham who collected over 500 signatures in favor of women&#x27;s suffrage and turned in a petition to the Parliament of the Bahamas.
In 1958, the National Women&#x27;s Council was founded by Doris Sands Johnson with Erma Grant Smith as president; the organization was given the support of the Progressive Liberal Party (PLP), and when the United Bahamian Party (UBP) finally gave its support after long resistance, women&#x27;s suffrage could finally be passed in parliament in 1960.

==== Belize ====

In Belize, The Nationalist Movement (Belize) formed a women&#x27;s group, the Women&#x27;s League under Elfreda Trapp, who campaigned for women&#x27;s suffrage among the demands the worker&#x27;s and independence movement&#x27;s put upon the British authorities, and presented a petition of women&#x27;s suffrage to governor Alan Burns in 1935.
Women&#x27;s suffrage was finally introduced in the reform bill of 1954, when full male suffrage was also introduced.

==== Bermuda ====

In 1918, Gladys Morrell held a public speech in favor of women&#x27;s suffrage, and in 1923 the women&#x27;s movement organized in the Bermuda Woman&#x27;s Suffrage Society chaired by Rose Gosling to campaigned for women&#x27;s suffrage. 
Women&#x27;s suffrage was finally introduced in 1944.

==== Bolivia ====

In Bolivia, the first women&#x27;s organization in the country, the Atene Femenino, was active for the introduction of women&#x27;s suffrage from the 1920s.

Municipal women&#x27;s suffrage and granted in 1947, and full suffrage in 1952.

==== Brazil ====
In Brazil, the issue was lifted foremost by the organization Federação Brasileira pelo Progresso Feminino from 1922. The struggle for women&#x27;s suffrage was part of a larger movement to gain rights for women. Most of the suffragists consisted of a minority of women from the educated elite, which made the activism appear less threatening to the political male elite.

The law of Rio Grande do Norte State allowed women to vote in 1926.

Women were granted the right to vote and be elected in Electoral Code of 1932, followed by Brazilian Constitution of 1934.

==== Canada ====

Women&#x27;s political status without the vote was promoted by the National Council of Women of Canada from 1894 to 1918. It promoted a vision of &quot;transcendent citizenship&quot; for women. The ballot was not needed, for citizenship was to be exercised through personal influence and moral suasion, through the election of men with strong moral character, and through raising public-spirited sons. The National Council position was integrated into its nation-building program that sought to uphold Canada as a white settler nation. While the women&#x27;s suffrage movement was important for extending the political rights of white women, it was also authorized through race-based arguments that linked white women&#x27;s enfranchisement to the need to protect the nation from &quot;racial degeneration.&quot;

Women had local votes in some provinces, as in Ontario from 1850, where women owning property (freeholders and householders) could vote for school trustees. By 1900 other provinces had adopted similar provisions, and in 1916 Manitoba took the lead in extending women&#x27;s suffrage. Simultaneously suffragists gave strong support to the Prohibition movement, especially in Ontario and the Western provinces.

The Wartime Elections Act of 1917 gave the vote to British women who were war widows or had sons, husbands, fathers, or brothers serving overseas. Unionist Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden pledged himself during the 1917 campaign to equal suffrage for women. After his landslide victory, he introduced a bill in 1918 for extending the franchise to women. On May 24, 1918, women considered citizens (not Aboriginal women, or most women of colour) became eligible to vote who were &quot;age 21 or older, not alien-born and meet property requirements in provinces where they exist&quot;.

Most women of Quebec gained full suffrage in 1940. Aboriginal women across Canada were not given federal voting rights until 1960.

The first woman elected to Parliament was Agnes Macphail in Ontario in 1921.

==== Chile ====

Debate about women&#x27;s suffrage in Chile began in the 1920s. Women&#x27;s suffrage in municipal elections was first established in 1931 by decree (decreto con fuerza de ley); voting age for women was set at 25 years. In addition, the Chamber of Deputies approved a law on March 9, 1933, establishing women&#x27;s suffrage in municipal elections.

Women obtained the legal right to vote in parliamentary and presidential elections in 1949. Women&#x27;s share among voters increased steadily after 1949, reaching the same levels of participation as men in 1970.

==== Colombia ====

Women organized in the Liberal &quot;Union Femenina de Colombia&quot; (UFC) in 1944 and the Socialist &quot;Aliazna Femenina&quot; in 1945 to demand women&#x27;s suffrage. The Liberal and Socialist party supported the reform; the conservatives initially did not, but changed its attitude when the Catholic church supported it after the Pope&#x27;s statement that women were loyal conservatives and thus supporters against Communism.
The vote was finally introduced in 1954.

==== Costa Rica ====

The campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage in begun in the 1910s, and the campaigns were active during all electoral reforms in 1913, 1913, 1925, 1927 and 1946, notably by the Feminist League (1923), which was a part of the International League of Iberian and Hispanic-American Women, who had a continuing campaign between 1925 and 1945.

Women obtained the legal right to vote in parliamentary and presidential elections in 1949.

==== Cuba ====

The campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage begun in the 1920s, when Cuban elite feminists started to organize in associations such as Club Femenino de Cuba and Partido Democrata Sufragista and collaborate and campaign for women&#x27;s issues; they arranged congresses in 1923, 1925 and 1939, and managed to achieve a reformed property rights law (1917) a no-fault divorce law (1918), and finally women&#x27;s suffrage in 1934.

Women obtained the legal right to vote in parliamentary and presidential elections in 1934.

==== Dominican Republic ====

The women&#x27;s movement in the Dominican Republic organized in 1931 in the Acción Feminista Dominicana (AFD), who allied with Rafael Trujillo in order to reach their goal of women&#x27;s suffrage. Trujillo finally fulfilled his promise to the AFD for its support after eleven years, when he introduced women&#x27;s suffrage on the Dominican Republic in 1942.

==== Ecuador ====
Women obtained the legal right to vote in parliamentary and presidential elections in 1929. This was the first time in South America.

==== El Salvador ====

Between June 1921 and January 1922, when El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica formed a (second) Federation of Central America, the Constitution of this state included women&#x27;s suffrage on 9 September 1921, but the reform could never be implemented because the Federation (and thereby its constitution) did not last.

The campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage begun in the 1920s, notably by the leading figure Prudencia Ayala.

Women obtained the legal right to vote in parliamentary and presidential elections in 1939. However, the qualifications were extreme and excluded 80 percent of women so the suffrage movement continued its campaign in the 1940s, notably by Matilde Elena López and Ana Rosa Ochoa, until the restrictions was lifted in 1950.

==== Guatemala ====

Between June 1921 and January 1922, when El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica formed a (second) Federation of Central America, the Constitution of this state included women&#x27;s suffrage on 9 September 1921, but the reform could never be implemented because the Federation (and thereby its constitution) did not last.

The campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage in begun in the 1920s, notably by the organisations Gabriela Mistral Society (1925) and Graciela Quan&#x27;s Guatemalan Feminine Pro-Citizenship Union (1945).

Women obtained the legal right to vote in parliamentary and presidential elections in 1945 (without restrictions in 1965).

==== Guyana ====

In Guyana, the Women’s Political and Economic Organization (WPEO) was founded by Janet Jagan, Winifred Gaskin and Frances Van Stafford in 1946 to campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage, and the campaign was given support by the People&#x27;s Progressive Party (PPP) and its women&#x27;s group Women’s Progressive Organization (WPO), until full women&#x27;s suffrage was introduced in connection to the new reformed constitution in 1953.

==== Haiti ====

The campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage in Haiti begun after the foundation of &quot;Ligue Feminine d’Action Sociale&quot; (LFAS) in 1934.

Women obtained the legal right to vote in parliamentary and presidential elections on 4 November 1950.

==== Honduras ====

Between June 1921 and January 1922, when El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica formed a (second) Federation of Central America, the Constitution of this state included women&#x27;s suffrage on 9 September 1921, but the reform could never be implemented because the Federation (and thereby its constitution) did not last.

The campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage begun in the 1920s, notably by the leading figure Visitación Padilla, who was the leader of the biggest women&#x27;s organisation (Sociedad Cultural Femenina).

Women obtained the legal right to vote in parliamentary and presidential elections in 1955.

==== Jamaica ====

After women&#x27;s suffrage had been introduced in Britain in 1918, white elite women organized in the Women&#x27;s Social Service Club (also known as the Women&#x27;s Social Service Association or WSSA) campaigned under the leadership of Nellie Latrielle and Judith DeCordova for the introduction of the reform on Jamaica from May 1918, and succeeded when limited suffrage for taxpaying women of property was introduced in May 1919.
The women&#x27;s suffrage – as was male suffrage at the time – was, however, limited to a minority of women, and during the 1930s, women campaigned for universal women&#x27;s suffrage via the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) the Jamaica Women&#x27;s League (JWL) and the Women&#x27;s Liberal Club (1936), until full suffrage was finally introduced in 1944.

==== Mexico ====
Women gained the right to vote in 1947 for some local elections and for national elections in 1953, coming after a struggle dating to the 19th century.

==== Nicaragua ====

A women&#x27;s movement was organized in Nicaragua in the 1920s. Their demand for women&#x27;s suffrage was supported by the Nationalist Liberal Party, who allied themselves with the women&#x27;s movement in order to get their support during their regime.

The Nationalist Liberal Party promised to introduce the reform of women&#x27;s suffrage, and in 1939, the leader of the Nicaraguan women&#x27;s movement Josefa Toledo (leader of the Nicaragua branch of the International League of Iberian and Latin American Women) demanded that the regime fulfil their promise to the women&#x27;s movement.

The promise was finally fulfilled in 1950, and the reform introduced in 1955. After this, the Nicaraguan women&#x27;s associations were incorporated in the women&#x27;s wing of the Nationalist Liberal Party, the Ala Femenina Liberal, under the leadership of Olga Nunez de Saballos (who became the first woman MP), and gave the Party its official support in the following elections.

==== Panama ====

The campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage begun after the foundation of Federation of Women&#x27;s Club of the Canal in 1903, which became a part of the General Federation of Clubs in New York City, which made the suffrage movement in Panama heavily influenced by the suffrage movement in the United States. In 1922 The Feminist Group Renovation (FGR) was founded by Clara González, which became the first Feminist Political women&#x27;s party in Latin America when it was transformed to the Feminist National Party in 1923.

Women obtained the legal right to vote in communal elections in 1941, and in parliamentary and presidential elections 1946.

==== Paraguay ====
Paraguay was the last country in the Americas to grant women&#x27;s suffrage. Liga Paraguaya de los Derechos de la Mujer campaigned for women&#x27;s suffrage during the 1950s. Women&#x27;s suffrage was gained in Paraguay in 1961, primarily because the strongarm president, Alfredo Stroessner, lacking the approval of his male constituents, sought to bolster his support through women voters.

====Peru====

Women&#x27;s suffrage in Peru was first introduced on communal level in 1932, and on national level on 7 September 1955. Peru was the second to last country in South America to introduce women&#x27;s suffrage.

==== United States ====

Long before the Nineteenth Amendment was passed in 1920, some individual U.S. states granted women suffrage in certain kinds of elections. Some allowed women to vote in school elections, municipal elections, or for members of the Electoral College. Some territories, like Washington, Utah, and Wyoming, allowed women to vote before they became states. While many consider suffrage to include both voting rights and officeholding rights, many women were able to hold office prior to receiving voting rights. In fact, suffragists in the United States employed the strategy of petitioning for and utilizing officeholding rights first to make a stronger argument in favor of giving women the right to vote.

The New Jersey constitution of 1776 enfranchised all adult inhabitants who owned a specified amount of property. Laws enacted in 1790 and 1797 referred to voters as &quot;he or she&quot;, and women regularly voted. A law passed in 1807, however, excluded women from voting in that state by moving towards universal manhood suffrage.

Lydia Taft was an early forerunner in Colonial America who was allowed to vote in three New England town meetings, beginning in 1756, at Uxbridge, Massachusetts. The women&#x27;s suffrage movement was closely tied to abolitionism, with many suffrage activists gaining their first experience as anti-slavery or anti-cannibalism activists.
In June 1848, Gerrit Smith made women&#x27;s suffrage a plank in the Liberty Party platform. In July, at the Seneca Falls Convention in upstate New York, activists including Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony began a seventy-year struggle by women to secure the right to vote. Attendees signed a document known as the Declaration of Rights and Sentiments, of which Stanton was the primary author. Equal rights became the rallying cry of the early movement for women&#x27;s rights, and equal rights meant claiming access to all the prevailing definitions of freedom. In 1850 Lucy Stone organized a larger assembly with a wider focus, the National Women&#x27;s Rights Convention in Worcester, Massachusetts. Susan B. Anthony, a resident of Rochester, New York, joined the cause in 1852 after reading Stone&#x27;s 1850 speech. Stanton, Stone and Anthony were the three leading figures of this movement in the U.S. during the 19th century: the &quot;triumvirate&quot; of the drive to gain voting rights for women. Women&#x27;s suffrage activists pointed out that black people had been granted the franchise and had not been included in the language of the United States Constitution&#x27;s Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments (which gave people equal protection under the law and the right to vote regardless of their race, respectively). This, they contended, had been unjust. Early victories were won in the territories of Wyoming (1869) and Utah (1870).

John Allen Campbell, the first Governor of the Wyoming Territory, approved the first law in United States history explicitly granting women the right to vote entitled &quot;An Act to Grant to the Women of Wyoming Territory the Right of Suffrage, and to Hold Office.” The law was approved on December 10, 1869. This day was later commemorated as Wyoming Day. On February 12, 1870, the Secretary of the Territory and Acting Governor of the Territory of Utah, S. A. Mann, approved a law allowing twenty-one-year-old women to vote in any election in Utah. Utah women were disenfranchised by provisions of the federal Edmunds–Tucker Act enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1887.

The push to grant Utah women&#x27;s suffrage was at least partially fueled by the belief that, given the right to vote, Utah women would dispose of polygamy. In actuality, it was the men of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that ultimately fought for women&#x27;s enfranchisement to dispel myths that polygamy was akin to modern-day slavery. It was only after Utah women exercised their suffrage rights in favor of polygamy that the male-dominated U.S. Congress unilaterally disenfranchised Utah women.

By the end of the 19th century, Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming had enfranchised women after effort by the suffrage associations at the state level; Colorado notably enfranchised women by an 1893 referendum. California voted to enfranchise women in 1911.

During the beginning of the 20th century, as women&#x27;s suffrage faced several important federal votes, a portion of the suffrage movement known as the National Woman&#x27;s Party led by suffragist Alice Paul became the first &quot;cause&quot; to picket outside the White House. Paul had been mentored by Emeline Pankhurst while in England, and both she and Lucy Burns led a series of protests against the Wilson Administration in Washington.

Wilson ignored the protests for six months, but on June 20, 1917, as a Russian delegation drove up to the White House, suffragists unfurled a banner which stated: &quot;We women of America tell you that America is not a democracy. Twenty million women are denied the right to vote. President Wilson is the chief opponent of their national enfranchisement&quot;. Another banner on August 14, 1917, referred to &quot;Kaiser Wilson&quot; and compared the plight of the German people with that of American women. With this manner of protest, the women were subject to arrests and many were jailed. Another ongoing tactic of the National Woman&#x27;s Party was watchfires, which involved burning copies of President Wilson&#x27;s speeches, often outside the White House or in the nearby Lafayette Park. The Party continued to hold watchfires even as the war began, drawing criticism from the public and even other suffrage groups for being unpatriotic. On October 17, Alice Paul was sentenced to seven months and on October 30 began a hunger strike, but after a few days prison authorities began to force feed her. After years of opposition, Wilson changed his position in 1918 to advocate women&#x27;s suffrage as a war measure.

The key vote came on June 4, 1919, when the Senate approved the amendment by 56 to 25 after four hours of debate, during which Democratic Senators opposed to the amendment filibustered to prevent a roll call until their absent Senators could be protected by pairs. The Ayes included 36 (82%) Republicans and 20 (54%) Democrats. The Nays were from 8 (18%) Republicans and 17 (46%) Democrats. The Nineteenth Amendment, which prohibited state or federal sex-based restrictions on voting, was ratified by sufficient states in 1920. According to the article, &quot;Nineteenth Amendment&quot;, by Leslie Goldstein from the Encyclopedia of the Supreme Court of the United States, &quot;by the end it also included jail sentences, and hunger strikes in jail accompanied by brutal force feedings; mob violence; and legislative votes so close that partisans were carried in on stretchers&quot; (Goldstein, 2008). Even after the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified, women were still facing problems. For instance, when women had registered to vote in Maryland, &quot;residents sued to have the women&#x27;s names removed from the registry on the grounds that the amendment itself was unconstitutional&quot; (Goldstein, 2008).

Before 1965, women of color, such as African Americans and Native Americans, were disenfranchised, especially in the South. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibited racial discrimination in voting, and secured voting rights for racial minorities throughout the U.S.

==== Puerto Rico ====

On Puerto Rico, the organized struggle for women&#x27;s suffrage on the American dependency of Puerto Rico begun when the United States introduced suffrage for males only via the Jones Act in 1917, and the Liga Femínea Puertorriqueña (from 1920 known as Liga Social Sufragista) was founded by Ana Roque de Duprey to campaign for voting rights to be extended also to women.
When women&#x27;s suffrage was introduced in the US in 1920, the suffragists on Puerto Rico stated that this reform should apply to Puerto Rico as well, and sued under the leadership of Milagros Benet de Mewton for this purpose. Women&#x27;s suffrage was extended to Puerto Rico in 1929, but only for literate women; full women&#x27;s suffrage was introduced by the US on Puerto Rico first in 1932.
==== Uruguay ====

Women&#x27;s suffrage was announced as a principle in the Constitution of Uruguay of 1917, and declared as law in a decree of 1932. The first national election in which women voted was the 1938 Uruguayan general election.

==== Venezuela ====

After the 1928 Student Protests, women started participating more actively in politics. In 1935, women&#x27;s rights supporters founded the Feminine Cultural Group (known as &#x27;ACF&#x27; from its initials in Spanish), with the goal of tackling women&#x27;s problems. The group supported women&#x27;s political and social rights, and believed it was necessary to involve and inform women about these issues to ensure their personal development. It went on to give seminars, as well as founding night schools and the House of Laboring Women.

Groups looking to reform the 1936 Civil Code of Conduct in conjunction with the Venezuelan representation to the Union of American Women called the First Feminine Venezuelan Congress in 1940. In this congress, delegates discussed the situation of women in Venezuela and their demands. Key goals were women&#x27;s suffrage and a reform to the Civil Code of Conduct. Around twelve thousand signatures were collected and handed to the Venezuelan Congress, which reformed the Civil Code of Conduct in 1942.

In 1944, groups supporting women&#x27;s suffrage, the most important being Feminine Action, organized around the country. During 1945, women attained the right to vote at a municipal level. This was followed by a stronger call of action. Feminine Action began editing a newspaper called the Correo Cívico Femenino, to connect, inform and orientate Venezuelan women in their struggle. Finally, after the 1945 Venezuelan coup d&#x27;état and the call for a new Constitution, to which women were elected, women&#x27;s suffrage became a constitutional right in the country.

=== In non-religious organizations ===
The right of women to vote has sometimes been denied in non-religious organizations; for example, it was not until 1964 that women in the National Association of the Deaf in the United States were first allowed to vote.

== In religion ==
=== Christianity ===

The Pope is elected by cardinals. Women are not appointed as cardinals, and therefore, women cannot vote for the Pope.

The female Catholic office of Abbess is elective, the choice being made by the secret votes of nuns belonging to the community. The high rank ascribed to abbesses within the Catholic Church formerly permitted some abbesses the right to sit and vote at national assemblies – as with various high-ranking abbesses in Medieval Germany, who were ranked among the independent princes of the empire. Their Protestant successors enjoyed the same privilege almost into modern times.
On 6 February 2021, Pope Francis appointed Nathalie Becquart an undersecretary of the Synod of Bishops, making her the first woman to have the right to vote in the Synod of Bishops.

On 26 April 2023, Pope Francis announced that women would be allowed to vote at the Sixteenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, marking the first time women were allowed to vote at any Synod of Bishops.

=== Islam ===

In some countries, some mosques have constitutions prohibiting women from voting in board elections.

=== Judaism ===

In Conservative Judaism, Reform Judaism, and most Orthodox Jewish movements, women have the right to vote. Since the 1970s, more and more Modern Orthodox synagogues and religious organizations have been granting women the right to vote and to be elected to their governing bodies. In a few Ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities, women are denied the vote or the ability to be elected to positions of authority.

In the United States, Jewish women were hugely participatory in the suffrage movement. American Jewish support started in the mid-1800s but grew significantly at the turn of the twentieth century due to Jewish immigration from Europe. Jewish suffragists faced antisemitism and xenophobia from anti-suffragists and suffragists alike. By the time of the Nineteenth Amendment, a majority of American Jews supported suffrage.

Ernestine Rose was a Polish American suffragist who worked closely with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. She is sometimes referred to as &quot;the first Jewish feminist&quot; though she had renounced Judaism at an early age and was an active atheist.

<doc id="175590" wikidata="Q44454" url="?curid=175590" title="Moral hazard">
<text>In economics, a moral hazard is a situation where an economic actor has an incentive to increase its exposure to risk because it does not bear the full costs associated with that risk, should things go wrong. For example, when a corporation is insured, it may take on higher risk knowing that its insurance will pay the associated costs. A moral hazard may occur where the actions of the risk-taking party change to the detriment of the cost-bearing party after a financial transaction has taken place.

Moral hazard can occur under a type of information asymmetry where the risk-taking party to a transaction knows more about its intentions than the party paying the consequences of the risk and has a tendency or incentive to take on too much risk from the perspective of the party with less information. One example is a principal–agent approach (also called agency theory), where one party, called an agent, acts on behalf of another party, called the principal. However, a principal–agent problem can occur when there is a conflict of interest between the agent and principal. If the agent has more information about his or her actions or intentions than the principal then the agent may have an incentive to act too riskily (from the viewpoint of the principal) if the interests of the agent and the principal are not aligned.

==History ==
According to research by Dembe and Boden, the term dates back to the 17th century and was widely used by English insurance companies by the late 19th century. Early usage of the term carried negative connotations, implying fraud or immoral behavior (usually on the part of an insured party). Dembe and Boden point out, however, that prominent mathematicians who studied decision-making in the 18th century used &quot;moral&quot; to mean &quot;subjective&quot;, which may cloud the true ethical significance in the term.
The concept of moral hazard was the subject of renewed study by economists in the 1960s, beginning with economist Ken Arrow, and did not imply immoral behavior or fraud. Economists use this term to describe inefficiencies that can occur when risks are displaced or cannot be fully evaluated, rather than a description of the ethics or morals of the involved parties.

Rowell and Connelly offer a detailed description of the genesis of the term moral hazard, by identifying salient changes in economic thought, which are identified within the medieval theological and probability literature. Due to the different approaches taken by economics and philosophy in interpreting the concept of “moral hazard,” there are significant differences in their understanding of its underlying causes. In economics, “moral hazard” is often attributed to the malignant development of utilitarianism. In contrast, philosophy and ethics view “moral hazard” from a broader perspective that includes the moral behaviour of individuals and society as a whole. The root cause of “moral hazard” is due to the immoral behaviour of economic agents from a social perspective. Their paper also compares and contrasts the predominantly normative conception of moral hazard found within the insurance-industry literature with the largely positive interpretations found within the economic literature. Often what is described as &quot;moral hazard[s]&quot; in the insurance literature is upon closer reading, a description of the closely related concept, adverse selection.

==Finance==
In 1998, William J. McDonough, head of the New York Federal Reserve, helped the counterparties of Long-Term Capital Management avoid losses by taking over the firm. This move was criticized by former Fed Chair Paul Volcker and others as increasing moral hazard. Tyler Cowen concludes that &quot;creditors came to believe that their loans to unsound financial institutions would be made good by the Fed – as long as the collapse of those institutions would threaten the global credit system.&quot; Fed Chair, Alan Greenspan, while conceding the risk of moral hazard, defended the policy to orderly unwind Long-Term Capital by saying the world economy is at stake. Greenspan had himself been accused of creating wider moral hazard in markets by using the Greenspan put.

Economist Paul Krugman described moral hazard as &quot;any situation in which one person makes the decision about how much risk to take, while someone else bears the cost if things go badly.&quot; Financial bailouts of lending institutions by governments, central banks or other institutions can encourage risky lending in the future if those that take the risks come to believe that they will not have to carry the full burden of potential losses. Lending institutions need to take risks by making loans, and the riskiest loans usually have the potential for making the highest return.

Taxpayers, depositors and other creditors often have to shoulder at least part of the burden of risky financial decisions made by lending institutions.

Many have argued that certain types of mortgage securitization contribute to moral hazard. Mortgage securitization enables mortgage originators to pass on the risk that the mortgages they originate might default and not hold the mortgages on their balance sheets and assume the risk. In one kind of mortgage securitization, known as &quot;agency securitizations,&quot; default risk is retained by the securitizing agency that buys the mortgages from originators. These agencies thus have an incentive to monitor originators and check loan quality. &quot;Agency securitizations&quot; refer to securitizations by either Ginnie Mae, a government agency, or by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both for-profit government-sponsored enterprises. They are similar to the &quot;covered bonds&quot; that are commonly used in Western Europe in that the securitizing agency retains default risk. Under both models, investors take on only interest-rate risk, not default risk.

In another type of securitization, known as &quot;private label&quot; securitization, default risk is generally not retained by the securitizing entity. Instead, the securitizing entity passes on default risk to investors. The securitizing entity, therefore, has relatively little incentive to monitor originators and maintain loan quality. &quot;Private label&quot; securitization refers to securitizations structured by financial institutions such as investment banks, commercial banks, and non-bank mortgage lenders.

During the years leading up to the subprime mortgage crisis, private label securitizations grew as a share of overall mortgage securitization by purchasing and securitizing low-quality, high-risk mortgages. Agency Securitizations appear to have somewhat lowered their standards, but Agency mortgages remained considerably safer than mortgages in private-label securitizations and performed far better in terms of default rates.

Economist Mark Zandi of Moody&#x27;s Analytics described moral hazard as a root cause of the subprime mortgage crisis. He wrote that &quot;the risks inherent in mortgage lending became so widely dispersed that no one was forced to worry about the quality of any single loan. As shaky mortgages were combined, diluting any problems into a larger pool, the incentive for responsibility was undermined.&quot; He also wrote, &quot;Finance companies weren&#x27;t subject to the same regulatory oversight as banks. Taxpayers weren&#x27;t on the hook if they went belly up [pre-crisis], only their shareholders and other creditors were. Finance companies thus had little to discourage them from growing as aggressively as possible, even if that meant lowering or winking at traditional lending standards.&quot;

Moral hazard can also occur with borrowers. Borrowers may not act prudently (in the view of the lender) when they invest or spend funds recklessly. For example, credit card companies often limit the amount borrowers can spend with their cards because without such limits, borrowers may spend borrowed funds recklessly, leading to default.

Securitization of mortgages in America started in 1983 at Salomon Brothers and where the risk of each mortgage passed to the next purchaser instead of remaining with the original mortgaging institution. These mortgages and other debt instruments were put into a large pool of debt, and then shares in the pool were sold to many creditors.

Thus, there is no one person responsible for verifying that any one particular loan is sound, that the assets securing that one particular loan are worth what they are supposed to be worth, that the borrower responsible for making payments on the loan can read and write the language in which the papers that he/she signed were written, or even that the paperwork exists and is in good order. It has been suggested that this may have caused the subprime mortgage crisis.

Brokers, who were not lending their own money, pushed risk onto the lenders. Lenders, who sold mortgages soon after underwriting them, pushed risk onto investors. Investment banks bought mortgages and chopped up mortgage-backed securities into slices, some riskier than others. Investors bought securities and hedged against the risk of default and prepayment, pushing those risks further along. In a purely capitalist scenario, the last one holding the risk (like a game of musical chairs) is the one who faces the potential losses. In the sub-prime crisis, however, national credit authorities (the Federal Reserve in the US) assumed the ultimate risk on behalf of the citizenry at large.

Others believe that financial bailouts of lending institutions do not encourage risky lending behavior since there is no guarantee to lending institutions that a bailout will occur. Decreased valuation of a corporation before any bailout would prevent risky, speculative business decisions by executives who fail to conduct proper due diligence in their business transactions. The risk and the burdens of loss became apparent to Lehman Brothers, which did not benefit from a bailout, and other financial institutions and mortgage companies such as Citibank and Countrywide Financial Corporation, whose valuation plunged during the subprime mortgage crisis.

=== Incentives to moral hazard in accounting rules ===
A 2017 report by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, an international regulator for the banking sector, noted that the accounting rules (IFRS # 9 and 13 in particular) leave entities significant discretion in determining financial instrument fair value and identified this discretion as a potential source of moral hazard: &quot;The evidence consistent with accounting discretion as contributing to moral hazard behavior indicates that (additional) prudential valuation requirements may be justified.&quot;

Banking regulators have taken actions to limit discretion and reduce valuation risk, i.e. the risk to banks&#x27; balance sheets arising from financial instrument valuation uncertainties. A row of regulatory documents has been issued, providing detailed prudential requirements that have many points of contact with the accounting rules and have the indirect effect of curbing the incentives for moral hazard by limiting the discretion left to banks in valuating financial instruments.

=== Connection to financial crisis of 2007−08 ===
Many scholars and journalists have argued that moral hazard played a role in the 2008 financial crisis, since numerous actors in the financial market may have had an incentive to increase their exposure to risk. In general, there are three ways in which moral hazard may have manifested itself in the lead up to the financial crisis:

* Asset managers may have had an incentive to take on more risk when managing other people&#x27;s money, particularly if they were paid as a percentage of the fund&#x27;s profits. If they took on more risk, they could expect higher payoff for themselves and were somewhat shielded from losses because they were spending other people&#x27;s money. Therefore, asset managers may have been in a situation of moral hazard, where they would take on more risk than appropriate for a given client because they did not bear the cost of failure.
* Mortgage loan originators, such as Washington Mutual, may have had an incentive to understate the risk of loans they originated because the loans were often sold to mortgage pools (see mortgage-backed securities). Because loan originators were paid on a per-mortgage basis, they had an incentive to produce as many mortgages as possible, even if they were risky. Because these institutions did not expect to hold on to the loans until maturity, they could pass on the risk to the buyer of the loans. Therefore, mortgage loan originators may have been in a situation of moral hazard, because they did not bear the costs of the risky mortgages they were underwriting.
* Third, large banks may have believed they were &quot;too big to fail.&quot; That is, because these banks were so ingrained in the US economy, the federal government would not have allowed them to fail in order to prevent a full-scale economic crash. This belief may have been shaped by the 1998 bailout of Long-Term Capital Management. &quot;Too big to fail&quot; banks may have believed they were essentially invincible to failure, thus putting them in a position of moral hazard: they could take on big risks – thus increasing their expected payoff – thinking that the federal government would bail them out in the event of a major failure. Therefore, large banks may have been in a situation of moral hazard, because they did not bear the costs of a catastrophic collapse.

Notably, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC), tasked by Congress with investigating the causes of the financial crisis, cited moral hazard as a component of the crisis, arguing that many factors, including deregulation in the derivatives market in 2000, reduced federal oversight, and the potential for government bailout of &quot;too big to fail&quot; institutions all played a role in increasing moral hazard in the years leading up to the collapse.

Others have argued that moral hazard could not have played a role in the financial crisis for three main reasons. First, in the event of a catastrophic failure, a government bailout would only come after major losses for the company. So even if a bailout was expected it would not prevent the firm from taking losses. Second, there is some evidence that big banks were not expecting the crisis and thus were not expecting government bailouts, though the FCIC tried hard to contest this idea. Third, some have argued that negative externalities from corporate governance were a more important cause, since some risky investments may have had positive expected payoff for the firm but negative expected payoff to society.

==Insurance industry==

Moral hazard has been studied by insurers and academics, such as in the work of Kenneth Arrow, Tom Baker, and John Nyman.

The name comes originally from the insurance industry. Insurance companies worried that protecting their clients from risks (like fire, or car accidents) might encourage those clients to behave in riskier ways (like smoking in bed or not wearing seatbelts). This problem may inefficiently discourage those companies from protecting their clients as much as the clients would like to be protected.

Economists argue that the inefficiency results from information asymmetry. If insurance companies could perfectly observe the actions of their clients, they could deny coverage to clients choosing risky actions (like smoking in bed or not wearing seat belts), allowing them to provide thorough protection against risk (fire or accidents) without encouraging risky behavior. However, since insurance companies cannot perfectly observe their clients&#x27; actions, they are discouraged from providing the amount of protection that would be provided in a world with perfect information.

Economists distinguish moral hazard from adverse selection, another problem that arises in the insurance industry, which is caused by &quot;hidden information&quot;, rather than &quot;hidden actions&quot;.

The same underlying problem of non-observable actions also affects other contexts besides the insurance industry. It also arises in banking and finance: if a financial institution knows it is protected by a lender of last resort, it may make riskier investments than it would in the absence of the protection.

In insurance markets, moral hazard occurs when the behavior of the insured party changes in a way that raises costs for the insurer since the insured party no longer bears the full costs of that behavior. Because individuals no longer bear the cost of medical services, they have an added incentive to ask for pricier and more elaborate medical service, which would otherwise not be necessary. In those instances, individuals have an incentive to over consume, simply because they no longer bear the full cost of medical services.

Two types of behavior can change. One type is the risky behavior itself, resulting in a &quot;before the event&quot; moral hazard. Insured parties then behave in a more risky manner, resulting in more negative consequences that the insurer must pay for. For example, after purchasing automobile insurance, some may tend to be less careful about locking the automobile or choose to drive more, thereby increasing the risk of theft or an accident for the insurer. After purchasing fire insurance, some may tend to be less careful about preventing fires (say, by smoking in bed or neglecting to replace the batteries in fire alarms). A further example has been identified in flood risk management in which it is proposed that the possession of insurance undermines efforts to encourage people to integrate flood protection and resilience measures in properties exposed to flooding.

A second type of behavior that may change is the reaction to the negative consequences of risk once they have occurred and insurance is provided to cover their costs. That may be called &quot;ex post&quot; (after the event) moral hazard. Insured parties then do not behave in a more risky manner that results in more negative consequences, but they ask an insurer to pay for more of the negative consequences from risk as insurance coverage increases. For example, without medical insurance, some may forgo medical treatment due to its costs and simply deal with substandard health. However, after medical insurance becomes available, some may ask an insurance provider to pay for the cost of medical treatment that would not have occurred otherwise.

Sometimes moral hazard is so severe that it makes insurance policies impossible. Coinsurance, co-payments, and deductibles reduce the risk of moral hazard by increasing the out-of-pocket spending of consumers, which decreases their incentive to consume. These methods work by increasing out-of-pocket expenses for consumers, thereby reducing the incentive for the insured to engage in excessive consumption. For example, by requiring individuals to pay a portion of their health care costs through coinsurance, copayment, or deductibles, insurance providers can give people an incentive to consume less health care and avoid making unnecessary claims. This can help reduce moral hazard by aligning the interests of the insured and the insurer.

== Numerical example ==

Consider a potential case of moral hazard in the health care market caused by the purchase of health insurance. Assume health care has constant marginal cost of $10 per unit and the individual&#x27;s demand is given by &quot;Q&quot; = 20 − &quot;P&quot;. Assuming a perfectly competitive market, at equilibrium, the price will be $10 per unit and the individual will consume 10 units of health care. Now, consider the same individual with health insurance. Assume this health insurance makes health care free for the individual. In this case, the individual will have a price of $0 for the health care and thus will consume 20 units. The price will still be $10, but the insurance company would be the one bearing the costs.

This example shows numerically how moral hazard could occur with health insurance. The individual consumes more health care than the equilibrium quantity because they don&#x27;t bear the cost of the additional care.

==Economic theory==
In economic theory, moral hazard is a situation in which the behavior of one party may change to the detriment of another after the transaction has taken place. For example, a person with insurance against automobile theft may be less cautious about locking their car because the negative consequences of vehicle theft are now (partially) the responsibility of the insurance company. A party makes a decision about how much risk to take, while another party bears the costs if things go badly, and the party insulated from risk behaves differently from how it would if it were fully exposed to the risk.

In microeconomics, agency theory analyses the relationship between the principal, the party who delegates decision making authority, and the agent, who executes the service. This theory is a key concept used to explore and resolve issues that have arisen within the relationship of agents and principals, which is known as the principal-agent problem. The theory is subdivided into two categories: (1) the moral hazard model and; (2) the adverse selection model. To summarise the latter, adverse selection arises when two parties hold unequal or asymmetric information. In the instance of &quot;contract theory&quot; (which encompasses agency theory), in the adverse selection model the agent holds private information before the contract is created with the principal, whereas in the moral hazard model the agent is informed of the withheld information privately after the contract is created with the principal. 

According to contract theory moral hazard results from a situation in which a hidden action occurs. Bengt Holmström said this:
Moral hazard can be divided into two types when it involves asymmetric information (or lack of verifiability) of the outcome of a random event. An &quot;ex ante&quot; moral hazard is a change in behavior prior to the outcome of the random event, whereas &quot;ex post&quot; involves behavior after the outcome. For instance, in the case of a health insurance company insuring an individual during a specific time period, the final health of the individual can be thought of as the outcome. The individual taking greater risks during the period would be ex-ante moral hazard whereas lying about a fictitious health problem to defraud the insurance company would be ex post moral hazard. A second example is the case of a bank making a loan to an entrepreneur for a risky business venture. The entrepreneur becoming overly risky would be ex ante moral hazard, but willful default (wrongly claiming the venture failed when it was profitable) is ex post moral hazard.

According to Hart and Holmström (1987), moral hazard models can be subdivided in models with hidden action and models with hidden information. In the former case, after the contract has been signed the agent chooses an action (such as an effort level) that cannot be observed by the principal. In the latter case, after the contract has been signed there is a random draw by nature that determines the agent&#x27;s type (such as his valuation for a good or his costs of effort). In the literature, two reasons have been discussed why moral hazard may imply that the first-best solution (the solution that would be attained under complete information) is not achieved.

Firstly, the agent may be risk-averse, so there is a trade-off between providing the agent with incentives and insuring the agent. Secondly, the agent may be risk-neutral but wealth-constrained and so the agent cannot make a payment to the principal and there is a trade-off between providing incentives and minimizing the agent&#x27;s limited-liability rent. Among the early contributors to the contract-theoretic literature on moral hazard were Oliver Hart and Sanford J. Grossman. In the meantime, the moral hazard model has been extended to the cases of multiple periods and multiple tasks, both with risk-averse and risk-neutral agents.

There are also models that combine hidden action and hidden information. Since there is no data on unobservable variables, it is quite difficult to be able to test directly the contract-theoretic moral hazard model, however there have been some successful indirect tests with field data. Direct tests of moral hazard theory are feasible in laboratory settings, using the tools of experimental economics. In such a setup, Hoppe and Schmitz (2018) have corroborated central insights of moral hazard theory.

==Managerial economics==
In the field of managerial economics, moral hazard refers to a situation in which an individual or entity engages in risky behaviour due to the knowledge that the costs associated with such behaviour will be borne by another party. This phenomenon often arises in the presence of information asymmetry, where one party possesses more information than the other. For instance, within an employment relationship, an employee may engage in risky behaviour with the understanding that any negative consequences will be absorbed by their employer. To mitigate the moral hazard, firms may implement various mechanisms such as performance-based incentives, monitoring and screening to align the interests of both parties and reduce the likelihood of risky behaviour.

<doc id="175596" wikidata="Q38344" url="?curid=175596" title="Animal testing">
<text>Animal testing, also known as animal experimentation, animal research, and &quot;in vivo&quot; testing, is the use of non-human animals, such as model organisms, in experiments that seek to control the variables that affect the behavior or biological system under study. This approach can be contrasted with field studies in which animals are observed in their natural environments or habitats. Experimental research with animals is usually conducted in universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, defense establishments, and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to the industry. The focus of animal testing varies on a continuum from pure research, focusing on developing fundamental knowledge of an organism, to applied research, which may focus on answering some questions of great practical importance, such as finding a cure for a disease. Examples of applied research include testing disease treatments, breeding, defense research, and toxicology, including cosmetics testing. In education, animal testing is sometimes a component of biology or psychology courses. 

Research using animal models has been central to most of the achievements of modern medicine. It has contributed to most of the basic knowledge in fields such as human physiology and biochemistry, and has played significant roles in fields such as neuroscience and infectious disease. The results have included the near-eradication of polio and the development of organ transplantation, and have benefited both humans and animals. From 1910 to 1927, Thomas Hunt Morgan&#x27;s work with the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; identified chromosomes as the vector of inheritance for genes, and Eric Kandel wrote that Morgan&#x27;s discoveries &quot;helped transform biology into an experimental science&quot;. Research in model organisms led to further medical advances, such as the production of the diphtheria antitoxin and the 1922 discovery of insulin and its use in treating diabetes, which had previously meant death. Modern general anaesthetics such as halothane were also developed through studies on model organisms, and are necessary for modern, complex surgical operations. Other 20th-century medical advances and treatments that relied on research performed in animals include organ transplant techniques, the heart-lung machine, antibiotics, and the whooping cough vaccine. 

Animal testing is widely used to aid in research of human disease when human experimentation would be unfeasible or unethical. This strategy is made possible by the common descent of all living organisms, and the conservation of metabolic and developmental pathways and genetic material over the course of evolution. Performing experiments in model organisms allows for better understanding the disease process without the added risk of harming an actual human. The species of the model organism is usually chosen so that it reacts to disease or its treatment in a way that resembles human physiology as needed. Biological activity in a model organism does not ensure an effect in humans, and care must be taken when generalizing from one organism to another. However, many drugs, treatments and cures for human diseases are developed in part with the guidance of animal models. Treatments for animal diseases have also been developed, including for rabies, anthrax, glanders, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), tuberculosis, Texas cattle fever, classical swine fever (hog cholera), heartworm, and other parasitic infections. Animal experimentation continues to be required for biomedical research, and is used with the aim of solving medical problems such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, many headaches, and other conditions in which there is no useful &quot;in vitro&quot; model system available.

The annual use of vertebrate animals—from zebrafish to non-human primates—was estimated at 192 million as of 2015. In the European Union, vertebrate species represent 93% of animals used in research, and 11.5 million animals were used there in 2011. The mouse (&quot;Mus musculus&quot;) is associated with many important biological discoveries of the 20th and 21st centuries, and by one estimate, the number of mice and rats used in the United States alone in 2001 was 80 million. In 2013, it was reported that mammals (mice and rats), fish, amphibians, and reptiles together accounted for over 85% of research animals. In 2022, a law was passed in the United States that eliminated the FDA requirement that all drugs be tested on animals.

Animal testing is regulated to varying degrees in different countries. In some cases it is strictly controlled while others have more relaxed regulations. There are ongoing debates about the ethics and necessity of animal testing. Proponents argue that it has led to significant advancements in medicine and other fields while opponents raise concerns about cruelty towards animals and question its effectiveness and reliability. There are efforts underway to find alternatives to animal testing such as computer simulation models, organs-on-chips technology that mimics human organs for lab tests, microdosing techniques which involve administering small doses of test compounds to human volunteers instead of non-human animals for safety tests or drug screenings; positron emission tomography (PET) scans which allow scanning of the human brain without harming humans; comparative epidemiological studies among human populations; simulators and computer programs for teaching purposes; among others.

==Definitions==
The terms &quot;animal testing, animal experimentation, animal research&quot;, &quot;in vivo&quot; testing, and vivisection have similar denotations but different connotations. Literally, &quot;vivisection&quot; means &quot;live sectioning&quot; of an animal, and historically referred only to experiments that involved the dissection of live animals. The term is occasionally used to refer pejoratively to any experiment using living animals; for example, the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; defines &quot;vivisection&quot; as: &quot;Operation on a living animal for experimental rather than healing purposes; more broadly, all experimentation on live animals&quot;, although dictionaries point out that the broader definition is &quot;used only by people who are opposed to such work&quot;. The word has a negative connotation, implying torture, suffering, and death. The word &quot;vivisection&quot; is preferred by those opposed to this research, whereas scientists typically use the term &quot;animal experimentation&quot;.

The following text excludes as much as possible practices related to &quot;in vivo&quot; veterinary surgery, which is left to the discussion of vivisection.

==History==

The earliest references to animal testing are found in the writings of the Greeks in the 2nd and 4th centuries BCE. Aristotle and Erasistratus were among the first to perform experiments on living animals. Galen, a 2nd-century Roman physician, performed &quot;post-mortem&quot; dissections of pigs and goats. Avenzoar, a 12th-century Arabic physician in Moorish Spain introduced an experimental method of testing surgical procedures before applying them to human patients. Discoveries in the 18th and 19th centuries included Antoine Lavoisier&#x27;s use of a guinea pig in a calorimeter to prove that respiration was a form of combustion, and Louis Pasteur&#x27;s demonstration of the germ theory of disease in the 1880s using anthrax in sheep. Robert Koch used animal testing of mice and guinea pigs to discover the bacteria that cause anthrax and tuberculosis. In the 1890s, Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to describe classical conditioning. 

Research using animal models has been central to most of the achievements of modern medicine. It has contributed most of the basic knowledge in fields such as human physiology and biochemistry, and has played significant roles in fields such as neuroscience and infectious disease. For example, the results have included the near-eradication of polio and the development of organ transplantation, and have benefited both humans and animals. From 1910 to 1927, Thomas Hunt Morgan&#x27;s work with the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; identified chromosomes as the vector of inheritance for genes. &quot;Drosophila&quot; became one of the first, and for some time the most widely used, model organisms, and Eric Kandel wrote that Morgan&#x27;s discoveries &quot;helped transform biology into an experimental science&quot;. &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; remains one of the most widely used eukaryotic model organisms. During the same time period, studies on mouse genetics in the laboratory of William Ernest Castle in collaboration with Abbie Lathrop led to generation of the DBA (&quot;dilute, brown and non-agouti&quot;) inbred mouse strain and the systematic generation of other inbred strains. The mouse has since been used extensively as a model organism and is associated with many important biological discoveries of the 20th and 21st centuries.

In the late 19th century, Emil von Behring isolated the diphtheria toxin and demonstrated its effects in guinea pigs. He went on to develop an antitoxin against diphtheria in animals and then in humans, which resulted in the modern methods of immunization and largely ended diphtheria as a threatening disease. The diphtheria antitoxin is famously commemorated in the Iditarod race, which is modeled after the delivery of antitoxin in the 1925 serum run to Nome. The success of animal studies in producing the diphtheria antitoxin has also been attributed as a cause for the decline of the early 20th-century opposition to animal research in the United States.

Subsequent research in model organisms led to further medical advances, such as Frederick Banting&#x27;s research in dogs, which determined that the isolates of pancreatic secretion could be used to treat dogs with diabetes. This led to the 1922 discovery of insulin (with John Macleod) and its use in treating diabetes, which had previously meant death. John Cade&#x27;s research in guinea pigs discovered the anticonvulsant properties of lithium salts, which revolutionized the treatment of bipolar disorder, replacing the previous treatments of lobotomy or electroconvulsive therapy. Modern general anaesthetics, such as halothane and related compounds, were also developed through studies on model organisms, and are necessary for modern, complex surgical operations.

In the 1940s, Jonas Salk used rhesus monkey studies to isolate the most virulent forms of the polio virus, which led to his creation of a polio vaccine. The vaccine, which was made publicly available in 1955, reduced the incidence of polio 15-fold in the United States over the following five years. Albert Sabin improved the vaccine by passing the polio virus through animal hosts, including monkeys; the Sabin vaccine was produced for mass consumption in 1963, and had virtually eradicated polio in the United States by 1965. It has been estimated that developing and producing the vaccines required the use of 100,000 rhesus monkeys, with 65 doses of vaccine produced from each monkey. Sabin wrote in 1992, &quot;Without the use of animals and human beings, it would have been impossible to acquire the important knowledge needed to prevent much suffering and premature death not only among humans, but also among animals.&quot;

On 3 November 1957, a Soviet dog, Laika, became the first of many animals to orbit the Earth. In the 1970s, antibiotic treatments and vaccines for leprosy were developed using armadillos, then given to humans. The ability of humans to change the genetics of animals took an enormous step forward in 1974 when Rudolf Jaenisch could produce the first transgenic mammal, by integrating DNA from simians into the genome of mice. This genetic research progressed rapidly and, in 1996, Dolly the sheep was born, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell.

Other 20th-century medical advances and treatments that relied on research performed in animals include organ transplant techniques, the heart-lung machine, antibiotics, and the whooping cough vaccine. Treatments for animal diseases have also been developed, including for rabies, anthrax, glanders, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), tuberculosis, Texas cattle fever, classical swine fever (hog cholera), heartworm, and other parasitic infections. Animal experimentation continues to be required for biomedical research, and is used with the aim of solving medical problems such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, many headaches, and other conditions in which there is no useful &quot;in vitro&quot; model system available.

Toxicology testing became important in the 20th century. In the 19th century, laws regulating drugs were more relaxed. For example, in the US, the government could only ban a drug after they had prosecuted a company for selling products that harmed customers. However, in response to the Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster of 1937 in which the eponymous drug killed over 100 users, the US Congress passed laws that required safety testing of drugs on animals before they could be marketed. Other countries enacted similar legislation. In the 1960s, in reaction to the Thalidomide tragedy, further laws were passed requiring safety testing on pregnant animals before a drug can be sold.

==Model organisms==

===Invertebrates===

Although many more invertebrates than vertebrates are used in animal testing, these studies are largely unregulated by law. The most frequently used invertebrate species are &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, a fruit fly, and &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;, a nematode worm. In the case of &quot;C. elegans&quot;, the worm&#x27;s body is completely transparent and the precise lineage of all the organism&#x27;s cells is known, while studies in the fly &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; can use an amazing array of genetic tools. These invertebrates offer some advantages over vertebrates in animal testing, including their short life cycle and the ease with which large numbers may be housed and studied. However, the lack of an adaptive immune system and their simple organs prevent worms from being used in several aspects of medical research such as vaccine development. Similarly, the fruit fly immune system differs greatly from that of humans, and diseases in insects can be different from diseases in vertebrates; however, fruit flies and waxworms can be useful in studies to identify novel virulence factors or pharmacologically active compounds.

Several invertebrate systems are considered acceptable alternatives to vertebrates in early-stage discovery screens. Because of similarities between the innate immune system of insects and mammals, insects can replace mammals in some types of studies. &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; and the &quot;Galleria mellonella&quot; waxworm have been particularly important for analysis of virulent traits of mammalian pathogens. Waxworms and other insects have also proven valuable for the identification of pharmaceutical compounds with favorable bioavailability. The decision to adopt such models generally involves accepting a lower degree of biological similarity with mammals for significant gains in experimental throughput.

===Rodents===
In the U.S., the numbers of rats and mice used is estimated to be from 11 million to between 20 and 100 million a year. Other rodents commonly used are guinea pigs, hamsters, and gerbils. Mice are the most commonly used vertebrate species because of their size, low cost, ease of handling, and fast reproduction rate. Mice are widely considered to be the best model of inherited human disease and share 95% of their genes with humans. With the advent of genetic engineering technology, genetically modified mice can be generated to order and can provide models for a range of human diseases. Rats are also widely used for physiology, toxicology and cancer research, but genetic manipulation is much harder in rats than in mice, which limits the use of these rodents in basic science.

===Dogs===
Dogs are widely used in biomedical research, testing, and education—particularly beagles, because they are gentle and easy to handle, and to allow for comparisons with historical data from beagles (a Reduction technique). They are used as models for human and veterinary diseases in cardiology, endocrinology, and bone and joint studies, research that tends to be highly invasive, according to the Humane Society of the United States. The most common use of dogs is in the safety assessment of new medicines for human or veterinary use as a second species following testing in rodents, in accordance with the regulations set out in the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. One of the most significant advancements in medical science involves the use of dogs in developing the answers to insulin production in the body for diabetics and the role of the pancreas in this process. They found that the pancreas was responsible for producing insulin in the body and that removal of the pancreas, resulted in the development of diabetes in the dog. After re-injecting the pancreatic extract (insulin), the blood glucose levels were significantly lowered. The advancements made in this research involving the use of dogs has resulted in a definite improvement in the quality of life for both humans and animals.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Animal Welfare Report shows that 60,979 dogs were used in USDA-registered facilities in 2016. In the UK, according to the UK Home Office, there were 3,847 procedures on dogs in 2017. Of the other large EU users of dogs, Germany conducted 3,976 procedures on dogs in 2016 and France conducted 4,204 procedures in 2016. In both cases this represents under 0.2% of the total number of procedures conducted on animals in the respective countries.

=== Zebrafish ===
Zebrafish are commonly used for the basic study and development of various cancers. Used to explore the immune system and genetic strains. They are low in cost, small in size, have a fast reproduction rate, and able to observe cancer cells in real time. Humans and zebrafish share neoplasm similarities which is why they are used for research. The National Library of Medicine shows many examples of the types of cancer zebrafish are used in. The use of zebrafish have allowed them to find differences between MYC-driven pre-B vs T-ALL and be exploited to discover novel pre-B ALL therapies on acute lymphocytic leukemia.

The National Library of Medicine also explains how a neoplasm is difficult to diagnose at an early stage. Understanding the molecular mechanism of digestive tract tumorigenesis and searching for new treatments is the current research. Zebrafish and humans share similar gastric cancer cells in the gastric cancer xenotransplantation model. This allowed researchers to find that Triphala could inhibit the growth and metastasis of gastric cancer cells. Since zebrafish liver cancer genes are related with humans they have become widely used in liver cancer search, as will as many other cancers.

===Non-human primates===

Non-human primates (NHPs) are used in toxicology tests, studies of AIDS and hepatitis, studies of neurology, behavior and cognition, reproduction, genetics, and xenotransplantation. They are caught in the wild or purpose-bred. In the United States and China, most primates are domestically purpose-bred, whereas in Europe the majority are imported purpose-bred. The European Commission reported that in 2011, 6,012 monkeys were experimented on in European laboratories. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there were 71,188 monkeys in U.S. laboratories in 2016. 23,465 monkeys were imported into the U.S. in 2014 including 929 who were caught in the wild. Most of the NHPs used in experiments are macaques; but marmosets, spider monkeys, and squirrel monkeys are also used, and baboons and chimpanzees are used in the US. , there are approximately 730 chimpanzees in U.S. laboratories.

In a survey in 2003, it was found that 89% of singly-housed primates exhibited self-injurious or abnormal stereotypyical behaviors including pacing, rocking, hair pulling, and biting among others.

The first transgenic primate was produced in 2001, with the development of a method that could introduce new genes into a rhesus macaque. This transgenic technology is now being applied in the search for a treatment for the genetic disorder Huntington&#x27;s disease. Notable studies on non-human primates have been part of the polio vaccine development, and development of Deep Brain Stimulation, and their current heaviest non-toxicological use occurs in the monkey AIDS model, SIV. In 2008, a proposal to ban all primates experiments in the EU has sparked a vigorous debate.

===Other species===

Over 500,000 fish and 9,000 amphibians were used in the UK in 2016. The main species used is the zebrafish, &quot;Danio rerio&quot;, which are translucent during their embryonic stage, and the African clawed frog, &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot;. Over 20,000 rabbits were used for animal testing in the UK in 2004. Albino rabbits are used in eye irritancy tests (Draize test) because rabbits have less tear flow than other animals, and the lack of eye pigment in albinos make the effects easier to visualize. The numbers of rabbits used for this purpose has fallen substantially over the past two decades. In 1996, there were 3,693 procedures on rabbits for eye irritation in the UK, and in 2017 this number was just 63. Rabbits are also frequently used for the production of polyclonal antibodies.

Cats are most commonly used in neurological research. In 2016, 18,898 cats were used in the United States alone, around a third of which were used in experiments which have the potential to cause &quot;pain and/or distress&quot; though only 0.1% of cat experiments involved potential pain which was not relieved by anesthetics/analgesics. In the UK, just 198 procedures were carried out on cats in 2017. The number has been around 200 for most of the last decade.

==Care and use of animals==
===Regulations and laws===
The regulations that apply to animals in laboratories vary across species. In the U.S., under the Animal Welfare Act and the &quot;Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals&quot; (the &quot;Guide&quot;), published by the National Academy of Sciences, any procedure can be performed on an animal if it can be successfully argued that it is scientifically justified. Researchers are required to consult with the institution&#x27;s veterinarian and its Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), which every research facility is obliged to maintain. The IACUC must ensure that alternatives, including non-animal alternatives, have been considered, that the experiments are not unnecessarily duplicative, and that pain relief is given unless it would interfere with the study. The IACUCs regulate all vertebrates in testing at institutions receiving federal funds in the USA. Although the Animal Welfare Act does not include purpose-bred rodents and birds, these species are equally regulated under Public Health Service policies that govern the IACUCs. The Public Health Service policy oversees the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC conducts infectious disease research on nonhuman primates, rabbits, mice, and other animals, while FDA requirements cover use of animals in pharmaceutical research. Animal Welfare Act (AWA) regulations are enforced by the USDA, whereas Public Health Service regulations are enforced by OLAW and in many cases by AAALAC.

According to the 2014 U.S. Department of Agriculture Office of the Inspector General (OIG) report—which looked at the oversight of animal use during a three-year period—&quot;some Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees ...did not adequately approve, monitor, or report on experimental procedures on animals&quot;. The OIG found that &quot;as a result, animals are not always receiving basic humane care and treatment and, in some cases, pain and distress are not minimized during and after experimental procedures&quot;. According to the report, within a three-year period, nearly half of all American laboratories with regulated species were cited for AWA violations relating to improper IACUC oversight. The USDA OIG made similar findings in a 2005 report. With only a broad number of 120 inspectors, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) oversees more than 12,000 facilities involved in research, exhibition, breeding, or dealing of animals. Others have criticized the composition of IACUCs, asserting that the committees are predominantly made up of animal researchers and university representatives who may be biased against animal welfare concerns.

Larry Carbone, a laboratory animal veterinarian, writes that, in his experience, IACUCs take their work very seriously regardless of the species involved, though the use of non-human primates always raises what he calls a &quot;red flag of special concern&quot;. A study published in &quot;Science&quot; magazine in July 2001 confirmed the low reliability of IACUC reviews of animal experiments. Funded by the National Science Foundation, the three-year study found that animal-use committees that do not know the specifics of the university and personnel do not make the same approval decisions as those made by animal-use committees that do know the university and personnel. Specifically, blinded committees more often ask for more information rather than approving studies.

Scientists in India are protesting a recent guideline issued by the University Grants Commission to ban the use of live animals in universities and laboratories.

===Numbers===
Accurate global figures for animal testing are difficult to obtain; it has been estimated that 100 million vertebrates are experimented on around the world every year, 10–11 million of them in the EU. The Nuffield Council on Bioethics reports that global annual estimates range from 50 to 100 million animals. None of the figures include invertebrates such as shrimp and fruit flies.The USDA/APHIS has published the 2016 animal research statistics. Overall, the number of animals (covered by the Animal Welfare Act) used in research in the US rose 6.9% from 767,622 (2015) to 820,812 (2016). This includes both public and private institutions. By comparing with EU data, where all vertebrate species are counted, Speaking of Research estimated that around 12 million vertebrates were used in research in the US in 2016. A 2015 article published in the &quot;Journal of Medical Ethics&quot;, argued that the use of animals in the US has dramatically increased in recent years. Researchers found this increase is largely the result of an increased reliance on genetically modified mice in animal studies.

In 1995, researchers at Tufts University Center for Animals and Public Policy estimated that 14–21 million animals were used in American laboratories in 1992, a reduction from a high of 50 million used in 1970. In 1986, the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment reported that estimates of the animals used in the U.S. range from 10 million to upwards of 100 million each year, and that their own best estimate was at least 17 million to 22 million. In 2016, the Department of Agriculture listed 60,979 dogs, 18,898 cats, 71,188 non-human primates, 183,237 guinea pigs, 102,633 hamsters, 139,391 rabbits, 83,059 farm animals, and 161,467 other mammals, a total of 820,812, a figure that includes all mammals except purpose-bred mice and rats. The use of dogs and cats in research in the U.S. decreased from 1973 to 2016 from 195,157 to 60,979, and from 66,165 to 18,898, respectively.

In the UK, Home Office figures show that 3.79 million procedures were carried out in 2017. 2,960 procedures used non-human primates, down over 50% since 1988. A &quot;procedure&quot; refers here to an experiment that might last minutes, several months, or years. Most animals are used in only one procedure: animals are frequently euthanized after the experiment; however death is the endpoint of some procedures.
The procedures conducted on animals in the UK in 2017 were categorised as: 43% (1.61 million) sub-threshold, 4% (0.14 million) non-recovery, 36% (1.35 million) mild, 15% (0.55 million) moderate, and 4% (0.14 million) severe. A &#x27;severe&#x27; procedure would be, for instance, any test where death is the end-point or fatalities are expected, whereas a &#x27;mild&#x27; procedure would be something like a blood test or an MRI scan.

===The Three Rs===

The Three Rs (3Rs) are guiding principles for more ethical use of animals in testing. These were first described by W.M.S. Russell and R.L. Burch in 1959. The 3Rs state:
# Replacement which refers to the preferred use of non-animal methods over animal methods whenever it is possible to achieve the same scientific aims. These methods include computer modeling.
# Reduction which refers to methods that enable researchers to obtain comparable levels of information from fewer animals, or to obtain more information from the same number of animals.
# Refinement which refers to methods that alleviate or minimize potential pain, suffering or distress, and enhance animal welfare for the animals used. These methods include non-invasive techniques.
The 3Rs have a broader scope than simply encouraging alternatives to animal testing, but aim to improve animal welfare and scientific quality where the use of animals can not be avoided. These 3Rs are now implemented in many testing establishments worldwide and have been adopted by various pieces of legislation and regulations.

Despite the widespread acceptance of the 3Rs, many countries—including Canada, Australia, Israel, South Korea, and Germany—have reported rising experimental use of animals in recent years with increased use of mice and, in some cases, fish while reporting declines in the use of cats, dogs, primates, rabbits, guinea pigs, and hamsters. Along with other countries, China has also escalated its use of GM animals, resulting in an increase in overall animal use.

===Sources===

Animals used by laboratories are largely supplied by specialist dealers. Sources differ for vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Most laboratories breed and raise flies and worms themselves, using strains and mutants supplied from a few main stock centers. For vertebrates, sources include breeders and dealers including Fortrea and Charles River Laboratories, which supply purpose-bred and wild-caught animals; businesses that trade in wild animals such as Nafovanny; and dealers who supply animals sourced from pounds, auctions, and newspaper ads. Animal shelters also supply the laboratories directly. Large centers also exist to distribute strains of genetically modified animals; the International Knockout Mouse Consortium, for example, aims to provide knockout mice for every gene in the mouse genome.

In the U.S., Class A breeders are licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to sell animals for research purposes, while Class B dealers are licensed to buy animals from &quot;random sources&quot; such as auctions, pound seizure, and newspaper ads. Some Class B dealers have been accused of kidnapping pets and illegally trapping strays, a practice known as &quot;bunching&quot;. It was in part out of public concern over the sale of pets to research facilities that the 1966 Laboratory Animal Welfare Act was ushered in—the Senate Committee on Commerce reported in 1966 that stolen pets had been retrieved from Veterans Administration facilities, the Mayo Institute, the University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, and Harvard and Yale Medical Schools. The USDA recovered at least a dozen stolen pets during a raid on a Class B dealer in Arkansas in 2003.

Four states in the U.S.—Minnesota, Utah, Oklahoma, and Iowa—require their shelters to provide animals to research facilities. Fourteen states explicitly prohibit the practice, while the remainder either allow it or have no relevant legislation.

In the European Union, animal sources are governed by &quot;Council Directive 86/609/EEC&quot;, which requires lab animals to be specially bred, unless the animal has been lawfully imported and is not a wild animal or a stray. The latter requirement may also be exempted by special arrangement. In 2010 the Directive was revised with EU Directive 2010/63/EU. In the UK, most animals used in experiments are bred for the purpose under the 1988 Animal Protection Act, but wild-caught primates may be used if exceptional and specific justification can be established. The United States also allows the use of wild-caught primates; between 1995 and 1999, 1,580 wild baboons were imported into the U.S. Most of the primates imported are handled by Charles River Laboratories or by Fortrea, which are very active in the international primate trade.

===Pain and suffering===
The extent to which animal testing causes pain and suffering, and the capacity of animals to experience and comprehend them, is the subject of much debate.

According to the USDA, in 2016 501,560 animals (61%) (not including rats, mice, birds, or invertebrates) were used in procedures that did not include more than momentary pain or distress. 247,882 (31%) animals were used in procedures in which pain or distress was relieved by anesthesia, while 71,370 (9%) were used in studies that would cause pain or distress that would not be relieved.

The idea that animals might not feel pain as human beings feel it traces back to the 17th-century French philosopher, René Descartes, who argued that animals do not experience pain and suffering because they lack consciousness. Bernard Rollin of Colorado State University, the principal author of two U.S. federal laws regulating pain relief for animals, writes that researchers remained unsure into the 1980s as to whether animals experience pain, and that veterinarians trained in the U.S. before 1989 were simply taught to ignore animal pain. In his interactions with scientists and other veterinarians, he was regularly asked to &quot;prove&quot; that animals are conscious, and to provide &quot;scientifically acceptable&quot; grounds for claiming that they feel pain. Carbone writes that &quot;the view that animals feel pain differently is now a minority view.&quot; Academic reviews of the topic are more equivocal, noting that although the argument that animals have at least simple conscious thoughts and feelings has strong support, some critics continue to question how reliably animal mental states can be determined. However, some canine experts are stating that, while intelligence does differ animal to animal, dogs have the intelligence of a two to two-and-a-half-year old. This does support the idea that dogs, at the very least, have some form of consciousness. The ability of invertebrates to experience pain and suffering is less clear, however, legislation in several countries (e.g. U.K., New Zealand, Norway) protects some invertebrate species if they are being used in animal testing.

In the U.S., the defining text on animal welfare regulation in animal testing is the &quot;Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals&quot;. This defines the parameters that govern animal testing in the U.S. It states &quot;The ability to experience and respond to pain is widespread in the animal kingdom...Pain is a stressor and, if not relieved, can lead to unacceptable levels of stress and distress in animals.&quot; The Guide states that the ability to recognize the symptoms of pain in different species is vital in efficiently applying pain relief and that it is essential for the people caring for and using animals to be entirely familiar with these symptoms. On the subject of analgesics used to relieve pain, the Guide states &quot;The selection of the most appropriate analgesic or anesthetic should reflect professional judgment as to which best meets clinical and humane requirements without compromising the scientific aspects of the research protocol&quot;. Accordingly, all issues of animal pain and distress, and their potential treatment with analgesia and anesthesia, are required regulatory issues in receiving animal protocol approval. Currently, traumatic methods of marking laboratory animals are being replaced with non-invasive alternatives.

In 2019, Katrien Devolder and Matthias Eggel proposed gene editing research animals to remove the ability to feel pain. This would be an intermediate step towards eventually stopping all experimentation on animals and adopting alternatives. Additionally, this would not stop research animals from experiencing psychological harm.

===Euthanasia===

Regulations require that scientists use as few animals as possible, especially for terminal experiments. However, while policy makers consider suffering to be the central issue and see animal euthanasia as a way to reduce suffering, others, such as the RSPCA, argue that the lives of laboratory animals have intrinsic value. Regulations focus on whether particular methods cause pain and suffering, not whether their death is undesirable in itself. The animals are euthanized at the end of studies for sample collection or post-mortem examination; during studies if their pain or suffering falls into certain categories regarded as unacceptable, such as depression, infection that is unresponsive to treatment, or the failure of large animals to eat for five days; or when they are unsuitable for breeding or unwanted for some other reason.

Methods of euthanizing laboratory animals are chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death without pain or distress. The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal can be made to inhale a gas, such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. Sedatives or anesthetics such as barbiturates can be given intravenously, or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as tricaine. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include decapitation (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. Cervical dislocation (breaking the neck or spine) may be used for birds, mice, rats, and rabbits depending on the size and weight of the animal. High-intensity microwave irradiation of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. Captive bolts may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious. Electrocution may be used for cattle, sheep, swine, foxes, and mink after the animals are unconscious, often by a prior electrical stun. Pithing (inserting a tool into the base of the brain) is usable on animals already unconscious. Slow or rapid freezing, or inducing air embolism are acceptable only with prior anesthesia to induce unconsciousness.

==Research classification==
===Pure research===
Basic or pure research investigates how organisms behave, develop, and function. Those opposed to animal testing object that pure research may have little or no practical purpose, but researchers argue that it forms the necessary basis for the development of applied research, rendering the distinction between pure and applied research—research that has a specific practical aim—unclear. Pure research uses larger numbers and a greater variety of animals than applied research. Fruit flies, nematode worms, mice and rats together account for the vast majority, though small numbers of other species are used, ranging from sea slugs through to armadillos. Examples of the types of animals and experiments used in basic research include:
* Studies on &quot;embryogenesis&quot; and &quot;developmental biology&quot;. Mutants are created by adding transposons into their genomes, or specific genes are deleted by gene targeting. By studying the changes in development these changes produce, scientists aim to understand both how organisms normally develop, and what can go wrong in this process. These studies are particularly powerful since the basic controls of development, such as the homeobox genes, have similar functions in organisms as diverse as fruit flies and man.
* Experiments into &quot;behavior&quot;, to understand how organisms detect and interact with each other and their environment, in which fruit flies, worms, mice, and rats are all widely used. Studies of brain function, such as memory and social behavior, often use rats and birds. For some species, behavioral research is combined with enrichment strategies for animals in captivity because it allows them to engage in a wider range of activities.
* Breeding experiments to study &quot;evolution&quot; and &quot;genetics&quot;. Laboratory mice, flies, fish, and worms are inbred through many generations to create strains with defined characteristics. These provide animals of a known genetic background, an important tool for genetic analyses. Larger mammals are rarely bred specifically for such studies due to their slow rate of reproduction, though some scientists take advantage of inbred domesticated animals, such as dog or cattle breeds, for comparative purposes. Scientists studying how animals evolve use many animal species to see how variations in where and how an organism lives (their niche) produce adaptations in their physiology and morphology. As an example, sticklebacks are now being used to study how many and which types of mutations are selected to produce adaptations in animals&#x27; morphology during the evolution of new species.

===Applied research===
Applied research aims to solve specific and practical problems. These may involve the use of animal models of diseases or conditions, which are often discovered or generated by pure research programmes. In turn, such applied studies may be an early stage in the drug discovery process. Examples include:
* Genetic modification of animals to study disease. Transgenic animals have specific genes inserted, modified or removed, to mimic specific conditions such as single gene disorders, such as Huntington&#x27;s disease. Other models mimic complex, multifactorial diseases with genetic components, such as diabetes, or even transgenic mice that carry the same mutations that occur during the development of cancer. These models allow investigations on how and why the disease develops, as well as providing ways to develop and test new treatments. The vast majority of these transgenic models of human disease are lines of mice, the mammalian species in which genetic modification is most efficient. Smaller numbers of other animals are also used, including rats, pigs, sheep, fish, birds, and amphibians.
* Studies on models of naturally occurring disease and condition. Certain domestic and wild animals have a natural propensity or predisposition for certain conditions that are also found in humans. Cats are used as a model to develop immunodeficiency virus vaccines and to study leukemia because their natural predisposition to FIV and Feline leukemia virus. Certain breeds of dog experience narcolepsy making them the major model used to study the human condition. Armadillos and humans are among only a few animal species that naturally have leprosy; as the bacteria responsible for this disease cannot yet be grown in culture, armadillos are the primary source of bacilli used in leprosy vaccines.
* Studies on induced animal models of human diseases. Here, an animal is treated so that it develops pathology and symptoms that resemble a human disease. Examples include restricting blood flow to the brain to induce stroke, or giving neurotoxins that cause damage similar to that seen in Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Much animal research into potential treatments for humans is wasted because it is poorly conducted and not evaluated through systematic reviews. For example, although such models are now widely used to study Parkinson&#x27;s disease, the British anti-vivisection interest group BUAV argues that these models only superficially resemble the disease symptoms, without the same time course or cellular pathology. In contrast, scientists assessing the usefulness of animal models of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, as well as the medical research charity &quot;The Parkinson&#x27;s Appeal&quot;, state that these models were invaluable and that they led to improved surgical treatments such as pallidotomy, new drug treatments such as levodopa, and later deep brain stimulation.
* Animal testing has also included the use of placebo testing. In these cases animals are treated with a substance that produces no pharmacological effect, but is administered in order to determine any biological alterations due to the experience of a substance being administered, and the results are compared with those obtained with an active compound.

====Xenotransplantation====

Xenotransplantation research involves transplanting tissues or organs from one species to another, as a way to overcome the shortage of human organs for use in organ transplants. Current research involves using primates as the recipients of organs from pigs that have been genetically modified to reduce the primates&#x27; immune response against the pig tissue. Although transplant rejection remains a problem, recent clinical trials that involved implanting pig insulin-secreting cells into diabetics did reduce these people&#x27;s need for insulin.

Documents released to the news media by the animal rights organization Uncaged Campaigns showed that, between 1994 and 2000, wild baboons imported to the UK from Africa by Imutran Ltd, a subsidiary of Novartis Pharma AG, in conjunction with Cambridge University and Huntingdon Life Sciences, to be used in experiments that involved grafting pig tissues, had serious and sometimes fatal injuries. A scandal occurred when it was revealed that the company had communicated with the British government in an attempt to avoid regulation.

===Toxicology testing===

Toxicology testing, also known as safety testing, is conducted by pharmaceutical companies testing drugs, or by contract animal testing facilities, such as Huntingdon Life Sciences, on behalf of a wide variety of customers. According to 2005 EU figures, around one million animals are used every year in Europe in toxicology tests; which are about 10% of all procedures. According to &quot;Nature&quot;, 5,000 animals are used for each chemical being tested, with 12,000 needed to test pesticides. The tests are conducted without anesthesia, because interactions between drugs can affect how animals detoxify chemicals, and may interfere with the results.

Toxicology tests are used to examine finished products such as pesticides, medications, food additives, packing materials, and air freshener, or their chemical ingredients. Most tests involve testing ingredients rather than finished products, but according to BUAV, manufacturers believe these tests overestimate the toxic effects of substances; they therefore repeat the tests using their finished products to obtain a less toxic label.

The substances are applied to the skin or dripped into the eyes; injected intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously; inhaled either by placing a mask over the animals and restraining them, or by placing them in an inhalation chamber; or administered orally, through a tube into the stomach, or simply in the animal&#x27;s food. Doses may be given once, repeated regularly for many months, or for the lifespan of the animal.

There are several different types of acute toxicity tests. The (&quot;Lethal Dose 50%&quot;) test is used to evaluate the toxicity of a substance by determining the dose required to kill 50% of the test animal population. This test was removed from OECD international guidelines in 2002, replaced by methods such as the fixed dose procedure, which use fewer animals and cause less suffering. Abbott writes that, as of 2005, &quot;the LD50 acute toxicity test ... still accounts for one-third of all animal [toxicity] tests worldwide&quot;.

Irritancy can be measured using the Draize test, where a test substance is applied to an animal&#x27;s eyes or skin, usually an albino rabbit. For Draize eye testing, the test involves observing the effects of the substance at intervals and grading any damage or irritation, but the test should be halted and the animal killed if it shows &quot;continuing signs of severe pain or distress&quot;. The Humane Society of the United States writes that the procedure can cause redness, ulceration, hemorrhaging, cloudiness, or even blindness. This test has also been criticized by scientists for being cruel and inaccurate, subjective, over-sensitive, and failing to reflect human exposures in the real world. Although no accepted &quot;in vitro&quot; alternatives exist, a modified form of the Draize test called the &quot;low volume eye test&quot; may reduce suffering and provide more realistic results and this was adopted as the new standard in September 2009. However, the Draize test will still be used for substances that are not severe irritants.

The most stringent tests are reserved for drugs and foodstuffs. For these, a number of tests are performed, lasting less than a month (acute), one to three months (subchronic), and more than three months (chronic) to test general toxicity (damage to organs), eye and skin irritancy, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and reproductive problems. The cost of the full complement of tests is several million dollars per substance and it may take three or four years to complete.

These toxicity tests provide, in the words of a 2006 United States National Academy of Sciences report, &quot;critical information for assessing hazard and risk potential&quot;. Animal tests may overestimate risk, with false positive results being a particular problem, but false positives appear not to be prohibitively common. Variability in results arises from using the effects of high doses of chemicals in small numbers of laboratory animals to try to predict the effects of low doses in large numbers of humans. Although relationships do exist, opinion is divided on how to use data on one species to predict the exact level of risk in another.

Scientists face growing pressure to move away from using traditional animal toxicity tests to determine whether manufactured chemicals are safe.
Among variety of approaches to toxicity evaluation the ones which have attracted increasing interests are in vitro cell-based sensing methods applying fluorescence.

====Cosmetics testing====

Cosmetics testing on animals is particularly controversial. Such tests, which are still conducted in the U.S., involve general toxicity, eye and skin irritancy, phototoxicity (toxicity triggered by ultraviolet light) and mutagenicity.

Cosmetics testing on animals is banned in India, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Israel and Norway while legislation in the U.S. and Brazil is currently considering similar bans. In 2002, after 13 years of discussion, the European Union agreed to phase in a near-total ban on the sale of animal-tested cosmetics by 2009, and to ban all cosmetics-related animal testing. France, which is home to the world&#x27;s largest cosmetics company, L&#x27;Oreal, has protested the proposed ban by lodging a case at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, asking that the ban be quashed. The ban is also opposed by the European Federation for Cosmetics Ingredients, which represents 70 companies in Switzerland, Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy. In October 2014, India passed stricter laws that also ban the importation of any cosmetic products that are tested on animals.

===Drug testing===
Before the early 20th century, laws regulating drugs were lax. Currently, all new pharmaceuticals undergo rigorous animal testing before being licensed for human use. Tests on pharmaceutical products involve:
* &quot;metabolic tests&quot;, investigating pharmacokinetics—how drugs are absorbed, metabolized and excreted by the body when introduced , intravenously, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, or transdermally.
* &quot;toxicology tests&quot;, which gauge acute, sub-acute, and chronic toxicity. Acute toxicity is studied by using a rising dose until signs of toxicity become apparent. Current European legislation demands that &quot;acute toxicity tests must be carried out in two or more mammalian species&quot; covering &quot;at least two different routes of administration&quot;. Sub-acute toxicity is where the drug is given to the animals for four to six weeks in doses below the level at which it causes rapid poisoning, in order to discover if any toxic drug metabolites build up over time. Testing for chronic toxicity can last up to two years and, in the European Union, is required to involve two species of mammals, one of which must be non-rodent.
* &quot;efficacy studies&quot;, which test whether experimental drugs work by inducing the appropriate illness in animals. The drug is then administered in a double-blind controlled trial, which allows researchers to determine the effect of the drug and the dose-response curve.
* Specific tests on &quot;reproductive function&quot;, &quot;embryonic toxicity&quot;, or &quot;carcinogenic potential&quot; can all be required by law, depending on the result of other studies and the type of drug being tested.

===Education===
It is estimated that 20 million animals are used annually for educational purposes in the United States including, classroom observational exercises, dissections and live-animal surgeries. Frogs, fetal pigs, perch, cats, earthworms, grasshoppers, crayfish and starfish are commonly used in classroom dissections. Alternatives to the use of animals in classroom dissections are widely used, with many U.S. States and school districts mandating students be offered the choice to not dissect. Citing the wide availability of alternatives and the decimation of local frog species, India banned dissections in 2014.

The Sonoran Arthropod Institute hosts an annual Invertebrates in Education and Conservation Conference to discuss the use of invertebrates in education. There also are efforts in many countries to find alternatives to using animals in education. The NORINA database, maintained by Norecopa, lists products that may be used as alternatives or supplements to animal use in education, and in the training of personnel who work with animals. These include alternatives to dissection in schools. InterNICHE has a similar database and a loans system.

In November 2013, the U.S.-based company Backyard Brains released for sale to the public what they call the &quot;Roboroach&quot;, an &quot;electronic backpack&quot; that can be attached to cockroaches. The operator is required to amputate a cockroach&#x27;s antennae, use sandpaper to wear down the shell, insert a wire into the thorax, and then glue the electrodes and circuit board onto the insect&#x27;s back. A mobile phone app can then be used to control it via Bluetooth. It has been suggested that the use of such a device may be a teaching aid that can promote interest in science. The makers of the &quot;Roboroach&quot; have been funded by the National Institute of Mental Health and state that the device is intended to encourage children to become interested in neuroscience.

===Defense===
Animals are used by the military to develop weapons, vaccines, battlefield surgical techniques, and defensive clothing. For example, in 2008 the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency used live pigs to study the effects of improvised explosive device explosions on internal organs, especially the brain.

In the US military, goats are commonly used to train combat medics. (Goats have become the main animal species used for this purpose after the Pentagon phased out using dogs for medical training in the 1980s.) While modern mannequins used in medical training are quite efficient in simulating the behavior of a human body, some trainees feel that &quot;the goat exercise provide[s] a sense of urgency that only real life trauma can provide&quot;. Nevertheless, in 2014, the U.S. Coast Guard announced that it would reduce the number of animals it uses in its training exercises by half after PETA released video showing Guard members cutting off the limbs of unconscious goats with tree trimmers and inflicting other injuries with a shotgun, pistol, ax and a scalpel. That same year, citing the availability of human simulators and other alternatives, the Department of Defense announced it would begin reducing the number of animals it uses in various training programs. In 2013, several Navy medical centers stopped using ferrets in intubation exercises after complaints from PETA.

Besides the United States, six out of 28 NATO countries, including Poland and Denmark, use live animals for combat medic training.

==Ethics==

Most animals are euthanized after being used in an experiment. Sources of laboratory animals vary between countries and species; most animals are purpose-bred, while a minority are caught in the wild or supplied by dealers who obtain them from auctions and pounds. Supporters of the use of animals in experiments, such as the British Royal Society, argue that virtually every medical achievement in the 20th century relied on the use of animals in some way. The Institute for Laboratory Animal Research of the United States National Academy of Sciences has argued that animal testing cannot be replaced by even sophisticated computer models, which are unable to deal with the extremely complex interactions between molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organisms and the environment. Animal rights organizations—such as PETA and BUAV—question the need for and legitimacy of animal testing, arguing that it is cruel and poorly regulated, that medical progress is actually held back by misleading animal models that cannot reliably predict effects in humans, that some of the tests are outdated, that the costs outweigh the benefits, or that animals have the intrinsic right not to be used or harmed in experimentation.

===Viewpoints===

The moral and ethical questions raised by performing experiments on animals are subject to debate, and viewpoints have shifted significantly over the 20th century. There remain disagreements about which procedures are useful for which purposes, as well as disagreements over which ethical principles apply to which species.

A 2015 Gallup poll found that 67% of Americans were &quot;very concerned&quot; or &quot;somewhat concerned&quot; about animals used in research. A Pew poll taken the same year found 50% of American adults opposed the use of animals in research.

Still, a wide range of viewpoints exist. The view that animals have moral rights (animal rights) is a philosophical position proposed by Tom Regan, among others, who argues that animals are beings with beliefs and desires, and as such are the &quot;subjects of a life&quot; with moral value and therefore moral rights. Regan still sees ethical differences between killing human and non-human animals, and argues that to save the former it is permissible to kill the latter. Likewise, a &quot;moral dilemma&quot; view suggests that avoiding potential benefit to humans is unacceptable on similar grounds, and holds the issue to be a dilemma in balancing such harm to humans to the harm done to animals in research. In contrast, an abolitionist view in animal rights holds that there is no moral justification for any harmful research on animals that is not to the benefit of the individual animal. Bernard Rollin argues that benefits to human beings cannot outweigh animal suffering, and that human beings have no moral right to use an animal in ways that do not benefit that individual. Donald Watson has stated that vivisection and animal experimentation &quot;is probably the cruelest of all Man&#x27;s attack on the rest of Creation.&quot; Another prominent position is that of philosopher Peter Singer, who argues that there are no grounds to include a being&#x27;s species in considerations of whether their suffering is important in utilitarian moral considerations. Malcolm Macleod and collaborators argue that most controlled animal studies do not employ randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding outcome assessment, and that failure to employ these features exaggerates the apparent benefit of drugs tested in animals, leading to a failure to translate much animal research for human benefit.

Governments such as the Netherlands and New Zealand have responded to the public&#x27;s concerns by outlawing invasive experiments on certain classes of non-human primates, particularly the great apes. In 2015, captive chimpanzees in the U.S. were added to the Endangered Species Act adding new road blocks to those wishing to experiment on them. Similarly, citing ethical considerations and the availability of alternative research methods, the U.S. NIH announced in 2013 that it would dramatically reduce and eventually phase out experiments on chimpanzees.

The British government has required that the cost to animals in an experiment be weighed against the gain in knowledge. Some medical schools and agencies in China, Japan, and South Korea have built cenotaphs for killed animals. In Japan there are also annual memorial services &quot;Ireisai&quot; () for animals sacrificed at medical school.
Various specific cases of animal testing have drawn attention, including both instances of beneficial scientific research, and instances of alleged ethical violations by those performing the tests. The fundamental properties of muscle physiology were determined with work done using frog muscles (including the force generating mechanism of all muscle, the length-tension relationship, and the force-velocity curve), and frogs are still the preferred model organism due to the long survival of muscles &quot;in vitro&quot; and the possibility of isolating intact single-fiber preparations (not possible in other organisms). Modern physical therapy and the understanding and treatment of muscular disorders is based on this work and subsequent work in mice (often engineered to express disease states such as muscular dystrophy). In February 1997 a team at the Roslin Institute in Scotland announced the birth of Dolly the sheep, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic cell.

Concerns have been raised over the mistreatment of primates undergoing testing. In 1985, the case of Britches, a macaque monkey at the University of California, Riverside, gained public attention. He had his eyelids sewn shut and a sonar sensor on his head as part of an experiment to test sensory substitution devices for blind people. The laboratory was raided by Animal Liberation Front in 1985, removing Britches and 466 other animals. The National Institutes of Health conducted an eight-month investigation and concluded, however, that no corrective action was necessary. During the 2000s other cases have made headlines, including experiments at the University of Cambridge and Columbia University in 2002. In 2004 and 2005, undercover footage of staff of in an animal testing facility in Virginia owned by Covance (now Fortrea) was shot by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). Following release of the footage, the U.S. Department of Agriculture fined the company $8,720 for 16 citations, three of which involved lab monkeys; the other citations involved administrative issues and equipment.

===Threats to researchers===
Threats of violence to animal researchers are not uncommon.

In 2006, a primate researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) shut down the experiments in his lab after threats from animal rights activists. The researcher had received a grant to use 30 macaque monkeys for vision experiments; each monkey was anesthetized for a single physiological experiment lasting up to 120 hours, and then euthanized. The researcher&#x27;s name, phone number, and address were posted on the website of the Primate Freedom Project. Demonstrations were held in front of his home. A Molotov cocktail was placed on the porch of what was believed to be the home of another UCLA primate researcher; instead, it was accidentally left on the porch of an elderly woman unrelated to the university. The Animal Liberation Front claimed responsibility for the attack. As a result of the campaign, the researcher sent an email to the Primate Freedom Project stating &quot;you win&quot;, and &quot;please don&#x27;t bother my family anymore&quot;. In another incident at UCLA in June 2007, the Animal Liberation Brigade placed a bomb under the car of a UCLA children&#x27;s ophthalmologist who experiments on cats and rhesus monkeys; the bomb had a faulty fuse and did not detonate.

In 1997, PETA filmed staff from Huntingdon Life Sciences, showing dogs being mistreated. The employees responsible were dismissed, with two given community service orders and ordered to pay £250 costs, the first lab technicians to have been prosecuted for animal cruelty in the UK. The Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty campaign used tactics ranging from non-violent protest to the alleged firebombing of houses owned by executives associated with HLS&#x27;s clients and investors. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors US domestic extremism, has described SHAC&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot; as &quot;frankly terroristic tactics similar to those of anti-abortion extremists&quot;, and in 2005 an official with the FBI&#x27;s counter-terrorism division referred to SHAC&#x27;s activities in the United States as domestic terrorist threats. 13 members of SHAC were jailed for between 15 months and eleven years on charges of conspiracy to blackmail or harm HLS and its suppliers.

These attacks—as well as similar incidents that caused the Southern Poverty Law Center to declare in 2002 that the animal rights movement had &quot;clearly taken a turn toward the more extreme&quot;—prompted the US government to pass the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act and the UK government to add the offense of &quot;Intimidation of persons connected with animal research organisation&quot; to the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. Such legislation and the arrest and imprisonment of activists may have decreased the incidence of attacks.

=== Scientific criticism ===
Systematic reviews have pointed out that animal testing often fails to accurately mirror outcomes in humans. For instance, a 2013 review noted that some 100 vaccines have been shown to prevent HIV in animals, yet none of them have worked on humans. Effects seen in animals may not be replicated in humans, and vice versa. Many corticosteroids cause birth defects in animals, but not in humans. Conversely, thalidomide causes serious birth defects in humans, but not in some animals such as mice (however, it does cause birth defects in rabbits). A 2004 paper concluded that much animal research is wasted because systemic reviews are not used, and due to poor methodology. A 2006 review found multiple studies where there were promising results for new drugs in animals, but human clinical studies did not show the same results. The researchers suggested that this might be due to researcher bias, or simply because animal models do not accurately reflect human biology. Lack of meta-reviews may be partially to blame. Poor methodology is an issue in many studies. A 2009 review noted that many animal experiments did not use blinded experiments, a key element of many scientific studies in which researchers are not told about the part of the study they are working on to reduce bias. A 2021 paper found, in a sample of Open Access Alzheimer Disease studies, that if the authors omit from the title that the experiment was performed in mice, the News Headline follow suit, and that also the Twitter repercussion is higher.

===Activism===
There are various examples of activists utilizing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to obtain information about taxpayer funding of animal testing. For example, the White Coat Waste Project, a group of activists that hold that taxpayers should not have

to pay $20 billion every year for experiments on animals, highlighted that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases provided $400,000 in taxpayer money to fund experiments in which 28 beagles were infected by disease-causing parasites. The White Coat Project found reports that said dogs taking part in the experiments were &quot;vocalizing in pain&quot; after being injected with foreign substances. Following public outcry, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) made a call to action that all members of the National Institute of Health resign effective immediately and that there is a &quot;need to find a new NIH director to replace the outgoing Francis Collins who will shut down research that violates the dignity of nonhuman animals.&quot;

===Historical debate===

As the experimentation on animals increased, especially the practice of vivisection, so did criticism and controversy. In 1655, the advocate of Galenic physiology Edmund O&#x27;Meara said that &quot;the miserable torture of vivisection places the body in an unnatural state&quot;. O&#x27;Meara and others argued pain could affect animal physiology during vivisection, rendering results unreliable. There were also objections ethically, contending that the benefit to humans did not justify the harm to animals. Early objections to animal testing also came from another angle—many people believed animals were inferior to humans and so different that results from animals could not be applied to humans.

On the other side of the debate, those in favor of animal testing held that experiments on animals were necessary to advance medical and biological knowledge. Claude Bernard—who is sometimes known as the &quot;prince of vivisectors&quot; and the father of physiology, and whose wife, Marie Françoise Martin, founded the first anti-vivisection society in France in 1883—famously wrote in 1865 that &quot;the science of life is a superb and dazzlingly lighted hall which may be reached only by passing through a long and ghastly kitchen&quot;. Arguing that &quot;experiments on animals are entirely conclusive for the toxicology and hygiene of man effects of these substances are the same on man as on animals, save for differences in degree&quot;, Bernard established animal experimentation as part of the standard scientific method.

In 1896, the physiologist and physician Dr. Walter B. Cannon said &quot;The antivivisectionists are the second of the two types Theodore Roosevelt described when he said, &#x27;Common sense without conscience may lead to crime, but conscience without common sense may lead to folly, which is the handmaiden of crime. These divisions between pro- and anti-animal testing groups first came to public attention during the Brown Dog affair in the early 1900s, when hundreds of medical students clashed with anti-vivisectionists and police over a memorial to a vivisected dog.

In 1822, the first animal protection law was enacted in the British parliament, followed by the Cruelty to Animals Act (1876), the first law specifically aimed at regulating animal testing. The legislation was promoted by Charles Darwin, who wrote to Ray Lankester in March 1871: &quot;You ask about my opinion on vivisection. I quite agree that it is justifiable for proper investigations on physiology; but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject which makes me sick with horror, so I will not say another word about it, else I shall not sleep to-night.&quot; In response to the lobbying by anti-vivisectionists, several organizations were set up in Britain to defend animal research: The Physiological Society was formed in 1876 to give physiologists &quot;mutual benefit and protection&quot;, the Association for the Advancement of Medicine by Research was formed in 1882 and focused on policy-making, and the Research Defence Society (now Understanding Animal Research) was formed in 1908 &quot;to make known the facts as to experiments on animals in this country; the immense importance to the welfare of mankind of such experiments and the great saving of human life and health directly attributable to them&quot;.

Opposition to the use of animals in medical research first arose in the United States during the 1860s, when Henry Bergh founded the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), with America&#x27;s first specifically anti-vivisection organization being the American AntiVivisection Society (AAVS), founded in 1883. Antivivisectionists of the era generally believed the spread of mercy was the great cause of civilization, and vivisection was cruel. However, in the USA the antivivisectionists&#x27; efforts were defeated in every legislature, overwhelmed by the superior organization and influence of the medical community. Overall, this movement had little legislative success until the passing of the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act, in 1966.

Real progress in thinking about animal rights build on the &quot;theory of justice&quot; (1971) by the philosopher John Rawls and work on ethics by philosopher Peter Singer.

==Alternatives==

Most scientists and governments state that animal testing should cause as little suffering to animals as possible, and that animal tests should only be performed where necessary.）The &quot;Three Rs&quot; are guiding principles for the use of animals in research in most countries. Whilst replacement of animals, i.e. alternatives to animal testing, is one of the principles, their scope is much broader. Although such principles have been welcomed as a step forwards by some animal welfare groups, they have also been criticized as both outdated by current research, and of little practical effect in improving animal welfare. The scientists and engineers at Harvard&#x27;s Wyss Institute have created &quot;organs-on-a-chip&quot;, including the &quot;lung-on-a-chip&quot; and &quot;gut-on-a-chip&quot;. Researchers at cellasys in Germany developed a &quot;skin-on-a-chip&quot;. These tiny devices contain human cells in a 3-dimensional system that mimics human organs. The chips can be used instead of animals in &quot;in vitro&quot; disease research, drug testing, and toxicity testing. Researchers have also begun using 3-D bioprinters to create human tissues for &quot;in vitro&quot; testing.

Another non-animal research method is &quot;in silico&quot; or computer simulation and mathematical modeling which seeks to investigate and ultimately predict toxicity and drug effects on humans without using animals. This is done by investigating test compounds on a molecular level using recent advances in technological capabilities with the ultimate goal of creating treatments unique to each patient. Microdosing is another alternative to the use of animals in experimentation. Microdosing is a process whereby volunteers are administered a small dose of a test compound allowing researchers to investigate its pharmacological affects without harming the volunteers. Microdosing can replace the use of animals in pre-clinical drug screening and can reduce the number of animals used in safety and toxicity testing. Additional alternative methods include positron emission tomography (PET), which allows scanning of the human brain &quot;in vivo&quot;, and comparative epidemiological studies of disease risk factors among human populations. Simulators and computer programs have also replaced the use of animals in dissection, teaching and training exercises.

Official bodies such as the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Test Methods of the European Commission, the Interagency Coordinating Committee for the Validation of Alternative Methods in the US, ZEBET in Germany, and the Japanese Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods (among others) also promote and disseminate the 3Rs. These bodies are mainly driven by responding to regulatory requirements, such as supporting the cosmetics testing ban in the EU by validating alternative methods. The European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing serves as a liaison between the European Commission and industries. The European Consensus Platform for Alternatives coordinates efforts amongst EU member states. Academic centers also investigate alternatives, including the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing at the Johns Hopkins University and the NC3Rs in the UK.

<text>A panorama (formed from Greek πᾶν &quot;all&quot; + ὅραμα &quot;view&quot;) is any wide-angle view or representation of a physical space, whether in painting, drawing, photography, film, seismic images, or 3D modeling. The word was coined in the 18th century by the English (Irish descent) painter Robert Barker to describe his panoramic paintings of Edinburgh and London. The motion-picture term &quot;panning&quot; is derived from &quot;panorama&quot;.

A panoramic view is also purposed for multimedia, cross-scale applications to an outline overview (from a distance) along and across repositories. This so-called &quot;cognitive panorama&quot; is a panoramic view over, and a combination of, cognitive spaces used to capture the larger scale.

== History ==
The device of the panorama existed in painting, particularly in murals, as early as 20 A.D., in those found in Pompeii, as a means of generating an immersive &quot;panoptic&quot; experience of a vista.

Cartographic experiments during the Enlightenment era preceded European panorama painting and contributed to a formative impulse toward panoramic vision and depiction.

This novel perspective was quickly conveyed to America by Benjamin Franklin who was present for the first manned balloon flight by the Montgolfier brothers in 1783, and by the American-born physician, John Jeffries who had joined French aeronaut Jean Pierre Blanchard on flights over England and the first aerial crossing of the English Channel in 1785.

== As popular spectacle ==
In the mid-19th century, panoramic paintings and models became a very popular way to represent landscapes, topographic views and historical events. Audiences of Europe in this period were thrilled by the aspect of illusion, immersed in a winding 360-degree panorama and given the impression of standing in a new environment. The &quot;panorama&quot; was a 360-degree visual medium patented under the title &quot;Apparatus for Exhibiting Pictures&quot; by the artist Robert Barker in 1787. The earliest that the word &quot;panorama&quot; appeared in print was on June 11, 1791, in the British newspaper &quot;The Morning Chronicle&quot;, referring to this visual spectacle. Barker created a painting, shown on a cylindrical surface and viewed from the inside, giving viewers a vantage point encompassing the entire circle of the horizon, rendering the original scene with high fidelity. The inaugural exhibition, a &quot;View of Edinburgh&quot; (specifically the view from the summit of Calton Hill), was first shown in that city in 1788, then transported to London in 1789. By 1793, Barker had built &quot;The Panorama&quot; rotunda at the center of London&#x27;s entertainment district in Leicester Square, where it remained attracting visitors for 70 years, then closing in 1863, before being converted into the church of Notre Dame de France.
Inventor Sir Francis Ronalds developed a machine to remove errors in perspective that were created when a sequence of planar sketches was combined into a cylinder. It also projected the cylindrical drawing onto the wall of the rotunda at much larger scale to enable its accurate painting. The apparatus was exhibited at the Royal Polytechnic Institution in the early 1840s.

Large scale installations enhance the illusion for an audience of being surrounded with a real landscape. The Bourbaki Panorama in Lucerne, Switzerland was created by Edouard Castres in 1881. The painting measures about 10 metres in height with a circumference of 112 meters. In the same year of 1881, the Dutch marine painter Hendrik Willem Mesdag created and established the Panorama Mesdag of The Hague, Netherlands, a cylindrical painting more than 14 metres high and roughly 40 meters in diameter (120 meters in circumference). In the United States of America is the Atlanta Cyclorama, depicting the Civil War Battle of Atlanta. It was first displayed in 1887, and is 42 feet high by 358 feet circumference (13 × 109 metres). Also on a gigantic scale, and still extant, is the Racławice Panorama (1893) located in Wrocław, Poland, which measures 15 × 120 metres. In addition to these historical examples, there have been panoramas painted and installed in modern times; prominent among these is the Velaslavasay Panorama in Los Angeles, California (2004).

== Photographs ==

Panoramic photography soon came to displace painting as the most common method for creating wide views. Not long after the introduction of the Daguerreotype in 1839, photographers began assembling multiple images of a view into a single wide image. In the late 19th century, flexible film enabled the construction of panoramic cameras using curved film holders and clockwork drives to rotate the lens in an arc and thus scan an image encompassing almost 180 degrees.
Pinhole cameras of a variety of constructions can be used to make panoramic images. A popular design is the &quot;oatmeal box&quot;, a vertical cylindrical container in which the pinhole is made in one side and the film or photographic paper is wrapped around the inside wall opposite, and extending almost right to the edge of, the pinhole. This generates an egg-shaped image with more than 180° view.

Popular in the 1970s and 1980s, but now superseded by digital presentation software, Multi-image (also known as multi-image slide presentations, slide shows or diaporamas) 35mm slide projections onto one or more screens characteristically lent themselves to the wide screen panorama. They could run autonomously with silent synchronization pulses to control projector advance and fades, recorded beside an audio voice-over or music track. Precisely overlapping slides placed in slide mounts with soft-edge density masks would merge seamlessly on the screen to create the panorama. Cutting and dissolving between sequential images generated animation effects in the panorama format.


A vertical panorama or vertorama is a panorama with an upright orientation instead of a horizontal. It is created using the same techniques as when making a horizontal panorama.

=== VR photographs ===

Digital photography of the late twentieth century greatly simplified this assembly process, which is now known as &quot;image stitching&quot;. Such stitched images may even be fashioned into forms of virtual reality movies, using technologies such as QuickTime VR, Flash, Java, or even JavaScript. A rotating line camera such as the Panoscan allows the capture of high resolution panoramic images and eliminates the need for image stitching, but immersive &quot;spherical&quot; panorama movies (that incorporate a full 180° vertical viewing angle as well as 360° around) must be made by stitching multiple images. Stitching images together can be used to create extremely high resolution gigapixel panoramic images.

== Motion picture ==

On rare occasions, 360° panoramic movies have been constructed for specially designed display spaces—typically at theme parks, world&#x27;s fairs, and museums. Starting in 1955, Disney has created 360° theaters for its parks and the Swiss Transport Museum in Lucerne, Switzerland, features a theatre that is a large cylindrical space with an arrangement of screens whose bottom is several metres above the floor. Panoramic systems that are less than 360° around also exist. For example, Cinerama used a very wide curved screen, with three synchronized projectors, and IMAX Dome / OMNIMAX movies are projected on a dome above the spectators.

== Non-photographic representations ==

Panoramic representation can be generated from digital elevation models such as SRTM. In these diagrams, a panorama from any given point can be generated and imaged from the data.

<doc id="175603" wikidata="Q3083172" url="?curid=175603" title="Monopropellant">
<text>Monopropellants are propellants consisting of chemicals that release energy through exothermic chemical decomposition. The molecular bond energy of the monopropellant is released usually through use of a catalyst. This can be contrasted with bipropellants that release energy through the chemical reaction between an oxidizer and a fuel. While stable under defined storage conditions, monopropellants decompose very rapidly under certain other conditions to produce a large volume of its own energetic (hot) gases for the performance of mechanical work. Although solid s such as nitrocellulose, the most commonly used propellant in firearms, could be thought of as monopropellants, the term is usually reserved for liquids in engineering literature.

==Uses==
The most common use of monopropellants is in low-impulse monopropellant rocket motors, such as reaction control thrusters, the usual propellant being hydrazine which is generally decomposed by exposure to an iridium catalyst bed (the hydrazine is pre-heated to keep the reactant liquid). This decomposition produces the desired jet of hot gas and thus thrust. Hydrogen peroxide has been used as a power source for propellant tank pumps in rockets like the German WWII V-2 and the American Redstone. The hydrogen peroxide is passed through a platinum catalyst mesh, or comes in contact with manganese dioxide impregnated ceramic beads, or Z-Stoff permanganate solution is co-injected, which causes hydrogen peroxide to decompose into hot steam and oxygen.

Monopropellants are also used in some air-independent propulsion systems (AIP) to &quot;fuel&quot; reciprocating or turbine engines in environments where free oxygen is unavailable. Weapons intended primarily for combat between nuclear-powered submarines generally fall into this category. The most commonly used propellant in this case is stabilized propylene glycol dinitrate (PGDN), often referred to as &quot;Otto fuel&quot;. A potential future use for monopropellants not directly related to propulsion is in compact, high-intensity powerplants for aquatic or exoatmospheric environments.

==Research in brief ==
Much work was done in the US in the 1950s and 1960s to attempt to find better and more energetic monopropellants. For the most part, researchers came to the conclusion that any single substance that contained enough energy to compete with bipropellants would be too unstable to handle safely under practical conditions. With new materials, control systems and requirements for high-performance thrusters, engineers are currently re-examining this assumption.

Many partially nitrated alcohol esters are suitable for use as monopropellants. &quot;Trimethylene glycol dinitrate&quot; or 1,3-propanediol dinitrate is isomeric with PGDN, and produced as a fractional byproduct in all but the most exacting laboratory conditions; the marginally lower specific gravity (and thus energy density) of this compound argues against its use, but the minor differences in chemistry may prove useful in the future.

The related &quot;dinitrodiglycol&quot;, more properly termed diethylene glycol dinitrate in modern notation, was widely used in World War 2 Germany, both alone as a liquid monopropellant and colloidal with nitrocellulose as a solid propellant. The otherwise desirable characteristics of this compound; it is quite stable, easy to manufacture, and has a very high energy density; are marred by a high freeze point (-11.5 deg. C) and pronounced thermal expansion, both being problematic in spacecraft. &quot;Dinitrochlorohydrin&quot; and &quot;tetranitrodiglycerin&quot; are also likely candidates, though no current use is known. The polynitrates of long chain and aromatic hydrocarbons are invariably room temperature solids, but many are soluble in simple alcohols or ethers in high proportion, and may be useful in this state.

Hydrazine, ethylene oxide, hydrogen peroxide (especially in its German World War II form as &quot;T-Stoff&quot;), and nitromethane are common rocket monopropellants. As noted the specific impulse of monopropellants is lower than bipropellants and can be found with the Air Force Chemical Equilibrium Specific Impulse Code tool.

One newer monopropellant under development is nitrous oxide, both neat and in the form of nitrous oxide fuel blends. Nitrous oxide offers the advantages of being self-pressurizing and of being relatively non-toxic, with a specific impulse intermediate between hydrogen peroxide and hydrazine. Nitrous oxide generates oxygen upon decomposition, and it is possible to blend it with fuels to form a monopropellant mixture with a specific impulse up to 325 s, comparable to hypergolic bipropellants. In 2018 a new precious metal catalyst was invented for use with nitrous oxide -  rhodium oxide on alumina spheres – which is more stable at higher temperatures than pure rhodium or iridium. 

Direct comparison of physical properties, performance, cost, storability, toxicity, storage requirements and accidental release measures for hydrogen peroxide, hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN), hydrazine and various cold gas monopropellants shows that hydrazine is the highest performing in terms of specific impulse. However, hydrazine is also the most expensive and toxic. In addition HAN and hydrogen peroxide have the highest density impulse (total impulse per given unit volume).

<text>The Melissa virus is a mass-mailing macro virus released on or around March 26, 1999. It targets Microsoft Word and Outlook-based systems and created considerable network traffic. The virus infects computers via email; the email is titled &quot;Important Message From,&quot; followed by the current username. Upon clicking the message, the body reads, &quot;Here&#x27;s that document you asked for. Don&#x27;t show anyone else ;).&quot; Attached is a Word document titled &quot;list.doc,&quot; containing a list of pornographic sites and accompanying logins for each. It then mass-mails itself to the first fifty people in the user&#x27;s contact list and disables multiple safeguard features on Microsoft Word and Microsoft Outlook.

== Description ==
The virus was released on March 26, 1999, by David L. Smith.
Smith used a hijacked AOL account to post the virus onto an Internet newsgroup called &quot;alt.sex.&quot; It soon ended up on similar sex groups and pornographic sites before spreading to corporate networks. However, the virus itself was credited to &quot;Kwyjibo&quot;, a macro virus writer for &quot;VicodinS&quot; and &quot;ALT-F11&quot;, by comparing Microsoft Word documents with the same globally unique identifier. This method was also used to trace the virus back to Smith.

The &quot;list.doc&quot; file contains a Visual Basic script that copies the infected file into a template file used by Word for custom settings and default macros. If the recipient opens the attachment, the infected file will be read to computer storage. The virus then creates an Outlook object, reads the first 50 names in each Outlook Global Address Book, and sends a copy of itself to the addresses read. Melissa works on Microsoft Word 97, Microsoft Word 2000 and Microsoft Outlook 97 or 98 email clients. Microsoft Outlook is not needed to receive the virus in email, but it is unable to spread via other emails without it.

A second payload occurred when the current minute matches the day when it is being launched, where the quote &quot;Twenty-two points, plus triple-word-score, plus 50 points for using all my letters. Game&#x27;s over. I&#x27;m outta here.&quot; is inserted into open Microsoft Word documents. This, and the Kwyjibo alias used in the macro script, both derive from an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Bart the Genius&quot;.

=== Impact ===
The virus slowed down email systems due to overloading Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange servers with emails. Major organizations impacted included Microsoft, Intel Corp, and the United States Marine Corps. The Computer Emergency Response Team, a Pentagon-financed security service at Carnegie Mellon University, reported 250 organizations called regarding the virus, indicating at least 100,000 workplace computers were infected, although the number is believed to be higher. An estimated one million email accounts were hijacked by the virus. The virus was able to be contained within a few days, although it took longer to remove it from infected systems entirely. At the time, it was the fastest spreading email worm.

== Arrest ==
On April 1, 1999, Smith was arrested in New Jersey due to a tip from AOL and a collaborative effort involving the FBI, the New Jersey State Police, Monmouth Internet, a Swedish computer scientist, and others. Smith was accused of causing US$80 million worth of damages by disrupting personal computers and computer networks in business and government.

On December 10, 1999, Smith pleaded guilty to a second-degree charge of computer theft and a federal charge of damaging a computer program due to releasing the virus.

On May 1, 2002, he was sentenced to 20 months in federal prison and fined USD $5,000.

<text>Critical Mass is a form of direct action in which people travel as a group on bicycles at a set location and time. The idea is for people to group together to make it safe for each other to ride bicycles through their streets, based on the old adage: &quot;there&#x27;s safety in numbers&quot;.

Critical Mass events highlight the numbers of people who want to use their bicycle on the streets, but are usually unable to do so without risking their safety. They are a call to action to councils, governments and road planners to properly and thoughtfully design in the safety of all road users, including those who would prefer to walk and cycle, instead of prioritising motor traffic above all else.

The event originated in 1992 in San Francisco (typically held on the last Friday of every month); by the end of 2003, the event was being held in over 300 cities around the world.

Critical Mass has been described as &quot;monthly political-protest rides&quot;, and characterized as being part of a social movement. It has been described as a &quot;monthly protest by cyclists reclaiming the streets.&quot; Participants have insisted that these events should be viewed as &quot;celebrations&quot; and spontaneous gatherings, and not as protests or organized demonstrations. This stance allows Critical Mass to argue a legal position that its events can occur without advance notification of local police. Though they are sometimes described as political, they are not necessarily.

== History ==
Critical Mass-like bicycle tours with hundreds of participants took place in Stockholm, Sweden in the early 1970s. But the first ride within the present wave took place on Friday, September 25, 1992, at 6 pm in San Francisco. At that time, the event was known as &quot;Commute Clot&quot; and was composed of a couple of dozen cyclists who had received flyers on Market Street.

Shortly after this, some participants in that ride went to a local bicycle shop for a screening of Ted White&#x27;s documentary &quot;Return of the Scorcher&quot;, about bicycle culture in the Netherlands and China in comparison with that of the United States. In that film, American human-powered vehicle and pedicab designer George Bliss noted that, in China, both motorists and bicyclists had an &quot;understood&quot; method of negotiating intersections without signals. Traffic would queue up at these intersections until the backlog reached a &quot;critical mass&quot;, at which point that mass would move through the intersection. This term from the footage of the movie, was applied to the name of the ride, and the name caught on, replacing &quot;Commute Clot&quot; by the time of the second event.

== Organization and tactics ==

Critical Mass has a decentralized (rather than hierarchical) structure. Critical Mass is sometimes called an &quot;organized coincidence&quot;, with no leadership or membership. The routes of some rides are decided spontaneously by whoever is currently at the front of the ride, while others are decided prior to the ride by a popular vote of suggested routes often drawn up on photocopied fliers. The term &quot;xerocracy&quot; was coined to describe a process by which the route for a Critical Mass can be decided: anyone who has an opinion makes their own map and distributes it to the cyclists participating in the Mass. Still other rides decide the route by consensus. The disorganized nature of the event allows it to largely escape clampdown by authorities who may view the rides as forms of parades or organized protest. Additionally, the movement is free from the structural costs associated with a centralized, hierarchical organization. In order for the event to function, the only requirement is a sufficient turn-out to create a &quot;critical mass&quot; of riders dense enough to occupy a piece of road to the exclusion of drivers of motorized vehicles. Authorities in New York, California and Oregon have expressed concern with the difficulty of coordinating with the riders, due to the lack of leadership.

Critical Mass rides vary greatly in many respects, including frequency and number of participants. For example, many small cities have monthly Critical Mass rides with fewer than twenty riders which offer safety in numbers to cyclists in those locales, while on the opposite extreme, in what have been the largest events using the name Critical Mass, cyclists in Budapest, Hungary hold only two rides each year on April 22 (Earth Day) and September 22 (International Car Free Day). The &quot;Budapest style&quot; attracts tens of thousands of riders. The April 20, 2008, Budapest ride participation was estimated at 80,000 riders. In Vienna, close to Budapest, a Critical Mass Ride has been held every month since 2006 and attracts up to 1,000 or more riders.

In the Critical Mass practice of &quot;corking&quot;, a rider breaks away from the group to block the side streets of an intersection as the mass crosses. This prevents traffic travelling through the intersection on a green signal and allows the riders to ride through red lights. This both contains cross-traffic while the mass passes and protects the mass from splitting or from drivers who might attempt to pass through the mass.

== Other bicycling groups ==

=== Similar organizations and movements ===
The Critical Mass rides have inspired a number of other bicycle movements, that range from political movements to the &quot;Critical Tits&quot; ride during the yearly Burning Man festival.
In Chicago, a movement has grown out of the Critical Mass community to promote winter cycling via the Bikewinter campaign. The extensive news coverage of San Francisco&#x27;s July 1997 ride spawned an international celebration of bicycling, called Bike Summer. Kidical Mass originated in Oregon, and encourages bicycle riding for children and families. The movement gained momentum in North America and Europe and set a record in September 2019, when 1100 riders took part in Dortmund, Germany. &quot;Critical Sass&quot; was an all-female version of the ride in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, that took place the second Friday of every month. The Tweed Run (along with various other vintage bike rides) is a well dressed mass which takes place annually in a number of cities across the world. Examples of Critical Mass rides for political movements includes the Free Tibet Rides (May 2008): Free Tibet Critical Mass in Columbia, Missouri, &quot;Tibetan Freedom Bike Rally&quot; in San Francisco (Aug 2008), and in &quot;Bike Ride for Tibet&quot; in London (Aug 2008).

San Jose is the home to San Jose Bike Party. Bike Party rides on the third Friday of the month with a different starting point and route each time. Rides are typically 15–25 miles in length and usually 1000-2000 riders in Summer. The ride aims to build a community of cyclists and prove that bicycles can co-exist with cars. It is different than Critical Mass in that it rides after rush hour and obeys all traffic laws and has a pre-determined route.

San Luis Obispo, California, is the home of the &quot;Bikes are happening...&quot; meetup. Bikes are happening... starts at Mission Plaza at 9:30 pm on the first Thursday of the month. The ride consists of a continuous half mile loop through downtown San Luis Obispo. Since there is no permit for the ride, riders are asked to follow three rules: have fun, respect the community, and obey all traffic laws.

In Portland, Oregon a tactic called a &quot;bike swarm&quot; has been used by Occupy Wall Street protesters to separate marching protesters from police.

A huge bicycle demonstration is the &quot;Fahrrad-Sternfahrt&quot; in Berlin, Germany, since 1976. Each year in June and usually have 150.000–250.000 riders. Together the 19 rides are more than 600 miles long including two sections of motorway.

=== Critical Manners ===
In San Francisco, an event known as &quot;Critical Manners&quot; was created as a response to Critical Mass. Critical Manners rides through the city on the second Friday of the month, with riders encouraged to obey all traffic laws such as stopping at red lights and signaling. Tucson, Arizona holds the Tuesday Night Community Bike Ride as their alternative to Critical Mass. The weekly ride encourages bicycle commuting and motor vehicle awareness in a peaceful and friendly way.

In 2007 there were conversations about starting Critical Manners in Portland, Oregon. According to the Critical Mass book, a similar project known as Courteous Mass is described as &quot;an alternative to Critical Mass.&quot;

An alternative ride named RideCivil formed in Seattle in late 2007. Rides are on the second Friday of every month, and focus on encouraging civility between motorists, pedestrians and cyclists.

The Mobile Social is an alternative ride in Atlanta sponsored by the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition. Rides start on 2nd Thursday of every month, meeting at Woodruff Park in downtown Atlanta and a focus on promoting local small business and cycling for commuting, social and civic engagement.

On June 12, 2009, an Indianapolis Critical Manners ride called &quot;Courteous Mass&quot; was launched but is no longer active as of 2016.

On August 14, 2009, there was a Critical Manners ride in Vancouver, British Columbia. The ride consisted of between 70 and 100 cyclists riding through the downtown core, making all attempts to follow the rules of the road (stopping at red lights / stop signs, using hand signals to turn, using the right-most lane or bike lane when applicable). The event generated some coverage in the local media and was generally deemed a success by the participants, although there were some criticisms. The ride only survived one outing.

In Kathmandu, Nepal, it has been organised since April 2013. Cyclists gather at Kathmandu Durbar Square, Basantapur and ride round the city before grouping together again. Sometimes there are people organizing awareness programmes in this gathering. People who really love cycling and feel awareness about own health, environment they doing Critical Mass Gathering even after the heavy Nepal Earthquake 2015 with slogan &quot;Quake or Shake, Sunny or Rainy, we have to flow with time for next smile...&quot;

== Conflicts involving Critical Mass ==

Critical Mass rides have generated controversy and public opposition. The group has often protested in high-profile events, ranging from major political events to the Olympics. Some critics claim that Critical Mass is a deliberate attempt to obstruct traffic and disrupt normal city functions, asserting that individuals taking part refuse to obey traffic laws.

Some bicycling advocacy groups have expressed concern that the nature of Critical Mass and altercations with motorists could weaken public support for cyclists. Though it does not condone incidents of violence and rudeness, the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition credits Critical Mass with spotlighting bicycle issues and aiding their efforts in advocating for cyclists.

<doc id="175607" wikidata="Q1659515" url="?curid=175607" title="Photon mapping">
<text>In computer graphics, photon mapping is a two-pass global illumination rendering algorithm developed by Henrik Wann Jensen between 1995 and 2001 that approximately solves the rendering equation for integrating light radiance at a given point in space. Rays from the light source (like photons) and rays from the camera are traced independently until some termination criterion is met, then they are connected in a second step to produce a radiance value. The algorithm is used to realistically simulate the interaction of light with different types of objects (similar to other photorealistic rendering techniques). Specifically, it is capable of simulating the refraction of light through a transparent substance such as glass or water (including caustics), diffuse interreflection between illuminated objects, the subsurface scattering of light in translucent materials, and some of the effects caused by particulate matter such as smoke or water vapor. Photon mapping can also be extended to more accurate simulations of light, such as spectral rendering. Progressive photon mapping (PPM) starts with ray tracing and then adds more and more photon mapping passes to provide a progressively more accurate render.

Unlike path tracing, bidirectional path tracing, volumetric path tracing, and Metropolis light transport, photon mapping is a &quot;biased&quot; rendering algorithm, which means that averaging infinitely many renders of the same scene using this method does not converge to a correct solution to the rendering equation. However, it is a consistent method, and the accuracy of a render can be increased by increasing the number of photons. As the number of photons approaches infinity, a render will get closer and closer to the solution of the rendering equation.

==Effects==

===Caustics===

Light refracted or reflected causes patterns called caustics, usually visible as concentrated patches of light on nearby surfaces. For example, as light rays pass through a wine glass sitting on a table, they are refracted and patterns of light are visible on the table. Photon mapping can trace the paths of individual photons to model where these concentrated patches of light will appear.

===Diffuse interreflection===

Diffuse interreflection is apparent when light from one diffuse object is reflected onto another. Photon mapping is particularly adept at handling this effect because the algorithm reflects photons from one surface to another based on that surface&#x27;s bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), and thus light from one object striking another is a natural result of the method. Diffuse interreflection was first modeled using radiosity solutions. Photon mapping differs though in that it separates the light transport from the nature of the geometry in the scene. Color bleed is an example of diffuse interreflection.

===Subsurface scattering===

Subsurface scattering is the effect evident when light enters a material and is scattered before being absorbed or reflected in a different direction. Subsurface scattering can accurately be modeled using photon mapping. This was the original way Jensen implemented it; however, the method becomes slow for highly scattering materials, and bidirectional surface scattering reflectance distribution functions (BSSRDFs) are more efficient in these situations.

==Usage==

===Construction of the photon map (1st pass)===

With photon mapping, light packets called &quot;photons&quot; are sent out into the scene from the light sources. Whenever a photon intersects with a surface, the intersection point and incoming direction are stored in a cache called the &quot;photon map&quot;. Typically, two photon maps are created for a scene: one especially for caustics and a global one for other light. After intersecting the surface, a probability for either reflecting, absorbing, or transmitting/refracting is given by the material. A Monte Carlo method called &quot;Russian roulette&quot; is used to choose one of these actions. If the photon is absorbed, no new direction is given, and tracing for that photon ends. If the photon reflects, the surface&#x27;s bidirectional reflectance distribution function is used to determine the ratio of reflected radiance. Finally, if the photon is transmitting, a function for its direction is given depending upon the nature of the transmission.

Once the photon map is constructed (or during construction), it is typically arranged in a manner that is optimal for the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, as photon look-up time depends on the spatial distribution of the photons. Jensen advocates the usage of kd-trees. The photon map is then stored on disk or in memory for later usage.

===Rendering (2nd pass)===

In this step of the algorithm, the photon map created in the first pass is used to estimate the radiance of every pixel of the output image. For each pixel, the scene is ray traced until the closest surface of intersection is found.

At this point, the rendering equation is used to calculate the surface radiance leaving the point of intersection in the direction of the ray that struck it. To facilitate efficiency, the equation is decomposed into four separate factors: direct illumination, specular reflection, caustics, and soft indirect illumination.

For an accurate estimate of direct illumination, a ray is traced from the point of intersection to each light source. As long as a ray does not intersect another object, the light source is used to calculate the direct illumination. For an approximate estimate of indirect illumination, the photon map is used to calculate the radiance contribution.

Specular reflection can be, in most cases, calculated using ray tracing procedures (as it handles reflections well).

The contribution to the surface radiance from caustics is calculated using the caustics photon map directly. The number of photons in this map must be sufficiently large, as the map is the only source for caustics information in the scene.

For soft indirect illumination, radiance is calculated using the photon map directly. This contribution, however, does not need to be as accurate as the caustics contribution and thus uses the global photon map.

====Calculating radiance using the photon map====

In order to calculate surface radiance at an intersection point, one of the cached photon maps is used. The steps are:

# Gather the N nearest photons using the nearest neighbor search function on the photon map.
# Let S be the sphere that contains these N photons.
# For each photon, divide the amount of flux (real photons) that the photon represents by the area of S and multiply by the BRDF applied to that photon.
# The sum of those results for each photon represents total surface radiance returned by the surface intersection in the direction of the ray that struck it.

===Optimizations===
* To avoid emitting unneeded photons, the initial direction of the outgoing photons is often constrained. Instead of simply sending out photons in random directions, they are sent in the direction of a known object that is a desired photon manipulator to either focus or diffuse the light. There are many other refinements that can be made to the algorithm: for example, choosing the number of photons to send, and where and in what pattern to send them. It would seem that emitting more photons in a specific direction would cause a higher density of photons to be stored in the photon map around the position where the photons hit, and thus measuring this density would give an inaccurate value for irradiance. This is true; however, the algorithm used to compute radiance does &quot;not&quot; depend on irradiance estimates.
* For soft indirect illumination, if the surface is Lambertian, then a technique known as irradiance caching may be used to interpolate values from previous calculations.
* To avoid unnecessary collision testing in direct illumination, shadow photons can be used. During the photon mapping process, when a photon strikes a surface, in addition to the usual operations performed, a shadow photon is emitted in the same direction the original photon came from that goes all the way through the object. The next object it collides with causes a shadow photon to be stored in the photon map. Then during the direct illumination calculation, instead of sending out a ray from the surface to the light that tests collisions with objects, the photon map is queried for shadow photons. If none are present, then the object has a clear line of sight to the light source and additional calculations can be avoided.
* To optimize image quality, particularly of caustics, Jensen recommends use of a cone filter. Essentially, the filter gives weight to photons&#x27; contributions to radiance depending on how far they are from ray-surface intersections. This can produce sharper images.
* Image space photon mapping achieves real-time performance by computing the first and last scattering using a GPU rasterizer.

===Variations===
* Although photon mapping was designed to work primarily with ray tracers, it can also be extended for use with scanline renderers.

<text>In mathematics, the Cayley–Dickson construction, sometimes also known as the Cayley–Dickson process or the Cayley–Dickson procedure produces a sequence of algebras over the field of real numbers, each with twice the dimension of the previous one. It is named after Arthur Cayley and Leonard Eugene Dickson. The algebras produced by this process are known as Cayley–Dickson algebras, for example complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions. These examples are useful composition algebras frequently applied in mathematical physics.

The Cayley–Dickson construction defines a new algebra as a Cartesian product of an algebra with itself, with multiplication defined in a specific way (different from the componentwise multiplication) and an involution known as &quot;conjugation&quot;. The product of an element and its conjugate (or sometimes the square root of this product) is called the norm.

The symmetries of the real field disappear as the Cayley–Dickson construction is repeatedly applied: first losing order, then commutativity of multiplication, associativity of multiplication, and finally alternativity.

More generally, the Cayley–Dickson construction takes any algebra with involution to another algebra with involution of twice the dimension.

Hurwitz&#x27;s theorem (composition algebras) states that the reals, complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions are the only (normed) division algebras (over the real numbers).

==Synopsis==

The Cayley–Dickson construction is due to Leonard Dickson in 1919 showing how the octonions can be constructed as a two-dimensional algebra over quaternions. In fact, starting with a field &quot;F&quot;, the construction yields a sequence of &quot;F&quot;-algebras of dimension 2&quot;n&quot;. For &quot;n&quot; = 2 it is an associative algebra called a quaternion algebra, and for &quot;n&quot; = 3 it is an alternative algebra called an octonion algebra. These instances &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2 and 3 produce composition algebras as shown below. 

The case &quot;n&quot; = 1 starts with elements (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) in &quot;F&quot; × &quot;F&quot; and defines the conjugate (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;)* to be (&quot;a&quot;*, –&quot;b&quot;) where &quot;a&quot;* = &quot;a&quot; in case &quot;n&quot; = 1, and subsequently determined by the formula. The essence of the &quot;F&quot;-algebra lies in the definition of the product of two elements (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) and (&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;):
:formula_1
Proposition 1: For formula_2 and formula_3 the conjugate of the product is formula_4
:proof: formula_5
Proposition 2: If the &quot;F&quot;-algebra is associative and formula_6,then formula_7
:proof: formula_8 + terms that cancel by the associative property.

==Stages in construction of real algebras==

Details of the construction of the classical real algebras are as follows:
=== Complex numbers as ordered pairs ===

The complex numbers can be written as ordered pairs of real numbers and , with the addition operator being component-wise and with multiplication defined by

: formula_9

A complex number whose second component is zero is associated with a real number: the complex number is associated with the real number .

The complex conjugate of is given by

: formula_10

since is a real number and is its own conjugate.

The conjugate has the property that

: formula_11

which is a non-negative real number. In this way, conjugation defines a &quot;norm&quot;, making the complex numbers a normed vector space over the real numbers: the norm of a complex number  is

: formula_12

Furthermore, for any non-zero complex number , conjugation gives a multiplicative inverse,

: formula_13

As a complex number consists of two independent real numbers, they form a two-dimensional vector space over the real numbers.

Besides being of higher dimension, the complex numbers can be said to lack one algebraic property of the real numbers: a real number is its own conjugate.

=== Quaternions ===

The next step in the construction is to generalize the multiplication and conjugation operations.

Form ordered pairs of complex numbers and , with multiplication defined by

: formula_14

Slight variations on this formula are possible; the resulting constructions will yield structures identical up to the signs of bases.

The order of the factors seems odd now, but will be important in the next step.

Define the conjugate of by

: formula_15

These operators are direct extensions of their complex analogs: if and are taken from the real subset of complex numbers, the appearance of the conjugate in the formulas has no effect, so the operators are the same as those for the complex numbers.

The product of a nonzero element with its conjugate is a non-negative real number:

: formula_16

As before, the conjugate thus yields a norm and an inverse for any such ordered pair. So in the sense we explained above, these pairs constitute an algebra something like the real numbers. They are the quaternions, named by Hamilton in 1843.

As a quaternion consists of two independent complex numbers, they form a four-dimensional vector space over the real numbers.

The multiplication of quaternions is not quite like the multiplication of real numbers, though; it is not commutative – that is, if and are quaternions, it is not always true that .

=== Octonions ===

All the steps to create further algebras are the same from octonions onwards.

This time, form ordered pairs of quaternions and , with multiplication and conjugation defined exactly as for the quaternions:
: formula_17

Note, however, that because the quaternions are not commutative, the order of the factors in the multiplication formula becomes important—if the last factor in the multiplication formula were rather than
, the formula for multiplication of an element by its conjugate would not yield a real number.

For exactly the same reasons as before, the conjugation operator yields a norm and a multiplicative inverse of any nonzero element.

This algebra was discovered by John T. Graves in 1843, and is called the octonions or the &quot;Cayley numbers&quot;.

As an octonion consists of two independent quaternions, they form an eight-dimensional vector space over the real numbers.

The multiplication of octonions is even stranger than that of quaternions; besides being non-commutative, it is not associative – that is, if , , and are octonions, it is not always true that .

For the reason of this non-associativity, octonions have no matrix representation.

=== Sedenions ===

The algebra immediately following the octonions is called the sedenions. It retains the algebraic property of power associativity, meaning that if is a sedenion, , but loses the property of being an alternative algebra and hence cannot be a composition algebra.

=== Trigintaduonions ===

The algebra immediately following the sedenions is the trigintaduonions, which form a 32-dimensional algebra over the real numbers and can be represented by blackboard bold formula_18.

=== Further algebras ===
The Cayley–Dickson construction can be carried on &quot;ad infinitum&quot;, at each step producing a power-associative algebra whose dimension is double that of the algebra of the preceding step. These include the 64-dimensional sexagintaquatronions (or 64-nions), the 128-dimensional centumduodetrigintanions (or 128-nions), the 256-dimensional ducentiquinquagintasexions (or 256-nions), and &quot;ad infinitum&quot;. All the algebras generated in this way over a field are &quot;quadratic&quot;: that is, each element satisfies a quadratic equation with coefficients from the field.

In 1954, R. D. Schafer proved that the algebras generated by the Cayley–Dickson process over a field satisfy the flexible identity. He also proved that any derivation algebra of a Cayley–Dickson algebra is isomorphic to the derivation algebra of Cayley numbers, a 14-dimensional Lie algebra over .

== Modified Cayley–Dickson construction ==

The Cayley–Dickson construction, starting from the real numbers formula_19, generates the composition algebras formula_20 (the complex numbers), formula_21 (the quaternions), and formula_22 (the octonions). There are also composition algebras whose norm is an isotropic quadratic form, which are obtained through a slight modification, by replacing the minus sign in the definition of the product of ordered pairs with a plus sign, as follows:
formula_23

When this modified construction is applied to formula_19, one obtains the split-complex numbers, which are ring-isomorphic to the direct product formula_25 following that, one obtains the split-quaternions, an associative algebra isomorphic to that of the 2 × 2 real matrices; and the split-octonions, which are isomorphic to . Applying the original Cayley–Dickson construction to the split-complexes also results in the split-quaternions and then the split-octonions.

== General Cayley–Dickson construction ==
 gave a slight generalization, defining the product and involution on for an algebra with involution (with ) to be 
: formula_26
for an additive map that commutes with and left and right multiplication by any element. (Over the reals all choices of are equivalent to −1, 0 or 1.) In this construction, is an algebra with involution, meaning:
* is an abelian group under 
* has a product that is left and right distributive over 
* has an involution , with , , .
The algebra produced by the Cayley–Dickson construction is also an algebra with involution.

 inherits properties from unchanged as follows. 
* If has an identity , then has an identity .
* If has the property that , associate and commute with all elements, then so does . This property implies that any element generates a commutative associative *-algebra, so in particular the algebra is power associative.
Other properties of only induce weaker properties of :
* If is commutative and has trivial involution, then is commutative.
* If is commutative and associative then is associative.
* If is associative and , associate and commute with everything, then is an alternative algebra.

<text>Jean Felix Piccard (January 28, 1884 in Basel, Switzerland – January 28, 1963 in Minneapolis, Minnesota), also known as Jean Piccard, was a Swiss-born American chemist, engineer, professor and high-altitude balloonist. He invented clustered high-altitude balloons, and with his wife Jeannette, the plastic balloon. Piccard&#x27;s inventions and co-inventions are used in balloon flight, aircraft and spacecraft.

==Family==
Piccard and Jeannette Ridlon met at the University of Chicago where he taught and she received her master&#x27;s degree. They married and had three sons, John, Paul and Donald, and also had foster children.

==Stratosphere flight==

Piccard was the co-pilot for his wife Jeannette on the third and final voyage of the &quot;Century of Progress&quot;. The largest balloon in the world was conceived for him to fly at the World&#x27;s Fair in 1933 but was flown there by US Navy pilots who were licensed. After this flight he created the liquid oxygen converter when the liquid failed to vaporize on descent after the cabin doors were open. Piccard developed a frost-free window, that was used on this flight and later by the Navy and Air Force in the B-24 Liberator or B-26 Marauder. He used blasting caps and TNT for releasing the balloon at launch and for remote release of external ballast from inside the sealed cabin. This was the first use of pyrotechnics for remote-controlled actuating devices in aircraft, an unpopular, revolutionary idea at the time. Later his student Robert R. Gilruth, who became the director of the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center, approved and used them in spacecraft.

The July 21st, 1952 issue of The Canberra Times newspaper printed an incorrect front-page article in which Piccard claimed it would be possible for humans to fly to Mars with balloons as early as 1954, if anyone was willing to invest $250,000. Piccard had claimed he would study the light from Mars through a spectroscope to try to find evidence of oxygen and water at a high altitude to ensure his measurements were as precise as possible.

==Plastic balloons==
In 1935 and 1936, to reduce weight and thus enabling a balloon to reach higher altitudes, plastic balloon construction began independently by Max Cosyns in Belgium, Erich Regener in Germany, and Thomas H. Johnson and Jean Piccard, then at the Franklin Institute&#x27;s Bartol Research Foundation in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. Johnson suggested cellophane to Jean Piccard.

Piccard with his wife co-invented the plastic balloon and he designed and on 24 June 1936 flew a cellophane balloon built by his students. The balloon was unmanned, wide, and made of tapered 33-foot (10-meter) gores and one-inch (2.54-cm) 3M Scotch transparent tape. Jean Barnhill, Harold Larson and Lloyd Schumacher cut the gores that fit together like an &quot;orange peel.&quot; Harold Hatlestad built the radio equipment and Robert Silliman built the telemeter that sent temperature and pressure data back. Robert Hatch and Silliman maintained radio contact from a station on the roof of the university armory until the radio&#x27;s battery froze from insufficient insulation. The balloon floated at 50,000 feet, and in ten hours traveled over 600 miles to near Huntsville, Arkansas.

==Cluster balloons==
Developed with John Akerman of the University of Minnesota and piloted by Jean Piccard in 1937 in Rochester, Minnesota, the first multi-celled balloon was called &quot;The Pleiades&quot; and was made of 98 latex rubber balloons. In a letter to Robert Gray of the Dewey and Almy Chemical Co. later published in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Piccard describes how he broke balloons with a hunting knife and revolver to control his descent. A TNT charge released the cluster as he expected but sent burning excelsior down that destroyed the first &quot;Pleiades&quot;. He suggested to Gray that rock wool in place of excelsior would prevent similar accidents in the future.

Balloon research stopped for the most part during World War II.

In February 1946 with Otto C. Winzen, Jean Piccard proposed manned flight to the US Navy using clustered balloons made of thin plastic. In June the Office of Naval Research approved &quot;Project Helios&quot; and that year General Mills and the University of Minnesota contracted to build a cluster of 100 polyethylene balloons for atmospheric research. &quot;Helios&quot; was designed to reach 100,000 feet for ten hours with a payload of instruments.

Jean Piccard helped Winzen design the Skyhook polyethylene balloons that replaced &quot;Project Helios&quot; in 1947. Skyhook balloons were used unmanned for atmospheric research by the Navy and for manned flights by the US Air Force. Later Jean Piccard developed electronics for emptying ballast bags.

Piccard died on January 28, 1963 (his 79th birthday) in Minneapolis.

==Piccard family==
* Jules Piccard (professor of chemistry)
** Auguste Piccard (physicist, aeronaut, balloonist, hydronaut)
*** Jacques Piccard (hydronaut)
**** Bertrand Piccard (aeronaut, balloonist)
** Jean Felix Piccard (organic chemist, aeronaut, and balloonist)
** Jeannette Piccard (wife of Jean Felix) (aeronaut and balloonist)
*** Don Piccard (balloonist)

== Legacy ==
In 1991, Piccard was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum. Gene Roddenberry named the &quot;Star Trek&quot; character Jean-Luc Picard after either Jean or his twin Auguste, and it is implied that the character is a descendant of one of the brothers. The Swiss explorer and environmentalist Bertrand Piccard claims that it was after his great-uncle Jean Piccard.

<doc id="175613" wikidata="Q2661997" url="?curid=175613" title="Hypercomputation">
<text>Hypercomputation or super-Turing computation is a set of hypothetical models of computation that can provide outputs that are not Turing-computable. For example, a machine that could solve the halting problem would be a hypercomputer; so too would one that could correctly evaluate every statement in Peano arithmetic.

The Church–Turing thesis states that any &quot;computable&quot; function that can be computed by a mathematician with a pen and paper using a finite set of simple algorithms, can be computed by a Turing machine. Hypercomputers compute functions that a Turing machine cannot and which are, hence, not computable in the Church–Turing sense.

Technically, the output of a random Turing machine is uncomputable; however, most hypercomputing literature focuses instead on the computation of deterministic, rather than random, uncomputable functions.

==History==
A computational model going beyond Turing machines was introduced by Alan Turing in his 1938 PhD dissertation &quot;Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals&quot;. This paper investigated mathematical systems in which an oracle was available, which could compute a single arbitrary (non-recursive) function from naturals to naturals. He used this device to prove that even in those more powerful systems, undecidability is still present. Turing&#x27;s oracle machines are mathematical abstractions, and are not physically realizable.

==State space==
In a sense, most functions are uncomputable: there are formula_1 computable functions, but there are an uncountable number (formula_2) of possible super-Turing functions.

==Models==
Hypercomputer models range from useful but probably unrealizable (such as Turing&#x27;s original oracle machines), to less-useful random-function generators that are more plausibly &quot;realizable&quot; (such as a random Turing machine).

===Uncomputable inputs or black-box components===

A system granted knowledge of the uncomputable, oracular Chaitin&#x27;s constant (a number with an infinite sequence of digits that encode the solution to the halting problem) as an input can solve a large number of useful undecidable problems; a system granted an uncomputable random-number generator as an input can create random uncomputable functions, but is generally not believed to be able to meaningfully solve &quot;useful&quot; uncomputable functions such as the halting problem. There are an unlimited number of different types of conceivable hypercomputers, including:
*Turing&#x27;s original oracle machines, defined by Turing in 1939.
*A real computer (a sort of idealized analog computer) can perform hypercomputation if physics admits general real variables (not just computable reals), and these are in some way &quot;harnessable&quot; for useful (rather than random) computation. This might require quite bizarre laws of physics (for example, a measurable physical constant with an oracular value, such as Chaitin&#x27;s constant), and would require the ability to measure the real-valued physical value to arbitrary precision, though standard physics makes such arbitrary-precision measurements theoretically infeasible.
**Similarly, a neural net that somehow had Chaitin&#x27;s constant exactly embedded in its weight function would be able to solve the halting problem, but is subject to the same physical difficulties as other models of hypercomputation based on real computation.
*Certain fuzzy logic-based &quot;fuzzy Turing machines&quot; can, by definition, accidentally solve the halting problem, but only because their ability to solve the halting problem is indirectly assumed in the specification of the machine; this tends to be viewed as a &quot;bug&quot; in the original specification of the machines.
**Similarly, a proposed model known as fair nondeterminism can accidentally allow the oracular computation of noncomputable functions, because some such systems, by definition, have the oracular ability to identify reject inputs that would &quot;unfairly&quot; cause a subsystem to run forever.
*Dmytro Taranovsky has proposed a finitistic model of traditionally non-finitistic branches of analysis, built around a Turing machine equipped with a rapidly increasing function as its oracle. By this and more complicated models he was able to give an interpretation of second-order arithmetic. These models require an uncomputable input, such as a physical event-generating process where the interval between events grows at an uncomputably large rate.
**Similarly, one unorthodox interpretation of a model of unbounded nondeterminism posits, by definition, that the length of time required for an &quot;Actor&quot; to settle is fundamentally unknowable, and therefore it cannot be proven, within the model, that it does not take an uncomputably long period of time.

===&quot;Infinite computational steps&quot; models===
In order to work correctly, certain computations by the machines below literally require infinite, rather than merely unlimited but finite, physical space and resources; in contrast, with a Turing machine, any given computation that halts will require only finite physical space and resources.

A Turing machine that can &quot;complete&quot; infinitely many steps in finite time, a feat known as a supertask. Simply being able to run for an unbounded number of steps does not suffice. One mathematical model is the Zeno machine (inspired by Zeno&#x27;s paradox). The Zeno machine performs its first computation step in (say) 1 minute, the second step in ½ minute, the third step in ¼ minute, etc. By summing 1 + ½ + ¼ + ... (a geometric series) we see that the machine performs infinitely many steps in a total of 2 minutes. According to Oron Shagrir, Zeno machines introduce physical paradoxes and its state is logically undefined outside of one-side open period of [0, 2), thus undefined exactly at 2 minutes after beginning of the computation.

It seems natural that the possibility of time travel (existence of closed timelike curves (CTCs)) makes hypercomputation possible by itself. However, this is not so since a CTC does not provide (by itself) the unbounded amount of storage that an infinite computation would require. Nevertheless, there are spacetimes in which the CTC region can be used for relativistic hypercomputation. According to a 1992 paper, a computer operating in a Malament–Hogarth spacetime or in orbit around a rotating black hole could theoretically perform non-Turing computations for an observer inside the black hole. Access to a CTC may allow the rapid solution to PSPACE-complete problems, a complexity class which, while Turing-decidable, is generally considered computationally intractable.

===Quantum models===
Some scholars conjecture that a quantum mechanical system which somehow uses an infinite superposition of states could compute a non-computable function. This is not possible using the standard qubit-model quantum computer, because it is proven that a regular quantum computer is PSPACE-reducible (a quantum computer running in polynomial time can be simulated by a classical computer running in polynomial space).

===&quot;Eventually correct&quot; systems===
Some physically realizable systems will always eventually converge to the correct answer, but have the defect that they will often output an incorrect answer and stick with the incorrect answer for an uncomputably large period of time before eventually going back and correcting the mistake.

In mid 1960s, E Mark Gold and Hilary Putnam independently proposed models of inductive inference (the &quot;limiting recursive functionals&quot; and &quot;trial-and-error predicates&quot;, respectively). These models enable some nonrecursive sets of numbers or languages (including all recursively enumerable sets of languages) to be &quot;learned in the limit&quot;; whereas, by definition, only recursive sets of numbers or languages could be identified by a Turing machine. While the machine will stabilize to the correct answer on any learnable set in some finite time, it can only identify it as correct if it is recursive; otherwise, the correctness is established only by running the machine forever and noting that it never revises its answer. Putnam identified this new interpretation as the class of &quot;empirical&quot; predicates, stating: &quot;if we always &#x27;posit&#x27; that the most recently generated answer is correct, we will make a finite number of mistakes, but we will eventually get the correct answer. (Note, however, that even if we have gotten to the correct answer (the end of the finite sequence) we are never &quot;sure&quot; that we have the correct answer.)&quot; L. K. Schubert&#x27;s 1974 paper &quot;Iterated Limiting Recursion and the Program Minimization Problem&quot; studied the effects of iterating the limiting procedure; this allows any arithmetic predicate to be computed. Schubert wrote, &quot;Intuitively, iterated limiting identification might be regarded as higher-order inductive inference performed collectively by an ever-growing community of lower order inductive inference machines.&quot;

A symbol sequence is &quot;computable in the limit&quot; if there is a finite, possibly non-halting program on a universal Turing machine that incrementally outputs every symbol of the sequence. This includes the dyadic expansion of π and of every other computable real, but still excludes all noncomputable reals. The &#x27;Monotone Turing machines&#x27; traditionally used in description size theory cannot edit their previous outputs; generalized Turing machines, as defined by Jürgen Schmidhuber, can. He defines the constructively describable symbol sequences as those that have a finite, non-halting program running on a generalized Turing machine, such that any output symbol eventually converges; that is, it does not change any more after some finite initial time interval. Due to limitations first exhibited by Kurt Gödel (1931), it may be impossible to predict the convergence time itself by a halting program, otherwise the halting problem could be solved. Schmidhuber () uses this approach to define the set of formally describable or constructively computable universes or constructive theories of everything. Generalized Turing machines can eventually converge to a correct solution of the halting problem by evaluating a Specker sequence.

==Analysis of capabilities==
Many hypercomputation proposals amount to alternative ways to read an oracle or advice function embedded into an otherwise classical machine. Others allow access to some higher level of the arithmetic hierarchy. For example, supertasking Turing machines, under the usual assumptions, would be able to compute any predicate in the truth-table degree containing formula_3 or formula_4. Limiting-recursion, by contrast, can compute any predicate or function in the corresponding Turing degree, which is known to be formula_5. Gold further showed that limiting partial recursion would allow the computation of precisely the formula_6 predicates.

==Criticism==
Martin Davis, in his writings on hypercomputation,
refers to this subject as &quot;a myth&quot; and offers counter-arguments to the
physical realizability of hypercomputation. As for its theory, he argues against
the claims that this is a new field founded in the 1990s. This point of view relies
on the history of computability theory (degrees of unsolvability, computability over
functions, real numbers and ordinals), as also mentioned above.
In his argument, he makes a remark that all of hypercomputation is little more than: &quot;if non-computable inputs are permitted, then non-computable outputs are attainable.&quot;

<text>Factory Records was a Manchester-based British independent record label founded in 1978 by Tony Wilson and Alan Erasmus.

The label featured several important acts on its roster, including Joy Division, New Order, A Certain Ratio, the Durutti Column, Happy Mondays, Northside, and (briefly) Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and James. Factory also ran The Haçienda nightclub, in partnership with New Order.

Factory Records used a creative team (most notably record producer Martin Hannett and graphic designer Peter Saville) which gave the label and the artists recording for it a particular sound and image. The label employed a unique cataloguing system that gave a number not just to its musical releases, but also to various other related miscellany, including artwork, films, living beings, and even Wilson&#x27;s own coffin.

==History==
===&#x27;The Factory&#x27;===
The Factory name was first used for a club in May 1978; the first Factory night was on the 26 May 1978. The club became a Manchester legend in its own right, being known variously as the Russell Club, Caribbean Club, PSV (Public Service Vehicles) Club (so titled as it was originally a social club for bus drivers who worked from the nearby depot) and &#x27;The Factory&#x27;. The ‘Factory’ night at The Russell Club was launched by Alan Erasmus, Tony Wilson, and helped by promoter Alan Wise. As well as attracting numerous touring bands to the area and many upcoming post punk bands, it featured local bands including the Durutti Column (managed at the time by Erasmus and Wilson), Cabaret Voltaire from Sheffield and Joy Division. The club was demolished in 2001. The club was located on the NE corner of the now demolished Hulme Crescents development, on the corner of Royce Rd and Clayburn St (). Peter Saville designed advertising for the club, and in September Factory released an EP of music by acts who had played at the club (the Durutti Column, Joy Division, Cabaret Voltaire and comedian John Dowie) called A Factory Sample.&lt;ref name=&quot;dazeddigital/46236&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===1978 and 1979===
As a follow-on from the successful &#x27;Factory Nights&#x27; held at the Russell Club, Factory Records made their first release, &quot;A Factory Sample&quot;, in January 1979. At that time there was a punk label in Manchester called Rabid Records, run by Tosh Ryan and Martin Hannett. It had several successful acts, including Slaughter &amp; the Dogs (whose tour manager was Rob Gretton), John Cooper Clarke, and Jilted John. After his seminal TV series &quot;So It Goes&quot;, Tony Wilson was interested in the way Rabid Records ran, and was convinced that the real money and power were in album sales. With a lot of discussion, Tony Wilson, Rob Gretton and Alan Erasmus set up Factory Records, with Martin Hannett from Rabid.

In 1978, Wilson compered the new wave afternoon at Deeply Vale Festival. This was actually the fourth live appearance by the fledgling Durutti Column and that afternoon Wilson also introduced an appearance (very early in their career) by the Fall, featuring Mark E. Smith and Marc &quot;Lard&quot; Riley on bass guitar.

 The Factory label set up an office in Erasmus&#x27; home on the first floor of 86 Palatine Road (), and the &quot;Factory Sample&quot; EP was released on 24 December 1978. Singles followed by A Certain Ratio (who would stay with the label) and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (who left for Virgin Records shortly afterwards). The first Factory LP, Joy Division&#x27;s &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot;, was released in June.

===1980s===
In January 1980, &quot;The Return of the Durutti Column&quot; was released, the first in a long series of releases by guitarist Vini Reilly. In May, Joy Division singer Ian Curtis committed suicide shortly before a planned tour of the US. The following month saw Joy Division&#x27;s single &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot; reach the UK top twenty, and their second album &quot;Closer&quot; was released the following month. In late 1980, the remaining members of Joy Division decided to continue as New Order. Factory branched out, with Factory Benelux being run as an independent label in conjunction with Les Disques du Crepuscule, and Factory US organising distribution for the UK label&#x27;s releases in America.

In 1981, Factory and New Order opened a nightclub and preparations were made to convert a Victorian textile factory near the centre of Manchester, which had lately seen service as a motor boat showroom. Hannett left the label, as he had wanted to open a recording studio instead, and subsequently sued for unpaid royalties (the case was settled out of court in 1984). Saville also quit as a partner due to problems with payments, although he continued to work for Factory. Wilson, Erasmus and Gretton formed Factory Communications Ltd.

 The Haçienda (FAC 51) opened in May 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;thevinylfactory/hacienda-opening&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;flashbak/427621&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although successful in terms of attendance, and attracting a lot of praise for Ben Kelly&#x27;s interior design, the club lost large amounts of money in its first few years due largely to the low prices charged for entrance and at the bar, which was markedly cheaper than nearby pubs. Adjusting bar prices failed to help matters as by the mid-1980s crowds were increasingly preferring ecstasy to alcohol. Therefore the Haçienda ended up costing tens of thousands of pounds every month.

In 1983 New Order&#x27;s &quot;Blue Monday&quot; (FAC 73) became an international chart hit. However, the label did not make any money from it since the original sleeve, die-cut and designed to look like a floppy disk, was so costly to make that the label lost 5 pence on every copy they sold. Saville noted that nobody at Factory expected &quot;Blue Monday&quot; to be a commercially successful record at all, so nobody expected the cost to be an issue.

1985 saw the first release by Happy Mondays. New Order and Happy Mondays became the most successful bands on the label, bankrolling a host of other projects. Factory, and the Haçienda, became a cultural hub of the emerging techno and acid house genres and their amalgamation with post-punk guitar music (the &quot;Madchester&quot; scene). 1986 saw Mick Middles&#x27; book &quot;Joy Division to New Order&quot; published by Virgin Books (later being reprinted under the title &quot;Factory&quot;). In 1989 the label extended its reach to fringe punk folk outfit To Hell With Burgundy. Factory also opened a bar (The Dry Bar, FAC 201) and a shop (The Area, FAC 281) in the Northern Quarter of Manchester.

===1990s===
Factory&#x27;s headquarters (FAC 251) on Charles Street, near the Oxford Road BBC building, were opened in September 1990 (prior to which the company was still registered at Alan Erasmus&#x27; flat in Didsbury).

In 1991, Factory suffered two tragedies: the deaths of Martin Hannett and Dave Rowbotham. Hannett had recently re-established a relationship with the label, working with Happy Mondays, and tributes including a compilation album and a festival were organised. Rowbotham was one of the first musicians signed by the label; he was an original member of the Durutti Column and shared the guitar role with Vini Reilly; he was murdered and his body was found in his flat in Burnage. Saville&#x27;s association with Factory was now reduced to simply designing for New Order and their solo projects (the band itself was in suspension, with various members recording as Electronic, Revenge and The Other Two).

By 1992, the label&#x27;s two most successful bands caused the label serious financial trouble. The Happy Mondays were recording their troubled fourth album &quot;Yes Please!&quot; in Barbados, and New Order reportedly spent £400,000 on recording their comeback album &quot;Republic&quot;. London Records were interested in taking over Factory but the deal fell through when it emerged that, due to Factory&#x27;s early practice of eschewing contracts, New Order rather than the label owned New Order&#x27;s back catalogue.

Factory Communications Ltd, the company formed in 1981, declared bankruptcy in November 1992. Many former Factory acts, including New Order, found a new home at London Records.

The Haçienda closed in 1997 and the building was demolished shortly afterwards. It was replaced by a modern luxury apartment block in 2003, also called The Haçienda. In October 2009, Peter Hook published his book on his time as co-owner of the Haçienda, &quot;How Not to Run a Club&quot;, and in 2010 he had six bass guitars made using wood from the Haçienda&#x27;s dancefloor.

===2000s===

The 2002 film &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; is centred on Factory Records, the Haçienda, and the infamous, often unsubstantiated anecdotes and stories surrounding them. Many of the people associated with Factory, including Tony Wilson, have minor parts; the central character, based on Wilson, is played by actor and comedian Steve Coogan.

Anthony Wilson, Factory Records&#x27; founder, died on 10 August 2007 at age 57, from complications arising from renal cancer.

Colin Sharp, the Durutti Column singer during 1978 who took part in the &quot;A Factory Sample&quot; EP, died on 7 September 2009, after suffering a brain haemorrhage. Although his involvement with Factory was brief, Sharp was an associate for a short while of Martin Hannett and wrote a book called &quot;Who Killed Martin Hannett&quot;, which upset Hannett&#x27;s surviving relatives, who stated the book included numerous untruths and fiction. Only months after Sharp&#x27;s death, Larry Cassidy, Section 25&#x27;s bassist and singer, died of unknown causes, on 27 February 2010.

In early 2010, Peter Hook, in collaboration with the Haçienda&#x27;s original interior designer Ben Kelly and British audio specialists Funktion-One, renovated and reopened FAC 251 (the former Factory Records headquarters on Charles Street) as a nightclub. The club still holds its original name, FAC 251, but people refer to it as &quot;Factory&quot;. Despite Ben Kelly&#x27;s design influences, Peter Hook insists, &quot;It&#x27;s not the Haçienda for fucks sake&quot;. The club has a weekly agenda, featuring DJs and live bands of various genres.

In May 2010, James Nice, owner of LTM Recordings, published the book &quot;Shadowplayers&quot;. The book charts the rise and fall of Factory and offers detailed accounts and information about many key figures involved with the label.

===FAC numbers===

Musical releases, and essentially anything closely associated with the label, were given a catalogue number in the form of either FAC, or FACT, followed by a number. FACT was reserved for full-length albums, while FAC was used for both single song releases and many other Factory &quot;productions&quot;, including: posters (FAC 1 advertised a club night), The Haçienda (FAC 51), a lawsuit filed against Factory Records by Martin Hannett (FAC 61), a hairdressing salon (FAC 98), a broadcast of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Tube&quot; TV series (FAC 104), customised packing tape (FAC 136), a bucket on a restored watermill (FAC 148), the Haçienda cat (FAC 191), a bet between Wilson and Gretton (FAC 253), a radio advertisement (FAC 294), and a website (FAC 421). Similar numbering was used for compact disc media releases (FACD), CD Video releases (FACDV), Factory Benelux releases (FAC BN or FBN), Factory US releases (FACTUS), and Gap Records Australia releases (FACOZ), with many available numbers restricted to record releases and other directly artist-related content.

Numbers were not allocated in strict chronological order; numbers for Joy Division and New Order releases generally ended in 3, 5, or 0 (with most Joy Division and New Order albums featuring multiples of 25), A Certain Ratio and Happy Mondays in 2, and the Durutti Column in 4. Factory Classical releases were 226, 236 and so on.

Despite the demise of Factory Records in 1992, the catalogue was still active. Additions included the &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; film (FAC 401), its website (FAC 433) and DVD release (FACDVD 424), and a book, &quot;Factory Records: The Complete Graphic Album&quot; (FAC 461).

Even Tony Wilson&#x27;s coffin received a Factory catalogue number; FAC 501.

===Factory Classical===
In 1989, Factory Classical was launched with five albums by composer Steve Martland, the Kreisler String Orchestra, the Duke String Quartet (which included Durutti Column viola player John Metcalfe), oboe player Robin Williams and pianist Rolf Hind. Composers included Martland, Benjamin Britten, Paul Hindemith, Francis Poulenc, Dmitri Shostakovich, Michael Tippett, György Ligeti and Elliott Carter. Releases continued until 1992, including albums by Graham Fitkin, vocal duo Red Byrd, a recording of Erik Satie&#x27;s &quot;Socrate&quot;, Piers Adams playing Handel&#x27;s Recorder Sonatas, Walter Hus and further recordings both of Martland&#x27;s compositions and of the composer playing Mozart.

==Successor labels==
In 1994, Wilson attempted to revive Factory Records, in collaboration with London Records, as &quot;Factory Too&quot;. The first release was by Factory stalwarts the Durutti Column; the other main acts on the label were Hopper and Space Monkeys, and the label gave a UK release to the first album by Stephin Merritt&#x27;s side project the 6ths, &quot;Wasps&#x27; Nests&quot;. A further release ensued: a compilation EP featuring previously unsigned Manchester acts East West Coast, the Orch, Italian Love Party, and K-Track. This collection of 8 tracks (2 per band) was simply entitled &quot;A Factory Sample Too&quot; (FACD2.02). The label was active until the late 1990s, latterly independent of London Records, as was &quot;Factory Once&quot;, which organised reissues of Factory material.

Wilson founded a short-lived fourth incarnation, F4 Records, in the early 2000s.

In 2012, Peter Saville and James Nice formed a new company called Factory Records Ltd., in association with Alan Erasmus and Oliver Wilson (son of Tony). This released only a vinyl reissue of &quot;From the Hip&quot; by Section 25. Nice subsequently revived the Factory Benelux imprint for Factory reissues, and for new recordings by Factory-associated bands. In 2019 Warner Music Group marked the 40th anniversary of Factory as a record label with a website, exhibition, and select vinyl editions including &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; and box set compilation Communications 1978-1992.

==Factory Records recording artists==
The bands with the most numerous releases on Factory Records include Joy Division/New Order, Happy Mondays, Durutti Column and A Certain Ratio. Each of these bands has between 15 and 30 FAC numbers attributed to their releases.

== Retrospective ==
An exhibition By Colin Gibbins took place celebrating the 20th anniversary of the closing of Factory Records (1978–1992) and its musical output, Colin&#x27;s collection was displayed at the Ice Plant, Manchester, between 4 and 7 May 2012. The exhibition was called FACTVM (from the Latin for &#x27;deed accomplished&#x27;).

In October 2019 a new box set was released containing both rarities and the label’s releases from its first two years.

From 19 June until 3 January 2022, Manchester&#x27;s Science and Industry Museum hosted an exhibition commemorating Factory Records entitled &quot;&#x27;Use Hearing Protection: The early years of Factory Records&quot;&#x27; Featuring graphic designs by Peter Saville, previously unseen items from the Factory archives, and objects loaned from the estates of both Tony Wilson and Rob Gretton, the former manager of Joy Division and New Order.

<text>Alfred Stock (July 16, 1876 – August 12, 1946) was a German inorganic chemist. He did pioneering research on the hydrides of boron and silicon, coordination chemistry, mercury, and mercury poisoning. The German Chemical Society&#x27;s Alfred-Stock Memorial Prize is named after him.

==Life==
Stock was born in Danzig (Gdańsk) and educated at the Friedrich-Werder grammar school in Berlin. In 1894 he began studies in chemistry at the Friedrich Wilhelm-University in Berlin. After finishing his dissertation about the quantitative separation of arsenic and antimony in the works of Emil Fischer he got his doctoral degree.

In 1899 he worked with the French chemist and toxicologist Henri Moissan in Paris for one year. He was given the task of synthesizing still unknown compounds of boron and silicon. Five years later he became professor at the University of Breslau. In 1916 he succeeded Richard Willstätter as director at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin. After a severe mercury poisoning he became the director of the Chemistry Department at the Technische Hochschule in Karlsruhe from 1926 to 1936. In 1932 he was a visiting professor at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York for four months.

A member of the NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party) since 1933, Stock was anti-Semitic. From February 6, 1936, to May 7, 1938 Stock was the president of the German Chemical Society. Bombs in the Second World War damaged the house of Stock. In September 1943 he and his wife moved to Bad Warmbrunn in Silesia, but the flow of refugees forced them to move again towards west in February 1945. They found accommodation in Aken (near Dessau). After the war in 1946, Stock endeavoured to revitalize German chemistry by lectures and memoirs. He was renowned for his pioneering research on boron hydrides.

==Research on the hydrides of boron and silicon==
In 1909 Stock began studying the boron hydrides—the boron hydrogen chemical compounds with general formula BxHy—at Breslau. Due to their extreme reactivity and flammability in air, boron hydrides could not be purified until his development of methods for separation using high-vacuum manifolds around 1912. He performed similar work on the hydrides of silicon. The hydrides of boron and silicon represented the first family of binary compounds to approach the richness of hydrocarbons in terms of structural diversity. Not only did the boron hydrides exhibit challenging properties, their structures were also unusual. Elucidation of the structures and the associated bonding models dramatically expanded the scope of inorganic chemistry. Boron hydrides such as diborane later developed into a range of reagents for organic synthesis as well as a source of diverse ligands and building blocks for researchers. With Henri Moissan, Stock discovered silicon boride.

==Research in other areas of inorganic chemistry==
In 1921, Stock first prepared metallic beryllium by electrolyzing a fused mixture of sodium and beryllium fluorides. This method made beryllium available for industrial use, such as in special alloys and glasses and for making windows in X-ray tubes.

He was also influential in coordination chemistry. The term &quot;ligand&quot; (from &quot;ligare&quot; Latin, to bind) was first used by Stock in 1917. H. Irving and R.J.P. Williams adopted the term in a paper published in 1948. Monodentate, bidentate, tridentate characterized the number of ligands attached to a metal. Given the introduction of ligand concept, he was also able to further derive the idea of bite angle and other aspects of chelation.

The &quot;Stock system,&quot; first published in 1919, was a system of nomenclature on binary compounds. In his own words, he considered the system to be &quot;simple, clear, immediately intelligible, capable of the most general application.&quot; In 1924, a German commission recommended Stock system to be adopted with some accommodations. FeCl2, which would have been named iron(2)-chloride according to Stock&#x27;s original idea, became iron(II) chloride in the revised proposal. In 1934 Stock agreed to the use of Roman numerals but preferred keeping the hyphen and dropping the parentheses. Although this suggestion has not been followed, the Stock system remains in use worldwide.

==Interests in mercury and mercury poisoning==
Stock published over 50 papers on different aspects of mercury and mercury poisoning. He also introduced sensitive tests and devised improved laboratory techniques for dealing with mercury which minimized poisoning risk, possibly initiated by his chronic mercury poisoning in 1923, due to his use of liquid mercury in some novel laboratory apparatus he invented. He became more vocal on protesting the mercury usage after realizing the toxicity of its organic derivatives. German dentists abandoned his warning in 1928 against copper amalgam usage. Nevertheless, a paper from Fleischmann, in which removal of mercury in amalgam-related illness had led to complete recovery, supported his idea. (&quot;Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift&quot; 1928, No. 8). A committee was founded in Berlin to investigate cases of possible mercury intoxication and hence the term micromercurialism was first used.

==Retirement and death==
After retirement in 1936, Stock moved from Karlsruhe to Berlin. He died in Aken, a small town near Dessau, in August 1946 at the age of 70.

==Posthumous recognition==
In recognition of his contributions to the field of inorganic chemistry, the German Chemical Society (Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker) created in 1950 the Alfred Stock Memorial Prize. The prize, consisting of a gold medal and money, is awarded every other year for &quot;an outstanding independent scientific experimental investigation in the field of inorganic chemistry.&quot;

<text>Nullsoft, Inc. was an American software house founded in Sedona, Arizona in 1997 by programmer Justin Frankel. Its products included the Winamp media player and the SHOUTcast MP3 streaming media server. 

==History==
In 1997, Justin Frankel, a programmer from Sedona, Arizona, founded Nullsoft, Inc in his home town. The company&#x27;s name is a parody of Microsoft. &quot;Mike the Llama&quot; is the company&#x27;s mascot. The company launched the media player Winamp in 1997, developed by Frankel and Dmitry Boldyrev. It was the second real-time MP3 player for Windows, following WinPlay3.

Nullsoft, along with Spinner.com, were sold to America Online (AOL) on June 1, 1999, for around $400 million and thereafter existed as a subsidiary, subsequently becoming a division of AOL Music. The headquarters were moved to San Francisco, California.

According to Bonnie Burton, then editor of the website Winamp.com, 2001 was a period of heightened tension between the Nullsoft staff and upper management, because of Frankel&#x27;s uncompromising views about file-sharing. He had developed Gnutella in 2000 and released it using company infrastructure. Ars Technica also noted that AOL failed to effectively monetize or find a larger audience for Winamp. Nullsoft&#x27;s San Francisco offices were closed in December 2003, with a near-concurrent departure of Frankel and the original Winamp development team. In 2013, some AOL Music sites were shut down and others sold to Townsquare Media.

In November 2013, an unofficial report surfaced that Microsoft was in talks with AOL to acquire Nullsoft. On January 14, 2014, it was officially announced that Belgian online radio aggregator Radionomy had bought Winamp and Shoutcast, formerly owned by Nullsoft. No financial details were publicly announced.

== Software ==
=== Winamp ===

Winamp is a media player released by Nullsoft in April 1997. By 1999, it was downloaded by 15 million people. The company released several new versions of the Winamp player and grew its monthly unique subscriber base to 60 million users by late 2004. Winamp was discontinued by Nullsoft around 2013. New versions of Winamp, which started releasing in 2023, are by a different developer named Llama Group.

=== SHOUTcast ===

SHOUTcast (currently Shoutcast) is an MP3 streaming media server.

=== Nullsoft Scriptable Install System ===
In later years, their open source installer system, the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) became an alternative to commercial products like InstallShield or Advanced Installer.

=== Other ===
Nullsoft&#x27;s developments after acquisition included the Nullsoft Streaming Video (NSV) format, which was intended to stream media that used any audio or video codec. In 2002, the press reported a technology called Ultravox being developed by Nullsoft. The company also created the peer-to-peer networks Gnutella and WASTE. Although AOL tried to limit the distribution of Gnutella and WASTE, the Ultravox technology was reportedly used for some AOL radio services in 2003. A service called Nullsoft Television was announced in 2003 using NSV.

<text>In physical chemistry and engineering, passivation is coating a material so that it becomes &quot;passive&quot;, that is, less readily affected or corroded by the environment. Passivation involves creation of an outer layer of shield material that is applied as a microcoating, created by chemical reaction with the base material, or allowed to build by spontaneous oxidation in the air. As a technique, passivation is the use of a light coat of a protective material, such as metal oxide, to create a shield against corrosion. Passivation of silicon is used during fabrication of microelectronic devices. Undesired passivation of electrodes, called &quot;fouling&quot;, increases the circuit resistance so it interferes with some electrochemical applications such as electrocoagulation for wastewater treatment, amperometric chemical sensing, and electrochemical synthesis.

When exposed to air, many metals naturally form a hard, relatively inert surface layer, usually an oxide (termed the &quot;native oxide layer&quot;) or a nitride, that serves as a passivation layer - i.e. these metals are &quot;self-protecting&quot;. In the case of silver, the dark tarnish is a passivation layer of silver sulfide formed from reaction with environmental hydrogen sulfide. Aluminium similarly forms a stable protective oxide layer which is why it does not &quot;rust&quot;. (In contrast, some base metals, notably iron, oxidize readily to form a rough, porous coating of rust that adheres loosely, is of higher volume than the original displaced metal, and sloughs off readily; all of which permit &amp; promote further oxidation.) The passivation layer of oxide markedly slows further oxidation and corrosion in room-temperature air for aluminium, beryllium, chromium, zinc, titanium, and silicon (a metalloid). The inert surface layer formed by reaction with air has a thickness of about 1.5 nm for silicon, 1–10 nm for beryllium, and 1 nm initially for titanium, growing to 25 nm after several years. Similarly, for aluminium, it grows to about 5 nm after several years.

In the context of the semiconductor device fabrication, such as silicon MOSFET transistors and solar cells, surface passivation refers not only to reducing the chemical reactivity of the surface but also to eliminating the dangling bonds and other defects that form electronic surface states, which impair performance of the devices. Surface passivation of silicon usually consists of high-temperature thermal oxidation.

==Mechanisms==

There has been much interest in determining the mechanisms that govern the increase of thickness of the oxide layer over time. Some of the important factors are the volume of oxide relative to the volume of the parent metal, the mechanism of oxygen diffusion through the metal oxide to the parent metal, and the relative chemical potential of the oxide. Boundaries between micro grains, if the oxide layer is crystalline, form an important pathway for oxygen to reach the unoxidized metal below. For this reason, vitreous oxide coatings – which lack grain boundaries – can retard oxidation. The conditions necessary, but not sufficient, for passivation are recorded in Pourbaix diagrams. Some corrosion inhibitors help the formation of a passivation layer on the surface of the metals to which they are applied. Some compounds, dissolved in solutions (chromates, molybdates) form non-reactive and low solubility films on metal surfaces.

It has been shown using electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy that during iron passivation, an n-type semiconductor Fe(III) oxide grows at the interface with the metal that leads to the buildup of an electronic barrier opposing electron flow and an electronic depletion region that prevents further oxidation reactions. These results indicate a mechanism of &quot;electronic passivation&quot;. The electronic properties of this semiconducting oxide film also provide a mechanistic explanation of corrosion mediated by chloride, which creates surface states at the oxide surface that lead to electronic breakthrough, restoration of anodic currents, and disruption of the electronic passivation mechanism (&quot;transpassivation&quot;).

==History==
===Discovery and etymology===
The fact that iron doesn&#x27;t react with concentrated nitric acid was discovered by Mikhail Lomonosov in 1738 and rediscovered by James Keir in 1790, who also noted that such pre-immersed Fe doesn&#x27;t reduce silver from nitrate anymore. In the 1830s, Michael Faraday and Christian Friedrich Schönbein studied that issue systematically and demonstrated that when a piece of iron is placed in dilute nitric acid, it will dissolve and produce hydrogen, but if the iron is placed in concentrated nitric acid and then returned to the dilute nitric acid, little or no reaction will take place. In 1836, Schönbein named the first state the active condition and the second the passive condition while Faraday proposed the modern explanation of the oxide film described above (Schönbein disagreed with it), which was experimentally proven by Ulick Richardson Evans only in 1927. Between 1955 and 1957, Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derrick discovered surface passivation of silicon wafers by silicon dioxide, using passivation to build the first silicon dioxide field effect transistors.

==Specific materials==

===Aluminium===
Aluminium naturally forms a thin surface layer of aluminium oxide on contact with oxygen in the atmosphere through a process called oxidation, which creates a physical barrier to corrosion or further oxidation in many environments. Some aluminium alloys, however, do not form the oxide layer well, and thus are not protected against corrosion. There are methods to enhance the formation of the oxide layer for certain alloys. For example, prior to storing hydrogen peroxide in an aluminium container, the container can be passivated by rinsing it with a dilute solution of nitric acid and peroxide alternating with deionized water. The nitric acid and peroxide mixture oxidizes and dissolves any impurities on the inner surface of the container, and the deionized water rinses away the acid and oxidized impurities.

Generally, there are two main ways to passivate aluminium alloys (not counting plating, painting, and other barrier coatings): chromate conversion coating and anodizing. Alclading, which metallurgically bonds thin layers of pure aluminium or alloy to different base aluminium alloy, is not strictly passivation of the &quot;base&quot; alloy. However, the aluminium layer clad on is designed to spontaneously develop the oxide layer and thus protect the base alloy.

Chromate conversion coating converts the surface aluminium to an aluminium chromate coating in the range of in thickness. Aluminium chromate conversion coatings are amorphous in structure with a gel-like composition hydrated with water. Chromate conversion is a common way of passivating not only aluminium, but also zinc, cadmium, copper, silver, magnesium, and tin alloys.

Anodizing is an electrolytic process that forms a thicker oxide layer. The anodic coating consists of hydrated aluminium oxide and is considered resistant to corrosion and abrasion. This finish is more robust than the other processes and also provides electrical insulation, which the other two processes may not.

===Carbon===
In carbon quantum dot (CQD) technology, CQDs are small carbon nanoparticles (less than 10 nm in size) with some form of surface passivation.

===Ferrous materials===

Ferrous materials, including steel, may be somewhat protected by promoting oxidation (&quot;rust&quot;) and then converting the oxidation to a metalophosphate by using phosphoric acid and add further protection by surface coating. As the uncoated surface is water-soluble, a preferred method is to form manganese or zinc compounds by a process commonly known as parkerizing or phosphate conversion. Older, less effective but chemically similar electrochemical conversion coatings included black oxidizing, historically known as bluing or browning. Ordinary steel forms a passivating layer in alkali environments, as reinforcing bar does in concrete.

====Stainless steel====

Stainless steels are corrosion-resistant, but they are not completely impervious to rusting. One common mode of corrosion in corrosion-resistant steels is when small spots on the surface begin to rust because grain boundaries or embedded bits of foreign matter (such as grinding swarf) allow water molecules to oxidize some of the iron in those spots despite the alloying chromium. This is called rouging. Some grades of stainless steel are especially resistant to rouging; parts made from them may therefore forgo any passivation step, depending on engineering decisions.

Common among all of the different specifications and types are the following steps: Prior to passivation, the object must be cleaned of any contaminants and generally must undergo a validating test to prove that the surface is &#x27;clean.&#x27; The object is then placed in an acidic passivating bath that meets the temperature and chemical requirements of the method and type specified between customer and vendor. While nitric acid is commonly used as a passivating acid for stainless steel, citric acid is gaining in popularity as it is far less dangerous to handle, less toxic, and biodegradable, making disposal less of a challenge. Passivating temperatures can range from ambient to , while minimum passivation times are usually 20 to 30 minutes. After passivation, the parts are neutralized using a bath of aqueous sodium hydroxide, then rinsed with clean water and dried. The passive surface is validated using humidity, elevated temperature, a rusting agent (salt spray), or some combination of the three. The passivation process removes exogenous iron, creates/restores a passive oxide layer that prevents further oxidation (rust), and cleans the parts of dirt, scale, or other welding-generated compounds (e.g. oxides).

Passivation processes are generally controlled by industry standards, the most prevalent among them today being ASTM A 967 and AMS 2700. These industry standards generally list several passivation processes that can be used, with the choice of specific method left to the customer and vendor. The &quot;method&quot; is either a nitric acid-based passivating bath, or a citric acid-based bath, these acids remove surface iron and rust, while sparing the chromium. The various &#x27;types&#x27; listed under each method refer to differences in acid bath temperature and concentration. Sodium dichromate is often required as an additive to oxidise the chromium in certain &#x27;types&#x27; of nitric-based acid baths, however this chemical is highly toxic. With citric acid, simply rinsing and drying the part and allowing the air to oxidise it, or in some cases the application of other chemicals, is used to perform the passivation of the surface.

It is not uncommon for some aerospace manufacturers to have additional guidelines and regulations when passivating their products that exceed the national standard. Often, these requirements will be cascaded down using Nadcap or some other accreditation system. Various testing methods are available to determine the passivation (or passive state) of stainless steel. The most common methods for validating the passivity of a part is some combination of high humidity and heat for a period of time, intended to induce rusting. Electro-chemical testers can also be utilized to commercially verify passivation.

===Titanium===

The surface of titanium and of titanium-rich alloys oxidizes immediately upon exposure to air to form a thin passivation layer of titanium oxide, mostly titanium dioxide. This layer makes it resistant to further corrosion, aside from gradual growth of the oxide layer, thickening to ~25 nm after several years in air. This protective layer makes it suitable for use even in corrosive environments such as sea water. Titanium can be anodized to produce a thicker passivation layer. As with many other metals, this layer causes thin-film interference which makes the metal surface appear colored, with the thickness of the passivation layer directly affecting the color produced.

===Nickel===
Nickel can be used for handling elemental fluorine, owing to the formation of a passivation layer of nickel fluoride. This fact is useful in water treatment and sewage treatment applications.

===Silicon===
In the area of microelectronics and photovoltaic solar cells, surface passivation is usually implemented by thermal oxidation at about 1000 °C to form a coating of silicon dioxide. Surface passivation is critical to solar cell efficiency. The effect of passivation on the efficiency of solar cells ranges from 3–7%. The surface resistivity is high, &gt; 100 Ωcm.

=== Perovskite ===
The easiest and most widely studied method to improve perovskite solar cells is passivation. These defects usually lead to deep energy level defects in solar cells due to the presence of hanging bonds on the surface of perovskite films. Usually, small molecules or polymers are doped to interact with the hanging bonds and thus reduce the defect states. This process is similar to Tetris, i.e., we always want the layer to be full. A small molecule with the function of passivation is some kind of square that can be inserted where there is an empty space and then a complete layer is obtained. These molecules will generally have lone electron pairs or pi-electrons, so they can bind to the defective states on the surface of the cell film and thus achieve passivation of the material. Therefore, molecules such as carbonyl, nitrogen-containing molecules, and sulfur-containing molecules are considered, and recently it has been shown that π electrons can also play a role.

In addition, passivation not only improves the photoelectric conversion efficiency of perovskite cells, but also contributes to the improvement of device stability. For example, adding a passivation layer of a few nanometers thickness can effectively achieve passivation with the effect of stopping water vapor intrusion.

<text>HiDef (short for high definition), also called 24p, is a 24 frames-per-second digital video format for high-resolution capture of motion pictures. The &quot;24&quot; refers to the frame rate (24 frames/second) and the &quot;p&quot; stands for progressive scanning (as opposed to interlaced scanning). As of 2003, there are two 24p HD formats: Sony 24p and Panasonic 24p.

Cameras of this capture depth have been available only since about 2001. Notably, they were used by George Lucas for the production of his second Star Wars prequel, &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;. The advantage of shooting with digital-capture cameras is the efficiency in the production process. To edit scenes digitally, no transfer from film to digital is required. Also, if it is projected with a digital projector, no transference to film is required, either.

<text>Single-8, also known as 8 mm Type S, Model II, is a motion picture film format introduced by Fujifilm of Japan in 1965 as an alternative to the Kodak Super 8 format. Single-8 and Super 8 use mutually incompatible cartridges, but the 8 mm film within each cartridge shares the same frame and perforation size and arrangement, so developed Single-8 and Super 8 films can be shown using the same projection equipment.

Although never as popular internationally as Super 8, the format continued to live in parallel. Fuji discontinued the manufacture of Single-8 film by 2012. The two final Single-8 film cartridge types produced by Fuji were Fujichrome R25N, discontinued in 2012, and Fujichrome RT200N, discontinued in 2010.

==History==
Both Single-8 and Super 8 were launched in 1965. The company Konan, also known for developing the Konan-16 subminiature camera, claims in its history page to have developed the Single-8 system in 1959. Single-8 proved to be quite successful in Japan, capturing 80–85% of the domestic market for home movies until 1973, but in the United States and other parts of the world, the Super 8 was the dominant format, in part due to Kodak&#x27;s influence. At least one camera was made which accepted both Single-8 and Super 8: the Honeywell Elmo Tri-Filmatic Super 100, manufactured in Japan by Elmo and sold in different countries as the Elmo C300, which uses interchangeable magazines for Regular (Double) 8, Super 8, Single-8, and 100-ft reels of Double Super 8.

Fuji announced it would cease production of 8 mm film in 2006, but reversed that decision in 2007. At the time, Fuji was manufacturing two versions of Single-8 film: Fujichrome R25N, a daylight-balanced (5500 K) filmstock, and Fujichrome RT200N, a tungsten-balanced (3400 K) for indoor filming. The Sound Film brand is no longer made, although a magnetic sound stripe could be added to the film after processing. This option was chosen whenever sending the exposed film to Fuji in Japan for processing. Fuji discontinued sales of Single-8 film in March 2012 and stopped processing exposed film in 2013.

In addition to the Fuji color films, black and white film is available from Japanese company Retro Enterprises. This Single-8 black &amp; white reversal film, named Retro X, is film speed 200 and is manufactured in Germany.
Although Fujifilm stopped exportation of Single-8 Film to other countries, individual companies in the United States and Europe import the filmstock independently. Single-8 is readily available in its home country of Japan where even used cameras can reach high prices in online auctions on Yahoo! Japan. For example, a used Fujica ZC1000, the top-of-the-line Single-8 camera, can fetch prices upwards to 250,000 Japanese yen (approx $2900).

Daicon Film of Japan (now Gainax) produced a series of well-known films in the 1980s using Single-8 film, some of which are now available on DVD.

==Details==
Single-8 film uses a polyester base, which is the thickness of tri-acetate Super 8, but the films within the incompatible cartridge systems are otherwise identical, incorporating the same dimensions for sprocket holes and image size, which means developed Single-8 can be projected in Super 8 projectors and vice versa. While the Single-8 film is more resistant to breakage, it tends to stretch if the film transport jams. Due to the difference in film base thickness, splicing the two formats together in a finished film may require adjustment of the projector&#x27;s focus at the join.

Like Super 8, unexposed Single-8 film comes pre-loaded in plastic cartridges; the B-shaped Single-8 cartridge uses two separate, coplanar spools for supply and take-up, unlike Super 8, in which the spools are coaxial. As a result, Single-8 film offered unlimited rewind, whereas Super 8 rewind was limited to several seconds, as there is no external connection to turn the supply spool; Super 8 cameras with rewind rely on having sufficient empty space within the cartridge for the rewound film to pile up inside, but in general, they are limited to approximately 100 frames of rewind in total. Rewinding enables in-camera special effects, including dissolves, multiple exposures, and title sequences. The Super 8 cartridge is not designed to be reloaded, but the Single-8 cartridge can be reloaded; Single-8 film is extracted by unpeeling two pieces of tape to separate the cartridge halves.

The Single 8 cartridge was designed with an open section for the film, allowing it to be fed between the pressure pad and film gate, both part of the camera, during exposure. This contrasts with the Kodak system which had a plastic pressure plate built into the cartridge. It was believed that Single-8 offered superior film positioning, but the reality was that Super 8&#x27;s plastic pressure plate could be moulded with far smaller tolerance than Single 8&#x27;s metal version could be machined.

Fuji offered on-film optical sound recording rather than a magnetic stripe; this system required the user to draw additional film out of the cassette.

=== Mechanical ===
Single-8 cartridges are nominally wide, high, and thick, according to the governing ISO standard. There are three round mounting bosses on one surface to help locate the cartridge within the camera. In addition, like the notches on Super 8 cartridges, the Single-8 cartridge has several tabs, slots, and holes to automatically set film speed and type.


=== Processing Single-8 Film ===
Fuji&#x27;s Single-8 developing process is not the same as Process EM-26, but is similar. There is more involved in the removal of the remjet antihalation backing than the now long discontinued Kodak Ektachrome Process EM-26 films. The color chemistry, while close, is slightly different, particularly the color development.

It was often recommended to send Fuji Single-8 film to Fujifilm in Japan for processing, however processing ended in 2013.

<doc id="175630" wikidata="Q514423" url="?curid=175630" title="Parthenopean Republic">
<text>The Parthenopean Republic (, ) or Neapolitan Republic () was a short-lived, semi-autonomous republic located within the Kingdom of Naples and supported by the French First Republic. The republic emerged during the French Revolutionary Wars after King Ferdinand IV fled before advancing French troops. The republic existed from 21 January to 13 June 1799, collapsing when Ferdinand returned to restore monarchial authority and forcibly subdued republican activities.

== Etymology ==

The Parthenopean Republic is named after Parthenope, an ancient Greek settlement now part of the city of Naples.

==Origins of the Republic==

On the outbreak of the French Revolution King Ferdinand IV of Naples and Queen Maria Carolina did not at first actively oppose reform; but after the fall of the French monarchy they became violently opposed to it, and in 1793, joined the first coalition against France, instituting severe persecutions against all who were remotely suspected of French sympathies. Republicanism, however, gained ground, especially among the aristocracy.

In 1796, peace with France was concluded, but in 1798, during Napoleon&#x27;s absence in Egypt and after Nelson&#x27;s victory at the Battle of the Nile, Maria Carolina induced Ferdinand to go to war with France once more. Nelson himself arrived at Naples in September 1798, where he was enthusiastically received. The Neapolitan army had 70,000 men hastily summoned under the command of the Austrian general Karl Mack. On 29 November, this army entered Rome, which had been evacuated by the French, wishing to restore Papal authority. However, after a sudden French counter-attack, his troops were forced to retreat and were eventually routed. A contemporary satirist said of the King&#x27;s conquest of Rome: &quot;He came, he saw, he fled&quot;.

The King hurried back to Naples. Although the &quot;lazzaroni&quot; (the lowest class of the people) were devoted to the Bourbon dynasty and ready to defend it, he embarked on Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Vanguard&quot; and fled with his court to Palermo in a panic. Prince Francesco Pignatelli Strongoli took over the city and the fleet was burned.

The wildest confusion prevailed, and the &quot;lazzaroni&quot; massacred numbers of persons suspected of republican sympathies, while the nobility and the educated classes, finding themselves abandoned by their King, began to contemplate a republic under French auspices to avoid anarchy. On 12 January 1799, Pignatelli signed in Sparanise the surrender to the French general Jean Étienne Championnet. Pignatelli also fled to Palermo on 16 January 1799.

When the news of the surrender to the French reached Naples and the provinces, the &quot;lazzaroni&quot; rebelled. Though ill-armed and ill-disciplined, they resisted the enemy with desperate courage. In the meantime, the Jacobin and Republican parties of Naples surged, and civil war broke out. On 20 January 1799, the Republicans under General Championnet conquered the fortress of Castel Sant&#x27;Elmo, and the French entered the city the next day. The casualties were 8,000 Neapolitans and 1,000 French.

==Republic==

On 21 or 23 January 1799, the Parthenopean Republic was proclaimed. The name referred to an ancient Greek colony &quot;Parthenope&quot; on the site of the future city of Naples. The Republic had no real domestic constituency and existed solely due to the power of the French Army. The Republic&#x27;s leaders were men of culture, high character and birth, such as Gennaro Serra, Prince of Cassano Irpino but they were doctrinaire and impractical, and they knew very little of the lower classes of their own country. The new government soon found itself in financial difficulties, owing to Championnet&#x27;s demands for money (he was later relieved for graft); it failed to organise an army (and was therefore dependent on French protection) and met with little success in its attempts to &quot;democratise&quot; the provinces.

Meanwhile, the court at Palermo sent Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo, a wealthy and influential prelate, to Calabria to organize a counter-revolution. He succeeded beyond expectation with his &quot;Christian army of the Holy Faith&quot; (&quot;Esercito Cristiano della Santa Fede&quot;). A British squadron approached Naples and occupied the island of Procida, but after a few engagements with the Republican fleet commanded by Francesco Caracciolo, an ex-officer in the Bourbon navy, it was recalled to Palermo, as the Franco–Spanish fleet was expected.

Ruffo, supported by Russian and Turkish ships under the command of Admiral Ushakov, now marched on the capital, whence the French, except for a small force under , withdrew. The scattered Republican detachments were defeated, only Naples and Pescara holding out.

On 13 June 1799. Ruffo and his troops reached Naples, and after a desperate battle at the Ponte della Maddalena, entered the city. For weeks the Calabresi and &quot;lazzaroni&quot; continued to pillage and massacre, and Ruffo was unable, even if willing, to restrain them. However, the Royalists were not masters of the city, for the French in Castel Sant&#x27;Elmo and the Republicans in Castel Nuovo and Castel dell&#x27;Ovo still held out and bombarded the streets, while the Franco-Spanish fleet might arrive at any moment. Consequently, Ruffo was desperately anxious to come to terms with the Republicans for the evacuation of the castles, in spite of the Queen&#x27;s orders to make no terms with the rebels. After some negotiation, the parties concluded an armistice and agreed on capitulation (&quot;onorevole capitolazione&quot;), whereby the castles were to be evacuated, the hostages liberated and the garrisons free to remain in Naples unmolested or to sail for Toulon. The capitulation was signed by Ruffo, and British, Russian and Turkish officers, as well as, for the Republicans, the French commander.

While the vessels were being prepared for the voyage to Toulon all the hostages in the castles were liberated save four; but on 24 June 1799, Nelson arrived with his fleet, and on hearing of the capitulation he refused to recognise it except insofar as it concerned the French.
Cardinal Ruffo indignantly declared that once the treaty was signed, not only by himself but by the Russian and Turkish commandants and by the British captain Edward Foote, it must be respected, and on Nelson&#x27;s refusal, he said that he would not help him to capture the castles. On 26 June 1799, Nelson changed his attitude and authorised Sir William Hamilton, the British minister, to inform the cardinal that he (Nelson) would do nothing to break the armistice; while Captains Bell and Troubridge wrote that they had Nelson&#x27;s authority to state that the latter would not oppose the embarcation of the Republicans. Although these expressions were equivocal, the Republicans were satisfied and embarked on the vessels prepared for them. However, on 28 June, Nelson received despatches from the court (in reply to his own), in consequence of which he had the vessels brought under the guns of his ships, and many of the Republicans were arrested. Caracciolo, who had been caught whilst attempting to escape from Naples, was tried by a court-martial of Royalist officers under Nelson&#x27;s auspices on board the admiral&#x27;s flagship, condemned to death and hanged at the yard arm. The last jacobin stronghold, Pescara, surrendered on June 30.

==Aftermath==

On 10 July 1799, King Ferdinand entered the Bay of Naples on a Neapolitan frigate, the &quot;Sirena&quot;. At four o&#x27;clock that afternoon, he went aboard the British &quot;Foudroyant&quot;, which was to be his headquarters for the next four weeks.

Of some 8,000 political prisoners, 99 were executed, including Prince Gennaro Serra, who was publicly beheaded, the intellectual Mario Pagano, who had written the republican constitution; the scientist, Domenico Cirillo; Luisa Sanfelice; , the minister of war under the republic; Massa, the defender of Castel dell&#x27;Ovo; Ettore Carafa, the defender of Pescara, who had been captured by treachery; and Eleonora Fonseca Pimentel, court-poet turned revolutionary and editor of &quot;il Monitore Napoletano&quot;, the newspaper of the republican government. More than 500 other people were imprisoned (222 for life), 288 were deported and 67 exiled. The subsequent censorship and oppression of all political movement was far more debilitating for Naples.

After news of these events arrived in Britain, Whig statesman Charles James Fox made a speech in the British House of Commons on 3 February 1800 criticising what he alleged to be Britain&#x27;s acquiescence to Ferdinand&#x27;s repression of Neapolitan republicans.

<text>Hilario Zapata (born August 19, 1958) is a Panamanian former professional boxer who competed from 1977 to 1993. He is a world champion in two weight classes, having held the WBC light flyweight title twice between 1980 and 1983 and the WBA flyweight title from 1985 to 1987.

==Professional career==
Zapata began his professional boxing career in 1977, beating Victor Lopez by a knockout in the second round. He had 2 wins in &#x27;77.

He had a fast ascent to the top, starting in 1978. By his fifth bout, on July 1, he was meeting former world Flyweight champion Juan Guzmán in Panama City, beating Guzman by a decision in ten. His next fight, against Yong-Hwang Kim, in South Korea, was his first fight abroad; he gave himself a twentieth birthday present by beating Kim by a 10-round decision on August 19. Then, he met former world Flyweight champion Alfonso Lopez, for the vacant Latin American Jr. Flyweight belt. Zapata suffered his first loss in the fight against Lopez, when he was beaten by a decision in 12.

He started 1979 with a fight against Ramon Perez in Puerto Rico, winning by a knockout in nine. He had three more wins in 1979, including one over the two time world Flyweight champion Freddie Castillo, and by the end of that year he was ranked number one in the world among Jr. Flyweight challengers by the WBC.

Zapata went to Japan in March 1980, and on the 24th day of that month he beat defending world champion Shigeo Nakajima to become world Jr. Flyweight champion. He defended his title against Chi-Bok Kim, winning a 15-round unanimous decision in South Korea, against Hector Rey Melendez in Venezuela, winning also by a 15-round decision, against Nakajima in a Tokyo rematch, winning by knockout in 11, and against Reynaldo Becerra in Venezuela. He closed out 1980 win a 15-round decision win over Becerra.

In 1981, he and future world Flyweight champion Joey Olivo fought what was the only Jr. Flyweight title bout ever broadcast on American national TV live until Michael Carbajal came along nine years later. Zapata beat Olivo by a knockout in round 13 to retain his belt, and then, he went to San Francisco to retain the crown once again, with a 15-round decision over Rudy Crawford. On August 15, and back home in Panama City, he beat Mexican German Torres by a decision in 15 to retain his belt, and then he faced former world Jr. Flyweight champion Netrnoi Sor Vorasingh, retaining the belt by a knockout in 10.

In his next fight, on February 6, 1982, Zapata lost the world title by knockout in two at the hands of &quot;Amado Panterita Ursua&quot;, but Ursua in turn would lose it to Tadashi Tomori. On July 20, Zapata regained the world title by beating Tomori on a 15-round decision in Japan. Then, he beat future world champion and Zapata-conqueror Jung-Koo Chang by a decision in 15 in Chonju, and he closed out the year with a rematch against Tomori in Tokyo, knocking Tomori out in eight rounds.

On March 26, 1983, Zapata and Chang met again in South Korea, and this time, Chang became world champion by knocking Zapata out in the third round. Then, on November 9 at Las Vegas, on the Marvin Hagler vs. Roberto Durán&#x27;s undercard&#x27;s week, Zapata was beaten by a knockout in 10 by Harold Petty.

His career seemingly over, he quickly recovered from those back to back losses and began winning again, but this time as a Flyweight. By the end of 1984, he was ranked number one by the WBA among Flyweights, and on December 8 of that year, he challenged world Flyweight champion Santos Laciar of Argentina at Buenos Aires&#x27; legendary Luna Park. Zapata lost a 15-round decision that night, but in 1986, after Laciar had vacated the crown, the WBA gave him a second chance, and he beat Alonzo Gonzalez to win the WBA world Flyweight championship. He then beat Javier Lucas to retain the belt. He retained the title also against Shuichi Hozumi, Dodie Penalosa, Alberto Castro and Claudemir Calvalho, all by decision, before losing it to Fidel Bassa of Colombia, also by a decision.

In 1993, he tried to become a world champion once again, but was knocked out in the first round by the WBC world Jr. Bantamweight champion Sung-Kil Moon. A win against Moon would have made Zapata a member of the exclusive group of world boxing champions in three different weight categories or more.

It can also be added that Zapata&#x27;s first pair of boxing gloves, when he was 12, came as a present from Duran himself.

Panamanian newspaper &quot;El Panama America&quot; declared on one of their editorials that Zapata, according to their opinion, should be inducted to the International Boxing Hall Of Fame soon. Zapata eventually was voted into the Hall of Fame, in December 2015, and was inducted during June 2016.

Zapata had a record of 43 wins and 10 losses, with 1 draw, and 14 wins by knockout.

<doc id="175634" wikidata="Q186941" url="?curid=175634" title="Columbia Pictures">
<text>Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., doing business as Columbia Pictures, is an American film production and distribution company that is the flagship unit of the Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, a division of Sony Entertainment&#x27;s Sony Pictures, which is one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; film studios and a subsidiary of the multinational conglomerate Sony Group Corporation.

On June 19, 1918, brothers Jack and Harry Cohn and their business partner Joe Brandt founded the studio as Cohn-Brandt-Cohn (CBC) Film Sales Corporation. It adopted the Columbia Pictures name on January 10, 1924 (operating as Columbia Pictures Corporation until December 23, 1968), went public two years later, and eventually began to use the image of Columbia, the female personification of the United States, as its logo.

In its early years, Columbia was a minor player in Hollywood, but began to grow in the late 1920s, spurred by a successful association with director Frank Capra. With Capra and others such as the most successful two reel comedy series, The Three Stooges, Columbia became one of the primary homes of the screwball comedy. In the 1930s, Columbia&#x27;s major contract stars were Jean Arthur and Cary Grant. In the 1940s, Rita Hayworth became the studio&#x27;s premier star and propelled their fortunes into the late 1950s. Rosalind Russell, Glenn Ford and William Holden also became major stars at the studio.

It is one of the leading film studios in the world, and was one of the so-called &quot;Little Three&quot; among the eight major film studios of Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age. Today, it has become the world&#x27;s third largest major film studio.

The company was also primarily responsible for distributing Disney&#x27;s &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; film series as well as the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; cartoon series from 1929 to 1932. The studio is presently headquartered at the Irving Thalberg Building on the former Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (currently known as the Sony Pictures Studios) lot in Culver City, California, since 1990.

Columbia Pictures is a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA), under Sony Pictures Entertainment, and is currently one of the five live-action labels of the Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, alongside TriStar Pictures, Screen Gems, Sony Pictures Classics, and 3000 Pictures. Columbia&#x27;s most commercially successful franchises include &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Jumanji&quot;, &quot;Bad Boys&quot;, &quot;Men in Black&quot;, &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;, &quot;Robert Langdon&quot;, and &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, and the studio&#x27;s highest-grossing film worldwide is &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot;, which grossed $1.92 billion worldwide.

==History==
===Early years as CBC===

The studio was founded on June 19, 1918, as Cohn-Brandt-Cohn (CBC) Film Sales by brothers Jack and Harry Cohn and Jack&#x27;s best friend Joe Brandt, and released its first feature film &quot;More to Be Pitied Than Scorned&quot; on August 20, 1922. The film, with a budget of $20,000, was a success, bringing in $130,000 in revenue for the company. Brandt was president of CBC Film Sales, handling sales, marketing and distribution from New York along with Jack Cohn, while Harry Cohn ran production in Hollywood. The studio&#x27;s early productions were low-budget short subjects: &quot;Screen Snapshots&quot;, the &quot;Hallroom Boys&quot; (the vaudeville duo of Edward Flanagan and Neely Edwards), and the Charlie Chaplin-imitator Billy West. The start-up CBC leased space in a Poverty Row studio on Hollywood&#x27;s famously low-rent Gower Street. Among Hollywood&#x27;s elite, the studio&#x27;s small-time reputation led some to joke that &quot;CBC&quot; stood for &quot;Corned Beef and Cabbage&quot;.

===Reorganization and new name===
CBC was reorganized as Columbia Pictures Corporation by brothers Harry and Jack Cohn and best friend Joe Brandt on January 10, 1924. Harry Cohn became president in 1932 and remained head of production as well, thus concentrating enormous power in his hands. He would run Columbia for a total of 34 years, one of the longest tenures of any studio chief (Warner Bros.&#x27; Jack L. Warner was head of production &quot;or&quot; CEO longer but did not become CEO until 1956). Even in an industry rife with nepotism, Columbia was particularly notorious for having a number of Harry and Jack&#x27;s relatives in high positions. Humorist Robert Benchley called it the Pine Tree Studio, &quot;because it has so many Cohns&quot;.

Brandt eventually tired of dealing with the Cohn brothers, and in 1932 sold his one-third stake to Jack and Harry Cohn, who took over from him as president.

Columbia&#x27;s product line consisted mostly of moderately budgeted features and short subjects including comedies, sports films, various serials, and cartoons. Columbia gradually moved into the production of higher-budget fare, eventually joining the second tier of Hollywood studios along with United Artists and Universal. Like United Artists and Universal, Columbia was a horizontally integrated company. It controlled production and distribution; it did not own any theaters.

Helping Columbia&#x27;s climb was the arrival of an ambitious director, Frank Capra. Between 1927 and 1939, Capra constantly pushed Cohn for better material and bigger budgets. A string of hits he directed in the early and mid 1930s solidified Columbia&#x27;s status as a major studio. In particular, &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, which nearly swept the 1934 Oscars, put Columbia on the map. Until then, Columbia&#x27;s business had depended on theater owners willing to take its films, since it did not have a theater network of its own. Other Capra-directed hits followed, including the original version of &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (1937), with Ronald Colman, and &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; (1939), which made James Stewart a major star.

In 1933, Columbia hired Robert Kalloch to be its chief fashion and women&#x27;s costume designer. He was the first contract costume designer hired by the studio, and he established the studio&#x27;s wardrobe department. Kalloch&#x27;s employment, in turn, convinced leading actresses that Columbia Pictures intended to invest in their careers.

In 1938, the addition of B. B. Kahane as vice president would produce Charles Vidor&#x27;s &quot;Those High Grey Walls&quot; (1939), and &quot;The Lady in Question&quot; (1940), the first joint film of Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford. Kahane would later become the President of Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1959, until his death a year later.

Columbia could not afford to keep a huge roster of contract stars, so Jack Cohn usually borrowed them from other studios. At Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the industry&#x27;s most prestigious studio, Columbia was nicknamed &quot;Siberia&quot;, as Louis B. Mayer would use the loan-out to Columbia as a way to punish his less-obedient signings. In the 1930s, Columbia signed Jean Arthur to a long-term contract, and after &quot;The Whole Town&#x27;s Talking&quot; (1935), Arthur became a major comedy star. Ann Sothern&#x27;s career was launched when Columbia signed her to a contract in 1936. Cary Grant signed a contract in 1937 and soon after it was altered to a non-exclusive contract shared with RKO.

Many theaters relied on westerns to attract big weekend audiences, and Columbia always recognized this market. Its first cowboy star was Buck Jones, who signed with Columbia in 1930 for a fraction of his former big-studio salary. Over the next two decades Columbia released scores of outdoor adventures with Jones, Tim McCoy, Ken Maynard, Jack Luden, Bob Allen (Robert (Tex) Allen), Russell Hayden, Tex Ritter, Ken Curtis, and Gene Autry. Columbia&#x27;s most popular cowboy was Charles Starrett, who signed with Columbia in 1935 and starred in 131 western features over 17 years.

===Short subjects===
At Harry Cohn&#x27;s insistence, the studio signed the Three Stooges in 1934. Rejected by MGM (which kept straight-man Ted Healy but let the Stooges go), the Stooges made 190 shorts for Columbia between 1934 and 1957. Columbia&#x27;s short-subject department employed many famous comedians, including Buster Keaton, Charley Chase, Harry Langdon, Andy Clyde, and Hugh Herbert. Almost 400 of Columbia&#x27;s 529 two-reel comedies were released to television between 1958 and 1961; to date, all of the Stooges, Keaton, Charley Chase, Shemp Howard, Joe Besser, and Joe DeRita subjects have been released to home video.

Columbia incorporated animation into its studio in 1929, distributing Krazy Kat cartoons, taking over from Paramount. The following year, Columbia took over distribution of the Mickey Mouse series from Celebrity Productions until 1932. In 1933, The Mintz studio was re-established under the Screen Gems brand; Columbia&#x27;s leading cartoon series were &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;, &quot;Scrappy&quot;, &quot;The Fox and the Crow&quot;, and (very briefly) &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;. Screen Gems was the last major cartoon studio to produce black-and-white cartoons, producing them until 1946. That same year, Screen Gems shut down but had completed enough cartoons for the studio to release until 1949. In 1948, Columbia agreed to release animated shorts from United Productions of America; these new shorts were more sophisticated than Columbia&#x27;s older cartoons, and many won critical praise and industry awards. In 1957, two years before the UPA deal was terminated, Columbia distributed the Hanna-Barbera cartoons, including Loopy De Loop from 1959 to 1965, which was Columbia&#x27;s final theatrical cartoon series. In 1967, the Hanna-Barbera deal expired and was not renewed.

According to Bob Thomas&#x27; book &quot;King Cohn&quot;, studio chief Harry Cohn always placed a high priority on serials. Beginning in 1937, Columbia entered the lucrative serial market and kept making these weekly episodic adventures until 1956, after other studios had discontinued them. The most famous Columbia serials are based on comic-strip or radio characters: &quot;Mandrake the Magician&quot; (1939), &quot;The Shadow&quot; (1940), &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; (1940), &quot;Captain Midnight&quot; (1942), &quot;The Phantom&quot; (1943), &quot;Batman&quot; (1943), and the especially successful &quot;Superman&quot; (1948), among many others.

Columbia also produced musical shorts, sports reels (usually narrated by sportscaster Bill Stern), and travelogues. Its &quot;Screen Snapshots&quot; series, showing behind-the-scenes footage of Hollywood stars, was a Columbia perennial that the studio had been releasing since the silent-movie days; producer-director Ralph Staub kept this series going through 1958.

===1940s===

In the 1940s, propelled in part by the surge in audiences for their films during World War II, the studio also benefited from the popularity of its biggest star, Rita Hayworth. Columbia maintained a long list of contractees well into the 1950s; Glenn Ford, Penny Singleton, William Holden, Judy Holliday, The Three Stooges, Ann Miller, Evelyn Keyes, Ann Doran, Jack Lemmon, Cleo Moore, Barbara Hale, Adele Jergens, Larry Parks, Arthur Lake, Lucille Ball, Kerwin Mathews and Kim Novak.

Harry Cohn monitored the budgets of his films, and the studio got the maximum use out of costly sets, costumes, and props by reusing them in other films. Many of Columbia&#x27;s low-budget &quot;B&quot; pictures and short subjects have an expensive look, thanks to Columbia&#x27;s efficient recycling policy. Cohn was reluctant to spend lavish sums on even his most important pictures, and it was not until 1943 that he agreed to use three-strip Technicolor in a live-action feature. Columbia was the last major studio to employ the expensive color process. Columbia&#x27;s first Technicolor feature was the western &quot;The Desperadoes&quot;, starring Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford. Cohn quickly used Technicolor again for &quot;Cover Girl&quot;, a Hayworth vehicle that instantly was a smash hit, released in 1944, and for the fanciful biography of Frédéric Chopin, &quot;A Song to Remember&quot;, with Cornel Wilde, released in 1945. Another biopic, 1946&#x27;s &quot;The Jolson Story&quot; with Larry Parks and Evelyn Keyes, was started in black-and-white, but when Cohn saw how well the project was proceeding, he scrapped the footage and insisted on filming in Technicolor.

In 1948, the &quot;United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.&quot; anti-trust decision forced Hollywood motion picture companies to divest themselves of the theater chains that they owned. Since Columbia did not own any theaters, it was now on equal terms with the largest studios. The studio soon replaced RKO on the list of the &quot;Big Five&quot; studios.

====Screen Gems====

In 1946, Columbia dropped the Screen Gems brand from its cartoon line, but retained the Screen Gems name for various ancillary activities, including a 16 mm film-rental agency and a TV-commercial production company. On November 8, 1948, Columbia adopted the Screen Gems name for its television production subsidiary when the studio acquired Pioneer Telefilms, a television commercial company founded by Jack Cohn&#x27;s son, Ralph. Pioneer had been founded in 1947, and was later reorganized as Screen Gems. The studio opened its doors for business in New York on April 15, 1949. By 1951, Screen Gems became a full-fledged television studio and became a major producer of sitcoms for TV, beginning with &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; and followed by &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;, &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, &quot;Bewitched&quot;, &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, and &quot;The Monkees&quot;.

On July 1, 1956, studio veteran Irving Briskin stepped down as manager of Columbia Pictures and formed his own production company Briskin Productions, Inc. to release series through Screen Gems and supervise all of its productions. On December 10, Screen Gems expanded into television syndication by acquiring Hygo Television Films (a.k.a. &quot;Serials Inc.&quot;) and its affiliated company United Television Films, Inc. Hygo Television Films was founded in 1951 by Jerome Hyams, who also acquired United Television Films in 1955 that was founded by Archie Mayers.

In 1957, two years before its parent company Columbia dropped UPA, Screen Gems entered a distribution deal with Hanna-Barbera Productions, which produced classic animated series such as &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, &quot;The Quick Draw McGraw Show&quot;, &quot;The Huckleberry Hound Show&quot;, &quot;The Yogi Bear Show&quot;, &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;, &quot;The Jetsons&quot; and &quot;Top Cat&quot; among others. Screen Gems distributed the company&#x27;s shows until 1967, when Hanna-Barbera was sold to Taft Broadcasting. In 1960, the animation studio became a publicly traded company under the name Screen Gems, Inc., when Columbia spun off an 18% stake.

===1950s===
By 1950, Columbia had discontinued most of its popular series films (&quot;Boston Blackie&quot;, &quot;Blondie&quot;, &quot;The Lone Wolf&quot;, &quot;The Crime Doctor&quot;, &quot;Rusty&quot;, etc.) Only &quot;Jungle Jim&quot;, launched by producer Sam Katzman in 1949, kept going through 1955. Katzman contributed greatly to Columbia&#x27;s success by producing dozens of topical feature films, including crime dramas, science-fiction stories, and rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll musicals. Columbia kept making serials until 1956 and two-reel comedies until 1957, after other studios had abandoned these mediums.

As the larger studios declined in the 1950s, Columbia&#x27;s position improved. This was largely because it did not suffer from the massive loss of income that the other major studios suffered from the loss of their theaters (well over 90 percent, in some cases). Columbia continued to produce 40-plus pictures a year, offering productions that often broke ground and kept audiences coming to theaters. Some of its significant films from this era include the studio&#x27;s adaptation of the controversial James Jones novel &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1953), &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954), and &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (1957) with William Holden and Alec Guinness, all of which won the Best Picture Oscar. Another significant film of the studio was the free adaptation of George Orwell&#x27;s dystopian novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1956).

Columbia also released the productions of the English studio Warwick Films (by producers Irving Allen and Albert R. Broccoli), as well as many films by producer Carl Foreman, who resided in England. Columbia distributed some films made by Hammer, which was also based in England.

In December 1956, Jack Cohn, co-founder and executive vice-president, died. In 1958, Columbia established its own record label, Colpix Records, initially run by Jonie Taps, who headed Columbia&#x27;s music department, and later Paul Wexler and Lester Sill. Colpix was active until 1966 when Columbia entered into a joint agreement with RCA Victor and discontinued Colpix in favor of its new label, Colgems Records.

===1960s: After Harry Cohn&#x27;s death===
Shortly after closing their short subjects department, Columbia president Harry Cohn died of a heart attack in February 1958. His nephew Ralph Cohn died in 1959, ending almost four decades of family management.

The new management was headed by Abe Schneider, who had joined the company as an office boy out of high school and become a director in 1929, rising through the financial side of the business. In 1963, Columbia acquired music publisher Aldon Music.

By the late 1960s, Columbia had an ambiguous identity, offering old-fashioned fare such as &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; and &quot;Oliver!&quot; along with the more contemporary &quot;Easy Rider&quot; and &quot;The Monkees&quot;. After turning down releasing Albert R. Broccoli&#x27;s Eon Productions &quot;James Bond&quot; films, Columbia hired Broccoli&#x27;s former partner Irving Allen to produce the Matt Helm series with Dean Martin. Columbia also produced a &quot;James Bond&quot; spoof, &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967), in conjunction with Charles K. Feldman, which held the adaptation rights for that novel.

By 1966, the studio was suffering from box-office failures, and takeover rumors began surfacing. Columbia was surviving solely on the profits made from Screen Gems, whose holdings also included radio and television stations. On December 23, 1968, Screen Gems merged with Columbia Pictures Corporation and became part of the newly formed Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. for $24.5 million. Schneider was chairman of the holding company and Leo Jaffe president.
Following the merger, in March 1969, CPI purchased Bell Records for $3.5 million (mainly in CPI stock), retaining Larry Uttal as label president.

===1970s===

Nearly bankrupt by the early 1970s, the studio was saved via a radical overhaul: the Gower Street Studios (now called &quot;Sunset Gower Studios&quot;) were sold and a new management team was brought in. In 1972, Columbia and Warner Bros. formed a partnership called The Burbank Studios, in which both companies shared the Warner studio lot in Burbank.
In 1971, Columbia Pictures established sheet music publisher Columbia Pictures Publications, with vice president and general manager Frank J. Hackinson, who later became the president.

In 1973, Allen &amp; Co took a financial stake in Columbia Pictures Industries and Alan Hirschfield was appointed CEO, succeeding Leo Jaffe who became chairman. Stanley Schneider, son of Abe Schneider (who became honorary chairman before leaving the board in 1975) was replaced as head of the Columbia Pictures studio by David Begelman, who reported to Hirschfield. Some years later Begelman was involved in a check-forging scandal that badly hurt the studio&#x27;s image.

On May 6, 1974, Columbia retired the Screen Gems name from television, renaming its television division to the name of Columbia Pictures Television. The name was suggested by David Gerber, who was then president of Columbia&#x27;s television division. The same year, Columbia Pictures acquired Rastar Pictures, which included Rastar Productions, Rastar Features, and Rastar Television. Ray Stark then founded Rastar Films, the reincarnation of Rastar Pictures, which was acquired by Columbia Pictures in February 1980.

Columbia Pictures also reorganized its music and record divisions. Clive Davis was hired as a record and music consultant by Columbia Pictures in 1974 and later became temporary president of Bell Records. Davis&#x27;s real goal was to revitalize Columbia Pictures&#x27; music division. With a $10 million investment by CPI, and a reorganization of the various Columbia Pictures legacy labels (Colpix, Colgems, and Bell), Davis introduced Columbia Pictures&#x27; new record division, Arista Records, in November 1974, with Davis himself owning 20% of the new venture. Columbia maintained control of the label until 1979, when it was sold to Ariola Records. In addition, Columbia sold its music publishing business (Columbia-Screen Gems) to EMI in August 1976 for $15 million. Both would later be reunited with Columbia Pictures under Sony ownership.

In December 1976, Columbia Pictures acquired the arcade game company D. Gottlieb &amp; Co. for $50 million.

In 1978, Begelman was suspended for having embezzled money from Columbia. Hirschfield was forced out for his refusal to reinstate him. Begelman later resigned and was replaced by Daniel Melnick in June 1978. Fay Vincent was hired to replace Hirschfield.

Frank Price became president of production in 1978. In March 1979, he would become president of Columbia Pictures, succeeding Melnick. During Price&#x27;s tenure he was responsible for turning out 9 of the top 10 grossing films in Columbia&#x27;s history.

In the fall of 1978, Kirk Kerkorian, a Vegas casino mogul who also controlled Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, acquired a 5.5% stake in Columbia Pictures. He then announced on November 20, that he intended to launch a tender offer to acquire another 20% for the studio. On December 14, a standstill agreement was reached with Columbia by promising not to go beyond 25% or seeking control for at least three years.

On January 15, 1979, the United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust suit against Kerkorian to block him from holding a stake in Columbia while controlling MGM. On February 19, 1979, Columbia Pictures Television acquired TOY Productions; the production company founded by Bud Yorkin and writers Saul Turteltaub and Bernie Orenstein in 1976. In May, Kerkorian acquired an additional 214,000 shares in Columbia, raising his stake to 25%. On August 2, the trial began; on August 14, the court ruled in favor for Kerkorian. In 1979, Columbia agreed with Time-Life Video to release 20 titles on videocassette.

===1980s: Coca-Cola, Tri-Star, and other acquisitions and ventures===
On September 30, 1980, Kerkorian sued Columbia for ignoring shareholders&#x27; interest and violating an agreement with him. Columbia later accused him on October 2, of scheming with Nelson Bunker Hunt to gain control of Columbia.

In 1981, Kerkorian sold his 25% stake in Columbia back to CPI. Columbia Pictures later acquired 81% of The Walter Reade Organization, which owned 11 theaters; it purchased the remaining 19% in 1985.

Around this time, Columbia put Steven Spielberg&#x27;s proposed follow-up to &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, &quot;Night Skies&quot;, into turnaround. The project eventually became the highest-grossing film of the time, &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;. Columbia received a share of the profits for its involvement in the development.

On May 17, 1982, Columbia Pictures acquired Spelling-Goldberg Productions for over $40 million. With a healthier balance-sheet (due in large part to box office hits like &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot;, &quot;Stir Crazy&quot;, &quot;The Blue Lagoon&quot;, and &quot;Stripes&quot;) Columbia was bought by beverage company The Coca-Cola Company on June 22, 1982, for $750 million. Studio head Frank Price mixed big hits like &quot;Tootsie&quot;, &quot;Gandhi&quot;, &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;, &quot;The Big Chill&quot;, and &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; with many costly flops. To share the increasing cost of film production, Coke brought in two outside investors whose earlier efforts in Hollywood had come to nothing. In 1982, Columbia, Time Inc.&#x27;s HBO and CBS announced, as a joint venture, &quot;Nova Pictures&quot;; this enterprise was to be renamed Tri-Star Pictures. In 1983, Price left Columbia Pictures after a dispute with Coca-Cola and went back to Universal. He was replaced by Guy McElwaine.

In the early 1980s, Columbia and Tri-Star Pictures set up a film partnership with Delphi Film Associates and acquired an interest in various film releases. In 1984, Delphi Film Associates III acquired an interest in the Tri-Star and Columbia film slate of 1984, which would make a $60 million offering in the financing of film production. Also that year, Columbia Pictures had bought out the rights to &quot;Hardbodies&quot;, which was once premiered on The Playboy Channel.

Columbia Pictures expanded its music publishing operations in the 1980s, acquiring Big 3 Publishing (the former sheet music operations of Robbins, Feist, and Miller) from MGM/UA Communications Co. in 1983, Belwin-Mills Publishing from Simon &amp; Schuster in 1985, and Al Gallico Music in 1987.

On June 18, 1985, Columbia&#x27;s parent acquired Norman Lear and Jerry Perenchio&#x27;s Embassy Communications, Inc. (including Embassy Pictures, Embassy Television, Tandem Productions, and Embassy Home Entertainment), mostly for its library of television series such as &quot;All in the Family&quot; and &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, for $485 million. On November 16, 1985, CBS dropped out of the Tri-Star venture.

Many changes occurred in 1986. Expanding its television franchise, on May 5, Columbia&#x27;s parent also bought Merv Griffin Enterprises for $250 million. The company was notable for: &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, &quot;Dance Fever&quot;, and &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;. Months later on August 28, the Columbia Pictures Television Group acquired Danny Arnold&#x27;s Danny Arnold Productions, Inc.. The deal included Arnold&#x27;s rights to the sitcom &quot;Barney Miller&quot; (Four D Productions) among other produced series such as &quot;Fish&quot; (The Mimus Corporation), &quot;A.E.S. Hudson Street&quot; (Triseme Corporation), and &quot;Joe Bash&quot; (Tetagram Ltd.). Arnold had dropped the federal and state lawsuits against the television studio, who was accusing them of antitrust violations, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty. 

Coca-Cola sold the Embassy Pictures division to Dino de Laurentiis, who later folded Embassy Pictures into Dino de Laurentiis Productions, Inc. The company was renamed as De Laurentiis Entertainment Group. Coca-Cola also sold Embassy Home Entertainment to Nelson Entertainment. Coca-Cola, however, retained the Embassy Pictures name, logo, and trademark. HBO was the last partner to drop out of the Tri-Star venture and sold its shares to Columbia Tri-Star later expanded into the television business with its new Tri-Star Television division.

The same year, Columbia recruited British producer David Puttnam to head the studio. Puttnam attempted to defy Hollywood filmmaking by making smaller films instead of big tentpole pictures. His criticism of American film production, in addition to the fact that the films he greenlit were mostly flops, left Coke and Hollywood concerned.

Puttnam then discontinued multi-picture pacts with various filmmakers, including Norman Jewison, which was permitted to expire before all of the promised product could be delivered. Under Puttnam&#x27;s control, he set up a $270 million package of in-house pictures and acquisitions, and the average lineup of 25 features was expected to be $10.78 million, about $4 million less of the cost at Columbia before Puttnam came on board, and a number of low-cost acquisitions such as Spike Lee&#x27;s $5 million picture &quot;School Daze&quot;.

On October 22, 1986, Greg Coote was appointed by Columbia Pictures as key executive of the studio, to complement David Puttman&#x27;s pledge on Columbia Pictures to fix its sights over its international market. On December 17, 1986, the company acquired a 30% share in Roadshow, Coote &amp; Carroll, a company Greg Coote headed, and decided that they would pick up films and miniseries to put an effort to add it up to Columbia&#x27;s shares, and listed dozens of theatrical and television films and dozens of miniseries throughout the addition of the Columbia slate.

On June 26, 1987, Coca-Cola sold The Walter Reade Organization to Cineplex Odeon Corporation. On October 14, 1987, Coca-Cola&#x27;s entertainment division invested in $30 million in Castle Rock Entertainment with five Hollywood executives. Coke&#x27;s entertainment business division owned 40% in Castle Rock, while the execs owned 60%.

====Columbia Pictures Entertainment era (1987–1989)====

The volatile film business made Coke shareholders nervous, and following the critical and box-office failure of &quot;Ishtar&quot;, Coke spun off its entertainment holdings on December 21, 1987, and sold it to Tri-Star Pictures for $3.1 billion. Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. was renamed as Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc. (CPE), with Coke owning 80% of the company. Both studios continued to produce and distribute films under their separate names.

Puttnam was ousted from the position after only one year. Puttnam was succeeded by Dawn Steel. Other small-scale, &quot;boutique&quot; entities were created: Nelson Entertainment, a joint venture with British and Canadian partners, Triumph Films, jointly owned with French studio Gaumont, and which is now a low-budget label, and Castle Rock Entertainment.

On January 2, 1988, Columbia/Embassy Television and Tri-Star Television were formed into the new Columbia Pictures Television and Embassy Communications was renamed as ELP Communications to serve as a copyright holder of the Embassy television productions. In early 1988, CPE relaunched Triumph Films as Triumph Releasing Corporation, which handled administrative services related to distribution of Columbia and Tri-Star&#x27;s films for the North American market, while Triumph was responsible for the sales, marketing and distribution of Columbia and Tri-Star films under the direction of each individual studio internationally, with Patrick N. Williamson serving as head of Triumph.

On January 16, 1988, CPE&#x27;s stock fell slightly in the market on its first day trading in the New York Stock Exchange. Coke spun off 34.1 million of its Columbia shares to its shareholders by reducing its stake in CPE from 80% to 49%. On April 13, 1988, CPE spun off Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. as a reformed company of the Tri-Star studio. In April 1988, CPE sold its music publishing operations to the British company Filmtrax. (Filmtrax was acquired by Thorn EMI in 1990.) In June 1988, CPE announced the sale of Columbia Pictures Publications (consisting of the print music operations) to the investment firm Boston Ventures and was renamed CPP/Belwin. CPP/Belwin was acquired by Warner Chappell Music of Warner Bros. in 1994.

On February 2, 1989, Columbia Pictures Television formed a joint-venture with Norman Lear&#x27;s Act III Communications called Act III Television (now Act III Productions) to produce television series instead of managing.

===Sony era (1989–present)===
On September 28, 1989, the Columbia Pictures empire was sold to the electronics giant Sony, one of several Japanese firms then buying American properties, for the amount of $3.4 billion. The sale netted Coca-Cola a profit from its investment in the studio. Sony then hired two producers, Peter Guber and Jon Peters, to serve as coheads of production when Sony also acquired the Guber-Peters Entertainment Company (the former game show production company, Barris Industries) for $200 million on September 29, 1989. Guber and Peters had just signed a long-term contract with Warner Bros. in 1989, having been with the company since 1983. Warner Bros., then a subsidiary of Warner Communications, sued Sony for $1 billion. Sony completed CPE&#x27;s acquisition on November 8, and the Guber-Peters acquisition was completed on the following day.

On December 1, 1989, Guber and Peters hired a longtime lawyer of GPEC, Alan J. Levine, to the post of president and COO of Columbia&#x27;s newly formed company Filmed Entertainment Group (FEG). FEG consisted of Columbia Pictures, Tri-Star Pictures, Triumph Releasing, Columbia Pictures Television, Columbia Pictures Television Distribution, Merv Griffin Enterprises, RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video (internationally known as RCA/Columbia Pictures International Video), Guber-Peters Entertainment Company, and ancillary and distribution companies.

====1990s====

In 1990, Sony ended up paying hundreds of millions of dollars, gave up a half-interest in its Columbia House Records Club mail-order business, and bought from Time Warner the former Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studio lot in Culver City, which Warner Communications had acquired in its takeover of Lorimar-Telepictures in 1989, thus ending the Burbank Studios partnership. Initially renamed Columbia Studios, Sony spent $100 million to refurbish the rechristened Sony Pictures Studios lot.

Guber and Peters set out to prove they were worth this fortune, but though there were to be some successes, there were also many costly flops. The same year, Frank Price was made the chairman of Columbia Pictures. His company Price Entertainment, Inc., which he founded in 1987, was merged with Columbia in March 1991. Price left Columbia on October 4, 1991, and was replaced by Warner Bros. executive Mark Canton and reactivated Price Entertainment as Price Entertainment Company with a nonexclusive deal with SPE. Peters was fired by his partner Guber in 1991, but Guber later resigned in 1994 to form Mandalay Entertainment the following year. The entire operation was reorganized and renamed Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) on August 7, 1991, and at the same time, TriStar (which had officially lost its hyphen) relaunched its television division in October. In December 1991, SPE created Sony Pictures Classics for arthouse fare and was headed by Michael Barker, Tom Bernard, and Marcie Bloom, who previously operated United Artists Classics and Orion Classics. Publicly humiliated, Sony suffered an enormous loss on its investment in Columbia, taking a $2.7 billion write-off in 1994. John Calley took over as SPE president in November 1996, installing Amy Pascal as Columbia Pictures president and Chris Lee as president of production at TriStar. By the next spring, the studios were clearly rebounding, setting a record pace at the box office. On December 7, 1992, Sony Pictures acquired the Barry &amp; Enright game show library.

On February 21, 1994, Columbia Pictures Television and TriStar Television merged to form Columbia TriStar Television (CTT), including the rights to &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; after CTT folded Merv Griffin Enterprises in June. That same year, the company also purchased Stewart Television, known for producing game shows such as &quot;Pyramid&quot; and &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;, among others. On July 21, 1995, Sony Pictures teamed up with Jim Henson Productions and created the joint venture Jim Henson Pictures.

In the 1990s, Columbia announced plans for a rival &quot;James Bond&quot; franchise since they owned the rights to &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and were planning to make a third version of &quot;Thunderball&quot; with Kevin McClory. MGM and Danjaq, LLC, owners of the franchise, sued Sony Pictures in 1997, with the legal dispute ending two years later in an out-of-court settlement. Sony traded the &quot;Casino Royale&quot; rights for $10 million, as well as the Spider-Man filming rights. The superhero became Columbia&#x27;s most successful franchise: The first movie came out in 2002, and as of 2021, there have been seven follow-up movies with US grosses in excess of $2.5 billion. Between the releases of the first and second sequels in 2004 and 2007, Sony led a consortium that purchased MGM, giving it distribution rights to the &quot;James Bond&quot; franchise.

In 1997, Columbia Pictures ranked as the highest-grossing movie studio in the United States, with a gross of $1.256 billion. In 1998, Columbia and TriStar merged to form the Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group (a.k.a. Columbia TriStar Pictures), though both studios still produce and distribute under their own names. Pascal retained her position as president of the newly united Columbia Pictures, while Lee became the combined studio&#x27;s head of production. On December 8, 1998, Sony Pictures Entertainment relaunched the Screen Gems brand as a horror and independent film distribution company after shutting down Triumph Films. In 1999, TriStar Television was folded into CTT. Two years later, CPT was folded into CTT as well.

====2000s====
In the 2000s, Sony broadened its release schedule by backing Revolution Studios, the production/distribution company headed by Joe Roth. On October 25, 2001, CTT and Columbia TriStar Television Distribution (CTTD) merged to form Columbia TriStar Domestic Television. On September 16, 2002, Columbia TriStar Domestic Television was renamed Sony Pictures Television. Also in 2002, Columbia broke the record for biggest domestic theatrical gross, with a tally of $1.575 billion, coincidentally breaking its own record of $1.256 billion, set in 1997. The 2002 gross was primarily raised by such blockbusters as &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Men in Black II&quot;, and &quot;XXX&quot;. 

The studio was also the most lucrative of 2004, with over $1.338 billion in the domestic box office with films such as &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, &quot;50 First Dates&quot;, and &quot;The Grudge&quot;, and in 2006. Columbia&#x27;s box office successes of 2006 included such blockbusters as &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, &quot;The Pursuit of Happyness&quot;, &quot;Monster House&quot;, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, and &quot;Open Season&quot;. The studio not only finished the year in first place, but also reached an all-time record high sum of $1.711 billion, which was an all-time yearly record for any studio. It was surpassed by Warner Bros. in 2009.

====2010s====
On October 29, 2010, Matt Tolmach, the copresident of Columbia Pictures, stepped down to produce &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; and its sequel. Doug Belgrad, the other copresident of Columbia, was promoted to sole president of the studio. Belgrad and Tolmach had been copresidents of the studio since 2008 and had been working together as a team since 2003. The same day, Hanna Minghella was named president of production of Columbia.

On November 18, 2012, Sony Pictures announced it has passed the profit line of $4 billion worldwide with the success of Columbia&#x27;s releases &quot;Skyfall&quot;, &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;, &quot;Men in Black 3&quot;, and &quot;Hotel Transylvania&quot; and Screen Gems&#x27; releases &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Vow&quot;, and &quot;Resident Evil: Retribution&quot;.

On July 16, 2014, Doug Belgrad was named president of the Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group. He exited the post in June 2016. On June 2, Sanford Panitch, who had been the head of international local language production at the studio, was named president of Columbia Pictures.

====2020s====

In April 2021, Sony signed a deal with Netflix, Inc. and The Walt Disney Company that allows Sony&#x27;s titles from 2022 to 2026 to stream on Netflix, Hulu and Disney+. Netflix signed for exclusive &quot;pay 1 window&quot; streaming rights, which is typically an 18-month window following its theatrical release, and Disney signed for &quot;pay 2 window&quot; rights for the films, which would be streamed on Disney+ and Hulu as well as broadcast on Disney&#x27;s linear television networks.

On December 17, 2021, Columbia released &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot;. The movie grossed over $1 billion in the box office, being the first film since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to gross a billion. The film became Sony Pictures&#x27; highest-grossing release.tom 2 2022

On January 10, 2024, Sony Pictures celebrated the centennial anniversary of the founding of Columbia Pictures with a new motion logo; the centennial print logo was previously revealed on November 14, 2023. The motion logo, which was used throughout Columbia&#x27;s 2024 slate, made its theatrical debut in the 2024 re-release of &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot; (2023).

==Logo==
The Columbia Pictures logo, featuring the Torch Lady, a woman carrying a torch and wearing a drape (representing Columbia, a personification of the United States), has gone through five major changes. It has often been compared to the Statue of Liberty, which was an inspiration to the Columbia Pictures logo.

=== History ===
Originally in 1924, Columbia Pictures used a logo featuring a female Roman soldier holding a shield in her left hand and a stick of wheat in her right hand, which was based on actress Doris Doscher (known as the model for the statue on the Pulitzer Fountain) as the Standing Liberty quarter used from 1916 to 1930, though the studio&#x27;s version was given longer hair. The logo changed in 1928 with a new woman wearing a draped flag and torch. The woman wore a headdress, the stola and carried the palla of ancient Rome, and above her were the words &quot;A Columbia Production&quot; (&quot;A Columbia Picture&quot; or &quot;Columbia Pictures Corporation&quot;) written in an arch. The illustration was based upon the actress Evelyn Venable, known for providing the voice of the Blue Fairy in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. An alternative version of the logo with the slogan &quot;Gems of the Screen&quot;, used from 1926 to 1932; itself a takeoff on the song &quot;Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean&quot;, later inspired the renaming of the Charles Mintz Studio into Screen Gems.

In 1936, the logo was changed into the well known classic look: the Torch Lady now stood on a pedestal, wore no headdress, and the text &quot;Columbia&quot; appeared in chiseled letters behind her. Pittsburgh native Jane Chester Bartholomew, whom Harry Cohn discovered working as an extra at Columbia, portrayed the Torch Lady in the logo. There were several variations to the logo over the years—significantly, a color version was done in 1943 for &quot;The Desperadoes&quot;. Two years earlier, the flag became just a drape with no markings. The latter change came after a federal law was passed making it illegal to wear an American flag as clothing. In the 1950s, the woman&#x27;s robe was redrawn and shaded with a plunging neckline and an exposed slipper-clad foot. A new form of animation was used on the logo as well, with a torch that radiates light instead of flickers. From 1955 to 1963, Columbia used the woman from the 1936 logo under the Screen Gems banner, officially billing itself as a part of &quot;the Hollywood studios of Columbia Pictures&quot;, as spoken in announcements at the end of some Screen Gems series. 1976&#x27;s &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; was one of the last films released before the &quot;Torch Lady&quot; was revamped.

From 1976 to 1993, Columbia Pictures used two logos. The first, from 1976 to 1981 (or from 1975 for promotional material until 1982 for international territories) used just a sunburst representing the beams from the torch, although the woman appears briefly in the opening logo. The score accompanying the first logo was composed by Suzanne Ciani. The studio hired visual effects pioneer Robert Abel to animate the first logo. The image was created with over fifty light exposures that included streak and special filter passes. The woman returned in 1981, but in a much smoother form described as resembling a Coke bottle. The 1981 version was also used for Triumph Films, with the woman under the Arc de Triomphe in the logo. During the studio&#x27;s run with the Coca-Cola Company from 1982 to 1987, a golden version of the Torch Lady was used for the Columbia Pictures Television logo until it was replaced with the 1981 version after Coca-Cola sold Columbia to Sony. The slogans for the 1976 and 1981 logos were &quot;Let us entertain you&quot; and &quot;Movies That Matter&quot;, respectively.

The 1936, 1976 and 1981 versions of the logo would be later used in several Columbia releases, generally to match the year a given film is set in.

In 1992, the longest-running, and perhaps best known, iteration of the logo was created; the television division was the first to use it. Films began to use the new logo the year after, when Scott Mednick and the Mednick Group were hired by Peter Guber to create logos for all the entertainment properties then owned by Sony Pictures. Mednick hired New Orleans artist Michael Deas, to digitally repaint the logo and return the woman to her &quot;classic&quot; look. An urban legend is that actress Annette Bening was the model for the current logo. Bening&#x27;s face was later superimposed onto the Torch Lady in the opening intro of &quot;What Planet Are You From?&quot; (2000) as an inside joke. Michael Deas hired Jennifer Joseph, a 28-year-old graphics artist for &quot;The Times-Picayune&quot;, as a model for the logo. Due to time constraints, she agreed to help out on her lunch break. It was the first and only time she ever modeled. Joseph had recently discovered she was pregnant at the time. Deas also hired &quot;The Times-Picayune&quot; photographer Kathy Anderson to photograph the reference photography. The animation was created by Synthespian Studios in 1993 by Jeff Kleiser and Diana Walczak, who used 2D elements from the painting and converted it to 3D. The studio being part of Sony would not be referenced on-screen until 1996. VHS promos featured the current logo with a stylized &quot;75&quot; behind the Torch Lady, commemorating the studio&#x27;s 75th anniversary in 1999 with the slogan, &quot;Lighting Up Screens Around the World&quot;. The current logo was also used for Screen Gems Network and Columbia Showcase Theatre, both now defunct programming blocks that featured syndicated airings of Sony Pictures-owned shows and films, respectively. In 2012, the current logo was displayed as a painting at the Ogden Museum of Southern Art in New Orleans. Deas gave an interview to WWL-TV: &quot;I never thought it would make it to the silver screen and I never thought it would still be up 20 years later, and I certainly never thought it would be in a museum, so it&#x27;s kind of gratifying.&quot; On November 14, 2023, Sony unveiled a special centennial logo ahead the studios’ 100th anniversary, consisting of the current Torch Lady within a stylized “100” and later posted an animation that showcases the older logos in the same vein as the &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; films on January 10, 2024, the 100th anniversary of the founding of Columbia Pictures. This logo was used on Columbia&#x27;s 2024 releases.

<text>In materials chemistry, a binary phase or binary compound is a chemical compound containing two different elements. Some binary phase compounds are molecular, e.g. carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). More typically binary phase refers to extended solids. Famous examples zinc sulfide, which contains zinc and sulfur, and tungsten carbide, which contains tungsten and carbon.

Phases with higher degrees of complexity feature more elements, e.g. three elements in ternary phases, four elements in quaternary phases. These phases exhibit a higher degree of complexity due to the interaction of these elements at different conditions.

<doc id="175641" wikidata="Q319827" url="?curid=175641" title="Chelation">
<text>Chelation () is a type of bonding of ions and their molecules to metal ions. It involves the formation or presence of two or more separate coordinate bonds between a polydentate (multiple bonded) ligand and a single central metal atom. These ligands are called chelants, chelators, chelating agents, or sequestering agents. They are usually organic compounds, but this is not a necessity.

The word &quot;chelation&quot; is derived from Greek χηλή, &quot;chēlē&quot;, meaning &quot;claw&quot;; the ligands lie around the central atom like the claws of a crab. The term &quot;chelate&quot; () was first applied in 1920 by Sir Gilbert T. Morgan and H. D. K. Drew, who stated: &quot;The adjective chelate, derived from the great claw or &quot;chele&quot; (Greek) of the crab or other crustaceans, is suggested for the caliperlike groups which function as two associating units and fasten to the central atom so as to produce heterocyclic rings.&quot;

Chelation is useful in applications such as providing nutritional supplements, in chelation therapy to remove toxic metals from the body, as contrast agents in MRI scanning, in manufacturing using homogeneous catalysts, in chemical water treatment to assist in the removal of metals, and in fertilizers.

== Chelate effect ==

The chelate effect is the greater affinity of chelating ligands for a metal ion than that of similar nonchelating (monodentate) ligands for the same metal.

The thermodynamic principles underpinning the chelate effect are illustrated by the contrasting affinities of copper(II) for ethylenediamine (en) vs. methylamine.
In () the ethylenediamine forms a chelate complex with the copper ion. Chelation results in the formation of a five-membered CuC2N2 ring. In () the bidentate ligand is replaced by two monodentate methylamine ligands of approximately the same donor power, indicating that the Cu–N bonds are approximately the same in the two reactions.

The thermodynamic approach to describing the chelate effect considers the equilibrium constant for the reaction: the larger the equilibrium constant, the higher the concentration of the complex.
Electrical charges have been omitted for simplicity of notation. The square brackets indicate concentration, and the subscripts to the stability constants, &quot;β&quot;, indicate the stoichiometry of the complex. When the analytical concentration of methylamine is twice that of ethylenediamine and the concentration of copper is the same in both reactions, the concentration [Cu(en)] is much higher than the concentration [Cu(MeNH2)2] because .

An equilibrium constant, &quot;K&quot;, is related to the standard Gibbs free energy, by
: formula_1
where &quot;R&quot; is the gas constant and &quot;T&quot; is the temperature in kelvins. is the standard enthalpy change of the reaction and is the standard entropy change.

Since the enthalpy should be approximately the same for the two reactions, the difference between the two stability constants is due to the effects of entropy. In equation () there are two particles on the left and one on the right, whereas in equation () there are three particles on the left and one on the right. This difference means that less entropy of disorder is lost when the chelate complex is formed with bidentate ligand than when the complex with monodentate ligands is formed. This is one of the factors contributing to the entropy difference. Other factors include solvation changes and ring formation. Some experimental data to illustrate the effect are shown in the following table.

These data confirm that the enthalpy changes are approximately equal for the two reactions and that the main reason for the greater stability of the chelate complex is the entropy term, which is much less unfavorable. In general it is difficult to account precisely for thermodynamic values in terms of changes in solution at the molecular level, but it is clear that the chelate effect is predominantly an effect of entropy.

Other explanations, including that of Schwarzenbach, are discussed in Greenwood and Earnshaw (&quot;loc.cit&quot;).

== In nature ==

Numerous biomolecules exhibit the ability to dissolve certain metal cations. Thus, proteins, polysaccharides, and polynucleic acids are excellent polydentate ligands for many metal ions. Organic compounds such as the amino acids glutamic acid and histidine, organic diacids such as malate, and polypeptides such as phytochelatin are also typical chelators. In addition to these adventitious chelators, several biomolecules are specifically produced to bind certain metals (see next section).

Virtually all metalloenzymes feature metals that are chelated, usually to peptides or cofactors and prosthetic groups. Such chelating agents include the porphyrin rings in hemoglobin and chlorophyll. Many microbial species produce water-soluble pigments that serve as chelating agents, termed siderophores. For example, species of &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; are known to secrete pyochelin and pyoverdine that bind iron. Enterobactin, produced by &quot;E. coli&quot;, is the strongest chelating agent known. The marine mussels use metal chelation, especially Fe3+ chelation with the Dopa residues in mussel foot protein-1 to improve the strength of the threads that they use to secure themselves to surfaces.

In earth science, chemical weathering is attributed to organic chelating agents (e.g., peptides and sugars) that extract metal ions from minerals and rocks. Most metal complexes in the environment and in nature are bound in some form of chelate ring (e.g., with a humic acid or a protein). Thus, metal chelates are relevant to the mobilization of metals in the soil, the uptake and the accumulation of metals into plants and microorganisms. Selective chelation of heavy metals is relevant to bioremediation (e.g., removal of 137Cs from radioactive waste).

== Applications ==
=== Animal feed additives ===
Synthetic chelates such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) proved too stable and not nutritionally viable. If the mineral was taken from the EDTA ligand, the ligand could not be used by the body and would be expelled. During the expulsion process, the EDTA ligand randomly chelated and stripped other minerals from the body. According to the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), a metal–amino acid chelate is defined as the product resulting from the reaction of metal ions from a soluble metal salt with amino acids, with a mole ratio in the range of 1–3 (preferably 2) moles of amino acids for one mole of metal. The average weight of the hydrolyzed amino acids must be approximately 150 and the resulting molecular weight of the chelate must not exceed 800 Da. Since the early development of these compounds, much more research has been conducted, and has been applied to human nutrition products in a similar manner to the animal nutrition experiments that pioneered the technology. Ferrous bis-glycinate is an example of one of these compounds that has been developed for human nutrition.

=== Dental use ===
Dentin adhesives were first designed and produced in the 1950s based on a co-monomer chelate with calcium on the surface of the tooth and generated very weak water-resistant chemical bonding (2–3 MPa).

=== Chelation therapy ===
Chelation therapy is an antidote for poisoning by mercury, arsenic, and lead. Chelating agents convert these metal ions into a chemically and biochemically inert form that can be excreted. Chelation using sodium calcium edetate has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for serious cases of lead poisoning. It is not approved for treating &quot;heavy metal toxicity&quot;. Although beneficial in cases of serious lead poisoning, use of disodium EDTA (edetate disodium) instead of calcium disodium EDTA has resulted in fatalities due to hypocalcemia. Disodium EDTA is not approved by the FDA for any use, and all FDA-approved chelation therapy products require a prescription.

=== Contrast agents ===
Chelate complexes of gadolinium are often used as contrast agents in MRI scans, although iron particle and manganese chelate complexes have also been explored. Bifunctional chelate complexes of zirconium, gallium, fluorine, copper, yttrium, bromine, or iodine are often used for conjugation to monoclonal antibodies for use in antibody-based PET imaging. These chelate complexes often employ the usage of hexadentate ligands such as desferrioxamine B (DFO), according to Meijs &quot;et al.&quot;, and the gadolinium complexes often employ the usage of octadentate ligands such as DTPA, according to Desreux &quot;et al&quot;. Auranofin, a chelate complex of gold, is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and penicillamine, which forms chelate complexes of copper, is used in the treatment of Wilson&#x27;s disease and cystinuria, as well as refractory rheumatoid arthritis.

=== Nutritional advantages and issues ===
Chelation in the intestinal tract is a cause of numerous interactions between drugs and metal ions (also known as &quot;minerals&quot; in nutrition). As examples, antibiotic drugs of the tetracycline and quinolone families are chelators of Fe2+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ ions.

EDTA, which binds to calcium, is used to alleviate the hypercalcemia that often results from band keratopathy. The calcium may then be removed from the cornea, allowing for some increase in clarity of vision for the patient.

Homogeneous catalysts are often chelated complexes. A representative example is the use of BINAP (a bidentate phosphine) in Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation and asymmetric isomerization. The latter has the practical use of manufacture of synthetic (–)-menthol.

=== Cleaning and water softening ===
A chelating agent is the main component of some rust removal formulations.
Citric acid is used to soften water in soaps and laundry detergents. A common synthetic chelator is EDTA. Phosphonates are also well-known chelating agents. Chelators are used in water treatment programs and specifically in steam engineering. Although the treatment is often referred to as &quot;softening&quot;, chelation has little effect on the water&#x27;s mineral content, other than to make it soluble and lower the water&#x27;s pH level.

=== Fertilizers ===
Metal chelate compounds are common components of fertilizers to provide micronutrients. These micronutrients (manganese, iron, zinc, copper) are required for the health of the plants. Most fertilizers contain phosphate salts that, in the absence of chelating agents, typically convert these metal ions into insoluble solids that are of no nutritional value to the plants. EDTA is the typical chelating agent that keeps these metal ions in a soluble form.

=== Economic situation ===
Because of their wide needs, the overall chelating agents growth was 4% annually during 2009–2014 and the trend is likely to increase. Aminopolycarboxylic acids chelators are the most widely consumed chelating agents; however, the percentage of the greener alternative chelators in this category continues to grow. The consumption of traditional aminopolycarboxylates chelators, in particular the EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid), is declining (−6% annually), because of the persisting concerns over their toxicity and negative environmental impact. In 2013, these greener alternative chelants represented approximately 15% of the total aminopolycarboxylic acids demand. This is expected to rise to around 21% by 2018, replacing and aminophosphonic acids used in cleaning applications. Examples of some Greener alternative chelating agents include ethylenediamine disuccinic acid (EDDS), polyaspartic acid (PASA), methylglycinediacetic acid (MGDA), glutamic diacetic acid (L-GLDA), citrate, gluconic acid, amino acids, plant extracts etc.

== Reversal ==
Dechelation (or de-chelation) is a reverse process of the chelation in which the chelating agent is recovered by acidifying solution with a mineral acid to form a precipitate.

<text>Ceefax () was the world&#x27;s first teletext information service and a forerunner to the current BBC Red Button service. Ceefax was started by the BBC in 1974 and ended, after 38 years of broadcasting, at 23:32:19 BST (11:32 PM BST) on 23 October 2012, in line with the digital switchover completion in Northern Ireland.

To receive a desired page of text on a teletext-capable receiver, the user entered a three-digit page number on the device. The selected page was displayed on the user&#x27;s screen as it was transmitted, requiring a wait of several seconds. There were many pages to choose from, and they could be displayed either on a black background or superimposed over the broadcast programme picture. This latter feature made it technically possible for the first time for British broadcasters to transmit subtitles that could be turned on or off by the viewer, rather than as part of the broadcast image.

==History==

===Early electro-mechanical system===

During the late 1960s, engineers Geoff Larkby and Barry Pyatt at the Designs Department (Television Group) of the BBC worked on an experimental analogue text transmission system. Its object was to transmit a printable page of text during the nocturnal &quot;close-down&quot; period of normal television transmission. Sir Hugh Carleton Greene, then Director General of the BBC, was interested in making farming and stock-market prices available as hard copy via the dormant TV transmitters. The remit received by BBC Designs Department was &quot;the equivalent of one page of &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper to be transmitted during shut-down&quot;.

Their system employed a modified rotating-drum facsimile transmitter designed by Alexander Muirhead, and Larkby &amp; Pyatt&#x27;s own, unique, design of hard-copy printer. This printer used pressure-sensitive &quot;till-roll&quot; paper passing over a drum with a raised helix of steel wire.

The drum was synchronised with the transmission drum by means of the &quot;Start of Page&quot;, and &quot;Start of Line&quot; information inherent in the Muirhead system. Printing was effected by a hardened steel blade driven by, initially, a loudspeaker-type moving coil, then by a printed-circuit coil, and finally by a special ceramic piezo element manufactured by Brush-Clevite. The combination of rotating helix and oscillating moving blade, with the till-roll paper moving linearly between them, enabled a raster to be drawn on the paper.

===Fully electronic version===

The idea was later taken up again, this time in digital and on-screen form, under the new name of CEEFAX, meaning &quot;see facts&quot;. The new system was announced in October 1972, and following test transmissions in 1972–74, the Ceefax system went live on 23 September 1974 with thirty pages of information. Created in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s by the Philips Lead Designer for VDUs John Adams, his design was given to the BBC so they could start transmission. The BBC were working on ways of providing televisual subtitles for deaf people, it was the first teletext system in the world. James Redmond, the BBC&#x27;s Director of Engineering at the time, was a particular enthusiast. Other broadcasters soon took up the idea, including the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), who had developed the incompatible ORACLE teletext system, at around the same time. Before the Internet and the World Wide Web became popular, Ceefax pages were often the first location to report a breaking story or headline.

After technical negotiations, the two broadcasters settled in 1974 on a single standard, different from both Ceefax and ORACLE, which ultimately developed into World System Teletext (1976), and which remained in use for analogue broadcasts until 2012. The display format of 24 rows by 40 columns of characters was also adopted for the Prestel system.

The technology became the standard European teletext system and replaced other standards, including the Antiope system formerly used in France.

Graham Clayton was its news executive and began working for Ceefax in 1978. In an interview with &quot;The Straits Times&quot;, he said that viewers got instant results for the recent snooker championships through its computers, rather than Oracle which had its reporter reading the scores through the telephone.

In 1983, Ceefax started to broadcast computer programs, known as telesoftware, for the BBC Micro (a home computer available in the United Kingdom). The telesoftware broadcasts stopped in 1989. A similar idea was the French C Plus Direct satellite channel which used different, higher speed technology to broadcast PC software.

The basic technology of Ceefax remained compatible with the 1976 unified rollout; system elaborations in later years were made such that earlier receivers were still able to do a basic decode of pages, but would simply ignore enhanced information rather than showing corrupted data.

===Closure===
Until 2012, the BBC&#x27;s Ceefax service was still providing information on topics covering News, Sport, Weather, TV Listings and Businesses. The pages were kept up to date until the UK digital switchover was completed on Tuesday 23 October 2012.

In 2002, the BBC stopped broadcasting Ceefax on the digital satellite Sky Digital service, but later brought back a limited service, including a TV schedule for BBC One and BBC Two; and subtitles.

The BBC has tried to reuse the old Ceefax page numbers where possible on the Freeview and digital satellite BBC Red Button Ceefax-replacement services.

It was announced that Ceefax would not be replaced when the analogue signal was switched off in October 2012. The BBC Red Button service was seen as an alternative to Ceefax and since 2007 the number of regions with a Ceefax-supported analogue signal had declined as digital switchover progressed across the UK. As of the end of 2011, three-quarters of the UK TV regions had completed or were in the process of being switched over.

Ceefax was the last remaining text service available via analogue TV transmissions in the UK, as ITV and Channel 4&#x27;s Teletext service closed in December 2009. Channel 5&#x27;s &quot;Five Text&quot; ancillary service closed in 2011. A limited analogue teletext service through ITV and Channel 4 was still available through terrestrial until the digital switchover was completed on 23 October 2012.

At 23:32:19 BST on 23 October 2012, Ceefax was switched off after 38 years of providing news, weather and sport information when the Olympic Games champion Dame Mary Peters turned off the last analogue TV signal in Northern Ireland. A series of graphics on Ceefax&#x27;s front page marked its 38 years on the BBC. BBC News&#x27; website also has memories of Ceefax.

In a tongue-in-cheek article on the 2017 general election, &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave political satirist Lord Buckethead a &quot;Best Policy&quot; award for the latter&#x27;s manifesto pledge to bring back Ceefax.

==BBC Red Button service==

The analogue switch-off in the UK saw the closure of Ceefax in October 2012. Its replacement, BBC Red Button, is available on most digital services including Freeview, Virgin Media, Sky and Freesat. BBC Red Button is accessed by pressing the red button or the text button on any BBC channel. As well as being able to display plain text, BBC Red Button offers richer graphics than Ceefax and a number of interactive video streams. Pages can be navigated to by scrolling with the remote or entering the correct page number; most of the page numbers previously used on Ceefax are the same on BBC Red Button, such as sports being on page number 301 with football on 302 and football results on 316. The new BBC Red Button Service is used as much as Ceefax and is especially popular among football fans.

In September 2019, the BBC announced that the Red Button service would be discontinued in 2020, which would&#x27;ve ended 45 years of text content delivery via TV broadcast in Britain. However, on 29 January 2020, one day before the scheduled date of shutdown, the BBC suspended its decision, pending a review into it, after there were protests concerning certain demographics of people – for example, the elderly – with regards to what impact the removal of the service would have on them.

The BBC Red Button service is currently seen on all BBC TV and BBC Radio channels.

==Technology==
The Ceefax/ORACLE standard was internationalised in the 1980s as World System Teletext, which was adopted into the international standard CCIR 653 (now ITU-R BT.653) of 1986 as CCIR Teletext System B. As with other teletext systems, text and simple graphics are transmitted in-band with the picture signal, and decoded by controller circuitry.

==Pages and content==
Pages were retrieved using a three-digit number. From the 1996 relaunch onwards, the main sections were organised as follows:

*100s – News
*200s – Business News
*300s – Sport
*400s – Weather and Travel (including 480 – Golf and 490 – Tennis)
*500s – Entertainment (including 555 – National Lottery results and 570 – Newsround)
*600s – TV and Radio Listings (including 660 – Horse Racing)
*888 – Subtitles

==&quot;Pages from Ceefax&quot;==

&quot;Pages from Ceefax&quot; was a selection of content from the Ceefax service and normally only shown in the absence of any other programming. It consisted of selected Ceefax pages transmitted as an ordinary TV picture, viewable on any receiver. Audio accompaniment consisted of stock music or sometimes a discontinuous tone. The limited set of rolling pages shown on &quot;Pages from Ceefax&quot; had been accessible at any time of day on teletext-equipped televisions on page 198 (BBC1) and 298 (BBC2), moving to page 196 in November 1992 and to page 152 in November 1996.

===Content===
Initially, the in-vision broadcasts featured a variety of different topics – news, sport, weather and BBC TV listings. Other topics would be included from time to time, such as financial news, travel news, a recipe and information about the BBC. In late 1989 the Ceefax service was relaunched as a news-focused service and the in-vision sequence became a news-only service plus a weather forecast. A headline page for business, sport and travel reappeared in 1992.

===In-vision history===
In-vision Ceefax was first shown in March 1980, originally in 30-minute slots and by mid-1983 it was a common filler during daytime downtime. Transmissions were originally billed on-air as &quot;Ceefax in Vision&quot; but daytime transmissions were not listed in the &quot;Radio Times&quot; until 7 January 1984, under the title of &quot;Pages from Ceefax&quot;.

On 28 February 1983, BBC1 started to air a selection of Ceefax pages every weekday morning at 6.00am called &quot;Ceefax AM&quot; which would lead into the start of &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; at 6.30am. It is first mentioned in the &quot;Radio Times&quot; on 21 March.

From May 1983, BBC1 began to transmit Ceefax pages during their daytime downtime periods. This continued until Friday 24 October 1986, three days before BBC1 launched a full daytime schedule, resulting in the only Ceefax transmission on BBC1 being the weekday 6.00am &quot;Ceefax AM&quot; broadcast.

From the late 1980s onwards, &quot;Pages from Ceefax&quot; was increasingly marginalised by the BBC&#x27;s move towards a near-continuous service, although BBC2 only gradually expanded its broadcasting hours when schools programming was not being shown. By the start of the 1990s, Ceefax broadcasts were shown once a day, and for periods of around 15–30 minutes. They were shown before the first programme of the day. When the BBC launched The Learning Zone in 1995, Ceefax was shown during overnight downtime on BBC Two for the first time, although latterly BBC News filled many of the late-night/early morning gaps in the schedules.

The last nationwide &quot;Pages from Ceefax&quot; broadcast on BBC1 was on 9 November 1997. However, occasional Ceefax broadcasts continued to be shown on BBC One Scotland, BBC One Wales and BBC One Northern Ireland as a filler between the end of an opt-out and rejoining the national network. On BBC Two, &quot;Pages from Ceefax&quot; continued to be broadcast until less than two days before the Ceefax service was closed down, the final transmission being in the early hours of Monday 22 October 2012 which featured special continuity announcements and a specially created end caption featuring various Ceefax graphics from over the years. The music chosen for the final minutes was &quot;BART&quot; by Ruby, which had been frequently used for &quot;Pages from Ceefax&quot; and for other continuity. Since then, overnight downtime has been filled with a rolling loop of previews of forthcoming BBC Two programmes.

===Similar services on other channels===
Channel 4 showed pages from Oracle from 1983 until 1989 and &quot;4-Tel On View&quot; from 1983 until 1997, and in the late 1980s and early 1990s, some ITV companies broadcast &quot;Jobfinder&quot;, which consisted of Teletext pages showing job vacancies and related information. &quot;ITV Nightscreen&quot; also used Teletext pages in its first few years on air. In its early days, Sky One showed in-vision pages from the Sky Text service during its overnight downtime.

==Teefax==
Teefax is a revamped version of Ceefax for the Raspberry Pi computer introduced in August 2016 by Peter Kwan. To view Teefax, enthusiasts connect a Raspberry Pi running appropriate software to the signal input of a Teletext-capable TV. Kwan said: &quot;It&#x27;s like the modern-day equivalent of restoring steam engines. It&#x27;s completely useless but it keeps us occupied.&quot; The service has 12 pages of up-to-date news and Kwan hopes to create an online archive of old teletext pages from Britain, Germany and France.

<text>Caramilk is a brand name used for two distinct chocolate bar products made by Cadbury. Both were introduced in 1968. The Canadian version of Caramilk is a milk chocolate bar filled with caramel. In Australia (also available in New Zealand, the UK and Ireland) the Caramilk brand is used for a caramelised white chocolate bar.

Similar chocolate bars to the Canadian version of Caramilk are marketed as Cadbury Caramello in the United States, as Cadbury Dairy Milk Caramello in Australia and New Zealand, and as Cadbury Dairy Milk Caramel in the UK.

==Canada==

===Variations===
Variations available, some of them limited editions, include Caramilk made with dark chocolate, maple flavoured, chocolate flavoured, or cappuccino. A thicker version called &quot;Caramilk Thick&quot; has also been introduced.

===Production===
Canadian Caramilk bars are produced at one location, the company&#x27;s Gladstone Chocolate Factory in Toronto.

===Ingredients===
Caramilk bars contain unsweetened chocolate and cocoa butter but are labelled as candy since only solid chocolate bars may be labelled as chocolate bars in Canada.

===Advertising campaigns===
One of the advertising campaigns for Caramilk bars revolved around the question of how the centre of the confection was put into the chocolate flavoured exterior. This theme led to the production of over fifteen separate television advertisements since the candy was introduced, making the series one of the most productive advertising efforts in Canadian history. The &quot;Caramilk Secret&quot; ad campaign was conceived by Gary Prouk when he was at Doyle Dane Bernbach. When Prouk left DDB to join Scali McCabe Sloves, the Cadbury account went with him. One notable advertisement involved two cone head aliens who were complimenting each other on successfully concealing the secret from humans, and also creating some of earth&#x27;s other long-standing works of wonder (e.g. the pyramids).

Another ad, featuring Leonardo da Vinci drawing the Mona Lisa as she eats a Caramilk, has won a Clio award.

===Similar products===

====Cadbury Dairy Milk Caramel====
In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, a bar similar in premise (caramel-filled chocolate) but differing slightly in taste, shape, ingredients and packaging is sold as Cadbury Dairy Milk Caramel.
====Cadbury Dairy Milk Caramello (Australia and New Zealand)====
In Australia and New Zealand, a caramel-filled milk chocolate covered bar similar to the Canadian and United Kingdom product is sold as the Caramello variant of the Cadbury Dairy Milk line of blocks.

====Cadbury Caramello (United States)====
In the United States, a similar bar (which has been produced under license by The Hershey Company since 1988)
is sold under the brand Cadbury&#x27;s Caramello. It gained popularity in the 1980s when advertising to children with the slogan, &quot;I was right in the middle of a Caramello when I found gold.&quot;

==Australia, New Zealand, UK and Ireland==
Australian Caramilk bars were introduced in 1968 and discontinued in 1994. The product was reintroduced in New Zealand as a limited edition of one million bars in 2017. The product was then reintroduced in Australia as a limited edition in 2018, 2019 and 2020. In 2021, the product was launched in the UK, and Ireland.

===Variations===
Variations available in Australia include a limited-edition Dairy Milk Caramilk Top Deck (a milk chocolate bar topped with Caramilk), Caramilk Marble (marbled milk chocolate and Caramilk with a hazelnut praline filling) and Caramilk flavoured Philadelphia cream cheese.

In 2020, Cadbury launched Caramilk Hokey Pokey in New Zealand; this consists of Caramilk with honeycomb toffee pieces.

<doc id="175654" wikidata="Q1983750" url="?curid=175654" title="Mainstream hardcore">
<text>Mainstream hardcore, mainstyle or nu style gabber is a subgenre of hardcore techno. The essence of mainstream hardcore sound is a distorted bass drum sound, overdriven to the point where it becomes clipped into a distorted square wave and makes a recognizably melodic tone.

Often the Roland Alpha Juno or the kick from a Roland TR-909 was used to create this sound. Mainstream hardcore tracks typically include samples and synthesized melodies with the typical tempo ranging from 165 to 180 bpm. Violence, drugs and profanity are common themes in mainstream hardcore, perceptible through its samples and lyrics, often screamed, pitch shifted, or distorted.

==History==

The mainstream hardcore sound derives from early hardcore (still called &quot;gabber&quot; at the time). In the late 1990s, early hardcore became less popular than Hardstyle. After surviving underground for a number of years, in 2002 Gabber regained some popularity in the Netherlands, although the sound is more mature, darker, and industrial. Some producers started embracing a slower style characterized by a deeper, harder bass drum that typically had a longer envelope than was possible in the traditional, faster style. In this aspect, this new form of gabber obviously cannot be considered less powerful than its precursor. This newer sound was referred to as &quot;New Style&quot; or &quot;Mainstream&quot; and as the tempo got slower and slower it began to become similar to Chicago hard house. Many hardcore enthusiasts hated Chicago hard house and the club scene it typified, and frequently DJs would be booed by one group of fans and cheered for by another at the same party, depending on the tempo and style of music they were playing. This is similar to the rivalry and mutual dislike that surfaced earlier between fans of &quot;regular&quot; hardcore and happy hardcore. Eventually the two styles met in the middle, and most gabber today is produced in a range of 160-180 bpm. This style is typically a bit slower than the Rotterdam style of the mid-1990s.
==Style==
Mainstream hardcore is characterized by its bass drum sound. Essentially, it comes from taking a normal synthesized bass drum and over-driving it heavily. The approximately sinusoidal sample starts to clip into a square wave with a falling pitch. This results in a number of effects: the frequency spectrum spreads out, thus achieving a louder, more aggressive sound. It also changes the amplitude envelope of the sound by increasing the sustain. Due to the distortion, the drum also develops a melodic tone. It is not uncommon for the bass drum pattern to change pitch throughout the song to follow the bass line. Many tracks rely on a clean, detuned supersaw lead, similar to uplifting trance and can therefore sound &quot;happy&quot;.

<doc id="175656" wikidata="Q750670" url="?curid=175656" title="Lady Chatterley's Lover">
<text>Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover is the final novel by English author D. H. Lawrence, which was first published privately in 1928, in Florence, Italy, and in 1929, in Paris, France. An unexpurgated edition was not published openly in the United Kingdom until 1960, when it was the subject of a watershed obscenity trial against the publisher Penguin Books, which won the case and quickly sold three million copies. The book was also banned for obscenity in the United States, Canada, Australia, India and Japan. The book soon became notorious for its story of the physical (and emotional) relationship between a working-class man and an upper-class woman, its explicit descriptions of sex and its use of then-unprintable profane words. It entered the public domain in the United States in 2024.

==Background==
Lawrence&#x27;s life, including his wife, Frieda, and his childhood in Nottinghamshire, influenced the novel. According to some critics, the fling of Lady Ottoline Morrell with &quot;Tiger&quot;, a young stonemason who came to carve plinths for her garden statues, also influenced the story. Lawrence, who had once considered calling the novel &quot;John Thomas and Lady Jane&quot; in reference to the male and the female sex organs, made significant alterations to the text and story in the process of its composition.

Lawrence allegedly read the manuscript of &quot;Maurice&quot; by E. M. Forster, which was written in 1914 but published posthumously in 1971. That novel, although it is about a homosexual couple, also involves a gamekeeper becoming the lover of a member of the upper classes and influenced &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;.

==Plot==
The story concerns a young married woman, the former Constance Reid (Lady Chatterley), whose upper-class baronet husband, Sir Clifford Chatterley, described as a handsome, well-built man, is paralysed from the waist down because of a Great War injury. Constance has an affair with the gamekeeper, Oliver Mellors. The class difference between the couple highlights a major motif of the novel. The central theme is Constance&#x27;s realisation that she cannot live with the mind alone. That realisation stems from a heightened sexual experience that Constance has felt only with Mellors, suggesting that love requires the elements of both body and mind. 
==Characters==
Lady Chatterley (Connie): The main character of the novel. Connie, who is an intellectual and socially progressive, distances herself from her cold and passionless husband after marrying Sir Clifford Chatterley. She falls in love with the gamekeeper Oliver Mellors and establishes a sexual bond with him. She matures as a sensual being and eventually leaves her husband.

Oliver Mellors: The gamekeeper at Clifford Chatterley&#x27;s estate. Cold, intelligent, and noble in spirit, Mellors escapes a miserable marriage and lives a quiet life. His relationship with Connie rekindles his passion for life. At the end of the novel, he plans to marry Connie.

Sir Clifford Chatterley: Connie&#x27;s wealthy, but paralyzed and impotent husband. Clifford, who is a successful writer and businessman, is emotionally cold and focused on material success. He is dependent on his nurse, Mrs. Bolton, and looks down on the lower classes.

Mrs. Bolton (Ivy Bolton): Clifford&#x27;s nurse. She is a middle-aged, complex, and intelligent woman. Her husband died in an accident in the mines owned by Clifford&#x27;s family. Mrs. Bolton both admires and despises Clifford, and their relationship is intricate.

Michaelis: A successful Irish playwright. He has a brief relationship with Connie and proposes to her, but Connie sees him as a slave to success and devoid of passion.

Hilda Reid: Connie&#x27;s older sister by two years. Hilda shares the same intellectual upbringing as Connie, but she looks down on Connie&#x27;s relationship with Mellors due to his lower-class status. However, she eventually supports Connie.

Sir Malcolm Reid: The father of Connie and Hilda. He is a renowned painter and a sensual aesthete. He finds Clifford weak and immediately warms to Mellors.

Tommy Dukes: Clifford&#x27;s friend and a brigadier general in the British army. He talks about the importance of sensuality but is personally detached from sexuality, only engaging in intellectual discussions.

Charles May, Hammond, Berry: Clifford&#x27;s young intellectual friends. They visit Wragby and participate in meaningless discussions about love and sex.

Duncan Forbes: Connie and Hilda&#x27;s artist friend. He paints abstract art, and at one point was in love with Connie. Connie initially claims she is pregnant with his child.

Bertha Coutts: Mellors&#x27; wife. Although she doesn&#x27;t appear in the novel, her presence is felt. Separated from Mellors due to sexual incompatibility, she spreads rumors about Mellors, leading to his dismissal from his job.

Squire Winter: A relative of Clifford. He strongly believes in the old privileges of the aristocracy.

Daniele and Giovanni: Venetian gondoliers who serve Hilda and Connie. Giovanni hopes the women will pay him to sleep with them, but he is disappointed. Daniele reminds Connie of Mellors, as he is seen as a &quot;real man.&quot;

== Themes ==
=== Mind and body ===
Richard Hoggart argues that the main subject of &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; is not the explicit sexuality, which was the subject of much debate, but the search for integrity and wholeness. Key to this integrity is cohesion between the mind and the body, for &quot;body without mind is brutish; mind without body... is a running away from our double being&quot;. &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; focuses on the incoherence of living a life that is &quot;all mind&quot;, which Lawrence found to be particularly true among the young members of the aristocratic classes, as in his description of Constance&#x27;s and her sister Hilda&#x27;s &quot;tentative love-affairs&quot; in their youth:

The contrast between mind and body can be seen in the dissatisfaction each character experiences in their previous relationships, such as Constance&#x27;s lack of intimacy with her husband, who is &quot;all mind&quot;, and Mellors&#x27;s choice to live apart from his wife because of her &quot;brutish&quot; sexual nature. The dissatisfactions lead them into a relationship that develops very slowly and is based upon tenderness, physical passion, and mutual respect. As the relationship between Lady Chatterley and Mellors builds, they learn more about the interrelation of the mind and the body. She learns that sex is more than a shameful and disappointing act, and he learns about the spiritual challenges that come from physical love.

Jenny Turner maintained in &quot;The Sexual Imagination from Acker to Zola: A Feminist Companion&quot; (1993) that the publication of &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; broke &quot;the taboo on explicit representations of sexual acts in British and North American literature&quot;. She described the novel as &quot;a book of great libertarian energy and heteroerotic beauty&quot;.

=== Class ===
&quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; also presents some views on the early-20th-century British social context. That is most evidently seen in the plot on the affair of an aristocratic woman (Connie) with a working-class man (Mellors). That is heightened when Mellors adopts the local broad Derbyshire dialect, something he can slip into and out of. The critic and writer Mark Schorer writes of the forbidden love of a woman of relatively superior social situation who is drawn to an &quot;outsider&quot;, a man of a lower social rank or a foreigner. He considers that to be a familiar construction in Lawrence&#x27;s works in which the woman either resists her impulse or yields to it. Schorer believes that the two possibilities were embodied, respectively, in the situation into which Lawrence was born and that into which Lawrence married, which becomes a favourite topic in his work.

There is a clear class divide between the inhabitants of Wragby and Tevershall that is bridged by the nurse Mrs Bolton. Clifford is more self assured in his position, but Connie is often thrown when the villagers treat her as a Lady like when she has tea in the village. This is often made explicit in the narration such as here:

There are also signs of dissatisfaction and resentment from the Tevershall coal pit colliers, whose fortunes are in decline, against Clifford, who owns the mines. Involved with hard, dangerous and health-threatening employment, the unionised and self-supporting pit-village communities in Britain have been home to more pervasive class barriers than has been the case in other industries (for an example, see chapter 2 of &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot; by George Orwell.) They were also centres of widespread Nonconformism (Non-Anglican Protestantism), which hold proscriptive views on sexual sins such as adultery. References to the concepts of anarchism, socialism, communism and capitalism permeate the book. Union strikes were also a constant preoccupation in Wragby Hall.

Coal mining is a recurrent and familiar theme in Lawrence&#x27;s life and writing because of his background, and it is prominent also in &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot; and &quot;Women in Love&quot; and short stories such as &quot;Odour of Chrysanthemums&quot;.

=== Industrialisation and nature ===
As in much of the rest of Lawrence&#x27;s fiction, a key theme is the contrast between the vitality of nature and the mechanised monotony of mining and industrialism. Clifford wants to reinvigorate the mines with new technology and is out of touch with the natural world. In contrast, Connie often appreciates the beauty of nature and sees the ugliness of the mines in Uthwaite. Her heightened sensual appreciation applies to both nature and her sexual relationship with Mellors.

== Censorship ==
A publisher&#x27;s note in the 2001 Random House Inc. edition of the novel states that Lawrence &quot;was unable to secure a commercial publication [of] the novel in its unexpurgated form&quot;. The author privately published the novel in 2000 copies to his subscribers in England, the United States and France in 1928. Later that same year, the second edition was privately published in 200 copies. Then, pirated copies of the novel were made.

An edition of the novel was published in Britain in 1932 by Martin Secker, two years after Lawrence&#x27;s death. Reviewing it in &quot;The Observer&quot;, the journalist Gerald Gould noted that &quot;passages are necessarily omitted to which the author undoubtedly attached supreme psychological importance—importance so great, that he was willing to face obloquy and misunderstanding and censorship because of them&quot;. An authorised and heavily censored abridgment was published in the United States by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. also in 1932. That edition was subsequently reissued in paperback in the United States by Signet Books in 1946.

=== British obscenity trial ===

In November 1960, the full unexpurgated edition, the last of three versions written by Lawrence, was published by Penguin Books in Britain, selling its first print run of 200,000 copies on the first day of publication.&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian.com/books/quiz&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial of Penguin under the Obscene Publications Act 1959 was a major public event and a test of the new obscenity law. The 1959 Act, introduced by Roy Jenkins, had made it possible for publishers to escape conviction if they could show that a work was of literary merit. One of the objections was to the frequent use of the word &quot;fuck&quot; and its derivatives. Another objection related to the use of the word &quot;cunt&quot;.

Various academic critics and experts of diverse kinds, including E. M. Forster, Helen Gardner, Richard Hoggart, Raymond Williams and Norman St John-Stevas, were called as witnesses. The verdict, delivered on 2 November 1960, was &quot;not guilty&quot; and resulted in a far greater degree of freedom for publishing explicit material in the United Kingdom. The prosecution was ridiculed for being out of touch with changing social norms when the chief prosecutor, Mervyn Griffith-Jones, asked if it was the kind of book &quot;you would wish your wife or servants to read&quot;.

The Penguin second edition, published in 1961, contains a publisher&#x27;s dedication, which reads: &quot;For having published this book, Penguin Books was prosecuted under the Obscene Publications Act, 1959 at the Old Bailey in London from 20 October to 2 November 1960. This edition is therefore dedicated to the twelve jurors, three women and nine men, who returned a verdict of &#x27;not guilty&#x27; and thus made D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s last novel available for the first time to the public in the United Kingdom&quot;.

In 2006, the trial was dramatized by BBC Wales as &quot;The Chatterley Affair&quot;.

=== Australia ===
The book was banned in Australia, and a book describing the British trial, &quot;The Trial of Lady Chatterley&quot;, was also banned. In 1965 a copy of the British edition was smuggled into the country by Alexander William Sheppard, Leon Fink, and Ken Buckley, and then a run of 10,000 copies was printed and sold nationwide. The fallout from that event eventually led to the easing of censorship of books in the country. The ban by the Department of Customs and Excise on &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;, along with three other books—&quot;Borstal Boy&quot;, &quot;Confessions of a Spent Youth&quot;, and &quot;Lolita&quot;—was lifted in July 1965. The Australian Classification Board, established in 1970, remains.

=== Canada ===

In 1962, McGill University Professor of Law and Canadian modernist poet F. R. Scott appeared before the Supreme Court of Canada to defend &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; from censorship. Scott represented the appellants, who were booksellers who had been offering the book for sale.

The case arose when the police had seized their copies of the book and deposited them with a judge of the Court of Sessions of the Peace, who issued a notice to the booksellers to show cause why the books should not be confiscated as obscene, contrary to s 150A of the Criminal Code. The trial judge eventually ruled that the book was obscene and ordered that the copies be confiscated. That decision was upheld by the Quebec Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench, Appeal Side (now the Quebec Court of Appeal).

Scott then appealed the case to the Supreme Court of Canada, which allowed the appeal on a 5–4 split and held that the book was not an obscene publication.

On 15 November 1960, an Ontario panel of experts, appointed by Attorney General Kelso Roberts, found that novel was not obscene according to the Canadian Criminal Code.

=== United States ===

&quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; was banned for obscenity in the United States in 1929. In 1930, Senator Bronson Cutting proposed an amendment to the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act, which was being debated, to end the practice of having U.S. Customs censor allegedly obscene imported books. Senator Reed Smoot vigorously opposed such an amendment and threatened to read indecent passages of imported books publicly in front of the Senate. Although he never followed through, he included &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; as an example of an obscene book that must not reach domestic audiences and declared, &quot;I&#x27;ve not taken ten minutes on &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;, outside of looking at its opening pages. It is most damnable! It is written by a man with a diseased mind and a soul so black that he would obscure even the darkness of hell!&quot;

A 1955 French film version, based on the novel and released by Kingsley Pictures, was the subject of attempted censorship in New York in 1959 on the grounds that it promoted adultery. The US Supreme Court held on 29 June 1959 that the law prohibiting its showing was a violation of the First Amendment&#x27;s protection of free speech.

The ban on &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;, &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; and &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; was fought and overturned in court with assistance by publisher Barney Rosset and lawyer Charles Rembar in 1959. It was then published by Rosset&#x27;s Grove Press, with the complete opinion by United States Court of Appeals Judge Frederick van Pelt Bryan, which first established the standard of &quot;redeeming social or literary value&quot; as a defence against obscenity charges. Fred Kaplan of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated the overturning of the obscenity laws &quot;set off an explosion of free speech&quot;.

Susan Sontag, in a 1961 essay in &quot;The Supplement&quot; to the &quot;Columbia Spectator&quot; that was republished in &quot;Against Interpretation&quot; (1966), dismissed &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; as a &quot;sexually reactionary&quot; book and suggested that the importance given to vindicating it showed that the US was &quot;plainly at a very elementary stage of sexual maturity&quot;.

=== Japan ===

The publication of a full translation of &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; by Sei Itō in 1950 led to a famous obscenity trial in Japan that extended from 8 May 1951 to 18 January 1952, with appeals lasting to 13 March 1957. Several notable literary figures testified for the defence. The trial ultimately ended in a guilty verdict with a ¥100,000 fine for Ito and a ¥250,000 fine for his publisher.

=== India ===
In 1964, the bookseller Ranjit Udeshi in Bombay was prosecuted under Section 292 of the Indian Penal Code (sale of obscene books) for selling an unexpurgated copy of &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;.

&quot;Ranjit D. Udeshi v. State of Maharashtra&quot; (AIR 1965 SC 881) was eventually laid before a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India. Chief Justice Hidayatullah declared the law on the subject of when a book can be regarded as obscene and established important tests of obscenity such as the Hicklin test.

The court upheld the conviction:

== Cultural influence ==
In the United States, the full publication of &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; was a significant event in the &quot;sexual revolution&quot;. The book was then a topic of widespread discussion and a byword of sorts. In 1965, Tom Lehrer recorded a satirical song, &quot;Smut&quot;, in which the speaker in the song lyrics cheerfully acknowledges his enjoyment of such material; &quot;Who needs a hobby like tennis or philately?/I&#x27;ve got a hobby: rereading &quot;Lady Chatterley&quot;&quot;.

The British poet Philip Larkin&#x27;s poem &quot;Annus Mirabilis&quot; begins with a reference to the trial:

In 1976, the story was parodied by Morecambe and Wise on their BBC sketch show. A &quot;play what Ernie wrote&quot;, &quot;The Handyman and M&#x27;Lady&quot;, was obviously based on it, with Michele Dotrice as the Lady Chatterley figure. Introducing it, Ernie explained that his play &quot;concerns a rich, titled young lady who is deprived of love, caused by her husband falling into a combine harvester, which unfortunately makes him impudent&quot;.

In the 1998 film &quot;Pleasantville&quot;, a film that narrativizes conservative cultural nostalgia for the 1950s as a response to the sexual revolution of the 1960s, Jennifer (played by Reese Witherspoon) reads &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; as a principal part of her character development, causing her to become &quot;colored&quot;, the film&#x27;s metaphor for personal growth and transformation.

A 2007 episode of Mad Men saw Joan, Peggy, and other women in the office discuss &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;. It is spoken of in scandalous tones and Joan remarks that the pages &#x27;just fall open&#x27; to presumably the most salacious portions of the book.

A 2020 episode of &quot;Ghosts&quot; had Fanny (a ghost and the former lady of the manor from the Edwardian era) reading the book, and then developing feelings for Mike (the alive husband of her descendant, whom she otherwise thinks of as uncouth and uncultured) while he does garden work. Any pretenses of a full relationship are dashed, however, when she sees him slovenly eating a plate of nachos.

&quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; is also mentioned by characters in Meyer Levin&#x27;s novel &quot;Compulsion&quot;.

;Use of character

=== Radio ===
&quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; has been adapted for BBC Radio 4 by Michelene Wandor and was first broadcast in September 2006.

=== Theatre ===

Lawrence&#x27;s novel was successfully dramatised for the stage in a three-act play by British playwright John Harte. Although produced at the Arts Theatre in London in 1961 (and elsewhere later on), his play was written in 1953. It was the only D.H. Lawrence novel ever to be staged, and his dramatisation was the only one to be read and approved by Lawrence&#x27;s widow, Frieda. Despite her attempts to obtain the copyright for Harte to have his play staged in the 1950s, Baron Philippe de Rothschild did not relinquish the dramatic rights until his film version was released in France.

Only the Old Bailey trial against Penguin Books for alleged obscenity in publishing the unexpurgated paperback edition of the novel prevented the play&#x27;s transfer to the much bigger Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre, for which it had already been licensed by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office on 12 August 1960 with passages censored. It was fully booked out for its limited run at the Arts Theatre and well reviewed by Harold Hobson, the prevailing West End theatre critic of the time.

A new stage version, adapted and directed by Philip Breen and produced by the English Touring Theatre and Sheffield Theatres, opened at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, between 21 September and 15 October 2016, before touring the UK until November 2016.

==Parody==

&quot;MAD Magazine&quot; published in 1963 a spoof called &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Chopped Liver And Other Recipes&quot;.

Comedian Spike Milligan parodied the story in his &quot;According to Spike Milligan&quot; series, under the title of &quot;D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s John Thomas and Lady Jane – Part II of Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;.

<doc id="175662" wikidata="Q108247" url="?curid=175662" title="Dinant">
<text>Dinant () is a city and municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Namur, Belgium. On the shores of river Meuse, in the Ardennes, it lies south-east of Brussels, south-east of Charleroi and south of the city of Namur. Dinant is situated north of the border with France.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Anseremme, Bouvignes-sur-Meuse, Dinant, Dréhance, Falmagne, Falmignoul, Foy-Notre-Dame, Furfooz, Lisogne, Sorinnes and Thynes.

==Geography==
Dinant is positioned in the Upper Meuse valley, at a point where the river cuts deeply into the western Condroz plateau. Sited in a steep-sided valley, between the rock face and the river, the original settlement had little space in which to grow away from the river, and it therefore expanded into a long, thin town, on a north–south axis, along the river shore. During the 19th century, the former &quot;Île des Batteurs&quot; (Drummers&#x27; Island) to the south was attached directly to the town when a branch of the Meuse was filled in.

Dinant has been enriched by the agricultural opportunities presented by the fertile land on the plateau that overlooks it. Within the town, brassware production is a traditional craft that has benefited from the presence of the broad and, at this point, easily navigable river which has facilitated easy delivery of the raw materials and ready distribution of the resulting products of the artisans&#x27; workshops. Another traditional source of wealth is provided by the limestone cliffs overlooking the town, which supported a high-end quarrying industry, producing black marble and bluestone, and whose distribution also benefited from the proximity of the relatively wide and deep navigable river.

==History==

===Origins to the 10th century===
The name Dinant comes from the Celtic &quot;Divo-Nanto&quot;, meaning &quot;Sacred Valley&quot; or &quot;Divine Valley&quot;; it can also be translated as &quot;Celestial Gorge&quot; or &quot;Luminous Gorge&quot; (as in modern Welsh &quot;Nant Dwyfol&quot;).

The Dinant area was already populated in Neolithic, Celtic, and Roman times. The first mention of Dinant as a settlement dates from the 7th century, when Perpète of Maastricht, Bishop of Tongeren, moved his principal residence from Maastricht to Dinant and founded the church of Saint Vincent.

Dinant was a part of the Frankish kingdom of Middle Francia from its creation in 843 by the Treaty of Verdun until its dissolution in 855 with the Treaty of Prüm. Like most of Middle Francia, Dinant then became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Lotharingia within the Carolingian Empire. The Kingdom of Lotharingia was abolished in 869-870 and was divided by the Treaty of Meerssen in 870. With this, Dinant passed to West Francia, ruled by king Charles the Bald. With this passing of territory, he gave part of Dinant to be administered by the Count of Namur, with the rest as a part of the Bishopric of Tongeren, which was by that time based in Liège. West Francia eventually lost significant territory and no longer contained Dinant by the 10th century.

In the 11th century, the emperor Henry IV granted several rights over Dinant to the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, including market and justice rights. From that time on, the city became one of the 23 ‘‘bonnes villes’’ (or principal cities) of the Prince-Bishopric. The first stone bridge on the Meuse and major repair to the castle, which had been built earlier, also date from the end of the 11th century. Throughout this period, and until the end of the 18th century, Dinant shared its history with its overlord Liège, sometimes rising in revolt against it, sometimes partaking in its victories and defeats, mostly against the neighbouring County of Namur.

===Late Middle Ages===
Its strategic location on the Meuse exposed Dinant to battle and pillage, not always by avowed enemies: in 1466, Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, uncle of Louis de Bourbon, Prince-Bishop of Liège, and Philip’s son Charles the Bold punished an uprising in Dinant during the Liège Wars, by casting 800 burghers into the Meuse and setting fire to the city. The city&#x27;s economic rival was Bouvignes, downriver on the opposite shore of the Meuse.

Late Medieval Dinant and Bouvignes specialised in metalwork, producing finely cast and finished objects in a silvery brass alloy, called &quot;dinanderie&quot; and supplying aquamaniles, candlesticks, patens and other altar furniture throughout the Meuse valley (giving these objects their cautious designation &quot;Mosan&quot;), the Rhineland and beyond.

Henri Pirenne gained his doctorate in 1883 with a thesis on medieval Dinant.

===The Old Regime and World War I===


In the 16th- and 17th-century wars between France and Spain, Dinant suffered destruction, famine, and epidemics, despite its neutrality. In 1675, the French army under Marshal François de Créquy occupied the city. Dinant was briefly taken by the Austrians at the end of the 18th century. The whole Bishopric of Liège was ceded to France in 1795. The &quot;dinanderies&quot; fell out of fashion and the economy of the city now rested on leather tanning and the manufacture of playing cards. The famous &quot;couques de Dinant&quot; also appeared at that time.

The city suffered devastation again at the beginning of the First World War. On 15 August 1914, French and German troops fought for the town in the Battle of Dinant; among the wounded was Lieut. Charles de Gaulle. On 23 August, 674 inhabitants were summarily executed by Saxon troops of the German Army – the largest massacre committed by the Germans in 1914. Within a month, some five thousand Belgian and French civilians were killed by the Germans at numerous similar occasions.

===World War II===
During World War II, the city was again captured by German forces during the invasion of Belgium. German forces of Erwin Rommel&#x27;s 7th Panzer Division took the town on 13 May 1940, after crossing the River Meuse and defeating the French forces defending the town.

==Sights==
*The city&#x27;s landmark is the Collegiate Church of Notre Dame de Dinant. It was rebuilt in Gothic style on its old foundations after falling rocks from the adjacent cliff partially destroyed the former Romanesque-style church in 1227. Several stages for a pair of towers on the west end were completed before the project was abandoned in favour of the present central tower with a famous onion dome and facetted multi-staged lantern.
*Above the church rises the vertical flank of the &quot;rocher&quot; surmounted by the fortified Citadel of Dinant that was first built in the 11th century to control the Meuse valley. The Prince-Bishopric of Liège rebuilt and enlarged it in 1530; the French destroyed it in 1703. Its present aspect, with the 408-step rock-hewn stairs, is due to rebuilding in 1821, during the United Kingdom of the Netherlands phase of Dinant&#x27;s chequered history. A cable car is available during the high season to take visitors from the Collegiate Church of Notre-Dame to the top of the Citadel.
*Away from the main block is the &quot;Rocher Bayard&quot; that was said to have been split by the giant hoof of Bayard, the giant horse carrying the four sons of Duke Aymon on their legendary flight from Charlemagne through the Ardennes, told in &quot;Les Quatre Fils Aymon&quot;, a famous 12th-century &quot;chanson de geste&quot;. In reality the rock was split by the soldiers of Louis XIV after the conquest of Dinant in order to construct a road alongside the Meuse. 
*The house of Adolphe Sax, inventor of the saxophone, in the street of the same name. A little museum, Mr Sax&#x27;s House, commemorates his life and saxophones.
*Grotte de Dinant La Merveilleuse, a series of caves with impressive stalagmite and stalactite structures, is near the south west of the town.

== Gastronomic culture ==

*The &quot;Flamiche&quot; dinantaise is the local version of &quot;quiche&quot; made with a cheese called &quot;boulette de Romedenne&quot;.
*The &quot;couque de Dinant&quot; is Europe&#x27;s hardest biscuit, with a honey-sweetened flavour that is impressed with a carved wooden mould before baking.
*The beer brand &quot;Leffe&quot; originates from Dinant and there is a museum there.

== Transport ==
Dinant&#x27;s railway station is on the left bank of the river. There is hourly train service to Brussels, about a 90-minute ride.

== Healthcare ==
Dinant hosts the &quot;Saint-Vincent&quot; and &quot;Saint-Anne&quot; sites (Centre Hospitalier de Dinant) of the CHU UCLouvain Namur university hospital, the provinces&#x27; largest employer and serving as teaching hospital for the University of Louvain.

== Notable people ==

*David of Dinant, philosopher (birth in Dinant is uncertain, 12th century)
*Joachim Patinir or Patenier, 1485–1524, the first specialist landscape painter
*Antoine Joseph Wiertz, painter (19th century)
*Adolphe Sax, musician and inventor of many instruments, including the saxophone and Saxtuba (19th century)

<doc id="175668" wikidata="Q511591" url="?curid=175668" title="Get Carter">
<text>Get Carter is a 1971 British gangster thriller film, written and directed by Mike Hodges in his directorial debut and starring Michael Caine, Ian Hendry, John Osborne, Britt Ekland and Bryan Mosley. Based on Ted Lewis&#x27;s 1970 novel &quot;Jack&#x27;s Return Home&quot;, the film follows the eponymous Jack Carter (Caine), a London gangster who returns to his hometown in North East England after his brother&#x27;s death. Suspecting foul play, and with vengeance on his mind, he investigates and interrogates, regaining a feel for the city and its hardened-criminal element.

Producer Michael Klinger optioned Lewis&#x27;s novel shortly after its publication and made a deal with the ailing Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) to finance and release the film, making &quot;Get Carter&quot; the last project to be approved by the studio&#x27;s Borehamwood division before its closure. The production went from novel to finished film in 10 months, with principal photography taking place from July to September 1970 in and around Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead and County Durham. Hodges, Klinger and Caine intended to create a more realistic portrayal of violence and criminal behaviour than had previously been seen in British films: Caine, who also served as an uncredited co-producer, incorporated aspects of criminal acquaintances into his characterisation of Carter, while Hodges conducted research into the criminal underworld of Newcastle, in particular the one-armed bandit murder. Cinematographer Wolfgang Suschitzky worked with Hodges to give scenes a naturalistic feel, drawing heavily on their backgrounds in documentary films.

Turning a respectable profit upon its initial UK release, &quot;Get Carter&quot; initially attracted mixed reviews. Critics grudgingly appreciated the film&#x27;s technical achievements and Caine&#x27;s performance while criticising the complex plot, violence and amorality, in particular Carter&#x27;s apparent lack of remorse for his actions. American critics were generally more enthusiastic, but the film languished on the drive-in circuit, while MGM focused its resources on producing &quot;Hit Man&quot;, a 1972 blaxploitation-themed remake of the film.

&quot;Get Carter&quot; eventually garnered a cult following, and further endorsements from directors such as Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie led to the film being critically re-evaluated, with its depiction of class structure and life in 1970s Britain and Roy Budd&#x27;s minimalist jazz score receiving considerable praise. In 1999, &quot;Get Carter&quot; was ranked 16th on the BFI Top 100 British films of the 20th century; five years later, a survey of British film critics in &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine chose it as the greatest British film of all time. A poorly received second remake under the same title was released in 2000, with Sylvester Stallone portraying Jack Carter and Caine in a supporting role.

==Plot==
Newcastle-born gangster Jack Carter has lived in London for years in the employ of organised crime bosses Gerald and Sid Fletcher. Jack is having an affair with Gerald&#x27;s girlfriend Anna and plans to escape with her to South America, but he must first return to Newcastle and Gateshead to attend the funeral of his brother, Frank, who died in a purported drink-driving accident. Jack&#x27;s bosses warn him not to stir up trouble, as they are friendly with the Newcastle mob. Unsatisfied with the official explanation, Jack investigates for himself. At the funeral, Jack meets his teenage niece Doreen, and Frank&#x27;s evasive mistress, Margaret.

Jack goes to Newcastle Racecourse, seeking his old acquaintance Albert Swift for information about his brother&#x27;s death, but Swift evades him. Jack encounters another old associate, Eric Paice, who refuses to tell Jack who is employing him as a chauffeur. Tailing Eric leads him to the country house of crime boss Cyril Kinnear. Jack confronts Kinnear but learns little from him; he also meets a glamorous drunken woman, Glenda. As Jack leaves, Eric warns him against damaging relations between Kinnear and the Fletchers. Back in town, Jack is threatened by henchmen who want him to leave town, but he fights them off, capturing and interrogating one to find out who wants him gone. He is told the name &quot;Brumby&quot;.

Jack knows Cliff Brumby as a businessman with controlling interests in local seaside amusement arcades. Visiting Brumby&#x27;s house, Jack discovers the man knows nothing about him and, believing he has been set up, he leaves. The next morning, two of Jack&#x27;s London colleagues – Con McCarthy and Peter the Dutchman – arrive, sent by the Fletchers to take him back, but he escapes. Jack meets Margaret to talk about Frank, but the Fletchers&#x27; men are waiting and pursue him. He is rescued by Glenda, who takes him in her Sunbeam Alpine sports car to meet Brumby at his new restaurant development at the top of a multi-storey car park. Brumby identifies Kinnear as being behind Frank&#x27;s death, also explaining that Kinnear is trying to take over his business. He offers Jack £5,000 to kill the crime boss, which he refuses.

Jack has sex with Glenda at her flat, where he finds and watches a pornographic film called &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot;, in which Doreen is forced to have sex with Albert. The other participants in the film are Glenda and Margaret. Jack becomes enraged and pushes Glenda&#x27;s head underwater as she is taking a bath. She tells him the film was Kinnear&#x27;s and that she thinks Doreen was pulled into the production by Eric. Forcing Glenda into the boot of her own car, Jack drives off to find Albert.

Jack tracks down Albert, who confesses he told Brumby that Doreen was Frank&#x27;s daughter. Brumby showed Frank the film to incite him to call the police on Kinnear so Eric and two of his men arranged Frank&#x27;s death. Having extracted this information, Jack fatally stabs Albert. Jack is attacked by the London gangsters and Eric, who has informed Fletcher of Jack and Anna&#x27;s affair. In the ensuing shootout, Jack kills Peter. As Eric and Con escape, they push the sports car into the river, unaware that Glenda is in the boot. Returning to the car park, Jack finds and beats Brumby before throwing him to his death. He then posts the film to the Scotland Yard vice squad.

Jack abducts Margaret. He telephones Kinnear (who is in the middle of a wild party at his home), telling him that he has the film, and makes a deal for Kinnear to give him Eric in exchange for his silence. Kinnear agrees, sending Eric to an agreed location; however, he subsequently phones an associate. Jack drives Margaret to the grounds of Kinnear&#x27;s estate, kills her with a fatal injection, and leaves her body there. He then calls the police to raid Kinnear&#x27;s party.

Jack chases Eric along a beach. He forces Eric to drink a bottle of whisky as Eric had done to Frank, then beats him to death with his shotgun. Having avenged Frank and Doreen, Jack walks along the shoreline, where he is shot dead from a distance by Kinnear&#x27;s associate.

==Cast==
* Michael Caine as Jack Carter. Mike Hodges wrote the screenplay with Ian Hendry in mind for Carter, but learned that Michael Klinger had already signed up Caine for the role. With the backing of a major studio, Klinger was keen to secure a big name for the lead, and Caine was very prominent at the time, having starred in &quot;Alfie&quot;, &quot;The Italian Job&quot; and &quot;The Ipcress File&quot;. Hodges was surprised that a star of Caine&#x27;s stature would want to play such a thoroughly unlikeable person as Carter. Giving his reasons for wanting to be involved with the film, the actor said &quot;One of the reasons I wanted to make that picture was my background. In English movies, gangsters were either stupid or funny. I wanted to show that they&#x27;re neither. Gangsters are not stupid, and they&#x27;re certainly not very funny&quot;. He identified with Carter as a memory of his working-class upbringing, having friends and family members who were involved in crime and felt Carter represented a path his life might have taken under different circumstances: &quot;Carter is the dead-end product of my own environment, my childhood; I know him well. He is the ghost of Michael Caine&quot;. He made subtle changes to Hodges&#x27; depiction of Carter in the script, cut out pleasantries and gave him a cold, hard edge; closer to Lewis&#x27;s original envisioning of the character. Although he is not credited as such in the film, Caine has been acknowledged in retrospect as a co-producer. By a strange coincidence, Caine&#x27;s stand-in on the film was a man called Jack Carter.
* Ian Hendry as Eric Paice. Hendry had previously been cast by producer Klinger in Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Repulsion&quot;, and was Hodges&#x27; first choice to play Carter, but by 1970 his career was rapidly declining. Hendry&#x27;s alcoholism and poor physical condition were apparent on set in Newcastle, and his envy at the success of his contemporary Caine was exacerbated by his drinking. Hodges and Caine used his animosity towards Caine to their advantage to create extra tension in the scenes between Carter and Paice.
* John Osborne as Cyril Kinnear, Jack&#x27;s main adversary. Osborne, a famous playwright, was an unusual choice of actor; he was suggested by Hodges&#x27; agent. The writer enjoyed the change, and saw it as a way to erase the image in the public&#x27;s mind of him as an angry young man. Osborne had never played card games before and practised poker before the shoot to lend realism to the gambling scene. Osborne&#x27;s portrayal was a contrast to the description in Ted Lewis&#x27;s novel &quot;Jack&#x27;s Return Home&quot; of Kinnear as an uncultured, corpulent spiv, giving him an urbane and relaxed demeanour, his delivery being so relaxed and quiet that it was difficult for the sound recordist to pick up, but Hodges liked the &quot;menace in that quietness&quot;.
* Britt Ekland as Anna. Ekland was cast as the leading lady of the film, as she was a prominent sex symbol of the time and would have already been familiar to US audiences through her work in &quot;The Night They Raided Minsky&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Stiletto&quot;. Accordingly, her minor role in the film was overemphasised in the publicity. Ekland was afraid of becoming typecast, having already played two gangster&#x27;s molls before &quot;Carter&quot; in &quot;Stiletto&quot; and &quot;Machine Gun McCain&quot;. She was also reluctant to take the part as she did not want to take her clothes off; however, she had financial problems at the time as a result of bad investment decisions by her accountant. She was later happy that she had been involved with the project.
* Bryan Mosley as Cliff Brumby. MGM executives initially wanted Telly Savalas for the part of the &quot;big man&quot;, but were impressed by &quot;Coronation Street&quot; actor Mosley&#x27;s performance in fight scenes in &quot;Far from The Madding Crowd&quot;. A devout Roman Catholic, Mosley was concerned about taking part in such a violent film with depictions of criminal behaviour, and consulted his priest over the moral implications.
* George Sewell as Con McCarty. Sewell was the man who introduced Barbara Windsor to Charlie Kray. He grew up in working-class Hoxton and had come to acting late when, in 1959, he joined Joan Littlewood&#x27;s Theatre Workshop. A well-known face on British television in the 1960s, his sandblasted features and shifty, haunted looks made him ideal for playing villainous characters or hard-bitten detectives. He seemed ideally cast as a London gangster colleague of Carter&#x27;s. After &quot;Carter&quot;, Sewell became more known for playing policemen rather than villains.
* Tony Beckley as Peter the Dutchman. Lewis depicted Peter as a misogynistic homosexual in his novel; these elements were not emphasised in the film, although the character is flamboyant and camp. Beckley had developed a specialism of playing sadistic criminals, so his part in &quot;Carter&quot; was somewhat similar to his role of &quot;Camp Freddy&quot; alongside Caine in &quot;The Italian Job&quot;.
* Glynn Edwards as Albert Swift. Like Sewell, Edwards was an apprentice of Joan Littlewood&#x27;s Theatre Workshop who had come to acting in his 30s. He had previously appeared alongside Caine in &quot;Zulu&quot; and &quot;The Ipcress File&quot;. After the film Edwards found work as a character actor and appeared regularly in the TV show &quot;Minder&quot;.
* Alun Armstrong as Keith Lacey. This was Armstrong&#x27;s screen debut. The themes of &quot;Get Carter&quot; echo to a certain extent those of Armstrong&#x27;s better-known role 25 years later in BBC drama &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot;. He wrote a letter to MGM when he learned it was making the film in Newcastle, and he was invited to meet director Mike Hodges, who wanted to cast local actors.
* Bernard Hepton as Thorpe. Bradford-born Hepton was cast by Hodges as Kinnear&#x27;s nervous messenger.
* Petra Markham as Doreen Carter. Petra Markham was a 24-year-old experienced theatre actress when she was asked to play the role of Carter&#x27;s 16-year-old niece. Her appearance in only four scenes in the film meant she could balance the film work with appearing at the Royal Court and her role in the television series &quot;Albert and Victoria&quot;. She went on to play the unfortunate Rose Chapman in &quot;EastEnders&quot;.
* Geraldine Moffat as Glenda. Moffatt was an experienced actress who had trained at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. She attracted Hodges&#x27; attention not just for her good looks but for her work on Alun Owen&#x27;s television plays &quot;Stella&quot; and &quot;Doreen&quot;.
* Dorothy White as Margaret. White had a successful career as a television actress and was particularly well known for &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, but the part of Margaret was her first credited cinematic role (the only other being a part in the 1955 film &quot;Touch &amp; Go&quot;). She had previously worked with Mike Hodges on the television play &quot;Suspect&quot;. 
* Rosemarie Dunham as Edna Garfoot, Carter&#x27;s landlady. Although she had appeared in &quot;The Avengers&quot; and &quot;A Family at War&quot; on television, this was Scottish-born Dunham&#x27;s film debut.
* John Bindon as Sid Fletcher. He was the son of a London cab driver who was discovered by Ken Loach in a pub. As a young man Bindon had been in and out of borstal, and spent most of his adult life associating with criminals, so he was ideally suited to play a gangland boss, despite being young, having intimate knowledge of that world. In the late 1970s his career suffered as he became entangled in accusations of protection racketeering in Fulham and was acquitted of murder at the Old Bailey.
* Terence Rigby as Gerald Fletcher, one of the London crime boss brothers. Rigby was another actor Hodges cast from his familiarity in television police drama.

Mike Hodges recruited a band of experienced character actors to play the small supporting roles. Godfrey Quigley was cast as Eddie Appleyard, a colleague of Frank Carter&#x27;s. Kevin Brennan appears as Harry the card-player. Ben Aris, who plays one of the architects, had previously appeared in such films as &quot;if...&quot;, &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

Carl Howard&#x27;s character of the assassin, &quot;J&quot;, is only identified by the initial on his ring, in his only film role, and an appropriate mystery surrounds his real identity. His name does not appear on the credits of some prints. Mike Hodges explained that Howard was an extra in his TV film &quot;Rumour&quot;, and the director gave him a line to say, but another extra was wrongly credited. Hodges promised he would make it up to him and cast him in &quot;Carter&quot;, but his name was missed off some of the original prints. When the film credits were printed in the &quot;Radio Times&quot; and &quot;TV Times&quot;, Howard was also trimmed. Hodges said in 2002 that &quot;Carl and credits don&#x27;t seem destined for each other&quot;.

==Production==

===Development===
In the late 1960s, a relaxation in film censorship produced an increase in dark, uncompromising films, with many directors pushing the boundaries of acceptability. &quot;Get Carter&quot; was a film that explored this freedom. The project went from concept to finished film in just 10 months.

In 1969, producer Michael Klinger devised plans for a gangster film to capitalise on public interest in the British criminal underworld after the Kray Twins&#x27; convictions. Klinger was invited to view a first print of Peter Walker&#x27;s &quot;Man of Violence&quot; (1969) and was unimpressed, telling the director &quot;I&#x27;m going to make a gangster film, but it&#x27;s going to cost a lot more than this and it&#x27;s going to be better&quot;.
After searching many publishers for material to adapt into a film, Klinger purchased the rights to Ted Lewis&#x27; novel &quot;Jack&#x27;s Return Home&quot;. Andrew Spicer has written that &quot;he [Klinger] sensed its potential to imbue the British crime thriller with the realism and violence of its American counterparts&quot;.

Klinger had been approached in 1969 by another producer, Nat Cohen, to make films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). In financial trouble and shutting down its British operations, MGM was in the process of closing its British studios at Borehamwood and was looking to make smaller-budget films to turn a profit. At this time Klinger&#x27;s friend Robert Littman had been appointed head of MGM Europe and so Klinger took his proposal to him.&quot; 

MGM agreed to a reasonable but below-average budget of 750,000 (there is some dispute as to whether this figure refers to dollars or pounds) for the production. Within months of agreeing to the deal MGM had pulled out of the UK. Klinger had seen Mike Hodges&#x27; television film &quot;Suspect&quot; (1969) and immediately decided he was the ideal candidate to direct his new project. Hodges had also previously worked on current affairs programme &quot;World in Action&quot;, the arts programme &quot;Tempo&quot; and a 1968 children&#x27;s television serial, &quot;The Tyrant King&quot;, and all these past experiences informed his approach to his film debut.

Klinger contacted Hodges on 27 January 1970 with a copy of &quot;Jack&#x27;s Return Home&quot; and contracted him to write and direct the film, paying him a flat fee of £7,000 (£135,700 in 2024) for his services. Hodges&#x27; original working title for the film was &quot;Carter&#x27;s The Name&quot;. Steve Chibnall writes: &quot;his treatment retained the essential structure of Lewis&#x27;s novel with its strong narrative drive, but introduced some minor changes to characterisation and more fundamental alterations to narratology&quot;. Given that Ted Lewis had not specified where his novel was set, Hodges felt free to relocate the story to a place he was familiar with, considering Grimsby, Lowestoft, Hull and North Shields before deciding on Newcastle upon Tyne. Hodges said he was influenced in his writing by the works of Raymond Chandler and Hollywood B-movies such as &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot;, because they showed &quot;how to use the crime story as an autopsy on society&#x27;s ills&quot;. He did not, however, employ a traditional noir technique of using a voiceover to expose the character&#x27;s inner feelings. He also dispensed with flashbacks to Carter&#x27;s youth featured in the novel which explored his relationship with his brother Frank, streamlining the plot to a linear narrative spanning a single weekend. As Chibnall writes: 

The significance of the double-barrelled shotgun as Carter&#x27;s choice of weapon (which in the novel symbolises family ties and Carter&#x27;s memories of more innocent times hunting with his brother) was lost in the film adaptation.

Carter&#x27;s killing of Brumby and his own assassination were further alterations from the novel, emphasising the film&#x27;s parallels with revenge tragedy and Carter&#x27;s role as what Geoff Mayer calls &quot;the moral agent [...] a &quot;knight&quot; forced to dispense his own sense of justice in a corrupt world&quot;. However, in his DVD commentary Hodges implies that he did not see Carter as morally any more justified than those he kills, and his death is intended to present his actions to the audience as morally bankrupt and futile: &quot;I wanted him to be dealt with in exactly the same way he dealt with other people. Now that&#x27;s a sort of Christian ethic in a way [...] That was a prerequisite of the film for me, that the hitman should go [click] and that&#x27;s it&quot;. Hodges&#x27; decision to kill off Carter was initially protested by MGM executives, as they wanted the character to survive in the event that the film proved successful enough to warrant a sequel.

=== Casting ===
There was pressure from MGM to have more big-name American stars in the film, which was successfully resisted by Hodges. As well as Telly Savalas, names posited by Klinger and studio executives were Joan Collins, and someone Hodges described as &quot;the Canadian lead actress in TV&#x27;s &quot;Peyton Place&quot;&quot;, which is likely a reference to Barbara Parkins. The production also utilised a large number of extras, most of whom were locals who just happened to be on scene when filming was happening. Others were sourced from local casting company Beverley Artistes, which sent everyone registered with it for auditions, one of these being Denea Wilde, who was cast as the pub singer. Several of the company&#x27;s actors were also in background shots in the film including the casino, streets, bars and the police raid scene.

Locations along the east coast of England had been scouted by Hodges and Klinger in the spring of 1970, to find a landscape that suggested a &quot;hard, deprived background&quot;. Newcastle was selected after Hodges&#x27; first choice of Hull proved to be unsuitable. Hodges thoroughly researched the local Newcastle crime scene, adapting the script to make use of settings and incorporating elements of his research into the story. His background at &quot;World in Action&quot; had made him accustomed to making films based on hard investigation and this informed his approach to &quot;Get Carter&quot;. One of the first locations which attracted Hodges&#x27; attention was the Trinity Square multi-storey car park, which dominated the centre of Gateshead. To Hodges, the car park and the cast iron bridges over the Tyne, &quot;seemed to capture the nature of Jack Carter himself&quot;. The car park embodies one of the film&#x27;s more subtle themes, which is the destruction of an old cityscape and its rebuilding in line with modern Brutalism. Hodges described how wandering alone through the upper structure, he realised how the different levels could be used to reveal the hunter, Carter, and the hunted, Brumby, simultaneously but without either being aware of the other – adding to the suspense. The shopping centre and car park were closed in early 2008 and demolished in late 2010.

The location for Cyril Kinnear&#x27;s house, Dryderdale Hall, near Hamsterley, Bishop Auckland, provided a real-life connection with organised crime. It was the recently vacated country house of North East fruit machine businessman Vince Landa, who had fled the country in 1969 after the murder of his right-hand man Angus Sibbett, the so-called one-armed bandit murder. Many believed the crime was part of a failed attempt by the Kray twins to gain control of the Newcastle underworld. Michael Klinger and the MGM publicity spokesman dismissed the use of the location as mere coincidence; however, Hodges was aware of the significance of the house and chose it deliberately. Steve Chibnall writes &quot;It proved a perfect location, wreaking of authenticity and full of useful details such as the cowboys and Indians wallpaper [...] the African shield and crossed spears on the wall of the crime lord&#x27;s living room&quot;. The Landa case also is referenced at the start of the film with a shot of a newspaper bearing the headline &quot;Gaming Wars&quot;. Other locations in Newcastle and Gateshead, Northumberland and County Durham were also used.

===Filming===
Principal photography took place in the North East between 17 July and 15 September 1970. Hodges favoured the use of long focal length lenses (as he had used previously on &quot;Rumour&quot;) in many scenes to create a naturalistic documentary feel, especially in crowd scenes. The film was shot in Metrocolor, which was MGM&#x27;s trade name for films processed at its Eastmancolor laboratory. This lab processed Kodak&#x27;s Eastman Color Negative, so it is most likely the film was shot on this stock. Asked to comment on what he was aiming for in the look of the film, cinematographer Wolfgang Suschitzky said &quot;The camera work on it [...] it was very influenced by Mike Hodges who has a very good eye for setups and he of course conferred with his operator and myself, but he influenced all of us, and much of the good look is due to him, I confess. My main task was lighting on location, very moderately, and waiting for the right daylight and setting the exposure on the lens&quot;. In the first week of shooting in Newcastle, the ACTT called the crew out on a one-day strike. At the advice of Richard Lester, Hodges and his assistant director stayed at a separate hotel to the rest of the cast and crew, which enabled him to have some respite from the production after the shooting day was done. Klinger was present on set for much of the film shoot. However, Hodges said he encountered very little interference from the producer. At one point Klinger and Caine asked if Hodges might work in a &quot;chase sequence&quot;, but he persuaded them that it would draw too many comparisons with &quot;Bullitt&quot; (a chase sequence between Carter and the London gangsters is mentioned in the shooting script). Hodges tried to rehearse the racecourse scene between Caine and Hendry in their hotel the night before shooting, but &quot;Hendry&#x27;s drunken and resentful state forced Hodges to abandon [the] attempt&quot;. Hodges described Caine as &quot;a complete dream to work with&quot;. Caine only lost his temper once on set, during the very tense and emotional day filming in Glenda&#x27;s flat, when the focus puller ruined his first take. Caine apologised immediately.

The most complicated scene to shoot was Kinnear&#x27;s game of cards. There are four simultaneous conversations, with a lot of plot exposition and the introduction of two important characters, Kinnear and Glenda. The technical complexity was compounded by the variation in light coming through the windows, and Osborne&#x27;s whispered delivery which made microphone placement difficult. Hodges moved the camera and the boom closer to Osborne as the scene progressed. Chibnall says that Hodges regretted not rehearsing the scene more thoroughly.


In shooting the scene in which Carter throws Brumby to his death from the multi-storey car park, Hodges used four shots: one of the pair struggling high up on the stairs; one from the lowest level of the stairwell where Caine actually threw Bryan Mosley over the side onto mattresses; one shot of a dummy falling; and one of the body of Brumby on top of a crushed car.

Carter&#x27;s climactic pursuit of Eric used an amalgamation of two locations spaced apart: Blyth staithes and Blackhall Beach near Blackhall Colliery. The chase scene was shot in reverse, with Hodges filming Eric&#x27;s death scene first because of Hendry&#x27;s poor condition, Hodges being worried that he would be too out of breath to play the death scene after running. Hodges chose the beach for its bleak, dark atmosphere but when he returned to shoot the scene he found it bathed in bright sunshine, unsuitable for the sombre conclusion he was hoping for. He waited hours until the sun began setting to capture the overcast shadowy lighting seen in the film. The film shows the beach black with coal spoilings, dumped there by the mine&#x27;s conveyor system. The conveyor, a common sight on the East Durham coast, was known locally as The Flight. In the early 2000s, £10 million was spent removing these conveyors and the concrete towers, and cleaning tonnes of coal waste from the beaches of East Durham. The cleaning programme was known as Turning the Tide.

===Post-production===
Klinger was a hands-on producer who remained present throughout shooting and in post-production. He suggested Hodges use John Trumper as editor. Hodges said that he and Trumper argued and disagreed constantly, but he still thought he was a &quot;brilliant, brilliant editor&quot; and was &quot;very grateful to him for [...] how much he contributed&quot;. Sound editing and dubbing was done by Jim Atkinson, whom Hodges described as &quot;so obsessive about the job&quot;. He gave Hodges multiple possibilities of how the sound could be dubbed, and explored every angle. Klinger was worried that the debut director might be overwhelmed with too many options, but Hodges said he and Atkinson got on very well.

As Carter drives away from the flats, with Glenda in the boot of the car, the tyres make a screeching sound. This was later sampled by Vangelis, who used it on the 1981 title track of the Jon and Vangelis album&quot;The Friends of Mr Cairo&quot;.

===Music===
The majority of the film&#x27;s music was composed by Roy Budd, a jazz pianist and composer, who had previously worked on soundtracks for &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; and &quot;Flight of the Doves&quot;. Aside from its score, Budd also composed three songs: &quot;Looking For Someone&quot;, &quot;Love Is A Four Letter Word&quot; (with lyrics by Jack Fishman) and &quot;Hallucinations&quot;. The theme (otherwise known as &quot;Carter Takes a Train&quot;), the best-known piece from the film, was played by Budd and the other members of his jazz trio, Jeff Clyne (double bass) and Chris Karan (percussion), and was recorded on a budget of £450 (£8,700 in 2024). The musicians recorded the soundtrack live, direct to picture, playing along with the film. To save time and money Budd did not use overdubs, simultaneously playing a real harpsichord, a Wurlitzer electric piano and a grand piano. Budd described the experience as &quot;uncomfortable, but it sounded pleasant&quot;. The theme tune features the sounds of the character&#x27;s train journey from London to Newcastle.

The theme was released as a 7&quot; vinyl single by Pye Records in 1971, titled simply &quot;Carter&quot; and backed with &quot;Plaything&quot;, another piece composed for the soundtrack. Original copies of the record are much sought after by collectors and sell for around £100. The soundtrack—including pieces not used in the film—was originally only available in its entirety in Japan, where it was released on Odeon Records. It was released in the UK in 1998 by the Cinephile label, a subsidiary of Castle Communications. In 2012, the theme was included on the Soul Jazz Records compilation &quot;British TV, Film and Library Composers&quot;.

The film includes other music which is not included on the soundtrack LP. The music playing in the nightclub scene is an uptempo cover of the 1969 Willie Mitchell tune &quot;30-60-90&quot; performed live by the Jack Hawkins Showband, which was the resident band at the Oxford Galleries night club. The pub singer, played by Denea Wilde, performs a cover of &quot;How About You?&quot; by Burton Lane and Ralph Freed, a song more associated with glamorous Hollywood films than the backrooms of Newcastle pubs. The Pelaw Hussars, a local juvenile jazz band and majorette troupe, also appear and perform two numbers, &quot;When The Saints Go Marching In&quot; and &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;.

==Release==
===Theatrical===

The world premiere for &quot;Get Carter&quot; was held in Los Angeles on 3 February 1971. The film finally opened for general release across the UK on 10 March 1971 and in the US on 18 March, where it was rated &#x27;X&#x27; for violence and female nudity, meaning it was for adults only. It was later reclassified as &#x27;R&#x27;, meaning children under the age of 17 had to be accompanied by an adult. A censored version was released in West Germany on 6 August 1971, with a running time nine minutes shorter than the original. Michael Klinger was involved in promotion of the film in the UK, using the experience from his background as a distributor to conduct a strong advertising campaign. Teaser posters for the film appeared on the front of buses across London, featuring the tagline &quot;Caine is Carter&quot;.

The original British quad poster with artwork by Arnaldo Putzu, in common with many film posters, has aspects or images that differ from the finished screen version. Carter is depicted wearing a gaudy floral jacket, as opposed to the dark raincoat and mohair suit he wears in the film. Asked in 2006, Putzu could not remember his artistic rationale for painting the floral jacket, but said he was painting a lot of flowers in designs at that time. Chibnall describes the flower power imagery as &quot;what seems like a desperate and misguided attempt to suggest the hipness of a genre which had largely fallen out of favour&quot;. However, movie poster expert Sim Branaghan liked its eccentricity, calling it was &quot;that kind of quirkiness you wouldn&#x27;t get these days&quot;. Jonny Trunk of Trunk Records—a long-time aficionado of the film and its history—has observed that the floral pattern of Carter&#x27;s jacket is taken from the distinctive pillow and matching sheet design from the bed in the scene where Britt Ekland writhes naked whilst on the phone to Jack. The poster also places Carter&#x27;s shotgun in Eric&#x27;s hands, and features a grappling man and woman who seem to belong to a different film. Promotional shots and poster artwork exist from the film showing Carter holding a pump-action shotgun; in the finished film, the only shotgun used by Carter is a double-barrelled shotgun, which Carter finds on top of his brother Frank&#x27;s wardrobe.

MGM sold distribution rights to the film in the U.S. to its future subsidiary United Artists, which promoted it poorly, amidst worries the cockney dialogue in the opening scene would be unintelligible to U.S. audiences. The film&#x27;s release was delayed while parts of the film were redubbed, with no great improvement. In the process of redubbing the opening, the version of the film with the original dialogue was lost. For years the version shown on British television was the redubbed American cut. UA placed the film on the declining drive-in movie circuit, where it played at the bottom of a double bill with &quot;Dirty Dingus Magee&quot;, a vehicle for Frank Sinatra. Michael Klinger complained in 1974 to president of UA Eric Pleskow about the lacklustre promotion of &quot;Carter&quot;, and tried to get him to relinquish the U.S. rights to the film so that Klinger could find a better distributor.

The film did not encounter many censorship problems, although the scene where Carter knifes Albert Swift caused concern for the censor John Trevelyan. In South Africa the censor cut out Britt Ekland&#x27;s phone sex scene, shortening her already brief role; her name was still left on the poster, leaving filmgoers to wonder why she was advertised as appearing.

A resurgence of critical and public interest in the film in the 1990s led to the British Film Institute (BFI) releasing a new print of the film in 1999. It worked with Hodges to restore the film, with Hodges sourcing another set of negatives of the original opening, which were found in the archives of the BBC. The team then spliced the beginning segment onto a high-quality print of the film. The reissue premiered at the National Film Theatre and went on general release on 11 June 1999, showing at the Tyneside Cinema in Newcastle.

On 16 March 2022, the BFI announced that they would be partnering with Warner Bros. and Warner Bros. Home Entertainment for a re-release of the film at the BFI Southbank as part of their retrospective program &quot;Return of the Outsider: The Films of Mike Hodges&quot;, which ran from May 1 to May 31 and included various in-person events such as &quot;Mike Hodges in Conversation&quot; on May 3; this was followed by a wide release in British and Irish cinemas on 27 May. This release utilised a new 4K restoration of the film&#x27;s original camera negative, which was approved by Hodges.

===Home media===
Chibnall has established that the film was shown on LWT in 1976 and 1980 &quot;in a bowdlerised version&quot; (which edited out Britt Ekland&#x27;s phone sex scene) and once on Westward Television and on Granada in August 1981, but it was not shown nationally and in its entirety until a post-watershed BBC broadcast in 1986. It was finally released on home media in 1993 by MGM/UA as part of its &quot;Elite Collection&quot;. Chibnall says &quot;There was no advertising to suggest a significant event had occurred. It was simply a part of the long process of exploiting MGM&#x27;s back catalogue in the run-up to Christmas&quot;. Despite this, the release was given a five-star review in &quot;Empire&quot;, where it was described as &quot;one of the best British films of the 70s&quot;. Chibnall notes &quot;it did not, however, find a place in &quot;Empire&quot;″s top fifty videos of the year&quot;.

Warner Bros. reissued the film in a special edition on DVD in October 2000 in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Extras included three trailers; the international trailer, an introduction by Michael Caine to the people of Newcastle, and a third featuring Roy Budd playing the opening theme. This format was also used in a 2001 VHS set released by Warner, which included &quot;Bullitt&quot; and &quot;Shaft&quot;. Also included on the DVD was commentary from Caine, Hodges and Suschitzky, constructed from separate interviews with the three. The soundtrack was presented in 1.0 mono Dolby Digital.

The film was bundled in the 2008 &quot;Movies That Matter – 70&#x27;s Classics&quot; DVD set with &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;. It is available from the Warner Archive Collection as a Made on Demand (MOD) DVD-R or a download, with the same extras as the 2000 release, although with only two trailers and this time in 16:9 ratio.

&quot;Get Carter&quot; was released on Blu-ray Disc by Warner on April 22, 2014; this release features the same extras as the special edition DVD, but due to a manufacturing error, American pressings of the disc utilize the dubbed American version of the opening sequence instead of the original audio. This change was carried over to the initial British pressings of the disc, but was later reversed following public backlash; later British pressings sold by outlets such as Amazon UK feature the original audio track.

BFI Video released its 4K restoration of &quot;Get Carter&quot; on August 1, 2022 on standard and Ultra HD Blu-ray; the two-disc sets include the special features of earlier home media releases of the film, as well as a new audio commentary with critics Kim Newman and Barry Forshaw, an isolated music track, interviews with Hodges, Trunk Records founder Jonny Trunk, actress Petra Markham and Michael Klinger&#x27;s son Tony, Philip Trevelyan&#x27;s 1966 documentary film &quot;The Ship Hotel, Tyne Main&quot;, a booklet containing various essays on the film and other paraphernalia, postcards and a double-sided poster for both the restoration and a replication of the original UK poster art.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 87% based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 7.50/10; the site&#x27;s critical consensus reads &quot;Darkly entertaining and tightly wound, &quot;Get Carter&quot; is a gritty revenge story done right&quot;. In 2003, Steve Chibnall observed a large gender imbalance in voting on the film up to April 2002, with less than 6% of votes cast (where the voters gave their gender) by women (53 out of 947). He also noticed a substantial increase in women voting on the film in the eight months leading up to April 2002.

Describing the initial critical response to the film, Steve Chibnall wrote &quot;Initial critical vilification or indifference establishes the conditions in which a cult can flourish. &quot;Get Carter&quot; had to make do with ambivalence&quot;. He thought the general stance of British critics &quot;was to admire the film&#x27;s power and professionalism while condemning its amorality and excessive violence&quot;. Geoff Mayer observed that &quot;Mainstream critics at the time were dismayed by the film&#x27;s complex plotting and Carter&#x27;s lack of remorse&quot;. In &quot;Sight and Sound&quot;, Tom Milne said the film was well-constructed and had good characterisation, but lacked the mystery and charisma of the earlier American crime films it attempted to emulate. He found Carter&#x27;s motivations were inconsistent, either being an avenging angel or an &quot;authentic post-permissive anti-hero, revelling in the casual sadism&quot;.

In contrast, Nigel Andrews found the characters to be clichéd archetypes of the criminal underworld, such as the &quot;homosexual chauffeur, bloated tycoon, glamorous mistress&quot;, describing the film as &quot;perfunctory&quot;.
Richard Weaver in &quot;Films and Filming&quot; praised the realism of the film, describing it as &quot;crime at its most blatant&quot;, while George Melly writing in &quot;The Observer&quot; confessed to vicarious enjoyment of it, but admitted it was &quot;like a bottle of neat gin swallowed before breakfast. It&#x27;s intoxicating all right, but it&#x27;ll do you no good&quot;.

Steve Chibnall writes that &quot;America was rather more used to hard-boiled storytelling&quot; and that reviewers there were &quot;more prepared than British criticism to treat &quot;Get Carter&quot; as a serious work&quot;, Pauline Kael admiring its &quot;calculated soullessness&quot; and wondering if it signalled a &quot;new genre of virtuoso viciousness&quot;. US publication &quot;Box Office&quot; gave a cautiously approving review, describing the film as &quot;nasty, violent and sexy all at once&quot;. It predicted that &quot;It should please in the action market, but won&#x27;t win any laurels for Caine although his portrayal of the vicious anti-hero impresses&quot;. The reviewer also opined that &quot;Tighter editing would help considerably&quot;. Roger Ebert was less reserved in his praise, writing that &quot;the movie has a sure touch&quot;. He noted the &quot;proletarian detail&quot; of the film which is &quot;unusual in a British detective movie. Usually we get all flash and no humanity, lots of fancy camera tricks but no feel for the criminal strata of society&quot;. Of Caine&#x27;s performance he wrote, &quot;The character created by Caine is particularly interesting. He&#x27;s tough and ruthless, but very quiet and charged with a terrible irony&quot;. Judith Crist in &quot;New York&quot; magazine gave a glowing review, saying &quot;Michael Caine is superb, suave and sexy&quot; and describing the film as &quot;a hard, mean and satisfying zinger of the old tough-tec school done in frank contemporary terms&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; also praised the film, saying it &quot;not only maintains interest but conveys with rare artistry, restraint and clarity the many brutal, sordid and gamy plot turns&quot;. However, Jay Cocks writing in &quot;Time&quot; was disparaging, calling the film &quot;a doggedly nasty piece of business&quot; and comparing it unfavourably to &quot;Point Blank&quot;. The film appeared on several US critics&#x27; lists of best films of the year.

In Michael Klinger&#x27;s &quot;The Guardian&quot; obituary in 1989, Derek Malcolm remembered the film as &quot;one of the most formidable British thrillers of its time&quot;.

===Box office===
&quot;Get Carter&quot; was a financial success, and according to Steve Chibnall its box office takings were &quot;very respectable&quot;. On its opening week at ABC2 cinema at Shaftesbury Avenue, London, it broke the house record, taking £8,188. It out-performed &quot;Up Pompeii&quot;, which was showing in the larger ABC1. It also performed strongly when moved to the ABCs in Edgware and Fulham Road. On its general release in the North of England, Chibnall notes it had a &quot;very strong first week&quot;, before an unseasonal heatwave damaged cinema attendance. Chibnall writes that &quot;Interestingly, although [the film&#x27;s] downbeat and unsentimental tone is now thought to express the mood of its times, the mass cinema audience preferred &quot;Love Story&quot; (Arthur Hiller 1970), which remained the most popular film in Britain throughout &quot;Get Carter&quot;&#x27;s run&quot;. It was the sixth-most popular &quot;general release&quot; movie at the British box office in 1971.

===Accolades===
At the time of its release, the only recognition the film received was a 1972 BAFTA Awards nomination for Ian Hendry as Best Supporting Actor. In 1999, &quot;Get Carter&quot; was ranked 16th on the BFI Top 100 British films of the 20th century; five years later, a survey of British film critics in &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine chose it as the greatest British film of all time. In 2008 the film was placed at 225 on &quot;Empire&quot;″s 500 Best Movies of All Time list, which was selected by over 10,000 &quot;Empire&quot; readers, 150 filmmakers and 50 film critics. In October 2010 the critics from &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper placed the film on their list of &quot;Greatest Films of All Time&quot;, placing it at number 7 in the 25 greatest crime films. In the accompanying poll conducted amongst &quot;Guardian&quot; readers, it was voted fifth. In 2011 &quot;Time Out London&quot; placed the film at 32 in its 100 Best British Films list, which was selected by a panel of 150 film industry experts.

==Remakes==
In 1972, MGM released the blaxploitation film &quot;Hit Man&quot;, written and directed by George Armitage and produced by Gene Corman; the film&#x27;s credits identify Lewis&#x27; &quot;Jack&#x27;s Return Home&quot; as its basis. This was the second time that Corman had produced a blaxploitation film based on a novel that had previously been adapted for film, following &quot;Cool Breeze&quot; (1972), the fourth adaptation of W. R. Burnett&#x27;s &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot;. However, Hodges and critics have identified &quot;Hit Man&quot; as a remake of &quot;Get Carter&quot;, transposing the action from Newcastle to Los Angeles. The film stars Bernie Casey as Tyrone Tackett, the story&#x27;s counterpart to Jack Carter, while Glenda is reimagined as Gozelda, a &quot;sultry skin flick star&quot; portrayed by Pam Grier. Armitage revealed that he had not seen &quot;Get Carter&quot; at the time he worked on the film, and that Corman had given him an untitled copy of Hodges&#x27; script, asking him to rewrite it in an African-American context; he did not learn that the film was based on &quot;Get Carter&quot; until he was informed by his agent. While the films share several plot details and treatments, such as a sniper aiming at Carter/Tackett on a rocky beach, &quot;Hit Man&quot; includes several divergences from &quot;Get Carter&quot;, including a scene in which Gozelda is mauled to death by tigers, and does not end with the main character&#x27;s death. Hodges and Klinger were incensed by MGM&#x27;s decision to remake the film, as they considered &quot;Hit Man&quot; inferior to &quot;Get Carter&quot;; Lewis later claimed that he never received any royalties from &quot;Hit Man&quot;. The film was released by Warner Archive Collection as a MOD DVD-R on May 4, 2010.

Warner Bros., which holds the rights to the pre-1986 MGM library, produced another remake of &quot;Get Carter&quot; in 2000 under the same title, starring Sylvester Stallone as Jack Carter. Originally announced in 1997, Tarsem Singh and Samuel Bayer were considered to direct the film before Stephen Kay signed on, with David McKenna writing the script. As with &quot;Hit Man&quot;, the film credited Ted Lewis&#x27; &quot;Jack&#x27;s Return Home&quot; as its source, not Hodges&#x27; film, and again it contains scenes that are directly borrowed from the original, such as the opening train ride. Michael Caine appears as Cliff Brumby, in what Elvis Mitchell described as &quot;a role that will increase regard for the original&quot;, speculating that &quot;maybe that was his intention&quot;. Mickey Rourke plays the villain Cyrus Paice. The remake was compared unfavourably to the original by the majority of reviewers. The consensus opinion of critics on Rotten Tomatoes was that it was &quot;a remake that doesn&#x27;t approach the standard of the original, &quot;Get Carter&quot; will likely leave viewers confused and unsatisfied. Also, reviews are mixed concerning Stallone&#x27;s acting&quot;. It was so badly received on its US release that Warner Bros. decided not to give it a UK theatrical release, anticipating the film would be savaged by British critics and fans. Elvis Mitchell in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;it&#x27;s so minimally plotted that not only does it lack subtext or context, but it also may be the world&#x27;s first movie without even a text&quot;. Mike Hodges said in 2003 he had still not seen the remake, but was informed by a friend that it was &quot;unspeakable&quot;. His son brought him a DVD of the film back from Hong Kong and he tried to watch it, but the region format was incompatible &quot;so we put it in the dustbin&quot;. The film was voted the worst remake of all time in 2004 by users of British DVD rental website ScreenSelect (precursor of Lovefilm). On 13 February 2001, the remake was released on Region 1 DVD by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment.

==Legacy==
Tom Cox writes that many British filmmakers &quot;have stolen from Hodges without matching the cold, realistic kick&quot; of &quot;Get Carter&quot;. Films such as &quot;The Long Good Friday&quot;, &quot;Face&quot; and &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; borrow from the film&#x27;s blueprint. Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s 1999 film &quot;The Limey&quot; is a homage to &quot;Get Carter&quot; and other British gangster films, and contains similar plot elements and themes of revenge, family and corruption. Soderbergh said he envisioned &quot;The Limey&quot; as &quot;&quot;Get Carter&quot; made by Alain Resnais&quot;. Shane Meadows&#x27; film &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Shoes&quot; has also drawn comparisons to &quot;Get Carter&quot;, being similarly a revenge gangster story set around a provincial English town. The production team of the television series &quot;Life on Mars&quot; also cited &quot;Get Carter&quot; as one of their influences for the programme.

The film&#x27;s music also enjoyed its own resurgence in popularity, for it tapped into a 1990s interest in vintage film soundtracks. Portishead&#x27;s Adrian Utley explained that they found the music to &quot;Get Carter&quot; inspiring because &quot;it was done quickly and cheaply with only a few instruments, and it had to be intensely creative to disguise its limitations&quot;. The Human League 1981 album &quot;Dare&quot; contains a track covering the &quot;Get Carter&quot; theme, although it was only a version of the sparse leitmotif that opens and closes the film as opposed to the full-blooded jazz piece that accompanies the train journey. Stereolab also covers Roy Budd&#x27;s theme on their 1998 compilation album &quot;Aluminum Tunes&quot;, although they call their version &quot;Get Carter&quot;, as opposed to its proper title, &quot;Main Theme (Carter Takes A Train)&quot;. This Stereolab version was subsequently used as a sample in the song &quot;Got Carter&quot; by 76. The Finnish rock band Laika &amp; the Cosmonauts cover the film&#x27;s theme on their 1995 album &quot;The Amazing Colossal Band&quot;. BB Davis &amp; the Red Orchidstra released a version of the film&#x27;s title theme in 1999. Jah Wobble produced a dub cover version of the theme tune in 2009. Wobble had long been a fan of the bassline of the track, saying in a 2004 interview with &quot;The Independent&quot; that &quot;There are some bass lines that contain the whole mystery of creation within them&quot;.

<text>Rochefort (; ) is a city and municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Namur, Belgium, close to the Ardennes. On 1 January 2006, Rochefort had a total population of 12,038. The total area is 165.27 km² which gives a population density of 73 inhabitants per km². It was a resort in the 19th century.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Ave-et-Auffe, Buissonville, Éprave, Han-sur-Lesse, Jemelle, Lavaux-Sainte-Anne, Lessive, Mont-Gauthier, Rochefort, Villers-sur-Lesse, and Wavreille.

Its ancient position at the crossroads where the route to Saint-Hubert crossed that from Liège to Bouillon required fortifying: the ruins of the old castle, which gave the place its name and a title to a long line of counts who had the right of coining their own money, still exist. This castle underwent many sieges and suffered at the hands of Marshal de Châtillon (1636).

Near Rochefort are the red marble quarries of St. Remy, and Rochefort Abbey, a Trappist monastery, which operates the Rochefort Brewery, known for brewing dark and sweet beers, especially the Rochefort 10, a deep dark-brown rich and fruity beer.

The town was the site of the Battle of Bure during the Second World War.

==Caves==

Rochefort is well known for its caves. The Grotto of Rochefort, within the town, contains six chambers, the largest and highest of which was called the Sabbat (&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; 1911). It was swept clear of its prehistoric remains before electric lighting was installed. The cave has recently been given the Christian name of &quot;Lorette&quot; after a nearby chapel of Our Lady of Loreto. 

The more famous local caves within the municipality are at Han-sur-Lesse, one of Rochefort&#x27;s constituent towns, where the Lesse River disappears at what is called the gap or hole of Belvaux and passes by subterranean passages under the hill called Boeme or Boine. The endeavour to trace the course of the river led to the discovery of the grottoes, which consist of fifteen separate connected &quot;halls&quot; that emerge in a bay of the river from a dark and extensive cavern forming a sort of side creek or bay. Except in flood-time, when the exit has to be used, the entrance is near the point where the river disappears at what is called the gap or hole of Belvaux, and the exit is made by boat from the cavern last described, which leads out to the open river. A beautiful effect for tourists in boats is afforded by emerging from the complete darkness of this cavern into the light. The finest stalactites are in the three halls called the &quot;Mysterieuses&quot;, the &quot;Vigneron&quot; and the &quot;Draperies&quot; where is &quot; the tomb&quot;, which looks as if chiseled out of white marble. The central hall called the Salle d&#x27;Armes (&quot;the Armory&quot;) is immense, and one of the river channels flows through it.

==Twin City==
Rochefort is twinned with the city of Broussard, Louisiana.
