<text>The year 1903 in film involved many significant events in cinema.

==Events==
* Thomas Edison demolishes &quot;America&#x27;s First Movie Studio&quot;, the Black Maria.
* The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit decides that federal copyright protection for &quot;photographs&quot; extends to motion pictures, and that filmmakers could copyright films as a whole rather than having to separately register each frame.
* The three elder Warner Bros. begin in the exhibition business and open their first theater, the Cascade.
* Gaston Méliès, Georges&#x27; brother, opens a branch of Star Film in New York to defend its production&#x27;s copyrights.
* Adolph Zukor and Marcus Loew partner with Mitchell Mark to expand his chain of movie theaters.
* William N. Selig&#x27;s war film &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Dream&quot; is released. The film shows soldiers playing cards and music around a campfire. Scholars have speculated that the double-exposed image used to create one soldier&#x27;s dream sequence may have been inspired by Méliès.

<text>The year 1900 in film involved some significant events.
==Events==
* Reulos, Goudeau &amp; Co. invent Mirographe, a 21 mm amateur format.
* The Lumière Brothers premiere their new Lumiere Wide format for the 1900 World Fair. At 75 mm wide, it has held the record for over 100 years as the widest format yet developed.
* Raoul Grimoin-Sanson also creates a sensation at the 1900 World Fair with his multi-projector Cinéorama spectacle, which uses ten 70 mm projectors to create a simulated 360-degree balloon ride over Paris. The exhibit is closed before it formally opens, however, due to legitimate health and safety concerns regarding the heat of the combined projectors, and releases the format as La Petite.
* Gaumont-Demeny release their own 15 mm amateur format, Pocket Chrono.
* Release of the first film version of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, an adaptation of the duel scene, with French actress Sarah Bernhardt playing the title role and accompanying recorded sound.
* Making of the first film to feature the detective character Sherlock Holmes, &quot;Sherlock Holmes Baffled&quot;, by the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company.
*&quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; becomes the first film of considerable length (10 minutes) to be shown entirely in colour.
* William N. Selig makes &quot;The Chicago Stockyards—From Hoof to Market&quot; for Chicago-based Philip Danforth Armour, a prominent businessman in the meatpacking industry, showing the full meatpacking process from cattle being unloaded at the stockyards to canning. Studio lights do not exist, so stage spotlights are borrowed from the Richard Mansfield Theatrical Company to film inside the slaughterhouse.

<text>&quot;Ornament and Crime&quot; is an essay and lecture by modernist architect Adolf Loos that criticizes ornament in useful objects.

==History==
Contrary to popular belief that it was composed in 1908, Adolf Loos first gave the lecture in 1910 at the Akademischer Verband für Literatur und Musik in Vienna. The essay was then published in 1913 in in French as . Only in 1929 was the essay published in German in the , as . It was the architect Henry Kulka, who assisted Loos during a reprint of the essay in 1931 in , that altered the original year to 1908 after he consulted Loos, who either didn&#x27;t remember well or wanted to assume primacy in the confrontation against the Secessionists.

==Content==
The essay was written when Art Nouveau—known as Secession in Austria and which Loos had excoriated even at its height in 1900—was showing a new way forward for modern art. The essay was important in articulating some moralizing views, inherited from the Arts and Crafts movement, which would be fundamental to the Bauhaus design studio, and would help define the ideology of modernism in architecture.

&quot;The evolution of culture marches with the elimination of ornament from useful objects&quot;, Loos proclaimed, thus linking the optimistic sense of the linear and upward progress of cultures with the contemporary vogue for applying evolution to cultural contexts. Loos&#x27;s work was prompted by regulations he encountered when he designed a building without ornamentation opposite a palace. He eventually conceded to requirements by adding window flower boxes.

In the essay, Loos explains his philosophy, describing how ornamentation can have the effect of causing objects to go out of style and thus become obsolete. It struck him that it was a crime to waste the effort needed to add ornamentation, when the ornamentation would cause the object to soon go out of style. Loos introduced a sense of the &quot;immorality&quot; of ornament, describing it as &quot;degenerate&quot;, its suppression as necessary for regulating modern society. He took as one of his examples the tattooing of the &quot;Papuan&quot; and the intense surface decorations of the objects about him—Loos says that, in the eyes of western culture, the Papuan has not evolved to the moral and civilized circumstances of modern man, who, should he tattoo himself, would either be considered a criminal or a degenerate.

Loos never argued for the complete absence of ornamentation, but believed that it had to be appropriate to the type of material.

Loos concluded that &quot;No ornament can any longer be made today by anyone who lives on our cultural level ... Freedom from ornament is a sign of spiritual strength&quot;.

<text>Jack Joseph Valenti (September 5, 1921 – April 26, 2007) was an American political advisor and lobbyist who served as a Special Assistant to U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson. He was also the longtime president of the Motion Picture Association of America. During his 38-year tenure in the MPAA, he created the MPAA film rating system, and was generally regarded as one of the most influential pro-copyright lobbyists in the world. 

==Early life and education==
Valenti was born on September 5, 1921, in Houston, the son of Italian immigrants. He attended Sam Houston High School. During World War II, he was a first lieutenant in the United States Army Air Force. Valenti flew 51 combat missions as the pilot-commander of a B-25 medium bomber and received four decorations, including the Distinguished Flying Cross and Air Medal.

Valenti graduated from the University of Houston in 1946 with a BA. During his time there, he worked on the staff of the university newspaper, &quot;The Daily Cougar&quot;, and was president of the university&#x27;s student government. Valenti would later serve on the university&#x27;s board of regents.

== Career ==
After earning an M.B.A. from Harvard University in 1948, Valenti worked for Humble Oil in its advertising department, where he helped the company&#x27;s Texas gas stations jump from fifth to first in sales through a &quot;cleanest restrooms&quot; campaign.

In 1952, he and a partner named Weldon Weekley founded Weekley &amp; Valenti, an advertising agency, with oil company Conoco as its first client. In 1956, Valenti met then Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson. Weekley &amp; Valenti branched out into political consulting and added Representative Albert Thomas, a Johnson ally, as a client. In 1960, Valenti&#x27;s firm assisted in the Kennedy-Johnson presidential campaign.

===Politics===
Valenti served as liaison with the news media during President John F. Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s November 22, 1963, visit to Dallas, Texas, and Valenti was in the presidential motorcade. Following the assassination of President Kennedy, Valenti was present at Johnson&#x27;s swearing-in aboard Air Force One, and flew with him to Washington. He then became the first &quot;special assistant&quot; to Johnson&#x27;s White House and lived there for the first two months of Johnson&#x27;s presidency. In 1964, Johnson gave Valenti the responsibility to handle relations with the Republican Congressional leadership, particularly Gerald Ford and Charles Halleck from the House of Representatives, and the Senate&#x27;s Everett Dirksen.

Valenti later called Johnson &quot;the most single dominating human being that I&#x27;ve ever been in contact with&quot; and &quot;the single most intelligent man I&#x27;ve ever known&quot;. In a speech before the American Advertising Federation in 1965, Valenti said: &quot;I sleep each night a little better, a little more confidently, because Lyndon Johnson is my president.&quot;

Valenti later criticized film director Oliver Stone for the 1991 movie &quot;JFK&quot;. He called the movie a &quot;monstrous charade&quot; and said, &quot;I owe where I am today to Lyndon Johnson. I could not live with myself if I stood by mutely and let some filmmaker soil his memory.&quot;

===MPAA===
In 1966, Valenti, at the insistence of Universal Studios chief Lew Wasserman and with Johnson&#x27;s consent, resigned his White House commission and became president of the Motion Picture Association of America. With Valenti&#x27;s arrival in Hollywood, the pair were lifelong allies, and together orchestrated and controlled how Hollywood would conduct business for the next several decades.

William F. Patry, a copyright attorney for the Bill Clinton administration, who observed Valenti firsthand says:

His personal passion and extreme comfort around politicians gave him credibility that others ... would lack. Mr Valenti was a consummate salesman, who like all great salesmen ... worked himself up into believing the truth of his clients&#x27; message. Those privileged to see Mr Valenti offstage – talking openly with his clients about what could or could not be achieved, and what artifice would or would not work – are aware that Mr Valenti&#x27;s clients frequently disagreed with his advice and directed him to deliver a different message through a different artifice. [He] was a great actor working on the stage of Washington DC (and sometimes globally) on behalf of an industry that appreciated his craft, but that never let him forget that the message was theirs and not his.

====Movie rating system====
In 1968, Valenti developed the MPAA film rating system, which initially comprised four distinct ratings: G, M, R and X. The M rating was soon replaced by GP, and changed to PG in 1972. The X rating immediately proved troublesome, since it was not trademarked and therefore used freely by the pornographic film industry, with which it became most associated. Mainstream films such as &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; and &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; were assumed by the public to be pornographic because they carried the X rating. In 1990, the trademarked &quot;adults only&quot; NC-17 rating was introduced as a replacement for the non-trademarked X-rating. The PG-13 rating had been added in 1984 to provide a greater range of distinction for audiences and was first proposed by Steven Spielberg.

====Valenti on new technologies====
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Valenti became notorious for his flamboyant attacks on the Sony Betamax Video Cassette Recorder (VCR), which the MPAA feared would devastate the movie industry. He famously told a congressional panel in 1982, &quot;I say to you that the VCR is to the American film producer and the American public as the Boston strangler is to the woman home alone.&quot; Despite Valenti&#x27;s prediction, the home video market ultimately came to be the mainstay of movie studio revenues throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

====Digital Millennium Copyright Act====

In 1998, Valenti lobbied for the controversial Digital Millennium Copyright Act, arguing that copyright infringement via the Internet would severely damage the record and movie industries.

====2003 screener ban injunction====
In 2003, Valenti found himself at the center of the so-called screener debate, as the MPAA barred studios and many independent producers from sending screener copies of their films to critics and voters in various awards shows. Under mounting industry pressure and a court injunction &quot;Antidote Int&#x27;l Films Inc. et al. v MPAA&quot; (November 2003), Valenti backed down in 2004, narrowly avoiding a massive and embarrassing antitrust lawsuit against the MPAA.

The Coalition of Independent Filmmakers&#x27; Jeff Levy-Hinte, IFP/Los Angeles executive director Dawn Hudson and IFP/New York executive director Michelle Byrd said in a joint statement, &quot;By obtaining a court order to force the MPAA to lift the screener ban last December, the Coalition enabled individual distributors to determine when and in what manner to distribute promotional screeners.&quot; It was viewed as Valenti&#x27;s greatest professional loss.

=== Honors ===
Valenti received the Distinguished Flying Cross and Air Medal for his service with the Army Air Force during the Second World War.
In 1969, Jack Valenti received the Bronze Medallion, New York City&#x27;s highest civilian honor.
In 1985, Jack Valenti received the French Légion d&#x27;Honneur.

In 2002, the University of Houston bestowed Valenti an honorary doctorate.

In December 2003, Valenti received the &quot;Legend in Leadership Award&quot; from the Chief Executive Leadership Institute of the Yale School of Management.

In June 2005, the Washington DC headquarters of the Motion Picture Association of America, was renamed the Jack Valenti Building. It is located at 888 16th St. NW, Washington DC, very close to the White House. Jack Valenti maintained an office on the 8th floor, outside the MPAA&#x27;s space, until his death.

In April 2008, the University of Houston renamed its School of Communication to the Jack J. Valenti School of Communication in his honor. Valenti was one of the school&#x27;s notable alumni.

==Retirement==

Valenti&#x27;s salary in 2004 was reported to be $1.35 million, which made him the seventh-highest paid Washington trade group chief, according to the National Journal.

Valenti was nominated for President of the United States by the Alfalfa Club in 2004.

In August 2004, Valenti, then 82, retired and was replaced by former U.S. Congressman and Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman. The previous head of the ratings system, Joan Graves, was appointed by Valenti.

After retirement from the MPAA, he became involved in technology-related venture capital activities, such as joining the Advisory Board of Legend Ventures where he advised on media investment opportunities. He also remained a supporter of causes linked to his Italian American heritage and was a member of the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF) for more than 20 years.

After retiring from the MPAA in 2004, Valenti became the first President of Friends of the Global Fight Against AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, an organization founded by philanthropists Edward W. Scott and Adam Waldman. The founders wanted to support the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in its work to prevent millions of people from dying of preventable and treatable diseases each year. Under Valenti&#x27;s leadership, Friends of the Global Fight oversaw a steady increase in U.S. funding for the Global Fund, resulting in a large-scale, positive impact in the fight against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Valenti remained President of Friends of the Global Fight until his death in 2007.

==Personal life==
In 1962, at age 41, Valenti married Mary Margaret Wiley who served on the staff of President Lyndon B. Johnson. They had three children: John, Alexandra, and Courtenay Valenti, who became a Warner Bros. studio executive. He died just before their forty-fifth wedding anniversary.

Nancy Clark Reynolds had been a love interest of Valenti.

In 1964, the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted an investigation concerning whether Valenti had a sexual relationship with a male photographer, at a time when homosexual acts were still illegal in many parts of the United States. The investigation concluded that there was no evidence of Valenti being homosexual.

In 1995, Valenti voiced himself in the two-part &quot;Freakazoid!&quot; episode &quot;The Chip&quot;, where he helped recount the origin of the titular hero; he also lectured about movie ratings using stickers of a family, and made frequent references to his cheeks.

In the 2016 film &quot;Jackie&quot;, about the life of First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis after Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, Valenti is portrayed by Max Casella.

=== Death ===
Valenti died from complications of a stroke at his home in Washington on April 26, 2007, at the age of 85. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery under a veteran&#x27;s gravestone, which lists both his war decorations and his years as president of the MPAA. His memoirs &quot;This Time, This Place: My life in war, the White House and Hollywood&quot; were published on May 15, 2007, a few weeks after his death.

Following his death, the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF) launched the NIAF Jack Valenti Institute, which provides support to Italian-American film students, in his memory. Director Martin Scorsese launched the institute at the Foundation&#x27;s 32nd Anniversary Gala, after receiving an award from Mary Margaret Valenti.

<text>An aperture grille is one of two major technologies used to manufacture color cathode-ray tube (CRT) televisions and computer displays; the other is the shadow mask. The first patented aperture grille televisions were manufactured under the Trinitron brand name.

Fine vertical wires behind the front glass of the display screen separate the different colors of phosphors into strips. These wires are positioned such that an electron beam from one of three guns at the rear of the tube is only able to strike phosphors of the appropriate color. That is, the blue electron gun will strike blue phosphors, but will find a wire blocks the path to red and green phosphors.

The fine wires allow for a finer dot pitch as they can be spaced much closer together than the perforations of a shadow mask, and there need be no gap between adjacent horizontal pixels.

During the display of bright images, a shadow mask warms, and expands outward in all directions (sometimes called blooming). Aperture grilles do not exhibit this behavior; when the wires heat up, they expand vertically. Because there are no defined holes, this expansion does not affect the image, and the wires do not move horizontally.

The vertical wires of the aperture grille have a resonant frequency and will vibrate in sympathetic resonance with loud sounds near the display, resulting in fluttering and shimmering of colors on the display. To reduce these resonant effects, one or two horizontal stabilizing wires, called &quot;damping wires&quot;, are welded across the grille wires, and may be visible as fine dark lines across the face of the screen. These stabilizing wires provide the easiest way to distinguish aperture grille and shadow mask displays at a glance. The stabilized grille can still vibrate but the sounds need to be loud and be emitted close to the display.

Additionally, aperture grille displays tend to be vertically flat and are often horizontally flat as well, while shadow mask displays usually have a spherical curvature.

The first patented aperture grille televisions were manufactured by Sony in the late 1960s under the Trinitron brand name, which the company carried over to its line of CRT computer monitors. Subsequent designs, whether licensed from Sony or manufactured after the patent&#x27;s expiration, tend to use the -tron suffix, such as Mitsubishi&#x27;s Diamondtron and ViewSonic&#x27;s SonicTron.

Aperture grilles are not as mechanically stable as shadow or slot masks; a tap can cause the image to briefly become distorted, even with damping/support wires.

<text>The shadow mask is one of the two technologies used in the manufacture of cathode-ray tube (CRT) televisions and computer monitors which produce clear, focused color images. The other approach is the aperture grille, better known by its trade name, Trinitron. All early color televisions and the majority of CRT computer monitors used shadow mask technology. Both of these technologies are largely obsolete, having been increasingly replaced since the 1990s by the liquid-crystal display (LCD).

A shadow mask is a metal plate punched with tiny holes that separate the colored phosphors in the layer behind the front glass of the screen. Shadow masks are made by photochemical machining, a technique that allows for the drilling of small holes on metal sheets. Three electron guns at the back of the screen sweep across the mask, with the beams only reaching the screen if they pass through the holes. As the guns are physically separated at the back of the tube, their beams approach the mask from three slightly different angles, so after passing through the holes they hit slightly different locations on the screen.

The screen is patterned with dots of colored phosphor positioned so that each can only be hit by one of the beams coming from the three electron guns. For instance, the blue phosphor dots are hit by the beam from the &quot;blue gun&quot; after passing through a particular hole in the mask. The other two guns do the same for the red and green dots. This arrangement allows the three guns to address the individual dot colors on the screen, even though their beams are much too large and too poorly aimed to do so without the mask in place.

A red, a green, and a blue phosphor are generally arranged in a triangular shape (sometimes called a &quot;triad&quot;). For television use, modern displays (starting in the late 1960s) use rectangular slots instead of circular holes, improving brightness. This variation is sometimes referred to as a slot mask.

==Development==

===Color television===

Color television had been studied even before commercial broadcasting became common, but it was not until the late 1940s that the problem was seriously considered. At the time, a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red, green and blue signals (RGB), broadcast in succession. Most experimental systems broadcast entire frames in sequence, with a colored filter (or &quot;gel&quot;) that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube. Each frame encoded one color of the picture, and the wheel spun in sync with the signal so the correct gel was in front of the screen when that colored frame was being displayed. Because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors, all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets. Another problem was that the mechanical filter made them flicker unless very high refresh rates were used. (This is conceptually similar to a DLP based projection display where a single DLP device is used for all three color channels.)

RCA worked along different lines entirely, using the luminance-chrominance system first introduced by Georges Valensi in 1938. This system did not directly encode or transmit the RGB signals; instead it combined these colors into one overall brightness figure, called the &quot;luminance&quot;. This closely matched the black and white signal of existing broadcasts, allowing the picture to be displayed on black and white televisions. The remaining color information was separately encoded into the signal as a high-frequency modulation to produce a composite video signal. On a black and white television this extra information would be seen as a slight randomization of the image intensity, but the limited resolution of existing sets made this invisible in practice. On color sets the extra information would be detected, filtered out and added to the luminance to re-create the original RGB for display.

Although RCA&#x27;s system had enormous benefits, it had not been successfully developed because it was difficult to produce the display tubes. Black and white TVs used a continuous signal and the tube could be coated with an even painting of phosphor. With RCA&#x27;s system, the color was changing continually along the line, which was far too fast for any sort of mechanical filter to follow. Instead, the phosphor had to be broken down into a discrete pattern of colored spots. Focusing the right signal on each of these tiny spots was beyond the capability of electron guns of the era.

===Numerous attempts===
Through the 1940s and early 1950s a wide variety of efforts were made to address the color problem. A number of major companies continued to work with separate color &quot;channels&quot; with various ways to re-combine the image. RCA was included in this group; on 5 February 1940 they demonstrated a system using three conventional tubes combined to form a single image on a plate of glass, but the image was too dim to be useful.

John Logie Baird, who made the first public color television broadcast using a semi-mechanical system on 4 February 1938, was already making progress on an all-electronic version. His design, the Telechrome, used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor covered plate in the center of the tube. Development had not progressed far when Baird died in 1946. A similar project was the Geer tube, which used a similar arrangement of guns aimed at the back of a single plate covered with small three-sided phosphor covered pyramids.

However, all of these projects had problems with colors bleeding from one phosphor to another. In spite of their best efforts, the wide electron beams simply could not focus tightly enough to hit the individual dots, at least over the entirety of the screen. Moreover, most of these devices were unwieldy; the arrangement of the electron guns around the outside of the screen resulted in a very large display with considerable &quot;dead space&quot;.

===Rear-gun efforts===
A more practical system would use a single gun at the back of the tube, firing at a single multi-color screen on the front. Through the early 1950s, several major electronics companies started development of such systems.

One contender was General Electric&#x27;s Penetron, which used three layers of phosphor painted on top of each other on the back of the screen. Color was selected by changing the energy of the electrons in the beam so that they penetrated to different depths within the phosphor layers. Actually hitting the correct layer proved almost impossible, and GE eventually gave up on the technology for television use, although it went on to see some use in the avionics world where the color gamut could be reduced, often to three colors, which the system was able to achieve.

More common were attempts to use a secondary focussing arrangement just behind the screen to produce the required accuracy. Paramount Pictures worked long and hard on the Chromatron, which used a set of wires behind the screen as a secondary &quot;gun&quot;, further focusing the beam and steering it towards the correct color. Philco&#x27;s &quot;Apple&quot; tube used additional stripes of phosphor that released a burst of electrons when the electron beam swept across them, by timing the bursts it could adjust the passage of the beam and hit the correct colors.

It would be years before any of these systems made their way into production. GE had given up on the Penetron by the early 1960s. Sony tried the Chromatron in the 1960s, but gave up and developed the Trinitron instead. The Apple tube re-emerged in the 1970s and had some success with a variety of vendors. But it was RCA&#x27;s success with the shadow mask that dampened most of these efforts. Until 1968, every color television sold used the RCA shadow mask concept, in the spring of that year Sony introduced their first Trinitron sets.

===Shadow mask===
In 1938 German inventor Werner Flechsig first patented (received 1941, France) the seemingly simple concept of placing a sheet of metal just behind the front of the tube, and punching small holes in it. The holes would be used to focus the beam just before it hit the screen. Independently, Al Schroeder at RCA worked on a similar arrangement, but using three electron guns as well. When the lab leader explained the possibilities of the design to his superiors, he was promised unlimited manpower and funds to get it working. Over a period of only a few months, several prototype color televisions using the system were produced.

The guns, arranged in a delta pattern at the back of the tube, were aimed to focus on the metal plate and scanned it as normal. For much of the time during the scan, the beams would hit the back of the plate and be stopped. However, when the beams passed a hole they would continue to the phosphor in front of the plate. In this way, the plate ensured that the beams were perfectly aligned with the colored phosphor dots. This still left the problem of focusing on the correct colored dot. Normally the beams from the three guns would each be large enough to light up all three colored dots on the screen. The mask helped by mechanically attenuating the beam to a small size just before it hit the screen.

But the real genius of the idea is that the beams approached the metal plate from different angles. After being cut off by the mask, the beams would continue forward at slightly different angles, hitting the screens at slightly different locations. The spread was a function of the distance between the guns at the back of the tube, and the distance between the mask plate and the screen. By painting the colored dots at the correct locations on the screen, and leaving some room between them to avoid interactions, the guns would be guaranteed to hit the right colored spot.

Although the system was simple, it had a number of serious practical problems.

As the beam swept the mask, the vast majority of its energy was deposited on the mask, not the screen in front of it. A typical mask of the era might have only 15% of its surface open. To produce an image as bright as the one on a traditional B&amp;W television, the electron guns in this hypothetical shadow mask system would have to be five times more powerful. Additionally, the dots on the screen were deliberately separated in order to avoid being hit by the wrong gun, so much of the screen was black. This required even more power in order to light up the resulting image. And as the power was divided up among three of these much more powerful guns, the cost of implementation was much higher than for a similar B&amp;W set.

The amount of power deposited on the color screen was so great that thermal loading was a serious problem. The energy the shadow mask absorbs from the electron gun in normal operation causes it to heat up and expand, which leads to blurred or discolored images (see doming). Signals that alternated between light and dark caused cycling that further increased the difficulty of keeping the mask from warping.

Furthermore, the geometry required complex systems to keep the three beams properly positioned across the screen. If you consider the beam when it is sweeping across the middle area of the screen, the beams from the individual guns are each traveling the same distance and meet the holes in the mask at equal angles. In the corners of the screen some beams have to travel farther and all of them meet the hole at a different angle than at the middle of the screen. These issues required additional electronics and adjustments to maintain correct beam positioning.

===Market introduction===
During development, RCA was not sure that they could make the shadow mask system work. Although simple in concept, it was difficult to build in practice, especially at a reasonable price point. The company optioned several other technologies, including the Geer tube, in case the system didn&#x27;t work out. When the first tubes were produced in 1950, these other lines were dropped.

Wartime advances in electronics had opened up large swaths of high frequency transmission to practical use, and in 1948 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) started a series of meetings on the use of what would become the UHF channels. At the time there were very few television sets in use in the United States, so the stakeholder groups quickly settled on the idea of using UHF for a new, incompatible, color format. These meetings eventually selected a competing semi-mechanical field-sequential color system being promoted by CBS. However, in the midst of the meetings, RCA announced their efforts on compatible color, but too late to influence the proceedings. CBS color was introduced in 1950.

However, the promise of the RCA system was so great that the National Television System Committee (NTSC) took up its cause. Between 1950 and 1953 they carried out a huge study on human color perception, and used that information to improve RCA&#x27;s basic concept. RCA had, by this time, produced experimental shadow mask sets that were an enormous leap in quality over any competitors. The system was dim, complex, large, power hungry and expensive for all these reasons, but provided a usable color image, and most importantly, was compatible with existing B&amp;W signals. This had not been an issue in 1948 when the first FCC meetings were held, but by 1953 the number of B&amp;W sets had exploded; there was no longer any way they could simply be abandoned.

When the NTSC proposed that their new standard be ratified by the FCC, CBS dropped its interest in its own system. Everyone in the industry wanting to produce a set then licensed RCA&#x27;s patents, and by the mid-1950s there were a number of sets commercially available. However, color sets were much more expensive than B&amp;W sets of the same size, and required constant adjustment by field staff. By the early 1960s they still represented a small percentage of the television market in North America. The numbers exploded in the early 1960s, with 5,000 sets being produced a week in 1963.

===Manufacture===
Shadow masks are made using a photochemical machining process. It starts out with a sheet of steel or invar alloy that is coated with photoresist, which is baked to solidify it, exposed to UV light through photomasks, developed to remove unexposed resist, the metal is etched using liquid acid, and then the photoresist is removed. One photomask has larger dark spots than the other, this creates tapered apertures. The shadow mask is installed to the screen using metal pieces or a rail or frame that is fused to the funnel or the screen glass respectively, holding the shadow mask in tension to minimize warping (if the mask is flat, used in flat screen CRT computer monitors) and allowing for higher image brightness and contrast. Bimetal springs may be used in CRTs used in TVs to compensate for warping that occurs as the electron beam heats the shadow mask, causing thermal expansion.

===Improvements, market acceptance===
By the 1960s the first RCA patents were ending, while at the same time a number of technical improvements were being introduced. A number of these were worked into the GE Porta-Color set of 1966, which was an enormous success. By 1968 almost every company had a competing design, and color television moved from an expensive option to mainstream devices.

Doming problems due to thermal expansion of the shadow mask were solved in several ways. Some companies used a thermostat to measure the temperature and adjust the scanning to match the expansion. Bi-metallic shadow masks, where differential expansion rates offset the issue, became common in the late 1960s. Invar and similar low-expansion alloys were introduced in the 1980s These materials suffered from easy magnetization that can affect the colors, but this could be generally solved by including an automatic demagnetizing feature. The last solution to be introduced was the &quot;stretched mask&quot;, where the mask was welded to a frame, typically glass, at high temperatures. The frame was then welded to the inside of the tube. When the assembly cooled, the mask was under great tension, which no amount of heating from the guns would be able to remove.

Improving brightness was another major line of work in the 1960s. The use of rare-earth phosphors produced brighter colors and allowed the strength of the electron beams to be reduced slightly. Better focusing systems, especially automatic systems that meant the set spent more time closer to perfect focus, allowed the dots to grow larger on the screen. The Porta-Color used both of these advances and re-arranged the guns to lie beside each other instead of in a triangle, allowing the dots to be extended vertically into slots that covered much more of the screen surface. This design, sometimes known as a &quot;slot mask&quot;, became common in the 1970s.

Another change that was widely introduced in the early 1970s was the use of a black material in the spaces around the inside of the phosphor pattern. This paint absorbed ambient light coming from the room, lowering the amount that was reflected back to the viewer. In order to make this work effectively, the phosphor dots were reduced in size, lowering their brightness. However, the improved contrast compared to ambient conditions allowed the faceplate to be made much more clear, allowing more light from the phosphor to reach the viewer and the actual brightness to increase. Grey-tinted faceplates dimmed the image, but provided better contrast, because ambient light was attenuated before it reached the phosphors, and a second time as it returned to the viewer. Light from the phosphors was attenuated only once. This method changed over time, with TV tubes growing progressively more black over time.

In manufacturing color CRTs, the shadow masks or aperture grilles were also used to expose photoresist on the faceplate to ultraviolet light sources, accurately positioned to simulate arriving electrons for one color at a time. This photoresist, when developed, permitted phosphor for only one color to be applied where required. The process was used a total of three times, once for each color. (The shadow mask or aperture grille had to be removable and accurately re-positionable for this process to succeed.)

<doc id="172534" wikidata="Q637290" url="?curid=172534" title="Cobra (1986 film)">
<text>Cobra is a 1986 American action drama film directed by George P. Cosmatos and written by Sylvester Stallone, who stars in the titular role. The film, loosely based on the 1974 novel &quot;A Running Duck&quot; by Paula Gosling (later published as &quot;Fair Game&quot; and filmed under that title in 1995), co-stars Reni Santoni, Brigitte Nielsen and Andrew Robinson. &quot;Cobra&quot; follows Los Angeles police Lt. Marion &quot;Cobra&quot; Cobretti, who investigates a string of violent crimes and also protects a witness targeted by the perpetrators.

&quot;Cobra&quot; is the final film which featured the collaboration between Stallone and Nielsen after &quot;Rocky IV&quot; (1985) and until &quot;Creed II&quot; (2018), and the only film the pair are both featured in while married to one another in real life, 
before their divorce a year later. The script was largely inspired by Stallone&#x27;s original script for &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; (1984).

&quot;Cobra&quot; was released to generally negative reviews with criticism on its excessive violence and overuse of genre tropes, but it was a box office success and also has since been considered as a cult classic.

==Plot==
When a mass shooting at a Los Angeles supermarket evolves into a hostage crisis, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) summons Lieutenant Marion Cobretti of their elite &quot;Zombie Squad&quot;, to resolve the incident. Cobretti, nicknamed &quot;Cobra,&quot; confronts the shooter, who espouses social Darwinist ideals and mentions a &quot;New World&quot;. Cobretti kills him before he can execute a group of hostages. Detective Monte reprimands Cobretti for disregarding police procedure and Cobretti admonishes a group of reporters for not prioritizing the safety of potential victims.

Unbeknownst to the authorities, the supermarket incident is part of a string of violent crimes committed by &quot;The New World&quot;, a social Darwinist cult that despises modern society and believes in killing the weak, leaving only the strongest and smartest to rule. Ingrid Knudsen, a local model and businesswoman, becomes the New World&#x27;s priority target after she witnesses the group and their leader &quot;Night Slasher&quot; on a killing spree. Knudsen is placed under the protective custody of Cobretti and his partner Sergeant Tony Gonzales following an attempt on her life.

After more attempts to kill Knudsen and Cobretti, Cobretti theorizes that an organization is behind this, but his theory is rebuffed by his superiors. Cobretti and Gonzales leave with Knudsen to the small town of San Remos, where Cobretti and Knudsen fall in love. Nancy Stalk, an LAPD officer and New World&#x27;s second-in-command, infiltrates the police escort. Despite not trusting Stalk, Cobretti does nothing and the group spends the night in a motel.

At dawn, the New World arrives in San Remos on motorcycles and besieges the town on Stalk&#x27;s instructions. In a shootout, Cobretti kills many cultists, but Gonzales is wounded. Cobretti and Knudsen flee in a pickup truck, which the cultists wreck with a roadblock. The pair flee to a steel mill, where Cobretti defeats the rest of the cultists and Stalk is accidentally shot by the Night Slasher.

Cobretti fights with the Night Slasher in hand-to-hand combat and impales him on a hook that drags him into a furnace. The California Highway Patrol secures San Remos and rescues Gonzales. As Cobretti is cleared by his superiors, Monte initially appears apologetic, only to again chastise Cobretti for &quot;overdoing it&quot;. Cobretti punches Monte in the face before riding away with Knudsen on a motorcycle left by the New World.

==Production==
===Development and writing===
When Sylvester Stallone was signed to play the lead in &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;, he decided to rewrite the script almost completely, removing nearly all the comedic aspects and turning it into an action movie that he felt was better suited to him. The studio read his revised script and rejected it. The proposed action scenes would have increased the budget far beyond what they planned. Stallone later channeled his ideas for it into an original script. When Stallone left &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;, Eddie Murphy was brought in to play the lead role.

The novel &quot;A Running Duck&quot; by Paula Gosling was cited as source material, enough so that she received a screen credit.

Sylvester Stallone&#x27;s earlier draft of the script contained many differences from later drafts and the final film. These include the opening shootout taking place in a movie theater (instead of a supermarket), during which many more people are killed; Cobra mentioning how he had a girlfriend who was killed by a psychopath he was trying to catch; an additional nighttime action sequence on a boat where Cobra and Ingrid are hiding and are attacked by the Night Slasher&#x27;s cultists, with Cobra and Gonzalez managing to kill them all; and a different ending, in which Monte, revealed to be the actual leader of the New World, attempts to kill Ingrid at the last second before being killed by Cobretti.

The line, &quot;This is where the law stops and I start, sucker!&quot;, was inspired by a line spoken by Steve McQueen in &quot;The Reivers&quot;.

&quot;Cobra&quot; needed much additional editing because the film was so graphically violent that it originally received an X rating. It was edited to receive an R rating.

===Casting===
Brian Thompson auditioned seven times before he was hired. On the fourth audition he met Stallone, who thought that Thompson was too nice to play the Night Slasher. But after a screen test, he immediately got the job. Also, in the original script, the Night Slasher was called Abaddon, possibly after the &quot;angel of the abyss&quot; from the Bible.

Thompson repeatedly sought Stallone&#x27;s advice about how to play the Night Slasher, including questions about his background and personal motivations, but Stallone showed no interest in the subject and told Thompson that the character was simply evil. In an unfortunate surprise for Thompson, after filming was completed, director Cosmatos unexpectedly told him: &quot;You could have been good if you had listened to me.&quot;

Stallone acknowledged &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; as an influence and &quot;Cobra&quot; reunited two actors from the film: Reni Santoni and Andy Robinson.

Brigitte Nielsen, Stallone&#x27;s then-wife who he had met filming &quot;Rocky IV&quot;, was cast as Ingrid Knudsen.

===Filming===
Originally, &quot;Cobra&quot; was supposed to be filmed in Seattle, climaxing with a motorcycle chase scene on a ferry between the islands. Even though everything was prepared to start filming the final theatrical version of the scene at night, Stallone demanded the ending be changed because of the mosquito problem at that time, which would have made night time filming very difficult to endure.

The supporting cast and extras were forbidden from talking to Stallone on set.

At one point during filming, Stallone complained to cinematographer Ric Waite that they were falling behind and that he needed to push his crew to work harder. Waite responded by telling Stallone that the delays were due to his fooling around with Brigitte Nielsen and showing off for his bodyguards. Although Stallone was shocked that somebody would talk to him that way, he cleaned up his act and behaved more professionally, although he returned to his old egocentric behavior a few weeks later. Waite later said in an interview that, despite his huge ego, Stallone had a great sense of humor. He said George P. Cosmatos would have made a great producer, but he was a terrible director.

During a stunt scene, driver Kerry Rossall and another stuntman were injured after Rossall intentionally crashed a van into a wall. Nielsen was nearly hit by the van during a previous take.

For the Night Slasher&#x27;s monologue in the lead-up to the final fight, Brian Thompson did the scene with the script supervisor standing in for Stallone, who was busy watching a basketball game on TV.

The custom 1950 Mercury driven by Cobretti was actually owned by Sylvester Stallone. The studio produced stunt doubles of the car for use in some of the action sequences, such as the jump from the second floor of the parking garage. The production built three &quot;Cobra cars&quot; for stunt work. Although they were identical on the outside, their moving parts were designed for specific sequences, involving high-speed swipes with other vehicles, 180-degree turns, jumps, and 360-degree spins.

The knife used by the Night Slasher was made for the film by knife designer Herman Schneider. Sylvester Stallone asked Schneider to create a knife that audiences would never forget. Cobretti uses a custom Colt Gold Cup National Match 1911, modified to chamber 9×19mm Parabellum. Later in the film, he uses a Jatimatic submachine gun.

=== Editing ===
The first rough cut was over two hours long (the closest estimated original running time is 130 minutes). It was then shortened to a roughly two-hour director&#x27;s cut which was intended to be released in theaters. However, after &quot;Top Gun&quot; became a smash hit, Stallone and Warner Bros. were worried that &quot;Cobra&quot;—which would premiere the following week—would be overshadowed, so in order to ensure at least one extra screening each day the movie was heavily re-edited. Stallone removed much of the plot and scenes involving characters other than his own. Warner Bros. also demanded that the more graphic scenes be cut down or removed entirely because they were &quot;too intense,&quot; and that some action scenes be cut for pacing. The extended television version of the film is approximately 6 minutes longer than the theatrical release. When first submitted to the MPAA the film received an X rating, necessitating even more cuts.

==Music==

The musical score was composed by Sylvester Levay. An audio cassette and vinyl version were released on September 21, 1986, followed by a CD which was released in 1992 as the &quot;Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;.

Stan Bush&#x27;s song &quot;The Touch&quot;, heard in &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot; (1986), was originally written for &quot;Cobra&quot;. It is said &quot;Feel The Heat&quot; was overheard during the filming of its music video by Jean Beauvoir when they were editing in the same building complex, and was added because Stallone loved the song.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Cobra&quot; opened the widest for a Warner Bros. release at the time opening on 2,131 screens and debuted at number one at the U.S. box office with a Memorial Day weekend debut of $15.7 million. It eventually went on to gross $160 million, over six times its estimated $25 million budget. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the film was still considered a disappointment because its $48 million at the box office in the US did not live up to the success of Rambo.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 17% based on 23 reviews, with an average rating of 3.40/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;A disengaged Sylvester Stallone plays the titular &quot;Cobra&quot; with no bite in this leaden action thriller, queasily fixated on wanton carnage and nothing else.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 25 out of 100 based on 9 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B&quot; on scale of A to F.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; stated that &quot;Stallone&#x27;s character is an empty hulk...the few attempts to provide us with little insights into his character are downright laughable.&quot; Nina Darnton of &quot;The New York Times&quot; opined that the film &quot;pretends to be against the wanton violence of a disintegrating society, but it&#x27;s really the apotheosis of that violence...[it] shows such contempt for the most basic American values&quot;, and Vincent Canby called it &quot;disturbing for the violence it portrays, the ideas it represents and the large number of people who will undoubtedly go to see it and cheer on its dangerous hero.&quot; Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; panned the film, saying &quot;&quot;Cobra&quot;&#x27;s pretentious emptiness, its dumbness, its two-faced morality make it a movie that begs to be laughed off.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a sleek, extremely violent and exciting police thriller&quot; and compared Cobra favorably to Rocky and Rambo.

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; compared Cobra to Dirty Harry when giving the film 2 and 1/2 stars and summarizing it as &quot;Filthy Harry&quot;. He wrote: &quot;Whereas Clint Eastwood simply would have squinted at Robinson, Stallone takes a more violent approach. Maybe that&#x27;s the difference between actors--Eastwood can be droll; Stallone more often crosses the border to primeval.&quot; Siskel and Roger Ebert did not give the film a feature review on their TV show, but both gave it negative attention during a late-1986 segment on new video releases, in which Siskel noted that the film had a great opening sequence (the supermarket hostage scene) and couldn&#x27;t maintain the momentum. Ebert lamented that Stallone was squandering his talent and vast potential.

In the 1996 movie guide &quot;Seen That, Now What?&quot;, the film was given the rating of &quot;C−&quot;, stating that the film is &quot;a graceless vigilante thriller that&#x27;s strictly for hardcore action junkies.&quot;

Then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan viewed this film at Camp David on June 6, 1986.

===Accolades===
&quot;Cobra&quot; was nominated for six Razzie Awards, including Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Sylvester Stallone), Worst Actress (Brigitte Nielsen), Worst Supporting Actor and Worst New Star (both for Brian Thompson) and Worst Screenplay.

Director Nicolas Winding Refn is a fan of &quot;Cobra&quot;. In Refn&#x27;s cult film &quot;Drive&quot; the main character has a toothpick in his mouth in some scenes; this is Refn&#x27;s homage to the opening scene where Stallone has a matchstick in his mouth. The main star of the film, Ryan Gosling, also said in interview that he is a fan of Stallone and &quot;Cobra&quot; which is why he &quot;borrowed&quot; his character&#x27;s toothpick habit from Cobra.

==Other media==
===Video game===

In 1986, the film was made into a video game by Ocean Software for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and Amstrad CPC.

===Aborted sequel and TV series===
In 1987, Cannon Films, along with Warner Bros. attempted to make a sequel, &quot;Cobra Part II&quot;, but the film never materialized.

In 2019, a television series was in development with Robert Rodriguez serving as director/creator. , it is not known if this project is still in development.

<text>Nehemiah Curtis &quot;Skip&quot; James (June 9, 1902October 3, 1969) was an American Delta blues singer, guitarist, pianist and songwriter. AllMusic stated: &quot;Coupling an oddball guitar tuning set against eerie, falsetto vocals, James&#x27; early recordings could make the hair stand up on the back of your neck.&quot;

His guitar playing is noted for its dark, minor-key sound, played in an open D-minor tuning with an intricate fingerpicking technique. James first recorded for Paramount Records in 1931, but these recordings sold poorly, having been released during the Great Depression, and he drifted into obscurity.

After a long absence from the public eye, James was rediscovered in 1964 by blues enthusiasts including John Fahey, helping further the blues and folk music revival of the 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, James appeared at folk and blues festivals, gave concerts around the country, and recorded several albums for various record labels. His songs have influenced generations of musicians and have been adapted by numerous artists. He has been hailed as &quot;one of the seminal figures of the blues&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Nehemiah Curtis James was born on June 9, 1902, in a segregated hospital near Bentonia, Mississippi. His mother Phyllis worked as a cook and babysitter on the Woodbine Plantation, which was 15 miles south of Yazoo City. His father Eddie James, a bootlegger who was described as a &quot;local lowlife&quot; by Stephen Calt, left the family around 1907. He later reformed and became a preacher. As a youth, James heard local musicians, such as Henry Stuckey, from whom he learned to play the guitar, and the brothers Charlie and Jesse Sims. His mother bought him a $2.50 guitar, which was his first instrument. James later began playing the organ in his teens. He later left Bentonia in 1919, and began working on road construction and levee-building crews in Mississippi in the early 1920s, and wrote what is perhaps his earliest song, &quot;Illinois Blues&quot;, about his experiences as a laborer. He began playing the guitar in open D-minor tuning.

===1920s and 1930s===
For most of the 1920s, James worked a series of illicit jobs, such as bootlegging, gambling, and procuring. His lifestyle was reportedly so &quot;unbridled&quot;, that when he returned to Bentonia from Dallas, Texas, in 1929, he was met with local reports of his supposed &quot;violent death&quot;. He was met with the same reports five years earlier when he returned from Arkansas. That same year, in 1929, he met a local musician named Johnny Temple, who became his first protégé. The 23 year old Temple learned how to play in cross-note tuning, which was then unknown to musicians who were from the Jackson area, and also attempted to copy James&#x27; high falsetto voice, until he advised Temple to sing in his natural voice. James also operated a music school for would-be blues musicians in Jackson, giving lessons on guitar, piano, and even violin.

James continued working locally as a street singer. In early 1931, James auditioned for the record shop owner and talent scout H. C. Speir in Jackson, Mississippi. Speir placed blues performers with various record labels, including Paramount Records. On the strength of this audition, James traveled to Grafton, Wisconsin, to record for Paramount. His 1931 records are considered idiosyncratic among prewar blues recordings and formed the basis of his reputation as a musician.

As was typical of his era, James recorded various styles of music – blues, spirituals, cover versions, and original compositions – frequently blurring the lines between genres and sources. For example, &quot;I&#x27;m So Glad&quot; was derived from a 1927 song, &quot;So Tired&quot;, by Art Sizemore and George A. Little, recorded in 1928 by Gene Austin and by Lonnie Johnson (Johnson&#x27;s version was entitled &quot;I&#x27;m So Tired of Livin&#x27; All Alone&quot;). James&#x27;s biographer Stephen Calt, echoing the opinion of several music critics, considered the finished product totally original, &quot;one of the most extraordinary examples of fingerpicking found in guitar music&quot;. Several other recordings from the Grafton session, such as &quot;Hard Time Killing Floor Blues&quot;, &quot;Devil Got My Woman&quot;, &quot;Jesus Is a Mighty Good Leader&quot;, and &quot;22-20 Blues&quot; (the basis of Robert Johnson&#x27;s better-known &quot;32-20 Blues&quot;), have been similarly influential. Very few original copies of James&#x27;s Paramount 78 rpm records have survived.

The Great Depression struck just as James&#x27;s recordings were hitting the market. Sales were poor as a result, and he gave up performing the blues to become the choir director in his father&#x27;s church. James was later an ordained minister in Baptist and Methodist churches, but the extent of his involvement in religious activities is unknown.

=== Rediscovery and legacy ===

For the next thirty-three years, James made no known recordings and performed sporadically. He was virtually unknown to the general public until about 1960. Blues singer and guitarist Big Joe Williams believed that James had already passed, having been murdered in Mississippi. In 1964, blues enthusiasts John Fahey, Bill Barth, and Henry Vestine found him in a hospital in Tunica, Mississippi. According to Calt, the &quot;rediscovery&quot; of both James and Son House at virtually the same time was the start of the blues revival in the United States.

In July 1964, James and other rediscovered musicians appeared at the Newport Folk Festival. Several photographs by the blues promoter Dick Waterman captured this performance, James&#x27;s first in over 30 years. James subsequently recorded for Takoma Records, Melodeon Records, and Vanguard Records and performed at various engagements until his death from cancer on October 3, 1969, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the age of 67.

More of James&#x27;s recordings have been available since his death than were available during his lifetime. His 1931 recordings and several of his recordings and concerts from the 1960s have been reissued on numerous compact discs, in and out of print. His songs were not initially recorded as frequently as those of other rediscovered blues musicians. However, the British rock band Cream recorded &quot;I&#x27;m So Glad&quot;, providing James with $10,000 in royalties, the only windfall of his career. Subsequently, Cream&#x27;s adaptation was recorded by other groups. James&#x27; &quot;22-20&quot; inspired the name of the English group 22-20s. The British post-rock band Hope of the States released a song partially about the life of James, entitled &quot;Nehemiah&quot;, which reached number 30 on the UK Singles Chart. Only 15 copies of James&#x27; original shellac 78 recordings are still in existence, and have become extremely sought after by collectors such as John Tefteller.

In 2004, Wim Wenders directed the film &quot;The Soul of a Man&quot; (the second part of &quot;The Blues&quot;, a series produced by Martin Scorsese), focusing on the music of Blind Willie Johnson, J.B. Lenoir and James. Because James had not been filmed before the 1960s, Keith B. Brown played the part of the young James in the documentary. James&#x27; song &quot;Hard Time Killing Floor Blues&quot; was featured in the 2000 film &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; and included on the soundtrack album.

James was the inspiration for Dion&#x27;s 2007 blues album, &quot;Son of Skip James&quot;, which peaked at No. 4.

James was honored with a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail in Bentonia, his hometown.

In 2020, James&#x27; song &quot;Devil Got My Woman&quot; was added to the Grammy Hall of Fame.

===Personality===
James was described as aloof and moody. The musicologist Dick Spottswood commented, &quot;Skip James, you never knew. Skip could be sunshine, or thunder and lightning depending on his whim of the moment&quot;.

==Musical style==
===Equipment===
The guitar that James played in his 1931 sessions is now generally accepted to have been a 12-string Stella guitar restrung as a six-string. When he was rediscovered in the 1960s, he typically played a Gibson J-185, Gibson J-45, Martin D-18, and a Martin D-28.

===James as guitarist===
James often played guitar with an open D-minor tuning (D–A–D–F–A–D), resulting in the &quot;deep&quot; sound of the 1931 recordings. He reportedly learned this tuning from his musical mentor, the unrecorded bluesman Henry Stuckey, who in turn was said to have acquired it from Bahamian soldiers during the First World War, despite the fact that his service card shows he did not serve overseas. Robert Johnson also recorded in this tuning, his &quot;Hell Hound on My Trail&quot; being based on James&#x27;s &quot;Devil Got My Woman.&quot; James&#x27;s classically informed fingerpicking style was fast and clean, using the entire register of the guitar, with heavy, hypnotic bass lines. His style of playing had more in common with the Piedmont blues of the East Coast than with the Delta blues of his native Mississippi.

===The &quot;Bentonia School&quot;===
James is sometimes associated with the Bentonia School, which is either a subgenre of blues music or a style of playing it. In a 1994 biography of James, &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Be the Devil: Skip James and the Blues&quot;, Stephen Calt maintained that no style of blues originated in Bentonia and that the &quot;Bentonia School&quot; is simply a notion of later blues writers who overestimated the provinciality of Mississippi during the early 20th century, when railways linked small towns. Calt asserts these writers failed to see that in the case of Bentonia bluesman Jack Owens, &quot;the &#x27;tradition&#x27; he bore primarily consisted of musical scraps from James&#x27; table&quot;. Owens and other musicians who may have been contemporaries of James were not recorded until the revival of interest in blues music in the 1960s. Whether the work of these musicians constituted a &quot;school&quot;, and whether James originated it or was a member of it himself, remain open questions. One of the last living links to the original Bentonia school is Jimmy &quot;Duck&quot; Holmes, the owner of the famous Blue Front Cafe in Bentonia, Mississippi. Holmes learned to play in this particular style directly from Henry Stuckey, who reportedly taught James and Owens himself. Accordingly, Duck is called the &quot;last of the Bentonia Bluesmen.&quot;

==Discography==
===Paramount 78-RPM records, 1931===
===Later recordings, 1964–1969===
Despite poor health, James recorded several LPs from 1964 to 1969, mostly revisiting his 1931 sides, traditional music, and spirituals, but also including a handful of newly written blues meditating on his illness and convalescence. These five prolific years have not been thoroughly documented: recordings, outtakes, and interviews not released on James&#x27;s LPs (which have been repeatedly cannibalized and reissued) are scattered among many compilations released by small labels. Previously unreleased performances continue to be found and released but have been left largely unexplained, sometimes hours&#x27; worth at a time. Original recordings and reissues are listed below.

<text>Vasily Ivanovich Alekseyev (; 7 January 1942 – 25 November 2011) was a Soviet weightlifter. He set 80 world-records and 81 Soviet records in weightlifting and won Olympic gold medals at the 1972 and 1976 games.

==Biography==
At the age of 18, Alekseyev began practicing weightlifting at Trud VSS, trained by his coach Rudolf Plyukfelder until 1968, when he began to train solo. He was not a naturally large man like other super heavyweights but was encouraged to gain strength by adding weight. In January 1970, Alekseyev set his first world record, and during the 1970 World Weightlifting Championship in Columbus, he was the first man to clean and jerk 500 pounds (227 kg) in competition. During one of his early world records, Oscar State OBE remarked that the weight of over 460 pounds (209 kg) in the Olympic press looked so easy it could have been a broomstick. This was the beginning of a series of 80 world records Alekseyev set between 1970 and 1977. He received bonus funds by the Soviet government every time he set a world record (Soviet athletics were funded by the state), so he made it a point to gradually increase his world records by 1.1 pounds or 0.5 kg. He was unbeaten and held the World Championship and European Championship titles for those eight years. He was the first man to total over 600 kg in the triple event.

Alekseyev&#x27;s performance in the Moscow Olympics of 1980 was a disappointment. He had by then become more of a recluse, training by himself without a coach. In the snatch he set his opening weight too high and was unable to lift it, scoring zero kilograms as the result. He retired from weightlifting after the Moscow Olympics.

In 1987, Alekseyev was elected to represent the Ryazan District for the Soviet Union&#x27;s Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies. Alekseyev worked as a coach between 1990 and 1992. Under his leadership, the Unified Team earned ten medals in weightlifting at the 1992 Summer Olympics, including five golds.

From 1966 Alekseyev lived in Shakhty, where in 1971 he graduated from the branch of the Novocherkassk Polytechnical Institute. He died on 25 November 2011 in Germany in a clinic where he had been sent for serious heart problems. He was 69. The Russian Weightlifting Federation reported his death and called him a &quot;Soviet sports legend&quot; and &quot;one of the strongest people in the world&quot;. He was survived by wife Olimpiada and sons Sergey and Dmitry. Dmitry competed nationally in weightlifting, placing fourth at the 1988 Soviet weightlifting championships.

==Legacy and awards==
Vladimir Vysotsky devoted his &quot;Song about weightlifter&quot; (, 1971) to Alekseyev.

Alekseyev was featured on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; 14 April 1975, titled &quot;World&#x27;s Strongest Man.&quot; In 1999, in Greece, Alekseyev was acknowledged as the best sportsman of the 20th century. He was also awarded: Order of Lenin (1972), Order of Friendship of Peoples, Order of the Badge of Honour (1970), and Order of the Red Banner of Labour (1972). In 1993, he was elected a member of the International Weightlifting Federation Hall of Fame.

In Shakhty, where he lived much of his life, there is a street and park named after him, as well as his monument installed in 2014.

<text>Flinders University, established as The Flinders University of South Australia is a public research university based in Adelaide, South Australia, with a footprint extending across a number of locations in South Australia and the Northern Territory. The main campus is in Bedford Park, about south of the Adelaide city centre. Other campuses include Tonsley, Adelaide central business district, Renmark, Alice Springs, and Darwin.

Founded in 1966, it was named in honour of British navigator Matthew Flinders, who explored and surveyed the Australian and South Australian coastline in the early 19th century. In 2022 there were 25,247 students enrolled at the university.

==History==
===Origins and construction===
By the late 1950s, the University of Adelaide&#x27;s North Terrace campus was approaching capacity. In 1960, Premier Thomas Playford announced that of state government-owned land in Burbank (now Bedford Park) would be allocated to the University of Adelaide for the establishment of a second campus.

Planning began in 1961. The principal-designate of the new campus, economist and professor Peter Karmel, was adamant that the new campus should operate independently from the North Terrace campus. He hoped that the Bedford Park campus would be free to innovate and not be bound by tradition.

Capital works began in 1962 with a grant of £3.8 million from the Australian Universities Commission. Architect Geoff Harrison, in conjunction with architectural firm Hassell, McConnell and Partners, designed a new university that, with future expansions, could eventually accommodate up to 6000 students.

===Independence and opening===
In 1965, the Australian Labor Party won the state election and Frank Walsh became premier. The ALP wished to break up the University of Adelaide&#x27;s hegemony over tertiary education in the state, and announced that they intended the Bedford Park campus to be an independent institution.
On 17 March 1966, a bill was passed by state parliament officially creating The Flinders University of South Australia. Although the Labor Party had favoured the name &quot;University of South Australia&quot;, academic staff wished that the university be named after a &quot;distinguished but uncontroversial&quot; person. They settled upon British navigator Matthew Flinders, who explored and surveyed the South Australian coastline in 1802. Its original coat of arms, designed by a professor in the Fine Arts faculty, included a reproduction of Flinders&#x27; ship &quot;Investigator&quot; and his journal &quot;A Voyage to Terra Australis&quot;, open to the page in which Flinders described the coast adjacent the campus site.

Flinders University was opened by Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, on 25 March 1966.

Originally created as an extension of the University of Adelaide, the university council resolved in August 1965 that it would become a separate, independent institution, functioning under its own council from 1 July 1966. Peter Karmel was the first Vice-Chancellor, and teaching at &quot;the University of Adelaide at Bedford Park&quot; began in 1966 with 400 students.

A significant early initiative was the decision to build the Flinders Medical Centre on land adjacent to the campus and to base the university&#x27;s Medical School within this new public hospital – the first such integration in Australia. Flinders accepted undergraduate medical students in 1974, with the FMC opening the following year.

===Expansion and restructuring===
In 1990, the biggest building project on campus since the mid-1970s saw work commence on three new buildings – Law and Commerce; Engineering; and Information Science and Technology. Approval for the establishment of a School of Engineering was given in 1991 and degrees in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, and Biomedical Engineering were established shortly afterwards.

In 1991, as part of a restructuring of higher education in South Australia, Flinders merged with the adjacent Sturt Campus of the former South Australian College of Advanced Education.

In 1992 a four-faculty structure was adopted.

In 1998, the Centre for Remote Health, a rural teaching hospital based in Alice Springs, was established jointly with the Northern Territory University (now Charles Darwin University). This was expanded further in 2011 with the establishment of the Northern Territory Medical Program.

Since 2000 the university has established new disciplines in areas including Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy and more disciplines of Engineering.

In 2011, the bacteria genus Flindersiella was named after the university after the strain was found on a tree on campus grounds.

In 2015, the university opened a new campus at Tonsley, the former site of the Mitsubishi Motors Australia plant in Southern Adelaide. This campus houses the university&#x27;s School of Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics, along with the Medical Device Research Institute, the Centre for Nanoscale Science and Technology (now known as the Flinders Institute for Nanoscale Science &amp; Technology) and Flinders technology start-up company Re-Timer.

In 2016, the university celebrated its 50th anniversary with a calendar of public events, and a publication summarising the highlights of the university&#x27;s history, research, and alumni achievements over the last 50 years. 2016 also saw the opening of the award-winning student hub and plaza, transforming the central campus.

The university&#x27;s strategic plan &quot;Making a Difference - The 2025 Agenda&quot; released in 2016 set an ambitious vision for the coming decade for Flinders to reach the top ten of Australian Universities, and the top one per cent in the world.

On 1 July 2017, the university restructured from a two-tier academic system of four faculties and 14 schools, to a single-tier structure consisting of six colleges.

In 2019 the university announced an additional $100 million investment in research and a further $100 million in education over a five-year period to support it to meet its strategic goals.

The university also in 2019 announced plans for a substantial development on a tract on land on the northern portion of the Bedford Park Campus adjacent to the Flinders hospitals precinct. Known as &quot;Flinders Village&quot; the decade-long development will deliver research facilities, student accommodation, commercial premises and amenities. The catalyst for the initiative was the extension of the Clovelly Park rail line to the Flinders precinct. The $141m rail line and Flinders Station project began operation in December 2020. Stage one of the &quot;Flinders Village&quot; development is the construction of a Health and Medical Research Building. Construction began in December 2021 and the building, which will be home to Flinders Health and Medical Research Institute, is scheduled for completion in 2024.

In 2021 the university announced it would be expanding its Central Business District presence, establishing a vertical campus as the anchor tenant in Festival Tower, a major development scheduled for completion in 2024 adjacent to Parliament House and the Adelaide Railway Station on North Terrace.

In 2022, the newly elected state Labor government led by Peter Malinauskas proposed setting up a commission to investigate the possibility of a merger of South Australia&#x27;s three public universities: the University of South Australia, the University of Adelaide, and Flinders. The University of Adelaide and University of South Australia indicated their intention to merge. Flinders University chose to remain an independent entity.

<text>Stavanger, officially the Stavanger Municipality, is a city and municipality in Norway. It is the third largest city and third largest metropolitan area in Norway (through conurbation with neighboring Sandnes) and the administrative center of Rogaland county. The municipality is the fourth most populous in Norway. Located on the Stavanger Peninsula in southwest Norway, Stavanger counts its official founding year as 1125, the year the Stavanger Cathedral was completed. Stavanger&#x27;s core is to a large degree 18th- and 19th-century wooden houses that are protected and considered part of the city&#x27;s cultural heritage. This has caused the town center and inner city to retain a small-town character with an unusually high ratio of detached houses, and has contributed significantly to spreading the city&#x27;s population growth to outlying parts of Greater Stavanger.

The city&#x27;s population rapidly grew in the late 20th century due to its oil industry. Stavanger is known today as the Oil Capital of Norway. Norwegian energy company Equinor, the largest company in the Nordic region, has its headquarters in Stavanger. Multiple educational institutions for higher education are located in Stavanger. The largest of these is the University of Stavanger.

Domestic and international military installations are located in Stavanger, including the NATO Joint Warfare Centre. Other international establishments, and especially local branches of foreign oil and gas companies, contribute further to a significant foreign population in the city. The city has a strong international profile and 22.1% of the population has an immigrant background. In 2020, it was rated as the most liveable city for European expatriates in Norway as well as 5th in Europe by ECA International. Stavanger has, since the early 2000s, consistently had an unemployment rate significantly lower than the European average. In August 2022, the unemployment rate was 1.6%. The city also appears on various lists of most expensive cities in the world, and it has even been ranked as the world&#x27;s most expensive city by certain indices.

The climate of the city is very mild by Nordic standards due to a strong maritime influence. As a result, winter usually remains above freezing whereas heat waves are rare and seldom long. Rainfall is common, although less so than in areas further north on the coastline.

Stavanger is served by international airport Stavanger Airport, Sola, which offers flights to cities in most major European countries, as well as a limited number of intercontinental charter flights. The airport was rated as one of the world&#x27;s most punctual airports of its category by OAG in 2020.

Every two years, Stavanger organizes the Offshore Northern Seas (ONS), which is the second largest exhibition and conference for the energy sector. The Gladmat food festival is also held each year and is considered to be one of Scandinavia&#x27;s leading food festivals. The city is also known for being one of the nation&#x27;s premier culinary clusters. Stavanger was awarded the 2008 European Capital of Culture alongside Liverpool.

==History==

The first traces of settlement in the Stavanger region come from the days when the ice retreated after the last ice age c. 10,000 years ago. A number of historians have argued convincingly that North-Jæren was an economic and military center as far back as the 9th and 10th centuries with the consolidation of the nation at the Battle of Hafrsfjord around 872. Stavanger grew into a center of church administration and an important south-west coast market town around 1100–1300.
Stavanger fulfilled an urban role prior to its status as city (1125), from around the time the Stavanger bishopric was established in the 1120s. Bishop Reinald, who may have come from Winchester, England, is said to have started construction of Stavanger Cathedral (&quot;Stavanger domkirke&quot;) around 1100. It was finished around 1125, and the city of Stavanger counts 1125 as its year of foundation.

With the Protestant Reformation in 1536, Stavanger&#x27;s role as a religious center declined, and the establishment of Kristiansand in the early 17th century led to the relocation of the bishopric. However, rich herring fisheries in the 19th century gave the city new life.

Stavanger was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1867, a small area of Hetland municipality (population: 200) was transferred to the city of Stavanger. Again on 1 January 1879, another area of Hetland (population: 1,357) was transferred to Stavanger. Then again on 1 January 1906, the city again annexed another area of Hetland (population: 399). On 1 July 1923, part of Hetland (population: 3,063) was moved to the city once again. Finally on 1 July 1953, a final portion of Hetland (population: 831) was moved to Stavanger. In the 1960s, the work of the Schei Committee pushed for many municipal mergers across Norway. As a result of this, on 1 January 1965, the city of Stavanger (population: 51,470) was merged with the neighboring municipalities of Madla (population: 6,025) and most of Hetland (population: 20,861).

The city&#x27;s history is a continuous alternation between economic booms and recessions. For long periods of time its most important industries have been shipping, shipbuilding, the fish canning industry and associated subcontractors.

In 1969, a new boom started as oil was first discovered in the North Sea.
After much discussion, Stavanger was chosen to be the on-shore center for the oil industry on the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, and a period of hectic growth followed.

On 1 January 2020, the neighboring municipalities of Finnøy and Rennesøy merged with Stavanger to form a new, larger municipality.

===City development===

Stavanger is one of Norway&#x27;s oldest cities. It emerged in the 12th century during a period of population growth and increasing urbanisation throughout northern Europe. The archaeological and historical sources about the first city development are sparse. Therefore, there is much we do not know about the first city development. It stands out as an important area from early times, as a desirable foothold for the monarchy and the church, as both needed a strong foothold in the South West coast area. In North Jæren, rich archaeological material suggests that the chiefs held considerable power from the early Iron Age. Stavanger had a natural harbor and was, with Jæren in the south, strategically important to the county of the East as well as to the shipping route along the western coast and the fertile Ryfylke Islands in the north.

The earliest Christian impulses in Norway came to Stavanger region through trade connections with Continental Europe and Great Britain. This flourished during the Viking era. In the mid 10th century, traditional Norse burial customs ceased in the Stavanger area, at the same time as the first Christian priests began their work. Big stone crosses are visible memorials of this early Christian age (including the Tjora and Kvitsøy). On the overland approach to Stavanger, a memorial cross of HERS and lendmann Erling Skjalgsson was erected after his fall in 1028. Erling controlled power over the South West coast, and the location of the cross indicates that he had a special connection to Stavanger. The inscription on the cross shows a priest was responsible for the inscription, and he may have performed an early service at a church on site.

Archaeological investigations in the current downtown and in the crypt of the Cathedral show that the great fire of 1272 probably left large parts of the city and the cathedral in ruins, including the Romanesque chancel of the cathedral. The reconstruction after the fire led to the cathedral&#x27;s Western Front being replaced with a vestibule, as well as to the construction (or reconstruction) of St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Bishop&#x27;s Chapel, the Gothic cathedral and the expansion of the stone cellar at Kongsberg.

Stavanger has a long history of education in Western Europe. It was the monastery here that first saw the need to train new employees through education. The first organized teaching in the city probably took place at a Benedictine monastery in the town, either Olav&#x27;s Monastery or Monastery of people from the mid-12th century.

One of the most important events in Stavanger&#x27;s city history was the gift letter that King Magnus Erlingsson gave to Stavanger Bishop Eirik Ivarsson in the second half of the 1100s. Exactly when the king made this gift letter, and under what circumstances it happened, is unknown. It may have been in 1163–1164, in connection with the King Magnus&#x27;s coronation, but could also have been around 1181–1184, in connection with the support Stavanger Bishop Erik gave King Magnus at the end of the king&#x27;s fight against the late King Sverre.

It is undoubtedly correct to characterize Stavanger as a church city throughout the Middle Ages, up to the Reformation. The Reformation, however, dealt a hard blow to the Church in specific and Stavanger in general. The cathedral, the bishop and canons of the monastery had been large landowners. Recession of the city began with the loss of people in rural areas, as a result of which the revenues of the cathedral and the bishop fell dramatically due to reduced rental income. In 1537 the bishop&#x27;s and the monastery&#x27;s estate and property was confiscated by the king. Kongsberg was plundered by Christoffer Trondsen in 1539, at which time St. Swithun&#x27;s casket disappeared and Bishop Hoskuld Hoskuldsson may have been executed.

===World War II===

In a prelude to the invasion, on 8 April, the German freighter (6,780 grt.) anchored by Ulsnes. &quot;Roda&quot; was reportedly loaded with coke, but customs officials and police authorities became suspicious about other cargo when they observed that the ship was not riding deep in the water. The ship was boarded and was ordered to move to Riska. However, &quot;Roda&quot; did not move, and the captain of the , Niels Larsen Bruun, decided on his own initiative to sink the ship. After sending the crew off in lifeboats, &quot;Æger&quot; used 25 shots with Bofors guns to sink &quot;Roda&quot;.

Early on the morning of 9 April 1940, explosions and bomb blasts from Sola-edge and news bulletins on radio announced the German attack on Norway. Sola Airport was the Germans&#x27; first target on North Jæren. The airport was attacked by six German Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighters at around 8 am. The airport had been built in 1937, and in April 1940 fortifications round the airport were not yet complete. Fortifications consisted of a concrete bunker still under construction and several open shooting positions. Armament consisted of three heavy anti-aircraft machine guns, three heavy machine guns configured for ground targets, and some light machine guns at the disposal of the approximately 80 soldiers who defended the airport. The bomber wing was transferred to Sola Airport in 1939, but the planes, a total of six Fokker and three Caproni aircraft, were old and outdated. Shortly after the attack began, however, they took off.

The German air attack increased in intensity. The bombardment lasted for about an hour before 10 slow Ju 52 transport aircraft arrived over the airport. They had taken off from the airport at Hamburg a few hours earlier. In a parachute assault, the transport planes first dropped yellow containers containing weapons and equipment, then between 10 and 12 paratroopers from each plane. This was only the second ever wartime parachute assault; the first had occurred only three hours earlier, when a bridge south of Denmark was captured in the same way. At the Sola airport, the concrete bunker held out longest, but was eventually put out of action with a hand grenade. While Norwegian soldiers were badly injured in the attempted defense, there were no fatalities; in contrast, the Germans lost several. Lieutenant Thor Tang, who led the Norwegian defense of the airport, capitulated at 10:00, and the Germans immediately began landing troops, fuel and other supplies. In all, 200 to 300 transport aircraft arrived in Sola during invasion day, and by evening several hundred soldiers and large quantities of materiel had been moved from Germany to Sola.

By around 12:30 on 9 April, the first German troops advanced into Stavanger without resistance. The police station, telephone office, telegraph center, post office, port office, customs house and the gas company were the most important places, and now came under control of the Germans. The city was conquered without conflict, but the first sparks of resistance had been ignited, and several men left the city and made their way to the Norwegian troops inside Gjesdal, there to join the armed struggle against the enemy.
The Germans had placed a high priority to have a good railway connection between the air base at Sola – Stavanger district, and the rest of the country. However, it was not until 29 April 1944, that the Southern Railway was completed to Stavanger. In 1940, the Germans had envisioned it to be completed no later than 1 November 1941.

After Hitler&#x27;s death in 1945, Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz took over leadership of the German forces, and on 9 May 1945, gave the head of the German armed forces in Norway, General Franz Böhme, orders that &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; in Norway, Josef Terboven, was deposed and that all his duties were transferred to Böhme. To Böhme, in turn, he gave the task of how the capitulation of Festung Norwegen was to be implemented. There were around 15,000 German soldiers in Rogaland in 1945, and it was there where the commander of 274 Infantry Division, General Weckman, gave the formal German surrender.

Before repatriation, the Germans were required to remain and clean up after five years of occupation. There were 180 German minefields in Rogaland, with a total of 480,000 mines, all of which the German Wehrmacht were required to clear. Sixty-two Germans were killed and 94 were injured during mine clearance in Rogaland. Mines from this period continue to be uncovered.

===Oil capital===

In 1969, a new boom started as oil was first discovered in the North Sea.

After much discussion, Stavanger was chosen to be the on-shore center for the oil industry on the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, and a period of hectic growth followed.

In March 1965 an agreement was signed between Norway and the United Kingdom on the sharing of the continental shelf by the median line principle. That same year a similar agreement was signed between Norway and Denmark. It was designed as a legal regime for oil exploration. The first licensing round on the Norwegian shelf was announced on 13 April 1965, and in August of that same year the government granted 22 licenses for 78 blocks for oil companies or groups of companies. The production license gave oil companies exclusive rights to exploration, drilling and production in a defined geographical area for a given period at an annual fee. Esso was the first oil company to start drilling for oil off the coast of Norway. The semi-submersible drilling vessel Ocean Traveler was towed from New Orleans to Norway, and the vessel began drilling on 19 July 1966, at block 8/3, about southwest of Stavanger.

===Coat of arms===
Hallvard Trætteberg (1898–1987), a leading specialist in heraldry, was commissioned to design the official coat of arms of Stavanger, a work that lasted from the end of the 1920s until approved on 11 August 1939. His design is also used as the city&#x27;s arms, flag, and seal. The coat of arms is based upon a seal which dated from 1591. It shows a branch of vine (&quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;). Which leaves and branch type that is depicted on the coat of arms has been hotly debated. The original meaning and representation of the vine remains unknown.

===Origin of the name===
The Old Norse form of the name was &quot;Stafangr&quot;. The origin of the name has been discussed for decades, and the most used interpretation is that it originally was the name of the inlet now called Vågen, which was the original site of the city, on the east shore of the bay.

The first element of the name is &quot;stafr&quot; meaning &#x27;staff&#x27; or &#x27;branch&#x27;. This could refer to the form of the inlet, but also to the form of the mountain Valberget (&quot;Staven&quot; meaning &#x27;the staff,&#x27; is a common name of high and steep mountains in Norway). The last element is &quot;angr&quot; meaning &#x27;inlet, bay&#x27;. Facing the North Sea, Stavanger has always been economically dependent on its access to the sea.

==Government==
Stavanger Municipality is responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council. The municipality is under the jurisdiction of the Sør-Rogaland District Court and the Gulating Court of Appeal.

===Municipal council===
The municipal council () of Stavanger is made up of 67 representatives who are elected to four year terms. The tables below show the current and historical composition of the council by political party.

In September 2024, the mayor asked to be relieved of her duties; she is no longer a member of the Conservative Party; as of the first week of October, she has formally claimed that it would not be any significant disadvantage for her, to [continue to] take care of the office [that she holds, if authorities do not relieve her of her duties]; the municipal council is scheduled to vote (October 14) in regard to - if she should be relieved of her duties.










==Geography==

The municipality of Stavanger is located in a coastal landscape, bordering the sea to the west and Boknafjorden in the northeast. The Byfjorden and Gandsfjorden run along the east side of the city. It is part of the Low-Jæren, a flat area of land consisting mostly of marsh, sand, and stone aur, that ranges from Ogna River in the south to Tungenes in the north; it is the northernmost part that includes Stavanger. The majority of the municipality lies between in elevation. The landscape has a distinctive appearance with rocks and hills where there is no settlement or agriculture. The city of Stavanger is closely linked to the sea and water, with five lakes (including Breiavatnet, Stora Stokkavatnet, and Mosvatnet) and three fjords (Hafrsfjorden, Byfjorden, and Gandsfjorden); sea and water form the landscape, providing a shoreline rich with vegetation and wildlife.

The terrain is low-lying: 49% of the area is less than above sea level, While 7% of the land is at . Stavanger&#x27;s highest point is the tall Bandåsen.

The city has developed on both sides of a hollow that runs right through the terrain, with steep slopes up from the bottom. An extension of Boknafjorden and Byfjorden intersects the harbour into the hollow from the northwest, while Hillevåg lake intrudes from Gandsfjorden in the southeast. Breiavatnet is located between the two fjord arms.

The city includes many islands off the coast including: Bjørnøy, Buøy, Engøy, Grasholmen, Hellesøy, Hundvåg, Kalvøy, Lindøy, Sølyst, and Vassøy. It also includes the eastern half of the island of Åmøy.

===Parks===
There are several parks and green spots in Stavanger municipality, both in the city and beyond. Central to the town is the city lake which is in turn surrounded by the city park, built as the city&#x27;s first urban park in 1866–1868. Between the city park and the bay is located Kielland garden, which got its name because the poet Alexander Kielland&#x27;s house at the time was here. Kielland Park went through a major renovation in 2007 as part of the Millennium in Stavanger municipality. At the opposite end of the city lake there is a small park outside the station; here there is Emigration, a gift from the Norwegian emigrants in the United States, commemorating the men and women of Norwegian ancestry who built America.

Bjergstedparken, a park north of Old Stavanger, is the location of Bjergsted Music Center, including Stavanger Concert Hall, and its outdoor areas are often used for festivals and outdoor concerts. The Missing park, built in honour of Lars Missing, is located up the hill on the west side of the harbour, and forms the entrance from the south towards the Old Town. Canon park forms the border between Stavanger and the exit from the E39. Northward go Løkkeveien against Bjergsted westward go Madlaveien the theater and Bergelandstunnelen, east towards E39. The park is located next to old Stavanger Hospital, which also has a large park area around the main building. Through the park runs Kannik creek, which comes to the surface at the statue of the Little Mermaid and runs into Breiavannet. Kannikkbekken runs mostly underground, in pipes, before it reaches Kannik park.

Outside the city center, the park southerly in relation to the large inland lakes such as Mosvatnet, Stora Stokkavatnet and Water Assen. Mosvatnet is making it the third largest in Stavanger after Hålandsvatnet and Store Stokkavatn. The lake supplied the city&#x27;s drinking water from 1863 to 1931, and is now by far the most used recreation area in Stavanger. The path around the lake is long, and much used by cyclist and joggers; sampling conducted in 1995 showed that an estimated 560,000 people used the walking trail around Mosvatnet. At the south end is Mosvangen Camping, Stavanger Svømmestadion old man and Vålandskogen, and to the west is Rogaland Kunstmuseum. Stora Stokkavatnet is – the largest in Stavanger. Right at Stora Stokkavatnet is the Litla Stokkavatnet. The hiking trail around the lakes is long. In the lake is a small island, Storeholmen. Store Stokkavatnet supplied Stavanger&#x27;s drinking water from 1931 to 1959, and was later demoted to the reserve drinking water. In 2009 it was relegated once more, and it is now legal to swim in the water.

===Climate===
Situated on the south west coast of Norway, Stavanger&#x27;s climate is greatly influenced by the temperate water in the North Sea, and Atlantic lows giving mild westerlies also in winter. This creates warmer temperatures throughout the year compared to other cities at similar latitudes, and also gives plentiful precipitation in the form of rain, especially in late autumn and winter. 
According to Köppen climate classification, Stavanger experiences a temperate oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) with five months with a mean temperature above . Spring and early summer is the driest season. The all-time high at the airport was recorded August 1975. The warmest high recorded in Stavanger is at the weather station Stavanger-Våland (72 m) in July 2018. The warmest month on record at Stavanger Airport is August 2002 with mean and average daily high . The all-time low was recorded January 1987. The coldest month on record is February 1963 with mean and average daily low . The average date for the last overnight freeze (low below ) in spring is April 20 and average date for first freeze in autumn is October 31 giving a frost-free season of 193 days (Stavanger Airport Sola 1981–2010 average).


==Boroughs==
Stavanger is officially partitioned into 22 parts and 218 subparts. Stavanger is also divided into seven boroughs.

==Economy==
In the early 20th century, Stavanger&#x27;s industry was mainly related to fisheries and shipping. In the first half of the century it was known for canning, and in the 1950s there were over 50 canneries in town. The town was even called Norway&#x27;s &quot;canned capital&quot;, and included Christian Bjelland, who founded Chr Bjelland &amp; Co. A/S. The last of these factories were closed down in 2002.

Around 1950, over half of the working population in the city was employed in industry. Structural changes in industry and the strong development of the service sector have radically changed the city&#x27;s economic base, and the service industry now represents over 11 percent of employment. However, the city still has 29 percent of the county&#x27;s industrial employment.

Engineering is now the main industry with 59 percent of manufacturing employment. This is mostly related to the offshore petroleum industry, and production of oil platforms alone account for 40 percent. Other important industries are publishing – especially high printing and the major daily newspapers in town, Stavanger and Rogaland Avis Aftenblad – and food and beverage, which includes the processing of local agricultural products from Jæren, including Gilde Vest with one of the largest slaughterhouses.

Employment by place of work and industry in 2007 to 0.6% in primary, 27.4% in secondary and tertiary industries 71.7%. Employment by place of work by sector in 2007 to 24.4% in the public sector and 75.6% in the private sector and public enterprises.

Industry has in recent years become highly decentralized. The most important of the newer industrial areas are Forus in the south, on the border of Sandnes and Sola, and Dusavik (mainly petroleum-related activities) in the north, on the border of Randfontein. Significant older industrial areas are Hillevåg, Buøy, the eastern districts, and in some places elsewhere along the coast. Shipbuilding and shipping has also traditionally been of great importance to the city&#x27;s economic growth, and Rosenberg Shipyard, established in 1896, is located on Hundvåg. Today Stavanger is also among the country&#x27;s most important maritime cities, coming in fourth for registered fleets after the cities of Oslo, Bergen and Ålesund.

For the fourth consecutive year, Stavanger Region was in 2007 ranked best business region. Telemarksforsking Bo worked with Ministry NM to rank the regions in Norway with regard to profitability, growth and new businesses.

===Media===

The city&#x27;s largest daily newspaper, Stavanger Aftenblad came out with its first issue in 1893. Competitor Rogalands Avis was first published in 1899 under the name &quot;1ste Mai&quot; (&#x27;1 May&#x27;), and published daily. In 1987 an attempt was made to establish a new daily newspaper, The West Coast, but it was only released for two months and ended with a total loss of NOK 27 million.

The first newspaper published in Stavanger, &quot;Stavangerske Adressecontoirs Efterretninger&quot;, was a handwritten weekly newspaper that probably came out in 1769 and 1770. This was not an ordinary newspaper, but a so-called link newspaper with the privilege of bringing out announcements, small articles and ads. The first &quot;printed&quot; newspaper in Stavanger, &quot;Stavanger Addresseavis&quot;, published its first issue on Friday, 4 October 1833.

Stavanger Avis was published from 1888 until 1911. Writer and local Alexander L. Kielland was editor in 1889. Stavanger Avis was also the name of the newspaper that came out from 1942 to 1945, when Stavanger Aftenblad and Stavangeren were merged by the Press Directorate.

Student newspaper &quot;SMiS&quot; (Studentmediene i Stavanger) comes out every other month.

Stavanger has one principal television station, TV Vest, that sends local news and reports. Additionally, Viking TV, the channel for the football team Viking FK, started on 2 March 2008, and is distributed via Lyse&#x27;s broadband network, reaching 120,000 viewers in 45,000 households. NRK Rogaland supplies local news broadcasts on radio and television. Local radio stations also provide local news and reports.

===Agriculture and food===

The Stavanger region is often referred to as Norway&#x27;s answer to the French food region of Lyon. The Culinary Institute, based in Ullandhaug, used to provide a very important focus on food in Stavanger. After the Culinary Institute went bankrupt, partly due to activities in Oslo on 4 June 2008, a new culinary organization was established by the Foundation Rogaland knowledge park and Rogaland County Council. This new institute, now also known as The Culinary Institute, maintained parts of the work of the original organization, and eventually bought back the name, logo and brand &quot;Culinary Institute&quot; from the bankruptcy estate.

In summer 2007, the region&#x27;s culinary actors were awarded the title &quot;Norwegian Centers of Expertise in Culinology&quot;. The building under construction at Ullandhaug will serve as a platform and innovative arena, not only for the region&#x27;s R &amp; D environment, but also for other expertise among both industry and the public. In July 2008, the Stavanger European championship qualified for the Bocuse d&#x27;Or. In 2008, Norway was represented by Geir Skeie, who also won gold. Every year there is a &quot;Happy Food Festival&quot; in the city center. The festival originated in the network of Rogaland county so that they could impart culinary traditions of the region. By 2020, Stavanger region intends to be the region most Norwegians associate with food products and culinary experiences.

===Oil industry===

In recent times, the city has come to be called the &quot;oil capital,&quot; and Norway&#x27;s national and largest oil company, Equinor, is based at Forus, in Stavanger. Equinor (at the time known as Statoil) was founded as a limited company owned by the Government of Norway on 14 July 1972 by a unanimous act passed by the Norwegian parliament Stortinget, to enable Norwegian participation in the oil industry on the continental shelf, to build up Norwegian competency within the petroleum industry, and to establish the foundations of a domestic petroleum industry. Establishing Equinor&#x27;s headquarters in Stavanger naturally led to Stavanger becoming the center of the oil industry. Petoro, a Norwegian state-owned company responsible for managing the commercial aspects of the state&#x27;s direct financial interest in petroleum activities on the Norwegian continental shelf, also has its headquarters in the city. With the center of the national oil industry in Stavanger, several other international oil companies have also made their headquarters in Stavanger.
NPD was created in 1972 by Ullandhaug and PSA was established on 1 January 2004 and co-located with the agency, as a regulatory body.

Jåttåvågen, on Gandsfjorden, was from the 1970s to the 1990s a large industrial area, particularly for the construction of large concrete Condeep platforms and oil platforms for the offshore industry. Among others, the Condeep jacket for the three Gullfaks platforms and Troll A were cast here by Norwegian Contractors.

Offshore Northern Seas is the second largest exhibition of its kind in the oil and gas industry. ONS takes place in Stavanger during the last week of August every other year. In 2008, there were 38,000 visitors, half of whom came from abroad.

==Transport==
===Airport===

Stavanger Airport, Sola, is located in Sola, 14 minutes away from Stavanger city center. The airport opened in 1937. In 1940 Stavanger Airport, Forus, opened, but closed in 1989. In 2013 Sola airport had over 4 million passengers and was the largest airport in Rogaland county. It is also the 3rd largest airport in Norway and 7th in the Nordic countries. The busiest route is Oslo-Gardermoen, with over 1.5 million passengers; the second most popular is Bergen Airport, Flesland, with over 700,000 passengers; Oslo-Torp is the third most popular, followed by Trondheim Airport, Værnes and Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik domestically. Internationally, the busiest routes are Copenhagen, Amsterdam, and Aberdeen. Stavanger also has connections to domestic and European destinations, including London, Paris, Barcelona, Stockholm, Warsaw. Domestic destinations are all the way up from Tromsø down to Kristiansand.

===Railway===

Stavanger Station opened in 1878 and is the terminus of both the Sørlandet Line and the Jæren Line.

The Southern Railway goes from Oslo Central Station to Drammen, to Kristiansand Station, to, finally, Stavanger Station. This route, between Oslo and Stavanger, is scheduled over four times every day and takes around seven hours. The railway was constructed in several phases, the first section being opened in 1871 and the last not opened until 1944. While there was continual construction work from Oslo westward as far as Moi, the Jæren Line, from Egersund to Stavanger in Western Norway, was opened in 1878. Up to 1913 the name used on plans and for the completed sections was the Vestlandet Line (The West Country Line).

There are also local trains in Jæren with 19 stops on one line. The line opened as a 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in) narrow gauge stand-alone line on 27 February 1878. The railway was extended from Egersund to Flekkefjord as the Flekkefjord Line in 1904. The Jæren Line&#x27;s only branch, the Ålgård Line from Ganddal to Ålgård, opened in 1924. In 1944, the Sørlandet Line was extended to Sira on the Flekkefjord Line, and the Jæren Line was integrated into the main railway network. Because of this, the line was converted to standard gauge.

===Roads===

European route E39 goes through Stavanger via the Mastrafjord Tunnel and Byfjord Tunnel, then goes south to Sandnes. Fylkesvei 44 starts in Stavanger and ends in Kristiansand, via Sandnes and Flekkefjord.

An undersea road tunnel connects Stavanger to Strand via the Ryfast tunnel link. (Ryfylke Tunnel and Hundvåg Tunnel).

There is as of 2021 ongoing construction of Rogfast, an undersea road tunnel that will facilitate travel between Stavanger and Haugesund.

===Sea===

Located outside Stavanger, there is a port serving ferries to Hirtshals, Denmark. There have been advocates for the Smyril Line ferry between the Faroe Islands and Denmark to make a stop in Stavanger as the new port in Risavika allows this to be done while only adding one hour to the total sailing time.

Local ferries go to Tau and Kvitsøy, while fast passenger boats go to many villages and islands between the main routes from Stavanger to Haugesund and Sauda.

There are plans to re-establish the ferry link to Newcastle in the United Kingdom, which was suspended in 2008.

===Bus===
The local bus service in Stavanger is administered by Rogaland Kollektivtrafikk (RKT) under the brand name &quot;Kolumbus&quot;. The buses are operated by Boreal Transport. RKT administers all bus routes in Rogaland County.

Express bus services are operated by NOR-WAY Bussekspress from Stavanger City Terminal to Kristiansand, Bergen and Haugesund, and by Lavprisekspressen to Oslo via Kristiansand.

The city has a number of bus services and taxis.

===Film===
====Local filmmaking====
South West Film Forum was established in 1992 and is an organization of film workers in Rogaland. Its goal is to increase the skills of film workers in the region and encourage more filmmaking. Film Forum Southwest has received operating support from the City of Stavanger since 1995 and from the county since 1997. Additionally, they have received grants for film workshop from the county and for other industry-stimulating measures from Stavanger municipality.

Stavanger has since 1997 had a grant for the support of local filmmaking. The aim has been to stimulate the local film community growth and development, and to contribute to local filmmakers so they can initiate film projects that can then apply for production funding from other government agencies. In addition, they support the already completed projects – primarily to help cinemas display locally produced film.

The feature film &quot;Mongoland&quot; became a Norwegian film success, made outside the traditional infrastructure for Norwegian film. So far this has culminated with the establishment of the production company South West Film and Film Kraft Rogaland, to ensure long-term fund allocations to filmproduksjoner. Arild Østin Ommundsen made his directorial debut with the feature film &quot;Mongoland&quot; in 2000 and has since directed and written the script for &quot;The Haunting&quot; (2003) and &quot;Monster Thursday&quot; (2005). Ommundsen helped start the new Stavanger wave that came after &quot;Mongoland&quot; premiered, and several of the actors who were instrumental have since enjoyed great success.

Stavanger native Stian Kristiansen, who had his acting breakthrough in the feature film &quot;Mongoland&quot;, debuted as a feature film director with the film interpretation of Tore Renberg&#x27;s book &quot;The Man Who Loved Yngve&quot;. The film, of the same title, had its theatrical release on 15 February 2008. The film has received top marks in Norwegian media, and was watched by over 30,000 people during the premiere weekend. In 2008, Kristiansen received Stavanger&#x27;s screenplay scholarship.

On 30 September 2010, the film &quot;Nokas&quot;, directed by Erik Skjoldbjærg, premiered in Stavanger. The film is about the NOKAS robbery in Stavanger on 5 April 2004, and was filmed on location, using many of the locations where the factual event took place, such as the King Street counting center, in the Norway Bank building, and the Cathedral Square, by Maria Church Ruins. The family of the police officer who died during the robbery has not authorized the film.

===TV===
&quot;Lykkeland&quot; &quot;(&quot;State of Happiness&quot;)&quot;, a Norwegian drama series of so far 24 episodes in three seasons, premiered with the first season on NRK1 in 2018. The series is about the time when Norway enters the oil age and follows some families and people in Stavanger who experience great upheavals when the city goes from being a pietistic community with fishing, shipping and agriculture as main industries, to becoming an international, rich oil city. The second season premiered on 2 January 2022 and deals with dramatic events in the 1970s and 1980s.

The series won two awards during the newly started CannesSeries Festival in Cannes in 2018. The first season of the series won five awards during the Gullruten (&quot;Golden Screen&quot;, Norway) 2019 – best drama series, best actress for Anne Regine Ellingsæter, best director TV drama for Petter Næss and Pål Jackman, best screenplay in TV drama for Mette Marit Bølstad and best costume for Karen Fabritius Gram. During the Gullruten 2022, the second season of the series won five awards, among them best supporting role for Pia Tjelta and best director TV drama for Petter Næss.

===European Capital of Culture 2008===

Stavanger and its region, along with Liverpool, United Kingdom, was selected as a European Capital of Culture for 2008. The &quot;Stavanger2008&quot; vision is expressed through the concept &quot;Open Port&quot;. This can be understood both in its English sense – &quot;an open harbour&quot; – and in its Norwegian meaning of &quot;an open gate&quot;, together implying openness towards the world. The region and its people is supposed to be even more open and inclusive towards art, ideas and opportunities.

Stavanger was the host port of the Cutty Sark Tall Ships&#x27; Race in 1997 and 2004.

===Sport and recreation===

==Tourism==

Stavanger is a popular tourist destination, especially in summer. The hotels in the city enjoy high levels of occupancy all year round, due to the large number of commuters travelling to Stavanger, both for work and in order to attend meetings. In recent years, Stavanger has also become one of the most popular ports of call for cruise ships, with the number of cruise ships increasing steadily, making Stavanger one of Europe&#x27;s fastest growing ports of call for cruise ships north of the Mediterranean.

Especially in the summertime, Stavanger&#x27;s harbour is full of large cruiseships: in 2011 Stavanger hosted 130 cruiseships. The Port of Stavanger is a popular stop on the route to the Norwegian Fjords. The charming city center is just a small walk from the quay.

===Outdoor activities===
There are not many outdoor activities in Stavanger itself, however, splendid opportunities are nearby in adjacent municipalities: Lysefjorden is particularly popular for hiking. Tourists typically visit places like Preikestolen (aka the Pulpit Rock), and Kjeragbolten. Preikestolen is a massive rock overhanging the fjord (604 metres below). Kjeragbolten is a rock wedged in the cliff approximately 1,000 metres above the fjord. The straight fall 1,000 metres down to the fjord makes Kjerag a very popular location for BASE jumping.

Not too far from Stavanger, alpine centers are available for skiers and snowboarders throughout the winter season.
Along the coast south of Stavanger there are a number of large, sandy beaches, including at Sola, within close reach from the city.

===City center===
Old Stavanger (Gamle Stavanger) is located right next to the city center and has a collection of 18th- and 19th-century wooden structures.

Stavanger domkirke (St. Swithun&#x27;s cathedral) was built between 1100 and 1150 by the English bishop Reinald in Anglo-Norman style, and in the late 13th century a new choir was added in Gothic style, with a vaulted roof. The cathedral is the only Norwegian cathedral that is almost unchanged since the 14th century.

The city center itself is small and intimate, with narrow streets and open spaces protected from car traffic.

<doc id="172539" wikidata="Q681107" url="?curid=172539" title="Modchip">
<text>A modchip (short for modification chip) is a small electronic device used to alter or disable artificial restrictions of computers or entertainment devices. Modchips are mainly used in video game consoles, but also in some DVD or Blu-ray players. They introduce various modifications to its host system&#x27;s function, including the circumvention of region coding, digital rights management, and copy protection checks for the purpose of using media intended for other markets, copied media, or unlicensed third-party (homebrew) software.

== Function and construction ==
Modchips operate by replacing or overriding a system&#x27;s protection hardware or software. They achieve this by either exploiting existing interfaces in an unintended or undocumented manner, or by actively manipulating the system&#x27;s internal communication, sometimes to the point of re-routing it to substitute parts provided by the modchip.

Most modchips consist of one or more integrated circuits (microcontrollers, FPGAs, or CPLDs), often complemented with discrete parts, usually packaged on a small PCB to fit within the console system it is designed for. Although there are modchips that can be reprogrammed for different purposes, most modchips are designed to work within only one console system or even only one specific hardware version.

Modchips typically require some degree of technical skill to install since they must be connected to a console&#x27;s circuitry, most commonly by soldering wires to select traces or chip legs on a system&#x27;s circuit board. Some modchips allow for installation by directly soldering the modchip&#x27;s contacts to the console&#x27;s circuit (&quot;quicksolder&quot;), by the precise positioning of electrical contacts (&quot;solderless&quot;), or, in rare cases, by plugging them into a system&#x27;s internal or external connector.

Memory cards or cartridges that offer functions similar to modchips work on a completely different concept, namely by exploiting flaws in the system&#x27;s handling of media. Such devices are not referred to as modchips, even if they are frequently traded under this umbrella term.

The diversity of hardware modchips operate on and varying methods they use mean that while modchips are often used for the same goal, they may work in vastly different ways, even if they are intended for use on the same console. Some of the first modchips for the Wii, known as drive chips, modify the behaviour and communication of the optical drive to bypass security. On the Xbox 360, a common modchip took advantage of the fact short periods of instability in the CPU could be used to fairly reliably lead it to incorrectly compare security signatures. The precision required in this attack meant that the modchip had to make use of a CPLD. Other modchips, such as the XenoGC and clones for the GameCube, invoke a debug mode where security measures are reduced or absent (in which case, a stock Atmel AVR microcontroller was used). A more recent innovation are optical disk drive emulators or ODDE, which replace the optical disk drive and allow data to come from another source bypassing the need to circumvent any security. These often make use of FPGAs to enable them to accurately emulate timing and performance characteristics of the optical drives.

== History ==

Most cartridge-based console systems did not have modchips produced for them. They usually implemented copy protection and regional lockout with game cartridges, both on hardware and software level. Converters or passthrough devices have been used to circumvent the restrictions, while flash memory devices (game backup devices) were widely adopted in later years to copy game media. Early in the transition from solid-state to optical media, CD-based console systems did not have regional market segmentation or copy protection measures due to the rarity and high cost of user-writable media at the time.

Modchips started to surface with the PlayStation system, due to the increasing availability and affordability of CD writers and the increasing sophistication of DRM protocols. At the time, a modchip&#x27;s sole purpose was to allow the use of imported and copied game media.

Today, modchips are available for practically every current console system, often in a great number of variations. In addition to circumventing regional lockout and copy protection mechanisms, modern modchips may introduce more sophisticated modifications to the system, such as allowing the use of user-created software (homebrew), expanding the hardware capabilities of its host system, or even installing an alternative operating system to completely re-purpose the host system (e.g. for use as a home theater PC).

== Anti-modchip measures ==

Most modchips open the system to copied media, therefore the availability of a modchip for a console system is undesirable for console manufacturers. They react by removing the intrusion points exploited by a modchip from subsequent hardware or software versions, changing the PCB layout the modchips are customized for, or by having the firmware or software detect an installed modchip and refuse operation as a consequence. Since modchips often hook into fundamental functions of the host system that cannot be removed or adjusted, these measures may not completely prevent a modchip from functioning but only prompt an adjustment of its installation process or programming, e.g. to include measures to make it undetectable (&quot;stealth&quot;) to its host system.

With the advent of online services to be used by video game consoles, some manufacturers have executed their possibilities within the service&#x27;s license agreement to ban consoles equipped with modchips from using those services.

In an effort to dissuade modchip creation, some console manufacturers included the option to run homebrew software or even an alternative operating system on their consoles, such as Linux for PlayStation 2. However, some of these features have been withdrawn at a later date. An argument can be made that a console system remains largely untouched by modchips as long as their manufacturers provide an official way of running unlicensed third-party software.

== Legality ==
One of the most prominent functions of many modchips—the circumvention of copy protection mechanisms—is outlawed by many countries&#x27; copyright laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the United States, the European Copyright Directive and its various implementations by the EU member countries, and the Australian Copyright Act. Other laws may apply to the many diversified functions of a modchip, e.g. Australian law specifically allowing the circumvention of region coding.

The ambiguity of applicable law, its nonuniform interpretation by the courts, and constant profound changes and amendments to copyright law do not allow for a definitive statement on the legality of modchips. A modchip&#x27;s legality under a country&#x27;s legislature may only be individually asserted in court.

Most of the very few cases that have been brought before a court ended with the conviction of the modchip merchant or the manufacturer under the respective country&#x27;s anti-circumvention laws. A small number of cases in the United Kingdom and Australia were dismissed under the argument that a system&#x27;s copy protection mechanism would not be able to prevent the actual infringement of copyright—the actual process of copying game media—and therefore cannot be considered an effective technical protection measure protected by anti-circumvention laws. In 2006, Australian copyright law has been amended to effectively close this legal loophole.

In a 2017 lawsuit against a retailer, a Canadian court ruled in favor of Nintendo under anti-circumvention provisions in Canadian copyright law, which prohibit any breaching of technical protection measures. The court ruled that even though the retailer claimed the products could be used for homebrew, thus asserting exemptions for maintaining interoperability, the court ruled that because Nintendo offers development kits for its platforms, interoperability could be achieved without breaching TPMs, and thus the defence is invalid.

In Japan, modchips were outlawed as part of new legislation in 2018 which made savegame editing and console modding illegal.

== Alternatives ==
An alternative of installing a modchip is a process of softmodding a device. A softmodded device does not need to permanently have any additional hardware pieces inside. Instead, the software of a device or its internal part is modified in order to change the device&#x27;s behaviour.

<doc id="172540" wikidata="Q7366666" url="?curid=172540" title="Roots revival">
<text>A roots revival (folk revival) is a trend which includes young performers popularizing the traditional musical styles of their ancestors. Often, roots revivals include an addition of newly composed songs with socially and politically aware lyrics, as well as a general modernization of the folk sound.

The term &quot;roots revival&quot; is vague, and may not always refer to identical events. Characteristics associated with a roots revival include:

* Popularization of previously non-mainstream and independent of folk music
* Adaptation of folk styles to pop (or rock) structures
* Invention of new formats like bands where only solo acts had existed before
* Introduction of new instruments
* Composition of works by those who perform them, as opposed to folk tunes mostly passed down orally (see singer-songwriter)
* Incorporation of politically aware lyrics, often critical of a government, religion, or other authority, or society in general
* Lyrics are the first from the nation to express more than simple desires and problems, and are often seen as the embodiment of a national character or literary tradition (in comparison to the legendary American songwriter, such composers are often said to be the &quot;Bob Dylan&quot; of a particular variety, as in &quot;Wannes Van de Velde is the Belgian Bob Dylan&quot;)
* Roots revival performers will often come from very different social and economic backgrounds compared to the people whose style of music they are popularizing.

With such a vague and variable definition, &quot;roots revival&quot; could be seen as referring to the creation of any kind of pop music industry, though there are countries with well-developed pop traditions that have not had a period referred to as a roots revival (such as Jamaica, India, Cuba, and Kenya). For example, homogenized pop has long had its fans in most every country in the world, but many of these nations have created their own indigenous pop styles out of folk music; this process could be called a &quot;roots revival&quot;, though in some cases the folk musics in question were still widespread and did not need to be revived.

==History==
The British folk revival was an academic movement to transcribe and record traditional British songs during the late 19th and early 20th century. Pioneers of this movement were the Harvard professor Francis James Child (1825–96), compiler of &quot;The English and Scottish Popular Ballads&quot; (1882–92), Sabine Baring-Gould (1834–1924), Frank Kidson (1855–1926), Lucy Broadwood (1858–1939), and Anne Gilchrist (1863–1954). The Folk Song Society was founded in 1898 to promote this new endeavour. A major figure in this movement was Cecil Sharp who was the most influential on the repertoire of subsequent performers and defining the nature of folk song. His lectures and other publications attempted to define a musical tradition that was rural in origin, oral in transmission and communal in nature.

The American folk music revival, which focused on culture and entertainment, began in the 1930s and 1940s. During the Great Depression, folk music styles were disseminated around the country, as Delta blues, Latino and Cajun musicians, and itinerant honky tonk singers spread to cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City. The growth of the music industry in the same period was also important; higher potential profits from music placed pressure on artists, songwriters, and label executives to replicate previous hit songs. This meant that musical fads, such as Hawaiian slack-key guitar, never died out completely, since a broad range of rhythms, instruments, and vocal stylings were incorporated into disparate popular genres.

The movement became global in the 1960s and 1970s. In most cases, the folk songs being revived were not quite extinct, though some had not been played for years or were moribund; such cases include the Celtic songs of Cornwall and the Isle of Man, for example. In other cases, such as Cameroon and the Dominican Republic, no revival was necessary as the music remained common, and was merely popularized and adapted for mainstream audiences at home and abroad.

== Roots revivals ==
Algerian music: Beginning as early as 1964, gaining steam in the 1970s and continuing through the 1980s, a mainstream raï revival occurred, and pop-raï stars like Khaled and Chaba Fadela gained worldwide audiences; the same period saw similar trends occur among Kabyle musicians such as Idir, Ferhat and Lounis Ait Menguellet, who popularized the native sounds of their people

Belgian music: Starting early in the 1960s, a wave of popular folk-based performers emerged, led by Wannes Van de Velde, who drew primarily on Flemish traditions. By the 1980s, popular bands included Brabants Volksorkest and the folk rock band Kadril.

Beninese music: Artists like Tohon Stan have created a popular version of Benin&#x27;s numerous styles of indigenous folk music, such as tchink-system, a derivative of the funeral genre of tchinkoumé

Cambodian music: The early 1960s saw a revival of classical music and dance, inspired by Princess Norodom Buppha Devi and led by Sinn Sisamouth, though the rise of the Khmer Rouge largely ended this trend.

Cameroonian music: Beginning with bikutsi in the 1950s and continuing with makossa into the end of the 20th century, Cameroon&#x27;s popularized folk musics have become among the most prominent in Africa. Messi Me Nkonda Martin undoubtedly did the most to evolve bikutsi from its folk origins into a popular style using electric guitars and other importations, while Manu Dibango brought makossa to new audiences around the world.

Chinese music: Partially as a reaction against attempts by the Communist government to use traditional styles to drum up patriotism and loyalty, the 1970s saw the creation of Chinese rock and Cantopop (in Hong Kong), both of which made some use of native folk styles, especially in vocal techniques. The leader of Chinese rock is undoubtedly Cui Jian.

Ivorian music: Ernesto Djédjé&#x27;s ziglibithy style incorporates a number of folk genres from across Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, a diverse country with hundred of ethnic groups; Djédjé&#x27;s most immediate influence was the folk rhythms of the Bété.

Croatian music: By the 1980s, Croatian pop-folk had seen some mainstream success, and a wave of bands appeared, inspired by Vještice, who combined Međimurje folk music with rock in an innovative fusion of sounds.

Czech music: In 1966, the Porta Festival was held, and a wave of singer-songwriters inspired by the likes of American Pete Seeger arose.

Danish music: In contrast to its neighbors, Denmark did not see a Roots revival until the late 1990s, when performers like Morten Alfred Høirup gained a widespread following in the country.

Dutch music: The late 1960s saw a revival of Dutch folk music, led by performers like Gerard van Maasakkers; popularity was limited, and soon ended, though region of Friesland has maintained a strong traditional music scene.

Egyptian music: The city of Cairo is the most important center for Egyptian music, which includes a variety of popularized folk styles, including northern sawahii and southern saiyidi.

Finnish music: Finland&#x27;s folk styles include a variety of national genres and ballads, while the traditional rhyming sleigh songs rekilaulu have become an integral part of many pop singers. In 1967, the Savonlinna Opera Festival, the first of several similar festivals, contributed to a revival of Finnish opera and other more traditional styles.

French music: Though many of France&#x27;s regional styles have seen popularization, the most vibrant scene is undoubtedly the traditional music of Brittany. The region boasts a uniquely Celtic heritage, which has been emphasized by the revival since its beginnings in the early 1970s, led by Alan Stivell. Corsican music has also seen a revival, though with little popular success, concurrent with the rise of Corsican nationalism in the 1970s. In the same way Occitan music, has also seen a revival with Occitan nationalism and reviviscence of occitan speaking in 60&#x27;s (politic crisis with Gaullists to a clash with French linguistic imperialism and conservative politics) &quot;See also the Québécois under Canadian music.&quot;

Galician music: Similar to other Celtic nations, traditional Galician gaita (bagpipe) can now be heard all over the country. It had a revival at the beginning of the XX century and then again a stronger revival by the end of the dictatorship in Spain in the 1970s. Carlos Nuñez and Luar na Lubre are two of the big names. Nuñez was discovered by The Chieftains and has become of the best selling Galician folk musicians. Galician artists also participate in the Festival Interceltique de Lorient in Bretagne.

Gambian music: By the 1970s, Gambian musicians were mostly playing popular merengue or other styles. A visit by pop band The Super Eagles to London to record saw a change, as they were encouraged to continue their practice of Gambian folk. The band became known as Ifang Bondi, and their music was called Afro-Manding blues.

Garifuna music: Starting in the 1970s and continuing into the following decades, the Garifunas, an Afro-Caribbean people found throughout Central America, began turning to their native punta sound and creating popular styles like punta rock, which found an audience across the area. Pen Cayetano was the most important figure in this scene.

German music: Following the 1968 student revolution in West Germany, singer-songwriters playing a kind of expressive, melancholy music with traditional influences became popular. Due to governmental interference, East Germany did not see much of this influence until the mid-1970s.

Ghanaian music: Ghana is best known for the highlife style of music, which has been popular throughout the 20th century. By the late 1960s, however, the pop scene was dominated by generic guitar bands that imitated Western acts. The 1971 Soul to Soul festival, however, featured a number of African American musicians (like Wilson Pickett and Tina Turner), which had the effect of legitimizing African culture, thus causing a major roots revival that brought highlife to international audiences.

Greek music: The late 1960s and early 1970s coup repressed rembétika, a style which had developed earlier in the century. This oppression ironically created a major boom in popularity for the genre, which became associated with political resistance and rebellion. Singer-songwriters like Dionysis Savvopoulos also became wildly popular, and were seen as voices of the Greek nation.

Music of Israel: Early Zionist settlers in Palestine, as far back as the 1880s, sought to create a new mode of Jewish folk music that was based on Biblical musical modes that had long since been abandoned. These composers, who included Matityahu Shelem, Yedidia Admon, and many others, drew on Yemenite, Arabic and other antique sources to create a unique style that they considered a revival of ancient Jewish music. The songs that they and their followers composed constitute a canonical body of folk music called &quot;Songs of the Land of Israel.&quot; These songs are still widely performed today by popular artists.

Another example of roots revival in Israel is the preservation of regional Jewish musical styles. The music of North African and Middle Eastern Jewish communities has morphed into an eclectic new style called &quot;Muzika Mizrahit&quot;. Folksongs in Yiddish and Ladino have been revived and recorded by artists like Chava Alberstein and Yehoram Gaon. Yair Dalal incorporates stylistic elements of the music of his native Iraq in his synthetic musical style.

Italian music: The diverse regions of Italy are home to dozens of varieties of folk music. By the 1950s, their popularity was declining rapidly and a group of musicians and musicologists founded organizations like Istituto de Martino and Nuovo Canzoniere Italiano to help preserve folk cultures. The following decade saw a revival of a number of traditions, including Ciccio Busacca&#x27;s fusions of Sicilian folk styles, central Italy&#x27;s jazzy modern folk, pioneered by Canzoniere del Lazio, the re-appearance of the lira through the work of Re Niliu, the popularization of diverse genres of northern Italian music and some of the work of world-famous tenor Enrico Caruso, who revitalized Naples&#x27; canzone napoletana tradition. In contrast to many other countries&#x27;, Italy&#x27;s roots revival has resulted in very little mainstream success.

Japanese music: Though elements of traditional Japanese music can be found in some rock and pop from the country, the only major roots revival was Okinawan, and began in the late 1980s. Popularized Okinawan folk music includes genres like kawachi ondo and goshu ondo.

Korean music: In the early 1970s, a genre called t&#x27;ong guitar developed, performed by singer-songwriters inspired by the likes of American Bob Dylan and Joan Baez. Korean folk has seen little popular success, though there has been some for the pansori, nongak and sanjo styles.

Latvian music: Its traditional long suppressed or appropriated by the Soviet Union, Latvia&#x27;s kokles (an instrument similar to a box zither) was revived and popularised in the 1970s, led by traditional suiti kokle player Jānis Poriķis and ethnomusicologist Valdis Muktupāvels.

Lithuanian music: The Soviet Union had sponsored some music festivals, such as the dainų šventės, but did not allow for much lyrical or musical innovation, and kept all songwriters from experimenting with politically aware and dissident lyrics. An active cultural rebellion occurred in the 1960s, based around a series of national music festivals and concerts.

Malian music: Cuban music had become extremely popular in Mali by the 1960s, and little folk music could compete. The country&#x27;s second president, however, Moussa Traoré, encouraged the growth of a Malian music industry, resulting in a revival of some kinds of folk music, and a popularization led by Salif Keita. Later Fanto Sacko&#x27;s bajourou music and wassoulou music also became popularized. However, by the 1980s, Malian pop had lost most traces of its folk origins and was simply dance music, even topping the European charts; another roots revival occurred, led by Guinean acoustic singer and kora player Jali Musa Jawara.

Mozambiquan music: Music was used in the 1960s by the independence movement in Mozambique. Leaders in this movement encouraged the growth of a national music industry. By the 1970s, native forms of music, such as marrabenta, had been popularized.

Russian music: Starting in about 1966, a group of bards arose, most prominently including Vladimir Vysotsky, and Vyacheslav Shchurov organized a number of concerts for folk singers. This led to a revival and revitalization of Russian folk songs, a trend which continued in ensuing decades.

Sami music: The Sami, an indigenous people found in central and northern Scandinavia, northern Finland and northwestern Russia, have a tradition of folk songs called joiks, which have been popularized by the likes of Mari Boine, who remains a legend in the field.

Slovenian music: in the 1950s, the so-called &quot;folk popular music&quot; emerged with groups like Avsenik and Lojze Slak band, based on modernized Slovenian-style polka. In the 1980s, a completely different trend emerged, based on more archaic folk music, usually from specific regions; and it was popularized by groups like Istranova (Slovenian Istria) and singer Vlado Kreslin (Prekmurje).

===Latin America, Portugal and Spain===
Argentine music: In the 1960s, Andean nationalism was spreading across Argentina, Chile, Bolivia and Peru. Argentina&#x27;s nativist scene includes landmark performers like Mercedes Sosa and Atahualpa Yupanqui, who helped spawn the nueva canción scene.

Bolivian music: The 1950s saw an increase in nationalist identity surrounding the Quechua and Aymara peoples, and a number of intellectuals began associating themselves with folk music, clothing, cuisine and other elements. By the mid-1960s, a folk revival was blossoming, led by Edgar Jofré.

Brazilian music: Beginning in the 1950s and continuing for several decades, a multitude of Brazilian styles (most importantly samba) and imported American jazz combined to create the wildly popular bossa nova scene. This soon evolved into the politically charged Tropicalia genre, which starred controversial and acclaimed singer-songwriters Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil.

Chilean music: In the early to mid-1960s, the burgeoning nueva canción movement spread throughout Chile, Argentina, Bolivia and Peru, featuring a wave of singer-songwriters who incorporated folk elements and nationalist lyrics, often critical of governmental authorities, and achieved great acclaim. Violeta Parra is sometimes viewed as the founder of the scene, for she popularized Quechua and Aymara songs and provided an outlet for performances by future luminaries like Victor Jara.

Cuban music: By the 1960s, Cuban music had seen international success in the form of pop-mambo, chachacha and other genres, and many artists were disillusioned with these styles, which were seen as watered-down. A vanguard of singer-songwriters like Silvio Rodríguez and Pablo Milanés arose, composing politically aware songs in a style that came to be called Nueva Trova.

Dominican music: Merengue had been popular in the Dominican Republic for decades since evolving out of confusing folk origins, but did not truly become a form of pop music until the early 1960s, when legends like Johnny Ventura brought the music to new audiences at home and abroad.

Spanish music was incorporated into Spanish Baroque music in the harpsichord works of Soler. Later composers such as Albeniz, Falla, Rodrigo and Giuliani used the dance rhythms of Spain. The classical guitarists Andrés Segovia, John Williams and Julian Bream popularised the music through their recordings. Current popular folk musicians include Susana Seivane, Hevia and Milladoiro. A roots revival Nueva canción, which also evolved into new form of socially committed music occurred in several Spanish-speaking countries.

Portuguese music: In the 1960s and 1970s, José Afonso led a return to more traditionally styled fado music, which later evolved into a number of new song forms that incorporated socio-political lyrics and foreign influences.

===English-speaking countries===
: &quot;Includes English and Celtic revivals&quot;
: &quot;For additional Celtic music, see the French section above&quot;

Australian music: Beginning in the 1980s, Australian Aborigines began turning to their native styles of folk music, which were updated, creating popular bands and styles like Aboriginal rock.

Canadian music: Though some artists, like The Band, Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, had been integral parts of the 1960s American folk rock scene, Canada has seen its own distinctive revival of styles. This includes the late 1970s scene in Maritime Canada, which glorified the area&#x27;s Celtic heritage and was led by regional legends Figgy Duff and Stan Rogers, as well as the mid-1960s Quebecois revival led by Gilles Vigneault. There were also revivals of Acadian, Inuit and other folk styles. In the 1950s and 1960s dedicated folk music collectors spread out across the country to record traditional music. The songs and tunes were popularized on public radio by performers such as Alan Mills, Stu Davis, Marg Osborne, and the Travellers. A number of musicians who grew up listening to this traditional music became singer-songwriters in the 1970s; for example, Gordon Lightfoot and Ian and Sylvia.

English music: There were two folk music revivals in England. The first, led by Cecil Sharp, was academic. It involved the collection of songs and tunes and their publication in journals. It was at its peak about 1910. The second revival involved large-scale public performances of English music, beginning with the appearance of the Copper Family at the Royal Albert Hall in 1952, together with a proliferation of folk clubs meeting mainly in the upper rooms of public houses. Starting in the late 1960s the songs were performed in a contemporary style; this was the origin of the British folk rock style.

Irish music: There was a revival of Irish folk music that began in the early 20th century, based both in Dublin and Ireland, though the longer-lasting and more famous revival began in 1955 with the album &quot;The Lark in the Morning&quot;, whose recording was supervised by Diane Hamilton and which featured Liam Clancy and Tommy Makem prior to their involvement with the influential but U.S.-based Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. Later famous groups include The Dubliners (founded 1962), The Chieftains (1963), Ceoltóirí Chualann, and Clannad (1973). Later, singer-songwriters such as Christy Moore were inspired by American popular folk singers, and they took to modernizing and adapting Irish music for modern audiences. The result was a dramatic change from folk traditions, including the introduction of the bouzouki and influences including soul and rock.

Scottish music: The Scottish folk revival begin in 1951 when Hamish Henderson created the People&#x27;s Festival. The Boys of the Lough were one of the first instrumental Celtic groups to tour the world.

US music: The American Folklore Society was founded in 1888. Some members, including Frank Clyde Brown, George Lyman Kittredge, and John Lomax began collecting and recording &#x27;trivial&#x27; music of minority groups. During the late 1920s and early 1930s, performers such as A. P. Carter, Bascom Lamar Lunsford, Lesley Riddle, and Woody Guthrie specifically began to seek out traditional songs to incorporate them into their performance repertoire. A traditional music revival started the American folk music revival that began in the 1940s and led to a new genre, contemporary folk music. A group of American archivists and researchers that included John A. Lomax, his son Alan Lomax, poet Carl Sandburg, musician Charles Seeger, and others collected, recorded, and published old ballads, prison songs, Appalachian folk music and black blues. A number of performers influenced by traditional music, such as Pete Seeger, Josh White, Burl Ives, and The Weavers, enjoyed considerable commercial success in the 1940s, leading to a broader commercial revival in the late 1950s through the mid-1960s with performers such as The Kingston Trio, Joan Baez, and Peter, Paul and Mary selling millions of record albums. The folk revival in the US led to the creation of folk rock, a new genre that drew on songs and themes associated with folk music and arranged them with rock ‘n’ roll instruments. Many of the early artists and groups associated with the genre began as folk musicians, most notably Bob Dylan, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Roger McGuinn of the Byrds, and Jerry Garcia of The Grateful Dead. The 21st century saw a smaller revival of Appalachian folk music with the release of the 2000 motion picture soundtrack to &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;. Singers such as Gillian Welch and Alison Krauss and the bluegrass performer Ralph Stanley were featured on the album.

Transnational: During the 2010s, folk-inspired acts began to score chart hits in the UK, US and beyond. Most notably the UK group Mumford &amp; Sons won the Grammy (US National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences award) for best album in 2013.

<doc id="172542" wikidata="Q334040" url="?curid=172542" title="Toyota Celica">
<text>The is an automobile produced by Toyota from 1970 until 2006. The Celica name derives from the Latin word &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;heavenly&quot; or &quot;celestial&quot;. In Japan, the Celica was exclusive to &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot; dealer chain. Produced across seven generations, the Celica was powered by various four-cylinder engines, and body styles included convertibles, liftbacks, and notchback coupé.

In 1973, Toyota coined the term &quot;liftback&quot; to describe the Celica fastback hatchback, and used the name &quot;Liftback GT&quot; for the North American market. Like the Ford Mustang, the Celica concept was to attach a coupe body to the chassis and mechanicals from a high volume sedan, in this case the Toyota Carina.

The first three generations of North American market Celicas were powered by variants of Toyota&#x27;s R series engine. In August 1985, the car&#x27;s drive layout was changed from rear-wheel drive to front-wheel drive, and all-wheel drive turbocharged models were manufactured from October 1986 to June 1999. Variable valve timing came in certain Japanese models starting from December 1997 and became standard in all models from the 2000 model year. In 1986, the six-cylinder Celica Supra variant was spun off as a separate model, becoming simply the Supra. Lightly altered versions of the Celica were also sold through as the Corona Coupé through the Toyopet dealer network from 1985 to 1989, and as the Toyota Curren through the Vista network from 1994 to 1998.


== First generation (A20, A30; 1970) ==
Displayed at the October 1970 Tokyo Motor Show together with the Toyota Carina and marketed from December of the same year, the Celica was a two-door hardtop coupé that emphasized styling and driving enjoyment. Based on a platform shared with the Carina sedan which is one size above the Toyota Corolla, and a shared size with the Toyota Corona, according to Automobile Magazine, the &quot;Celica&quot; was based on the &quot;Corona&quot; platform.

This car was aimed at the North American market and was Toyota&#x27;s response to the 1964½ Ford Mustang (Pony car) which also was based on the standard sedan with stylized 2+2 bodywork.

In Japan where different dealer chains handle different models the Celica was exclusive to &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot; Japanese dealerships. The Celica filled a market position previously held by the 1965–1969 Toyota Sports 800, when &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot; locations were previously known as &quot;Toyota Public Store&quot; then renamed in 1966 as &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot;.

The initial trim levels offered were ET (1.4L 4-speed), LT, ST (1.6L 4-speed, 5-speed manual, or 3-speed automatic) and GT (1.6L 5-speed) with GTV added in 1972. For export markets the Celica was available in three different trim levels; the LT, ST and GT.

At its introduction the Celica was only available as a pillarless hardtop notchback coupé, adopting &quot;coke bottle styling&quot;. The prototype SV-1 &quot;Liftback&quot; was shown as a concept car at the 1971 Tokyo Motor Show and with slight modifications this was introduced in Japan in April 1973 as the 2-liter RA25 (18R engine family) and the 1.6-liter TA27 (2T engine family). Model grades were ST and GT.

The &quot;Liftback&quot; model was then exported to many Asian countries and Europe in RHD form as the RA28 or TA28 with either a 18R 2.0-liter or 1.6-liter 2T-B engine. After the October 1975 facelift it was available in both RHD and LHD forms in other markets. The RV-1 &quot;concept&quot; wagon was also shown at the 1971 Tokyo Motor Show but it did not reach production.

The Japanese domestic market GT models had various differences from the ET, LT and ST including the hood flutes, power windows, air conditioning and specific GT trim but shared a few things with the ST—a full-length center console and oil pressure/ammeter gauges—while the LT had warning lights for these functions. With the exception of the American market, the GT had a 1588 cc 2T-G twincam engine or a 1968 cc 18R-G, which not available on the ET, LT or ST and always had 5-speed manual gearbox. Typically for the Japanese market GTs had 18R-G motors that were mated to a Porsche designed closer ratio P51 5 speed gearbox whereas export models had the W-50. For the American market only the GT had only a single cam engine (2000 cc 18R or 2200 cc 20R) with a choice of automatic or 4 speed manual gearboxes on early models then upgrading to the W-50 5 speed in 1974–1977.

There was also the GTV version which introduced in 1972 with slightly less luxurious interior than the GT to reduce weight. The GTV came with the same 2T-G engine, but with a thicker front sway bar &amp; firmer suspension for better handling. Later in 1973 Japanese GTVs had a roof console &quot;OK&quot; monitor with a map light and a cluster of trouble indicators which detected blown brake bulbs, brake fluid level, main fuse &amp; a floor console engine oil temperature gauge.

The first-generation Celicas can be further broken down into two distinctive models. The first of these was the original with slant nose (trapezoid-like shape front corner light). This is for coupe model only, TA22, RA20, RA21 &amp; RA22. These models were produced from 1970 to 1975 and came equipped with the 2T, 2T-G 1.6 liter, or 18R 2.0 liter motor. They had a wheelbase.

The second series had a flat nose (square front corner light) and slightly longer wheelbase ( wheelbase). This facelift model appeared in Japan in 1974 but for export was the 1975 model year being TA23, RA23, RA24, RA25, RA28, TA28 &amp; RA29. The Japanese version had engines under 2.0 liters so as to conform to Japanese regulations concerning engine displacement size, thereby allowing buyers to avoid an additional tax for a larger engine. Japanese buyers did pay a higher annual road tax for engines over 1.5 liters while staying under the 2.0 liter threshold.

In some markets, the lower-end LT was equipped with the single carbureted four-cylinder 2T engine displacing 1600 cc, while the ST came with a twin Solex downdraft carburetor 2T-B engine. The 2T-G that powered the high-end GT / GTV model was a DOHC 1600 cc engine equipped with twin Mikuni-Solex Carburetors.

The first Celica for North America, 1971 ST was powered by 1.9 liter 8R engine. The 1972–1974 models have 2.0 liter 18R-C engines. For 1975–77, the engine for the North American Celica is the 2.2 liter 20R. The Celica GT and LT models were introduced in the US for the 1974 model year. The top-line GT included a 5-speed W-50 manual transmission, rocker panel GT stripes and styled steel wheels with chrome trim rings. The LT was marketed as an economy model. 1974 saw minor changes in the Celica&#x27;s trim and badges and slightly different wheel arches, the earlier 1971–73 arches commonly referred to as thin lipped and the later 1974–77 as flat lipped. The North American Celica was equipped with federally mandated safety equipment such as an energy-absorbing steering column and seat belts. These were optional in some overseas markets.

The A40 automatic transmission became an option on North American ST and LT models starting in the 1973 model year. For 1975 the 1974 body was used and sturdier chrome and black rubber bumper bars with horizontally mounted shock absorber mounts (Volvo style) replaced the chrome bumpers used in the earlier cars (in accordance with US Federal bumper laws) mandating impacts without minor damage at . Unfortunately the early 8R and 18R series engines proved to be less than durable, with early failures common. The 1974 18R-C engine&#x27;s durability was improved somewhat, but the 20R introduced for 1975 proved to be a better engine in most respects.

=== 1972 update ===
In August 1972 the Celica&#x27;s tail lights were updated from one-piece tail lights (affectionately called one-tail or flat lights) to tail lights with distinctive raised brake &amp; turn signal &quot;bubble&quot; lenses. The rear center panel was also redesigned as the fuel tank was moved from the trunk bottom to behind the rear seats and the fuel filler was moved from a concealed location between the tail lights to the left &quot;C&quot; pillar. Other changes included changes to the front and rear badges, the relocation of the towing hooks, changes to the color of the wing mirrors (on cars equipped with sports type mirrors) and changes to the centre console on ST and GT models.

=== 1974 update ===
In 1974, for the 1975 model year, the North American spec Celica retained the earlier body but received federally mandated 5 mph bumpers front and rear. Body-color urethane panels filled in the spaces previously occupied by the smaller chrome bumpers. This style of bumpers were used in North America until the end of this generation in 1977. Japan also used these bumpers for the Liftback GT, but not lesser grades or the coupe, from 1976 to 1977.

Other changes done during the 1974 model year included the introduction of flared wheel arches, another change in the style of the badges and the introduction of a new style of rear quarter vents. For the Japanese market, the cars also featured a different front end treatment with the introduction of a flat front section (similar to, but not interchangeable with later model Celica,).

=== 1976 update ===
1976 brought the largest update to the model. The wheelbase of the car was increased and the car featured various difference both externally and internally. Externally the most noticeable difference is the flat front end (similar to earlier JDM models), the elimination of the removable hood vents (replaced by vents formed in the hood pressing) and the single cowl vent which replaced the twin vents on earlier models. Internally the cars also feature a different dash, seats and carpets. The liftback version also included these changes.

=== Liftback ===

The fastback-styled hatchback, called the &quot;Liftback&quot; by Toyota, was introduced for the Japanese market in April 1973 but not until July 1974 for export models. Models for the Japanese domestic market Liftback were the 1600 ST, 1600 GT (TA27), 2000 ST, and 2000 GT (RA25 and RA28). The North American liftback (RA29) was only offered with a 2.2-liter 20R engine for the 1976 and 1977 model year. All the liftback models have flat noses. Although there is no &quot;B&quot; pillar in the Liftback, the rear quarter windows are fixed in place and do not roll down (as they do in the hardtop coupe).

The Liftback was often called the &quot;Japanese Mustang&quot; or the &quot;Mustang Celica&quot;. The liftback styling was largely inspired by the 1969 Ford Mustang fastback, including C-pillar louvers and the vertical bar tail lights that are a signature Mustang styling cue and pay overall homages to the muscle-car era.

=== Facelift export models ===
From its 1971 introduction in North America until the 1973 model year, the Celica retained its original styling and trim, and was sold only in ST trim. The tri-color taillights with the &quot;bubble&quot; style arrived for 1973, and continued into early 1974. Mid-1974, the trim was slightly revised. The original &quot;Celica&quot; quarter panel script was changed to a bold block-letter font, the &quot;C&quot; pillar trim was restyled with a more modern look, and GT logos switched to a bold serif font. The GT was the first American Celica to include a 5-speed overdrive transmission as standard, along with an FM/AM radio, leather-wrapped 4-spoke steering wheel, GT rocker panel stripes, styled steel wheels with bright trim rings, and 70-series radial tires. 1974 saw the introduction of the LT to North America. It was similarly equipped as the ST and lasted through the 1975 model year.

For the 1975 model year, U.S. spec Celicas retained the 1974 body but received federally mandated 5-mph bumpers front and rear. Body-color urethane panels filled in the cutouts previously occupied by the smaller chrome bumpers.

In October 1975, the entire Celica lineup was given a facelift with a revised front bumper and grille. The new model codes for facelift hardtop coupe were RA23 for the general worldwide market with an 18R engine or RA24 for America with a 20R engine. The Liftbacks were coded RA28 and TA28 (global markets) or RA29 for the US. Also available was the TA23, which was similar to the RA23 but with the 2T engine and the TA28 offered with the 2T-B. The &quot;Toyota Celica Liftback GT&quot; won Motor Trend Car of the Year (Imported Vehicle) in 1976.

The Celica RA23, TA23, RA28, and TA28 had a more distinctive bulged hood which was lacking in the TA22 or RA20/21 coupé and in the TA27 and RA25 Liftback but was factory in 1975 on the North American RA22 Celica to accommodate the larger 20R motor. The TA22 Celica also had removable vents mounted in the hood which the RA23 and RA28 lacked, while the TA27 and RA25 models had three raised fluted vents inset into the hood. The RA series also had an elongated nose to accommodate the larger engine. The hood vents, fuel filler cap and interior options were also different between the TA and RA series across the model range. The 1976-77 North American Celicas lost their ammeter and oil pressure gauges; they were replaced by warning lamps in the gauge cluster.

Up until 1976, U.S. Celicas got either wheel covers (ST, LT) or styled steel wheels with trim rings (GT) in the 13-inch size. Starting in 1976, all Celicas got 14-inch styled steel wheels, with trim rings (GT) or without them (ST and LT).

For 1976–1977, the non-U.S. GT Liftback was also available with the 18R-G twincam engine with a Yamaha head and running gear. This engine produced significantly more power than the single-cam 18R. Peak power was about at 6000 rpm.

In Australia, the 1971 TA22 Celica was first released with the 1.6-liter 2T motor, as well as the TA23 in the mid-1975 and the RA23 in 1976 with only 2000 1977 RA28s being imported, all with the 2.0-liter 18R-C motor. The only two GTs ever imported by the AMI (Australian Motor Industries) which later became Toyota Australia, were a 1971 red TA22 GT and a brown 1973 RA25 GT. These vehicles were a special import by Ken Hougham the managing director of AMI for evaluation. Just like the TA22 GT, the RA25 GT model was never imported due to the power to weight ratio and higher insurance for the twin-cam motor all of which quickly halted any notion of the GTs becoming a staple in the Celica family in Australia. 

== Second generation (A40, A50; 1977) ==


The second-generation Celica was released for the 1978 model year (production began in August 1977) and was again available in both notchback coupé and Liftback forms. It was designed in Toyota&#x27;s Calty Design Research studio in California. David Stollery was responsible for its design. The coupé was no longer a true hardtop; both coupé and Liftback had frameless door glass but featured a thick &quot;B&quot; pillar. The glass areas were significantly increased over the original version, 26% larger for the coupé and 35% larger for the liftback. The A40 Celica was also the first Japanese production car to feature glass which curved in all three dimensions.

The early or pre-facelift second-generation Celica was released with round headlights and chrome bumpers for lower grades. The higher grades such as the Japanese GT and all U.S. models have black rubber bumpers. The facelift was launched in August 1979 came with square headlights and revised tail lights. They came with chrome bumpers with rubber protectors on each corners, or for certain models with all polyurethane black bumpers such on the Japanese GT and all U.S. spec cars. The facelift model front end was not only featured square headlights, but also came with new grille, and revised hood and fenders which were not interchangeable with the parts of pre-facelift model. This generation offered as standard equipment a new windshield wiper and headlight switch installation, with the controls operated by levers attached to the steering column.

From 1979 until 1981 the Griffith company in the U.S. offered a Targa-style convertible conversion to the coupé. They were called the Sunchaser and had a removable Targa top and a folding rear roof, much like the &#x27;67 Porsche 911 soft-window Targa. These were Toyota approved and sold through Toyota dealers. Over 2,000 were produced. In Germany, the same Sunchaser version but also a full convertible and a traditional targa with a fixed rear window (called the TX22) were offered. Conversions were Toyota-approved and carried out from mid-1980 by a company called Tropic.

=== Markets ===
==== Japan ====
The Japanese model grades were ET, LT, ST, SE, XT, GT, and GTV. The GT and GTV have an 18R-G twincam engine. In August 1978, the GTV was replaced by the GT-Rally, a limited edition model that had a 1.6-liter 2T-GEU or 2.0-liter 18R-GEU engine, special grill, special bumpers, black interior (against the norm of colored interiors of the time) and was only available in white or lime green paint.

There were about 70 different variants of second-generation Celica sold in Japan over the model&#x27;s lifetime. At its pinnacle in 1979, Toyota retailed 49 versions at once.

==== North America ====
Power for North American models was provided by a 2.2 L SOHC 20R 4-cylinder engine for both ST and GT models. This new generation offered more safety, power and fuel economy than previous models and was awarded Motor Trend&#x27;s &quot;Import Car of the Year&quot; for 1978.

In 1980, the limited edition &quot;U.S. Grand Prix GT Liftback&quot; was offered due to Toyota&#x27;s connection to the U.S. Grand Prix West in Long Beach, California. For 1981, the North American models were given a bigger 2.4-liter SOHC 22R 4-cylinder engine producing , which was simultaneously fitted to the Pickup. To celebrate the Celica 10th Anniversary, the GTA coupe was released. This was basically a GT coupe with a four-speed automatic transmission, Supra style interior, power windows, upgraded sound system and alloy wheels. The GTA is distinguishable by its copper brown / beige two-tone paint and a &quot;GTA 10th anniversary&quot; plaque on the center console.

The Canadian models were similar to the U.S. models, but the Liftback was also offered in the more affordable ST trim, instead only the higher GT trim in the U.S.

==== Australia ====
In Australia, the new Celica was less sporty than earlier models. The only engine available was the 2-liter 18R, producing , hooked up to a five-speed manual or a three-speed automatic. The suspension was also quite soft and the recirculating ball steering came in for some criticism for its vagueness. Both the coupé and the liftback bodywork were available in Australia.

==== Europe ====
Across Europe, the Celica was offered with the 1.6-liter, 2.0-liter, and 2.0-liter Twincam engines. Trim levels were 1600 LT, 1600 ST, 1600 GT, 2000 ST, 2000 XT, and 2000 GT.

=== Celica XX/Celica Supra ===

In April 1978 Toyota began production of the Mark I Toyota Supra in Japan, as the Toyota Celica XX. It debuted in the United States as the Toyota Celica Supra for the 1979 model year. The U.S. Mark I (chassis code MA46) was originally equipped with a 2.6 L (2563 cc) 12-valve SOHC straight-six engine (4M-E). Simultaneously the Japanese Celica XX (chassis code MA45) was offered with a version of the 2.6 or with a 2.0 L 12-valve SOHC inline-six engine (M-EU).

=== Celica Camry ===


Toyota launched the Celica Camry, a four-door sedan, in the Japanese market during January 1980. This model is a derivative of the second-generation 1977–1981 Toyota Carina (A40 and A50) with front-end styling resembling that of the contemporary Celica XX. Neither a coupe nor a liftback body was offered. Toyota replaced the Celica Camry with the front-wheel drive Toyota Camry (V10) in 1982.

== Third generation (A60; 1981) ==
August 1981 saw the introduction of the third-generation Celica. The car was initially available in notchback coupe and liftback forms with many buyers preferring the liftback. The U.S.-made convertible came in 1984. Styling was changed considerably from previous models and power was provided by a 2.4 L 22R or 22R-E engine in all North American models, while smaller engines were used in other countries. The 2.4 L became the biggest 4-cylinder engine offered in any Celica ever. Other engines were the 1.6-liter 4A, 1.6-liter 2T, 1.8-liter 3T, 1.8-liter 4T, 1.8-liter 1S, 2.0-liter 2S, 2.0-liter 18R-G and 2.0-liter 21R, depending on the particular market. Trim levels for the Japanese market were SV, ST, ST-EFI, SX, GT, and GT Rally. Rack and pinion steering was offered for this generation Celica.

The Australian, European, Japanese, and general export model Celicas came with rear side vents, while the North American versions received red conspicuity lights on the rear quarter panels.

In 1982, the New York Yankees began using a Celica as their bullpen car.

Fuel injection became standard on all North American Celicas started from August 1982, therefore the 22R engine became 22R-E (or 22R-EC with California emissions equipment). In August 1982, Toyota added the GT-S model to the North American market to re-inject the sports image that Celica had lost as it grew larger and heavier with each subsequent model. The GT-S included larger 14x7-inch wheels and 225/60HR14 tires, fender flares, independent rear suspension, a sports interior including special seats, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter knob. Most of these came from the Supra. From the windshield back, both cars were nearly identical when in Liftback form. There were also optional rear louvers for the coupe and Liftback.

The Celica was facelifted in August 1983 for the 1984 model year. The revision included fully retractable headlights, restyled grille, and airdam. The rear combination lamps were also revised. The Japanese Celica 1600 GT got new 4A-GE engine, and the 1600 GT-R also powered by the same motor was introduced. Another new model was the turbocharged 1800 GT-TR.

The GT-S convertible, built by American Sunroof Company (ASC) in California, was originally released in a limited 200 units in 1984. 4,248 more were built for the 1985 model year.

For the European continent, the Celica was offered as 1600 ST with 2T engine and live rear axle (TA60), 2000 XT with 21R engine (RA61) and 2000 GT with 18R-G engine (RA63). The UK models were 2.0 ST for early version and 2.0 XT for the facelift. All 60-series Celicas intended for the UK market were powered by the 21R engine.

In Australia, Toyota decided initially to use the 21R-C in the Celica. As a result, the car only turned out . However, for the facelift model, it was replaced by the quicker 2S-C motor, now in combination with independent rear suspension rather than the traditional live axle differential. This version, model code SA63, was only sold in 1983 and 1984 and only in Australia. The 2.0 was then replaced by the injected 2.4-liter motor (22R-E, model code RA65) which provided .

=== Twincam Turbo Group B Rally Car ===

In September 1982, the first Celica turbo was launched in Japan for the local market only. The GT-T (TA63) came with the twin-spark 1.8-liter 3T-GTE engine, W55 5-speed manual gearbox, a limited slip differential, pump up lumbar &quot;sports&quot; seats and optional digital dash. To meet the FISA regulation for Group B Rally Car to compete in the World Rally Championship (WRC), 200 units of the Celica GT-TS were built. These were the basic cars for Group B Celica Twincam Turbo (TA64) which were built and rallied by Toyota Team Europe (TTE). The Group B Celica TCT made its WRC debut in the 1983 Rally Finland. The production car had a engine, and with a 4T-GTE engine, the fully works rally car was the most powerful third-generation Celica.

Before the turbo model, the naturally aspirated, twin-cam 16-valve Celica 2000 GT (RA63) was also campaigned; winning the 1982 Rally New Zealand on its first serious outing.

==== WRC victories ====

== Fourth generation (T160; 1985) ==

In August 1985 the Celica was changed completely. It was an all-new vehicle with front wheel drive, a rounded, flowing body and new 2.0 L four-cylinder engines. The Celica was no longer built on the Toyota A platform, and instead realigned with the Toyota T platform underpinning the Toyota Corona. The Toyota A platform was now exclusive to the Toyota Supra. The coupe bodystyle in Japan was used only for the Corona coupe, sold only at Japanese Toyota dealerships &quot;Toyopet Store&quot; without the retractable headlights. An optional feature only offered on the Corona coupe was four-wheel steering, not shared with the Celica during this generation, however, the turbocharged engine on the Celica was not installed in the Corona coupe.

Toyota introduced the &quot;ultimate Celica&quot;, the GT-Four (ST165) onto the Japanese market in October 1986. With full-time all-wheel drive, including an electronically controlled central locking differential, and a turbocharged version of the GT-S 2.0 L engine producing (3S-GTE), it immediately took its place as the flagship of the Celica range and became the official Toyota rally car for all years of production. The GT-Four, with a revised viscous coupling central locking differential, began export in 1987 (1988 U.S. model year) and marketed in North America as the All-trac Turbo. It was rated at and . The All-trac system was also offered for a limited time on the Camry, and Corolla in North America without the turbo, as well as the normally aspirated and supercharged Previa.

The ST165 chassis design was quite acclaimed in its time. Toyota chose not to make any drastic suspension changes for the AWD GT-Four. The front suspension comprises MacPherson struts with an anti-swaybar and strut tower brace, while the rear employs struts with a trailing link and twin lateral links per side plus an anti-swaybar.

The ST165 GT-Four made its World Rally debut in the 1988 Tour de Corse and finished 6th. The first victory came in 1988 Cyprus (non-WRC), and the first WRC victory in 1989 Rally Australia.

As with the previous generation, the convertibles were fitted by ASC. Coupes were shipped from Japan to their facility in Rancho Dominguez, California, where the top was chopped and a power convertible top, reinforcements to the chassis, rear quarter windows, and a one-piece fold-down seat were installed. ASC also handled the process for the Japanese market. Partially built, right-hand-drive Celicas were shipped from Japan to California, ASC performed the conversion, and the completed cars made a second trip across the Pacific back to Japan. The Celica convertible was in high demand in Japan because of the exotic appeal of the American modifications.

=== Japan ===
For the Japanese market the fourth-generation Celica started with the 1.8-litre 1S-iSU engine in the ST160 and 1.6-litre 4A-GE engine in the AT160.
The 4A engine in the 1.6 GT was terminated in August 1987 and the 1S-iLU engine was replaced by the 4S-Fi engine in the ST163 in May 1988. Models with the 3S-GELU sports twincam came in GT and GT-R trim levels. The 3S-GTE turbo engine was also introduced in October 1986 for the all-wheel drive ST165 GT-Four. The factory Convertible (coded ST162C) was offered with the twincam 3S-FE engine. The vehicle with the 2.0 liter engine was regarded as the top trim level package due to the increased annual road tax so the GT was fully equipped to justify the tax liability.

Non twincam models came in ST and SX trim levels with 1S-iLU engine. Models with the 3S-FE economy twincam came in the ZR trim level, including the Convertible. A digital instrument panel was offered on the higher grades GT and GT-R. The notchback two-door coupe bodystyle was not offered as a Celica in Japan; instead this body was sold as the Toyota Corona coupe, with fixed headlights rather than the Celica&#x27;s flip-up units.

=== Australia ===

The Australian spec Celica ST162 were the base model ST with 3S-FE engine offered as notchback coupe and liftback, and the top-of-the-line SX Liftback with higher performance 3S-GE Twincam engine. Rear spoiler and alloy wheels came standard on the SX, which made it the same appearance as the Japanese GT-R or American GT-S.

The limited edition SX White Lightning with all white bumpers, side protectors and wheels was offered in 1989. Inside, it featured cruise control (automatic models only) and the same sports seats used in the ST165 GT-Four, but was otherwise identical to the SX.

=== Europe ===
In most European countries these models were available instead:
The convertible (better known as cabriolet) was based on the 2.0 GT. The GT-S was badged 2.0 GT-i 16. The GT-Four came with turbo 4WD decal on the rear spoiler and Toyota 4WD emblem on the grille.

=== North America ===
Trims available were the ST coupe or the GT and GT-S that came as a coupe or Liftback; with the GT trim available as a soft-top convertible starting in the 1987 model year. The GT-Four was available as a model year 1988, 2 years after the release in Japan. All trims came standard with a tachometer, oil pressure, voltmeter (replaced with a boost meter in the ST165) gauges and a rear window defogger for the interior.

ST: The ST was the most basic form of the T160 chassis. In 1986, the chassis was designated as the ST161. It had the SOHC 8-valve, 2.0 L 2S-E 4-cylinder engine from the Camry, producing at 4,400 rpm and 118 ft-lbs. of torque at 4,000 rpm. However, this only lasted a year as it was changed over to an all new DOHC engine 3S-FE for the 1987 model year producing at 5,200 rpm and 124 ft-lbs. of torque at 4,400 rpm; and as a result, the chassis designation was changed to ST162. The ST was the lightest T160 chassis at 2,455 lbs. with the manual transmission. A 5-speed manual was the only transmission available in 1986, with a 4-speed automatic being optional 1987 onwards, bringing the curb weight to 2,522 lbs. Steel wheels were wrapped with 165/80-13 tires. The interior had manual windows and locks, bucket seats and an AM/FM receiver as standard features. Power steering and power brakes were standard, with ventilated discs in the front and drum brakes in the rear. Cable operated air conditioning was optional.

GT: The GT shared the ST&#x27;s engine as well as the chassis designation being the ST161 with a 2S-E engine in 1986 quickly changing over to the ST162 with a 3S-FE engine 1987 onwards. The curb weight was 2,515 lbs for the coupe and 2546 lbs. for the Liftback. A 4-speed overdrive automatic transmission (A140L) was an option, bringing the curb weight up to 2,579 and 2,610 lbs., respectively. The convertible weighed in at 2,700 lbs. for the manual and 2760 lbs. for the automatic. For the interior, the GT came with an electronic 4-speaker AM/FM/MPX tuner, power side mirrors, tilt steering wheel, driver&#x27;s lumbar support and an automatic retracting radio antenna was standard. Power locks, windows, power tilt/slide sunroof, side mirror defogger, cruise control, electronic air conditioning, and 13x5.5-inch aluminum alloy wheels were optional with 185/70-13 tires. A digital instrument panel was available as an option for the non-convertible GT trim only. The GT also includes a front strut bar across the two strut towers as an upgrade over the ST trim, but retains the front ventilated disc and rear drum brake combination from the ST.

GT-S: The GT-S (chassis code ST162) was given a de-tuned version of the DOHC 2.0 L engine (3S-GELC) featuring T-VIS and a 6,800 rpm redline producing at 6,000 rpm and 125 ft-lbs of torque at 4,800 rpm. An EGR and O2 sensor restricted the engine along with a milder ECU. The GT-S replaced the rear drum brakes with disc brakes going along with a 5x100 bolt pattern. Standard features in addition to the GT trim included an 8-way adjustable sports bucket seats with power lumbar and side bolsters, automatic climate control, side mirror defogger, wrap-around spoiler, telescopic steering wheel, and speed-rated 205/60-14 tires on 14x6-inch alloy wheels. Leather interior including shift knob, door panel inserts, and steering wheel were optional. In Canada, all GT-S models were 5-speed (S53) manual transmissions, but in the U.S., an electronic-controlled 4-speed automatic (A140E) with lock-up torque converter was available. New features in 1988–1989 included an illuminated vanity light as standard and ABS as optional.

Turbo All-Trac: The turbo All-Trac (chassis code ST165), or turbo 4wd as it was named in Canada, is the North American version of the GT-Four. It was given a DOHC turbocharged, water-to-air intercooled 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine (3S-GTE) featuring T-VIS producing at 6,000 rpm and 190 ft-lbs of torque at 3,200 rpm. The All-Trac only came with a 5-speed all-wheel-drive transmission with a viscous-coupling center differential, bringing the curb weight to 3,197 lbs. The ST165 was not sold in North America before 1988 except for seventy-seven special-edition cars sold in 1987 as 1988 models at each of the 77 Toyota dealerships in California to commemorate Toyota&#x27;s IMSA GTO championship win. These Celicas are all white with white wheels and blue interior and have &quot;IMSA GTO CHAMPION&quot; printed in small letters on the side moulding, as well as a white stripe on the grill. This top-of-the-line trim came with the same options as the GT-S with the exception of the power interior options, leather steering wheel, fog lights, V-rated tires, and a factory full body kit as standard. One interior feature that is missing from the GT-S trim and other trims is the cup holder as the center console is different due to a larger center body tunnel to accommodate for the ST165&#x27;s center drive shaft.

== Fifth generation (T180; 1989) ==
The fifth-generation Celica was introduced in September 1989 for the 1990 model year. The Celica received new Super Round organic styling, upgraded wheels and tires, more powerful GT-Four (All-Trac Turbo in the U.S.) with better cooling system, and for the Japanese market only, the four-wheel steering (4WS) models. Toyota engineers claimed that the round styling and lack of straight edges increased strength without adding weight. The Japanese market models were now S-R, Z-R, GT-R, Active Sports (first Toyota with Toyota Active Control Suspension), and GT-Four. The S-R and Z-R were powered by a 3S-FE engine, while the GT-R and Active Sports came with a 3S-GE. The 3S-GTE in the GT-Four features an air-to-air intercooler and CT26 twin entry turbo to eliminate exhaust gas interference.
The Japanese market GT-Four has and of torque, a result of more aggressive ignition advance and ceramic turbine. The Full-time 4WD system in the GT-Four has viscous coupling limited-slip center differential and Torsen rear differential.

The North American Celica had fixed door mirrors and amber front corner lights. All other destination models had folding mirrors and front clear corner lights. Driver&#x27;s side SRS Airbag is standard on all U.S. models. The base model ST has 1.6-liter 4A-FE, the GT and GT-S were powered by the 2.2-liter 5S-FE. The 1.6-liter was similar to the one used in the Corolla. The GT-S was rated more than the GT at . The 2.2-liter was designed for more low-end torque, which appealed to U.S. buyers&#x27; preferences as opposed to the high-revving engines of the past. This engine was similar to the Camry&#x27;s engine except for the balance shafts. The All-Trac Turbo was available with the improved 2.0-liter 3S-GTE engine. It was rated at and torque. The GT-S and all export market GT-Four/All-Trac Turbo are wide-body liftbacks with flared fenders. The Japanese market GT-Four was also offered as narrow-body for the pre-facelift model.
Trim levels for the European Celica were 1.6 ST-i, 2.0 GT-i 16, and GT-Four. The 2.0 GT-i 16 cabriolet was offered only in certain European countries. Only the 2.0 GT-i 16 liftback and GT-Four were officially sold in the UK. New for 1992, the wide body Liftback 2.0 GT-i 16 was offered in the Netherlands and Belgium. This was basically a GT-S with 3S-GE engine.

Model grades for Australian Celica were SX coupe, SX Liftback, GT-Four, and also 150 units limited edition GT-Four Group A Rallye. The Australian cars are less luxurious than Japanese market and North American market models. Initially, the GT-Four did not come with ABS and fog lamps, which became standard few months after the introduction. In 1993, the Limited Edition WRC Trophy model was offered in Australia. This is basically the SX with sport front seats from the GT-Four, cruise control, rear window shade / spoiler, and special decals.

In August 1990, the wide body Liftback GT-Four A and Convertible, in base and Type G trim levels, were added into the Japanese Celica line up. Super Live Sound System with 10 speakers became standard on the GT-Four A and optional in other models except the S-R. The Celica convertible was built by American Sunroof Corporation (ASC) in California. It was offered as GT in the U.S. with 5S-FE engine, and as base model and upmarket Type G in Japan or 2.0 GT-i 16 cabriolet in Europe with 3S-GE engine. The Japanese market convertible also has 4WS. To celebrate 20 years of Celica production, the 20th Anniversary GT-R was released for the Japanese market in December 1990. This limited edition GT-R has the GT-Four front bumper.

There are three different gearboxes for ST185 GT-Four. The E150F gearbox with 4.285 final gear ratio was installed in the regular Japanese version and All-Trac Turbo. The European and Australian models, as well as the RC/Carlos Sainz/Group A models, came with the E151F gearbox with 3.933 ratio. The Japanese market only GT-Four Rally, a limited edition lightweight rally version sold only in Japan (not to be confused with the Australian GT-Four Grp A Rallye model), has the E152F gearbox with close ratio on the 1st through 4th gear and 4.285 final ratio. It also came with steel wheels and without air conditioning, power windows, or a power antenna. The early model GT-Four Rally is based on the narrow body, and the facelift model is wide body with round fog lights. Also sold in Japan only was the GT-Four V. This was an economy version of narrow body without alloy wheels, leather, or Super Live Sound System, but still came with fog lights, power windows, and optional sunroof.
Anti-lock brakes (ABS) were available on the GT-S and All-Trac for all four years and was available on the GT for 1992 and 1993 models. ABS, Leather interior, power sunroof, and System 10 premium sound system are optional on the GT-S and the 1990–1992 All-Trac Turbo, and standard on the 1993 All-Trac Turbo. With its sport-style interior, power-operated driver&#x27;s seat, auto tilt-away steering wheel, and cruise control as standard equipment, the All-Trac Turbo (known as the GT-Four outside of the U.S.) was the most expensive Celica yet. With a 2.0-liter turbocharged 3S-GTE producing , it was the most powerful Celica ever sold in the U.S.

=== Facelift ===


In August 1991, Toyota facelifted the Celica for the 1992 model year. Changes included:
* Stiffer anti-roll bar was added and suspension spring rates were increased.
* New three-way catalytic converter.
* Toyota ellipse emblems on the hood and trunk.
* Taillights redesign (with smoke red frame).
* Improved gear linkage and a shorter gearshift.
* The Japanese market models received 3-point rear seat belts.
* New 5S-FE, producing and of torque.
* Front discs were now and ventilated.
* The front-drive models (except for the wide body Liftback GT-S, which used the same front bumper as the 4WD models) received a new style bumper.
* The export version GT-Four / All-Trac Turbo and GT-S retained automatic air conditioner, but the push button fan switch was replaced by the more conventional rotary type.
* The North American GT and Australian SX models received standard fog lights.
* 15-inch wheels on the Japanese Z-R (optional) and GT-R, European and North American GT, and Australian SX models (standard) fitted with 205/55VR tires.
* Discontinued Japanese market models: 4WS S-R, Active Sports, and narrow body GT-Four.
* The &quot;A&quot; was dropped from the &quot;GT-Four A&quot; and the wide-body turbo model was simply known as the &quot;GT-Four&quot;.
* New round yellow fog lights for the Japanese market GT-Four.
* The Japanese market only GT-Four Rally uses the wide body shell.
* The Cruise Control Package, SD Package and Luxury Package became optional on the Japanese market Z-R, GT-R, and GT-Four models.

==== GT-Four RC ====
For the FIA WRC Group A homologation, the special rally edition of 5000 units named Celica GT-Four RC was launched in Japan in September 1991. The export models are called the Carlos Sainz (CS) Limited Edition in Europe and Singapore (in honour of the famous European World Rally Champion) or Group A Rallye in Australia.

Special features include:

* Different intercooler (water-to-air as opposed to air-to-air) which Toyota Team Europe wanted so they could more easily tune their WRC car.
* More aggressively tuned ECU.
* Shortened shift lever throw and clutch pedal travel.
* Triple cone synchromesh on gears 2 and 3, up from double cone.
* Different hood, the emphasis of which is to get rid of heat as fast as possible (instead of scooping in air, as is the case with the standard ST185 hood).
* Different style of front bumper that is much lighter and has more openings than the one on the regular GT-Four with air-to-air intercooler.

Out of the 5,000 units, 1,800 stayed in Japan, 3,000 were for the selected European countries, 150 were delivered to Australia, 25 went to Singapore, and a few were exported to other markets.
== Sixth generation (T200; 1993) ==
In October 1993, Toyota launched the sixth-generation Celica for the 1994 model year. Celicas were available in either notchback coupe or liftback form, the convertible would come later. New safety equipment in the form of driver (and then later passenger) airbags were standard in most markets, and anti-lock brakes were available on all models.
For the U.S. market, the Celica was only available in ST and GT trims for the 1994 model year, but the addition of the optional &quot;Sports Package&quot; to the GT Liftback produced GT-S-like handling. All models came with standard dual SRS Airbags. The ST had a new 1.8-liter 7A-FE engine which could also be found in the Corolla, while the GT was powered by the carried-over 2.2-liter 5S-FE engine which featured dual overhead camshafts and fuel injection, could also be found in the Camry. The turbocharged All-Trac was no longer offered in the U.S. The 7A-FE is rated at and , while the 5S-FE is rated at and . In Canada, the Celica GT liftback with &quot;Sports Package&quot; are badged GT-S.

Initially the Japanese market models were SS-I and SS-II. The ST205 GT-Four was launched in February 1994 and the Convertible in the Autumn of the same year. The width of this generation was no longer in compliance with Japanese Government regulations concerning exterior dimensions, which added an additional tax liability on Japanese buyers. This generation also saw a badge engineered version with different headlights, called the Toyota Curren, and was sold only in Japan at &quot;Toyota Vista Store&quot; locations, allowing the Celica to be sold at different retail sales channels. The Celica was exclusive to &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot; locations.

Production of the GT-Four (or previously known as All-Trac in the U.S.), continued for the Japanese, Australian, European, and British markets. This ST205 version was to be the most powerful Celica produced to date, producing (export version) or (Japanese market) from an updated 3S-GTE engine. Influenced strongly by Toyota Team Europe, Toyota&#x27;s factory team in the World Rally Championship, the final version of the GT-Four included improvements such as an all-aluminum hood to save weight, four-channel ABS (with G-force sensor), an improved turbocharger (incorrectly known by enthusiasts as the CT20B), and Super Strut Suspension.

The 2500 homologation cars built to allow Toyota to enter the GT-Four as a Group A car in the World Rally Championship also sported extras such as all of the plumbing required to activate an anti-lag system, a water spray bar for the Intercooler&#x27;s front heat exchanger, a water injection system for detonation protection, a hood spoiler mounted in front of the windscreen to stop hood flex at high speed and the standard rear spoiler mounted on riser blocks. The car proved to be quite competitive in the 1995 World Championship. However, the team was banned from competition for a year after the car&#x27;s single victory due to turbocharger fixing—a device that meant there was no air path restriction on the intake—when the jubilee clip (worm-drive hose clamp) was undone this would flick back into place so as to go un-noticed by inspectors. Toyota has always claimed that they knew nothing of the fix—but opponents say it was one very cleverly engineered device. In some respects this car is a true sports car; in order to qualify for rallying it has a lot of special features and a unique strut arrangement.
In Australia, the 5S-FE powered Celica ST204 was offered in SX and ZR trim levels. The ZR has standard SRS Airbag, fog lights, alloys, and other features. The limited edition SX-R was offered in 1998–1999. Based on the SX, this model came with black/red interior, white-faced speedometer and tachometer, fog lights and alloy wheels.

The ST205 Celica GT-Four was available in Australia only in 1994. There was a limited delivery of only 77 units, and each vehicle came with an individually numbered plaque in the cabin and Group A Rallye badges on the hatch. All Australian models were taken from the 2,500 units homologation run and had black leather interior and a full size spare wheel. The only option being a moonroof (17 of the 77 were available with this feature).
The fourth-generation convertible was introduced in 1994. Built off of the GT coupe, the conversion took place in the ASC facility in Rancho Dominguez, California. The vehicle arrived in the US as a partially assembled vehicle. At ASC, the roof was removed and a three-layer insulated and power-operated top was installed, producing a vehicle that was virtually water and windproof.

Like its coupe and liftback siblings, the American GT convertible is ST204 with 5S-FE engine, while the Japanese Convertible and European GT cabriolet are the 3S-GE powered ST202. The Japanese market soft top Celica was offered as the base model Convertible Type X with either manual or automatic transmission, and the fully equipped automatic only Convertible.


In August 1995, minor changes were given to all Japanese market Celica Liftback models, and the SS-III was added into the line up. All models received new rear combination lamps, and if fitted, the new style rear spoiler. The front wheel drive models received new a front bumper design. The SS-III came with standard Super Strut Suspension, power steering cooler, twin piston calipers, helical LSD, shorter steering ratio rack and side aerodynamic rocker panels. The GT-Four also got side rocker panels, restyled rear spoiler, and new alloys. In January 1996, facelift was given to the Japanese market Celica convertible.

The 1996 Celica for export market received the same front restyling as the Japanese models, although the tail lights were untouched. The new front bumper has two smaller sections on each side of a smaller air dam as opposed to a single large air dam in previous models. Also new were optional side skirts to improve its aerodynamic efficiency, as well as a redesigned rear spoiler. The North American GT and Australian ZR models came with standard fog lights, and the ST and SX models without the optional fog lights had black grills fill in their place.

To celebrate 25 years of Celica, the SS-I and SS-III Special Edition were released in Japan, and the 25th Anniversary ST Limited and GT convertible marked this occasion in the U.S. These Special Edition models have special emblems on the front fenders, and the inside on the rear-view mirror hanger, and the name Celica was embroidered on the front seats.

For 1997, the only change in the North American Celica line up was the discontinuation of the GT coupe. Another minor change was given to Japanese market Celicas in December 1997. Projector headlights were optional for all models. The 3S-GE engine on the SS-II, SS-III and convertible was now the BEAMS version with VVT-i. WRC style high rear spoiler returned on the GT-Four and also standard on the SS-III.

In 1998, the underpowered ST model was discontinued in the U.S., leaving only GT models. In addition, the GT notchback coupe returned after a year&#x27;s absence. In the UK, Toyota released the SR based on the 1.8 ST. The SR has full body kit, mesh grille, 16-inch alloys, and upgraded sound system. The U.S. Celica line up was simplified even further in 1999 by eliminating all coupes, leaving only the GT Liftback and GT convertible. The GT-Four was still offered in Japan, but the 4WS SS-I was discontinued. Also in early 1999, Toyota released pictures of their XYR concept car, which would soon become the next generation Celica.

==Seventh generation (T230; 1999) ==
In July 1999, Toyota began production of the seventh-generation Celica, with sales beginning late that year. It closely resembled the XYR concept with the exception of the front bumper and rear spoiler, while omitting the previously available coupe body style. The 2000 model year Celica was an element of Toyota Project Genesis, a failed effort to bring younger buyers to the marque in the United States. Toyota took time to lighten the car and lower cost wherever possible. Power window and door lock controls were placed in the center console so only one set was necessary for both doors. Initial sunroofs were made of polymer plastic instead of the traditional glass. This generation was assembled by Kanto Auto Works at its Higashi-Fuji plant in Susono, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan.
The Celica came in only one Liftback body style with the choice of two different engines. The ZZT230 was powered by a relatively economical 1.8 L 4-cylinder 1ZZ-FE engine and the ZZT231 powered by a higher-performance 1.8 L 4-cylinder (in Europe and Japan) 2ZZ-GE version, co-developed with Yamaha, the latter featuring a two-step variable valve lift control in conjunction with its variable valve timing. In 2004, CNNMoney.com rated the Celica as one of the best cars to purchase for fuel economy.

Exporting of the Celica ceased in July 2005 for North American and Australian markets. However, until mid-May, customers could still order one, although it was advised they took action before that time ended.

The last Celica was rolled off production line on 21 April 2006, after 36 years and seven generations. In its last year of production, the Celica was only officially sold in Japan and Europe.

There has been no direct successor to the Celica, however, the Scion tC (exclusive to North America) is seen by some people as the spiritual successor to the Celica.

=== North America ===
In the U.S. and Canada, two models were offered; the base model GT and the higher performance GT-S. All models were Liftback only. All models featured dual front airbags, daytime running lights (DRL) with auto-on parking and headlights, and 4 cup holders: two in the front and two in the rear. Power door lock and power window switches were mounted on the center console to reduce costs. Rear seats were contoured for only 2 passengers and can split down 50/50 to increase cargo capacity. Two-speed front wipers had variable intermittent adjustment. The rear wiper had a single speed and fixed intermittent speed. Windshield and rear window washers were also standard. In the interest of reducing weight, the optional sunroof was made of polymer plastics instead of glass. In later models, the sunroof was made of glass. Other options include ABS, rear spoiler, fog lights, HID low beam headlights, upgraded JBL stereo system, 6-disc CD changer, leather seat surfaces, side-impact airbags, floor mats, vehicle intrusion protection (VIP) alarms with door lock/unlock feature, cargo net, cold area package (heavy-duty battery and starter motor) and liftback cargo cover.

The GT was powered by the 1ZZ-FE engine rated at at 6,400 rpm and of torque at 4,200 rpm. It uses Toyota&#x27;s VVT-i (Variable Valve Timing with intelligence) system which modulated the intake cam phase angle to increase torque and horsepower throughout the rev range. This is a similar engine used on the Matrix, Corolla, and MR2 Spyder. Transmission choices comprised a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic. The GT has standard front disc brakes and rear drum brakes, 195/60/15 with standard wheel covers or optional alloy wheels.

The GT-S was powered by the 2ZZ-GE engine rated at at 7,600 rpm and torque at 6,800 rpm. The engine featured Toyota&#x27;s VVTL-i (Variable Valve Timing and Lift control with intelligence). A second stage valve lift control for intake was added to the variable intake cam phase timing. Variants of this engine were offered in the Matrix XRS, Corolla XRS and the Lotus Elise (with a Lotus ECU which added 10 bhp). Buyers had the option of a four-speed automatic with shift buttons on the steering wheel, or a six-speed manual. The base tire size was 205/55/15 but the optional size offered was 205/50/16. The tire upgrade was merely so most GT-S models had the optional wheels and tires. All GT-S models had four-wheel disc brakes and metal pedals. Manual transmission shifters and all steering wheels were upgraded to leather-wrapped. Liftback cargo covers were standard along with fog lights for models without the &quot;Action Package&quot;.

TRD USA offered performance upgrades such as lowering springs, dampers, anti-sway bars, brake disc pads, air filters, exhaust, short-shift kits (manual transmissions), and body kits. The exhaust offered an increase of , albeit mostly at higher rpm. The most popular among buyers were the “Action Package” which offered a more aggressive front bumper with wider grille, rocker panels, and higher rear spoiler. Initially this body kits option was the same as JDM Mechanical Sports. The front bumper fairing interfered with the mounting location for the standard factory fog lights, requiring them to be adjusted or removed when this option was added.

On the 2000, 2001, 2003, and 2004 model years GT-S, the rev limiter is set to around 8,200–8,300 rpm (seems to differ vehicle-to-vehicle) while the 2002 and 2005 have it set to 7,800 (left-hand drive markets only). This allows models without the limited rpm range to remain within the car&#x27;s power band throughout the gears. First gear is excluded because the gearing ratio is much lower than 2nd gear.

The Celica received a facelift for the 2003 model year with the restyled front bumper and rear combination lamps. The interior was mildly restyled, a power antenna replaced the fixed one. In 2004, all models were fitted with a cabin air filter. The Action Package body kit was restyled in 2004 with a different front bumper, side and rear spoiler which is no longer the same as Japanese Mechanical Sports, but still higher than the standard one.

==== The end of the Celica and the declining sports coupe market ====

In July 2004, Toyota announced the Celica (as well as the MR2) would be discontinued in the United States at the end of the 2005 model year due to a lack of sales. Celica sales hit 52,406 units in 2000, but dropped sharply to 14,856 in 2003. Just 8,710 Celicas were sold in 2004, and only 3,113 were sold in 2005. The 2005 model year was the last year of the Celica in the US.

At that time the sports coupe market in general had been rapidly shrinking in that region, in part due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the effects of the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble (also known in Japan as the &quot;bubble economy&quot;), and the rising yen which had pushed up prices in overseas markets. Sales of all sports coupes had started to decline, and customers began to choose other vehicles such as SUVs. The Subaru SVX, Nissan 240SX, Honda Prelude, Mazda RX-7, Toyota Supra, and many others had been discontinued and the Acura RSX was soon to follow.

=== Japan ===
The Japanese models continued to carry SS-I and SS-II trim levels. The SS-I is powered by 1ZZ-FE engine, SS-II is motored by 2ZZ-GE engine. The SS-II also can be ordered with Super Strut Package with super strut suspension, rear strut bar, 16-inch alloys, metal pedals, and colored rocker panels. The SS-II has climate control AC with digital display. Options included the choice of the Elegant Sports Version with front lip spoiler and headlight covers, or the Mechanical Sports Version with full body kits (sportier front bumper with bigger grille, hood spoiler, rear bumper spoiler, side contoured spoilers or rocker panels, over fenders, and higher trunk spoiler}. The Japanese market Celica was updated with minor changes in August 2002, noticeably with the restyled front bumper and rear combination lamps.

Toyota also released a limited-production version of the 7th generation called the TRD Sports M based on the SS-II. This version was rated at and featured a reinforced unibody, TRD body kits with raised hood scoop and slightly different rear spoiler, and suspension components. The Sports M was only sold exclusively in Japan.

The reduction of engine displacement reflected a drop off in sales to Japanese customers due to the annual road tax liability of previous generations.

=== Europe ===
All the 7th generation Celica models for Europe have the 6-speed manual transmission and all around disc brakes, and was just marketed as 1.8 VVT-i and 1.8 VVTL-i 190 or T-Sport, which are the GT and GT-S, respectively. Premium and Style Packages were offered for the 1.8 VVT-i model. The European Celica has rear fog lights on the rear bumper.

In 2005, Toyota GB released the Celica GT. It is unrelated to the GT offered in North America. Powered by the 2ZZ-GE VVTL-i engine, the British GT is actually the T-Sport with a different body kit, different alloy wheels, 30 mm lowered suspension and part leather part Alcantara interior.

=== Asia Pacific ===
In Australia and New Zealand, the Celica was only offered with 2ZZ-GE engine in two trim levels, SX and ZR. The SX was fitted with 15-inch alloy wheels, CD player, electric windows and mirrors. The ZR has standard ABS, moonroof, SRS side and front airbags, fog lights, 16-inch alloy wheels, 6 stack in dash CD player with cassette, and aluminum pedals. All models have front and rear disc brakes. Optional extras was the 4-speed tiptronic Automatic, air conditioning, and metallic paint. TRD Sportivo body kits (which is the same as Mechanical Sports Version in Japan) are available.

Although not officially imported by the official Toyota dealerships, the Celica based on the Japanese market models was imported and sold through parallel imported dealerships in some Asian markets such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. In Thailand and Hong Kong, the Celica was offered in a single trim level, similar to the Australian ZR with the 2ZZ-GE engine.

== Eighth generation (2026) == 
In May 2023, Toyota President Koji Sato stated his desire to re-introduce the Celica brand. In November 2024, Toyota confirmed rumours that a new Celica model was being made, with likely introduction in 2026 or 2027.

== Safety ==
=== Australia ===

In Australia, 1981–1999 Toyota Celicas were all assessed in the Used Car Safety Ratings 2006 as providing &quot;average&quot; protection for their occupants in the event of a crash.

=== United States ===
A driver&#x27;s side SRS airbag is standard in all U.S. models from 1990. Dual SRS Airbags are standard from 1994. Seat-mounted side airbags are optional from 2000. The NHTSA NCAP rating for the 2005 model year is 4 stars for the Driver Front, 4 stars for the Passenger Front, and 3 stars for the Front side.

== Motorsports ==
=== Rallying ===

In motorsports, the Celica is known for its rallying prowess. The first World Rally Championship (WRC) event for the Celica was 1972 RAC Rally when Ove Andersson drove the 1600 GTV (TA22) into the ninth place. The first victory came in the 1982 Rally of New Zealand with Björn Waldegård in a 2000GT (RA63). From 1983 to 1986, the Group B Celica Twincam Turbo (TA64) won all six WRC events in Africa they entered.

After the demise of Group B, the Celica GT-Four competed in Group A Rally racing from 1988 to 1997. The car won two manufacturer&#x27;s titles and four driver&#x27;s titles. Carlos Sainz was its most successful driver, winning WRC titles with the ST165 in 1990 and the ST185 in 1992. The ST185 also won the 1993 and 1994 titles with Juha Kankkunen and Didier Auriol, respectively. The ST185&#x27;s fourth consecutive Safari Rally victory came in 1995, which was also Toyota&#x27;s 8th victory in this event. The ST205 became a center of controversy when the works Toyota Team Europe was banned for 12 months from the WRC because of use of an illegal turbo air restrictor. When TTE returned to the WRC, TTE switched to the shorter Corolla based on the European E110 3-door liftback and the new World Rally Car regulations, although the ST205 continued to be used by some regional Toyota and private teams.

=== Pikes Peak ===

Toyota Motor Sales, USA and Rod Millen Motorsports (now MillenWorks) built a Toyota Celica silhouette race car specially for the Pikes Peak.
It was powered by a modified 3S-GTE engine. Between 1994 and 1997, Rod Millen won the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb three times using this Celica, setting a record time which stood for more than 10 years. 
=== Circuit racing ===
The first-generation liftback (known as &quot;Celica LB Turbo&quot;) was used to compete in the DRM between 1977 and 1978, the car was capable of producing . The car was entered by Schnitzer via Toyota Deutschland and was driven by Harald Ertl and Rolf Stommelen for the following season. The car had a limited success scoring only 4th and 8th and was plagued with various problems throughout the two seasons before it was sold to TOM&#x27;S in Japan which under company founder, Nobuhide Tachi, it had a successful career. Tachi also had a successful career with the second-generation version. Despite its limited success in the series, the DRM liftback was immortalized by Tamiya as a 1/12 radio controlled car and a 1/24 static model.

An almost identical Celica GT Coupe Turbo was built in Denmark in 1978–1979 and raced by Peter Hansen in the Danish championship. He came second in 1979 before winning the Danish Championship in 1980. The car had the same 2,148 cc engine block (18R) and the same Mahle forged pistons as the German DRM car but with an 8-valve cylinder head, producing . The Danish-built engine with K-jetronic fuel injection proved more reliable than the mechanically fuel injected Schnitzer built engine. Both engines were equipped with KKK turbochargers.

In circuit racing, the Celica was raced by Dan Gurney&#x27;s All American Racers team with factory backing in the IMSA GTU and GTO classes from 1983 to 1988. The team captured many class wins and the GTO Championship in 1987. Slightly modified versions of stock Celicas were also used as the spec car in the Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race, always held during the weekend of the Long Beach Grand Prix or (from 1976 to 1983) the United States Grand Prix West until 2005.

The Celica (usually the first through third-generation rear-wheel drive models powered by R series engines) was sometimes raced privately in stock car racing, usually in four-cylinder classes at the grassroots level. A less stock version of the Celica with factory backing and development was campaigned successfully by several drivers in the Goody&#x27;s Dash Series. These Celicas started racing in 2000 and had 6th or 7th generation bodies but a steel tube-frame race chassis and a production-based V6 engine that was not available in the street Celica. Robert Huffman won the 2003 Dash Series Championship driving one of these Celicas, leading to Toyota&#x27;s entry in the NASCAR Truck Series the following year and then the NASCAR Cup Series and the then-NASCAR Busch Series in 2007. Osborne Motorsport won their class in the 2003 Bathurst 24 Hour race.

The seventh-generation Celicas were also successfully campaigned in the NHRA Sport Compact Drag Racing series during the early 2000s. Toyotas run in the NHRA Funny Car class also used Celica bodies, although besides the body, these cars do not share any resemblance to their street counterparts.

In Japan, the Team Racing Project Bandoh created a special rear wheel drive variant of the seventh-generation Celica using a 3S-GTE engine, having previously ran a front wheel drive sixth generation model. It was entered into GT300 class of the Japanese Grand Touring Championship (and later Super GT) until 2008, which they switched their car to Lexus IS350 in race 3 that season.

<doc id="172543" wikidata="Q690153" url="?curid=172543" title="Black bloc">
<text>A black bloc (sometimes black block) is a tactic used by protesters who wear black clothing, ski masks, scarves, sunglasses, motorcycle helmets with padding or other face-concealing and face-protecting items. The clothing is used to conceal wearers&#x27; identities from both the police and politically different organizations by making it difficult to distinguish between participants. It is also used to protect their faces and eyes from pepper spray, which is used by police during protests or civil unrest. The tactic also allows the group to appear as one large unified mass. Black bloc participants are often associated with anarchism, anarcho-communism, communism, libertarian socialism and the anti-globalization movement. A variant of this type of protest is the Padded bloc, where following the Tute Bianche movement protesters wear padded clothing to protect against the police.

The tactic was developed in the 1980s in the European autonomist movement&#x27;s protests against squatter evictions, nuclear power, and restrictions on abortion, as well as other influences. Black blocs gained broader media attention outside Europe during the 1999 Seattle WTO protests, when a black bloc damaged property of Gap, Starbucks, Old Navy, and other multinational retail locations in downtown Seattle.

==History==
===Precursors===
In February 1967, the anarchist group Black Mask marched on Wall Street in New York City wearing black clothes and balaclavas. This was the first instance of a social movement in the western world utilizing masks and black dress, which were used not for purposes of disguise but to signify a militant uniform identity. In this regard, Black Mask may have indirectly influenced the black bloc tactic.

===West German origins===

The black bloc tactic to wear black clothing, ski masks, scarves, sunglasses, motorcycle helmets with padding or other face-concealing and face-protecting items was developed in response to increased use of police force following the 1977 Brokdorf demonstration.

On 1 May 1987, demonstrators in Berlin-Kreuzberg were confronted by West Berlin police. After this, thousands of violent rioters attacked the police with rocks, bottles and Molotov cocktails. The riots at the May Day in Kreuzberg became famous after the police had to completely pull out of the &quot;SO 36&quot; neighborhood in Kreuzberg for several hours, and rioters looted shops together with local criminals.

When Ronald Reagan came to Berlin in June 1987, he was met by around 50,000 demonstrators protesting against his Cold War policies. This included a black bloc of 3,000 people. In November 1987, Hafenstraße residents and thousands of other protesters and fortified their squat, built barricades in the streets and defended themselves against the police for nearly 24 hours. After this the city authorities legalised the squatters residence.

Since the late 1980s, Berlin&#x27;s Kreuzberg district has hosted May Day clashes between anarchists and police. When the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund met in Berlin in 1988, autonomous groups hosted an international gathering of anti-capitalist activists. Numbering around 80,000, the protesters greatly outnumbered the police. Officials tried to maintain control by banning all demonstrations and attacking public assemblies. Nevertheless, there were riots and upmarket shopping areas were destroyed.

===Unified Germany===
In the period after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the German black bloc movement continued traditional riots such as May Day in Berlin-Kreuzberg, but with decreasing intensity. Their main focus became the struggle against the recurring popularity of Neo-Nazism in Germany. The &quot;turn&quot; came in June 2007, during the 33rd G8 summit. A coordinated black bloc of 2,000 international people came to Rostock, Germany, built barricades, rioted the streets, set cars alight and attacked the police during a mass demonstration. 400 police officers were injured, as well as about 500 rioters, demonstrators and activists. According to the German Verfassungsschutz, the weeks of organisation before the demonstration and the riots themselves amounted to a revival for the militant left in Germany. Since the &quot;Battle of Rostock&quot;, traditional &quot;May Day Riots&quot; after demonstrations every 1 May in Berlin, and since 2008 also in Hamburg, became more intense.

===International development===
====North America====

The first prominent use of the tactic in United States of America occurred at the Pentagon, in Washington, D.C., on 17 October 1988, although anarchists had been using similar tactics in small numbers in preceding years in places like San Francisco, culminating with several hundred anarchists in black smashing glass store fronts and attacking vehicles in the Berkeley Anarchist Riot of 1989. In D.C., over one thousand demonstrators—a small number consisting of a black bloc—called for the end to U.S. support for the right wing death squads in El Salvador. A black bloc caused damage to property of GAP, Starbucks, Old Navy, and other retail locations in downtown Seattle during the 1999 anti-WTO demonstrations. They were a common feature of subsequent anti-globalization protests.

In the years after the end of the Vietnam War, protest in the US came to assume more legalistic, orderly forms, and was increasingly dominated by the middle-class. This corresponded with the rise of a highly effective police strategy of crowd control called &quot;negotiated management&quot;. Many social scientists have noted the &quot;institutionalization of movements&quot; in this period. These currents largely constrained disruptive protest until 1999. In an unprecedented success for post-Vietnam era civil disobedience, the WTO Ministerial Conference opening ceremonies were shut down completely, host city Seattle declared a state of emergency for nearly a week, multilateral trade negotiations between the wealthy and developing nations collapsed, and all of this was done without fatalities. This occurred in the midst of mass rioting which had been set off by militant anarchists, some of them in a black bloc formation.

The call for the Seattle protest had originally come from Peoples&#x27; Global Action (a network co-founded by the Zapatistas) which supported diversity of tactics and a highly flexible definition of nonviolence. In the aftermath of the shutdown, however, various NGO spokespeople associated with Seattle DAN claimed that the riotous aspect of the WTO protests was counterproductive and undemocratic. They also asserted that it was only an insignificantly small group from Eugene, Oregon that engaged in property destruction. Medea Benjamin told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;These anarchists should have been arrested&quot;, while Lori Wallach of Public Citizen stated that she had instructed Teamsters to assault black bloc participants. Barbara Ehrenreich decried the NGO leaders as &quot;hypocrites&quot;, and wrote that nonviolent activists ought to be &quot;treating the young rock-throwers like sisters and brothers in the struggle.&quot; She also criticized the dominant nonviolent paradigm as &quot;absurdly ritualized&quot;. The solution to Ehrenreich&#x27;s impasse was the growing acceptance of black bloc tactics in the anti-globalization movement.

During protests against the 2010 G20 summit in Toronto, a black bloc riot damaged a number of retail locations including an Urban Outfitters, American Apparel, Adidas Store, Starbucks and many banking establishments.
On the day of President Donald Trump&#x27;s inauguration in 2017, black bloc groups were present among other protests in Washington, D.C., and other places. The groups engaged in vandalism, rioting, and violence. At least 217 were arrested and six police officers sustained minor injuries, and at least one other person was injured.
In February 2017, an event at the University of California, Berkeley by commentator Milo Yiannopoulos was cancelled by college administrators after protestors of a black bloc broke windows, shot fireworks, and caused a light fixture to catch fire. The cancellation of the event brought mainstream attention to anarchism and black bloc tactics.

In May 2021, Portland protesters in black bloc turned out at multiple rallies and marches that marked the one-year anniversary of the murder of George Floyd. At one event the protesters wheeled a dumpster into the street and set its contents on fire, drawing police out. The rally was declared a riot by police.

====Brazil====
During the June–July 2013 mass public demonstrations, groups of people using Black Bloc tactics started attending demonstrations, especially those held across the street from governor of Rio de Janeiro State Sérgio Cabral Filho&#x27;s residence and the state government palace. Police face accusations of infiltrating the movement and, at times, acting as agents provocateurs by starting confrontations. Many leftists claim that video footage shows an infiltrated police officer throwing a molotov cocktail that wounded a riot policeman, although this has been denied by the police and hasn&#x27;t been proven until today (2017). Protester violence occurred regularly during the Brazilian protests (particularly the week of 17 to 21 June) even when not linked with the black bloc, or with police infiltration.

Despite the denunciations by media, police, and even some activists, the black bloc tactic persisted in the movement. By October 2013, &quot;The mask-wearers were welcomed by the protesters who wanted to wreak havoc during manifestations... Indeed, this sense of solidarity amidst the demonstrations, this shared manning of barricades, inspires a common determination to fight against the fear of repression.&quot; According to a report by two Brazilian leftists published in Al Jazeera, this coincided with a revival in the breadth of the street protests that had not been seen since its early days in June. On 10 October, the Rio teachers&#x27; union (Sepe) officially declared support for the recent black bloc actions, stating that the bloc were &quot;welcome&quot; at their demonstrations. Postings on teacher Facebook groups praised bloc participants as &quot;fearless&quot;.

====Europe====
On 1 May 2018, over 1,200 black bloc took part in demonstrations in Paris, France. Public infrastructures and stores were damaged. During the demonstrations of the Yellow vests movement (autumn 2018-spring 2019) major damage was done by black bloc in Paris, Toulouse and Bordeaux. The protest resulting in the most significant amount of property damage took place in Paris when protestors took to the streets on the Champs-Élysées on 16 March 2019.

A group of about 400 black bloc demonstrators took part in the 2011 London anti-cuts protest where they targeted various high end retail outlets; according to journalist Paul Mason this may have been the largest ever black bloc assembly in the UK. Mason says some of the participants were anarchists from Europe, others were British students who joined the demonstrations after participating in the 2010 UK student protests. A black bloc protested the opening of the universal exposition Expo 2015 in Milan.

Amongst hundreds of thousands of protesters protesting the G20 Summit in Hamburg Germany were thousands of black clad rioters who clashed with police in a 3-day standoff resulting in millions of euros in property damage. At least 500 protestors were injured and more than 200 were arrested.

====Egypt====
On 25 January 2013, on the second anniversary of the Egyptian Revolution, black blocs made an appearance in the Egyptian political scenes where they reportedly attacked various Muslim Brotherhood headquarters and government buildings and stopped traffic and metro lines in more than eight cities. A group of young protesters, who identified themselves as the &quot;Black Bloc&quot;, have marked the second anniversary of the Egyptian revolution by blocking the tramway tracks in Alexandria on Friday. Egyptian Prosecutor General Talaat Abdallah ordered the police and armed forces to arrest any participant in the Black Bloc, pointing out that the group was carrying out &quot;terrorist activities&quot; and was considered by the government and under the new constitution a violent radical outlaw group.

===Police infiltration===
On occasion, police and security services have infiltrated black blocs, for purposes of investigation. Allegations first surfaced after several demonstrations. At the 2001 G8 summit in Genoa, among the many complaints about the police there was mention of video footage which &quot;suggests that men in black were seen getting out of police vans near protest marches.&quot; In August 2007, Quebec police admitted that &quot;their officers disguised themselves as demonstrators&quot; in Montebello. However, the officers purportedly did not engage in violence, and claimed that they were carrying rocks because other protesters were doing so. They were identified by genuine protesters because of their police-issue footwear. According to veteran activist Harsha Walia, it was other participants in the black bloc who identified and exposed the undercover police.

==Tactics==


Tactics of a black bloc primarily include vandalism of private property, rioting, and demonstrating without a permit. Tactics can also include use of defensive measures such as misleading the authorities, assisting in the escape of people arrested by the police (&quot;un-arrests&quot; or &quot;de-arrests&quot;), administering first aid to people affected by tear gas, rubber bullets, and other riot control measures in areas where protesters are barred from entering, building barricades, resisting the police, and practicing jail solidarity. Property destruction carried out by black blocs tends to have symbolic significance: common targets include banks, institutional buildings, outlets for multinational corporations, gasoline stations, and video-surveillance cameras.

There may be several blocs within a particular protest, with different aims and tactics. As an ad hoc group, blocs often share no universally common set of principles or beliefs apart from an adherence to—usually—leftist or autonomist values, although some anarchist groups have called for the Saint Paul Principles to be adapted as a framework in which diverse tactics can be deployed. A few radical right-wing groups, like some of the &quot;autonomous nationalists&quot; of Europe or the Australian so-called &quot;National-Anarchists&quot; have adopted &quot;black bloc&quot; tactics and dress. The political scientist Nicholas Apoifis, in his ethnography of anarchism in Athens, Greece, argues that black bloc action can constitute a form of prefigurative politics, due to its &quot;flat and horizontal organisational structure, alongside its focus on solidarity.&quot;

<doc id="172546" wikidata="Q137563" url="?curid=172546" title="Cheung Chau">
<text>Cheung Chau (; ) is an outlying island of Hong Kong, located southwest of Hong Kong Island. It is also called Dumbbell Island () due to its dumbbell-like shape. It has been inhabited for longer than most other places in Hong Kong, and had a population of 22,740 . Administratively, it is part of the Islands District.
==Geography==
Geographically the island is formed from two mostly granite masses joined by a tombolo. With an area of , the island is therefore &quot;long&quot;, hence the name as translated from Cantonese is &quot;Long Island&quot;. Thus, it is redundant to say &quot;Cheung Chau Island&quot;. The island is dumbbell-shaped, with hills at the northern and southern ends and the settlements concentrated in between.

==Economy==
The central part of the island is well-developed with shops and houses. The lane-ways are so narrow that normal motor traffic is impossible. Instead, there are small motorised trucks officially termed &quot;village vehicles&quot;, which include specially designed mini-fire engines, ambulances and police cars.

Residential areas also exist on the hills of the north and south.

The island was traditionally a fishing village and still has fishing fleets working from the harbour. However, in recent years, the island has become a major tourist attraction, offering a mixture of sandy swimming beaches, seafood cafés, and traditional Chinese culture.

==History==
In 1898, Cheung Chau was leased to the United Kingdom for 99 years (till 1997) under the Second Convention of Peking, alongside some 200 other outlying islands and the New Territories. The island thus became part of British Hong Kong. 

At that time, the island was mainly a fishing village and had more residents living on junks than on land. Cheung Chau had already been settled by people from other places in Southern China; for example, Hoklo, they are mainly fishing people; Hakka people; Chiu Chau; and Yue Ca. The island slowly evolved into a commercial hub with merchants selling supplies to the local fishing people, boat repair and fishing gear as well as the place to do business for fishing people and small farmers of other nearby islands like Lantau Island.

At the time of the 1911 census, the population of Cheung Chau, both land and boat based, was 7,686. The number of males was 4,519.

From the late-1990s to the early-2000s, a spate of suicide cases (usually by charcoal-burning) took place inside rental holiday flats of the island&#x27;s Bela Vista Villa on Tung Wan beach, seeing more than 25 suicide attempts and 20 deaths by 2008. Local newspapers soon dubbed the island &quot;Death Island&quot; and stories concerning apparitions appeared. In 2005, Islands District councillor Lam Kit-sing suggested converting the notorious villa into a macabre tourist attraction, proposing a &quot;ghost town&quot; with a &quot;charcoal-burning museum&quot;, Halloween-style fairs, and &quot;haunted&quot; flats for people to stay in. The plans quickly received strong opposition from residents, villa owners, and his fellow councillors, including criticism that they might create copycat suicides.

Now the island is a tourist attraction, which basically doubles the population every sunday.

==Sights==

===Temples===
Temples on Cheung Chau include:
*Pak Tai Temple – one of the oldest temples in Hong Kong. The temple was built in 1783. It was demolished and completely rebuilt in 1989. In front of the temple, there are 4 pairs of guarding lions. Before the altar are statues of two generals, &quot;Thousand Miles Eye&quot; () and &quot;Favourable Wind Ear&quot; (), who together are traditionally said to be able to hear and see everything
*Four temples dedicated to Tin Hau
*Hung Shing Temple. Built in 1993, it is managed by the Chinese Temples Committee.
*Kwan Kung Chung Yi Ting, a traditional temple built in 1973, dedicated to the god of justice Kwan Tai
* Kwun Yam Temple () aka. Shui Yuet Temple () aka. Chi Kung (), near Kwun Yam Wan beach. Built before 1840, and dedicated to Guanyin (Kwun Yam), it gave its name to the nearby bay Kwun Yam Wan.

===Others===
*Tung Wan and Kwun Yam Wan beaches
*Rock carvings located near Tung Wan Beach were reported by geologists in 1970, and are declared monuments of Hong Kong. This 3000-year-old rock carving is located on the east of the island, immediately below the Warwick Hotel. It consists of two groups of similar carved lines surrounding small depressions.
*Cheung Po Tsai Cave, alleged to be the hiding place of Cheung Po Tsai, a 19th-century pirate
*Cheung Chau Mini Great Wall, a hiking trail
*Cheung Chau Theatre, a former cinema

==Hospitals==

The island of Cheung Chau has one operating hospital and one abandoned hospital.

=== St. John Hospital ===

St. John Hospital, also known as Haw Par Hospital, was founded in 1934 by Hong Kong St. John Ambulance and has been the island&#x27;s main hospital since 1988.

=== The Cheung Chau Fong Bin Hospital (closed) ===

The Cheung Chau Fong Bin Hospital () was established in 1872. It was originally called the Asylum () and was not a hospital in the modern sense, in that it did not provide medical care and only functioned as a refuge for poor homeless patients to die in peace and dignity and as a mortuary for those killed in shipwrecks.

In 1915, the Asylum was expanded by a local kaifong association known as the Cheung Chau Kai Fong Hui (), and was subsequently renamed The Cheung Chau Fong Bin Hospital. The word &quot;Fong Bin&quot;, meaning &#x27;convenience&#x27; in Chinese, suggested that the hospital was meant to serve the medical needs of all. Substantial renovations took place in 1931 and 1951 to meet the rising demand for medical care in Cheung Chau and nearby outlying islands.

In 1945, the ownership of the hospital was transferred to the Cheung Chau Residents&#x27; Association (). It was staffed by reputable doctors trained in traditional Chinese medicine, and provided cheap and quality medical treatment that even attracted patients from other outlying islands.

Since the 1934 opening of the St. John Hospital, which provides Western medicine, the Fong Bin Hospital had been slowly fading away. It ultimately fell into disuse and complete abandonment in 1988.

The hospital has been listed as a Grade III historic building since 31 August 2010.

==Culture==

===Festivals===


===Bun Festival===

The annual Cheung Chau Bun Festival is a festival which includes a parade of floats, most famously including young children dressed as famous characters doing impossible balancing acts. It lasts three to four days and attracts tens of thousands of visitors to the island.

==Education==

There are currently three primary schools in Cheung Chau, including C.C.C. Cheung Chau Church Kam Kong Primary School (中華基督教會長洲堂錦江小學), Cheung Chau Sacred Heart School (長洲聖心學校), and Kwok Man School (國民學校), and two secondary schools : and Cheung Chau Government Secondary School. Formerly there were 7 primary schools including the Fisheries Joint Association Public School, Shun Dal Primary School and The Cheung Chau Government Primary School and three secondary schools including the now closed Caritas Saint Paul&#x27;s Secondary School. Although there are more people living on Cheung Chau now than ever, the fertility rate throughout Hong Kong has dropped significantly leading to many school closings throughout the city.

Cheung Chau in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 97. Within the school net are the three aided schools (operated independently but funded with government money) on Cheung Chau; no government schools are in this net.

==Notable people==
*Lee Lai-shan, a windsurfer who won Hong Kong&#x27;s first Olympic gold medal in the 1996 Summer Olympics. That Olympic gold was also Hong Kong&#x27;s last Olympic medal, as in 1997 Hong Kong became a Special Administrative Region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and now competes in the Olympics as Hong Kong, China.
*Vincent Lee Kwun Leung (), a visual artist
*Kong-Kwan Cheung, First Principal of Cheung Chau Fisheries Joint Association Public School

==Climate==
==Transportation==

Schedules on Sundays and public holidays differ from weekdays. The trip of about takes 55 minutes for ordinary ferries or 35 minutes for high speed ferries. Cheung Chau also has a ferry service to other outlying islands and regions such as Mui Wo and Chi Ma Wan.

Due to inaccessibility to cars and other vehicles, most residents use bicycles for personal transportation. A number of bicycle rental shops near the ferry pier rent bicycles to tourists. The only motor vehicles on the island are those used by the emergency services, as well as village vehicles used to transport goods.

<text>International relations theory is the study of international relations (IR) from a theoretical perspective. It seeks to explain behaviors and outcomes in international politics. The three most prominent schools of thought are realism, liberalism and constructivism. Whereas realism and liberalism make broad and specific predictions about international relations, constructivism and rational choice are methodological approaches that focus on certain types of social explanation for phenomena.

International relations, as a discipline, is believed to have emerged after World War I with the establishment of a Chair of International Relations, the Woodrow Wilson Chair held by Alfred Eckhard Zimmern at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth. The modern study of international relations, as a theory, has sometimes been traced to realist works such as E. H. Carr&#x27;s &quot;The Twenty Years&#x27; Crisis&quot; (1939) and Hans Morgenthau&#x27;s &quot;Politics Among Nations&quot; (1948).

The most influential IR theory work of the post-World War II era was Kenneth Waltz&#x27;s &quot;Theory of International Politics&quot; (1979), which pioneered neorealism. Neoliberalism (or liberal institutionalism) became a prominent competitive framework to neorealism, with prominent proponents such as Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye. During the late 1980s and 1990s, constructivism emerged as a prominent third IR theoretical framework, in addition to existing realist and liberal approaches. IR theorists such as Alexander Wendt, John Ruggie, Martha Finnemore, and Michael N. Barnett helped pioneer constructivism. Rational choice approaches to world politics became increasingly influential in the 1990s, in particular with works by James Fearon, such as the bargaining model of war.

There are also &quot;post-positivist/reflectivist&quot; IR theories (which stand in contrast to the aforementioned &quot;positivist/rationalist&quot; theories), such as critical theory.

==Early history of the field==
Early international relations scholarship in the interwar years focused on the need for the balance of power system to be replaced with a system of collective security. These thinkers were later described as &quot;Idealists&quot;. The leading critique of this school of thinking was the &quot;realist&quot; analysis offered by Carr.

However, a more recent study, by David Long and Brian Schmidt in 2005, offers a revisionist account of the origins of the field of international relations. They claim that the history of the field can be traced back to late 19th century imperialism and internationalism. The fact that the history of the field is presented by &quot;great debates&quot;, such as the realist-idealist debate, does not correspond with the historic evidence found in earlier works: &quot;We should once and for all dispense with the outdated anachronistic artifice of the debate between the idealists and realists as the dominant framework for and understanding the history of the field&quot;. Their revisionist account claims that, up until 1918, international relations already existed in the form of colonial administration, race science, and race development.

==Realism==

Realism or political realism has been the dominant theory of international relations since the conception of the discipline. The theory claims to rely upon an ancient tradition of thought which includes writers such as Thucydides, Niccolò Machiavelli, and Thomas Hobbes. Early realism can be characterized as a reaction against interwar idealist thinking. The outbreak of World War II was seen by realists as evidence of the deficiencies of idealist thinking. There are various strands of modern-day realist thinking. However, the main tenets of the theory have been identified as statism, survival, and self-help.
* Statism: Realists believe that nation states are the main actors in international politics. As such it is a state-centric theory of international relations. This contrasts with liberal international relations theories which accommodate roles for non-state actors and international institutions. This difference is sometimes expressed by describing a realist world view as one which sees nation states as billiard balls, liberals would consider relationships between states to be more of a cobweb.
* Survival: Realists believe that the international system is governed by anarchy, meaning that there is no central authority. Therefore, international politics is a struggle for power between self-interested states.
* Self-help: Realists believe that no other states can be relied upon to help guarantee the state&#x27;s survival.

Realism makes several key assumptions. It assumes that nation-states are unitary, geographically based actors in an anarchic international system with no authority above capable of regulating interactions between states as no true authoritative world government exists. Secondly, it assumes that sovereign states, rather than intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, or multinational corporations, are the primary actors in international affairs. Thus, states, as the highest order, are in competition with one another. As such, a state acts as a rational autonomous actor in pursuit of its own self-interest with a primary goal to maintain and ensure its own security—and thus its sovereignty and survival. Realism holds that in pursuit of their interests, states will attempt to amass resources, and that relations between states are determined by their relative levels of power. That level of power is in turn determined by the state&#x27;s military, economic, and political capabilities.

Some realists, known as human nature realists or classical realists, believe that states are inherently aggressive, that territorial expansion is constrained only by opposing powers, while others, known as offensive/defensive realists, believe that states are obsessed with the security and continuation of the state&#x27;s existence. The defensive view can lead to a security dilemma, where increasing one&#x27;s own security can bring along greater instability as the opponent(s) builds up its own arms, making security a zero-sum game where only &quot;relative gains&quot; can be made.

=== Neorealism ===

Neorealism or structural realism is a development of realism advanced by Kenneth Waltz in &quot;Theory of International Politics&quot;. It is, however, only one strand of neorealism. Joseph Grieco has combined neo-realist thinking with more traditional realists. This strand of theory is sometimes called &quot;modern realism&quot;.

Waltz&#x27;s neorealism contends that the effect of structure must be taken into account in explaining state behavior. It shapes all foreign policy choices of states in the international arena. For instance, any disagreement between states derives from lack of a common power (central authority) to enforce rules and maintain them constantly. Thus, there is constant anarchy in the international system that makes it necessary for states to obtain strong weapons to guarantee their survival. Additionally, in an anarchic system, states with greater power have a tendency to increase their influence further. According to neo-realists, structure is considered an extremely important element in IR and is defined in a twofold manner as: 1) the ordering principle of the international system, which is anarchy, and 2) the distribution of capabilities across units. Waltz also challenges traditional realism&#x27;s emphasis on traditional military power, instead characterizing power in terms of the combined capabilities of the state.

Waltz&#x27;s version of neorealism has frequently been characterized as &quot;Defensive Realism&quot;, whereas John Mearsheimer is a proponent of a different version of neorealism characterized as &quot;Offensive Realism.&quot;

==Liberalism==

The precursor to liberal international relations theory was &quot;idealism&quot;. Idealism (or utopianism) was viewed critically by those who saw themselves as &quot;realists&quot;, for instance E. H. Carr. In international relations, idealism (also called &quot;Wilsonianism&quot; because of its association with Woodrow Wilson) holds that a state should make its internal political philosophy the goal of its foreign policy. For example, an idealist might believe that ending poverty at home should be coupled with tackling poverty abroad. Wilson&#x27;s idealism was a precursor to liberal international relations theory, which would arise amongst the &quot;institution-builders&quot; after World War I.

Liberalism holds that state preferences, rather than state capabilities, are the primary determinant of state behavior. Unlike realism, where the state is seen as a unitary actor, liberalism allows for plurality in state actions. Thus, preferences will vary from state to state, depending on factors such as culture, economic system or government type. Liberalism also holds that interaction between states is not limited to the political/security (&quot;high politics&quot;), but also economic/cultural (&quot;low politics&quot;) whether through commercial firms, organizations or individuals. Thus, instead of an anarchic international system, there are plenty of opportunities for cooperation and broader notions of power, such as cultural capital (for example, the influence of films leading to the popularity of the country&#x27;s culture and creating a market for its exports worldwide). Another assumption is that absolute gains can be made through co-operation and interdependence—thus peace can be achieved.

The democratic peace theory and interactive model of democratic peace argue that democracies have fewer conflicts among themselves. This is seen as contradicting especially the realist theories and this empirical claim is now one of the great disputes in political science. Numerous explanations have been proposed for the democratic peace. It has also been argued, as in the book &quot;Never at War&quot;, that democracies conduct diplomacy in general very differently from non-democracies. (Neo)realists disagree with Liberals over the theory, often citing structural reasons for the peace, as opposed to the state&#x27;s government. Sebastian Rosato, a critic of democratic peace theory, points to America&#x27;s behavior towards left-leaning democracies in Latin America during the Cold War to challenge democratic peace. One argument is that economic interdependence makes war between trading partners less likely. In contrast, realists claim that economic interdependence increases rather than decreases the likelihood of conflict. While the democratic peace theory claims that democracy causes peace, the territorial peace theory claims that the direction of causality is opposite. In other words, peace leads to democracy. The latter theory is supported by the historical observation that peace almost always comes before democracy.

===Neoliberalism===

Neoliberalism, liberal institutionalism or neo-liberal institutionalism is a more recent branch of liberal international relations theory. Unlike traditional liberal theories of international politics, which focus on individual-level or domestic-level explanations, liberal institutionalism emphasizes the influence of systemic factors. Its proponents focus on the role of international institutions in allowing nations to successfully cooperate in an anarchic international system.

===Complex interdependence===
Robert O. Keohane and Joseph S. Nye, in response to neorealism, developed an opposing theory they dubbed &quot;complex interdependence.&quot; They explain that &quot;... complex interdependence sometimes comes closer to reality than does realism.&quot; In explaining this, they cover the three baseline assumptions in realist thought: first, states are coherent units and are the dominant actors in international relations; second, force is a usable and effective instrument of policy; and third, there is a hierarchy in international politics.

The heart of Keohane and Nye&#x27;s argument is that, in international politics, there are, in fact, multiple channels that connect societies exceeding the conventional Westphalian system of states. This manifests itself in many forms ranging from informal governmental ties to multinational corporations and organizations. Here they define their terminology: interstate relations are those channels assumed by realists; transgovernmental relations occur when one relaxes the realist assumption that states act coherently as units; transnational applies when one removes the assumption that states are the only units. It is through these channels that political exchange occurs, not through the limited interstate channels that are the focus of realist theory.

Moreover, Keohane and Nye argue that there is not, in fact, a hierarchy among issues, meaning that not only is the martial arm of foreign policy not the supreme tool by which to carry out a state&#x27;s agenda, but that there are a multitude of different agendas that come to the forefront. The line between domestic and foreign policy becomes blurred in this case, as realistically there is no clear agenda in interstate relations.

Finally, the use of military force is not exercised when complex interdependence prevails. In other words, for countries among which a complex interdependence exists, the role of the military in resolving disputes is negated. However, Keohane and Nye go on to state that the role of the military is in fact important with respect to an &quot;alliance&#x27;s political and military relations with a rival bloc.&quot;

=== Post-liberalism ===
One version of post-liberal theory argues that within the modern, globalized world, states in fact are driven to cooperate in order to ensure security and sovereign interests. The departure from classical liberal theory is most notably felt in the re-interpretation of the concepts of sovereignty and autonomy. Autonomy becomes a problematic concept in shifting away from a notion of freedom, self-determination, and agency to a heavily responsible and duty laden concept. Importantly, autonomy is linked to a capacity for good governance. Similarly, sovereignty also experiences a shift from a right to a duty. In the global economy, international organizations hold sovereign states to account, leading to a situation where sovereignty is co-produced among &quot;sovereign&quot; states. The concept becomes a variable capacity of good governance and can no longer be accepted as an absolute right. One possible way to interpret this theory, is the idea that in order to maintain global stability and security and solve the problem of the anarchic world system in International Relations, no overarching, global, sovereign authority is created. Instead, states collectively abandon some rights for full autonomy and sovereignty.
Another version of post-liberalism, drawing on work in political philosophy after the end of the Cold War, as well as on democratic transitions in particular in Latin America, argues that social forces from below are essential in understanding the nature of the state and the international system. Without understanding their contribution to political order and its progressive possibilities, particularly in the area of peace in local and international frameworks, the weaknesses of the state, the failings of the liberal peace, and challenges to global governance cannot be realised or properly understood. Furthermore, the impact of social forces on political and economic power, structures, and institutions, provides some empirical evidence of the complex shifts currently underway in IR.

==Constructivism==
Constructivism or social constructivism has been described as a challenge to the dominance of neo-liberal and neo-realist international relations theories. Michael Barnett describes constructivist international relations theories as being concerned with how ideas define international structure, how this structure defines the interests and identities of states and how states and non-state actors reproduce this structure. The key element of constructivism is the belief that &quot;International politics is shaped by persuasive ideas, collective values, culture, and social identities.&quot; Constructivism argues that international reality is socially constructed by cognitive structures, which give meaning to the material world. Whereas rational choice approaches assume that actors follow a &quot;logic of consequences&quot;, constructivist perspectives suggest that they adhere to a &quot;logic of appropriateness&quot;. The theory emerged from debates concerning the scientific method of international relations theories and theories role in the production of international power. Emanuel Adler states that constructivism occupies a middle ground between rationalist and interpretative theories of international relations.

Constructivist theory criticises the static assumptions of traditional international relations theory and emphasizes that international relations is a social construction. And constructivism is critical of the ontological basis of rationalist theories of international relations. Whereas realism deals mainly with security and material power, and liberalism looks primarily at economic interdependence and domestic-level factors, constructivism concerns itself primarily with the role of ideas in shaping the international system; indeed it is possible that there is some overlap between constructivism and realism or liberalism, but they remain separate schools of thought. By &quot;ideas&quot; constructivists refer to the goals, threats, fears, identities, and other elements of perceived reality that influence states and non-state actors within the international system. Constructivists believe that these ideational factors can often have far-reaching effects, and that they can trump materialistic power concerns.

For example, constructivists note that an increase in the size of the U.S. military is likely to be viewed with much greater concern in Cuba, a traditional antagonist of the United States, than in Canada, a close U.S. ally. Therefore, there must be perceptions at work in shaping international outcomes. As such, constructivists do not see as the invariable foundation of the international system, but rather argue, in the words of Alexander Wendt, that &quot;anarchy is what states make of it&quot;. Constructivists also believe that social norms shape and change foreign policy over time rather than security which realists cite.

==Marxism==

Marxist and Neo-Marxist international relations theories are structuralist paradigms which reject the realist/liberal view of state conflict or cooperation; instead focusing on the economic and material aspects. Marxist approaches argue the position of historical materialism and make the assumption that the economic concerns transcend others; allowing for the elevation of &quot;class&quot; as the focus of study. Marxists view the international system as an integrated capitalist system in pursuit of capital accumulation. A sub-discipline of Marxist IR is Critical Security Studies. Gramscian approaches rely on the ideas of Italian Antonio Gramsci whose writings concerned the hegemony that capitalism holds as an ideology. Marxist approaches have also inspired Critical Theorists such as Robert W. Cox who argues that &quot;Theory is always for someone and for some purpose&quot;.

One notable Marxist approach to international relations theory is Immanuel Wallerstein&#x27;s World-system theory which can be traced back to the ideas expressed by Lenin in &quot;Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism&quot;. World-system theory argues that globalized capitalism has created a core of modern industrialized countries which exploit a periphery of exploited &quot;Third World&quot; countries. These ideas were developed by the Latin American Dependency School. &quot;Neo-Marxist&quot; or &quot;New Marxist&quot; approaches have returned to the writings of Karl Marx for their inspiration. Key &quot;New Marxists&quot; include Justin Rosenberg and Benno Teschke. Marxist approaches have enjoyed a renaissance since the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe.

Criticisms of Marxists approaches to international relations theory include the narrow focus on material and economic aspects of life, as well as assuming that the interests pursued by actors are derived from class.

==English School==

The &quot;English School&quot; of international relations theory, also known as International Society, Liberal Realism, Rationalism or the British institutionalists, maintains that there is a &#x27;society of states&#x27; at the international level, despite the condition of &quot;anarchy&quot;, i.e., the lack of a ruler or world state. Despite being called the English School many of the academics from this school were neither English nor from the United Kingdom.

A great deal of the work of the English School concerns the examination of traditions of past international theory, casting it, as Martin Wight did in his 1950s-era lectures at the London School of Economics, into three divisions:
* Realist (or Hobbesian, after Thomas Hobbes), which views states as independent competing units
* Rationalist (or Grotian, after Hugo Grotius), which looks at how states can work together and cooperate for mutual benefit
* Revolutionist (or Kantian, after Immanuel Kant), which looks at human society as transcending borders or national identities
In broad terms, the English School itself has supported the rationalist or Grotian tradition, seeking a middle way (or via media) between the power politics of realism and the &quot;utopianism&quot; of revolutionism. The English School rejects behavioralist approaches to international relations theory.

One way to think about the English School is that, while some theories identify with just one of the three historical traditions (Classical Realism and Neorealism owe a debt to the Realist or Hobbesian tradition; Marxism to the Revolutionist tradition, for example), English School looks to combine all of them. While there is great diversity within the &#x27;school&#x27;, much of it involves either examining when and how the different traditions combine or dominate, or focusing on the Rationalist tradition, especially the concept of International Society (which is the concept most associated with English School thinking). The English School maintains that &quot;the most distinguished theories of international politics can be divided into three basic categories: realism, which emphasises the concept of &#x27;international anarchy&#x27;; revolutionism, which concentrates on the aspect of the &#x27;moral unity&#x27; of the international society, and rationalism, which is based on the aspect of &#x27;international dialogue and intercourse.&quot; Therefore, the English School highlights the assiduous interaction between the main strands of IR theory in the understanding of interstate relations.

In Hedley Bull&#x27;s &quot;The Anarchical Society,&quot; a seminal work of the school, he begins by looking at the concept of order, arguing that states across time and space have come together to overcome some of the danger and uncertainty of the Hobbesian international system to create an international society of states that share certain interests and ways of thinking about the world. By doing so, they make the world more ordered, and can eventually change international relations to become significantly more peaceful and beneficial to their shared interests.

== Functionalism ==

Functionalism is a theory of international relations that arose principally from the experience of European integration. Rather than the self-interest that realists see as a motivating factor, functionalists focus on common interests shared by states. Integration develops its own internal dynamic: as states integrate in limited functional or technical areas, they increasingly find that momentum for further rounds of integration in related areas. This &quot;invisible hand&quot; of integration phenomenon is termed &quot;spillover&quot;. Although integration can be resisted, it becomes harder to stop integration&#x27;s reach as it progresses. This usage, and the usage in functionalism in international relations, is the less common meaning of &quot;functionalism&quot;.

More commonly, however, functionalism is an argument that explains phenomena as functions of a system rather than an actor or actors. Immanuel Wallerstein employed a functionalist theory when he argued that the Westphalian international political system arose to secure and protect the developing international capitalist system. His theory is called &quot;functionalist&quot; because it says that an event was a function of the preferences of a system and not the preferences of an agent. Functionalism is different from structural or realist arguments in that while both look to broader, structural causes, realists (and structuralists more broadly) say that the structure gives incentives to agents, while functionalists attribute causal power to the system itself, bypassing agents entirely.

==Post-structuralism==
Post-structuralism differs from most other approaches to international politics because it does not see itself as a theory, school or paradigm which produces a single account of the subject matter. Instead, post-structuralism is an approach, attitude, or ethos that pursues critique in particular way. Post-structuralism sees critique as an inherently positive exercise that establishes the conditions of possibility for pursuing alternatives. It states that &quot;Every understanding of international politics depends upon abstraction, representation and interpretation&quot;. Scholars associated with post-structuralism in international relations include Richard K. Ashley, James Der Derian, Michael J. Shapiro, R. B. J. Walker, and Lene Hansen.

==Post-modernism==

Post-modernist approaches to international relations are critical of metanarratives and denounces traditional IR&#x27;s claims to truth and neutrality.

==Postcolonialism==

Postcolonial international relations scholarship posits a critical theory approach to international relations (IR), and is a non-mainstream area of international relations scholarship. Post-colonialism focuses on the persistence of colonial forms of power and the continuing existence of racism in world politics.

== Feminist international relations theory ==

Feminist international relations theory applies a gender perspective to topics and themes in international relations such as war, peace, security, and trade. In particular, feminist international relations scholars use gender to analyze how power exists within different international political systems. Historically, feminist international relations theorists have struggled to find a place within international relations theory, either having their work ignored or discredited. Feminist international relations also analyzes how the social and the political interact, often pointing to the ways in which international relations affect individuals and vice versa. Generally, feminist international relations scholars tend to be critical of the realist school of thought for their strong positivist and state-centered approach to international relations, although feminist international scholars who are also realists exist. Feminist International Relations borrows from a number of methodologies and theories such as post-positivism, constructivism, postmodernism, and post-colonialism.

Jean Bethke Elshtain is a key contributor to feminist international relations theory. In her seminal book, &quot;Women and War&quot;, Elshtain criticizes gender roles inherent in mainstream international relations theory. Particularly, Elshtain decries international relations for perpetuating a tradition of armed civic culture that automatically excludes women/wives. Instead, Elshatin challenges the trope of women as solely passive peacekeepers, using drawing parallels between wartime experiences and her personal experiences from her childhood and later as a mother. Thus, Elshtain has been lauded by some feminist international relations theorists as one of the first theorists to blend personal experience with international relations, thus challenging international relation&#x27;s traditional preference for positivism.

Cynthia Enloe is another influential scholar in the field of feminist international relations. Her influential feminist international relations text, &quot;Bananas, Beaches, and Bases,&quot; considers where women fit into the international political system. Similar to Jean Bethke Elshtain, Enloe looks at how the everyday lives of women are influenced by international relations. For example, Enloe uses banana plantations to illustrate how different women are affected by international politics depending on their geographical location, race, or ethnicity. Women, Enloe argues, play a role in international relations whether this work is recognized or not, working as labourers, wives, sex workers, and mothers, sometimes within army bases.

J. Ann Tickner is a prominent feminist international relations theorist with many notable written pieces. For example, her piece &quot;You Just Don&#x27;t Understand: Troubled Engagements Between Feminists and IR Theorists&quot; examines the misunderstandings that occur between feminist scholars and international relations theorists. Specifically, Tickner argues that feminist international relations theory sometimes works outside of traditional ontological and epistemological international relations structures, instead analyzing international relations from a more humanistic perspective. Thus, Tickner was critical of the ways in which the study of international relations itself excludes women from participating in international relations theorizing. This piece of Tickner&#x27;s was met with criticism from multiple scholars, such as Robert Keohane, who wrote &quot;Beyond Dichotomy: Conversations Between International Relations and Feminist Theory&quot; and Marianne Marchand, who criticized Tickner&#x27;s assumption that feminist international relations scholars worked in the same ontological reality and epistemological tradition in her piece &quot;Different Communities/Different Realities/Different Encounters&quot;.

==Psychological approaches to international relations==
Psychological approaches to international relations focus on the impact of cognition and emotion on world politics. Through the analysis of political decision making, scholars have examined a broad spectrum of issues ranging from nuclear strategy and nuclear proliferation to deterrence, reassurance, signaling, and bargaining, as well as conflict management and conflict resolution.

In the 1970s, scholars of world politics started drawing on new research in cognitive psychology to explain decisions to cooperate or compete in international relations. Cognitive psychology had assigned cognition a central role in the explanation of human decision-making. It found that people&#x27;s behavior often deviates from the expectations of the traditional rational choice model. To explain these deviations, cognitive psychologists developed several concepts and theories. These include theories of misperception, the importance of beliefs and schemas in information processing, and the use of analogies and heuristics in interpreting information, among others.

Scholars of international relations took up these insights and applied them to issues in world politics. For example, Robert Jervis identified patterns of leaders&#x27; misperception in historical cases that led to unwanted escalation, failures of deterrence, and the outbreak of war. Deborah Welch Larson and Rose McDermott have referred to belief systems and schemas as central drivers of information processing and foreign policy decision-making. Keren Yarhi-Milo has investigated how policy-makers rely on cognitive shortcuts called &quot;heuristics&quot; when they assess the intentions of their adversaries.

In addition to cognitive psychology, social psychology has long inspired research in international relations. Social psychologists have identified a fundamental human need for identity – the way in which a person or a group is, or wishes to be known by others. The resulting identity formation dynamics can contribute to conflicts between and among groups. Scholars of international relations have drawn on insights in social psychology to explore the dynamics of conflict among and between groups as well as processes of conflict management and resolution.

More recently, scholars of international relations have started drawing on emotion research in psychology to shed light on issues in world politics. Research in psychology suggests that affect and emotions are core drivers in decision making and behavior. This has significant consequences for our understanding of foreign policy, escalation to war, conflict resolution, and numerous other issues in world politics. For example, Rose McDermott and Jonathan Mercer were among the first to use these new findings to argue that affective experience can have adaptive functions by facilitating quick and effective decision-making. Thomas Dolan has drawn on affective intelligence theory to show that some emotional responses leaders may have to new events during wartime, such as joy or anxiety, tend to bring about change in their approaches to war, while others, like contentment or frustration, are prone to produce resistance to change. Combining insights from experimental psychology and the sociology of emotions, Robin Markwica has developed &quot;emotional choice theory&quot; as an alternative model to rational choice theory and constructivist perspectives.

Evolutionary perspectives, such as from evolutionary psychology, have been argued to help explain many features of international relations. Humans in the ancestral environment did not live in states and likely rarely had interactions with groups outside of a very local area. However, a variety of evolved psychological mechanisms, in particular those for dealing with inter group interactions, are argued to influence current international relations. These include evolved mechanisms for social exchange, cheating and detecting cheating, status conflicts, leadership, ingroup and outgroup distinction and biases, coalitions, and violence.

== Theory in international relations scholarship ==
In a 1955 article, Kenneth W. Thompson characterized IR theory as a recent phenomena in political science scholarship. Thompson distinguished between &quot;normative&quot; IR theory, &quot;general&quot; IR theory, and IR theory as the &quot;basis of action.&quot;

In recent years, several IR scholars have remarked on what they see as a trend away from IR theory in IR scholarship. The September 2013 issue of &quot;European Journal of International Relations&quot; and the June 2015 issue of &quot;Perspectives on Politics&quot; debated the state of IR theory. A 2016 study showed that while theoretical innovations and qualitative analyses are a large part of graduate training, journals favor middle-range theory, quantitative hypothesis testing and methodology for publishing.

== Alternative approaches ==


Several alternative approaches have been developed based on foundationalism, anti-foundationalism, behaviouralism, structuralism and post-structuralism.

Behavioural international relations theory is an approach to international relations theory which believes in the idea that the social sciences can adapt methodologies from the natural sciences. Accordingly, behavioural scholars reject isms (ideological approaches) because their adherents believe the maxims of their isms are self-evidently true. Instead of testing maxims systematically to determine whether they are true, behaviouralists view proponents of ideological isms as spreading propaganda in the guise of scholarship to guide policy-makers.

The latest formulation of the behavioural approach involves macro-theories or paradigms. That is, theories that can be applied at several levels of analysis. Theories previously developed in economics and sociology are applied to international affairs, while the major isms, such as realism, are reconstituted into a form that can be tested systematically with comprehensive databases. The major international relations paradigms are identified as the Marxian (not ideological Marxism), mass society, community building, and rational actor paradigms, each of which are homes to alternative variants. Behavioural scholars seek to retrofit isms identified above into variants of existing paradigms that can be tested empirically, whereupon the future of international relations theory will move beyond untested maxims to a solid foundation of knowledge.

<doc id="172551" wikidata="Q165401" url="?curid=172551" title="Mainau">
<text>Mainau also referred to as Mav(e)no(w), Maienowe (in 1242), Maienow (in 1357), Maienau, Mainowe (in 1394) and Mainaw (in 1580) is an island in Lake Constance (on the Southern shore of the Überlinger See near the city of Konstanz, Baden-Württemberg, Germany). It is maintained as a garden island and a model of excellent environmental practices.[1] Administratively, the island has been a part of Konstanz since December 1, 1971, when the municipality of Litzelstetten, of which Mainau was part, was incorporated into Konstanz. Mainau is still part of Litzelstetten, now one of 15 wards (administrative subdivisions) of Konstanz.


The island belongs to the Lennart Bernadotte-Stiftung (eng. The Lennart Bernadotte Foundation), an entity created by Prince Lennart Bernadotte, Count of Wisborg, originally a Prince of Sweden and Duke of Småland. It is one of the main tourist attractions of Lake Constance. Beside flowers there is a park landscape with views on the lake. There is also a greenhouse with a tropical climate and thousands of butterflies.

Mainau Bay is the location of their university&#x27;s sailing club.

==Geography==
===Position===
The island averages out at a height between (roughly equals the lake’s average medium water-level) and above sea level. Its highest peak is located at the Großherzog-Friedrich Terrace (historic water reservoir). Mainau Island is long from North to South and a wide from West to East. The island’s circumference is about . The shortest distance between the downwelling molasse slice and the lake’s shore is about .

===Population===
Few people inhabit Mainau Island. Due to its small number of inhabitants, it is considered a hamlet. Meyer’s Lexikon’s issue of 1888 declared that 28 people lived on Mainau Island. During the census of 1961, a population of 123 was verified.
Count Björn Bernadotte is living in the castle on Mainau Island.

===Flora and fauna===

Due to subtropical influences, Mainau features an almost year round warm climate, that allows the cultivation of exotic trees like banana trees or many kinds of palm trees.

Besides this subtropical vegetation, Mainau is also home to many topical Central European trees like the lind. 

The cultivation of the gardens has a long history in Mainau and attract thousands of tourists from all over the world each year.

== Parks and gardens ==

Mainau Island is a &quot;flowering island&quot; notable for its parks and gardens. Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden, created the island&#x27;s arboretum, which now contains 500 species of deciduous and coniferous trees, many exotic and valuable, including fine specimens of &quot;Sequoiadendron giganteum&quot; (1864) and &quot;Metasequoia glyptostroboides&quot; (1952). The island also contains about 200 rhododendron and azalea varieties.

Due to the advantageous climate at the lake, palm trees and other Mediterranean plants can grow on the drop-shaped island. Because of its rich subtropical and partly even tropical vegetation, Mainau Island is also called &quot;flowering island in the Lake Constance&quot;. Count Lennart Bernadotte, who died in 2004, liked to call his island &quot;Blumenschiff&quot; (engl. flower ship). He also described the famous destination as follows: &quot;She is a coquettish little Lady, Mainau Island, who constantly demands much attention, even more love and ceaselessly new clothes.&quot; - Lennart Bernadotte. By &quot;new clothes&quot;, he probably meant the blossoms, plants and flower-beds which are constantly renewed by the gardeners.

Apart from the historic buildings, the centerpiece of Mainau Island is the Arboretum with its 500 different types of rare and valuable broad-leaved trees and conifers, which was created in 1856 by grand duke Friedrich I. Among those is one of Germany&#x27;s &quot;oldest&quot; dawn redwood trees (Metasequoia glyptostroboides). The tree, which originated from China, was planted on the island in 1952, when it was just tall. Particularly mighty are some exemplars of the giant redwood (Sequoiadendron giganteum). Their seeds came from California in 1853 and were planted on the island in 1864, which makes them one of the oldest of their kind in Europe. You can find the above-mentioned giant redwoods as well as Cedars, Dawn Redwoods and Tulip Poplars on the island. The Arboretum expands towards the north-west of the island.
Spring marks the beginning of the &quot;Blumenjahr&quot; (eng. Flower Year) with an exhibition of orchids. From March to May you can see several types of flowers in full bloom, like Tulips, Daffodils, Primroses, Forget-Me-Nots and Hyacinths. To show the full beauty of all these flowers the so-called „Frühlingsallee“ (eng. Spring Avenue) was opened, which is a path across the island surrounded by beds of these plants. From May to June over 200 kinds of Rhododendrons and Azaleas are in full bloom. To the west of the &quot;Comturey-Keller&quot; you can find an Italian rose garden commissioned by Friedrich I. This rose garden is strictly geometric and consists of pergolas, sculptures and fountains. In general, over 1200 kinds of roses can be found on the island.

„Frühlingsallee“ leads to „Mediterran-Terrassen“ (eng. Mediterranean Terrace) where exotic plants such as palm families, agaves, cacti and bougainvillea are presented in pails during summer. Lake Constance and its surroundings as well as the Alps can be seen in a panoramic view from here. In July the blossoms of brugmansia and hibiscus are blooming on Mainau Island and in August the blossoms of passion flowers bloom.

On the southern end you can find “Südgarten” (eng. South Garden) where in autumn fields of dahlia with approximately 20,000 dahlia bushes and 250 varieties gleam from September until October. Spring and summer flowers such as different kinds of fuchsia are growing on the affiliated shore garden to the eastern side of “Südgarten”.

The “Bodenseerelief” (eng. Relief of Lake Constance) is a very popular photo motive. It is a relief with the picture of a flower which is changed by season. A small harbor with a landing place is situated to the northern side of Mainau Island. Excursion boats lay in here and another entrance to “Frühlingsallee” can be found here.

== History ==
Until the Napoleonic mediatisations and secularisations of small German fiefs this island belonged to the Order of Teutonic Knights. It was later sold into private ownership. In 1853 Grand Duke Frederick I of Baden purchased the island as his personal property and used the palace built by the Teutonic Knights as summer palace. At the end of World War I Baden became a republic with the abdication of Grand Duke Frederick II, son of Frederick I. The former Grand Duke retained his private property including Mainau. When he died childless in 1928 the island passed to his sister Victoria of Baden, wife of King Gustaf V of Sweden. Upon her death two years later she bequeathed the island to her second son Prince Wilhelm, Duke of Södermanland and his descendants. In 1932 Prince Wilhem gave Mainau to his only child Lennart Bernadotte who owned it until 1974 when he transferred the island to a foundation. Count Bernadotte formed &quot;Enterprise Mainau GmbH&quot; in 1991 as a private enterprise to manage the island for the benefit of the &quot;Lennart Bernadotte-Stiftung&quot;. The Count remained active in managing Mainau until his death in 2004 but had appointed his second wife Sonja co-manager in 2001. Widowed, she and their children ran both the foundation and the management company until 2007. Since January 2007 Bettina Bernadotte, the eldest daughter of Lennart and Sonja, directs the Mainau GmbH as current manager, and since 2011 her brother Björn Bernadotte has joined her.

===Pre- and early history===
In 1862, signs of an earlier population were discovered along the south banks of Mainau and soon exploited by domain administrator Walter: among the items were wedges, a potsherd, flint splinters, an axe and a muller. The pile dwelling settlement made up of six houses was uncovered in the 1930s and dated back to the Neolithic Age (3,000 b.c.). Lake-dwelling settlements of the Neolithic and the Bronze Age were located along the northern shore and the southwestern island along the shallow water zone.

<text>Stunnel is an open-source multi-platform application used to provide a universal TLS/SSL tunneling service.

Stunnel is used to provide secure encrypted connections for clients or servers that do not speak TLS or SSL natively. It runs on a variety of operating systems, including most Unix-like operating systems and Windows. Stunnel relies on the OpenSSL library to implement the underlying TLS or SSL protocol.

Stunnel uses public-key cryptography with X.509 digital certificates to secure the SSL connection, and clients can optionally be authenticated via a certificate.

If linked against libwrap, it can be configured to act as a proxy–firewall service as well.

Stunnel is maintained by Polish programmer Michał Trojnara and released under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with OpenSSL exception.

==Example==
A stunnel can be used to provide a secure SSL connection to an existing non-SSL-aware SMTP mail server. Assuming the SMTP server expects TCP connections on port 25, the stunnel would be configured to map the SSL port 465 to non-SSL port 25. A mail client connects via SSL to port 465. Network traffic from the client initially passes over SSL to the stunnel application, which transparently encrypts and decrypts traffic and forwards unsecured traffic to port 25 locally. The mail server sees a non-SSL mail client.

The stunnel process could be running on the same or a different server from the unsecured mail application; however, both machines would typically be behind a firewall on a secure internal network (so that an intruder could not make its own unsecured connection directly to port 25).

<doc id="172553" wikidata="Q6689" url="?curid=172553" title="French literature">
<text>French literature () generally speaking, is literature written in the French language, particularly by citizens of France; it may also refer to literature written by people living in France who speak traditional languages of France other than French. Literature written in the French language by citizens of other nations such as Belgium, Switzerland, Canada, Senegal, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, etc. is referred to as Francophone literature.

For centuries, French literature has been an object of national pride for French people, and it has been one of the most influential aspects of the literature of Europe. France ranks first on the list of Nobel Prizes in literature by country.

One of the first known examples of French literature is the Song of Roland, the first major work in a series of poems known as, &quot;chansons de geste&quot;.

The French language is a Romance language derived from Latin and heavily influenced principally by Celtic and Frankish. Beginning in the 11th century, literature written in medieval French was one of the oldest vernacular (non-Latin) literatures in western Europe and it became a key source of literary themes in the Middle Ages across the continent.

Although the European prominence of French literature was eclipsed in part by vernacular literature in Italy in the 14th century, literature in France in the 16th century underwent a major creative evolution, and through the political and artistic programs of the Ancien Régime, French literature came to dominate European letters in the 17th century.

In the 18th century, French became the literary lingua franca and diplomatic language of western Europe (and, to a certain degree, in America), and French letters have had a profound impact on all European and American literary traditions while at the same time being heavily influenced by these other national traditions. Africa and the far East have brought the French language to non-European cultures that are transforming and adding to the French literary experience today.

Under the aristocratic ideals of the Ancien Régime (the &quot;honnête homme&quot;), the nationalist spirit of post-revolutionary France, and the mass educational ideals of the Third Republic and modern France, the French have come to have a profound cultural attachment to their literary heritage. Today, French schools emphasize the study of novels, theater and poetry (often learnt by heart). The literary arts are heavily sponsored by the state and literary prizes are major news. The and the are important linguistic and artistic institutions in France, and French television features shows on writers and poets (one of the most watched shows on French television was &quot;Apostrophes&quot;, a weekly talk show on literature and the arts). Literature matters deeply to the people of France and plays an important role in their sense of identity.

As of 2022, fifteen French authors have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature which is more than novelists, poets and essayists of any other country. In 1964 Jean-Paul Sartre was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, but he declined it, stating that &quot;It is not the same thing if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre or if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre, Nobel Prize winner. A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution, even if it takes place in the most honorable form.&quot;

<text>The Nuremberg rallies (officially &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;Reich Party Congress&quot;) were a series of celebratory events coordinated by the Nazi Party and held in the German city of Nuremberg from 1923 to 1938. The first nationwide party convention took place in Munich in January 1923, but the location was shifted to Nuremberg that September. The rallies usually occurred in late August or September, lasting several days to a week. They played a central role in Nazi propaganda, using mass parades, &quot;military rituals,&quot; speeches, concerts, and varied stagecraft methods to project the image of a strong and united Germany under Nazi leadership.

The rallies became a national event following Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in 1933, and were thereafter held annually. Once the Nazi dictatorship was firmly established, party propagandists began filming the rallies for a national, and international, audience. Noted Nazi filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl produced several films, including &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; (1934) and &quot;The Victory of Faith&quot; (1933), at the rally grounds in Nuremberg. The 1938 rally celebrated the &quot;Anschluss&quot;—Germany&#x27;s annexation of Austria—which occurred earlier that year.

The planned 1939 rally was cancelled due to Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland. Scheduled to begin on 2 September, this rally was ironically called the , or &quot;Rally of Peace.&quot; The regime never held another rally, as Germany prioritized its efforts in the Second World War. By March 1940, construction at the rally grounds had &quot;almost halted,&quot; although prisoners of war continued work as late as 1943, being housed in barracks originally &quot;erected for rally participants.&quot;

== History and purpose ==
The first Nazi &quot;Party Day&quot; was held in 1920 by the &quot;National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Association,&quot; the precursor of the Brownshirts. Early party rallies occurred in 1923 at Munich, and in 1926 at Weimar. At the 1926 rally, Hitler was able to hold &quot;both the general parade as well as the consecration of the flags&quot; at Weimar, where he spoke about the meaning of the Nazi flag as &quot;some three hundred&quot; of the banners were displayed on stage behind him.
=== Political purpose ===
The rallies were not a &quot;decision-making body,&quot; and Hitler did not allow their &quot;parliamentarization.&quot; Rather, their purpose was to &quot;instill the Hitler myth deeply into the hearts of the faithful,&quot; with &quot;rituals,&quot; &quot;fireworks,&quot; and &quot;invocations surrounding the flag&quot; all playing a part. Nuremberg was &quot;designed from the start as a place for show and spectacle,&quot; and not for &quot;debates&quot; over the party&#x27;s policy. Hitler himself declared that the rallies should be a &quot;clear and understandable demonstration of the will and the youthful strength&quot; of the party, while Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels said that the rallies changed a participant &quot;from a little worm into part of a large dragon.&quot;

From 1927 onward, party rallies took place exclusively in Nuremberg. The party chose Nuremberg because of its &quot;rich history,&quot; as the &quot;city had been the diet of the Holy Roman Empire&quot; in the medieval era. The Nazis also began calling it &quot;the most German of German cities.&quot; Diehard anti-Semite Julius Streicher, who published the militant &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; newspaper, also led the Nuremberg regional party, and the city had been a &quot;hotbed of Nazi support&quot; during the movement&#x27;s rise to power. Lastly, the Luitpoldhain park gave Nuremberg the &quot;advantage of a large open space for mass gatherings.&quot; 

=== Content of rallies and architectural design ===

Hitler chose architect Albert Speer to improve the rally complex and, in the summer of 1933, Speer &quot;reshaped Nuremberg&quot; to make it &quot;suitable for hosting what was now the party in power.&quot; In 1934, he enlarged the Zeppelin Field structures and built them in stone, specifically pink and white granite. In Speer&#x27;s own words, he designed a &quot;mighty flight of stairs topped and enclosed by a long colonnade, flanked on both ends by stone abutments. Undoubtedly it was influenced by the Pergamum altar.&quot; Hitler agreed with Speer&#x27;s plan, and the finished stadium had a capacity of hundreds of thousands of people. Speer also used lighting to highlight the architecture—and present Hitler in an impressive way—with &quot;130 aircraft searchlights&quot; arranged around and above the stadium. Speer&#x27;s so-called &quot;Cathedral of Light,&quot; or &quot;Lichtdom&quot;, was a key feature of the event, and has been described as the &quot;single most dramatic moment of the Nazi Party rallies.&quot; The Flak Searchlight-34 and -37 models used for the effect were developed in the 1930s, and had &quot;an output of 990 million candelas.&quot;

Rallies opened with Richard Wagner&#x27;s 1868 opera, &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;, performed by the Berlin State Opera, and ceremonies included a parade where district party flags were touched to the &quot;Blutfahne&quot;, the flag used during the failed Beer Hall Putsch coup attempt of 1923. The rally ended with a speech from Hitler. Spotlights focused on the &quot;place where Hitler entered the arena,&quot; and music played from &quot;multiple bands, orchestras, and loudspeakers&quot; as he approached the podium. Hitler&#x27;s speeches at Nuremberg have been described, like his other speeches, as &quot;less about meaningful content and more about creating a dramatic impact using a mishmash of stereotypes, rhetorical devices, and emotionally-charged language.&quot;
==== Nuremberg Laws ====

During a special Reichstag meeting at the 1935 Nuremberg rally, the German government enacted the Nuremberg Laws, stripping German Jews of their citizenship, making the swastika banner the official national flag, and banning &quot;marriage and sexual relationships between Jews and non-Jews.&quot; The Nuremberg Laws have been described as the &quot;most notorious&quot; piece of anti-Semitic legislation enacted by Hitler&#x27;s regime.

The Nuremberg Laws were based not on religion, but on race, being grounded on the idea that &quot;racial identity&quot; was &quot;transmitted irrevocably through the blood&quot; of Jewish ancestors. Personally designed by Hitler and proclaimed on 15 September 1935, the laws were &quot;among the first of the racist Nazi laws that culminated in the Holocaust.&quot;

==Rallies ==

Each rally was given a programmatic title, which related to recent national events:

* 1923: The First Party Congress took place in Munich on 27 January 1923.
* 1923: The &quot;German Day Rally&quot; was held in Nuremberg, 1–2 September 1923.
* 1926: The 2nd Party Congress (&quot;Refounding Congress&quot;) was held in Weimar, 3–4 July 1926.
* 1927: The 3rd Party Congress (&quot;Day of Awakening&quot;) was held in Nuremberg, 19–21 August 1927. The propaganda film was made at this rally.
* 1929: The 4th Party Congress, known as the &quot;Day of Composure&quot;, was held in Nuremberg, 1–4 August 1929. The propaganda film was made at this rally.
* 1933: The 5th Party Congress was held in Nuremberg, 31 August – 3 September 1933. It was called the &quot;Rally of Victory&quot; (). The term &quot;victory&quot; relates to the Nazi seizure of power and the victory over the Weimar Republic. The Leni Riefenstahl film was made at this rally. Hitler announced that from then on all rallies would take place in Nuremberg.
* 1934: The 6th Party Congress was held in Nuremberg, 5–10 September 1934, which was attended by about 700,000 Nazi Party supporters. Initially it did not have a theme. Later it was labeled the &quot;Rally of Unity and Strength&quot; (), &quot;Rally of Power&quot; (), or &quot;Rally of Will&quot; (). The Leni Riefenstahl film &quot;Triumph des Willens&quot; was made at this rally. This rally was particularly notable due to Albert Speer&#x27;s Cathedral of light: 152 searchlights that cast vertical beams into the sky around the Zeppelin Field to symbolise the walls of a building.
* 1935: The 7th Party Congress was held in Nuremberg, 10–16 September 1935. It was called the &quot;Rally of Freedom&quot; (). &quot;Freedom&quot; referred to the reintroduction of compulsory military service and thus the German &quot;liberation&quot; from the Treaty of Versailles. Leni Riefenstahl made the film (&quot;Day of Freedom: Our Armed Forces&quot;) at this rally, and the Nazis introduced the Nuremberg Laws.
* 1936: The 8th Party Congress was held in Nuremberg, 8–14 September 1936. It was known as the &quot;Rally of Honour&quot; (). The remilitarization of the demilitarized Rhineland in March 1936 constituted the restoration of German honour in the eyes of many Germans. The film incorporated footage shot at this rally, as well as the rally of 1937.
* 1937: The 9th Party Congress was held in Nuremberg, 6–13 September 1937. It was called the &quot;Rally of Work&quot; (). It celebrated the reduction of unemployment in Germany since the Nazi rise to power.
* 1938: The 10th Party Congress was held in Nuremberg, 5–12 September 1938. It was named the &quot;Rally of Greater Germany&quot; (). This was due to the annexation of Austria to Germany that had taken place earlier in the year.
* 1939: The 11th Party Congress, scheduled for 2–11 September 1939, was given the name &quot;Rally of Peace&quot; (). It was meant to reiterate the German desire for peace, both to the German population and to other countries. It was cancelled at short notice, as one day before the planned start date, Germany began its offensive against Poland, starting World War II on 1 September 1939.

== Propaganda films ==

The first film to document a Nuremberg rally was &quot;A Symphony of the Will to Fight&quot;, released in 1927. The most famous films, however, were made by director Leni Riefenstahl for the rallies between 1933 and 1935. Her first movie, &quot;Victory of Faith&quot; (), was released in 1933. Because the film featured SA chief Ernst Röhm, who was later killed at Hitler&#x27;s orders in the 1934 Night of the Long Knives, almost all copies of were destroyed. It was considered a lost film until a copy was found in East Germany&#x27;s film archives in the 1980s.

The rally of 1934 became the setting for Riefenstahl&#x27;s award-winning &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; (). In 1935 she made &quot;Day of Freedom: Our Armed Forces&quot; () about the German Army, filmed because the army felt it was not represented well enough in &quot;Triumph of the Will.&quot; Riefenstahl, who lived until 2003, would face lifelong controversy because of her films and closeness to the regime.

The 1936 and 1937 rallies were covered in the short film , directed by Hans Weidemann.

== Rally books ==
There were two sets of official, or semi-official, books covering the rallies. The so-called &quot;Red books&quot; were officially published by the Nazi Party and contained the proceedings of each rally, along with the full text of speeches.

The &quot;Blue books&quot; were published initially by Julius Streicher, the of Nuremberg, and later by Hanns Kerrl, not by the party press. These were larger scale books that included excerpts of speeches in addition to photographs.

Alongside these books, collections of photos by Hitler&#x27;s official photographer, Heinrich Hoffman, were published to commemorate each Party congress, as well as pamphlets of Hitler&#x27;s speeches. Hoffman created 100-image series on the 1936, 1937, and 1938 rallies.

<text>Eleoncio Mercedes (September 12, 1957 – December 22, 1985) was a Dominican boxer, who was world champion in the Flyweight division.

==Amateur career==
As an amateur he competed for his native country at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He was stopped in the first round of his opening round bout to Aleksandr Tkachenko of the Soviet Union. Mercedes was the flag bearer for the Dominican Republic in the 1976 opening ceremony.

==Pro career==
Born in La Romana, Mercedes campaigned most of his career in the western United States and in Mexico. He debuted as a professional boxer on July 2 of 1978 with a win over Darryl Jones in Stockton. He suffered his first defeat when he lost by a decision in Las Vegas to future world champion Joey Olivo, in Mercedes&#x27; third bout as a paid fighter.

Mercedes&#x27; first of 11 fights in a row in Mexico came in 1979, when he lost by a knockout in seven rounds to Juan Díaz. During that span of 11 fights in Mexico, he went 6-3-2, fighting in such places as Mexico City, Monterrey and Reynosa. He lost to Candido Tellez but also beat former world champion Guty Espadas, by a knockout in nine during that span.

His first fight in the Dominican Republic was a 1982 rematch with Diaz, held in Santo Domingo. He won the fight by a decision in twelve rounds, to avenge his defeat at the hands of Diaz. Up until that moment, Mercedes&#x27; record was of 10 wins, 6 losses and 2 draws, reason why it was a little surprising to his fans when the WBC announced it would give Mercedes a chance at becoming a world champion, against two time world champion Freddie Castillo, who was in his second reign. The two boxers met on November 6 of 1982, at Los Angeles. Mercedes caused another surprise among many boxing fans by defeating Castillo by a decision in 15 rounds and becoming WBC and Lineal Flyweight champion.

In his first defense, Mercedes put the titles on the line against the British boxer Charlie Magri. In round seven, the fight had to be stopped because of a cut suffered by Mercedes, which had been determined to be from a punch by Magri. Mercedes then lost his world Flyweight championships by a technical knockout in that round.

After that, Mercedes kept on boxing, but had mixed fortunes. He managed to beat future world title challenger Alonzo Gonzalez by a decision, but lost to future world champion, Mexican German Torres by a knockout in the ninth round. Mercedes also lost a twelve-round decision to future world champion Raul Jibaro Perez, as well as being knocked out in the sixth round by former world Bantamweight champion Alberto Davila.

==Death==
A few days before Christmas in 1985, Mercedes was shot and killed by a policeman in his native La Romana, aged 28, after allegedly pulling a gun on the policeman. Mercedes had been drinking in a bar when he was shot to death. Confusion exists as to how this incident took place as some sources state the altercation happened after a car accident.

<doc id="172562" wikidata="Q7512477" url="?curid=172562" title="Sigmund Freud Archives">
<text>The Sigmund Freud Archives mainly consist of a trove of documents housed at the US Library of Congress and in the former residence of Sigmund Freud during the last year of his life, at 20 Maresfield Gardens in northwest London. The archive comprises Freud&#x27;s tapes, letters and papers. It was founded in 1951 by Kurt R. Eissler among others, and received contributions from Anna Freud.

It was at the center of a complicated scandal, described in Janet Malcolm&#x27;s book &quot;In the Freud Archives&quot; and also covered by Jeffrey Masson in his book &quot;Final Analysis.&quot;

The Archives were founded by Kurt R. Eissler in 1951, together with a group of people who knew Freud personally, including Heinz Hartmann, Ernst Kris, Bertram Lewin and Hermann Nunberg. It was directed by Eissler for decades after its founding. Eissler prevented many well-meaning scholars from seeing many Freud documents claiming confidentiality, even when their donors had not requested nor demanded that confidentiality, nor was anyone a potential victim of the revelation of those documents. By the 1980s, Eissler, with the help of Anna Freud, had expanded the collection to include thousands of items.

=== Masson controversy ===

Eissler was introduced to Masson in 1974. Masson was appointed secretary, and Eissler intended for Masson to succeed him as director, which he did in 1980. Being an officer of the Archives, Masson had administrative access to all its documents, and he was therefore allowed to see anything he wanted breaking the seal whenever necessary.

In 1981, Masson published a paper wherein he claimed that Freud&#x27;s abandonment of his seduction theory had taken place for reasons not related to the scientific merit of the theory, namely that Freud believed that granting the truth of his female patients&#x27; claims that they had been sexually abused would risk the reputation of the emerging psychoanalytic method. Masson said that &quot;Freud began a trend away from the real world that, it seems to me, has come to a dead halt in the present-day sterility of psychoanalysis throughout the world.&quot;

Eissler was deeply shocked (&quot;Just today Masud Khan called me from London and asked me to dismiss you from the Archives. The board members, all of them, or at least most of them, are asking for the same.&quot;), and Masson was subsequently dismissed from his job at the Archives, whereupon followed bilateral legal action and a well-publicized scandal.

=== Recent history ===
Harold P. Blum succeeded Masson and Eissler as Executive Director. He was again succeeded by Louis Rose, who is the current director . The other current officers are Jennifer Stuart as President, Nellie L. Thompson as Secretary, and W. Craig Tomlinson as Treasurer.

<text>Janet Clara Malcolm (born Jana Klara Wienerová; July 8, 1934 – June 16, 2021) was an American writer, staff journalist at &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine, and collagist who fled antisemitic persecution in Nazi-occupied Prague. She was the author of &quot;&quot; (1981), &quot;In the Freud Archives&quot; (1984), and &quot;The Journalist and the Murderer&quot; (1990). Malcolm wrote frequently about psychoanalysis and explored the relationship between journalist and subject. She was known for her prose style and for polarizing criticism of her profession, especially in her most contentious work, &quot;The Journalist and the Murderer,&quot; which has become a staple of journalism-school curricula.

== Early life ==
Malcolm was born in Prague in 1934, one of two daughters (the other is the author Marie Winn), of Hanna (née Taussig) and Josef Wiener (aka Joseph A. Winn), a psychiatrist. She resided in New York City after her Jewish family emigrated from Czechoslovakia in 1939, fleeing Nazi persecution of Jews.&lt;ref name=&quot;paris-review/interview/6073&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm was educated at the High School of Music and Art, and then at the University of Michigan, where she wrote for the campus newspaper, &quot;The Michigan Daily&quot;, and the humor magazine, &quot;The Gargoyle&quot;, later editing &quot;The Gargoyle&quot;.

== Career ==
Malcolm was a literary nonfiction writer known for her prose style and her examination of the relationship between journalist and subject. She began working at &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1963 with women&#x27;s interest assignments,&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian/2011/malcolm-life&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; writing about holiday shopping and children&#x27;s books, as well as a column on home decor. She next wrote about photography for the magazine. She moved to reporting in 1978, which Malcolm attributed to her smoking cessation in a 2011 profile by Katie Roiphe: &quot;She began to do the dense, idiosyncratic writing she is now known for when she quit smoking in 1978: she couldn&#x27;t write without cigarettes, so she began reporting a long &quot;New Yorker&quot; fact piece, on family therapy, called &#x27;The One-Way Mirror.&#x27;&quot; Her preference for writing in the first person was influenced by &quot;New Yorker&quot; colleague Joseph Mitchell, and she developed an interest in the construction of the auctorial subject as much as the objects it described, quickly realizing &quot;this &#x27;I&#x27; was a character, just like the other characters. It&#x27;s a construct. And it&#x27;s not the person who you are. There&#x27;s a bit of you in it. But it&#x27;s a creation. Somewhere I wrote, &#x27;the distinction between the I of the writing and the I of your life is like Superman and Clark Kent.&#x27;&quot; She turned this interest in the construction of narrative to a variety of subjects, including two books about couples (Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas, and poets Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes), one on Anton Chekhov, and another on the true crime genre. In a number of works, she returned repeatedly to the subject of psychoanalysis.

Malcolm was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;artsandletters/members&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Her papers are held at the Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library at Yale University, which acquired her archive in 2013.

===&quot;Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession&quot;===

In 1981, Malcolm published a book on the modern psychoanalytic profession, following a psychoanalyst she gave the pseudonym “Aaron Green”. Freud scholar Peter Gay wrote that Malcolm&#x27;s &quot;witty and wicked &quot;Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession&quot; has been praised by psychoanalysts (with justice) as a dependable introduction to analytic theory and technique. It has the rare advantage over more solemn texts of being funny as well as informative&quot;.

In his 1981 &quot;New York Times&quot; review, Joseph Edelson wrote that &quot;Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession&quot; &quot;is an artful book&quot;, praising Malcolm’s &quot;keen eye for the surfaces — clothing, speech and furniture — that express character and social role&quot; (noting she was then the photography critic for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;). It succeeds because she has instructed herself so carefully in the technical literature. Above all, it succeeds because she has been able to engage Aaron Green in a simulacrum of the psychoanalytic encounter — he confessing to her, she (I suspect) to him, the two of them joined in an intricate minuet of revelation.&quot;

The book was a 1982 National Book Award for Nonfiction finalist.&lt;ref name=&quot;national-book/malcolm&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &quot;In the Freud Archives&quot; and the Masson case ===
Articles Malcolm published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and in her subsequent book &quot;In The Freud Archives&quot; (1984) offered, according to the book&#x27;s dust jacket, &quot;the narrative of an unlikely, tragic/comic encounter among three men.&quot; They were psychoanalyst Kurt R. Eissler, psychoanalyst Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, and independent Freud scholar Peter J. Swales. The book triggered a legal challenge by Masson, the former project director for the Sigmund Freud Archives. In his 1984 lawsuit, Masson claimed that Malcolm had libeled him by fabricating quotations she attributed to him.

In August 1989, United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco agreed with a lower court in dismissing a libel lawsuit that Masson had filed against Malcolm, The New Yorker and Alfred A. Knopf.&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo/1989/08/05/libel-suit-dis&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm claimed that Masson had called himself an &quot;intellectual gigolo&quot;. She also claimed that he said he wanted to turn the Freud estate into a haven of &quot;sex, women, and fun&quot; and claimed that he was, &quot;after Freud, the greatest analyst that ever lived.&quot; Malcolm was unable to produce all the disputed material on tape. The case was partially adjudicated before the Supreme Court, which held that the case could go forward for trial by jury. 

After a decade of proceedings, a jury finally decided in Malcolm&#x27;s favor on November 2, 1994 on the grounds that, whether or not the quotations were genuine, more evidence would be needed to rule against Malcolm.

In August 1995, Malcolm said that she had discovered a misplaced notebook containing three of the disputed quotes, swearing &quot;an affidavit under penalty of perjury that the notes were genuine.&quot;

=== &quot;The Journalist and the Murderer&quot; ===

Malcolm&#x27;s 1990 book &quot;The Journalist and the Murderer&quot; begins with the thesis: &quot;Every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible.&quot;

Her example was the popular nonfiction writer Joe McGinniss. While researching his true crime book &quot;Fatal Vision&quot;, McGinniss lived with the defense team of doctor Jeffrey MacDonald while MacDonald was on trial for the murders of his two daughters and pregnant wife. In Malcolm’s reporting, McGinniss quickly arrived at the conclusion that MacDonald was guilty, but feigned belief in his innocence to gain MacDonald’s trust and access to the story—ultimately being sued by MacDonald over the deception.

Malcolm&#x27;s book created a sensation when in March 1989 it appeared in two parts in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine. Roundly criticized upon first publication, the book is still controversial, although it has come to be regarded as a classic, routinely assigned to journalism students.&lt;ref name=&quot;cjr/2003/McCollum-Silent&quot;&gt;McCollum, Douglas, &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;, &quot;You Have The Right to Remain Silent&quot;, January, February 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; It ranks ninety-seventh in The Modern Library&#x27;s list of the twentieth century&#x27;s &quot;100 Best Works of Nonfiction&quot;. Douglas McCollum wrote in the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;, &quot;In the decade after Malcolm&#x27;s essay appeared, her once controversial theory became received wisdom.&quot;

=== Further books ===
In the posthumously published &quot;Still Pictures: On Photography and Memory,&quot; Malcolm writes autobiographical sketches, starting the chapters from family photographs.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/review/still-pictures&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

Malcolm&#x27;s penchant for controversial subjects and tendency to insert her views into the narrative brought her both admirers and critics. &quot;Leaning heavily on the techniques of psychoanalysis, she probes not only actions and reactions but motivations and intent; she pursues literary analysis like a crime drama and courtroom battles like novels,&quot; wrote Cara Parks in &quot;The New Republic&quot; in April 2013. Parks praised Malcolm&#x27;s &quot;intensely intellectual style&quot; as well as her &quot;sharpness and creativity.&quot;

In &quot;Esquire&quot;, Tom Junod characterized Malcolm as &quot;a self-hater whose work has managed to speak for the self-hatred (not to mention the class issues) of a profession that has designs on being &#x27;one of the professions&#x27; but never will be.&quot; Junod found her to be devoid of &quot;journalistic sympathy&quot; and observed: &quot;Very few journalists are more animated by malice than Janet Malcolm.” Junod himself, however, has been criticized for a number of journalistic duplicities, including a smirking piece in &quot;Esquire&quot; which outed the actor Kevin Spacey, as well as a similarly homophobic faux profile of the singer Michael Stipe.

Katie Roiphe summarized the tension between these polarized views, writing in 2011, &quot;Malcolm&#x27;s work, then, occupies that strange glittering territory between controversy and the establishment: she is both a grande dame of journalism, and still, somehow, its enfant terrible.&quot;

Charles Finch wrote in 2023 &quot;it seems safe to say that the two most important long-form journalists this country produced in the second half of the last century were Joan Didion and Janet Malcolm.&quot;

==Personal life==
Malcolm met her first husband, Donald Malcolm,&lt;ref name=&quot;salon/2000/malcolm&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of Michigan. After graduation, they moved to Washington, D.C., where Malcolm occasionally reviewed books for &quot;The New Republic&quot; before returning to New York. Donald reviewed books for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in the 1950s and 1960s and served as a theater critic. They had a daughter, Anne, in 1963. Donald Malcolm died in 1975.

Malcolm&#x27;s second husband was long-time &quot;New Yorker&quot; editor Gardner Botsford, a member of the family that had originally funded &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. The author of &quot;A Life of Privilege, Mostly: A Memoir&quot;, Botsford died at age 87 in September 2004.

==Death==
On June 16, 2021, Janet Malcolm died of lung cancer at the age of 86 at a Manhattan hospital.

<text>In graph theory and combinatorial optimization, Guan&#x27;s route problem, the Chinese postman problem, postman tour or route inspection problem is to find a shortest closed path or circuit that visits every edge of an (connected) undirected graph at least once. When the graph has an Eulerian circuit (a closed walk that covers every edge once), that circuit is an optimal solution. Otherwise, the optimization problem is to find the smallest number of graph edges to duplicate (or the subset of edges with the minimum possible total weight) so that the resulting multigraph does have an Eulerian circuit. It can be solved in polynomial time, unlike the Travelling Salesman Problem which is NP-hard. It is different from the Travelling Salesman Problem in that the travelling salesman cannot repeat visited nodes and does not have to visit every edge.

The problem was originally studied by the Chinese mathematician Meigu Guan in 1960, whose Chinese paper was translated into English in 1962. The original name &quot;Chinese postman problem&quot; was coined in his honor; different sources credit the coinage either to Alan J. Goldman or Jack Edmonds, both of whom were at the U.S. National Bureau of Standards at the time.

A generalization takes as input any set &quot;T&quot; of evenly many vertices, and must produce as output a minimum-weight edge set in the graph whose odd-degree vertices are precisely those of &quot;T&quot;. This output is called a &quot;T&quot;-join. This problem, the &quot;T&quot;-join problem, is also solvable in polynomial time by the same approach that solves the postman problem.

==Undirected solution and &quot;T&quot;-joins==
The undirected route inspection problem can be solved in polynomial time by an algorithm based on the concept of a &quot;T&quot;-join.
Let &quot;T&quot; be a set of vertices in a graph. An edge set &quot;J&quot; is called a &quot;T-join if the collection of vertices that have an odd number of incident edges in &quot;J&quot; is exactly the set &quot;T&quot;. A &quot;T&quot;-join exists whenever every connected component of the graph contains an even number of vertices in &quot;T&quot;. The &quot;T-join problem is to find a &quot;T&quot;-join with the minimum possible number of edges or the minimum possible total weight.
For any &quot;T&quot;, a smallest &quot;T&quot;-join (when it exists) necessarily consists of formula_1 paths that join the vertices of &quot;T&quot; in pairs. The paths will be such that the total length or total weight of all of them is as small as possible. In an optimal solution, no two of these paths will share any edge, but they may have shared vertices. A minimum &quot;T&quot;-join can be obtained by constructing a complete graph on the vertices of &quot;T&quot;, with edges that represent shortest paths in the given input graph, and then finding a minimum weight perfect matching in this complete graph. The edges of this matching represent paths in the original graph, whose union forms the desired &quot;T&quot;-join.
Both constructing the complete graph, and then finding a matching in it, can be done in O(&quot;n&quot;3) computational steps.

For the route inspection problem, &quot;T&quot; should be chosen as the set of all odd-degree vertices. By the assumptions of the problem, the whole graph is connected (otherwise no tour exists), and by the handshaking lemma it has an even number of odd vertices, so a &quot;T&quot;-join always exists. Doubling the edges of a &quot;T&quot;-join causes the given graph to become an Eulerian multigraph (a connected graph in which every vertex has even degree), from which it follows that it has an Euler tour, a tour that visits each edge of the multigraph exactly once. This tour will be an optimal solution to the route inspection problem.

==Directed solution==
On a directed graph, the same general ideas apply, but different techniques must be used. If the directed graph is Eulerian, one need only find an Euler cycle. If it is not, one must find &quot;T&quot;-joins, which in this case entails finding paths from vertices with an in-degree greater than their out-degree to those with an out-degree greater than their in-degree such that they would make in-degree of every vertex equal to its out-degree. This can be solved as an instance of the minimum-cost flow problem in which there is one unit of supply for every unit of excess in-degree, and one unit of demand for every unit of excess out-degree. As such it is solvable in O(|&quot;V&quot;|2|&quot;E&quot;|) time. A solution exists if and only if the given graph is strongly connected.

==Applications==
Various combinatorial problems have been reduced to the Chinese Postman Problem, including finding a maximum cut in a planar graph 
and a minimum-mean length circuit in an undirected graph.

==Variants==
A few variants of the Chinese Postman Problem have been studied and shown to be NP-complete.
*The windy postman problem is a variant of the route inspection problem in which the input is an undirected graph, but where each edge may have a different cost for traversing it in one direction than for traversing it in the other direction. In contrast to the solutions for directed and undirected graphs, it is NP-complete.
* The Mixed Chinese postman problem: for this problem, some of the edges may be directed and can therefore only be visited from one direction. When the problem calls for a minimal traversal of a digraph (or multidigraph) it is known as the &quot;New York Street Sweeper problem.&quot;
* The &quot;k&quot;-Chinese postman problem: find &quot;k&quot; cycles all starting at a designated location such that each edge is traversed by at least one cycle. The goal is to minimize the cost of the most expensive cycle.
* The &quot;Rural Postman Problem&quot;: solve the problem with some edges not required.

<text>The Rete algorithm ( , , rarely , ) is a pattern matching algorithm for implementing rule-based systems. The algorithm was developed to efficiently apply many rules or patterns to many objects, or facts, in a knowledge base. It is used to determine which of the system&#x27;s rules should fire based on its data store, its facts. The Rete algorithm was designed by Charles L. Forgy of Carnegie Mellon University, first published in a working paper in 1974, and later elaborated in his 1979 Ph.D. thesis and a 1982 paper.

==Overview==
A naive implementation of an expert system might check each rule against known facts in a knowledge base, firing that rule if necessary, then moving on to the next rule (and looping back to the first rule when finished). For even moderate sized rules and facts knowledge-bases, this naive approach performs far too slowly. The Rete algorithm provides the basis for a more efficient implementation. A Rete-based expert system builds a network of nodes, where each node (except the root) corresponds to a pattern occurring in the left-hand-side (the condition part) of a rule. The path from the root node to a leaf node defines a complete rule left-hand-side. Each node has a memory of facts that satisfy that pattern. This structure is essentially a generalized trie. As new facts are asserted or modified, they propagate along the network, causing nodes to be annotated when that fact matches that pattern. When a fact or combination of facts causes all of the patterns for a given rule to be satisfied, a leaf node is reached and the corresponding rule is triggered.

Rete was first used as the core engine of the OPS5 production system language, which was used to build early systems including R1 for Digital Equipment Corporation. Rete has become the basis for many popular rule engines and expert system shells, including CLIPS, Jess, Drools, IBM Operational Decision Management, BizTalk Rules Engine, Soar, and Evrete. The word &#x27;Rete&#x27; is Latin for &#x27;net&#x27; or &#x27;comb&#x27;. The same word is used in modern Italian to mean &#x27;network&#x27;. Charles Forgy has reportedly stated that he adopted the term &#x27;Rete&#x27; because of its use in anatomy to describe a network of blood vessels and nerve fibers.

The Rete algorithm is designed to sacrifice memory for increased speed. In most cases, the speed increase over naïve implementations is several orders of magnitude (because Rete performance is theoretically independent of the number of rules in the system). In very large expert systems, however, the original Rete algorithm tends to run into memory and server consumption problems. Other algorithms, both novel and Rete-based, have since been designed that require less memory (e.g. Rete* or Collection Oriented Match).

== Description ==
The Rete algorithm provides a generalized logical description of an implementation of functionality responsible for matching data tuples (&quot;facts&quot;) against productions (&quot;rules&quot;) in a pattern-matching production system (a category of rule engine). A production consists of one or more conditions and a set of actions that may be undertaken for each complete set of facts that match the conditions. Conditions test fact attributes, including fact type specifiers/identifiers. The Rete algorithm exhibits the following major characteristics:

* It reduces or eliminates certain types of redundancy through the use of node sharing.
* It stores partial matches when performing joins between different fact types. This, in turn, allows production systems to avoid complete re-evaluation of all facts each time changes are made to the production system&#x27;s working memory. Instead, the production system needs only to evaluate the changes (deltas) to working memory.
* It allows for efficient removal of memory elements when facts are retracted from working memory.
The Rete algorithm is widely used to implement matching functionality within pattern-matching engines that exploit a match-resolve-act cycle to support forward chaining and inferencing.
* It provides a means for many–many matching, an important feature when many or all possible solutions in a search network must be found.

Retes are directed acyclic graphs that represent higher-level rule sets. They are generally represented at run-time using a network of in-memory objects. These networks match rule conditions (patterns) to facts (relational data tuples). Rete networks act as a type of relational query processor, performing projections, selections and joins conditionally on arbitrary numbers of data tuples.

Productions (rules) are typically captured and defined by analysts and developers using some high-level rules language. They are collected into rule sets that are then translated, often at run time, into an executable Rete.

When facts are &quot;asserted&quot; to working memory, the engine creates &quot;working memory elements&quot; (WMEs) for each fact. Facts are tuples, and may therefore contain an arbitrary number of data items. Each WME may hold an entire tuple, or, alternatively, each fact may be represented by a set of WMEs where each WME contains a fixed-length tuple. In this case, tuples are typically triplets (3-tuples).

Each WME enters the Rete network at a single root node. The root node passes each WME on to its child nodes, and each WME may then be propagated through the network, possibly being stored in intermediate memories, until it arrives at a terminal node.

=== Alpha network ===
The &quot;left&quot; (&quot;alpha&quot;) side of the node graph forms a discrimination network responsible for selecting individual WMEs based on simple conditional tests that match WME attributes against constant values. Nodes in the discrimination network may also perform tests that compare two or more attributes of the same WME. If a WME is successfully matched against the conditions represented by one node, it is passed to the next node. In most engines, the immediate child nodes of the root node are used to test the entity identifier or fact type of each WME. Hence, all the WMEs that represent the same type typically traverse a given branch of nodes in the discrimination network.

Within the discrimination network, each branch of alpha nodes (also called 1-input nodes) terminates at a memory, called an &quot;alpha memory&quot;. These memories store collections of WMEs that match each condition in each node in a given node branch. WMEs that fail to match at least one condition in a branch are not materialised within the corresponding alpha memory. Alpha node branches may fork in order to minimise condition redundancy.

=== Beta network ===
The &quot;right&quot; (&quot;beta&quot;) side of the graph chiefly performs joins between different WMEs. It is optional, and is only included if required. It consists of 2-input nodes where each node has a &quot;left&quot; and a &quot;right&quot; input. Each beta node sends its output to a &quot;beta memory&quot;.

In descriptions of Rete, it is common to refer to token passing within the beta network. In this article, however, we will describe data propagation in terms of WME lists, rather than tokens, in recognition of different implementation options and the underlying purpose and use of tokens. As any one WME list passes through the beta network, new WMEs may be added to it, and the list may be stored in beta memories. A WME list in a beta memory represents a partial match for the conditions in a given production.

WME lists that reach the end of a branch of beta nodes represent a complete match for a single production, and are passed to terminal nodes. These nodes are sometimes called &quot;p-nodes&quot;, where &quot;p&quot; stands for &quot;production&quot;. Each terminal node represents a single production, and each WME list that arrives at a terminal node represents a complete set of matching WMEs for the conditions in that production. For each WME list it receives, a production node will &quot;activate&quot; a new production instance on the &quot;agenda&quot;. Agendas are typically implemented as prioritised queues.

Beta nodes typically perform joins between WME lists stored in beta memories and individual WMEs stored in alpha memories. Each beta node is associated with two input memories. An alpha memory holds WM and performs &quot;right&quot; activations on the beta node each time it stores a new WME. A beta memory holds WME lists and performs &quot;left&quot; activations on the beta node each time it stores a new WME list. When a join node is right-activated, it compares one or more attributes of the newly stored WME from its input alpha memory against given attributes of specific WMEs in each WME list contained in the input beta memory. When a join node is left-activated it traverses a single newly stored WME list in the beta memory, retrieving specific attribute values of given WMEs. It compares these values with attribute values of each WME in the alpha memory.

Each beta node outputs WME lists that are either stored in a beta memory or sent directly to a terminal node. WME lists are stored in beta memories whenever the engine will perform additional left activations on subsequent beta nodes.

Logically, a beta node at the head of a branch of beta nodes is a special case because it takes no input from any beta memory higher in the network. Different engines handle this issue in different ways. Some engines use specialised adapter nodes to connect alpha memories to the left input of beta nodes. Other engines allow beta nodes to take input directly from two alpha memories, treating one as a &quot;left&quot; input and the other as a &quot;right&quot; input. In both cases, &quot;head&quot; beta nodes take their input from two alpha memories.

In order to eliminate node redundancies, any one alpha or beta memory may be used to perform activations on multiple beta nodes. As well as join nodes, the beta network may contain additional node types, some of which are described below. If a Rete contains no beta network, alpha nodes feed tokens, each containing a single WME, directly to p-nodes. In this case, there may be no need to store WMEs in alpha memories.

=== Conflict resolution ===
During any one match-resolve-act cycle, the engine will find all possible matches for the facts currently asserted to working memory. Once all the current matches have been found, and corresponding production instances have been activated on the agenda, the engine determines an order in which the production instances may be &quot;fired&quot;. This is termed &quot;conflict resolution&quot;, and the list of activated production instances is termed the &quot;conflict set&quot;. The order may be based on rule priority (&quot;salience&quot;), rule order, the time at which facts contained in each instance were asserted to the working memory, the complexity of each production, or some other criteria. Many engines allow rule developers to select between different conflict resolution strategies or to chain a selection of multiple strategies.

Conflict resolution is not defined as part of the Rete algorithm, but is used alongside the algorithm. Some specialised production systems do not perform conflict resolution.

=== Production execution===
Having performed conflict resolution, the engine now &quot;fires&quot; the first production instance, executing a list of actions associated with the production. The actions act on the data represented by the production instance&#x27;s WME list.

By default, the engine will continue to fire each production instance in order until all production instances have been fired. Each production instance will fire only once, at most, during any one match-resolve-act cycle. This characteristic is termed &quot;refraction&quot;. However, the sequence of production instance firings may be interrupted at any stage by performing changes to the working memory. Rule actions can contain instructions to assert or retract WMEs from the working memory of the engine. Each time any single production instance performs one or more such changes, the engine immediately enters a new match-resolve-act cycle. This includes &quot;updates&quot; to WMEs currently in the working memory. Updates are represented by retracting and then re-asserting the WME. The engine undertakes matching of the changed data which, in turn, may result in changes to the list of production instances on the agenda. Hence, after the actions for any one specific production instance have been executed, previously activated instances may have been de-activated and removed from the agenda, and new instances may have been activated.

As part of the new match-resolve-act cycle, the engine performs conflict resolution on the agenda and then executes the current first instance. The engine continues to fire production instances, and to enter new match-resolve-act cycles, until no further production instances exist on the agenda. At this point the rule engine is deemed to have completed its work, and halts.

Some engines support advanced refraction strategies in which certain production instances executed in a previous cycle are not re-executed in the new cycle, even though they may still exist on the agenda.

It is possible for the engine to enter into never-ending loops in which the agenda never reaches the empty state. For this reason, most engines support explicit &quot;halt&quot; verbs that can be invoked from production action lists. They may also provide automatic loop detection in which never-ending loops are automatically halted after a given number of iterations. Some engines support a model in which, instead of halting when the agenda is empty, the engine enters a wait state until new facts are asserted externally.

As for conflict resolution, the firing of activated production instances is not a feature of the Rete algorithm. However, it is a central feature of engines that use Rete networks. Some of the optimisations offered by Rete networks are only useful in scenarios where the engine performs multiple match-resolve-act cycles.

=== Existential and universal quantifications ===
Conditional tests are most commonly used to perform selections and joins on individual tuples. However, by implementing additional beta node types, it is possible for Rete networks to perform quantifications. Existential quantification involves testing for the existence of at least one set of matching WMEs in working memory. Universal quantification involves testing that an entire set of WMEs in working memory meets a given condition. A variation of universal quantification might test that a given number of WMEs, drawn from a set of WMEs, meets given criteria. This might be in terms of testing for either an exact number or a minimum number of matches.

Quantification is not universally implemented in Rete engines, and, where it is supported, several variations exist. A variant of existential quantification referred to as &quot;negation&quot; is widely, though not universally, supported, and is described in seminal documents. Existentially negated conditions and conjunctions involve the use of specialised beta nodes that test for non-existence of matching WMEs or sets of WMEs. These nodes propagate WME lists only when no match is found. The exact implementation of negation varies. In one approach, the node maintains a simple count on each WME list it receives from its left input. The count specifies the number of matches found with WMEs received from the right input. The node only propagates WME lists whose count is zero. In another approach, the node maintains an additional memory on each WME list received from the left input. These memories are a form of beta memory, and store WME lists for each match with WMEs received on the right input. If a WME list does not have any WME lists in its memory, it is propagated down the network. In this approach, negation nodes generally activate further beta nodes directly, rather than storing their output in an additional beta memory. Negation nodes provide a form of &#x27;negation as failure&#x27;.

When changes are made to working memory, a WME list that previously matched no WMEs may now match newly asserted WMEs. In this case, the propagated WME list and all its extended copies need to be retracted from beta memories further down the network. The second approach described above is often used to support efficient mechanisms for removal of WME lists. When WME lists are removed, any corresponding production instances are de-activated and removed from the agenda.

Existential quantification can be performed by combining two negation beta nodes. This represents the semantics of double negation (e.g., &quot;If NOT NOT any matching WMEs, then...&quot;). This is a common approach taken by several production systems.

=== Memory indexing ===
The Rete algorithm does not mandate any specific approach to indexing the working memory. However, most modern production systems provide indexing mechanisms. In some cases, only beta memories are indexed, whilst in others, indexing is used for both alpha and beta memories. A good indexing strategy is a major factor in deciding the overall performance of a production system, especially when executing rule sets that result in highly combinatorial pattern matching (i.e., intensive use of beta join nodes), or, for some engines, when executing rules sets that perform a significant number of WME retractions during multiple match-resolve-act cycles. Memories are often implemented using combinations of hash tables, and hash values are used to perform conditional joins on subsets of WME lists and WMEs, rather than on the entire contents of memories. This, in turn, often significantly reduces the number of evaluations performed by the Rete network.

=== Removal of WMEs and WME lists ===
When a WME is retracted from working memory, it must be removed from every alpha memory in which it is stored. In addition, WME lists that contain the WME must be removed from beta memories, and activated production instances for these WME lists must be de-activated and removed from the agenda. Several implementation variations exist, including tree-based and rematch-based removal. Memory indexing may be used in some cases to optimise removal.

=== Handling ORed conditions ===
When defining productions in a rule set, it is common to allow conditions to be grouped using an OR connective. In many production systems, this is handled by interpreting a single production containing multiple ORed patterns as the equivalent of multiple productions. The resulting Rete network contains sets of terminal nodes which, together, represent single productions. This approach disallows any form of short-circuiting of the ORed conditions. It can also, in some cases, lead to duplicate production instances being activated on the agenda where the same set of WMEs match multiple internal productions. Some engines provide agenda de-duplication in order to handle this issue.

=== Diagram ===
The following diagram illustrates the basic Rete topology, and shows the associations between different node types and memories.

* Most implementations use type nodes to perform the first level of selection on tuple working memory elements. Type nodes can be considered as specialized select nodes. They discriminate between different tuple relation types.
* The diagram does not illustrate the use of specialized nodes types such as negated conjunction nodes. Some engines implement several different node specialisations in order to extend functionality and maximise optimisation.
* The diagram provides a logical view of the Rete. Implementations may differ in physical detail. In particular, the diagram shows dummy inputs providing right activations at the head of beta node branches. Engines may implement other approaches, such as adapters that allow alpha memories to perform right activations directly.
* The diagram does not illustrate all node-sharing possibilities.

For a more detailed and complete description of the Rete algorithm, see chapter 2 of Production Matching for Large Learning Systems by Robert Doorenbos (see link below).

== Alternatives ==

=== Alpha Network ===

A possible variation is to introduce additional memories for each intermediate node in the discrimination network. This increases the overhead of the Rete, but may have advantages in situations where rules are dynamically added to or removed from the Rete, making it easier to vary the topology of the discrimination network dynamically.

An alternative implementation is described by Doorenbos. In this case, the discrimination network is replaced by a set of memories and an index. The index may be implemented using a hash table. Each memory holds WMEs that match a single conditional pattern, and the index is used to reference memories by their pattern. This approach is only practical when WMEs represent fixed-length tuples, and the length of each tuple is short (e.g., 3-tuples). In addition, the approach only applies to conditional patterns that perform equality tests against constant values. When a WME enters the Rete, the index is used to locate a set of memories whose conditional pattern matches the WME attributes, and the WME is then added directly to each of these memories. In itself, this implementation contains no 1-input nodes. However, in order to implement non-equality tests, the Rete may contain additional 1-input node networks through which WMEs are passed before being placed in a memory. Alternatively, non-equality tests may be performed in the beta network described below.

=== Beta Network ===

A common variation is to build linked lists of tokens where each token holds a single WME. In this case, lists of WMEs for a partial match are represented by the linked list of tokens. This approach may be better because it eliminates the need to copy lists of WMEs from one token to another. Instead, a beta node needs only to create a new token to hold a WME it wishes to join to the partial match list, and then link the new token to a parent token stored in the input beta memory. The new token now forms the head of the token list, and is stored in the output beta memory.

Beta nodes process tokens. A token is a unit of storage within a memory and also a unit of exchange between memories and nodes. In many implementations, tokens are introduced within alpha memories where they are used to hold single WMEs. These tokens are then passed to the beta network.

Each beta node performs its work and, as a result, may create new tokens to hold a list of WMEs representing a partial match. These extended tokens are then stored in beta memories, and passed to subsequent beta nodes. In this case, the beta nodes typically pass lists of WMEs through the beta network by copying existing WME lists from each received token into new tokens and then adding further WMEs to the lists as a result of performing a join or some other action. The new tokens are then stored in the output memory.

== Miscellaneous considerations ==
Although not defined by the Rete algorithm, some engines provide extended functionality to support greater control of truth maintenance. For example, when a match is found for one production, this may result in the assertion of new WMEs which, in turn, match the conditions for another production. If a subsequent change to working memory causes the first match to become invalid, it may be that this implies that the second match is also invalid. The Rete algorithm does not define any mechanism to define and handle these logical truth dependencies automatically. Some engines, however, support additional functionality in which truth dependencies can be automatically maintained. In this case, the retraction of one WME may lead to the automatic retraction of additional WMEs in order to maintain logical truth assertions.

The Rete algorithm does not define any approach to justification. Justification refers to mechanisms commonly required in expert and decision systems in which, at its simplest, the system reports each of the inner decisions used to reach some final conclusion. For example, an expert system might justify a conclusion that an animal is an elephant by reporting that it is large, grey, has big ears, a trunk and tusks. Some engines provide built-in justification systems in conjunction with their implementation of the Rete algorithm.

This article does not provide an exhaustive description of every possible variation or extension of the Rete algorithm. Other considerations and innovations exist. For example, engines may provide specialised support within the Rete network in order to apply pattern-matching rule processing to specific data types and sources such as programmatic objects, XML data or relational data tables. Another example concerns additional time-stamping facilities provided by many engines for each WME entering a Rete network, and the use of these time-stamps in conjunction with conflict resolution strategies. Engines exhibit significant variation in the way they allow programmatic access to the engine and its working memory, and may extend the basic Rete model to support forms of parallel and distributed processing.

== Optimization and performance ==
Several optimizations for Rete have been identified and described in academic literature. Several of these, however, apply only in very specific scenarios, and therefore often have little or no application in a general-purpose rules engine. In addition, alternative algorithms such as TREAT, developed by Daniel P. Miranker LEAPS, and Design Time Inferencing (DeTI) have been formulated that may provide additional performance improvements.

The Rete algorithm is suited to scenarios where forward chaining and &quot;inferencing&quot; is used to calculate new facts from existing facts, or to filter and discard facts in order to arrive at some conclusion. It is also exploited as a reasonably efficient mechanism for performing highly combinatorial evaluations of facts where large numbers of joins must be performed between fact tuples. Other approaches to performing rule evaluation, such as the use of decision trees, or the implementation of sequential engines, may be more appropriate for simple scenarios, and should be considered as possible alternatives.

Performance of Rete is also largely a matter of implementation choices (independent of the network topology), one of which (the use of hash tables) leads to major improvements.
Most of the performance benchmarks and comparisons available on the web are biased in some way or another. To mention only a frequent bias and an unfair type of comparison:
1) the use of toy problems such as the Manners and Waltz examples; such examples are useful to estimate specific properties of the implementation, but they may not reflect real performance on complex applications;
2) the use of an old implementation; for instance, the references in the following two sections (Rete II and Rete-NT) compare some commercial products to totally outdated versions of CLIPS and they claim that the commercial products may be orders of magnitude faster than CLIPS; this is forgetting that CLIPS 6.30 (with the introduction of hash tables as in Rete II) is orders of magnitude faster than the version used for the comparisons (CLIPS 6.04).

==Variants==
===Rete II===
In the 1980s, Charles Forgy developed a successor to the Rete algorithm named Rete II. Unlike the original Rete (which is public domain) this algorithm was not disclosed. Rete II claims better performance for more complex problems (even orders of magnitude), and is officially implemented in CLIPS/R2, a C/++ implementation and in OPSJ, a Java implementation in 1998. Rete II gives about a 100 to 1 order of magnitude performance improvement in more complex problems as shown by KnowledgeBased Systems Corporation benchmarks.

Rete II can be characterized by two areas of improvement; specific optimizations relating to the general performance of the Rete network (including the use of hashed memories in order to increase performance with larger sets of data), and the inclusion of a backward chaining algorithm tailored to run on top of the Rete network. Backward chaining alone can account for the most extreme changes in benchmarks relating to Rete vs. Rete II. Rete II is implemented in the commercial product Advisor from FICO, formerly called Fair Isaac 

Jess (at least versions 5.0 and later) also adds a commercial backward chaining algorithm on top of the Rete network, but it cannot be said to fully implement Rete II, in part due to the fact that no full specification is publicly available.

===Rete-III===
In the early 2000s, the Rete III engine was developed by Charles Forgy in cooperation with FICO engineers. The Rete III algorithm, which is not Rete-NT, is the FICO trademark for Rete II and is implemented as part of the FICO Advisor engine. It is basically the Rete II engine with an API that allows access to the Advisor engine because the Advisor engine can access other FICO products.

===Rete-NT===
In 2010, Forgy developed a new generation of the Rete algorithm. In an InfoWorld benchmark, the algorithm was deemed 500 times faster than the original Rete algorithm and 10 times faster than its predecessor, Rete II. This algorithm is now licensed to Sparkling Logic, the company that Forgy joined as investor and strategic advisor, as the inference engine of the SMARTS product.

===Rete-OO===
Considering that Rete aims to support first-order logic (basically if-then-else statements), Rete-OO aims to provide a rule-based system that supports uncertainty (where the information to make a decision is missing or is inaccurate). According to the author&#x27;s proposal, the rule &quot;&quot;if Danger then Alarm&quot; would be improved to something such as &quot;given the probability of Danger, there will be a certain probability of hearing an Alarm&quot; or even &quot;the greater the Danger, the louder should be Alarm&quot;&quot;. For this it extends the Drools language (which already implements the Rete algorithm) to make it support probabilistic logic, like fuzzy logic and Bayesian networks.

<doc id="172568" wikidata="Q3031685" url="?curid=172568" title="William Emerson (mathematician)">
<text>William Emerson (14 May 1701 – 20 May 1782) was an English mathematician. He was born in Hurworth, near Darlington, where his father, Dudley Emerson, also a mathematician, taught a school.

== Biography ==

William himself had a small estate in Weardale called Castle Gate situated not far from Eastgate where he would repair to work throughout the summer on projects as disparate as stonemasonry and watchmaking.
Unsuccessful as a teacher, he devoted himself entirely to studious retirement. Possessed of remarkable energy and forthrightness of speech, Emerson published many works which are singularly free from errata.

In &quot;The Principles of Mechanics&quot; (1754) he shows a wind-powered vehicle in which the vertically mounted propeller gives direct power to the front wheels via a system of cogs. In mechanics he never advanced a proposition which he had not previously tested in practice, nor published an invention without first proving its effects by a model. He was skilled in the science of music, the theory of sounds, and the ancient and modern scales; but he never attained any excellence as a performer. He died on 20 May 1782 at his native village, where his gravestone bears epitaphs in Latin and Hebrew.

Emerson dressed in old clothes and his manners were uncouth. He wore his shirt back to front and his legs wrapped in sacking so as not to scorch them as he sat over the fire. He declined an offer to become FRS because it would cost too much after all the expense of farthing candles he had been put to in the course of his life of study. Emerson rode regularly into Darlington on a horse like Don Quixote&#x27;s, led by a hired small boy. In old age, plagued by the stone, he would alternately pray and curse, wishing his soul &#x27;could shake off the rags of mortality without such a clitter-me-clatter.&#x27;

Like his fellow County Durham savant John Bird, Emerson makes an appearance in &quot;Mason and Dixon&quot; by Thomas Pynchon.

== Works ==

Emerson&#x27;s works include:

* &quot;The Doctrine of Fluxions&quot; (1748); 3rd edition (1768)
* &quot;The Projection of the Sphere, Orthographic, Stereographic and Gnomical&quot; (1749)
* &quot;The Elements of Trigonometry&quot; (1749); 3rd edition (1788)
* &quot;The Principles of Mechanics&quot; (1754); 3rd edition (1773)
* &quot;A Treatise of Navigation&quot; (1755)
* &quot;A Treatise of Algebra&quot;, in two books (1764)
* &quot;The Arithmetic of Infinites, and the Differential Method, illustrated by Examples&quot; (1767)
* &quot;Mechanics, or the Doctrine of Motion&quot; (1769)
* &quot;The Elements of Optics&quot;, in four books (1768)
* &quot;A System of Astronomy&quot; (1769)
* &quot;The Laws of Centripetal and Centrifugal Force&quot; (1769)
* &quot;The Mathematical Principles of Geography&quot; (1770)
* &quot;Tracts&quot; (1770)
* &quot;Cyclomathesis, or an Easy Introduction to the several branches of the Mathematics&quot; (1770), in ten volumes
* &quot;A Short Comment on Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s Principia; to which is added, A Defence of Sir Isaac against the objections that have been made to several parts of his works&quot; (1770)
* &quot;A Miscellaneous Treatise containing several Mathematical Subjects&quot; (1776).
It is notable to remark that in &quot;The Doctrine of Proportionality&quot; Emerson was first to introduce ∝ as the symbol for proportionality.

<doc id="172576" wikidata="Q7728624" url="?curid=172576" title="The Daily Californian">
<text>The Daily Californian (Daily Cal) is an independent, student-run newspaper that serves the University of California, Berkeley, campus and its surrounding community.

==History==
===20th century===

&quot;The Daily Californian&quot; became independent from UC Berkeley in 1971 after the campus administration fired three senior editors over an editorial that encouraged readers to &quot;take back&quot; People&#x27;s Park. Both sides came to an agreement, and &quot;The Daily Californian&quot; gained financial and editorial independence from the university and is now published by an independent corporation called the Independent Berkeley Students Publishing Company, Inc. The paper licenses its name from the Regents of the University of California.

On November 24, 1982, three days after the November 20th Big Game (now known for The Play), early morning readers of the &quot;Daily Cal&quot; were chagrined to find in the headline of the front page: &quot;NCAA Awards Big Game to Stanford.&quot; Hundreds of copies of the &quot;Daily Cal&quot; with this fake headline had been strewn about campus in the wee hours. This was in fact a hoax perpetrated by aggrieved Stanford fans.

&quot;The Daily Californian&quot; has a history of publishing spirited editorials, and in some cases, editions containing controversial editorials have been subjected to newspaper theft. In 2002, Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates agreed to pay restitution after admitting to having thrown away a thousand copies of &quot;The Daily Californian&quot; after it endorsed his opponent, then-Mayor Shirley Dean. In May 2003, nearly 5,000 papers were stolen by students protesting coverage of the arrest of a Cal football player. The largest act of theft took place in November 1996 when the paper&#x27;s senior editorial board endorsed Proposition 209. Nearly 23,000 papers were stolen on Election Day 1996, and in the following days, copies of the paper were tossed off the balcony of the newspaper&#x27;s office and burned in effigy.

As a way to repair relations with campus community members angered by the publication of the editorial endorsing Proposition 209, editors at the Daily Cal established the nation&#x27;s first regular college newspaper sex column. The column, now known colloquially as &quot;Sex on Tuesday&quot;, led to college papers across the country to create similar sex columns.

===21st century===
On October 16, 2006, the &quot;Daily Cal&quot; launched its first blog, The Daily Clog, a student-life blog that accumulates various tidbits about Berkeley and college life.

On August 25, 2008, the &quot;Daily Cal&quot; announced that it would no longer print a paper version of the newspaper on Wednesdays amidst a decline in advertising revenues and higher newspaper costs.

== The Daily Californian Alumni Association ==
Many former &quot;Daily Cal&quot; staffers have joined The Daily Californian Alumni Association (DCAA) since its resurrection in August 1996. A unit of The Daily Californian Education Foundation, the DCAA provides mentorship and financial support to the current student staff.

Membership is open to all former staff members of &quot;The Daily Californian&quot; or student publications office staff (pre 1971). Reunions are held every October during homecoming weekend on the Berkeley campus.

<doc id="172577" wikidata="Q1354617" url="?curid=172577" title="Kangaroo Jack">
<text>Kangaroo Jack is a 2003 buddy action comedy film directed by David McNally from a screenplay by Steve Bing and Scott Rosenberg with a story by Bing and Barry O&#x27;Brien. It is also produced by Jerry Bruckheimer with music by Trevor Rabin. The film tells the story of two childhood friends who get caught up with the mob and are forced to deliver $50,000 to Australia, but things go haywire when the money is lost to a wild kangaroo. It stars Jerry O&#x27;Connell, Anthony Anderson, Estella Warren, Michael Shannon, and Christopher Walken, with Adam Garcia as the uncredited voice of the titular character.

Originally conceived as an R-rated mob comedy entitled &quot;Down and Under&quot;, negative test screenings led Bruckheimer to retool the film into a PG-rated film, heavily re-editing the film and adding scenes of an anthropomorphic kangaroo.

&quot;Kangaroo Jack&quot; was released in the United States on January 17, 2003, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film was strongly panned by critics, who criticized the screenplay, humor, violence, and innuendoes, as well as its false advertising as a family film with the kangaroo in a significant speaking role, although the visuals and soundtrack were praised. It grossed $88.1 million worldwide on a $60 million budget.

An animated sequel titled &quot;Kangaroo Jack: G&#x27;Day U.S.A.!&quot; was produced and released direct-to-video in 2004.

== Plot ==
In 1982 Brooklyn, a boy named Charlie Carbone is about to become the stepson of crime boss Salvatore Maggio. The mobster&#x27;s apprentice Frankie Lombardo tries to drown Charlie, but a boy named Louis Booker saves him, and they become best friends.

Twenty years later, Charlie operates a beauty salon set up by Sal, whose henchmen take 80% of the profits, barely leaving Charlie enough money for maintenance. After they botch hiding some stolen televisions, which leads to the discovery of Sal&#x27;s warehouse by the police, Sal gives Charlie and Louis one more chance. Under instructions from Frankie, they are to deliver a package to a man named Mr. Smith in Coober Pedy, Australia. Frankie also warns them against opening the package, and provides them with Mr. Smith&#x27;s number. Unknown to the duo, Sal has cancelled their return trip. Louis opens the package on the plane and finds $50,000 cash.

Arriving in Australia, Charlie and Louis drive to Coober Pedy. Along their way, they accidentally run over a red kangaroo. Louis thinks it is dead and puts his jacket and sunglasses on the kangaroo, posing for photographs as a joke. The kangaroo suddenly regains consciousness, kicks Charlie, and hops away with the $50,000 in the jacket. Charlie and Louis give chase but crash their rental car, and the kangaroo escapes.

At a pub in Alice Springs, Louis calls Mr. Smith, who thinks he and Charlie stole his package and threatens to kill them. Back in New York, Sal gets a call from Smith complaining that Charlie and Louis have not arrived, then sends Frankie and some henchmen to Australia to investigate. Meanwhile, Charlie and Louis attempt to reclaim the money from the kangaroo by shooting it with a tranquilizer from a plane. The attempt fails when Louis accidentally shoots Blue, the pilot, causing the plane to crash and strands the duo in the desert. They spend hours wandering in the desert, during which the duo encounter a pack of dingoes and a dust storm, and Charlie hallucinates finding a jeep, and they soon meet Jessie, an American woman from the Outback Wildlife Foundation. Charlie, thinking she is a mirage, grabs her breasts and she knocks him out. Charlie then has a nightmare with a speaking version of the kangaroo, plus two other kangaroos possessing Sal and Louis&#x27;s voices, who taunt him by calling him &quot;Chicken Blood&quot; repeatedly.

The following day, the three track the kangaroo to the Todd River, attempting to catch it with bolas, but Louis accidentally botches their attempt when ants crawl up his pants. While waiting for the next opportunity to catch the kangaroo, Charlie begins developing feelings for Jessie. At the crack of dawn the following day, Smith and his henchmen shortly arrive, after following their camel tracks, and capture the trio. Charlie and Louis outsmart them, but find Frankie has tracked them down and is prepared to kill them. The kangaroo suddenly returns, causing a fist fight between Smith&#x27;s henchmen and Frankie&#x27;s crew, who outmatch them. The distraction allows Charlie, Louis and Jessie to escape. The duo chases after the kangaroo while being pursued by Frankie and his goons. Louis finally retrieves the money from the kangaroo, and Charlie narrowly saves him from falling off a cliff. Charlie tries to hand the money to Frankie, who angrily declines and reveals that Sal sent them to Australia to pay for their own execution at the hands of Smith. As he is about to shoot Charlie, the Australian Federal Police force, led by a cop working undercover as an Outback guide, arrives and arrests Frankie, Smith, and their henchmen. Charlie reclaims Louis&#x27; jacket from the kangaroo.

One year later, Charlie and Jessie are married and have used Sal&#x27;s $50,000 to start a line of new hair care products bearing a kangaroo logo, along with Louis. Frankie and his goons have been imprisoned for life while Sal tried using his high level connections to avoid going to prison while awaiting trail. The kangaroo, now called &quot;Kangaroo Jack&quot;, continues to live happily in the Outback. Now able to speak again, Jack breaks the fourth wall, explaining why the film should end with him and closing it with his version of Porky Pig&#x27;s famous catchphrase: &quot;That&#x27;s all, blokes!&quot;

== Production ==
Initially &quot;Kangaroo Jack&quot; was titled &quot;Down and Under&quot; and was shot as a mob comedy in the style of &quot;Midnight Run&quot;. The film was initially set up at the Disney label Hollywood Pictures, but Disney placed it into turnaround and instead the film was set up at Castle Rock Entertainment. The film began shooting in Australia in August 2001, lasting about six months in total, and originally included profanity, sex, and violence, intended to be released with an R-rating. According to actor Jerry O&#x27;Connell, he filmed a full-frontal nude scene for the film. However, the film&#x27;s producers were dissatisfied by the first rough cut. 

Inspired by positive response to the kangaroo scene in early test screenings, as well as the marketing campaign behind the recently released &quot;Snow Dogs&quot;, the production shifted the marketing focus away from that of a dark mafia comedy to that of a family-friendly animal picture. Extensive new footage that replaced the animatronic kangaroo with a new CGI one that rapped (voiced by an uncredited Adam Garcia) was shot, and the film was edited down to a PG-rated family animal comedy. Among the changes, repeated utterances of &quot;chickenshit&quot; were redubbed with &quot;chicken blood&quot;.

Rotten Tomatoes reported that 9% of 115 critics gave &quot;Kangaroo Jack&quot; positive reviews, with an average rating of 3.4/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;The humor is gratingly dumb, and &quot;Kangaroo Jack&quot; contains too much violence and sexual innuendo for a family movie.&quot; On Metacritic it holds a weighted average score of 16 out of 100 based 25 critics, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Joe McGovern in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; described &quot;Kangaroo Jack&quot; as &quot;witless&quot; and stated &quot;The colorless script...seems to have written itself from a patchwork of Wile E. Coyote cartoons, camel farts, and every high-pitched Aussie cliché to have echoed on these shores&quot;. Nathan Rabin, reviewing the film for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, criticized the false advertising that the kangaroo would have a major role in the story and speak throughout, remarking, &quot;&quot;Kangaroo Jack&quot;″s premise, trailer, and commercials promise little more than the spectacle of two enthusiastic actors being kicked over and over again by a sassy, computer-animated kangaroo—and, sadly, the film fails to deliver even that.&quot; Gary Slaymaker in the British newspaper &quot;The Western Mail&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;Kangaroo Jack&quot; is the most witless, pointless, charmless drivel unleashed on an unsuspecting public&quot;.

For their performances, Anthony Anderson and Christopher Walken were both nominated for Worst Supporting Actor at the 24th Golden Raspberry Awards, but they lost to Sylvester Stallone for &quot;Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over&quot;. The Australian

<text>Sorrento ( , ; ; ) is a town overlooking the Bay of Naples in Southern Italy. A popular tourist destination, Sorrento is located on the Sorrentine Peninsula at the southern terminus of a main branch of the Circumvesuviana rail network, within easy access from Naples and Pompei. The town is widely known for its small ceramics, lacework and marquetry (woodwork) shops.

The Sorrentine Peninsula has views of Naples, Vesuvius and the Isle of Capri. The Amalfi Drive, connecting Sorrento and Amalfi, is a narrow road along the high cliffs above the Tyrrhenian Sea.

Ferries and hydrofoils connect the town to Naples, Amalfi, Positano, Capri and Ischia.

Limoncello, a digestif made from lemon rinds, alcohol, water and sugar, is produced in Sorrento along with citrus fruit, wine, nuts and olives.

==History==

===Origins===
The Roman name for Sorrento was . From the 8th century BC the area had the presence of a community of indigenous villages, which was a crossing point for Etruscan traffic. Subsequently, the area fell into the hands of the Osci, who exercised an important influence there, in fact the oldest ruins of Surrentum are Oscan, dating from about 600 BC.

Before its control by the Roman Republic, Surrentum was one of the towns subject to Nuceria, and shared its fortunes up to the Social War; it seems to have joined in the revolt of 90 BC like Stabiae; and was reduced to obedience in the following year, when it seems to have received a colony.

Numerous sepulchral inscriptions of Imperial slaves and freedmen have been found at Surrentum. An inscription shows that Titus in the year after the earthquake of 79 AD restored the horologium (clock) of the town and its architectural decoration. A similar restoration of an unknown building in Naples in the same year is recorded in an inscription from the last-named town.

The most important temples of Surrentum were those of Athena and of the Sirens (the latter the only one in the Greek world in historic times); the former gave its name to the promontory. In antiquity, Surrentum was famous for its wine (oranges and lemons which are now widely cultivated there were not yet introduced in Italy in antiquity), its fish, and its red Campanian vases; the discovery of coins of Massilia, Gaul, and the Balearic Islands here indicates the extensive trade which it carried on.

The position of Surrentum was very secure, protected by deep gorges. The only exception to its natural protection was on the south-west where it was defended by walls, the line of which is necessarily followed by those of the modern town. The arrangement of the modern streets preserves that of the ancient town, and the disposition of the walled paths which divide the plain to the east seems to date in like manner from Roman times. No ruins are now preserved in the town itself, but there are many remains in the villa quarter to the east of the town on the road to Stabiae, of which traces still exist, running much higher than the modern road, across the mountain.

The site of one of the largest (possibly belonging to the Imperial house) is now occupied by the Hotel Vittoria, under the terrace of which a small theatre was found in 1855; an ancient rock-cut tunnel descends hence to the shore. Remains of other villas may be seen, but the most important ruin is the reservoir of the (subterranean) aqueducts just outside the town on the east, which had no less than twenty-seven chambers each about . Greek and Oscan tombs have also been found.

Another suburb lay below the town and on the promontory on the west of it; under the Hotel Bellevue Syrene are substructions and a rock-hewn tunnel. To the north-west on the Capo di Sorrento is another villa, the so-called Bagni della Regina Giovanna, with baths, and in the bay to the south-west was the villa of Pollius Felix, the friend of Statius, which he describes in &quot;Silvae&quot; ii. 2, of which remains still exist. Farther west again are villas, as far as the temple of Athena on the promontory named after her at the extremity of the peninsula (now Punta Campanella). Neither of this nor of the famous temple of the Sirens are any traces existing.

In the mythology, according to the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus, Sorrento was founded by Liparus, son of Ausonus, who was king of the Ausoni and the son of Ulysses and Circe. The ancient city was probably connected to the Ausoni tribe, one of the most ancient ethnic groups in the area. In the pre-Roman age, Sorrento was influenced by the Greek civilization: this can be seen in its plant and in the presence of the &quot;Athenaion&quot;, a great sanctuary, also, according to the legend, founded by Ulysses and originally devoted to the cult of the Sirens, hence Sorrento&#x27;s name.

===Middle Ages and modern era===
Sorrento became an archbishopric around 420 AD. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, it was ruled by the Ostrogoths and then returned to the Eastern Empire. The Lombards, who conquered much of southern Italy in the second half of the 6th century, besieged it in vain.

In the following centuries the authority of the distant Empire of Byzantium faded; initially part of the substantially independent Duchy of Naples, later Sorrento became in turn an autonomous duchy in the 9th century. It fought against neighbouring/rival Amalfi, the Saracens and the nearby Lombardic duchies, such as that of Duchy of Benevento, whose forces besieged it in 839, although Sorrento was able to resist with Neapolitan help. Sorrentine forces took part in the anti-Saracen leagues at the battles of Licosa (846) and Ostia (849). The duchy was ruled by figures elected by the people, which received honorary titles from the Byzantine Emperor.

In 1035 the city was acquired by Guaimar IV of Salerno, who gave it to his brother Guy. After a brief return under the Duchy of Naples, it returned in Lombard hands with Gisulf II of Salerno; when the latter was defeated by Robert Guiscard, Sorrento entered the Norman sphere of influence: any residual independence was ended in 1137 when it was conquered by Roger II of Sicily, and annexed to the Kingdom of Sicily.

On 13 June 1558 it was sacked by elements of the Ottoman navy under the command of Dragut and his lieutenant Piali, as part of the struggle between the Turks and Spain, which controlled the southern half of Italy at that time. 2,000 captives were reportedly taken away. This struggle was waged throughout the Mediterranean and lasted many decades. The attackers were not &quot;pirates&quot; as often characterised, though some may have been mercenaries from North Africa. The campaigns were conducted on the direct orders of Sultan Suleiman. The attack led to the construction of a new line of walls. The most striking event of the following century was the revolt against Spanish domination of 1648, led by Giovanni Grillo. In 1656 a plague struck the city. However, Sorrento remained one of the most important centres of southern Campania.
Sorrento entered into the Neapolitan Republic of 1799, but in vain. 

In the 19th century the economy of the city improved markedly, favoured by the development of agriculture, tourism and trade. A route connecting Sorrento to Castellammare di Stabia was opened under the reign of Ferdinand II (1830–1859). In 1861 Sorrento was officially annexed to the new Kingdom of Italy. In the following years it confirmed and increased its status of one of the most renowned tourist destinations of Italy, a trend which continued into the 20th century. Famous people who visited it include Lord Byron, Keats, Goethe, Friedrich Nietzsche, Henrik Ibsen and Walter Scott.

==Fortifications and castles==
Having been a city victim of numerous attacks by pirates for its riches, Sorrento boasted in the past numerous castles and fortifications, especially on the strip of land that runs along the sea.

==Sorrento, legends and myths==
The myth of the Sirens has been loosely associated with Sorrento since antiquity. Three mermaids settled near Punta Campanella enchanting the seafarers sailing through those waters.

== The beach of Queen Giovanna ==
A beach near to Sorrento natural swimming pool near the summer residence of the homonymous ruler. It is said that Queen Giovanna d&#x27;Angiò spent her summer holidays pleasantly in Sorrento. Having many lovers, she indulged them right on this beach. After taking advantage of them she had them drowned by her soldiers.

==Rites of Holy week==
The two main processions that take place in Sorrento on Good Friday are the Procession of Our Lady of Sorrows (or the &quot;Visit in the Sepulchres&quot;), organised by the Venerable Arciconfraternita of Saint Monica and the Procession of the Crucified Christ, organised by the Venerable Arciconfraternita of the Death.

==Geography==
=== Climate ===
Sorrento experiences a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;). with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers.

Temperatures can get as high as in April, as happened in 2013.
==Culture==
Sorrento has been visited by Lord Byron, John Keats, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Charles Dickens, Richard Wagner, Henrik Ibsen, and Friedrich Nietzsche. Sorrento was the birthplace of the poet Torquato Tasso, author of the &quot;Gerusalemme Liberata&quot;. The town was featured in the early 20th century song &quot;Torna a Surriento&quot; (Come Back to Sorrento) with lyrics by Giambattista De Curtis, brother of the song&#x27;s composer, Ernesto De Curtis. 

In the 1920s, famous Soviet writer Maxim Gorky lived in Sorrento.

Songs that have featured Surrento prominently have included &quot;Torna a Surriento&quot; and &quot;Caruso&quot;, a song composed in Sorrento, in the summer of 1985, by the Bolognese singer-songwriter Lucio Dalla, whose fifty-years ties with Sorrento are described in the novel by the Sorrentine writer, Raffaele Lauro, titled &quot;Caruso The Song - Lucio Dalla and Sorrento&quot;, which was released in December 2014.

<text>==Events==
* 1826 – Nicéphore Niépce takes the oldest known extant photograph, &quot;View from the Window at Le Gras&quot;.
* 1833 – Joseph Plateau (Belgium) introduces a scientific demonstration device that creates an optical illusion of movement by mounting drawings on the face of a slotted, spinning disk, later published as the Fantascope (and now better known as the Phenakistoscope). Simon von Stampfer (Vienna) publishes the very similar stroboscopic discs a few months later.
* 1866 – The Zoetrope is introduced. The device was a hollow drum with a strip of pictures around its inner surface. When the drum was spun and the pictures viewed through slots on the side of the drum, the pictures appeared to move.
* 1870s – French inventor Charles-Émile Reynaud improved on the Zoetrope idea by placing mirrors at the center of the drum. He called his invention the Praxinoscope. Reynaud developed other versions of the Praxinoscope too, including a Praxinoscope Theatre, where the device was enclosed in a viewing box, and the Projecting Praxinoscope. Eventually he created the &quot;Théâtre Optique&quot;, a large machine based on the Praxinoscope, but able to project longer animated strips.
* 1874 – &quot;Passage de Vénus&quot; is recorded as a series of still pictures on a disc with Jules Janssen&#x27;s photographic revolver.
* 1878 – Railroad tycoon Leland Stanford hires British photographer Eadweard Muybridge to settle arguments about the strides of horses that were difficult to discern with the naked eye. Muybridge successfully photographed successive positions of horses in fast motion, using a battery of 12 cameras controlled by trip wires and an electrical shutter system. Stanford&#x27;s experiments were partly inspired by French scientist&#x27;s Étienne-Jules Marey studies with equipment that graphically recorded data to analyze animal and human movement. 
* 1880 – Eadweard Muybridge holds a public demonstration of his Zoopraxiscope, a magic lantern provided with a rotating disc with artist&#x27;s renderings of Muybridge&#x27;s chronophotographic sequences. It was used as a demonstration device by Muybridge in his illustrated lecture (the original preserved in the Museum of Kingston upon Thames in England).
* 1882 – American inventor George Eastman begins experimenting with new types of photographic film, with his employee, William Walker.
* 1882 – French physiologist Étienne-Jules Marey develops his own version of Janssen&#x27;s camera: a chronophotographic gun that could photograph twelve successive images per second.
* 1885 – American inventors George Eastman and Hannibal Goodwin each invent a sensitized celluloid base roll photographic film to replace the glass plates then in use.
* 1887 – German chronophotographer Ottomar Anschutz very successfully presents his photographs in motion with his Electrotachyscope that uses transparent pictures in a wheel.
* 1887 – Hannibal Goodwin files for a patent for his photographic film.
* 1888 – George Eastman files for a patent for his photographic film.
* 1888 – Thomas Edison meets with Eadweard Muybridge to discuss adding sound to moving pictures. Edison begins his own experiments.
* 1888 – Louis Aimé Augustin Le Prince creates the first motion picture films created on paper rolls of film.
* 1889 – George Eastman&#x27;s celluloid base roll photographic film becomes commercially available.
* June 1889 or November 1890 – William K. L. Dickson, working for Thomas Edison, creates the first known motion picture films shot in the United States, the Monkeyshines films.
* 1891 – Designed around the work of Anschutz, Muybridge, Marey, and Eastman, Thomas Edison&#x27;s employee William K. L. Dickson finishes work on a motion-picture camera, called the Kinetograph, and a viewing machine, called the Kinetoscope.
* May 20, 1891 – Thomas Edison holds the first public presentation of his Kinetoscope for the National Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs.
* August 24, 1891 – Thomas Edison files for a patent of the Kinetoscope.
* 1892 – Charles-Émile Reynaud begins public screenings in Paris at the Théâtre Optique, with hundreds of drawings on a reel that he wound through his Praxinoscope projector to construct moving image stories that continued for about 15 minutes each.
* March 14, 1893 – Thomas Edison is granted Patent #493,426 for &quot;An Apparatus for Exhibiting Photographs of Moving Objects&quot; (the Kinetoscope).
* 1893 – Thomas Edison builds a motion-picture studio, dubbed the &quot;Black Maria&quot; by his staff.
* May 9, 1893 – In America, Thomas Edison holds the first public exhibition of films shot using his Kinetograph at the Brooklyn Institute. Only one person at a time could use his viewing machine, the Kinetoscope.
* January 7, 1894 – Dickson and William Heise film &quot;Fred Ott&#x27;s Sneeze&quot; with the Kinetoscope at &quot;Edison&#x27;s Black Maria&quot;.
* April 14, 1894 – The first commercial presentation of the Kinetoscope takes place at the Holland Brothers&#x27; Kinetoscope Parlor at 1155 Broadway, New York City.
* 1894 – Kinetoscope viewing parlors begin to open in major cities. Each parlor contains several machines.
* November 1895 – In Germany, Emil and Max Skladanowsky start publicly screening their films with their Bioskop.
* 1895 – In France, Gaumont, the world&#x27;s oldest extant film studio, is founded as a producer of photographic equipment (the company would start production of films in 1897).
* December 1895 – In France, Auguste and Louis Lumière hold their first commercial screenings of films shot with their Cinématographe, a lightweight, hand-held motion picture camera.
* January 1896 – In Britain, Birt Acres and Robert W. Paul develop their own film projector, the Theatrograph (later known as the Animatograph).
* January 1896 – In the United States, a projector called the Vitascope is designed by Charles Francis Jenkins and Thomas Armat. Armat began working with Thomas Edison to manufacture the Vitascope, which projected motion pictures.
* January 26, 1896 – Brothers Auguste and Louis Lumière release &quot;L&#x27;Arrivée d&#x27;un train en gare de La Ciotat&quot; in France.

<doc id="172583" wikidata="Q261957" url="?curid=172583" title="Stuart Bell">
<text>Sir Stuart Bell (16 May 1938 – 13 October 2012) was a British Labour Party politician, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Middlesbrough from the 1983 general election until his death in 2012. He was known as the longest serving Second Church Estates Commissioner, serving in this role during the entire period of Labour government from 1997–2010.

==Early life==
Bell was born in County Durham in 1938, the son of a miner. He studied at the Hookergate Grammar School on School Lane in High Spen near Rowlands Gill, Gateshead. He later attended the Durham Pitmans College. He joined the Labour Party in 1964, and was called to the Bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1970. He worked as an international lawyer in Paris until 1977, representing large multi-national companies. He contested Hexham at the 1979 general election, but was defeated by the Conservative MP and former Cabinet Minister Geoffrey Rippon.

==Parliamentary career==
Bell was elected to the City Council of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1980. In 1982, the Labour MP for Middlesbrough, Arthur Bottomley announced that he would step down at the next general election; Bell won the subsequent selection process to fight the seat at the 1983 general election. Bell comfortably held the seat, elected with a majority just short of 10,000 votes.

At Westminster, Bell became the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition Roy Hattersley in 1983. He was promoted to the shadow frontbench in 1984 by Neil Kinnock as a Spokesman for Northern Ireland. However, he chose to resign his post after the Cleveland child abuse scandal which occupied two years of his life, after making unsubstantiated accusations of &#x27;clinical error&#x27; against local paediatricians and child sexual abuse specialists. The paediatricians, Dr. Marietta Higgs and Dr. Geoffrey Wyatt, were later absolved and their forensic clinical work validated at a committee of inquiry overseen by Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss. The committee concluded that most of the diagnoses were incorrect. As a result, 94 of the 121 children were returned to their homes.

After the 1992 general election and the election of John Smith as the Leader of the Labour Party, Bell returned to the shadow frontbenches as a spokesman for Trade and Industry. After the election of the Labour Government at the 1997 general election he was dropped from Labour&#x27;s frontbench, but was appointed on the advice of Tony Blair as the Second Church Estates Commissioner, the spokesman for the Church of England in the House of Commons, a position he held from 1997 to 2010.

In 1998, Bell was one of 14 Labour MPs who voted against equalising the age of consent for homosexual activity. From 2000 to 2005 he was the Chairman of the Finance and Services Committee, which manages the annual budget of the House of Commons and its many employees. In 2005 he became a member of the Finance and Services Committee until 2008 when he served as chairman until 2010. Relatedly, from 2000 until 2010 he was a member of the House of Commons Commission, which oversees the administration of the House and the Members Estimate Committee that sets MPs&#x27; pay and pensions. He was a member of the Liaison Committee between 2000–10. He was a member of the Ecclesiastical Committee from 1997.

Bell sat on the Members Estimates Committee at Parliament and was heavily involved representing MPs&#x27; interests in the MPs&#x27; expenses scandal of 2009. He was a member in Speaker&#x27;s Committee for the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority between 2009–10. A founder member of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, he was a Treasurer of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for the Promotion of First Past the Post. and was Secretary of the Franco-British Parliamentary Relations Committee in the Commons. In February 2010 Bell was played by David Calder in the television film On Expenses.

==Criticism and controversy==
In 2002 his son, Malcolm, was jailed after admitting to stealing £8,000 from his father&#x27;s colleagues, while he worked in Parliament.

On 13 October 2009, he claimed on the BBC &quot;Today&quot; programme that the investigation by Sir Thomas Legg into the United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal was marked by &quot;retrospectivity&quot;, as Sir Thomas had changed the rules on expenses after MPs&#x27; claims had been submitted.

Stuart Bell featured in a film of the 2010 general election entitled &quot;ToryBoy The Movie&quot; made by John Walsh, which explored the candidate&#x27;s selection process and the work that goes into an election campaign. Later in 2011, Neil Macfarlane, in a report for local newspaper &quot;Teesside Gazette&quot;, asked &quot;Are Teessiders getting enough from Sir Stuart Bell?&quot; when he failed to answer over 100 telephone calls made to his constituency office over three months. The &quot;Gazette&quot; story was picked up by national newspapers. &quot;The Independent&quot; asked &quot;is Sir Stuart Bell Britain&#x27;s laziest MP?&quot; The &quot;Guardian&quot; fact-checked the &quot;laziest MP&quot; claim and found that: &quot;Bell has been an MP for nearly 30 years and has had a distinguished career in parliament as a frontbench spokesman on trade and industry in opposition and the spokesman for the Church of England in the House of Commons and member of the House of Commons commission until last year. He&#x27;s part of a breed of politicians – also including the Tory Edward Leigh and Labour&#x27;s Gerald Kaufman – who have been extremely active parliamentarians but not always maintained an office in their constituency. One measure of their parliamentary work is the proportion of votes they turn up to... Bell&#x27;s record doesn&#x27;t cover him in glory, discounting frontbenchers, Northern Irish MPs, the Speaker and his deputies, he has the 10th worst attendance record with a 65.4% absence rate.&quot; The Labour Party said it was looking into the allegations.

==Other interests==
Bell was a member of the French think tank, the Fondation pour l&#x27;Innovation Politique. He was also a regular newspaper columnist for the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; and other publications.

==Personal life==

Bell was married in 1960 to Margaret Bruce and they had a son and a daughter. After his divorce, he married Margaret Allan in 1980 and they had a son.

==Honours==
Bell was knighted in 2004 for his &quot;services to Parliament&quot; and was appointed a Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur, France&#x27;s highest order, by President Jacques Chirac in 2006.

==Death==
Bell died on 13 October 2012, aged 74, after a short battle with pancreatic cancer. A by-election was held in the Middlesbrough constituency.

<text>Laser cooling includes several techniques where atoms, molecules, and small mechanical systems are cooled with laser light. The directed energy of lasers is often associated with heating materials, e.g. laser cutting, so it can be counterintuitive that laser cooling often results in sample temperatures approaching absolute zero. It is a routine step in many atomic physics experiments where the laser-cooled atoms are then subsequently manipulated and measured, or in technologies, such as atom-based quantum computing architectures. Laser cooling relies on the change in momentum when an object, such as an atom, absorbs and re-emits a photon (a particle of light). For example, if laser light illuminates a warm cloud of atoms from all directions and the laser&#x27;s frequency is tuned below an atomic resonance, the atoms will be cooled. This common type of laser cooling relies on the Doppler effect where individual atoms will preferentially absorb laser light from the direction opposite to the atom&#x27;s motion. The absorbed light is re-emitted by the atom in a random direction. After repeated emission and absorption of light the net effect on the cloud of atoms is that they will expand more slowly. The slower expansion reflects a decrease in the velocity distribution of the atoms, which corresponds to a lower temperature and therefore the atoms have been cooled. For an ensemble of particles, their thermodynamic temperature is proportional to the variance in their velocity, therefore the lower the distribution of velocities, the lower temperature of the particles.

The primary benefit of laser cooling is reducing the random motion of particles or mechanical systems. For atoms and molecules this reduces the effect of Doppler shifts in spectroscopy, allowing for high precision measurements and instruments such as optical clocks. The reduction in thermal energy also allows for efficient loading of atoms and molecules into traps where they can be used in experiments or atom-based devices for longer periods of time.
== History ==

=== Radiation pressure ===
Radiation pressure is the force that electromagnetic radiation exerts on matter. In 1873 Maxwell published his treatise on electromagnetism in which he predicted radiation pressure. The force was experimentally demonstrated for the first time by Lebedev and reported at a conference in Paris in 1900, and later published in more detail in 1901. Following Lebedev&#x27;s measurements Nichols and Hull also demonstrated the force of radiation pressure in 1901, with a refined measurement reported in 1903. 

Atoms and molecules have bound states and transitions can occur between these states in the presence of light. Sodium is historically notable because it has a strong transition at 589 nm, a wavelength which is close to the peak sensitivity of the human eye. This made it easy to see the interaction of light with sodium atoms. In 1933, Otto Frisch deflected an atomic beam of sodium atoms with light. 
This was the first realization of radiation pressure acting on an atom or molecule.

=== Laser cooling proposals ===
The introduction of lasers in atomic physics experiments was the precursor to the laser cooling proposals in the mid 1970s. Laser cooling was proposed separately in 1975 by two different research groups: Hänsch and Schawlow, and Wineland and Dehmelt. Both proposals outlined the simplest laser cooling process, known as Doppler cooling, where laser light tuned below an atom&#x27;s resonant frequency is preferentially absorbed by atoms moving towards the laser and after absorption a photon is emitted in a random direction. This process is repeated many times and in a configuration with counterpropagating laser cooling light the velocity distribution of the atoms is reduced. 

In 1977 Ashkin submitted a paper which describes how Doppler cooling could be used to provide the necessary damping to load atoms into an optical trap. In this work he emphasized how this could allow for long spectroscopic measurements which would increase precision because the atoms would be held in place. He also discussed overlapping optical traps to study interactions between different atoms.

=== Initial realizations ===
Following the laser cooling proposals, in 1978 two research groups that Wineland, Drullinger and Walls of NIST, and Neuhauser, Hohenstatt, Toscheck and Dehmelt of the University of Washington succeeded in laser cooling atoms. The NIST group wanted to reduce the effect of Doppler broadening on spectroscopy. They cooled magnesium ions in a Penning trap to below 40 K. The Washington group cooled barium ions. 
The research from both groups served to illustrate the mechanical properties of light. 

Influenced by the Wineland&#x27;s work on laser cooling ions, William Phillips applied the same principles to laser cool neutral atoms. In 1982, he published the first paper where neutral atoms were laser cooled. The process used is now known as the Zeeman slower and is a standard technique for slowing an atomic beam.

The 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, Steven Chu, and William Daniel Phillips &quot;for development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light&quot;.

=== Modern advances ===

==== Atoms ====
The Doppler cooling limit for electric dipole transitions is typically in the hundreds of microkelvins. In the 1980s this limit was seen as the lowest achievable temperature. It was a surprise then when sodium atoms were cooled to 43 microkelvins when their Doppler cooling limit is 240 microkelvins, this unforeseen low temperature was explained by considering the interaction of polarized laser light with more atomic states and transitions. Previous conceptions of laser cooling were decided to have been too simplistic. The major laser cooling breakthroughs in the 70s and 80s led to several improvements to preexisting technology and new discoveries with temperatures just above absolute zero. The cooling processes were utilized to make atomic clocks more accurate and to improve spectroscopic measurements, and led to the observation of a new state of matter at ultracold temperatures. The new state of matter, the Bose–Einstein condensate, was observed in 1995 by Eric Cornell, Carl Wieman, and Wolfgang Ketterle.

==== Exotic Atoms ====
Most laser cooling experiments bring the atoms close to at rest in the laboratory frame, but cooling of relativistic atoms has also been achieved, where the effect of cooling manifests as a narrowing of the velocity distribution. In 1990, a group at JGU successfully laser-cooled a beam of 7Li+ at in a storage ring from to lower than , using two counter-propagating lasers addressing the same transition, but at and , respectively, to compensate for the large Doppler shift. 

Laser cooling of antimatter has also been demonstrated, first in 2021 by the ALPHA collaboration on antihydrogen atoms. In 2024, positronium, made up of an electron and a positron, was laser cooled to about 1K.

==== Molecules ====
Molecules are significantly more challenging to laser cool than atoms because molecules have vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom. These extra degrees of freedom result in more energy levels that can be populated from excited state decays, requiring more lasers compared to atoms to address the more complex level structure. Vibrational decays are particularly challenging because there are no symmetry rules that restrict the vibrational states that can be populated.

In 2010, a team at Yale successfully laser-cooled a diatomic molecule. In 2016, a group at MPQ successfully cooled formaldehyde to via optoelectric Sisyphus cooling. In 2022, a group at Harvard successfully laser cooled and trapped CaOH to in a magneto-optical trap.

==== Mechanical systems ====
Starting in the 2000s, laser cooling was applied to small mechanical systems, ranging from small cantilevers to the mirrors used in the LIGO observatory. These devices are connected to a larger substrate, such as a mechanical membrane attached to a frame, or they are held in optical traps, in both cases the mechanical system is a harmonic oscillator. Laser cooling reduces the random vibrations of the mechanical oscillator, removing thermal phonons from the system.

In 2007, an MIT team successfully laser-cooled a macro-scale (1 gram) object to 0.8 K. In 2011, a team from the California Institute of Technology and the University of Vienna became the first to laser-cool a (10 μm × 1 μm) mechanical object to its quantum ground state.

== Methods ==

The first realization of laser cooling, and also still the most common method for cooling atoms and molecules (so much so that it is often referred to simply as &#x27;laser cooling&#x27;), is Doppler cooling. 

=== Doppler cooling ===
Doppler cooling, which is usually accompanied by a magnetic trapping force to give a magneto-optical trap, is by far the most common method of laser cooling. It is used to cool low density gases down to the Doppler cooling limit, which for rubidium is around 150 .

In Doppler cooling, initially, the frequency of light is tuned slightly below an electronic transition in the atom. Because the light is detuned to the &quot;red&quot; (i.e., at lower frequency) of the transition, the atoms will absorb more photons if they move towards the light source, due to the Doppler effect. Thus if one applies light from two opposite directions, the atoms will always scatter more photons from the laser beam pointing opposite to their direction of motion. In each scattering event the atom loses a momentum equal to the momentum of the photon. If the atom, which is now in the excited state, then emits a photon spontaneously, it will be kicked by the same amount of momentum, but in a random direction. Since the initial momentum change is a pure loss (opposing the direction of motion), while the subsequent change is random, the probable result of the absorption and emission process is to reduce the momentum of the atom, and therefore its speed—provided its initial speed was larger than the recoil speed from scattering a single photon. If the absorption and emission are repeated many times, the average speed, and therefore the kinetic energy of the atom, will be reduced. Since the temperature of a group of atoms is a measure of the average random internal kinetic energy, this is equivalent to cooling the atoms.

When atoms are Doppler cooled in three dimensions, traditionally by 6 counter-propagating red-detuned laser beams, this is called optical molasses because the atoms move slowly, as if they are moving through molasses. 
=== Sub-Doppler cooling ===
After Doppler cooling it is often helpful to cool atoms (or molecules) below their Doppler limit. This is accomplished with a variety sub-Doppler cooling techniques. Different atomic structures are amenable to different sub-Doppler cooling techniques. For example, gray molasses is used with lithium and potassium because they have unresolved hyperfine structure in their excited states where polarization gradient cooling would not work. 

Sub-Doppler cooling methods include:

* Sisyphus cooling
* Polarization gradient cooling
* Resolved sideband cooling
* Raman sideband cooling
* Velocity selective coherent population trapping (VSCPT)
* Gray molasses
* Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) cooling

=== Other methods ===
Other laser cooling methods include:

* Cavity-mediated cooling
* Anti-Stokes cooling in solids

== Applications ==

Laser cooling is ubiquitous in the field of atomic physics. Reducing the random motion of atoms has several benefits, including the ability to trap atoms with optical or magnetic fields. Spectroscopic measurements of a cold atomic sample will also have reduced systematic uncertainties due to thermal motion.

Often multiple laser cooling techniques are used in a single experiment to prepare a cold sample of atoms, which is then subsequently manipulated and measured. In a representative experiment a vapor of strontium atoms is generated in a hot oven that exit the oven as an atomic beam. After leaving the oven the atoms are Doppler cooled in two dimensions transverse to their motion to reduce loss of atoms due to divergence of the atomic beam. The atomic beam is then slowed and cooled with a Zeeman slower to optimize the atom loading efficiency into a magneto-optical trap (MOT), which Doppler cools the atoms, that operates on the with lasers at 461 nm. The MOT transitions from using light at 461 nm to using light at 689 nm to drive the , which is a narrow transition, to realize even colder atoms. The atoms are then transferred into an optical dipole trap where evaporative cooling gets them to temperatures where they can be effectively loaded into an optical lattice.

Laser cooling is important for quantum computing efforts based on neutral atoms and trapped atomic ions. In an ion trap Doppler cooling reduces the random motion of the ions so they form a well-ordered crystal structure in the trap. After Doppler cooling the ions are often cooled to their motional ground state to reduce decoherence during quantum gates between ions.

== Equipment ==

Laser cooling atoms (and molecules especially) requires specialized experimental equipment that when assembled forms a cold atom machine. Such a machine generally consists of two parts: a vacuum chamber which houses the laser cooled atoms and the laser systems used for cooling, as well as for preparing and manipulating atomic states and detecting the atoms.

=== Vacuum system ===

In order for atoms to be laser cooled, the atoms cannot collide with room temperature background gas particles. Such collisions will drastically heat the atoms, and knock them out of weak traps. Acceptable collision rates for cold atom machines typically require vacuum pressures at 10−9 Torr, and very often hundreds or even thousands of times lower pressures are necessary. To achieve these low pressures, a vacuum chamber is needed. The vacuum chamber typically includes windows so that the atoms can be addressed with lasers (e.g. for laser cooling) and light emitted by the atoms or absorption of light be the atoms can be detected. The vacuum chamber also requires an atomic source for the atom(s) to be laser cooled. The atomic source is generally heated to produce thermal atoms that can be laser cooled. For ion trapping experiments the vacuum system must also hold the ion trap, with the appropriate electric feedthroughs for the trap. Neutral atom systems very often employ a Magneto-optical trap (MOT) as one of the early stages in collecting and cooling atoms. For a MOT typically magnetic field coils are placed outside of the vacuum chamber to generate magnetic field gradients for the MOT.

=== Lasers ===
The laser required for cold atom machines are entirely dependent on the choice of atom. Each atom has unique electronic transitions at very distinct wavelengths that must be driven for the atom to be laser cooled. Rubidium, for example is a very commonly used atom which requires driving two transitions with laser light at 780 nm that are separated by a few GHz. The light for rubidium can be generated from a signal laser at 780 nm and an Electro-optic modulator. Generally tens of mW (and often hundreds of mW to cool significantly more atoms) is used to cool neutral atoms. Trapped ions on the other hand require microwatts of optical power, as they are generally tightly confined and the laser light can be focused to a small spot size. The strontium ion, for example requires light at both 422 nm and 1092 nm in order to be Doppler cooled. Because of the small Doppler shifts involved with laser cooling, very narrow lasers, order of a few MHz, are required for laser cooling. Such lasers are generally stabilized to spectroscopy reference cells, optical cavities, or sometimes wavemeters so the laser light can be precisely tuned relative to the atomic transitions.

<text>Futebol Clube do Porto, (), commonly known as FC Porto or simply Porto, is a Portuguese professional sports club based in Porto. It is best known for the professional football team playing in the Primeira Liga, the top flight of Portuguese football.

Founded on 28 September 1893, Porto is one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; (Portuguese: &quot;Os Três Grandes&quot;) teams in Portugal – together with Lisbon-based rivals Benfica and Sporting CP, that have appeared in every season of the Primeira Liga since its establishment in 1934. They are nicknamed &quot;dragões&quot; (Dragons), for the mythical creature atop the club&#x27;s crest, and &quot;Azuis e brancos&quot; (Blue-and-whites), for the shirt colours. Those colours are in stripes with blue shorts. The club supporters are called &quot;portistas&quot;. Since 2003, Porto have played their home matches at the Estádio do Dragão, which replaced the previous 51-year-old ground, the Estádio das Antas.
Porto is one of the two most decorated clubs in Portuguese football, with 86 major trophies. Domestically, these comprise 30 Portuguese league titles (five of which won consecutively between 1994–95 and 1998–99, a Portuguese football record), 20 Taça de Portugal, 4 Campeonato de Portugal, 1 Taça da Liga and a record 24 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira. Porto is one of two teams to have won the league title without defeats, in the 2010–11 and 2012–13 seasons. In the former, Porto achieved the largest-ever difference of points between champion and runner-up in a three-points-per-win system (21 points), on their way to a second quadruple.
In international competitions, Porto is the most decorated Portuguese team, with seven trophies. They won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League in 1987 and 2004, the UEFA Cup/Europa League in 2003 and 2011, the UEFA Super Cup in 1987, and the Intercontinental Cup in 1987 and 2004. In addition, they were runners-up in the 1983–84 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, plus the 2003, 2004 and 2011 editions of the UEFA Super Cup. Porto is the only Portuguese club to have won the UEFA Cup/Europa League, the UEFA Super Cup, the Intercontinental Cup, and to have achieved a continental treble of domestic league, domestic cup and European titles (2002–03 and 2010–11). Porto have the third-most appearances in the UEFA Champions League group stage (23), behind Barcelona and Real Madrid (24). In UEFA, Porto ranks 9th in the all-time club ranking and also ranked 20th in the club coefficient rankings at the end of the 2022–23 season.

==History==
===Early years (1893–1921)===

The club was founded on 28 September 1893 as &quot;Foot-Ball Club do Porto&quot; by António Nicolau de Almeida, a local port wine merchant and avid sportsman, who became fascinated with football during his trips to England. Porto played its first matches with other Portuguese clubs, including one against Lisbon&#x27;s &quot;Foot-Ball Club Lisbonense&quot; on 2 March 1894. This match had the patronage of King Carlos I and Queen Amélie of Orléans, who travelled to Porto to witness the event and present a trophy to the winners.

Almeida&#x27;s enthusiasm and involvement with the club waned due to family pressure, and by the turn of the century, Porto had entered a period of inactivity. In 1906, José Monteiro da Costa returned to Porto after finishing his studies in England. Like Almeida, thirteen years before, he was also captivated by the English game, and together with some associates, decided to reintroduce the practice of football in the city, outside of the British circles. On 2 August 1906, Porto was revived and Monteiro da Costa appointed its president. Although football was the driving force, the club also promoted other sports, including gymnastics, weightlifting and wrestling, athletics and swimming. Shortly after, Porto rented its first ground and recruited a French coach named Adolphe Cassaigne, who would stay in the club until 1925.

On 15 December 1907, Porto played its first match against a foreign team, hosting Spain&#x27;s Real Fortuna. In the following month, Porto returned the visit and played its first match abroad. Four years later, the club won the inaugural staging of the Taça José Monteiro da Costa, securing its first-ever major title. In 1912, Porto joined efforts with Leixões to establish the Porto Football Association, which began organising the regional championship in the following year. Porto finished the first season as runners-up, behind local rivals Boavista, but in the following season the club won its first championship. By the end of the 1920–21 season, Porto had been regional champions six times in seven years, and outright winners of the Taça José Monteiro da Costa, after claiming a third consecutive victory in 1916.

===First national titles and drought years (1921–1977)===
The 1921–22 season was marked by the creation of the first nationwide football competition – the Campeonato de Portugal. Organised by the national federation, this knockout tournament gathered the winners of the regional championships to determine the Portuguese champion. After clinching its fourth consecutive regional title, Porto defeated Sporting CP in the inaugural edition and became the first national champions. While a dominant regional force, the club faced stronger opposition in the national championship, winning it only three more times in a span of sixteen years (1925, 1932 and 1937). In 1933–34, Porto was denied participation in the Campeonato de Portugal by its football association for refusing to release players for a match between the Porto and Lisbon regional teams.

In the following season, a second nationwide competition named &quot;Campeonato da Primeira Liga&quot; (English: Premier League Championship), or simply Primeira Liga, was provisionally established by the national federation to increase the number of matches per season and improve the competitiveness of Portuguese football. As the regional champion, Porto qualified for the first edition of the new round-robin competition, winning it with 10 victories in 14 matches. Due to the success of its format, the Primeira Liga was made an official championship competition for the 1938–39 season – its name changed to &quot;Campeonato Nacional da Primeira Divisão&quot; (English: First Division National Championship) or simply Primeira Divisão – and replaced the Campeonato de Portugal, which in turn was converted into the Taça de Portugal, the main domestic cup competition. Porto won the inaugural edition of the new league championship and successfully defended the title in the next season, despite almost failing to take part. The club failed to secure a third consecutive title, and after nearly missing again a place in the Primeira Divisão in 1941–42, it would only return to a top-three finish in the 1946–47 season. In 1948, Porto defeated English champions Arsenal 3–2 in a friendly match. To commemorate this victory, the associates offered the club a massive trophy made of of silver and wood – the Arsenal Cup.

Having endured a 16-year title drought period, Porto returned to winning ways by taking the 1955–56 Primeira Divisão on head-to-head advantage over runners-up Benfica. Later that season, Porto beat Torreense to win its first Taça de Portugal and achieved its first double. As the Portuguese league winner, Porto made its debut in European competitions by qualifying for the 1956–57 European Cup. The club&#x27;s first participation was short-lived, ending in the preliminary round with two defeats against Spanish champions Athletic Bilbao. A year later, Porto lifted its second Taça de Portugal by beating Benfica 1–0 in the final. In 1958, Béla Guttmann took charge as coach of Porto and helped them overhaul a five-point lead enjoyed by Benfica to win the Portuguese League title in 1959. The two clubs met in the season&#x27;s final, but this time Benfica took the trophy and denied a second double for Porto that had won the 1958–59 Primeira Divisão three months before.

Shortly after, the club entered another lacklustre period of its history, the highest point of which was a victory in the 1968 Taça de Portugal final. During this time, Porto had its worst-ever league classification, a ninth place in 1969–70, while its best league record in that period consisted of six runner-up finishes (four consecutive between 1961–62 and 1964–65). In European competitions, the club participated for the first time in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (and its successor, the UEFA Cup) and in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, without getting past the third round.
One of the club&#x27;s most tragic moments occurred on 16 December 1973, when during a league match against Vitória de Setúbal, the 26-year-old captain Pavão fell unconscious on the pitch and died later at the hospital. The following month, Porto presented Peruvian international Teófilo Cubillas, who became one of the club&#x27;s most successful players, scoring 65 goals in 108 games.

===International affirmation (1977–1988)===

The return of José Maria Pedroto – a former Porto player and head coach in the late 1960s – in the 1976–77 season started a new chapter in the club&#x27;s history. Responsible for the previous cup triumph in 1968, Pedroto guided Porto to its fourth title in the competition. In the following season, he put an end to Porto&#x27;s league title drought, winning the championship 19 years after having played in the team that took the last title. Internationally, Porto reached the quarter-finals of the 1977–78 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, beating Manchester United along the way, but suffered its heaviest defeat (6–1) against AEK Athens in the subsequent season&#x27;s European Cup. A poor run of performances in the latter part of the season – resulting in the loss of the league and cup titles – sparked a conflict between the technical staff and president Américo de Sá, which ended with the resignation of Pedroto and his replacement by Hermann Stessl. In December 1981, Porto overcame Benfica to win the inaugural staging of the Portuguese Super Cup, the Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira.

Pedroto returned in April 1982 by the hand of the club&#x27;s newly elected president Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa, who had resigned as director of football, two years before, in solidarity with the coach. The previous month, Porto fell again in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup quarter-finals against one of the eventual finalists, but needed only two years to finally reach the competition&#x27;s final. On 16 May 1984, Porto played its first major European final in Basel&#x27;s St. Jakob Stadium, losing 2–1 to Michel Platini&#x27;s Juventus. Already without Pedroto, who stepped down due to illness, Porto won that season&#x27;s Taça and Supertaça but lost the championship to Benfica. Under the steering of Pedroto&#x27;s apprentice, Artur Jorge, the following season brought the Primeira Divisão title back to the club and crowned homegrown striker Fernando Gomes as Europe&#x27;s top goalscorer for the second time, after first taking the award in 1983.

Porto retained the league title in 1986, securing an entry to the 1986–87 European Cup. In the first game, the club recorded its biggest win in European competitions: 9–0 against Maltese side Rabat Ajax. Vítkovice of Czechoslovakia, Brøndby of Denmark, and Dynamo Kyiv of the Soviet Union were successively eliminated as Porto advanced to its first European Cup final, against Bayern Munich. Trailing the Germans 1–0 until the 79th minute, Porto scored twice in two minutes – the first goal through a famous backheel from former Algerian international Rabah Madjer, who assisted Juary for the second – to secure a surprising win and the European Cup title.
The following season, under new coach Tomislav Ivic, the club completed a treble of international trophies by beating Ajax for the 1987 European Super Cup and Uruguay&#x27;s Peñarol for the 1987 Intercontinental Cup. 
The 1987–88 season was one of the most successful for the club, who also won the Taça de Portugal and an expanded 20-team Primeira Divisão with a record number of goals scored (88) and distance in points to the runners-up (15).

===&quot;Tri, Tetra, Penta&quot; (1988–2001)===
In contrast to the previous season, Porto failed to win a trophy in 1988–89, with many of its players struck down with injuries, such as Madjer and Gomes. Fifteen years after his first-team debut, Gomes made his last season for Porto, where he became the all-time top goalscorer with 352 goals in 455 matches. The club brought back Artur Jorge, who recovered the Primeira Divisão title in the following season and added the Taça and Supertaça trophies in 1991. His successor, Brazilian Carlos Alberto Silva, won back-to-back league titles in two seasons and qualified Porto for the first UEFA Champions League.
Midway through the 1993–94 season, Porto hired former England manager Bobby Robson, who had been sacked by Sporting CP. The club closed the gap to league winners Benfica, reached the 1993–94 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, and ended the season with a victory over Sporting CP in the Taça de Portugal final.
In Robson&#x27;s first full season, Porto claimed the 1994–95 Primeira Divisão title with a win at Sporting CP&#x27;s ground and played Benfica four times to secure both the 1993 and 1994 stagings of the Supertaça. The beginning of the season had been clouded by the death of 26-year-old midfielder Rui Filipe, who had scored the club&#x27;s first league goal. Robson&#x27;s increasing health problems barred him from leading Porto in the first months of the 1995–96 season, but he returned in time to revalidate the league title. Striker Domingos Paciência became the club&#x27;s top goalscorer for the second consecutive time and won that season&#x27;s &quot;Bola de Prata&quot;, the last win by a Portuguese player.

To fill the void left by the departure of Robson for Barcelona, Porto hired former club captain and Portugal national team manager António Oliveira. Under his command, Porto made history by winning a third consecutive league title (the &quot;Tri&quot;) for the first time, leaving the runners-up at a distance of 13 points. The club&#x27;s eighth Supertaça win over Benfica was achieved with a solid performance at the Estádio da Luz that resulted in a 5–0 scoreline. The arrival of Brazilian players Artur and Mário Jardel proved highly productive in the 1996–97 UEFA Champions League, as their goals helped Porto beat Milan in Italy and win its group without defeats. In addition, Jardel would win the first of four consecutive &quot;Bola de Prata&quot; awards while at Porto. In Oliveira&#x27;s second and last season at the club, Porto won the Primeira Divisão for the fourth straight season (the &quot;Tetra&quot;), matching Sporting CP&#x27;s achievement in the early 1950s, and secured its third double after beating Braga in the 1998 Taça de Portugal Final.

For the 1998–99 season, Porto tasked Portuguese coach Fernando Santos with winning the club&#x27;s fifth successive Primeira Divisão title (the &quot;Penta&quot;) – a Portuguese football record. He accomplished this feat, becoming thereafter known as the &quot;&quot;Penta&quot; engineer&quot; (a pun to his academic degree), and saw Jardel&#x27;s 36 goals win him the European Golden Shoe. Porto lost the chance to win its sixth straight league title, after finishing four points behind 1999–2000 Primeira Liga champions Sporting, but overcame them to lift its tenth Taça de Portugal trophy. Despite winning the Portuguese cup for the second time in two years, continued failure to retake the league title led to the resignation of Santos at the end of the 2000–01 season.

===Mourinho&#x27;s golden years (2001–2004)===

The appointment of former club player and assistant coach Octávio Machado to head Porto back to the league title appeared to pay off as the team began the season with a Supertaça win against the 2000–01 Primeira Liga winners, Boavista. However, this would be the only major achievement in a lacklustre season that would culminate with a third place in the league classification – the lowest in 20 years. The elimination from the 2001–02 Taça de Portugal, four days after losing away for the Primeira Liga, precipitated the sacking of Machado after 36 matches in charge.

Two days later, Porto signed União de Leiria&#x27;s coach, José Mourinho, who had previously worked for the club alongside Robson. In his presentation, Mourinho promptly showcased his personality by stating unequivocally that the club would win next season&#x27;s league title. He kept true to his promise and delivered one of the club&#x27;s most successful seasons. Fielding the likes of Deco, Ricardo Carvalho, Maniche, and less known players hired from other Portuguese clubs, such as Paulo Ferreira, Pedro Emanuel, Nuno Valente and Derlei, Porto won the 2002–03 Primeira Liga with relative comfort, finishing 11 points ahead of second-placed Benfica. The club also won the UEFA Cup, defeating Celtic in a dramatic extra-time final, to win its second major European title. Mourinho then secured an unprecedented treble for Porto by winning the Taça de Portugal final against his previous club.

The 2003–04 season began with another 1–0 win over União de Leiria, which gave the club its 13th Supertaça. Weeks later, Porto failed to repeat this success in the 2003 UEFA Super Cup, losing 1–0 to Milan. The departure of striker Hélder Postiga was compensated by the signing of South Africa&#x27;s Benni McCarthy, whose 20 league goals helped Porto in its league title defense and crowned him the competition&#x27;s top scorer.

Porto entered the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League directly into the group stage. Porto finished second in its group, losing only once to Real Madrid, and advanced to the round-of-16 where they met Manchester United. After narrowly winning at home (2–1), Porto was on the verge of elimination, being behind by 1–0 till the last minute of official playtime at the second leg at Old Trafford. However, Porto scored the equalizer in the 90th minute of the second leg to draw 1–1 and to advance to the quarter-finals with a 3–2 aggregate win. The team then overcame Lyon and Deportivo La Coruña to reach the Champions League final. Porto defeated Monaco 3–0 to lift the club&#x27;s second European Champion Clubs&#x27; Cup. A 2–1 loss to Benfica in the Taça de Portugal final, held 10 days before, prevented another treble-winning season.

===Life after Mourinho (2004–2010)===
The successful European performances of Mourinho&#x27;s Porto enhanced the reputations of the coach and players like Carvalho, Ferreira and Deco, all of whom left the club in the aftermath of the Champions League victory. The following season was an atypical one, as the club had three coaches: Luigi Delneri, Víctor Fernández and José Couceiro. Under Férnandez, Porto won the 2004 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira and the 2004 Intercontinental Cup, but lost the 2004 UEFA Super Cup to Valencia and was eliminated prematurely in the 2004–05 Taça de Portugal. Recording only 17 wins in 34 matches, Porto lost the Primeira Liga title to Benfica by three points. During this period, Porto was directly involved in the corruption scandal Apito Dourado.

In 2005–06, Dutch coach Co Adriaanse was picked to reorganise the team and return the club to the top of Portuguese football. His tactical discipline and the contribution of new signings Lucho González and Lisandro López led the club to not only retake the Primeira Liga title but also secure its fifth domestic double, after beating holders Vitória de Setúbal in the Taça de Portugal final. Adriaanse&#x27;s domestic success did not transfer to the Champions League, as Porto finished in the bottom of its group.

The club began the 2006–07 season with a new coach, Jesualdo Ferreira, signed from neighbours Boavista. Before Ferreira assumed his role, Porto won the season-opening Supertaça, with former club player Rui Barros acting as interim coach. An experienced head coach, Ferreira had never achieved major club level success, but in his first season in Porto he became national champion for the first time. The 2006–07 Primeira Liga title was only secured in a frantic final day, as Porto finished one point above Sporting and two above Benfica. The following season, the club achieved the &quot;Tri&quot; for the second time in its history – with López clinching the top goalscorer award – but lost the Taça and Supertaça finals to Sporting CP. In May 2008, as result of Apito Dourado, a legal investigation on match fixing in Portuguese football, Porto was fined €150,000 and punished with the loss of six points, while Pinto da Costa was suspended for two years. Porto did not appeal the decision.

Having claimed a sixth league and cup double in the 2008–09 season, Porto was on course to emulate the &quot;Penta&quot; of the late 1990s, but the series was broken by Benfica in the following season. Although Ferreira won his first Supertaça and defended the Taça de Portugal title, the team&#x27;s failure to claim a fifth consecutive league – finishing third, outside the Champions League-qualifying places – and a 3–0 defeat against Benfica in the final of the Taça da Liga contributed to his resignation at the end of the season. A home win against Benfica prevented the rivals from celebrating the league title at the Estádio do Dragão. Under Ferreira&#x27;s steering, Porto always qualified for the Champions League knockout stage, reaching the quarter-finals in 2008–09, where it was eliminated by holders Manchester United.

===Villas-Boas, Pereira and subsequent years (2010–2017)===

The arrival of Mourinho&#x27;s former assistant André Villas-Boas, in the spring of 2010, set the stage for a highly successful 2010–11 season, which began with a 2–0 victory over Benfica for the Supertaça. Spearheaded by João Moutinho, Silvestre Varela, Falcao and Hulk (the &quot;Bola de Prata&quot; winner), Porto performed strongly in the Primeira Liga and assured its 25th title with five matches to play, after beating Benfica in its stadium. In addition, the club broke a number of records: biggest distance between champions and runners-up (21 points), the most consecutive league wins (16), and the highest percentage of points in a 30-game season (93.33%), dropping only six points and finishing the league without defeats, for the first time in its history.
Eight years after the 2003 triumph, Porto returned to the UEFA Cup (renamed UEFA Europa League) and reached the final in Dublin&#x27;s Aviva Stadium. In an all-Portuguese affair, Porto beat Braga with a goal from the competition&#x27;s top goalscorer Falcao and lifted the trophy for the second time, as Villas-Boas became the youngest UEFA competition-winning coach. Four days later, Porto won its third consecutive Taça de Portugal with a convincing 6–2 scoreline, securing their fourth trophy of the season.

As Villas-Boas left for Chelsea, Porto recruited the services of his assistant, Vítor Pereira. For the third straight year, the club began the season with another Supertaça title, which was followed by a 2–0 loss to Barcelona for the 2011 UEFA Super Cup. Although lacking the goalscoring prolificacy of Falcao (sold to Atlético Madrid), Porto was able to revalidate the Primeira Liga title, but was eliminated prematurely from the Taça and Champions League competitions. Transferred to the Europa League, Porto failed to defend its title after being knocked out by Manchester City.
In the following season, the club went a stage further in both domestic cup competitions and in the Champions League, where it fell to Málaga in the last-16 round. In the 2012–13 Primeira Liga, Porto reduced the distance to leaders Benfica to two points, before hosting them in the penultimate matchday. In a dramatic turn of events, Porto won with a goal in stoppage time and moved to the top of the league table. An away victory in the last game confirmed the &quot;Tri&quot; and Porto&#x27;s 27th league title – the second without defeats.

Porto entered the 2013–14 season with a new head coach – Paulo Fonseca, signed from 2012 to 2013 Primeira Liga third-placed Paços de Ferreira – but continued the trend of the previous four seasons by winning the Supertaça. This title would be the highlight of the season, as the club underperformed in every other competition it was involved. In the league, Porto led with five points over its pursuers, but a series of compromising results pushed the club down to third place, resulting in the sacking of Fonseca. Failing to overcome the Champions League group stage, Porto reached the Europa League quarter-finals, where they lost 4–1 to the eventual winners Sevilla. In the following weeks, two semi-final losses against Benfica closed the doors to the finals of the Taça de Portugal and Taça da Liga, the latter at home on penalties.

Porto started the 2014–15 season with their biggest budget ever, hiring Spanish head coach Julen Lopetegui. Despite the signing of many new players, they failed to win any silverware, contributing to the biggest hiatus during Pinto da Costa&#x27;s presidency. They also equalized, in terms of goals conceded, their biggest defeat in European competitions (6–1 against AEK Athens) and suffered their biggest defeat in the UEFA Champions League (6–1 against Bayern Munich, after the 5–0 loss against Arsenal in 2010). Porto continued their losing trend in the 2015–16 season, making it the second consecutive trophyless season, with the contribution of José Peseiro, who had replaced Julen Lopetegui in January 2016. After the season was over, Peseiro was replaced by Nuno Espírito Santo.

===Conceição era (2017–2024)===

In the 2017–18 season, after almost five years without winning any trophy, Porto won their 28th league title with the contribution of coach Sérgio Conceição, a former player of the club. The following year, in the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League, Porto managed to reach the quarter-finals of the competition, but were defeated by 6–1 on aggregate against the eventual winners Liverpool.

In the 2019–20 season, Porto managed to recapture the league title, winning it for the 29th time and added for the first time in eleven years the Portuguese cup along with it. However, despite their national success, FC Porto did not reach the group phase of the Champions League and did poorly in their Europa League campaign.

In the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League round of 16, Porto won on away goals rule (4–4 on aggregate) against Juventus, to reach the quarter-finals. The season would, however, end with only one national trophy, the Supertaça.

After having lost the national title to Sporting in the previous season, Porto&#x27;s 2021–22 season saw them reach various successes at domestic level: with Conceição at the helm for the 5th season in a row, the team recaptured the Primeira Liga, achieving a record 91 points. During the season, the Dragons also set a new record for longest unbeaten run in the league, with 58 matches, a sequence that had been started during the first half of the 2020–21 edition. One week after the league&#x27;s conclusion, they added the domestic cup, thus securing the second double in Conceição&#x27;s reign.

On 28 January 2023, still under Conceição, and on their fifth try, Porto won their first ever Taça da Liga title, defeating Sporting CP in the final, thus winning every national trophy available. On 17 December 2023, the team qualified (along with Benfica) to the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup for the first time, as they were the highest-ranked Portuguese club in the UEFA 4-year ranking. At the end of the 2023–2024 season, after having won the Taça de Portugal and coached the team for seven years, Conceição was let go by the newly elected president of FC Porto, Andre Villas-Boas.

=== New club president, André Villas-Boas (2024 – present) ===
On 27 April 2024, André Villas-Boas, who had coached Porto during the 2010–2011 season, was elected the 32º president of Futebol Clube do Porto, succeeding Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa. He won 80% of the election, with 21,489 out of 26,876 votes. Villas-Boas was keen on making immediate changes at the club, starting with selecting a new coach, Vitor Bruno, who had previously served as the assistant coach under Sérgio Conceição at Porto. Villas-Boas introduced the first women&#x27;s football team to represent FC Porto, incentivized the promotion of several B team and U-19 players to the main team, and the creation of initiatives to bring the fans closer to the club.

==Crest and kit==

The club&#x27;s first crest was created in 1910 and consisted of an old blue football with white seams bearing the club name&#x27;s initials in white. On 26 October 1922, the crest was changed to its present-day appearance after the club approved a design by Augusto Baptista Ferreira (nicknamed &quot;Simplício&quot;), a graphical artist and one of the club&#x27;s players. In his proposal, the city&#x27;s coat of arms – consisting at the time of a quartered shield (first and fourth quadrants: national arms; second and third quadrants: image of Our Lady holding baby Jesus and flanked by two towers holding above a banner with the Latin words &quot;Civitas Virginis&quot;) surrounded by the collar of the Order of the Tower and Sword and topped by a crown supporting a green dragon with a red banner inscribed with &quot;Invicta&quot; (Undefeated [city]) – was added on top of the old crest, pushing the white letters down.

In 1906, the club&#x27;s first official team wore kits with a variety of colors and patterns, which included white shirts with red collars or vertical blue stripes, and even red shirts. This indefinition in the equipment was only solved in 1909, when through the initiative of Monteiro da Costa, Porto stipulated in its first statutes that the players had to use &quot;a shirt with blue vertical stripes, black shorts, and personal footwear&quot; as the club&#x27;s uniform, at every training and match. Some argued that the kit should have included the city colours, green and white. Monteiro da Costa, however, defended the blue-and-white combination because he believed the colors &quot;should be those of the country&#x27;s flag, and not of the city&#x27;s flag&quot;, hoping that the club would &quot;not only defend the good name of the city, but also that of Portugal, in sporting feuds against foreigners.&quot;

In 1975, Adidas became the first sports apparel manufacturers to provide kits for the club. Eight years later, Porto became the first Portuguese team to have a shirt sponsor, after signing a deal with Revigrés worth 10 million escudos per year. This deal lasted for 20 years, with successive renovations, after which the national communications corporation Portugal Telecom (PT) became the new shirt sponsors. Still, Revigrés remain as one of the club&#x27;s main and longest-serving collaborators.

==Home stadiums==

The club&#x27;s first ground was the &quot;Campo da Rainha&quot; (Queen&#x27;s Field), inaugurated in 1906 with an exhibition game against Boavista. The site was located near the residence of Monteiro da Costa and was the property of the city&#x27;s horticultural society. Aided by his father, a horticultor by profession, Monteiro da Costa rented a portion (30 by 50 meters) of uncultivated terrain to create the first dedicated football pitch in the country. Later that year, the society&#x27;s vivaria were transferred to another location, allowing Porto to increase the pitch area to match the sport&#x27;s official dimensions. The ground had capacity for 600 people, including a VIP tribune, and possessed a changing room equipped with showers and sinks, a bar and a gym. The first match between Porto and a foreign team took place at the &quot;Campo da Raínha&quot;, on 15 December 1907, when the hosts played Spanish side Real Fortuna.

By 1911, the &quot;Campo da Raínha&quot; was becoming too small for the rapidly growing attendances. After being notified about the sale of the ground for construction of a factory, the club searched for a new ground and rented a terrain near the &quot;Constituição&quot; street for an annual fee of 350$00. The &quot;Campo da Constituição&quot; (Constitution Field) was opened in January 1913 with a match against Oporto Cricket and Lawn Tennis Club and hosted Porto&#x27;s home matches for the regional championship. Eventually, the larger capacity of this ground also became insufficient for the ever-increasing crowds attending the games, particularly against high-profile opponents. On several occasions, between the 1920s and 1940s, Porto played host to matches at the &quot;Campo do Ameal&quot; (Ameal Field) or the &quot;Estádio do Lima&quot; (Lima Stadium), home of local rivals Sport Progresso and Académico, respectively. It was in the latter ground that the club achieved their most important victory at the time, as they beat English champions Arsenal 3–2 in a friendly match on 7 May 1948.
In 1933, Porto approved a plan to build a new stadium to accommodate and meet the demands of larger attendances, but the project only moved forward with the purchase of of land in the eastern side of the city in 1947. Designed by Portuguese architects Oldemiro Carneiro and Aires de Sá, the construction of the &quot;Estádio do Futebol Clube do Porto&quot; – better known as &quot;Estádio das Antas&quot; (Antas Stadium) for the neighbourhood where it was built – began in January 1950, one month after the first stone was symbolically laid. Two years later, on 28 May 1952, the stadium was inaugurated with a ceremony, featuring the presence of the President of the Republic Francisco Craveiro Lopes, and a match against Benfica, which Porto lost 2–8. The stadium&#x27;s initial layout had an open east sector (Marathon Door), which was closed in 1976 with the construction of a two-tier stand that raised the capacity to 70,000. In 1986, works to lower the pitch and build an additional tier in the place of the athletics and cycling track were concluded, setting the capacity to a new maximum of 95,000. As stadium safety regulations became stricter during the following decade, the placing of individual seats brought the capacity of the Estádio das Antas down to 55,000 by 1997.

The awarding of the UEFA Euro 2004 hosting rights to Portugal in 1999 was the perfect opportunity for Porto to move into a more modern, functional and comfortable stadium, in line with the demands of high-level international football. The club decided to build an entirely new ground and chose a site located a few hundreds of meters southeast of the Estádio das Antas. The project was commissioned to Portuguese architect Manuel Salgado, and construction took two years to complete at a cost of €98 million. Baptised &quot;Estádio do Dragão&quot; (Dragon Stadium) by president Pinto da Costa, for the mythological creature placed atop the club&#x27;s crest, it was officially inaugurated on 16 November 2003 with a match against Barcelona. Porto won 2–0 in front of a record 52,000 spectators, which also witnessed the professional debut of Lionel Messi. In June 2004, the venue hosted the opening ceremony and match of the UEFA Euro 2004, and four other tournament matches. The highest attendance in an official match was registered on 21 April 2004, when 50,818 people saw Porto draw Deportivo La Coruña without goals, for the first leg of the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League semi-finals. For safety reasons, its current capacity is limited to 50,431.

===Museum===

On 28 September 2013 The FC Porto Museum was inaugurated, on occasion of the club&#x27;s 120th anniversary. The museum includes an auditorium, a club store, a coffeehouse, and spaces for educational services and temporary exhibitions.

==Rivalries==

Porto&#x27;s biggest rivalries are with the other Big Three members and regular league title contenders, Benfica and Sporting CP. They stem from the historical, political, economical and cultural clash between the cities of Porto and Lisbon, where the other two clubs are based. These rivalries became more intense in the past decades, particularly since Pinto da Costa assumed Porto&#x27;s presidency in 1982 and adopted a regionalistic and confrontational speech towards Lisbon. In the following years, the club began establishing its dominance in Portuguese football, at the expense of Benfica and Sporting, who had been the traditional powers since the 1940s.

To Porto, the rivalry with Benfica is the strongest and most passionate, and it opposes the most representative football emblems from each city as well as the current most titled Portuguese clubs. The first match between Porto and Benfica – traditionally referred to as &quot;O Clássico&quot; (The Classic) – took place on 28 April 1912, and ended with a 2–8 win for Benfica; Porto&#x27;s first victory (3–2) came only in 1920. As of the end of the 2014–15 season, the clubs have faced each other in 232 competitive matches, which have resulted in 89 wins for Porto, 86 for Benfica and 57 draws.

The first meeting between Porto and Sporting CP occurred on 30 November 1919, during a friendly tournament organised by Porto. Their first official encounter was in the first leg of the final of the inaugural Campeonato de Portugal in 1922, which Porto won 2–1 en route to its first national title. Since then, the clubs have met in 221 official matches, with 80 wins for Porto, 78 for Sporting CP and 63 draws. Despite the rivalry, both clubs formed an alliance against Benfica in 2017.

The club also has a strong rivalry with city rivals Boavista, called &quot;Dérbi da Invicta&quot;.

==Records and statistics==
Former defender João Pinto holds the record for most matches played in all competitions (587) and in the Primeira Liga (408), while former goalkeeper Vítor Baía has the most appearances in international competitions (99). Baía is also the most titled player, having won 25 trophies during his career in Porto. Portuguese striker Fernando Gomes is the all-time club goalscorer in all competitions (352), having also scored the most league goals (288). In European competitions, Porto&#x27;s record goalscorer is Radamel Falcao, with 22 goals.

José Maria Pedroto is the longest-serving coach, having taken charge of the team for 327 matches in nine seasons, while Jesualdo Ferreira became the first Portuguese coach to win three consecutive league titles (2006–2009). André Villas-Boas&#x27;s victorious campaign in the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League made him the youngest coach ever to win a European competition.

The 2010–11 season was particularly strong in record achievements. Porto played the most matches (58) and secured the most wins (49) and highest winning percentage (84.4%). For the league, it had the most consecutive wins (16) and suffered the fewest defeats (none). In Europe, the club won the most matches (14 in 17) and scored the most goals (44) en route to the UEFA Europa League title – one of a record-matching four.

In April 2022, Porto set a national record of 58 matches without defeats in the Primeira Liga after losing 1–0 to Braga for the first time since the end of October 2020. The team also matched the same unbeaten league run (58) as AC Milan and Olympiacos achieved in their respective domestic leagues.

===UEFA club coefficient ranking===


==Honours==
 Porto have 86 major trophies in senior football. Domestically, they have won 30 Portuguese league titles, 20 Taça de Portugal, 1 Taça da Liga, 4 Campeonato de Portugal (a record shared with Sporting CP), and a record 24 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira. Porto is the most decorated Portuguese team in international competitions, having won two European Cup/UEFA Champions League, two UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League, one UEFA Super Cup and two Intercontinental Cup trophies. In addition, it is the only Portuguese team to have won either the UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Super Cup or the Intercontinental Cup.

Porto have achieved four titles in a single season on two occasions: in 1987–88 (UEFA Super Cup, Intercontinental Cup, Primeira Liga and Taça de Portugal) and in 2010–11 (Supertaça, Primeira Liga, UEFA Europa League and Taça de Portugal). The latter also included the club&#x27;s second continental treble, after the one achieved in 2002–03 (Primeira Liga, Taça de Portugal and UEFA Cup). The club also reached the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final in 1983–84 (losing to Juventus) and made three more appearances in the UEFA Super Cup (2003, 2004 and 2011).
