<text>Corps (; plural &quot;corps&quot; ; from French , from the Latin &quot;body&quot;) is a term used for several different kinds of organization. A military innovation by Napoleon I, the formation was formally introduced March 1, 1800, when Napoleon ordered General Jean Victor Marie Moreau to divide his command into four corps. The size of a corps varies greatly, but two to five divisions and anywhere from 40,000 to 80,000 are the numbers stated by the US Department of Defense.

Within military terminology a corps may be:
*an operational formation, sometimes known as a field corps, which consists of two or more divisions, such as the , later known as (&quot;First Corps&quot;) of Napoleon I&#x27;s );
*an administrative corps (or mustering) – that is a specialized branch of a military service (such as an artillery corps, an armoured corps, a signal corps, a medical corps, a marine corps, or a corps of military police) or;
*in some cases, a distinct service within a national military (such as the United States Marine Corps).
These usages often overlap.

Corps may also be a generic term for a non-military organization, such as the US Peace Corps and European Solidarity Corps.

==Military usage==
===Operational formation===
In many armies, a corps is a battlefield formation composed of two or more divisions, and typically commanded by a lieutenant general. During World War I and World War II, due to the large scale of combat, multiple corps were combined into armies which then formed into army groups. In Western armies with numbered corps, the number is often indicated in Roman numerals (e.g., VII Corps).

====Australia and New Zealand====
The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps was raised in 1914, consisting of Australian and New Zealand troops, who went on to fight at Gallipoli in 1915. In early 1916, the original corps was reorganized and two corps were raised: I ANZAC Corps and II ANZAC Corps. In the later stages of World War I, the five infantry divisions of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF)—consisting entirely of personnel who had volunteered for service overseas—were united as the Australian Corps, on the Western Front, under Lieutenant General Sir John Monash.

During World War II, the Australian I Corps was formed to co-ordinate three Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) units: the 6th, 7th and 9th Divisions, as well as other Allied units on some occasions, in the North African campaign and Greek campaign. Following the commencement of the Pacific War, there was a phased withdrawal of I Corps to Australia, and the transfer of its headquarters to the Brisbane area, to control Allied army units in Queensland and northern New South Wales (NSW). II Corps was also formed, with Militia units, to defend south-eastern Australia, and III Corps controlled land forces in Western Australia. Sub-corps formations controlled Allied land forces in the remainder of Australia. I Corps headquarters was later assigned control of the New Guinea campaign. In early 1945, when I Corps was assigned the task of re-taking Borneo, II Corps took over in New Guinea.

====Canada====
Canada first fielded a corps-sized formation in the First World War; the Canadian Corps was unique in that its composition did not change from inception to the war&#x27;s end, in contrast to British corps in France and Flanders. The Canadian Corps consisted of four Canadian divisions. After the Armistice, the peacetime Canadian militia was nominally organized into corps and divisions but no full-time formations larger than a battalion were ever trained or exercised. Early in the Second World War, Canada&#x27;s contribution to the British-French forces fighting the Germans was limited to a single division. After the fall of France in June 1940, a second division moved to England, coming under command of a Canadian corps headquarters. This corps was renamed I Canadian Corps as a second corps headquarters was established in the UK, with the eventual formation of five Canadian divisions in England. I Canadian Corps eventually fought in Italy, II Canadian Corps in northwest Europe, and the two were reunited in early 1945. After the formations were disbanded after VE Day, Canada has never subsequently organized a corps headquarters.

Royal Canadian Army Cadets: A corps size in the RCAC is different everywhere, depending on the size. The commanding officer can be a captain (Previously, Commanding Officers of a large corps could have been a Major, but that capability has been removed with the creation of CJCR Group Order 5511-1)

====China====
The National Revolutionary Army (NRA) corps () was a type of military organization used by the Chinese Republic, and usually exercised command over two to three NRA divisions and often a number of independent brigades or regiments and supporting units. The Chinese Republic had 133 corps during the Second Sino-Japanese War. After losses in the early part of the war, under the 1938 reforms, the remaining scarce artillery and the other support formations were withdrawn from the division and was held at corps, or army level or higher. The corps became the basic tactical unit of the NRA having strength nearly equivalent to an allied division.

The modern People&#x27;s Liberation Army Ground Force group army () is the closest equivalent of a corps. After the military reforms of the early 2010s, a typical PLA group army consists of six combined arms brigades, plus additional artillery, air defence, engineering, sustainment, special operations and army aviation assets. Each formation contains approximately 30,000 combat troops and several thousands more supporting personnel.

====France====
The French Army under Napoleon I used corps-sized formations () as the first formal combined-arms groupings of divisions with reasonably stable manning and equipment establishments. Napoleon I first used the in 1805. The use of the was a military innovation that provided Napoleon I with a significant battlefield advantage in the early phases of the Napoleonic Wars. The corps was designed to be an independent military group containing cavalry, artillery and infantry, and capable of defending against a numerically superior foe. This allowed Napoleon I to mass the bulk of his forces to effect a penetration into a weak section of enemy lines without risking his own communications or flank. This innovation stimulated other European powers to adopt similar military structures. The corps has remained an echelon of French Army organization to the modern day.

====Germany====
As fixed military formation already in peace-time it was used almost in all European armies after Battle of Ulm in 1805. In Prussia it was introduced by &quot;Order of His Majesty&quot; () from 5 November 1816, in order to strengthen the readiness to war.

====India====
The Indian Army has 14 corps, each commanded by a general officer commanding (GOC), known as the corps commander, who holds the rank of lieutenant general. Each corps is composed of three or four divisions. There are three types of corps in the Indian Army: strike, holding and mixed. The corps HQ is the highest field formation in the army.

====Pakistan====
The Pakistan Army has nine manoeuvre corps, each commanded by a lieutenant general. Each corps is composed of at least two divisions. The corps HQ is the highest field formation in the army.

====Poland (1938–1939)====
The Polish Armed Forces used independent operational groups in the place of the corps before and during World War II. An example would be Independent Operational Group Polesie. The groups, as the name indicates, were more flexible and showed greater capacity to absorb and integrate elements of broken units over a period of just a couple days and keep cohesion during the September Campaign than more traditional army units such as divisions, regiments, or even brigades.

====United Kingdom====
Wellington formed a in 1815 for commanding his mixed allied force of four divisions against Napoleon I.

When the British Army was expanded from an expeditionary force in the First World War, corps were created to manage the large numbers of divisions. The British corps in World War I included 23 infantry corps and a few mounted corps. The word was adopted for other special formations such as the Officers Training Corps. Military training of teenage boys is undertaken at secondary schools through the Combined Cadet Force, in which participation was compulsory at some schools in the 1950s. Schoolboy jargon called the CCF simply &quot;Corps&quot;.

The British Army still has a corps headquarters for operational control of forces. I Corps of the British Army of the Rhine was redesignated the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps in 1994. It is no longer a purely British formation, although the UK is the &quot;framework nation&quot; and provides most of the staff for the headquarters. A purely national Corps headquarters could be quickly reconstituted if necessary.

It took command of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan on 4 May 2006. Previously, it was deployed as the headquarters commanding land forces during the Kosovo War in 1999 and also saw service in Bosnia and Herzegovina, commanding the initial stages of the IFOR deployment prior to that in 1996. Otherwise, the only time a British corps headquarters has been operationally deployed since 1945 was II Corps during the Suez Crisis.

==== United States ====

The structure of a field corps in the United States Army is not permanent. On the battlefield, the corps is the highest level of the forces that is concerned with actual combat and operational deployment. Higher levels of command are concerned with administration rather than operations, at least under current doctrine. The corps provides operational direction for the forces under its command.

As of 2014, the active field corps in the US Army are I Corps, III Corps, and XVIII Airborne Corps; their lineages derive from three of the corps formed during World War I (I and III Corps) and World War II (XVIII Airborne Corps). On 12 February 2020, it was announced that the Army was reactivating V Corps to bolster the presence of US forces in Europe.

===== American Civil War =====
The first field corps in the United States Army were legalized during the American Civil War by an act of Congress on 17 July 1862, although the term had been used previously to refer to any large portion of the army. Major General George B. McClellan, for example, planned to organize the Army of the Potomac into corps of two or more divisions and about 25,000 soldiers. However, he delayed doing so, partly for lack of experienced officers, and partly for political reasons, until March 1862 when President Lincoln ordered their creation.

The exact composition of a corps in the Union Army varied during the war, though it usually consisted of between two and six division (on average three) for approximately 36,000 soldiers. After Ambrose Burnside was given command of the Army of the Potomac in November 1862, he reorganized it into three &quot;grand divisions&quot; of two corps and a cavalry division each, but this structure was abolished when Joseph Hooker took over February 1863. This also led to the creation of a dedicated Cavalry Corps of three divisions and horse artillery assigned to the corps headquarters. In the early years of the war, field artillery was either part of an artillery reserve under direct army control or assigned to individual divisions. However, after the Battle of Chancellorsville the divisional artillery was placed under corps control, with each corps assigned a brigade of between four and six batteries commanded by the senior-most artillery officer. In general, the other field armies tended to model their organization after the Army of the Potomac, including the gradual development of corps.

Corps were commanded by major generals because Congress refused to promote officers past that grade (with the exception of Ulysses S. Grant to lieutenant general in 1864). To assist with their command, generals were allowed a number of aides-de-camp and a general staff of other officers. This staff consisted of a chief of cavalry, a chief of artillery, and representatives of the War Department&#x27;s various bureaus: an assistant adjutant general, a quartermaster, an assistant inspector general, a commissary of subsistence, an ordnance officer (all with the rank of lieutenant colonel), and a medical director. However, there were no dedicated combat service support formations as part of the corps. This meant that either civilian workers had to be hired or line soldiers detailed from their units to carry out the necessary tasks.

Initially, corps were numbered in relation to their field army, such as I Army Corps, Army of the Potomac. After a while these numerical designations became unique to each corps regardless of the army to which they were assigned. Although designated with numbers that are sometimes the same as those found in the modern US Army, there is no direct lineage between the 43 Union field corps of the Civil War and those with similar names in the modern era, due to congressional legislation caused by the outcry from veterans of the Grand Army of the Republic during the Spanish–American War.

In the Confederate States Army, field corps were authorized in November 1862. They were commanded by lieutenant generals, and were usually larger than their Union Army counterparts because their divisions contained more brigades, each of which could contain more regiments. All of the Confederate corps at the Battle of Gettysburg, for instance, exceeded 20,000 men. However, for both armies, unit sizes varied dramatically with attrition throughout the war. In Civil War usages, by both sides, it was common to write out the number, thus &quot;Twenty-first Army Corps&quot;, a practice that is usually ignored in modern histories of the war.

===== Spanish–American War =====
Although the US Army in the years following the Civil War lacked standing organization at the corps and division levels, it moved swiftly to adopt these during the mobilization for the Spanish–American War in the spring of 1898. On 7 May, General Order 36 called for the establishment of seven &quot;army corps&quot; (repeating the nomenclature of the Civil War); an eighth was authorized later that month. Two of these saw action as a unit: the Fifth in Cuba and the Eighth in the Philippines; elements of the First, Fourth, and Seventh made up the invasion force for Puerto Rico (the Second, Third, and Seventh provided replacements and occupation troops in Cuba, while the Sixth was never organized). The corps headquarters were disbanded during the months following the signing of the peace treaty (with the exception of the Eighth Army Corps, which remained active until 1900 due to the eruption of the Philippine–American War), and like the corps of the Civil War, their lineage ends at that point.

===== World Wars I and II =====
During World War I, the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) adopted the common European usage of designating field corps by Roman numerals. Several &quot;corps areas&quot; were designated under the authority of the National Defense Act of 1920, but played little role until the Army&#x27;s buildup for World War II. While some of the lower numbered corps were used for various exercises, the inter-war years corps served mostly as a pool of units. During that war, the Marine Corps organized corps headquarters for the first time, the I Marine (later III Amphibious Corps) and V Amphibious Corps. The Army ultimately designated 25 field corps (I–XVI, XVIII–XXIV, XXXVI, and I Armored Corps) during World War II.

=====Cold War and 21st century=====
After the Korean War, the Army and Marines diverged in their approach to the concept of the field corps. The Army continued to group its divisions into traditional corps organizations in the Continental United States (CONUS), West Germany (V Corps and VII Corps), and South Korea (I Corps). However, during the Vietnam War, the Army designated its corps-level headquarters in South Vietnam as I Field Force and II Field Force to avoid confusion with the ARVN corps areas. As of July 2016, the Army deactivated all corps headquarters save three CONUS based corps (I Corps - Washington, III Corps - Texas, and XVIII Airborne Corps - North Carolina).

In the 1960s, the Marine Corps activated the I Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF) on Okinawa (based in California since 1971) and II Marine Expeditionary Force (II MEF) in North Carolina, and re-activated the III Amphibious Corps (which had been deactivated in 1946) as III Marine Expeditionary Force (III MEF) in South Vietnam (re-deployed to Okinawa in 1971). In 1965, all three MEFs were subsequently re-designated as Marine amphibious forces or MAFs, and in 1988 all three Marine Corps corps-level commands were again re-designated as Marine expeditionary forces (MEF). The MEF had evolved into a self-contained, corps-level, Marine air-ground task force (MAGTF) consisting of a MEF headquarters group, a Marine division, a Marine aircraft wing, and a force service support group (re-designated as Marine logistics group in 2005).

====Soviet Union====
The pre–World War II Red Army of the former USSR had rifle corps much like in the Western sense with approximately three divisions to a corps. However, after the war started, the recently purged Soviet senior command (Stavka) structure was apparently unable to handle the formations, and the armies and corps were integrated. Rifle corps were re-established during the war after Red Army commanders had gained experience handling larger formations. Before and during World War II, however, Soviet armoured units were organized into corps. The pre-war mechanized corps were made up of divisions. In the reorganizations, these &quot;corps&quot; were reorganized into tank brigades and support units, with no division structure. Owing to this, they are sometimes, informally, referred to as &quot;brigade buckets&quot;.

After the war, the tank and mechanized corps were re-rated as divisions. During the reforms of 1956–58, most of the corps were again disbanded to create the new combined arms and tank armies. A few corps were nevertheless retained. The Vyborg and Archangel Corps of the Leningrad Military District were smaller armies with three low-readiness motorized rifle divisions each. In the 1980s &quot;Unified Corps&quot; on the brigade pattern were created in the Belorussian Military District (Western TVD/Strategic Direction) and the 48th Separate Guards Army Corps in the Transbaikal Military District, but abandoned after a few years.

The Soviet Air Forces used ground terminology for its formations down to squadron level. As intermediates between the aviation division and the air army were corps—these also had three air divisions each.

=====Air Defence Corps=====
An Air Defence Corps (&#x27;KPVO&#x27;) is an operational-tactical formation (in the past - the highest tactical formation) of the former Soviet Air Defence Forces and now Russian Air Defence Forces/Aerospace Forces. The purpose of the such a corps is to protect important administrative, industrial and economic centers and regions of the country, groupings of troops (forces) and military facilities within the established limits of responsibility against air strikes. In organizational terms, an air defence corps is part of the district (or a separate army) of the Air Defence Forces. Also some air defence corps were separate.
On the basis of individual corps, &quot;air defence zones&quot; or &quot;air defence corps areas&quot; could be created. The first &quot;KPVO&quot; were created in February 1938 for the air defence of Moscow, Leningrad and Baku (respectively 1st, 2nd and 3rd) based on anti-aircraft artillery divisions and air defence brigade (&quot;3rd KPVO&quot;). The staff of the &quot;KPVO&quot; included: 4-6 anti-aircraft artillery regiments, 1 anti-aircraft machine-gun regiment, 1 searchlight regiment (or battalion), 1-2 regiments (or divisions) barrage balloons, 1- 2 regiments (or battalions) of visual observation, warning and communications (VNOS), and a separate communications battalion. From September 1938 to November 1940, the &quot;KPVO&quot; also included 1-2 regiments (battalions) of local air defence.
During the Great Patriotic War from November 1941 to April 1944 the air defence corps were renamed into air defence corps areas (such as the Stalingrad Corps Region). The corps districts included up to 9 anti-aircraft artillery regiments and 14 separate anti-aircraft artillery battalions, up to 3 anti-aircraft machine-gun regiments, 1 searchlight regiment, 1 regiment (or division) of barrage balloons, up to 4 regiments (or separate battalions) VNOS, and a communications regiment (or a separate battalion). In 1945, air defence corps could include 1 anti-aircraft artillery brigade or division.

Air defence fighters operating within the limits of responsibility of the &quot;KPVO&quot; was transferred to the corps. By the end of the war, there were 14 &quot;KPVO&quot; in the Active Army, of which 5 corps continued to carry out the tasks assigned to them even after the war, and the rest of the corps were disbanded.

In July 1947, all &quot;KPVO&quot; were renamed anti-aircraft artillery corps. In January 1949, part of these corps was reorganized into &quot;air defence areas.&quot; From December 1948 to January 1949, all anti-aircraft artillery corps were disbanded.

In June 1954, for the defense of the main industrial and economic centers and regions of the USSR, 10 air defence corps were re-created. At the same time, in addition to anti-aircraft artillery formations, fighter aviation regiments and divisions were included in the corps. Since the late 1950s, anti-aircraft artillery units have been replaced by anti-aircraft missile formations and formations of radio engineering troops. Searchlight and barrage balloon units were also abolished.

In the Warsaw Pact countries, groupings similar to the Soviet air defence corps were also created. In June–July 1960, all &quot;KPVO&quot; were enlarged and consisted of: anti-aircraft missile regiments and brigades, air defense fighter regiments, radio engineering regiments and brigades, separate electronic warfare battalions, regiments and battalions of communications and logistics institutions.

===Administrative corps===
In many English-speaking countries and other countries influenced by British military traditions, a corps is also a grouping of personnel by common function, also known as an arm, service, mustering or branch.

====Britain====
In the British Army, an administrative corps performs much the same role – for personnel that otherwise lack them – as a ceremonial regiment. An administrative corps therefore has its own cap badge, stable belt, and other insignia and traditions. 
*Intelligence Corps
*RAF Regiment
*Royal Logistic Corps
*Corps of Royal Marines
*Royal Corps of Signals
In some cases, the term corps is also used informally, for looser groupings of independent regiments and other units – and without many or any unifying regalia, military traditions or other accoutrements – such as the Royal Armoured Corps or the &quot;Corps of Infantry&quot;.

====Australia====
In Australia, soldiers belong foremost to a corps which defines a common function or employment across the army. The Australian Army has a system of coloured lanyards, which each identify a soldier as part of a specific corps (or sometimes individual battalion). This lanyard is a woven piece of cord which is worn on ceremonial uniforms and dates back to the issue of clasp knives in the early 20th century which were secured to the uniform by a length of cord.

If a soldier is posted to a unit outside of their parent corps, except in some circumstances the soldier continues to wear the hat badge and lanyard of their corps (e.g. a clerk posted to an infantry battalion would wear the hat badge of the Royal Australian Ordnance Corps but would wear the lanyard of the battalion they are posted to).

====Canada====
In Canada, with the integration of the Canadian Army into the Canadian Forces, the British corps model was replaced with personnel branches, defined in Canadian Forces Administrative Orders (CFAOs) as &quot;...cohesive professional groups...based on similarity of military roles, customs and traditions.&quot; &quot;CFAO 2-10)&quot; However, the Armour Branch continued to use the title Royal Canadian Armoured Corps, the Infantry Branch continued to use the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps designation, and the Artillery Branch uses the term Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery.

When the Army, Royal Canadian Navy, and Royal Canadian Air Force were merged in 1968 to form the Canadian Forces, the Royal Canadian Dental Corps and Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps were deactivated and merged with their Naval and Air Force counterparts to form the Dental Branch (Canadian Forces) and the Canadian Forces Medical Service of the Canadian Forces Health Services Group (CF H Svcs Gp). The Royal Canadian Army Service Corps transport and supply elements were combined with the Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps to form the Logistics Branch The Royal Canadian Army Service Corps clerical trades were merged with the Royal Canadian Army Pay Corps and the Royal Canadian Postal Corps to form the Administration Branch (later merged with the Logistics Branch) 

Other &quot;corps&quot;, included: Canadian Engineer Corps, Signalling Corps, Corps of Guides, Canadian Women&#x27;s Army Corps, Royal Canadian Army Veterinary Corps, Canadian Forestry Corps, Canadian Provost Corps and Canadian Intelligence Corps.

====India====
Administrative corps in the Indian Army include:

*Army Armoured Corps
*Army Aviation Corps
*Army Dental Corps
*Army Education Corps
*Army Medical Corps
*Army Ordnance Corps
*Army Postal Service Corps
*Army Service Corps
*Corps of Army Air Defence
*Corps of Electronics and Mechanical Engineers
*Corps of Engineers
*Corps of Military Police
*Corps of Signals
*Defence Security Corps
*Intelligence Corps
*Pioneer Corps
*Remount and Veterinary Corps

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, soldiers belong foremost to a corps which defines a common function or employment across the army.

A corps in the New Zealand Army is an administrative group that comprises members of similar work functions.

If a soldier is posted to a unit outside of their parent corps, except in some circumstances the soldier continues to wear the hat badge of their corps (e.g. a supply technician posted to an infantry battalion would wear the hat badge of the Royal New Zealand Army Logistic Regiment.

====United States====
The Department of Defense; the Department of Transportation; and the United States Department of Health and Human Services use &quot;corps&quot; administratively in several ways.

1) In the title of the United States Marine Corps, &quot;Corps&quot; is used as a service-branch designator, in much the same way as &quot;Force&quot; and &quot;Guard&quot; are used for the US Air Force and US Coast Guard.

2) The US Army (all components; Regular Army, Army Reserve, and Army National Guard) uses administrative &quot;corps&quot;, also known as &quot;army branches&quot;, to group personnel with a common function. These include the Acquisition Corps, Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps, Chaplain Corps, Chemical Corps, Civil Affairs Corps, Cyber Corps, Dental Corps*, Corps of Engineers, Finance Corps, Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps, Logistics Corps, Medical Corps*, Medical Service Corps*, Medical Specialist Corps*, Military Intelligence Corps, Military Police Corps, Nurse Corps*, Ordnance Corps, Psychological Operations Corps, Quartermaster Corps, Signal Corps, Transportation Corps, and Veterinary Corps.* Each of these corps is also considered a &quot;regiment&quot; for purposes of: &quot;... affiliation, ... loyalty and commitment, ... sense of belonging, ... unit esprit, and ... war fighting ethos.&quot; However, these regiments have no tactical function. The six corps (annotated by an asterisk above after each applicable corps&#x27; name) of the Army Medical Department (AMEDD) are included in the AMEDD Regiment

3) US Navy officers who are not &quot;line officers&quot; (i.e., those who exercise general command authority and are eligible for operational command positions, as opposed to officers who normally exercise authority only within their own specialty) are commissioned into various &quot;Staff Corps&quot;. These officers are specialists in career fields that are professions unto themselves, such as ministers, civil engineers, architects, dentists, lawyers, physicians, healthcare administrators, healthcare scientists, clinical care providers, nurses, financial managers, and logistics and supply specialists. These &quot;corps&quot; include the Chaplain Corps, Civil Engineer Corps, Dental Corps*, Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps, Medical Corps*, Medical Service Corps*, Nurse Corps*, and the Supply Corps. The Navy also has a Hospital Corps consisting of enlisted medical technicians. The Hospital Corps, along with the four Navy health services corps listed above (indicated by asterisk), is one of the five corps of the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery.

4) The US Air Force uses the title &quot;corps&quot; to designate several non-tactical organizations. These corps include five distinct health services corps of the United States Air Force Medical Service (AFMS). The AFMS corps are the Biomedical Sciences Corps, Dental Corps, Medical Corps, Medical Service Corps, and Nurse Corps. The Air Force also has its own Chaplain Corps and Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps.

5) In the US Armed Forces, the term &quot;corps&quot; is also used in a general sense to mean the collective membership of a specified military body. Those uses include: the &quot;Officer Corps&quot; and &quot;Noncommissioned Officer Corps&quot; (NCO Corps) of the armed forces, either collectively or individually by branch of service; the &quot;United States Corps of Cadets&quot; at the United States Military Academy and the &quot;United States Coast Guard Corps of Cadets&quot; of the United States Coast Guard Academy; the overall program title and aggregate collection of cadets and midshipmen enrolled in the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) of the several services (i.e., Army ROTC, Navy ROTC, and Air Force ROTC), as well as the cadet organizations of the six federally recognized United States Senior Military Colleges (The Citadel, Norwich University, Texas A&amp;M University, the University of North Georgia, the Virginia Military Institute, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University); and the members of the Naval Sea Cadet Corps.

==Non-military use==
The ambassadors, consuls and other foreign embassy staff in a country are collectively referred to as the diplomatic corps (). In Australia, embassy vehicles have licence plates beginning with the letters DC (or DX).

The Salvation Army calls its local units/church &quot;corps&quot; (e.g. The Rockford Temple Corps, The St. Petersburg Citadel Corps), echoing the pseudomilitary name and structure of the organization.

In the United Kingdom, the Royal Observer Corps was a civil defence unit from 1925 until disbanded in 1995.

In the US, there are non-military, administrative, training and certification corps for commissioned officers of the government&#x27;s uniformed services, such as the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps.

Many volunteer municipal or university ambulance, rescue, and first-aid squads are known as VACs (volunteer ambulance corps). Prominent examples are the Order of Malta (the largest in Ireland), Hatzolah (largest VAC network worldwide), Hackensack VAC. The usage of the term &quot;ambulance corps&quot; dates to American Civil War Major General George B. McClellan&#x27;s General Order No 147 to create an &quot;ambulance corps&quot; within the Union Army. GO 147 used &quot;corps&quot; in one of its standard military senses. However, subsequent formations of non-military ambulance squads continued to use the term, even where they adhere less to paramilitary organizational structure.

The Peace Corps was organized by the United States as an &quot;army&quot; of volunteers.

Some non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are known as corps. Examples include Global Health Corps and Mercy Corps.

A patent examiner in the US is a member of the Examiner Corps.

<doc id="166679" wikidata="Q1051736" url="?curid=166679" title="Cavalier poet">
<text>The cavalier poets was a school of English poets of the 17th century, that came from the classes that supported King Charles I during the English Civil War (1642–1651). Charles, a connoisseur of the fine arts, supported poets who created the art he craved. These poets in turn grouped themselves with the King and his service, thus becoming cavalier poets.

A cavalier was traditionally a mounted soldier or knight, but when the term was applied to those who supported Charles, it was meant to portray them as roistering gallants. The term was thus meant to belittle and insult. They were separate in their lifestyle and divided on religion from the Roundheads, who supported Parliament, consisting often of Puritans (either Presbyterians or Independents).

The best known of the cavalier poets are Robert Herrick, Richard Lovelace, Thomas Carew, and Sir John Suckling. Most of the cavalier poets were courtiers, with notable exceptions. For example, Robert Herrick was not a courtier, but his style marks him as a cavalier poet.

== Characteristics ==
Cavalier poetry is different from traditional poetry in its subject matter. Instead of tackling issues like religion, philosophy, and the arts, cavalier poetry aims to express the joy and simple gratification of celebratory things much livelier than the traditional works of their predecessors. The intent of their works was often to promote the crown (particularly Charles I), and cavalier poets spoke outwardly against the Roundheads who supported the rebellion of the Rump Parliament against the crown. Most cavalier works had allegorical and/or classical references. They drew upon the knowledge of Horace, Cicero, and Ovid. By using these resources they were able to produce poetry that impressed King Charles I. The Cavalier Poets strove to create poetry where both pleasure and virtue thrived. They were rich in reference to the ancients as well as pleasing. Commonly held traits certainly exist in cavalier poetry in that most poems &quot;celebrate beauty, love, nature, sensuality, drinking, good fellowship, honor, and social life.&quot; In many ways, this poetry embodies an attitude that mirrors &quot;carpe diem.&quot; Cavalier poets certainly wrote to promote Royalist principles in favor of the crown, but their themes ran deeper than that. Cavalier poets wrote in a way that promoted seizing the day and the opportunities presented to them and their kinsmen. They wanted to revel in society and come to be the best that they possibly could within the bounds of that society. This endorsement of living life to the fullest, for Cavalier writers, often included gaining material wealth and having sex with women. These themes contributed to the triumphant and boisterous tone and attitude of the poetry. Platonic Love was also another characteristic of cavalier poetry, where the man would show his divine love to a woman, where she would be worshipped as a creature of perfection. As such it was common to hear praise of womanly virtues as though they were divine.

Cavalier poetry is closely linked to the Royalist cause in that the main intent of their poetry was to glorify the crown. In this way, cavalier poetry is often grouped in a political category of poetry. While most of the poetry written by these cavalier poets does advocate the cause of the monarchy in some way, not all of the writers we now consider cavalier poets knew that they fell under this categorization during their lifetime. Cavalier poetry began to be recognized as its own genre with the beginning of the English Civil War in 1642 when men began to write in defense of the crown. However, authors like Thomas Carew and Sir John Suckling died years before the war began, yet are still classified as cavalier poets for the political nature of their poetry. Once the conflict began between the monarchy and the rebellious parliament, the content of the poetry became much more specifically aimed at upholding Royalist ideals. These men were considered by many to write in a nostalgic tone in that their work promoted the principles and practices of the monarchy that was under philosophical and, eventually, literal attack.

There was also a celebration of the monarchy of Charles I among the cavalier poets. Jonson in particular celebrated ideas of common sense, duty, moderation, propriety, and elegance (which he also practiced). These ideas did not belong to the ancients but rather belonged to the court and to England. In this way although the cavaliers embraced the old ways of thinking from the ancients, they also incorporated their own ideas and thoughts into their poetry. This made their writings applicable for the era they were writing in and also portrayed the greatness of the crown and of Charles.

Other characteristics of cavalier poetry were the metaphor and fantasy.

==Issues of classification==
According to &quot;The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia&quot;

The foremost poets of the Jacobean era, Ben Jonson and John Donne, are regarded as the originators of two diverse poetic traditions—the Cavalier and the metaphysical styles.

English poets of the early seventeenth century are crudely classified by the division into Cavaliers and metaphysical poets, the latter (for example John Donne) being much concerned with religion. The division is therefore along a line approximating to secular/religious. It is not considered exclusive, though, with Carew (for example) falling into both sides, in some opinions (metaphysical was in any case a retrospective term). The term &#x27;sacred poets&#x27; has been applied, with an argument that they fall between two schools:

&quot;Herbert, Crashaw and Vaughan form, not, indeed, a school of poetry, but a group with definite links connecting them. Unlike the Fletchers and Habington, who looked back to &quot;Spenser&#x27;s art and Sydney&#x27;s wit,&quot; they come under the influence both of the newer literary fashions of Jonson and Fres, and of the revived spirit of cultured devotion in the Anglican church.&quot;

Others associated with the Cavalier tradition, according to Skelton, include Lord Herbert of Cherbury, Aurelian Townshend, William Cartwright, Thomas Randolph, William Habington, Sir Richard Fanshawe, Edmund Waller, and James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose. Because of the influence of Ben Jonson, the term &quot;Tribe of Ben&quot; is sometimes applied to poets in this loose group (Sons of Ben applies properly only to dramatist followers of Jonson).

In his introduction to &quot;The New Oxford Book of Seventeenth Century Verse&quot; Alastair Fowler makes a case for the existence of a third group centering on Michael Drayton and including William Browne, William Drummond of Hawthornden, John Davies of Hereford, George Sandys, Joshua Sylvester and George Wither.

==Other languages==
* The Welsh poetry of Gwilym Puw, who fought as a Captain in the Royalist Army and lived long enough to witness the Stuart Restoration, marks him out as a Cavalier poet in Welsh-language literature.
* Iain Lom, a Tacksman from Clan MacDonald of Keppoch, composed a long eyewitness account of the 1645 Battle of Inverlochy in the war poem &quot;Là Inbhir Lochaidh&quot; (&quot;The Day of Inverlochy&quot;). The resulting poem is still regarded as one of the great treasures of Scottish Gaelic literature and is an important primary source for historians regarding the battle.
* Revealing that he saw the Jacobite rising of 1745 as the continuation of the war his ancestors had waged against Oliver Cromwell and the Rump Parliament, Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair&#x27;s 1751 poetry book &quot;Ais-Eiridh na Sean Chánoin Albannaich&quot; (&quot;The Resurrection of the Ancient Scottish Language&quot;) included literary translations into Gaelic of three poems by Cavalier poet James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, which expressed his loyalty to King Charles I and to the House of Stuart during the English Civil War.

<text>A non-commissioned officer (NCO) is a military officer who does not hold a commission. Non-commissioned officers usually earn their position of authority by promotion through the enlisted ranks. In contrast, commissioned officers usually enter directly from a military academy, officer training corps (OTC) or reserve officer training corps (ROTC), or officer candidate school (OCS) or officer training school (OTS), after receiving a post-secondary degree. 

The NCO corps usually includes many grades of enlisted, corporal and sergeant; in some countries, warrant officers also carry out the duties of NCOs. The naval equivalent includes some or all grades of petty officer. There are different classes of non-commissioned officers, including junior (lower ranked) non-commissioned officers (JNCO) and senior/staff (higher ranked) non-commissioned officers (SNCO).

==Function==
The non-commissioned officer corps has been referred to as &quot;the backbone&quot; of the armed services, as they are the primary and most visible leaders for most military personnel. Moreover, they are the leaders primarily responsible for executing a military organization&#x27;s mission and for training military personnel so they are prepared to execute their missions. NCO training and education typically includes leadership and management as well as service-specific and combat training.

Senior NCOs are considered the primary link between enlisted personnel and the commissioned officers in a military organization. Their advice and guidance are considered particularly important for junior officers and in many cases to officers of all senior ranks.

==National usage==

===Australia===
In the Australian Army, lance corporals and corporals are classified as junior NCOs (JNCOs), sergeants and staff sergeants (currently being phased out) are classified as senior NCOs (SNCOs), while warrant officer class two and warrant officer class one are classified as warrant officers (WOs).

In the New South Wales Police Force, NCOs perform supervisory and coordination roles. The ranks of probationary constable through to leading senior constable are referred to as &quot;constables&quot;. All NCOs within the NSW Police are given a warrant of appointment under the Commissioner&#x27;s hand and seal.

All officers within the Australian Defence Force Cadets are non-commissioned, with ADFC officers appointed by the Director-General of their respective branch.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, a non-commissioned officer is called &quot;graduado&quot; or &quot;praça graduado&quot; and includes the ranks from third-sergeant to sub-lieutenant, the latter being equivalent to warrant officers.

===Canada===

In the Canadian Forces, the Queen&#x27;s Regulations and Orders formally defined a non-commissioned officer as &quot;A Canadian Forces member holding the rank of Sergeant or Corporal.&quot; In the 1990s, the term &quot;non-commissioned member&quot; (NCM) was introduced to indicate all ranks in the Canadian Forces from recruit to chief warrant officer.

By definition, with the unification of the Canadian Forces into one service, the rank of sergeant included the naval rank of petty officer 2nd class, and corporal includes the naval rank of sailor first class; corporal also includes the appointment of master corporal (naval master sailor).

NCOs are officially divided into two categories: junior non-commissioned officers, consisting of corporals/sailors first class and master corporals/master sailors; and senior non-commissioned officers, consisting of sergeants and petty officers 2nd class. In the Royal Canadian Navy, however, the accepted definition of &quot;NCO&quot; reflects the international use of the term (i.e. all grades of petty officer).

Junior non-commissioned officers mess and billet with privates and seamen; their mess is usually referred to as the junior ranks mess. Conversely, senior non-commissioned officers mess and billet with warrant officers; their mess is normally referred to as the warrant officers and sergeants mess (army and air force establishments) or the chiefs and petty officers mess (naval establishments).

As a group, NCOs rank above privates and below warrant officers. The term &quot;non-commissioned members&quot; includes these ranks.

===Finland===
In the Finnish Defence Force, NCO&#x27;s (&quot;aliupseeristo&quot;) includes all ranks from corporal (&quot;alikersantti&quot;, lit. sub-sergeant) to sergeant major (&quot;sotilasmestari&quot;, lit. soldier master). Ranks of lance corporal (&quot;korpraali&quot;) and leading seaman (&quot;ylimatruusi&quot;) are considered not to be NCO ranks. This ruling applies to all branches of service and also to the troops of the Border Guard.

===France===
In France, Belgium and most French-speaking countries, the term &quot;sous-officier&quot;
(meaning: &quot;under officer&quot; or &quot;sub-officer&quot;) is a class of ranks between the rank-and-file (&quot;hommes du rang&quot;) and commissioned officers (&quot;officiers&quot;). Corporals (&quot;caporal&quot; and &quot;caporal-chef&quot;) belong to the rank-and-file. Sous-officiers include two subclasses: &quot;subalternes&quot; (sergents and sergents-chefs) and &quot;supérieurs&quot; (adjudants, adjudants-chefs and majors). &quot;Sous-officiers supérieurs&quot; can perform various functions within a regiment or battalion, including commanding a platoon or section.

===German Speaking Countries===
In Germany and German-speaking countries like Austria, the term &quot;Unteroffizier&quot; describes a class of ranks between normal enlisted personnel (&quot;Mannschaften&quot; or in Austria &quot;Chargen&quot;) and officers (&quot;Offiziere&quot;). In this group of ranks there are, in Germany, two other classes: &quot;Unteroffiziere mit Portepee&quot; (with sword-knot) and &quot;Unteroffiziere ohne Portepee&quot; (without swordknot), both containing several ranks, which in Austria would be &quot;Unteroffiziere&quot; (NCOs) and &quot;Höhere Unteroffiziere&quot; (senior NCOs or literally translated as &quot;higher under officers&quot;). (&quot;Unteroffizier&quot; can be literally translated as &quot;under officer&quot;, or perhaps more idiomatically as &quot;lower officer&quot; or &quot;sub-officer&quot;.)

===India===
In the Indian Armed Forces, junior commissioned officers are promoted from non-commissioned officers and are broadly equivalent to warrant officers in Western armies. Senior non-commissioned officers are promoted to JCO rank on the basis of merit and seniority, restricted by the number of vacancies. In between the Commissioned Officer and the NCOs lies the Junior Commissioned Officers. They have a minimum of 28 years of service.

JCOs are entrusted with supervisory roles and the three JCO ranks are Subedar Major, Subedar and Naib Subedar. JCOs are equivalent in status to Group B (Gazetted) of Government of India.

JCOs are currently enrolled as jawans and few of them get promoted to officers over a period of time-based on their performance and on their ability to clear promotion examinations. A few JCOs are directly enrolled as religious teachers and in certain technical arms such as the Corps of Engineers. As of 2021, the Indian Army is discussing a proposal to directly enrol Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs) in all arms of the service to address the shortage of commissioned officers. According to the proposal, the Indian Army will directly induct JCOs who have cleared the Services Selection Board (SSB) interview. The Union Public Service Commission will conduct an entrance examination, which would be followed by an SSB interview and a medical examination. Selected candidates would then be trained for one and a half years before joining the units as JCOs. Subsequently, they would be promoted to officers up to the rank of Colonels based on their length of service and qualifications.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, the Irish Defence Forces have a professional body of non-commissioned officers from the ranks of Corporal (Cpl) (OR-4) to Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM) (OR-9) in the Irish Army and Air Corps.

In the Irish Naval Service the NCO ranks rise from Leading Hand or Leading Rate (OR-4) to Warrant Officer (OR-9). In Irish Naval Service parlance the rate or rating is the service members specialisation. Therefore, L/S refers to Leading Seaman, L/RRT refers to Leading Radio Radar Technician and so on.

Further to the distinctions within the Irish Defence Forces you have Junior and Senior NCOs. Junior NCOs are Corporals and Sergeants, (OR-4 and OR-5), and Senior NCOs are Company Sergeant and Company Quartermaster Sergeants to Regimental Sergeant Majors and Regimental Quartermaster Sergeants (OR-7 to OR-9). In the Irish Naval Service, this is further complicated by having Junior and Senior Ratings. Junior ratings from Ordinary Rate (OR-1) to Leading Rate (OR-4), and Senior Ratings are from Petty Officer (OR-5) to Warrant Officer (OR-9). Therefore, it can occur that a person incorrectly describes themselves as a Senior NCO when in fact they mean a Senior Rating.

===New Zealand===
In the New Zealand Defence Force, a non-commissioned officer is defined as:
:&quot;(a) In relation to the Navy, a rating of warrant officer, chief petty officer, petty officer, or leading rank; and includes—
::(i) A non-commissioned officer of the Army or the Air Force attached to the Navy; and
::(ii) A person duly attached or lent as a non-commissioned officer to or seconded for service or appointed for duty as a non-commissioned officer with the Navy:
: (b) In relation to the Army, a soldier above the rank of private but below the rank of officer cadet; and includes a warrant officer; and also includes—
::(i) A non-commissioned officer of the Navy or the Air Force attached to the Army; and
::(ii) A person duly attached or lent as a non-commissioned officer to or seconded for service or appointed for duty as a non-commissioned officer with the Army:
:(c) In relation to the Air Force, an airman above the rank of leading aircraftman but below the rank of officer cadet; and includes a warrant officer; and also includes—
::(i) A non-commissioned officer of the Navy or the Army attached to the Air Force; and
::(ii) A person duly attached or lent as a non-commissioned officer to or seconded for service or appointed for duty as a non-commissioned officer with the Air Force:&quot; – &quot;Defence Act 1990, Sect 2 (Interpretation)&quot;

===Norway===
On 1 January 2016, the Norwegian Armed Forces reintroduced non-commissioned officers in all service branches, having had a single rank tier since 1930, except for certain technical and maintenance units from 1945 to 1975. The NCOs are called specialists, and rank from sergeant to sergeant major (NATO ranks OR5–OR9). The Specialist Corps lance corporal and corporal ranks (OR2–OR4) are reserved for enlisted personnel, while the rank of private (OR1) is for conscripts only.

The NCOs are in charge of military training, discipline, practical leadership, role modelling, unit standards and mentoring officers, especially juniors. Officers commanding platoons and above are assigned a chief or master sergeant, which is the unit&#x27;s highest ranking specialist, although chief and master sergeants are functions and not ranks in themselves.

Norway took a top-down approach to establishing the Specialist Corps. Since August 2015, volunteer commissioned officers have converted into sergeant majors, command sergeants and first sergeants.

===Pakistan===
Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) in the Pakistan Army hold important positions and are responsible for the supervision and management of the enlisted soldiers. The NCO status begins with the rank of &quot;Lance Naik&quot;, Here are the ranks of NCOs in the Pakistan Army, from lowest to highest:

# Lance Naik
# Naik
# Havildar

In addition to these, there are also company/battalion appointments held by senior Havildars, such as Company Quartermaster Havildar, Company Havildar Major, Battalion Quartermaster Havildar, and Battalion Havildar Major.

NCOs display their rank insignias on mid sleeves, and in combat uniforms, all individuals wear rank insignias on their chest. They are responsible for the training, discipline, and welfare of the troops under their command.

===Singapore===
In the Singapore Armed Forces, the term &quot;non-commissioned officer&quot; is no longer officially used, being replaced with Specialist for all ranks from 3rd Sergeant to Master Sergeant (Staff and Master Sergeants are known as Senior Specialists). The term used to address Warrant Officers and Specialists combined is &quot;WOSpec&quot;. The term &quot;NCO&quot; however is still frequently used unofficially in the army.

===Sweden===
In 1983 the NCO corps, since 1972 called the &quot;Platoon Officer Corps&quot;, was disbanded and its members were given commissions as officers in ranks of second or first lieutenant in Sweden&#x27;s new one-tier military leadership system. In 2009 a similar system as the NCO corps was re-established, called &quot;specialist officers&quot;. Direct recruitment from civilian life is followed by basic and preparatory leadership training, and advanced leadership training during 1.5 year as a specialist cadet at the military academy in Halmstad, a warrant as an OR-6, followed by specialist technical training. Swedish specialist officers have relative ranks that match those of the commissioned officers; an OR-7 takes precedence over a second lieutenant, for instance.

===Turkey===
Non-commissioned officer, called in Turkish as &quot;astsubay&quot;, is the rank belonging to the non-enlisted class below the officer in the military hierarchy.
Military persons who are assigned as an assistant to the officer in training, administration and administration and other administrative tasks at the subordinate command levels of the Land, Naval and Air Forces of the Army of the Republic of Turkey, and the Gendarmerie General Command and the Coast Guard Command are called non-commissioned officers.

===United Kingdom===

In the British Armed Forces, NCOs are divided into two categories. Lance corporals (including lance bombardiers) and corporals (including lance sergeants, bombardiers, and lance corporals of horse) are junior NCOs. Sergeants (including corporals of horse), staff sergeants (including colour sergeants and staff corporals), and RAF chief technicians and flight sergeants are senior NCOs.

Warrant officers are often included in the senior NCO category, but actually form a separate class of their own, similar in many ways to NCOs but with a royal warrant. Senior NCOs and WOs have their own messes, which are similar to officers&#x27; messes (and are usually known as sergeants&#x27; messes), whereas junior NCOs live and eat with the unranked personnel, although they may have a separate corporals&#x27; club to give them some separate socialising space.

The Royal Navy does not refer to its petty officers and chief petty officers as NCOs, but calls them senior ratings (or senior rates). Leading ratings and below are junior ratings.

===United States===
In the Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps, all ranks of sergeant are termed NCOs, as are corporals in the Army and Marine Corps. The Marine Corps rank of lance corporal (E-3) is not an NCO, but rather a junior enlisted rank directly below corporal. The rank of corporal (E-4) in the Army and Marine Corps is a junior NCO, and is to be shown the same respect as any other NCO. However the rank of Specialist in the US Army, also with an E-4 pay grade, is not authorized to command troops and as such is not considered an NCO. In the Air Force, E-5 (staff sergeant) and E-6 (technical sergeant) are classified under the NCO tier, while E-7 (master sergeant), E-8 (senior master sergeant), and E-9 (chief master sergeant) are considered senior non-commissioned officers (SNCOs). In the Navy and Coast Guard, all ranks of petty officer are so designated. Junior NCOs (E-4 through E-6 grade), or simply &quot;NCOs&quot; (E-4 and E-5 only) in Marine Corps usage, function as first-tier supervisors and technical leaders.

NCOs serving in the top three enlisted grades (E-7, E-8, and E-9) are termed senior non-commissioned officers (chief petty officers in the Navy and Coast Guard). Senior NCOs are expected to exercise leadership at a more general level. They lead larger groups of service members, mentor junior officers, and advise senior officers on matters pertaining to their areas of responsibility.

Within the Marine Corps, senior NCOs are referred to as staff noncommissioned officers (SNCOs) and also include the rank of staff sergeant (E-6). SNCOs are those career Marines serving in grades E-6 through E-9 and serve as unit leaders and supervisors, primary assistants and technical advisors to officers, and senior enlisted advisors to commanding officers, commanding generals, and other higher-level commanders. The ranks include staff sergeant, gunnery sergeant (E-7), master sergeant / first sergeant (E-8), and master gunnery sergeant / sergeant major (E-9).

The title of &quot;superintendent&quot; is used by the Air Force as the title of the non-commissioned officer in charge (NCOIC) of a section, flight, squadron, group, staff agency, directorate, or similar organization. These positions are assigned to senior non-commissioned officers (SNCOs), as opposed to the titles &quot;NCOIC&quot; and &quot;chief&quot; (which are held by junior NCOs). The titles of &quot;commander&quot; and &quot;director&quot; are used for commissioned officers assigned as commanding officer of a unit or the head of a staff agency, directorate, or similar organization, respectively.

A select few senior NCOs in paygrade E-9 serve as &quot;senior enlisted advisors&quot; to senior commanders in each service (e.g., major command, fleet, force, etc.) and in DoD unified commands, e.g., United States Strategic Command, United States European Command, United States Pacific Command, etc., and DoD agencies, e.g. the Defense Information Systems Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency. One senior E-9, selected by the service chief of staff, is the ranking NCO/PO in that service, holds the highest enlisted rank for that service, and is responsible for advising their service secretary and chief of staff.

One E-9 holds a similar position as the SEA to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Senior enlisted advisors, service enlisted advisors and the SEA to the Chairman (SEAC) advise senior officer and civilian leaders on all issues affecting operational missions and the readiness, utilization, morale, technical and professional development, and quality of life of the enlisted force.

Warrant officers in the United States Armed Forces are considered specialty officers and fall in between enlisted and commissioned officers. US warrant officers also have their own tier and paygrade. However, when US warrant officers achieve the rank of chief warrant officer (CWO2) or higher, they are commissioned and are considered commissioned US officers just like any other commissioned officer, but are still held in a different paygrade tier.

====U.S. Army NCO Candidate Course====

Beginning in 1967 at Fort Benning, Georgia, the US Army Noncommissioned officer candidate course (NCOCC) was a Vietnam-war era program developed to alleviate shortages of enlisted leaders at squad and platoon level assignments, training enlisted personnel to assume jobs as squad leaders in combat.

Based loosely on the Officer Candidate School (OCS), NCOC was a new concept (at the time) where high performing trainees attending basic infantry combat training were nominated to attend a two-phased course of focused instruction on jungle warfare, and included a hands-on portion of intense training, promotion to sergeant, and then a 12-week assignment leading trainees going through advanced training.

Regular Army soldiers who had received their promotion through traditional methods (and others) used derisive terms for these draftees (typically) who were promoted quicker, such as &quot;Instant NCOs&quot;, &quot;Shake &#x27;n&#x27; Bake&quot;, and &quot;Whip n&#x27; Chills&quot;.

The program proved to be so successful that as the war began to wind down they elected to institutionalize training noncommissioned officers and created the NCO Education System (NCOES), which was based around the NCO candidate course. The NCO candidate course generally ended in 1971–1972.

====U.S. Navy Accelerated Advancement====

Within the U.S. Navy there are different ways that a sailor can earn accelerated advancement to the rank of petty officer third class. If a person tests high enough on their entrance exam they are able to select certain jobs that require a significant amount of training, far greater than the amount required for a basic job (12 months vs. 2 weeks). Because these jobs are more technically advanced, the schools have higher attrition rates, demand more responsibility, and require longer initial enlistments, these sailors are able to advance to petty officer third class. Another way for a sailor to earn accelerated advancement is by graduating in the top 10% of their class within their &quot;A&quot; school. For certain ratings, such as Corpsman, this has been discontinued.

<text>Halibut is the common name for three species of flatfish in the family of right-eye flounders. In some regions, and less commonly, other species of large flatfish are also referred to as halibut.

The word is derived from &quot;haly&quot; (holy) and &quot;butte&quot; (flat fish), for its popularity on Catholic holy days. Halibut are demersal fish and are highly regarded as a food fish as well as a sport fish.

==Species ==
A 2018 cladistic analysis based on genetics and morphology showed that the Greenland halibut diverged from a lineage that gave rise to the Atlantic and Pacific halibuts. The common ancestor of all three diverged from a lineage that gave rise to the genus &quot;Verasper&quot;, comprising the spotted halibut and barfin flounder.


* Genus &quot;Hippoglossus&quot;
** Atlantic halibut, &quot;Hippoglossus hippoglossus&quot; – lives in the North Atlantic
** Pacific halibut, &quot;Hippoglossus stenolepis&quot; – lives in the North Pacific Ocean
* Genus &quot;Reinhardtius&quot;
**Greenland halibut, &quot;Reinhardtius hippoglossoides&quot; – lives in the cold northern Atlantic, northern Pacific, and Arctic Oceans

==Physical characteristics==
The Pacific and Atlantic halibut are the world&#x27;s largest flatfish, with debate over which grows larger. Halibut are dark brown on the top side with a white to off-white underbelly and have very small scales invisible to the naked eye embedded in their skin. Halibut are symmetrical at birth with one eye on each side of the head. Then, about six months later, during larval metamorphosis one eye migrates to the other side of the head. The eyes are permanently set once the skull is fully ossified. At the same time, the stationary-eyed side darkens to match the top side, while the other side remains white. This color scheme disguises halibut from above (blending with the ocean floor) and from below (blending into the light from the sky) and is known as countershading.

The IGFA size record for halibut was apparently broken off the waters of Norway in July 2013 by a , fish. This was awaiting certification as of 2013. In July 2014, a Pacific halibut was caught in Glacier Bay, Alaska; this is, however, discounted from records because the halibut was shot and harpooned before being hauled aboard.

==Diet==
Halibut feed on almost any fish or animal they can fit into their mouths. Juvenile halibut feed on small crustaceans and other bottom-dwelling organisms. Animals found in their stomachs include sand lance, octopus, crab, salmon, hermit crabs, lamprey, sculpin, cod, pollock, herring, and flounder, as well as other halibut. Halibut live at depths ranging from a few meters to hundreds of meters, and although they spend most of their time near the bottom, halibut may move up in the water column to feed. In most ecosystems, the halibut is near the top of the marine food chain. In the North Pacific, common predators are sea lions, killer whales, salmon sharks and humans.

== Sex-determining genes ==
Halibut species vary in sex determination systems. The Atlantic halibut went down a purely XX/XY route, with the male being heterogametic, around 0.9 to 3.8 million years ago. The sex-determining gene for the Atlantic halibut is likely to be gsdf on chromosome 13. The Pacific halibut went down a ZZ/ZW route, with the female being heterogametic, around 4.5 million years ago. The master sex-determining gene of the Pacific halibut is located on chromosome 9 and it is likely to be &quot;bmpr1ba.&quot; The gene &quot;sox2&quot; is likely to play the same role in the Greenland halibut.

==Halibut fishery==
The North Pacific commercial halibut fishery dates to the late 19th century and today is one of the region&#x27;s largest and most lucrative. In Canadian and US waters, long-line fishing predominates, using chunks of octopus (&quot;devilfish&quot;) or other bait on circle hooks attached at regular intervals to a weighted line that can extend for several miles across the bottom. The fishing vessel retrieves the line after several hours to a day. The effects of long-line gear on habitats are poorly understood, but could include disturbance of sediments, benthic structures, and other structures.

International management is thought to be necessary, because the species occupies waters of the United States, Canada, Russia, and possibly Japan (where the species is known to the Japanese as &quot;ohyo&quot;), and matures slowly. Halibut do not reproduce until age eight, when about long, so commercial capture below this length prevents breeding and is against US and Canadian regulations supporting sustainability. Pacific halibut fishing is managed by the International Pacific Halibut Commission.

For most of the modern era, halibut fishery operated as a derby. Regulators declared time slots when fishing was open (typically 24–48 hours at a time) and fishermen raced to catch as many pounds as they could within that interval. This approach accommodated unlimited participation in the fishery while allowing regulators to control the quantity of fish caught annually by controlling the number and timing of openings. The approach led to unsafe fishing, as openings were necessarily set before the weather was known, forcing fishermen to leave port regardless of the weather. The approach limited fresh halibut to the markets to several weeks per year when the gluts would push down the price received by fishermen.

===Individual fishing quotas===
In 1995, US regulators allocated individual fishing quotas (IFQs) to existing fishery participants based on each vessel&#x27;s documented historical catch. IFQs grant to holders a specific proportion of each year&#x27;s total allowable catch (TAC). The fishing season is about eight months. The IFQ system improved both safety and product quality by providing a stable flow of fresh halibut to the marketplace. Critics of the program suggest, since holders can sell their quota and the fish are a public resource, the IFQ system gave a public resource to the private sector. The fisheries were managed through a treaty between the United States and Canada per recommendations of the International Pacific Halibut Commission, formed in 1923.

A significant sport fishery in Alaska and British Columbia has emerged, where halibut are prized game and food fish. Sport fisherman use large rods and reels with line, and often bait with herring, large jigs, or whole salmon heads. Halibut are strong and fight strenuously when exposed to air. Smaller fish will usually be pulled on board with a gaff and may be clubbed or even punched in the head to prevent them from thrashing around on the deck. In both commercial and sport fisheries, standard procedure is to shoot or otherwise subdue very large halibut over before landing them.

=== Overfishing and population decline ===
The Atlantic halibut has been a major target of fishing since the 1840s with overfishing causing the depletion of the species in the Georges Bank in 1850, then all the way up to the Canadian Arctic in 1866. In the 1940s the American fishing industry collapsed but the Canadian fishing industry remained until there was a decline in Canadian halibut fishery in the 1970s and 1980s. This allowed the halibut population to briefly rebound before collapsing in the 1990s. Since a low point in the early 2000s, the population has rebounded once again and may be stabilizing, but the species is not nearly as abundant in most locations as it was in the early 1800s.

=== Atlantic halibut population ===
Currently, Atlantic halibut is managed as two stocks in Canadian waters, which are the Atlantic Continental Shelf stock and the Gulf of St. Lawrence stock. The Atlantic halibut has two other stocks in the Northwest Atlantic, those being the Gulf of Maine-Georges Bank stock controlled by the United States and one controlled by France near the Saint-Pierre and Miquelon Archipelago. The Georges Bank stock is still considered to be depleted and it is listed as a species of concern in the United States. In the two main populations of Atlantic halibut there are many subpopulations, but many have been lost due to patches of extreme overfishing and the populations remain depleted as a whole from what they were in the 1800s.

=== Pacific and Greenland halibut populations ===
The Pacific halibut and Greenland halibut have not had this level of fragmentation, and their population is far larger in the United States&#x27; waters, with North Pacific halibut and groundfish fisheries extracting the largest volume of catch out of all United States fishery areas. Sometimes the California halibut is mistaken for a subspecies, but they are not, and are not even a true halibut species. In the North Atlantic, observation of migration indicates that there are only two major populations of Greenland halibut that both stretch vast distances. Those populations being the Northeast one stretching from the Kara Sea to Greenland, and the Northwest one stretching from Newfoundland to Baffin Bay. These stocks had been previously thought to be four different populations, but migration has indicated that they are only two different populations, and that fishing has not fragmented them. New research also indicates that the Greenland halibut originally came from the Pacific Ocean and spread into the Arctic Basin when the Bering Strait opened for a second time around 3 million years ago, and thus the Pacific halibut is its closest living relative.

=== Evolutionary diversification of fragmented populations ===
In the Atlantic halibut studies have shown that the Atlantic Continental Shelf stock and the Gulf of St. Lawrence stock have begun to differentiate genetically from each other due to low connectivity between populations, low rates of exchange, and subsequent adaptation to local environments. Some adaptations can show up as changes in life-history trait parameters, which can change on a faster time scale than evolution and cause behavioural segregation. This can occur even in areas with enough genetic mixing to prevent genetic divergence. One small but significant observed adaptation difference in the Atlantic halibut has been that the fish in the warmer Scotian Shelf have a faster growth rate than the halibut in the colder southern Grand Banks. The Pacific halibut population remains largely genetically homologous throughout their range, but there is some variation of life-history traits on a geographic gradient. Despite its large range, the populations of Greenland halibut remain largely homogenous due to a lack of barriers for gene flow between its four major populations. There are small differences between subpopulations due to differing environmental factors, such as salinity and temperature gradients, but not to the degree seen in Atlantic halibut, as gene flow and migration continues throughout many different stocks.

==As food==

===Nutrition===
Raw Pacific or Atlantic halibut meat is 80% water and 19% protein, with negligible fat and no carbohydrates (table). In a reference amount, raw halibut contains rich content (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of protein, selenium (65% DV), phosphorus (34% DV), vitamin D (32% DV), and several B vitamins: niacin, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 (42–46% DV).

Cooked halibut meat – presumably through the resulting dehydration – has relatively increased protein content and reduced B vitamin content (per 100 grams), while magnesium, phosphorus, and selenium are rich in content.

===Food preparation===

Halibut yield large fillets from both sides of the fish, with the small round cheeks providing an additional source of meat. Halibut are often boiled, deep-fried or grilled while fresh. Smoking is more difficult with halibut meat than it is with salmon, due to its ultra-low fat content. Eaten fresh, the meat has a clean taste and requires little seasoning. Halibut is noted for its dense and firm texture.

Halibut have historically been an important food source to Alaska Natives and Canadian First Nations, and continue to be a key element to many coastal subsistence economies. Accommodating the competing interests of commercial, sport, and subsistence users is a challenge.

As of 2008, the Atlantic population was so depleted through overfishing that it might be declared an endangered species. According to Seafood Watch, consumers should avoid Atlantic halibut. Most halibut eaten on the East Coast of the United States is from the Pacific.

In 2012, sport fishermen in Cook Inlet reported increased instances of a condition known as &quot;mushy halibut syndrome&quot;. The meat of the affected fish has a &quot;jelly-like&quot; consistency. When cooked it does not flake in the normal manner of halibut but rather falls apart. The meat is still perfectly safe to eat but the appearance and consistency are considered unappetizing. The exact cause of the condition is unknown but may be related to a change in diet.

<doc id="166682" wikidata="Q2647081" url="?curid=166682" title="K-Y Jelly">
<text>K-Y Jelly (Rebranded as Knect in the United Kingdom) is a water-based, water-soluble personal lubricant, most commonly used as a lubricant for sexual intercourse and masturbation. A variety of different products and formulas are produced under the K-Y banner, some of which are not water-soluble.

==History==


Introduced in 1904 by pharmaceutical company and suture manufacturer Van Horn and Sawtell of New York City, and later acquired by Johnson &amp; Johnson, K-Y Jelly&#x27;s original stated purpose was as a surgical lubricant, and it was often chosen by doctors because of its natural base. The product is now more widely used as a sexual lubricant to supplement the moisture required for performing sexual acts. 

Reckitt Benckiser purchased the brand in 2014 and integrated the brand as the sub-brand of Durex.

K-Y Jelly was rebranded as Knect in the United Kingdom in 2023

==Properties==
Unlike petroleum-based lubricants, K-Y jelly is biologically inert, reacting with neither latex condoms nor silicone-based sex toys, and contains no added colors or perfumes. It is non-staining and easy to clean up. Despite having a thick consistency and a tendency to dry out during use, it can be &quot;reactivated&quot; by the addition of water.

The product contains no spermicide and thus cannot be used to prevent pregnancy. A formulation containing nonoxynol-9 was removed from the market after the spermicide was found to facilitate the spread of HIV.

K-Y Jelly has been available over the counter in the United States since 1980.

==Composition==
K-Y NG uses glycerin and hydroxyethyl cellulose as the lubricant, with chlorhexidine gluconate, glucono delta-lactone, methylparaben and sodium hydroxide as antiseptic and preservative additives. The liquid form of the product combines glycerin with propylene glycol, sorbitol, and Natrosol 250H (a brand of hydroxyethyl cellulose) for lubrication, with benzoic acid, methylparaben and sodium hydroxide as additives.

==Uses==
===Medical===
In addition to its use as a personal lubricant, K-Y Jelly is employed by clinicians to perform prostate and gynecological examinations.

It is used by dentists to cover composite restorations when light curing. This prevents the oxygen inhibitation layer which causes marginal discolouration of restorations.

It has been noted as an alternative to conventional ultrasound coupling gel.

===Other===
It is also used by special effects technicians to create a &quot;slimy&quot; appearance or simulate saliva for animatronic monsters, most notably the &quot;Alien&quot; series.

<doc id="166683" wikidata="Q359351" url="?curid=166683" title="Rebbe">
<text>A Rebbe () or Admor () is the spiritual leader in the Hasidic movement, and the personalities of its dynasties. The titles of Rebbe and Admor, which used to be a general honorific even before the beginning of the movement, became, over time, almost exclusively identified with its Tzadikim.

== Usage ==
Today, &quot;rebbe&quot; is used in the following ways:
# Rabbi, a teacher of Torah – Yeshiva students or &quot;cheder&quot; (elementary school) students, when talking to their teacher, would address him with the honorific &quot;Rebbe&quot;, as the Yiddish-German equivalent to the Hebrew word &quot;rabbi&quot; ( &quot;&quot; ).
# Personal mentor and teacher—A person&#x27;s main Rosh Yeshiva, Yeshiva teacher, or mentor, who teaches him or her Talmud and Torah and gives religious guidance, is referred to as &quot;rebbe&quot; (), also as an equivalent to the term &quot;rabbi&quot;.
# Spiritual leader—The spiritual head of a Hasidic movement is called a &quot;rebbe&quot; (). His followers would address him as &quot;The &quot;Rebbe&quot;&quot; or refer to him when speaking to others as &quot;the &quot;Rebbe&quot;&quot; or &quot;my &quot;Rebbe&quot;&quot;. He is referred to by others as the &quot;Rebbe&quot; of a particular Hasidic dynasty. In Hebrew, a Hasidic rebbe is often referred to as an &quot;AdMoR&quot;, which is an abbreviation for &quot;Adoneinu, Moreinu, veRabbenu&quot; (&quot;Our Master, our Teacher, and our Rabbi&quot;). In writing, this title is placed before the name of the Hasidut, as in &quot;Admor of Belz&quot;; while the title &quot;Rebbe&quot; comes after the name of the &quot;Hasidut&quot; when used as an adjective, as in &quot;Lubavitcher Rebbe&quot;, &quot;Amshinever Rebbe&quot;, and every rebbe of every Hasidic dynasty. In the &quot;Litvishe&quot; world, when not referring to a hasidic &quot;rebbe&quot; (), the word can be pronounced &quot;rebbee&quot; (). Sephardic Jews can pronounce it as &quot;Ribbi&quot; (). The Lubavitcher hasidim have a tradition that the Hebrew letters that make up the word rebbe () are also an acronym for &quot;Rosh Bnei Yisroel&quot;, meaning &quot;a spiritual head of the Children of Israel&quot;.

An ordinary communal rabbi, or &quot;rebbe&quot; in Yiddish, is sometimes distinct from a &quot;rav&quot; (, also pronounced &quot;rov&quot; by Jews of Eastern European or Russian origin), who is a more authoritative halakhic decider. A significant function of a &quot;rav&quot; is to answer questions of halakha (the corpus of Jewish law), but he is not as authoritative as a &quot;posek&quot;. The short form &quot;reb&quot; is an honorific for Orthodox Jewish men, who are most likely to have profound knowledge of the Talmud and Torah, as opposed to Reconstructionist, Reform or Conservative Judaism. Originally, this title was added to the names of Jews at the time of the schism with the Karaite sect, as a sign of loyalty to the original rabbinic tradition, known today as Orthodox Judaism.

== Hasidism ==
As a rule, among hasidim, &quot;rebbe&quot; () is referred to in Hebrew as &quot;admor&quot; (pl. &quot;admorim&quot;), an abbreviation for Hebrew &quot;adoneinu moreinu v&#x27;rabeinu&quot; ( acronym for אדוננו מורנו ורבנו), meaning &#x27;our master, our teacher, and our rabbi&#x27;, which is now the modern Hebrew word in Israel for &quot;rebbe&quot;.

Hasidim use the term &quot;rebbe&quot; also in a more elevated manner, to denote someone that they perceive not only as the religious leader or &quot;nasi&quot; of their congregation, but as their spiritual adviser and mentor. &quot;The Rebbe&quot; or &quot;my Rebbe&quot; in this sense is a &quot;rav&quot; or &quot;rabbi&quot; whose views and advice are accepted not only on issues of religious law and practice, but in all arenas of life, including political and social issues. Sometimes a Hasid has a &quot;rebbe&quot; as his spiritual guide and an additional &quot;rav&quot; for rulings on issues of &quot;halakha&quot;.

Hasidim use the concept of a (non-Hasidic) &quot;rebbe&quot; in the simple sense of &quot;rabbi&quot;, as the Yiddish-German equivalent to the Hebrew word &quot;&quot; . For example: &quot;I will ask my rebbe (), Rabbi () Ploni (so-and-so), for advice about this personal matter.&quot;

== The Hasidic rebbe ==
A Hasidic rebbe () is generally taken to mean a great leader of a Hasidic dynasty, also referred to as &quot;Grand Rabbi&quot; in English or an &quot;ADMOR&quot;, a Hebrew acronym for &quot;Adoneinu-Moreinu-veRabbeinu&quot; (&quot;our lord/master, teacher, and rabbi&quot;). Outside of Hasidic circles, the term &quot;Grand Rabbi&quot; has been used to refer to a rabbi with a higher spiritual status. The practice became widespread in America in the early 1900s when Hasidic rebbes began to emigrate to the United States and was derived from the German &quot;Grossrabbiner&quot;.

Rabbi Yisroel Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism, is regarded by Hasidim as the first Hasidic rebbe. During his lifetime he was referred to mainly as &quot;The holy&quot; rather than as &quot;Rebbe&quot;, and his disciples were &quot;magidim&quot; or &quot;preachers&quot;, such as the Magid of Chernobyl or the Magid of Mezritch.

The first &quot;rebbe&quot; to be known as such was the Baal Shem Tov&#x27;s grandson, Rabbi Boruch of Mezhibozh, who was referred to as &quot;The Rebbe&quot; during his lifetime. After him, those who rose to positions of leadership and their successors began to be called &quot;rebbe&quot;. The title gradually came to suggest a higher spiritual status.

Each Hasidic group refers to its leader as &quot;the rebbe&quot;.

Hannah Rachel Verbermacher, also known as the Maiden of Ludmir or the &quot;Ludmirer Moyd&quot;, was the only female rebbe in the history of the Hasidic movement; she lived in the 19th century in Ukraine and Israel.

=== Relationship of Hasidim to their rebbe ===

==== Rebbe as tzadik ====
According to Maimonides, a tzadik is &quot;one whose merit surpasses [his/her] iniquity&quot;, and every person can reach the level of a Tzadik. According to the Tanya, a tzadik has no evil inclination, and only a select few predestined to attain this level can attain it. According to Kabbalah (and particularly the Hasidic understanding of Kabbalah), the world is sustained on the &quot;shoulders&quot; of Tzadikim Nistarim, divinely predestined exceptionally righteous people in a generation. Nobody knows who was such a tzaddik, even one of these exceptionally righteous people would not know that they are such a tzadik. These people are understood to have perfected their service of God to such an extent that they become literally and physically aware of God. These righteous people&#x27;s perception (of both spiritual and physical, not to mention temporal matters) transcends the apparent boundaries of existence.

However, a Hasidic rebbe is generally said to be a righteous person, called a &quot;tzaddik&quot;. Furthermore, a rebbe is said to be able to affect divine providence, and a rebbe is said to be able to &quot;see the future&quot;, or at least have strong insight into the life and trials of another.

As a result, Hasidim in some Hasidic circles seek their rebbe&#x27;s advice for a variety of concerns: spiritual, physical, and even business concerns. Furthermore, many people seek the blessing &quot;(bracha)&quot; of a rebbe (and a Hasid will specifically seek the blessing of his rebbe) for anything, from minor (and all the more so major) physical troubles, to grand spiritual concerns.

==== Tzadik HaDor ====
In some movements the Hasidim believe that their rebbe is the &quot;tzadik hador&quot; (tzaddik of the generation) and would regard any thought that detracts from his perfection and holiness as heresy. Other sects lessen this idealization to some degree or another. Since many rebbes are sons-in-law or students of other rebbes, it makes sense that they would view themselves as subordinate to those other rebbes. Nonetheless, their Hasidim remain loyal to them because of their special loyalty, a family connection, or a belief that a specific &quot;tzaddik&quot; or Nasi HaDor (although others might have greater spiritual stature) connects best with one&#x27;s soul. For example, the Kosover Rebbe makes yearly pilgrimages to the Tosher Rebbe. Nonetheless, his followers remain very loyal to him.

==== Rebbe as conduit ====
Unlike rabbis or non-Hasidic rebbes in other Jewish movements, Hasidic Judaism considers a &quot;Hasidic rebbe&quot; to be a conduit between Jews and God. based on traditional Kabbalistic concepts and terminology, Hasidic philosophy bridged deveikut, a Jewish concept referring to closeness to God, to the Hasidic rebbe, embodying and channeling the Divine flow of blessing to the world, because Creation is dependent on the continuous flow of Divine lifeforce, without which it would revert to nothingness.

==== Hasidic followers of a rebbe ====
Given a rebbe&#x27;s physical awareness of God and the rebbe&#x27;s transcendent perception of Godliness, many Hasidim take special care to observe their rebbe&#x27;s specific and sometimes minute practices. Even things that seem mundane may nonetheless be seen by Hasidim as incredibly significant. For example, Lubavitcher Hasidim frequently shape their fedoras to match the way that the Lubavitcher Rebbe shaped his hat, which was more flat than many others. Many Skverer Hasidim (of the Skverer Rebbe in New Square) wear their peyos identical to those of the Skverer Rebbe.

While Hasidim do not always follow the specific practices of their rebbe, the rebbe can create practices that may be specific and unique to his Hasidim. For example, Rabbi Aaron Roth (&quot;Reb Areleh&quot;, as he was called) the first rebbe of Shomer Emunim, told his Hasidim to pause frequently while eating their meals to keep them from overindulging. A Hasid will usually display love and admiration for their rebbe as they would a close family member, if not more so. However, the degree and nature of this belief vary depending on the movement.

=== Functions of a Hasidic rebbe ===
There are some functions that are exclusively the domain of Hasidic rebbes:

A rebbe conducts a &quot;tish&quot; (: &quot;feert tish&quot;, literally, &quot;to run [a] table&quot;) or a &quot;farbrengen&quot;—a communal festive meal with highly mystical overtones—on Shabbat and other occasions. At a tish, the rebbe distributes &quot;shirayim&quot; (lit. remnants) to the Hasidim seated at or gathered around the table. When a gathering similar to a &quot;tish&quot; is led by a rabbi who is not a rebbe (i.e. a Mashpia), it can be referred to as a &quot;botte&quot; (esp. amongst groups from Romania) or &quot;sheves Achim&quot;.

A rebbe has times when Hasidim (and other petitioners) may come for a private audience. A kvitel (Yiddish for &quot;note&quot;, plural &quot;kvitlach&quot;) is a note with the name of the petitioner and a short request for which the rebbe is asked to pray. The formula in which a person&#x27;s name is written is one&#x27;s own Hebrew name, the son/daughter of one&#x27;s mother&#x27;s Hebrew name, such as &quot;Shimon ben Rivkah&quot; (Simeon the son of Rebecca). Hasidim believes that rebbes read supernaturally &quot;between the lines&quot; of a &quot;kvitel&quot;, and in every Hasidic movement there are numerous anecdotes relating how the rebbe saw things that were not written in the &quot;kvitel&quot;.

In most Hasidic groups, the &quot;kvitel&quot; is written by the rebbe&#x27;s &quot;gabbai&quot; (secretary), however, sometimes the petitioner writes it on his own. Usually, but with some exceptions, a &quot;pidyon&quot; (redemption) of cash is customarily handed to the rebbe under the &quot;kvitel&quot;, but this is not obligatory. This is considered to be the conduit through which the blessing is given, and a redemption for the soul of the petitioner. (&quot;A gift makes its receiver glad&quot; is given as an explanation: a blessing only comes from a joyous heart.) It is also customary to tip the gabbai, although this too is not obligatory.

Other tasks are not exclusive to Hasidic rebbes but are important roles they play in their community similar to other rabbis. These include the leading of prayer on Shabbat and Holy Days, performing mitzvot with their Hasidim, and participating in or officiating at weddings, &quot;brit milahs&quot;, and other events. Hasidic rebbes also play a central role in the intellectual and social life of their communities, delivering sermons and dialogues and building educational and religious institutions.

=== Typology of Hasidic rebbes ===
Zalman Schachter-Shalomi theorized that the historical Hasidic Rebbes may be viewed as occupying one or several of the following roles or functions about their support of their followers:
* &quot;The Rav&quot; — This role refers to Hasidic Rebbes who also served as ordained rabbis serving Jewish communities. Examples of this type cited by Schachter-Shalom include Shmelke of Nikolsburg and Pinchas Horowitz. For some Hasidic Rebbes, such as Chaim Halberstam of Sanz, the term Rav was used instead of Rebbe.
* &quot;The Good Jew&quot; — This role, known in Yiddish as the &quot;Guter Yid&quot;, refers to a popular Hasidic Rebbe who is viewed as enjoying God&#x27;s favor and whose legacies spoke to the conditions of struggling Hasidim. This role was viewed as a continuation of the Talmudic legacy of individuals such as Honi HaMe&#x27;agel. Examples of Hasidic Rebbes of this type cited include Aryeh Leib of Shpola and Berishil of Krakow.
* &quot;The Seer&quot; — This role, known in Hebrew as the &quot;Chozeh&quot;, refers to a Hasidic Rebbe was ascribed prophetic powers. Examples of this type cited include the Seer of Lublin and his student Tzvi Hirsh of Zidichov.
* &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; — This role, known in Hebrew as the &quot;Ba&#x27;al Mofet&quot;, was often assumed by Hasidim to involve expertise in Practical Kabbalah. Examples cited include Ber of Radoshitz.
* &quot;The Healer&quot; — This role is understood as involving more than mere healing but also involved the expectation that the Hasid would alter his behavior to merit healing.
** &quot;The Gaon&quot; — A variant of the healer-type was the Talmudic genius (&quot;gaon&quot;) who could offer blessing through the merit of his Talmudic study. This tradition was not limited to Hasidism but also was applied to non-Hasidic rabbis such as Yechezkel Landau of Prague and the Gaon of Vilna.
* &quot;The Son or Grandson of the Tzaddik&quot; — This role applied to Hasidic Rebbes who would utilize ancestral merit of a Hasidic predecessor to invoke blessing. In Yiddish, the term &quot;einykel&quot; (grandson) would sometimes be used. Often, this role involved the use of petitions at the gravesite of the Hasidic predecessor. Examples cited of this type include Boruch of Medzhybizh who was the grandson of the Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism.
* &quot;The Block Rebbe&quot; — This type is viewed to have developed in New York City from 1900 to 1940 and involved a grandfatherly role to local Jewish residents.
* &quot;The Kabbalist&quot; — This role, also known in Hebrew as the &quot;Ba&#x27;al M&#x27;kubal&quot;, involved expertise in the theoretical teachings of Jewish mysticism. Examples cited include Shneur Zalman of Lyady (the founder of Chabad Hasidism), Yisroel Hopstein (the Maggid of Kozhnitz), and Isaac of Komarno.
* &quot;The Spiritual Guide&quot; — This role, known in Hebrew as the &quot;Moreh Derekh&quot; (&quot;Teacher of the Path&quot;), reflects the Hasidic notion that Rebbe is the expert on matters of the Love and Fear of God. The Hasidic Rebbe Aharon Roth reportedly insisted on the use of this term. While Schachter-Shalom notes that Hasidim valued the living guide over the use of books, some Rebbes, such as Shalom Dovber of Lubavitch, wrote various tracts for different types of spiritual seekers.
* &quot;The Tzaddik of the Generation&quot; — This role, known in Hebrew as &quot;Tzaddik HaDor&quot;, or &quot;Rashey Alafim&quot; (&quot;Head of Thousands&quot;), invokes the stature of Biblical leaders and is viewed mystically as the conduit of all blessing for the Jewish people of that generation.

<doc id="166685" wikidata="Q241525" url="?curid=166685" title="Skid Row (Skid Row album)">
<text>Skid Row is the debut studio album by American heavy metal band Skid Row, released on January 24, 1989, by Atlantic Records. After signing with manager Doc McGhee, Skid Row signed with Atlantic and began recording its debut. The album was recorded in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, with producer Michael Wagener, and received mixed reviews upon its release. The band toured behind the album mainly as an opening act, supporting Bon Jovi and Aerosmith in 1989–1990. The album peaked at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified 5× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1995 for shipping five million copies in the United States. It generated four singles: &quot;Youth Gone Wild&quot;, &quot;18 and Life&quot;, &quot;I Remember You&quot; and &quot;Piece of Me&quot;, all of which were accompanied by music videos and received heavy rotation on MTV. The album&#x27;s commercial and critical success made Skid Row a regular feature in rock magazines and brought the group nationwide popularity.

==Background and recording==
Skid Row was formed in 1986, in Toms River, New Jersey, when guitarist Dave Sabo met bassist Rachel Bolan in a local guitar store where Sabo worked. As they shared similar musical influences, they began rehearsing in Bolan&#x27;s parents&#x27; garage. Guitarist Scotti Hill came from Bolan&#x27;s previous club band, and Sabo&#x27;s acquaintance, upstate New Yorker, Rob Affuso, played drums in a Rush tribute band. Once the band was formed, Skid Row started gigging in nightclubs throughout the Eastern United States and quickly built a small following. Sabo was a childhood friend of Jon Bon Jovi and they had agreed if one of them succeeded in the music business, to help the other out. Skid Row caught the attention of Bon Jovi&#x27;s manager Doc McGhee while opening for Bon Jovi on their 1987 Slippery When Wet Tour. McGhee suggested the band replace original singer Matt Fallon because he lacked the rest of the group&#x27;s drive.

Sebastian Bach was introduced to Skid Row by the parents of Jon Bon Jovi, who saw Bach sing at rock photographer Mark Weiss&#x27; wedding. After completing the lineup, the group signed with Richie Sambora&#x27;s and Bon Jovi&#x27;s publishing company Underground, unknowingly giving them the lion&#x27;s share of the group&#x27;s royalties. Skid Row later restored Sambora&#x27;s share of the royalties, but Bon Jovi kept his, which caused a rift between Bon Jovi and Bach. After negotiating with Geffen and A&amp;M, Skid Row finally settled with Ahmet Ertegun and Atlantic in 1988. The band used the Royal Recorders studio in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin with producer Michael Wagener to record its debut album. The unpretentious studio was in the back end of a hotel, where the band stayed. Skid Row worked according to a schedule made by Wagener and stayed &quot;dry&quot; while recording. The sessions went smoothly as the band had been playing and performing the songs for the past year. The label initially pressed 150,000 copies of the album and booked the band an opening slot on Bon Jovi&#x27;s 1988–1989 New Jersey Syndicate Tour.

==Critical reception and legacy==
Upon its release in January 1989, &quot;Skid Row&quot; did not immediately connect with listeners and received mixed reviews from the music press. With the success of the &quot;I Remember You&quot; single which cracked the Billboard Top 10 in the autumn of 1989, the album took off and eventually sold over 5 million copies, establishing the band as one of the top metal acts of the late 80s. Phil Wilding of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; found the album quite formulaic, but wrote that the praises for Skid Row expressed by Bon Jovi band members and the range of diversity in their music were &quot;a big hint that they could be something very special in the future.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; magazine described the album as a fusion of rock riffs and commercial hooks, and proclaimed it a notable debut. &quot;Spin&quot;&#x27;s Erik Davis said &quot;Skid Row&quot; was slightly different from contemporary albums by Warrant and Great White because it contained less &quot;fake-gutter narratives of sluts and bad boys&quot;, and instead leaned more towards Bon Jovi&#x27;s earnest anthems. Aniss Garza was more critical in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, finding the record &quot;highly unoriginal&quot; and lacking any lyrical substance or musical ingenuity. Robert Christgau in his negative review remarked how the band attempted some social commentary and was not &quot;offensively sexist&quot; if only by heavy metal standards, jokingly saying that the disreputable women in the songs were at least &quot;characters rather than objects&quot;. &quot;Rock Hard&quot; reviewer wrote that this album is an example of how &quot;independence and originality are by no means as in demand&quot; in the US music world as the following of the &quot;success schemes&quot; established by bands like Guns N&#x27; Roses, with only a couple of good songs saving it from &quot;sad mediocrity&quot;.

Modern reviews are generally more positive. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff described the album as a &quot;basic well-executed corporate metal feast&quot; and praised Bach&#x27;s performance for carrying the record and &quot;raising the average to something worth reckoning.&quot; He thought Skid Row represented a &quot;grittier, more street version of hair metal&quot;, unlike its California-based peers. AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey classified the album as &quot;typical pop-metal fluff&quot; of the late 1980s, but praised it for the consistent songwriting and said Bach&#x27;s vocals gave the songs the much-needed nasty attitude. Sputnikmusic&#x27;s Dave Donnelly considered Skid Row one of the more talented bands of the glam era because of its charismatic frontman, and described the group&#x27;s debut as mainly a &quot;party album&quot; best remembered for its ballads. The critical and commercial success of &quot;Skid Row&quot; made the band a regular feature in rock magazines such as &quot;Hit Parader&quot;, &quot;Circus&quot;, and &quot;Metal Edge&quot; in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

In 2022, Loudwire placed the album at No. 4 on their list of the &quot;Top 30 Hair Metal Albums&quot;, saying Skid Row &quot;were decidedly more edgy [than other hair metal bands of the decade], focusing more on razor sharp riffs than razor-slashed stage wear&quot;.

==Promotion and touring==
The 17-month worldwide tour included an appearance at Moscow Music Peace Festival in August 1989 to a crowd of 70,000. The event was organized by McGhee as a penance for drug smuggling and featured artists managed by him or his brother. Skid Row made its UK debut at the Milton Keynes Bowl supporting Bon Jovi, and headlined London&#x27;s Hammersmith Odeon two months later. After finishing the tour in support of Bon Jovi&#x27;s &quot;New Jersey&quot; album, Skid Row opened on Aerosmith&#x27;s Pump Tour, which launched in October 1989 and lasted a year. At the concert in Springfield, Massachusetts in December, a fan threw a bottle onstage during Skid Row&#x27;s set. Upset, Bach threw the bottle back into the crowd and hit a 17-year-old female fan in the face. The incident was filmed by a fan and Bach was arrested after the show. He was set free on $10,000 bail and received three years of probation. At another show in 1990, Bach wore a T-shirt with the anti-gay slogan &quot;AIDS Kills Fags Dead&quot;. Bach said he put the T-shirt on after a fan threw it onstage, but later regretted the incident, saying he does not support homophobia. Thanks to heavy touring and the band&#x27;s exposure on MTV, &quot;Skid Row&quot; quickly went platinum and remained a &quot;Billboard&quot; top 10 album three months after its release. The album spawned three singles: &quot;Youth Gone Wild&quot;, &quot;18 and Life&quot;, and &quot;I Remember You&quot;, of which the last two charted in the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Piece of Me&quot; was released as a promo single and also featured a music video.

<text>David Ryan Adams (born November 5, 1974) is an American rock and country singer-songwriter. He has released 30 studio albums and three as a former member of Whiskeytown.

In 2000, Adams left Whiskeytown and released his debut solo album, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, to critical acclaim. The album was nominated for the Shortlist Music Prize. The following year, his profile increased with the release of the UK certified-gold &quot;Gold&quot;, which included the single &quot;New York, New York&quot;. During this time, Adams worked on several unreleased albums, which were consolidated into a third solo release, &quot;Demolition&quot; (2002). Working at a prolific rate, Adams released the classic rock-influenced &quot;Rock N Roll&quot; (2003), after a planned album, &quot;Love Is Hell&quot;, was rejected by his label Lost Highway. As a compromise, &quot;Love Is Hell&quot; was released as two EPs and eventually released in its full-length state in 2004.

After breaking his wrist during a live performance, Ryan Adams took a hiatus and formed a backing band called The Cardinals, who supported him on his next four studio albums. In 2009, due to complications from Ménière&#x27;s disease, Adams disbanded The Cardinals and took a break from music. However, he returned to the music scene in 2010, releasing his 13th studio album, &quot;Ashes &amp; Fire&quot;. Adams continued his musical journey by releasing his 14th album, &quot;Ryan Adams&quot; in 2014.

In 2015, Adams gained attention for his cover album &quot;1989&quot;, a song-for-song cover of Taylor Swift&#x27;s album of the same name. In 2019, several women accused Adams of sexual harassment, leading to a delay in the release of three planned albums. Adams later issued an apology and eventually released six more albums between 2020 and 2022. In addition to his own material, Adams has also produced albums for Willie Nelson, Jesse Malin, Jenny Lewis, and Fall Out Boy, and has collaborated with Counting Crows, Weezer, Norah Jones, America, Minnie Driver, Cowboy Junkies, Leona Naess, Toots and the Maytals, Beth Orton and Krista Polvere. He has written &quot;Infinity Blues&quot;, a book of poems, and &quot;Hello Sunshine&quot;, a collection of poems and short stories.

==Early life==
David Ryan Adams was born on November 5, 1974, in Jacksonville, North Carolina. He is the middle child of three, with an older brother and younger sister. His childhood has been described as &quot;dysfunctional&quot;. His father left when he was five at which time he, his mother and his siblings had to move in with his grandparents since they became homeless as a result of the divorce. He has said in an interview, &quot;I became who I am now because of my grandparents&quot; and of his grandmother &quot;...she was like a mother to me.&quot; His mother remarried when he was 13.

At the age of eight, Adams began writing short stories and limericks on his grandmother&#x27;s typewriter. In his own words, &quot;I started writing short stories when I was really into Edgar Allan Poe. Then later, when I was a teenager, I got really hard into cult fiction: Hubert Selby, Jr., Henry Miller, Jack Kerouac.&quot; At 14, Adams began learning to play an electric guitar his mother and stepfather had bought him and soon joined a local band named Blank Label. While they quickly disbanded, they did record a short three-track 7-inch record, in 1991.

Adams dropped out of Jacksonville High School in 10th grade, at the age of 16, subsequently moving into bandmate Jere McIlwean&#x27;s rental house, just outside Jacksonville. Around this time, he played and performed with a number of local bands, most notably his and McIlwean&#x27;s The Patty Duke Syndrome. After obtaining his GED, Adams left Jacksonville for Raleigh, shortly followed by McIlwean. The Patty Duke Syndrome broke up in 1994 after releasing a split 7-inch single with GlamourPuss.

== Career ==

===Whiskeytown===
Following the breakup of his high school band, The Patty Duke Syndrome, Adams helped found Whiskeytown with Caitlin Cary, Eric &quot;Skillet&quot; Gilmore, Steve Grothmann and Phil Wandscher. Whiskeytown saw Adams move to alt-country, describing punk rock as &quot;too hard to sing&quot; in the title track of Whiskeytown&#x27;s debut album &quot;Faithless Street&quot;. Whiskeytown was heavily influenced by a number of country-rock pioneers, most notably Gram Parsons. The band quickly gained critical acclaim with the release of their second full-length album, &quot;Strangers Almanac&quot;, their first major label release. A third album, &quot;Pneumonia,&quot; was completed in 1999, but record label problems delayed its release. It was eventually released by Lost Highway in 2001, at which time the band was effectively done.

===Solo career (2000–2004)===
Adams made his solo debut in 2000, with &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; (produced by Ethan Johns). Emmylou Harris sang backup on &quot;Oh My Sweet Carolina&quot;. Other backing vocals and instruments were provided by Gillian Welch, David Rawlings, Pat Sansone, and Kim Richey as Adams embraced a style more reminiscent of folk music. It was met with considerable critical success, but sales were slow.

Adams released &quot;Gold&quot;, the follow-up to &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, in 2001. It was well received. Adams, however, initially refused to promote the record through radio station meet-and-greets and other music-industry conventions, instead opting for more recording and some live dates. A video was eventually made for the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;New York, New York&quot;. The music video featured Adams performing in front of the city&#x27;s skyline four days before the September 11 attacks. The video was played often on MTV and VH1 after the attacks and became Adams&#x27;s breakthrough to mainstream music consumers.

Following the success of &quot;Gold&quot;, in 2002 Adams was blocked by his label from releasing his choice for a follow-up album. This would be the second time, the first being with &quot;Gold;&quot; Adams had recorded &quot;the Suicide Handbook&quot; which was rejected on the grounds that it was &quot;too sad&quot;. The label opted this time around to cherry pick (without Adams&#x27; involvement) from four of Adams&#x27; recorded albums it had already dismissed as unreleasable (48 Hours, The Suicide Handbook, The Pinkhearts and The Swedish Sessions) to create &quot;Demolition,&quot; released in September 2002. Although the album garnered him more critical attention, it failed to sell as well as &quot;Gold&quot;. The same year, Adams produced Jesse Malin&#x27;s first album, &quot;The Fine Art of Self Destruction&quot;, and later worked with Malin to form the punk-rock group The Finger (under the pseudonyms, &quot;Warren Peace&quot; and &quot;Irving Plaza&quot; respectively), who released two E.P.s which were collected together to form &quot;We Are Fuck You&quot;, released on One Little Indian Records in 2003. He also starred in a Gap advertisement with Willie Nelson, performing a cover of Hank Williams&#x27;s &quot;Move It on Over&quot;.

In May 2002, Adams joined Elton John on &quot;CMT Crossroads&quot;, which brings together country artists with musicians from other genres. During the show, John referred to Adams as &quot;fabulous one&quot; and spoke of how &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; inspired him to record &quot;Songs from the West Coast&quot;, which at the time was his most successful album in several years. Also in 2002, Adams reportedly recorded a cover of The Strokes&#x27; debut album &quot;Is This It&quot;, though it has never been publicly released.

In 2002 and 2003, Adams worked on recording &quot;Love Is Hell&quot;, intending to release it in 2003. Lost Highway Records deemed that it was not commercially viable and was reluctant to release it, leading Adams to go back to the studio. Two weeks later he returned to Lost Highway with &quot;Rock n Roll&quot;, which featured guest musicians including Melissa Auf der Maur, Green Day&#x27;s Billie Joe Armstrong, and Adams&#x27;s girlfriend at the time, Parker Posey. Adams&#x27; songwriting received additional exposure when Joan Baez included his song &quot;In My Time of Need&quot;, from his debut release, on her 2003 album &quot;Dark Chords on a Big Guitar.&quot;

Also released in 2003, Adams formed a punk band called The Finger with Jesse Malin, Colin Burns, and Johnny T. Yerington.[1] The name derived from notorious early/mid-1990s Raleigh, North Carolina rock band Finger, of which Adams was a big fan. This light-hearted project allowed both artists to return to their punk backgrounds (Adams began his music career as singer for The Patty Duke Syndrome and Malin began his career in the hardcore punk band Heart Attack and more famously as the lead singer of D Generation). They began by releasing two EPs: &quot;We Are Fuck You&quot; and &quot;Punk&#x27;s Dead Let&#x27;s Fuck&quot; which were later collected to form the album &quot;We Are Fuck You&quot; that was released in 2003.

Adams and Lost Highway Records eventually agreed that the label would release &quot;Rock N Roll&quot; as well as &quot;Love Is Hell&quot;, on the condition that &quot;Love Is Hell&quot; be split into two EP installments. &quot;Rock N Roll&quot; and &quot;Love Is Hell, Pt. 1&quot; were released in November 2003, followed by &quot;Love Is Hell, Pt. 2&quot; in December. Both albums were well received by critics, and in May 2004 &quot;Love Is Hell&quot; was re-released as a full-length album.

&quot;Love Is Hell&quot; included a cover of Oasis&#x27; &quot;Wonderwall&quot;, which Adams had previously performed live, and about which Noel Gallagher once said, &quot;I never got my head round this song until I went to [see] Ryan Adams play and he did an amazing cover of it.&quot; The song earned Adams a Grammy nomination for &quot;Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance&quot;.

While on tour to support &quot;Love Is Hell&quot; in January 2004, Adams fractured his wrist during a performance at the Royal Court Theatre in Liverpool. Adams fell off the end of the stage into the lowered orchestra pit six feet below, while performing &quot;The Shadowlands&quot;. Dates from Adams&#x27;s European and American tours had to be canceled as a result of his injury.

Adams was featured on the album &quot;True Love&quot; by Toots and the Maytals, which won the Grammy Award in 2004 for Best Reggae Album, and showcased many notable musicians including Willie Nelson, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Trey Anastasio, Gwen Stefani / No Doubt, Ben Harper, Bonnie Raitt, Manu Chao, The Roots, Keith Richards, Toots Hibbert, Paul Douglas, Jackie Jackson, Ken Boothe, and The Skatalites.

===The Cardinals (2005–2009)===
The year 2005 saw Adams join with backing band the Cardinals to produce two albums, &quot;Cold Roses&quot; and &quot;Jacksonville City Nights&quot;. &quot;Cold Roses&quot;, a double album, included backing vocals from Rachael Yamagata on three songs; &quot;Let It Ride&quot;, &quot;Cold Roses&quot; and &quot;Friends&quot;. His second album of the year, &quot;Jacksonville City Nights&quot;, featured a duet with Norah Jones on &quot;Dear John&quot;. As well as releasing two albums with The Cardinals, Adams released the solo album &quot;29&quot; late in the year.

Adams befriended Phil Lesh of the Grateful Dead, after first meeting him at the Jammys awards in New York in 2005. The two performed Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter&#x27;s Grateful Dead classic, &quot;Wharf Rat&quot;. Adams performed at subsequent outings of Phil Lesh and Friends, including a two-night stand at Red Rocks Amphitheatre outside of Denver, Colorado and on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2005 at the Bill Graham Event Center in San Francisco. Throughout 2006, Lesh&#x27;s live performances included compositions by Adams, including several from &quot;Cold Roses&quot; (&quot;Cold Roses&quot;, &quot;Let It Ride&quot;, and &quot;Magnolia Mountain&quot;).

Adams produced Willie Nelson&#x27;s album &quot;Songbird&quot;, while he and The Cardinals performed as Nelson&#x27;s backing band. The album was released in October 2006. He also opened for Nelson at the Hollywood Bowl later that fall, a show that featured Phil Lesh on bass and multiple Grateful Dead songs. Late in 2006, Adams experimented with hip hop music, adding to his web site 18 albums worth of new recordings under various pseudonyms, featuring humorous and nonsensical lyrics, as well as covers of two Bob Dylan songs (&quot;Isis&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re a Big Girl Now&quot;).

Adams released his ninth album on June 26, 2007, titled &quot;Easy Tiger&quot;. The album includes many tracks which were debuted during 2006&#x27;s tours, as well as other older tracks which were previously unreleased.

On October 23, 2007, Adams released &quot;Follow the Lights&quot;, an EP featuring three new songs: &quot;Follow the Lights&quot;,&quot;Blue Hotel&quot; and &quot;My Love for You Is Real&quot;, along with live studio versions of other previously released songs and a cover of Alice in Chains&#x27; &quot;Down In A Hole&quot;. Adams also appeared as a guest musician on Cowboy Junkies&#x27; 2007 album and DVD &quot;Trinity Revisited&quot;, a 20th-anniversary re-recording of their classic album &quot;The Trinity Session&quot;. In 2007 Adams co-wrote a song with Australian singer-songwriter Krista Polvere for her debut record &quot;Here Be Dragons&quot;; he also played guitar and piano on the album, which was recorded in New York.

A new album with The Cardinals, &quot;Cardinology&quot; was released on October 28, 2008. Adams has also announced plans to release a book, entitled &quot;Infinity Blues&quot;. According to Lost Highway chairman, Luke Lewis, there will be an &quot;anthology&quot; release in 2009, featuring several new songs.

On January 14, 2009, Ryan Adams announced that he was quitting the Cardinals after their final show on March 20, 2009, at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta. Adams cited hearing loss due to Ménière&#x27;s disease as well as disillusionment with the music industry, the media and audience behavior as reasons for his decision. He also stated that he has been working on two new books, in addition to &quot;Infinity Blues&quot;. The second book, released in the fall of 2009, is entitled &quot;Hello Sunshine&quot;. Preorders of &quot;Hello Sunshine&quot; were shipped on August 18 by publisher Akashic Books.

===Post-Cardinals (2009)===
In May 2009, drummer Brad Pemberton stated that: &quot;everyone was a bit fried, so it was the right time to step back for a minute. I encouraged Ryan to go and get married, and have a life and find some peace; the guy hasn&#x27;t really slowed down in ten years, and he needed it as much as we did. Ryan and I have shared too much and are too good of friends to not ever do anything again, but I think we all need to do our own thing for a minute.&quot;
The Cardinals, without Adams, have recorded together alongside Gin Wigmore for her debut album.
Adams has dismissed any possibility of a reunion in the near future, saying it wouldn&#x27;t be right after the death of Cardinals bassist Chris &#x27;Spacewolf&#x27; Feinstein.

In August 2009, Adams began posting on the fan-site, Ryan Adams Archive, discussing the possibility of a Whiskeytown reunion, new songs and releasing his many &#x27;unreleased&#x27; albums. In August, Adams also began blogging for The Awl. In September 2009, Adams debuted a new song online, entitled &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;, and began releasing singles, featuring previously unreleased material, from his new record label, PAX AM.

Casal released a photo-book, &quot;Ryan Adams &amp; the Cardinals: A View of Other Windows&quot;, in February 2010, documenting his time within the band.

===PAX AM and return to music (2010–2013)===
In March 2010, Adams announced a new metal-influenced album, entitled &quot;Orion&quot;, to be released on his PAX AM label. &quot;Orion&quot; was released on vinyl only on May 18, 2010, and was sold through the PAX AM online store. According to Adams&#x27;s Facebook page, he had completed two unreleased albums, &quot;Blackhole&quot; and &quot;Cardinals III/IV&quot;, and was currently recording new albums in both New York City and Los Angeles.

On October 29, 2010, Adams played his first live show since stepping down from the Cardinals in March 2009, at a benefit hosted by Judd Apatow. He was backed by Marshall Vore, Sebastian Steinberg and former Cardinal Jamie Candiloro, who were billed as &quot;The Ryan Adams Band&quot;. They debuted three new songs and were joined onstage by Mandy Moore for &quot;Oh My Sweet Carolina&quot;.

In November 2010, Adams announced the release of &quot;Cardinals III/IV&quot;, his twelfth studio album, which was recorded in 2006. This album is his fifth with The Cardinals and was released on December 14, 2010, through PAX AM.

In 2011, Adams announced a European tour, and noted that he was working on a new studio album with producer Glyn Johns.

On April 21, 2011, Adams was the surprise opener for an Emmylou Harris show at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles. He performed several new songs, as well as &quot;Oh My Sweet Carolina&quot; with Emmy, a track they recorded for 2000&#x27;s &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;.

On June 16, 2011, through his Twitter account, Ryan suggested that his album &quot;Blackhole&quot; could be released around Christmas.

In the September 2011 issue of &quot;Q Magazine&quot;, Ryan revealed details of his first solo release since leaving The Cardinals, entitled &quot;Ashes &amp; Fire&quot;. He also discussed the possibility of releasing a third book, &quot;Phoenix&quot;, which he says concerns &quot;a loveable rat.&quot;

In early 2012, Ryan was nominated for a Brit Award for Best International Male. On June 18, 2012, Adams released a live box set chronicling his return to live performances, entitled &quot;Live After Deaf&quot;. His album &quot;Ashes &amp; Fire&quot; was nominated for the 55th Annual GRAMMY Awards.

On April 21, 2013, Adams released an EP, &quot;7 Minutes in Heaven&quot;, with his newly formed punk rock band Pornography, featuring Make Out vocalist Leah Hennessey and frequent collaborator Johnny T. Yerington. In July 2013, Adams collaborated as a producer with rock band Fall Out Boy at his PAX AM Studio, which resulted in Fall Out Boy&#x27;s &quot;PAX AM Days&quot; EP. On March 19, 2013, Ryan played a live show with a full band for the first time since the Cardinals disbanded. The show was for Noel Gallagher&#x27;s Teenage Cancer Trust benefit. The venue&#x27;s website stated that Ryan was playing new songs from a forthcoming album.

===Self-titled studio album, PAX AM Single Series, &quot;1989&quot; and &quot;Prisoner&quot; (2014–2018)===

On July 1, 2014, stories emerged that a self-titled album, &quot;Ryan Adams&quot;, would be released on September 9, 2014. Since this announcement, Adams has released a 7-inch vinyl EP, entitled &quot;1984&quot; and announced tour dates through mid October 2014. He debuted several new songs from the self-titled album in a series of festival concerts in late July 2014. On September 9, 2014, the self-titled album &quot;Ryan Adams&quot; was released on PAX-AM records.

In addition to the self-titled album, Adams announced a project he calls the &quot;PAX AM Single Series&quot;, with a new seven-inch release each month. Adams stated, &quot;I&#x27;m going to release a single every month until I can&#x27;t do it any more.&quot; The first of these releases, the &quot;1984&quot; EP, was released in August 2014 and is described by Adams as, &quot;pay[ing] homage to the halcyon days of the earliest releases from [record labels] Dischord, SST, Touch &amp; Go and their ilk.&quot; In 2014 and 2015, Adams continued to release digital singles, with each single being accompanied by at least 2 B-sides. Singles in 2014 included &quot;Jacksonville&quot;, &quot;Vampires&quot;, and &quot;Do You Laugh When You Lie?&quot;, while singles in 2015 included &quot;No Shadow&quot; (featuring actor Johnny Depp, who had previously appeared on his self-titled album), &quot;Blue Light&quot;, &quot;I Do Not Feel Like Being Good&quot;, &quot;Willow Lane&quot;, and &quot;Burn in the Night&quot;. Often selling out within minutes of being released through PAX AM&#x27;s website, the singles remain available for digital download.

On December 5, 2014, &quot;Gimme Something Good&quot;, a song from the &quot;Ryan Adams&quot; album, was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song.

On August 5, 2015, Adams announced via Instagram that he was going to cover and release his version of Taylor Swift&#x27;s 2014 album &quot;&quot;1989&quot;&quot;. He released multiple clips via Twitter and Instagram showcasing his takes on Swift&#x27;s songs. Adams&#x27; &quot;1989&quot; was released on September 21, 2015. It debuted at No. 7 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, one position ahead of Swift&#x27;s &quot;1989&quot;, which was in its 48th week on the chart. Adams said in October 2016 that he would never cover another full album again following the recording of &quot;1989&quot;.

On December 6, 2016, Ryan Adams announced a new album, &quot;Prisoner&quot;. It was released on PAX AM/Blue Note on February 17, 2017. The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Do You Still Love Me?&quot; was released on December 7, 2016 and the second single, &quot;To Be Without You&quot; was released on December 23, 2016.

In 2018, Adams released a stand-alone single, &quot;Baby I Love You&quot;, and contributed one song, &quot;20th Call of the Day&quot;, to the &quot;Juliet, Naked&quot; soundtrack.

===&quot;Wednesdays&quot;, &quot;Big Colors&quot;, &quot;Chris&quot;, and further albums (2019–present)===
In January 2019, Adams announced his plans to release three albums that calendar year. The first, &quot;Big Colors&quot;, was due to be released April 19 and feature 15 tracks. The second, &quot;Wednesdays&quot;, was to feature 17 tracks and did not yet have a confirmed release date. The release of all three albums was put on hold after the &quot;New York Times&quot; broke allegations of sexual misconduct. After a five-month silence, Adams returned in July 2019, posting a soundboard recording of a song titled &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry and I Love You&quot;. On December 11, 2020, Adams eventually surprise-released &quot;Wednesdays&quot;, which features &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry and I Love You&quot; as well as several tracks originally announced for inclusion on &quot;Big Colors&quot;. A music video for &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry and I Love You&quot; was uploaded to YouTube on December 15, 2020. Its description mentions that &quot;Wednesdays&quot; is the first in a trilogy of albums, including &quot;Big Colors&quot; and &quot;Chris&quot;.

On April 23, 2021, Adams surprise-released &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; as the lead single from the revised edition of &quot;Big Colors&quot;. The album was released on June 11, 2021, with a different track listing from the one announced in 2019.

On March 2, 2022, Adams announced his first headlining show since the &quot;New York Times&quot; article. It sold out within hours and took place at Carnegie Hall on May 14. Additional concerts were announced later in March, with another batch announced in June. On March 25, Adams released &quot;Chris&quot; as the final installment of the trilogy. It was followed by four other albums: &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; on April 25, &quot;FM&quot; on July 22, &quot;Devolver&quot; on September 23, and &quot;Nebraska&quot; on December 7, a cover of the Bruce Springsteen album of the same name. &quot;Devolver&quot; was released as a free download along with a statement from Adams thanking his fans for their support. He announced further shows in Fall and Winter of 2022 and then his long-awaited return to the U.K. for April 2023. On December 26, 2022, Adams released a cover of the Bob Dylan album &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;, and on April 14, 2023, he released a cover of the Oasis album &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;, which also included covers of b-sides from that album&#x27;s singles.

On January 1, 2024, Adams surprise-released four more studio albums: &quot;Sword &amp; Stone&quot;, &quot;Star Sign&quot;, &quot;Heatwave&quot; and &quot;1985&quot;, as well as a live version of &quot;Prisoner&quot;.

== Personal life ==

===Relationships and health===
Adams was engaged to singer-songwriter Leona Naess, but the engagement ended in 2003. From 2003 to 2005 Adams dated actress Parker Posey. In 2008, Adams began dating singer-songwriter and actress Mandy Moore. They became engaged in February 2009 and they were married on March 10, 2009, in Savannah, Georgia. On January 23, 2015, Adams and Moore announced in a joint statement that they were separating. The divorce was finalized in June 2016.

In 2007, Adams stated that he doesn&#x27;t drink or take drugs. He revealed that he had endured &quot;an extended period of substance abuse&quot; that ended in 2006. He indicated that he routinely snorted heroin mixed with cocaine, and abused alcohol and pills. He beat his addiction with the assistance of his girlfriend at the time, Jessica Joffe, using Valium therapy and occasionally attending twelve-step meetings. In the following years, he made several statements indicating he was &quot;newly sober&quot; and he told TMZ in June 2022 that he had reached nine months of sobriety. He celebrated one year of sobriety with the free release of his album &quot;Devolver&quot; on September 23, 2022.

Adams has Ménière&#x27;s disease and tinnitus. A flyer advising of Adams&#x27; condition is affixed to the first several rows of seats at his concerts, with the admonition for audience members to refrain from taking flash photos or using autofocus assist beams when photographing at his shows. Adams has also openly spoken about experiencing depression and anxiety.

===Disputes with fans and other artists===
At a concert in October 2002, at Nashville&#x27;s Ryman Auditorium, someone in the audience yelled out a request for &quot;Summer of &#x27;69&quot;, a song by the similarly named Bryan Adams. Adams reacted with a stream of expletives, and ordered the house lights turned on, &quot;The Tennessean&quot; newspaper reported. He eventually found the fan who made the joke-request, paid him $30 cash as a refund for the show, ordered him to leave, and said he would not play another note until he had left. In a 2014 interview, Ryan Adams denied that the audience-member was asked to leave &quot;for screaming a Bryan Adams song&quot;, but rather because the man was drunk: &quot;The reason why the guy was asked to leave by me was because I was doing an a-capella three-piece with Gillian Welch, David Rawlings, and myself of &#x27;Bartering Lines&#x27;, and in between the quiet parts the guy was screaming.&quot; In April 2015, Ryan Adams, who had since become friends with Bryan Adams, played &quot;Summer of &#x27;69&quot; at the end of another performance at the Ryman in Nashville, an act described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;an olive branch to the city that was once his home&quot;.

Adams left an angry message on critic Jim DeRogatis&#x27;s answering-machine, in response to a scathing review DeRogatis gave of an Adams show in 2003.

During filming of the BBC&#x27;s long-running show &quot;Songwriter&#x27;s Circle&quot;, where Adams was joined by American folk-singer Janis Ian and New Zealand&#x27;s Neil Finn, it was reported that he refused to participate in a number of the songs performed on the night and was generally dismissive of collaborating with the others. The fallout from the show resulted in an online to-and-fro argument between Adams, Ian, and members of the public, who cited Adams&#x27;s rude behavior and eccentric demeanor toward his colleagues. In August 2017, Adams singled out Father John Misty for criticism, while a month earlier he made derogatory remarks about the Strokes through social media.

===Harassment allegations===
On February 13, 2019, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that seven women (including Phoebe Bridgers and ex-wife Mandy Moore) said Adams offered to assist them with their music careers, then pursued the women romantically. They also claimed that Adams retaliated when they spurned his advances, hindering their careers and harassing them in text messages and on social media. The accusations surfaced in the context of the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment. Adams initially denied the accusations but in July 2020, he issued a statement in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; apologizing for his actions.

== Recognition ==
Adams is recognized for his highly prolific songwriting and a singing style that resembles that of a country rocker, even though he played punk rock in the early part of his career. Adams has frequently experimented with different genres, although for the major part of his career his musical style has been alternative rock. He is also one of the few artists to emerge from the alt-country scene into mainstream commercial success.

His musical style and dynamism has been praised by various artists like Frank Turner, Elton John, Willie Nelson, Taylor Swift, Norah Jones, Wesley Schultz, Jared Followill and Noel Gallagher. American author Stephen King is historically a fan of Adams, stating in 2007, &quot;I won&#x27;t say Adams is the best North American singer songwriter since Neil Young... but I won&#x27;t say he isn&#x27;t either&quot;.

<text>The 2nd Infantry Division (2ID, 2nd ID) (&quot;Indianhead&quot;) is a formation of the United States Army. Since the 1960s, its primary mission has been the pre-emptive defense of South Korea in the event of an invasion from North Korea. Approximately 17,000 soldiers serve in the 2nd Infantry Division, with 10,000 stationed in South Korea, accounting for about 35% of the United States Forces Korea personnel. Known as the 2nd Infantry Division-ROK/U.S. Combined Division (2ID/RUCD), the division is bolstered by rotational Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) from other U.S. Army divisions.

The 2nd Infantry Division is unique as the only U.S. Army division to incorporate South Korean soldiers through the KATUSA (Korean Augmentation to the U.S. Army) program, which began in 1950 with the agreement of South Korean President Syngman Rhee. By the end of the Korean War, around 27,000 KATUSAs had served with U.S. forces. As of May 2006, roughly 1,100 KATUSA soldiers are assigned to 2ID. Between 1950 and 1954, over 4,748 Dutch soldiers also served with the division.

==History==

===World War I===
The 2nd Division was first constituted on 21 September 1917 in the Regular Army. It was organized on 26 October 1917 at Bourmont, Haute Marne, France.

Twice during World War I the division was commanded by US Marine Corps generals, Brigadier General Charles A. Doyen and Major General John A. Lejeune (after whom the Marine Corps Camp in North Carolina is named), the only time in U.S. military history when Marine Corps officers commanded an Army division.

The division spent the winter of 1917–18 training with French and Scottish veterans. Though judged unprepared by French tacticians, the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) was committed to combat in the spring of 1918 in a desperate attempt to halt a German advance toward Paris. Major General Edward Mann Lewis Commanded the 3rd Brigade as they deployed to reinforce the battered French along the Paris to Metz road. The division first fought at the Battle of Belleau Wood and contributed to shattering the four-year-old stalemate on the battlefield during the Château-Thierry campaign that followed.

On 28 July 1918, Marine Corps Major General Lejeune assumed command of the 2nd Division and remained in that capacity until August 1919, when the unit returned to the US. The division went on to win hard-fought victories at Soissons and Blanc Mont. Finally the Indianhead Division participated in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive which ended any German hope for victory. On 11 November 1918 the Armistice was declared, and the 2nd Division entered Germany, where it assumed occupation duties until April 1919.

The 2nd Division was three times awarded the French Croix de guerre for gallantry under fire at Belleau Wood, Soissons, and Blanc Mont. This entitles current members of the division and of those regiments that were part of the division at that time (including the 5th and 6th Marine Regiments) to wear a special lanyard, or fourragère, in commemoration. The Navy authorized a special uniform change that allows hospital corpsmen assigned to 5th and 6th Marine Regiments to wear a shoulder strap on the left shoulder of their dress uniform so that the fourragère can be worn.

The division lost 1,964 (plus USMC: 4,478) killed in action and 9,782 (plus USMC: 17,752) wounded in action.

====Major operations====

* Third Battle of the Aisne
* Belleau Wood
* Château-Thierry campaign
* St. Mihiel
* Meuse-Argonne Offensive
* Aisne-Marne offensive

===Interwar years===

The 2nd Division arrived at Hoboken, New Jersey, on 3 August 1919 after completing 8 months of occupation duty near Koblenz, Heddesdorf, and Dierdorf, Germany. It moved to Camp Mills, New York, where all emergency period personnel were discharged from the service, and the 4th Marine Brigade was relieved from assignment to the division. It proceeded to Camp Travis, in San Antonio, Texas, on 16 August 1919 where it remained until Camp Travis was absorbed into Fort Sam Houston in 1922. The 4th Infantry Brigade (consisting of the 1st and 20th Infantry Regiments) was assigned to replace the 4th Marine Brigade in the division structure, and was activated in October 1920 at Camp Travis. The division was allotted to the Eighth Corps Area and the VIII Corps in 1921. The 2nd Division was the most combat-ready division stationed in the continental United States during most of the interwar period, given that the majority of the unit was stationed at a single post and the division headquarters staff was not allowed to atrophy like those of the 1st or 3rd Divisions, the other two nominally active stateside Regular Army divisions. 

During the early post-World War I period, the division’s time was spent rebuilding and training on a limited scale. The slow pace left time for the division to assist Hollywood in making movies about the Army. Division units participated in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer’s movie &quot;The Big Parade&quot; in May and June 1925 and in &quot;Wings&quot; in April 1926. By 1926, however, maneuver training of divisional units was becoming more frequent, leaving little time for movies. The maneuvers generally took place in May, before the division’s units assisted the training of Organized Reserve units, Citizens Military Training Camps (CMTC), and ROTC cadets during the summer. Typically, the division would deploy to Camp Bullis, Texas, or areas west of San Antonio, and perform field training, usually at company and battalion level. The division deployment would culminate in brigade-versus-brigade maneuvers near the end of the field training period. 

After transfer of the 4th Infantry Brigade to Fort D.A. Russell, Wyoming (later renamed Fort Francis E. Warren), in 1927, the 1st Cavalry Division&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Brigade began to road-march over from Fort Clark, Texas, to participate in combined arms maneuvers each May. Once the division maneuvers were complete, the division shifted to training the Reserve components. The 3rd Infantry Brigade usually trained Reserve officers of the 90th Division, Infantry CMTC, and ROTC cadets. Units of the 2nd Field Artillery Brigade trained the artillery officers of the 90th Division, the XVIII Corps, and several General Headquarters Reserve (GHQR) artillery units in the Eighth Corps Area. After transferring to Fort Francis E. Warren, the 4th Infantry Brigade conducted their maneuver training at the Pole Mountain Military Reservation where they also trained their affiliate Reserve units of the 104th Division. In 1936, the division participated in the Third Army command post exercise (CPX) at Camp Bullis to prepare army, corps, and division staffs for future large-scale army maneuvers. The next major training event for the division came in September 1937 when it participated in the Provisional Infantry Division (PID) tests at Camp Bullis. The “Indianhead” Division was temporarily reorganized with three regiments to test the concept of the “triangular” division. The exercise was apparently very successful as further tests were called for after analysis of the results by Army planners. The following year, units of the Eighth Corps Area including the 2nd Division were assembled at Camp Bullis for the Third Army maneuvers. In January 1939, the division was reorganized for the second time as a triangular division, this time for the Provisional 2nd Division (P2D) tests. These tests finalized the decision to adopt the new triangular organization for Regular Army divisions. As a result, in October 1939, the division’s 4th Infantry Brigade was disbanded, the 1st and 20th Infantry Regiments were relieved from assignment, and the 38th Infantry Regiment was assigned to the division to make its transition to the triangular concept complete. 

In May 1940, the “Indianhead” Division deployed to the vicinity of Horton, Texas, to train under the new organization in preparation for the next Third Army maneuver. The 1940 Third Army maneuvers were held in west-central Louisiana in August 1940 and were primarily performed with the Regular Army and National Guard divisions stationed in the Fourth and Eighth Corps Areas. After the exercises in Louisiana, the “Indianhead” Division returned to Fort Sam Houston. The following June, the division moved to Brownwood, Texas, to participate in the VIII Corps maneuver held there that month. In August 1941, the division, now redesignated as the 2nd Infantry Division, returned to the Louisiana Maneuver Area for the GHQ maneuvers between the Second and Third Armies, after which it returned to its home station.

On 27 July 1942, the division was again transferred to the Louisiana Maneuver Area, remaining there until 22 September 1942, whereupon the formation again returned to Fort Sam Houston. It then moved to Camp McCoy at Sparta, Wisconsin, on 27 November 1942. Four months of intensive training for winter warfare followed. In September 1943 the division received its staging orders, and moved to the Camp Shanks staging area at Orangeburg, New York on 3 October 1943, where it received port call orders. On 8 October the division officially sailed from the New York Port of Embarkation, and started arriving in Belfast, Northern Ireland on 17 October. It then moved to England, where it trained and staged for forward movement to France.

====Narrative====

After training in Northern Ireland and Wales from October 1943 to June 1944, the 2nd Infantry Division crossed the channel to land on Omaha Beach on D plus 1 (7 June 1944) near Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer, however around 150 men from the 9th &amp; 23rd Infantry Regiments and 2nd Combat Engineer Battalion volunteered to assist the operations of the Special Engineer Task Force and their Operations on June 6th, these men were disperse into the various Assault Gap Teams of the 146th &amp; 299th Combat Engineer Battalions and landed with them at H-Plus 3 at Omaha Beach. Attacking across the Aure River on 10 June, the division liberated Trévières and proceeded to assault and secure Hill 192, a key enemy strong point on the road to Saint-Lo. After three weeks of fortifying the position and by order of Commanding General Walter M. Robertson, the order was given to take Hill 192. On 11 July under the command of Col. Ralph Wise Zwicker the 38th Infantry Regiment and with the 9th and the 23rd by his side the battle began at 5:45am. Using an artillery concept from World War I (rolling barrage) and with the support of 25,000 rounds of HE/WP that were fired by 8 artillery battalions, the hill was taken. Except for three days during the Battle of the Bulge, this was the heaviest expenditure of ammunition by the 38th Field Artillery Battalion, and it was the only time during the 11 months of combat that 2nd Division artillery used a rolling barrage. The division went on the defensive until 26 July. After exploiting the Saint-Lo breakout, the 2nd Division then advanced across the Vire to take Tinchebray on 15 August 1944. The division then raced toward Brest, the heavily defended port fortress that was a major port for German U-boats. After 39 days of fighting the Battle for Brest was won, and was the first place the Army Air Forces used bunker busting bombs.

The division took a brief rest 19–26 September before moving to defensive positions at St. Vith, Belgium on 29 September 1944. The division entered Germany on 3 October 1944, and was ordered, on 11 December 1944, to attack and seize the Roer River dams. The German Ardennes offensive in mid-December forced the division to withdraw to defensive positions near Elsenborn Ridge, where the German drive was halted. In February 1945 the division attacked, recapturing lost ground, and seized Gemund, 4 March. Reaching the Rhine on 9 March, the division advanced south to take Breisig, 10–11 March, and to guard the Remagen bridge, 12–20 March.

The division crossed the Rhine on 21 March and advanced to Hadamar and Limburg an der Lahn, relieving elements of the 9th Armored Division, 28 March. Advancing rapidly in the wake of the 9th Armored, the 2nd Infantry Division crossed the Weser at Veckerhagen, 6–7 April, captured Göttingen 8 April, established a bridgehead across the Saale, 14 April, seizing Merseburg on 15 April. On 18 April the division took Leipzig, mopped up in the area, and outposted the Mulde River; elements which had crossed the river were withdrawn 24 April. Relieved on the Mulde, the 2nd moved 200 miles, 1–3 May, to positions along the German-Czech border near Schönsee and Waldmünchen, where 2 ID relieved the 97th and 99th IDs. The division crossed over to Czechoslovakia on 4 May 1945, and attacked in the general direction of Pilsen, attacking that city on VE Day. The division lost 3,031 killed in action, 12,785 wounded in action, and 457 died of wounds.
The 2nd Infantry Division returned to the New York Port of Embarkation on 20 July 1945, and arrived at Camp Swift at Bastrop, Texas on 22 July 1945. They started a training schedule to prepare them to participate in the scheduled invasion of Japan, but they were still at Camp Swift on VJ Day. They then moved to the staging area at Camp Stoneman at Pittsburg, California on 28 March 1946, but the move eastward was canceled, and they received orders to move to Fort Lewis at Tacoma, Washington. They arrived at Fort Lewis on 15 April 1946, which became their home station. From their Fort Lewis base, they conducted Arctic, air transportability, amphibious, and maneuver training.

===Korean War===

With the outbreak of hostilities in Korea on 25 June 1950, the 2nd Infantry Division was quickly alerted for movement to the Far East Command and assignment to the Eighth United States Army. The division arrived in Korea, via Pusan on 23 July, becoming the first unit to reach Korea directly from the United States. Initially employed piecemeal, the entire division was committed as a unit on 24 August 1950, relieving the 24th Infantry Division at the Naktong River Line. The first big test came when the North Korean Korean People&#x27;s Army (KPA) struck in a human wave attack on the night of 31 August. In the 16-day battle that followed, the division&#x27;s clerks, bandsmen, technical and supply personnel joined in the fight to defend against the attackers.

Shortly thereafter, the division was the first unit to break out of the Pusan Perimeter starting on 16 September and Eighth Army then began a general offensive northward against crumbling KPA opposition to establish contact with forces of the 7th Infantry Division driving southward from the Inchon beachhead. Major elements of the KPA were destroyed and cut off in this aggressive penetration; the link-up was effected south of Suwon on 26 September. On 23 September the division was assigned to the newly activated US IX Corps. The UN offensive was continued northwards, past Seoul, and across the 38th Parallel into North Korea on 1 October. The momentum of the attack was maintained, and the race to the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, ended on 19 October when elements of the ROK 1st Infantry Division and US 1st Cavalry Division both captured the city. The advance continued, but against unexpectedly stiffening resistance. The Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteer Army (PVA) entered the war on the side of North Korea, making their first attacks in late October. The division was within of the Manchurian border when the PVA launched their Second Phase Offensive on 25 November. During the Battle of the Ch&#x27;ongch&#x27;on River, soldiers of the 2nd Infantry Division were given the mission of protecting the rear and right flank of the Eighth Army as it retired to the south. After this battle, while surrounded and outgunned, the division had to fight its way south through what was to become known as &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; - a PVA roadblock long where the 23rd Infantry Regiment fired off its stock of 3,206 artillery shells within 20 minutes, a massive barrage that prevented PVA troops from following the regiment. A large number of documents, including all records from the US 2nd Infantry Division and the US 24th Infantry Regiment, were lost during the battle, and this made it difficult for historians to either analyze the events in detail or to assess the exact battle damage and losses incurred. However, it was later approximated that the US 2nd Infantry Division had suffered 4,037 casualties, and most of its artillery pieces, 40 percent of its signal equipment, 45 percent of its crew-served weapons, 30 percent of its vehicles were lost during the battle. Thus, the US 2nd Infantry Division was deemed to be crippled, Major General Laurence B. Keiser commander of 2nd Infantry Division was relieved from command by the end of the battle.

The Eighth Army ordered a complete withdrawal to the Imjin River, south of the 38th Parallel. On 1 January 1951, PVA troops attacked the Eighth Army&#x27;s defensive line at the Imjin River, forcing them back and allowing the PVA to capture Seoul. The PVA offensive was finally blunted by the 2nd Infantry Division on 20 January at Wonju. Following the establishment of defenses south of Seoul, General Matthew B. Ridgway ordered US I, IX and X Corps to conduct a general counteroffensive against the PVA/KPA, Operation Thunderbolt. Taking up the offensive in a two-prong attack in February 1951, the division repulsed a powerful PVA counter-offensive in the epic battles of Chipyong-ni and Wonju. The UN front was saved and the general offensive continued.

In August 1951, the division was on the offensive once again, ordered to attack a series of ridges that had been designated threats to the Eighth Army&#x27;s line. These actions would devolve into the battles of Bloody Ridge and Heartbreak Ridge. The division would not receive relief until October, with its infantry regiments having suffered heavy losses. The 23rd Infantry Regiment bore the brunt of the damage, having been severely mauled on Heartbreak Ridge. The 2nd Division was withdrawn after possessing both Bloody and Heartbreak Ridges, and the damage they inflicted upon the PVA/KPA that held the ridges was estimated at 25,000 casualties. Ridge warfare was not embarked upon again as a military strategy for the remainder of the war. In January 1953 the division was transferred from IX Corps to I Corps.

After the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed on 27 July 1953, the 2nd Infantry Division withdrew to positions south of the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Soon after the armistice, 8th United States Army commander, General Maxwell D. Taylor, appointed Brigadier General John F. R. Seitz as commander of the 2nd Infantry Division which remained on duty in Korea. Seitz commanded the division during a tense period following the armistice when both vigilance and intensive training of the Republic of Korea Army was required by the U.S. Army until the 2nd Infantry Division was redeployed to the United States in 1954.

====Awards and decorations====

===Reorganization===
After the armistice, the division remained in Korea until 1954, when it was reduced to near zero strength, the colors were transferred to Fort Lewis, Washington, Georgia and, in October 1954, the 44th Infantry Division was reflagged as the Second.

In September 1956, the division deployed to Alaska, with the division headquarters at Fort Richardson, as part of an Operation Gyroscope deployment (soldiers and families, no equipment), switching places with the 71st Infantry Division (which was reflagged as the 4th Infantry Division upon its arrival at Fort Lewis).

On 8 November 1957, it was announced that the division was to be inactivated. However, in the spring of 1958, it was announced that the division would be reorganizing at Fort Benning. Division elements were reorganized into two infantry battle groups (the 1-9 IN and the 1-23 IN) that would remain in Alaska as separate units, eventually reorganizing in 1963 as infantry battalions, as the 4-9 IN and the 4-23 IN, assigned to the 171st and 172nd Infantry Brigades, respectively.

In June 1958, the division was reorganized at Fort Benning, Georgia, as a Pentomic Division, having reflagged the 10th Infantry Division upon the latter&#x27;s return from Germany. The division&#x27;s three infantry regiments (the 9th, 23rd and 38th) were inactivated, with their elements reorganized into five infantry battle groups (the 2-9 IN, 2-23 IN, 1-87 IN, 2-1 IN and the 1-11 IN). Initially serving as a training division, it was designated as a Strategic Army Corps (STRAC) unit in March 1962.
Like with other army units such as the 7th Infantry Division, the division did not see action in the Vietnam War.

In 1963, the division was reorganized as a Reorganization Objective Army Division (ROAD). Three Brigade Headquarters were activated and Infantry units were reorganized into battalions.

===Back to South Korea===
In 1965 at Fort Benning, Georgia, the 2nd Infantry Division&#x27;s stateside units, the 11th Air Assault Division&#x27;s personnel and equipment, and the colors and unit designations of the 1st Cavalry Division, returned from South Korea, were used to form a new formation, the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile). The personnel of the existing 1st Cavalry Division in Korea took over the unit designations of the old 2nd Infantry Division. Thus, the 2nd Infantry Division formally returned to South Korea in July 1965. From 1966 onwards North Korean forces were engaging in increasing border incursions and infiltration attempts and the 2nd Infantry Division was called upon to help halt these attacks. On 2 November 1966, soldiers of the 1st Battalion, 23d Infantry Regiment were killed in an ambush by North Korean forces. In 1967 enemy attacks in the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) increased, as a result, 16 U.S. soldiers were killed that year.

In 1968 the 2nd Infantry Division was headquartered at Tonggu Ri and responsible for watching over a portion of the DMZ. In 1968 North Koreans continued to probe across the DMZ, and in 1969, while on patrol, four soldiers of 3d Battalion, 23d Infantry were killed. On 18 August 1976, during a routine tree-trimming operation within the DMZ, two American officers of the Joint Security Force (Joint Security Area) were axed to death in a melee with North Korean border guards called the Axe Murder Incident. On 21 August, following the deaths, the 2nd Infantry Division supported the United Nations Command in &quot;Operation Paul Bunyan&quot; to cut down the &quot;Panmunjeom Tree&quot;. This effort was conducted by Task Force Brady (named after the 2nd ID Commander) in support of Task Force Vierra (named after the Joint Security Area Battalion commander).

Given the task of defending likely areas of enemy advance from the north, in 1982 the division occupied 17 camps, 27 sites, and 6 combat guard posts in strategic locations such as the Western (Kaesong-Munsan) Corridor; the Chorwon-Uijongbu Valley and other areas.

=== Recent times in Korea ===
On 13 June 2002, a 2ID armored vehicle struck and killed two 14-year-old South Korean schoolgirls on the Yangju highway as the vehicle was returning to base in Uijeongbu after training maneuvers. Sergeants Mark Walker and Fernando Nino, the two soldiers involved, were found not guilty of negligent homicide in a subsequent General Court-martial. The deaths and court-martial were the subject of anti-American sentiment in South Korea; the two girls are annually memorialized near US military bases in South Korea to this day.

The 2nd Infantry Division is in South Korea, with a number of camps near the DMZ. Command headquarters are located at Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek-si, some 40 miles south of Seoul.

===Iraq War===

From November 2003 to November 2004, the 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team deployed from Fort Lewis, Washington in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In the sands of Iraq the 3rd Brigade Stryker Brigade Combat Team proved the value of the Stryker brigade concept in combat and logistics operations.

During the late spring of 2004, many of the soldiers of the 2nd Infantry Division&#x27;s 2d Brigade Combat Team were given notice that they were about to be ordered to further deployment, with duty in Iraq. Units involved in this call-up included: 1st Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment; 1st Battalion, 506th Infantry Regiment (Air Assault); 2d Battalion, 17th Field Artillery Regiment; 1st Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment (Mechanized); 44th Engineer Battalion; 2nd Forward Support Battalion; Company A, 102nd Military Intelligence Battalion; Company B, 122d Signal Battalion, elements of the 2d Battalion, 72nd Armor Regiment, a team from the 509th Personnel Services Battalion, and B Battery, 5th Battalion 5th Air Defense Artillery Regiment (Deployed as a combination of mechanized infantry and light infantry with two platoons of Bradley Fighting Vehicles and 1 platoon of armored HMMWVs). As a result of the short notice, extensive training was conducted by the brigade as they switched from a focus of the foreign defense of South Korea to the offensive operations that were going to be needed in Iraq. Furthermore, time was given for the majority of the soldiers to enjoy ten days of leave. This was vital: many of the soldiers had been in South Korea for a year or more with only two weeks or less time in the United States during their stay of duty. More, they were about to depart on a deployment scheduled to last at least another year. Finally, in August 2004, the brigade deployed to Iraq.

Upon landing in country, the 2d BCT was given strategic command to much of the sparsely populated area south and west of Fallujah. Their mission, however, changed when the major strategic actions began to take place within the city proper. At this time, the brigade combat team was refocused and given control of the eastern half of the volatile city of Ar-Ramadi. Within a few weeks of taking over operational control from the previous units, 2nd Brigade began suffering casualties from violent activity. Many of the units had to move to new camps in support of this new mission. The primary focus of the 2d BCT for much of their deployment was the struggle to gain local support and to minimize casualties.

The brigade was spread out amongst many camps. To the west of the city of Ar-Ramadi sat the camp of Junction City. 2ID units stationed there included: HQ 2d BCT, 2nd ID; 2–17th Field Artillery; 1–9th Infantry; 44th Engineer Battalion; Company A, 102d Military Intelligence Battalion; Company B, 122d Signal Battalion, and Company C (Medical), 2d Forward Support Battalion. To the eastern end of the city sat a much more austere camp, known as the Combat Outpost. This was home to the 1-503d Infantry Regiment. East of them but outside of the city proper itself was the town of Habbiniya and the 1–506th Infantry Regiment. Adjacent to this camp was the logistically important camp of Al-Taqaddum, where the 2d Forward Support Battalion was stationed.

For this mission, the brigade fell under the direct command not of the 2d Infantry Division, but rather under a Marine division. For the first six months while in Ramadi, the BCT fell under the 1st Marine Division. For the second half of the deployment, they were attached to the 2nd Marine Division. While the Marines do not wear unit patches on their uniforms, the units of the 2d BCT involved are authorized to now wear any of the following combat patches: the 2nd Infantry Division patch, the 1st Marine Division unit patch or the 2nd Marine Division unit patch.

The 2d Brigade Combat Team was in action in the city of Ramadi for many events, including the Iraqi national elections of January 2005. While the voting was accomplished and little to no violence was seen within the city, few voters participated (estimated to be in the 700 person range for the eastern half of the city, according to 2nd BCT officials).

The 2d BCT also built several new camps within the city. For security reasons, many are left unverified, however ones that can be confirmed include Camps Trotter and Corregidor built to ease the burden on the accommodations at Combat Outpost.

In July 2005, the brigade began to get relieved by units of the Army National Guard, as well as the 3d Infantry Division of the Regular Army. Six months into the deployment, the units of the 2d BCT were given word that they would not be returning to South Korea but, rather, to Fort Carson, Colorado in an effort to restructure the Army and house more soldiers on American soil.

From June 2006 to September 2007, the 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team deployed from Fort Lewis, Washington in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. During the 3rd Stryker Brigade&#x27;s second deployment to Operation Iraqi Freedom their mission was to assist the Iraqi security forces with counter-insurgency operations in the Ninewa Province. 46 soldiers from the brigade were killed during the deployment.

On 1 June 2006 at Fort Lewis, Washington the 4th Brigade, 2d Infantry Division was formed. From April 2007 to July 2008 the 4th Stryker Brigade Combat Team was deployed in as part of the surge to regain control of the situation in Iraq. The brigade assumed responsibility for the area north of Baghdad and the Diyala province. 35 soldiers from the brigade were killed during the deployment.

From October 2006 to January 2008, the 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team deployed from Fort Carson, Colorado in support of the Multi-National Division – Baghdad (1st Cavalry Division) and was responsible for assisting the Iraqi forces to become self-reliant, bringing down the violence and insurgency levels and supporting the rebuilding of the Iraqi infrastructure. 43 soldiers from the brigade were killed during the deployment.

SSG Christopher B. Waiters of 5th Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, 3d Brigade Combat Team was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross on 23 October 2008 for his actions on 5 April 2007 when he was a specialist. Shortly after, SPC Erik Oropeza of the 4th Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team Thus the division will be credited with the 17th and 18th Distinguished Service Cross awardings since 1975.

The 2nd Infantry Division&#x27;s 4th Brigade Combat Team deployed to Iraq in the fall of 2009.

3rd Brigade deployed to Iraq 4 August 2009 for the brigade&#x27;s third deployment to Iraq, the most of any Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT).

===War in Afghanistan===

On 17 February 2009, President Barack Obama ordered 4,000 soldiers from the 5th Stryker Brigade Combat Team to Afghanistan, along with 8,000 Marines. Soldiers are being sent there because of the worsening situation in the Afghan War. These soldiers were deployed in the southeast, on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. During deployment, 35 soldiers were killed in combat, two others were killed in accidents, and 239 were wounded. In July 2010, the 5th Stryker Brigade Combat Team was inactivated and reflagged as the 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team. The brigade&#x27;s Special Troops Battalion was also inactivated and reflagged and the rest of the subordinate units were reassigned to the reactivated 2nd SBCT.

3rd SBCT deployed in December 2011 and served in Afghanistan for one-year. 16 soldiers from the brigade died during the deployment. They were joined by their sister Stryker brigade, the 2nd SBCT, in the spring. 2nd Brigade returned around December 2012 and January 2013 having lost eight soldiers during deployment. The 4th Stryker BCT also deployed to its first deployment to the country in fall 2012 and returned in summer 2013 having lost four soldiers.

====Rogue &quot;kill team&quot; criminal charges====

During the summer of 2010, the U.S. military charged five members of the 3rd Platoon, Bravo Company, 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment with the formation of a &quot;kill team&quot;, which staged three separate murders of Afghan civilians in Kandahar province. In addition, seven soldiers were also charged with crimes including hashish use, impeding an investigation and attacking a whistleblowing soldier who alerted MPs during an initially unrelated investigation into hashish use by members of the 3rd Platoon. The alleged ringleader was Staff Sergeant Calvin Gibbs.
* On 15 January 2010, Gul Mudin was killed &quot;by means of throwing a fragmentary grenade at him and shooting him with a rifle,&quot; an action carried out by SPC Jeremy Morlock and PFC Andrew Holmes under the direction of Gibbs. Morlock allegedly told Holmes, age 19 and on his first tour of duty, that the killing was carried out for fun.
* On 22 February, Gibbs and SPC Michael S. Wagnon allegedly shot the second victim, Marach Agha, and placed a Kalashnikov next to the body to justify the killing.
* On 2 May, Mullah Adadhdad was killed after being shot and attacked with a grenade. SPC Adam C. Winfield and Gibbs were allegedly the perpetrators.

Christopher Winfield, the father of platoon member SPC Adam Winfield, attempted to alert the Army of the kill team&#x27;s existence after his son explained the situation from Afghanistan via a Facebook chat. In response to the news from his son, Winfield called the Army inspector general&#x27;s 24-hour hotline, the office of Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), and a sergeant at Joint Base Lewis-McChord who told him to call the Army Criminal Investigation Division. He then contacted the Fort Lewis command center and spoke to a sergeant on duty who agreed that SPC Winfield was in potential danger but that he had to report the crime to his superiors before the Army could take action.

== Organization ==
As of 2024, the 2nd Infantry Division no longer has any organic Brigade Combat Teams. Their previous two brigades, 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team &quot;Ghost Brigade&quot; and 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team &quot;Lancer Brigade&quot; were reflagged under 7th Infantry Division. Formerly, the 7th Infantry Division commanded these units while in garrison at Joint Base Lewis-McCord. But under the Army&#x27;s restructuring in 2024, the two brigades were formally transferred to 7ID. The 2nd Infantry Division retained the 2nd Combat Aviation Brigade, the 2nd Division Sustainment Brigade, 2nd Division Artillery, and the 210th Field Artillery Brigade as well as control over the Korean Rotational Force (KRF). The division also has an attached mechanized brigade from the Republic of Korea Army under the combined-division concept.

Since the inactivation of the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division on 2 July 2015, the Brigade Combat Team requirement in Korea has been filled by rotational forces from the United States on nine-month deployments. From 2015 to 2022, but in the summer of 2022 the Army announced the Korea Rotational Force would switch from the armor to Stryker brigades. Rotational units were primarily stationed in Camp Casey until 2017 when the forces were split between Camp Casey and Camp Humphreys.

<text>Interferometry is a technique which uses the &quot;interference&quot; of superimposed waves to extract information. Interferometry typically uses electromagnetic waves and is an important investigative technique in the fields of astronomy, fiber optics, engineering metrology, optical metrology, oceanography, seismology, spectroscopy (and its applications to chemistry), quantum mechanics, nuclear and particle physics, plasma physics, biomolecular interactions, surface profiling, microfluidics, mechanical stress/strain measurement, velocimetry, optometry, and making holograms.

Interferometers are devices that extract information from interference. They are widely used in science and industry for the measurement of microscopic displacements, refractive index changes and surface irregularities. In the case with most interferometers, light from a single source is split into two beams that travel in different optical paths, which are then combined again to produce interference; two incoherent sources can also be made to interfere under some circumstances. The resulting interference fringes give information about the difference in optical path lengths. In analytical science, interferometers are used to measure lengths and the shape of optical components with nanometer precision; they are the highest-precision length measuring instruments in existence. In Fourier transform spectroscopy they are used to analyze light containing features of absorption or emission associated with a substance or mixture. An astronomical interferometer consists of two or more separate telescopes that combine their signals, offering a resolution equivalent to that of a telescope of diameter equal to the largest separation between its individual elements.

==Basic principles==

Interferometry makes use of the principle of superposition to combine waves in a way that will cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves. This works because when two waves with the same frequency combine, the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are out of phase will undergo destructive interference. Waves which are not completely in phase nor completely out of phase will have an intermediate intensity pattern, which can be used to determine their relative phase difference. Most interferometers use light or some other form of electromagnetic wave.

Typically (see Fig. 1, the well-known Michelson configuration) a single incoming beam of coherent light will be split into two identical beams by a beam splitter (a partially reflecting mirror). Each of these beams travels a different route, called a path, and they are recombined before arriving at a detector. The path difference, the difference in the distance traveled by each beam, creates a phase difference between them. It is this introduced phase difference that creates the interference pattern between the initially identical waves. If a single beam has been split along two paths, then the phase difference is diagnostic of anything that changes the phase along the paths. This could be a physical change in the path length itself or a change in the refractive index along the path.

As seen in Fig. 2a and 2b, the observer has a direct view of mirror &quot;M&quot;1 seen through the beam splitter, and sees a reflected image &#x27;2 of mirror &quot;M&quot;2. The fringes can be interpreted as the result of interference between light coming from the two virtual images &#x27;1 and &#x27;2 of the original source &quot;S&quot;. The characteristics of the interference pattern depend on the nature of the light source and the precise orientation of the mirrors and beam splitter. In Fig. 2a, the optical elements are oriented so that &#x27;1 and &#x27;2 are in line with the observer, and the resulting interference pattern consists of circles centered on the normal to &quot;M&quot;1 and &quot;M&#x27;2&quot;. If, as in Fig. 2b, &quot;M&quot;1 and &#x27;2 are tilted with respect to each other, the interference fringes will generally take the shape of conic sections (hyperbolas), but if &#x27;1 and &#x27;2 overlap, the fringes near the axis will be straight, parallel, and equally spaced. If S is an extended source rather than a point source as illustrated, the fringes of Fig. 2a must be observed with a telescope set at infinity, while the fringes of Fig. 2b will be localized on the mirrors.

Use of white light will result in a pattern of colored fringes (see Fig. 3). The central fringe representing equal path length may be light or dark depending on the number of phase inversions experienced by the two beams as they traverse the optical system. (See Michelson interferometer for a discussion of this.)

==History==
The law of interference of light was described by Thomas Young in his 1803 Bakerian Lecture to the Royal Society of London. In preparation for the lecture, Young performed a double-aperture experiment that demonstrated interference fringes. His interpretation in terms of the interference of waves was rejected by most scientists at the time because of the dominance of Isaac Newton&#x27;s corpuscular theory of light proposed a century before.

The French engineer Augustin-Jean Fresnel, unaware of Young&#x27;s results, began working on a wave theory of light and interference and was introduced to François Arago. Between 1816 and 1818, Fresnel and Arago performed interference experiments at the Paris Observatory. During this time, Arago designed and built the first interferometer, using it to measure the refractive index of moist air relative to dry air, which posed a potential problem for astronomical observations of star positions. The success of Fresnel&#x27;s wave theory of light was established in his prize-winning memoire of 1819 that predicted and measured diffraction patterns. The Arago interferometer was later employed in 1850 by Leon Foucault to measure the speed of light in air relative to water, and it was used again in 1851 by Hippolyte Fizeau to measure the effect of Fresnel drag on the speed of light in moving water.

Jules Jamin developed the first single-beam interferometer (not requiring a splitting aperture as the Arago interferometer did) in 1856. In 1881, the American physicist Albert A. Michelson, while visiting Hermann von Helmholtz in Berlin, invented the interferometer that is named after him, the Michelson Interferometer, to search for effects of the motion of the Earth on the speed of light. Michelson&#x27;s null results performed in the basement of the Potsdam Observatory outside of Berlin (the horse traffic in the center of Berlin created too many vibrations), and his later more-accurate null results observed with Edward W. Morley at Case College in Cleveland, Ohio, contributed to the growing crisis of the luminiferous ether. Einstein stated that it was Fizeau&#x27;s measurement of the speed of light in moving water using the Arago interferometer that inspired his theory of the relativistic addition of velocities.

==Categories==
Interferometers and interferometric techniques may be categorized by a variety of criteria:

===Homodyne versus heterodyne detection ===
In homodyne detection, the interference occurs between two beams at the same wavelength (or carrier frequency). The phase difference between the two beams results in a change in the intensity of the light on the detector. The resulting intensity of the light after mixing of these two beams is measured, or the pattern of interference fringes is viewed or recorded. Most of the interferometers discussed in this article fall into this category.

The heterodyne technique is used for (1) shifting an input signal into a new frequency range as well as (2) amplifying a weak input signal (assuming use of an active mixer). A weak input signal of frequency f1 is mixed with a strong reference frequency f2 from a local oscillator (LO). The nonlinear combination of the input signals creates two new signals, one at the sum f1 + f2 of the two frequencies, and the other at the difference f1 − f2. These new frequencies are called heterodynes. Typically only one of the new frequencies is desired, and the other signal is filtered out of the output of the mixer. The output signal will have an intensity proportional to the product of the amplitudes of the input signals.

The most important and widely used application of the heterodyne technique is in the superheterodyne receiver (superhet), invented in 1917-18 by U.S. engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong and French engineer Lucien Lévy. In this circuit, the incoming radio frequency signal from the antenna is mixed with a signal from a local oscillator (LO) and converted by the heterodyne technique to a lower fixed frequency signal called the intermediate frequency (IF). This IF is amplified and filtered, before being applied to a detector which extracts the audio signal, which is sent to the loudspeaker.

Optical heterodyne detection is an extension of the heterodyne technique to higher (visible) frequencies. While optical heterodyne interferometry is usually done at a single point it is also possible to perform this widefield.

===Double path versus common path===

A double-path interferometer is one in which the reference beam and sample beam travel along divergent paths. Examples include the Michelson interferometer, the Twyman–Green interferometer, and the Mach–Zehnder interferometer. After being perturbed by interaction with the sample under test, the sample beam is recombined with the reference beam to create an interference pattern which can then be interpreted.

A &quot;common-path interferometer&quot; is a class of interferometer in which the reference beam and sample beam travel along the same path. Fig. 4 illustrates the Sagnac interferometer, the fibre optic gyroscope, the point diffraction interferometer, and the lateral shearing interferometer. Other examples of common path interferometer include the Zernike phase-contrast microscope, Fresnel&#x27;s biprism, the zero-area Sagnac, and the scatterplate interferometer.

===Wavefront splitting versus amplitude splitting===
====Wavefront splitting inferometers====
A wavefront splitting interferometer divides a light wavefront emerging from a point or a narrow slit (&quot;i.e.&quot; spatially coherent light) and, after allowing the two parts of the wavefront to travel through different paths, allows them to recombine. Fig. 5 illustrates Young&#x27;s interference experiment and Lloyd&#x27;s mirror. Other examples of wavefront splitting interferometer include the Fresnel biprism, the Billet Bi-Lens, diffraction-grating Michelson interferometer, and the Rayleigh interferometer.

In 1803, Young&#x27;s interference experiment played a major role in the general acceptance of the wave theory of light. If white light is used in Young&#x27;s experiment, the result is a white central band of constructive interference corresponding to equal path length from the two slits, surrounded by a symmetrical pattern of colored fringes of diminishing intensity. In addition to continuous electromagnetic radiation, Young&#x27;s experiment has been performed with individual photons, with electrons, and with buckyball molecules large enough to be seen under an electron microscope.

Lloyd&#x27;s mirror generates interference fringes by combining direct light from a source (blue lines) and light from the source&#x27;s reflected image (red lines) from a mirror held at grazing incidence. The result is an asymmetrical pattern of fringes. The band of equal path length, nearest the mirror, is dark rather than bright. In 1834, Humphrey Lloyd interpreted this effect as proof that the phase of a front-surface reflected beam is inverted.

====Amplitude-splitting inferometers====

An amplitude splitting interferometer uses a partial reflector to divide the amplitude of the incident wave into separate beams which are separated and recombined. 

The Fizeau interferometer is shown as it might be set up to test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top of the flat being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled (only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes. Separating the test and reference flats allows the two flats to be tilted with respect to each other. By adjusting the tilt, which adds a controlled phase gradient to the fringe pattern, one can control the spacing and direction of the fringes, so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes rather than a complex swirl of contour lines. Separating the plates, however, necessitates that the illuminating light be collimated. Fig 6 shows a collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminating the two flats and a beam splitter allowing the fringes to be viewed on-axis.

The Mach–Zehnder interferometer is a more versatile instrument than the Michelson interferometer. Each of the well separated light paths is traversed only once, and the fringes can be adjusted so that they are localized in any desired plane. Typically, the fringes would be adjusted to lie in the same plane as the test object, so that fringes and test object can be photographed together. If it is decided to produce fringes in white light, then, since white light has a limited coherence length, on the order of micrometers, great care must be taken to equalize the optical paths or no fringes will be visible. As illustrated in Fig. 6, a compensating cell would be placed in the path of the reference beam to match the test cell. Note also the precise orientation of the beam splitters. The reflecting surfaces of the beam splitters would be oriented so that the test and reference beams pass through an equal amount of glass. In this orientation, the test and reference beams each experience two front-surface reflections, resulting in the same number of phase inversions. The result is that light traveling an equal optical path length in the test and reference beams produces a white light fringe of constructive interference.

The heart of the Fabry–Pérot interferometer is a pair of partially silvered glass optical flats spaced several millimeters to centimeters apart with the silvered surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a Fabry–Pérot &quot;etalon&quot; uses a transparent plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.) As with the Fizeau interferometer, the flats are slightly beveled. In a typical system, illumination is provided by a diffuse source set at the focal plane of a collimating lens. A focusing lens produces what would be an inverted image of the source if the paired flats were not present, i.e., in the absence of the paired flats, all light emitted from point A passing through the optical system would be focused at point A&#x27;. In Fig. 6, only one ray emitted from point A on the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point A&#x27; on the screen. The complete interference pattern takes the appearance of a set of concentric rings. The sharpness of the rings depends on the reflectivity of the flats. If the reflectivity is high, resulting in a high Q factor (i.e., high finesse), monochromatic light produces a set of narrow bright rings against a dark background. In Fig. 6, the low-finesse image corresponds to a reflectivity of 0.04 (i.e., unsilvered surfaces) &quot;versus&quot; a reflectivity of 0.95 for the high-finesse image.

Fig. 6 illustrates the Fizeau, Mach–Zehnder, and Fabry–Pérot interferometers. Other examples of amplitude splitting interferometer include the Michelson, Twyman–Green, Laser Unequal Path, and Linnik interferometer.

====Michelson-Morley====
Michelson and Morley (1887) and other early experimentalists using interferometric techniques in an attempt to measure the properties of the luminiferous aether, used monochromatic light only for initially setting up their equipment, always switching to white light for the actual measurements. The reason is that measurements were recorded visually. Monochromatic light would result in a uniform fringe pattern. Lacking modern means of environmental temperature control, experimentalists struggled with continual fringe drift even though the interferometer might be set up in a basement. Since the fringes would occasionally disappear due to vibrations by passing horse traffic, distant thunderstorms and the like, it would be easy for an observer to &quot;get lost&quot; when the fringes returned to visibility. The advantages of white light, which produced a distinctive colored fringe pattern, far outweighed the difficulties of aligning the apparatus due to its low coherence length. This was an early example of the use of white light to resolve the &quot;2 pi ambiguity&quot;.

==Applications==

===Physics and astronomy===

In physics, one of the most important experiments of the late 19th century was the famous &quot;failed experiment&quot; of Michelson and Morley which provided evidence for special relativity. Recent repetitions of the Michelson–Morley experiment perform heterodyne measurements of beat frequencies of crossed cryogenic optical resonators. Fig 7 illustrates a resonator experiment performed by Müller et al. in 2003. Two optical resonators constructed from crystalline sapphire, controlling the frequencies of two lasers, were set at right angles within a helium cryostat. A frequency comparator measured the beat frequency of the combined outputs of the two resonators. , the precision by which anisotropy of the speed of light can be excluded in resonator experiments is at the 10−17 level.

Michelson interferometers are used in tunable narrow band optical filters and as the core hardware component of Fourier transform spectrometers.

When used as a tunable narrow band filter, Michelson interferometers exhibit a number of advantages and disadvantages when compared with competing technologies such as Fabry–Pérot interferometers or Lyot filters. Michelson interferometers have the largest field of view for a specified wavelength, and are relatively simple in operation, since tuning is via mechanical rotation of waveplates rather than via high voltage control of piezoelectric crystals or lithium niobate optical modulators as used in a Fabry–Pérot system. Compared with Lyot filters, which use birefringent elements, Michelson interferometers have a relatively low temperature sensitivity. On the negative side, Michelson interferometers have a relatively restricted wavelength range and require use of prefilters which restrict transmittance.

Fig. 8 illustrates the operation of a Fourier transform spectrometer, which is essentially a Michelson interferometer with one mirror movable. (A practical Fourier transform spectrometer would substitute corner cube reflectors for the flat mirrors of the conventional Michelson interferometer, but for simplicity, the illustration does not show this.) An interferogram is generated by making measurements of the signal at many discrete positions of the moving mirror. A Fourier transform converts the interferogram into an actual spectrum.

Fig. 9 shows a doppler image of the solar corona made using a tunable Fabry-Pérot interferometer to recover scans of the solar corona at a number of wavelengths near the FeXIV green line. The picture is a color-coded image of the doppler shift of the line, which may be associated with the coronal plasma velocity towards or away from the satellite camera.

Fabry–Pérot thin-film etalons are used in narrow bandpass filters capable of selecting a single spectral line for imaging; for example, the H-alpha line or the Ca-K line of the Sun or stars. Fig. 10 shows an Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) image of the Sun at 195 Ångströms (19.5 nm), corresponding to a spectral line of multiply-ionized iron atoms. EIT used multilayer coated reflective mirrors that were coated with alternate layers of a light &quot;spacer&quot; element (such as silicon), and a heavy &quot;scatterer&quot; element (such as molybdenum). Approximately 100 layers of each type were placed on each mirror, with a thickness of around 10 nm each. The layer thicknesses were tightly controlled so that at the desired wavelength, reflected photons from each layer interfered constructively.

The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) uses two 4-km Michelson–Fabry–Pérot interferometers for the detection of gravitational waves. In this application, the Fabry–Pérot cavity is used to store photons for almost a millisecond while they bounce up and down between the mirrors. This increases the time a gravitational wave can interact with the light, which results in a better sensitivity at low frequencies. Smaller cavities, usually called mode cleaners, are used for spatial filtering and frequency stabilization of the main laser. The first observation of gravitational waves occurred on September 14, 2015.

The Mach–Zehnder interferometer&#x27;s relatively large and freely accessible working space, and its flexibility in locating the fringes has made it the interferometer of choice for visualizing flow in wind tunnels, and for flow visualization studies in general. It is frequently used in the fields of aerodynamics, plasma physics and heat transfer to measure pressure, density, and temperature changes in gases.

Mach–Zehnder interferometers are also used to study one of the most counterintuitive predictions of quantum mechanics, the phenomenon known as quantum entanglement.

An astronomical interferometer achieves high-resolution observations using the technique of aperture synthesis, mixing signals from a cluster of comparatively small telescopes rather than a single very expensive monolithic telescope.

Early radio telescope interferometers used a single baseline for measurement. Later astronomical interferometers, such as the Very Large Array illustrated in Fig 11, used arrays of telescopes arranged in a pattern on the ground. A limited number of baselines will result in insufficient coverage. This was alleviated by using the rotation of the Earth to rotate the array relative to the sky. Thus, a single baseline could measure information in multiple orientations by taking repeated measurements, a technique called &quot;Earth-rotation synthesis&quot;. Baselines thousands of kilometers long were achieved using very long baseline interferometry.

Astronomical optical interferometry has had to overcome a number of technical issues not shared by radio telescope interferometry. The short wavelengths of light necessitate extreme precision and stability of construction. For example, spatial resolution of 1 milliarcsecond requires 0.5 μm stability in a 100 m baseline. Optical interferometric measurements require high sensitivity, low noise detectors that did not become available until the late 1990s. Astronomical &quot;seeing&quot;, the turbulence that causes stars to twinkle, introduces rapid, random phase changes in the incoming light, requiring data collection rates to be faster than the rate of turbulence. Despite these technical difficulties, three major facilities are now in operation offering resolutions down to the fractional milliarcsecond range. shows a movie assembled from aperture synthesis images of the Beta Lyrae system, a binary star system approximately 960 light-years (290 parsecs) away in the constellation Lyra, as observed by the CHARA array with the MIRC instrument. The brighter component is the primary star, or the mass donor. The fainter component is the thick disk surrounding the secondary star, or the mass gainer. The two components are separated by 1 milli-arcsecond. Tidal distortions of the mass donor and the mass gainer are both clearly visible.

The wave character of matter can be exploited to build interferometers. The first examples of matter interferometers were electron interferometers, later followed by neutron interferometers. Around 1990 the first atom interferometers were demonstrated, later followed by interferometers employing molecules.

Electron holography is an imaging technique that photographically records the electron interference pattern of an object, which is then reconstructed to yield a greatly magnified image of the original object. This technique was developed to enable greater resolution in electron microscopy than is possible using conventional imaging techniques. The resolution of conventional electron microscopy is not limited by electron wavelength, but by the large aberrations of electron lenses.

Neutron interferometry has been used to investigate the Aharonov–Bohm effect, to examine the effects of gravity acting on an elementary particle, and to demonstrate a strange behavior of fermions that is at the basis of the Pauli exclusion principle: Unlike macroscopic objects, when fermions are rotated by 360° about any axis, they do not return to their original state, but develop a minus sign in their wave function. In other words, a fermion needs to be rotated 720° before returning to its original state.

Atom interferometry techniques are reaching sufficient precision to allow laboratory-scale tests of general relativity.

Interferometers are used in atmospheric physics for high-precision measurements of trace gases via remote sounding of the atmosphere. There are several examples of interferometers that utilize either absorption or emission features of trace gases. A typical use would be in continual monitoring of the column concentration of trace gases such as ozone and carbon monoxide above the instrument.

===Engineering and applied science===

Newton (test plate) interferometry is frequently used in the optical industry for testing the quality of surfaces as they are being shaped and figured. Fig. 13 shows photos of reference flats being used to check two test flats at different stages of completion, showing the different patterns of interference fringes. The reference flats are resting with their bottom surfaces in contact with the test flats, and they are illuminated by a monochromatic light source. The light waves reflected from both surfaces interfere, resulting in a pattern of bright and dark bands. The surface in the left photo is nearly flat, indicated by a pattern of straight parallel interference fringes at equal intervals. The surface in the right photo is uneven, resulting in a pattern of curved fringes. Each pair of adjacent fringes represents a difference in surface elevation of half a wavelength of the light used, so differences in elevation can be measured by counting the fringes. The flatness of the surfaces can be measured to millionths of an inch by this method. To determine whether the surface being tested is concave or convex with respect to the reference optical flat, any of several procedures may be adopted. One can observe how the fringes are displaced when one presses gently on the top flat. If one observes the fringes in white light, the sequence of colors becomes familiar with experience and aids in interpretation. Finally one may compare the appearance of the fringes as one moves ones head from a normal to an oblique viewing position. These sorts of maneuvers, while common in the optical shop, are not suitable in a formal testing environment. When the flats are ready for sale, they will typically be mounted in a Fizeau interferometer for formal testing and certification.

Fabry-Pérot etalons are widely used in telecommunications, lasers and spectroscopy to control and measure the wavelengths of light. Dichroic filters are multiple layer thin-film etalons. In telecommunications, wavelength-division multiplexing, the technology that enables the use of multiple wavelengths of light through a single optical fiber, depends on filtering devices that are thin-film etalons. Single-mode lasers employ etalons to suppress all optical cavity modes except the single one of interest.

The Twyman–Green interferometer, invented by Twyman and Green in 1916, is a variant of the Michelson interferometer widely used to test optical components. The basic characteristics distinguishing it from the Michelson configuration are the use of a monochromatic point light source and a collimator. Michelson (1918) criticized the Twyman–Green configuration as being unsuitable for the testing of large optical components, since the light sources available at the time had limited coherence length. Michelson pointed out that constraints on geometry forced by limited coherence length required the use of a reference mirror of equal size to the test mirror, making the Twyman–Green impractical for many purposes. Decades later, the advent of laser light sources answered Michelson&#x27;s objections. (A Twyman–Green interferometer using a laser light source and unequal path length is known as a Laser Unequal Path Interferometer, or LUPI.) Fig. 14 illustrates a Twyman–Green interferometer set up to test a lens. Light from a monochromatic point source is expanded by a diverging lens (not shown), then is collimated into a parallel beam. A convex spherical mirror is positioned so that its center of curvature coincides with the focus of the lens being tested. The emergent beam is recorded by an imaging system for analysis.

Mach–Zehnder interferometers are being used in integrated optical circuits, in which light interferes between two branches of a waveguide that are externally modulated to vary their relative phase. A slight tilt of one of the beam splitters will result in a path difference and a change in the interference pattern. Mach–Zehnder interferometers are the basis of a wide variety of devices, from RF modulators to sensors to optical switches.

The latest proposed extremely large astronomical telescopes, such as the Thirty Meter Telescope and the Extremely Large Telescope, will be of segmented design. Their primary mirrors will be built from hundreds of hexagonal mirror segments. Polishing and figuring these highly aspheric and non-rotationally symmetric mirror segments presents a major challenge. Traditional means of optical testing compares a surface against a spherical reference with the aid of a null corrector. In recent years, computer-generated holograms (CGHs) have begun to supplement null correctors in test setups for complex aspheric surfaces. Fig. 15 illustrates how this is done. Unlike the figure, actual CGHs have line spacing on the order of 1 to 10 μm. When laser light is passed through the CGH, the zero-order diffracted beam experiences no wavefront modification. The wavefront of the first-order diffracted beam, however, is modified to match the desired shape of the test surface. In the illustrated Fizeau interferometer test setup, the zero-order diffracted beam is directed towards the spherical reference surface, and the first-order diffracted beam is directed towards the test surface in such a way that the two reflected beams combine to form interference fringes. The same test setup can be used for the innermost mirrors as for the outermost, with only the CGH needing to be exchanged.

Ring laser gyroscopes (RLGs) and fibre optic gyroscopes (FOGs) are interferometers used in navigation systems. They operate on the principle of the Sagnac effect. The distinction between RLGs and FOGs is that in a RLG, the entire ring is part of the laser while in a FOG, an external laser injects counter-propagating beams into an optical fiber ring, and rotation of the system then causes a relative phase shift between those beams. In a RLG, the observed phase shift is proportional to the accumulated rotation, while in a FOG, the observed phase shift is proportional to the angular velocity.

In telecommunication networks, heterodyning is used to move frequencies of individual signals to different channels which may share a single physical transmission line. This is called frequency division multiplexing (FDM). For example, a coaxial cable used by a cable television system can carry 500 television channels at the same time because each one is given a different frequency, so they don&#x27;t interfere with one another. Continuous wave (CW) doppler radar detectors are basically heterodyne detection devices that compare transmitted and reflected beams.

Optical heterodyne detection is used for coherent Doppler lidar measurements capable of detecting very weak light scattered in the atmosphere and monitoring wind speeds with high accuracy. It has application in optical fiber communications, in various high resolution spectroscopic techniques, and the self-heterodyne method can be used to measure the linewidth of a laser.

Optical heterodyne detection is an essential technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the frequencies of optical sources, as well as in the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect the microwave frequency of a cesium or other atomic time source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by heterodyne detection with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical frequency combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the pulse repetition frequency (Fig. 16). The pulse repetition frequency is locked to that of the frequency standard, and the frequencies of the comb elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the frequencies of the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb and the frequency of the resultant heterodyne beats is measured.

One of the most common industrial applications of optical interferometry is as a versatile measurement tool for the high precision examination of surface topography. Popular interferometric measurement techniques include Phase Shifting Interferometry (PSI), and Vertical Scanning Interferometry(VSI), also known as scanning white light interferometry (SWLI) or by the ISO term coherence scanning interferometry (CSI), CSI exploits coherence to extend the range of capabilities for interference microscopy. These techniques are widely used in micro-electronic and micro-optic fabrication. PSI uses monochromatic light and provides very precise measurements; however it is only usable for surfaces that are very smooth. CSI often uses white light and high numerical apertures, and rather than looking at the phase of the fringes, as does PSI, looks for best position of maximum fringe contrast or some other feature of the overall fringe pattern. In its simplest form, CSI provides less precise measurements than PSI but can be used on rough surfaces. Some configurations of CSI, variously known as Enhanced VSI (EVSI), high-resolution SWLI or Frequency Domain Analysis (FDA), use coherence effects in combination with interference phase to enhance precision.

Phase Shifting Interferometry addresses several issues associated with the classical analysis of static interferograms. Classically, one measures the positions of the fringe centers. As seen in Fig. 13, fringe deviations from straightness and equal spacing provide a measure of the aberration. Errors in determining the location of the fringe centers provide the inherent limit to precision of the classical analysis, and any intensity variations across the interferogram will also introduce error. There is a trade-off between precision and number of data points: closely spaced fringes provide many data points of low precision, while widely spaced fringes provide a low number of high precision data points. Since fringe center data is all that one uses in the classical analysis, all of the other information that might theoretically be obtained by detailed analysis of the intensity variations in an interferogram is thrown away. Finally, with static interferograms, additional information is needed to determine the polarity of the wavefront: In Fig. 13, one can see that the tested surface on the right deviates from flatness, but one cannot tell from this single image whether this deviation from flatness is concave or convex. Traditionally, this information would be obtained using non-automated means, such as by observing the direction that the fringes move when the reference surface is pushed.

Phase shifting interferometry overcomes these limitations by not relying on finding fringe centers, but rather by collecting intensity data from every point of the CCD image sensor. As seen in Fig. 17, multiple interferograms (at least three) are analyzed with the reference optical surface shifted by a precise fraction of a wavelength between each exposure using a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). Alternatively, precise phase shifts can be introduced by modulating the laser frequency. The captured images are processed by a computer to calculate the optical wavefront errors. The precision and reproducibility of PSI is far greater than possible in static interferogram analysis, with measurement repeatabilities of a hundredth of a wavelength being routine. Phase shifting technology has been adapted to a variety of interferometer types such as Twyman–Green, Mach–Zehnder, laser Fizeau, and even common path configurations such as point diffraction and lateral shearing interferometers. More generally, phase shifting techniques can be adapted to almost any system that uses fringes for measurement, such as holographic and speckle interferometry.


In coherence scanning interferometry, interference is only achieved when the path length delays of the interferometer are matched within the coherence time of the light source. CSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the phase of the fringes. Fig. 17 illustrates a CSI microscope using a Mirau interferometer in the objective; other forms of interferometer used with white light include the Michelson interferometer (for low magnification objectives, where the reference mirror in a Mirau objective would interrupt too much of the aperture) and the Linnik interferometer (for high magnification objectives with limited working distance). The sample (or alternatively, the objective) is moved vertically over the full height range of the sample, and the position of maximum fringe contrast is found for each pixel. The chief benefit of coherence scanning interferometry is that systems can be designed that do not suffer from the 2 pi ambiguity of coherent interferometry, and as seen in Fig. 18, which scans a 180μm x 140μm x 10μm volume, it is well suited to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution of the system is determined in part by the coherence length of the light source. Industrial applications include in-process surface metrology, roughness measurement, 3D surface metrology in hard-to-reach spaces and in hostile environments, profilometry of surfaces with high aspect ratio features (grooves, channels, holes), and film thickness measurement (semi-conductor and optical industries, etc.).

Fig. 19 illustrates a Twyman–Green interferometer set up for white light scanning of a macroscopic object.

Holographic interferometry is a technique which uses holography to monitor small deformations in single wavelength implementations. In multi-wavelength implementations, it is used to perform dimensional metrology of large parts and assemblies and to detect larger surface defects.

Holographic interferometry was discovered by accident as a result of mistakes committed during the making of holograms. Early lasers were relatively weak and photographic plates were insensitive, necessitating long exposures during which vibrations or minute shifts might occur in the optical system. The resultant holograms, which showed the holographic subject covered with fringes, were considered ruined.

Eventually, several independent groups of experimenters in the mid-60s realized that the fringes encoded important information about dimensional changes occurring in the subject, and began intentionally producing holographic double exposures. The main Holographic interferometry article covers the disputes over priority of discovery that occurred during the issuance of the patent for this method.

Double- and multi- exposure holography is one of three methods used to create holographic interferograms. A first exposure records the object in an unstressed state. Subsequent exposures on the same photographic plate are made while the object is subjected to some stress. The composite image depicts the difference between the stressed and unstressed states.

Real-time holography is a second method of creating holographic interferograms. A holograph of the unstressed object is created. This holograph is illuminated with a reference beam to generate a hologram image of the object directly superimposed over the original object itself while the object is being subjected to some stress. The object waves from this hologram image will interfere with new waves coming from the object. This technique allows real time monitoring of shape changes.

The third method, time-average holography, involves creating a holograph while the object is subjected to a periodic stress or vibration. This yields a visual image of the vibration pattern.

Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is a radar technique used in geodesy and remote sensing. Satellite synthetic aperture radar images of a geographic feature are taken on separate days, and changes that have taken place between radar images taken on the separate days are recorded as fringes similar to those obtained in holographic interferometry. The technique can monitor centimeter- to millimeter-scale deformation resulting from earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and also has uses in structural engineering, in particular for the monitoring of subsidence and structural stability. Fig 20 shows Kilauea, an active volcano in Hawaii. Data acquired using the space shuttle Endeavour&#x27;s X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar on April 13, 1994 and October 4, 1994 were used to generate interferometric fringes, which were overlaid on the X-SAR image of Kilauea.

Electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI), also known as TV holography, uses video detection and recording to produce an image of the object upon which is superimposed a fringe pattern which represents the displacement of the object between recordings. (see Fig. 21) The fringes are similar to those obtained in holographic interferometry.

When lasers were first invented, laser speckle was considered to be a severe drawback in using lasers to illuminate objects, particularly in holographic imaging because of the grainy image produced. It was later realized that speckle patterns could carry information about the object&#x27;s surface deformations. Butters and Leendertz developed the technique of speckle pattern interferometry in 1970, and since then, speckle has been exploited in a variety of other applications. A photograph is made of the speckle pattern before deformation, and a second photograph is made of the speckle pattern after deformation. Digital subtraction of the two images results in a correlation fringe pattern, where the fringes represent lines of equal deformation. Short laser pulses in the nanosecond range can be used to capture very fast transient events. A phase problem exists: In the absence of other information, one cannot tell the difference between contour lines indicating a peak &quot;versus&quot; contour lines indicating a trough. To resolve the issue of phase ambiguity, ESPI may be combined with phase shifting methods.

A method of establishing precise geodetic baselines, invented by Yrjö Väisälä, exploited the low coherence length of white light. Initially, white light was split in two, with the reference beam &quot;folded&quot;, bouncing back-and-forth six times between a mirror pair spaced precisely 1 m apart. Only if the test path was precisely 6 times the reference path would fringes be seen. Repeated applications of this procedure allowed precise measurement of distances up to 864 meters. Baselines thus established were used to calibrate geodetic distance measurement equipment, leading to a metrologically traceable scale for geodetic networks measured by these instruments. (This method has been superseded by GPS.)

Other uses of interferometers have been to study dispersion of materials, measurement of complex indices of refraction, and thermal properties. They are also used for three-dimensional motion mapping including mapping vibrational patterns of structures.

===Biology and medicine===
Optical interferometry, applied to biology and medicine, provides sensitive metrology capabilities for the measurement of biomolecules, subcellular components, cells and tissues. Many forms of label-free biosensors rely on interferometry because the direct interaction of electromagnetic fields with local molecular polarizability eliminates the need for fluorescent tags or nanoparticle markers. At a larger scale, cellular interferometry shares aspects with phase-contrast microscopy, but comprises a much larger class of phase-sensitive optical configurations that rely on optical interference among cellular constituents through refraction and diffraction. At the tissue scale, partially-coherent forward-scattered light propagation through the micro aberrations and heterogeneity of tissue structure provides opportunities to use phase-sensitive gating (optical coherence tomography) as well as phase-sensitive fluctuation spectroscopy to image subtle structural and dynamical properties.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a medical imaging technique using low-coherence interferometry to provide tomographic visualization of internal tissue microstructures. As seen in Fig. 22, the core of a typical OCT system is a Michelson interferometer. One interferometer arm is focused onto the tissue sample and scans the sample in an X-Y longitudinal raster pattern. The other interferometer arm is bounced off a reference mirror. Reflected light from the tissue sample is combined with reflected light from the reference. Because of the low coherence of the light source, interferometric signal is observed only over a limited depth of sample. X-Y scanning therefore records one thin optical slice of the sample at a time. By performing multiple scans, moving the reference mirror between each scan, an entire three-dimensional image of the tissue can be reconstructed. Recent advances have striven to combine the nanometer phase retrieval of coherent interferometry with the ranging capability of low-coherence interferometry.

Phase contrast and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy are important tools in biology and medicine. Most animal cells and single-celled organisms have very little color, and their intracellular organelles are almost totally invisible under simple bright field illumination. These structures can be made visible by staining the specimens, but staining procedures are time-consuming and kill the cells. As seen in Figs. 24 and 25, phase contrast and DIC microscopes allow unstained, living cells to be studied. DIC also has non-biological applications, for example in the analysis of planar silicon semiconductor processing.

Angle-resolved low-coherence interferometry (a/LCI) uses scattered light to measure the sizes of subcellular objects, including cell nuclei. This allows interferometry depth measurements to be combined with density measurements. Various correlations have been found between the state of tissue health and the measurements of subcellular objects. For example, it has been found that as tissue changes from normal to cancerous, the average cell nuclei size increases.

Phase-contrast X-ray imaging (Fig. 26) refers to a variety of techniques that use phase information of a coherent x-ray beam to image soft tissues. (For an elementary discussion, see Phase-contrast x-ray imaging (introduction). For a more in-depth review, see Phase-contrast X-ray imaging.) It has become an important method for visualizing cellular and histological structures in a wide range of biological and medical studies. There are several technologies being used for x-ray phase-contrast imaging, all utilizing different principles to convert phase variations in the x-rays emerging from an object into intensity variations. These include propagation-based phase contrast, Talbot interferometry, Moiré-based far-field interferometry, refraction-enhanced imaging, and x-ray interferometry. These methods provide higher contrast compared to normal absorption-contrast x-ray imaging, making it possible to see smaller details. A disadvantage is that these methods require more sophisticated equipment, such as synchrotron or microfocus x-ray sources, x-ray optics, or high resolution x-ray detectors.

<text>Greek numerals, also known as Ionic, Ionian, Milesian, or Alexandrian numerals, is a system of writing numbers using the letters of the Greek alphabet. In modern Greece, they are still used for ordinal numbers and in contexts similar to those in which Roman numerals are still used in the Western world. For ordinary cardinal numbers, however, modern Greece uses Arabic numerals.

==History==
The Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations&#x27; Linear A and Linear B alphabets used a different system, called Aegean numerals, which included number-only symbols for powers of ten:  = 1,  = 10,  = 100,  = 1000, and  = 10000.

Attic numerals composed another system that came into use perhaps in the 7th century BC. They were acrophonic, derived (after the initial one) from the first letters of the names of the numbers represented. They ran  = 1,  = 5,  = 10,  = 100,  = 1,000, and  = 10,000. The numbers 50, 500, 5,000, and 50,000 were represented by the letter with minuscule powers of ten written in the top-right corner: , , , and . One-half was represented by (left half of a full circle) and one-quarter by ɔ (right side of a full circle). The same system was used outside of Attica, but the symbols varied with the local alphabets; for example, 1,000 was in Boeotia.

The present system probably developed around Miletus in Ionia. 19th century classicists placed its development in the 3rd century BC, the occasion of its first widespread use. More thorough modern archaeology has caused the date to be pushed back at least to the 5th century BC, a little before Athens abandoned its pre-Eucleidean alphabet in favour of Miletus&#x27;s in 402 BC, and it may predate that by a century or two. The present system uses the 24 letters adopted under Eucleides, as well as three Phoenician and Ionic ones that had not been dropped from the Athenian alphabet (although kept for numbers): digamma, koppa, and sampi. The position of those characters within the numbering system imply that the first two were still in use (or at least remembered as letters) while the third was not. The exact dating, particularly for sampi, is problematic since its uncommon value means the first attested representative near Miletus does not appear until the 2nd century BC, and its use is unattested in Athens until the 2nd century CE. (In general, Athenians resisted using the new numerals for the longest of any Greek state, but had fully adopted them by .)

==Description==
Greek numerals are decimal, based on powers of 10. The units from 1 to 9 are assigned to the first nine letters of the old Ionic alphabet from alpha to theta. Instead of reusing these numbers to form multiples of the higher powers of ten, however, each multiple of ten from 10 to 90 was assigned its own separate letter from the next nine letters of the Ionic alphabet from iota to koppa. Each multiple of one hundred from 100 to 900 was then assigned its own separate letter as well, from rho to sampi. (That this was not the traditional location of sampi in the Ionic alphabetical order has led classicists to conclude that sampi had fallen into disuse as a letter by the time the system was created.)

This alphabetic system operates on the additive principle in which the numeric values of the letters are added together to obtain the total. For example, 241 was represented as  (200 + 40 + 1). (It was not always the case that the numbers ran from highest to lowest: a 4th-century BC inscription at Athens placed the units to the left of the tens. This practice continued in Asia Minor well into the Roman period.) In ancient and medieval manuscripts, these numerals were eventually distinguished from letters using overbars: , , , etc. In medieval manuscripts of the Book of Revelation, the number of the Beast 666 is written as  (600 + 60 + 6). (Numbers larger than 1,000 reused the same letters but included various marks to note the change.) Fractions were indicated as the denominator followed by a &quot;keraia&quot; (ʹ); γʹ indicated one third, δʹ one fourth and so on. As an exception, special symbol ∠ʹ indicated one half, and γ°ʹ or γoʹ was two-thirds. These fractions were additive (also known as Egyptian fractions); for example indicated .
Although the Greek alphabet began with only majuscule forms, surviving papyrus manuscripts from Egypt show that uncial and cursive minuscule forms began early. These new letter forms sometimes replaced the former ones, especially in the case of the obscure numerals. The old Q-shaped koppa (Ϙ) began to be broken up ( and ) and simplified ( and ). The numeral for 6 changed several times. During antiquity, the original letter form of digamma (Ϝ) came to be avoided in favour of a special numerical one (). By the Byzantine era, the letter was known as episemon and written as or . This eventually merged with the sigma-tau ligature stigma ϛ ( or ).

In modern Greek, a number of other changes have been made. Instead of extending an over bar over an entire number, the keraia (,  &quot;hornlike projection&quot;) is marked to its upper right, a development of the short marks formerly used for single numbers and fractions. The modern &quot;keraia&quot; () is a symbol similar to the acute accent (´), the tonos (U+0384,΄) and the prime symbol (U+02B9, ʹ), but has its own Unicode character as U+0374. Alexander the Great&#x27;s father Philip II of Macedon is thus known as in modern Greek. A lower left &quot;keraia&quot; (Unicode: U+0375, &quot;Greek Lower Numeral Sign&quot;) is now standard for distinguishing thousands: 2019 is represented as ͵ΒΙΘʹ ().

The declining use of ligatures in the 20th century also means that stigma is frequently written as the separate letters ΣΤʹ, although a single &quot;keraia&quot; is used for the group.

==Isopsephy==

The practice of adding up the number values of Greek letters of words, names and phrases, thus connecting the meaning of words, names and phrases with others with equivalent numeric sums, is called &quot;isopsephy&quot;. Similar practices for the Hebrew and English are called &quot;gematria&quot; and English Qaballa, respectively.

==Table==
* Alternatively, sub-sections of manuscripts are sometimes numbered by lowercase characters (αʹ. βʹ. γʹ. δʹ. εʹ. ϛʹ. ζʹ. ηʹ. θʹ.).
* In Ancient Greek, myriad notation is used for multiples of 10,000, for example for 20,000 or (also written on the line as Μ ) for 1,234,567.

==Higher numbers==
In his text &quot;The Sand Reckoner&quot;, the natural philosopher Archimedes gives an upper bound of the number of grains of sand required to fill the entire universe, using a contemporary estimation of its size. This would defy the then-held notion that it is impossible to name a number greater than that of the sand on a beach or on the entire world. In order to do that, he had to devise a new numeral scheme with much greater range.

Pappus of Alexandria reports that Apollonius of Perga developed a simpler system based on powers of the myriad; was 10,000, was 10,0002 = 100,000,000, was 10,0003 = 1012 and so on.

==Zero==
Hellenistic astronomers extended alphabetic Greek numerals into a sexagesimal positional numbering system by limiting each position to a maximum value of 50 + 9 and including a special symbol for zero, which was only used alone for a whole table cell, rather than combined with other digits, like today&#x27;s modern zero, which is a placeholder in positional numeric notation. This system was probably adapted from Babylonian numerals by Hipparchus . It was then used by Ptolemy (), Theon () and Theon&#x27;s daughter Hypatia (). The symbol for zero is clearly different from that of the value for 70, omicron or &quot;ο&quot;. In the 2nd-century papyrus shown here, one can see the symbol for zero in the lower right, and a number of larger omicrons elsewhere in the same papyrus.

In Ptolemy&#x27;s table of chords, the first fairly extensive trigonometric table, there were 360 rows, portions of which looked as follows:

: formula_1
Each number in the first column, labeled [&quot;regions&quot;] is the number of degrees of arc on a circle. Each number in the second column, labeled [&quot;straight lines&quot; or &quot;segments&quot;] is the length of the corresponding chord of the circle, when the diameter is 120. Thus represents an 84° arc, and the ∠′ after it means one-half, so that πδ∠′ means °. In the next column we see  , meaning . That is the length of the chord corresponding to an arc of ° when the diameter of the circle is 120. The next column, labeled for &quot;sixtieths&quot;, is the number to be added to the chord length for each 1&#x27; increase in the arc, over the span of the next 1°. Thus that last column was used for linear interpolation.

The Greek sexagesimal placeholder or zero symbol changed over time: The symbol used on papyri during the second century was a very small circle with an overbar several diameters long, terminated or not at both ends in various ways. Later, the overbar shortened to only one diameter, similar to the modern &quot;o&quot;-macron (ō) which was still being used in late medieval Arabic manuscripts whenever alphabetic numerals were used, later the overbar was omitted in Byzantine manuscripts, leaving a bare &quot;ο&quot; (omicron). This gradual change from an invented symbol to &quot;ο&quot; does not support the hypothesis that the latter was the initial of meaning &quot;nothing&quot;. Note that the letter &quot;ο&quot; was still used with its original numerical value of 70; however, there was no ambiguity, as 70 could not appear in the fractional part of a sexagesimal number, and zero was usually omitted when it was the integer.

Some of Ptolemy&#x27;s true zeros appeared in the first line of each of his eclipse tables, where they were a measure of the angular separation between the center of the Moon and either the center of the Sun (for solar eclipses) or the center of Earth&#x27;s shadow (for lunar eclipses). All of these zeros took the form , where Ptolemy actually used three of the symbols described in the previous paragraph. The vertical bar (|) indicates that the integral part on the left was in a separate column labeled in the headings of his tables as &quot;digits&quot; (of five arc-minutes each), whereas the fractional part was in the next column labeled &quot;minute of immersion&quot;, meaning sixtieths (and thirty-six-hundredths) of a digit.

The Greek zero was added to Unicode at .

<doc id="166702" wikidata="Q380433" url="?curid=166702" title="Al Sharpton">
<text>Alfred Charles Sharpton Jr. (born October 3, 1954) is an American civil rights and social justice activist, Baptist minister, radio talk show host, and TV personality, who is also the founder of the National Action Network civil rights organization. In 2004, he was a candidate for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. presidential election. He hosts a weekday radio talk show, &quot;Keepin&#x27; It Real&quot;, which is nationally syndicated by Urban One, and he is a political analyst and weekend host for MSNBC, hosting &quot;PoliticsNation&quot;.

Sharpton is known for making various controversial and incendiary comments over his career. He has been accused of making antisemitic and racially insensitive remarks as well as inciting incidents of violence. In 1987 he was highly active in publicizing the Tawana Brawley rape allegations in the media; the allegation was later proved to be false.

==Early life==
Alfred Charles Sharpton Jr. was born in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City, to Ada (née Richards) and Alfred Charles Sharpton Sr. Sharpton has Cherokee roots. He preached his first sermon at the age of four and toured with gospel singer Mahalia Jackson.

In 1963, Sharpton&#x27;s father left his wife to have a relationship with Sharpton&#x27;s half-sister. Ada took a job as a maid, but her income was so low that the family qualified for welfare and had to move from middle class Hollis, Queens, to the public housing projects in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn.

Sharpton graduated from Samuel J. Tilden High School in Brooklyn, and attended Brooklyn College, dropping out after two years in 1975. In 1972, he accepted the position of youth director for the presidential campaign of Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm. Between the years 1973 and 1980 Sharpton served as James Brown&#x27;s tour manager.

==Activism==
In 1969, Sharpton was appointed by Jesse Jackson to serve as youth director of the New York City branch of Operation Breadbasket, a group that focused on the promotion of new and better jobs for African Americans.

In 1971, Sharpton founded the National Youth Movement to raise resources for impoverished youth.

===Bernhard Goetz===
Bernhard Goetz shot four African-American men on a New York City Subway train in Manhattan on December 22, 1984, when they approached him and tried to rob him. At his trial Goetz was acquitted of all charges except for carrying an unlicensed firearm. Sharpton led several marches protesting what he saw as the weak prosecution of the case. Sharpton and other civil rights leaders said Goetz&#x27;s actions were racist and requested a federal civil rights investigation. A federal investigation concluded the shooting was due to an attempted robbery and not race.

===Howard Beach===
On December 20, 1986, three African-American men were assaulted in the Howard Beach neighborhood of Queens by a mob of white men. The three men were chased by their attackers onto the Belt Parkway, where one of them, Michael Griffith, was struck and killed by a passing motorist.

A week later, on December 27, Sharpton led 1,200 demonstrators on a march through the streets of Howard Beach. Residents of the neighborhood, who were overwhelmingly white, yelled racial epithets at the protesters, who were largely black. A special prosecutor was appointed by New York Governor Mario Cuomo after the two surviving victims refused to co-operate with the Queens district attorney. Sharpton&#x27;s role in the case helped propel him to national prominence.

===Bensonhurst===


On August 23, 1989, four African-American teenagers were beaten by a group of 10 to 30 white Italian-American youths in Bensonhurst, a Brooklyn neighborhood. One Bensonhurst resident, armed with a handgun, shot and killed 16-year-old Yusef Hawkins.

In the weeks following the assault and murder, Sharpton led several marches through Bensonhurst. The first protest, just days after the incident, was greeted by neighborhood residents shouting &quot;Niggers go home&quot; and holding watermelons to mock the demonstrators.

Sharpton also threatened that Hawkins&#x27;s three companions would not cooperate with prosecutor Elizabeth Holtzman unless her office agreed to hire more black attorneys. In the end, they cooperated.

In May 1990, when one of the two leaders of the mob was acquitted of the most serious charges brought against him, Sharpton led another protest through Bensonhurst. In January 1991, when other members of the gang were given light sentences, Sharpton planned another march for January 12, 1991. Before that demonstration began, neighborhood resident Michael Riccardi tried to kill Sharpton by stabbing him in the chest. Sharpton recovered from his wounds, and later asked the judge for leniency when Riccardi was sentenced.

===National Action Network===
In 1991, Sharpton founded the National Action Network, an organization designed to increase voter education, to provide services to those in poverty, and to support small community businesses. In 2016, Boise Kimber, an associate of Sharpton and a member of his NAN national board, along with businessman and philanthropist Don Vaccaro, launched Grace Church Websites, a non-profit organization that helps churches create and launch their own websites.

===Crown Heights riot===

The Crown Heights riot began on August 19, 1991, after a car driven by a Jewish man, and part of a procession led by an unmarked police car, went through an intersection and was struck by another vehicle causing it to veer onto the sidewalk where it accidentally struck and killed a seven-year-old Guyanese boy named Gavin Cato and severely injured his cousin Angela. Witnesses could not agree upon the speed and could not agree whether the light was yellow or red. One of the factors that sparked the riot was the arrival of a private ambulance, which was later discovered to be on the orders of a police officer who was worried for the Jewish driver&#x27;s safety, removed him from the scene while Cato lay pinned under his car. After being removed from under the car, Cato and his cousin were treated soon after by a city ambulance. Caribbean-American and African-American residents of the neighborhood rioted for four consecutive days fueled by rumors that the private ambulance had refused to treat Cato. During the riot black youths looted stores, beat Jews in the street, and clashed with groups of Jews, hurling rocks and bottles at one another after Yankel Rosenbaum, a visiting student from Australia, was stabbed and killed by a member of a mob while some chanted &quot;Kill the Jew&quot;, and &quot;get the Jews out&quot;.

Sharpton marched through Crown Heights and in front of the headquarters of the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic movement, shortly after the riot, with about 400 protesters (who chanted &quot;Whose streets? Our streets!&quot; and &quot;No justice, no peace!&quot;), in spite of Mayor David Dinkins&#x27; attempts to keep the march from happening. Some commentators felt Sharpton inflamed tensions by making remarks that included &quot;If the Jews want to get it on, tell them to pin their yarmulkes back and come over to my house.&quot; In his eulogy for Cato, Sharpton said, &quot;The world will tell us he was killed by accident. Yes, it was a social accident...It&#x27;s an accident to allow an apartheid ambulance service in the middle of Crown Heights...Talk about how Oppenheimer in South Africa sends diamonds straight to Tel Aviv and deals with the diamond merchants right here in Crown Heights. The issue is not anti-Semitism; the issue is apartheid...All we want to say is what Jesus said: If you offend one of these little ones, you got to pay for it. No compromise, no meetings, no kaffe klatsch, no skinnin&#x27; and grinnin&#x27;. Pay for your deeds.&quot;

In the decades since, Sharpton has conceded that his language and tone &quot;sometimes exacerbated tensions&quot; though he insisted that his marches were peaceful. In a 2019 speech to a Reform Jewish gathering, Sharpton said that he could have &quot;done more to heal rather than harm&quot;. He recalled receiving a call from Coretta Scott King at the time, during which she told him &quot;sometimes you are tempted to speak to the applause of the crowd rather than the heights of the cause, and you will say cheap things to get cheap applause rather than do high things to raise the nation higher&quot;.

===Freddy&#x27;s Fashion Mart===

In 1995 a black Pentecostal Church, the United House of Prayer, which owned a retail property on 125th Street, asked Fred Harari, a Jewish tenant who operated Freddie&#x27;s Fashion Mart, to evict his longtime subtenant, a black-owned record store called The Record Shack. Sharpton led a protest in Harlem against the planned eviction of The Record Shack, in which he told the protesters, &quot;We will not stand by and allow them to move this brother so that some white interloper can expand his business.&quot;
On December 8, 1995, Roland J. Smith Jr., one of the protesters, entered Harari&#x27;s store with a gun and flammable liquid, shot several customers and set the store on fire. The gunman fatally shot himself, and seven store employees died of smoke inhalation. Fire Department officials discovered that the store&#x27;s sprinkler had been shut down, in violation of the local fire code. Sharpton claimed that the perpetrator was an open critic of himself and his nonviolent tactics. In 2002, Sharpton expressed regret for making the racial remark &quot;white interloper&quot; but denied responsibility for inflaming or provoking the violence.

===Amadou Diallo===
In 1999, Sharpton led a protest to raise awareness about the death of Amadou Diallo, an immigrant from Guinea who was shot dead by NYPD officers. Sharpton claimed that Diallo&#x27;s death was the result of police brutality and racial profiling. Although all four defendants were found not guilty of any crimes in the criminal trial, Diallo&#x27;s family was later awarded $3 million in a wrongful death suit filed against the city.

===Tyisha Miller===

In May 1999, Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, and other activists protested the December 1998 fatal police shooting of Tyisha Miller in central Riverside, California. Miller, a 19-year-old African-American woman, had sat unconscious in a locked car with a flat tire and the engine left running, parked at a local gas station. After her relatives had called 9-1-1, Riverside Police Department officers who responded to the scene observed a gun in the young woman&#x27;s lap, and according to their accounts, she was shaking and foaming at the mouth, and in need of medical attention. When officers decided to break her window to reach her, as one officer reached for the weapon, she allegedly awoke and clutched her firearm, prompting several officers to open fire, hitting her 23 times and killing her. When the Riverside County district attorney stated that the officers involved had erred in judgement but committed no crime, declining to file criminal charges against them, Sharpton participated in protests which reached their zenith when protestors spilled onto the busy SR 91, completely stopping traffic. Sharpton was arrested for his participation and leadership in these protests. Sharpton referred to the special prosecutor, attorney general Bob Abrams, as &quot;Mr. Hitler&quot;.

===Vieques===
In 2001, Sharpton was jailed for 90 days on trespassing charges while protesting against U.S. military target practice exercises in Puerto Rico near a United States Navy bombing site. Sharpton was held in a Puerto Rican lockup for two days and then imprisoned at Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn, on May 25, 2001. He was released on August 17, 2001.

===Ousmane Zongo===
In 2002, Sharpton was involved in protests following the death of West African immigrant Ousmane Zongo. Zongo, who was unarmed, was shot by an undercover police officer during a raid on a warehouse in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Sharpton met with the family and also provided some legal services.

===Sean Bell===

On November 25, 2006, Sean Bell was shot and killed in the Jamaica section of Queens, New York, by plainclothes detectives from the New York Police Department in a fusillade of 50 bullets. The incident sparked fierce criticism of the police from the public and drew comparisons to the 1999 killing of Amadou Diallo. Three of the five detectives involved in the shooting went to trial in 2008 on charges ranging from manslaughter to reckless endangerment but were found not guilty.

On May 7, 2008, in response to the acquittals of the officers, Sharpton coordinated peaceful protests at major river crossings in New York City, including the Brooklyn Bridge, the Queensboro Bridge, the Triborough Bridge, the Manhattan Bridge, the Holland Tunnel, and the Queens–Midtown Tunnel. Sharpton and about 200 others were arrested for blocking traffic and resisting police orders to disperse.

===Dunbar Village===
On March 11, 2008, Sharpton held a press conference to highlight what he said was unequal treatment of four suspected rapists in a high-profile crime in the Dunbar Village Housing Projects in West Palm Beach, Florida. The suspects, who were young black men, were arrested for allegedly raping and beating a black Haitian woman at gunpoint. The crime also involved forcing the woman to perform oral sex on her 12-year-old son.

At his press conference Sharpton said that any violent act toward a woman is inexcusable but he felt that the accused youths were being treated unfairly because they were black. Sharpton contrasted the treatment of the suspects, who were held without bail, with white suspects involved in a gang rape—which he claimed was equivalent to the Dunbar Village attack—who were released after posting bond.

===Reclaim the Dream commemorative march===

On August 28, 2010, Sharpton and other civil rights leaders led a march to commemorate the 47th anniversary of the historic March on Washington. After gathering at Dunbar High School in Washington, D.C., thousands of people marched five miles to the National Mall.

===Tanya McDowell===

In June 2011, Sharpton spoke at a rally in support of Tanya McDowell, who was arrested and charged with larceny for allegedly registering her son for kindergarten in the wrong public school district using a false address. She claimed to spend time in both a Bridgeport, Connecticut, apartment and a homeless shelter in Norwalk, where her son was registered.

===George Zimmerman===

Following the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, Sharpton led several protests and rallies criticizing the Sanford Police Department over the handling of the shooting and called for Zimmerman&#x27;s arrest: &quot;Zimmerman should have been arrested that night. You cannot defend yourself against a pack of Skittles and iced tea.&quot; Sean Hannity accused Sharpton and MSNBC of &quot;rush[ing] to judgment&quot; in the case. MSNBC issued a statement in which they said Sharpton &quot;repeatedly called for calm&quot; and further investigation. Following the acquittal of Zimmerman, Sharpton called the not guilty verdict an &quot;atrocity&quot; and &quot;a slap in the face to those that believe in justice&quot;. Subsequently, Sharpton and his organization, National Action Network, held rallies in several cities denouncing the verdict and called for &quot;Justice for Trayvon&quot;.

===Eric Garner===
After the July 2014 death of Eric Garner on Staten Island, New York, by a New York City Police Department officer, Daniel Pantaleo, Sharpton organized a peaceful protest in Staten Island on the afternoon of July 19, and condemned the police&#x27;s use of the chokehold on Garner, saying that &quot;there is no justification&quot; for it. Sharpton had also planned to lead a protest on August 23, in which participants would have driven over the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, then traveled to the site of the altercation and the office of District Attorney Dan Donovan This idea was scrapped in favor of Sharpton leading a peaceful march along Bay Street in Staten Island, where Garner died; over 5,000 people marched in the demonstration.

===Barack Obama===
In 2014, Glenn Thrush of &quot;Politico&quot; described Sharpton as an &quot;adviser&quot; to President Barack Obama and as Obama&#x27;s &quot;go-to man&quot; on racial issues.

===Ministers March for Justice===
On August 28, 2017, the fifty-fourth anniversary of the March on Washington at which Martin Luther King Jr. gave his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, Sharpton organized the Ministers March for Justice, promising to bring a thousand members of the clergy to Washington, D.C., to deliver a &quot;unified moral rebuke&quot; to President Donald Trump. Several thousand religious leaders were present, including Christians, Jews, Muslims, and Sikhs. &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist Dana Milbank wrote that &quot;President Trump has united us, after all. He brought together the Rev. Al Sharpton and the Jews.&quot;

===George Floyd===

At the funeral of George Floyd on June 4, 2020, Sharpton delivered a eulogy where he called for the four Minneapolis policemen involved in Floyd&#x27;s murder to be brought to justice. He also criticized President Donald Trump for his talk about &quot;bringing in the military&quot; when &quot;some kids wrongly start violence that this family doesn&#x27;t condone&quot; and that Trump has &quot;not said one word about 8 minutes and 46 seconds of police murder of George Floyd&quot;. On April 20, 2021, with the conviction of Derek Chauvin for murdering George Floyd, Sharpton led prayer with the Floyd family in Minneapolis.

===Kwanzaa and Hanukkah===
In December 2022, taking a stand together against the increasing instances of racism and antisemitism in the United States, Sharpton, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Vista Equity Partners CEO and Carnegie Hall Chairman Robert F. Smith, Reverend Conrad Tillard, World Values Network founder and CEO Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, and Elisha Wiesel joined to host 15 Days of Light, celebrating Hanukkah and Kwanzaa in a unifying holiday ceremony at Carnegie Hall. Sharpton said: &quot;There is never a time more needed than now for Blacks and Jews to remember the struggle that we&#x27;ve gone through. You can&#x27;t fight for anybody if you don&#x27;t fight for everybody. I cannot fight for Black rights if I don&#x27;t fight for Jewish rights ... because then it becomes a matter of self-aggrandizement rather than fighting for humanity. It&#x27;s easy for Blacks to stand up for racism. It&#x27;s easy for Jews to stand up to antisemitism. But if you want to really be a leader, you got to speak as a Black against antisemitism and antisemites, and you got to speak as a Jew against racism.&quot;

=== Tyre Nichols ===

At the funeral of Tyre Nichols on February 2, 2023, Sharpton delivered the eulogy for the service. He, alongside vice president Kamala Harris, called on lawmakers to approve the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act and other police reforms.

==Political views==
In September 2007, Sharpton was asked whether he considered it important for the US to have a black president. He responded, &quot;It would be a great moment as long as the black candidate was supporting the interest that would inevitably help our people. A lot of my friends went with Clarence Thomas and regret it to this day. I don&#x27;t assume that just because somebody&#x27;s my color, they&#x27;re my kind. But I&#x27;m warming up to Obama, but I&#x27;m not there yet.&quot;

Sharpton has spoken out against cruelty to animals in a video recorded for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

Sharpton is a supporter of equal rights for gays and lesbians and same-sex marriage. During his 2004 presidential campaign, Sharpton said he thought it was insulting to be asked to discuss the issue of gay marriage. &quot;It&#x27;s like asking do I support black marriage or white marriage... The inference of the question is that gays are not like other human beings.&quot; Sharpton is leading a grassroots movement to eliminate homophobia within the Black church.

In 2014, Sharpton began a push for criminal justice reform, citing the fact that black people represent a greater proportion of those arrested and incarcerated in America.

In August 2017, Sharpton called for the federal government to stop maintaining the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C., because Thomas Jefferson owned 600 slaves and had a sexually abusive relationship with his slave Sally Hemings. He said taxpayer funds should not be used to care for monuments to slave-owners and that private museums were preferable. He went on to elaborate: &quot;People need to understand that people were enslaved. Our families were victims of this. Public monuments [to people like Jefferson] are supported by public funds. You&#x27;re asking me to subsidize the insult to my family.&quot;

Sharpton is an opponent of the Defund the Police movement, charging that the idea is being pushed by &quot;latte liberals&quot; who were out of touch with the African-American community, and that black and poor neighbourhoods &quot;need proper policing&quot; to protect the inhabitants from higher crime rates.

==Reputation==

Sharpton&#x27;s supporters praise &quot;his ability and willingness to defy the power structure that is seen as the cause of their suffering&quot; and consider him &quot;a man who is willing to tell it like it is&quot;. Former Mayor of New York City Ed Koch, one-time foe, said that Sharpton deserves the respect he enjoys among black Americans: &quot;He is willing to go to jail for them, and he is there when they need him.&quot; President Barack Obama said that Sharpton is &quot;the voice of the voiceless and a champion for the downtrodden&quot;. A 2013 Zogby Analytics poll found that one quarter of African Americans said that Sharpton speaks for them.

His critics describe him as &quot;a political radical who is to blame, in part, for the deterioration of race relations&quot;. Sociologist Orlando Patterson has referred to him as a racial arsonist, while liberal columnist Derrick Z. Jackson has called him the black equivalent of Richard Nixon and Pat Buchanan. Sharpton sees much of the criticism as a sign of his effectiveness. &quot;In many ways, what they consider criticism is complimenting my job,&quot; he said. &quot;An activist&#x27;s job is to make public civil rights issues until there can be a climate for change.&quot;

==Controversies==
===Tobacco industry funding===
In 2021, Sharpton was criticized for leading a tobacco industry pushback against a proposed ban on the sale of menthol cigarettes using &quot;cynically manipulative&quot; arguments while his National Action Network accepted funding from tobacco companies.

===Comments on Mormons===
During 2007, Sharpton was accused of bigotry for comments he made in a debate with Christopher Hitchens on May 7, 2007, concerning presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his religion, Mormonism:

In response, a representative for Romney told reporters that &quot;bigotry toward anyone because of their beliefs is unacceptable.&quot; The Catholic League compared Sharpton to Don Imus, and said that his remarks &quot;should finish his career&quot;.

On May 9, during an interview on &quot;Paula Zahn NOW&quot;, Sharpton said that his views on Mormonism were based on the &quot;Mormon Church&#x27;s traditionally racist views regarding blacks&quot; and its interpretation of the so-called &quot;Curse of Ham&quot;. On May 10, Sharpton called two apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and apologized to them for his remarks and asked to meet with them. A spokesman for the Church confirmed that Sharpton had called and said that &quot;we appreciate it very much, Rev. Sharpton&#x27;s call, and we consider the matter closed.&quot; He also apologized to &quot;any member of the Mormon church&quot; who was offended by his comments. Later that month, Sharpton went to Salt Lake City, Utah, where he met with Elder M. Russell Ballard, a leader of the Church, and Elder Robert C. Oaks of the Church&#x27;s Presidency of the Seventy.

===Racial and homophobic comments===
On February 13, 1994, Sharpton told a student audience at Kean University in New Jersey: &quot;White folks was in the caves while we was building empires,&quot; he said. &quot;We built pyramids before Donald Trump even knew what architecture was. We taught philosophy and astrology and mathematics before Socrates and them Greek homos ever got around to it.&quot; Sharpton defended his comments by saying that the term &quot;homo&quot; was not homophobic; however, he added that he no longer uses the term. At the same lecture, he said, &quot;Do some cracker come and tell you, &#x27;Well my mother and father blood go back to the Mayflower,&#x27; you better hold your pocket. That ain&#x27;t nothing to be proud of, that means their forefathers was crooks.&quot;

On one occasion in 1992, he derided moderate black politicians close to the Democratic Party as &quot;cocktail sip Negroes&quot; or &quot;yellow niggers&quot;.

===Tawana Brawley rape case===

On November 28, 1987, Tawana Brawley, a 15-year-old black girl, was found smeared with feces, lying in a garbage bag, her clothing torn and burned and with various slurs and epithets written on her body in charcoal. Brawley claimed she had been assaulted and raped by six white men, some of them police officers, in the town of Wappinger, New York.

Attorneys Alton H. Maddox and C. Vernon Mason joined Sharpton in support of Brawley. A grand jury was convened; after seven months of examining police and medical records, the jury found &quot;overwhelming evidence&quot; that Brawley had fabricated her story. Sharpton, Maddox, and Mason had accused the Dutchess County prosecutor, Steven Pagones, of racism and of being one of the perpetrators of the alleged abduction and rape. The three were successfully sued for defamation, and were ordered to pay $345,000 in damages, with the jury finding Sharpton liable for making seven defamatory statements about Pagones, Maddox for two, and Mason for one. Sharpton refused to pay his share of the damages; it was later paid by a number of black business leaders including Johnnie Cochran.

Sharpton said in 2007 that if he had it to do over again, he might have not attacked Pagones personally, but would otherwise have handled the Brawley case the same way. He added: &quot;I disagreed with the grand jury on Brawley. I believed there was enough evidence to go to trial. Grand jury said there wasn&#x27;t. Okay, fine. Do I have a right to disagree with the grand jury? Many Americans believe O. J. Simpson was guilty. A jury said he wasn&#x27;t. So I have as much right to question a jury as they do. Does it make somebody a racist? No! They just disagreed with the jury. So did I.&quot;

Michael Hardy, who served as defense lawyer for Sharpton in Pagones&#x27; defamation case against him, would becoming a key founding member of National Action Network, serving as Executive Vice President and later also becoming General Counsel in 2008. Hardy served with Sharpton&#x27;s organization until his death in July 2024.

===Work as FBI informant===
Sharpton said in 1988 that he informed for the government in order to stem the flow of crack cocaine into black neighborhoods. He denied informing on civil rights leaders.

In 2002, HBO&#x27;s &quot;Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel&quot; aired a 19-year-old FBI videotape of an undercover sting operation showing Sharpton with an undercover FBI agent posing as a Latin American drug lord. During the discussion, the undercover agent offered Sharpton a 10% commission for arranging drug sales. On the videotape, Sharpton mostly nods and allows the FBI agent to do most of the talking. No drug deal was ever consummated, and no charges were brought against Sharpton as a result of the tape.

In April 2014, The Smoking Gun obtained documents indicating that Sharpton became an FBI informant in 1983 following Sharpton&#x27;s role in a drug sting involving Colombo crime family captain Michael Franzese. Sharpton allegedly recorded incriminating conversations with Genovese and Gambino family mobsters, contributing to the indictments of several underworld figures. Sharpton is referred to in FBI documents as &quot;CI-7&quot;.

Summarizing the evidence supporting that Sharpton was an active FBI informant in the 1980s, William Bastone, the Smoking Gun&#x27;s founder, stated: &quot;If he (Sharpton) didn&#x27;t think he was an informant, the &#x27;Genovese squad&#x27; of the FBI and NYPD officials sure knew him to be an informant. He was paid to be an informant, he carried a briefcase with a recording device in it, and he made surreptitious tape recordings of a Gambino crime family member 10 separate times as an informant. He did it at the direction of the FBI, he was prepped by the FBI, was handed the briefcase by the FBI and was debriefed after the meetings. That&#x27;s an informant.&quot; Sharpton disputes portions of the allegations.

Sharpton is alleged to have secretly recorded conversations with black activists in the 1980s regarding Joanne Chesimard (Assata Shakur) and other underground black militants. Veteran activist Ahmed Obafemi told the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; that he had long suspected Sharpton of taping him with the bugged briefcase.

===Tax issues===
In 1993, Sharpton pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for failing to file a state income tax return. Later, the authorities discovered that one of Mr. Sharpton&#x27;s for-profit companies, Raw Talent, which he used as a repository for money from speaking engagements, was also not paying taxes, a failure that continued for years.

On May 9, 2008, the Associated Press reported that Sharpton and his businesses owed almost $1.5 million in unpaid taxes and penalties. Sharpton owed $931,000 in federal income tax and $366,000 to New York, and his for-profit company, Rev. Al Communications, owed another $176,000 to the state.

The Internal Revenue Service sent subpoenas to several corporations that had donated to Sharpton&#x27;s National Action Network. Sharpton countered the investigative actions with a charge that they reflected a political agenda by United States agencies.

On September 29, 2010, Robert Snell of &quot;The Detroit News&quot; reported that the Internal Revenue Service had filed a notice of federal tax lien against Sharpton in New York City in the amount of over $538,000. Sharpton&#x27;s lawyer asserts that the notice of federal tax lien relates to Sharpton&#x27;s year 2009 federal income tax return, the due date of which has been extended to October 15, 2010, according to the lawyer. However, the Snell report states that the lien relates to taxes &quot;assessed during 2009&quot;.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Sharpton and his for-profit businesses owed $4.5 million in state and federal taxes as of November 2014.

==Personal life==
In 1971 while touring with James Brown, Sharpton met future wife Kathy Jordan, who was a backing singer. Sharpton and Jordan married in 1980. The couple separated in 2004. They have two daughters, Ashley and Dominique. In July 2013, the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; reported that Sharpton, while still married to his second wife (Kathy Jordan), now had a self-described &quot;girlfriend&quot;, Aisha McShaw, aged 35, and that the couple had &quot;been an item for months... photographed at elegant bashes all over the country&quot;. McShaw, the &quot;Daily News&quot; reported, referred to herself professionally as both a &quot;personal stylist&quot; and &quot;personal banker&quot;.

Sharpton is an honorary member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity.

===Religion===
Sharpton was licensed and ordained a Pentecostal minister by Bishop F. D. Washington at the age of nine or ten. After Bishop Washington&#x27;s death in the late 1980s, Sharpton became a Baptist. He was re-baptized as a member of the Bethany Baptist Church in 1994 by the Reverend William Augustus Jones and became a Baptist minister.

During 2007, Sharpton participated in a public debate with atheist writer Christopher Hitchens, defending his religious faith and his belief in the existence of God.

===Assassination attempt===

On January 12, 1991, Sharpton escaped serious injury when he was stabbed in the chest in the schoolyard at P.S. 205 by Michael Riccardi while Sharpton was preparing to lead a protest through Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, New York. The intoxicated attacker was apprehended by Sharpton&#x27;s aides and handed over to police, who were present for the planned protest.

In 1992, Riccardi was convicted of first-degree assault. Sharpton asked the judge for leniency when sentencing Riccardi. The judge sentenced Riccardi to five to 15 years in jail, and he served ten years in prison being released on parole on January 8, 2001.

Sharpton, although forgiving his attacker and pleading for leniency on his behalf, filed suit against New York City alleging that the many police present had failed to protect him from his attacker. In December 2003, he finally reached a $200,000 settlement with the city just as jury selection was about to start.

===Indirect connection to Strom Thurmond===

In February 2007, genealogist Megan Smolenyak discovered that Sharpton&#x27;s great-grandfather, Coleman Sharpton, was a slave owned by Julia Thurmond, whose grandfather was Strom Thurmond&#x27;s great-great-grandfather. Coleman Sharpton was later freed.

The Sharpton family name originated with Coleman Sharpton&#x27;s previous owner, who was named Alexander Sharpton.

== Political campaigns ==
Sharpton has run unsuccessfully for elected office on multiple occasions. Of his unsuccessful runs, he said that winning office may not have been his goal, saying in an interview: &quot;Much of the media criticism of me assumes their goals and they impose them on me. Well, those might not be my goals. So they will say, &#x27;Well, Sharpton has not won a political office.&#x27; But that might not be my goal! Maybe I ran for political office to change the debate, or to raise the social justice question.&quot; Sharpton ran for a United States Senate seat from New York in 1988, 1992, and 1994. In 1997, he ran for Mayor of New York City. During his 1992 bid, he and his wife lived in a home in Englewood, New Jersey, though he said his residence was an apartment in Brooklyn.

On December 15, 2005, Sharpton agreed to repay $100,000 in public funds he received from the federal government for his 2004 presidential campaign. The repayment was required because Sharpton had exceeded federal limits on personal expenditures for his campaign. At that time, his most recent Federal Election Commission filings (from January 1, 2005) stated that Sharpton&#x27;s campaign still had debts of $479,050 and owed Sharpton himself $145,146 for an item listed as &quot;Fundraising Letter Preparation — Kinko&#x27;s&quot;.

In 2009, the Federal Election Commission announced it had levied a fine of $285,000 against Sharpton&#x27;s 2004 presidential campaign team for breaking campaign finance rules during his bid for President.

Sharpton said in 2007 that he would not enter the 2008 presidential race.

He also made a cameo appearance by telephone on the Food Network series, &quot;The Secret Life Of . . .&quot;, when host Jim O&#x27;Connor expressed disbelief that a restaurant owner who&#x27;d named a dish after Sharpton actually knew him.

In 1988, during an appearance on &quot;The Morton Downey Jr. Show&quot;, Sharpton and Congress of Racial Equality National Chairman Roy Innis got into a heated argument about the Tawana Brawley case and Innis shoved Sharpton to the floor.

In 1999, Sharpton appeared in a documentary about black nationalism hosted by Louis Theroux, as part of the &quot;Weird Weekends&quot; series.

During the 2005 Tony Awards, Sharpton appeared in a number put on by the cast of &quot;The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee&quot;.

===Broadcast hosting===
In June 2005, Sharpton signed a contract with Matrix Media to produce and host a live two-hour daily talk program, but it never aired. In November 2005, Sharpton signed with Radio One to host a daily national talk radio program, which began airing on January 30, 2006, entitled &quot;Keepin It Real with Al Sharpton&quot;.

On August 29, 2011, Sharpton became the host of &quot;PoliticsNation&quot;, the MSNBC show which originally aired weeknights during the 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time hour.

<doc id="166705" wikidata="Q202314" url="?curid=166705" title="Thin Lizzy">
<text>Thin Lizzy are an Irish rock band formed in Dublin in 1969. The band initially consisted of bass guitarist, lead vocalist and principal songwriter Phil Lynott, drummer Brian Downey, guitarist Eric Bell and organist Eric Wrixon although Wrixon left after a few months. Bell left at the end of 1973 and was briefly replaced by Gary Moore, who himself was replaced in mid-1974 by twin lead guitarists: Scott Gorham, who remained with the band until their break-up in 1983, and Brian Robertson, who remained with the band until 1978 when Moore re-joined. Moore left a second time and was replaced by Snowy White in 1980, who was himself replaced by John Sykes in 1982. The line-up was augmented by keyboardist Darren Wharton in 1980. 

The singles &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot; (1972), &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot; (1976) and &quot;Waiting for an Alibi&quot; (1979) were international hits, and several Thin Lizzy albums reached the top ten in the UK. The band&#x27;s music reflects a wide range of influences including blues, soul music, psychedelic rock, and traditional Irish folk music, but is generally classified as hard rock or sometimes heavy metal. Lynott led the group throughout their fourteen-year recording career of twelve studio albums, writing or co-writing almost all the band&#x27;s material. He was the first Black Irishman to achieve commercial success in the field of rock music. Thin Lizzy featured several guitarists throughout their history, with Downey and Lynott as the rhythm section on the drums and bass guitar. As well as being multiracial, the band drew their early members not only from both sides of the Irish border but from both the Catholic and Protestant communities during The Troubles.

After Lynott&#x27;s death in 1986, various incarnations of the band emerged over the years based initially around guitarists Gorham and Sykes although Sykes left the band in 2009. Gorham later continued with a new line-up which included Downey. In 2012, Gorham and Downey decided against recording new material as Thin Lizzy so a new band, Black Star Riders, was formed to tour and produce new releases. Thin Lizzy have since reunited for occasional concerts.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine describes the band as distinctly hard rock, &quot;far apart from the braying mid-70s metal pack&quot;. AllMusic critic John Dougan wrote, &quot;As the band&#x27;s creative force, Lynott was a more insightful and intelligent writer than many of his ilk, preferring slice-of-life working-class dramas of love and hate influenced by Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and virtually all of the Irish literary tradition.&quot;

==History==
===Pre-formation===
Two of the founding members of Thin Lizzy, bass guitarist and vocalist Phil Lynott and drummer Brian Downey, met while at school in Dublin in the early 1960s. Lynott, born on 20 August 1949 in West Bromwich, England, to an Irish mother Philomena (1930–2019) and Guyanese father Cecil Parris (1925–2010), was brought up in Dublin from the age of three. Downey was born on 27 January 1951 in Dublin. Lynott joined local band the Black Eagles as vocalist in 1963, and Downey was recruited as drummer in 1965. In 1967, Lynott was asked to join Skid Row by bass guitarist Brush Shiels, who brought teenage Belfast guitarist Gary Moore into the band early in 1968. After a disappointing television appearance in June 1969, Shiels fired Lynott, although they remained on good terms and Shiels subsequently taught Lynott to play bass guitar. Lynott then formed Orphanage with Downey on drums after Downey&#x27;s previous band, Sugar Shack, had split.

Guitarist Eric Bell, born in Belfast on 3 September 1947, began his career playing in local bands such as the Deltones, Shades of Blue and the Bluebeats, and the last incarnation of Them to feature Van Morrison, between September and October 1966. Bell then moved to Dublin and joined Irish showband the Dreams, but left in 1969 with a view to forming a rock band. An acquaintance of Bell&#x27;s, Belfast organist Eric Wrixon, also a former member of Them, had also moved to Dublin and joined the showband circuit, but had similar plans to progress towards rock music.

===Early years (1969–1972)===

In December 1969, Bell and Wrixon met by chance in a pub in Dublin and found that they shared similar ideas of forming a band, and decided to visit the Countdown Club where they saw Lynott and Downey perform with Orphanage. Lynott was not playing bass guitar at this time, but Bell was particularly impressed by Downey, and introduced himself to Lynott and Downey during a break. When Bell asked if they would consider forming a band together, Downey was initially sceptical, but both men were aware of Bell&#x27;s musical reputation. They agreed that night on condition that Lynott play bass guitar as well as sing, and that the band would perform some of Lynott&#x27;s compositions. Bell later said, &quot;From there on in we were a band.&quot; Wrixon was also included as organist in the as yet unnamed band, making the initial line-up a quartet. The following week, Lynott visited Bell at his flat and played him recordings of some of his own songs. Bell was impressed: &quot;They were so good. I knew right away I could put my guitar style into them.&quot;

The band began to attract attention in the Irish music press almost immediately, as the band began rehearsals in January 1970. On 1 January, &quot;New Spotlight&quot; magazine announced that Bell and Wrixon were to be a part of a new band. By early February, the press had begun to question the delay in any public announcement of the &quot;Bell-Lynott supergroup&quot;. The name Thin Lizzy was announced to the press on 18 February. The name came from an idea by Bell about a robot character in &quot;The Dandy&quot; called Tin Lizzie, which they adjusted to Thin Lizzy as a playful reference to the local Dublin accent, in which &quot;thin&quot; would be pronounced as &quot;t&#x27;in&quot;. For some of their early gigs, the band were mistakenly promoted as &quot;Tin Lizzy&quot; or &quot;Tin Lizzie&quot;. The group&#x27;s first gig was at a school hall in Cloghran, near Dublin Airport, in 1970, though sources vary on the date from 16 February, 19 February, and 20 February.

In July 1970, the band released a single, &quot;The Farmer&quot;/&quot;I Need You&quot;, on EMI with the B-side written by John D&#x27;ardis, who owned Trend Studios where the single was recorded. The single sold just 283 copies and is now a collectors&#x27; item. Wrixon left the band before the single&#x27;s release, meaning there was a greater share of income for the three remaining members. He moved to mainland Europe before returning to Belfast, rejoining his old band, Them. Wrixon died on 13 July 2015.

By the end of the year, Thin Lizzy were signed to Decca Records by their manager, Brian Tuite, and they travelled to London in January 1971 to record their debut album, &quot;Thin Lizzy&quot;. The album sold moderately well, but did not chart in the UK despite airplay and support from influential DJs John Peel and Kid Jensen. Around March 1971, the band permanently relocated to London, before the release of the unsuccessful &quot;New Day&quot; EP in August. Despite poor sales, Decca agreed to finance the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Shades of a Blue Orphanage&quot;, released in March 1972. Like the previous LP, the songs were filled with Lynott&#x27;s personal anecdotes and references to his life in Dublin and the people he knew there. Musically the style was Celtic, with little warning of the hard rock direction that the band were to take in the future. This album also did not chart in the UK.

In mid-1972, Thin Lizzy were asked to record an album of Deep Purple covers. Vocals and keyboards were handled by members of another band, Elmer Fudd, and a few instrumental tracks composed by the band were also included, including Bell playing the traditional &quot;Danny Boy&quot; in the style of Jimi Hendrix. The album was issued as being by Funky Junction, with no mention of Thin Lizzy. It was released as &quot;Funky Junction Play a Tribute to Deep Purple&quot; in January 1973.

===&quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot; (1972–1974)===
In late 1972, the band embarked upon a high-profile tour of the UK with Slade, who were enjoying a string of hit singles at the time, and Suzi Quatro. Around the same time, Decca released Thin Lizzy&#x27;s version of a traditional Irish ballad, &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot;, as a single. The band was angry at the release, feeling that the song did not represent their sound or their image, but the single topped the Irish chart, and reached No. 6 in the UK in February 1973, resulting in an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. It also charted in many countries across Europe. However, the follow-up single, &quot;Randolph&#x27;s Tango&quot;, was a return to Lynott&#x27;s more obscure work, and it did not chart outside Ireland.

The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Vagabonds of the Western World&quot;, was released in September 1973 following strong airplay in the UK, but again failed to chart. The accompanying single &quot;The Rocker&quot; also found little success outside Ireland, and the momentum gained from their hit single was lost. Towards the end of 1973, Eric Bell began to feel constricted with the changing style of the group, which left less room for free-form jamming and had people wanting the band to create a follow-up hit to &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot;. Matters came to a head during a gig on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1973 at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, where he walked off stage halfway through the show and had to be persuaded to finish the set. The next day, he quit the group, and was immediately replaced by ex-Skid Row guitarist Gary Moore to help finish the tour. Moore stayed until April 1974; the band recorded three songs with him in that time, including the version of &quot;Still in Love with You&quot; that was included on the fourth album &quot;Nightlife&quot;. He left the group after being concerned about his health and struggling to compete with Lynott for control, and formed Colosseum II with Jon Hiseman.

With the departure of Moore, Lynott decided to expand the line-up with two guitarists, and recruited two new members to complete a tour of Germany in May 1974. These were ex-Atomic Rooster and Hard Stuff guitarist John Cann, and Berlin-born Andy Gee, who had played with Peter Bardens and Ellis. This lineup proved to be temporary, as Lynott and Cann did not get on personally, and Gee was under contract to another record label. The tour was ended early when a disillusioned Downey quit the band, and had to be begged to reconsider, at a time when Thin Lizzy&#x27;s contract with Decca was coming to an end.

Auditions were held for new members, and Lynott and Downey eventually settled on 18-year-old Glaswegian guitarist Brian Robertson, and Californian Scott Gorham. The new line-up gelled quickly, dropped most of the old songs when they played live, and secured a new record deal with Phonogram, but the resulting album &quot;Nightlife&quot; was a disappointment for the band due to its soft production and underdeveloped style. Robertson described Ron Nevison&#x27;s production as &quot;pretty naff&quot; and Gorham said the record was &quot;ridiculously tame&quot;. Like the previous three albums, it failed to chart, selling around 10,000 copies.

===&quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot; (1975–1977)===
In early 1975, Thin Lizzy toured the United States for the first time, in support of Bob Seger and Bachman–Turner Overdrive (BTO). When BTO toured Europe later in the year to support their hit single &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Seen Nothing Yet&quot;, Thin Lizzy again accompanied them on what was a very high-profile tour. They then recorded the &quot;Fighting&quot; album, which became the first Thin Lizzy album to chart in the UK, reaching No. 60, although the singles still did not chart. Opening with Seger&#x27;s &quot;Rosalie&quot;, the album showed the first real evidence of the twin guitar sound that would lead the band towards their greatest successes, particularly with the dual harmonies of &quot;Wild One&quot; and both guitarists&#x27; soloing on &quot;Suicide&quot;.

After a successful multi-band tour in support of Status Quo, the band recorded the album &quot;Jailbreak&quot;, which proved to be their breakthrough record. Released on 26 March 1976, it featured the worldwide hit &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot; which reached No. 8 in the UK, and No. 12 in the US, their first charting record in that country. The album also charted well on both sides of the Atlantic, reaching No. 10 in the UK and No. 18 in the US, and the follow-up single, &quot;Jailbreak&quot;, also performed well. The twin guitar sound had been fully developed by this time and was in evidence throughout the album, particularly on the hit single, and other tracks such as &quot;Emerald&quot;, &quot;Warriors&quot; and &quot;Cowboy Song&quot;. The album is considered to have financially secured the band, not only enabling them to survive and continue, but also be able to feel the freedom needed to be able to experiment with higher concept thought and Lynott&#x27;s more lyrically challenging pieces that the group went on to pen. Thin Lizzy toured the US in support of various bands such as Aerosmith, Rush and REO Speedwagon, and they planned to tour there again in June 1976, this time with Rainbow. However, Lynott fell ill with hepatitis and the tour was cancelled, which set them back a few months.

While Lynott was ill, he wrote most of the following album, &quot;Johnny the Fox&quot;. The album was recorded in August 1976 and the sessions began to reveal tensions between Lynott and Robertson; for example, there was disagreement over the composition credits of the hit single &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe a Word&quot;. Lynott was still drawing on Celtic mythology and his own personal experiences for lyric ideas, which dominated &quot;Johnny the Fox&quot; and the other albums of Thin Lizzy&#x27;s successful mid-1970s period. The tour to support the album was very successful and there were further high-profile TV appearances, such as the &quot;Rod Stewart BBC TV Special&quot;.

An important tour of the US in December 1976 had to be cancelled when Brian Robertson&#x27;s hand was injured by a broken bottle during a fight at The Speakeasy Club in London, the night before the band were due to fly. Robertson maintains that, contrary to reports at the time, he was not drunk and had only gone to the venue for a meal. Lynott was angry and replaced Robertson with Gary Moore for another tour of the States in January–April 1977, this time supporting Queen. The tour was a success and Lynott asked Moore to stay on, but he returned to his previous band, Colosseum II. Robertson had not been sacked but was unsure of his position and made plans to start another band with Jimmy Bain of Rainbow. Before the American tour, Lynott had also invited Irish guitarist Jimi Slevin to &quot;try out a few things&quot; with Thin Lizzy, prompting speculation that the ex-Skid Row member could replace Robertson.

Thin Lizzy flew to Canada in May 1977 as a trio to record &quot;Bad Reputation&quot;, with Gorham handling all the guitar parts. A month into the sessions, at Gorham&#x27;s urging, Robertson joined them, in his own words, &quot;as a session player&quot; and in Lynott&#x27;s words, &quot;as a guest&quot;. Robertson added lead guitar tracks to three songs as well as rhythm guitar and keyboards, and was officially reinstated in July. The album was released in September and sold well, reaching No. 4 in the UK, after a successful single, &quot;Dancing in the Moonlight (It&#x27;s Caught Me in Its Spotlight)&quot;. Also in 1977, Thin Lizzy headlined the Reading Festival, and played Dalymount Park on 21 August.

===&quot;Live and Dangerous&quot; (1978)===
In 1978, Thin Lizzy released their first live album &quot;Live and Dangerous&quot;. There is some disagreement over just how much of the album is actually recorded live – producer Tony Visconti claimed that the only parts that were not overdubbed were the drums and the audience. However Brian Robertson has disputed this, saying that he had refused Lynott&#x27;s request to re-record a guitar solo, and that the only overdubs were backing vocals and some guitar parts by Gorham. He added, &quot;It&#x27;s just not true. The only reason we said that it was recorded all over was obviously for tax reasons... so everything that Visconti claims is bollocks.&quot; Gorham concurs, stating that he attempted to re-record a solo but could not recreate the live sound, adding, &quot;I re-did &quot;one&quot; rhythm track and a few backing vocals. But that&#x27;s it.&quot; The album was a huge success, reaching No. 2 in the UK, and was ranked as the best live album of all time by &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine in 2004.

The permanent departure of Robertson occurred some time after a gig in Ibiza on 6 July 1978, the disagreements with Lynott having reached a breaking point. (Robertson then teamed up with Jimmy Bain to front their new band, Wild Horses.)

===The return of Gary Moore (1978–1979)===

Lynott replaced Robertson with Gary Moore again, and around this time the band loosely joined forces with Steve Jones and Paul Cook of the Sex Pistols, and also with Chris Spedding and Jimmy Bain, to form The Greedy Bastards, who played a small number of gigs playing a varied selection of songs. In this way Lynott was able to align his band with the punk movement and avoid being tagged as a &#x27;dinosaur&#x27; as many other 1970s rock bands had been. Other occasional members of The Greedy Bastards included Bob Geldof and Pete Briquette of the Boomtown Rats.

The band began another tour of the US in August of 1978, followed by a trip to Australia and New Zealand. Brian Downey did not accompany them, having contracted pneumonia and preferring to spend some time in Ireland. He was replaced for the tour by American drummer Mark Nauseef. On their return, Downey rejoined the band and at the beginning of 1979 they recorded &quot;Black Rose: A Rock Legend&quot; in Paris. The sessions were marked by the increasing drug habits of Lynott and Gorham, and the general presence of drugs around the band. This also showed in the subject matter on the album, in songs such as &quot;Got to Give It Up&quot;. Celtic influences remained, however, particularly in the album closer &quot;Róisín Dubh&quot;, a seven-minute medley of traditional Irish songs given a twin guitar rock veneer. Two singles, &quot;Waiting for an Alibi&quot; and &quot;Do Anything You Want To&quot;, were successful, and the album reached No. 2 in the UK. A third, moderately successful single, &quot;Sarah&quot; was Lynott&#x27;s ode to his new-born daughter.

However, on 4 July 1979, after playing their Day on the Green set in Oakland, Gary Moore abruptly left Thin Lizzy in the middle of another tour. Years later, Moore said he had no regrets about walking out, &quot;but maybe it was wrong the way I did it. I could&#x27;ve done it differently, I suppose. But I just had to leave.&quot; He subsequently pursued his solo career, releasing several successful albums. He had collaborated with Lynott and Downey on his 1978 album &quot;Back on the Streets&quot; and the hit single &quot;Parisienne Walkways&quot; before leaving Thin Lizzy, and in 1985 he and Lynott teamed up again on the UK No. 5 single &quot;Out in the Fields&quot;. Gary Moore died of a heart attack in Estepona, Spain, on 6 February 2011, aged 58.

After Moore&#x27;s departure, Thin Lizzy continued the tour for a few nights as a trio before Lynott brought in Midge Ure to replace him on a temporary basis. Ure had prior plans to join Ultravox, but had co-written a song, &quot;Get Out of Here&quot;, with Lynott on &quot;Black Rose: A Rock Legend&quot;, and agreed to help Thin Lizzy complete their touring commitments. He also contributed guitar parts for &quot;The Continuing Saga of the Ageing Orphans&quot;, a compilation album of remixed and overdubbed versions of Eric Bell-era tracks. On their return to the UK, the band were to headline the Reading Festival for the second time on 25 August 1979, but had to cancel due to the disruption within the line-up.

Before a tour of Japan beginning in September, Lynott decided to bring in another guitarist, Dave Flett, who had played with Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band, to enable Ure to switch to playing keyboards where necessary. The tour was completed successfully, but the line-up now contained two temporary members, and Lynott was spending a lot of time on projects outside Thin Lizzy, including composing and producing material for other bands, as well as putting together his first solo album, &quot;Solo in Soho&quot;. Lynott also reactivated The Greedy Bastards, who released a one-off Christmas single, &quot;A Merry Jingle&quot;, in December 1979 as simply The Greedies. With the group now composed of Lynott, Gorham and Downey with Sex Pistols Jones and Cook, the single reached No. 28 in the UK.

===Later years and break-up (1980–1983)===
While Lynott searched for a permanent guitarist, he and the other members of Thin Lizzy, past and present, worked on &quot;Solo in Soho&quot; which was released in April 1980, and the next Thin Lizzy album, &quot;Chinatown&quot;. Lynott got married on 14 February, and his wife gave birth to a second daughter in July. Dave Flett had hoped to be made a permanent member of Thin Lizzy but Lynott chose Snowy White, who had played with Pink Floyd and Peter Green. Ure was still acting as a temporary keyboard player at gigs during early 1980, but was replaced by Darren Wharton in April, shortly after White joined the band. Wharton was only 18 at the time and was initially hired on a temporary basis. This new line-up completed the &quot;Chinatown&quot; album between short tours, and two singles were released from it. The first, &quot;Chinatown&quot;, reached No. 21 in the UK, but the second, &quot;Killer on the Loose&quot;, reached the top 10 amid much adverse publicity due to the ongoing activities of serial killer Peter Sutcliffe, known as &quot;The Yorkshire Ripper&quot;.
&quot;Chinatown&quot; was finally released in October 1980, and reached No. 7 in the UK, but by this time Thin Lizzy albums were not even reaching the top 100 in the US. After a successful tour of Japan and Australia, the band undertook what was to be their final tour of the US in late 1980.
At the beginning of 1981, Lynott began work on his second solo album, using Thin Lizzy members among a large group of backing musicians. Around the same time, the band were recording material for the next Thin Lizzy album, and as before, the sessions seemed to merge to the extent that musicians were not always sure which album they were working on. Producer for the Thin Lizzy sessions, Chris Tsangarides, stated, &quot;The feeling of confusion was in the air in that sometimes nobody knew if they were working on a Phil solo record or a Lizzy album.&quot; Snowy White had previously felt that, as a member of Thin Lizzy, he should have been paid as a session player to appear on Lynott&#x27;s solo recordings.

In April 1981, the band&#x27;s first &#x27;greatest hits&#x27; album was released, and &quot;The Adventures of Thin Lizzy&quot; reached No. 6 in the UK, although a stand-alone single, &quot;Trouble Boys&quot;, only reached No. 53, the band&#x27;s worst chart placing since 1975. According to White and Wharton, Lynott was the only person who wanted to release it, and nobody else liked the song. &quot;Trouble Boys&quot; had even been pencilled in as the title for the new album, but the single&#x27;s chart failure resulted in the song being dropped from the album and the title changed to &quot;Renegade&quot;. One highlight for the band at this time was headlining the first-ever Slane Castle concert on 16 August, with support from Kirsty MacColl, Hazel O&#x27;Connor and U2.

Lynott&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;The Philip Lynott Album&quot;, was delayed until 1982 while &quot;Renegade&quot; was completed and released in November 1981. &quot;Renegade&quot; was not successful, only reaching No. 38 in the UK and No. 157 in the US. A single, &quot;Hollywood (Down on Your Luck)&quot;, also flopped, although it did reach No. 24 on the US Mainstream Rock chart. Only two songs from the album were written solely by Lynott, with the other members of the band contributing more to the compositions. Both Gorham and Wharton have since stated their dissatisfaction with some of the songs, such as &quot;Angel of Death&quot;, &quot;Fats&quot; and &quot;Mexican Blood&quot;. Wharton was omitted from the band photos on the back of the record sleeve, despite the fact that he was by this time a permanent member of the band. &quot;It hurt me a great deal&quot;, he later said.

====&quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot;====
The beginning of 1982 was marred by both Downey and Gorham having to take breaks from the European tour to recover from personal problems. Downey was involved in a fight in a nightclub in Denmark in February, and Gorham was suffering from drug-induced exhaustion. Downey missed five concerts, and was replaced by Mark Nauseef again for three of them, and by Mike Mesbur of support band The Lookalikes for the other two. In March, Gorham collapsed and returned home; eight concerts were performed as a quartet and six others were postponed.

Later in the year, Lynott went on a solo tour and released his second solo album, which did not sell particularly well. Snowy White left the band in August 1982, having tired of the disorganised schedules and Lynott&#x27;s drug problems, although by his own admission he was too restrained and quiet to fit in well with his more raucous bandmates. White went on to achieve top ten chart success in the UK with his single &quot;Bird of Paradise&quot; in 1983. Long-time co-manager Chris O&#x27;Donnell also left at this time, later stating, &quot;A once-brilliant band was turning to crap before my very eyes.&quot;

Lynott wanted to find a replacement for White before starting to record the next album, which would turn out to be the band&#x27;s last. By September 1982, after some unsuccessful rehearsals with Dutch guitarist Adrian Vandenberg, he had settled on John Sykes who had been a member of Tygers of Pan Tang, and he co-wrote the first single from the album, &quot;Cold Sweat&quot;, although the rest of the album had already been written. &quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot; was released in March 1983, and was much more successful than its predecessor, reaching No. 4 in the UK. Sykes&#x27; presence had rejuvenated the band musically, the composing credits were evenly shared, and the style had grown much heavier, veering towards heavy metal.

The tour to support the album was to be a farewell tour, although Lynott was not convinced that this would be the end of the band. Sykes wanted to continue, although Gorham had had enough. The tour was successful, and some concerts were recorded to compile a live album. Partway into the tour, many of Thin Lizzy&#x27;s past guitarists were invited onstage to contribute to some of the songs they had originally recorded, the only exception being Snowy White. The album was released in October 1983 as &quot;Life&quot;, which included an older performance of &quot;Renegade&quot; featuring White, and reached No. 29 in the UK. The tour continued while two more singles were released, the last of them, &quot;The Sun Goes Down&quot;, only reaching No. 52 in August. Lynott also undertook another solo tour, accompanied by Downey and Sykes, under the name of The Three Musketeers.

After a difficult leg of the tour in Japan, where some members of the band had difficulty obtaining heroin, Thin Lizzy played their final UK concert before their break-up at the Reading Festival on 28 August 1983, which was eventually released in 1992 as their &quot;BBC Radio One Live in Concert&quot; album. The last concert came in Nuremberg on 4 September, at the Monsters of Rock festival, after which the band members went their separate ways.

===Post-Thin Lizzy projects, Lynott&#x27;s death, and tributes (1985–1996)===
Before the end of 1983, Lynott formed a new band called Grand Slam, but they were never able to secure a contract with a record company and split by the beginning of 1985. Sykes and Downey initially agreed to be a part of the band, but Sykes joined Whitesnake and Downey also changed his mind. Lynott began to focus more on his solo career and enjoyed a No. 5 hit single &quot;Out in the Fields&quot; with Gary Moore in May 1985. The song was composed by Moore and was taken from his solo album &quot;Run for Cover&quot;, which featured various contributions from Lynott. Lynott&#x27;s solo efforts did not fare so well, and his last single, &quot;Nineteen&quot;, only reached No. 76 in the UK.

Before his death, Lynott was planning a third solo album, and had spoken to Downey about a possible reformation of Thin Lizzy around March 1986, possibly with Gorham and Sykes, and had booked studio time for January of that year. &quot;Phil asked Brian Downey and I to re-form Thin Lizzy and we both agreed,&quot; recalled guitarist Robin George, on whose album &quot;Dangerous Music&quot; Lynott had played. &quot;We made some recordings in the studio in his back garden in the house at Kew during December [1985]. It went absolutely great… Unfortunately, the cassette of our material failed to resurface after his death. It was the only copy. It was such a shame as Phil was vibed up about the new Lizzy.&quot;

Lynott died in hospital in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on 4 January 1986, aged 36, having suffered from internal abscesses, pneumonia and septicaemia, brought on by his drug dependency, which led to multiple organ failure.

On 17 May, Thin Lizzy reformed for the Self Aid concert, with a line-up of Gary Moore, Downey, Gorham, Wharton and Bob Daisley on bass. Bob Geldof and Moore handled most lead vocals, though various singers got onstage for &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot;. A compilation album, &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot;, was released in 1987, and also that year, the &quot;Vibe for Philo&quot; tribute concert in Lynott&#x27;s memory was organised by Dublin DJ and promoter Smiley Bolger, which continues on an annual basis on the anniversary of Lynott&#x27;s death.

The remaining members of Thin Lizzy did not work together until the recording of the single &quot;Dedication&quot; in October 1990, when a rough demo of Lynott&#x27;s called &quot;Guiding Light&quot; was worked into a finished song to commemorate the fifth anniversary of his death. The song dated from the Grand Slam days and had been originally written with guitarist Laurence Archer. Modern recording techniques were used to replace the guitar and drum tracks with new work by Downey and Gorham. Gary Moore had agreed to participate as well, but ultimately did not do so. The song charted in the UK at No. 35 during early 1991, and No. 2 in Ireland, and featured on another greatest hits compilation album, &quot;&quot;, released in February of that year, which reached No. 8 in the UK album chart. However, a follow-up reissue of &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot; only reached No. 63 in the UK, although it peaked at No. 16 in Ireland.

Following this, numerous small reunion projects began to appear. In 1991, a line-up featuring Robertson and Downey performed with Bobby Tench on lead vocals, ex-Grand Slam member Doish Nagle on guitar and Doug Brockie on bass. They toured Ireland briefly with a series of &quot;An Evening of Thin Lizzy&quot; concerts. In August 1994, Downey, Bell, Robertson and Wharton held a tribute concert in Wolverhampton, together with tribute bands Limehouse Lizzy, Ain&#x27;t Lizzy and Bad Habitz. Another version of Thin Lizzy was formed later that year by John Sykes (now also performing lead vocals) with Downey, Gorham and Wharton, and with bass parts played by Marco Mendoza, who had played with Sykes in Blue Murder from 1991 to 1993. The tour was advertised as a tribute to Phil Lynott. This line-up also played at the Vibe for Philo gig on 4 January 1996, with a number of other notable musicians including Eric Bell, Midge Ure, Brush Shiels, Henry Rollins, and Joe Elliott and Rick Savage from Def Leppard. Boxer Steve Collins also performed, reciting the lyrics to &quot;Warriors&quot;. Brian Robertson was absent due to injury.

In 1994, a collection of Thin Lizzy tracks from the BBC Radio 1 Peel Sessions was released, and yet another compilation album was brought out in 1996, called &quot;Wild One: The Very Best Of Thin Lizzy&quot;. This was successful, although it did not feature the title track, &quot;Wild One&quot;.

On 20 August 1996, Rude Awakening bassist Robert Ryder held &quot;A Celebration of the Life of Philip Lynott&quot; at the Palace in Hollywood, California, at the request of Lynott&#x27;s mother, Philomena, to commemorate both Phil Lynott&#x27;s birthday and the tenth year of his death. Philomena Lynott, her partner Dennis Keeley, and Smiley Bolger (Ireland&#x27;s Vibe for Philo promoter) were flown to Los Angeles by Ryder to make a personal appearance at the show. It featured concert performances by Rude Awakening, Billy Sheehan, Rudy Sarzo, John Norum, Carmine Appice, Phantom Blue, Soma, producer Roy Z and his band the Tribe of Gypsies, Mark Ferrari, Oslo, Bang Tango, Stash, Iron Cross and Irish singer-songwriter Mark Dignam.

===Thin Lizzy without Lynott (1996–present)===
====1996–2010: John Sykes era====
In 1996 John Sykes decided to reactivate Thin Lizzy, presenting the band as a tribute to Phil Lynott&#x27;s life and work. He decided to take on the role of lead vocals himself in the absence of Lynott, and persuaded Scott Gorham, Brian Downey and Darren Wharton to return to the fold. To complete the line-up, Marco Mendoza continued in Lynott&#x27;s role as bass player. They received criticism for using the Thin Lizzy name without Lynott being present, but the band only played hits from Thin Lizzy&#x27;s back catalogue, and did not compose any new material.

In 1997, Tommy Aldridge filled in on drums when Brian Downey was unable to, and became a full member when Downey left shortly thereafter. This line-up remained stable through to 2000, when the group recorded a live album, &quot;One Night Only&quot;. The band went on to tour the US playing clubs in early 2001, but Wharton had already left the band by the time of the tour. From 2000 to 2003, Mendoza toured with Ted Nugent, and with Whitesnake in 2004. Sykes released two solo albums during 2002–03, while Gorham worked with his band 21 Guns. Thin Lizzy performed sporadically during this period, recruiting some musicians for single tours, such as bass guitarist Guy Pratt for the Global Chaos Tour of 2003.

Wharton later stated that Thin Lizzy would have been better suited to playing fewer concerts, in bigger venues. He also felt that after the experience of fronting his own band Dare, it was not satisfying enough to play keyboards behind Gorham and Sykes. Sykes said that all the previous Thin Lizzy members were welcome to play with Thin Lizzy at any time.

In 2004, Thin Lizzy worked together again, with Sykes and Gorham bringing in ex-Angel bassist Randy Gregg, and drummer Michael Lee, who had played with Robert Plant and The Cult among others. They toured in North America in both the winter and then the summer as special guests of Deep Purple. This line-up proved temporary however, with Mendoza returning in 2005, and Aldridge returning in 2007. There were no plans for a new album though Thin Lizzy continued to tour. At the London Hammersmith Apollo concert of 13 December 2007, the line-up was Sykes, Gorham, Aldridge and Francesco DiCosmo on bass.

Sykes stated that Thin Lizzy was now &quot;more of a tribute thing&quot; and that it would be wrong to record new material under that name. He added that while the existing band members might record together, it would not be as Thin Lizzy. In 2007, Gorham said that Lynott still received the biggest cheer of the night at concerts, and that the current Thin Lizzy was not active simply for money. &quot;We&#x27;d stop if we thought we were just going through the motions... I think that has a lot to do with the songs – if they were inferior, then maybe we would have got tired of it all. But they&#x27;re not and we haven&#x27;t,&quot; he said. In January 2011, Gorham maintained that Lynott would have approved of the continuation of the band: &quot;He worked long hours and travelled thousands of miles to get it to a certain level. There&#x27;s no way he would have said &#x27;No-one should play those songs again.&#x27;&quot;

Thin Lizzy, along with support band The Answer, were to support AC/DC at stadium shows in England, Ireland and Scotland at the end of June 2009, but these appearances were cancelled after drummer Aldridge broke his collarbone in an accident. On 30 June, the band&#x27;s website confirmed that Sykes had left Thin Lizzy and all shows for the rest of 2009 were cancelled or postponed. Gorham stated that he would announce Thin Lizzy&#x27;s future plans shortly. In a statement, he said, &quot;It&#x27;s been a very tough time of late for myself and the band, firstly with drummer Tommy Aldridge&#x27;s injury and now the subsequent decision for John and the rest of the group to go their separate ways. I can only apologise to everyone who has supported us over the years, but we will be back up to full speed soon.&quot; Sykes died from cancer in January 2025 at the age of 65.

====2010–2021: Ricky Warwick era and Black Star Riders====
In September 2009, Gorham began to assemble a new version of Thin Lizzy, and in May 2010 a new line-up was announced. Joining Gorham was original drummer Brian Downey, long-standing keyboardist Darren Wharton, Def Leppard guitarist Vivian Campbell, and singer Ricky Warwick from The Almighty, while Marco Mendoza returned to fill the bass guitar role. Ex-Lizzy guitarist Brian Robertson was asked if he wanted to participate but had previous commitments to his own solo career.
In addition to a full UK and European tour beginning in January 2011, the band initially announced a concert for 4 January at the O2 Arena in Dublin, which was in conflict with the 2011 &quot;Vibe for Philo&quot;. The tour itself started on 6 January at the Music Hall Aberdeen in the UK, with the band finishing the tour in The Olympia, Dublin on 17 February 2011, having cancelled the O2 show.

In April 2011 the band announced that Vivian Campbell would be leaving Thin Lizzy amicably to rejoin Def Leppard after one final gig on 28 May. He was replaced by Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Richard Fortus. On 28 August, it was announced that Damon Johnson of Alice Cooper&#x27;s band would be replacing Fortus for Thin Lizzy&#x27;s tour of the US with Judas Priest. Fortus returned to tour with Guns N&#x27; Roses for the rest of the year, and Johnson has since replaced Fortus permanently.

In March 2011, Gorham told Billboard.com that Thin Lizzy may record a new album in the future, saying, &quot;That&#x27;s the No. 1 question we&#x27;re getting from people – are we gonna record some new material? The fans seem to trust this line-up, and I don&#x27;t blame them. We&#x27;ve kind of jumped this emotional hurdle together. Ricky&#x27;s writing some fucking killer lyrics, and with the kind of talent that&#x27;s in Thin Lizzy now I think we can pull off a really cool set of tunes. At least it&#x27;s something that we can think about now, where before it wasn&#x27;t on the table.&quot;

On 25 June 2012, Thin Lizzy were in the studio recording new material, although it was not clear how many songs would be recorded or released. On 10 October 2012, Thin Lizzy announced that the new material would not be released under the Thin Lizzy name, but would be released under a different name in due course. According to Gorham, this was &quot;out of respect to Phil Lynott and the legacy he created&quot;, though he confirmed that the new material would feature the classic Thin Lizzy sound. Ricky Warwick announced that the group would cease regular touring as Thin Lizzy at the end of 2012, but that this did not necessarily mean they would never play as Thin Lizzy again.

On 20 December 2012, Gorham revealed that the new material would be recorded under the name of Black Star Riders, and that Downey and Wharton had chosen not to participate in the new band project. Downey had decided to take a break from touring, and Wharton would be working on his own band Dare, and a film project. In March 2013, the band toured Australia under the Thin Lizzy name, with Downey and Wharton, as the opening act on a triple bill with Mötley Crüe and Kiss. Gorham stressed that Thin Lizzy would still perform together occasionally: &quot;We&#x27;ll still go out as Thin Lizzy. There are still certain big festivals that we will do. Thin Lizzy is still on the horizon, we will still go out and do that but in the meantime we have Black Star Riders that we are going to concentrate on also.&quot;

On 19 January 2016, the band revealed a &quot;half dozen or so&quot; dates in mid-2016 and early 2017 to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the release of &quot;Jailbreak&quot; and the 30th anniversary of Lynott&#x27;s death. Two festival dates were initially confirmed: the Ramblin&#x27; Man Fair in Maidstone, Kent on 23 July 2016 – at which Midge Ure once again joined them on stage – and the Rock Legends Cruise in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on 19–23 January 2017. The lineup for these shows was to be Gorham, Warwick, Johnson and Wharton with Motörhead drummer Mikkey Dee initially confirmed as standing in for Downey. Further dates were announced soon afterwards, at the Monsters of Rock shows in Germany on 17 and 18 June 2016, in Barcelona on 17 July, and the Skogsröjet Festival in Sweden on 6 August. On 19 April it was announced that Dee would not be participating after all, and that Judas Priest drummer Scott Travis would be taking Downey&#x27;s place for all shows except Sweden on 6 August, when Europe drummer Ian Haugland played. Also, Aerosmith bass guitarist Tom Hamilton was confirmed as Thin Lizzy&#x27;s bassist for these shows.

After the shows were completed, Gorham confirmed that extended Thin Lizzy tours were probably a thing of the past, but that the band would continue to perform in one-off events. He stated, &quot;To kill it off stone dead I think would be the wrong thing.&quot; Four further shows were announced for 2019 in the UK, Spain and Belgium. Troy Sanders of Mastodon was recruited to replace Hamilton on bass guitar for these shows.

In September 2021, Gorham left Black Star Riders as the band were planning a &quot;very heavy&quot; touring schedule to promote their upcoming fifth album. Warwick stated, &quot;He will be looking to put Thin Lizzy back out on the road from 2022 onwards with a busy schedule.&quot; Gorham made a statement complimenting the band and thanking the fans, and confirmed Warwick&#x27;s position in Thin Lizzy, adding, &quot;Regarding Thin Lizzy concerts in 2022 – this is currently in the planning stages and I will make sure to let you know of our progress regarding line-ups and dates.&quot; In late 2022, Gorham temporarily rejoined Black Star Riders&#x27; touring lineup and took part in a tenth anniversary tour of the UK in February 2023. Shortly before the tour began, Warwick spoke of Gorham&#x27;s intentions for Thin Lizzy: &quot;I know he&#x27;s working on some stuff for later in the year, so I&#x27;m sure when it&#x27;s all put in place I&#x27;ll get a call.&quot;

==Other Thin Lizzy releases and tributes==
A boxed set of four CDs of Thin Lizzy material was released in December 2001 as &quot;Vagabonds, Kings, Warriors, Angels&quot;. It contained all of the band&#x27;s major hits, and included some rare songs, such as the first single &quot;The Farmer&quot;, and single B-sides. In 2004 and 2006, two further greatest hits compilations were released, with 2004&#x27;s double CD &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; climbing to No. 3 in the UK album chart.

On 19 August 2005, Gary Moore staged a concert at the Point Theatre, Dublin, promoted as &quot;The Boy Is Back in Town&quot;. The concert was staged to mark the unveiling of a bronze statue of Lynott on Dublin&#x27;s Harry Street in the city centre. The performance also featured Brian Downey, Eric Bell, Brian Robertson and Scott Gorham, and included many classic Lizzy songs, such as &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot;, &quot;Still in Love With You&quot;, &quot;Cowboy Song&quot;, &quot;Emerald&quot; and &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot;. A DVD of the concert was released as &quot;One Night in Dublin: A Tribute to Phil Lynott&quot;.

On 8 September 2008, a 15-track album &quot;UK Tour &#x27;75&quot; was released featuring the band performing at Derby College on 21 November 1975. The album includes a 20-page booklet of previously-unseen photos, liner notes written by Brian Downey, and extra material of the band jamming during their soundcheck.

In March 2009, VH1 Classic Records issued the band-authorised &quot;Still Dangerous: Live At The Tower Theatre Philadelphia, 1977&quot;, a live CD recorded on the Bad Reputation tour. It was produced by Gorham and Glyn Johns, and Johns also mixed the record. It reached no. 98 in the UK chart. Gorham suggested there would be further archival releases in the future.

On 24 January 2011, Universal Music issued remastered and expanded editions of &quot;Jailbreak&quot;, &quot;Johnny the Fox&quot; and &quot;Live and Dangerous&quot;. &quot;Jailbreak&quot; and &quot;Johnny the Fox&quot; are double CD editions with the second disc containing outtakes, BBC session recordings and newly remixed versions of select album tracks. &quot;Live and Dangerous&quot; was a three-disc set, consisting of two CDs and a DVD. The former contains the original album plus two bonus tracks, recorded on the same tour and originally released on the &quot;Killers Live&quot; EP in 1981, while the DVD features a 1978 live performance from the Rainbow Theatre, recorded for television but never broadcast. Previous CD editions of &quot;Live and Dangerous&quot; were single discs. Universal followed that with remasters of &quot;Bad Reputation&quot;, &quot;Black Rose&quot; and &quot;Chinatown&quot;, and in early 2012, &quot;Nightlife&quot; and &quot;Fighting&quot;. Finally, &quot;Renegade&quot; and &quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot; were remastered and re-released in 2013.

On 27 September 2024, a six-disc box set including a Blu-ray disc was released featuring expanded versions of &quot;Jailbreak&quot; and &quot;Johnny the Fox&quot;. Titled &quot;1976&quot;, the set includes original and remixed versions of both albums, two discs of outtakes and radio sessions, plus a live show recorded at The Agora in Cleveland on 5 November 1976. The Blu-ray disc also features the original and remixed albums. &quot;1976&quot; charted at number 58 on the Official UK Album Chart Update.

On 24 January 2025, an album of Eric Bell-era songs is to be released on the Decca label, featuring Lynott&#x27;s original vocals, Downey&#x27;s drums, and new acoustic guitar parts by Bell. &quot;Acoustic Sessions&quot; contains ten songs including &quot;Slow Blues G.M.&quot;, a tribute to Gary Moore. A single, &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot;, was previewed on Planet Rock Radio.

==Style and legacy==

Lynott became known for his aggressive, rhythmic approach to bass playing, using an attacking style with a pick to strum eighth notes or triplets. As a lyricist, Lynott drew from his personal experiences growing up in Dublin and from Celtic literature. His songs featured a variety of themes and characters, from working-class stories to tales from Celtic culture. Lynott&#x27;s style of singing also set him apart from other hard rock musicians of the day, utilizing a seemingly casual sense of off-the-beat phrasing &quot;closer to folk or jazz.&quot;

From 1974, Thin Lizzy switched from using one lead guitarist to two. This twin lead guitar style was later refined and popularised in the mid-1970s by bands like Judas Priest, and later by the emerging new wave of British heavy metal groups such as Iron Maiden and Def Leppard. Iron Maiden covered the song &quot;Massacre&quot; from Thin Lizzy&#x27;s &quot;Johnny the Fox&quot; album, and released it on their 1988 single &quot;Can I Play with Madness&quot;. A cover of &quot;Cowboy Song&quot; appears on &quot;Sound of White Noise&quot; (1993) by Anthrax as a bonus track on the album&#x27;s Japanese and Australian releases, and as a B-side on some singles of &quot;Only&quot; and &quot;Black Lodge&quot;.

Thin Lizzy are also a major inspiration for modern heavy metal bands such as Metallica,
Alice in Chains, Mastodon and Testament. Metallica have covered &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot; multiple times in honour of their former bassist Cliff Burton, who died in a bus accident in 1986. Thin Lizzy were one of Burton&#x27;s favourite bands, and Lynott had a major influence on him as a bass player. In 2004, Robert Smith, lead singer of The Cure, commented that he had seen Thin Lizzy &quot;probably 10 times over two years&quot;, and that &quot;the actual sound of them live was so empowering, it was better than drinking.&quot;
Alternative rock group The Hold Steady have also cited Thin Lizzy as an influence. Thin Lizzy are referred to in Belle and Sebastian&#x27;s 2003 song &quot;I&#x27;m a Cuckoo&quot;.

Guns N&#x27; Roses cited the band as an influence. Lead singer Axl Rose was a fan of the band, and the tattoo that inspired the skull cross cover of &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; was a reference to Thin Lizzy.

<text>Chi ( , also ; uppercase Χ, lowercase χ; ) is the twenty-second letter of the Greek alphabet.

==Greek==
===Pronunciation===
====Ancient Greek====
Its value in Ancient Greek was an aspirated velar stop (in the Western Greek alphabet: /ks/).

====Koine Greek====
In Koine Greek and later dialects it became a fricative (/) along with Θ and Φ.

====Modern Greek====
In Modern Greek, it has two distinct pronunciations: In front of high or front vowels ( or ) it is pronounced as a voiceless palatal fricative , as in German &quot;ich&quot; or like some pronunciations of &quot;h&quot; in English words like &quot;hew&quot; and &quot;human&quot;. In front of low or back vowels (, or ) and consonants, it is pronounced as a voiceless velar fricative (), as in German &quot;ach&quot; or Spanish &quot;j&quot;. This distinction corresponds to the ich-Laut and ach-Laut of German.

===Transliteration===
Chi is romanized as in most systematic transliteration conventions, but sometimes is used. In addition, in Modern Greek, it is often also romanized as or in informal practice.

===Greek numeral===
In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 600.

===Xi===
In ancient times, some local forms of the Greek alphabet used the chi instead of xi to represent the /ks/ sound. This was borrowed into the early Latin language, which led to the use of the letter X for the same sound in Latin, and many modern languages that use the Latin alphabet.

==Cyrillic==
Chi was also included in the Cyrillic script as the letter Х, with the phonetic value /x/ or /h/.

==International Phonetic Alphabet==
In the International Phonetic Alphabet, represents a voiceless uvular fricative.

==Chiasmus==
Chi is the basis for the name literary chiastic structure and the name of chiasmus.

==Symbolism==
In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot;, it is explained that the two bands that form the soul of the world cross each other like the letter Χ. Plato&#x27;s analogy, along with several other examples of &quot;chi&quot; as a symbol occur in Thomas Browne&#x27;s discourse &quot;The Garden of Cyrus&quot; (1658).

Chi or X is often used to abbreviate the name Christ, as in the holiday Christmas (Xmas). When fused within a single typeface with the Greek letter rho, it is called the Chi Rho and used to represent the person of Jesus Christ. 

==Math and science==

* In statistics, the term chi-squared or formula_1 has various uses, including the chi-squared distribution, the chi-squared test, and chi-squared target model
* In algebraic topology, Chi is used to represent the Euler characteristic of a surface.
* The chromatic number of a graph in graph theory
* In neuroanatomy, crossings of peripheral nerves (such as the optic chiasm) are named for the letter Chi because of its Χ-shape.
* In chemistry, the mole fraction and electronegativity may be denoted by the lowercase formula_2.
* In physics, formula_2 denotes electric or magnetic susceptibility.
* In rhetoric, both chiastic structure (a literary device) and the figure of speech Chiasmus derive from their names from the shape of the letter Chi.
* In mechanical engineering, chi is used as a symbol for the reduction factor of relevant buckling loads in the EN 1993, a European Standard for the design of steel structures.
* In analytic number theory, chi is used for the Dirichlet character.

<text>Phi (; uppercase Φ, lowercase φ or ϕ; &quot;pheî&quot; ; Modern Greek: &quot;fi&quot; ) is the twenty-first letter of the Greek alphabet.

In Archaic and Classical Greek (c. 9th to 4th century BC), it represented an aspirated voiceless bilabial plosive (), which was the origin of its usual romanization as . During the later part of Classical Antiquity, in Koine Greek (c. 4th century BC to 4th century AD), its pronunciation shifted to a voiceless bilabial fricative (), and by the Byzantine Greek period (c. 4th century AD to 15th century AD) it developed its modern pronunciation as a voiceless labiodental fricative ().
The romanization of the Modern Greek phoneme is therefore usually .

It may be that phi originated as the letter qoppa (Ϙ, ϙ), and initially represented the sound before shifting to Classical Greek . In traditional Greek numerals, phi has a value of 500 () or 500,000 (). The Cyrillic letter Ef (Ф, ф) descends from phi.

Like other Greek letters, lowercase phi (encoded as the Unicode character ) is used as a mathematical or scientific symbol. Some uses require the old-fashioned &#x27;closed&#x27; glyph, which is separately encoded as the Unicode character .

== Use as a symbol ==
=== In lowercase ===
The lowercase letter φ (or its variant, ϕ or ɸ) is often used to represent the following:
* The letter phi is commonly used in physics to represent wave functions in quantum mechanics, such as in the Schrödinger equation and bra–ket notation: formula_1.
* The golden ratio formula_2 ... in mathematics, art, and architecture. (Its reciprocal, 1/φ, is formula_3 and is equal to φ - 1.)
* Euler&#x27;s totient function &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) in number theory; also called &quot;Euler&#x27;s phi function&quot;.
* The cyclotomic polynomial functions Φ&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) of algebra.
* The number of electrical phases in a power system in electrical engineering, for example 1ϕ for single phase, 3ϕ for three phase.
* In algebra, group or ring homomorphisms
* In probability theory, formula_4 is the probability density function of the standard normal distribution.
* In probability theory, is the characteristic function of a random variable &quot;X&quot;.
* An angle, typically the second angle mentioned, after &quot;θ&quot; (theta). It can denote:
** The argument of a complex number.
** The phase of a wave in signal processing.
** In spherical coordinates, mathematicians usually refer to ϕ as the polar angle (from the &quot;z&quot;-axis). The convention in physics is to use ϕ as the azimuthal angle (from the &quot;x&quot;-axis).
** One of the dihedral angles in the backbones of proteins in a Ramachandran plot
** Internal or effective angle of friction.
** In cartography and navigation, ɸ denotes latitude; likewise, in geodesy it denotes geodetic latitude.
** In aircraft flight mechanics as the symbol for bank angle (sometimes represented with the letter theta, which is also used for pitch angle).
* The work function of a surface, in solid-state physics.
* A shorthand representation for an aromatic functional group in organic chemistry.
* The fugacity coefficient in thermodynamics.
* The ratio of free energy destabilizations of protein mutants in phi value analysis.
* In combustion engineering, fuel–air equivalence ratio. The ratio between the actual fuel-air ratio to the stoichiometric fuel-air ratio.
* In granulometry, sedimentology, and soil engineering, φ is a logarithmic unit of sediment grain size, defined such that a change of 1 φ in grain size corresponds to a factor of 2 in grain diameter.
* A sentence in first-order logic.
* The Veblen function in set theory.
* Porosity in geology and hydrology.
* Strength (or resistance) reduction factor in structural engineering, used to account for statistical variabilities in materials and construction methods.
* The symbol for a voiceless bilabial fricative in the International Phonetic Alphabet (using the form ɸ).
* In philosophy, φ is often used as shorthand for a generic act. (Also in uppercase.)
* In perceptual psychology, the phi phenomenon is the apparent motion caused by the successive viewing of stationary objects, such as the frames of a motion picture.
* In linguistics, φ-features denote features such as case, number and gender in which adjectives and pronouns agree with nouns.
* In lexical-functional grammar, the function that maps elements from the c-structure to the f-structure.
* In ecology, site survival probability, or the probability that a species will continue to occupy a site if it was there the previous year.
* The logo of La France Insoumise, a leftist French political party.
* An abbreviation for the word bacteriophage
** Mϕ is used as an abbreviation for the word macrophage

=== In uppercase ===
The uppercase Φ is used as a symbol for:
* The golden ratio conjugate −0.618... in mathematics.
* The cumulative distribution function (cdf) of standard normal distribution in statistics.
* The magnetic flux and electric flux in physics, with subscripts distinguishing the two.
* Quantum yield, the number of times a specific event occurs per photon absorbed by a system.
* In philosophy, Φ is often used as shorthand for a generic act. (Also in lowercase.)
* A common symbol for the parametrization of a surface in vector calculus.
* In Lacanian algebra, Φ stands for the imaginary phallus and also represents phallic signification; −Φ stands in for castration.
* The diameter symbol in engineering, ⌀, is often erroneously referred to as &quot;phi&quot;, and the diameter symbol is sometimes erroneously typeset as Φ. This symbol is used to indicate the diameter of a circular section; for example, &quot;⌀14&quot; means the diameter of the circle is 14 units.
* A clock signal in electronics is often called Phi or uses the symbol.
* In emulsion and suspension science, Φ often denotes the volume fraction of the dispersed phase.
* Archaically used in chemistry for phenyl group.

== Unicode ==
In Unicode, there are multiple forms of the phi letter:
In ordinary Greek text, the character U+03C6 φ is used exclusively, though this character has considerable glyphic variation, sometimes represented with a glyph more like the representative glyph shown for U+03C6 (φ, the &quot;loopy&quot; or &quot;open&quot; form), and less often with a glyph more like the representative glyph shown for U+03D5 (ϕ, the &quot;stroked&quot; or &quot;closed&quot; form).

Because Unicode represents a character in an abstract way, the choice between glyphs is purely a matter of font design. While some Greek typefaces, most notably those in the Porson family (used widely in editions of classical Greek texts), have a &quot;stroked&quot; glyph in this position (), most other typefaces have &quot;loopy&quot; glyphs. This also applies to the &quot;Didot&quot; (or &quot;apla&quot;) typefaces employed in most Greek book printing (), as well as the &quot;Neohellenic&quot; typeface often used for ancient texts ().

It is necessary to have the stroked glyph available for some mathematical uses, and U+03D5 GREEK PHI SYMBOL is designed for this function. Prior to Unicode version 3.0 (1998), the glyph assignments in the Unicode code charts were the reverse, and thus older fonts may still show a loopy form formula_5 at U+03D5.

For use as a phonetic symbol in IPA, Unicode has a separate code point U+0278, LATIN SMALL LETTER PHI, because only the stroked glyph is considered correct in this use. It typically appears in a form adapted to a Latin typographic environment, with a more upright shape than normal Greek letters and with serifs at the top and bottom.

In LaTeX, the math symbols are codice_1 (formula_6), codice_2 (formula_7), and codice_3 (formula_8).

The Unicode standard includes the following variants of phi and phi-like characters:

<text>Upsilon (, ; uppercase Υ, lowercase υ; &quot;ýpsilon&quot; ) or ypsilon is the twentieth letter of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals, has a value of 400. It is derived from the Phoenician waw .

==Etymology==
The name of the letter was originally just &quot;υ&quot; (&quot;y;&quot; also called &quot;hy&quot;, hence &quot;hyoid&quot;, meaning &quot;shaped like the letter υ&quot;), but the name changed to &quot;υ ψιλόν&quot; (=&quot;υ psilon&quot;, &#x27;u-plain&#x27; or &#x27;u-simple&#x27;) to distinguish it from οι, which had come to have the same pronunciation.

==Pronunciation==
In early Attic Greek (6th century BCE), it was pronounced (a close back rounded vowel like the English &quot;long o͞o&quot;). In Classical Greek, it was pronounced (a close front rounded vowel), at least until 1030. In Modern Greek, it is pronounced ; in the digraphs and , as or ; and in the digraph as . In ancient Greek, it occurred in both long and short versions, but Modern Greek does not have a length distinction.

As an initial letter in Classical Greek, it always carried the rough breathing (equivalent to &quot;h&quot;) as reflected in the many Greek-derived English words, such as those that begin with &quot;hyper-&quot; and &quot;hypo-&quot;. This rough breathing was derived from an older pronunciation that used a sibilant instead; this sibilant was not lost in Latin, giving rise to such cognates as &quot;super-&quot; (for &quot;hyper-&quot;) and &quot;sub-&quot; (for &quot;hypo-&quot;).

Upsilon participated as the second element in falling diphthongs, which have subsequently developed in various ways.

==Correspondence with Latin Y==
The usage of Y in Latin dates back to the first century BC. It was used to transcribe loanwords from Greek, so it was not a native sound of Latin and was usually pronounced or . The latter pronunciation was the most common in the Classical period and was used mostly by uneducated people. The Roman Emperor Claudius proposed introducing a new letter into the Latin alphabet to transcribe the so-called &quot;sonus medius&quot; (a short vowel before labial consonants), but in inscriptions, the new letter was sometimes used for Greek upsilon instead.

Four letters of the Latin alphabet arose from it: and U, Y and, much later, V and W. In the Cyrillic script, the letters U (У, у) and izhitsa (Ѵ, ѵ) arose from it.

In some languages, including German and Portuguese, the name &quot;upsilon&quot; (&quot;Ypsilon&quot; in German, &quot;ípsilon&quot; in Portuguese) is used to refer to the Latin letter Y as well as the Greek letter. In some other languages, the (Latin) Y is referred to as a &quot;Greek I&quot; (&quot;i griega&quot; in Spanish, &quot;i grec&quot; in French), also noting its Greek origin.

== Usage ==
* In particle physics the capital Greek letter ϒ denotes an Upsilon particle. Note that the symbol should always look like formula_1 in order to avoid confusion with a Latin Y denoting the hypercharge. This may be done either with a font such as FreeSerif or with the dedicated Unicode character U+03D2 ϒ.
* Automobile manufacturer Lancia has a model called the Ypsilon.
* In the International Phonetic Alphabet, the symbol is used to represent a labiodental approximant.
* In astrophysics and physical cosmology, ϒ refers to the mass-to-light ratio.
* In statistics, it is sometimes used instead of v or nu to indicate degrees of freedom.
* In the Persian language, “one Upsilon” is used to describe a positive amount close to 0 (zero).

===Similar appearance===
* A similar symbol (Unicode ♈ U+2648) is used for the astrological sign of Aries.

==Symbolism==

Upsilon is known as Pythagoras&#x27; letter, or the Samian letter, because Pythagoras used it as an emblem of the path of virtue or vice. As the Roman writer Persius wrote in &quot;Satire III&quot;:

Lactantius, an early Christian author (ca. 240 – ca. 320), refers to this:

<doc id="166710" wikidata="Q14415" url="?curid=166710" title="Tau">
<text>Tau (; uppercase Τ, lowercase τ or formula_1; ) is the nineteenth letter of the Greek alphabet, representing the voiceless dental or alveolar plosive . In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 300.

The name in English is pronounced or , but in Greek it is . This is because the pronunciation of the combination of Greek letters αυ can have the pronunciation of either , or , depending on what follows and if a diaeresis is present on the second vowel (see Greek orthography).

Tau was derived from the Phoenician letter taw (𐤕). Letters that arose from tau include Roman T and Cyrillic Te (Т, т).

== Modern usage ==
The lower-case letter τ is used as a symbol for:
* Specific tax amount

=== Biology ===
* The expressed period of the freerunning rhythm of an animal, i.e., the length of the daily cycle of an animal when kept in constant light or constant darkness
* The dose interval in pharmacokinetics
* The core variable in general tau theory
* Tau in biochemistry, a protein associated with microtubules and implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, some forms of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy

=== Mathematics ===
* Divisor function in number theory, also denoted &quot;d&quot; or σ0
* Ramanujan tau function
* Golden ratio (1.618...), although φ (phi) is more common
* Kendall tau rank correlation coefficient in statistics
* Stopping time in stochastic processes.
* Tau, the ratio of the circumference to the radius of a circle, which is equal to 2 (6.28318...)
* Tau functions, several
* Torsion of a curve in differential geometry
* Translation in Euclidean geometry (although the Latin letter T is used more often)
* The Prouhet–Thue–Morse constant

=== Physics ===
* Proper time in relativity
* Shear stress in continuum mechanics
* The lifetime of a spontaneous emission process
* Tau, an elementary particle in particle physics
* Tau in astronomy is a measure of optical depth, or how much sunlight cannot penetrate the atmosphere
* In the physical sciences, tau is sometimes used as time variable, to avoid confusing t as temperature
* Time constant (also relaxation time) of any system, such as an RC circuit
* Torque, the rotational force in mechanics
* The symbol for tortuosity in hydrogeology
* In thermal physics, the symbol for the fundamental temperature formula_2

== Symbolism ==
* In ancient times, tau was used as a symbol for life or resurrection, whereas the eighth letter of the Greek alphabet, theta, was considered the symbol of death.
* In Biblical times, the taw was put on men to distinguish those who lamented sin, although newer versions of the Bible have replaced the ancient term &quot;taw&quot; with &quot;mark&quot; (Ezekiel 9:4) or &quot;signature&quot; (Job 31:35). Its original sound value is a voiceless alveolar plosive, IPA /t/
* The symbolism of the cross was connected not only to the letter chi but also to tau, the equivalent of the last letter in the Phoenician and Old Hebrew alphabets, and which was originally cruciform in shape; see Cross of Tau.
* An essay written around 160 AD, attributed to Lucian, a mock legal prosecution called &quot;The Consonants at Law - Sigma vs. Tau, in the Court of the Seven Vowels&quot;, contains a reference to the cross attribution. Sigma petitions the court to sentence Tau to death by crucifixion, saying:
*: &quot;Men weep, and bewail their lot, and curse Cadmus with many curses for introducing &quot;Tau&quot; into the family of letters; they say it was his body that tyrants took for a model, his shape that they imitated, when they set up structures on which men are crucified. &quot;Stauros&quot; (cross) the vile engine is called, and it derives its vile name from him. Now, with all these crimes upon him, does he not deserve death, nay, many deaths? For my part I know none bad enough but that supplied by his own shape — that shape which he gave to the gibbet named &quot;stauros&quot; after him by men&quot;
* Tau is usually considered as the symbol of Franciscan orders due to St. Francis&#x27; love for it, symbol of the redemption and of the Cross. Almost all Franciscan churches have painted a tau with two crossing arms, both with stigmata, the one of Jesus and the other of Francis; members of the Secular Franciscan Order usually wear a wooden τ in a string with three knots around the neck

<text>Meet the Press is a weekly American television Sunday morning talk show broadcast on NBC. It is the longest-running program on American television, though its format has changed since the debut episode on November 6, 1947. &quot;Meet the Press&quot; specializes in interviews with leaders in Washington, D.C., across the country, and around the world on issues of politics, economics, foreign policy, and other public affairs, along with panel discussions that provide opinions and analysis. In January 2021, production moved to NBC&#x27;s bureau on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.

The longevity of &quot;Meet the Press&quot; is attributable in part to the fact that the program debuted during what was only the second official &quot;network television season&quot; for American television. It was the first live television network news program on which a sitting president of the United States appeared, this occurred on its broadcast on November 9, 1975, which featured Gerald Ford. The program has been hosted by 12 moderators, beginning with creator Martha Rountree. The show&#x27;s current moderator is Kristen Welker, who became moderator in September 2023 following longtime moderator Chuck Todd’s departure.

&quot;Meet the Press&quot; airs Sundays from 9:00 a.m.–10:00 a.m. ET on the NBC-TV network, 10:30 a.m.–11:30 a.m. ET in New York and Washington. The program also re-airs at 2:00 p.m. ET Sundays and 2:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. ET Mondays on MSNBC on cable. &quot;Meet the Press&quot; is also occasionally pre-empted by network coverage of sports events held outside the U.S. The program is also rebroadcast on Mondays at 2:30 a.m. Eastern Time on MSNBC, whose audio feed is also simulcast on Sirius/XM Satellite Radio. The program is syndicated by Westwood One to various radio stations around the United States, and is on C-SPAN Radio as part of its replays of the Sunday morning talk shows.

==Format==
The program&#x27;s format consists of an extended one-on-one interview with the host, and is sometimes followed by a roundtable discussion or one-on-two interview with figures in adversarial positions, either Congressional members from opposite sides of the aisle or political commentators. A half-hour program for the first 45 years of its history, the show was expanded to 60 minutes starting with the broadcast on September 20, 1992.

The program also features in-depth examinations of facts behind political and general news stories (particularly as part of a segment called the &quot;Data Download,&quot; introduced after Chuck Todd assumed duties as moderator, which is conducted on a touchscreen within the main set).

==History==


&quot;Meet the Press&quot; began on radio on the Mutual Broadcasting System in 1945 as &quot;American Mercury Presents: Meet the Press&quot;, a program to promote &quot;The American Mercury&quot;, a magazine that Lawrence Spivak purchased in 1935. Before the program aired, Spivak had asked journalist Martha Rountree, who had worked in radio and had been employed by Spivak as a roving editor for the magazine, to critique plans for a new radio show. As a result, Rountree created a new radio program that she called &quot;The American Mercury&quot;, on October 5, 1945.

On November 6, 1947, while still on the Mutual Broadcasting System, the television rights to the program were purchased by General Foods. They began to air the show on the NBC television network with the title shortened to simply &quot;Meet the Press&quot;. The radio version then adopted the new name.

Although some sources credit Spivak with the program&#x27;s creation, Rountree developed the idea on her own, and Spivak joined as co-producer and business partner in the enterprise after the show had already debuted.
&quot;Meet the Press&quot; was originally presented as a 30-minute press conference with a single guest and a panel of questioners. Its first guest was James Farley, who served as Postmaster General, Democratic National Committee chairman and campaign manager to Franklin Delano Roosevelt under the first two terms of the New Deal Administration. Martha Rountree served as its first host, the program&#x27;s only female moderator until 2023. She stepped down on November 1, 1953, and was succeeded by Ned Brooks, who remained as moderator until his retirement on December 26, 1965. Spivak became the moderator on January 1, 1966, moving up from his role as a permanent panelist. He retired on November 9, 1975, on a special one-hour edition that featured a sitting president as guest for the first time, in this case Gerald Ford. The next week, Bill Monroe, previously a weekly panelist like Spivak had been years before, took over as moderator and stayed until June 2, 1984.

For the next seven and a half years, the program then went through a series of hosts as it struggled in the ratings against ABC&#x27;s &quot;This Week with David Brinkley&quot;. Roger Mudd and Marvin Kalb, as co-moderators, followed Monroe for a year, followed by Chris Wallace (who would later go on to a much longer run as host of the rival program &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot;) from 1987 to 1988. Garrick Utley, then hosting &quot;Weekend Today&quot;, concurrently hosted &quot;Meet the Press&quot; from 1989 through December 1, 1991. All this occurred despite the increasing ratings of NBC News&#x27; other programs (and those of the network generally) during that period. The program originally aired at noon Eastern Time every Sunday (leading into &quot;NFL Live&quot; incongruously in the fall) before moving to a 9:00 a.m. slot by the early 1990s when it expanded to an hour.

===Under Russert===
Network officials, concerned for the show&#x27;s future, turned to Tim Russert, the network&#x27;s bureau chief in Washington, D.C. He took over as moderator of &quot;Meet the Press&quot; on December 8, 1991, and remained with the program until his death on June 13, 2008, becoming the longest-serving moderator in the program&#x27;s history.

Under Russert, the program was expanded to one hour and became less of a televised press conference, focusing more on Russert&#x27;s questions and comments, Russert also engaged in longer in-depth interviews and hosted panels of experts to discuss the topics featured in that week&#x27;s broadcast. Russert signed off each edition by saying, &quot;That&#x27;s all for today. We&#x27;ll be back next week. If it&#x27;s Sunday, it&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot;.&quot;

During the professional football season, Russert, a native of Buffalo, New York, and an avid fan of the Buffalo Bills, sometimes added, &quot;Go Bills!,&quot; and occasionally would ask panelists, &quot;How &#x27;bout those Sabres?&quot; if Buffalo&#x27;s NHL hockey team was doing well. Spoofs of the show featured in a recurring sketch on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; often reflected his impromptu additions in support of the two professional sports franchises. By 2006, &quot;Meet the Press&quot; was the highest-rated program among the Sunday morning talk shows.

On June 13, 2008, Russert died of a sudden coronary thrombosis (caused by a cholesterol plaque rupture). Former &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; anchor Tom Brokaw hosted a special edition of &quot;Meet the Press&quot; dedicated to the life of Russert on June 15, 2008, in which Russert&#x27;s chair was left empty as a tribute.

===After Russert===
Mark Whitaker was named by NBC News as the division&#x27;s Washington, D.C. Bureau Chief and was given &quot;executive oversight&quot; of &quot;Meet the Press&quot;.

====Interim Brokaw era====
&quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; anchor Brian Williams acted as moderator of the first show following the tribute to Russert on June 15, 2008, with the same guests and subject matter that Russert was planning for when he died.

Following Russert&#x27;s death, Tom Brokaw was named the interim moderator through the 2008 general elections. Brokaw followed Russert&#x27;s tradition by signing off with &quot;We&#x27;ll be back next Sunday because if it&#x27;s Sunday, it&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot;&quot; (a sign-off that continues to be used by his successors as moderator). In September of that year, the show was presented with limited commercial interruption.

On August 10, 2008, David Gregory moderated the panel discussion during the second half-hour of the broadcast, while Brokaw anchored the first half-hour from the site of the Summer Olympics in Beijing. The following week on August 17, 2008, he moderated the entire broadcast. On December 1, 2008, it was also reported that the December 7, 2008 broadcast would be Brokaw&#x27;s last, with Gregory becoming the new permanent host the following Sunday.

===Under Gregory===
David Gregory began his tenure as moderator on December 14, 2008. Four days after Gregory&#x27;s first regular broadcast, on December 18, 2008, NBC News political director Chuck Todd was named contributing editor of &quot;Meet the Press&quot;. Throughout Gregory&#x27;s tenure as moderator, &quot;Meet the Press&quot; experienced significant ratings declines. In the final three months of 2013, the program placed third among the Sunday morning talk shows in total viewership, behind CBS&#x27;s &quot;Face the Nation&quot; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;This Week&quot;, for the first time since 1992. It also experienced the lowest ratings in the show&#x27;s entire history among the key 25-to-54 age viewing demographic during this period. NBC management became uncertain as to the future direction of the program.

A new set was introduced on May 2, 2010, featuring video screens and library-style bookshelves, Gregory would preview the guests to be featured during each week&#x27;s broadcast using a large video screen. Different, modified intro music was also introduced, with the &quot;Meet the Press&quot; theme music in a shorter &quot;modernized [style]... the beginning repeated with drum beats&quot; (see &quot;High-definition broadcasting&quot; below for additional information).

===Under Todd===


In response to declining viewership, rumors surfaced in August 2014 that Gregory would be replaced as the program&#x27;s moderator. NBC News President Deborah Turness apparently had held discussions with Jon Stewart (then-host of Comedy Central&#x27;s news comedy program &quot;The Daily Show&quot;) to replace Gregory, which Stewart later confirmed in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, saying, &quot;My guess is they were casting as wide and as weird a net as they could. I&#x27;m sure part of them was thinking, &#x27;Why don&#x27;t we just make it a variety show?

On August 14, 2014, Turness announced that Chuck Todd, NBC&#x27;s chief White House correspondent and Host of MSNBC&#x27;s The Daily Rundown, would take over the role of moderator on September 7, 2014. Because of Todd&#x27;s fanhood, a Los Angeles Dodgers poster became part of the physical format.

====&quot;Meet the Press Now&quot;====
On September 28, 2015, MSNBC premiered MTP Daily, a weekday spin-off also hosted by Todd. It formally replaced &quot;The Ed Show&quot; as MSNBC&#x27;s early-evening program after a transitional period following its cancellation. MSNBC explained that the program is meant to &quot;bring the insight and power of &quot;Meet the Press&quot; to our air every day of the week.” By 2022, the show was airing in the 1:00 p.m. Eastern slot, and in May it was announced that the show would be moving from MSNBC to the free streaming platform NBC News NOW, and rechristened Meet the Press Now, starting June 6, 2022. The show also returned to an early evening slot of 4:00 p.m. Eastern.

====Disinformation overtaking media====
In a December 2019 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Todd discussed how disinformation overtook the media during the Trump administration. However, PressThink, a project of the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute at New York University, took Todd to task for failing to address the issue as it unfolded, in a very detailed discussion of Todd&#x27;s remarks.

=== Under Welker ===
On June 4, 2023, Todd announced he would be leaving his role as moderator. Kristen Welker was named as his replacement for the flagship &quot;Meet the Press&quot; beginning in September, while spin off &quot;Meet the Press Now&quot; featured rotating guest hosts, with Welker only hosting &quot;Meet The Press Now&quot; on Thursdays and Fridays. In June 2024, Welker took a month leave of absence because she had given birth to second child on May 30, Peter Alexander filled in for Welker during her absence.

===High-definition broadcasting===
The set utilized from March 17, 1996 to April 25, 2010, had been designed as an experimental set for high-definition broadcasting, several editions of the program (including the first broadcast of a regular series on a major television network in HD) had aired in the format in the 1990s over experimental HD station WHD-TV in Washington, D.C. Despite this, the program continued to be transmitted in NTSC over the NBC network itself. On May 2, 2010, &quot;Meet the Press&quot; became the last NBC News program to convert to high definition, and unveiled a new set consisting of large video screens mostly used to display Washington scenery, satellite interview subjects and moderator and subject talking points, along with graphics produced for the format.

In January 2021, production of the program moved from WRC-TV facilities in Tenleytown to a ground floor studio in NBC&#x27;s new Washington, D.C. bureau on Capitol Hill. The move included a new set.

<text>Uriah Heep are an English rock band formed in London in 1969. Their current lineup consists of guitarist Mick Box, keyboardist Phil Lanzon, lead vocalist Bernie Shaw, drummer Russell Gilbrook, and bassist Dave Rimmer. They have experienced numerous lineup changes throughout their -year career, leaving Box as the only remaining original member. Former members of the band are vocalists David Byron, John Lawton, John Sloman and Peter Goalby; bassists Paul Newton, Mark Clarke, Gary Thain, John Wetton, Trevor Bolder and Bob Daisley; drummers Alex Napier, Nigel Olsson, Keith Baker, Iain Clark, Lee Kerslake and Chris Slade; and keyboardists Ken Hensley, Gregg Dechert and John Sinclair.

Uriah Heep were part of the early 1970s rock scene and have been referred to as major pioneers of the hard rock, heavy metal and progressive rock genres. The band have sold over 40 million albums worldwide, with over 4 million sales in the US, where their best-known songs include &quot;Lady In Black&quot;, &quot;Gypsy&quot;, &quot;Easy Livin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;The Wizard&quot;, &quot;Sweet Lorraine&quot; and &quot;Stealin&#x27;&quot;. They also maintain a significant following and perform at arena-sized venues in the Balkans, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Russia and Scandinavia.

Uriah Heep have released twenty-five studio albums of original material, twenty live albums and forty-one compilation albums (including two greatest hits albums). Thirteen of the band&#x27;s studio albums have made it to the UK Albums Chart (&quot;Return to Fantasy&quot; reached No. 7 in 1975), while of the fifteen &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Uriah Heep albums, &quot;Demons and Wizards&quot; was the most successful (No. 23, 1972). In the late 1970s the band had massive success in Germany, where the &quot;Lady in Black&quot; single was a big hit.

==History==

===Early days (1967–1971)===
The band&#x27;s origins go back to 1967 when 19-year-old guitarist Mick Box formed a band in Brentwood, Essex called Hogwash, which began playing in local clubs and pubs. When the band&#x27;s singer left, drummer Roger Penlington suggested his cousin David Garrick (who knew the band) as a replacement. Box and Garrick formed a songwriting partnership and having higher musical aspirations than their colleagues, decided to give up their day jobs and go professional. They set up a new band called Spice. David Garrick changed his surname to Byron. Drummer Alex Napier joined, having answered a music paper ad; bassist Paul Newton of The Gods completed the line-up.

Spice avoided playing covers and according to Box, always strove &quot;to do something original&quot;. Managed initially by Newton&#x27;s father, the band climbed their way up to The Marquee level, then got signed by Gerry Bron (the Hit Record Productions Ltd.&#x27;s boss), who saw the band at the Blues Loft club in High Wycombe. &quot;I thought they were a band I could develop and I took them on that basis&quot;, remembered Bron later. He became the band&#x27;s manager and signed them to Vertigo Records, the newly formed Philips label. The four-piece found themselves booked into the Lansdowne Studios in London, still under the name of Spice. Then the name was changed to that of the well-known character from &quot;David Copperfield&quot; Uriah Heep (for, according to biographer Kirk Blows, &quot;Dickens&#x27; name being everywhere around Christmas &#x27;69 due to it being the hundredth anniversary of his death&quot;). According to Dave Ling&#x27;s 2001 autobiography of the band, &quot;Wizards and Demons, The Uriah Heep Story&quot;, though the &quot;Uriah Heep&quot; moniker was chosen in December 1969, the band continued to play gigs as &quot;Spice&quot; until Ken Hensley joined in February 1970. Uriah Heep then decided to widen the sound. &quot;We&#x27;d actually recorded half the first album when we decided that keyboards would be good for our sound. I was a big Vanilla Fudge fan, with their Hammond organ and searing guitar on top and we had David&#x27;s high vibrato vocals anyway so that&#x27;s how we decided to shape it&quot;, Box recalled. Gerry Bron brought in session player Colin Wood, followed by Hensley, a former colleague of Newton in the Gods, who was then playing guitar in Toe Fat. &quot;I saw a lot of potential in the group to do something very different&quot;, remembered Hensley.

Their 1970 debut album, &quot;…Very &#x27;Eavy …Very &#x27;Umble&quot; (released as &quot;Uriah Heep&quot; in the United States), introduced Hensley&#x27;s heavy organ and the band&#x27;s guitar-driven sound, with David Byron&#x27;s theatrical, dynamic vocals soaring above thunderous sonic backgrounds, although acoustic and jazz elements also featured in the mix. The album&#x27;s title references the signature phrase of the Dickens character (&quot;very &#x27;umble&quot;). Hensley had little to contribute to the debut: Box and Byron wrote most of the material, including &quot;Gypsy&quot;, in many ways (according to Blows) &quot;a marriage of contrasts&quot; that, in time, became their trademark. In a 1989 interview, Mick Box recalled: &quot;The funny thing was we wrote it at the Hanwell Community Centre and Deep Purple were rehearsing in the room next door to us. You can imagine the kind of racket we were both making between us.&quot; During the winter of 1970, three-quarters into the recording of the album, drummer Alex Napier was replaced by Nigel Olsson, recommended to Byron by Elton John. The debut was not popular with rock critics (especially in the US, where &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer Melissa Mills infamously promised to commit suicide &quot;if this band makes it&quot;). In the course of the album&#x27;s making the writing relationship between Box, Byron and Hensley was beginning to develop. &quot;It was very quick, because we were all into the same things. It was like it was meant to be, there was that kind of chemistry&quot;, Mick Box recalled.

When Nigel Olsson returned to Elton John&#x27;s group in the spring of 1970, Keith Baker took his place. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Salisbury&quot; (February 1971), was more squarely in the progressive rock genre, with its 16-minute title track featuring a 24-piece orchestra. One of the album&#x27;s tracks, &quot;Lady in Black&quot;, described by Donald A. Guarisco as &quot;a stylishly arranged tune that builds from a folk-styled acoustic tune into a throbbing rocker full of ghostly harmonies and crunching guitar riffs&quot;, became a hit in Germany upon its re-release in 1977 (earning the band the Radio Luxemburg Lion award). Produced by Gerry Bron, the second album was significant for Ken Hensley&#x27;s rise to the position of main songwriter.

In December 1970 Keith Baker left the band and was replaced by Iain Clark (from another Vertigo band, Cressida). With him the band toured Germany in late December 1970/January 1971 and made their first US tour in the spring of 1971, supporting Three Dog Night and Steppenwolf.

By this time, Gerry Bron&#x27;s deal with Philips/Vertigo was over, so he set up his own label, Bronze Records. The third album was recorded in the summer months of 1971, during the band&#x27;s three visits to Lansdowne. &quot;It was the point in time when the band really found a solid musical direction&quot;, said Bron later. The third album, &quot;Look at Yourself&quot;, released in October 1971, marked the solidification of disparate ideas that had been a prominent feature of &quot;Salisbury&quot; and presented the unified sound and direction. &quot;July Morning&quot; has often been cited as the standout track. &quot;I think that &#x27;July Morning&#x27; is one of the best examples of the way the band was developing at that point in time. It introduced a lot of dynamics, a lot of light and shade into our sound&quot;, Ken Hensley said. The album peaked at No. 39 in the UK.

===Success (1972–1976)===
By the end of 1971 it became clear, according to Hensley, that he, Byron and Box had become the tightly knit nucleus of the band. Feeling marginalised and having recently been badly shaken up when he was involved in an accident in Germany in one of the band&#x27;s cars, first bassist Paul Newton left, in November 1971, and was briefly replaced by Mark Clarke. Newton recalled in a 2000 interview on Uriah Heep&#x27;s website his departure: &quot;Well, as you know, my father managed the band in the early days, with the Gods and Spice. He bought a lot of the gear and so on. When we became Uriah Heep and Ken joined the band and Ken is the first to admit it he had very definite ideas about what he wanted to do in a band. I suppose in some ways it was like the band was a vehicle which Ken needed and used to put his own ideas together. And there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that as such. I mean, let&#x27;s face it, the fact that what we did was successful was great for me too. But after a while you&#x27;re bound to get some in-fighting in a situation like that. There were other problems too, because Gerry Bron was now the manager and my father was trying to get back some money from him get some of his money back on the equipment and so on. There was a lot of unhappiness on all sorts of levels and everybody was unhappy in a lot of ways. I actually wanted to leave the band for quite a while before I actually left but I didn&#x27;t. Anyway, with the heavy work schedules and the pressures and so on, I ended up collapsing on stage one night and the other members of the band decided I should go. It was funny because I didn&#x27;t want to go and there was a lot of animosity but at the same time it was a tremendous relief&quot;.

During that same November, Iain Clark was replaced by Lee Kerslake, once of the Gods. New Zealander Gary Thain, a then member of Keef Hartley Band, joined Uriah Heep as a permanent member in February 1972 halfway through another American tour, replacing Mark Clarke who was exhausted and nearing a mental breakdown. &quot;Gary just had a style about him, it was incredible because every bass player in the world that I&#x27;ve ever known has always loved his style, with those melodic bass lines&quot;, Box later said. Thus the &quot;classic&quot; Uriah Heep formed, and according to biographer K. Blows, &quot;Everything just clicked into place.&quot;

The result of this newly found chemistry was the album &quot;Demons and Wizards&quot;, which reached No. 20 in the UK and No. 23 in the US in June 1972. While its title and Roger Dean&#x27;s sleeve both suggested that the band was romantically working medieval myth into their songs—and surely songs like &quot;Rainbow Demon&quot; and &quot;The Wizard&quot; (co-written by Mark Clarke, during his short stay) did have thematic links with fantasy world a more straightforward, hard-rocking approach was also apparent. To discard any possible insinuations concerning any kind of concept behind it, Hensley&#x27;s note on the sleeve declared the album was &quot;just a collection of our songs that we had a good time recording&quot;. Both critics and the band&#x27;s aficionados hold the album in high regard, which, according to AllMusic, &quot;solidified Uriah Heep&#x27;s reputation as a master of gothic-inflected heavy metal&quot;. Ken Hensley remembered:

Two singles were released from the album: &quot;The Wizard&quot; and &quot;Easy Livin, the second (a defiant rocker, according to Blows, &quot;tailor-made for Byron&#x27;s extrovert showmanship&quot;) peaked at No. 39 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Six months later, in November 1972, Uriah Heep&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Birthday&quot; (No. 28 UK, No. 31 US) came out, with &quot;Sweet Lorraine&quot; released as an American single and the title track (a multi-part fantasy epic featuring Hensley–Byron vocal duel and Box&#x27;s extensive guitar solo in the middle) being the album&#x27;s highlight. &quot;Uriah Heep used to have an image, now they have personality&quot;, wrote &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in 1973. Much of it stemmed from the flamboyant Byron. &quot;David was the communication point, the focal point of the whole group&#x27;s stage presentation. He had so much charisma, so much ability&quot;, admitted Hensley many years later. But Hensley too developed into a sophisticated instrumentalist and stage persona, whose writing and keyboard flair ignited the rest of the band.

A lavishly packaged (an eight-page booklet plus) double album &quot;Uriah Heep Live&quot; followed, recorded at the Birmingham Town Hall in January 1973. Having completed another Japanese tour, the band (due to tax problems) went abroad to record to Chateau d&#x27;Herouville in France. It was there that the solid, but rather mainstream-sounding, &quot;Sweet Freedom&quot; (No. 18 UK, No. 33 US) was created with &quot;Stealin&#x27;&quot; released as a single. Having gained worldwide recognition, the band quit the fantasy world in lyrics and made an obvious stab at versatility by adding funk (&quot;Dreamer&quot;) and an acoustic number along the lines of contemporary singer/songwriters (&quot;Circus&quot;) elements to the palette. Ken Hensley meanwhile had been gradually recording his own, mellower material; his solo debut &quot;Proud Words on a Dusty Shelf&quot; was released the same year.

&quot;Wonderworld&quot; (June 1974), recorded in Munich&#x27;s Musicland Studios in January, disappointed fans and band members alike. &quot;Recording abroad disrupted the band&#x27;s normal method of operation and that had a big negative effect on the group. Our communication was falling apart, we were arguing over stuff like royalties and we were getting involved in matters beyond music&quot;, Hensley said. Box remembered weeks spent in the studio as &quot;dramatic&quot; for all the wrong reasons. &quot;David was drunk for most of the time, Kenny was having an emotional time of it and I was constantly trying to help them so it was difficult for me too. There was also a little bit of friction because (artistic) Kenny didn&#x27;t like all the attention that (flamboyant) David was getting.&quot; Gary Thain was in even more serious trouble. According to Blows, &quot;A strenuous touring schedule, compounded by the bassist&#x27;s heavy drug dependency (inherent even before joining Heep) was taking its toll, though matters came to a head while on tour during September&quot;, when the bassist received a serious electric shock on stage in Dallas during a gig at Southern Methodist University’s Moody Coliseum on 15 September 1974. The rest of the US tour was then canceled and their UK dates rescheduled to October. Soon after going out of hospital, Thain, in &quot;Sounds&quot;, openly accused manager Gerry Bron of having turned Uriah Heep into a mere &quot;financial thing&quot; and was fired two months after the group&#x27;s final gig of 1974 at New Theatre in Oxford on 14 December. A year later, on 8 December 1975, Gary Thain was found dead in his Norwood Green home, having overdosed on heroin.
John Wetton (ex-Family and King Crimson) joined the band in March 1975 and with him &quot;Return to Fantasy&quot; (June 1975) was recorded; representing a revitalised Uriah Heep, it soared up to No. 7 in the UK. &quot;It was a relief to have someone solid and reliable, and he had a load of ideas too&quot;, Box remembered. The following &quot;Year-long world tour&quot; (according to a headline in &quot;NME&quot;), was marred by a new accident. Mick Box fell off stage in Louisville, Kentucky, on 2 August 1975, breaking the radial bone in his right arm (but he persevered through both the set and the tour, receiving three injections a night). On 26 March 1976 at Roy Wilkins Auditorium in St. Paul, Minnesota, John Wetton had an accident of his own when he (like his predecessor, Thain) received an electric shock on stage.

In November 1975 &quot;The Best of Uriah Heep&quot; compilation was released, preceded by two solo albums: Byron&#x27;s debut &quot;Take No Prisoners&quot; and Hensley&#x27;s second, &quot;Eager to Please&quot;.

&quot;High and Mighty&quot; followed in June 1976. It was considered lightweight; even Box stated: &quot;less of the &#x27;eavy and more of the &#x27;umble&quot; (making pointed reference to Uriah Heep&#x27;s self-description as &quot;&#x27;umble&quot; in Dickens&#x27; &quot;David Copperfield&quot;). The matter of production here became the point of major contention. With Bron committed to non-musical projects (including his air-taxi service) the band decided to produce the album themselves. The manager later insisted the result was Heep&#x27;s worst album, while Hensley accused the manager of deliberately ignoring the band&#x27;s interests. The album, though, was launched in the most lavish manner (with journalists and business people being flown off to the top of a Swiss mountain for a reception). However, it was not matched with the quality of live concerts, which were increasingly chaotic due to Byron&#x27;s inconsistency on stage. &quot;He&#x27;d always got drunk after the show but it had never got to the point where it would jeopardize the show itself. The performance had always been first and foremost with David. It was when the show started to come second that the problems began&quot;, Hensley remembered. &quot;The distance between David and the rest had grown to unworkable proportions&quot;, according to Blows. &quot;It&#x27;s a tragedy to say it but David was one of those classic people who could not face up to the fact that things were wrong and he looked for solace in a bottle&quot;, commented Bron. In July 1976, after the final show of a Spanish tour, Byron was sacked. Soon bassist John Wetton announced he was quitting. Obviously he was not comfortable in the band, nor were his colleagues with him. Hensley later explained: &quot;When he joined, we thought that we could replace a great bass player (Thain) with another great bass player, but we ignored the personality factor, which is crucial. It was like grafting on a new piece of skin but it just didn&#x27;t work—the body rejected it.&quot;

===Post-David Byron period (1976–1981)===
Uriah Heep recruited bassist Trevor Bolder (ex-David Bowie, Mick Ronson), and after having auditioned David Coverdale (Deep Purple, Whitesnake), Ian Hunter (Mott the Hoople) and Gary Holton (Heavy Metal Kids), brought in John Lawton, formerly of Lucifer&#x27;s Friend and the Les Humphries Singers, with whom they turned totally away from fantasy-oriented lyrics and multi-part compositions back towards a more straightforward hard rock sound typical of the era. Box later said: &quot;Image-wise he wasn&#x27;t quite what we were looking for, but his pipes were perfect and so we went for the music end of it.&quot; Hensley agreed: &quot;He had a voice that I thought would give a new dimension.&quot;

&quot;Firefly&quot; was released in February 1977, displaying &quot;renewed effervescence and energy in unveiling what was clearly a new beginning for Heep&quot; (per. K. Blows), &quot;a new vigour and confidence&quot; (according to a Record Mirror review) and also the new singer&#x27;s abilities: the latter (according to AllMusic), although lacking the multi-octave range of David Byron, &quot;boasted an impressive and emotionally rich hard rock voice that instantly jelled with the Uriah Heep sound&quot;. The band then toured the US supporting Kiss. Paul Stanley later recalled: &quot;They were incredibly professional, and so consistent that their worst nights were excellent and their best were tremendous.&quot;

&quot;Innocent Victim&quot;, released in November 1977, &quot;had a slight edge on &quot;Firefly&quot;&quot; according to Box, but still in retrospect this &quot;blend of sharp, short rockers and pop-friendly ballads&quot; looked like &quot;an attempt to court the American AOR market&quot;. The single &quot;Free Me&quot; (whose &quot;acoustic style and accent on harmonies brought the group dangerously close to Eagles territory&quot;, according to AllMusic) became an international hit. In Germany the album sold over a million copies and became Uriah Heep&#x27;s most successful, which coincided with the success of the re-released &quot;Lady in Black&quot;. For some time during this period, there were three Uriah Heep singles sitting together in the German Top 20, these being &quot;Wise Man&quot; (from &quot;Firefly&quot;), &quot;Lady in Black&quot; and &quot;Free Me&quot;.

In the end of 1978, &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; came out, having completed a hat-trick of studio albums to feature a consistent lineup (only the second time in their career that they had done so). &quot;Too poppy&quot; for Mick Box&#x27;s liking (but still, &quot;too eccentric to fit the bill of an AOR record&quot;, according to Allmusic), it was well received at the time (&quot;Sounds&quot; gave it 4 stars) but failed to chart. Meanwhile, the relative stability of the Lawton period belied the behind the scenes unrest having to do with Ken Hensley&#x27;s earning much more than his colleagues. &quot;Everything he wrote, he had to use… And if you insist in using everything you end up with substandard albums&quot;, disgruntled Box opined. The major rift, though, developed between Hensley and Lawton. As K. Blows writes, &quot;the combination of constant friction between the two (resulting in the nearest thing to violence the group had seen) and the constant presence of Lawton&#x27;s wife on the road finally led to the vocalist getting the chop, shortly after playing the Bilzen Festival in Belgium in August 1979&quot;.

Ex-Lone Star John Sloman was brought in, a younger singer who played keyboards and guitar and was, in the words of Box, &quot;an all rounder&quot;. But almost instantly, Lee Kerslake departed, after a row with Bron, whom the drummer accused of favouritism towards Hensley&#x27;s material. Several tracks of the next album had to be re-recorded with a new drummer, Chris Slade (of the Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band). &quot;Conquest&quot; LP was released in February 1980 (worldwide except the United States, where it was never released) and received 5 stars from Record Mirror, but, according to Box, &quot;was a difficult album to record&quot; and represented &quot;a confused Heep&quot;, even &quot;a mess&quot; (in the words of Trevor Bolder). The band went on the 10th Anniversary Tour with Girlschool as support and attracted respectable crowds. Hensley was very unhappy, primarily with Sloman, and he explained why:
A meeting at the manager&#x27;s office concerning the songwriting dissent was the last straw and, in September 1980, Hensley quit. Gregg Dechert, a Canadian who had worked with Sloman in Pulsar, came in and the band went on a 23-date tour of the UK. After recording an album&#x27;s worth of unreleased material Sloman left, citing musical differences for a reason. He would later go on to work with UFO, Gary Moore and Robert Palmer. Hensley&#x27;s acrimonious departure left the group in a state of collapse. Box and Bolder visited David Byron with attractive propositions. &quot;We couldn&#x27;t believe it when he said he didn&#x27;t want to know&quot;, the guitarist remembered. Bolder, who by that time &quot;had had enough of Gerry Bron and the management&quot;, decided to join Wishbone Ash. When Dechert and Slade left, Uriah Heep were down to just Mick Box with the name and contract.

===Peter Goalby era (1981–1986)===
Box remembered: &quot;I locked myself in my flat for two days and drank myself senseless in complete self-pity. But I somehow managed to pull myself together and consider my options.&quot; First he rang Lee Kerslake (who in the meanwhile had co-founded Blizzard of Ozz with Ozzy Osbourne) and the drummer brought along with him bassist Bob Daisley. Then John Sinclair came in, whom Box knew from the times he was a member of Heavy Metal Kids, and who currently played with a Los Angeles band called Lion. The band&#x27;s new vocalist became Trapeze&#x27;s Peter Goalby. The latter had once auditioned for Uriah Heep and failed, ironically Hensley being the only band member who had supported him as a choice. &quot;With us all contributing to the writing we forged our new direction&quot;, Box recalled.

Produced by Ashley Howe, the &quot;Abominog&quot; album (according to Blows) was &quot;important ... in the way it pulled Heep out of the Seventies and thrust them into the Eighties with determination muscle&quot;, even if it sounded a bit too American. Released in March 1982 (and preceded in February by the &quot;Abominog Junior&quot; EP), it won favour with the critics. Sounds gave it a five star review, the newly established rock magazine &quot;Kerrang!&quot; declared it &quot;the most mature and perhaps best album of their career&quot;, and in retrospect it is still seen as &quot;one of the most consistent and engaging albums in the group&#x27;s lengthy catalog&quot;. The album did relatively well in the American charts (No. 56) after its US release in September 1982, and the band successfully performed at the Castle Donington Monsters of Rock event a few weeks prior to this, on 21 August.

&quot;Head First&quot; (May 1983), produced again by Ashley Howe (who, according to Goalby, became &quot;like the sixth member of the band&quot;), followed much in the same vein, pursuing (according to AllMusic) &quot;a similar combination of heavy metal firepower and AOR sleekness&quot;. Not long before its release Daisley left the band to return to Ozzy Osbourne, and Trevor Bolder re-joined Uriah Heep. Both albums, &quot;Abominog&quot; and &quot;Head First&quot;, updated the band&#x27;s sound and generated a brief, newfound interest in Uriah Heep among younger heavy metal fans.

Uriah Heep toured the US supporting Rush, Judas Priest and Def Leppard, whose vocalist Joe Elliott remembered: &quot;They were the best band that we&#x27;ve ever toured with either as a headline or support, because there was no ego, no pretentious kind of stuff. They were good in as much that we learnt a lot from them.&quot;

By this time Gerry Bron was Uriah Heep manager no longer (they were looked after by Neil Warnock in Europe and Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s management team in the US) and then, finally, Bronze Records collapsed under the weight of debts, which, according to Box, &quot;cost Heep a lot of money&quot;. Massive Asian and South American tours followed before the band returned to the studio with producer Tony Platt and a new deal with CBS&#x27;s Portrait label secured by new manager Harry Maloney. Meanwhile, David Byron died of a heart attack and liver disease on 28 February 1985 at the age of 38.

&quot;Equator&quot; (March 1985) sold poorly, due to the fact that &quot;CBS just did a terrible job getting it into the shops&quot;, as Box saw it. On the other hand, what Kirk Blows described as &quot;a solid piece of product that had the potential to do extremely well&quot; was regarded less favourably by later reviewers. Jason Anderson, for one, argues that with this &quot;lackluster&quot; album, high only &quot;in high-schmaltz rating&quot;, the band squandered the chance that Portrait gave it.

Totally exhausted and having serious voice problems, Goalby left in November 1985 after an Australian tour. &quot;I loved and believed in Uriah Heep but it kicked the shit out of me in the end&quot;, were his parting words. Then John Sinclair quit, deciding to join Ozzy Osbourne, and keyboardist Phil Lanzon (Grand Prix, Sad Café) came in, fitting in immediately into the Box-envisaged scheme of things.

American singer Steff Fontaine, formerly of Christian metal band Joshua, joined in July 1986 but was criticised for being totally &quot;unprofessional&quot; (he missed, for some reason, a San Francisco gig) and was sacked in September 1986 after just one American tour. Fontaine&#x27;s position was offered then to ex-Grand Prix, Praying Mantis and Stratus vocalist Bernie Shaw, and that in retrospect was a winning move. Shaw &quot;felt honoured at being invited to join such a legendary band&quot;, while for Box &quot;it was like everything falling into place&quot;.

===New members, &quot;Raging Silence&quot; and &quot;Different World&quot; (1986–1993)===

The lineup remained unchanged from 1986 until 2007, with veteran Mick Box at the helm, Trevor Bolder on bass, Lee Kerslake on drums, vocalist Bernie Shaw and Phil Lanzon on keyboards. Their principal tour circuit has been in Germany, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Japan and Russia. In December 1987 they became the first ever Western rock band to play in the Soviet Union, under Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s policy of glasnost (Western pop acts Boney M, Cliff Richard, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and Elton John had already played shows there in the late 1970s during the pre-Gorbachev era). At Moscow&#x27;s Olympic Stadium the band played ten consecutive nights to a total of 180,000 people (following a reception that Bernie Shaw remembered as being &quot;something like Beatlemania&quot;), which was represented in the international press as not just an achievement for Uriah Heep but a major breakthrough for Western music in general. The concerts were recorded and issued as the &quot;Live in Moscow&quot; album, which included three new tracks. Ironically, it was this behind the Iron Curtain excursion that did well to re-establish Heep&#x27;s name back at home. After a series of sell-out dates in Czechoslovakia, East Berlin and Bulgaria the band returned to Britain for the Reading Festival in August 1988 and toured the UK with the Dogs D&#x27;Amour.

&quot;Raging Silence&quot;, produced by Richard Dodd and released in May 1989, was followed by a return to the Soviet Union, concerts in Poland, East Berlin, six dates in Brazil and another British tour. &quot;The last two years have been the most enjoyable of all my time in Heep&quot;, Trevor Bolder was quoted to say at the time. The band played in the Central TV studios in Nottingham on 29 November 1989 (the film was shown as part of the Independent TV series &quot;Bedrock&quot; and a few years later it was repeated in the Cue Music series) and celebrated its 20th anniversary with a series of compilations and re-issues.

Produced by Trevor Bolder and released early in 1991, &quot;Different World&quot; got a mixed reception from the press (put down in &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, hailed in Metal Hammer) and sold poorly. &quot;Yet another technically sound but artistically bland recording from Uriah Heep&quot; (according to AllMusic) failed to chart and marked the end of the band&#x27;s contract with Legacy Records. Touring incessantly, the band issued some compilations of which &quot;Rarities from the Bronze Age&quot; and &quot;The Lansdowne Tapes&quot; (featuring previously unreleased material from the early 1970s) are considered most noteworthy. Still, the first half of the 1990s is regarded even by the Heep fans as &quot;the wilderness years&quot;.

=== &quot;Sea of Light&quot; and &quot;Sonic Origami&quot; (1994–2006) ===
In late March and early April 1995, the band&#x27;s former singer John Lawton briefly rejoined Uriah Heep for two weeks to tour South Africa and Austria with Deep Purple, filling in for Bernie Shaw, who was suffering from voice problems at the time.

The album &quot;Sea of Light&quot; (released in April 1995) produced by the band along with Kalle Trapp was well received and in retrospect is seen as the band&#x27;s return to form, the key to success being (according to critic Donald A. Guarisco) the way it &quot;forsook the ill-judged pop metal stylings of albums like &quot;Equator&quot; for a return to the gothic-tinged old-school metal style that highlighted classic Uriah Heep albums like &quot;Look at Yourself&quot;&quot;.

Produced by Pip Williams, &quot;Sonic Origami&quot;, originally issued in Europe and Japan in the fall of 1998, then, a year later, in the U.S., had &quot;a grand, epic tone throughout&quot; that, according to rock critic Steve Huey, &quot;doesn&#x27;t always match Uriah Heep&#x27;s journeyman-sounding prog-tinged hard rock, still being a solid entry in its chosen genre&quot;. The release was followed by a successful European tour, which continued through 1999.

The band released &quot;The Legend Continues&quot; DVD and then toured the UK. A reunion gig with Ken Hensley and John Lawton took place in London on 7 December 2001 in the course of the &quot;Magicians Birthday Party&quot;, which since then became a tradition, even though Hensley never actually joined again.

Earlier in 2001, during the summer, the group embarked on its first US tour in seven years and returned the following year to headline both nights of Classic Rock Productions Classic Rock Festival at the Patriots Theater at the Trenton War Memorial in Trenton, New Jersey, on 5 and 6 October 2002, alongside Mostly Autumn, Asia, Karnataka, Focus and Nektar. Uriah Heep played an electric show the first night and an all acoustic show the second.

For most of the years that followed Uriah Heep have returned to Britain for a tour or just their annual showcase concert, the &quot;Magicians Birthday Party&quot;, which in 2003 was held at the now demolished London Astoria. All the while Mick Box acted as a manager for the band until, on 5 April 2005, they retained Simon Porter as their manager.

===&quot;Wake the Sleeper&quot; and &quot;Into the Wild&quot; (2007–2013)===
In early 2007, drummer Lee Kerslake had to leave the group due to ill health. In March of that year the band recruited Russell Gilbrook as their new drummer and immediately started recording a new studio album entitled &quot;Wake the Sleeper&quot;, where they used double bass drums in the songs &quot;Wake the Sleeper&quot; and &quot;War Child&quot;. Originally slated for a summer 2007 release, Universal Music finally released &quot;Wake the Sleeper&quot; on 2 June 2008.

In October 2009 Uriah Heep released their 40th-anniversary album &quot;Celebration – Forty Years of Rock&quot;, containing new studio recordings of twelve of their best known tracks, plus two brand new songs. &quot;This collection underlines again that Uriah Heep are deserving great respect for their past achievements but far more importantly it makes it crystal clear that this is a band with a bright future as well as a glorious history&quot;, wrote Chris Kee in his 9/10 review in &quot;Powerplay&quot; magazine&#x27;s February 2010 issue.

A United States tour for June/July 2010 was delayed due to immigration problems; the first two dates had to be rescheduled. This resulted in an appearance at B. B. King&#x27;s in New York City as being the first date of the tour. Then Uriah Heep performed live on the Progressive Rock stage at the inaugural High Voltage Festival in London&#x27;s Victoria Park on 25 July 2010. They played their 1972 album &quot;Demons and Wizards&quot; in its entirety, being joined by ex-Whitesnake man Micky Moody on slide guitar.

Uriah Heep released their 22nd studio album &quot;Into the Wild&quot; on 15 April 2011 in Europe (3 May in North America) via Frontiers Records.

Bassist Trevor Bolder died on 21 May 2013 after suffering from pancreatic cancer. He was 62 years old. British bassist John Jowitt (Ark, IQ, Arena) came in temporarily, followed by Dave Rimmer.

===&quot;Outsider&quot; and &quot;Living the Dream&quot; (2013–2019)===
In May 2013, when the band toured The Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Italy and Switzerland, they were again joined by their late 1970s era singer John Lawton, who was covering for Bernie Shaw taking time off for a routine medical procedure. Then both Bernie and John fronted the group for their show in San Javier, Spain on 12 July.

Uriah Heep entered the studio in January 2014 to begin recording their 23rd studio album &quot;Outsider&quot;, which was released in June 2014. The album featured new bass player Dave Rimmer, who had been a substitute for Trevor Bolder the previous year.

In March 2015 they went on the &quot;Down Unda Tour&quot; visiting Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide, Brisbane and Auckland. On 25 September, they announced the release of their greatest hits album &quot;Totally Driven&quot;, a collection of re-recordings of classic Heep songs made in 2001, which was released on 12 November. On 15 October that year, the group played alongside Ken Hensley and Lee Kerslake at a special two-hour concert at Crocus City Hall in Moscow.

Swedish singer Stefan Berggren, from Berggren Kerslake Band (BKB), subbed for Bernie Shaw on lead vocals at the Rosenheim Festival in Germany on 14 July 2016 and again later that same year for a New Year&#x27;s Eve festival in Sibiu, Romania, when Shaw had a family commitment.

2016 also saw the group play a few Japanese dates and the Legends Rock Cruise.

Former bass player John Wetton died on 31 January 2017 from colorectal cancer.

On 16 November 2017, it was reported that Uriah Heep would begin recording their 24th studio album, titled &quot;Living the Dream&quot;, with producer Jay Ruston. The album was released on 14 September 2018, and the band was set to embark on a world tour in support of it that would take them into 2019.

===&quot;Chaos and Colour&quot; (2020–2024)===
In a July 2020 interview with Sea of Tranquility, guitarist Mick Box and bassist Dave Rimmer confirmed that Uriah Heep were scheduled to begin recording their 25th studio album in early 2021. When asked about a possible release date, Box said: &quot;I think release is all down to the record company, I&#x27;ve gotta be honest. We never get a shout on that. They always seem to have some reason to release it at this time, that time, whatever time.&quot; In November 2021, Box revealed that the recording sessions of the new album were finished and &quot;over in L.A. now being mixed&quot;.

Two former Uriah Heep members died in 2020: Lee Kerslake after a long cancer battle on 19 September, and Ken Hensley after a short illness on 4 November. They had both each recorded a solo album earlier that year, posthumously released in early 2021. Another former member of Uriah Heep, vocalist John Lawton, died on 29 June 2021, at the age of 74.

On 27 January 2023, Uriah Heep released its 25th studio album, &quot;Chaos &amp; Colour&quot;, which was preceded by the two singles &quot;Save Me Tonight&quot; and &quot;Hurricane&quot;.

On a spring 2024 U.S. tour with Saxon, keyboardist Lanzon was called away due to family commitments. Adam Wakeman (son of Rick Wakeman) came in to fill in for Lanzon.

===Farewell tour (2024–present)===
On 19 September 2024, Uriah Heep announced that they will be embarking on a farewell tour, titled The Magician&#x27;s Farewell, in celebration of their 55th anniversary. The tour is expected to start in February 2025 and will last for two or three years, with guitarist Mick Box stating that the band &quot;intend to play as many places as possible.&quot;

==Musical style and influence==
Uriah Heep&#x27;s music has predominantly been described by critics and journalists as hard rock, progressive rock and heavy metal, with influences from acid rock, blues, and folk. Uriah Heep&#x27;s distinctive features have always included a massive keyboard sound, strong vocal harmonies and (in the early years) David Byron&#x27;s quasi-operatic vocals. In a 2018 interview, guitarist Mick Box cited &quot;five-part vocal harmonies, Hammond organ and wah-wah guitar&quot; as the main elements of the band&#x27;s sound.

Uriah Heep have been cited as an influence by numerous acts, including Iron Maiden, Queen, Accept, Ghost, Fates Warning, Sodom, Death, Dio, King Diamond, Avenged Sevenfold, Krokus, Demons &amp; Wizards (who were named after the band&#x27;s album with the same name), Axel Rudi Pell and Fifth Angel.

<text>Chamomile (American English) or camomile (British English; see spelling differences) ( or ) is the common name for several plants of the family Asteraceae. Two of the species, &quot;Matricaria chamomilla&quot; and &quot;Chamaemelum nobile&quot;, are commonly used to make herbal infusions for beverages. There has been limited (though thus far insufficient) research as to whether consuming chamomile in foods or beverages is effective in treating medical conditions.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;chamomile&quot; is derived via French and Latin, from the Greek , from , and . First used in the 13th century, the spelling &quot;chamomile&quot; corresponds to the Latin and the Greek . The spelling &quot;camomile&quot; is a British derivation from the French.

== Species ==

Some commonly used species include:
* &quot;Matricaria chamomilla&quot; – often called &quot;German chamomile&quot; or &quot;Water of Youth&quot;
* &quot;Chamaemelum nobile&quot; – Roman, English, or garden chamomile; also frequently used (&quot;C. nobile&quot; Treneague is normally used to create a chamomile lawn)

A number of other species&#x27; common names include the word &quot;chamomile&quot;. This does not necessarily mean they are used in the same manner as the species used in the herbal tea known as &quot;chamomile&quot;. Plants including the common name &quot;chamomile&quot;, of the family Asteraceae, are:
* &quot;Anthemis arvensis&quot; – corn, scentless or field chamomile
* &quot;Anthemis cotula&quot; – stinking chamomile
* &quot;Cladanthus mixtus&quot; – Moroccan chamomile
* &quot;Cota tinctoria&quot; – dyer&#x27;s, golden, oxeye, or yellow chamomile
* &quot;Eriocephalus punctulatus&quot; – Cape chamomile
* &quot;Matricaria discoidea&quot; – wild chamomile or pineapple weed
* &quot;Oncosiphon pilulifer&quot; – globe chamomile
* &quot;Tripleurospermum inodorum&quot; – wild, scentless or false chamomile

== Uses ==

Chamomile may be used as a flavouring agent in foods and beverages, mouthwash, soaps, and cosmetics. Chamomile tea is a herbal infusion made from dried flowers and hot water, and may improve sleep quality. Two types of chamomile are used, namely German chamomile (&quot;Matricaria recutita&quot;) and Roman chamomile (&quot;Chamaemelum nobile&quot;). Chamomile has historically been used as one of the flavouring ingredients in beer, and is sometimes used by modern brewers. Usually the whole plant is used, adding a bitter flavour component.

Chamomile, chiefly &quot;Chamaemelum nobile&quot; cultivars, is used to &quot;upholster&quot; chamomile seats, raised beds which are about half a meter tall, and designed to be sat upon. Chamomile lawns are also used in sunny areas with light traffic.

== Research ==
The main compounds of interest in chamomile flowers are coumarins, flavonoids, and polyphenols, including apigenin, quercetin, patuletin, luteolin, and daphnin. It is currently unclear whether chamomile is effective in treating any medical conditions. Chamomile is under preliminary research for its potential anti-anxiety properties. There is no high-quality clinical evidence that it is useful for treating insomnia.

== Drug interactions ==
The use of chamomile has the potential to cause adverse interactions with numerous herbal products and prescription drugs and may worsen pollen allergies. People who are allergic to ragweed (also in the daisy family) may be allergic to chamomile due to cross-reactivity.

Chamomile consists of several ingredients including coumarin, glycoside, herniarin, flavonoid, farnesol, nerolidol and germacranolide. Despite the presence of coumarin, as chamomile&#x27;s effect on the coagulation system has not yet been studied, it is unknown whether a clinically significant drug–herb interaction exists with anticoagulant drugs. However, until more information is available, it is not recommended to use these substances concurrently.

Chamomile should not be used by people with past or present cancers of the breast, ovary, or uterus; endometriosis; or uterine fibroids.

== Pregnancy and breastfeeding ==
Because chamomile has been known to cause uterine contractions that can invoke miscarriage, pregnant women are advised to not consume Roman chamomile (&quot;Chamaemelum nobile&quot;). Although oral consumption of chamomile is generally recognized as safe in the United States, there is insufficient clinical evidence about its potential for affecting nursing infants.

== Agriculture ==
The chamomile plant is known to be susceptible to many fungi, insects, and viruses. The following fungi are known to attack this plant: &quot;Albugo tragopogonis&quot; (white rust), &quot;Cylindrosporium matricariae, Erysiphe cichoracearum&quot; (powdery mildew), &quot;E. polyphage, Halicobasidium purpureum, Peronospora leptosperma, Peronospora radii, Phytophthora cactorum, Puccinia anthemedis, Puccinia matricaiae, Septoria chamomillae&quot;, and &quot;Sphaerotheca macularis&quot; (powdery mildew). Also, yellow virus (&quot;Chlorogenus callistephi&quot; var. &quot;californicus&quot; Holmes, &quot;Callistephus&quot; virus 1A) causes severe damage to this plant. Aphids (&quot;Aphis fabae&quot;) have been observed feeding on chamomile plants and the moth &quot;Autographa chryson&quot; causes defoliation.The insect &quot;Nysius minor&quot; caused shedding of &quot;M. chamomilla&quot; flowers,

== Historical descriptions ==
Nicholas Culpeper&#x27;s 17th century &quot;The Complete Herbal&quot; has an illustration and several entries on &quot;chamomel&quot;.

== In culture ==
* In &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot; by Beatrix Potter (1902), Peter&#x27;s mother gives him chamomile tea to cure his stomach ache.
* Mary Wesley&#x27;s 1984 novel &quot;The Camomile Lawn&quot; features a house in Cornwall with a lawn planted with chamomile rather than grass.
* In the 2001 No Doubt song &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, chamomile is featured in the line &quot;I&#x27;m just sippin&#x27; on chamomile&quot;, sung by Gwen Stefani.
* Chamomile is the national flower of Russia.
* In Shakespeare’s Henry IV, Part 1, Falstaff proclaims “…the camomile grows faster the more it is trodden on“.

<text>Pi (; Ancient Greek /piː/ or /peî/, uppercase Π, lowercase π, cursive ϖ; ) is the sixteenth letter of the Greek alphabet, representing the voiceless bilabial plosive . In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 80. It was derived from the Phoenician letter Pe (). Letters that arose from pi include Latin P, Cyrillic Pe (П, п), Coptic pi (Ⲡ, ⲡ), and Gothic pairthra (𐍀).

== Uppercase Pi ==
The uppercase letter Π is used as a symbol for:
* In textual criticism, &quot;Codex Petropolitanus&quot;, a 9th-century uncial codex of the Gospels, now located in St. Petersburg, Russia.
* In legal shorthand, it represents a plaintiff.
* In Mathematical finance, it represents a portfolio.

In science and engineering:
* The product operator in mathematics, indicated with capital pi notation (in analogy to the use of the capital Sigma as summation symbol).
* The osmotic pressure in chemistry.
* The viscous stress tensor in continuum mechanics and fluid dynamics.

== Lowercase Pi ==
The lowercase letter is used as a symbol for:
* The mathematical real transcendental (and thus irrational) constant π ≈ 3.14159..., the ratio of a circle&#x27;s circumference to its diameter in Euclidean geometry, exactly half of the circle constant. The letter &quot;&quot; is the first letter of the Greek words &#x27;periphery&#x27; and &#x27;perimeter&#x27;, i.e. the circumference.
* The prime-counting function in mathematics.
* Homotopy groups in algebraic topology.
* Dimensionless parameters constructed using the Buckingham π theorem of dimensional analysis.
* The hadron called the pion (pi meson).
* Often inflation rate in macroeconomics.
* Sometimes profit in microeconomics.
* A type of chemical bond in which the p orbitals overlap, called a pi bond.
* The natural projection on the tangent bundle on a manifold.
* The unary operation of projection in relational algebra.
* Policy in reinforcement learning.

* Polyamory (in the earliest polyamory pride flag design, created by Jim Evans in 1995, pi stands for the first letter of polyamory).

==History==

An early form of pi was , appearing almost like a gamma with a hook.

== Variant pi ==

Variant pi or &quot;pomega&quot; (formula_1 or ϖ) is a glyph variant of lowercase pi sometimes used in technical contexts. It resembles a lowercase omega with a macron, though historically it is simply a cursive form of pi, with its legs bent inward to meet. It was also used in the minuscule script. It is a symbol for:
* Angular frequency of a wave in fluid dynamics (angular frequency is usually represented by formula_2 but this may be confused with vorticity in a fluid dynamics context).
* Longitude of pericenter in celestial mechanics.
* Comoving distance in cosmology.
* Single-scattering albedo in radiative transfer.
* Mean fitness of a population in biology.
* Fundamental weights of a representation (probably to better distinguish from elements formula_3 of the Weyl group, than the usual notation formula_2).
* The lemniscate constant.

== Unicode ==

Lower-case pi was fairly common in 8-bit character encodings, for instance it is at in CP437 and at on Mac OS Roman.
The various forms of pi present in Unicode are:
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 

These are intended for use as mathematical symbols. Text written in the Greek language (i.e. words, as opposed to mathematics) should not come from any of the tables on this page, but instead should use the normal Greek letters, which have different code numbers and often a different appearance. Using the mathematical symbols to display words (or vice versa) is likely to result in inconsistent spacing and a clumsy, mismatched appearance:
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
*

<text>Koppa or qoppa (&#x27;; as a modern numeral sign: &#x27;) is a letter that was used in early forms of the Greek alphabet, derived from Phoenician qoph (). It was originally used to denote the sound, but dropped out of use as an alphabetic character and replaced by Kappa (Κ). It has remained in use as a numeral symbol (90) in the system of Greek numerals, although with a modified shape. Koppa is the source of Latin Q, as well as the Cyrillic numeral sign of the same name (Koppa).

== Alphabetic ==
In Phoenician, qoph was pronounced ; in Greek, which lacked such a sound, it was instead used for before back vowels Ο, Υ and Ω. In this function, it was borrowed into the Italic alphabets and ultimately into Latin. However, as the sound had two redundant spellings, koppa was eventually replaced by kappa (Κ) in Greek. It remained in use as a letter in some Doric regions into the 5th century BC.

The koppa was used as a symbol for the city of Corinth, which was originally spelled in Doric Greek.

== Numeric ==
Koppa remained in use in the system of Milesian Greek numerals, where it had the value of 90. It has continued to be used in this function into modern times, though its shape has changed over time. In the Greek cursive script, the Q-like shape with a closed circle on top (handwritten as ) was often broken up at the side () or at the top (). These are also the shapes in which it was borrowed into the early Cyrillic alphabet (Ҁ), as well as into Gothic (), in both cases with the same numeric function. In modern Church Slavonic, a similar-looking but unrelated letter Ч is used instead of the former. Similarly, in the Coptic script, the identical-looking sign ϥ is also used as a numeral for 90, although as an alphabetic letter it has an unrelated sound value, , derived from Egyptian demotic. Later, in minuscule handwriting, the shape changed further into a simple zigzag line (, ).

==Typography==
Modern typography of the numeral Koppa has most often employed some version of the Z-shaped character. It may appear in several variants: as a simple geometrical lightning-bolt shape (); with the top part curved rightward, evoking to some degree the original uncial form (); in a characteristic shape with a shorter top arm slightly curved to the left, resembling a Hebrew letter Lamedh (); or with the same lamedh shape turned upside down (). Other variants common in older print include shapes based on the open uncial form (, ). Some of these shapes may be indistinguishable from realizations of the other Greek numeral, Stigma, in other fonts. Koppa has also sometimes been replaced by a lowercase Latin &quot;q&quot;, a mirrored uppercase &quot;P&quot;, or a &quot;5&quot; turned upside down.

As with the numeral usage of stigma (digamma) and Sampi, modern typographical practice normally does not observe a contrast between uppercase and lowercase forms for numeric koppa.

==Unicode==
The Unicode character encoding standard originally (since version 1.1 of 1993), had only a single code point for Koppa, which was marked as uppercase and could be used either for an epigraphic or a numeral glyph, depending on font design. A lowercase form was encoded in version 3.0 (1999). A second pair of code points specifically for the original closed epigraphical shape was introduced in version 3.2 (2002). This left the older two code points (U+03DE/U+03DF, Ϟϟ) to cover primarily the numeral glyphs.

As of 2010, coverage of these code points in common computer fonts is therefore still inconsistent: while the most commonly used version of the numeral glyph will be located at the lowercase code point U+03DF in recent fonts, older fonts may either have no character at all or a version of the closed epigraphic form at that position. Conversely, older fonts may have the numeral glyph at the uppercase code point, while this position may be filled with any of several less common glyphs in newer ones. Since there had never been a consistent typographic tradition for a specifically uppercase numeral &quot;koppa&quot;, the typographer Yannis Haralambous proposed two new variants for it, and , noting that he himself found them not &quot;entirely satisfactory&quot;. A serifed version similar to his &quot;koppa&quot; was adopted as the reference glyph for the Unicode code charts, along with a lowercase form with heavy curved arms and pointed angles: . Some current Unicode fonts have adopted these new shapes, while many font designers have opted for some combination of the more traditional glyphs, including the uncial and the lamedh-shaped ones.

<text>Wishbone Ash are a British rock band who achieved success in the early to mid-1970s. Their albums include &quot;Wishbone Ash&quot; (1970), &quot;Pilgrimage&quot; (1971), &quot;Argus&quot; (1972), &quot;Wishbone Four&quot; (1973), &quot;There&#x27;s the Rub&quot; (1974) and &quot;New England&quot; (1976).

Wishbone Ash are noted for their extensive use of harmony twin lead guitars, which had been attracting electric blues bands since Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page had played together in the Yardbirds in 1966. Their contributions helped Andy Powell and Ted Turner to be voted &quot;Two of the Ten Most Important Guitarists in Rock History&quot; (&quot;Traffic&quot; magazine 1989). &quot;Melody Maker&quot; (1972) described Powell and Turner as &quot;the most interesting two-guitar team since the days when Beck and Page graced The Yardbirds&quot;. Several notable bands have cited Wishbone Ash as an influence, including the Eagles, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Van Halen, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Thin Lizzy, Metallica, Dream Theater, Overkill and Opeth.

Formed in Torquay, Devon in 1969 out of the ashes of the trio The Empty Vessels (originally known as The Torinoes, later briefly being renamed Tanglewood in 1969), which had been formed by Wishbone Ash&#x27;s founding member and creative force Martin Turner (lead vocals and bass guitar) in 1963 and complemented by Steve Upton (drums and percussion) in 1966. Wishbone Ash formed when Martin Turner and Steve Upton set up auditions for a guitarist and subsequently ended up with two guitarists because they could not decide between the two. So as a result, guitarists/vocalists Andy Powell and Ted Turner completed the original Wishbone Ash line-up. In 1974 Ted Turner left the band, and was replaced by Laurie Wisefield. The band continued on with strong critical and commercial success until 1980. There followed line-ups featuring former bass players from King Crimson (John Wetton), Uriah Heep (Trevor Bolder) and Trapeze (Mervyn Spence). Wisefield left in 1985. In 1987, however, the original line-up reunited for several albums – &quot;Nouveau Calls&quot;, &quot;Here to Hear&quot; and &quot;Strange Affair&quot; – until 1990, when Upton quit the band. After Martin Turner was replaced in 1991, the band recorded &quot;The Ash Live in Chicago&quot;, before Ted Turner left again in January 1994. This left Andy Powell as the sole remaining original founding member of Wishbone Ash to continue the band on into the future.

==History==
===Formation and rise to fame (1969–1980)===
Wishbone Ash was formed in October 1969 by bass guitarist Martin Turner and drummer Steve Upton. When Tanglewood&#x27;s original guitarist, Martin&#x27;s brother Glenn Turner, left the trio and returned to his native Devon, their manager, Miles Copeland III, advertised for a guitar player and also for a keyboard player. After an extensive search for a guitarist, the band could not decide between the final two candidates, Andy Powell and Ted Turner (no relation to Martin). It was suggested that they try both guitar players &quot;just to see what it sounds like&quot;. Differing from the twin lead sound of Southern rock pioneer The Allman Brothers Band, Wishbone Ash included strong elements of progressive rock, and also of folk and classical music. After the band members wrote several suggested band names on two sheets of paper, Martin Turner picked one word from each list – &#x27;Wishbone&#x27; and &#x27;Ash&#x27;.

In early 1970, the band secured an opening spot for Deep Purple. Its guitarist, Ritchie Blackmore, later recommended Wishbone Ash to producer Derek Lawrence, as well as helping them secure a record deal with Decca/MCA Records. 

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Wishbone Ash&quot;, was released in December 1970. One year later, the group released &quot;Pilgrimage&quot; and the band peaked commercially in 1972 with &quot;Argus&quot;, their highest placed entry in the UK Albums Chart (#3). The album was voted by the readers of &quot;Sounds&quot; as the &quot;best rock album of the year&quot;, also &quot;Top British Album&quot; (&quot;Melody Maker&quot;). The band were getting international acclaim for their live performances as they gained popularity around the world.

Wishbone Ash had now begun to play major arenas as headliners. &quot;Wishbone Four&quot; (1973) was the band&#x27;s first record without producer Derek Lawrence, as the band decided to produce the album themselves, and in December 1973 the band released a double live album, &quot;Live Dates&quot;. There had already been an album released called &quot;Wishbone Ash Live in Memphis&quot;, which was a promo to FM radio stations but never sold in stores.

In May 1974 guitarist Ted Turner, burned out by the group&#x27;s constant touring, decided to leave the band. After replacing Turner with guitarist Laurie Wisefield (ex-Home), the band relocated to the US and recorded &quot;There&#x27;s the Rub&quot; (1974). 

&quot;Locked In&quot; (1976), produced by Tom Dowd, saw the band moving towards US soft-rock territory and the group began touring with a keyboard player, Graham Maitland, who had previously guested with the group on a few shows and contributed to &quot;Wishbone Four&quot;.

1976&#x27;s &quot;New England&quot; returned to the traditional Wishbone Ash style and &quot;Front Page News&quot; (1977) was the band&#x27;s last album of this period that was recorded in the US. By 1978, after years of experimental albums, the band decided to return to its roots with &quot;No Smoke Without Fire&quot;, the first to be produced by Derek Lawrence since &quot;Argus&quot; in 1972. The album contained mainly songs written by Laurie Wisefield and Martin Turner.

The band spent six months making the next album, &quot;Just Testing&quot;, which was released in February 1980. Pressured by MCA to make more commercial music, Andy Powell, Laurie Wisefield and Steve Upton expressed to bassist/vocalist Martin Turner that they planned to recruit a lead singer/frontman, thus restricting Martin Turner&#x27;s duties to bass guitar only. Turner felt unable to support such plans and described the position he was being put in as &quot;untenable&quot;. Following a band meeting at his house in October 1980 (just prior to the release of their &quot;Live Dates 2&quot; album), Martin Turner parted company with the band. Ironically, the band never recruited the proposed frontman and Turner, in his 2012 autobiography, described the situation as &quot;constructive dismissal&quot;. However this was not a view held by the rest of the remaining band members or the then management.

===Line-up changes (1981–1986)===
Turner was replaced by bassist and vocalist John Wetton, formerly of Family, King Crimson, Roxy Music, Uriah Heep and U.K. &quot;Number the Brave&quot; was released in April 1981 and featured Wetton&#x27;s lead vocals on just one song, although during album sessions he had offered songs such as &quot;Here Comes the Feeling&quot; that would eventually sell millions when released on Asia&#x27;s 1982 debut album. Discouraged, Wetton did not continue with Wishbone Ash beyond the album sessions and instead co-founded Asia.

Wetton was replaced on the &quot;Number the Brave&quot; tour by the former Uriah Heep bassist Trevor Bolder. Also joining the band was female backing vocalist, Claire Hamill, who had sung on both the &quot;Just Testing&quot; and &quot;Number the Brave&quot; albums.

In 1982, after Hamill&#x27;s departure, the band experimented with heavy metal on the &quot;Twin Barrels Burning&quot; album. It became the highest charting Wishbone Ash album in years (UK #22).

Bolder left the group to rejoin Uriah Heep in April 1983, to be replaced by bassist/vocalist Mervyn Spence (ex-Trapeze). The group continued with a rock side on 1985&#x27;s &quot;Raw to the Bone&quot;, which became the first Wishbone Ash album not to make the charts. Not long after, Wisefield left after serving as guitarist in the band for eleven years, going on to a varied career that would include work with Tina Turner, Joe Cocker, Roger Chapman, Jeff Wayne and the Queen musical &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;. He was replaced by Jamie Crompton, who in turn was succeeded briefly in 1986 by Phil Palmer, after which, Crompton returned. Early in 1986, Mervyn Spence quit as well, to be replaced by ex-Kinks bassist Andy Pyle.

===Reunions and departures (1987–1994)===

At the start of 1987, I.R.S. Records founder and original Wishbone manager Miles Copeland III began a series of albums entitled &quot;No Speak&quot;, which featured all instrumental music. To launch the label successfully, Copeland needed a big name band that would bring publicity to the project. Copeland approached the four founding members of Wishbone Ash about having the original line-up record an all-instrumental album. Beginning in May 1987, for the first time in fourteen years, Andy Powell and Steve Upton joined forces with Martin Turner and Ted Turner to record the album. 

In the meantime, previously booked concerts were covered by the Powell/Upton/Crompton/Pyle lineup, including a show in May 1987 in
Sun City in South Africa, where the band had been advised that they would be playing to a 50/50 multi-racial audience. But when this did not occur, the band returned to the UK and wrote to the United Nations expressing their regret at playing the show and their support of the anti-apartheid cause. 

The year of 1987 concluded with appearances in the Soviet Union in December, after which Crompton and Pyle stepped aside as the original foursome put out &quot;Nouveau Calls&quot;, And the original line-up&#x27;s tour of 1988 was a huge success, as the band played large venues for the first time since the late 1970s. The original Wishbone Ash lineup performed onstage for the first time since February 1974, playing the first concert of their reunion at Folkestone Leas Cliffe Hall in February 1988. Due to a late arrival from Chicago due to immigration problems, Ted Turner had missed tour rehearsals, so Jamie Crompton was brought back to play with the band during the first few weeks of the tour for the first part of the show, with Ted brought on mid-set. In August 1989 the band released a reunion album with vocals entitled &quot;Here to Hear&quot;, featuring mainly songs written by Ted and Martin Turner.

In 1990 when the band went back into the studio to record the follow-up to &quot;Here to Hear&quot;, they were shocked when founding member Upton, the band&#x27;s drummer for their entire career, announced his retirement from the music industry. They enlisted drummer Robbie France, but replaced him with Ray Weston when it was determined that personal conflicts between France and Martin Turner could not be resolved. &quot;Strange Affair&quot; was released in May 1991, featuring mainly songs written by Andy Powell and Ted Turner.

Later in 1991, the band decided to continue without founding member Martin Turner, with the bassist/vocalist being replaced by returnee Andy Pyle, who had been in the band years earlier. The band toured throughout 1992/93, releasing the live album &quot;The Ash Live in Chicago&quot;, which had been recorded at two shows at a venue called Easy Street in the Chicago area back in January 1992, with guest keyboardist Dan C. Gillogly. And bassist Brad Lang filled in for Pyle for a BBC date in May 1992 and again that August for a handful of shows. January 1994 saw the second and final departure of Ted Turner. Following Turner&#x27;s departure, Pyle and Weston also left the band.

===Reunion years to present (1995–present)===

At this stage Andy Powell was the only original member left in Wishbone Ash. Powell enlisted guitarist/songwriter Roger Filgate, bassist/vocalist Tony Kishman and drummer Mike Sturgis. The new line-up debuted on a short UK/European tour in spring 1995. By the time of the band&#x27;s 25th anniversary tour in late 1995, Tony Kishman was finding touring difficult due to other performing engagements in the United States. Founding member Martin Turner replaced him on bass and vocals for the duration of the tour, before Kishman returned to record lead vocals for the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Illuminations&quot;, which was released in 1996 and featured the Powell/Filgate/Kishman/Sturgis line-up. Powell relied on fan donations and outside assistance to help finance the album.

In November 1997 guitarist Chris Auld filled in for Filgate, but at that year&#x27;s end, Filgate, Kishman and Sturgis all departed, so in early 1998, Powell brought former drummer Weston back into the fold, along with new members guitarist Mark Birch and bassist Bob Skeat. Wishbone Ash then went on to release two electronic dance albums on UK indie label Invisible Hands Music. The albums contained electronic beats blended with Wishbone Ash guitar riffs. &quot;Trance Visionary&quot; was the first of the pair, spawning a 12&quot; single of four mixes that reached number 38 on the UK dance chart. &quot;Psychic Terrorism&quot; followed. 

The band then released an acoustic album of classic and new songs entitled &quot;Bare Bones&quot; before hitting the road in 2000 to celebrate their 30th anniversary. A filmed show was held at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in London, where the band welcomed special guests Wisefield and Hamill as well as other friends for a star-studded concert that resulted in &quot;Live Dates 3&quot; and a live DVD.
In 2001 Mark Birch was replaced by Finnish guitarist Ben Granfelt. The band then hit the road for their most extensive touring schedule in years. Wishbone Ash returned to the studio in 2002 for the &quot;Bona Fide&quot; album and 2003 saw the band touring across the world with Savoy Brown, playing their largest number of American dates since the 1980s.

Ben Granfelt left the band in 2004 to continue working on his solo career and Granfelt&#x27;s mentor, Muddy Manninen, joined the band. By late 2006, the band released a new studio album entitled &quot;Clan Destiny&quot; but in 2007, longtime drummer Ray Weston left the band, stating that he was tired of constant touring and wanted to concentrate on different things. He was replaced by Joe Crabtree, known for his work with Pendragon and King Crimson violinist David Cross. In late 2007, the band put out &quot;Power of Eternity&quot;; their first with new member Joe Crabtree.

On 25 November 2011 Wishbone Ash released their 23rd album, the well received &quot;Elegant Stealth&quot;, which is also the first album to be recorded by the same line up as the predecessor since 1989.

In 2013 a court case relating to a trade mark infringement and the use of the name &#x27;Martin Turner&#x27;s Wishbone Ash&#x27; was decided. The court ruled in favour of Andy Powell with the comprehensive judgement forming a clear history of the band since its inception.

On 19 February 2014 the 24th studio album &quot;Blue Horizon&quot; was released. The reviews for this album were generally very positive. As of 2014 this line-up of the band, having been together since 2007, became the longest-lasting line-up of Wishbone Ash in the group&#x27;s history and on 16 May 2015 they recorded a live to vinyl album at Metropolis Studios.

On 21–23 May 2015 Wishbone Ash recorded the DVD &quot;Live in Paris&quot; at in France. The performance included additional percussion and guitar contributions from Andy&#x27;s son Aynsley Powell.

In May 2017 it was announced that Mark Abrahams, a long time Wishbone Ash fan, would be joining to cover guitar duties. Abrahams is a guitarist who previously owned Vision Guitars, a guitar shop in Castleford, West Yorkshire, England.

On 24 September 2019 it was announced that Wishbone Ash were signed to Steamhammer/SPV and released &quot;Coat of Arms&quot;, their first studio album in six years, on 28 February 2020. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;We Stand as One&quot;, was premiered on to the band&#x27;s 50th anniversary in autumn 2019 and had been released on 10 January 2020. The second single &quot;Back in the Day&quot; was released on 7 February 2020. The album cover was created by a heraldry artist Olaf Keller in the Regal Coat of Arms design studio.

For some dates on their 2021 tour, drummer Mike Sturgis rejoined the band in place of Joe Crabtree. Then in February 2022 Mike Truscott became Wishbone Ash&#x27;s official drummer.

In August 2023 the band announced the release of a live album, &quot;Live Dates Live&quot;.

==Martin Turner ex Wishbone Ash==
Martin Turner began touring in 2004 with &quot;Martin Turner&#x27;s Wishbone Ash&quot;, performing material by the classic line ups of the band. Occasionally Ted Turner and Laurie Wisefield have joined his group on stage as guests. He published his autobiography in 2012.

In 2013 Andy Powell took legal action to protect the Wishbone Ash registered trademark and prevent Martin Turner from using his chosen group name. The court ruled in favour of Andy Powell and Martin Turner&#x27;s application to appeal was refused. Since then he has toured and recorded with his band as &quot;Martin Turner ex Wishbone Ash&quot;.

==Special events==
Wishbone Ash have developed two group gatherings, AshCon in the UK and AshFest in the United States. These began in 1994 and have developed into gatherings of the &#x27;faithful&#x27; and have since become annual fixtures.

<text>Sampi (modern: ϡ; ancient shapes: , ) is an archaic letter of the Greek alphabet. It was used as an addition to the classical 24-letter alphabet in some eastern Ionic dialects of ancient Greek in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, to denote some type of a sibilant sound, probably or , and was abandoned when the sound disappeared from Greek.

It later remained in use as a numeral symbol for 900 in the alphabetic (&quot;Milesian&quot;) system of Greek numerals. Its modern shape, which resembles a π inclining to the right with a longish curved cross-stroke, developed during its use as a numeric symbol in minuscule handwriting of the Byzantine era.

Its current name, &quot;sampi&quot;, originally probably meant &quot;san pi&quot;, i.e. &quot;like a pi&quot;, and is also of medieval origin. The letter&#x27;s original name in antiquity is not known. It has been proposed that sampi was a continuation of the archaic letter &quot;san&quot;, which was originally shaped like an M and denoted the sound in some other dialects. Besides &quot;san&quot;, names that have been proposed for sampi include &quot;parakyisma&quot; and &quot;angma&quot;, while other historically attested terms for it are &quot;enacosis&quot;, &quot;sincope&quot;, and &quot;o charaktir&quot;.

==Alphabetic sampi==

As an alphabetic letter denoting a sibilant sound, sampi (shaped ) was mostly used between the middle of the 6th and the middle of the 5th centuries BC, although some attestations have been dated as early as the 7th century BC. It has been attested in the cities of Miletus, Ephesos, Halikarnassos, Erythrae, Teos (all situated in the region of Ionia in Asia Minor), in the island of Samos, in the Ionian colony of Massilia, and in Kyzikos (situated farther north in Asia Minor, in the region of Mysia). In addition, in the city of Pontic Mesembria, on the Black Sea coast of Thrace, it was used on coins, which were marked with the abbreviation of the city&#x27;s name, spelled &quot;&quot;.

Sampi occurs in positions where other dialects, including written Ionic, normally have double sigma (), i.e. a long sound. Some other dialects, particularly Attic Greek, have (long ) in the same words (e.g. vs. &#x27;sea&#x27;, or vs. &#x27;four&#x27;). The sounds in question are all reflexes of the proto-Greek consonant clusters or . It is therefore believed that the local letter sampi was used to denote some kind of intermediate sound during the phonetic change from the earlier plosive clusters towards the later sound, possibly an affricate , forming a triplet with the Greek letters for and .

Among the earliest known uses of sampi in this function is an abecedarium from Samos dated to the mid-7th century BC. This early attestation already bears witness to its alphabetic position behind omega (i.e. not the position of san), and it shows that its invention cannot have been much later than that of omega itself.

The first known use of alphabetic sampi in writing native Greek words is an inscription found on a silver plate in Ephesus, which has the words &quot;&quot; (&quot;four&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;forty&quot;) spelled with sampi (cf. normal spelling Ionic &quot;&quot; vs. Attic ). It can be dated between the late 7th century and mid 6th century BC. An inscription from Halicarnassus has the names &quot;Ἁλικαρναͳέ[ω]ν&quot; (&quot;of the Halicarnassians&quot;) and the personal names &quot;Ὀαͳαͳιος&quot; and &quot;Π[α]νυάͳιος&quot;. All of these names appear to be of non-Greek, local origin, i.e. Carian. On a late 6th century bronze plate from Miletus dedicated to the sanctuary of Athena at Assesos, the spelling &quot;&quot; (&quot;to Athena of Assessos&quot;) has been identified. This is currently the first known instance of alphabetic sampi in Miletus itself, commonly assumed to be the birthplace of the numeral system and thus of the later numeric use of sampi.

It has been suggested that there may be an isolated example of the use of alphabetic sampi in Athens. In a famous painted black figure amphora from c.615 BC, known as the &quot;Nessos amphora&quot;, the inscribed name of the eponymous centaur Nessus is rendered in the irregular spelling . The expected regular form of the name would have been either Attic &quot;&quot; – with a double &quot;τ&quot; – or Ionic &quot;&quot;. Traces of corrections that are still visible underneath the painted &quot;Τ&quot; have led to the conjecture that the painter originally wrote , with sampi for the σσ/ττ sound.

===Pamphylian sampi===
A letter similar to Ionian sampi, but of unknown historical relation with it, existed in the highly deviant local dialect of Pamphylia in southern Asia Minor. It was shaped like . According to Brixhe it probably stood for the sounds , , or . It is found in a few inscriptions in the cities of Aspendos and Perge as well as on local coins. For instance, an inscription from Perge dated to around 400 BC reads: (=&quot;Vanássāi Preiíāi Klemútas Lwarámu Vasirwōtas anéthēke&quot;, &quot;Klemutas the vasirwotas, son of Lwaramus, dedicated this to the Queen of Perge&quot;). The same title &quot;Queen of Perge&quot;, the local title for the goddess Artemis, is found on coin legends: . As is known to be the local feminine form of the archaic Greek noun , i.e. &quot;(w)anax&quot; (&quot;king&quot;), it is believed that the letter stood for some type of sibilant reflecting Proto-Greek .

==Numeric sampi==

In the alphabetic numeral system, which was probably invented in Miletus and is therefore sometimes called the &quot;Milesian&quot; system, there are 27 numeral signs: the first nine letters of the alphabet, from alpha (A) to theta (Θ) stand for the digits 1–9; the next nine, beginning with iota (Ι), stand for the multiples of ten (10, 20, etc. up to 90); and the last nine, beginning with rho (Ρ), stand for the hundreds (100 – 900). For this purpose, the 24 letters of the standard classical Greek alphabet were used with the addition of three archaic or local letters: digamma/&quot;wau&quot; (Ϝ, , originally denoting the sound ) for &quot;6&quot;, koppa (Ϙ, originally denoting the sound ) for &quot;90&quot;, and sampi for &quot;900&quot;. While digamma and koppa were retained in their original alphabetic positions inherited from Phoenician, the third archaic Phoenician character, san/tsade (Ϻ, denoting an sound), was not used in this way. Instead, sampi was chosen, and added at the end of the system, after omega (800).

From this, it has been concluded that the system must have been invented at a time and place when digamma and koppa were still either in use or at least still remembered as parts of the alphabetic sequence, whereas san had either already been forgotten, or at least was no longer remembered with its original alphabetic position. In the latter case, according to a much debated view, sampi itself may in fact have been regarded as being san, but with a new position in the alphabet.

The dating of the emergence of this system, and with it of numeric sampi, has been the object of much discussion. At the end of the 19th century, authors such as Thompson placed its full development only in the 3rd century BC. Jeffery states that the system as a whole can be traced much further back, into the 6th century BC. An early, though isolated, instance of apparent use of alphabetic Milesian numerals in Athens occurs on a stone inscribed with several columns of two-digit numerals, of unknown meaning, dated from the middle of the 5th century BC.

While the emergence of the system as a whole has thus been given a much earlier dating than was often assumed earlier, actual occurrences of the letter sampi in this context have as yet not been found in any early examples. According to Threatte, the earliest known use of numeric sampi in a stone inscription occurs in an inscription in Magnesia from the 2nd century BC, in a phrase denoting a sum of money (&quot;) but the exact numeric meaning of this example is disputed. In Athens, the first attestation is only from the beginning of the 2nd century AD, again in an inscription naming sums of money.

Earlier than the attestations in the full function as a numeral are a few instances where sampi was used in Athens as a mark to enumerate sequences of things in a set, along with the 24 other letters of the alphabet, without implying a specific decimal numeral value. For instance, there is a set of 25 metal tokens, each stamped with one of the letters from alpha to sampi, which are dated to the 4th century BC and were probably used as identification marks for judges in the courts of the Athenian democracy.

In papyrus texts from the Ptolemaic period onwards, numeric sampi occurs with some regularity.

At an early stage in the papyri, the numeral sampi was used not only for 900, but, somewhat confusingly, also as a multiplicator for 1000, since a way of marking thousands and their multiples was not yet otherwise provided by the alphabetic system. Writing an alpha over sampi ( or, in a ligature, ) meant &quot;1×1000&quot;, a theta over sampi () meant &quot;9×1000&quot;, and so on. In the examples cited by Gardthausen, a slightly modified shape of sampi, with a shorter right stem (), is used. This system was later simplified into one where the thousands operator was marked just as a small stroke to the left of the letter (͵α = 1000).

==Glyph development==

In early stone inscriptions, the shape of sampi, both alphabetic and numeric, is . Square-topped shapes, with the middle vertical stroke either of equal length with the outer ones or longer , are also found in early papyri. This form fits the earliest attested verbal description of the shape of sampi as a numeral sign in the ancient literature, which occurs in a remark in the works of the 2nd-century AD physician Galen. Commenting on the use of certain obscure abbreviations found in earlier manuscripts of Hippocrates, Galen says that one of them &quot;looks like the way some people write the sign for 900&quot;, and describes this as &quot;the shape of the letter Π with a vertical line in the middle&quot; (&quot;&quot;).
From the time of the earliest papyri, the square-topped forms of handwritten sampi alternate with variants where the top is rounded (, ) or pointed (, ). The rounded form also occurs in stone inscriptions in the Roman era. In the late Roman period, the arrow-shaped or rounded forms are often written with a loop connecting the two lines at the right, leading to the &quot;ace-of-spades&quot; form , or to . These forms, in turn, occasionally have another decorative stroke added on the left (). It can be found attached in several different ways, from the top () or the bottom (). From these shapes, finally, the modern form of sampi emerges, beginning in the 9th century, with the two straight lines becoming more or less parallel (, , ).

In medieval western manuscripts describing the Greek alphabet, the arrowhead form is sometimes rendered as .

==Origins==

Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, many authors have assumed that sampi was essentially a historical continuation of the archaic letter &quot;san&quot; (), the M-shaped alternative of &quot;sigma&quot; (Σ) that formed part of the Greek alphabet when it was originally adopted from Phoenician. Archaic san stood in an alphabetic position between &quot;pi&quot; (Π) and &quot;koppa&quot; (Ϙ). It dropped out of use in favour of &quot;sigma&quot; in most dialects by the 7th century BC, but was retained in place of the latter in a number of local alphabets until the 5th century BC. It is generally agreed to be derived from Phoenician &quot;tsade&quot;.

The hypothetical identification between san and sampi is based on a number of considerations. One is the similarity of the sounds represented by both. San represented either simple or some other, divergent phonetic realization of the common Greek phoneme. Suggestions for its original sound value have included , , and . The second reason for the assumption is the systematicity in the development of the letter inventory: there were three archaic letters that dropped out of use in alphabetic writing (&quot;digamma/wau&quot;, &quot;koppa&quot;, and san), and three extra-alphabetic letters were adopted for the Milesian numeral system, two of them obviously identical with the archaic digamma and koppa; hence, it is easy to assume that the third in the set had the same history. Objections to this account have been related to the fact that sampi did not assume the same position san had had, and to the lack of any obvious relation between the shapes of the two letters and the lack of any intermediate forms linking the two uses.

Among older authorities, Gardthausen and Thompson took the identity between san and sampi for granted. Foat, in a skeptical reassessment of the evidence, came to the conclusion that it was a plausible hypothesis but unprovable. The discussion has continued until the present, while a steady trickle of new archaeological discoveries regarding the relative dating of the various events involved (i.e. the original emergence of the alphabet, the loss of archaic san, the emergence of alphabetic sampi, and the emergence of the numeral system) have continued to affect the data base on which it is founded.

A part of the discussion about the identity of san and sampi has revolved around a difficult and probably corrupted piece of philological commentary by an anonymous scholiast, which has been debated ever since Joseph Justus Scaliger drew attention to it in the mid-17th century. Scaliger&#x27;s discussion also contains the first known attestation of the name &quot;san pi&quot; (sampi) in the western literature, and the first attempt at explaining it. The passage in question is a &quot;scholion&quot; on two rare words occurring in the comedies of Aristophanes, &quot;koppatias&quot; () and &quot;samphoras&quot; (). Both were names for certain breeds of horses, and both were evidently named after the letter used as a branding mark on each: &quot;koppa&quot; and &quot;san&quot; respectively. After explaining this, the anonymous scholiast adds a digression that appears to be meant to further explain the name and function of &quot;san&quot;, drawing some kind of link between it and the numeral sign of 900. However, what exactly was meant here is obscure now, because the text was evidently corrupted during transmission and the actual symbols cited in it were probably exchanged. The following is the passage in the reading provided by a modern edition, with problematic words marked:

There is no agreement on what was originally meant by this passage. While Scaliger in the 17th century believed that the scholiast spoke of &quot;san&quot; as a synonym for &quot;sigma&quot;, and meant to describe the (modern) shape of sampi (ϡ) as being composed of an inverted lunate sigma and a π, the modern editor D. Holwerda believes the scholiast spoke of the actual M-shaped san and expressed a belief that modern sampi was related to it.

An alternative hypothesis to that of the historical identity between san and sampi is that Ionian sampi may have been a loan from the neighbouring Anatolian language Carian, which formed the local substrate in the Ionian colonies of Asia Minor. This hypothesis is mentioned by Jeffery and has been supported more recently by Genzardi 
Brixhe suggested that sampi could be related to the Carian letter 25 &quot;&quot;, transcribed as &quot;ś&quot;. This would fit in with the &quot;plausible, but not provable&quot; hypothesis that the root contained in the Carian-Greek names spelled with sampi, &quot;Πανυασσις&quot; and &quot;Οασσασσις&quot;, is identical with a root *&quot;uś-/waś-&quot; identified elsewhere in Carian, which contains the Carian &quot;ś&quot; sound spelled with . Adiego follows this with the hypothesis that both the Carian letter and sampi could ultimately go back to Greek Ζ (). Like the san–sampi hypothesis, the Carian hypothesis remains an open and controversial issue, especially since the knowledge of Carian itself is still fragmentary and developing.

While the origin of sampi continues to be debated, the identity between the alphabetic Ionian sampi () and the numeral for 900 has rarely been in doubt, although in the older literature it was sometimes mentioned only tentatively, An isolated position was expressed in the early 20th century by Jannaris, who – without mentioning the alphabetic use of Ionian – proposed that the shape of numeric sampi was derived from a juxtaposition of three &quot;T&quot;s, i.e. 3×300=900. (He also rejected the historical identity of the other two numerals, stigma (6) and koppa (90), with their apparent alphabetic predecessors.) Today, the link between alphabetic and numeral sampi is universally accepted.

==Names== 
Despite all uncertainties, authors who subscribe to the hypothesis of a historical link between ancient san and sampi also often continue to use the name &quot;san&quot; for the latter. Benedict Einarson hypothesizes that it was in fact called *&quot;ssan&quot;, with the special quality of the sibilant sound it had as Ionian . This opinion has been rejected as phonologically impossible by Soldati, who points out that the sound only ever occurred in the middle of words and therefore could not have been used in the beginning of its own name.

As for the name &quot;sampi&quot; itself, it is generally agreed today that it is of late origin and not the original name of the character in either its ancient alphabetic or its numeral function. Babiniotis describes it as &quot;medieval&quot;, while Jannaris places its emergence &quot;after the thirteenth century&quot;. However, the precise time of its emergence in Greek is not documented.

The name is already attested in manuscript copies of an Old Church Slavonic text describing the development of the alphabet, the treatise &quot;On Letters&quot; ascribed to the 9th-century monk Hrabar, which was written first in Glagolitic and later transmitted in the Cyrillic script. In one medieval Cyrillic group of manuscripts of this text, probably going back to a marginal note in an earlier Glagolitic version, the letter names &quot;sampi&quot; (&quot;&quot;) and &quot;koppa&quot; (&quot;&quot;) are used for the Greek numerals. Witnesses of this textual variant exist from c.1200, but its archetype can be dated to before 1000 AD.

The first reference to the name &quot;sampi&quot; in the western literature occurs in a 17th-century work, Scaliger&#x27;s discussion of the Aristophanes scholion regarding the word &quot;samphoras&quot; (see above). Some modern authors, taking Scaliger&#x27;s reference as the first known use and unaware of earlier attestations, have claimed that the name itself only originated in the 17th century and/or that Scaliger himself invented it. A related term was used shortly after Scaliger by the French author Montfaucon, who called the sign &quot;&quot; (&quot;antisigma-pi&quot;), &quot;because the Greeks regarded it as being composed of an inverted &quot;sigma&quot;, which is called , and from &quot; (&quot;Graeci putarunt ex inverso sigma, quod vocatur, et ex compositum esse&quot;).

The etymology of &quot;sampi&quot; has given rise to much speculation. The only element all authors agree on is that the &quot;-pi&quot; refers to the letter π, but about the rest accounts differ depending on each author&#x27;s stance on the question of the historical identity between sampi and san.

According to the original suggestion by Scaliger, &quot;san-pi&quot; means &quot;written like a &quot;san&quot; and a &quot;pi&quot; together&quot;. Here, &quot;san&quot; refers not to the archaic letter san (i.e. Ϻ) itself, but to &quot;san&quot; as a mere synonym of &quot;sigma&quot;, referring to the outer curve of the modern ϡ as resembling an inverted lunate sigma. This reading is problematic because it fits the shape only of the modern (late Byzantine) sampi but presupposes active use of an archaic nomenclature that had long since lost currency by the time that shape emerged. According to a second hypothesis, &quot;san-pi&quot; would originally have meant &quot;the &quot;san&quot; that stands next to &quot;pi&quot; in the alphabet&quot;. This proposal thus presupposes the historical identity between sampi and ancient san (Ϻ), which indeed stood behind Π. However, this account too is problematic as it implies a very early date of the emergence of the name, since after the archaic period the original position of san was apparently no longer remembered, and the whole point of the use of sampi in the numeral system is that it stands somewhere else. Yet a different hypothesis interprets &quot;san-pi&quot; in the sense of &quot;the &quot;san&quot; that resembles &quot;pi&quot;&quot;. This is usually taken as referring to the modern ϡ shape, presupposing that the name &quot;san&quot; alone had persisted from antiquity until the time the sign took that modern shape. None of these hypotheses has wide support today. The most commonly accepted explanation of the name today is that &quot;san pi&quot; () simply means &quot;like a &quot;pi&quot;&quot;, where the word &quot;san&quot; is unrelated to any letter name but simply the modern Greek preposition (&quot;like&quot;, from ancient Greek ).

In the absence of a proper name, there are indications that various generic terms were used in Byzantine times to refer to the sign. Thus, the 15th-century Greek mathematician Nikolaos Rabdas referred to the three numerals for 6, 90 and 900 as &quot;τὸ ἐπίσημον&quot;, &quot;τὸ ἀνώνυμον σημεῖον&quot; (&quot;the nameless sign&quot;, i.e. &quot;koppa&quot;), and &quot;ὁ καλούμενος χαρακτήρ&quot; (&quot;the so-called &quot;charaktir&quot;&quot;, i.e. just &quot;the character&quot;), respectively. The term &quot;ἐπίσημον&quot; (&quot;episēmon&quot;, literally &quot;outstanding&quot;) is today used properly as a generic cover term for all three extra-alphabetic numeral signs, but was used specifically to refer to 6 (i.e. &quot;digamma/stigma&quot;).

In some early medieval Latin documents from western Europe, there are descriptions of the contemporary Greek numeral system which imply that sampi was known simply by the Greek word for its numeric value, ἐννεακόσια (&quot;enneakosia&quot;, &quot;nine hundred&quot;). Thus, in &quot;De loquela per gestum digitorum&quot;, a didactic text about arithmetics attributed to the Venerable Bede, the three Greek numerals for 6, 90 and 900 are called &quot;episimon&quot;, &quot;cophe&quot; and &quot;enneacosis&quot; respectively. the latter two being evidently corrupted versions of &quot;koppa&quot; and &quot;enneakosia&quot;. An anonymous 9th-century manuscript from Rheinau Abbey has &quot;epistmon&quot; , &quot;kophe,&quot; and &quot;ennakose&quot;. Similarly, the &quot;Psalterium Cusanum&quot;, a 9th or 10th century bilingual Greek—Latin manuscript, has &quot;episimôn&quot;, &quot;enacôse&quot; and &quot;cophê&quot; respectively (with the latter two names mistakenly interchanged for each other.) Another medieval manuscript has the same words distorted somewhat more, as &quot;psima&quot;, &quot;coppo&quot; and &quot;enacos&quot;, Other, similar versions of the name include &quot;enacosin&quot; and &quot;niacusin&quot;, or the curious corruption &quot;sincope&quot;,

A curious name for sampi that occurs in one Greek source is &quot;παρακύϊσμα&quot; (&quot;parakyisma&quot;). It occurs in a &quot;scholion&quot; to Dionysius Thrax, where the three numerals are referred to as &quot;τὸ δίγαμμα καὶ τὸ κόππα καὶ τό καλούμενον παρακύϊσμα&quot;. The obscure word (&quot;… the so-called &quot;parakyisma&quot;&quot;) literally means &quot;a spurious pregnancy&quot;, from &quot;παρα-&quot; and the verb &quot;κυέω&quot; &quot;to be pregnant&quot;. The term has been used and accepted as possibly authentic by Jannaris, Uhlhorn and again by Soldati. While Jannaris hypothesizes that it was meant to evoke the oblique, reclining shape of the character, Soldati suggests it was meant to evoke its status as an irregular, out-of-place addition (&quot;un&#x27;utile superfetazione&quot;). Einarson, however, argues that the word is probably the product of textual corruption during transmission in the Byzantine period. He suggests that the original reading was similar to that used by Rabdas, &quot;ὁ καλούμενος χαρακτήρ&quot; (&quot;the so-called character&quot;). Another contemporary cover term for the extra-alphabetic numerals would have been &quot;παράσημον&quot; (&quot;parasēmon&quot;, lit. &quot;extra sign&quot;). A redactor could have written the consonant letters &quot;π-σ-μ&quot; of &quot;παράσημον&quot; over the letters &quot;χ-κτ-ρ&quot; of &quot;χαρακτήρ&quot;, as both words happen to share their remaining intermediate letters. The result, mixed together from letters of both words, could have been misread in the next step as &quot;παρακυησμ&quot;, and hence, &quot;παρακύϊσμα&quot;.

An entirely new proposal has been made by A. Willi, who suggests that the original name of the letter in ancient Greek was &quot;angma&quot; (). This proposal is based on a passage in a Latin grammarian, Varro, who uses this name for what he calls a &quot;25th letter&quot; of the alphabet. Varro himself is clearly not referring to sampi, but is using &quot;angma&quot; to refer to the &quot;ng&quot; sound in words like &quot;angelus&quot;. However, Varro ascribes the use of the name &quot;angma&quot; to an ancient Ionian Greek author, Ion of Chios. Willi conjectures that Varro misunderstood Ion, believing the name &quot;angma&quot; referred to the sound because that sound happened to occur in the name itself. However, Ion, in speaking of a &quot;25th letter of the alphabet&quot;, meant not just a different pronunciation of some other letters but an actual written letter in its own right, namely sampi. According to Willi&#x27;s hypothesis, the name &quot;angma&quot; would have been derived from the verbal root *&quot;ank-&quot;, &quot;to bend, curve&quot;, and referred to a &quot;crooked object&quot;, used because of the hook-like shape of the letter.

==In other scripts==

In the Greco–Iberian alphabet, used during the 4th century BC in eastern Spain to write the Iberian language (a language unrelated to Greek), sampi was adopted along with the rest of the Ionian Greek alphabet, as an alphabetic character to write a second sibilant sound distinct from sigma. It had the shape , with three vertical lines of equal length.
Its pronunciation is uncertain, but it is transliterated as .

The Greek script was also adapted in Hellenistic times to write the Iranian language Bactrian, spoken in today&#x27;s Afghanistan. Bactrian used an additional letter &quot;sho&quot;(Ϸ), shaped like the later (unrelated) Germanic letter &quot;thorn&quot; (Þ), to denote its &quot;sh&quot; sound (&quot;š&quot;, ). This letter, too, has been hypothesized to be a continuation of Greek sampi, and/or san.

During the first millennium AD, several neighboring languages whose alphabets were wholly or partly derived from the Greek adopted the structure of the Greek numeral system, and with it, some version or local replacement of sampi.

In Coptic, the sign &quot;Ⳁ&quot; (, which has been described as &quot;the Greek with a Ρ above&quot;), was used for 900. Its numeric role was subsequently taken over by the native character Ϣ (&quot;shei&quot;, ), which is related to the Semitic tsade (and thus, ultimately, cognate with Greek san as well).

The Gothic alphabet adopted sampi in its Roman-era form of an upwards-pointing arrow (, 𐍊)

In the Slavic writing system Glagolitic, the letter (&quot;tse&quot;, ) was used for 900. It too may have been derived from a form of the Hebrew tsade. In Cyrillic, in contrast, the character (&quot;small yus&quot;, ) was used initially, being the one among the native Cyrillic letters that resembled sampi most closely in shape. However, the letter (&quot;tse&quot;), the equivalent of the Glagolitic sign, took its place soon later. It has been proposed that sampi was retained in its alternative function of denoting multiplication by thousand, and became the Cyrillic &quot;thousands sign&quot; .

In Armenian, the letter Ջ (&quot;ǰ&quot;) stands for 900, while Ք (&quot;kʿ&quot;), similar in shape to the Coptic sign, stands for 9000.

==Modern use==
Together with the other elements of the Greek numeral system, sampi is occasionally still used in Greek today. However, since the system is typically used only to enumerate items in relatively small sets, such as the chapters of a book or the names of rulers in a dynasty, the signs for the higher tens and hundreds, including sampi, are much less frequently found in practice than the lower letters for 1 to 10. One of the few domains where higher numbers including thousands and hundreds are still expressed in the old system in Greece with some regularity is the field of law, because until 1914 laws were numbered in this way. For instance, one law which happens to have sampi in its name and is still in force and relatively often referred to is &quot;Νόμος ͵ΓϠΝʹ/1911&quot; (i.e. Law Number 3950 of 1911), &quot;Περί της εκ των αυτοκινήτων ποινικής και αστικής ευθύνης&quot; (&quot;About penal and civil responsibility arising from the use of automobiles&quot;). However, in informal practice, the letter sampi is often replaced in such instances by a lowercase or uppercase π.

==Typography==

With the advent of modern printing in the western Renaissance, printers adopted the minuscule version of the numeral sign, ϡ, for their fonts. The typographic realization of Sampi has varied widely throughout its history in print, and a large range of different shapes can still be found in current electronic typesetting. Commonly used forms range from small, π-like shapes () to shapes with large swash curves (), while the stems can be almost upright () or almost horizontal (). More rarely, one can find shapes with the lower end curving outwards, forming an &quot;s&quot; curve ().

In its modern use as a numeral (as with the other two &quot;episema&quot;, stigma and koppa) no difference is normally made in print between an upper case and lower case form; the same character is typically used in both environments. However, occasionally special typographic variants adapted to an upper case style have also been employed in print. The issue of designing such uppercase variants has become more prominent since the decision of Unicode to encode separate character codepoints for uppercase and lowercase sampi. Several different designs are currently found. Older versions of the Unicode charts showed a glyph with a crooked and thicker lower stem (). While this form has been adopted in some modern fonts, it has been replaced in more recent versions of Unicode with a simpler glyph, similar to the lowercase forms (). Many fonts designed for scholarly use have adopted an upright triangular shape with straight lines and serifs (), as proposed by the typographer Yannis Haralambous. Other versions include large curved shapes (), or an upright large π-like glyph with a long descending curve ().

The epigraphic ancient Ionian sampi is not normally rendered with the modern numeral character in print. In specialized epigraphical or palaeographic academic discussion, it is either represented by a glyph , or by a Latin capital serifed T as a makeshift replacement. As this character has in the past never been supported in normal Greek fonts, there is no typographical tradition for its uppercase and lowercase representation in the style of a normal text font. Since its inclusion in the Unicode character encoding standard, experimental typographical stylizations of a lowercase textual Sampi have been developed. The Unicode reference glyph for &quot;small letter archaic sampi&quot;, according to an original draft, was to have looked like the stem of a small τ with a square top at x height, but was changed after consultation with Greek typesetting experts. The glyph shown in current official code charts stands on the baseline and has an ascender slightly higher than cap height, but its stem has no serifs and is slightly curved leftwards like the descender of an ρ or β. Most type designers who have implemented the character in current fonts have chosen to design a glyph either at x height, or with a descender but no ascender, and with the top either square or curved (corresponding to ancient scribal practice.)

==Computer encoding==

Several codepoints for the encoding of sampi and its variants have been included in Unicode. As they were adopted successively in different versions of Unicode, their coverage in current computer fonts and operating systems is inconsistent as of 2010. U+03E0 (&quot;Greek letter Sampi&quot;) was present from version 1.1 (1993) and was originally meant to show the normal modern numeral glyph. The uppercase/lowercase contrast was introduced with version 3.0 (1999). As the existing code point had been technically defined as an uppercase character, the new addition was declared lowercase (U+03E1, &quot;Greek small letter Sampi&quot;). This has led to some inconsistency between fonts, because the glyph that was present at U+03E0 in older fonts is now usually found at U+03E1 in newer ones, while U+03E0 may have a typographically uncommon capital glyph.

New, separate codepoints for ancient epigraphic sampi, also in an uppercase and lowercase variant, were proposed in 2005, and included in the standard with version 5.1 (2008). They are meant to cover both the Ionian and Pamphylian , with the Ionian character serving as the reference glyph. As of 2010, these characters are not yet supported by most current Greek fonts. The Gothic &quot;900&quot; symbol was encoded in version 3.1 (2001), and Coptic sampi in version 4.1 (2005). Codepoints for the related Greek characters san and Bactrian &quot;sho&quot; were added in version 4.0 (2003).

Prior to Unicode, support for sampi in electronic encoding was marginal. No common 8-bit codepage for Greek (such as ISO 8859-7) contained sampi. However, lowercase and uppercase sampi were provided for by the ISO 5428:1984 &quot;Greek alphabet coded character set for bibliographic information interchange&quot;. In Beta code, lowercase and uppercase sampi are encoded as &quot;#5&quot; and &quot;*#5&quot; respectively. In the LaTeX typesetting system, the &quot;Babel&quot; package allows accessing lowercase and uppercase sampi through the commands &quot;\sampi&quot; and &quot;\Sampi&quot;. Non-Unicode (8-bit) fonts for polytonic Greek sometimes contained sampi mapped to arbitrary positions, but usually not as a casing pair. For instance, the &quot;WP Greek Century&quot; font that came with WordPerfect had sampi encoded as 0xFC, while the popular &quot;Wingreek&quot; fonts had it encoded as 0x22. No encoding system prior to Unicode 5.1 catered for archaic epigraphic sampi separately.

<text>Altocumulus () is a middle-altitude cloud genus that belongs mainly to the physical category, characterized by globular masses or rolls in layers or patchesthe individual elements being larger and darker than those of cirrocumulus and smaller than those of stratocumulus. However, if the layers become tufted in appearance due to increased airmass instability, then the altocumulus clouds become more purely &quot;cumuliform&quot; in structure. Like other cumuliform and stratocumuliform clouds, altocumulus signifies convection. A sheet of partially conjoined altocumulus perlucidus is sometimes found preceding a weakening warm front, where the altostratus is starting to fragment, resulting in patches of altocumulus perlucidus between the areas of altostratus. Altocumulus is also commonly found between the warm and cold fronts in a depression, although this is often hidden by lower clouds.

Towering altocumulus, known as altocumulus castellanus, frequently signals the development of thunderstorms later in the day, as it shows instability and convection in the middle levels of the troposphere, the area where towering cumulus clouds can turn into cumulonimbus. It is therefore one of three warning clouds often recorded by the aviation industry, the other two being towering cumulus and cumulonimbus. Altocumulus generally forms at about above ground level, a similar level to altostratus formations, and satellite photography reveals that the two types of cloud can create formations that can stretch for thousands of square miles. Extensive altocumulus formations, particularly if they take the form of undulatus, are often referred to as altocumulus mackerel sky.

==Subtypes==

:*Species: Altocumulus has four species. The stratiformis species (Ac str) is composed of sheets or relatively flat patches of stratocumuliform cloud. The synoptic coding is determined by the predominant variety or occasionally by the genitus mother cloud. Altocumulus lenticularis (Ac len lenticular cloud) is a lens-shaped middle cloud which can resemble flying saucers and may occasionally be mistaken for &quot;unidentified flying objects&quot;. This is formed by uplift usually associated with mountains. but usually with at least some grey shading. It is coded CM4 on the SYNOP weather observation. Grey shading is also seen with altocumulus castellanus (Ac cas), a turreted middle cloud that can achieve significant vertical development and signals increasing air mass instability. It is nevertheless usually classified as middle rather than vertical and is coded CM8. The floccus species (Ac flo) is a tufted middle cloud which is also associated with greater instability. It shares the same code CM8. Chaotic altocumulus, which is typically poorly defined with multiple species or transitional forms arranged in several layers, is coded CM9.
::*Opacity-based varieties: Altocumulus stratiformis has three opacity-based varieties; &quot;Translucidus&quot; (CM3), &quot;perlucidus&quot; (CM3 or 7 depending on predominant opacity), and &quot;opacus&quot; (CM7). Varieties based on opacity are not commonly associated with the species lenticularis, castellanus, or floccus.
::*Pattern-based varieties: &quot;Radiatus&quot; (arranged in parallel bands) is sometimes seen with the stratformis and castellanus species. Altocumulus stratiformis radiatus of any opacity is coded CM5 if it is increasing in amount. The &quot;duplicatus&quot; or &quot;undulatus&quot; varieties are occasionally seen with the stratiformis and lenticularis species. Altocumulus stratiformis duplicatus is coded CM7 if it is not overridden by another coding of higher importance. &quot;Lacunosus&quot; is very occasionally associated with altocumulus of the species stratiformis, castellanus, or floccus.
:::*Precipitation-based supplementary feature: Altocumulus often produces virga but usually not precipitation that reaches the ground.
:::*Cloud-based supplementary feature: Mamma caused by localized downdrafts in the cloud layer are occasionally seen with altocumulus. A newly recognized type is the asperitas feature that is characterized by chaotic undulations caused by severe wind shear.

:::*Genitus Mother clouds: Altocumulus stratiformis cumulogenitus or cumulonimbogenitus can form when the middle or upper part of a towering free convective cloud begins to spread horizontally due to a loss of convective lift. It is coded CM6.
:::*Mutatus mother clouds: Altocumulus can form due to the complete transformation of cirrocumulus, altostratus, nimbostratus, or stratocumulus.

<text>Altostratus is a middle-altitude cloud genus made up of water droplets, ice crystals, or a mixture of the two. Altostratus clouds are formed when large masses of warm, moist air rise, causing water vapor to condense. Altostratus clouds are usually gray or blueish featureless sheets, although some variants have wavy or banded bases. The sun can be seen through thinner altostratus clouds, but thicker layers can be quite opaque.

Altostratus clouds usually predict the arrival of warm fronts. Once altostratus clouds associated with a warm front arrive, continuous rain or snow will usually follow in the next 12 to 24 hours. Although altostratus clouds predict the arrival of warmer, wetter weather, they themselves do not produce significant precipitation. Thunderstorms can be embedded in altostratus clouds, however, bringing showers.

Because altostratus clouds can contain ice crystals, they can produce some optical phenomena like iridescence and coronas.

== Description ==

Altostratus clouds are generally gray or blue-tinged with a largely-uniform blanket-like appearance. They do not have distinct features, and usually do not produce precipitation. The name &quot;altostratus&quot; comes from the conjugation of the Latin words &quot;altum&quot;, meaning &quot;high&quot;, and &quot;stratus&quot;, meaning &quot;flat&quot; or &quot;spread out&quot;. Altostratus clouds can produce virga, causing the cloud base to appear hazy. While they do not produce significant precipitation, altostratus clouds can cause light sprinkles or even small rain showers. Consistent rainfall and lowering of the cloud base causes altostratus to become nimbostratus.

Unlike most other types of clouds, altostratus clouds are not subdivided into cloud species due to their largely-featureless appearance. However, they still appear in five varieties: &quot;Altostratus duplicatus&quot;, &quot;opacus&quot;, &quot;radiatus&quot;, &quot;translucidus&quot;, and &quot;undulatus&quot;. &quot;Altostratus duplicatus&quot; is a rare form of altostratus clouds composed of two or more layers of cloud. &quot;Translucidus&quot; is a translucent form of altostratus clouds, meaning that the sun or moon can be seen through the cloud, whereas the &quot;opacus&quot; variety is opaque. &quot;Radiatus&quot; is another rare variety. It has parallel bands of cloud that stretch toward the horizon. The &quot;undulatus&quot; variety has an wavy appearance—the underside of the cloud appears to rise and fall.

Altostratus and altocumulus clouds, both of which are mid-level clouds, are commonly measured together in cloud cover studies. Together, they cover around 25% of the Earth&#x27;s surface on average based on CALIPSO satellite data. This constitutes roughly one third of the Earth&#x27;s total cloud cover. By itself, separated from altocumulus, altostratus covers ~16% of the Earth&#x27;s surface. Altostratus cloud cover varies seasonally in temperate regions, with significantly less coverage in the summer months as compared to the other seasons. Additionally, altostratus cloud cover varies by latitude, with tropical regions having vastly fewer altostratus clouds when compared to temperate or polar regions. Altostratus and altocumulus cover roughly 22% of the ocean&#x27;s surface based on surface measurements, with minimal variation based on season.

Altostratus clouds are warmest at the bottom and coldest at the top, with a fairly consistent lapse rate of 5 to 7 °C per kilometer (14 to 20 °F per mile) inside the cloud. The lapse rate is the rate at which the temperature decreases with altitude. Higher lapse rates (i.e. the faster temperature drops with increasing altitude) were associated with colder clouds. The average temperature of altostratus clouds, based on data collected from roughly 45° to 80° latitude, varied from around . Warmer temperatures occurred during summer and colder temperatures during winter.

Inside altostratus clouds, the relative humidity is generally greatest towards the top of the cloud decreasing slowly and roughly linearly towards the bottom. The lowest part of the cloud has the lowest relative humidity. Below the bottom of the cloud, the relative humidity drops rapidly.

=== Microphysical properties ===
Altostratus can be composed of water droplets, supercooled water droplets, and ice crystals, but ice crystals make up the vast majority. In some altostratus clouds made of ice crystals, very thin horizontal sheets of water droplets can appear seemingly at random, but they quickly disappear. The sizes of the ice crystals in the cloud tended to increase as altitude decreased. However, close to the bottom of the cloud, the particles decreased in size again. During the sampling of one cloud, the scientists noted a halo while flying near the top of the cloud, which indicated that the ice crystals were hexagonal near the top. However, farther down, the ice crystals became more conglomerated. Mixed-phase (containing both ice and water) altostratus clouds contain a &quot;melt layer&quot;, below which the ice crystals tend to melt into water droplets. These water droplets are spheres and thus fall much faster than ice crystals, collecting at the bottom of the cloud.

== Formation ==

Altostratus clouds form when a large mass of warm air rises, causing water vapor in the atmosphere to condense onto nuclei (small dust particles), forming water droplets and ice crystals. These conditions usually happen at the leading edge of a warm front, where cirrostratus clouds thicken and lower until they transition into altostratus clouds. Alternatively, nimbostratus clouds can thin into altostratus. Altostratus can even form from the spreading of the upper anvil cloud or the middle column of a thunderstorm.

Altostratus clouds are mid-level clouds that form from above sea level in polar regions. In temperate regions, the ceiling increases drastically, allowing altostratus clouds to form between . In tropical regions, altostratus can reach even higher, forming from . They can range from in thickness and can cover hundreds of kilometers of the Earth&#x27;s surface.

== Use in forecasting ==

Altostratus clouds tend to form ahead of warm fronts or occluded fronts and herald their arrival. These warm fronts bring warmer air into the region. Occluded fronts form when a faster-moving cold front catches up to a warm front, and the temperature after the frontal system passes may rise or fall. As the frontal system approaches, cirrostratus clouds will thicken into altostratus clouds, which then gradually thicken further into nimbostratus clouds. If the frontal system is occluded, cumulonimbus clouds may also be present. Once the altostratus clouds have arrived, rain or snow will usually follow in the next 12 to 24 hours.

Instability in the atmosphere can embed thunderstorms in an altostratus cloud, although altostratus clouds themselves do not produce storms.

== Effects on climate ==
Globally, clouds reflect around 50 watts per square meter = .012 ^{\circ} C&lt;/math&gt;}} of short-wave solar radiation back into space, cooling the Earth by around , an effect largely caused by stratocumulus clouds. However, at the same time, they reflect around 30 watts per square meter of long-wave (infrared) black body radiation emitted by the Earth back to Earth&#x27;s surface, heating the Earth by around —a process called the greenhouse effect. Cirrus and altostratus clouds are the top two sources of this heating effect. This combination of heating and cooling sums out to a net loss of 20 watts per square meter globally, cooling the Earth by roughly .

Altostratus clouds are the only cloud genus besides cirrus clouds to exhibit a net global heating effect on Earth and its atmosphere; however, cirrus have a heating effect that is four times as potent as altostratus (2 watts per square meter versus only 0.5 watts per square meter).

== Optical phenomena ==
Altostratus clouds can produce bright halos when viewed from the air, but not when viewed from the ground. Halos can take the appearance of rings, arcs, or spots of white or multicolored light and are formed by the reflection and refraction of sunlight or moonlight shining through ice crystals in the cloud. Light diffraction through altostratus clouds can also produce coronas, which are small, concentric pastel-colored rings of light around the sun or moon. They can also be iridescent, with often-parallel bands of bright color projected on a cloud. Unlike the halos, the coronas and iridescence can be seen from Earth&#x27;s surface.

== Relation to other clouds ==
Altostratus and altocumulus clouds are the two genera of mid-level clouds that usually form between . These are given the prefix &quot;alto-&quot;. These clouds are formed from ice crystals, supercooled water droplets, or liquid water droplets.

Above the mid-level clouds are three different genera of high-level clouds, cirrus, cirrocumulus, and cirrostratus, all of which are given the prefix &quot;cirro-&quot;. High-level clouds usually form above . Cirrocumulus and cirrostratus are sometimes informally referred to as &quot;cirriform clouds&quot; because of their frequent association with cirrus.

Below the mid-level clouds are the low-level clouds, which usually form below and do not have a prefix. The two genera that are strictly low-level are stratus, and stratocumulus. These clouds are composed of water droplets, except during winter when they are formed of supercooled water droplets or ice crystals if the temperature at cloud level is below freezing. Three additional genera usually form in the low altitude range, but may be based at higher levels under conditions of very low humidity. They are the genera cumulus, and cumulonimbus, and nimbostratus. These are sometimes classified separately as clouds of vertical development, especially when their tops are high enough to be composed of supercooled water droplets or ice crystals.

=== Cirrostratus ===

Cirrostratus clouds can appear as a smooth veil in the sky or as a striated sheet. They are sometimes similar to altostratus and are distinguishable from the latter because the sun or moon is always clearly visible through transparent cirrostratus, in contrast to altostratus which tends to be opaque or translucent. Cirrostratus come in two species, &quot;fibratus&quot; and &quot;nebulosus&quot;. The ice crystals in these clouds vary depending upon the height in the cloud. Towards the bottom, at temperatures of around , the crystals tend to be long, solid, hexagonal columns. Towards the top of the cloud, at temperatures of around , the predominant crystal types are thick, hexagonal plates and short, solid, hexagonal columns. These clouds commonly produce halos, and sometimes the halo is the only indication that such clouds are present. They are formed by warm, moist air being lifted slowly to a very high altitude. When a warm front approaches, cirrostratus clouds become thicker and descend forming altostratus clouds, and rain usually begins 12 to 24 hours later.

=== Altocumulus ===
Altocumulus clouds are small patches or heaps of white or light gray cloud. Like altostratus, altocumulus are composed of a mixture of water droplets, supercooled water droplets, and ice crystals. Although altocumulus clouds are mid-level clouds that form at roughly the same altitude as altostratus clouds, their formation methods are completely different. Altocumulus forms from convective (rising) processes, whereas altostratus is usually formed by descending and thickening cirrostratus.

=== Stratus ===
Stratus are low-level clouds that are usually visually similar to altostratus. Stratus comes in two species: &quot;nebulosus&quot;, a largely-featureless flat gray cloud sheet, and &quot;fractus&quot;, shattered fragments of cloud often called &quot;scud&quot;. Opaque varieties of altostratus and &quot;stratus nebulosus&quot; clouds can be virtually indistinguishable from each other to the naked eye, to the point that the World Meteorological Organization suggests that one of the few ways to distinguish between these clouds is to check what types of clouds came before them. Altostratus clouds, because they tend to form from warm fronts, are usually preceded by high-level cirriform clouds. Stratus clouds tend to form by cooling air masses, often at night, and thus are not usually preceded by other types of clouds.

=== Nimbostratus ===

Nimbostratus are low-level (sometimes classified as vertical) rain-bearing stratus clouds. Unlike the sprinkles or light drizzles that altostratus or stratus can produce, nimbostratus produces heavy, continuous rain or snow. These clouds are thick and dark enough to entirely blot out the sun. Nimbostratus has no species or varieties. Like altostratus, nimbostratus clouds can be made of ice crystals, supercooled water droplets, or water droplets.

<doc id="166736" wikidata="Q40564" url="?curid=166736" title="Stratocumulus cloud">
<text>A stratocumulus cloud, occasionally called a cumulostratus, belongs to a genus-type of clouds characterized by large dark, rounded masses, usually in groups, lines, or waves, the individual elements being larger than those in altocumulus, and the whole being at a lower height, usually below . Weak convective currents create shallow cloud layers (see also: sea of clouds) because of drier, stable air above preventing continued vertical development. Historically, in English, this type of cloud has been referred to as a twain cloud for being a combination of two types of clouds.

==Description==
Stratocumulus clouds are rounded clumps or patches of white to dark gray clouds that normally form in groups. The individual cloud elements, which cover more than 5 degrees of arc each, can connect with each other and are sometimes arranged in a regular pattern.

===Occurrence===
Vast areas of subtropical and polar oceans are covered with massive sheets of stratocumulus. These may organize into distinctive patterns which are currently under active study. In subtropics, they cover the edges of the horse latitude climatological highs, and reduce the amount of solar energy absorbed in the ocean. When these drift over land the summer heat or winter cold is reduced. &#x27;Dull weather&#x27; is a common expression incorporated with overcast stratocumulus days, which usually occur either in a warm sector between a warm and cold front in a depression, or in an area of high pressure, in the latter case, sometimes persisting over a specific area for several days. If the air over land is moist and hot enough, stratocumulus may develop to various cumulus clouds, or, more commonly, the sheet of stratocumulus may become thick enough to produce some light rain. On drier areas they quickly dissipate over land, resembling cumulus humilis. This often occurs in late morning in areas under anticyclonic weather, the stratocumulus breaking up under the sun&#x27;s heat and often reforming again by evening as the heat of the sun decreases again.

===Precipitation===
Most often, stratocumulus produce no precipitation, and when they do, it is generally only light rain or snow. However, these clouds are often seen at either the front or tail end of worse weather, so they may indicate storms to come, in the form of thunderheads or gusty winds. They are also often seen underneath the cirrostratus and altostratus sheets that often precede a warm front, as these higher clouds decrease the sun&#x27;s heat and therefore convection, causing any cumulus clouds to spread out into stratocumulus clouds.

===Comparison with altocumulus===
Stratocumulus clouds are similar in appearance to altocumulus and can be mistaken for such. A simple test to distinguish these is to compare the size of individual masses or rolls: when pointing one&#x27;s hand in the direction of the cloud, if the cloud is about the size of the thumb, it is altocumulus; if it is the size of one&#x27;s fist, it is stratocumulus. This often does not apply when stratocumulus is of a broken, fractus form, when it may appear as small as altocumulus.

===Optical effects===
Stratocumulus clouds are the main type of cloud that can produce crepuscular rays. Thin stratocumulus clouds are also often the cause of corona effects around the Moon at night. All stratocumulus subtypes are coded CL5 except when formed from free convective mother clouds (CL4) or when formed separately from co-existing (CL8).

== Formation ==
Stratocumulus clouds usually form from the rising and breakup of a stratus cloud. They can also form from altostratus and nimbostratus clouds, either as evaporating precipitation condenses into a cloud or as the nimbostratus cloud itself thins and breaks up. If a cumulus cloud becomes flattened (for example, by wind shear or temperature inversion), it too can become a stratocumulus cloud.

== Species ==
Stratocumulus Stratiformis are extensive flat but slightly lumpy sheets that show only minimal convective activity.

Stratocumulus Lenticularis are separate flat elongated seed-shaped clouds. They are typical for polar countries or warmer climate during winter seasons. They also can be formed by winds passing hills or mountains, such as Foehn winds, and in this case they can be very regularly shaped.

Stratocumulus Castellanus have stronger convective activity due to the presence of increasingly unstable air. They are distinct from other stratocumulus by puffy tower-like formations atop the cloud layer. They look like cumulus congestus, but can be easily confused: &quot;towers&quot; of cumulus congestus grow above separate clouds, whereas in the case of stratocumulus castellanus, there is always a more or less defined layer of clouds. Stratocumulus castellanus may develop into cumulus congestus (and even further into cumulonimbus) under auspicious conditions. Any showers from stratocumulus castellanus are not usually as heavy as those from cumulus congestus.

== Opacity-based varieties ==
Stratocumulus Opacus is a dark layer of clouds covering entire sky without any break. However, the cloud sheet is not completely uniform, so that separate cloud bases still can be seen. This is the main precipitating type, however any rain is usually light. If the cloud layer becomes grayer to the point when individual clouds cannot be distinguished, stratocumulus turn into stratus clouds.

Stratocumulus Perlucidus is a layer of stratocumulus clouds with small spaces, appearing in irregular pattern, through which clear sky or higher clouds can be seen.

Stratocumulus Translucidus consist of separate groups of stratocumulus clouds, with a clear sky (or higher clouds) visible between them. No precipitation in most cases.

== Pattern-based varieties ==
Stratocumulus Undulatus clouds appear as nearly parallel waves, rolls or separate elongated clouds, without significant vertical development.

Stratocumulus Radiatus clouds appear as the same as stratocumulus undulatus, but stratocumulus undulatus move perpendicular to the wind shear, while stratocumulus radiatus move parallel to the wind shear.

Stratocumulus Duplicatus clouds appear as stratocumulus clouds with two or more layers or sheets. Stratocumulus duplicatus is common on species lenticularis or lenticular cloud.

Stratocumulus Lacunosus clouds are very uncommon. They only occur when there are localized downdrafts striking through the stratocumuliform cloud.

== Supplementary feature ==
Stratocumulus Mamma is a type of mammatus cloud.

Stratocumulus Asperitas is a rare, newly recognized supplementary feature that presents itself as chaotic, wavy undulations appearing in the base of a stratocumulus cloud cover. It is thought these clouds are formed by severe wind shear.

Stratocumulus Fluctus is also a rare, newly recognized supplementary feature in which short-lived &quot;sea waves&quot; form on top of a stratocumulus cloud, they are caused by wind speed and direction differences directly under and over the cloud.

== Precipitation-based supplementary features ==
Stratocumulus Virga is a form of precipitation that evaporates in mid-air and doesn&#x27;t reach the ground.

Stratocumulus Praecipitatio is a form of precipitation that reaches the ground as light rain or snow.

== Mother clouds ==
Stratocumulus Cumulomutatus the specific type of stratocumulus clouds, are flat and elongated. They form in the evening, when updrafts caused by convection decrease making cumulus clouds lose vertical development and spread horizontally. They also can occur under altostratus cloud preceding a warm or occluded front, when cumulus usually lose vertical development as the sun&#x27;s heat decreases. Like all other forms of stratocumulus apart from castellanus, they are also often found in anticyclones.

Stratocumulus Cumulogenitus out of cumulus or cumulonimbus clouds, disrupted by decreasing convection. During formation period, puffy tops of cumulus clouds can protrude from stratocumulus cumulogenitus for a relatively long time until they completely spread in horizontal direction. Stratocumulus cumulogenitus appear as lengthy sheet or as group of separate elongated cloud rolls or waves.

<doc id="166737" wikidata="Q202278" url="?curid=166737" title="Nimbostratus cloud">
<text>A nimbostratus cloud is a multilevel, , nearly uniform, and often dark-grey cloud that usually produces continuous rain, snow, or sleet, but no lightning or thunder.

Although it is usually a low-based stratiform cloud, it actually forms most commonly in the middle level of the troposphere and then spreads vertically into the low and high levels. Nimbostratus usually produces precipitation over a wide area.

The prefix &quot;&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;&quot;, which denotes &quot;dark cloud&quot;.

Downward-growing nimbostratus can have the same vertical extent as most large upward-growing cumulus, but its horizontal expanse tends to be even greater.

==Appearance==
Nimbostratus has a diffuse cloud base generally found anywhere from near surface in the low levels to about .in the middle level of the troposphere. Although usually dark at its base, it often appears illuminated from within to a surface observer. Though found worldwide, nimbostratus occurs more commonly in the middle latitudes. It is coded CM2 on the SYNOP report.

==Formation==
Nimbostratus occurs along a warm front or occluded front where the slowly rising warm air mass creates nimbostratus along with shallower stratus clouds producing less rain, these clouds being preceded by higher-level clouds such as cirrostratus and altostratus. Often, when an altostratus cloud thickens and descends into lower altitudes, it will become nimbostratus.

Nimbostratus, unlike cumulonimbus, is not associated with thunderstorms, however at an unusually unstable warm front caused as a result of the advancing warm air being hot, humid and unstable, cumulonimbus clouds may be embedded within the usual nimbostratus. Lightning from an embedded cumulonimbus cloud may interact with the nimbostratus but only in the immediate area around it. In this situation with lightning and rain occurring it would be hard to tell which type of cloud was producing the rain from the ground, however cumulonimbus tend to produce larger droplets and more intense downpours. The occurrence of cumulonimbus and nimbostratus together is uncommon, and usually only nimbostratus is found at a warm front and sometimes in cold front.

==Forecast==
Nimbostratus is generally a sign of an approaching warm or occluded front producing steady moderate precipitation, as opposed to the shorter period of typically heavier precipitation released by a cold-frontal cumulonimbus cloud. Precipitation may last for several days, depending on the speed of the frontal system. A nimbostratus virga cloud is the same as normal nimbostratus, but the rain or snow falls as virga which doesn&#x27;t reach the ground. Stratus or stratocumulus usually replace the nimbostratus after the passage of the warm or occluded front.

==Origin of name==
Under Luke Howard&#x27;s first systematized study of clouds, carried out in France in 1802, three general cloud &quot;forms&quot; were established based on appearance and characteristics of formation: &quot;cirriform,&quot; &quot;cumuliform&quot; and &quot;stratiform.&quot; These were further divided into upper and lower types depending on altitude. In addition to these three main types, Howard added two names to designate multiple cloud types joined together: &quot;cumulostratus,&quot; a blending of cumulus clouds and stratus layers, and &quot;nimbus,&quot; a complex blending of cirriform, cumuliform, and stratiform clouds with sufficient vertical development to produce significant precipitation.

Later, in the 20th century, an IMC commission for the study of clouds put forward a refined and more restricted definition of the genus nimbus, effectively reclassifying it as a stratiform cloud type. It was then renamed &quot;nimbostratus,&quot; and published with the new name in the 1932 edition of the &quot;International Atlas of Clouds and of States of the Sky&quot;. This left cumulonimbus as the only nimboform type as indicated by its root name.

==Subtypes and derivative types==
:*Species and varieties: Nimbostratus is very thick, opaque, and featureless, so this genus type is not subdivided into species or varieties.
:::*Precipitation-based supplementary features: Nimbostratus is a major precipitation cloud and produces the virga or precipitation features. The latter can achieve heavy intensity due to the cloud&#x27;s vertical depth.
:::*Accessory cloud: Nimbostratus pannus is an accessory cloud of nimbostratus that forms as a ragged layer in precipitation below the main cloud deck. Pannus is coded CL7.
:::*Genitus mother clouds: This genus type can form from cumulus and cumulonimbus.
:::*Mutatus mother clouds: Nimbostratus can form due to the complete transformation of altocumulus, altostratus and stratocumulus.

== Relation to other clouds ==
Multi-level nimbostratus is physically related to other stratiform genus-types by way of being non-convective in nature. However, the other sheet-like clouds usually each occupy only one or two levels at the same time. Stratus clouds are low-level and form from near ground level to at all latitudes. In the middle level are the altostratus clouds that form from to in polar areas, in temperate areas, and in tropical areas. Although altostratus forms mostly in the middle level of the troposphere, strong frontal lift can push it into the lower part of the high-level. The main high-level stratiform cloud is cirrostratus which is composed of ice crystals that often produce halo effects around the sun. Cirrostratus forms at altitudes of in high latitudes, in temperate latitudes, and in low, tropical latitudes. Of the non-stratiform clouds, cumulonimbus and cumulus congestus are the most closely related to nimbostratus because of their vertical extent and ability to produce moderate to heavy precipitation. The remaining cumuliform (cumulus) and stratocumuliform (stratocumulus, altocumulus, and cirrocumulus) clouds have the least in common with nimbostratus.

<doc id="166738" wikidata="Q14408" url="?curid=166738" title="Omicron">
<text>Omicron (, ; uppercase Ο, lowercase ο, ) is the fifteenth letter of the Greek alphabet. This letter is derived from the Phoenician letter ayin: . In classical Greek, omicron represented the close-mid back rounded vowel in contrast to &quot;omega&quot; which represented the open-mid back rounded vowel and the digraph &quot;ου&quot; which represented the long close-mid back rounded vowel . In modern Greek, both omicron and omega represent the mid back rounded vowel or . Letters that arose from omicron include Roman O and Cyrillic O and Ю. The word literally means &quot;little O&quot; (&quot;o mikron&quot;) as opposed to &quot;great O&quot; (&quot;ō mega&quot;). In the system of Greek numerals, omicron has a value of 70.

==Use==
In addition to its use as an alphabetic letter, omicron is occasionally used in technical notation, but its use is limited since both upper case and lower case (Ο ο) are indistinguishable from the Latin letter &quot;o&quot; (O o) and difficult to distinguish from the Arabic numeral &quot;zero&quot; (0).

===Mathematics===

The big-O symbol was introduced by Paul Bachmann in 1894 and popularized by Edmund Landau in 1909, originally standing for &quot;order of&quot; (&quot;Ordnung&quot;) and being thus a Latin letter, was apparently viewed by Donald Knuth in 1976 as a capital Omicron, probably in reference to his definition of the symbol (capital) Omega. Neither Bachmann nor Landau ever call it &quot;Omicron&quot;, and the word &quot;Omicron&quot; appears just once in Knuth&#x27;s paper: in the title.

===Greek numerals===

There were several systems for writing numbers in Greek; the most common form used in late classical era used omicron (either upper or lower case) to represent the value 70.

More generally, the letter omicron is used to mark the fifteenth ordinal position in any Greek-alphabet marked list. So, for example, in Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, when various points in a geometric diagram are marked with letters, it is effectively the same as marking them with numbers, each letter representing the number of its place in the standard alphabet.

===Astronomy===
Omicron is used to designate the fifteenth star in a constellation group, its ordinal placement an irregular function of both magnitude and position. Such stars include Omicron Andromedae, Omicron Ceti, and Omicron Persei.

In Claudius Ptolemy&#x27;s () &quot;Almagest&quot;, tables of sexagesimal numbers    are represented in the conventional manner for Greek numbers:
 . Since the letter omicron [which represents () in the standard system] is not used in sexagesimal, it is repurposed to represent an empty number cell. In some copies, zero cells were just left blank (nothing there, value is zero), but to avoid copying errors, positively marking a zero cell with omicron was preferred, for the same reason that blank cells in modern tables are sometimes filled-in with a long dash (—). Both an omicron and a dash imply that &quot;this is not a mistake, the cell is actually supposed to be empty&quot;. By coincidence, the ancient zero-value omicron () resembles a modern Hindu-Arabic zero ().

===Medicine ===

The World Health Organization (WHO) uses the Greek alphabet to describe variants of concern of SARS‑CoV‑2, the virus which causes COVID-19. On November 26, 2021, Omicron was assigned to the B.1.1.529 variant of concern.
==History==

In the earliest Greek inscriptions, only five vowel letters A E I O Y were used. Vowel length was undifferentiated, with O representing both the short vowel /o/ and the long vowels /o:/ and /ɔː/. Later, in classical Attic Greek orthography, the three vowels were represented differently, with O representing short /o/, the new letter Ω representing long /ɔː/, and the so-called &quot;spurious diphthong&quot; OY representing long /o:/.

Although the Greeks took the character O from the Phoenician letter &quot;`ayin&quot;, they did not borrow its Phoenician name. Instead, the name of the letter O in classical Attic times was simply the long version of its characteric sound: (pronounced /o:/) (that of Ω was likewise ).
By the second and third centuries CE, distinctions between long and short vowels began to disappear in pronunciation, leading to confusion between O and Ω in spelling. It was at this time that the new names of (&quot;small O&quot;) for O (&quot;great O&quot;) for Ω were introduced.
==Mispronunciation==
During the early outbreak of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, many people unfamiliar with the entire Greek alphabet (or simply lacking the ability to pronounce or sound out words using phonetics) mispronounced Omicron as &quot;Omnicron&quot; due to the unfamiliarity of the letter, and the use of the prefix &quot;Omni-&quot; in many words.

<text>Cirrocumulus is one of the three main genus types of high-altitude tropospheric clouds, the other two being cirrus and cirrostratus. They usually occur at an altitude of , however they can occur as low as in the arctic and weather reporting standards such as the Canadian MANOBS suggests heights of in summer and in winter. Like lower-altitude cumuliform and stratocumuliform clouds, cirrocumulus signifies convection. Unlike other high-altitude tropospheric clouds like cirrus and cirrostratus, cirrocumulus includes a small amount of liquid water droplets, although these are in a supercooled state. Ice crystals are the predominant component, and typically, the ice crystals cause the supercooled water drops in the cloud to rapidly freeze, transforming the cirrocumulus into cirrostratus. This process can also produce precipitation in the form of a virga consisting of ice or snow. Thus, cirrocumulus clouds are usually short-lived. They usually only form as part of a short-lived transitional phase within an area of cirrus clouds and can also form briefly as a result of the breaking up of part of a cumulonimbus anvil.

Properly, the term cirrocumulus refers to each cloud, but is typically also used to refer to an entire patch of cirrocumulus. When used in this way, each cirrocumulus element is referred to as a &quot;cloudlet&quot;.

==Appearance==

Cirrocumulus is a cloud of the &quot;stratocumuliform&quot; physical category that shows both stratiform and cumuliform characteristics and typically appears as white, patchy sheets with ripples or tufts without gray shading. Each cloudlet appears no larger than a finger held at arm&#x27;s length. These often are organized in rows like other cumuliform and stratocumuliform clouds, but since they are so small, cirrocumulus patches take on a finer appearance, sometimes also referred to colloquially as &quot;herringbone&quot; or as a &quot;mackerel sky&quot;. Cirrocumulus is coded CH9 for the main genus-type and all subforms.

Cirrocumulus is distinguished from altocumulus in several ways, although the two stratocumuliform genus types can occasionally occur together with no clear demarcation between them. Cirrocumulus generally occur at higher altitudes than altocumulus, thus the &quot;cloudlets&quot; appear smaller, as they are more distant from observation at ground level. They are also colder. Cirrocumulus clouds never cast self-shadows and are translucent to a certain degree. They are also typically found amongst other cirrus clouds in the sky and are usually themselves seen to be transforming into these other types of cirrus. This often occurs at the leading edge of a warm front, where many types of cirriform clouds can be present.
Cirrocumulus clouds tend to reflect the red and yellow colours during a sunset and sunrise, so they have been referred to as &quot;one of the most beautiful clouds&quot;. This occurs because they reflect the unscattered rays of light from the early morning or evening sun, and those rays are yellow, orange, red, and sometimes purple.

==Forecasting== 
Cirrocumulus usually only forms in patches. If it forms in patches with cirrus or cirrostratus and the clouds spread across the sky, it usually means rain in 8–10  hours (can be more if the front is slow-moving). Only small patches of cirrocumulus and perhaps some wisps of cirrus usually mean a continuation of good weather (although this may also be seen in conjunction with showers and thunderstorms). If it is seen after rain, it usually means improving the weather.

==Subtypes==
* Species: &quot;Cirrocumulus stratiformis&quot; (Cc str) is one of four species and appears in the form of relatively flat stratocumuliform sheets or patches. The species &quot;Cirrocumulus lenticularis&quot; (Cc len) takes its name from the lens-shaped structure of this cloud which is tapered at each end. &quot;Cirrocumulus castellanus&quot; (Cc cas) has cumuliform buildups that give the cloud a partly or mainly turreted appearance. When the cumuliform parts have more of a tufted appearance, it is given the species name &quot;Cirrocumulus floccus&quot; (Cc flo). Cirrocumulus with castellanus buildups can show some vertical extent, but are not usually classified as vertical or multi-étage clouds.
** Varieties: This genus type is always translucent and so has no opacity-based varieties. However, like cirrus, certain cirrocumulus species can sometimes be divided into pattern-based varieties. The &quot;undulatus&quot; variety has a wavy undulating base and is seen mostly with the stratiformis and lenticularis species types. The &quot;lacunosus&quot; variety contains circular holes caused by downdrafts in the cloud and is associated mainly with the species stratiformis, castellanus, and floccus.
*** Precipitation-based supplementary feature: Cirrocumulus occasionally produces &quot;virga&quot;, precipitation that evaporates before reaching the ground.
*** Cloud-based supplementary feature: &quot;Mamma&quot; in the form of downward forming bubbles is infrequently seen as a cloud-based supplementary feature.
*** Mother clouds: This genus type has no recognized genitus mother clouds. However cirrocumulus stratiformis &quot;cirromutatus&quot; or &quot;cirrostratomutatus&quot; can result from sheets or filaments of high cloud taking on a stratocumuli form structure as a result of high altitude convection. A high layer of white or light grey altocumulus of a particular species can thin out into pure white cirrocumulus &quot;altocumulomutatus&quot; of the same species.

<text>Cirrostratus is a high-altitude, very thin, generally uniform &quot;stratiform&quot; genus-type of cloud. It is made out of ice-crystals, which are pieces of frozen water. It is difficult to detect and it can make halos. These are made when the cloud takes the form of thin cirrostratus nebulosus. The cloud has a fibrous texture with no halos if it is thicker cirrostratus fibratus. On the approach of a frontal system, the cirrostratus often begins as nebulous and turns to fibratus. If the cirrostratus begins as fragmented of clouds in the sky it often means the front is weak. Cirrostratus is usually located above 5.5 km (18,000 ft). Its presence indicates a large amount of moisture in the upper troposphere. Clouds resembling cirrostratus occasionally form in polar regions of the lower stratosphere. Polar stratospheric clouds can take on this appearance when composed of tiny supercooled droplets of water or nitric acid.
Cirrostratus clouds sometimes signal the approach of a warm front if they form after cirrus and spread from one area across the sky, and thus may be signs that precipitation might follow in the next 12 to 24 hours or as soon as 6–8 hours if the front is fast moving. If the cirrostratus is broken fibratus, it can mean that the front is weak and that stratus rather than nimbostratus will be the precipitating cloud (meaning drizzle or snow grains instead of moderate rain or snow). Cumulus humilis or stratocumulus clouds are often found below cirrostratus formations, due to the stable air associated with cirrostratus creating an inversion and restricting convection, causing cumuliform clouds to become flattened. Contrails also tend to spread out and can be visible for up to an hour in cirrostratus.

The phrase &quot;milky sunshine&quot; is often, as well as referring to haze or light mist, used to refer to the milky look of the sky when cirrostratus is present.
:* Species: Cirrostratus &quot;fibratus&quot; (Cs fib) is a high fibrous sheet similar to cirrus but with less detached semi-merged filaments. It is reported in the SYNOP code as CH8 or as CH5 or 6 (depending on the amount of sky covered) if increasing in amount. If the high cloud covers the entire sky and takes on the form of a featureless veil, it is classified as cirrostratus of the species &quot;nebulosus&quot; (Cs neb) and is coded CH7.
::* Varieties: Cirrostratus species have no opacity-based varieties as they are always translucent. Two pattern-based varieties are sometimes seen with the species fibratus. These are the closely spaced &quot;duplicatus&quot; and wavy &quot;undulatus&quot; types similar to those seen with cirrus fibratus. Pattern-based varieties are not commonly associated with the species nebulosus due to its lack of features.
:::* Supplementary features: Cirrostratus produces no precipitation or virga, and is not accompanied by any accessory clouds.
:::* Genitus mother clouds: Cirrostratus fibratus &quot;cirrocumulogenitus&quot; sometimes appears as the latter cloud flattens and loses some of its stratocumuliform structure. Cirrostratus fibratus &quot;cumulonimbogenitus&quot; may form if the cirriform top of a mature thundercloud spreads and flattens sufficiently to become a high stratiform cloud.
:::* Mutatus mother clouds: Cirrostratus fibratus &quot;cirromutatus&quot; or &quot;cirrocumulomutatus&quot; are the result of a complete transformation from cirrus and cirrocumulus genus types. Cirrostratus nebulosis &quot;altostratomutatus&quot; results when a high grey nebulous altostratus layer thins out into a whitish layer of featureless high cloud.

<doc id="166742" wikidata="Q14406" url="?curid=166742" title="Xi (letter)">
<text>Xi ( or ; uppercase Ξ, lowercase ξ; ) is the fourteenth letter of the Greek alphabet, representing the voiceless consonant cluster . Its name is pronounced in Modern Greek. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 60. Xi was derived from the Phoenician letter samekh .

Xi is distinct from the letter chi, which gave its form to the Latin letter X.

==Greek ==

Both in classical Ancient Greek and in Modern Greek, the letter Ξ represents the consonant cluster /ks/. In some archaic local variants of the Greek alphabet, this letter was missing. Instead, especially in the dialects of most of the Greek mainland and Euboea, the cluster /ks/ was represented by Χ (which in classical Greek is chi, used for ).

Because this variant of the Greek alphabet was used in Magna Graecia (the Greek colonies in Sicily and the southern part of the Italian peninsula), the Latin alphabet borrowed Χ rather than Ξ as the Latin letter that represented the /ks/ cluster that was also present in Latin.

==Cyrillic==
The Xi was adopted into the early Cyrillic alphabet, as the letter ksi (Ѯ, ѯ).

<doc id="166745" wikidata="Q40526" url="?curid=166745" title="Stratus cloud">
<text>Stratus clouds are low-level clouds characterized by horizontal layering with a uniform base, as opposed to convective or cumuliform clouds formed by rising thermals. The term &quot;stratus&quot; describes flat, hazy, featureless clouds at low altitudes varying in color from dark gray to nearly white. The word &quot;stratus&quot; comes from the Latin prefix &quot;Strato-&quot;, meaning &quot;layer&quot;. Stratus clouds may produce a light drizzle or a small amount of snow. These clouds are essentially above-ground fog formed either through the lifting of morning fog or through cold air moving at low altitudes. Some call these clouds &quot;high fog&quot; for their fog-like form.

== Formation ==
Stratus clouds form when weak vertical currents lift a layer of air off the ground and it depressurizes, following the lapse rate. This causes the relative humidity to increase due to the adiabatic cooling. This occurs in environments where atmospheric &quot;stability&quot; is abundant.

== Description ==
Stratus clouds look like featureless gray to white sheets of cloud. They can be composed of water droplets, supercooled water droplets, or ice crystals depending upon the ambient temperature.

== Sub-forms ==

=== Species ===

Stratus nebulosus clouds appear as a featureless or nebulous veil or layer of stratus clouds with no distinctive features or structure. They are found at low altitudes, and are a good sign of atmospheric stability, which indicates continuous stable weather. Stratus nebulosus may produce light rain and drizzle or flakes of snow. Stratus fractus clouds on the other hand, appear with an irregular shape, and forms with a clearly fragmented or ragged appearance. They mostly appear under the precipitation of major rain-bearing clouds; these are nimbostratus and cumulonimbus clouds, and are classified as types of pannus clouds. Stratus fractus can also form beside mountain slopes, without the presence of nimbus clouds (clouds that precipitate), and their color can be from dark grey to almost white.

=== Opacity-based varieties ===
Stratus fractus are not divided into varieties, but stratus nebulosus on the other hand, are divided into two. The Stratus opacus variety appears as a nebulous or milky sheet of the nebulosus species, but are opaque enough to block the sun from view. Stratus Translucidus is another variety of the nebulosus species. These clouds are considered more thin than the opacus variety because this cloud is rather translucent, allowing the position of the Sun or Moon to be observed from Earth&#x27;s surface.

=== Pattern-based variety ===
Stratus clouds only have one pattern-based variety. This is the &quot;stratus undulatus&quot; variety. Mild can be observed from this cloud, only associated by the nebulosus species. Though rare, this cloud formation is caused by disturbances on the gentle wind shear. Stratus undulatus clouds are more common on stratus stratocumulomutatus clouds where the wind is stronger as height increases.
=== Genitus mother clouds ===
Stratus cumulogenitus clouds occur when the base of cumulus clouds spreads, creating a nebulous sheet of stratiform clouds. This can also occur on nimbostratus clouds (stratus nimbostratogenitus) and on cumulonimbus clouds (stratus cumulonimbogenitus). Stratus fractus clouds can also form under the base of precipitation-bearing clouds and are classified as pannus clouds. Stratus clouds may also form from formation mechanisms that are not typical for the cloud type, for example, Stratus homogenitus, which are stratus formed by human activity, Stratus cataractagenitus, which are formed from the spray of waterfalls, and Stratus silvagenitus, which are formed by evaporation or evapotranspiration occurring in a forest.

=== Mutatus mother cloud ===
Stratus only has one mutatus mother cloud. Stratus stratocumulomutatus clouds occur when stratocumulus opacus patches fuse to create a stratiform layer.

=== Accessory clouds and supplementary feature ===

Stratus clouds do not produce accessory clouds, but a supplementary feature praecipitatio is derived from Latin, which means &quot;precipitation&quot;. Stratus clouds are generally too low to produce virga, or rain shears that evaporate before reaching the ground, although higher stratus clouds can produce it.

== Forecast ==
A stratus cloud can form from stratocumulus spreading out under an inversion, indicating a continuation of prolonged cloudy weather with drizzle for several hours and then an improvement as it breaks into stratocumulus. Stratus clouds can persist for days in anticyclone conditions. It is common for a stratus to form on a weak warm front, rather than the usual nimbostratus.

=== Effects on climate ===
According to Sednev, Menon, and McFarquhar, Arctic stratus and other low-level clouds form roughly 50% of the annual cloud cover in Arctic regions, causing a large effect on the energy emissions and absorptions through radiation.

== Relation to other clouds ==

=== Cirrostratus clouds ===
Cirrostratus clouds, a very high ice-crystal form of stratiform clouds, can appear as a milky sheen in the sky or as a striated sheet. They are sometimes similar to altostratus and are distinguishable from the latter because the Sun or Moon is always clearly visible through transparent cirrostratus, in contrast to altostratus which tends to be opaque or translucent. Cirrostratus come in two species, &quot;fibratus&quot; and &quot;nebulosus&quot;. The ice crystals in these clouds vary depending upon the height in the cloud. Towards the bottom, at temperatures of around to , the crystals tend to be long, solid, hexagonal columns. Towards the top of the cloud, at temperatures of around to , the predominant crystal types are thick, hexagonal plates and short, solid, hexagonal columns. These clouds commonly produce halos, and sometimes the halo is the only indication that such clouds are present. They are formed by warm, moist air being lifted slowly to a very high altitude. When a warm front approaches, cirrostratus clouds become thicker and descend forming altostratus clouds, and rain usually begins 12 to 24 hours later.

=== Altostratus clouds ===
=== Nimbostratus clouds ===
=== Stratocumulus clouds ===
A stratocumulus cloud is another type of a cumuliform or stratiform cloud. Like stratus clouds, they form at low levels; but like cumulus clouds (and unlike stratus clouds), they form via convection. Unlike cumulus clouds, their growth is almost completely retarded by a strong inversion, causing them to flatten out like stratus clouds and giving them a layered appearance. These clouds are extremely common, covering on average around twenty-three percent of the Earth&#x27;s oceans and twelve percent of the Earth&#x27;s continents. They are less common in tropical areas and commonly form after cold fronts. Additionally, stratocumulus clouds reflect a large amount of the incoming sunlight, producing a net cooling effect. Stratocumulus clouds can produce drizzle, which stabilizes the cloud by warming it and reducing turbulent mixing.

<doc id="166747" wikidata="Q965888" url="?curid=166747" title="Carlos Vives">
<text>Carlos Alberto Vives Restrepo (born 7 August 1961) is a Colombian singer, songwriter and actor. He is known for his interpretation of traditional music styles of Colombia such as vallenato, cumbia, champeta, bambuco and porro as well as genres such as Latin pop, rock, reggaeton, dance-pop and tropical music. 

Having sold over 20 million records worldwide, Vives is one of the best-selling Latin music artists of all time. He is regarded as one of the most influential artists in the world as he has progressively helped vallenato gain popularity globally by combining traditional vallenato music with pop/rock music, forming a subgenre that has come to be known as &quot;vallenato-pop&quot;.

In 2019, Vives was selected as #45 on both the Greatest of All Time Latin Artists and Top Latin Artists 2010s. by Billboard. 

In 2024, the Latin Grammys honored Vives as Person of the Year during their annual ceremony for his contributions to the music of Latin America and community philanthropic endeavors both in Colombia and the wider Spanish speaking world. 

His hits include &quot;Matilde Lina&quot;, &quot;La Hamaca Grande&quot;, &quot;La Gota Fría&quot;, &quot;Alicia Adorada&quot; (all four of which are covers of classic vallenato songs), &quot;Pa&#x27; Mayte&quot;, &quot;La Tierra del Olvido&quot;, &quot;Tu Amor Eterno&quot;, &quot;Fruta Fresca&quot;, &quot;Déjame Entrar&quot;, &quot;Luna Nueva&quot;, &quot;Carito&quot;, &quot;Papadio&quot;, &quot;Como Tú&quot;, &quot;Décimas Del Parecido&quot; (a tribute to Guillermo Martínez, a Cuban-born radio host who resides in Mayagüez, and for whose program Vives was an occasional master control technician), &quot;Volví a Nacer&quot;, &quot;Robarte un Beso&quot;, (a collaborative effort with fellow Colombian singer Sebastián Yatra), &quot;La Bicicleta&quot; (a collaboration with Shakira) and &quot;Canción Bonita&quot; (collaborative effort with Ricky Martin).

Vives is also a successful actor. His roles as the titular character in the soap opera Gallito Ramírez and as Rafael Escalona in Escalona, a story about the famous Colombian composer of the same name, are among his most important and well-remembered appearances.

He has collaborated with multiple Colombian and international artists, including Silvestre Dangond, Juanes, Ricky Martin, Carín León, Camilo, Shakira, Maluma, Wisin, Daddy Yankee, Alejandro Sanz, Rozalén, Manuel Turizo, Ryan Castro, Sebastián Yatra, Mau y Ricky, Michel Teló, Gente de Zona, Thalía, Pedro Capó, Lalo Ebratt, Los Ángeles Azules, Fito Páez, Carlos Rivera, Play-N-Skillz, Mike Bahía, Nacho, Diego Torres, and American rapper Mac Miller, of which he has worked on his album &quot;The Divine Feminine&quot; (2016) as a recording engineer. 

In addition to his artistic endeavors, Vives is involved in various social and philanthropic activities. He has used his platform to support causes related to education, culture, and social development in Colombia. His foundation, Tras la Perla, focuses on improving the quality of life in his hometown of Santa Marta by promoting sustainable development and cultural initiatives.

==Early life==
Carlos Vives was born on 7 August 1961 in Santa Marta, Magdalena, Colombia, where he spent his first 12 years of life. At that age, he and his family moved to Bogotá in search of a better life. He enrolled at Jorge Tadeo Lozano University and holds a degree in Advertising from the university. In Bogotá, he also acquired a taste for rock, getting involved in the local music scene, and started playing in bars and cafés around the city.

==1982–1989==
In 1982, Vives began acting in a number of shows and telenovelas including &quot;Pequeños Gigantes&quot; (&quot;&quot;Little Giants&quot; – 1983) and &quot;Tuyo es Mi Corazón&quot; (&quot;Yours Is My Heart&quot;&quot; – 1985). He finally found fame in 1986 by playing the title role of &quot;Gallito Ramírez&quot;, which told the story of a Colombian Caribbean coast boxer who falls in love with an uptight girl, who was portrayed by his first wife, Margarita Rosa de Francisco. That same year, he released his first album, Por Fuera y Por Dentro. The album, primarily made of ballads, failed to gain any success. 
In 1987, he released his second ballad album, No Podrás Escapar de Mí. Though the title track reached No. 30 on the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks, the album did not sell well. His next album, Al Centro de la Ciudad, would become his last album to feature synthesizer-romantic ballads. Some of the songs got some attention being featured in telenovelas, but the album, just as its predecessors, failed to gain success.

In 1989, he was offered an acting job in Puerto Rico, and upon moving, he took a break in his music career. He is remembered for his leading roles in the soaps La Otra and Aventurera. He married Herlinda Gómez, his second wife (they have since divorced). Vives would spend his time between Colombia, Miami and the city of Mayagüez, Herlinda&#x27;s hometown, during his marriage to her.

==Since 1991==

Upon his return to Colombia in 1991, he was offered a TV role that would change his life forever. He was cast in the leading role of a fantasy series based on the life of vallenato composer Rafael Escalona unsurprisingly titled &quot;Escalona&quot;. He sang the composer&#x27;s songs in the series, and that&#x27;s when he retooled his career towards vallenato, gaining national success with the release of the Telenovela&#x27;s two soundtrack albums, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

In 1993, backed by the band &quot;La Provincia&quot;, Vives released the album Clásicos de la Provincia in which he started fusing vallenato with rock, pop and other Caribbean Colombian ethnic rhythms. This fusion scandalized vallenato purists. &quot;Clásicos de la Provincia&quot;, won the Billboard Latin Music Awards Best Album, introducing vallenato to both Colombia and the rest of the world.

The follow-up album, &quot;La Tierra del Olvido&quot; would mark a further step in Vives&#x27; desire to fusion rock, funk and pop music with traditional Colombian genres. The album gave Vives classic hits such as the title track, and the up-tempo opening track &quot;Pa&#x27; Mayte&quot;.

His subsequent releases, &quot;Tengo Fé&quot; (1997), &quot;El Amor de Mi Tierra&quot; (1999), &quot;Déjame Entrar&quot; (2001) and &quot;El Rock de Mi Pueblo&quot; (2004), were all commercially successful and were well received by critics. In 2002 Carlos Vives&#x27; album &quot;Déjame Entrar&quot; won him his first Grammy award for Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album.

In 2009 he released the album &quot;Clásicos de la Provincia II&quot;, which was sold exclusively in Colombian supermarket chain &quot;Almacenes Éxito.&quot; The album saw Vives&#x27; return to covering vallenato songs in his own style.

In November 2021, he was a featured artist in the Disney movie &#x27;Encanto&#x27; singing the credits song &#x27;Colombia, Mi Encanto&#x27; written by Lin-Manuel Miranda.

In 2023, Vives appeared in the Disney+ show &#x27;The Low Tone Club&#x27; and sang the theme &#x27;Tumbando Muros&#x27; and two other songs for the show. In addition, Vives wrote all songs included on the show&#x27;s soundtrack.

<doc id="166751" wikidata="Q9902" url="?curid=166751" title="Mu (letter)">
<text>Mu (; uppercase Μ, lowercase μ; Ancient Greek , or μυ—both ) is the twelfth letter of the Greek alphabet, representing the voiced bilabial nasal . In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 40. Mu was derived from the Egyptian hieroglyphic symbol for water, which had been simplified by the Phoenicians and named after their word for water, to become 𐤌 (mem). Letters that derive from mu include the Roman M and the Cyrillic М, though the lowercase resembles a small Latin U (u).
==Names==

===Ancient Greek===
In Greek, the name of the letter was written and pronounced .

===Modern Greek===
In Modern Greek, the letter is spelled and pronounced . In polytonic orthography, it is written with an acute accent: .

==Use as symbol==
The lowercase letter mu (μ) is used as a special symbol in many academic fields. Uppercase mu is not used, because it appears identical to Latin M.

===Prefix for units of measurement===
&quot;μ&quot; is used as a unit prefix denoting a factor of 10−6 (one millionth), in this context, the symbol&#x27;s name is &quot;micro&quot;.
* Metric prefix
* International System of Units prefix, also known as &quot;SI prefix&quot;
* The micrometre with a symbol of &quot;μm&quot; can also be referred to as the non-SI term &quot;micron&quot;.

===Mathematics===

&quot;μ&quot; is conventionally used to denote certain things; however, any Greek letter or other symbol may be used freely as a variable name.
* a measure in measure theory
* minimalization in computability theory and Recursion theory
* the integrating factor in ordinary differential equations
* the degree of membership in a fuzzy set
* the Möbius function in number theory
* the population mean or expected value in probability and statistics
* the Ramanujan–Soldner constant

===Physics and engineering===
In classical physics and engineering:
* the coefficient of friction (also used in aviation as braking coefficient (see Braking action))
* reduced mass in the two-body problem
* Standard gravitational parameter in celestial mechanics
* linear density, or mass per unit length, in strings and other one-dimensional objects
* permeability in electromagnetism
* the magnetic dipole moment of a current-carrying coil
* dynamic viscosity in fluid mechanics
* the amplification factor or voltage gain of a triode vacuum tube
* the electrical mobility of a charged particle
* the rotor advance ratio, the ratio of aircraft airspeed to rotor-tip speed in rotorcraft
* the pore water pressure in saturated soil

In particle physics:
* the elementary particles called the muon and antimuon
* the proton-to-electron mass ratio

In thermodynamics:
* the chemical potential of a system or component of a system

=== Computer science ===
In evolutionary algorithms:
* μ, population size from which in each generation λ offspring will generate (the terms μ and λ originate from evolution strategy notation)

In type theory:
* Used to introduce a recursive data type. For example, formula_1 is the type of lists with elements of type formula_2 (a type variable): a sum of unit, representing , with a pair of a formula_2 and another formula_4 (represented by formula_5). In this notation, formula_6 is a binding form, where the variable (formula_5) introduced by formula_6 is bound within the following term (formula_9) to the term itself. Via substitution and arithmetic, the type expands to formula_10, an infinite sum of ever-increasing products of formula_2 (that is, a formula_12 is any formula_13-tuple of values of type formula_2 for any formula_15). Another way to express the same type is formula_16.

===Chemistry===
In chemistry:
* the prefix given in IUPAC nomenclature for a bridging ligand

===Biology===
In biology:
* the mutation rate in population genetics
* A class of Immunoglobulin heavy chain that defines IgM type Antibodies

===Pharmacology===
In pharmacology:
* an important opiate receptor

===Orbital mechanics===
In orbital mechanics:
* Standard gravitational parameter of a celestial body, the product of the gravitational constant &quot;G&quot; and the mass &quot;M&quot;
* planetary discriminant, represents an experimental measure of the actual degree of cleanliness of the orbital zone, a for defining a planet. The value of μ is calculated by dividing the mass of the candidate body by the total mass of the other objects that share its orbital zone.

===Music===
* Mu chord
* Electronic musician Mike Paradinas runs the label Planet Mu which utilizes the letter as its logo, and releases music under the pseudonym μ-Ziq, pronounced &quot;music&quot;
* Used as the name of the school idol group μ&#x27;s, pronounced &quot;muse&quot;, consisting of nine singing idols in the anime Love Live! School Idol Project
* Official fandom name of Kpop group f(x), appearing as either MeU or &#x27;μ&#x27;
* Hip-hop artist Muonboy has taken inspiration from the particle for his stage name and his first EP named Mu uses the letter as its title.

===Cameras===
The Olympus Corporation manufactures a series of digital cameras called Olympus μ (known as Olympus Stylus in North America).

===Linguistics===
In phonology:
* mora

In syntax:
* μP (mu phrase) can be used as the name for a functional projection.

In Celtic linguistics:
* /μ/ can represent an Old Irish nasalized labial fricative of uncertain articulation, the ancestor of the sound represented by Modern Irish &quot;mh&quot;.

==Unicode==

The lowercase mu (as &quot;micro sign&quot;) appeared at in the 8-bit ISO-8859-1 encoding, from which Unicode and many other encodings inherited it. It was also at in the popular CP437 on the IBM PC. Unicode has declared that a &quot;real&quot; mu is different than the micro sign.
