<text>Santander ( , ; ) is the capital of the autonomous community of Cantabria, Spain. It has a population of 172,000 (2017). It is a port city located in the northern coast of the Iberian Peninsula, facing the Cantabrian Sea.
It is believed to have been a port since ancient times, due to its favourable location, and is documented as far back as the 11th century. Much of the medieval city was lost in the Great Fire of 1941. Today, its remaining old town, beach and other attractions are popular with tourists and other visitors and its economy is mainly service based. The port is still very active and a regular ferry service operates to the United Kingdom. Fish and seafood dominate the local cuisine. Santander notably houses the headquarters of multinational bank Banco Santander, which was founded there. The city has a mild climate typical of the Spanish northern coastline with frequent rainfall and stable temperatures. Cold snaps and heat waves are very rare.

==History==
===Origins, Roman period and Middle Ages===
The origin of the earliest human settlements in the current Santander is not easy to establish because there is little written and little archaeological data. However, there would appear to be good practical reasons for ancient settlers to have chosen the north side of the bay, sheltered from it and safer from the storms of the Bay of Biscay, on the north side of the promontory of Somorrostro and along the ancient Becedo estuary. Moreover, the hillside provided good visibility for spotting potential attackers, making this the ideal place for the foundation of a stable settlement, which was to evolve throughout the Middle Ages.

Although it is mentioned for the first time in 1068, in a draft document made by King Sancho II, in the 9th century Alfonso II the Chaste founded the &quot;Abadía de los Cuerpos Santos&quot; (&quot;Abbey of the Holy Bodies&quot;) in the existing chapel on the hill of Somorrostro, housing as holy relics the heads of Saint Emeterius and Saint Celedonius and the graves of other unknown martyrs, giving the abbey its name.

Alfonso VIII of Castile granted the city a &quot;fuero&quot; (charter) in 1187.

During the 12th and 13th centuries the population was contained within the walls of two different pueblas. La Puebla, the older, on the hill overlooking the city facing the bay, included the old castle, the Abbey of the Holy Bodies and the cloister. It had three rows of houses, separated by Rua Carnicerias and Rua Mayor, where the homes of prominent people of the town were, as well as those of the Abbot&#x27;s canons. Meanwhile, the Puebla Nueva contained the convent of Santa Clara and San Francisco, which gave its name to one of the main streets; other important streets were the Rua de la Sal, The cavalcade Palace, Ribera, Don Gutierre, Puerta de la Sierra, Gallows and the Arcillero Rua. The two pueblas were joined by a bridge over the river that divided Becedo and flowed down to the shipyards, which were ordered by the king to take timber from the Cantabrian forests for shipbuilding. The villa was required to give the monarchy a ship per year.

By the end of the 15th century Santander had a population of about 4,000 or 5,000 inhabitants.

The city owes its existence to the excellent harbour of the Bay of Santander. Santander was an important port for Castile in the later Middle Ages, and also for trade with the New World. It officially became a city in 1755.
===&quot;Cabo Machichaco&quot; explosions===
On 3 November 1893 a steamship, , caught fire while she was being unloaded at a pier in the heart of the city. A crowd of 2,000 to 3,000 people watched as crew and firefighters fought the fire. About 40 tonnes of dynamite being carried in her forward holds exploded, killing about 590 people, injuring about 2,000, sinking the ship and destroying at least 65 buildings near the harbour.

On 21 March 1894 a salvage diver working to salvage cargo from &quot;Cabo Machichaco&quot;″s wreck accidentally detonated about 11 tonnes of dynamite that were submerged in the after hold of the ship. 18 people were killed and 11 injured.

===Great Fire of 1941===

Santander fell victim to a great fire in 1941. Fanned by a strong south wind, the fire burned for two days. The fire started in Cádiz Street, next to the harbour, the Cathedral and the medieval quarter. The fire destroyed the Old Town Hall, Jesús de Monasterio and Vargas streets and Atarazanas square buildings. It led to a major change in the architecture of Santander, away from the older small stone and wood buildings with balconies to the enormous blocks of flats built during the reconstruction. 

There was only one casualty of the fire, a firefighter from Madrid killed in the line of duty, but thousands of families were left homeless and the city was plunged into chaos. The fire destroyed the greater part of the medieval town centre and gutted the city&#x27;s Romanesque cathedral.

==Geography==
The city is located on the northern side of the Bay of Santander.
==Climate==
The city of Santander has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;), the annual thermal oscillation of the average monthly temperatures reaching around 10 °C (50 °F). Due to the relatively mild winters (with average temperatures staying near 10 °C (50 °F)), it is technically classified as maritime subtropical (Cfbl/Cfbk) by the Trewartha climate classification. 

The maximum temperature reached in Santander Airport was on 27 June 2009, and the minimum temperature on 21 January 1957. The highest maximum daytime average for a month was in August 2003, with . Warm months (mean above ) are however rare. The highest temperature recorded in downtown is in August 1940.

Sunshine hours are very low by comparison with the rest of mainland and southern Spain. Even compared with other areas of northern Spain, such as Galicia, which have many more hours of sunshine in coastal cities such as Vigo or Pontevedra. With annual averages of approximately 1650 hours of sunshine, Santander&#x27;s southern areas are about as sunny as London and Paris, and quite a bit less sunny than most of England&#x27;s south coastal regions. The area closer to the coast has higher sunshine time but lower summer afternoon temperatures.

==Tourism and sights==
The bars and restaurants of the old town are popular with tourists, as well as the El Sardinero beach a couple of kilometres away.

The Cathedral of Santander: The lower temple, called &quot;cripta del Cristo&quot; was built around 1200 on other earlier Roman buildings. It is long and wide, organised into three naves. Its style is a transition from Romanesque to Gothic.

The Lighthouse of Cabo Mayor presides over the entrance to the Bay of Santander.

<doc id="167550" wikidata="Q207714" url="?curid=167550" title="Transcription (linguistics)">
<text>Transcription in the linguistic sense is the systematic representation of spoken language in written form. The source can either be utterances (&quot;speech&quot; or &quot;sign language&quot;) or preexisting text in another writing system.

Transcription should not be confused with translation, which means representing the meaning of text from a source-language in a target language, (e.g. &quot;Los Angeles&quot; (from source-language Spanish) means &quot;The Angels&quot; in the target language English); or with transliteration, which means representing the spelling of a text from one script to another.

In the academic discipline of linguistics, transcription is an essential part of the methodologies of (among others) phonetics, conversation analysis, dialectology, and sociolinguistics. It also plays an important role for several subfields of speech technology. Common examples for transcriptions outside academia are the proceedings of a court hearing such as a criminal trial (by a court reporter) or a physician&#x27;s recorded voice notes (medical transcription). This article focuses on transcription in linguistics.

==Phonetic and orthographic transcription==
There are two main types of linguistic transcription. Phonetic transcription focuses on phonetic and phonological properties of spoken language. Systems for phonetic transcription thus furnish rules for mapping individual sounds or phones to written symbols. Systems for orthographic transcription, by contrast, consist of rules for mapping spoken words onto written forms as prescribed by the orthography of a given language. Phonetic transcription operates with specially defined character sets, usually the International Phonetic Alphabet.

The type of transcription chosen depends mostly on the context of usage. Because phonetic transcription strictly foregrounds the phonetic nature of language, it is mostly used for phonetic or phonological analyses. Orthographic transcription, however, has a morphological and a lexical component alongside the phonetic component (which aspect is represented to which degree depends on the language and orthography in question). This form of transcription is thus more convenient wherever semantic aspects of spoken language are transcribed. Phonetic transcription is more systematic in a scientific sense, but it is also more difficult to learn, more time-consuming to carry out and less widely applicable than orthographic transcription.

==As a theory==
Mapping spoken language onto written symbols is not as straightforward a process as may seem at first glance. Written language is an idealization, made up of a limited set of clearly distinct and discrete symbols. Spoken language, on the other hand, is a continuous (as opposed to discrete) phenomenon, made up of a potentially unlimited number of components. There is no predetermined system for distinguishing and classifying these components and, consequently, no preset way of mapping these components onto written symbols.

Literature is relatively consistent in pointing out the nonneutrality of transcription practices. There is not and cannot be a neutral transcription system. Knowledge of social culture enters directly into the making of a transcript. They are captured in the texture of the transcript (Baker, 2005).

==Transcription systems==
Transcription systems are sets of rules which define how spoken language is to be represented in written symbols. Most phonetic transcription systems are based on the International Phonetic Alphabet or, especially in speech technology, on its derivative SAMPA.

Examples for orthographic transcription systems (all from the field of conversation analysis or related fields) are:

===CA (conversation analysis)===
Arguably the first system of its kind, originally sketched in (Sacks et al. 1978), later adapted for the use in computer readable corpora as &quot;CA-CHAT&quot; by (MacWhinney 2000). The field of Conversation Analysis itself includes a number of distinct approaches to transcription and sets of transcription conventions. These include, among others, Jefferson Notation. To analyze conversation, recorded data is typically transcribed into a written form that is agreeable to analysts. There are two common approaches. The first, called narrow transcription, captures the details of conversational interaction such as which particular words are stressed, which words are spoken with increased loudness, points at which the turns-at-talk overlap, how particular words are articulated, and so on. If such detail is less important, perhaps because the analyst is more concerned with the overall gross structure of the conversation or the relative distribution of turns-at-talk amongst the participants, then a second type of transcription known as broad transcription may be sufficient (Williamson, 2009).

====Jefferson Transcription System====
The Jefferson Transcription System is a set of symbols, developed by Gail Jefferson, which is used for transcribing talk. Having had some previous experience in transcribing when she was hired in 1963 as a clerk typist at the UCLA Department of Public Health to transcribe sensitivity-training sessions for prison guards, Jefferson began transcribing some of the recordings that served as the materials out of which Harvey Sacks&#x27; earliest lectures were developed. Over four decades, for the majority of which she held no university position and was unsalaried, Jefferson&#x27;s research into talk-in-interaction has set the standard for what became known as conversation analysis (CA). Her work has greatly influenced the sociological study of interaction, but also disciplines beyond, especially linguistics, communication, and anthropology. This system is employed universally by those working from the CA perspective and is regarded as having become a near-globalized set of instructions for transcription.

===DT (discourse transcription)===
A system described in (DuBois et al. 1992), used for transcription of the Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English (SBCSAE), later developed further into &quot;DT2&quot;.

===GAT (Gesprächsanalytisches Transkriptionssystem – Conversation analytic transcription system)===
A system described in (Selting et al. 1998), later developed further into GAT2 (Selting et al. 2009), widely used in German speaking countries for prosodically oriented conversation analysis and interactional linguistics.

===HIAT (Halbinterpretative Arbeitstranskriptionen – Semiinterpretative working transcriptions)===
Arguably the first system of its kind, originally described in (Ehlich and Rehbein 1976) – see (Ehlich 1992) for an English reference - adapted for the use in computer readable corpora as (Rehbein et al. 2004), and widely used in functional pragmatics.

==Software==
Transcription was originally a process carried out manually, i.e. with pencil and paper, using an analogue sound recording stored on, e.g., a Compact Cassette. Nowadays, most transcription is done on computers. Recordings are usually digital audio files or video files, and transcriptions are electronic documents. Specialized computer software exists to assist the transcriber in efficiently creating a digital transcription from a digital recording.

Two types of transcription software can be used to assist the process of transcription: one that facilitates manual transcription and the other automated transcription. For the former, the work is still very much done by a human transcriber who listens to a recording and types up what is heard in a computer, and this type of software is often a multimedia player with functionality such as playback or changing speed. For the latter, automated transcription is achieved by a speech-to-text engine which converts audio or video files into electronic text. Some of the software would also include the function of annotation.

<doc id="167557" wikidata="Q543736" url="?curid=167557" title="Angry young men">
<text>The &quot;angry young men&quot; were a group of mostly working- and middle-class British playwrights and novelists who became prominent in the 1950s. The group&#x27;s leading figures included John Osborne and Kingsley Amis; other popular figures included John Braine, Alan Sillitoe, and John Wain. The phrase was originally coined by the Royal Court Theatre&#x27;s press officer in order to promote Osborne&#x27;s 1956 play &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;. It was likely derived from the autobiography of Leslie Paul, founder of the Woodcraft Folk, whose &quot;Angry Young Man&quot; was published in 1951.

Following the success of the Osborne play, the label &quot;angry young men&quot; was later applied by British media to describe young writers who were characterised by a disillusionment with traditional British society. The term, always imprecise, began to have less meaning over the years as the writers to whom it was originally applied became more divergent, and many of them dismissed the label as useless. Literary critic Terry Eagleton noted that the group &quot;weren&#x27;t exactly a clique since they scarcely knew each other, and apart from being young they shared almost nothing in common, least of all anger.&quot;

==John Osborne==
The playwright John Osborne was the archetypal example, and his signature play &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; (1956) attracted attention to a style of drama contrasting strongly with the genteel and understated works of Terence Rattigan that had been in fashion. Osborne&#x27;s &quot;The Entertainer&quot; (1957) secured his reputation, with Laurence Olivier playing the protagonist Archie Rice. Osborne became a successful entrepreneur, partnering with Tony Richardson to form the film production company Woodfall. In addition to being seen as archetypal, Osborne was claimed to be one of the leading literary figures of the Angry Young Men &quot;movement&quot;. This &quot;movement&quot; was identified after the Second World War as some British intellectuals began to question orthodox mores. Osborne expressed his own concerns through his plays and could be relied upon to provide controversial &quot;angry&quot; pronouncements, delivered with an immaturity compared to impatient youth.

Some critics ridiculed Osborne for a lack of maturity in his statements, and fuelled a debate about his politics and those of the &quot;movement&quot;. Osborne also had consistent and often sarcastic criticism of the British Left. In 1961, he made public headlines with &quot;Letter to my Fellow Countrymen&quot; that represented a &quot;damn you, England&quot; mentality. and protested against Britain&#x27;s decision to join the arms race. Osborne strongly expressed anger at what Britain had become at that time, but also at what he felt it had failed to become.

===&quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;===
Osborne&#x27;s play &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; was the monumental literary work that influenced the concept of the Angry Young Man. He wrote the play to express what it felt like to live in England during the 1950s. The main issues that Angry Young Men had were &quot;impatience with the status quo, refusal to be co-opted by a bankrupt society, an instinctive solidarity with the lower classes&quot;. Referred to as &quot;kitchen sink realism&quot;, literary works began to deal with lower class themes. In the decades prior to Osborne and other authors, less attention had been given to literature that illuminated the treatment and living circumstances experienced by the lower classes. As the Angry Young Men movement began to articulate these themes, the acceptance of related issues was more widespread. Osborne depicted these issues within his play through the eyes of his protagonist, Jimmy. Throughout the play, Jimmy was seeing &quot;the wrong people go hungry, the wrong people be loved, the wrong people dying&quot;.

In Britain, following the Second World War, the quality of life for lower-class citizens was still poor; Osborne used this theme to demonstrate how the state of Britain was guilty of neglect towards those who needed assistance the most. In the play there are comparisons of educated people with savages, illuminating the major difference between classes. Alison remarks on this issue while she, Jimmy and Cliff are sharing an apartment, stating how &quot;she felt she had been placed into a jungle&quot;. Jimmy was represented as an embodiment of the young, rebellious post-war generation that questioned the state and its actions. &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; provided some of its audience with the hope that Osborne&#x27;s work would revitalise the British theatre and enable it to act as a &quot;harbinger of the New Left&quot;.

==Definition and divisions==
Not all members of the movement were angry, young, or male, but all disliked the title &quot;Angry Young Men&quot;. &quot;Life&quot; in 1958 wrote that &quot;the most common prevailing attitude among them is of wry irritation&quot;, and named Osborne, Kingsley Amis, John Wain, and John Braine as the best-known. As a catchphrase, the term was applied to a large, incoherently defined group, and was rejected by most of the writers to whom it was applied: see, for example, &quot;Answer to a Letter from Joe&quot; by Wain (&quot;Essays on Literature and Ideas&quot;, 1963). Publisher Tom Maschler, who edited a collection of political-literary essays by the &#x27;Angries&#x27; (&quot;Declaration&quot;, 1957), commented: &quot;(T)hey do &quot;not&quot; belong to a united movement. Far from it; they attack one another directly or indirectly in these pages. Some were even reluctant to appear between the same covers with others whose views they violently oppose&quot;.

AYM preferred realism, rejecting the experimental literature of the 1920s and 1930s. &quot;Life&quot; observed that &quot;They hate the &#x27;phony&#x27; in any form and mistrust anything that seems precious or preposterous. they are literary conservatives. They would find the Beat Generation preposterous&quot;. Their politics were radical, usually left but sometimes right, sometimes anarchistic, and they described social alienation of different kinds. They also often expressed their critical views on society as a whole, criticising certain behaviours or groups in different ways. On television, their writings were often expressed in plays in anthology drama series such as &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; (ITV, 1956–68) and &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; (BBC, 1964–70); this leads to a confusion with the kitchen sink drama category of the early 1960s.

Throughout the late 1950s and into the 1960s, the &quot;Angries&quot; often met at or were nurtured by the Royal Shakespeare Company, and through this venue other such emerging playwrights as Edward Bond and Wole Soyinka were exposed to the AYM movement directly.

The New University Wits (a term applied by William Van O&#x27;Connor in his 1963 study &quot;The New University Wits and the End of Modernism&quot;) refers to Oxbridge malcontents who explored the contrast between their upper-class university privilege and their middle-class upbringings. These included Amis, Philip Larkin, and Wain, all of whom were also part of the poetic circle known as &quot;The Movement&quot;.

Also included among the Angry Young Men was a small group of young existentialist philosophers, led by Colin Wilson and also including Stuart Holroyd and Bill Hopkins.

Outside of these subgroupings, the &#x27;Angries&#x27; included writers mostly of lower-class origin concerned with their political and economic aspirations. Apart from Osborne, these included Harold Pinter, Braine, Arnold Wesker, and Alan Sillitoe. Some of these (e.g., Pinter) were left-wing and some (e.g., Braine) later became right-wing. William Cooper, the early-model Angry Young Man, though Cambridge-educated, was a &quot;provincial&quot; writer in his frankness and material and is included in this group.

==Crosscurrents in the late 1950s==
Friendships, rivalries, and acknowledgments of common literary aims within each of these groups could be intense (the relationship between Amis and Larkin is considered one of the great literary friendships of the 20th century). However, the writers in each group tended to view the other groups with bewilderment and incomprehension. Observers and critics could find no common thread between them all. They were contemporaries by age. They were not of the upper-class establishment, nor were they protégés of existing literary circles. It was essentially a male &quot;movement&quot;, but Shelagh Delaney, author of &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; (1958), was described as an &quot;angry young woman&quot;; other female members included Iris Murdoch and Doris Lessing.

<text>Alfredo Stroessner Matiauda (; 3 November 1912 – 16 August 2006) was a Paraguayan army officer, politician, and dictator who ruled as President of Paraguay from 15 August 1954 until his overthrow in 1989. Known there as &quot;El Stronato&quot;, his dictatorship was marked by political violence.

Stroessner rose to power after leading the 1954 Paraguayan coup d&#x27;état on 4 May, with backing from the Colorado Party and Paraguayan Army. Following a brief provisional government under Tomás Romero Pereira, he was elected unopposed in the 1954 presidential election, as all opposition parties had been banned since 1947.

He quickly suspended constitutional and civil rights upon taking office on 15 August 1954. With the army and military police, who acted as a secret police, he instituted a period of authoritarian rule and violent political repression (especially of opponents, whose parties were nominally legalized in 1962). From the 1958 through the 1988 elections, Stroessner maintained power by electoral fraud. The Constitution of 1967, introduced on 25 August, permitted his re-election, and changes in 1977 effectively enabled his indefinite rule.

His trusted confidant Lieutenant General Andrés Rodríguez Pedotti seized power in the 1989 coup d&#x27;état of 2 and 3 February. Stroessner was exiled to Brazil on 5 February, where he died and is buried. His legacy continues in Paraguay, where his Colorado Party has retained power and continues to rule through clientelistic practices.

==Early life==
Alfredo Stroessner Matiauda was born in Encarnación on 3 November 1912. His father, a German Paraguayan, was an accountant from Hof, Bavaria, Germany, who immigrated to Paraguay in the last five years of the 1890s. His mother was of Guaraní and Spanish criollo descent.

He joined the Paraguayan army at the age of 16. During the 1947 Paraguayan Civil War, Stroessner supported the Colorado Party, and played an important role in their victory. In 1951, he became commander-in-chief of the army.

==Dictatorship (1954–1989)==


Stroessner objected to President Federico Chávez&#x27;s plans to arm the national police and threw him out of office in a coup on 4 May 1954. The National Assembly appointed Tomás Romero Pereira president, who called for special elections to complete Chávez&#x27;s term. Stroessner became the nominee for the Colorado Party in that year&#x27;s election on 11 July. He won, as he was the only candidate.

He was reelected seven times—in 1958, 1963, 1968, 1973, 1978, 1983 and 1988. He appeared alone on the ballot in 1958. In his other elections, he won by implausibly high margins; only once (1968) did he drop below 80 percent of the vote. That campaign was also the only time an opposition candidate got more than 20 percent of the vote. He served for 35 years, with only Fidel Castro having a longer tenure among 20th-century Latin American leaders; though Castro&#x27;s tenure as &quot;president&quot; was shorter at 32 years (1976–2008).

Soon after taking office, Stroessner placed the entire country under a state of siege and suspended civil liberties. The state-of-siege provisions allowed the government to arrest and detain anyone indefinitely without trial, as well as forbid public meetings and demonstrations. It was renewed every 90 days until 1987, except for a brief period in 1959. Although it technically only applied to Asunción after 1970, the courts ruled that anyone charged with security offenses could be brought to the capital and charged under the state-of-siege provisions—even if the offense took place outside the capital. Apart from one 24-hour period on election days, Stroessner ruled under what amounted to martial law for nearly all of his tenure. A devoted anti-communist who brought Paraguay into the World Anti-Communist League, he justified his repression as a necessary measure to protect the country. The use of political repression, threats and death squads was a key factor in Stroessner&#x27;s longevity as dictator of Paraguay. He maintained virtually unlimited power by giving a free hand to the military and to Minister of Interior Edgar Ynsfrán, who began to harass, terrorize, and occasionally murder family members of the regime&#x27;s opponents. Stroessner heavily relied on various Colorado Party militias, subordinated to his control, to crush any dissent within the country.
The Stroessner regime&#x27;s strong anti-communist stance earned it the support of the United States, with which it enjoyed close military and economic ties and supported the U.S. invasion of the Dominican Republic. The Stroessner regime even offered to send troops to Vietnam alongside the Americans. The United States played a &quot;critical supporting role&quot; in the domestic affairs of Stoessner&#x27;s Paraguay. Between 1962 and 1975 the US provided $146 million to Paraguay&#x27;s military government and Paraguayan officers were trained at the U.S. Army School of the Americas. Although the military and security forces under Stroessner received less material support from the United States than other South American countries, strong inter-military connections existed through military advisors and military training. Between 1962 and 1966, nearly 400 Paraguayan military personnel were trained by the United States in the Panama Canal Zone and on US soil. Strong Paraguayan-U.S. relations continued until the Carter Administration emphasized a foreign policy that recognized human rights abuses, although both military and economic aid were allotted to the Paraguayan government in Carter&#x27;s budgets. The Reagan Administration restored more cordial relations due to Stroessner&#x27;s staunch anti-communism, but by the mid 1980s relations cooled, largely because of the international outcry over the regime&#x27;s excesses, along with its involvement in narcotics trafficking and money-laundering. In 1986, the Reagan administration added his regime to its list of Latin American dictatorships.

As leader of the Colorado Party, Stroessner exercised nearly complete control over the nation&#x27;s political scene. Although opposition parties were nominally permitted after 1962 (the Colorado Party had been the only legal party in the country since 1947), Paraguay remained for all intents and purposes a one-party state. Elections were so heavily rigged in favor of the Colorados that the opposition had no realistic chance of winning, and opposition figures were subjected to varying degrees of harassment. Furthermore, Stroessner&#x27;s Paraguay became a haven for Nazi war criminals, including Josef Mengele, and non-communist peaceful opposition was crushed. Given Stroessner&#x27;s affinity for Nazism and harboring of Nazi war criminals, foreign press often referred to his government as the &quot;poor man&#x27;s Nazi regime&quot;.

Stroessner&#x27;s rule brought more stability than most of the country&#x27;s living residents had previously known. From 1927 to 1954, the country had had 22 presidents, including six from 1948 to 1954 alone. However, that stability came at a high cost. Corruption was rampant (Stroessner himself did not dispute charges of corruption at some levels in his government) and Paraguay&#x27;s human rights record was considered one of the poorest in South America. During Stroessner&#x27;s regime, an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 people were murdered, 400 to 500 more &quot;disappeared,&quot; and thousands more imprisoned and tortured.

Press freedom was also limited, constitutional guarantees notwithstanding. Any outcry about government mistreatment or attacks toward the Colorado Party would result in destruction of the media outlets. Many media executives were sent to prison or tortured. Because of this, political opponents were few and far between. Near the end of this presidency, he declared that he would remove the state of siege, but quickly recanted after students began protesting trolley fares.
For the first 13 years of his rule, Stroessner ruled under a severely authoritarian constitution enacted in 1940. In the mid 1960s, in an attempt to placate growing international criticism, Stroessner began allowing some opposition parties to function, although these functioned as opposition in name only. Stroessner also fired the interior minister Ynsfrán in 1966, but his replacement, Sabino Augusto Montanaro (a member of the &quot;Cuatrinomio de Oro&quot;, a group of politicians intimately connected to Stroessner) continued the same violent policies. The 1940 constitution was replaced in 1967 with an equally repressive document. Like its predecessor, it gave the president broad powers to take exceptional actions for the good of the country, such as suspending civil liberties and intervening in the economy. It thus formed the legal basis for the state of virtual martial law under which Stroessner governed. While it limited the president to two five-year terms, it stipulated that only those terms completed after the 1968 election would count toward that limit. In 1977, faced with having to leave office for good the following year, Stroessner pushed through a constitutional amendment allowing him to run for an unlimited number of five-year terms.

===Operation Condor===
Paraguay was a leading participant in Operation Condor, a campaign of state terror and security operations officially implemented in 1975 which were jointly conducted by the military dictatorships of six South American countries (Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil) with the support of the United States. Human rights violations characteristic of those in other South American countries such as kidnappings, torture, forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings were routine and systematic during the Stroessner regime. Following executions, many of the bodies of those killed by the regime were dumped in the Chaco or the Río Paraguay. The discovery of the &quot;Archives of Terror&quot; in 1992 in the Lambaré suburb of Asunción confirmed allegations of widespread human rights violations.

During Stroessner&#x27;s rule, two special departments were organized under the Ministry of the Interior led by Edgar Ynsfrán: the Department of Investigations of the Metropolitan Police (Departamento de Investigaciones de la Policía de la Capital, DIPC) under the leadership of Pastor Coronel, and the National Directorate of Technical Affairs (Dirección Nacional de Asuntos Técnicos, DNAT) directed by Antonio Campos Alum. Both units specialized in political repression. Pastor Coronel became infamous for his brutality. He would interview people in a &quot;pileta&quot;, a bath of human vomit and excrement, or ram electric cattle prods up their rectums. In 1975, the Secretary of the Paraguayan Communist Party, , was dismembered alive by chainsaw while Stroessner listened on the phone. The screams of tortured dissidents were often recorded and played over the phone to family members, and sometimes the bloody garments of those killed were sent to their homes.

Under Stroessner, egregious human rights violations were committed against the indigenous Aché population of Paraguay&#x27;s eastern districts, largely as the result of U.S. and European corporations wanting access to the country&#x27;s forests, mines and grazing lands. The Aché resided on land that was coveted and had resisted relocation attempts by the Paraguayan army. The government retaliated with massacres and forced many Aché into slavery. In 1974, the UN accused Paraguay of slavery and genocide. Only a few hundred Aché remained alive by the late 1970s. The Stroessner regime financed this genocide with U.S. aid.

Stroessner was careful not to show off or draw attention from jealous generals or foreign journalists. He avoided rallies and took simple holidays in Patagonia. He became more tolerant of opposition as the years passed, but there was no change in the regime&#x27;s basic character.

During Stroessner&#x27;s rule, no socialist nations had diplomatic relations with Paraguay, with the sole exception of non-aligned Yugoslavia. Stroessner made many state visits, including to Japan, the United States, and France, as well as to South Africa, a country which Paraguay developed close bilateral ties with in the 1970s. He also made several visits to West Germany, although over the years his relations with that country deteriorated. Since he had always been known as pro-German, this worsening of relations, combined with his feeling that the U.S. had abandoned him, was regarded as a personal blow to Stroessner.

It has been asserted that the Roman Catholic Church is the only reason Stroessner did not have absolute control over the country. After the destruction of Asunción University in 1972 by police, the Archbishop of Paraguay Ismael Rolón Silvero excommunicated the minister of the interior and the chief of police, and proscribed the celebration of Holy Mass in a sign of protest against the Stroessner regime. When Pope John Paul II visited Paraguay in 1988, his visit bolstered what was already a robust anti-Stroessner movement within the country.

Stroessner gave a written television interview to Alan Whicker as part of a documentary called &quot;The Last Dictator&quot; (UK: 7 April 1970) for the television series &quot;Whicker&#x27;s World&quot;. The programme was released in a Region 2 DVD box-set by the UK&#x27;s Network imprint.

===Economics===
Stroessner dedicated large proportions of the Paraguayan national budget to the military and police apparatus, both fundamental to the maintenance of the regime. According to a 1963 article from &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Stroessner spent 33% of the 1962 annual budget on army and police, 15% for education, and just 2% for public works. There was no income tax and public spending was the smallest percentage of GDP in Latin America.

Stroessner enacted several economic development projects, including the building of the Itaipu Dam, the largest hydroelectric power plant in the world at the time: although Paraguay received only 15% of the contracts, it was a major factor in the country having the highest rate of growth in Latin America for most of the 1970s. The construction of the Itaipu Dam, as well as that of the subsequent Yacyretá Dam on the Paraguay–Argentina Border, displaced thousands of Paraguayans, often without any restitution. The Itaipu Dam displaced at least 80,000 Paraguayans, and the Yacyretá was estimated to have displaced at least as many by December 2008. 160 workers died building the Itaipu Dam.

Stroessner also promoted projects that purportedly developed the country&#x27;s infrastructure. Amongst these were the improvement of highways and the issuing of 15–20 hectare land grants to military personnel upon completion of their service, provided that the land would be used for farming purposes. Over 10,000 soldiers took up this offer. By the end of the &quot;Stronato&quot;, the second biggest city was Puerto Flor de Lis (renamed &quot;Puerto Presidente Stroessner,&quot; then &quot;Ciudad del Este&quot;), founded just 32 years before.

===Downfall===

In April 1987, Stroessner lifted the state of siege as part of the run-up to elections the following spring. However, several draconian security laws remained in effect, meaning that the substance (if not the form) of the state of siege was still in place. As had been the case for over three decades, opposition leaders continued to be arbitrarily arrested and opposition meetings and demonstrations were broken up (often brutally). Stroessner was nominated by the Colorados once again, and was the only candidate who was allowed to campaign completely unmolested. Under these circumstances, the February 1988 election was no different from past elections, with Stroessner officially registering 89 percent of the vote — a margin that his rivals contended could have been obtained only through massive fraud.

On 3 February 1989, only six months after being sworn in for what would have been his eighth full term, Stroessner was ousted in a coup d&#x27;état led by General Andrés Rodríguez, his closest confidant for over three decades. One reason for the coup was that the generals feared one of Stroessner&#x27;s offspring would succeed him. Of the two, Alfredo was a cocaine addict and , a pilot, was loathed for being homosexual. A more outlandish rumour was that Lino Oviedo threatened Rodríguez with a grenade if he did not launch the coup. The two generals, Rodríguez and Oviedo, fought a brief artillery duel over Asunción.

==Later life and death==

After the coup, Stroessner fled to Brazil, where he lived in exile for the next 17 years.

The eastern city of Puerto Flor de Lis, which had been renamed Puerto Presidente Stroessner in his honour, in 1989 was again renamed Ciudad del Este. Asunción&#x27;s airport had been named after him during his regime, but was later renamed Silvio Pettirossi International Airport.

Stroessner died on 16 August 2006, in Brasília, at the age of 93. The immediate cause of death was a stroke. He had been suffering from pneumonia after undergoing a hernia operation. The Paraguayan government preemptively dismissed any suggestions for honouring the late president within Paraguay. He tried to return to Paraguay before his death, but he was rebuked and threatened with arrest by the government.

==Family==

=== Marriage and children ===
Stroessner was married to Eligia Mora (26 December 1910 – 3 February 2006). They had three children. The couple were forcibly separated after his exile; she fled to the US, while he was given asylum in Brazil. Although they stayed in touch by phone and occasionally met, they were unable to live together, and neither Stroessner nor his son were able to return to Paraguay to attend her funeral.

=== Extramarital affairs and child abuse ===
Stroessner engaged in extramarital affairs before and during his presidency. According to many sources he also engaged in child abuse with girls as young as 8 years old. As a result of this he may have fathered over 30 illegitimate children. The affairs and child abuse were divulged after his downfall, further tarnishing his image.

==Legacy==
Stroessner was the second-longest serving leader of a Latin American country. His 35 year dictatorship was surpassed in length by only Fidel Castro&#x27;s rule of Cuba. It was also the longest-lived dictatorship in South America. Even after Stroessner&#x27;s rule, the Colorado Party has continually held the presidency of Paraguay, with the exception of from 2008 to 2013, following the election of Fernando Lugo. The social scientist Antonio Soljancic has argued that this is because, although Stroessner was removed from power, &quot;he left a legacy that no one has tried to bury&quot;. Many public schools avoid historical discussions of the Stroessner dictatorship, and many still feature plaques paying tribute to him as of 2024.

Mario Abdo Benítez, a member of Colorado Party who served as the president of Paraguay from 2018 to 2023, was the son of Stroessner&#x27;s personal secretary. Journalist Isabel Debre expressed the view that Abdo Benítez&#x27;s election to the presidency in 2018 was when Storessner&#x27;s enduring influence was &quot;never more obvious&quot; due to this connection. Abdo Benítez has opined that Stroessner &quot;did much for the country&quot; (), but voiced his disapproval of Stroessner&#x27;s human rights violations.

According to a 2022 poll by the Centro Estratégico Latinoamericano de Geopolítica (Latin American Strategic Centre for Geopolitics) of who Paraguayans viewed as their best president of the past three decades, Stroessner was the answer of 14.4% of respondents, above President Nicanor Duarte, but below Presidents Lugo and Horacio Cartes.

Stroessner&#x27;s supporters are known as &quot;Stronistas&quot;, and they refer to him as &quot;El Único Líder&quot; (). Every year, nostalgic Stronistas celebrate the anniversary of Stroesssner&#x27;s birth. His supporters have asserted that &quot;another Stroessner&quot; is needed to govern modern Paraguay, and that his was a time of security and stability.

As part of political persecution, Stroessner&#x27;s regime was responsible for exiling 20,814 Paraguayans. Around 425 to 500 people were forcibly disappeared. The search for some bodies of the disappeared by families of the victims was still ongoing as of 2022. An estimated 18,000 to 20,000 people were subjected to torture and other abuses by Stroessner&#x27;s government.

In part due to Stroessner&#x27;s abuses, Paraguay&#x27;s current constitution limits the president to a single five-year term with no possibility of reelection, even if nonsuccessive. The ban on any sort of reelection has become so entrenched in Paraguayan politics that in 2017, when the legislature debated an amendment that would have allowed then-president Horacio Cartes to run for reelection, massive protests forced the Colorados to abandon those plans.

<text>Paul Gerard Stoddart (born 26 May 1955) is an Australian businessman, airline owner and former Minardi Formula One team boss.

==Personal life==
Born in Coburg, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, and attended Preston Technical School and St Joseph&#x27;s College Melbourne. Stoddart&#x27;s first business was a car dealership. He was later based in England and was the Yugo car distributor for the UK and also had a hire car detailing business in Manchester detailing the ex-hire cars before sale to the public.

==Aviation==

===European Aviation===
In late 1989, Stoddart purchased two BAC 1-11 aircraft and three Falcon 20 business jets (and a large assortment of spare parts for both aircraft) from the Royal Australian Air Force&#x27;s &#x27;VIP Squad&#x27; (the Canberra-based No 34 SQN). Stoddart formed European Aviation, hired Trevor Whetter from British Aerospace as his Managing Director and sold the BAC 1-11 aircraft to Okada Air in Nigeria. Following discussions with British Airways, Stoddart purchased 16 aircraft, and following Dan Air&#x27;s absorption into British Airways, the airline was formed in 1994.

Stoddart and European Aviation made the news in the UK during the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Airbus A340 aircraft, acquired from Etihad Airways and owned by Stoddart&#x27;s business were used to transport PPE from China and Malaysia back to the UK.

===OzJet===
In 2005, Stoddart formed OzJet an Australian based, all business class airline. He wanted to challenge Qantas who at the time were the only domestic carrier with this luxury option. The airline flew with three Boeing 737 aircraft that had 60 seats. It was not a commercial success, and in March 2006 Stoddart cancelled its commercial service and turned it into a charter airline. In 2009, OzJet was sold to Strategic Airlines.

==Formula One &amp; ChampCar==
===Tyrrell===

In 1996, Stoddart purchased a 1990 Tyrrell 019 Formula One car. During this time, he connected with Rupert Mainwaring the team manager at Tyrrell. In 1997, Stoddart sponsored the team with his company, European Aviation, appearing on the front wing of the car and in 1998 the rear. Stoddart&#x27;s relationship with owner Ken Tyrrell grew, and the two were discussing building a wind tunnel at Stoddart&#x27;s base at Bournemouth Airport. Tyrrell was lining up the sale of the team to Stoddart and in 1997, a deal of $25 million was almost agreed upon. However, British American Tobacco ultimately would purchase Tyrrell and enter the 1999 season as British American Racing. Stoddart purchased a volume of Tyrrell cars and equipment and moved them to his base in Ledbury, Herefordshire.

===Jordan &amp; Arrows===
In 1999, European Aviation sponsored the Jordan Grand Prix team. There was speculation he would purchase a minority shareholding in the team from owner Eddie Jordan.

European Aviation moved on to sponsor Arrows in and his European Racing became the Arrows Junior Team, with driver Mark Webber.

===Minardi===
In 2001, Stoddart purchased Minardi when Gabriele Rumi sold the team to him prior to the 2001 Formula One Season. From purchase to the first race the team completed the PS01 in six weeks. The car was emblazoned with European Aviation sponsorship and used an uprated version of the 2000 Minardi Fondmetal V10. Whilst perennial backmarkers, during 2001 future world champion Fernando Alonso drove for the team and was rated highly. In 2002, Stoddart hired Australian Mark Webber who scored points on his debut at the 2002 Australian Grand Prix.

Finances were always a challenge for the team, as was sponsorship. In 2003, Formula One owner Bernie Ecclestone invested $4 million into the struggling team. Wilux became a lead sponsor in 2004, however terminated their agreement after they were not told the team would run without logos at the 2004 British Grand Prix. Stoddart had elected to run blank cars due to the death of Minardi sporting director John Walton. In 2005, the team was sponsored by another Stoddart firm—OzJet. One of the team&#x27;s greatest successes under Stoddart&#x27;s ownership would come at the 2005 United States Grand Prix where just six cars competed—Minardi scoring 7 points with both cars finishing.

Throughout his ownership, Stoddart regularly campaigned for budget caps and greater consideration of financial incentives to smaller teams like his own. This included a public battle with McLaren boss Ron Dennis. When Eddie Jordan sold Jordan Grand Prix to Alex Shnaider in 2005, Stoddart expressed concerns for his team&#x27;s future. On 12 September 2005, Stoddart announced that he had sold the team to Red Bull Racing owner Dietrich Mateschitz who subsequently rebranded the team as Toro Rosso.

In March 2006, less than a year after selling his team to Red Bull, Stoddart announced his intentions to return the Minardi name to Formula One after lodging an entry with the FIA for the championship season. However, rival entry Prodrive were awarded the 12th and final place on the grid (which they ultimately did not use).

===F1 Experience===
With the new F1 management wanting to expand the F1 experience for fans, starting from the 2017 Spanish Grand Prix Stoddart is offering fans the ability to ride in one of his Minardi Fx2 cars.

===Minardi Team USA===
In December 2006 Stoddart purchased the CTE-HVM ChampCar team which he renamed Minardi Team USA. The team was successful, with Robert Doornbos finishing third overall and taking the Rookie of the Year honours. However, a month before the 2008 season, ChampCar was absorbed by the rival Indy Racing League. Although enthusiastic about the future of the series, Stoddart opted not to enter it, fearing that he and the other ex-ChampCar teams would be unable to be competitive. However, the half of the team owned by Keith Wiggins continued on as HVM Racing in the IRL.

<text>A microarray is a multiplex lab-on-a-chip. Its purpose is to simultaneously detect the expression of thousands of biological interactions. It is a two-dimensional array on a solid substrate—usually a glass slide or silicon thin-film cell—that assays (tests) large amounts of biological material using high-throughput screening miniaturized, multiplexed and parallel processing and detection methods. The concept and methodology of microarrays was first introduced and illustrated in antibody microarrays (also referred to as antibody matrix) by Tse Wen Chang in 1983 in a scientific publication and a series of patents. The &quot;gene chip&quot; industry started to grow significantly after the 1995 &quot;Science Magazine&quot; article by the Ron Davis and Pat Brown labs at Stanford University. With the establishment of companies, such as Affymetrix, Agilent, Applied Microarrays, Arrayjet, Illumina, and others, the technology of DNA microarrays has become the most sophisticated and the most widely used, while the use of protein, peptide and carbohydrate microarrays is expanding.

Types of microarrays include:
* DNA microarrays, such as cDNA microarrays, oligonucleotide microarrays, BAC microarrays and SNP microarrays
* MMChips, for surveillance of microRNA populations
* Protein microarrays
* Peptide microarrays, for detailed analyses or optimization of protein–protein interactions
* Tissue microarrays
* Cellular microarrays (also called transfection microarrays)
* Chemical compound microarrays
* Antibody microarrays
* Glycan arrays (carbohydrate arrays)
* Phenotype microarrays
* Reverse phase protein lysate microarrays, microarrays of lysates or serum
* Interferometric reflectance imaging sensor (IRIS)

People in the field of CMOS biotechnology are developing new kinds of microarrays. Once fed magnetic nanoparticles, individual cells can be moved independently and simultaneously on a microarray of magnetic coils. A microarray of nuclear magnetic resonance microcoils is under development.

==Fabrication and operation of microarrays==
A large number of technologies underlie the microarray platform, including the material substrates, spotting of biomolecular arrays, and the microfluidic packaging of the arrays. Microarrays can be categorized by how they physically isolate each element of the array, by spotting (making small physical wells), on-chip synthesis (synthesizing the target DNA probes adhered directly on the array), or bead-based (adhering samples to barcoded beads randomly distributed across the array).

=== Production process ===
The initial publication on microarray production process dates back to 1995, when 48 cDNAs of a plant were printed on glass slide typically used for light microscopy, modern microarrays on the other hand include now thousands of probes and different carriers with coatings. The fabrication of the microarray requires both biological and physical information, including sample libraries, printers, and slide substrates. Though all procedures and solutions always dependent on the fabrication technique employed. The basic principle of the microarray is the printing of small stains of solutions containing different species of the probe on a slide several thousand times.

Modern printers are HEPA-filtered and have controlled humidity and temperature surroundings, which is typically around 25°C, 50% humidity. Early microarrays were directly printed onto the surface by using printer pins which deposit the samples in a user-defined pattern on the slide. Modern methods are faster, generate less cross-contamination, and produce better spot morphology. The surface to which the probes are printed must be clean, dust free and hydrophobic, for high-density microarrays. Slide coatings include poly-L-lysine, amino silane, epoxy and others, including manufacturers solutions and are chosen based on the type of sample used. Ongoing efforts to advance microarray technology aim to create uniform, dense arrays while reducing the necessary volume of solution and minimizing contamination or damage. 

For the manufacturing process, a sample library which contains all relevant information is needed. In the early stages of microarray technology, the sole sample used was DNA, obtained from commonly available clone libraries and acquired through DNA amplification via bacterial vectors. Modern approaches do not include just DNA as a sample anymore, but also proteins, antibodies, antigens, glycans, cell lysates and other small molecules. All samples used are presynthesized, regularly updated, and more straightforward to maintain. Array fabrication techniques include contact printing, lithography, non-contact and cell free printing. 

==== Contact printing ====
Contact printing microarray include Pin printing, microstamping or flow printing. Pin printing is the oldest and still widest adopted methodology in DNA microarray contact printing. This technique uses pin types like solid pins, split or quill pins to load and deliver the sample solution directly on solid microarray surfaces. Microstamping offers an alternative to the commonly used pin printing and is also referred as soft lithography, which in theory covers different, related pattern transfer technologies using patterned polymer monolithic substrates, the most prominent being microstamping. In contrast to pin printing, microstamping is a more parallel deposition method with less individuality. Certain stamps are loaded with reagents and printed with these reagent solutions identically.

==== Lithography ====
Lithography combines various methods like Photolithography, Interference lithography, laser writing, electron-beam and Dip pen. The most widely used and researched method remains Photolithography, in which photolithographic masks are used to target specific nucleotides to the surface. UV light is passed through the mask that acts as a filter to either transmit or block the light from the chemically protected microarray surface. If the UV light has been blocked, the area will remain protected from the addition of nucleotides, whereas in areas which were exposed to UV light, further nucleotides can be added. With this method high-quality custom arrays can be produced with a very high density of DNA features by using a compact device with few moving parts.

==== Non contact ====
Non-contact printing methods vary from Photochemistry-based printing, Electro-printing and droplet dispensing. In contrast to the other methods, non-contact printing does not involve contact between the surface and the stamp, pin, or other used dispenser. The main advantages are reduced contamination, lesser cleaning and higher throughput which increases steadily. Many of the methods are able to load the probes in parallel, allowing multiple arrays to be produced simultaneously.

==== Cell free ====
In cell free systems, the transcription and translation are carried out in situ, which makes the cloning and expression of proteins in host cells obsolete, because no intact cells are needed. The molecule of interest is directly synthesized onto the surface of a solid area. These assays allow high-throughput analysis in a controlled environment without inferences associated with intact cells.

<doc id="167576" wikidata="Q321466" url="?curid=167576" title="Robert Rankin">
<text>Robert Fleming Rankin (born 27 July 1949) is a prolific British author of comedic fantasy novels. Born in Parsons Green, London, he started writing in the late 1970s, and first entered the bestsellers lists with &quot;Snuff Fiction&quot; in 1999, by which time his previous eighteen books had sold around one million copies. His books are a mix of science fiction, fantasy, the occult, urban legends, running gags, metafiction, steampunk and outrageous characters. According to the (largely fictional) biography printed in some Corgi editions of his books, Rankin refers to his style as &#x27;Far Fetched Fiction&#x27; in the hope that bookshops will let him have a section to himself. Many of Rankin&#x27;s books are bestsellers.

Most of Rankin&#x27;s books are set in Brentford, a suburb of London where the author grew up, and which, in his novels, is usually infested with alien conspiracies and ancient evil.

In addition to his novels, Rankin held a position as the Writer in Residence of Brentford&#x27;s Watermans Arts Centre during the 1980s, and organised a regular poetry event there which he claims was the largest in Britain. He also has performed on stage with bands.

Rankin&#x27;s fan club, The Order of the Golden Sprout (named after Rankin&#x27;s fixation with the vegetable), maintain a website and arrange events, many around Brentford. In 2009 he was created the first Fellow of The Victorian Steampunk Society in recognition of his contribution to the genre. He lives in Brighton with his wife, Dr. Rachel Hayward-Rankin.

During 2012, Rankin published his first 23 novels (up to and including &quot;Fandom of the Operator&quot;) on Kindle through his own publishing enterprise, Far Fetched Books, with new cover artwork, making them available to a wider audience, despite many of them being out of print.

== Other media ==
In 2008, &quot;The Brightonomicon&quot; was adapted into a 13-part full-cast audio drama by Hokus Bloke Productions and BBC Audiobooks starring David Warner, Andy Serkis, Jason Isaacs, Ben Miller, Rupert Degas, Mark Wing-Davey, Martin Jarvis and Sarah Douglas. Initially released as a 7-CD boxset and as a digital download, the series has now been re-edited for radio transmission, and Robert&#x27;s first ever radio series aired on BBC7 from 23 August to 15 November 2008. Rankin has also had his novel &quot;The Antipope&quot; dramatised for audio, and has also read unabridged versions of many of his novels as audiobooks. He recorded eleven of his titles for Audible. His free, full colour webcomic called &quot;Robert Rankin&#x27;s Empires&quot; for Beyond Reality Media in New Zealand, can be viewed online, and illustrated work &quot;Alice on Mars&quot; will also be released via the same website.

== Art and illustration ==
Rankin studied at Ealing School of Art, where he was a contemporary of Freddie Mercury and Alan Lee. He worked for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine and illustrated a book about The Beatles before his portfolio was stolen and he abandoned the idea of working as a professional illustrator. However he created many of the sculptures which feature on his book covers, many of which were on display at The Collection, a gallery in Lincoln during September 2010. Some of these works were previously exhibited in Waterstones, Brighton, and at Gunnersbury Park Museum in 2007-8. In 2009 Rankin was commissioned by his publisher to provide a series of new illustrations for his back catalogue of books (from &quot;The Hollow Chocolate Bunnies of the Apocalypse&quot; to the present), he also created new internal illustrations for &quot;The Brightonomicon&quot;, &quot;Retromancer&quot; and &quot;The Japanese Devil Fish Girl and Other Unnatural Attractions&quot;. A cartoon by Rankin &quot;The Robot and the Elongated Author&quot; was published in Issue 13 of &quot;Murky Depths&quot;, and 2010 also saw the publication of his first illustrated book, written by Neil Gardner, &quot;The Bumper Book of Ficts&quot;, which was launched on 18 September 2010 in Brentford. A limited hard-back edition of &quot;Empires&quot; was launched in the UK mid-2012 which is now sold out. In July 2013 Rankin&#x27;s own publishing house Far-Fetched Books launched &quot;Alice on Mars&quot;, in a limited edition of 3000; this book is being made into a full-length feature film by award-winning independent film-maker Martin Gooch. July 2014 saw the release of his next illustrated book, &quot;The Divine Commodore&quot;, also published by Far-Fetched Books in a limitied run of 3000. He has recently completed writing his memoirs which were published in the autumn of 2015 under the title &quot;I,Robert&quot;.

<text>The use of toxic chemicals as weapons dates back thousands of years, but the first large-scale use of chemical weapons was during World War I. They were primarily used to demoralize, injure, and kill entrenched defenders, against whom the indiscriminate and generally very slow-moving or static nature of gas clouds would be most effective. The types of weapons employed ranged from disabling chemicals, such as tear gas, to lethal agents like phosgene, chlorine, and mustard gas. These chemical weapons caused medical problems. This chemical warfare was a major component of the first global war and first total war of the 20th century. Gas attack left a strong psychological impact, and estimates go up to about 90,000 fatalities and a total of about 1.3 million casualties. However, this would amount to only 3-3.5% of overall casualties, and gas was unlike most other weapons of the period because it was possible to develop countermeasures, such as gas masks. In the later stages of the war, as the use of gas increased, its overall effectiveness diminished. The widespread use of these agents of chemical warfare, and wartime advances in the composition of high explosives, gave rise to an occasionally expressed view of World War I as &quot;the chemist&#x27;s war&quot; and also the era where weapons of mass destruction were created.

The use of poison gas by all major belligerents throughout World War I constituted war crimes as its use violated the 1899 Hague Declaration Concerning Asphyxiating Gases and the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, which prohibited the use of &quot;poison or poisoned weapons&quot; in warfare. Widespread horror and public revulsion at the use of gas and its consequences led to far less use of chemical weapons by combatants during World War II.

==Use of poison gas==
===1914: Tear gas===
The most frequently used chemicals during World War I were tear-inducing irritants rather than fatal or disabling poison. During World War I, the French Army was the first to employ tear gas, using 26 mm grenades filled with ethyl bromoacetate in August 1914. The small quantities of gas delivered, roughly per cartridge, were not even detected by the Germans. The stocks were rapidly consumed and by November a new order was placed by the French military. As bromine was scarce among the Entente allies, the active ingredient was changed to chloroacetone.

In October 1914, German troops fired fragmentation shells filled with a chemical irritant against British positions at Neuve Chapelle; the concentration achieved was so small that it too was barely noticed.
None of the combatants considered the use of tear gas to be in conflict with the Hague Treaty of 1899, which specifically prohibited the launching of projectiles containing asphyxiating or poisonous gas.

===1915: Large-scale use and lethal gases===
The first instance of large-scale use of gas as a weapon was on 31 January 1915, when Germany fired 18,000 artillery shells containing liquid xylyl bromide tear gas on Russian positions on the Rawka River, west of Warsaw during the Battle of Bolimov. Instead of vaporizing, the chemical froze and failed to have the desired effect.

The first killing agent was chlorine, used by the German Army. Chlorine is a powerful irritant that can inflict damage to the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. At high concentrations and prolonged exposure it can cause death by asphyxiation. German chemical companies BASF, Hoechst and Bayer (which formed the IG Farben conglomerate in 1925) had been making chlorine as a by-product of their dye manufacturing. In cooperation with Fritz Haber of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin, they began developing methods of discharging chlorine gas against enemy trenches.

It may appear from a &quot;feldpost&quot; letter of Major Karl von Zingler that the first chlorine gas attack by German forces took place before 2 January 1915: &quot;In other war theatres it does not go better and it has been said that our Chlorine is very effective. 140 English officers have been killed. This is a horrible weapon ...&quot;. This letter must be discounted as evidence for early German use of chlorine, however, because the date &quot;2 January 1915&quot; may have been hastily scribbled instead of the intended &quot;2 January 1916,&quot; the sort of common typographical error that is often made at the beginning of a new year. The deaths of so many English officers from gas at this time would certainly have been met with outrage, but a recent, extensive study of British reactions to chemical warfare says nothing of this supposed attack. Perhaps this letter was referring to the chlorine-phosgene attack on British troops at Wieltje near Ypres, on 19 December 1915 (see below).

By 22 April 1915, the German Army had 167 tons of chlorine deployed in 5,730 cylinders from Langemark-Poelkapelle, north of Ypres. At 17:30, in a slight easterly breeze, the liquid chlorine was siphoned from the tanks, producing gas which formed a grey-green cloud that drifted across positions held by troops of the 45th Infantry Division (France), specifically the 1st Tirailleurs and the 2nd Zouaves from Algeria. Faced with an unfamiliar threat these troops broke ranks, abandoning their trenches and creating an 8,000-yard (7 km) gap in the Allied line. The German infantry were also wary of the gas and, lacking reinforcements, failed to exploit the break before the 1st Canadian Division and assorted French troops reformed the line in scattered, hastily prepared positions apart. The Entente governments claimed the attack was a flagrant violation of international law but Germany argued that the Hague treaty had only banned chemical shells, rather than the use of gas projectors.

In what became the Second Battle of Ypres, the Germans used gas on three more occasions; on 24 April against the 1st Canadian Division, on 2 May near Mouse Trap Farm and on 5 May against the British at Hill 60. The British Official History stated that at Hill 60, &quot;90 men died from gas poisoning in the trenches or before they could be got to a dressing station; of the 207 brought to the nearest dressing stations, 46 died almost immediately and 12 after long suffering.&quot;

On 6 August, German troops under Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg used chlorine gas against Russian troops defending Osowiec Fortress. Surviving defenders drove back the attack and retained the fortress. The event would later be called the Attack of the Dead Men.

Germany used chemical weapons on the Eastern Front in an attack at Rawka (river), west of Warsaw. The Russian Army took 9,000 casualties, with more than 1,000 fatalities. In response, the artillery branch of the Russian Army organised a commission to study the delivery of poison gas in shells.

====Effectiveness and countermeasures====
It quickly became evident that the men who stayed in their places suffered less than those who ran away, as any movement worsened the effects of the gas, and that those who stood up on the fire step suffered less—indeed they often escaped any serious effects—than those who lay down or sat at the bottom of a trench. Men who stood on the parapet suffered least, as the gas was denser near the ground. The worst sufferers were the wounded lying on the ground, or on stretchers, and the men who moved back with the cloud. Chlorine was less effective as a weapon than the Germans had hoped, particularly as soon as simple countermeasures were introduced. The gas produced a visible greenish cloud and strong odour, making it easy to detect. It was water-soluble, so the simple expedient of covering the mouth and nose with a damp cloth was effective at reducing the effect of the gas. It was thought to be even more effective to use urine rather than water, as it was known at the time that chlorine reacted with urea (present in urine) to form dichloro urea.

Chlorine required a concentration of 1,000 parts per million to be fatal, destroying tissue in the lungs, likely through the formation of hypochlorous and hydrochloric acids when dissolved in the water in the lungs. Despite its limitations, chlorine was an effective psychological weapon—the sight of an oncoming cloud of the gas was a continual source of dread for the infantry.

Countermeasures were quickly introduced in response to the use of chlorine. The Germans issued their troops with small gauze pads filled with cotton waste, and bottles of a bicarbonate solution with which to dampen the pads. Immediately following the use of chlorine gas by the Germans, instructions were sent to British and French troops to hold wet handkerchiefs or cloths over their mouths. Simple pad respirators similar to those issued to German troops were soon proposed by Lieutenant-Colonel N. C. Ferguson, the Assistant Director Medical Services of the 28th Division. These pads were intended to be used damp, preferably dipped into a solution of bicarbonate kept in buckets for that purpose; other liquids were also used. Because such pads could not be expected to arrive at the front for several days, army divisions set about making them for themselves. Locally available muslin, flannel and gauze were used, officers were sent to Paris to buy more and local French women were employed making up rudimentary pads with string ties. Other units used lint bandages manufactured in the convent at Poperinge. Pad respirators were sent up with rations to British troops in the line as early as the evening of 24 April.

In Britain the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper encouraged women to manufacture cotton pads, and within one month a variety of pad respirators were available to British and French troops, along with motoring goggles to protect the eyes. The response was enormous and a million gas masks were produced in a day. The &quot;Mail&quot;″s design was useless when dry and caused suffocation when wet—the respirator was responsible for the deaths of scores of men. By 6 July 1915, the entire British army was equipped with the more effective &quot;smoke helmet&quot; designed by Major Cluny MacPherson, Newfoundland Regiment, which was a flannel bag with a celluloid window, which entirely covered the head. The race was then on between the introduction of new and more effective poison gases and the production of effective countermeasures, which marked gas warfare until the armistice in November 1918.

====British gas attacks====
The British expressed outrage at Germany&#x27;s use of poison gas at Ypres and responded by developing their own gas warfare capability. The commander of II Corps, Lieutenant General Sir Charles Ferguson, said of gas:

The first use of gas by the British was at the Battle of Loos, 25 September 1915, but the attempt was a disaster. Chlorine, codenamed &quot;Red Star&quot;, was the agent to be used (140 tons arrayed in 5,100 cylinders), and the attack was dependent on a favourable wind. On this occasion the wind proved fickle, and the gas either lingered in no man&#x27;s land or, in places, blew back on the British trenches. This was compounded when the gas could not be released from all the British canisters because the wrong turning keys were sent with them. Subsequent retaliatory German shelling hit some of those unused full cylinders, releasing gas among the British troops. Exacerbating the situation were the primitive flannel gas masks distributed to the British. The masks got hot, and the small eye-pieces misted over, reducing visibility. Some of the troops lifted the masks to get fresh air, causing them to be gassed.

===1915: More deadly gases===
The deficiencies of chlorine were overcome with the introduction of phosgene, which was prepared by a group of French chemists led by Victor Grignard and first used by France in 1915. Colourless and having an odour likened to &quot;mouldy hay,&quot; phosgene was difficult to detect, making it a more effective weapon. Phosgene was sometimes used on its own, but was more often used mixed with an equal volume of chlorine, with the chlorine helping to spread the denser phosgene. The Allies called this combination &quot;White Star&quot; after the marking painted on shells containing the mixture. German phosgene came in the form of diphosgene, codenamed &quot;Grün Kreuz&quot; (Green cross). This was less effective than its allied counterpart, being less toxic and slower to evaporate, but was easier to handle in shell manufacture early in the war.

Phosgene was a potent killing agent, deadlier than chlorine. It had a potential drawback in that some of the symptoms of exposure took 24 hours or more to manifest. This meant that the victims were initially still capable of putting up a fight; this could also mean that apparently fit troops would be incapacitated by the effects of the gas on the following day.

In the first combined chlorine–phosgene attack by Germany, against British troops at Wieltje near Ypres, Belgium on 19 December 1915, 88 tons of the gas were released from cylinders causing 1069 casualties and 69 deaths. The British P gas helmet, issued at the time, was impregnated with sodium phenolate and partially effective against phosgene. The modified PH Gas Helmet, which was impregnated with phenate hexamine and hexamethylene tetramine (urotropine) to improve the protection against phosgene, was issued in January 1916.

Around 36,600 tons of phosgene were manufactured during the war, out of a total of 190,000 tons for all chemical weapons, making it second only to chlorine (93,800 tons) in the quantity manufactured:

* Germany 18,100 tons
* France 15,700 tons
* United Kingdom 1,400 tons (also used French stocks)
* United States 1,400 tons (also used French stocks)

===1916: Austrian use===
On 29 June 1916, the Austro-Hungarian Army attacked the Royal Italian Army&#x27;s Brigade &quot;Ferrara&quot; on Monte San Michele with a mix of phosgene and chlorine gas. Thousands of Italian soldiers died in this first chemical weapons attack on the Italian Front.

===1917: Mustard gas===
The most widely reported chemical agent of the First World War was mustard gas. Despite the name it is not a gas but a volatile oily liquid, and is dispersed as a fine mist of liquid droplets. It was introduced as a vesicant by Germany on July 12, 1917, weeks prior to the Third Battle of Ypres. The Germans marked their shells yellow for mustard gas and green for chlorine and phosgene; hence they called the new gas &quot;Yellow Cross&quot;. It was known to the British as &quot;HS&quot; (&quot;Hun Stuff&quot;), and the French called it &quot;Yperite&quot; (named after Ypres).

Mustard gas is not an effective killing agent (though in high enough doses it is fatal) but can be used to harass and disable the enemy and pollute the battlefield. Delivered in artillery shells, mustard gas was heavier than air, and it settled to the ground as an oily liquid. Once in the soil, mustard gas remained active for several days, weeks, or even months, depending on the weather conditions.

The skin of victims of mustard gas blistered, their eyes became very sore and they began to vomit. Mustard gas caused internal and external bleeding and attacked the bronchial tubes, stripping off the mucous membrane. This was extremely painful. Fatally injured victims sometimes took four or five weeks to die of mustard gas exposure.

One nurse, Vera Brittain, wrote: &quot;I wish those people who talk about going on with this war whatever it costs could see the soldiers suffering from mustard gas poisoning. Great mustard-coloured blisters, blind eyes, all sticky and stuck together, always fighting for breath, with voices a mere whisper, saying that their throats are closing and they know they will choke.&quot;

The polluting nature of mustard gas meant that it was not always suitable for supporting an attack as the assaulting infantry would be exposed to the gas when they advanced. When Germany launched Operation Michael on 21 March 1918, they saturated the Flesquières salient with mustard gas instead of attacking it directly, believing that the harassing effect of the gas, coupled with threats to the salient&#x27;s flanks, would make the British position untenable.

Gas never reproduced the dramatic success of 22 April 1915; it became a standard weapon which, combined with conventional artillery, was used to support most attacks in the later stages of the war. Gas was employed primarily on the Western Front—the static, confined trench system was ideal for achieving an effective concentration. Germany also used gas against Russia on the Eastern Front, where the lack of effective countermeasures resulted in deaths of over 56,000 Russians, while Britain experimented with gas in Palestine during the Second Battle of Gaza. Russia began manufacturing chlorine gas in 1916, with phosgene being produced later in the year. Most of the manufactured gas was never used.

The British Army first used mustard gas in November 1917 at Cambrai, after their armies had captured a stockpile of German mustard gas shells. It took the British more than a year to develop their own mustard gas weapon, with production of the chemicals centred on Avonmouth Docks. (The only option available to the British was the Despretz–Niemann–Guthrie process.) This was used first in September 1918 during the breaking of the Hindenburg Line with the Hundred Days&#x27; Offensive.

The Allies mounted more gas attacks than the Germans in 1917 and 1918 because of a marked increase in production of gas from the Allied nations. Germany was unable to keep up with this pace despite creating various new gases for use in battle, mostly as a result of very costly methods of production. Entry into the war by the United States allowed the Allies to increase mustard gas production far more than Germany. Also the prevailing wind on the Western Front was blowing from west to east, which meant the Allies more frequently had favourable conditions for a gas release than did the Germans.

When the United States entered the war, it was already mobilizing resources from academic, industry and military sectors for research and development into poison gas. A Subcommittee on Noxious Gases was created by the National Research Committee, a major research centre was established at Camp American University, and the 1st Gas Regiment was recruited. The 1st Gas Regiment eventually served in France, where it used phosgene gas in several attacks. The Artillery used mustard gas with significant effect during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive on at least three occasions. The United States began large-scale production of an improved vesicant gas known as Lewisite, for use in an offensive planned for early 1919. By the time of the armistice on 11 November, a plant near Willoughby, Ohio was producing 10 tons per day of the substance, for a total of about 150 tons. It is uncertain what effect this new chemical would have had on the battlefield, as it degrades in moist conditions.

== Post-war ==
By the end of the war, chemical weapons had lost much of their effectiveness against well trained and equipped troops. By that time, chemical weapon agents had inflicted an estimated 1.3 million casualties.

Nevertheless, in the following years, chemical weapons were used in several, mainly colonial, wars where one side had an advantage in equipment over the other. The British used poison gas, possibly adamsite, against Russian revolutionary troops beginning on 27 August 1919 and contemplated using chemical weapons against Iraqi insurgents in the 1920s; Bolshevik troops used poison gas to suppress the Tambov Rebellion in 1920, Spain used chemical weapons in Morocco against Rif tribesmen throughout the 1920s and Italy used mustard gas in Libya in 1930 and again during its invasion of Ethiopia in 1936. In 1925, a Chinese warlord, Zhang Zuolin, contracted a German company to build him a mustard gas plant in Shenyang, which was completed in 1927.

Public opinion had by then turned against the use of such weapons which led to the Geneva Protocol, an updated and extensive prohibition of poison weapons. The Protocol, which was signed by most First World War combatants in 1925, bans the use (but not the stockpiling or production) of lethal gas and bacteriological weapons among signatories in international armed conflicts. Most countries that signed ratified it within around five years; a few took much longer—Brazil, Japan, Uruguay, and the United States did not do so until the 1970s, and Nicaragua ratified it in 1990. The signatory nations agreed not to use poison gas against each other in the future, both stating &quot;the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials or devices, has been justly condemned by the general opinion of the civilized world&quot; and &quot;the High Contracting Parties ... agree to be bound &quot;as between themselves&quot; according to the terms of this declaration.&quot;

Chemical weapons have been used in at least a dozen wars since the end of the First World War; they were not used in combat on a large scale until Iraq used mustard gas and the more deadly nerve agents in the Halabja chemical attack near the end of the eight-year Iran–Iraq War. The full conflict&#x27;s use of such weaponry killed around 20,000 Iranian troops (and injured another 80,000), around a quarter of the number of deaths caused by chemical weapons during the First World War.

=== The Geneva Protocol, 1925 ===
The Geneva Protocol, signed by 132 nations on June 17, 1925, was a treaty established to ban the use of chemical and biological weapons among signatories in international armed conflicts. As stated by Coupland and Leins, &quot;it was fostered in part by a 1918 appeal in which the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) described the use of poisonous gas against soldiers as a barbarous invention which science is bringing to perfection&quot;. Chemical warfare agents that contained bromine, nitroaromatic, and chlorine were dismantled and destroyed. The destruction and disposal of the chemicals did not consider the long-term and adverse impacts on the environment.

The Protocol does not ban the stockpilling or production of chemical weapons as well as the use of such weaponry against non-ratifying states and in internal disturbances or conflicts, and permits reservations that allow signatories to adopt the policy of no first use. As a result, the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) was drafted in 1993, which prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons. Despite there being an international ban on chemical warfare, the CWC &quot;allows domestic law enforcement agencies of the signing countries to use chemical weapons on their citizens&quot;.

=== Effect on World War II ===
All major combatants stockpiled chemical weapons during the Second World War, but the only reports of its use in the conflict were the Japanese use of relatively small amounts of mustard gas and lewisite in China, Italy&#x27;s use of gas in Ethiopia (in what is more often considered to be the Second Italo-Ethiopian War), and very rare occurrences in Europe (for example some mustard gas bombs were dropped on Warsaw on 3 September 1939, which Germany acknowledged in 1942 but indicated had been accidental). Mustard gas was the agent of choice, with the British stockpiling 40,719 tons, the Soviets 77,400 tons, the Americans over 87,000 tons and the Germans 27,597 tons. The destruction of an American cargo ship containing mustard gas led to many casualties in Bari, Italy, in December 1943.

In both Axis and Allied nations, children in school were taught to wear gas masks in case of gas attack. Germany developed the poison gases tabun, sarin, and soman during the war, and used Zyklon B in their extermination camps. Neither Germany nor the Allied nations used any of their war gases in combat, despite maintaining large stockpiles and occasional calls for their use. Poison gas played an important role in the Holocaust.

Britain made plans to use mustard gas on the landing beaches in the event of an invasion of the United Kingdom in 1940. The United States considered using gas to support their planned invasion of Japan.

==Casualties==
A range of authors have attempted to estimate the casualties from chemical weapons in WWI. This is hampered by incomplete data. British casualties were best recorded, while estimates of gas casualties amongst Russians on the Eastern front have been described as &quot;pure guesswork&quot;, a major issue as it is often claimed that a large proportion of casualties occurred there. A commonly used estimate claims 90,000 fatalities and 1.3 million casualties. Of this, 26,600 deaths and 652,000 casualties come from the UK, France, Germany and the US where more dependable data exists. Of the rest, historian L. F. Haber suggests the usual estimates are likely too high, but concedes &quot;we shall never know&quot;.

It is generally agreed that the contribution of gas weapons to the total casualty figures was relatively minor. British figures, which were accurately maintained from 1916, recorded that 3% of gas casualties were fatal, 2% were permanently invalid and 70% were fit for duty again within six weeks.



Death by gas was often slow and painful. According to Denis Winter (&quot;Death&#x27;s Men&quot;, 1978), a fatal dose of phosgene eventually led to &quot;shallow breathing and retching, pulse up to 120, an ashen face and the discharge of four pints (2 litres) of yellow liquid from the lungs each hour for the 48 of the drowning spasms.&quot;

A common fate of those exposed to gas was blindness, chlorine gas or mustard gas being the main causes. One of the most famous First World War paintings, &quot;Gassed&quot; by John Singer Sargent, captures such a scene of mustard gas casualties which he witnessed at a dressing station at Le Bac-du-Sud near Arras in July 1918. (The gases used during that battle (tear gas) caused temporary blindness and/or a painful stinging in the eyes. These bandages were normally water-soaked to provide a rudimentary form of pain relief to the eyes of casualties before they reached more organized medical help.)

The proportion of mustard gas fatalities to total casualties was low; 2% of mustard gas casualties died and many of these succumbed to secondary infections rather than the gas itself. Once it was introduced at the third battle of Ypres, mustard gas produced 90% of all British gas casualties and 14% of battle casualties of any type.

Mustard gas was a source of extreme dread. In &quot;The Anatomy of Courage&quot; (1945), Lord Moran, who had been a medical officer during the war, wrote:

Mustard gas did not need to be inhaled to be effective—any contact with skin was sufficient. Exposure to 0.1 ppm was enough to cause massive blisters. Higher concentrations could burn flesh to the bone. It was particularly effective against the soft skin of the eyes, nose, armpits and groin, since it dissolved in the natural moisture of those areas. Typical exposure would result in swelling of the conjunctiva and eyelids, forcing them closed and rendering the victim temporarily blind. Where it contacted the skin, moist red patches would immediately appear which after 24 hours would have formed into blisters. Other symptoms included severe headache, elevated pulse and temperature (fever), and pneumonia (from blistering in the lungs).

Many of those who survived a gas attack were scarred for life. Respiratory disease and failing eyesight were common post-war afflictions. Of the Canadians who, without any effective protection, had withstood the first chlorine attacks during Second Ypres, 60% of the casualties had to be repatriated and half of these were still unfit by the end of the war, over three years later.

Many of those who were fairly soon recorded as fit for service were left with scar tissue in their lungs. This tissue was susceptible to tuberculosis attack. It was from this that many of the 1918 casualties died, around the time of the Second World War, shortly before sulfa drugs became widely available for its treatment.

===British testimony===
A British nurse treating mustard gas cases recorded:

A postmortem account from the British official medical history records one of the British casualties:

Case four. Aged 39 years. Gassed 29 July 1917. Admitted to casualty clearing station the same day. Died about ten days later. Brownish pigmentation present over large surfaces of the body. A white ring of skin where the wrist watch was. Marked superficial burning of the face and scrotum. The larynx much congested. The whole of the trachea was covered by a yellow membrane. The bronchi contained abundant gas. The lungs fairly voluminous. The right lung showing extensive collapse at the base. Liver congested and fatty. Stomach showed numerous submucous haemorrhages. The brain substance was unduly wet and very congested.

===Civilian casualties===
The belligerents avoided deliberate attacks on civilians, but the distribution of gas cloud casualties was not only limited to the front. Nearby towns were at risk from winds blowing the poison gases through, with only the French taking special precautions in planning gas attacks. Later in the war, the British provided warnings and issued civilians working near the front with gas masks, leading to improved preparedness. Eventually, everyone within 8 kilometers of the front was to carry a respirator at all times. Regardless, a significant number would be exposed, with the most serious case in Armentières where lingering mustard gas residue from heavy German bombardment in July 1917 led to 675 civilian casualties (including 86 killed). Hundreds of shells rained down per minute, and while civilians had shelters and gas masks, the particular dangers of mustard gas was not yet known. British and French records list a total of around 1325 civilian casualties, including over a hundred deaths from German gas weapons. This is an underestimate as smaller incidents of exposure have not been recorded, and there is no German record of civilian casualties from Allied weapons. In addition, around 4000 civilians working in chemical weapons production and shell filling in France, Britain and the United States were injured due to accidental exposure. Similar figures for Germany are not available, though it is known that there were a number of deaths. The British did not publicise incidents of civilians being gassed by Germans due to fears about the effect on morale at home.

==Countermeasures==
None of the First World War&#x27;s combatants were prepared for the introduction of poison gas as a weapon. Once gas was introduced, development of gas protection began and the process continued for much of the war, producing a series of increasingly effective gas masks.

Even at Second Ypres, Germany, still unsure of the weapon&#x27;s effectiveness, only issued breathing masks to the engineers handling the gas. At Ypres a Canadian medical officer, who was also a chemist, quickly identified the gas as chlorine and recommended that the troops urinate on a cloth and hold it over their mouth and nose. Urine would be left to sit for a period so that the ammonia would activate; this would neutralize some of the chemicals in the chlorine gas, which allowed them to delay the German advance at Ypres, giving the allies time to reinforce the area when French and other colonial troops had retreated. The first official equipment issued was similarly crude: a pad of material, usually impregnated with a chemical, tied over the lower face. To protect the eyes from tear gas, soldiers were issued gas goggles.

The next advance was the introduction of the gas helmet, which was basically a bag placed over the head. The fabric of the bag was impregnated with a chemical to neutralize the gas; the chemical would wash out into the soldier&#x27;s eyes whenever it rained. Eye-pieces, which were prone to fog up, were initially made from talc. When going into combat, gas helmets were typically worn rolled up on top of the head, to be pulled down and secured about the neck when the gas alarm was given. The first British version was the hypo helmet, the fabric of which was soaked in sodium hyposulfite (commonly known as &quot;hypo&quot;). The British P gas helmet, partially effective against phosgene and with which all infantry were equipped with at Loos, was impregnated with sodium phenolate. A mouthpiece was added through which the wearer would breathe out to prevent carbon dioxide build-up. The adjutant of the 1/23rd Battalion, The London Regiment, recalled his experience of the P helmet at Loos:

A modified version of the P helmet, called the PH helmet, was issued in January 1916, and was impregnated with hexamethylenetetramine to improve protection against phosgene.

Self-contained box respirators represented the culmination of gas mask development during the First World War. Box respirators used a two-piece design; a mouthpiece connected via a hose to a box filter. The box filter contained granules of chemicals that neutralised the gas, delivering clean air to the wearer. Separating the filter from the mask enabled a bulky but efficient filter to be supplied. Nevertheless, the first version, known as the large box respirator (LBR) or &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Tower&quot;, was deemed too bulky—the box canister needed to be carried on the back. The LBR had no mask, just a mouthpiece and nose clip; separate gas goggles had to be worn. It continued to be issued to the artillery gun crews but the infantry were supplied with the &quot;small box respirator&quot; (SBR).

The Small Box Respirator featured a single-piece, close-fitting rubberized mask with eye-pieces. The box filter was compact and could be worn around the neck. The SBR could be readily upgraded as more effective filter technology was developed. The British-designed SBR was also adopted for use by the American Expeditionary Force. The SBR was the prized possession of the ordinary infantryman; when the British were forced to retreat during the German spring offensive of 1918, it was found that while some troops had discarded their rifles, hardly any had left behind their respirators.

Horses and mules were important methods of transport that could be endangered if they came into close contact with gas. This was not so much of a problem until it became common to launch gas great distances. This caused researchers to develop masks that could be used on animals such as dogs, horses, mules, and even carrier pigeons.

For mustard gas, which could cause severe damage by simply making contact with skin, no effective countermeasure was found during the war. The kilt-wearing Scottish regiments were especially vulnerable to mustard gas injuries due to their bare legs. At Nieuwpoort in Flanders some Scottish battalions took to wearing women&#x27;s tights beneath the kilt as a form of protection.

Gas alert procedure became a routine for the front-line soldier. To warn of a gas attack, a bell would be rung, often made from a spent artillery shell. At the noisy batteries of the siege guns, a compressed air strombus horn was used, which could be heard nine miles (14 km) away. Notices would be posted on all approaches to an affected area, warning people to take precautions.

Other British attempts at countermeasures were not so effective. An early plan was to use 100,000 fans to disperse the gas. Burning coal or carborundum dust was tried. A proposal was made to equip front-line sentries with diving helmets, air being pumped to them through a 100 ft (30 m) hose.

The effectiveness of all countermeasures is apparent. In 1915, when poison gas was relatively new, less than 3% of British gas casualties died. In 1916, the proportion of fatalities jumped to 17%. By 1918, the figure was back below 3%, though the total number of British gas casualties was now nine times the 1915 levels.

==Delivery systems==

The first system employed for the mass delivery of gas involved releasing the gas cylinders in a favourable wind such that it was carried over the enemy&#x27;s trenches. The Hague Convention of 1899 prohibited the use of poison gasses delivered by projectiles. The main advantage of this method was that it was relatively simple and, in suitable atmospheric conditions, produced a concentrated cloud capable of overwhelming the gas mask defences. The disadvantages of cylinder releases were numerous. First and foremost, delivery was at the mercy of the wind. If the wind was fickle, as was the case at Loos, the gas could backfire, causing friendly casualties. Gas clouds gave plenty of warning, allowing the enemy time to protect themselves, though many soldiers found the sight of a creeping gas cloud unnerving. Gas clouds had limited penetration, only capable of affecting the front-line trenches before dissipating.

Finally, the cylinders had to be emplaced at the very front of the trench system so that the gas was released directly over no man&#x27;s land. This meant that the cylinders had to be manhandled through communication trenches, often clogged and sodden, and stored at the front where there was always the risk that cylinders would be prematurely breached during a bombardment. A leaking cylinder could issue a telltale wisp of gas that, if spotted, would be sure to attract shellfire.
A British chlorine cylinder, known as an &quot;oojah&quot;, weighed 190 lb (86 kg), of which 60 lb (27 kg) was chlorine gas, and required two men to carry. Phosgene gas was introduced later in a cylinder, known as a &quot;mouse&quot;, that weighed 50 lb (23 kg).

Delivering gas via artillery shell overcame many of the risks of dealing with gas in cylinders. The Germans, for example, used artillery shells. Gas shells were independent of the wind and increased the effective range of gas, making anywhere within reach of the guns vulnerable. Gas shells could be delivered without warning, especially the clear, nearly odourless phosgene—there are numerous accounts of gas shells, landing with a &quot;plop&quot; rather than exploding, being initially dismissed as dud HE or shrapnel shells, giving the gas time to work before the soldiers were alerted and took precautions.

The main flaw associated with delivering gas via artillery was the difficulty of achieving a killing concentration. Each shell had a small gas payload and an area would have to be subjected to a saturation bombardment to produce a cloud to match cylinder delivery. Mustard gas did not need to form a concentrated cloud and hence artillery was the ideal vehicle for delivery of this battlefield pollutant.

The solution to achieving a lethal concentration without releasing from cylinders was the &quot;gas projector&quot;, essentially a large-bore mortar that fired the entire cylinder as a missile. The British Livens projector (invented by Captain W.H. Livens in 1917) was a simple device; an diameter tube sunk into the ground at an angle, a propellant was ignited by an electrical signal, firing the cylinder containing 30 or 40 lb (14 or 18 kg) of gas up to 1,900 metres. By arranging a battery of these projectors and firing them simultaneously, a dense concentration of gas could be achieved. The Livens was first used at Arras on 4 April 1917. On 31 March 1918 the British conducted their largest ever &quot;gas shoot&quot;, firing 3,728 cylinders at Lens.

==Unexploded weapons==

Over of France had to be cordoned off at the end of the war because of unexploded ordnance. About 20% of the chemical shells were duds, and approximately 13 million of these munitions were left in place. This has been a serious problem in former battle areas from immediately after the end of the War until the present. Shells may be, for instance, uncovered when farmers plough their fields (termed the &#x27;iron harvest&#x27;), and are also regularly discovered when public works or construction work is done. After the armistice, people sought unexploded weapons for their metal value, as well as preventing the danger that they posed to civilians. Toxic chemicals were emptied from shells, resulting in many deaths and health defects.

Another difficulty is the current stringency of environmental legislation. In the past, a common method of getting rid of unexploded chemical ammunition was to detonate or dump it at sea; this is currently prohibited in most countries.

The problems are especially acute in some northern regions of France. The French government no longer disposes of chemical weapons at sea. For this reason, piles of untreated chemical weapons accumulated. In 2001, it became evident that the pile stored at a depot in Vimy was unsafe; the inhabitants of the neighbouring town were evacuated, and the pile moved, using refrigerated trucks and under heavy guard, to a military camp in Suippes. The capacity of the plant is meant to be 25 tons per year (extensible to 80 tons at the beginning), for a lifetime of 30 years.

Germany has to deal with unexploded ammunition and polluted lands resulting from the explosion of an ammunition train in 1919.

Aside from unexploded shells, there have been claims that poison residues have remained in the local environment for an extended period, though this is unconfirmed; well known but unverified anecdotes claim that as late as the 1960s trees in the area retained enough mustard gas residue to injure farmers or construction workers who were clearing them.

=== Disposal methods of chemical weapons ===

After World War I, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and other nations had stockpiles of unfired weapons. It has been estimated that 125 million tons of toxic gases were used to manufacture bombs, grenades and shells. The remaining weapons were destroyed, dismantled, and disposed of in oceans and seas. It was believed that the chemicals would be diluted when disposed of in the ocean, and therefore ocean and sea dumping was a &quot;safe and convenient&quot; practice. Hundreds of thousands of tons of chemical agents, such as sulphur mustard, cyanogen chloride and arsine oil, were disposed of at sea. Chemical weapons have since washed up on shorelines and been found by fishers, causing injuries and, in some cases, death. Other disposal methods included land burials and incineration. After World War 1, &quot;chemical shells made up 35 percent of French and German ammunition supplies, 25 percent British and 20 percent American&quot;. Weapons that contained chemicals such as bromine, chlorine and nitroaromatic were burned. The thermal destruction of chemical weapons negatively impacted the ecological environment of disposal sites. For example, in Verdun, France, the thermal destruction of weapons &quot;resulted in severe metal contamination of upper 4–10 cm of topsoil&quot; at the Place à Gas disposal site.

==Gases used==
==Long-term health effects==

Soldiers who claimed to have been exposed to chemical warfare often presented unusual medical conditions which has led to much controversy. The lack of information left doctors, patients, and their families in the dark in terms of prognosis and treatment. Nerve agents such as sarin, tabun, and soman are believed to have had the most significant long-term health effects. Chronic fatigue and memory loss were reported to last up to three years after exposure. In the years following World War One, there were many conferences held in attempts to abolish the use of chemical weapons altogether, such as the Washington Naval Conference (1921–22), Geneva Conference (1923–25) and the World Disarmament Conference (1933). The United States was an original signatory of the Geneva Protocol in 1925, but the US Senate did not ratify it until 1975.

Although the health effects are generally chronic in nature, the exposures were generally acute. A positive correlation has been proven between exposure to mustard agents and skin cancers, other respiratory and skin conditions, leukemia, several eye conditions, bone marrow depression and subsequent immunosuppression, psychological disorders and sexual dysfunction. Chemicals used in the production of chemical weapons also left residues in the soil where the weapons were used. The chemicals that were detected can cause cancer and can affect the brain, blood, liver, kidneys and skin. The development and production of chemical weapons threatened public health and introduced a new set of challenges. Not only did war gasses like mustard and chlorine endanger the lives of soldiers, but also threatened the safety of workers who manufactured them.

<doc id="167579" wikidata="Q719670" url="?curid=167579" title="SimCity 4">
<text>SimCity 4 is a city-building simulation computer game developed by Maxis, a subsidiary of Electronic Arts. The game was released in January 2003 for Microsoft Windows and in June 2003 for Mac OS X. It is the fourth major installment in the &quot;SimCity&quot; series. &quot;SimCity 4&quot; has a single expansion pack called &quot;Rush Hour&quot; which adds features to the game. &quot;SimCity 4: Deluxe Edition&quot; contains the original game and &quot;Rush Hour&quot; combined as a single product.

The game allows players to create a region of land by terraforming, and then to design and build a settlement which can grow into a city. Players can zone different areas of land as commercial, industrial, or residential development, as well as build and maintain public services, transport and utilities. For the success of a city, players must manage its finances, environment, and quality of life for its residents. &quot;SimCity 4&quot; introduces night and day cycles and other special effects for the first time in the &quot;SimCity&quot; series. External tools such as the Building Architect Tool (BAT) allow custom third-party buildings and content to be added to the gameplay.

&quot;SimCity 4&quot; was praised for being the first game in the main &quot;SimCity&quot; series to primarily use a 3D engine to render its graphics, following the implementation of 3D graphics in &quot;SimCity 64&quot; for the Nintendo 64DD. It received widespread acclaim, won several awards, and was one of the top ten selling PC games of 2003. However, it was criticized for its difficulty and its demands on computer performance.

==Gameplay==

===Regional gameplay===

As with previous &quot;SimCity&quot; titles, &quot;SimCity 4&quot; places players in the role of a mayor, tasked with populating and developing tracts of lands into cities, while fulfilling the needs of fellow Sims that live in the cities. Cities are located in regions that are divided into s, each of which can be developed. The player has the option of starting the city in a segment of any of three area sizes. In real measurements, the smallest has a length of one kilometer on a side, and the largest has a length of four kilometers on a side. The size of a region and its layout of segments can be changed in a bitmap file provided for each region.

Neighbor cities play a larger role than in the previous versions of the game. Neighbor deals can be established where a city can exchange resources such as water, electricity and garbage disposal with other cities for money. Players may develop several inter-dependent cities at the same time, eventually populating the entire region.

===Game modes===
Upon selecting a specific segment in a region, the gameplay is divided into three &quot;modes&quot;: god mode, mayor mode, and MySim mode. Mayor and MySim modes become available after establishing a city. God mode is available before establishing a city and afterwards, albeit with fewer functions. Obliterating the city resets the map and reactivates all functions in God mode.

====God mode====
God mode allows players to design or terraform a selected tract of land where the city will be built and permits players to trigger disasters, including tornadoes and earthquakes among several others. Players can select an area where a disaster will occur and even control the direction of certain disasters. Most terraforming tools are disabled after the city is named and founded. The player still has some terraforming tools made available in mayor mode, although they become very limited and expensive, and they can still trigger disasters at will.

In addition to these abilities, god mode also gives the player tools to reconcile the borders of the cities, so as to fix any discrepancies created during the terraforming process, and a day/night cycle adjustment, so that one can make it always day, always night, or alternate between day or night in accordance with the in-universe game clock. Both the ability to reconcile the city edges and the ability to modify the day/night cycle are available even once the city has been established.

====Mayor mode====
In mayor mode, city building is conducted. Several advisors may give advice to the player on how to best manage a city. Players can build transportation networks, which include roads, streets, avenues, highways, railways, subway lines, and bus stations, draw out building zones, construct civic buildings, and adjust city funding and tax rates. Players can also terraform and plant trees in this mode, but in a much smaller scale than in god mode and costing money.

Zones are planned building plots that are empty at first but then populated by buildings depending on the type and density of the zone. Areas of land can be zoned as residential, commercial or industrial areas in various densities where the city will begin to grow. Agriculture is a separate industrial zone-type, unlike previous versions of &quot;SimCity&quot;, enabling farms to grow regardless of high land value, so long as demand exists for agriculture and agricultural zones have been provided. Zones are now automatically aligned towards roads and most buildings must be adjacent to a road in order to function properly; streets are automatically created when zoning on large tracts of land.

Buildings are classified into several wealth levels, zone types, and building size stages, which are affected by the region&#x27;s population and the city&#x27;s condition. The game simulates urban decay and gentrification with buildings deteriorating and refurbished accordingly. Buildings originally constructed for occupation by higher wealth tenants can now support lower wealth tenants in the event surrounding factors forces the current tenants to vacate the building; this allows certain buildings to remain in use despite lacking its initial occupants. Buildings and lots can be constructed on slopes.

Civic buildings can be constructed that need constant funding to work properly, such as schools, hospitals, parks, police stations, jails, and fire stations. These buildings come in two or more sizes compared to the single, universal types that were used in previous games. Settlements also need public utilities such as electricity with more or less polluting and more or less expensive types of power stations, water pumps, water purification plants, and waste management services. Facilities that had previously provided citywide coverage, such as educational facilities and medical facilities, have been modified to provide more limited coverage, as it has been with police stations and fire stations in previous &quot;SimCity&quot; titles.

Funding can be adjusted for individual buildings rather than having to change the funding to all buildings, allowing users to specify how much money should be spent to supply a service in accordance to the local population. Maintenance expenses for public utility facilities will increase as they age. The maximum output of facilities also decreases as they get older, with the rate dependent on the facility&#x27;s percentage of its capacity being used and level of funding. 
====MySim mode====
MySim mode enables players to create user-defined Sims, who will live and work in the city the player has created. When moving a Sim into a city, the player can choose from a selection of characters or import others from &quot;The Sims&quot;. Sims can be killed by certain disasters or catastrophic events, leave the city if conditions are unfavorable, or die of old age. After they die, their &quot;child&quot; sometimes takes over for them by taking their name, house, and job.

===Building designs===
Buildings in &quot;SimCity 4&quot; are based on four distinct architectural styles, which can be selected individually or simultaneously for buildings to be built from. The earliest era is based on early office towers from Chicago, Illinois, in the 1890s, the second era encompasses an Art Deco-based set from New York City based on the 1940s, the third includes a modernist/international style based on buildings from Houston, Texas in the 1990s, and the final is a modern European architecture based mostly around Germany in the 2000s. There are a number of buildings based on those found in San Francisco, including the Shell Building (appearing as &quot;Wren Insurance&quot;), 450 Sutter Street (appearing as &quot;Vu Financial&quot;), and the Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Building also known as 140 New Montgomery Street (as &quot;The Galvin Corp&quot;). The May Company store (now LACMA West) in Los Angeles appears as &quot;Dennis Department Store.&quot; The game also includes famous landmarks from various cities, such as the Empire State Building from New York City.

==Development==

===Graphics===
Unlike its predecessors, which used an engine based on 2D isometric graphics and sprites, &quot;SimCity 4&quot; primarily uses a 3D engine to render its graphics. The landscape and moving props such as vehicles are modeled as fully polygonal and rotatable 3D objects. Small buildings and props are drawn as flat images, which are pasted onto billboards; polygons with their surface normal facing into the camera. Larger buildings are modeled using a hybrid approach; a simple polygonal model defines the shape of the building, then textures are added to create detail such as doors, windows and rooftop clutter.

Although a 3D engine is used, the camera in &quot;SimCity 4&quot; is restricted to a fixed trimetric orthographic projection for performance reasons. Additionally, a simulated city can now be seen at nighttime as well as during daytime. The time of the day does not affect the gameplay.

===Audio===
The game includes over three hours of background music in MP3 format, ranging from three to eight minutes in length. The music is divided between that used in region mode and god mode, and that used in the city view in mayor mode and MySim mode. In addition, the game has a facility for players to use their own music in the game, also divided between the two views. The music, largely composed by Jerry Martin, was also released separately as a soundtrack.

==Add-ons and modifications==

===Maxis releases===
Following &quot;SimCity 4&quot; release, several add-ons and development kits were made available on its official site.

New landmarks, including Rockefeller Center, the Brandenburg Gate, and Stonehenge were made available online. Later, landmarks were primarily used to demonstrate the capability of Gmax and the Building Architect Tool (BAT) around the time of the BAT&#x27;s release.

The Terrain Generator tool allowed users to create maps based on any of the 48 contiguous United States. The maps are based on data collected by the United States Geological Survey.

The Building Architect Tool (BAT) is a suite of tools developed for producing custom buildings. The suite consists of three applications: The Building Architect game pack for Gmax, which enabled users to render Gmax models into &quot;SimCity 4&quot; sprites or props to be imported into the LE; an updated version of the LE; and the standalone Plug-in Manager, which enables users to modify simulation properties for new lots. Several modified versions have been released that have, in effect, served as bug fixes for various problems that had not been discovered before the initial release. First released in February 2004, it enabled the modding community to produce custom buildings and props for &quot;SC4&quot;. &quot;SimCity 4&quot; Building Architect Tool is similar in function to &quot;SimCity 3000&quot; Building Architect Tool and &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; Urban Renewal Kit; however, previous programs of this kind were created from scratch by Maxis and used completely different interfaces. The &quot;SC4&quot; BAT required a third-party application (Gmax) to function and was never bundled with &quot;SC4&quot; or the &quot;Rush Hour&quot; expansion pack, as &quot;SimCity 3000 Unlimited&quot; had with its own BAT.

The Lot Editor (LE) is a tool which allows users to edit or design lots for &quot;SimCity 4&quot; using available props. Because it was released several months before the BAT as a stand-alone version, users at the time were only capable of producing lots that consisted of built-in props from &quot;SC4&quot;. The BAT provided users with an updated version of the LE, which rendered the original LE utility obsolete. However, the old version is still made available in the official site.

===Third-party content===
In addition to official tools, third-party programs were released for further accessibility in editing &quot;SimCity 4&quot; contents, potentially allowing users to change the nature of the game itself. Following the release of the Lot Editor and the &quot;BAT&quot; (Building Architect Tool), the majority of add-ons in circulation consist of user-created content; most are buildings and lots, including real-life landmarks, chain stores, extra houses, etc., while others include cosmetic changes for terrain, flora, custom vehicles and modifications in the game&#x27;s behavior. Some even fundamentally change the mechanics of the game (for instance, by introducing multi-function transportation networks and stations, or by modifying the distance Sims are willing to walk in order to reach transit or their jobs). In some cases, both the skills of lot building and modding are combined, producing lots that are capable of affecting a city in a variety of ways. Some third-party content is only available to those with expansion packs or another mod.

==Reception==
===Sales===
In the United Kingdom, &quot;SimCity 4&quot; sold over 100,000 units during the first half of 2003. This made it the United Kingdom&#x27;s third-best-selling computer game for the period, or eighth across all platforms. At the time, Kristan Reed of GamesIndustry.biz wrote that its performance proved &quot;you can still have big hits on PC&quot;. By the end of the year, British sales of the game had reached 105,000 units, which made it 79th-biggest seller across all platforms that year. The game later received a &quot;Gold&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom. Its &quot;Deluxe&quot; edition earned a &quot;Silver&quot; award from ELSPA, for at least 100,000 sales.

===Reviews and awards===
Shortly after its release, the PC version of &quot;SimCity 4&quot; garnered mainly positive reviews, gaining 84/100 from Metacritic, and an 85.09% overall score from GameRankings.

The game got a 9.2/10 rating at &quot;IGN&quot;, calling it a &quot;major evolutionary step in the series&quot;. The review commented that the addition of the region view mode adds more depth to &quot;SimCity 4&quot; and that the gameplay has a &quot;more accurate representation of city planning and maintenance&quot; than of previous titles in the &quot;SimCity&quot; series.

The game scored an 8.1/10 rating at &quot;GameSpot&quot;, stating that the game had a &quot;sleek, attractive interface&quot; and &quot;great audio&quot;; it added however that &quot;SimCity 4&quot; was &quot;rather rushed&quot; and that the MySim mode &quot;seems like an afterthought.&quot; The review concluded that it was a &quot;complex and detailed strategy game,&quot; &quot;though not as polished as it could have been.&quot; The publication later named it the best computer game of January 2003.

&quot;GameSpy&quot; gave the game a score of 75/100, commenting that &quot;SimCity 4&quot; is &quot;graphically stunning&quot;; the review also criticized the game for having issues &quot;that will likely kill the game for casual players&quot; including performance and difficulty.

&quot;1UP&quot; rated the game at B+ and praised the region view feature as well as the detail of the graphics which create a &quot;deeper sense of simulation.&quot; The review however criticized &quot;SimCity 4&quot; for suffering crashes and performance issues.

&quot;SimCity 4&quot; received further reviews after the release of the Mac version. The game received a rating of 7.25/10 from &quot;InsideMacGames&quot;. The review commented that the regional gameplay was a &quot;new and welcome addition&quot; and that it had detailed and realistic graphics; it was also said however that the game was not &quot;revolutionary,&quot; had &quot;horrendous bugs,&quot; and that the tutorial and manual lacked information.

Urban planner Jeff Speck said that &quot;SimCity 4&quot;″s traffic model is &quot;more advanced than what most traffic engineers use in real life&quot;.

===Awards===

&quot;SimCity 4&quot; was chosen as one of IGN&#x27;s &quot;Editors&#x27; Choice&quot; games for January 2003. It was also given the Parents&#x27; Choice Award by the Parents&#x27; Choice Foundation.

==Additional content and releases==

===&quot;SimCity 4: Rush Hour&quot;===
On September 22, 2003, Maxis released an expansion pack for &quot;SimCity 4&quot; dubbed &quot;Rush Hour&quot;. The expansion pack enhances the range of transportation facilities available to the player, such as being able to build four-lane avenues and elevated rail networks, as well as allowing them to trace traffic flow, while also allowing them to construct larger civic facilities; some such facilities have greater capacities, but all have increased maintenance costs. Additional features with the expansion also included the ability to control vehicles, take on missions that can unlock reward buildings much faster, affect their rating with the city and sometimes acquire a cash bonus, and introduced the ability to change between four architectural styles - three of these focus on architectural styles of American cities of differing eras, while the fourth introduces a new range of contemporary European-inspired architecture.

On the same day that the expansion pack &quot;Rush Hour&quot; was released, a bundle pack combining both the main game and the expansion pack was released, entitled &quot;SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition&quot;. On August 25, 2004, Aspyr Media released &quot;SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition&quot; for Mac OS X.

A year later, the expansion was released for Mac OS X on September 4, 2004.

===Digital distribution release===
On July 20, 2010, Electronic Arts released the Deluxe Edition (&quot;SimCity 4&quot; and its &quot;Rush Hour&quot; expansion) for digital download on Steam, a digital distribution service by Valve. The game is also available on GOG.com, Direct2Drive and Impulse as well as EA&#x27;s own Origin service. On April 10, 2014, Aspyr released an updated version of their port of the Deluxe Edition on the Mac App Store. The updated version includes bug fixes and performance enhancements, native resolution support, and support for the latest versions of Mac OS X.

=== EA digital storefront controversy ===
Around 2014, it was discovered that the copy of SimCity 4 sold on EA&#x27;s own digital distribution platforms (Origin and later the EA App) was an outdated &quot;digital version&quot; that had a different checksum, rendering the game unpatchable even by Maxis&#x27; own update utilities. This version of the game lacked the stability and modding capabilities compared to those sold on other platforms, such as Steam or GOG.com. Following a small outcry from the SimCity 4 community on August 27, 2014, EA pushed an update that replaced the SimCity executable with the one being distributed on other platforms. However, on February 5, 2017, SimCity community members reported that their copy was once again downgraded to the unpatchable &quot;digital version,&quot; to which EA provided no explanation. During this duration, the SimCity 4 storefront page utilized screenshots containing community-made mods which were impossible to use on this version of the game. On June 1, 2023, EA once again upgraded the game to the version sold on other platforms.

===Future updates===
Will Wright stated in an interview on May 16, 2003, that there would probably be more expansion packs after &quot;Rush Hour&quot;, but none were ever released. In another interview on May 22, 2004, Wright stated that Maxis was attempting to work out a &quot;new direction&quot; for &quot;SimCity&quot; after new versions had become &quot;steadily more complex&quot;.

Two &quot;SimCity&quot; games for PC have followed &quot;SimCity 4&quot;. The first was &quot;SimCity Societies&quot;, which was developed by Tilted Mill Entertainment and released on November 13, 2007. The second was &quot;SimCity&quot;, which was announced in March 2012 and was released in March 2013.

== In popular culture ==
During the Republican presidential primaries of 2012, candidate Herman Cain&#x27;s 9-9-9 taxation proposal was widely attributed to a similar tax structure presented in &quot;SimCity 4&quot;; the CNBC cable networks relayed the story of the linkage of the &quot;SimCity&quot; &quot;ideal parameters&quot; as a possible origin of the taxation proposal (the story itself may have originated in the technical press), but Cain denied any link to the game.

<text>New Zealand literature is literature, both oral and written, produced by the people of New Zealand. It often deals with New Zealand themes, people or places, is written predominantly in New Zealand English, and features Māori culture and the use of the Māori language. Before the arrival and settlement of Europeans in New Zealand in the 19th century, Māori culture had a strong oral tradition. Early European settlers wrote about their experiences travelling and exploring New Zealand. The concept of a &quot;New Zealand literature&quot;, as distinct from English literature, did not originate until the 20th century, when authors began exploring themes of landscape, isolation, and the emerging New Zealand national identity. Māori writers became more prominent in the latter half of the 20th century, and Māori language and culture have become an increasingly important part of New Zealand literature.

New Zealand literature has developed into a major part of modern New Zealand culture through a growing readership, financial support and publicity for writers through literary awards and fellowships, and the development of literary journals and magazines. Many New Zealand writers have obtained local and international renown over the years, including the short-story writers Katherine Mansfield, Frank Sargeson and Jacquie Sturm, novelists Janet Frame, Patricia Grace, Witi Ihimaera, Maurice Gee, Keri Hulme and Eleanor Catton, poets James K. Baxter, Fleur Adcock, Selina Tusitala Marsh and Hone Tuwhare, children&#x27;s authors Margaret Mahy and Joy Cowley, historians Michael King and Judith Binney, and playwright Roger Hall.

==History==
===Early works: pre-1870===
Polynesian settlers began arriving in New Zealand in the late 13th or early 14th century, and became known as Māori developing a distinct culture, including oral myths, legends, poetry, songs (waiata), and prayers. Public speaking on the marae, a communal and sacred gathering place, was (and remains) a particularly important part of Māori culture, and performance was a key part of the oral tradition; for example the karanga (a ceremonial call) as part of the pōwhiri (welcoming ceremony). The first book published in Māori language was in 1815 called &quot;A korao (korero) no New Zealand; or, the New Zealander&#x27;s first book; being an attempt to compose some lessons for the instruction of the natives,&quot; printed in Sydney and written by Thomas Kendell in collaboration with Tuai, a young chief. Kendell, chief Hongi Hika, his nephew Waikato and linguist Samuel Lee developed a systematic written form of Māori language at Cambridge University in England in 1820. The first printing press arrived in New Zealand in 1834, and the first book printed in New Zealand was a Māori translation of a catechism in 1830 by William Yate, &quot;Ko Te Katikihama III&quot;.

In New Zealand, as European settlers arrived, they collected many Māori oral stories and poems, which were translated into English and published, such as &quot;Polynesian Mythology&quot; (1855) by George Grey and &quot;Maori Fairy Tales&quot; (1908) by Johannes Andersen. These stories, such as those about the god Māui, became widely known among the non-Māori population of New Zealand as well as the Māori people. A foundation was also laid for future Māori literature through Māori newspapers, Māori histories and literature associated with Māori religions, such as the Rātana and Pai Mārire movements.

In the 19th century, most Pākehā New Zealanders saw themselves as British, and most publications were written by British authors for a British audience. While the first uses of the term &quot;New Zealand literature&quot; appeared in the 1860s, it was used in an aspirational sense; it took time for a distinctly New Zealand literature to develop. Early New Zealand books were generally narratives of visits and travel to New Zealand, such as &quot;A Narrative of a Nine Months&#x27; Residence in New Zealand in 1827&quot; (1832) by Augustus Earle or &quot;Station Life in New Zealand&quot; (1870) by Mary Anne Barker, or scientific works such as &quot;The New Zealanders Illustrated&quot;, a rare book by natural history artist George French Angas (1847) and &quot;A History of the Birds of New Zealand&quot; (1872) by ornithologist Walter Buller. Early expressions of New Zealand identity in literature included, notably, &quot;Old New Zealand&quot; by &quot;a Pakeha Maori&quot; (Frederick Edward Maning) and &quot;Erewhon&quot; by Samuel Butler, which drew on the author&#x27;s experiences of living in Canterbury for five years.

===Maoriland movement: 1870–1914===
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, New Zealand nationalism began to emerge, with Pākehā writers adopting Māori stories and mythology. The term &quot;Maoriland&quot;, proposed and often used as an alternative name for New Zealand around this time, became the centre of a literary movement in which colonialist writers were inspired by and adopted Māori traditions and legends. They were encouraged by a widespread belief among settlers that the Māori were a dying race who would not survive contact with Europeans. Māori themselves were not creators or proponents of Maoriland work.

For example, Thomas Bracken&#x27;s book &quot;Musings in Maoriland&quot; included the poem &quot;New Zealand Hymn&quot;, which later became the New Zealand national anthem under the title &quot;God Defend New Zealand&quot;. Bracken and other poets such as Jessie Mackay and Arthur Henry Adams published poems about the Māori rangatira (chief) Te Rauparaha, while Alfred Grace, Jessie Weston, and others wrote fictional short stories and novels with Māori themes. New Zealand&#x27;s fourth premier, Alfred Domett, wrote an epic poem, &quot;Ranolf and Amohia: A South-Sea Day-Dream&quot; (1872), which was over 100,000 words long and described a romance between a shipwrecked European man and a Māori woman. In 1901, William Satchell launched a magazine called &quot;The Maorilander&quot;, and the leftwing labour journal &quot;The Maoriland Worker&quot; ran from 1910 to 1924. 

Colonial romances were popular, for example the works of Louisa Baker, Ellen Ellis, Edith Searle Grossmann and others, as were books about the New Zealand Wars were popular subject, typified by &quot;The Rebel Chief: A Romance of New Zealand&quot; (1896), by Hume Nisbet. The popular English children&#x27;s author G. A. Henty wrote &quot;Maori and Settler: A Tale of the New Zealand Wars&quot; (1890). Lady Barker wrote two books about life in New Zealand; &quot;Station Life in New Zealand&quot; (1870) and &quot;Station Amusements in New Zealand&quot; (1873), and her husband Frederick Broome wrote &quot;Poems from New Zealand&quot; (1868). 

Maoriland culture was artificial and grounded in romance rather than reality; as academics Jane Stafford and Mark Williams have said, &quot;Maoriland signifies an effort to deny the real presence of Maori in New Zealand in favour of a mythologised or decorative presence&quot;. For this reason, the term is now seen as archaic and colonial. By the time of the First World War, apart from a few individuals such as James Cowan and Rudall Hayward, the movement had largely ended. The term has been adopted in current times by the Māoriland Film Festival, an organisation in Ōtaki that promotes indigenous storytelling on screen.

===Early 20th century: 1914–1939===

New Zealand literature continued to develop in the early 20th century, with notable writers including the poet Blanche Edith Baughan and novelist Jane Mander. New Zealand&#x27;s most famous and influential writer in these years was the short-story writer Katherine Mansfield, who left New Zealand in 1908 and became one of the founders of literary modernism. She published three collections of stories in her lifetime: &quot;In a German Pension&quot; (1911), &quot;Bliss and Other Stories&quot; (1920) and &quot;The Garden Party and Other Stories&quot; (1922). She died in 1923, having (in the words of C. K. Stead) &quot;laid the foundations for a reputation that has gone on to grow and influence the development of New Zealand literature ever since&quot;. Another notable early writer was Ursula Bethell, whose first poetry collection was published in 1929; her poetry is ascribed by the &quot;Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Literature in English&quot; as having &quot;a plainness and spareness (as well as freshness of image) which distinguishes it from the more ornamented verse the country had previously produced&quot;. Edith Joan Lyttleton, who wrote as G.B. Lancaster, was New Zealand&#x27;s most commercially successful writer in this period, known for her epic colonial romances. Herbert Guthrie-Smith&#x27;s &quot;Tutira: The Story of a New Zealand Sheep Station&quot; (1921) was New Zealand&#x27;s first significant environmentalist publication, and remains a classic of ecological writing; Michael King said in 2003 that it is &quot;still the best example of this genre.&quot;

By the 1930s, New Zealand writing was starting to become established, assisted by the growth of universities and small publishers. Notable works included &quot;Man Alone&quot; (1939) by John Mulgan, an influential classic describing an isolated and alienated New Zealand man (which has itself become a cultural stereotype), influenced by the Great Depression, &quot;Show Down&quot; (1936) by Margaret Escott, and Frank Sargeson&#x27;s short story collection, &quot;A Man and His Wife&quot; (1940). It was common at this time for writers, like Mansfield, to leave New Zealand and establish careers overseas: including Mulgan, Dan Davin, who joined the Oxford University Press, and journalist Geoffrey Cox. Ngaio Marsh, who divided her time between New Zealand and England, wrote detective fiction in the 1930s and was known as one of the &quot;Queens of Crime&quot;. After the Depression, foreign theatre companies stopped touring New Zealand, which led to the establishment of a thriving amateur dramatic scene and playwrights such as Isobel Andrews achieving success through competitions held by the New Zealand Branch of the British Drama League.

Writing was still largely a Pākehā endeavour at this time; many Māori were living in rural areas and recovering from the loss of their land and language, depopulation, and educational challenges. Te Rangi Hīroa and Āpirana Ngata wrote non-fiction and collected Māori songs and chants for publication, but there were limited opportunities for Māori in written literature.

===Second World War and subsequent years: 1939–1960===
From 1941, New Zealand writing gained an international audience through John Lehmann&#x27;s periodical, &quot;Penguin New Writing&quot;. A local version was produced between 1942 and 1945. In 1945, Frank Sargeson edited an anthology of short stories by New Zealand writers, called &quot;Speaking for Ourselves&quot;, published by Caxton Press in New Zealand and by Reed &amp; Harris in Melbourne, Australia. It received favourable reviews and writer Janet Frame later remembered how the stories in the collection &quot;overwhelmed me by the fact of their belonging&quot;. In 1945, Allen Curnow published the anthology &quot;A Book of New Zealand Verse 1923–45&quot;, which marked the beginning of New Zealand literature&#x27;s post-colonial and nationalist phase; Charles Brasch compared it to &quot;a hard frost&quot; that &quot;killed off weeds, and promoted sound growth&quot;, and said it &quot;set a standard not for poetry alone but for all the arts&quot;. Curnow and Brasch were just two of their generation of poets who began their careers with Caxton Press in the 1930s, and had a major influence on New Zealand poetry; others in the group were A. R. D. Fairburn, R. A. K. Mason and Denis Glover. Their poems can be contrasted with the work of South African-born Robin Hyde, who was excluded from this nationalist group, but whose novel &quot;The Godwits Fly&quot; (1938) was considered a New Zealand classic and continuously in print until the 1980s. In 1946, the New Zealand Literary Fund was established to provide subsidies and scholarships for local publishing and writing.

It was in the 1950s that, as historian and poet Keith Sinclair said, &quot;New Zealand intellect and imagination came alive&quot;. By the 1950s there were a wide range of outlets for local literature, such as the influential journal &quot;Landfall&quot; (established in 1947), and the bilingual quarterly &quot;Te Ao Hou / The New World&quot;, which from 1952 to 1975 was a vehicle for Māori writers. Janet Frame&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Owls Do Cry&quot;, was published in 1957, and she became the most acclaimed and well-known New Zealand novelist of the 20th century. Her work often drew on her experiences in psychiatric hospitals and featured stylistic experimentation and exploration of social conditions.

A new generation of young New Zealand poets eventually emerged, in particular the &quot;Wellington Group&quot;, which rejected the nationalism of Curnow and the other Caxton poets. They argued that New Zealand poets could now focus on universal themes, rather than the New Zealand identity. James K. Baxter was the most famous and prolific of these poets, and is widely regarded today as the definitive New Zealand poet. Baxter was a controversial figure who was known for his incorporation of European myths into his New Zealand poems, his interest in Māori culture and language, his religious experiences, and the establishment of a commune at Jerusalem, New Zealand. Other members of the Wellington Group included Alistair Te Ariki Campbell and Fleur Adcock; the scholars C. K. Stead and Vincent O&#x27;Sullivan also became well-known for their poetry around this time.

==Modern literature==
===Māori and Pasifika writing===

After the Second World War, Māori began to move into urban areas and had more educational opportunities available, which led to the emergence of Māori writing in English. In 1948 the debut novel &quot;The Cunninghams&quot; by Māori author David Ballantyne was published. He was not promoted at that time as being a Maori author. In 1964, Hone Tuwhare, the first Māori poet to be distinguished for English poetry, published his first book, &quot;No Ordinary Sun&quot;, and in 1966 Jacquie Sturm became the first Māori writer to appear in a major anthology of New Zealand short stories. Authors like Sturm, Arapera Blank, Rowley Habib and Patricia Grace were published for the first time in &quot;Te Ao Hou&quot; and became widely known and respected. Witi Ihimaera was the first Māori writer to publish a collection of short stories (&quot;Pounamu, Pounamu)&quot; in 1972 and the first to publish a novel (&quot;Tangi)&quot; in 1973. His novel &quot;Whale Rider&quot; (1987) was adapted into an internationally successful film in 2002. The notable anthology &quot;Into the World of Light&quot; (1982), edited by Ihimaera and Don Long, collected the work of 39 Māori writers. The editors observed that publishers in the mid-20th century were reluctant to publish books by Māori writers because of a belief that Māori &quot;don&#x27;t read books&quot;. Grace was the first Māori woman writer to publish a short story collection (&quot;Waiariki)&quot; in 1975 and has since received international awards and acclaim for her books for adults and children. Keri Hulme and Alan Duff were the best-known Māori writers to follow Grace and Ihimaera. Duff is known for the widely acclaimed &quot;Once Were Warriors&quot; (1990), which became a successful 1994 film and has never been out of print.

A 1985 article published in the literary journal &quot;Landfall&quot; by Miriama Evans outlined a lack of publishing of Māori writers with the following being recognised but &quot;largely unpublished&quot;: Ani Hona (Te Aniwa Bisch) who received a Literary Fund grant in 1977, Rowley Habib who held the Katherine Mansfield Menton Fellowship in 1984, Bub Bridger who received a grant to attend the First International Feminist Book Fair (London) in 1984, and Bruce Stewart, who received grants from the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to represent New Zealand at The Association for Commonwealth Literature and Language Studies Conference in Fiji in 1985. The Māori owned independent publisher Huia Publishers was established in 1991 by Robyn Bargh to platform Māori writers and perspectives. 

Māori literature is closely connected to Pasifika literature. Notable Pasifika (Pacific Islander) writers with connections to New Zealand include Albert Wendt, Alistair Te Ariki Campbell, Karlo Mila, John Pule, Lani Wendt Young, Courtney Sina Meredith, Oscar Kightley and Selina Tusitala Marsh. 

Wendt is known for &quot;Sons for the Return Home&quot; (1973), which describes the experiences of a young Samoan man in New Zealand, and his later novels and short-story collections have formed the foundations for a Pasifika literature in English.

===Fiction===

Notable writers in the post-Second World War period include Janet Frame, Owen Marshall, Ronald Hugh Morrieson, Bill Pearson, Sylvia Ashton-Warner and Essie Summers. In the 1960s, two young novelists, Maurice Shadbolt and Maurice Gee, both became well-known for their traditional, socially realistic novels featuring New Zealand politics and history. Gee&#x27;s &quot;Plumb&quot; trilogy continues to be widely read, and the first novel, &quot;Plumb&quot; (1979), was voted by literary experts in 2018 to be the best New Zealand novel of the last fifty years. The feminist movement in the 1970s and 1980s was the context for many women writers who emerged in that period, including Fiona Kidman, Marilyn Duckworth and Barbara Anderson, who wrote works exploring and challenging gender roles.

New Zealand fiction has grown exponentially since the mid-1970s, due to a growing readership locally and internationally, creative writing courses such as the International Institute of Modern Letters at Victoria University of Wellington, and financial support through literary awards and scholarships. Internationally successful New Zealand writers include Elizabeth Knox, known for &quot;The Vintner&#x27;s Luck&quot; (1998) and her other diverse fiction, Emily Perkins, Fiona Farrell, Damien Wilkins, Nigel Cox and crime novelist Paul Cleave. Keri Hulme gained prominence when her novel, &quot;The Bone People&quot;, won the Booker Prize in 1985; she was the first New Zealander and the first debut novelist to win the prestigious award. Writer Lloyd Jones was shortlisted for his 2007 novel &quot;Mister Pip&quot;. In 2013, Eleanor Catton became the second New Zealand winner (as well as the youngest winner) of the award for her novel &quot;The Luminaries&quot;.

===Non-fiction===
New Zealand has a significant non-fiction tradition, with natural history, colonisation, Māori/Pākehā relations, childhood and identity being recurring themes. Important autobiographical works by New Zealand writers include trilogies by Frank Sargeson in the 1970s (&quot;Once is Enough&quot;, &quot;More than Enough&quot; and &quot;Never Enough!&quot;), Janet Frame in the 1980s (&quot;To the Is-land&quot;, &quot;An Angel at my Table&quot; and &quot;The Envoy from Mirror City&quot;), and C. K. Stead&#x27;s two-part series &quot;South-west of Eden&quot; (2010) and &quot;You Have a Lot to Lose&quot; (2020).

Much of New Zealand&#x27;s significant non-fiction is historical in nature. James Belich is known for his writing on the New Zealand Wars. Judith Binney is known for her biography of Te Kooti, &quot;Redemption Songs&quot; (1995) and her history of Tūhoe, &quot;Encircled Lands&quot; (2009). Linda Tuhiwai Smith&#x27;s 1999 academic work &quot;Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples&quot; has been an important contribution to Māori and indigenous research. 

Historian Michael King began his career writing biographies about notable Māori people, including biographies of Te Puea Hērangi (1977) and Whina Cooper (1983). In the mid-1980s, aware of the importance of allowing Māori voices to speak, he wrote about what it meant to be a non-Māori New Zealander in &quot;Being Pākehā&quot; (1985), and published biographies of Frank Sargeson (1995) and Janet Frame (2000). His &quot;Penguin History of New Zealand&quot; was the most popular New Zealand book of 2004 and was named by &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; in 2009 as the best book of the preceding decade. 

Recent essay collections by Asian New Zealand writers include &quot;All Who Live on Islands&quot; (2019) by Rose Lu and &quot;Small Bodies of Water&quot; (2021) by Nina Mingya Powles.

===Children&#x27;s and young adult literature===

Margaret Mahy and Joy Cowley both had their first children&#x27;s books published in 1969. Both became prolific and beloved authors, and have made a significant contribution to New Zealand children&#x27;s literature. Mahy won the Carnegie Medal twice in the 1980s and in 2001 she won the Hans Christian Andersen Award, the world&#x27;s most prestigious children&#x27;s literature award. Cowley is internationally known for her children&#x27;s educational books for children learning to read, as well as for her picture books, children&#x27;s fiction, and young adult novels. Other well-known authors for young children include Lynley Dodd (known for her picture books featuring small dog Hairy Maclary), Patricia Grace, Kāterina Mataira (a leading Māori language author), Gavin Bishop (known particularly for illustration) and Peter Gossage (known for his picture book retellings of Māori myths and legends).

New Zealand has a strong tradition of fantasy and social realism in novels for children and young adults. Maurice Gee became well-known for his science fiction and fantasy books, notably &quot;Under the Mountain&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Halfmen of O&quot; (1982). Other internationally well-known fantasy writers for children and young adults include Sherryl Jordan, Gaelyn Gordon, Elizabeth Knox, Barbara Else and David Hair. From the 1980s, young adult literature emerged in New Zealand, with authors like Gee, Jack Lasenby, Paula Boock, Kate De Goldi, Fleur Beale, and David Hill tackling serious and controversial topics for teenage readers. Tessa Duder&#x27;s &quot;Alex&quot; quartet (1987–1992) explored issues of sexism, racism and personal trauma in 1950s and 1960s New Zealand. Bernard Beckett and Mandy Hager became well-known in the 2000s for socially realistic and dystopian young adult fiction.

===Poetry===

James K. Baxter, Alistair Te Ariki Campbell, Fleur Adcock, C. K. Stead, and Vincent O&#x27;Sullivan became well-known for their poetry in the 1950s and 1960s, with Baxter in particular dominating New Zealand poetry in the 1960s. Adcock is one of only two New Zealanders to have received the prestigious Queen&#x27;s Gold Medal for Poetry (2006), with the other being Allen Curnow (who received the award in 1989). The 1970s and 1980s saw a shift away from New Zealand nationalism and the rise of confident young poets, often influenced by American writing and counterculture and writing about personal relationships; poets included Ian Wedde, Bill Manhire, Cilla McQueen, Elizabeth Smither, Sam Hunt and Murray Edmond. Cilla McQueen and Hunt are both well-known for their performance poetry. In 1985, Ian Wedde and Harvey McQueen edited and published a new edition of &quot;The Penguin Book of New Zealand Verse&quot;, which included poetry in Māori, a first for a New Zealand poetry anthology. Since then, New Zealand poetry has become more diverse and more difficult to characterise by theme.

The National Library of New Zealand appoints a New Zealand Poet Laureate every two years. Pasifika poet Selina Tusitala Marsh was the Poet Laureate from 2017 to 2019. David Eggleton is the Poet Laureate from 2019 to 2022 (his position being extended due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Other notable contemporary poets include Robert Sullivan, known for his first collection &quot;Jazz Waiata&quot; (1990) and more recent work including the collection &quot;Shout Ha! to the Sky&quot; (2010), Hera Lindsay Bird, known for her popular autobiographical and provocative work, and Karlo Mila, whose work addresses both personal and political issues such as concerns of identity, migration, and community, some of which is included in the collections &quot;Dream Fish Floating&quot; (2006) and &quot;Goddess Muscle&quot; (2020).

===Playwriting===

The 1960s saw significant developments in New Zealand playwriting, and the country&#x27;s first professional theatre, the Downstage Theatre, opened in Wellington in 1964. Playmarket was also founded in 1973 to represent and market New Zealand playwrights and their work. Bruce Mason was the country&#x27;s first professional playwright. His one-person show &quot;The End of the Golden Weather&quot; (1962), about a boy&#x27;s loss of innocence in Depression-era New Zealand, was performed widely throughout New Zealand, and he explored Māori themes and the disintegration of Māori identity in &quot;The Pohutakawa Tree&quot; (1960) and &quot;Awatea&quot; (1969). Mervyn Thompson, a controversial playwright, wrote plays with autobiographical and political elements such as &quot;O Temperance!&quot; (1974). In 1976, a group of Downstage actors left to found the Circa Theatre, and produced &quot;Glide Time&quot; by Roger Hall as one of their first productions. Hall became New Zealand&#x27;s most commercially successful playwright, and &quot;Glide Time&quot; became a New Zealand icon and was turned into a TV sitcom. Greg McGee&#x27;s &quot;Foreskin&#x27;s Lament&quot; (1981), about small-town rugby culture in New Zealand, likewise achieved iconic status.

Drama further developed in the 1980s and 1990s with new playwrights finding success, including Renée, Stuart Hoar, Hone Kouka and Briar Grace-Smith. Jean Betts&#x27;s feminist play &quot;Ophelia Thinks Harder&quot; (1993) was still widely performed in New Zealand and overseas as of 2014, and may be the most widely performed New Zealand play. The collective Pacific Underground developed the groundbreaking play &quot;Fresh off the Boat&quot; (1993), written by Oscar Kightley and Simon Small, which was praised for its portrayal of Samoan life in New Zealand. New Zealand also has a tradition of independent theatre with companies creating original plays and collective works, including the Red Mole theatre group (1970s–2002), Barbarian Productions in Wellington (led by Jo Randerson), the Christchurch Free Theatre, the work of poet Murray Edmond with the Living Theatre Troupe, and the early work of Paul Maunder with the Amamus Theatre.

==Literary awards==

In the early 20th century, literary competitions in New Zealand were hosted by newspapers and magazines, and the university colleges hosted some literary prizes such as the Macmillan Brown Prize. In the 1940s the government-run New Zealand Literary Fund began to offer state-sponsored literary prizes in a wide range of genres. The first private literary award was the biennial Katherine Mansfield Memorial Award, a short-story competition organised by the New Zealand Women Writers&#x27; Society and funded by the Bank of New Zealand, which became available in 1959; this award ran until 2015.

, the annual Ockham New Zealand Book Awards offer five principal prizes: fiction (currently known as the Jann Medlicott Acorn Prize for Fiction), general non-fiction (sponsored by Royal Society Te Apārangi), illustrated non-fiction, poetry (currently known as the Mary and Peter Biggs Award for Poetry) and Te Mūrau o te Tuhi Māori Language Award for books written entirely in te reo (Māori language). These annual awards have changed names several times due to different sponsors over the years, and were created in 1996 from the amalgamation of the Montana Book Awards (previously the Goodman Fielder Wattie Awards, running from 1968 to 1995) and the government-run New Zealand Book Awards (running from 1976 to 1995). The New Zealand Book Awards for Children and Young Adults are also presented annually to recognise excellence in literature for children and young adults. These awards began in 1982 and have had several name changes due to different sponsors over the years.

A number of literary fellowships are available in New Zealand. These fellowships give writers the opportunity to stay at a particular place with their accommodation and other costs funded. The first fellowship was the Robert Burns Fellowship, set up anonymously (although widely attributed to Charles Brasch) at the University of Otago in 1958. Another prestigious fellowship is the Katherine Mansfield Menton Fellowship, founded by a trust in 1970, which enables writers to spend at least three months in Menton, France, where Katherine Mansfield lived and wrote.

The Prime Minister&#x27;s Awards for Literary Achievement were established in 2003 and are awarded annually to writers who have made a significant contribution to New Zealand literature.

== Literary festivals ==
 There are a number of regular literary festivals held in different locations across New Zealand. Some are stand-alone and some are part of arts festivals. Stand-alone festivals include Going West (established in 1996), WORD Christchurch (established in 1997), the Auckland Writers Festival (established in 1999), the Dunedin Writers and Readers Festival (established in 2014), the Verb Writers Festival &amp; LitCrawl (established in 2014), the Hokianga Book Festival and the Whanganui Literary Festival. The small town of Featherston is one of 22 recognised book towns in the world and holds a Featherston Booktown event annually in May. Former literary festivals include New Zealand Book Month, which ran from 2006 to 2014. The Verb festival in Wellington in 2019 held a panel event where three out of five panellists were writers of Chinese heritage, Rosabel Tan, Gregory Kan and Chen Chen; writer Nina Mingya Powles said she thought this was the first time that had happened in New Zealand and that this felt like a &quot;groundbreaking moment&quot; for Chinese New Zealand writers.

Other literary events include the writers&#x27; section of the Hamilton Gardens Summer Festival (held in February and March), the Verb Wellington writers and readers programme at the New Zealand Festival (held every two years in March), the Aspiring Conversations with authors at the Festival of Colour (held in April in Wānaka), the New Zealand Mountain Film &amp; Book Festival focusing on adventurous sports and lifestyles (held every two years in Queenstown in July), the readers and writers&#x27; week at the Taranaki Arts Festival (held every two years in July and August), the readers and writers programme at the Tauranga Arts Festival (held every two years in October), the Hawke’s Bay Readers and Writers Festival (held annually in conjunction with the Hawke’s Bay Arts Festival, usually in mid to late October) and the Nelson Arts Festival Readers and Writers week (held annually in October). In 2020 and 2021 many literary festivals were disrupted or cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Literary journals and periodicals==
Early New Zealand literary journals included &quot;The Triad&quot; (founded by Charles Nalder Baeyertz in 1893 and closed in 1926), &quot;The New Zealand Illustrated Magazine&quot; (founded in Auckland in 1899 and closed in 1905) and &quot;Art in New Zealand&quot; (founded by Charles Allan Marris in 1928 and closed in 1946). The short-lived magazine &quot;Phoenix&quot;, published in 1932 by students at the University of Auckland and edited by James Munro Bertram and R. A. K. Mason, was an early outlet for New Zealand nationalist writers such as Brasch and Curnow. Left-wing artist Kennaway Henderson founded the fortnightly magazine &quot;Tomorrow&quot; in 1934, which was influential in shaping New Zealand nationalist literature and literary criticisms, but was shut down by the government as subversive in 1940. Other early journals and magazines included &quot;New Zealand Mercury&quot; (a poetry magazine established by Helen Langford, 1933 to 1936), &quot;Oriflamme&quot; and &quot;Sirocco&quot; (published in 1933 by students of Canterbury University College, including Denis Glover), &quot;Book&quot; (featuring Caxton Press writers and edited by Anton Vogt, 1942 to 1947) and the &quot;New Zealand Railways Magazine&quot; (published by the Railway Department from 1926 to 1940).

In 1947, Caxton Press began publishing the quarterly journal &quot;Landfall&quot;, edited by Charles Brasch; it is still published today on a twice-yearly basis. The journal has been described by Peter Simpson as &quot;the most important and long-lasting journal in New Zealand&#x27;s literature&quot;. Brasch&#x27;s successor as editor, Robin Dudding, left &quot;Landfall&quot; in 1972 to set up a competing journal called &quot;Islands&quot;, and some of &quot;Landfall&quot;&#x27;s key contributors switched their allegiance to this new journal; &quot;Landfall&quot; did not recover its status as the leading literary journal of New Zealand until the editorship of David Dowling in the early 1980s. Other important literary journals in New Zealand include &quot;Sport&quot;, founded by Fergus Barrowman in 1988, &quot;takahē&quot;, a Christchurch journal founded in 1989 focussing on short stories, poetry, and art, and &quot;Poetry New Zealand,&quot; which has published local and overseas work since 1993.

The magazine &quot;New Zealand Listener&quot; was founded by the government in 1939 to publish radio listings, but extended its brief to cover current affairs, opinion, and literary works. Among the writers featured in the magazine over the years were Maurice Duggan, Noel Hilliard, Keith Sinclair, Maurice Shadbolt, Fiona Kidman, and Joy Cowley, and poets James K. Baxter, Allen Curnow, Ruth Gilbert, and Ruth France. In 1990, the magazine was privatised and subsequently became more of a lifestyle magazine, although it continues to have a focus on literary works. Another important government-founded magazine was &quot;Te Ao Hou / The New World&quot;, a quarterly magazine published in both English and Māori from 1952 to 1975 by the Māori Affairs Department; it was the first national magazine for Māori. The &quot;New Zealand School Journal&quot; was founded by the New Zealand Department of Education in 1907 and has been published by a private firm since 2013; since the 1940s it been known for the high quality of its children&#x27;s literature.

<text>BBC Radio is an operational business division and service of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) which has operated in the United Kingdom under the terms of a royal charter since 1927. The service provides national radio stations covering the majority of musical genres, as well as local radio stations covering local news, affairs, and interests. It also oversees online audio content.

Of the national radio stations, BBC Radio 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 Live are all available through analogue radio (MW or FM, also BBC Radio 4 broadcasts on longwave) as well as on DAB Digital Radio and BBC Sounds. The Asian Network broadcasts on DAB and selected AM frequencies in the English Midlands. BBC Radio 1Xtra, 4 Extra, 5 Sports Extra, 6 Music and the World Service broadcast only on DAB and BBC Sounds, while Radio 1&#x27;s Dance and Anthems streams and Radio 3&#x27;s Unwind stream are available only online.

All of the BBC&#x27;s national radio stations broadcast from bases in London and Manchester, usually in or near to Broadcasting House or MediaCityUK. However, the BBC&#x27;s network production units located in Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff and Glasgow also make radio programmes.

==History==

The BBC&#x27;s radio services began in 1922. The British Government licensed the BBC through its General Post Office, which had original control of the airwaves because they had been interpreted under law as an extension of the Post Office services. Today radio broadcasting still makes up a large part of the corporation&#x27;s output – the title of the BBC&#x27;s listings magazine, &quot;Radio Times&quot;, reflects this.

===First charter===
On 1 January 1927, the British Broadcasting Company was succeeded in monopoly control of the airwaves by the British Broadcasting Corporation, under the terms of a royal charter.

John Reith, who had been the founding managing director of the commercial company, became the first Director-General. He expounded firm principles of centralised, all-encompassing radio broadcasting, stressing programming standards and moral tone. These he set out in his 1924 autobiography, &quot;Broadcast Over Britain&quot;, influencing modern ideas of public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom. To this day, the BBC aims to follow the Reithian directive to &quot;inform, educate and entertain&quot;.

===Competition from overseas stations===

Although no other broadcasting organisation was licensed in the UK until 1973, commercial competition soon opened up from overseas. The English language service of Radio Luxembourg began in 1933 as one of the earliest commercial radio stations broadcasting to Britain and Ireland. With no possibility of domestic commercial broadcasting in the UK, a former British Royal Air Force captain and entrepreneur (and from 1935 Conservative Party MP) named Leonard Plugge set up his own International Broadcasting Company in 1931. The IBC began leasing time on transmitters in continental Europe and then reselling it as sponsored English-language programming aimed at audiences in Britain and Ireland. Because Plugge successfully demonstrated that state monopolies such as that of the BBC could be broken, other parties became attracted to the idea of creating a new commercial radio station specifically for this purpose. It was an important forerunner of pirate radio and modern commercial radio in the United Kingdom. The onset of World War II silenced all but one of the original IBC stations, with only Radio Luxembourg continuing its nightly transmissions to Britain.

===Empire and the world===

To provide a different service from the domestic audience the Corporation started the BBC Empire Service on short wave in 1932, originally in English but it soon provided programmes in other languages. At the start of the Second World War it was renamed The Overseas Service and is now known as the BBC World Service.

===Commercial radio influence===

Beginning in March 1964, Radio Caroline became the first of what would become ten offshore pirate radio stations that began to ring the British coastline, mostly along the south-east coast. By 1966 millions were tuning into these commercial stations, and the BBC was rapidly losing its radio listening audience. This was largely due to the fact that even though they were fully aware of the problem, the BBC still only played a few hours of pop music records a week, as opposed to the pirates which broadcast chart music and new releases every day.

The British government reacted by passing the Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967, which virtually wiped out all of the pirate stations at midnight on 14 August 1967, by banning any British citizen from working for a pirate station. Only Radio Caroline survived, and continues to broadcast today, though the last original offshore broadcast was in 1989.

One of the stations, Radio London (also known as &quot;Big L&quot;), was so successful that the BBC was told to copy it as best they could. This led to a complete overhaul by Frank Gillard, the BBC&#x27;s director of radio output, creating the four analogue channels that still form the basis of its broadcasting today. The creator of Radio 1 told the press that his family had been fans of Radio London.

The BBC hired many out-of-work broadcasting staff who had come from the former offshore stations. Kenny Everett was asked for input in how to run the new pop station due to his popularity with both listeners and fellow presenters. Tony Blackburn, who presented the first &quot;Radio 1 Breakfast&quot; show, had previously presented the morning show on Radio Caroline and later on Radio London. He attempted to duplicate the same sound for Radio 1. Among the other DJs hired was John Peel, who had presented the overnight show on Radio London, called &quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot;. Though it only ran for a few months prior to Radio London&#x27;s closure, &quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot; got more fan mail than the rest of the pop DJs on Radio London combined, so much that staff wondered what to do with it all. The reason it got so much mail was that it played different music and was the beginning of the &quot;album rock&quot; genre. On Everett&#x27;s suggestion, Radio London&#x27;s PAMS jingles were commissioned to be re-recorded in Dallas, Texas, so that &quot;&quot;Wonderful Radio London&quot; became &quot;Wonderful Radio One on BBC&quot;&quot;.

The BBC&#x27;s more popular stations have encountered pressure from the commercial sector. John Myers, who had developed commercial brands such as Century Radio and Real Radio, was asked in the first quarter of 2011 to conduct a review into the efficiencies of Radios 1, 2, 1Xtra and 6 Music. His role, according to Andrew Harrison, the chief executive of RadioCentre, was &quot;to identify both areas of best practice and possible savings.&quot;

===BBC analogue networks===
On 30 September 1967:
*BBC Radio 1 was launched as a pop music station, initially on a part-time basis.
*The BBC Light Programme (launched 29 July 1945) was renamed BBC Radio 2 and broadcast easy listening music, folk, jazz, light entertainment and sport. 
*The evening BBC Third Programme (launched 29 September 1946) and daytime BBC Music Programme (launched 22 March 1965) were merged under the heading of BBC Radio 3, although the Third Programme kept its separate title until 3 April 1970.
*The BBC Home Service (launched 1 September 1939) became BBC Radio 4.
*BBC Radio 5 was launched on 27 August 1990 as a home for sport and educational and children&#x27;s programming, but was replaced by BBC Radio 5 Live, a dedicated news and sport network, on 28 March 1994.

===2002 digital radio networks===
With the increased rollout of Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) between 1995 and 2002, BBC Radio launched several new digital-only stations BBC 1Xtra, BBC 6 Music and BBC 7 in 2002 on 16 August, 11 March and 15 December respectively – the first for &quot;new black British music&quot;, the second as a source of performance-based &quot;alternative&quot; music, the latter specialising in archive classic comedy shows, drama and children&#x27;s programmes. BBC Asian Network joined the national DAB network on 28 October 2002. The stations had &quot;Radio&quot; added to their names in 2008. In 2011, BBC Radio 7 was renamed BBC Radio 4 Extra and the service was more closely aligned with Radio 4.

===2020s spin-off stations===
At the start of the 2020s, two Radio 1 spin-offs were launched on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio 1 Dance in October 2020, followed by BBC Radio 1 Relax in April 2021.

In February 2024, the corporation announced plans to launch three new spin-offs, pending public consultation and regulatory approval: one from Radio 1 for &quot;music from the 2000s and 2010s, catering to the appetite from young audiences for recent nostalgia&quot;; one from Radio 2, with &quot;&#x27;a distinctive take on pop nostalgia&#x27; from the 50s, 60s, and 70s&quot;; and one from Radio 3 for &quot;calming classical music&quot;. In addition, Radio 1 Dance would launch on DAB expanded programming.

==Stations==
===National (UK-wide)===
The BBC today runs national domestic radio stations, six of which are available in analogue formats (via FM or AM), while other have a purely digital format – they can be received via DAB Digital Radio, UK digital television (satellite, cable and Freeview) plus live streams and listen again on BBC Sounds.

===Nations, regions and local stations===
The BBC also operates radio stations for three UK nations: Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. These stations focus on local issues to a greater extent than their UK-wide counterparts, organising live phone-in debates about these issues, as well as lighter talk shows with music from different decades of the 20th and 21st centuries. Compared to the majority of the UK&#x27;s commercially funded radio stations, which generally broadcast little beyond contemporary popular music, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;national regional&quot; stations offer a more diverse range of programming.

*BBC Radio Wales: A variety of programming, in English, for Wales.
*BBC Radio Cymru: Programming in Welsh language, with opt-out station BBC Radio Cymru 2.
*BBC Radio Scotland: A variety of programming, in English, for Scotland; it has Orkney and Shetland opt-outs.
*BBC Radio nan Gàidheal: Programming in Scottish Gaelic language.
*BBC Radio Ulster: A variety of programming for Northern Ireland; it has an opt-out station, BBC Radio Foyle.

====Local services====
There are forty BBC Local Radio services across England and the Channel Islands, often catering to individual counties, cities, or wider regions.

===World Service===
BBC World Service is the world&#x27;s largest international broadcaster, broadcasting in 27 languages to many parts of the world via analogue and digital shortwave, internet streaming and podcasting, satellite, FM and MW relays and simulcast on Radio 4 from 01:00-05:20 BST and Radio Cymru from 00:00-05:30 BST. It is politically independent (by mandate of the Agreement providing details of the topics outlined in the BBC Charter), non-profit, and commercial-free. The English language service had always had a UK listenership on LW and therefore DAB Services allowed, by this popular demand, it to be now available 24/7 for this audience in better quality reception.
===Live BBC News===
A 24-hour news station mixing the flagship news programmes from BBC News Channel, BBC Radio 4, BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC World Service 
==Broadcasting==
BBC Radio services are broadcast on various FM and AM frequencies, DAB digital radio and live streaming on BBC Sounds, which is available worldwide.

They are also available on digital television in the UK, and archived programmes are available for 30 days or more after broadcast on BBC Sounds; many shows are available as podcasts.

===International syndication===
The BBC also syndicates radio and podcast content to radio stations and other broadcasting services around the globe, through its BBC Radio International business, which is part of BBC Studios. Programmes regularly syndicated by BBC Radio International include: In Concert (live rock music recordings from BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 2, including an archive dating back to 1971); interviews, live sessions and music shows; classical music (including performances from the BBC Proms); spoken word (music documentaries, dramas, readings, features and comedies, mainly from BBC Radio 4) and channels, including BBC Radio 1.

BBC Radio International also provides many services internationally including in-flight entertainment, subscription, and satellite services. BBC Radio International is partnered with Sirius Satellite Radio and British Airways as well as many other local radio stations.

<text>The Washington Monument is an obelisk on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., built to commemorate George Washington, a Founding Father of the United States, victorious commander-in-chief of the Continental Army from 1775 to 1783 in the American Revolutionary War, and the first president of the United States from 1789 to 1797. Standing east of the Reflecting Pool and the Lincoln Memorial, the monument is made of bluestone gneiss for the foundation and of granite for the construction. The outside facing consists, due to the interrupted building process, of three different kinds of white marble: in the lower third, marble from Baltimore County, Maryland, followed by a narrow zone of marble from Sheffield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts, and, in the upper part, the so-called Cockeysville Marble. Both &quot;Maryland Marbles&quot; came from the &quot;lost&quot; Irish Quarry Town of &quot;New Texas&quot;. It is both the world&#x27;s tallest predominantly stone structure and the world&#x27;s tallest obelisk, standing tall, according to U.S. National Geodetic Survey measurements in 2013 and 2014. It is the tallest monumental column in the world if all are measured above their pedestrian entrances. It was the world&#x27;s tallest structure between 1884 and 1889, after which it was overtaken by the Eiffel Tower, in Paris. Previously, the tallest structures were Lincoln Cathedral (1311–1548; 525 ft/160 m) and Cologne Cathedral (1880–1884; 515 ft/157 m).

Construction of the presidential memorial began in 1848. The construction was suspended from 1854 to 1877 due to funding challenges, a struggle for control over the Washington National Monument Society, and the American Civil War. The stone structure was completed in 1884, and the internal ironwork, the knoll, and installation of memorial stones was completed in 1888. A difference in shading of the marble, visible about or 27% up, shows where construction was halted and later resumed with marble from a different source. The original design was by Robert Mills from South Carolina, but construction omitted his proposed colonnade for lack of funds, and construction proceeded instead with a bare obelisk. The cornerstone was laid on July 4, 1848; the first stone was laid atop the unfinished stump on August 7, 1880; the capstone was set on December 6, 1884; the completed monument was dedicated on February 21, 1885; it opened on October 9, 1888.

The Washington Monument is a hollow Egyptian-style stone obelisk with a column surmounted by a pyramidion. Its walls are thick at its base and thick at their top. The marble pyramidion&#x27;s walls are thick, supported by six arches: two between opposite walls, which cross at the center of the pyramidion, and four smaller arches in the corners. The top of the pyramidion is a large, marble capstone with a small aluminum pyramid at its apex, with inscriptions on all four sides. The bottom of the walls, built during the first phase from 1848 to 1854, are composed of a pile of bluestone gneiss rubble stones (not finished stones) held together by a large amount of mortar with a facade of semi-finished marble stones about thick. The upper of the walls, built in the second phase, 1880–1884, are of finished marble surface stones, half of which project into the walls, partly backed by finished granite stones.

The interior is occupied by iron stairs that spiral up the walls, with an elevator in the center, each supported by four iron columns, which do not support the stone structure. The stairs are in fifty sections, most on the north and south walls, with many long landings stretching between them along the east and west walls. These landings allowed many inscribed memorial stones of various materials and sizes to be easily viewed while the stairs were accessible (until 1976), plus one memorial stone between stairs that is difficult to view. The pyramidion has eight observation windows, two per side, and eight red aircraft warning lights, two per side. Two aluminum lightning rods, connected by the elevator support columns to groundwater, protect the monument. The monument&#x27;s present foundation is thick, consisting of half of its original bluestone gneiss rubble encased in concrete. At the northeast corner of the foundation, below ground, is the marble cornerstone, including a zinc case filled with memorabilia. Fifty U.S. flags fly on a large circle of poles centered on the monument, representing each U.S. state. In 2001, a temporary screening facility was added to the entrance to prevent a terrorist attack. The 2011 Virginia earthquake slightly damaged the monument, and it was closed until 2014. The monument was closed for elevator repairs, security upgrades, and mitigation of soil contamination in August 2016 before reopening again fully in September 2019.

==History==
===Rationale===
George Washington (1732–1799), hailed as the father of his country, and as the leader who was &quot;first in war, first in peace and first in the hearts of his countrymen&quot;, as Maj. Gen. &#x27;Light-Horse Harry&#x27; Lee eulogized at Washington&#x27;s December 26, 1799, funeral, was the dominant military and political leader of the new United States of America from 1775 to 1799.

At Washington&#x27;s death in 1799, he was the unchallenged public icon of U.S. military and civic patriotism. He was also identified with the Federalist Party, which lost control of the national government in 1800 to the Jeffersonian Republicans, who were reluctant to celebrate the hero of the opposition party.

===Proposals===
Starting with victory in the American Revolutionary War, there were many proposals to build a monument to Washington, beginning with an authorization in 1783 by the old Confederation Congress to erect an equestrian statue of the General in a future U.S. national capital city. After his December 1799 death, the United States Congress authorized a suitable memorial in the planned national capital then under construction since 1791, but the decision was reversed when the Democratic-Republican Party (Jeffersonian Republicans) took control of Congress in 1801 after the pivotal 1800 Election, with the first change of power between opposing political parties. The Republicans were dismayed that Washington had become the symbol of the Federalist Party; furthermore the values of Republicanism seemed hostile to the idea of building monuments to powerful men. They also blocked his image on coins or the celebration of his birthday. Further political squabbling, along with the North–South division on the Civil War, blocked the completion of the Washington Monument until the late 19th century. By that time, Washington had the image of a national hero who could be celebrated by both North and South, and memorials to him were no longer controversial.

As early as 1783, the old Confederation Congress (successors after 1781 to the earlier Second Continental Congress) had resolved &quot;That an equestrian statue of George Washington be erected at the place where the residence of Congress shall be established&quot;. The proposal called for engraving on the statue which explained it had been erected &quot;in honor of George Washington, the illustrious Commander-in-Chief of the Armies of the United States of America during the war which vindicated and secured their liberty, sovereignty, and independence&quot;. Currently, there are two equestrian statues of President Washington in the national capital city of Washington, D.C. One is located in Washington Circle at the intersection of the Foggy Bottom and West End neighborhoods at the north end of the George Washington University campus, and the other is in the gardens of the National Cathedral of the Episcopal Church on Mount St. Alban in northwest Washington.

On December 24, 1799, 10 days after Washington&#x27;s death, a U.S. Congressional committee recommended a different type of monument. John Marshall (1755–1835), a Representative from Virginia (who later became Chief Justice of the United States, 1801–1835) proposed that a tomb be erected within the Capitol and it was designed later to place such a crypt sepulchre below the rotunda of the great dome. However, a lack of funds, disagreement over what type of memorial would best honor the country&#x27;s first president, and the Washington family&#x27;s reluctance to move his body from Mount Vernon prevented progress on any project.

===Design===

Progress toward a memorial finally began in 1833. That year a group of citizens formed the Washington National Monument Society. Three years later, in 1836, after they had raised $28,000 in donations (), they announced a competition for the design of the memorial.

On September 23, 1835, the board of managers of the society described their expectations:
The society held a competition for designs in 1836. In 1845, the winner was announced to be architect Robert Mills, supposedly the first native-born American to be professionally trained as an architect. The citizens of Baltimore had chosen him in 1814 to build one of the first monuments to George Washington originally planned for the former courthouse square in their port city, and he had designed a tall elaborately decorated Greek column with balconies, surmounted by a statue of the President. Mills&#x27; Baltimore monument, with cornerstone laid and construction begun in 1815, was later simplified to a plain column shaft with a statue of a toga-clad Washington at the top when it was completed in 1829 but moved (because of its height) to the then rural hills to the north, where the city&#x27;s growth would later extend. Mills also knew the capital well, with its being only southwest of Baltimore, and his having just been chosen Architect of Public Buildings for Washington. His design called for a circular colonnaded building in diameter and high from which sprang a four-sided obelisk high, for a total elevation of . A massive cylindrical pillar in diameter supported the obelisk at the center of the building. The obelisk was to be square at the base and square at the top with a slightly peaked roof. Both the obelisk and pillar were hollow within which a railway spiraled up. The obelisk had no doorway—instead its interior was entered from the interior of the pillar upon which it was mounted. The pillar had an &quot;arched way&quot; at its base. The top of the portico of the building would feature Washington standing in a chariot holding the reins of six horses. Inside the colonnade would be statues of 30 prominent Revolutionary War heroes as well as statues of the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence.

Criticism of Mills&#x27;s design came up already in 1847, when architect Henry Robinson Searle from Rochester presented an alternative concept, backed by three objections against Mill&#x27;s project.: 
Morerover the estimated price tag of more than $1 million (in 1848 money, ) caused the society to hesitate. On April 11, 1848, the society decided, due to a lack of funds, to build only a simple plain obelisk. Mills&#x27;s 1848 obelisk was to be tall, square at the base and square at the top. It had two massive doorways, each high and wide, on the east and west sides of its base. Surrounding each doorway were raised jambs, a heavy pediment, and entablature within which was carved an Egyptian-style winged sun and asps. This original design conformed to a massive temple which was to have surrounded the base of the obelisk, but because it was never built, the architect of the second phase of construction Thomas Lincoln Casey smoothed down the projecting jambs, pediment and entablature in 1885, walled up the west entrance with marble forming an alcove, and reduced the east entrance to high. The western alcove has contained a bronze statue of Washington since 1992. Also, in 1992 and 1993 a limestone surround was installed at the east elevator entrance decorated with a winged sun and asps to mimic Mills&#x27;s 1848 design.

===Construction===

The Washington Monument was originally intended to be located at the point at which a line running directly south from the center of the White House crossed a line running directly west from the center of the U.S. Capitol on Capitol Hill. French-born military engineer Pierre (Peter) Charles L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s 1791 visionary &quot;Plan of the city intended for the permanent seat of the government of the United States ...&quot; designated this point as the location of the proposed central equestrian statue of George Washington that the old Confederation Congress had voted for in 1783, at the end of the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) in a future American national capital city. The ground at the intended location proved to be too unstable to support a structure as heavy as the planned obelisk, so the monument&#x27;s location was moved east-southeast. At that originally intended site there now stands a small monolith called the Jefferson Pier. Consequently, the McMillan Plan specified that the Lincoln Memorial should be &quot;placed on the main axis of the Capitol and the Monument&quot;, about 1° south of due west of the Capitol or the monument, not due west of the Capitol or the monument.

====Excavation and initial construction====
Construction of the monument finally began three years later in 1848 with the excavation of the site, the laying of the cornerstone on the prepared bed, and laying the original foundation around and on top of the cornerstone, before the construction of its massive walls began the next year. Regarding modern claims of slave labor being used in construction, Washington Monument historian John Steele Gordon stated &quot;I can&#x27;t say for certain, but the stonemasonry was pretty highly skilled, so it&#x27;s unlikely that slaves would&#x27;ve been doing it. The stones were cut by stonecutters, which is highly skilled work; and the stones were hoisted by means of steam engines, so you&#x27;d need a skilled engineer and foreman for stuff like that. Tending the steam engine, building the cast-iron staircase inside—that wasn&#x27;t grunt work. ... The early quarries were in Maryland, so slave labor was undoubtedly used to quarry and haul the stone&quot; Abraham Riesman, who quoted Gordon, states &quot;there were plenty of people who worked as skilled laborers while enslaved in antebellum America. Indeed, there were enslaved people who worked as stonemasons. So the possibility remains that there were slaves who performed some of the necessary skilled labor for the monument.&quot; According to historian Jesse Holland, it is very likely that African American slaves were among the construction workers, given that slavery prevailed in Washington and its surrounding states at that time, and slaves were commonly used in public and private construction.

Gordon&#x27;s arguments are valid for the second phase (1879–1888) after slavery was abolished when every stone laid required dressing and polishing by a skilled stonemason. This includes the iron staircase which was constructed 1885–86. That the stonecutters in the quarry were slaves is confirmed because all quarry workers were slaves during the construction of the United States Capitol during the 1790s. However, Holland&#x27;s views are valid for the first phase because most of its construction only required unskilled manual labor. No information survives concerning the method used to lift stones that weighed several tons each during the first phase, whether by a manual winch or a steam engine. The surviving information concerning slaves that built the core of the United States Capitol during the 1790s is not much help. At the time, the District of Columbia outside of Georgetown was sparsely populated so the federal government rented slaves from their owners who were paid a fee for their slaves&#x27; normal daily labor. Any overtime for Sundays, holidays, and nights was paid directly to the slaves which they could use for daily needs or to save to buy their freedom. Conversely, the first phase of the monument was constructed by a private entity, the Washington National Monument Society, which may not have been as magnanimous as the federal government, but most information was lost during the 1850s while two Societies vied for control of the monument. Useful information concerning the use of slaves during the major expansion of the Capitol during the 1850s, nearly contemporaneous with the monument&#x27;s first phase, does not exist.

Only a small number of stones used in the first phase required a skilled stonemason, the marble blocks on the outer surface of the monument (their inner surfaces were left very rough) and those gneiss stones that form the rough inner walls of the monument (all other surfaces of those inner stones within the walls were left jagged). The vast majority of all gneiss stones laid during the first phase, those between the outer and inner surfaces of the walls, from very large to very small jagged stones, form a pile of rubble held together by a large amount of mortar. The top surface of this rubble can be seen below at Walls in an 1880 drawing made just before the polished/rough marble and granite stones used in the second phase were laid atop it. The original foundation below the walls was made of layered gneiss rubble, but without the massive stones used within the walls. Most of the gneiss stones used during the first phase were obtained from quarries in the upper Potomac River Valley. Almost all the marble stones of the first and second phases was Cockeysville Marble, obtained from quarries north of downtown Baltimore in rural Baltimore County where stone for their first Washington Monument was obtained.

On Independence Day, July 4, 1848, the Freemasons, the same organization to which Washington belonged, laid the cornerstone (symbolically, not physically). According to Joseph R. Chandler:

Two years later, on a July 4, 1850, George Washington Parke Custis (1781–1857), the adopted son of George Washington and grandson of Martha Washington (1731–1802), dedicated a stone from the people of the District of Columbia to the Monument at a ceremony that 12th President Zachary Taylor (1784–1850, served 1849–1850) attended, just five days before he died from food poisoning.

====Donations run out====

Construction continued until 1854, when donations ran out and the monument had reached a height of . At that time a memorial stone that was contributed by Pope Pius IX, called the Pope&#x27;s Stone, was destroyed by members of the anti-Catholic, nativist American Party, better known as the &quot;Know-Nothings&quot;, during the early morning hours of (a priest replaced it in 1982 using the Latin phrase &quot;A Roma Americae&quot; instead of the original stone&#x27;s English phrase &quot;Rome to America&quot;). Economic and political conditions of the time caused public contributions to the Washington National Monument Society to cease, so they appealed to Congress for money.

The request had just reached the floor of the House of Representatives when the Know-Nothing Party seized control of the Society on February 22, 1855, a year after construction funds ran out. Congress immediately tabled its expected contribution of $200,000 to the Society, effectively halting the Federal appropriation. During its tenure, the Know-Nothing Society added only two courses of masonry, or , to the monument using rejected masonry it found on site, increasing the height of the shaft to . The original Society refused to recognize the takeover, so the two rival Societies existed side by side until 1858. With the Know-Nothing Party disintegrating and unable to secure contributions for the monument, it surrendered its possession of the monument to the original Society three and a half years later on . To prevent future takeovers, the U.S. Congress incorporated the Society on with a stated charter and set of rules and procedures.

====Post–Civil War====

The American Civil War (1861–1865), halted all work on the monument, but interest grew after the war&#x27;s end. Engineers studied the foundation several times to determine if it was strong enough for continued construction after 20 years of effective inactivity. In 1876, the American Centennial of the Declaration of Independence, Congress agreed to appropriate another $200,000 to resume construction.

Before work could begin again, arguments about the most appropriate design resumed. Many people thought a simple obelisk, one without the colonnade, would be too bare. Architect Mills was reputed to have said omitting the colonnade would make the monument look like &quot;a stalk of asparagus&quot;; another critic said it offered &quot;little ... to be proud of&quot;.

This attitude led people to submit alternative designs. Both the Washington National Monument Society and Congress held discussions about how the monument should be finished. The Society considered five new designs and an anonymous &quot;interesting project of California&quot; (which later turned out to be by Arthur Frank Mathews), concluding that the one by William Wetmore Story, seemed &quot;vastly superior in artistic taste and beauty&quot;. Congress deliberated over those five proposals (among others by Paul Schulze, who built Boylston Hall and John Fraser as well as Mills&#x27;s original. While it was deciding, it ordered work on the obelisk to continue. Finally, the members of the society agreed to abandon the colonnade and alter the obelisk so it conformed to classical Egyptian proportions.

====Resumption====
Construction resumed in 1879 under the direction of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Lincoln Casey of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Casey redesigned the foundation, strengthening it so it could support a structure that ultimately weighed more than 40,000 tons (). The first stone atop the unfinished stump was laid on August 7, 1880, in a small ceremony attended by President Rutherford B. Hayes, Casey and a few others. The president placed a small coin on which he had scratched his initials and the date in the bed of wet cement at the level before the first stone was laid on top of it. Casey found 92 memorial stones (&quot;presented stones&quot;) already inlaid into the interior walls of the first phase of construction. Before construction continued he temporarily removed eight stones at the level so that the walls at that level could be sloped outward, producing thinner second-phase walls. He inserted those stones and most of the remaining memorial stones stored in the lapidarium into the interior walls during 1885–1889. The bottom third of the monument is a slightly lighter shade than the rest of the construction because the marble was obtained from different quarries.

The building of the monument proceeded quickly after Congress had provided sufficient funding. In four years, it was completed, with the 100-ounce (2.83 kg) aluminum apex/lightning-rod being put in place on December 6, 1884. The apex was the largest single piece of aluminum cast at the time, when aluminum commanded a price comparable to silver. Two years later, the Hall–Héroult process made aluminum easier to produce and the price of aluminum plummeted, though it should have provided a lustrous, non-rusting apex. The monument opened to the public on October 9, 1888.

===Dedication===
The Monument was dedicated on February 21, 1885. Over 800 people were present on the monument grounds to hear speeches during a frigid day by Ohio Senator John Sherman (1823–1900), the Rev. Henderson Suter, William Wilson Corcoran (of the Washington National Monument Society) read by Dr. James C. Welling because Corcoran was unable to attend, Freemason Myron M. Parker, Col. Thomas Lincoln Casey of the Army Corps of Engineers, and President Chester A. Arthur. President Arthur proclaimed: I do now ... in behalf of the people, receive this monument ... and declare it dedicated from this time forth to the immortal name and memory of George Washington.

After the speeches Lieutenant-General Philip Sheridan (1831–1888), Civil War Cavalry veteran and then General-in-Chief of the United States Army led a procession, which included the dignitaries and the crowd, past the Executive Mansion, now the White House, then via Pennsylvania Avenue to the east main entrance of the Capitol Building, where President Arthur (1829–1886, served 1881–1885) received passing troops. Then, in the House of Representatives Chamber at the Capitol, the president, his Cabinet, diplomats and others listened to Representative John Davis Long (1838–1915), (former Lieutenant Governor and Governor of Massachusetts and future Secretary of the Navy) read a speech written a few months earlier by Robert C. Winthrop (1809–1894), formerly the Speaker of the House of Representatives when the cornerstone was laid 37 years earlier in 1848, but now too ill to personally deliver his speech. A final speech was given by John W. Daniel (1842–1910), of Virginia, a well-regarded lawyer, author and Representative (congressman), and Senator. The festivities concluded that evening with fireworks, both aerial and ground displays.

===Later history===

At completion, it was the world&#x27;s tallest building, until the Eiffel Tower was completed four years later in Paris in 1889. It is still the tallest building in Washington, D.C. The Heights of Buildings Act of 1910 restricts new building heights to no more than greater than the width of the adjacent street. This monument is taller than the obelisks around the capitals of Europe and in Egypt and Ethiopia, but ordinary antique obelisks were quarried as a monolithic block of stone, and were therefore seldom taller than approximately .

The Washington Monument attracted enormous crowds before it officially opened. For six months after its dedication, 10,041 people climbed the 900 steps and 47 large landings to the top. After the elevator that had been used to raise building materials was altered to carry passengers, the number of visitors grew rapidly, and an average of 55,000 people per month were going to the top by 1888, only three years after its completion and dedication. The annual visitor count peaked at an average of 1.1 million people between 1979 and 1997. From 2005 to 2010, when restrictions were placed on the number of visitors allowed per day, the Washington Monument had an annual average of 631,000 visitors. As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service (an agency of the U.S. Department of the Interior), the national memorial was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.

In the early 1900s, material started oozing out between the outer stones of the first construction period below the mark, and was referred to by tourists as &quot;geological tuberculosis&quot;. This was caused by the weathering of the cement and rubble filler between the outer and inner walls. As the lower section of the monument was exposed to cold and hot and damp and dry weather conditions, the material dissolved and worked its way through the cracks between the stones of the outer wall, solidifying as it dripped down their outer surface.

For ten hours in December 1982, the Washington Monument and eight tourists were held hostage by a nuclear arms protester, Norman Mayer, claiming to have explosives in a van he drove to the monument&#x27;s base. United States Park Police shot and killed Mayer. The monument was undamaged in the incident, and it was discovered later that Mayer did not have explosives. After this incident, the surrounding grounds were modified in places to restrict the possible unauthorized approach of motor vehicles.

The monument underwent an extensive restoration project between the years of 1998 and 2001. During this time it was completely covered in scaffolding designed by the American architect Michael Graves (who was also responsible for the interior changes). The project included cleaning, repairing and repointing the monument&#x27;s exterior and interior stonework. The stone in publicly accessible interior spaces was encased in glass to prevent vandalism, while new windows with narrower frames were installed (to increase the viewing space). New exhibits celebrating the life of George Washington, and the monument&#x27;s place in history, were also added.

A temporary interactive visitor center, dubbed the &quot;Discovery Channel Center&quot; was also constructed during the project. The center provided a simulated ride to the top of the monument, and shared information with visitors during phases in which the monument was closed. The majority of the project&#x27;s phases were completed by summer 2000, allowing the monument to reopen July 31, 2000. The monument temporarily closed again on December 4, 2000, to allow a new elevator cab to be installed, completing the final phase of the restoration project. The new cab included glass windows, allowing visitors to see some of the 194 memorial stones with their inscriptions embedded in the monument&#x27;s walls. The installation of the cab took much longer than anticipated, and the monument did not reopen until February 22, 2002. The final cost of the restoration project was $10.5 million.

On September 7, 2004, the monument closed for a $15 million renovation, which included numerous security upgrades and redesign of the monument grounds by landscape architect Laurie Olin (b. 1938). The renovations were due partly to security concerns following the September 11, 2001 attacks and the start of the War on Terror. The monument reopened April 1, 2005, while the surrounding grounds remained closed until the landscape was finished later that summer.

====2011 earthquake damage====
On August 23, 2011, the Washington Monument sustained damage during the 5.8 magnitude 2011 Virginia earthquake; over 150 cracks were found in the monument. A National Park Service spokesperson reported that inspectors discovered a crack near the top of the structure, and announced that the monument would be closed indefinitely. A block in the pyramidion also was partially dislodged, and pieces of stone, stone chips, mortar, and paint chips came free of the monument and &quot;littered&quot; the interior stairs and observation deck. The Park Service said it was bringing in two structural engineering firms (Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc. and Tipping Mar Associates) with extensive experience in historic buildings and earthquake-damaged structures to assess the monument.

Officials said an examination of the monument&#x27;s exterior revealed a &quot;debris field&quot; of mortar and pieces of stone around the base of the monument, and several &quot;substantial&quot; pieces of stone had fallen inside the memorial. A crack in the central stone of the west face of the pyramidion was wide and long. Park Service inspectors also discovered that the elevator system had been damaged, and was operating only to the level, but was soon repaired.

On September 27, 2011, Denali National Park ranger Brandon Latham arrived to assist four climbers belonging to a &quot;difficult access&quot; team from Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates. The reason for the inspection was the park agency&#x27;s suspicion that there were more cracks on the monument&#x27;s upper section not visible from the inside. The agency said it filled the cracks that occurred on August 23. After Hurricane Irene hit the area on August 27, water was discovered inside the memorial, leading the Park Service to suspect there was more undiscovered damage. The rappellers used radios to report what they found to engineering experts on the ground. Wiss, Janney, Elstner climber Dave Megerle took three hours to set up the rappelling equipment and set up a barrier around the monument&#x27;s lightning rod system atop the pyramidion; it was the first time the hatch in the pyramidion had been open since 2000.

The external inspection of the monument was completed on October 5, 2011. In addition to the long west crack, the inspection found several corner cracks and surface spalls (pieces of stone broken loose) at or near the top of the monument, and more loss of joint mortar lower down the monument. The full report was issued in December 2011. Bob Vogel, Superintendent of the National Mall and Memorial Parks, emphasized that the monument was not in danger of collapse. &quot;It&#x27;s structurally sound and not going anywhere&quot;, he told the national media at a press conference on September 26, 2011.

More than $200,000 was spent between August 24 and September 26 inspecting the structure. The National Park Service said that it would soon begin sealing the exterior cracks on the monument to protect it from rain and snow.

On July 9, 2012, the National Park Service announced that the monument would be closed for repairs until 2014. The National Park Service hired construction management firm Hill International in conjunction with joint-venture partner Louis Berger Group to provide coordination between the designer, Wiss, Janney, and Elstner Associates, the general contractor Perini, and numerous stakeholders. NPS said a portion of the plaza at the base of the monument would be removed and scaffolding constructed around the exterior. In July 2013, lighting was added to the scaffolding. Some stone pieces saved during the 2011 inspection would be refastened to the monument, while &quot;Dutchman patches&quot; would be used in other places. Several of the stone lips that help hold the pyramidion&#x27;s exterior slabs in place were also damaged, so engineers installed stainless steel brackets to more securely fasten them to the monument.

The National Park Service reopened the Washington Monument to visitors on May 12, 2014, eight days ahead of schedule. Repairs to the monument cost $15 million, with taxpayers funding $7.5 million of the cost and David Rubenstein funding the other $7.5 million. At the reopening Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, &quot;Today&quot; show weatherman Al Roker, and &quot;American Idol&quot; Season 12 winner Candice Glover were present.

====Subsequent problems and repairs====
The monument continued to be plagued by problems after the earthquake, including in January 2017 when the lights illuminating it went out. The monument was closed again in September 2016 due to reliability issues with the elevator system. On December 2, 2016, the National Park Service announced that the monument would be closed until 2019 in order to modernize the elevator. The $2–3 million project was to correct the elevator&#x27;s ongoing mechanical, electrical and computer issues, which had shuttered the monument since August 17. The National Park Service requested funding in its FY 2017 President&#x27;s Budget Request to construct a permanent screening facility for the Washington Monument. The final months of closure were for mitigation of possibly contaminated underground soil thought to have been introduced in the 1880s. The monument reopened September 19, 2019.

====Repeated closures====
After reopening in September 2019, the Washington Monument was closed on March 14, 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It reopened on October 1, 2020, and remained open through the remainder of that year, except for brief closures. On January 11, 2021, a few days after the January 6 United States Capitol attack, the National Park Service announced a two-week closure of the monument until after the presidential inauguration due to &quot;credible threats to visitors and park resources&quot;. Following a lack of violence, the closure was extended due to a revival of COVID-19 fears. The monument then reopened on July 14, 2021, only to close yet again on August 16 for two weeks due to lightning strikes which damaged some electrical systems.

On September 20, 2022, the monument was closed for one evening because a man was defacing the monument with red paint and graffiti. He was arrested and charged with vandalism, to which he pleaded guilty, and later sentenced to a year of probation and ordered to pay restitution to the Park Service.

==Components==

===Cornerstone===
The cornerstone was laid with great ceremony at the northeast corner of the lowest course or step of the old foundation on . Robert Mills, the architect of the monument, stated in September 1848, &quot;The foundations are now brought up nearly to the surface of the ground; the second step being nearly completed, which covers up the corner stone.&quot; Therefore, the cornerstone was laid below the 1848 ground level. In 1880, the ground level was raised to the base of the shaft by the addition of a wide earthen embankment encircling the reinforced foundation, widened another 30 feet in 1881, and then the knoll was constructed in 1887–88. If the cornerstone had not been moved during the strengthening of the foundation in 1879–80, its upper surface would now be below the pavement just outside the northeast corner of the shaft. It would now be sandwiched between the concrete slab under the old foundation and the concrete buttress completely encircling what remains of the old foundation. During the strengthening process, about half by volume of the periphery of the lowest seven of eight courses or steps of the old foundation (gneiss rubble) was removed to provide good footing for the buttress. Although a few diagrams, pictures and descriptions of this process exist, the fate of the cornerstone is not mentioned. 

The cornerstone was a marble block high and square with a large hole for a zinc case filled with memorabilia. The hole was covered by a copper plate inscribed with the date of the Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776), the date the cornerstone was laid (July 4, 1848), and the names of the managers of the Washington National Monument Society. The memorabilia in the zinc case included items associated with the monument, the city of Washington, the national government, state governments, benevolent societies, and George Washington, plus miscellaneous publications, both governmental and commercial, a coin set, and a Bible, totaling 73 items or collections of items, as well as 71 newspapers containing articles relating to George Washington or the monument.

The ceremony began with a parade of dignitaries in carriages, marching troops, fire companies, and benevolent societies. A long oration was delivered by the Speaker of the House of Representatives Robert C. Winthrop. Then, the cornerstone was pronounced sound after a Masonic ceremony using George Washington&#x27;s Masonic gavel, apron and sash, as well as other Masonic symbols. In attendance were President James K. Polk and other federal, state and local government officials, Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, Mrs. Dolley Madison, Mrs. John Quincy Adams, and George Washington Parke Custis, among 15,000 to 20,000 others, including a bald eagle. The ceremony ended with fireworks that evening.

===Memorial stones===

States, cities, foreign countries, benevolent societies, other organizations, and individuals have contributed 194 memorial stones, all inserted into the east and west interior walls above stair landings or levels for easy viewing, except one on the south interior wall between stairs that is difficult to view. The sources disagree on the number of stones for two reasons: whether one or both &quot;height stones&quot; are included, and stones not yet on display at the time of a source&#x27;s publication cannot be included. The &quot;height stones&quot; refer to two stones that indicate height: during the first phase of construction a stone with an inscription that includes the phrase &quot;from the foundation to this height 100 feet&quot; () was installed just below the stairway and high above the stairway; during the second phase of construction a stone with a horizontal line and the phrase &quot;top of statue on Capitol&quot; was installed on the level.

The &quot;Historic Structure Report&quot; (HSR, 2004) named 194 &quot;memorial stones&quot; by level, including both height stones. Jacob (2005) described in detail and pictured 193 &quot;commemorative stones&quot;, including the stone but not the Capitol stone. The &quot;Historic American Buildings Survey&quot; (HABS, 1994) showed the location of 193 &quot;memorial stones&quot; but did not describe or name any. HABS showed both height stones but did not show one stone not yet installed in 1994. Olszewski (1971) named 190 &quot;memorial stones&quot; by level, including the Capitol stone but not the 100-foot stone. Olszewski did not include three stones not yet installed in 1971.

Of 194 stones, 94 are marble, 40 are granite, 29 are limestone, 8 are sandstone, with 23 miscellaneous types, including stones with two types of material and those whose materials are not identified. Unusual materials include native copper (Michigan), pipestone (Minnesota), petrified wood (Arizona), and jadeite (Alaska). The stones vary in size from about square (Carthage) to about (Philadelphia and New York City).

Utah contributed one stone as a territory and another as a state, both with inscriptions that include its pre-territorial name, Deseret, both located on the level.

A stone at the level of the monument is inscribed in (My Language, My Country, My Nation, Welsh forever). The stone, imported from Wales, was donated by Welsh citizens of New York. Two other stones were presented by the Sunday Schools of the Methodist Episcopal Church in New York and the Sabbath School children of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Philadelphia—the former quotes from the Bible verse Proverbs 10:7, &quot;The memory of the just is blessed&quot;.

Ottoman Sultan Abdul Mejid I donated $30,000 toward the construction of the Washington monument. The Sultans&#x27; donation was the largest single donation toward the building of the Washington Monument. The Sultan&#x27;s intention was to bridge peace between the Ottomans and the Americans. The stone containing the Turkish inscriptions commemorating this event is on the level. The abbreviated translation of the inscriptions states, &quot;So as to strengthen the friendship between the two countries. Abdul-Mejid Kahn has also had his name written on the monument to Washington.&quot; It combines the works of two eminent calligraphers: an imperial &quot;tughra&quot; by Mustafa Rakım&#x27;s student Haşim Efendi, and an inscription in &quot;jalī ta&#x27;līq&quot; script by Kazasker Mustafa Izzet Efendi, the calligrapher who wrote the giant medallions at Hagia Sophia in Istanbul.

One stone was donated by the Ryukyu Kingdom and brought back by Commodore Matthew C. Perry, but never arrived in Washington (it was replaced in 1989).
Many of the stones donated for the monument carried inscriptions that did not commemorate George Washington. For example, one from the Templars of Honor and Temperance stated &quot;We will not make, buy, sell, or use as a beverage, any spiritous or malt liquors, Wine, Cider, or any other Alcoholic Liquor.&quot; (George Washington himself had owned a whiskey distillery which operated at Mount Vernon after he left the presidency.)

===Aluminum apex===

The aluminum apex, composed of a metal that at the time was as rare and valuable as silver, was cast by William Frishmuth of Philadelphia. At the time of casting, it was the largest piece of aluminum in the world. Before the installation, it was put on public display at Tiffany&#x27;s in New York City and stepped over by visitors who could say they had &quot;stepped over the top of the Washington Monument&quot;. It was tall before was vaporized from its tip by lightning strikes during 1885–1934, when it was protected from further damage by tall lightning rods surrounding it. Its base is square. The angle between opposite sides at its tip is 34°48&#x27;. It weighed before lightning strikes removed a small amount of aluminum from its tip and sides. Spectral analysis in 1934 showed that it was composed of 97.87% aluminum with the rest impurities. It has a shallow depression in its base to match a slightly raised area atop the small upper surface of the marble capstone, which aligns the sides of the apex with those of the capstone, and the downward protruding lip around that area prevents water from entering the joint. It has a large hole in the center of its base to receive a threaded diameter copper rod which attaches it to the monument and used to form part of the lightning protection system. In 2015 the National Geodetic Survey reported the coordinates of the 1 mm dimple atop the aluminum apex as (WGS 84).

The four faces of the external aluminum apex all bear inscriptions in cursive writing (Snell Round hand), which are incised into the aluminum. The apex was inscribed on site after it was delivered. Most inscriptions are the original 1884 inscriptions, except for the top three lines on the east face which were added in 1934. From 1885 to 1934 a wide gold-plated copper band that held eight short lightning rods, two per side but not at its corners, covered most of the inscriptions, which were damaged and illegible as shown in the accompanying picture made in 1934. A new band including eight long lightning rods, one at each corner and one at the middle of each side, was added in 1934 and removed and discarded in 2013. The inscriptions that it covered were still damaged and illegible in 2013. Only the top four and bottom two lines of the north face, the first and last lines of the west face, the top four lines of the south face, and the top three lines of the east face are still legible. Even though the inscriptions are no longer covered, no attempt was made to repair them when the apex was accessible in 2013.

The following table shows legible inscriptions in and illegible inscriptions in . No colors appear on the actual apex. The inscriptions occupy the lower portions of triangles, thus the inscribed upper lines are necessarily shorter than some lower lines.

Although most printed sources, Harvey (1903), Olszewski (1971), Torres (1984), and the &quot;Historic Structure Report&quot; (2004), refer to the original 1884 inscriptions, the National Geodetic Survey (2015) refers to both the 1884 and 1934 inscriptions. All sources print them according to their own editorial rules, resulting in excessive capitalization (Harvey, Olszewski, and NGS) and inappropriate line breaks. No printed source uses cursive writing, although pictures of the apex clearly show that it was used for both the 1884 and 1934 inscriptions.

A replica displayed on the 490-foot level uses totally different line breaks from those on the external apex—it also omits the 1934 inscriptions. In October 2007, it was discovered that the display of this replica was positioned so that the Laus Deo (Latin for &quot;praise be to God&quot;) inscription could not be seen and Laus Deo was omitted from the placard describing the apex. The National Park Service rectified the omission by creating a new display.

===Lightning protection===

The pyramidion, the pointed top of the monument, was originally designed with an tall inscribed aluminum apex which served as a single lightning rod, installed . Six months later on lightning damaged the marble blocks of the pyramidion, so a net of gold-plated copper rods supporting 200 gold-plated, platinum-tipped copper points spaced every was installed over the entire pyramidion. The original net included a gold-plated copper band attached to the aluminum apex by four large set screws which supported eight closely spaced vertical points that did not protrude above the apex. In 1934 these eight short points were lengthened to extend them above the apex by . In 2013 this original system was removed and discarded. It was replaced by only two thick solid aluminum lightning rods protruding above the tip of the apex by about attached to the east and west sides of the marble capstone just below the apex.

Until it was removed, the original lightning protection system was connected to the tops of the four iron columns supporting the elevator with large copper rods. Even though the aluminum apex is still connected to the columns with large copper rods, it is no longer part of the lightning protection system because it is now disconnected from the present lightning rods which shield it. The two lightning rods present since 2013 are connected to the iron columns with two large braided aluminum cables leading down the surface of the pyramidion near its southeast and northwest corners. They enter the pyramidion at its base, where they are tied together (electrically shorted) via large braided aluminum cables encircling the pyramidion above its base. The bottom of the iron columns are connected to ground water below the monument via four large copper rods that pass through a square well half filled with sand in the center of the foundation. The effectiveness of the lightning protection system has not been affected by a significant draw down of the water table since 1884 because the soil&#x27;s water content remains roughly 20% both above and below the height of the water table.

===Walls===

During the first phase of construction (1848–1854), the walls were built with bluestone gneiss rubble, ranging from very large irregular stones having a cross section of about down to spalls (broken pieces of stone) all embedded in a large amount of mortar. The outer surface is marble stones thick in high courses or rows horizontally encircling the monument. Although each course contains both stretchers (stones parallel to the wall) and headers (stones projecting into the wall), about two to three times as many stretchers as headers were used. Their joints were so thin that some stones pressed on bare stone below them, breaking off many pieces since it was constructed. The batter or slope of the outer surface is 0.247 inches per foot (2.06 cm/m, 1°11&#x27;). The inner surface has disorderly rows of smaller roughly dressed bluestone gneiss. The base of the first phase walls has an outer dimension of square and a thickness of . The interior well is square and has square corners. The weight of the first phase walls up to is . 

During the second phase (1879–1884), the walls were constructed of smoothly dressed (ashlar) large marble and granite blocks (rectangular cuboids) laid down in an orderly manner (Flemish bond) with thick joints. Two-foot high marble surface stones, using an equal number of stretchers and headers, were backed by granite blocks from the 152-foot level (the first course above the rubble) to the 218-foot level, where marble headers become increasingly visible on the internal surface of the walls up to the 450-foot level, above which only marble stones are used.
Between the 150- and 160-foot levels the inner walls rapidly slope outward, increasing the shaft well from 25 feet 1 inch square to square with a corresponding decrease in the thickness of the walls and their weight. The second phase walls at the 160-foot level were thick, which, combined with the larger shaft well, yields an outer dimension of square at that level. The top of the second phase walls are square and thick. The second phase interior walls have rounded corners ( radii). The weight of the second phase walls (from 150 feet to 500 feet) are . The walls of the entire shaft (combined first and second phases) are high.

The first phase of the walls was constructed under the direction of William Dougherty. Its white Cockeysville marble exterior came from the Texas quarry now adjacent to and east of north I-83 near the Warren Road exit in Cockeysville, Maryland. The quarry was named for the Texas Station (no longer extant) and 19th-century town on the Northern Central Railway. During the first phase it was operated by Thomas Symington, but is now operated by Martin Marietta Materials and no longer produces building stone. The second phase of construction was under the direction of Lt Col/Col Thomas Lincoln Casey of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, who removed two defective courses added by the Know-Nothings and the last 152-foot course added by Dougherty before Casey began his construction. The next three courses of white marble () came from Sheffield, Massachusetts, while all courses above them came from the Beaver Dam quarry just west of the 19th-century town of Cockeysville. The latter quarry is located on Beaver Dam Road near its intersection with McCormick Road. During the second phase the quarry was operated by Hugh Sisson, but is now flooded, is called Beaverdam Pond, and is the home of the Beaver Dam Swimming Club. Both 19th-century towns are now within the city limits of Cockeysville.
===Pyramidion===

The marble capstone of the pyramidion is a truncated pyramid with a cubical keystone projecting from its base and a deep groove surrounding the keystone. The aluminum apex replaces its truncated top. The inside upper edges of the topmost slabs on the four faces of the pyramidion rest on the keystone and in the groove. It has a large vertical hole through which a threaded copper rod passes and screws into the base of the apex, which used to form part of its lightning protection system. The keystone and groove occupy so much of its base that only a small horizontal area near its outer edge remains. The weight of the capstone is transferred to both the inner and outer portions of the shiplap upper edges of the slabs. It weighs , is high from its base to its top, and is square at its base.

The marble pyramidion has an extremely complex construction to save weight yet remain strong. Its surface slabs or panels are usually only thick (with small thick and thin portions) and generally do not support the weight of slabs above them, instead transferring their own weight via wide internal marble ribs to the shaft&#x27;s walls. The slabs are generally wide and high with a vertical overlap (shiplap) to prevent water from entering the horizontal joints. Twelve such courses, the internal ribs, the marble capstone, and the aluminum apex comprise the pyramidion. Its height is . Its weight is . The slope of the walls of the pyramidion is 17°24&#x27; from the vertical. There are twelve ribs, three per wall, which spring from the level, all being integrated into the walls up to the level. All are free standing above 500 feet, relying on mortise and tenon joints to attach neighboring stones. The eight corner ribs terminate six courses above the shaft, each corner rib resting on its neighboring corner rib via a miter joint, forming four corner arches. Each such arch supports a pair of square corner stones, one above the other totaling one course in height. Each corner rib is linked to the nearest center rib at the sixth course via a marble tie beam. The four center ribs terminate eight courses above the shaft at a marble cruciform (cross shaped) keystone, forming two main arches that cross each other. Two stones, each one course high, are mounted on each of the four ribs, supporting two additional courses above the cruciform keystone, leaving two courses to support the capstone&#x27;s weight by themselves.

The observation floor (nominally the 500-foot level) is above the entry lobby floor or lowest landing level. It is above the marble base of the pyramidion and the top of the shaft walls.

Four pairs of wide observation windows are provided, spaced apart, inner stone edge to edge, all just above the lowest course of slabs (504-foot level). Six are high while two on the east face are high for easier egress. All were originally provided with thin marble shutters in a bronze frame each of which could be opened inward, one left and the other right per wall. After two people committed suicide by jumping through the open windows in the 1920s, hinged horizontal iron bars were added to them in 1929. A ninth opening in a slab on the south face just below the capstone is provided for access to the outside of the pyramidion. It is covered by a stone slab which is internally removable. In 1931, four red aircraft warning lights were installed, one per face in one of its observation windows. Pilots complained that they could not be easily seen, so the monument was floodlit on all sides as well. In 1958, eight diameter holes for new red aircraft warning lights were bored, one above each window near the top edge of the fourth course of slabs (516-foot level) in the pyramidion. In 1958 the observation windows were glazed with shatterproof glass. In 1974–1976, they were glazed with bulletproof glass and the shutters removed. New bulletproof glass was installed during 1997–2000.

The pyramidion has two inscriptions, neither of which is regarded as a memorial stone. One is the year &quot;1884&quot; on the underside of the cruciform keystone; the other is at the same level as that keystone on the north face of the west center rib containing the names and titles of the four highest ranked builders. Its inscription () is almost identical to the inscription on the south face of the aluminum apex except for &quot;U.S.&quot;, which is part of the phrase &quot;14th U.S. Infantry&quot; in the inscription inside the pyramidion, but the apex has only &quot;14th Infantry&quot;. Additionally, the internal inscription does not use cursive writing and all letters in all names are capitals.

===Foundation===

The first phase began with the excavation of about of topsoil down to a level of loam, consisting of equal parts of sand and clay, hard enough to require picks to break it up. On this &quot;bed of the foundation&quot; the cornerstone was laid at the northeast corner of the proposed foundation. The rest of the foundation was then constructed of bluestone gneiss rubble and spalls, with every crevice filled with lime mortar. The dimensions of this old foundation were high, square at the base, and square at the top, laid down in eight steps, similar to a truncated step pyramid. At the center of the foundation a brick-lined square well was dug to a depth of below the bed of the foundation to keep it dry and to supply water during construction.

During the second phase, after determining that the proposed weight of the monument was too great for the old foundation to safely bear, the thickness of the walls atop the unfinished stump was reduced and the foundation was strengthened by adding a large unreinforced concrete slab below the perimeter of the old foundation to increase the monument&#x27;s load bearing area two and one half times. The slab was thick, with an outer perimeter square, an inner perimeter square, with undisturbed loam inside the inner perimeter except for the water well. The area at the base of the second phase foundation is . The strengthened foundation (old foundation and concrete slab) has a total depth of below the bottom of the lowest course of marble blocks (now below ground), and below the entry lobby floor. Casey reported that nowhere did the load exceed and did not exceed near the outer perimeter. To properly distribute the load from the shaft to slab, about half by volume of the outer periphery of the old rubble foundation below its top step was removed. A continuous sloping unreinforced concrete buttress encircles what remains. The buttress is square at its base, square at its top, and high. The perimeter of the original top step of the old rubble foundation rests on the larger top of the concrete buttress. Its slope (lower external angle from the vertical) is 49°. This buttress rests in a depression (triangular cross-section) on the top surface of the concrete slab. The slab was constructed by digging pairs of wide drifts on opposite sides of the monument&#x27;s center line to keep the monument properly balanced. The drifts were filled with unreinforced concrete with depressions or dowel stones on their sides to interlock the sections. An earthen terrace wide with its top at the base of the walls and steep sides was constructed in 1880–81 over the reinforced foundation while the rest of the monument was being constructed. During 1887–88, a knoll was constructed around the terrace tapering out roughly onto the surrounding terrain. This earthen terrace and knoll serves as an additional buttress for the foundation. The weight of the foundation is , including earth and gneiss rubble above the concrete foundation that is within its outer perimeter.

===Stairs and elevator===

The monument is filled with ironwork, consisting of its stairs, elevator columns and associated tie beams, none of which supports the weight of the stonework. It was redesigned in 1958 to reduce congestion and improve the flow of visitors. Originally, visitors entered and exited the west side of the elevator on the observation floor, causing congestion. So the large landing at the 490-foot level was expanded to a full floor and the original spiral stair in the northeast corner between the levels was replaced by two spiral stairs in the northeast and southeast corners. Now visitors exit the elevator on the observation floor, then walk down either spiral stair before reboarding the elevator for their trip back down.

The main stairs spiral up the interior walls from the entry lobby floor to the elevator reboarding floor at the level. The elevator occupies the center of the shaft well from the entry lobby to the observation floor, with an elevator machine room (installed 1925–26) whose floor is above the observation floor and an elevator pit (excavated 1879) whose floor is below the entry lobby floor. The stairs and elevator are supported by four wrought iron columns each. The four supporting the stairs extend from the entry lobby floor to the observation floor and were set at the corners of a square. The four supporting the elevator extend from the floor of the elevator pit to above the observation floor and were set at the corners of a square. The weight of the ironwork is . Cast iron, wrought iron, and steel were all used. The two small spiral stairs installed in 1958 are aluminum.

Most landings occupy the entire east and west interior walls every from and including the east landing at the level up to the west landing at the level, east then west alternately. Three stairs with small landings rise from the entry lobby floor to the level successively along the north, west and south interior walls. Landings from the level up to the level are by , while landings from the level to the level are by . All stairs are on the north and south walls except for the aforementioned west stair between the levels, and the two spiral stairs.

About one fourth of visitors chose to ascend the monument using the stairs when they were available. They were closed to up traffic in 1971, and then closed to all traffic except by special arrangement in 1976. The stairs had 898 steps until 1958, consisting of 18 risers in each of the 49 main stairs plus 16 risers in the spiral stair. Since 1958 the stairs have had 897 risers if only one spiral stair is counted because both spiral stairs now have 15 risers each. These figures do not include two additional steps in the entry passage that were covered up in 1975 by a ramp and its inward horizontal extension to meet the higher (since 1886) entry lobby floor. One step was away from the outer walls and the other was at the end of the passage, away from the outer walls.

As initially constructed, the interior was relatively open with two-rail handrails, but a couple of suicides and an accidental fall prompted the addition of tall wire screening high with a large diamond mesh) on the inside edge of the stairs and landings in 1929. The original steam powered elevator, which took 10 to 12 minutes to ascend to the observation floor, was replaced by an electric elevator powered by an on-site dynamo in 1901 which took five minutes to ascend. The monument was connected to the electrical grid in 1923, allowing the installation of a modern electric elevator in 1925–26 which took 70 seconds. The latter was replaced in 1958 and again in 1998 by 70-second elevators. From 1997 to 2000, the wire screening at three platforms was replaced by large glass panels to allow visitors on the elevator to view three clusters of memorial stones that were synchronously lit as the elevator automatically slowed while passing them during its descent.
===Flags===

Fifty U.S. national flags, one representing each state, are now flown 24 hours a day around a large circle centered on the monument. Forty eight American flags (one for each state then in existence) were flown on wooden flag poles on Washington&#x27;s birthday since 1920 and later on Independence Day, Memorial Day, and other special occasions until early 1958. Both the flags and flag poles were removed and stored between these days. In 1958 fifty tall aluminum flag poles (anticipating Alaska and Hawaii) were installed, evenly spaced around a diameter circle. During 2004–05, the diameter of the circle was reduced to . Since Washington&#x27;s birthday 1958, 48 U.S. flags were flown on a daily basis, increasing to 49 flags on , and then to 50 flags since . When 48 and 49 flags were flown, only 48 and 49 flag poles of the available 50 were placed into base receptacles. All flags were removed and stored overnight. Since , 50 U.S. flags have flown 24 hours a day.

===Approximate vesica piscis===

During the 2004 grounds renovation, two partially overlapping large circles were added to the landscaping with the obelisk in their intersection. The lens shape formed by such an intersection is called vesica piscis when two same-radius circles overlap, with the center of each lying on the perimeter of the other, which is not the case on the monument grounds.

===Miscellaneous details===
The total cost of the monument from 1848 to 1888 was $1,409,500 (). The weight of the above ground portion of the monument is , whereas its total weight, including the foundation below ground and any earth above it that is within its outer perimeter is . The total number of blocks in the monument, including all marble, granite and gneiss blocks, whether externally or internally visible or hidden from view within the walls or old foundation is over 36,000. The number of marble blocks externally visible is about 10,000.

The monument stands tall according to the National Geodetic Survey (measured 2013–14) or tall according to the National Park Service (measured 1884). In 1975, a ramp covered two steps at the entrance to the monument, so the ground next to the ramp was raised to match its height, reducing the remaining height to the monument&#x27;s apex. It is both the world&#x27;s tallest predominantly stone structure and the world&#x27;s tallest obelisk. It is the tallest monumental column in the world if all are measured above their pedestrian entrances, but two are taller when measured above ground, though they are neither all stone nor true obelisks. The tallest masonry structure in the world is the brick Anaconda Smelter Stack in Montana at tall. But this includes a non-masonry concrete foundation, leaving the stack&#x27;s brick chimney at tall, only about taller than the monument&#x27;s 2015 height. If the monument&#x27;s aluminum apex is also discounted, then the stack&#x27;s masonry portion is taller than the monument&#x27;s masonry portion.

===Security===

In 2001, a temporary visitor security screening center was added to the east entrance of the Washington Monument in the wake of the September 11 attacks. The one-story facility was designed to reduce the ability of a terrorist attack on the interior of the monument, or an attempt to seize and hold it. Visitors obtained their timed-entry tickets from the Monument Lodge east of the memorial and passed through metal detectors and bomb-sniffing sensors prior to entering the monument. After exiting the monument, they passed through a turnstile to prevent them from re-entering. This facility, a one-story cube of wood around a metal frame, was intended to be temporary until a new screening facility could be designed.

On March 6, 2014, the National Capital Planning Commission approved a new visitor screening facility to replace the temporary one. The facility will be two stories high and contain space for screening 20 to 25 visitors at a time. The exterior walls (which will be slightly frosted to prevent viewing of the security screening process) will consist of an outer sheet of bulletproof glass or polycarbonate, a metal mesh insert, and another sheet of bulletproof glass. The inner sheet will consist of two sheets (slightly separated) of laminated glass. A airspace will exist between the inner and outer glass walls to help insulate the facility. Two (possibly three) geothermal heat pumps will be built on the north side of the monument to provide heating and cooling of the facility. The new facility will also provide an office for National Park Service and United States Park Police staff. The structure is designed so that it may be removed without damaging the monument. The United States Commission of Fine Arts approved the aesthetic design of the screening facility in June 2013.

A recessed trench wall known as a ha-ha has been built to minimize the visual impact of a security barrier surrounding the monument. After the September 11 attacks and another unrelated terror threat at the monument, authorities had put up a circle of temporary Jersey barriers to prevent large motor vehicles from approaching. The unsightly barrier was replaced by a less-obtrusive low granite stone wall that doubles as a seating bench and also incorporates lighting. Designed by the famed landscape architect Laurie Olin, the installation received the 2005 Park/Landscape Award of Merit from the American Society of Landscape Architects.

<text>mpg123 is a free and open-source audio player. It supports MPEG audio formats, including MP3.

As a console application, it has no graphical user interface.

mpg123&#x27;s Assembly code is optimized with SIMD instructions to improve the performance of the iDCT part of the MPEG decoding.

mpg123&#x27;s decoding library, codice_1 is used by DeaDBeeF, Audacious, XMMS and Winamp (version 5.8) for MP3 playback and can be used in Winamp before version 5.8 via a plugin.

== History ==
The license for the last release (0.59r / 19 June 1999) from the original authors included restrictive (non-commercial, no-derivative) terms, although the source code was available. This led to the creation of mpg321, a similar program (based on MAD) licensed under the GPLv2. 

Official development of mpg123 and its library codice_2 stalled, and serious security holes emerged. Patches were applied downstream for packages provided by various Linux and BSD operating systems.

In 2006, a new maintainer started work towards the release of a new official mpg123 package. After several security rollup releases in the 0.6.x series, version 1.0 was released in 2007 under the LGPLv2.1, with codice_1 as a replacement for codice_2.

<doc id="167595" wikidata="Q193146" url="?curid=167595" title="Anthony Perkins">
<text>Anthony Perkins (April 4, 1932 – September 12, 1992) was an American actor. Born in Manhattan, Perkins began his career as a teenager in summer stock programs, although he acted in films before his time on Broadway. His first film, &quot;The Actress&quot;, co-starring Spencer Tracy and Jean Simmons and directed by George Cukor, was an overall disappointment, prompting Perkins to return to theatre. He made his Broadway debut in the Elia Kazan-directed &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot; (1953)&quot;,&quot; in which he played Tom Lee, a &quot;sissy&quot; who is &quot;cured&quot; by the right woman. He was praised for the role, and after it closed, he turned to Hollywood once more, starring in &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; (1956) with Gary Cooper and Dorothy McGuire, which earned him the Golden Globe Award for Best New Actor of the Year and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The film led to Perkins&#x27;s seven-year, semi-exclusive contract with Paramount Pictures, where he was their last matinee idol.

In 1957, Perkins went on to appear in &quot;Fear Strikes Out&quot;. Paramount was keen to heterosexualize Perkins&#x27;s image, leading to a string of romantic roles alongside Audrey Hepburn, Sophia Loren, and Shirley MacLaine. He was able to land an occasional serious role, such as in the Broadway production &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot;, for which he was nominated for a Tony Award, and the 1959 film &quot;On the Beach&quot; with Gregory Peck, Fred Astaire, and Ava Gardner. Although he was cast once again as a romantic lead in Jane Fonda&#x27;s film debut, &quot;Tall Story&quot;, he was shortly thereafter cast as Norman Bates in &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960), which established him as a horror icon and earned him a Bambi Award nomination for Best Actor, as well as being nominated for and winning the International Board of Motion Picture Reviewers Award for Best Actor. Because his work with Hitchcock led to his being typecast, Perkins bought himself out of his contract with Paramount and moved to France, where he made his European film debut with &quot;Goodbye Again&quot; (1961). The film earned him a Best Actor Bravo Otto nomination and his second career Bambi Award nomination. He won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor and a David di Donatello Award for Best Actor for the role.

After appearing in European films featuring Sophia Loren, Orson Welles, Melina Mercouri, and Brigitte Bardot, Perkins returned to the U.S. in 1968, with a role in &quot;Pretty Poison&quot;, co-starring Tuesday Weld, his first American film in eight years. In the film&#x27;s wake, he starred in commercially and critically successful films including &quot;Catch-22&quot; (1970)--a performance which garnered him a National Society of Film Critics Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, an honor shared with his co-starring turn in &quot;WUSA&quot;, also released in 1970, and opposite Paul Newman--1972&#x27;s &quot;Play It as It Lays&quot; and &quot;The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean&quot; (opposite Newman once again), &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1974), and &quot;Mahogany&quot; (1975).

In the 1970s, Perkins decided to undergo conversion therapy. He married Berry Berenson in 1973. He reprised his role as Norman Bates in &quot;Psycho II&quot; (1983), &quot;Psycho III&quot; (1986), and &quot;Psycho IV: The Beginning&quot; (1990). The third installment in the anthology earned him a Best Actor Saturn Award nomination. His last film was &quot;In the Deep Woods&quot;, a television film broadcast a month after his death in September 1992 from AIDS-related causes.
==Early life==
===Early life, 1932–1937===
Anthony Perkins was born April 4, 1932, in Manhattan, the son of actor Osgood Perkins (1892–1937) and his wife, Janet Esselstyn (née Rane; 1894–1979). His paternal great-grandfather was the wood engraver Andrew Varick Stout Anthony. Perkins was also a descendant of &quot;Mayflower&quot; passengers John Howland, Myles Standish and William Brewster, as well as colonist Roger Conant. Through an entirely paternal line, he was descended from John Perkins, who had arrived in Boston from England in 1630 as part of the Puritan migration to New England.

Throughout his early years, Perkins did not see much of his father, who was busy in a variety of roles, the most prominent of which was his supporting role in the original motion picture adaptation of &quot;Scarface&quot;, released the year Perkins was born. Perkins&#x27;s only fond memories of his father came from a 1937 vacation to Fire Island, though they spent little time together on the trip. The Perkins family hired a French nanny, Jeanne, to look after their son, leading to Perkins&#x27; fluency in French, which proved useful years later.

Between his father&#x27;s absences, Perkins was surrounded by women, the most influential of which was his mother. &quot;I became abnormally close to my mother,&quot; Perkins recalled to &quot;People&quot; in 1983, &quot;and whenever my father came home I was jealous. It was the Oedipal thing in a pronounced form, I loved him but I also wanted him to be dead so I could have her all to myself.&quot; On September 21, 1937, Osgood Perkins died of a heart attack, just after the successful opening night of his newest play, &quot;Susan and God&quot;. His father&#x27;s death caused Perkins to feel intense guilt. &quot;I was horrified,&quot; he said years later. &quot;I assumed that my wanting him to be dead had actually killed him. I prayed and prayed for my father to come back. I remember long nights of crying in bed. For years I nursed the hope that he wasn&#x27;t really dead. Because I&#x27;d see him on film, it was as if he were still alive. He became a mythic being to me, to be dreaded and appeased.&quot;

===After his father&#x27;s death, 1937–1947===
After his father&#x27;s death, Perkins was once again surrounded entirely by women. A consistent female companion in Perkins&#x27;s life was burgeoning playwright Michaela O&#x27;Harra, whom his mother had taken a liking to. Perkins&#x27;s childhood friend, John Kerr, recalled the relationship between O&#x27;Harra and Perkins&#x27;s mother: &quot;My mother said–I don&#x27;t know if she used the word lesbian... but that was just [what it felt like] to me: &#x27;Oh, they&#x27;re having a lesbian relationship.&#x27; You know, something like that.&quot; Although her sexuality has been disputed, it is widely agreed that Perkins&#x27;s mother was not heterosexual. It was also during that time that Perkins&#x27;s mother began to sexually abuse him. &quot;She was constantly touching me and caressing me. Not realizing what effect she was having, she would touch me all over, even stroking the inside of my thighs right up to my crotch.&quot; The behavior continued into his adulthood.

In 1942, when Perkins was ten, the family moved to Boston. Due to her connections in the theatre industry, his mother was able to gain a position at the nearby American Theatre Wing&#x27;s Boston Stage Door Canteen. She managed much of the canteen&#x27;s activities, and the job gave the pair money to live on. On days when she was busy, Perkins was sent to stay with his grandmother. Due to his mother&#x27;s neglect, Perkins began to rebel at the overcrowded public school he was attending, and was labelled a &quot;gifted drifter&quot;. To quell his rebellious habits, his mother shipped him to Brooks School, forty minutes outside of Boston. The placement was disastrous: Perkins&#x27;s childhood habit of stuttering returned, and he shied away from any athletic pursuits. His mother, however, forced him into playing baseball. It was the first time in his life that Perkins was singled out, and the resulting pressure led to long absences from school during his second year after suffering back-to-back cases of scarlet fever. Subsequently, Perkins sank to the bottom of his class. He soon made a deal with his mother that if he got good grades, she would allow him to return to Boston the next year for schooling. That year, Perkins ranked in the top third of his class. His headmaster commented: &quot;Tony Perkins is considerably more mature than the rest of his contemporaries, and is impatient with many of their schoolboy interests.&quot; Perkins was allowed to transfer.

===Summer stock, 1947–1950===
As he matured, Perkins&#x27;s lack of a father began to weigh on him. &quot;As Tony grew older and saw other boys with their fathers,&quot; his mother remembered, &quot;he badly missed his own father. And the only identification he could have with his father was through theater... I began to realize that he was acquiring an unusual interest in [performing]... A friend was running a summer stock company, and I approached him to ask whether Tony might play some small parts&quot;, launching Perkins&#x27;s adolescent summer stock career. At Perkins&#x27;s first summer stock company, Brattleboro Summer Theater in Vermont, he played some minor parts in &quot;Junior Miss&quot;, &quot;Kiss and Tell&quot;, and &quot;George Washington Slept Here&quot;, and ran the box office, where he earned $25 a week and an Equity card.

Keeping her word, the following year, his mother sent him to Buckingham Browne &amp; Nichols School, an all-boys school located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Smaller class sizes caused Perkins to stand out, earning him a reputation as the class magician and pianist. He was renowned for his lisping Roddy McDowall impression, which he often performed in the halls between classes.

In 1948, Perkins returned to summer stock with a different company. His mother had found a job as a manager for the Robin Hood Theatre in Arden, Delaware, where Perkins once again ran the box office and earned stage experience. His most memorable performance was in &quot;Sarah Simple&quot;, in which he played a near-sighted twin. It was here that Perkins met Charles Williamson, the first boy he ever developed a crush on. The following year, Perkins joined the varsity tennis team and the glee club at his school, and was made co-literary editor of the school newspaper, &quot;The Spectator&quot;, to which he contributed occasional articles. Around this time, once again singled out as &quot;the other&quot;, Perkins began to question his sexuality.

===College, 1950–1953===
Around the time Perkins&#x27;s sexuality began to burgeon, many of his fellow students were thinking about college. Many Browne &amp; Nicholas alumni were looking forward to a future at Harvard University, and Perkins, whose grades were too low to qualify, was the only student persuaded to attend Rollins College in Florida, after a representative toured the school. However, that did not keep him from returning to Delaware that summer, where he once again worked at the Robin Hood which had become one of the most prosperous and important summer stock programs in the country. It was there that he grew reacquainted with old friend Charles Williamson, going out to lunch and swimming with him during breaks. It was at that time that Perkins developed a crush on Williamson, who recalled: &quot;He never expressed his homosexuality during the summer of 1950. He did not act on it at all. At the time, I was very much in the closet and repressed. We both shared that.&quot; It was also around that time that Perkins played Fred Whitmarsh in &quot;Years Ago&quot;, a role that he performed again just a few years later in the screen adaptation.

Perkins did not experience similar camaraderie at Rollins College that fall. Rollins College was nestled in the heart of Florida, and Perkins had arrived just after Congress had named homosexuals and Communists as being enemies of equal danger. There were a few exceptions: Fred Rogers, who graduated from the college the following year, let Perkins use his piano, something he greatly appreciated. Perkins appeared in numerous stage productions at the school and moved around fraternities constantly, something that got on the nerves of his mother. It was at Rollins that Perkins reportedly first started experimenting with his sexuality with other men.

Shortly after Perkins&#x27;s arrival, a large group of homosexual students, many of whom were Perkins&#x27;s friends, were expelled from Rollins and even arrested, after a fellow student had beaten one of them. However, due to Perkins&#x27;s connections with the theater professor, he was spared. That only led to high levels of tension between him and the rest of the student body, who knew of Perkins&#x27;s sexuality. As a result, Perkins transferred to the elite Columbia University.

==Career==

=== 1950s ===

==== Film and Broadway debut ====
While still attending Rollins College, Perkins went to California over summer vacation, hoping to make it into the movies. Having heard that MGM was making a screen adaptation of &quot;Years Ago&quot;, he lingered on the lot, hoping a casting director would spot him and offer him a screen test. As Perkins later recalled:
&quot;I hung around the casting gate all summer, running errands and picking up sandwiches for the guards. One day they were testing Margaret O&#x27;Brien and they needed the back of someone&#x27;s head. They didn&#x27;t know who to use. Then someone piped up and said, &#x27;How about that kid that&#x27;s always hanging around here? We could use the back of &quot;his&quot; head!&quot;

&quot;They called me in and I stood right in front of the camera, almost obliterating poor Margaret O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s face and causing a director to say &#x27;Please move a little to the left.&#x27; When he said this, I turned around and said, &#x27;Who, &quot;me&quot;?&#x27; and I was in the test.&quot;

It was later that summer that Perkins learned he had been cast as Fred Whitmarsh in the film, now renamed &quot;The Actress&quot; (1953), alongside Jean Simmons and Spencer Tracy. He was also directed by George Cukor, who was a friend and collaborator of his late father. In the film, he played a fumbling Harvard student who chases the interest of Ruth Gordon Jones (Simmons), who wants to perform onstage despite her family&#x27;s disapproval. The film was a commercial disappointment, although it scored an Academy Award nomination for Best Costume Design.

Perkins was first noticed when he replaced John Kerr on Broadway in the lead of &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot; in 1954, where he was directed by the legendary Elia Kazan, who had been a friend of his father&#x27;s. In the play, he took on the role of Tom Lee, a college student who is labelled as a &quot;sissy&quot; and fixed with the love of the right woman, in an almost autobiographical role. Perkins said years later, &quot;It was the best part ever written for a young guy. I felt so involved with that particular play. In many ways, I &quot;was&quot; Tom Lee.&quot; Although homophobically written and resolved, the play was the only explicit work to hit Broadway depicting homosexuality and garnered a large gay following, therefore establishing Perkins in the gay-dominated theater world. It was through this audience that the production became a success, and many people thought Perkins was substantially better than his predecessor, John Kerr, who went on to play the role in the film adaptation. Joan Fickett, who played Perkins&#x27;s love interest in the play, commented, &quot;He was that boy. I&#x27;d seen John Kerr do it before, but Tony had a quality that was fantastic for the part–-all the rawness and the hurt and the confusion, he just had. I found his performance tremendously poignant.&quot; The play&#x27;s success and Perkins&#x27;s astounding performance renewed Hollywood&#x27;s interest in him.

According to posthumous biographer Charles Winecoff, it was during the production of &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot; that Perkins was drafted, despite the recent conclusion of the Korean War. Without consulting anybody, he decided to tell the Selective Service he was a &quot;practicing homosexual,&quot; which was an eligible way to be deemed unfit for service. Reportedly, this had disastrous results, leaving Perkins traumatized.

====Serious roles====
Just as his run in &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot; was coming to an end, director William Wyler sent out his assistant, Stuart Millar, to search out talent on Broadway for his upcoming film &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot;. It centered around a family of Quakers during the American Civil War, and he was scouting an actor to play the oldest of the Birdwell children, Josh. When Millar saw Perkins in &quot;Sympathy&quot;, he gave him a page of script and let him do an audition. As Millar recalled: &quot;About half an hour later, [Perkins] had the part. [William Wyler] was thrilled with the reading, he saw everything instantly. It was really one of the best, if not &quot;the&quot; best, readings I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot;

Perkins was soon after shipped out to Hollywood, where he began shooting alongside Dorothy McGuire and Gary Cooper, his screen mother and father. Perkins, a native New Yorker, did not know how to drive yet and regularly hitchhiked out from his hotel room at the Chateau Marmont to the set each day, something that became infamous and was often talked about in fan magazines. His boyfriend, Tab Hunter, later taught him how to drive. Perkins&#x27;s inexperience radiated almost childish naïveté, something that endeared him to Gary Cooper. &quot;Coop was warm and gracious and kindly,&quot; Peter Mark Richman, who worked on the film, said. &quot;He liked [Perkins and me] a lot, and Tony loved to hear him talk.&quot; The feeling was mutual between Perkins, Cooper, and even the director. Perkins was regularly praised by Wyler for his performance and Cooper began publicly endorsing Perkins&#x27;s abilities. This led to Perkins and Cooper sharing the cover of the July 1956 issue of &quot;Life&quot;. In the issue, Cooper spoke about Perkins in a fatherly manner: &quot;I think he&#x27;d do well to spend a summer on a ranch,&quot; he commented about his younger costar. &quot;It would toughen him up and he&#x27;d learn a lot from another kind of people.&quot; Cooper&#x27;s daughter, Maria Cooper Janis, asserted that, although her father certainly admired Perkins, it could have also been for other reasons: &quot;He had friends in Hollywood, in the acting community, who were gay, and they couldn&#x27;t come out. He saw what an emotional toll it took on them. I know my father adored Tony Perkins. My father felt he was a hell of an actor.&quot;

Whatever the reason, this did not alter Perkins&#x27;s performance. After rushes of the film were shared, the advance praise of his performance became so strong that Paramount Pictures took an interest in him. They soon signed him under a seven-year semi-exclusive contract, which gave him room to return to Broadway whenever he wanted. He was their last matinee idol and was called the &quot;fifteen million dollar gamble.&quot;

Perkins&#x27;s first film for the studio was a 1957 biopic about Boston Red Sox baseball player Jimmy Piersall titled &quot;Fear Strikes Out&quot;. It followed his father&#x27;s pressure to become a legendary baseball player and how it led to his highly publicized mental breakdown, as well as detailing his efforts to get better in a mental institution. The set of the film was hostile and riddled with homophobia, something that put Perkins on edge so much that the cast and crew feared he was actually having a mental breakdown while filming the scene. Although he wasn&#x27;t nominated for any Oscars, his performance was widely praised by critics. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; proclaimed of the film: &quot;Every recent young star has been compared to James Dean. From now on the standard is Tony Perkins.&quot;

After this critical success, Perkins starred in the first of two Westerns, &quot;The Lonely Man&quot; (1957), with Jack Palance. Perkins played Riley Wade, whose father, Jacob (Palance), abruptly returns to his life after having abandoned his mother years before. Jacob battles Riley&#x27;s hatred for him throughout the film, desperate to reconnect with his estranged son after years of separation. Kim Stanley, a previous costar of Perkins&#x27;s, was cast as his love interest but was replaced at the last minute by Elaine Aiken in her film debut. Reportedly, the film set was riddled with tensions, most of which arose from Palance&#x27;s ultra-masculinity and Perkins&#x27;s lack thereof. This was only heightened when filming was put behind schedule by an abrupt weather crisis that prevented outdoor production for a number of days. Still, a feeling of vitality remained. &quot;We all thought this was an important picture we were making.&quot;

Perkins&#x27;s next film was also a Western, this time named &quot;The Tin Star&quot; (1957) with Henry Fonda. Originally, despite his burgeoning popularity, Perkins was not wanted for the project: &quot;The producers, Bill Perlberg and George Seaton, told someone who told someone who told someone who told me that they wouldn&#x27;t have me in their picture for a million dollars,&quot; Perkins admitted during filming. However, he auditioned for them as soon as he heard the news. In the film, Perkins played yet another pacifist, this time a sheriff named Ben Owens. After encountering an experienced bounty hunter, Morgan Hickman (Fonda), Ben has to prove himself worthy of his title in an ironic reflection of Perkins&#x27;s troubles with Paramount. Perkins and Fonda took the hours-long drive out to set together in the same car, during which they became closely acquainted and shared stories of their private lives. Some cast members speculate that Perkins confided in Fonda about his sexuality during these drives. The film grossed over $1 million in the box office and was one of the biggest films of 1957. It is now considered a classic of the Western genre.

&quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; opened globally to huge critical and commercial success. The film was largely praised by critics, who took a liking to Perkins. The film earned him the Golden Globe Award for Best New Actor of the Year and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. In a 1958 cover story, &quot;Newsweek&quot; hailed Perkins as &quot;possibly the most gifted dramatic actor in this country under 30.&quot;

====Teen idol status====
Perkins released three pop music albums and several singles in 1957 and 1958 on Epic and RCA Victor under the name Tony Perkins. His single &quot;Moon-Light Swim&quot; was a moderate hit in the United States, peaking at number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1957. 1958&#x27;s &quot;The Prettiest Girl in School&quot; was also popular in Australia but a flop in the United States. Many people believed he was inspired to pursue musical endeavors after the abrupt success of then-partner Tab Hunter, who had scored a number one hit on his debut record, &quot;Young Love.&quot; To Hunter, Perkins was often heard joking &quot;that his tremulous voice could make any happy love song sound sad.&quot; However, Perkins was not very committed to the music career, although he steadily produced full-length albums and a few EP&#x27;s until as late as the mid-1960s.

Despite being a life member of the Actors Studio and therefore open to many different acting business ventures, Perkins did not choose to act in a musical when he exerted the freedom of his studio contract in 1957, and returned to Broadway in &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot;. The play was an autobiographical, coming-of-age story about its writer, Thomas Wolfe, and he took on the role of Eugene Gant, with his mother being played by Jo Van Fleet. The play enjoyed a successful run, and in 1958, he was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play, although the rehearsals were tumultuous. Van Fleet developed a reputation for her standoffish behavior and temper tantrums, leading to contention on the set. This was not made better by the fact that Tab Hunter, among others, came to see the show during tryouts. This manifested in a restrained performance from Perkins, something Hunter picked up on:
Backstage, Tony asked what I thought of his performance, and I told him straight: &quot;You&#x27;re afraid to give vent to what you&#x27;re truly feeling,&quot; I said. &quot;You&#x27;re only showing the side of yourself you want other people to see.&quot;... When I saw &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot; the second time, in late January, Tony had stripped away all preconceived ideas and was mesmerizing.

Not all was bad on set, though. Perkins, who had a dressing room far from the stage, often had to race between scenes to retrieve something so as not to miss his cue, something his costars used in practical jokes. Many times, they turned the backstage area into an obstacle course, seeing if Perkins could get back to the curtain in time. Reportedly, he never missed his entrances. On the day of his final performance, they went through with the prank as planned, watching Perkins leap over objects and dodge barriers. Once he made it through, he was greeted with a sign that said &quot;We love you, Tony!&quot;

Perkins was teamed up again with Van Fleet in &quot;This Angry Age&quot; (1958), also known as &quot;The Sea Wall&quot;, for Columbia, replacing James Dean. (Van Fleet had played Dean&#x27;s mother in &quot;East of Eden&quot;, something many people believed influenced casting.) The story followed a mother who, unlike her restless children, attempts to cling to her dissipating rice farm in southeast Asia. He also starred in &quot;Desire Under the Elms&quot; (1958) for Paramount with Sophia Loren and was her first American screen kiss. As Loren remembered in her 2014 memoir, &quot;Perkins [was] as neurotic and handsome as we all remember him in [a later film] &quot;Psycho&quot;. A gentle, polite, somewhat sullen young man, he didn&#x27;t know how to hide his restlessness. Between us there was a certain complicity. He helped me with my English, and I tried to make him laugh.&quot; Although Loren was proud to have scored the role, the unanimous decision upon its release was that Perkins&#x27;s performance was not strong.

Between the filming of &quot;Desire&quot; and his next movie, Perkins received an offer to appear in what became the 1959 comedy &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; with Marilyn Monroe. He was given the role of Shell Oil Junior and Frank Sinatra was considered for the role of his companion who both dress up in drag to board an all-women train car. Paramount, despite the appeal of a big star like Monroe, balked at the idea of having their already sexually-ambiguous heartthrob wear drag for an entire film and forbade Perkins from accepting the role. It ultimately went to Tony Curtis instead. However, studio executives begged Perkins to return from Broadway to star in &quot;The Matchmaker&quot; (1958) alongside Shirley MacLaine and Shirley Booth, during which he and a male companion dress up in women&#x27;s clothing to escape a restaurant undetected. As if to ensure he would not turn the project down, Perkins was given a salary of $75,000 for 10 weeks&#x27; work while MacLaine only got $25,000 for the same number of days. Although Perkins protested MacLaine&#x27;s smaller salary, no changes were made in her payment.

&quot;The Matchmaker&quot; was a non-musical film adaptation (later turned into the hit Broadway musical &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;) of Thornton Wilder&#x27;s stage play, in which Dolly Gallagher Levi (Booth) attempts to set up rich businessman Horace Vandergelder (Paul Ford) with a younger woman, Irene Malloy (MacLaine). Vandergelder&#x27;s employees, Cornelius Hackl (Perkins) and Barnaby Tucker (Robert Morse), tired of their poor wages and constant work, escape to New York City and meet Irene, who&#x27;s led to believe Cornelius is rich. Cornelius slowly falls in love with Irene while deceiving her. Morse had been a part of the original Broadway cast of the show, and he bonded with Perkins over the shared background. (Perkins later disclosed that Morse was bisexual, implying that they became confidants of sorts.) Perkins, however, disliked MacLaine intensely despite defending her from studio bosses, and was put on edge by her intense drive and numerous pranks. &quot;I&#x27;ve never been allowed that precious moment of seeing what Tony Perkins really is,&quot; MacLaine later reported. &quot;I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s an act and what isn&#x27;t an act.&quot;

Paramount decided to take Perkins&#x27;s status as a teen idol one step further and cast him as Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s love interest in &quot;Green Mansions&quot; (1959), one of Hepburn&#x27;s few flops. It was based on an explorer who stumbles upon both a girl who lives in the woods and the Native Americans nearby who want to kill her. The film was originally intended to be a vehicle for Elizabeth Taylor when the project was initially announced in 1953, but these plans were soon abandoned. In 1958, Mel Ferrer picked the film up for MGM, and Hepburn (his wife) was cast as the mystical Rima to secure funding. Perkins, who was still stinging after losing the role in &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;, was cast soon after. It was the only film in which Ferrer directed his wife.

Perhaps still remembering the &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; incident, Paramount used the film to promote Perkins&#x27;s masculinity, showing him shirtless and fighting apparently stronger men. He did receive a reprieve to sing &quot;Green Mansions,&quot; the title song of the film, which briefly entered the charts before almost immediately falling off. Speaking about the movie later in life, Perkins said, &quot;[Hepburn] was wonderful to work with, like a real person, almost a sister... [The film] was good but unusual.&quot;

Perkins&#x27;s next film, &quot;On the Beach&quot; (1959), however, did little to promote his teen idol status, and was his last serious film before his legendary &quot;Psycho&quot; performance later that year. He played a doomed father living in Australia after a nuclear war wipes humanity off all other continents. He supported legendary actors such as Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, and Fred Astaire in his first dramatic role. All filming took place on location in Melbourne over the course of three months, and a soundstage was made out of a warehouse for the crew&#x27;s use. Unlike other films, Perkins got on well with his fellow cast members and even helped Astaire prepare for his serious scenes. Years later, in an infamous interview with &quot;People&quot;, Perkins listed Gardner as the first of many female stars who tried to put the make on him, but due to his sexuality, he very cautiously declined.

Perkins&#x27;s next roles were less serious. &quot;Tall Story&quot; (1960) was best remembered for being Jane Fonda&#x27;s film debut, and he had to play a college basketball champion. As a man who had never been talented in sports, he had to be trained to play basketball for his performance, but, unlike his lessons on the set of &quot;Fear Strikes Out&quot;, these ones stuck. Perkins recounted to reporters: &quot;I&#x27;ve been working out at the Warner Brothers gym, discovering what basketball is all about. I spend about an hour and a half a day dribbling, passing, shooting baskets, and going after rebounds... It&#x27;s a good game. Like chess in a way.&quot; Also unlike &quot;Fear Strikes Out&quot;, the set of &quot;Tall Story&quot; was hospitable to him from what he could see. Because Perkins had worked with her father, he and Fonda had a connection, but not many could foresee the chemistry they would have both on- and off-screen. As Fonda later recounted to Patricia Bosworth: &quot;Tony [Perkins] told me &#x27;Forget about the lights, just forget about the lights.&#x27; And I did. And he taught me fascinating things, like the audience&#x27;s eyes always move to the right side of the screen so you should always try to get on the right side of the set.&quot; Fonda also solely credits Perkins for helping her learn how to play before the camera when acting.

In a repeat of &quot;On the Beach&quot;, Fonda developed a crush on Perkins, who later recalled an occasion when she sat in his dressing room, completely naked, powdering her body. Unlike others, Fonda was actually understanding of his homosexuality and became good friends with whoever he was seeing at the time. Behind the scenes, however, there was more turmoil: Fonda recalled &quot;Both Joshua Logan [the film&#x27;s director] and I were in love with Tony Perkins, and so that caused a problem.&quot;

=== 1960s ===

==== Troubles with Paramount ====
After being signed in 1955, Perkins became Paramount&#x27;s last matinee idol, and he was promoted relentlessly as that image through a string of leading roles on screen. Once he had finished three films for the studio, they had already invested $15 million in him before any of the motion pictures were even released. This began the infamous tension between Perkins and Paramount.

Another reason for tension came from Perkins&#x27;s side; he believed Paramount was ruining his career. Although he was given the option to do Broadway performances, his fame primarily stemmed from his performances on screen, where Paramount was pushing him into leading-man roles. Perkins, however, wanted only to be a serious actor, not a teen idol. Their preoccupation with keeping Perkins&#x27;s masculinity intact also led to his losing quite a few coveted roles, such as Shell Oil Junior in &quot;Some Like it Hot&quot; and Tony in &quot;West Side Story&quot;.

Paramount president Barney Balaban strongly disliked Perkins due to his homosexuality. They constantly had arguments, mostly revolving around his sexuality and his ongoing relationship with fellow actor Tab Hunter, which Balaban believed Perkins flaunted too much. He constantly pressured Perkins into breaking up with Hunter and going into conversion therapy for the five years that Perkins was under contract with the studio. A later collaborator of Perkins&#x27;s remembered to Charles Winecoff in 1996, &quot;Tony said one thing that always endeared him to me... that when he was a rising young star at Paramount, he was seeing a great deal of [Tab Hunter], they went around town together, and finally the big studio head called him in and said, &#x27;You cannot do this anymore. We&#x27;re going to make you a star, and you can&#x27;t be seen around town with this guy. You&#x27;ve got to get a girl, you&#x27;ve got to stop seeing him.&#x27; Tony replied, &#x27;But I love him!&#x27;—which left the studio head speechless—and walked out&quot;. Hunter remembered a similar scenario: &quot;Warner Brothers never said a word about my sexuality, and that&#x27;s just the way I wanted it. However, Paramount did have something to say about my relationship with Tony, and they told him they didn&#x27;t want him to see me anymore... Despite the opposition we did continue seeing each other.&quot;

According to all accounts, Perkins, until 1959, withstood Balaban&#x27;s threats of expulsion and even protected his homosexuality from his studio boss. It was not until between filming &quot;Tall Story&quot; and &quot;Psycho&quot; that the studio executives succeeded in separating Perkins and Hunter, which many believe was a major factor in Perkins buying himself out of his Paramount contract early, just as Hunter had done at Warner Brothers.

==== &quot;Psycho&quot; and &quot;Greenwillow&quot; ====
Perkins in youth had a boyish, earnest quality, reminiscent of the young James Stewart, which Alfred Hitchcock exploited and subverted when the actor starred as Norman Bates in the film &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960). Hitchcock later said that he&#x27;d had Perkins cast since seeing him in &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot;. The motion picture was about Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a young woman who steals $40,000 from her employer and flees by car, stopping by chance at a motel run by Norman Bates [Perkins], where she is murdered in her room&#x27;s shower, seemingly by Norman&#x27;s mother. The film culminates with the revelation that Bates&#x27;s mother has been dead for ten years and that Bates has been dressing up and even assuming her personality. This leads him to murder all young girls he&#x27;s attracted to, including Marion, under the &quot;Mother&quot; personality.
During filming, Perkins was also involved in the 1960 Broadway musical &quot;Greenwillow&quot;, written by Frank Loesser. The show is about the magical town of Greenwillow, where the men are meant to wander and women (if they can keep their husbands) are supposed to settle down and have children. Despite his call to isolation, Gideon Briggs (Perkins) wants to marry his sweetheart, Dorie (Ellen McCown). Loesser caught on to Perkins&#x27;s homosexuality fast and, disliking him for it, decided to upstage him, writing his main solo, &quot;Never Will I Marry&quot;, as something reminiscent of an opera ballad. However, close friend Stephen Sondheim praised his performance of &quot;Never Will I Marry&quot;: &quot;[Perkins was] wonderful. One of the things that makes &#x27;Never Will I Marry&#x27; so brilliant [on the recording] is the crack of his voice when he reaches the tenth.&quot; The show&#x27;s director, George Roy Hill, also called Perkins &quot;remarkably good. It didn&#x27;t have the timbre of a real Broadway voice, but it didn&#x27;t have the hard edge. &#x27;Never Will I Marry&#x27; was a wonderful example of that.&quot; Additionally, the song was popularized due to its renditions by Judy Garland, Barbra Streisand, and Linda Ronstadt. Perkins was also nominated for another Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical.

&quot;Psycho&quot; was made on a slim budget, with Perkins and Leigh accepting low salaries for their roles and recycling the crew from &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. The film was nonetheless a critical and commercial success, and gained Perkins international fame as he won the Best Actor Award from the International Board of Motion Picture Reviewers. The role, with its multiple sequels, was to follow him for the remainder of his career.

==== European films ====
After buying himself out of his Paramount contract, Perkins moved to France and began making European films, the first of which was &quot;Goodbye Again&quot; (1961) with Ingrid Bergman, shot in Paris. Paula Tessier (Bergman) tries to resist the charms of Philip Van der Besh (Perkins), who is the son of one of her clients, while stuck in an unfulfilling affair with a cheating businessman (Yves Montand). It was originally entitled &quot;Time on Her Hands&quot;, although Perkins suggested the English title &quot;Goodbye Again&quot; after one of his father&#x27;s plays. Again, Perkins found himself subjected to the romantic attention of his female costar, although he customarily declined. Despite any off-screen tension this might have caused, Perkins&#x27;s role in the film was greatly praised and earned him the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor.

Perkins returned briefly to America to appear in a short-lived Broadway play, &quot;Harold&quot; (1962), but he returned to Europe shortly thereafter. He was then cast in &quot;Phaedra&quot; (1962), shot in Greece with Melina Mercouri and directed by Jules Dassin, undoubtedly inspired by Mercouri&#x27;s recent success in &quot;Never on Sunday&quot;. It was a modern retelling of a Greek tragedy where Alexis (Perkins) falls in love with Phaedra (Mercouri), who is also his stepmother. When asked about Perkins, Mercouri fondly said, &quot;Ah, Tony. He is attractive to women. He is dangerous to women. When you touch him, he goes away a little. He is an [eel]. Raf Vallone [who played Perkins&#x27;s father and Mercouri&#x27;s husband in the film] is a good-looking man, but Perkins... Ah, I&#x27;d pick Perkins any time.&quot; Perkins&#x27;s role in the film was also met with praise.

His next film was &quot;Five Miles to Midnight&quot; (1962), which was his second motion picture with Sophia Loren. It follows Lisa (Loren), who believes her husband Robert (Perkins) died in a plane crash. When he reveals he is still alive, he urges her to collect the life-insurance money from his death. The film was a major shift away from the romantic leads he&#x27;d played in &quot;Goodbye Again&quot; and &quot;Phaedra&quot; and leant more toward his &quot;Psycho&quot; persona. Filming began under the title &quot;All the Gold in the World&quot;, and Perkins reportedly only signed onto the picture after hearing Loren had replaced the previously cast Jeanne Moreau as his coerced wife. The production process was captured on video for the documentary &quot;The World of Sophia Loren&quot;, where she and Perkins can be seen laughing between takes, practicing scenes, solving puzzles, and singing the popular &quot;After I&#x27;m Gone&quot;. (Tab Hunter had covered the song in 1958.) The film was a moderate success.
Perkins continued with his mentally disturbed performances in Orson Welles&#x27; version of &quot;The Trial&quot; (1962), based on the Kafka novel about Joseph K, a man who&#x27;s arrested and attempts to figure out what his crime is and how to defend himself. Perkins did not mind the typecasting as long as he was able to work with Welles, who personally wanted him to play the lead. To discuss the possibility of Perkins taking on the role, the two met on the stairs of Welles&#x27;s hotel. Perkins said &quot;[Welles] paid me the great compliment of saying he would like to know whether I would make the picture because if I wasn&#x27;t going to make it, he wasn&#x27;t going to make it either.&quot; It is likely Welles was trying to make his runaway hit like &quot;Psycho&quot;, but even if that was the purpose, Perkins did not seem to mind. &quot;He&#x27;s the best there is,&quot; Perkins said of Welles. &quot;He&#x27;s wonderfully sure of himself and his ability without being dictatorial and autocratic about it... [H]e isn&#x27;t inflexible.&quot; The film quickly went over-budget, although this did little to alter Perkins&#x27;s vision of his director. In fact, during the process of filming, his admiration for Welles only seemed to increase. During filming, he considered writing a book about Welles and his career, even going as far as to carry a tape recorder in his coat pocket for weeks, but he abandoned it in fear of offending his boss. Welles later said to Perkins, &quot;Oh, why didn&#x27;t you [do it]? Why didn&#x27;t you? I would have loved it!&quot;

Besides Perkins&#x27;s abandoned plan to write a book about Welles, there was genuine affection between the two. Later in life, Welles remembered Perkins fondly: &quot;A strange thing happened with [&quot;The Trial&quot;]: it got wonderful press, all over the world, even in America. Even in &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; and everything, wonderful press. And Perkins got very bad press, all over the world, and the entire blame for that is mine, because he is a superlative actor and he played the character that I saw as K, and paid the price because nobody else sees it my way... I recognize that I did Tony–who is one of the best actors we have–a great disservice, because he deserved to have made a tremendous success and if he didn&#x27;t with the critics the blame is one hundred percent with me.&quot; Despite any regrets Welles might have had with his portrayal of Perkins and his character, the film was a massive success and later became a cult classic. Welles stated immediately after completing the film: &quot;&quot;The Trial&quot; is the best film I have ever made&quot;. It was the first of four collaborations between Perkins and Welles.

His final disturbed role in another romantic motion picture was in &quot;Le glaive et la balance&quot; (1963), shot in France. It had a very insignificant impact. His next film, however, was &quot;Une ravissante idiote&quot; (1964) with Brigitte Bardot, which was a comedy. It followed a Russian spy (Perkins) who employs a gorgeous but dim-witted woman (Bardot) as his accomplice in procuring secret documents. Perkins made history as the first American actor to play B.B.&#x27;s love interest, although Perkins later openly admitted Bardot was his least favorite costar, calling her &quot;Bardot-do-do.&quot; Bardot was another woman on Perkins&#x27;s roster of suitors, but Perkins always denied Bardot&#x27;s invitations to her penthouse. Perkins was incredibly uncomfortable around Bardot, which was drastically different from his behavior around his previous (older) costars.

After &quot;Une ravissante idiote&quot; , Perkins shot &quot;The Fool Killer&quot; (1965) in Mexico. An art film, the movie followed a 12-year-old boy (Edward Albert) who wanders the Civil War-ravaged South with a philosophical axe murderer (Perkins), and was Perkins&#x27;s second film about the American Civil War. The film was well received but not overly popular at the box office, and Perkins returned to France for a cameo in &quot;Is Paris Burning?&quot; (1966), a war film about the liberation of Paris in 1944 at the hands of the French Resistance. This was his second Welles collaboration and reunited him with director René Clément, who had had the same occupation over Perkins in 1957&#x27;s &quot;This Angry Age&quot;. In addition, Perkins&#x27;s friend, Gore Vidal, wrote the script.

==== Return to the United States ====
Although he was still living in France at the time, in 1966, Sondheim began writing a horror musical &quot;Evening Primrose&quot;, which was set to be aired on &quot;ABC Stage 67&quot;, for Perkins. Perkins returned to America to star in the musical alongside Charmian Carr, who was fresh off her success in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. The plot followed Charles Snell, a struggling poet who decides to live in a department store by night and pretend to be a mannequin by day. He encounters a secret society, the Dark Men, that already had the idea, and falls in love with Ella Hawkins (Carr), who is the maid of the society&#x27;s leader and is forbidden from speaking to Snell. If they attempt to leave the department store, the Dark Men will kill them and turn them into mannequins. Sondheim referred to it as one of his favorite musicals he ever wrote, and announced Perkins as the lead of &quot;Company &quot; shortly thereafter. Perkins, however, withdrew from the role, but he remained something like a muse for Sondheim for quite a few years.

After his return to American television, Perkins appeared on Broadway in the Neil Simon play &quot;The Star-Spangled Girl&quot; (1966–67). For a brief moment, he was able to once again shed his typecast role as a mentally disturbed man, instead playing a radical roommate vying for the attention of a young woman. Among his costars was Connie Stevens, and although they were both offered compliments for the performances they salvaged from the source material, the play was not on the whole well received. Neil Simon later commented that &quot;The Star-Spangled Girl&quot; &quot;was written &#x27;from an emotional identity rather than personal identity... I knew this one didn&#x27;t have the body of the others. I knew it never had a chance to be a powerful comedy... I didn&#x27;t make it&#x27;&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Perkins returned to his beloved Europe and he starred in another French film, &quot;The Champagne Murders&quot; (1967), for Claude Chabrol. The film was well-received, with the &quot;New York Times&quot; writing &quot;Mr. Chabrol... has made a film that has the shape and structure of a murder mystery, but which is, essentially, a funny, sardonic social drama.&quot; Despite this, it was insignificant at the box office.

In 1968 Perkins made his first Hollywood movie since &quot;Psycho&quot;, &quot;Pretty Poison&quot; with Tuesday Weld, in which he was typecast - for a fifth time - in the role of a psychotic young man. The plot revolves around Dennis Pitt (Perkins), on parole from a psychiatric hospital who meets Sue Ann Stepenek (Weld). He tells her he is a secret agent, after which they go on &quot;missions&quot; together, culminating in an attack on a factory. This was the first of two films with Weld, whom he had dated in the early 60s; they were reportedly chilly but respectful to each other on set. Although the film wasn&#x27;t a box office success, with Weld labeling it as her worst, it has since become a notable cult favorite.

===1970s===

==== Shift to supporting roles ====
In the 1970s, Perkins moved into supporting roles in Hollywood-feature films. The first of such motion pictures was 1970&#x27;s &quot;Catch-22&quot;, playing Chaplain Tappman. This was followed by a brief appearance in &quot;WUSA&quot; (1970), starring Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward. Off-Broadway, he appeared in and directed &quot;Steambath&quot; (1970).

After that, Perkins shifted his focus away from movies briefly to star on the made-for-television film &quot;How Awful About Allan&quot; (1970), where he once again played a psychotic character, this time opposite the gifted and acclaimed leading ladies Julie Harris and Joan Hackett. Although the film was hardly a significant work at the time of its release, it eventually gained a minor cult following over the years, thanks in large part to its ubiquity as a result of its entering into the public domain, making it more and more available and accessible for future audiences. He returned to motion pictures soon after, assisting Charles Bronson in the French crime drama &quot;Someone Behind the Door&quot; (1971), playing yet another mentally disturbed man. This was also an insignificant endeavor.
It seemed that Perkins could not escape his murderous image on screen, especially after he starred in Chabrol&#x27;s murder mystery &quot;Ten Days&#x27; Wonder&quot; (1971), his third film with Orson Welles. It was also the third film where he fell in love with his step-mother (after 1958&#x27;s &quot;Desire Under the Elms&quot; and 1962&#x27;s &quot;Phaedra&quot;). Perkins was reunited with another one of his older costars when he supported Tuesday Weld in &quot;Play It as It Lays&quot; (1972), based on the Joan Didion novel. It follows Maria (Weld), a washed-up model who pursues a meaning in life beyond her dull marriage. She is friends with B.Z. (Perkins), a closeted producer who is being paid by his mother to also remain in a loveless marriage. For both stars, their roles were almost autobiographical, resulting in stunning performances. The &quot;Chicago-Sun Times&quot; praised, &quot;What makes the movie work so well on this difficult ground is, happily, easy to say: It has been well-written and directed, and Tuesday Weld and Anthony Perkins are perfectly cast as Maria and her friend B.Z. The material is so thin (and has to be) that the actors have to bring the human texture along with them. They do, and they make us care about characters who have given up caring for themselves.&quot; Weld received a Golden Globe for her role, and both actors were expected to be nominated for Academy Awards. Neither were. However, Perkins publicly labelled the film as being his best performance.

Perkins changed genres for his next film, &quot;The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean&quot; (1972). He played a wandering minister who assists the title character (Paul Newman), following him as he causes mayhem in the town. This was his second film with Newman and his only film with ex-partner Tab Hunter, whom Hunter later recalled he bumped into at the Tucson location:
&quot;We hadn&#x27;t seen each other in nearly ten years... What I didn&#x27;t know at the time of our brief union was that Tony&#x27;s long-running battle with his personal demons had reached a breaking point. He was ending a long relationship with dancer Grover Dale and had started therapy with Mildred Newman... Newman convinced Tony that his personal problems stemmed in large measure from him being gay, and she prescribed a course of action–including electroshock therapy–to turn him straight.&quot;

According to Perkins, he had his first heterosexual experience on the set of the film with costar Victoria Principal.

==== Sondheim-Perkins collaborations and unconventional roles ====

In 1973, Perkins reunited with close friend Stephen Sondheim to co-write&quot;The Last of Sheila&quot;, a 1973 American mystery film directed by Herbert Ross. It was based on the games Perkins and Sondheim made up together and revolved around a movie producer who tries to discover who murdered his unfaithful wife by taking his rich friends on a maze through exotic locations, each with a piece of gossip applying to one of the other people aboard a yacht. The characters were influenced by people Perkins and Sondheim knew in real life: The film was a commercial success, and led to Perkins and Sondheim sharing the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Motion Picture Screenplay, which led them to try to collaborate again two more times. The next project was announced in 1975, titled &quot;The Chorus Girl Murder Case&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s a sort of stew based on all those Bob Hope wartime comedies, plus a little &quot;Lady of Burlesque&quot; and a little Orson Welles magic show, all cooked into a &quot;Last of Sheila&quot;-type plot&quot;, said Perkins. He later said other inspirations were &quot;They Got Me Covered&quot;, &quot;The Ipcress File&quot; and &quot;Cloak and Dagger&quot;. They had sold the synopsis in October 1974. At one point, Michael Bennett was to direct, with Tommy Tune to star. In November 1979, Sondheim said they had finished it. However, the film was never made. In the 1980s, Perkins and Sondheim collaborated on another project, the seven-part &quot;Crime and Variations&quot; for Motown Productions. In October 1984 they had submitted a treatment to Motown. It was a 75-page treatment set in the New York socialite world about a crime puzzle. Another writer was to write the script. It, too, was never made.

Perkins was one of the many stars featured in &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1974), adapted from a popular Agatha Christie novel. He played the suspicious McQueen, and was reunited with previous costars Ingrid Bergman (1961&#x27;s &quot;Goodbye Again&quot;) and Martin Balsam (1960&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot;), as well as being teamed up with legendary actors such as Lauren Bacall. The picture was a massive box office smash, the 10th-highest-grossing film of that year, a hit with critics, and was nominated for six Academy Awards, including a third (and final) career win for co-star Bergman. Also in 1974, Perkins co-starred with Beau Bridges and Blythe Danner in &quot;Lovin&#x27; Molly&quot;, a drama film directed by Sidney Lumet. It had a budget of over $1.2 million and was relatively well received.

He enjoyed success on Broadway in Peter Shaffer&#x27;s 1974 play &quot;Equus&quot; (where he was a replacement in the leading role originally played by Anthony Hopkins). In the show, he played a psychiatrist who attempts to rid his patient of their unnatural obsession with horses, shedding his stereotypical performance as a mentally disturbed man. His role was received to rave reviews, perhaps some of the best of his Broadway career. He continued with his stage work and directed the Off-Broadway production &quot;The Wager&quot; (1974), which had an insignificant impact.

Perkins returned to film supporting Diana Ross in &quot;Mahogany&quot; (1975), where he played a photographer bent on making a young model (Ross) into a star. Perkins and Ross were good friends on set, to the point where Perkins&#x27;s wife joked about their running off together, but this did not result in any strain from production. Perkins&#x27;s photographer character, Sean, was rewritten shortly before filming began to capitalize on his &quot;Psycho&quot; persona. This was made worse by the fact that the once explicitly gay character was now simply queer-coded , as well as being written in a homophobic way. It was because of this and other factors that Perkins thought the film was mediocre, but it did well at the box office, setting attendance records shortly after its release.

Continuing in the vein of comedy appearances, Perkins hosted television&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in its first season in 1976. On the show, he poked fun at his serious image, crying out for his &quot;good-luck panties.&quot; He briefly addressed the audience during his opening monologue, thanking them for seeing &quot;the real Tony Perkins,&quot; before launching into a skit about Norman Bates&#x27;s School for Motel Management, reprising his infamous role from &quot;Psycho&quot;. He also played a singing psychiatrist (perhaps influenced by &quot;Equus&quot;, something also mentioned in his opening monologue) and a victim in numerous pretend horror films. Towards the end of the program, Perkins posed and chatted with The Muppets.

Two years after his &quot;SNL&quot; appearance, Perkins co-starred with Geraldine Chaplin in &quot;Remember My Name&quot; (1978). Perkins plays the husband of his real-life wife, Berry Berenson. Perkins&#x27;s character is besieged by his ex-spouse (Chaplin) who has just been released from prison and is bent on getting him back. Director-writer Alan Rudolph described it as &quot;an update of the classic woman&#x27;s melodramas of the Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Crawford era.&quot; The motion picture was surprisingly popular and well-received, with the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; giving the film 4 out of 5 stars. They also praised both Perkins&#x27;s and Chaplin&#x27;s performances as &quot;extraordinary.&quot;

After &quot;Remember My Name&quot;, Perkins had more roles on television, playing Mary Tyler Moore&#x27;s husband in &quot;First, You Cry&quot; (1978), a biographical drama film based on the 1976 autobiography of NBC News correspondent Betty Rollin recounting her battle with breast cancer. The film was nominated for numerous awards, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Made for Television and numerous Primetime Emmys. In 1979, it was parodied on an episode of &quot;SNL&quot; with a sketch titled &quot;First He Cries.&quot; It follows a husband (Bill Murray) who&#x27;s distraught over his wife&#x27;s (Gilda Radner) mastectomy. The sketch was poorly received, resulting in over 200 calls and 300 letters of complaint.

After the modest success of &quot;First, You Cry&quot;, Perkins continued on his television streak when he played Javert in &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1978) based on Victor Hugo&#x27;s 2,000-page novel about the June Rebellion, opposite Richard Jordan as Jean Valjean. He projected a more kid-friendly light when he was featured in Walt Disney&#x27;s mammoth science fiction epic &quot;The Black Hole&quot; in 1979, where he reunited with crew members from &quot;Fear Strikes Out&quot;, whom he hadn&#x27;t seen in twenty-two years. The film also developed a large cult status with sci-fi fans, and was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Cinematography, as well as a nod for its complex and groundbreaking visual effects.

Shortly thereafter, Perkins returned to the boards in 1979 in another Broadway success with the play &quot;Romantic Comedy&quot; by Bernard Slade, the author of &quot;Same Time, Next Year&quot;. He played playwright Jason Carmichael who meets Phoebe Craddock (Mia Farrow) and falls in love with her, and they decide to work together on a production. The show was a wild success and ran for 396 performances. The &quot;New York Post&quot; wrote: &quot;A darling of a play... zesty entertainment of cool wit and warm sentiment.&quot;

=== 1980s ===
Perkins played a slick, unrelentingly-psychotic villain in the 1980 action film &quot;North Sea Hijack&quot; (also known as &quot;Assault Force,&quot; better known as &quot;ffolkes&quot;) co-starring Roger Moore. He was one of the many names appearing in the all-star cast of &quot;Winter Kills&quot; (1980), a dark comedy about geo-politics and presidential assassinations. The film starred the likes of Jeff Bridges, John Huston, Richard Boone, Eli Wallach, Dorothy Malone, Toshiro Mifune, Belinda Bauer and Elizabeth Taylor; he played John Cerruti, the purported puppetmaster behind a Kennedy-esque family and political dynasty, headed by John Huston. Perkins&#x27;s real-life wife, Berry Berenson, played a bit part as a morgue attendant. The film was a box-office bomb, losing more than $4 million. Like so many other Perkins films, this picture has also earned a cult following.

After &quot;Winter Kills&quot; he also starred in the 1980 Canadian film &quot;Deadly Companion&quot; (also known as &quot;Double Negative&quot;) opposite Michael Sarrazin, Susan Clark, Kate Reid, and in a very small role, a soon-to-be famous comic actor John Candy, with whom Perkins got on well on-set. It was largely disregarded by the public and even more so by critics. The attention it did receive was bleak, save for some kind remarks for Perkins. &quot;Spies and Sleuths&quot; called the movie &quot;a muddle film that cannot untie its tangled skein of a plot, although a Perkins performance is always worth watching.&quot; Another nice review for Perkins came from &quot;Starburst&quot;: &quot;This convoluted thriller is not without its merits (not least some clever dialogue and well observed performances by, among others, Anthony Perkins.)&quot;
Perkins reprised the role of Norman Bates in &quot;Psycho&quot;″s three sequels. The first, &quot;Psycho II&quot; (1983), was a large box office success 23 years after the original film, competing with films of the likes of &quot;Trading Places&quot; and &quot;WarGames&quot;, as well as a string of other screen sequels, including &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, &quot;Superman III&quot; and &quot;Jaws 3-D&quot;. &quot;Psycho II&quot; followed Norman Bates&#x27;s life after being released from a mental institution he resided in for more than two decades.

Later that same year, former partner Tab Hunter met Perkins at his Mulholland Drive home, accompanied by the latter&#x27;s wife and children, asking him to star in &quot;Lust in the Dust&quot;. &quot;Lust&quot; was a Western spoof of &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot;, and Hunter&#x27;s love interest was played by drag performer Divine, with whom he had already caused a stir in John Waters&#x27;s &quot;Polyester&quot;. Hunter&#x27;s partner and future husband, Allan Glaser, who was a producer on the film, requested that Perkins play the villain, Hardcase Williams, something Hunter believed was influenced by the sudden success of &quot;Psycho II&quot;. Glaser knew nothing of Hunter&#x27;s past with Perkins. &quot;I tried to convince him to [do the film],&quot; Hunter remembered, &quot;...but he refused. I choose not to think about the reasons for his turning down what would have been a wonderful role. When Tony and I said good-bye that afternoon, I was sincerely happy for him... It would be the last time we ever saw each other.&quot;

After turning down &quot;Lust&quot;, Perkins went to Australia to appear in the TV mini-series &quot;For the Term of his Natural Life&quot; in 1983. The show was produced in three parts, with an overall runtime of 6 hours, following an educated, adventurous British aristocrat Richard Devine. The show was well received by critics, becoming the eleventh highest rated Australian mini series on Sydney television between 1978 and 2000, with a rating of 37, and the third highest on Melbourne television with a rating of 45. After that was &quot;The Glory Boys&quot; (1984) for British television, a thriller mini-series with Rod Steiger. There was an intense dislike between Perkins and Steiger after the latter received a larger trailer, and Steiger labeled Perkins as &quot;so jittery and jinxed by the chemicals he was taking.&quot;

Following his feud with Rod Steiger on the set of &quot;Glory&quot;, Perkins found a more hospitable movie set when he made &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot; (1984) for Ken Russell. The film centered around a minister who attempts to rid a sultry woman of her sexual ways, but the movie was so explicit that it retained an X-rating for its first cut. The motion picture was majorly edited and received an R-rating instead. Although Perkins believed the editing ruined the film, it has become a cult favorite. He then starred in and directed &quot;Psycho III&quot; (1986), in which Norman Bates falls in love with a tragic wayward nun who comes to the Bates Motel. Perkins&#x27;s performance in this entry of the &quot;Psycho&quot; series earned him a Saturn Award nomination for Best Actor. The film, however, proved to be less successful (both critically and commercially) than its predecessors. This led to bouts of diminished self-confidence, but it did not mark the end of his directorial career.

After the disappointment of &quot;Psycho III&quot;, Perkins returned to television and had a supporting role in &quot;Napoleon and Josephine: A Love Story&quot; (1987), based on Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s romance with Joséphine de Beauharnais, where Perkins played diplomat Talleyrand. The show was poorly received, but was nominated for two Emmys.

Perkins drastically changed genres for his next project, the slasher film &quot;Destroyer&quot; (1988), where he again had a supporting role. Perkins was praised for his role, but the overall film was deemed a disappointment. Perkins disappeared briefly from the screen, directing but not appearing in the comedy &quot;Lucky Stiff&quot; (1988), which was a humorous take on cannibalism and incest. While a box office failure, the film developed a cult following due to its quotable dialogue and exposure in &quot;Fangoria&quot;, who did a feature on the film.

=== 1990s ===
Following his directorial pursuit, Perkins starred in additional horror films, including &quot;Edge of Sanity&quot; (1989), &quot;Daughter of Darkness&quot; (1990), and &quot;I&#x27;m Dangerous Tonight&quot; (1990). He found a reprieve while filming the pilot for the light-hearted show &quot;The Ghost Writer&quot; about a horror novelist named Anthony Strack (Perkins) who is haunted by his deceased wife after he remarries. The pilot ended with Perkins finishing the manuscript of his next novel, which was based on a supernatural encounter he had with the ghost of his wife. The pilot never sold. He gave in to typecasting and played Norman Bates again in the made-for-cable film &quot;Psycho IV: The Beginning&quot; (1990). It was on the set of this film that Perkins learned he was HIV-positive.

Perkins appeared in six television productions from 1990 to 1992 while privately battling with AIDS, including &quot;Daughter of Darkness&quot; (1990) and hosting a 12-episode horror anthology series titled &quot;Chillers&quot; (1990). He made his final appearance in &quot;In the Deep Woods&quot; (1992) with Rosanna Arquette, which was released posthumously. All of these appearances tied back to horror, further solidifying the typecast role he had fallen into.

=== Missed roles ===
* Perkins was offered the lead role in &quot;Dancing in the Checkered Shade&quot;, a John Van Druten play. &quot;I had little money and was practically set for &quot;Dancing in the Checkered Shade&quot;,&quot; Perkins recalled in 1956. &quot;My agents were split in their decisions. New York said I should stay and do the play. Hollywood said I should come out and do [&quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot;]. It was like flipping a coin. So I took the picture.&quot; &quot;Dancing&quot; never made it to Broadway, while &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; earned Perkins an Academy Award nomination and Hollywood stardom.

* Perkins tried out for the lead in &quot;East of Eden&quot; and &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;, both of which went to James Dean. There were rumors that Perkins&#x27;s &quot;East of Eden&quot; loss led Elia Kazan, the film&#x27;s director, to give Perkins the role of Tom Lee in &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot;, the Broadway play he was directing, but Kazan dismissed those notions as &quot;bullshit.&quot; (Perkins, however, was chosen over Dean for &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; and replaced him after his death in &quot;This Angry Age&quot;.)
* Perkins was optioned as the lead in Harold Robbins&#x27;s &quot;A Stone for Danny Fisher&quot;, but he was not interested in the film and turned it down. It later was known as &quot;King Creole&quot;, a musical vehicle for popular teen idol and pop singer Elvis Presley, whom Perkins was sometimes mistaken for.
* Perkins was offered the role of Shell Oil Jr. in the 1959 comedy &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; with Marilyn Monroe, which Monroe was reportedly excited about. Perkins, however, was forced to decline the opportunity by Paramount Studios executives, who did not want Perkins, who was already sexually ambiguous, in drag for a film.
* Perkins, just as he was signed onto the commercially, critically, and culturally significant &quot;Psycho&quot;, was encouraged to take the title role in a 20th-Century Fox biographical film, &quot;Dooley&quot;, who just happened to be gay. &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot;″s Robert Anderson wrote the script, and &quot;Greenwillow&quot;″s George Roy Hill and &quot;Tall Story&quot;″s Joshua Logan had expressed an interest in directing the film. Jack Lemmon and Montgomery Clift were also strong contenders for the main role. Perkins, however, was not allowed to audition after Paramount balked at the production cost.
* Perkins was seriously considered for the role of Tony in the 1961 adaptation of &quot;West Side Story&quot;, although Paramount forced Perkins to rescind his audition as well. This instead planted the seeds of Perkins&#x27;s lifelong friendship with &quot;West Side Story&quot;″s lyricist, Stephen Sondheim.
* Perkins was the first choice of Tennessee Williams and the play&#x27;s director, Tony Richardson, in the 1963 Broadway revival of Williams&#x27;s play &quot;The Milk Train Doesn&#x27;t Stop Here Anymore&quot; with Tallulah Bankhead. As Tab Hunter said &quot;Tony [Perkins] suggested me to Richardson after a scheduling conflict kept him from playing the part. This gesture meant the world to me... but in a very classy move, neither Richardson nor Perkins ever let on that I wasn&#x27;t the first choice. It would be many years before I learned the truth, too many to be able to thank my old friend.&quot; The show, partly due to the then-recent assassination of United States president John F. Kennedy which kept people inside, closed after three performances.
* Perkins was cast as Robert, the lead role, in the Stephen Sondheim-penned &quot;Company&quot;, which Perkins declined due to scheduling conflicts. Later in life, Perkins attributed his refusal to anxiety as well: &quot;I had signed up to do the lead in &quot;Company&quot; and suddenly this specter rose up in front of me–of performing again for a year and a half–and I dreaded it.&quot; Some people also believed his refusal was because Robert was a seemingly flamboyant character.
* Perkins, after cowriting the script of the movie with Stephen Sondheim, was encouraged to take the role of Clinton, the lead antagonist, in &quot;The Last of Sheila&quot; (1973). Sondheim was one of the major supporters of this casting, seeing Perkins as perfect for the role. Perkins, however, thought it played too much into his already-established deranged persona and passed it up to James Coburn instead.
* Perkins played a horror writer, Anthony Strack, in the television pilot for the show &quot;The Ghost Writer&quot;, which Perkins was enthusiastic about in terms of its prospects, believing it would be the perfect way for him to transition into more comical roles on both stage and screen. The pilot never sold.
* Perkins agreed to provide the voice for the role of the dentist, Dr. Wolfe, in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Last Exit to Springfield&quot;, but died before the part could be recorded. The character was voiced by &quot;Simpsons&quot; regular Hank Azaria.

==Artistry==
===Influences===
Perkins, having grown up in New York as the son of a theater performer, was heavily influenced by stage actors in the early years of his interest in acting. Slowly, however, his influences shifted, especially with the new wave of Method actors on the big screen. In 1958, Perkins admitted to &quot;Holiday&quot; magazine that the single performance that he believed had impacted his acting the most wasn&#x27;t off the boards: &quot;The single performance which influenced my own acting the most was [Marlon] Brando&#x27;s in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;... That&#x27;s the direction I want to go as an actor. To convey the maximum with the simplest, barest means.&quot; He also mentioned James Dean later on: &quot;Well, I was certainly impressed with the originality of [Dean&#x27;s] talent. Of course, it was popular at the time of his emergence.&quot;

Perkins was a lifelong member of the Actors Studio, an institution both Brando and Dean attended as well, which could have contributed to his interest in the Method. Perkins&#x27;s posthumous biographer, Charles Winecoff, though, dismisses any ideas that Perkins was a Method actor: &quot;Young Perkins fell somewhere in between the mannered style of his father&#x27;s era and the new, seemingly organic style exemplified by Brando and Dean.&quot;

Especially in his early years, Perkins took advice from a host of his costars, a majority of whom were experienced and revered actors in their own right. The most influential of his fellow stars were Gary Cooper and Henry Fonda.

===Acting style===
Despite his many celebrated performances, Perkins never discussed the method with which he acted. Many said he was somewhere between his father&#x27;s style of acting (building a character from the outside in) and the Method technique (building a character from the inside out). Recalling how he prepared for his mental breakdown scene in &quot;Fear Strikes Out&quot;, Norma Moore said he was especially &quot;serious, very intent, very nervous before shooting...–pacing, not talking to anybody, shaking his hands.&quot; The film&#x27;s director, Robert Mulligan, said that Perkins was &quot;riding on instinct, very giving and very trusting and very brave.&quot; A year later, when Perkins played Eugene Gant for Broadway in &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot;, not much had changed. &quot;His approach was a purely pragmatic one,&quot; friend George Roy Hill remembered. &quot;He&#x27;d find a way to play it, and he had no theories to get in his way. I don&#x27;t know what devices he used internally, but he was always very concerned with acting as acting.&quot;

There is evidence to suggest that Perkins used previous (sometimes traumatic) experiences to drive his performance. During his debut run on Broadway in &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot;, Perkins was allegedly drafted into the army, which he dodged by admitting he was a homosexual. This backfired, leading to harsh mistreatment at the hands of the Selective Service that reportedly scarred him so much he wouldn&#x27;t speak about it. His boyfriend was there when he returned home, listening to him crying and whimpering. He later said that Perkins incorporated the same whimpering into his performance as Tom Lee in &quot;Sympathy&quot;. Perkins, though, never hinted at this in a rare mention of his technique when speaking about the scene in &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; when Josh Birdwell decides to enlist:
&quot;That scene started [filming at] about 9:30 in the morning and by 1 o&#x27;clock the unions at that time declared that we had to go to lunch, right in the middle of the scene–just before my close-up. And [William Wyler, the director] came to me and said, &#x27;I&#x27;m really sorry about this. You&#x27;re doing a fabulous job and I want you to hold onto this if you possibly can. Why don&#x27;t you go back to your room and sort of concentrate and reread the script? I&#x27;m very very sorry; we&#x27;ll start again in an hour.&#x27; Well, I went to the commissary and had two cheeseburgers and a malted and came back and sat down and started over again. I didn&#x27;t have the self-consciousness as an actor to find that that would be a difficult thing to do, so since I didn&#x27;t think it was gonna be difficult, it wasn&#x27;t... Well, youth can do anything.&quot;

Either way, it worked. Many of Perkins&#x27;s films distinguished him as a powerful actor of the day, garnering numerous awards and nominations. As &quot;Turner Classic Movies&quot; summarized: &quot;A masterful character actor, Perkins&#x27; ability to convey mental instability in a fashion that was simultaneously disturbing, affecting, and darkly humorous made him a unique and valuable talent.&quot;

==Public image==
===Persona===

Throughout his career, Perkins often played shy, sensitive young men. Whether this was the morally-split Josh Birdwell or the awkward and mentally ill Norman Bates, they all distinguished him as one of the rare male actors unafraid to be vulnerable with the audience. &quot;He was supposed to be gawky, you know,&quot; costar Jean Simmons recalled, &quot;with the sleeves too short and all that stuff.&quot; Former partner Tab Hunter spoke similarly about Perkins: &quot;Beneath the boyishness, however, there was a lot of tension–not news to anyone who&#x27;s seen Tony on-screen. The familiar body language wasn&#x27;t an act. He slouched around with his hands shoved deep in his pockets, and he jiggled his foot unconsciously–a nervous twitch.&quot;

Despite his well-documented habits, the authenticity of them has been challenged by some of Perkins&#x27;s friends and colleagues. Alan Sues, who worked with Perkins on &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot;, noted, &quot;You know, if you play that kind of sensitive, I-don&#x27;t-know-if-I-can-get-through-this sort of thing, people come to you. His approach was that he was suffering, that stuff was going on inside of him, and I don&#x27;t think it was. His strong suit was knowing how to project an image.&quot; Although Hunter expressed similar doubts (&quot;I began to wonder how much of his sheepish appeal was genuine,&quot; he wrote in 2005, &quot;and how much was manufactured, used to mask very calculated, methodical intentions&quot;), he did believe overall that Perkins was dealing with a lot of backlash from Paramount over his sexuality, which therefore led him to become as brooding as he was.

However real or fake the mannerisms were, they caught on in the press, which had a field day when Perkins, who didn&#x27;t know how to drive, was photographed hitchhiking to the set of &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot;. He was often described as &quot;boyish&quot; by fan magazines, and his odd habits, from the way he dressed to the meals he ate, were written about in detail. &quot;Photoplay&quot; called Perkins a &quot;barefoot boy with cheek&quot; in a 1957 issue, while later portraying him as an embarrassed singer when they photographed him during recording sessions. Perkins seemingly played into this quirky yet insecure persona, venting to &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;:
&quot;I&#x27;m not really suited to be a movie star. I have no confidence in myself. I&#x27;m not interested in money. I&#x27;m not good-looking. I have a hunch in my spine. I can&#x27;t see worth a damn. I have a very small head. I haven&#x27;t many opinions. I dislike nightclubs–the kind of things that give you easy publicity. I have no string of French girls. I&#x27;m not tough. I can&#x27;t put on a show in public. I&#x27;m much too sensitive for Hollywood. I&#x27;m an easy target.&quot;

He also did so on game shows. As a mystery guest on the popular television program &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, in the Australian accent he had used during his most recent film, &quot;On the Beach&quot;, Perkins responded to a question asking if he was a movie star by saying, &quot;That&#x27;s a term I don&#x27;t like.&quot; After his identity was revealed to the panel of previously blind-folded guessers, Perkins was asked again why he didn&#x27;t prefer the term. &quot;The term movie star,&quot; he said, &quot;implies a certain glamor which I believe I lack.&quot;

Even if some people found Perkins&#x27;s constant complaining about his self-esteem to be annoying, it did earn him fans in the more prominent gossip columnists. Both Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper were fans of him, feeling an almost maternal instinct for him. &quot;[Hopper] was the biggest Tony Perkins fan in town,&quot; Tab Hunter recalled. &quot;She practically declared him her adopted son in print and was eager to publish anything that would bury those rumors about Tony&#x27;s &#x27;secret friend&#x27; [a euphemism for Hunter and their secret relationship often employed by the press].&quot; This also endeared him to Academy Award-winning costume designer Dorothy Jeakins, whom he worked with on &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; and &quot;Green Mansions&quot;. &quot;He had a gift for inciting maternal instinct, particularly in mature women.&quot;

===Sex symbol and teen idol===
Perkins was relentlessly promoted by Paramount Pictures as a sex symbol and teen idol throughout his career, something Perkins saw as a sacrifice to his serious acting prospects. They forced him through a succession of romantic lead roles, whether they were beside relative unknowns such as Norma Moore and Elaine Aiken or powerhouses such as Sophia Loren and Audrey Hepburn. Although he was briefly depicted in drag in &quot;The Matchmaker&quot; with Shirley MacLaine, Perkins&#x27;s image in these films was largely heterosexualized. Despite his 140-pound stature, Perkins delivered a shirtless performance in both &quot;Desire Under the Elms&quot; and &quot;Green Mansions.&quot; This compulsive and brash heterosexualization ended up being detrimental to Perkins&#x27;s career, costing him the leads in both the 1959 film &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; and the 1961 film &quot;West Side Story&quot;.

Even if the masculinity of Perkins&#x27;s image was forced, his beauty was not. As friend Gwen Davis remembered, &quot;He was intellectually dazzling, physically beautiful. At twenty-four, he was already Dorian Gray.&quot; Costar Joan Fickett spoke similarly of Perkins: &quot;Tony had a quality that was fantastic... He was also a beautiful-looking young man.&quot; Even his post-Hollywood friends such as Melina Mercouri agreed: &quot;He was the most intelligent and the most beautiful actor that I played with. He was extremely generous [and gorgeous], a gentleman.&quot;

Perkins&#x27;s popularity as a teen idol was increased by the plentiful stories circulating about his active dating life. Although they ultimately ended up stumped as to how an attractive star such as Perkins could remain a bachelor, Perkins was constantly &quot;losing his heart&quot; to somebody, whether it was Natascia Mangano or Elaine Aiken. Perkins was often claimed to be &quot;infatuated&quot; with many of his leading women, whether they were married or not. Soon, Perkins&#x27;s dating life became as prominent as his career, something Perkins was deeply irritated and annoyed by.

Another source of teenage frenzy around the young actor was his singing career. Although his highest-ranked single in the United States, &quot;Moonlight Swim,&quot; peaked in the 20s on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, his albums were still popular with teenage fans. Many of his songs centered around forbidden romances, something an adoring fan could relate to since they might have seen a potential romance with Perkins, a &quot;movie star,&quot; as forbidden. Many of the songs often described the love interest as young, with two (&quot;The Prettiest Girl in School&quot; and &quot;When School Starts Again Next Year&quot;) explicitly stating that his &quot;girlfriend&quot; was young enough to still be in school. These singles came out shortly before the release of 1960&#x27;s &quot;Tall Story&quot;, where Perkins played a college student, amplifying the teenage frenzy tenfold.

==Personal life==
===Marriage===
There are many conflicting accounts of how Perkins met his future wife, photographer Berinthia &quot;Berry&quot; Berenson, the younger sister of actress and model Marisa Berenson. There were stories that it was at a party in Manhattan in 1972, while some insist it was on the set of &quot;Play It as It Lays&quot;.
Although not romantically involved, Perkins and Berenson saw each other often despite the fact that she was engaged to artist Richard Bernstein at the time. Slowly, the attachment became romantic and then sexual. After telling her fiancé this, Bernstein reportedly reacted by telling Berenson that Perkins was gay and did not reciprocate her feelings. Berenson was said to have replied &quot;No, he&#x27;s going to Mildred Newman and he wants to be straight! He wants to be straight!&quot; Berenson left Bernstein the same day.

Perkins and Berenson married when he was 41 and she was 25 on August 9, 1973, with Berenson three months pregnant. Their first son, actor and director Oz Perkins, was born in 1974, and musician Elvis Perkins followed two years later in 1976. Many friends were surprised by this marriage and believed it would not last long. Venetia Stevenson admitted to Charles Winecoff: &quot;[I]t was a big shock when I heard [Tony] got married. I went, not Tony. He was very gay, totally gay.&quot; Even Berenson admitted some reserves:
&quot;A lot of people looked at the two of us and said &#x27;Who are they kidding? This is never going to work.&#x27; I was so naïve I couldn&#x27;t figure out what they were talking about. He told me [that he was gay], and it just didn&#x27;t register. I had been very sheltered.&quot;

Despite this, Perkins and Berenson remained married until his death. Berenson was killed during the 2001 September 11 attacks. As she was returning to her California home from a vacation on Cape Cod on American Airlines Flight 11, her plane was hijacked and crashed into North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone aboard. She died at the age of 53, one day before the ninth anniversary of Perkins&#x27;s death.

===Sexuality===
Rumors about Perkins&#x27;s sexuality had persisted since the beginning of his career, when he made his Broadway debut in &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot; playing a gay character. Posthumous biographer Charles Winecoff linked him with a mass expulsion of gay men at Rollins College in Florida, where he was an undergraduate, claiming a large group of his friends had been arrested on charges of homosexuality but that Perkins&#x27;s links to the theatre professor saved him from dismissal. However, there is no evidence of this besides the interviews Winecoff conducted with Rollins alumni.

Perkins reportedly had his first experience with a woman at age 39 with actress Victoria Principal on location filming &quot;The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean&quot; in 1971. He was in therapy with psychologist Mildred Newman. In his 2021 biography of Mike Nichols, Harris wrote that &quot;Perkins and his longtime boyfriend, Grover Dale, had both become convinced that their homosexuality was obstructing their happiness and wanted to restart their lives with women,&quot; adding that Newman and her husband–partner Bernard Berkowitz &quot;clung to the belief that male homosexuality was a form of arrested development, and made a small fortune convincing willing clients that it was an impediment to getting what they wanted.&quot; When interviewed for a 1999 documentary on Perkins, friend and collaborator Sidney Lumet said &quot;I [asked him why he went into therapy and] said, &#x27;Well, how about you?&#x27; [He said] &#x27;I&#x27;m a homosexual...&#x27; From then on, he spoke about it completely openly, and I remember when... he said that period of his life was over with, and I said, &#x27;Well, how come, Tony? How did it happen?&#x27; And he said, &#x27;I just didn&#x27;t want it anymore.&#x27;&quot;

Many friends, partners, and colleagues have consistently said Perkins was homosexual rather than bisexual. This is because, up until this point, Perkins had only homosexual relationships and expressed little interest in women. However, Perkins noted in 1983 that his mother and her sexual abuse might have had something to do with it: &quot;She was constantly touching me and caressing me. Not realizing what effect she was having, she would touch me all over, even stroking the inside of my thighs right up to my crotch.&quot; This behavior continued on into his adulthood. This reportedly led to Perkins &quot;being unable to see a beautiful woman,&quot; but many costars and collaborators remembered situations where he would leer over a woman walking down the street. Tab Hunter has called moments such as these a ruse: &quot;You always saw what Tony wanted you to see, which was kind of sad in many ways... An actor plays a role, and pretty soon he takes on that persona. And we&#x27;re all guilty of having done that. I think perhaps Tony&#x27;s persona was the persona that he wanted people to see. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, but there&#x27;s that fine line of knowing how to divorce yourself from yourself.&quot;

====Therapy with Mildred Newman====
In 1971, Perkins ended a seven-year relationship with dancer Grover Dale for unknown reasons, after which he turned to friends Paula Prentiss and Richard Benjamin for help. Both encouraged him to see up-and-coming psychoanalyst Mildred Newman, whose recent self-help book &quot;How to be Your Own Best Friend&quot; was rising up the &quot;New York Times&quot;″s bestseller list. Their meetings became thrice weekly, and sometimes Perkins engaged in group appointments. He later became one of Newman&#x27;s most vocal celebrity supporters. Perkins&#x27;s posthumous biographer, Charles Winecoff, wrote: &quot;Newman&#x27;s therapeutic shtick that it was okay to love yourself without guilt and get the happiness and (mostly) the success that you naturally deserve seemed to be rubbing off on Tony.&quot;

That same year, Newman had written in &quot;How to be Your Own Best Friend&quot; that &quot;analysts once thought they had little chance of changing homosexuals&#x27; preferences and had little success in that direction. But some refused to accept that and kept working with them, and we&#x27;ve found that a homosexual who really wants to change has a very good chance of doing so.&quot;

Later in life, Perkins referred to Newman as an almost peaceful person, &quot;a crusader for a wider road, for choice and limitlessness.&quot; This, though, is not reflected much in Newman&#x27;s actions or the sparse recollections Perkins related about their meetings. Sometimes their discussions ended in weeping spells, especially after Newman asked Perkins to imagine himself having sex with a woman. &quot;&#x27;Why are you crying?&#x27; [Newman] asked. &#x27;I don&#x27;t know,&#x27; Tony answered. &#x27;It&#x27;s so sad, so sad.&#x27;&quot; Other times, they were simple arguments: &quot;She was constantly provoking me about women, asking why I was repressed in that area. We had heated disagreements, knockdown arguments. I would say &#x27;I don&#x27;t want to talk about this again today,&#x27; and she said &#x27;I do want to talk about it.&#x27; We kicked it to pieces.&quot; After Perkins&#x27;s death, Stephen Sondheim publicly labeled Newman and her practices as &quot;completely unethical and a danger to humanity.&quot;

===Relationships===
According to the posthumous biography &quot;Split Image&quot; by Charles Winecoff, Perkins had exclusively same-sex relationships until his late 30s, including with actor Tab Hunter, artist Christopher Makos, and dancer-choreographer Grover Dale. Perkins has also been described as one of the two great men in the life of French songwriter Patrick Loiseau.

====Relationship with Tab Hunter, 1955–1959====
Tab Hunter publicly acknowledged his relationship with Perkins in his 2005 autobiography &quot;Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star&quot;, having met him at the Chateau Marmont during the filming of &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; in 1956:
&quot;I went for a swim and when I came out my friend Venetia Stevenson said, &#x27;Oh I want you to meet Tony – do you know him?&#x27; We hadn&#x27;t met, but I already knew that he was a very fine actor. He was at Paramount and I was with Warner Brothers. We just chatted and got on and soon we were starting to see each other.&quot;

Their relationship went on for four years and had its ups and downs. A few months after their relationship began, Perkins announced to Hunter that Paramount had cast him as Jimmy Piersall in &quot;Fear Strikes Out&quot;, a role Hunter had originated on television and was trying to convince Warner Brothers to introduce on the screen. Hunter, however, stated that even after the incident, &quot;we continued to see each other, privately, as much as our schedules allowed.&quot; This included a multi-week stay together in a private villa in Rome in March 1957 and an appearance on &quot;Jukebox Jury&quot; that May.
During their relationship, Paramount Pictures constantly targeted Perkins for their romance. Many people reported arguments between the studio heads and Perkins, many revolving around Hunter and their relationship. Hunter, however, notes that for many years this had no effect on how they treated each other within their relationship, calling it &quot;a wonderful time in my life.&quot; Despite this, Paramount succeeded in separating the couple in 1959, just before &quot;Psycho&quot; went into filming. After their separation, Perkins and Hunter did not see each other more than twice in the thirty-three years until Perkins&#x27;s death. The first time was on the set of &quot;The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean&quot; in 1971, the only film Perkins and Hunter starred in together. The second was at Perkins&#x27;s home in 1982 when Hunter tried to convince Perkins to play the villain in Hunter&#x27;s upcoming film &quot;Lust in the Dust&quot;, costarring Divine. They nearly spoke a third time in 1992, as Hunter remembered: &quot;I had a hunch to call [Perkins after hearing he was very sick with AIDS] and touch base, and when I picked up the phone, I heard on the radio that he&#x27;d passed away.&quot; Hunter later told &quot;The Advocate&quot; that watching himself speak about Perkins&#x27;s death was one of the most impactful moments of his 2015 documentary.

In addition, he remembered Perkins as a &quot;special part of my journey. If he was shooting a film, I&#x27;d pick up a car and drive out to see him and we&#x27;d spend time together... He wanted to be a movie star more than anything. I wanted that too, but not with the same kind of drive he had. We were such opposites - but then maybe that was the attraction.&quot;

====Relationship with Grover Dale, 1964–1971====

Perkins and Dale met during rehearsals for the Frank Loesser musical &quot;Greenwillow&quot;, in which Perkins played the lead. Dale was an ensemble member, dancer, and Perkins&#x27;s understudy. Their relationship began on the set of the musical. Stanley Simmons, who worked on the production&#x27;s costumes and lived next-door to Perkins in New York, confirmed, &quot;Tony never said anything, but he was having an affair with Grover.&quot; Tony Walton, another actor in the show, agreed the two were involved, &quot;but they were discreet. It wasn&#x27;t a big deal. Folks were aware of it, and [Tony and Grover] didn&#x27;t shove it.&quot; Allegedly, rumors of the relationship were rampant backstage. Posthumous biographer Charles Winecoff claimed they did not live together at the time, while Dale said only a few months passed between their beginning their relationship and his moving into Perkins&#x27;s apartment. The apartment Perkins and Dale shared was, at the time, his only residence in the United States.

By late 1964, posthumous biographer Charles Winecoff asserts that Dale had become &quot;Perkins&#x27;s main man&quot; and that he was often spotted walking down the New York City streets with Perkins, walking his dog Punky. By Dale&#x27;s own admission, they were still together in 1966; the same year, Winecoff describes Perkins&#x27;s relationship with Dale as &quot;soaring back home.&quot; Perkins and Dale were a visible couple, hosting parties for people such as Jerome Robbins and Elaine Stritch, which often ended in an intense match of Scrabble. There were other instances where Winecoff described Perkins and Dale as being &quot;married&quot; to each other, and friend Ben Bagley asserts that Perkins &quot;whispered [the song &#x27;I Cling to You&#x27; from Bagley&#x27;s album] as if he was speaking it to Grover, which he informed his lover of afterward.&quot; Christopher Makos, a friend of Perkins&#x27;s, said of the relationship: &quot;I can&#x27;t speak for Grover, but these were two adult men who probably loved each other very much.&quot; By 1969, just as the Stonewall riots kicked off the movement for gay rights, Perkins and Dale were considered &quot;role models&quot; for other gay professionals looking to have open relationships. Dale was considered one of the major loves of Perkins&#x27;s life.

===Friendships===

Throughout his time in Hollywood, Perkins worked with a host of famous personalities, many of whom remembered him fondly. Among his costars and leading ladies, there was usually mutual endearment. Sophia Loren remembered Perkins&#x27;s dressing room for 1958&#x27;s &quot;Desire Under the Elms&quot; as looking like a monk&#x27;s cell, and she was often photographed smiling and laughing with him when they reunited in Europe a few years afterward. In the press, Perkins discussed how his main objective while making 1959&#x27;s &quot;Green Mansions&quot; was only to make Audrey Hepburn laugh every day, and Elaine Aiken recalled that Perkins often diverted her attention away from her plate on &quot;dates&quot; so he could steal some of her food. &quot;I don&#x27;t think we ever discussed [him being gay, which Aiken knew about], it didn&#x27;t matter,&quot; she recalled. &quot;It didn&#x27;t bother me. I just wanted a friend.&quot; A similar bond was forged between Perkins and Venetia Stevenson, to whom he would &quot;unburden&quot; himself. &quot;[Perkins] would sleep over and tell me sad stories,&quot; Stevenson told Tab Hunter. &quot;He was totally crazy about you.&quot; She also mentioned to biographer Charles Winecoff, &quot;We were real friends, and he would sleep over at my house [which was a block away from Perkins and Hunter&#x27;s apartments] in the same bed. But there was never, ever any... well, you know. If you have a friend of the opposite sex who&#x27;s gay, it&#x27;s just in the air. You know what I mean?&quot;

Although he got on famously with women, he also had many friendships with men. Despite Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s infamous saying that &quot;actors are cattle,&quot; he got along well with Perkins on the set of &quot;Psycho&quot;. Hitchcock accepted many of Perkins&#x27;s ideas for the character of Norman Bates, including the suggestion that he should nibble on candy corn. Even after Perkins moved to France, he was a common addition to Hitchcock&#x27;s dinner table. Perkins was also a favorite of Orson Welles, whom he collaborated with four times.

Perhaps the most famous of his male friendships was with Stephen Sondheim, whom he briefly lived with for a time. Since penning &quot;Evening Primrose&quot; for Perkins, which was the only project of Sondheim&#x27;s Perkins actually starred, Perkins became a muse to him, inspiring many musicals, where Sondheim cast him in all the leads. Perkins, however, turned all of these down, mostly due to scheduling conflicts. When discussing Perkins and the process of writing &quot;The Last of Sheila&quot; together, Sondheim said, &quot;I knew he had exactly my mind and take and he&#x27;s much more into murder mysteries than I am, so we started to plot it. We spent a couple of months plotting it, and had such a good time we decided to go ahead and write it. I think the most fun I&#x27;ve ever had writing anything was writing [&quot;The Last of Sheila&quot;″s] screenplay.&quot; Sondheim was later named the godfather to both of Perkins&#x27;s children and was present at Perkins&#x27;s final birthday party.

===Character and interests===
Perkins was largely remembered by friends and associates as being a shy, neurotic young man, with the ability to be very alluring. Bruce Jay Friedman, a later collaborator of Perkins&#x27;s in the production &quot;Steambath&quot;, remarked, &quot;He was enormously charming, but also very controlled. He always seemed to have four ideas going on in his head at once.&quot; Mary Tyler Moore, who worked with Perkins on the hugely popular &quot;First, You Cry&quot; TV movie, remembered Perkins similarly: &quot;He was a charming person, a very keen actor who seemed to love his work... He was just a nice guy, and not what I had expected at all. I had expected him to be arch and very sophisticated and stylish–and I&#x27;m sure he was all those things–but that&#x27;s not what you most remembered about him.&quot;

Although former partner Tab Hunter remembered Perkins similarly, he was more open about acknowledging the complexities of Perkins: &quot;You never really knew Tony a hundred percent. He was a bit of a game player with people&#x27;s minds.&quot; However, he also saw Perkins as being a multi-layered, realistic person with flaws:
I don&#x27;t think many people really knew Tony well. He had friends. A lot of people liked him, but he had few friends that he really confided in. I don&#x27;t know for sure what he was really like. You always saw what Tony wanted you to see, which was kind of sad in many ways... He was a wonderful guy, and he had a very funny, very dry sense of humor.

In our society everyone wants to know everything about everybody 100 percent. And you never really knew everything that was going on with Tony. It was still water that ran pretty deep.

Perkins&#x27;s shy, introverted personality led to one-man activities. Since he was a young boy, he was often preoccupied with books and adored reading. When asked, he playfully admitted he was a lover of science fiction, but he could not stand brooding philosophical books. This went hand-in-hand with his interest in writing, which he indulged in throughout life. While at Browne &amp; Nichols School, he was made co-literary editor of the school paper, &quot;The Spectator&quot;, to which he occasionally contributed articles. This interest made its way into his professional life, when Perkins cowrote &quot;The Last of Sheila&quot; with Stephen Sondheim years later. It was the only time he wrote a screenplay, as Perkins reflected years later: &quot;Acting was just memorizing lines, and I was good at that. Writing was harder and required more work.&quot;

However uninterested in interaction Perkins was, his interests were not solely solitary. Perkins was a fan of the board game Scrabble, and when entertaining his first alleged boyfriend, he often engaged him in a round. He was also a fan of &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, which he eventually appeared on during his heyday. This interest in games and television programs lent itself to the many victories Perkins achieved in game shows such as &quot;Password&quot;, where he got his partner to guess the secret word. Even his regular impersonations of famous actors and costars did him good when he appeared on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and fooled the panelists.

His wit was not the only thing employed during activities. Tab Hunter remembered Perkins purchasing a deluxe portable ping-pong table for him one Christmas. &quot;We set it up on the terrace and played marathon matches.&quot; His shrewdness, though, made frequent appearances during their private meetings and dates: &quot;On occasion, Tony would go with me to the barn or go to a show I was riding in, but he wasn&#x27;t crazy about horses. Sometimes we&#x27;d head up to Watson Webb&#x27;s place at Lake Arrowhead to water-ski. He wasn&#x27;t the athletic type, however. His amusement came from using his quirky, brainy charm and extremely dry humor.&quot;

===Political views===

Perkins was a Democrat who supported many progressive causes, such as civil rights and feminism. Perkins participated in the 1965 Selma march for the right for African Americans to vote, and there are numerous photos and videos documenting his participation, most notably where he stands to the left of Martin Luther King Jr., who is being waved at by Harry Belafonte. He was one of the many performers at the &quot;Stars for Freedom&quot; rally during the marches who entertained King and the rest of the marchers, singing folk songs and giving brief speeches. He also continued on to Montgomery, the Alabama state capital, the next day.

Perkins promoted feminism, famously proclaiming in 1983: &quot;Women&#x27;s liberation has liberated me too.&quot; He openly acknowledged that he believed men should take on &quot;motherly&quot; roles as well when raising their children and that he changed diapers and fed his infants—something he said he did not need to receive praise for.

Despite the fact that he remained mostly closeted for his entire life, Perkins did express his support for LGBTQ+ rights occasionally. In an interview with Boze Hadleigh, he stated that the idea that marriage is primarily between a man and a woman was &quot;archaic,&quot; and that, if having children was the sole reason to get married, &quot;gays can adopt.&quot; Even before getting diagnosed with the illness, Perkins also regularly volunteered at Project Angel Food, a non-profit organization which delivered meals to HIV and AIDS patients. In September 1986, six years before his death, Perkins also released a PSA urging people to &quot;fight AIDS with the facts.&quot;

===Religion===
Although his mother had been born in a strict religious household, Perkins was not. The only discussions that arose about religion while growing up were begun by Perkins, usually to disgust his mother. It was because of this that Perkins classified himself as an atheist throughout his lifetime, but he celebrated holidays such as Christmas in a non-religious context.

Perkins rarely discussed religion outside of his character&#x27;s faiths (for example, he played a minister in &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot;). Whenever he did talk about it personally, it was almost always tied with how religion was often used as an excuse not to legalize same-sex marriage. Speaking to Boze Hadleigh later in life, he said &quot;Common sense isn&#x27;t really that common, particularly when religion enters the picture.&quot;

==Death==
During the filming of &quot;Psycho IV: The Beginning&quot;, Perkins was undergoing treatment for facial palsy. He was tested for HIV after an article in &quot;National Enquirer&quot;, a tabloid newspaper, said he was HIV-positive. Berenson said her husband had not been tested for HIV but had been given a series of blood tests in Los Angeles for the palsy on the side of his face. Ms. Berenson said she assumed that someone had tested her husband&#x27;s blood for the virus and leaked the results to the tabloid.

Perkins hid the fact that he had AIDS from the public for two years, going in and out of hospitals under assumed names. During this time, his wife and children were regularly tested; they all always came back negative. It was not until a few weeks before his death that he went public with the disease, although he had been working on movies during the time of his illness. He died at his Los Angeles home on September 12, 1992, from AIDS-related pneumonia aged 60. In a statement prepared before his death, Perkins said, &quot;I chose not to go public about [having AIDS] because, to misquote &quot;Casablanca&quot;, &#x27;I&#x27;m not much good at being noble,&#x27; but it doesn&#x27;t take much to see that the problems of one old actor don&#x27;t amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. I have learned more about love, selflessness and human understanding from the people I have met in this great adventure in the world of AIDS than I ever did in the cutthroat, competitive world in which I spent my life.&quot;

His urn, inscribed &quot;Don&#x27;t Fence Me In&quot;, is in an altar on the terrace of his former home in the Hollywood Hills.

==Legacy==

Perkins is considered a cultural icon and an influential figure in film because of his long career, most notably his defining role as Norman Bates in &quot;Psycho&quot;. Countless references, spoofs, and documentaries have been made about the thriller and his homicidal character, and it has led many to pronounce the motion picture as the greatest horror film of all time. AFI named Norman Bates the second greatest villain of all time, beaten only by Hannibal Lecter from &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;.

The character of Norman Bates has been referenced numerous times in both music and film. As early as 1964, just four years after the release of &quot;Psycho&quot;, Bob Dylan referenced the film extensively on his track &quot;Motorpsycho Nightmare,&quot; a humorous tale about a traveling salesman. Perkins is even mentioned by name:
Even after the immediate release of &quot;Psycho&quot;, its influence remained prominent. In 1977, Blondie referenced Norman Bates on their track &quot;Kidnapper&quot;: &quot;Hey, you&#x27;ve got an unnerving face/And twitchin&#x27; eyes like Norman Bates.&quot; In 1981, English band Landscape released the song &quot;Norman Bates&quot; with the chorus &quot;My name is Norman Bates; I&#x27;m just a normal guy.&quot; In 1999, Eminem referenced Bates on &quot;Role Model&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m &#x27;bout as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits/...Mother, are you there? I love you/I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel (That shovel).&quot; Five years later, Kanye West paid homage to Perkins&#x27;s homicidal character on &quot;Gossip Files&quot;: &quot;Uh, they are the dream (Killer Norman Bates).&quot; Even fifty-five years after the film&#x27;s release, Lil Wayne mentioned the iconic character on &quot;Amazing Amy&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m Norman Bates and this bitch ain&#x27;t normal, our kids gon&#x27; be nuts (Not the babies!).&quot; Perkins was mentioned by name in the iconic 1996 film &quot;Scream&quot;, where Billy Loomis, about to kill Sidney Prescott, says, &quot;&#x27;We all go a little mad sometimes&#x27;–Anthony Perkins, &quot;Psycho&quot;.&quot; This seemed to only solidify Perkins&#x27;s icon status in the horror genre.

It was not just &quot;Psycho&quot; that was admired. Perkins&#x27;s first major motion picture, &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot;, received an abrupt resurgence in interest after President Ronald Reagan labeled the film as his favorite. It also served diplomatic purposes: during one of their five summit meetings, Reagan gifted the film to Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev because he viewed the film as symbolic of the need to find an alternative to war as a means of resolving differences between peoples. One Quaker commentator stated: &quot;&quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; seems to me to come about as close to truth and fairness as I expect to see Hollywood get in a treatment of Quakerism; I recommend it to every Quaker parent, as projecting images their children ought to see and imitate... I believe (critics have) woefully misjudged the film, on several counts: its place in American cinema, the characters and their roles, its historicity, and, not least, its value as an expression of the Peace Testimony. Here, for perhaps the only time, I think Ronald Reagan was closer to the truth when he commended the film to Gorbachev because it &#x27;shows not the tragedy of war, but the problems of pacifism, the nobility of patriotism as well as the love of peace. &quot;Fear Strikes Out&quot; also was subjected to similar treatment after it was nominated for the American Film Institute&#x27;s 2008 list in the sports film category. Even his European films were praised: eight years after Perkins&#x27;s death, renowned and respected film critic Roger Ebert called &quot;The Trial&quot; a masterpiece.

Even if they were not distinguished by an award, many of Perkins&#x27;s films earned cult followings throughout the years. &quot;The Trial&quot; was one of them, with some people considering the film even better than &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. &quot;Pretty Poison&quot; was another instance, and perhaps the most famous. Television appearances such as &quot;Evening Primrose&quot; and &quot;Remember My Name&quot; also received this treatment, with &quot;Primrose&quot; finding a big fan in famous singer Michael Jackson. The same occurred with &quot;The Black Hole&quot; and &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot;.

Perkins has also been considered an icon of the New York actors of Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age, often being compared to legendary performers Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, and even James Dean, whom he was once set to replace. He became a poster child for neurotic and shy men, many of whom felt outcast in average American society. Other times, he was the model for odd boys with murderous tendencies. Either way, Perkins was always praised for his heartfelt and dedicated performances, as Brando, Clift, and Dean had been. Generations of actors were inspired by him, as Sebastian Stan put: &quot;I have a bit of an obsession with the 1950s and all those actors from Montgomery Clift to James Dean and Anthony Perkins. Just that whole era of Tennessee Williams to Elia Kazan. The whole idea of New York and the whole thing becomes kind of romantic in your head.&quot; Jane Fonda credited Perkins alone with making her comfortable in front of the camera, and Michael Simkims, who worked with Perkins just months before his death on &quot;A Demon in My View&quot;, remembered Perkins well for his professionalism and willingness to help anyone–including himself–who was having trouble with a scene. Established actors admired his abilities, as Maria Cooper Janis remembered about her father, Gary Cooper: &quot;I know my father adored Tony Perkins. He thought he was one hell of an actor.&quot; After his death, Perkins&#x27;s art still lingered in Hollywood, especially in the Academy Award-nominated thriller film &quot;Knives Out&quot;, which was inspired by &quot;The Last of Sheila&quot;, according to the film&#x27;s director-producer Rian Johnson.

It was not just his professional life that became part of Perkins&#x27;s legacy. He was outspoken about politically left causes, making him appealing to liberals. He was recognized by numerous minorities, including the ones he belonged to, as a tireless advocate for the causes he stood for, such as civil rights, feminism, and (even despite his own closeted nature) LGBTQ+ rights and same-sex marriage. By the late 1960s, just as the Stonewall riots hit their stride and gay rights protests began to appear all over the country, Perkins and his lover Grover Dale were seen as role models for gay professionals who wanted to have open relationships.

His death from AIDS-related causes also greatly affected how he was remembered. Alongside Rock Hudson, Perkins is considered one of the most significant actors to have died from the disease. There were countless tributes to him around the world, pouring in from news stations and average citizens. In New Zealand, Perkins was one of the many famous people honored in their national AIDS remembrance quilt in 1994.

Although rumors had always persisted, Perkins was not confirmed as gay until a posthumous biography by Charles Winecoff entitled &quot;Split Image: the Life of Anthony Perkins&quot; was published in 1996. The book delves deep into Perkins&#x27;s personal life and his battle with his sexuality while being a poster-child for heterosexual men, something the author claimed deeply tormented him. The biography&#x27;s publication led to Perkins being featured in numerous gay magazines, most notably &quot;The Advocate&quot;.

In 2005, former partner Tab Hunter released the memoir &quot;Tab Hunter Confidential&quot;, in which he publicly came out as a gay man.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt2003/09/09&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the autobiography, he admitted to his relationship with Perkins for the first time after having previously denied it to biographers. He detailed their three- to four-year affair, with its many ups and downs. &quot;We were both drawn to each other because we were both ambitious young actors swimming in the Hollywood fishbowl,&quot; Hunter wrote, &quot;where the waters are dark and murky and treacherous, especially if you&#x27;ve got a &#x27;secret. This returned public interest to Perkins once more, this time as both a cinematic and gay icon.
Nearly a decade later, Perkins was portrayed by British actor James D&#x27;Arcy in the 2012 biographical drama &quot;Hitchcock&quot;, which starred Anthony Hopkins as Alfred Hitchcock and Helen Mirren as Alma Reville, about the filming of &quot;Psycho&quot;. His character was featured briefly, with most of the screen time going to Scarlett Johansson, who played Janet Leigh. His homosexuality was never explicitly mentioned, but it was heavily implied. Three years afterwards, Tab Hunter released the Jeffrey Schwarz-directed documentary &quot;Tab Hunter Confidential&quot;, where he further elaborated on his life as a closeted movie star and surviving show-business. Perkins was a substantial addition in the film, whom Hunter said he had a &quot;wonderful relationship with. I was comfortable with him. I did trust him.&quot; He also spoke for the first time about his reaction to Perkins&#x27;s wife, children, and conversion therapy. The film was well received by critics, and Perkins&#x27;s sexuality and relationship with Hunter became a popular story that circulated through newspapers.

A year following &quot;Tab Hunter Confidential&quot;″s release, Perkins&#x27;s son, Oz, released the Netflix-distributed &quot;I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House&quot;, a horror film about a caretaker for an elderly woman. Paula Prentiss, who had starred alongside Perkins in &quot;Catch-22&quot;, was cast because of her association with the late star and was the only option his son had in mind. In interviews, Oz discussed how the film was a way to connect with his deceased father and how horror (since Perkins is a horror icon) was the only way to do it. The soundtrack for the film was composed by Elvis Perkins, Perkins&#x27;s second son, and &quot;You Keep Coming Back (Like a Song)&quot; off of Perkins&#x27;s 1958 &quot;From My Heart...&quot; album was a central part of the plot. In the film, the characters can also be seen watching &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot;.

In 2018, Zachary Quinto and J. J. Abrams announced that a new film was in the works. Entitled &quot;Tab and Tony&quot; (&quot;hesitantly,&quot; as they later reported), the film would follow the Tab Hunter/Anthony Perkins relationship from Hunter&#x27;s point of view, and was based on both Hunter&#x27;s documentary and memoir. Pulitzer Prize- and Tony Award-winning writer Doug Wright was attached to create the screenplay, and even after Hunter&#x27;s death a month after the announcement, Quinto announced that plans to create the film were still in place. In 2019, Allan Glaser, Tab Hunter&#x27;s husband, who was signed onto the film as a producer, made a positive update about the film&#x27;s progress and stated that Andrew Garfield was a possible candidate to play Perkins.

Perkins was a part of Philippe Halsman&#x27;s famous &quot;Jump&quot; series, in which Halsman requested all famous sitters to leap for him under the impression that while people were trained in many other things, no one was ever taught how to jump. Alongside famous Hollywood contemporaries such as Eartha Kitt, Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, Sammy Davis Jr., Grace Kelly, Sophia Loren, and even Tab Hunter, Halsman&#x27;s photo of a jumping Perkins has been widely reproduced and shared over the years.

For his work, Perkins received two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one for motion pictures (6821 Hollywood Blvd.) and one for television (6801 Hollywood Blvd.).

<text>In computing, protected mode, also called protected virtual address mode, is an operational mode of x86-compatible central processing units (CPUs). It allows system software to use features such as segmentation, virtual memory, paging and safe multi-tasking designed to increase an operating system&#x27;s control over application software.

When a processor that supports x86 protected mode is powered on, it begins executing instructions in real mode, in order to maintain backward compatibility with earlier x86 processors. Protected mode may only be entered after the system software sets up one descriptor table and enables the Protection Enable (PE) bit in the control register 0 (CR0).

Protected mode was first added to the x86 architecture in 1982, with the release of Intel&#x27;s 80286 (286) processor, and later extended with the release of the 80386 (386) in 1985. Due to the enhancements added by protected mode, it has become widely adopted and has become the foundation for all subsequent enhancements to the x86 (IA-32) architecture, although many of those enhancements, such as added instructions and new registers, also brought benefits to the real mode.

== History ==

The first x86 processor, the Intel 8086, had a 20-bit address bus for its memory, as did its Intel 8088 variant. This allowed them to access 220 bytes of memory, equivalent to 1 megabyte. At the time, 1 megabyte was considered a relatively large amount of memory, so the designers of the IBM Personal Computer reserved the first 640 kilobytes for use by applications and the operating system and the remaining 384 kilobytes for the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) and memory for add-on devices.

As the cost of memory decreased and memory use increased, the 1 MB limitation became a significant problem. Intel intended to solve this limitation along with others with the release of the 286.

=== The 286 ===
The initial protected mode, released with the 286, was not widely used; for example, it was used by Coherent (from 1982), Microsoft Xenix (around 1984) and Minix. Several shortcomings such as the inability to make BIOS and DOS calls due to inability to switch back to real mode without resetting the processor prevented widespread usage. Acceptance was additionally hampered by the fact that the 286 only allowed memory access in 64 kilobyte segments, addressed by its four segment registers, meaning that only , equivalent to 256 KB, could be accessed at a time. Because changing a segment register in protected mode caused a 6-byte segment descriptor to be loaded into the CPU from memory, the segment register load instruction took many tens of processor cycles, making it much slower than on the 8086 and 8088; therefore, the strategy of computing segment addresses on-the-fly in order to access data structures larger than 128 kilobytes (the combined size of the two data segments) became impractical, even for those few programmers who had mastered it on the 8086 and 8088.

The 286 maintained backward compatibility with the 8086 and 8088 by initially entering real mode on power up. Real mode functioned virtually identically to the 8086 and 8088, allowing the vast majority of existing software for those processors to run unmodified on the newer 286. Real mode also served as a more basic mode in which protected mode could be set up, solving a sort of chicken-and-egg problem. To access the extended functionality of the 286, the operating system would set up some tables in memory that controlled memory access in protected mode, set the addresses of those tables into some special registers of the processor, and then set the processor into protected mode. This enabled 24-bit addressing, which allowed the processor to access 224 bytes of memory, equivalent to 16 megabytes.

=== The 386 ===

With the release of the 386 in 1985, many of the issues preventing widespread adoption of the previous protected mode were addressed. The 386 was released with an address bus size of 32 bits, which allows for 232 bytes of memory accessing, equivalent to 4 gigabytes. The segment sizes were also increased to 32 bits, meaning that the full address space of 4 gigabytes could be accessed without the need to switch between multiple segments. In addition to the increased size of the address bus and segment registers, many other new features were added with the intention of increasing operational security and stability. Protected mode is now used in virtually all modern operating systems which run on the x86 architecture, such as Microsoft Windows, Linux, and many others.

Furthermore, learning from the failures of the 286 protected mode to satisfy the needs for multiuser DOS, Intel added a separate virtual 8086 mode, which allowed multiple virtualized 8086 processors to be emulated on the 386. Hardware x86 virtualization required for virtualizing the protected mode itself, however, had to wait for another 20 years.

== 386 additions to protected mode ==

With the release of the 386, the following additional features were added to protected mode:

* Paging
* 32-bit physical and virtual address space (The 32-bit physical address space is not present on the 80386SX, and other 386 processor variants which use the older 286 bus.)
* 32-bit segment offsets
* Ability to switch back to real mode without resetting
* Virtual 8086 mode

== Entering and exiting protected mode ==

Until the release of the 386, protected mode did not offer a direct method to switch back into real mode once protected mode was entered. IBM devised a workaround (implemented in the IBM AT) which involved resetting the CPU via the keyboard controller and saving the system registers, stack pointer and often the interrupt mask in the real-time clock chip&#x27;s RAM. This allowed the BIOS to restore the CPU to a similar state and begin executing code before the reset. Later, a triple fault was used to reset the 286 CPU, which was a lot faster and cleaner than the keyboard controller method (and does not depend on IBM AT-compatible hardware, but will work on any 80286 CPU in any system).

To enter protected mode, the Global Descriptor Table (GDT) must first be created with a minimum of three entries: a null descriptor, a code segment descriptor and data segment descriptor. In an IBM-compatible machine, the A20 line (21st address line) also must be enabled to allow the use of all the address lines so that the CPU can access beyond 1 megabyte of memory (Only the first 20 are allowed to be used after power-up, to guarantee compatibility with older software written for the Intel 8088-based IBM PC and PC/XT models). After performing those two steps, the PE bit must be set in the CR0 register and a far jump must be made to clear the prefetch input queue.
; MASM program
; enter protected mode (set PE bit)
mov EBX, CR0 ; save control register 0 (CR0) to EBX
or EBX, PE_BIT ; set PE bit by ORing, save to EBX
mov CR0, EBX ; save EBX back to CR0

; clear prefetch queue; (using far jump instruction jmp)
jmp CLEAR_LABEL
CLEAR_LABEL:
With the release of the 386, protected mode could be exited by loading the segment registers with real mode values, disabling the A20 line and clearing the PE bit in the CR0 register, without the need to perform the initial setup steps required with the 286.
== Features ==

Protected mode has a number of features designed to enhance an operating system&#x27;s control over application software, in order to increase security and system stability. These additions allow the operating system to function in a way that would be significantly more difficult or even impossible without proper hardware support.

=== Privilege levels ===

In protected mode, there are four privilege levels or rings, numbered from 0 to 3, with ring 0 being the most privileged and 3 being the least. The use of rings allows for system software to restrict tasks from accessing data, call gates or executing privileged instructions. In most environments, the operating system and some device drivers run in ring 0 and applications run in ring 3.

=== Real mode application compatibility ===

According to the &quot;Intel 80286 Programmer&#x27;s Reference Manual&quot;,

For the most part, the binary compatibility with real-mode code, the ability to access up to 16 MB of physical memory, and 1 GB of virtual memory, were the most apparent changes to application programmers. This was not without its limitations. If an application utilized or relied on any of the techniques below, it would not run:

* Segment arithmetic
* Privileged instructions
* Direct hardware access
* Writing to a code segment
* Executing data
* Overlapping segments
* Use of BIOS functions, due to the BIOS interrupts being reserved by Intel

In reality, almost all DOS application programs violated these rules. Due to these limitations, virtual 8086 mode was introduced with the 386. Despite such potential setbacks, Windows 3.0 and its successors can take advantage of the binary compatibility with real mode to run many Windows 2.x (Windows 2.0 and Windows 2.1x) applications in protected mode, which ran in real mode in Windows 2.x.

=== Virtual 8086 mode ===
With the release of the 386, protected mode offers what the Intel manuals call &quot;virtual 8086 mode&quot;. Virtual 8086 mode is designed to allow code previously written for the 8086 to run unmodified and concurrently with other tasks, without compromising security or system stability.

Virtual 8086 mode, however, is not completely backward compatible with all programs. Programs that require segment manipulation, privileged instructions, direct hardware access, or use self-modifying code will generate an exception that must be served by the operating system. In addition, applications running in virtual 8086 mode generate a trap with the use of instructions that involve input/output (I/O), which can negatively impact performance.

Due to these limitations, some programs originally designed to run on the 8086 cannot be run in virtual 8086 mode. As a result, system software is forced to either compromise system security or backward compatibility when dealing with legacy software. An example of such a compromise can be seen with the release of Windows NT, which dropped backward compatibility for &quot;ill-behaved&quot; DOS applications.

=== Segment addressing ===

==== Real mode ====
In real mode each logical address points directly into a physical memory location, every logical address consists of two 16-bit parts: The segment part of the logical address contains the base address of a segment with a granularity of 16 bytes, i.e. a segment may start at physical address 0, 16, 32, ..., 220 − 16. The offset part of the logical address contains an offset inside the segment, i.e. the physical address can be calculated as physical_address = segment_part × 16 + offset, if the address line A20 is enabled, or (segment_part × 16 + offset) mod 220, if A20 is off. Every segment has a size of 216 bytes.

==== Protected mode ====
In protected mode, the is replaced by a 16-bit &quot;selector&quot;, in which the 13 upper bits (bit 3 to bit 15) contain the index of an &quot;entry&quot; inside a &quot;descriptor table&quot;. The next bit (bit 2) specifies whether the operation is used with the GDT or the LDT. The lowest two bits (bit 1 and bit 0) of the selector are combined to define the privilege of the request, where the values of 0 and 3 represent the highest and the lowest privilege, respectively. This means that the byte offset of descriptors in the descriptor table is the same as the 16-bit selector, provided the lower three bits are zeroed.

The descriptor table entry defines the real &quot;linear&quot; address of the segment, a limit value for the segment size, and some attribute bits (flags).

==== 286 ====
The segment address inside the descriptor table entry has a length of 24 bits so every byte of the physical memory can be defined as bound of the segment. The limit value inside the descriptor table entry has a length of 16 bits so segment length can be between 1 byte and 216 byte. The calculated linear address equals the physical memory address.

==== 386 ====
The segment address inside the descriptor table entry is expanded to 32 bits so every byte of the physical memory can be defined as bound of the segment. The limit value inside the descriptor table entry is expanded to 20 bits and completed with a granularity flag (G-bit, for short):

* If G-bit is zero limit has a granularity of 1 byte, i.e. segment size may be 1, 2, ..., 220 bytes.
* If G-bit is one limit has a granularity of 212 bytes, i.e. segment size may be 1 × 212, 2 × 212, ..., 220 × 212 bytes. If paging is off, the calculated linear address equals the physical memory address. If paging is on, the calculated linear address is used as input of paging.

The 386 processor also uses 32 bit values for the address offset.

For maintaining compatibility with 286 protected mode a new default flag (D-bit, for short) was added. If the D-bit of a code segment is off (0) all commands inside this segment will be interpreted as 16-bit commands by default; if it is on (1), they will be interpreted as 32-bit commands.

==== Structure of segment descriptor entry ====

Where:
*&quot;A&quot; is the &quot;Accessed&quot; bit;
*&quot;R&quot; is the &quot;Readable&quot; bit;
*&quot;C&quot; (Bit 42) depends on &quot;X&quot;:
**if &quot;X&quot; = 1 then &quot;C&quot; is the &quot;Conforming&quot; bit, and determines which privilege levels can far-jump to this segment (without changing privilege level):
***if &quot;C&quot; = 0 then only code with the same privilege level as &quot;DPL&quot; may jump here;
***if &quot;C&quot; = 1 then code with the same or a lower privilege level relative to &quot;DPL&quot; may jump here.
**if &quot;X&quot; = 0 then &quot;C&quot; is the &quot;direction&quot; bit:
***if &quot;C&quot; = 0 then the segment grows &quot;up&quot;;
***if &quot;C&quot; = 1 then the segment grows &quot;down&quot;.
*&quot;X&quot; is the &quot;Executable&quot; bit:
**if &quot;X&quot; = 1 then the segment is a code segment;
**if &quot;X&quot; = 0 then the segment is a data segment.
*&quot;S&quot; is the &quot;Segment type&quot; bit, which should generally be cleared for system segments;
*&quot;DPL&quot; is the &quot;Descriptor Privilege Level&quot;;
*&quot;P&quot; is the &quot;Present&quot; bit;
*&quot;D&quot; is the &quot;Default operand size&quot;;
*&quot;G&quot; is the &quot;Granularity&quot; bit;
*Bit 52 of the 80386 descriptor is not used by the hardware.
=== Paging ===


In addition to adding virtual 8086 mode, the 386 also added paging to protected mode. Through paging, system software can restrict and control a task&#x27;s access to pages, which are sections of memory. In many operating systems, paging is used to create an independent virtual address space for each task, preventing one task from manipulating the memory of another. Paging also allows for pages to be moved out of primary storage and onto a slower and larger secondary storage, such as a hard disk drive. This allows for more memory to be used than physically available in primary storage.

The x86 architecture allows control of pages through two arrays: page directories and page tables. Originally, a page directory was the size of one page, four kilobytes, and contained 1,024 page directory entries (PDE), although subsequent enhancements to the x86 architecture have added the ability to use larger page sizes. Each PDE contained a pointer to a page table. A page table was also originally four kilobytes in size and contained 1,024 page table entries (PTE). Each PTE contained a pointer to the actual page&#x27;s physical address and are only used when the four-kilobyte pages are used. At any given time, only one page directory may be in active use.

=== Multitasking ===
Through the use of the rings, privileged call gates, and the Task State Segment (TSS), introduced with the 286, preemptive multitasking was made possible on the x86 architecture. The TSS allows general-purpose registers, segment selector fields, and stacks to all be modified without affecting those of another task. The TSS also allows a task&#x27;s privilege level, and I/O port permissions to be independent of another task&#x27;s.

In many operating systems, the full features of the TSS are not used. This is commonly due to portability concerns or due to the performance issues created with hardware task switches. As a result, many operating systems use both hardware and software to create a multitasking system.

== Operating systems ==
Operating systems like OS/2 1.x try to switch the processor between protected and real modes. This is both slow and unsafe, because a real mode program can easily crash a computer. OS/2 1.x defines restrictive programming rules allowing a &quot;Family API&quot; or &quot;bound&quot; program to run in either real or protected mode. Some early Unix operating systems, OS/2 1.x, and Windows used this mode.

Windows 3.0 was able to run real mode programs in 16-bit protected mode; when switching to protected mode, it decided to preserve the single privilege level model that was used in real mode, which is why Windows applications and DLLs can hook interrupts and do direct hardware access. That lasted through the Windows 9x series. If a Windows 1.x or 2.x program is written properly and avoids segment arithmetic, it will run the same way in both real and protected modes. Windows programs generally avoid segment arithmetic because Windows implements a software virtual memory scheme, moving program code and data in memory when programs are not running, so manipulating absolute addresses is dangerous; programs should only keep handles to memory blocks when not running. Starting an old program while Windows 3.0 is running in protected mode triggers a warning dialog, suggesting to either run Windows in real mode or to obtain an updated version of the application. Updating well-behaved programs using the MARK utility with the MEMORY parameter avoids this dialog. It is not possible to have some GUI programs running in 16-bit protected mode and other GUI programs running in real mode. In Windows 3.1, real mode was no longer supported and could not be accessed.

In modern 32-bit operating systems, virtual 8086 mode is still used for running applications, e.g. DPMI compatible DOS extender programs (through virtual DOS machines) or Windows 3.x applications (through the Windows on Windows subsystem) and certain classes of device drivers (e.g. for changing the screen-resolution using BIOS functionality) in OS/2 2.0 (and later OS/2) and 32-bit Windows NT, all under control of a 32-bit kernel. However, 64-bit operating systems (which run in long mode) no longer use this, since virtual 8086 mode has been removed from long mode.

<doc id="167599" wikidata="Q51416" url="?curid=167599" title="Men in Black (1997 film)">
<text>Men in Black is a 1997 American science fiction action comedy film starring Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith as &quot;men in black&quot;, secret agents who monitor and police extraterrestrials. The film is directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, based on a script by Ed Solomon, that adapts the Marvel Comics series &quot;The Men in Black&quot; by Lowell Cunningham. In the film, Agent K (Jones) and Agent J (Smith) investigate a series of seemingly unrelated criminal incidents related to the extraterrestrials who live in secret on Earth. Linda Fiorentino, Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio, and Rip Torn also appear in supporting roles.

Development for the film began in 1992, after producers Walter F. Parkes and Laurie MacDonald optioned the rights to the comic book series. Solomon was soon hired to write the screenplay; Sonnenfeld was the preferred directorial choice, which resulted in delays due to his commitments to other film projects and a failure to secure any alternative directors. Principal photography began in March 1996 and lasted until that June, with filming primarily taking place in New York City. The film&#x27;s visual effects were helmed by Industrial Light &amp; Magic. The film&#x27;s soundtrack contains the theme song of the same name, performed by Smith, as well as the score, composed by Danny Elfman.

&quot;Men in Black&quot; premiered at Pacific&#x27;s Cinerama Dome in Hollywood on June 25, 1997, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 2. It received critical acclaim for its screenplay, humour, action sequences, and the performances and chemistry between Jones and Smith. The film was a box-office success, grossing more than $589.4 million worldwide and becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 1997 as well as the ninth-highest-grossing film of the decade. It won for Best Makeup and was also nominated for Best Art Direction and Best Original Score at the 70th Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. A sequel was released in 2002, a third film was released in 2012, and was released in 2019, with Jones and Smith absent.

==Plot==
In 1961, the Men in Black (MiB) organization is founded after secretly making first contact with extraterrestrials. Ever since, they established Earth as a politically neutral zone for alien refugees that live in secret amongst humanity, monitor and police their actions, and utilize memory-erasing neuralyzer devices to maintain secrecy.

In 1997, MiB Agents K and D interrupt a border patrol sting at the Mexico–United States border to apprehend Mikey, a disguised extraterrestrial. When he tries to attack one of the patrol officers, K shoots him and neuralyzes the officers. Feeling that he is too old to continue working and wishing to retire, D asks K to neuralyze him, who reluctantly complies. 

Sometime later, NYPD plain clothes officer James Darrell Edwards III catches an unnaturally agile criminal, who later commits suicide. While being reprimanded by his superiors, James is visited by K, who scouts him as a potential MiB recruit. Once he passes the MiB&#x27;s tests, James becomes Agent J while the MiB erase him from government records.

Meanwhile, an alien &quot;Bug&quot; crash-lands in upstate New York, kills a farmer named Edgar, and wears his skin as a disguise. Tipped off by tabloid reporting, the agents interview the farmer&#x27;s wife while the Bug fatally wounds two disguised aliens, who are presumed dead and sent to a city morgue overseen by coroner Laurel Weaver. While investigating the Bug&#x27;s activities, K and J reach the morgue, where one of the aliens tells J and Laurel that &quot;the galaxy is on Orion&#x27;s belt&quot; before dying. After neuralyzing Laurel, K identifies the alien as Rosenberg, an Arquillian prince, before taking J to question an informant named Frank. Frank reveals that Rosenberg was on Earth protecting a miniature galaxy, a precious source of subatomic energy, and that the Bug wants to use it to destroy the Arquillians. Concurrently, the MiB learn an Arquillian warship has entered Earth&#x27;s orbit, demanding the galaxy.

J and the Bug separately deduce the galaxy is attached to the collar of Rosenberg&#x27;s cat, Orion, which fell into Laurel&#x27;s care. The Bug reaches Laurel first, swallows the galaxy, and kidnaps her. As the Arquillians threaten to destroy Earth to prevent the Bug from escaping with the galaxy, the MiB lock down all transport routes while J realizes the Bug is heading for the New York State Pavilion, which the MiB used to hide two flying saucers in 1964. As Laurel escapes the Bug&#x27;s custody, he attempts to leave Earth, but K and J shoot him down. Incensed, the Bug reveals its true form and swallows the agents&#x27; weapons. After K provokes it into eating him too, J antagonizes it long enough for K to find his gun and blow the Bug in half from the inside, recovering the galaxy. The Bug tries to attack the agents, but Laurel finds J&#x27;s gun and kills it.

After returning the galaxy to the Arquillians, K confesses he was training J to succeed him so he can retire. The pair bid each other farewell before J neuralyzes K. Sometime later, K reunites with his wife while J is joined by Laurel, now Agent L.

==Cast==

* Tommy Lee Jones as Kevin Brown / Agent K: J&#x27;s grizzled and humorless mentor. The studio wanted Clint Eastwood for the part, while Jones only accepted the role after Steven Spielberg promised the script would improve, based on his respect for Spielberg&#x27;s track record. He had been disappointed with the first draft, which he reportedly said &quot;stank&quot;, feeling it did not capture the tone of the comic.
* Will Smith as James Darrell Edwards III / Agent J: A former NYPD detective, newly recruited to the MIB. Smith was cast because Barry Sonnenfeld&#x27;s wife was a fan of &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;. Sonnenfeld also liked his performance in &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot;. The studio and Spielberg preferred Chris O&#x27;Donnell for the role, fresh off his portrayal of Dick Grayson, whom he played in &quot;Batman Forever&quot; and &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, and Spielberg told Sonnenfeld to take him to dinner to convince him to do it. However, Sonnenfeld got him to not accept the role by saying that he was not a good director and that the script was one O&#x27;Donnell should skip. David Schwimmer also turned down the part, a decision he later regretted when reflecting in 2024. Like Jones, Smith said he accepted the role after meeting with Spielberg and cited his success as a producer.
* Linda Fiorentino as Dr. Laurel Weaver / Agent L: A deputy medical examiner, and later J&#x27;s partner.
* Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio as Edgar / The Bug: A farmer who is killed and eaten by a giant alien insect, which then wears his skin in order to search for the Galaxy and incite a war from the Arquillians. John Turturro and Bruce Campbell were both offered the role, but they turned it down due to scheduling conflicts.
* Rip Torn as Chief Zed: The head of the MIB.
* Tony Shalhoub as Jack Jeebs: An alien arms dealer who runs a pawn shop as a front.
* Siobhan Fallon Hogan as Beatrice: Edgar&#x27;s abused wife.
* Mike Nussbaum as Gentle Rosenberg: An Arquillian royal family member, posing as a jeweler, who is the guardian of &quot;the Galaxy&quot;.
* Jon Gries as Nick the van driver: the American smuggler who unknowingly carries a literal alien among his posse.
* Sergio Calderón as Jose
* John Alexander as Mikey: An alien who poses as a Mexican being smuggled across the border.
* Patrick Breen as Mr. Redgick
* Becky Ann Baker as Mrs. Redgick
* Carel Struycken as Arquillian
* Fredric Lehne as Agent Janus
* Kent Faulcon as 2nd Lieutenant Jake Jensen
* Richard Hamilton as Agent D: K&#x27;s former partner who retires after deciding he is too old for the job.
* Ken Thorley as Zap-Em Man, an Exterminator who is killed by Edgar the Bug 
* David Cross as Newton, Morgue Attendant 
* Sean Whalen as Passport Officer
* Verne Troyer as the Alien son
* Harsh Nayyar as News Vendor
* Bernard Gilkey as himself (New York Mets outfielder)

===Voices/Puppeteers===
* Tim Blaney as Frank the Pug: A smart-talking pug-like alien.
* Mark Setrakian as Rosenberg Alien
* Brad Abrell, Thom Fountain, Carl J. Johnson, and Drew Massey as the Worm Guys: A quartet of worm-like aliens that work for Men in Black.

==Production==
===Development===
The film is loosely based on Lowell Cunningham and Sandy Carruthers&#x27;s comic book &quot;The Men in Black&quot;. Producers Walter F. Parkes and Laurie MacDonald optioned the rights to &quot;The Men in Black&quot; in 1992, and hired Ed Solomon to write a very faithful script. Parkes and MacDonald wanted Barry Sonnenfeld as director because he had helmed the darkly humorous &quot;The Addams Family&quot; and its sequel &quot;Addams Family Values&quot;. However, Sonnenfeld was attached to &quot;Get Shorty&quot; (1995), so they instead approached Les Mayfield (best known for his remake of &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;). Mayfield was briefly attached before it fell through. John Landis and Quentin Tarantino were asked to direct but each declined. As a result, &quot;Men in Black&quot; was delayed, allowing Sonnenfeld to make it his next project after &quot;Get Shorty&quot;. David Schwimmer was offered the role of Agent K but he declined due to scheduling conflicts.

Much of the initial script drafts were set underground, with locations ranging from Kansas to Washington, D.C., and Nevada. Sonnenfeld decided to change the location to New York City, because Sonnenfeld felt New Yorkers would be tolerant of aliens who behaved oddly while disguised, terming the movie as &quot;&quot;The French Connection&quot; with aliens&quot;. He also felt much of the city&#x27;s structures resembled flying saucers and rocket ships. One of the locations Sonnenfeld thought perfect for the movie was a giant ventilation structure for the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel, which became the outside of the MIB headquarters.

===Filming===
Principal photography began in March 1996. Many last-minute changes ensued during production. First, the scene where James Edwards was chasing a disguised alien was to be filmed at Lincoln Center, but the New York Philharmonic decided to charge the filmmakers for using their buildings, prompting Sonnenfeld to film the scene at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum instead. Then, five months into the shoot, Sonnenfeld decided that the original ending, with a humorous existential debate between Agent J and the Bug, was unexciting and lacking the action that the rest of the film had. Five potential replacements were discussed. One of these had Laurel Weaver being neuralyzed and K remaining an agent. Eventually it boiled down to the Bug eating K and fighting J, replacing the animatronic Bug Rick Baker&#x27;s crew had developed with a computer-generated Bug with an appearance closer to a cockroach. The whole action sequence cost an extra $4.5 million to the filmmakers.

Further changes were made during post-production to simplify the plotline involving the possession of the tiny galaxy. The Arquillians would hand over the galaxy to the Baltians, ending a long war. The Bugs need to feed on the casualties and steal the galaxy in order to continue the war. Through changing of subtitles, the images on M.I.B.&#x27;s main computer and Frank the Pug&#x27;s dialogue, the Baltians were eliminated from the plot. Earth goes from being potentially destroyed in the crossfire between the two races into being possibly destroyed by the Arquillians themselves to prevent the Bugs from getting the galaxy. These changes to the plot were carried out when only two weeks remained in the film&#x27;s post-production, but the film&#x27;s novelization still contains the Baltians.

===Design and visual effects===
Production designer Bo Welch designed the MIB headquarters with a 1960s tone in mind, because that was when their organization was formed. He cited influences from Finnish architect Eero Saarinen, who designed a terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport. As the arrival point of aliens on Earth, Welch felt the headquarters had to resemble an airport.

Rick Baker was approached to provide the prosthetic and animatronic aliens, many of whom would have more otherworldly designs instead of looking humanoid. For example, the reveal of Gentle Rosenberg&#x27;s Arquillian nature went from a man with a light under his neck&#x27;s skin to a small alien hidden inside a human head. Baker would describe &quot;Men in Black&quot; as the most complex production in his career, &quot;requiring more sketches than all my previous movies together&quot;. Baker had to have approval from both Sonnenfeld and Spielberg: &quot;It was like, &#x27;Steven likes the head on this one and Barry really likes the body on this one, so why don&#x27;t you do a mix and match?&#x27; And I&#x27;d say, because it wouldn&#x27;t make any sense.&quot; Sonnenfeld also changed a lot of the film&#x27;s aesthetic during pre-production: &quot;I started out saying aliens shouldn&#x27;t be what humans perceive them to be. Why do they need eyes? So Rick did these great designs, and I&#x27;d say, &#x27;That&#x27;s great — but how do we know where he&#x27;s looking?&#x27; I ended up where everyone else did, only I took three months.&quot; The maquettes built by Baker&#x27;s team were later digitized by Industrial Light &amp; Magic, which was responsible for the visual effects and computer-generated imagery, for more mobile digital versions of the aliens.

==Music==

Two different soundtracks for the film were released: a score soundtrack featuring music composed by Danny Elfman and an album of songs used in and inspired by the film, featuring Will Smith&#x27;s original song &quot;Men in Black&quot; based on the film&#x27;s plot.

Elfman&#x27;s music was called &quot;rousing&quot; by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; called the film a technical marvel, giving special credit to &quot;Elfman&#x27;s always lively score.&quot; Elfman was nominated for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score at the 70th Academy Awards for his score, but lost to &quot;The Full Monty&quot;.

Elfman recalled in 2017 how he was chosen to compose the soundtrack as &quot;strange.&quot; He was on the set of &quot;The Frighteners&quot; with Peter Jackson when D&#x27;Onofrio, who was shooting &quot;Men In Black&quot; on the other set, walked in and invited both men to watch him perform the final scene. Then on the way home, Elfman got a call from his agent saying that he was hired to compose the soundtrack, even though there was no discussion about it prior.

Elvis Presley&#x27;s song &quot;Promised Land&quot; is featured in the scene where the MIB&#x27;s car runs on the ceiling of Queens–Midtown Tunnel.

==Release==

===Marketing===
In advance of the film&#x27;s theatrical release, its marketing campaign included more than 30 licensees. Galoob was the first to license, in which they released various action figures of the film&#x27;s characters and aliens. Ray-Ban also partnered the film with a $5–10 million television campaign. Other promotional items included Hamilton Watches and Procter &amp; Gamble&#x27;s Head &amp; Shoulders with the tagline &quot;Keeping the Men in Black in black&quot;.

An official comic adaptation was released by Marvel Comics. The film also received a third-person shooter &quot;Men in Black&quot; game developed by Gigawatt Studios and published by Gremlin Interactive, which was released to lackluster reviews in October 1997 for the PC and the following year for the PlayStation. Also, a very rare promotional PlayStation video game system was released in 1997 with the Men in Black logo on the CD lid. Three months after the film&#x27;s release, an animated series based on &quot;Men in Black&quot;, produced by Columbia TriStar Television alongside Adelaide Productions and Amblin Television, began airing on The WB&#x27;s Kids&#x27; WB programming block, and also inspired several games. A &quot;Men in Black&quot; role-playing game was also released in 1997 by West End Games.

===Home media===
&quot;Men in Black&quot; was first released on VHS and LaserDisc on November 25, 1997 by Columbia TriStar Home Video. The home video release was attached to a rebate offer on a pair of Ray-Ban Predator-model sunglasses. The film was re-released in a collector&#x27;s series on VHS and DVD on September 5, 2000, with the DVD containing several bonus features including an interactive editing workshop for three different scenes from the film, extended storyboards, conceptual art, and a visual commentary track with Tommy Lee Jones and director Barry Sonnenfeld; an alternate two-disc Deluxe Edition was released in 2002, adding a fullscreen version and a preview for &quot;Men In Black II&quot;. A Blu-ray edition was released on June 17, 2008. The entire &quot;Men in Black&quot; trilogy was released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on December 5, 2017, in conjunction with the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Men in Black&quot; earned $4.8 million from Tuesday night previews and went on to gross $14 million on its opening day, bringing the total gross to $18.8 million. During its opening weekend, it generated $51.1 million, making it the third-highest opening weekend of all time, behind &quot;Batman Forever&quot; and &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;. The film then grossed $84.1 million during its five-day Wednesday opening. It surpassed &quot;Independence Day&quot; for having three records. These were the biggest three-day Fourth of July opening weekend, the largest July opening weekend and the highest opening weekend for a non-sequel film. The film would hold the latter two records for three years until 2000 when &quot;X-Men&quot; took them. Two years later, its successor &quot;Men in Black II&quot; broke the record for having the highest three-day Fourth of July opening weekend. Moreover, &quot;Men in Black&quot; held the record for having the highest opening weekend for an action-packed comedy film until &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; surpassed it in 2001. It would remain in the number one spot at the box office for three weeks until it was beaten by &quot;Air Force One&quot;. The film also competed against &quot;Hercules&quot; and &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; during its theatrical run.

&quot;Men in Black&quot; grossed $250.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $338.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $589.3 million. It would hold the record for being Sony&#x27;s highest-grossing film until it was surpassed by &quot;Spider-Man&quot; five years later in 2002. The film grossed a record $10.7 million in its opening weekend in Germany, beating the record held by &quot;Independence Day&quot;.

Despite its grosses, writer Ed Solomon has said that Sony claims the film has never turned a profit, which is attributed to Hollywood accounting.

===Critical response===
On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Men in Black&quot; holds an approval rating of 91% based on 93 reviews, and an average score of 7.50/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads &quot;Thanks to a smart script, spectacular set pieces, and charismatic performances from its leads, &quot;Men in Black&quot; is an entirely satisfying summer blockbuster hit.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, praising the film as &quot;a smart, funny and hip adventure film in a summer of car wrecks and explosions.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four, giving particular praise to the film&#x27;s self-reflective humor and Rick Baker&#x27;s alien creature designs. Janet Maslin, reviewing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote the film &quot;is actually a shade more deadpan and peculiar than such across-the-board marketing makes it sound. It&#x27;s also extraordinarily ambitious, with all-star design and special-effects talent and a genuinely artful visual style. As with his &quot;Addams Family&quot; films and &quot;Get Shorty,&quot; which were more overtly funny than the sneakily subtle &quot;Men in Black,&quot; Mr. Sonnenfeld takes offbeat genre material and makes it boldly mainstream.&quot;

Writing for &quot;Variety&quot;, Todd McCarthy acknowledged the film was &quot;witty and sometimes surreal sci-fi comedy&quot; in which he praised the visual effects, Baker&#x27;s creature designs and Elfman&#x27;s musical score. However, he felt the film &quot;doesn&#x27;t manage to sustain this level of inventiveness, delight and surprise throughout the remaining two-thirds of the picture.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; graded the film a C+, writing &quot;&quot;Men in Black&quot; celebrates the triumph of attitude over everything else – plausibility, passion, any sense that what we&#x27;re watching actually matters. The aliens, for all their slimy visual zest, aren&#x27;t particularly scary or funny (they aren&#x27;t allowed to become characters), and so the joke of watching Smith and Jones crack wise in their faces quickly wears thin.&quot;

John Hartl of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, claimed the film &quot;is moderately amusing, well-constructed and mercifully short, but it fails to deliver on the zaniness of its first half.&quot; While he was complimentary of the film&#x27;s first half, he concluded &quot;somewhere around the midpoint they run out of energy and invention. Even the aliens, once they stop their shape-shifting ways and settle down to appear as themselves, begin to look familiar.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Men in Black&quot; won Best Makeup at the 70th Academy Awards and was also nominated for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score and Best Art Direction, losing the latter two to &quot;The Full Monty&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot;, respectively. The film was also nominated for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy at the 55th Golden Globe Awards, losing to &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot;.

On &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Movies of All Time, &quot;Men in Black&quot; placed 409th. Following the film&#x27;s release, Ray-Ban stated sales of their Predator 2 sunglasses (worn by the organization to deflect neuralyzers) tripled to $5 million.

==Sequels==

==Antecedents and influence in UFO conspiracy theories==
The film drew inspiration from the 1956 book &quot;They Knew Too Much About Flying Saucers&quot;, which alleged UFO witnesses were being silenced by mysterious black-clad agents. While prior conspiracy films had taken the perspective of conspiracy theorists, &quot;Men in Black&quot; took the perspective of the conspirators. The film was the first time &#x27;Men in Black&quot; appeared in a major movie, cementing the men in black in popular culture.
The film &#x27;poked fun&#x27; at government debunking, with one of the Men in Black telling a witness &quot;The flash of light you saw was not a UFO, swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket and reflected the light from Venus&quot; -- a combination of &#x27;official explanations&#x27; the Air Force has offered for UFO reports.

<text>is a Japanese musical collective founded on January 19, 1974 by Tsutomu Ōhashi, consisting of hundreds of people with different occupations.

They are known for both their re-creations of globally-known folk music, along with music combining traditional and modern elements. Some fusions include an electronic recreation of traditional Indonesian gamelan music, due to MIDI digital synthesizers not being able to handle such tuning systems. Their 1986 album, &quot;Ecophony Rinne&quot;, introduced these computer-generated sounds. The success of this album brought them to the attention of Katsuhiro Ōtomo, who commissioned them to create the soundtrack of &quot;Akira&quot;. The soundtrack is built on the concept of recurrent themes or &quot;modules&quot;. The soundtrack is a mix of digital synthesizers (Roland D-50 and Yamaha DX7-II, both of which could, by then, be tuned to the Pure-Minor, &quot;slendro&quot;, and &quot;pelog&quot; tuning scales), Indonesian bamboo percussion (jegog, etc.), traditional Japanese theatrical and spiritual music (Noh), European classical, and progressive rock.

The group&#x27;s name uses Ōhashi&#x27;s pseudonym, Shoji Yamashiro, and translates roughly to &quot;Yamashiro Performing Arts Collective&quot;. Ōhashi took his inspiration from a postwar 1950s group of similar characters that lived as a commune.

<doc id="167608" wikidata="Q158143" url="?curid=167608" title="Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha">
<text>Alfred (Alfred Ernest Albert; 6 August 184430 July 1900) was sovereign Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha from 22 August 1893 until his death in 1900. He was the second son and fourth child of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. He was known as the Duke of Edinburgh from 1866 until he succeeded his paternal uncle Ernest II as the reigning Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in the German Empire.

==Early life==
Prince Alfred was born on 6 August 1844 at Windsor Castle to the reigning British monarch, Queen Victoria, and her husband, Prince Albert, the second son of Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Nicknamed Affie, he was second in the line of succession to the British throne behind his elder brother, Albert Edward, Prince of Wales.

Alfred was baptised by the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Howley, at the Private Chapel in Windsor Castle on 6 September 1844. His godparents were his mother&#x27;s first cousin, Prince George of Cambridge (represented by his father, the Duke of Cambridge); his paternal aunt, the Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (represented by Alfred&#x27;s maternal grandmother, the Duchess of Kent); and his maternal uncle, the Prince of Leiningen (represented by the Duke of Wellington, Conservative Leader in the Lords).

Alfred remained second in line to the British throne from his birth until January 1864, when his older brother Albert Edward and sister-in-law Alexandra had their first child, Prince Albert Victor. Alfred became third in line to the throne and, as Albert Edward and Alexandra continued to have children, Alfred was further demoted in the order of succession.

==Entering the Royal Navy==

In 1856, when he reached age 12, it was decided that Prince Alfred, in accordance with his own wishes, should enter the Royal Navy. A separate establishment was assigned to him, with Lieutenant J.C. Cowell, RE, as governor. He passed a special entrance examination in July 1858, and was appointed as a naval cadet in at the age of 14. 

In July 1860, while on this ship, Alfred paid an official visit to the Cape Colony, and made a very favourable impression both on the colonials and on the native chiefs. He took part in a hunt at Hartebeeste-Hoek, resulting in the slaughter of large numbers of game animals. 

Following the expulsion of King Otto of Greece in 1862, Prince Alfred was chosen to succeed him, but the British government blocked plans for him to ascend the Greek throne, largely because of the Queen&#x27;s opposition to the idea. She and her late husband had made plans for him to succeed to the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg.

Prince Alfred remained in the navy, and was promoted to lieutenant on 24 February 1863, serving under his half-cousin Count Gleichen on the corvette . Gleichen&#x27;s son recalled his father as saying that &quot;the Prince, although shaping well as a sailor, was of a somewhat wayward disposition at that period, and his high spirits more than once led him into minor troubles with the authorities.&quot; He was promoted to captain on 23 February 1866 and was appointed to the command of the frigate in January 1867. Lord Charles Beresford described him as having &quot;a great natural ability for handling a fleet&quot; and noted that he &quot;would have made a first-class fighting admiral.&quot;

==Duke of Edinburgh==

In the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours on 24 May 1866, Alfred was created Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Ulster, and Earl of Kent with an annuity of £15,000 granted by Parliament. He took his seat in the House of Lords on 8 June.

While still in command of the &quot;Galatea&quot;, the Duke of Edinburgh started from Plymouth on 24 January 1867 for his voyage around the world. On 7 June 1867, he left Gibraltar, reached the Cape of Good Hope on 24 July, on 5 August 1867 the island of Tristan da Cunha, and paid a royal visit to Cape Town on 24 August 1867 after landing at Simon&#x27;s Town a while earlier. He landed at Glenelg, South Australia, on 31 October 1867. 

Being the first member of the royal family to visit Australia, Alfred was received with great enthusiasm. During his stay of nearly five months he visited Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Tasmania. Several institutions, including Prince Alfred College, The Alfred Hospital, and Royal Prince Alfred Hospital were named in his honour.

On 12 March 1868, on his second visit to Sydney, Alfred was invited by Sir William Manning, President of the Sydney Sailors&#x27; Home, to picnic at the beachfront suburb of Clontarf to raise funds for the home. At the function, he was wounded in the back by a revolver fired by Henry James O&#x27;Farrell. The shot, fired at point-blank range, ricocheted off one of the metal clips on Alfred&#x27;s trouser braces, narrowly missing his spine. He was tended to for the next two weeks by six nurses, trained by Florence Nightingale and led by Matron Lucy Osburn, who had just arrived in Australia in February 1868.

In the violent struggle during which Alfred was shot, William Vial had managed to wrest the gun away from O&#x27;Farrell until bystanders assisted. Vial, a master of a Masonic Lodge, had helped to organise the picnic in honour of the Duke&#x27;s visit and was presented with a gold watch for securing Alfred&#x27;s life. Another bystander, George Thorne, was wounded in the foot by O&#x27;Farrell&#x27;s second shot. O&#x27;Farrell was arrested at the scene, quickly tried, convicted and hanged on 21 April 1868.
On the evening of 23 March 1868, the most influential people of Sydney voted for a memorial building to be erected, &quot;to raise a permanent and substantial monument in testimony of the heartfelt gratitude of the community at the recovery of HRH&quot;. This led to a public subscription which paid for the construction of Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.

Alfred soon recovered from his injury and was able to resume command of his ship and return home in early April 1868. He reached Spithead on 26 June 1868, after an absence of seventeen months.

Alfred visited Hawaii in 1869 and spent time with the royal family there, where he was presented with leis upon his arrival. He was also the first member of the royal family to visit New Zealand, arriving in 1869 on , where he spent a month living in Pakuranga. He also became the first European prince to visit Japan and on 4 September 1869, he was received at an audience by the teenaged Emperor Meiji in Tokyo.

The Duke&#x27;s next voyage was to India, where he arrived in December 1869, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), which he visited the following year. In both countries and at Hong Kong, which he visited on the way, he was the first British prince to set foot in the country. The native rulers of India vied with one another in the magnificence of their entertainments during the stay of three months. In Ceylon a reception was given for him, by the request of the British, by Charles Henry de Soysa, the richest man in Ceylon, at his private residence which was consequently renamed, by permission, Alfred House. Alfred reportedly ate off gold plates with gold cutlery inlaid with jewels.

==Potential matches==
In 1862, Queen Victoria wrote to Victoria, Princess Royal, that she wanted Alfred to marry Princess Dagmar of Denmark. She wrote: &quot;I hear that the Emperor of Russia has not given up his intention of asking for Alix or Dagmar for his son. I should be very sorry if any thing were decided for Dagmar before you had seen her, as it would be one chance less for Affie.&quot; However, she decided against the match because of Germany&#x27;s anger towards Denmark over the disputed territories of Schleswig-Holstein, especially since Alfred was the heir to Coburg. She wrote to Princess Victoria: &quot;Respecting Dagmar, I do not wish her to be kept for Affie. Let the Emperor have her.&quot; 

Dagmar was initially engaged to Tsarevich Nicholas; however, he died on 22 April 1865 in the presence of his parents, brothers, and Dagmar. His last wish was that Dagmar would marry his younger brother, the future Alexander III. Alexander and Dagmar did marry; therefore, she became Empress of Russia.

The Queen considered Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia as a potential wife for Alfred. She wrote to Princess Victoria, &quot;It is a great pity that Sanny&#x27;s charming daughter is a Greek [Orthodox]– she would do so well&quot;. In 1867, Queen Victoria told Victoria, Princess Royal that &quot;I had thought and hoped at one time for dear little Olga, who is now to marry King George&quot;.

==Marriage==
During a visit to his sister Alice in August 1868, Alfred met Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, then fourteen years old. Princess Alice was married to Maria Alexandrovna&#x27;s first cousin. The Grand Duchess was visiting her maternal relatives, the Princes of Battenberg, at Jugenheim.

On 23 January 1874, the Duke of Edinburgh married Maria Alexandrovna, the second (and only surviving) daughter of Emperor Alexander II of Russia and his first wife Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine, daughter of Louis II, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine and Princess Wilhelmine of Baden, at the Winter Palace, St Petersburg. To commemorate the occasion, the English bakery Peek Freans made the now internationally popular Marie biscuit, with the Duchess&#x27; name imprinted on its top.

The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh made their public entry into London on 12 March. The marriage, however, was not a happy one, and the bride was thought haughty by London Society. She was surprised to discover that she had to yield precedence to the Princess of Wales and all of Queen Victoria&#x27;s daughters and demanded that she take precedence before the Princess of Wales (the future Queen Alexandra) because she considered the Princess of Wales&#x27;s family (the Danish royal family) to be inferior to her own. Queen Victoria refused this demand, yet granted her precedence immediately after the Princess of Wales. Her father gave her the then-staggering sum of £100,000 as a dowry, plus an annual allowance of £32,000.

==Flag rank==
Alfred was stationed in Malta for several years and his third child, Victoria Melita, was born there in 1876. Alfred&#x27;s last command prior to promotion to flag rank would be as captain of in 1878, when he represented the Crown during the installation of John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, as Governor General of Canada. Alfred was subsequently promoted rear-admiral upon his return to London and relief on 30 December 1878, becoming admiral superintendent of naval reserves, raising his flag aboard the corvette in November 1879. Promoted to vice-admiral on 10 November 1882, he was given command of the Channel Squadron, with his flag aboard the armoured ship , in December 1883. He became Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet, with his flag aboard the armoured ship , in March 1886, and having been promoted to admiral on 18 October 1887, he went on to be Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth in August 1890. He was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 3 June 1893.

Percy Scott wrote in his memoirs that &quot;as a Commander-in-Chief, the Duke of Edinburgh had, in my humble opinion, no equal. He handled a fleet magnificently, and introduced many improvement in signals and manoeuvring.&quot; He &quot;took a great interest in gunnery.&quot; &quot;The prettiest ship I have ever seen was the [Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s flagship] HMS &quot;Alexandra&quot;. I was informed that £2,000 had been spent by the officers on her decoration.&quot;

Alfred was very fond of music and took a prominent part in establishing the Royal College of Music, created in 1882. He was a keen violinist, but had little skill. At a dinner party given by one of his brothers, he was persuaded to play. Sir Henry Ponsonby wrote: &#x27;Fiddle out of tune and noise abominable.&#x27;

==Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha==
On the death of his uncle, Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, on 22 August 1893, the duchy fell to the Duke of Edinburgh since his elder brother, the Prince of Wales, had renounced his right to the succession before he married. Alfred thereupon surrendered his British allowance of £15,000 a year and his seats in the House of Lords and the Privy Council, but he retained the £10,000 granted on his marriage to maintain Clarence House as his London residence. At first regarded with some coldness in the Duchy as a &quot;foreigner&quot;, he gradually gained popularity. By the time of his death in 1900, he had generally won the good opinion of his subjects.

Alfred and Maria&#x27;s only son, Alfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, became involved in a scandal involving his mistress and apparently shot himself in January 1899, in the midst of his parents&#x27; twenty-fifth wedding anniversary celebrations at the &quot;Schloss Friedenstein&quot; in Gotha. He survived, and his embarrassed mother sent him off to Meran to recover. However, he died there two weeks later, on 6 February. His father was devastated.

==Death==
Alfred died of throat cancer on 30 July 1900 in a lodge adjacent to Schloss Rosenau, the ducal summer residence just north of Coburg. He was buried at the ducal family&#x27;s mausoleum in the &quot;&quot; in Coburg. As his younger brother, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn and nephew Prince Arthur, had renounced their succession rights to the ducal throne, Alfred was succeeded by his nephew, Prince Charles Edward, Duke of Albany (1884–1954), the posthumous son of his youngest brother, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany.

He was survived by his mother, Victoria, who had already outlived two of her children, Alice and Leopold. She died six months later. Victoria dedicated a memorial in the form of a Celtic cross to Alfred in the grounds of Balmoral Castle which was erected shortly before her death.

Alfred was a keen collector of glass and ceramic ware, and after his death his widow gave his collection, valued at half a million marks, to the Veste Coburg, the enormous fortress on a hill top above Coburg.

==Legacy==
===Australia===
Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, The Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, Prince Alfred College in Adelaide, Prince Alfred Park in Sydney, Prince Alfred Square in Parramatta, and the Royal Prince Alfred Yacht Club, now in the Sydney suburb of Newport, are named in his honour.

The Alfred Hall in Ballarat was built in 1867 for his visit, and one of the city&#x27;s suburbs was renamed Alfredton. Many streets, avenues, roads, halls, parks and schools bear his name in other parts of Australia. He laid the corner stones of new town halls in the two biggest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, and those buildings continue in use today.

===Barbados===
Prince Alfred Street in Bridgetown, the capital of Barbados, was named in his honour. It begins at the junction with Chapel Street and proceeds southward until reaching a car park along the Constitution river in the vicinity of the former James Fort.

===Canada===
Prince Alfred Bay, Nunavut, was named in his honour, as was Cape Prince Alfred in the North West Territories. Two islands in Ontario are named for Prince Alfred, one in the St Lawrence River near Brockville, and the other in Lake Nipigon north of Thunder Bay. The Prince Alfred Arch, a monument in Tangier, Nova Scotia, marks the spot Prince Alfred visited in 1861.

=== New Zealand ===
The name of the small township of Alfredton (near Eketāhuna in the lower North Island of New Zealand) honours the Prince. Alfred Street in central Auckland was named in his honour. The Bay of Plenty settlement of Galatea is named after his ship. Mt Alfred in Wellington - adjacent to Mount Victoria named after his mother and Mt Albert after his father - is named after him.

===South Africa===
Prince Alfred sailed into Port Elizabeth on 6 August 1860 as a midshipman on HMS &quot;Euryalus&quot; and celebrated his 16th birthday among its citizens. Seven years later he sailed into Simon&#x27;s Town as the Captain of HMS &quot;Galatea&quot;. In Port Elizabeth there is a Prince Alfred&#x27;s Terrace. The Alfred Rowing Club was established in 1864 and was housed under the pier at Table Bay. It was named after Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, who visited the Cape in 1860. It is the oldest organised sporting club in South Africa. The opening ceremony of the South African Library was performed by Prince Alfred in 1860. An impressive portrait of the Prince hangs in the main reading room.
Port Alfred, on the Kowie River in the Eastern Cape, was originally known as Port Frances after the daughter-in-law of the Governor of Cape Colony, Lord Charles Somerset. Of all the passes built in South Africa by the famous Andrew Geddes Bain and his son, Thomas, Prince Alfred&#x27;s Pass remains, for many people, a favourite because of its lavish variety winding through some of the world&#x27;s most unspoiled scenery.

In Simon&#x27;s Town, the Prince Alfred Hotel was built in 1802 and renamed after the prince visited Cape Province in 1868. For more than two centuries Simon&#x27;s Town has been an important naval base and harbour (first for the Royal Navy and now the South African Navy). The former hotel now houses the Backpackers&#x27; Hostel, opposite the harbour in the main street. In Cape Town during his visit in 1868, Prince Alfred ceremonially tipped the first load of rock to commence the building of the Breakwater. This was built by convict labour and formed the protective seawall for the new Cape Town Harbour, now redeveloped as the Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront and a popular tourist and shopping destination.

A Prince Alfred Street can be found in Pietermaritzburg, Queenstown, Grahamstown and Caledon. The Port Elizabeth Chapter of the Memorable Order of Tin Hats, a veterans association, is known as the Prince Alfred Shellhole. Prince Alfred Hamlet, a small town in the Western Cape province, is named after Alfred.

===United Kingdom===
One of the stamp collectors in the British royal family, Prince Alfred won election as honorary president of The Philatelic Society, London in 1890. He may have inspired his nephew George V, who benefited after the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) bought his brother Prince Alfred&#x27;s collection. The merging of Alfred&#x27;s and George&#x27;s collections gave birth to the Royal Philatelic Collection.

Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, the settlement on Tristan da Cunha, a British Overseas territory, was named after Alfred after he visited the remote islands in 1867 while Duke of Edinburgh.

&quot;Manta alfredi&quot; is commonly known as Prince Alfred&#x27;s manta ray.

<text>Rail transport in India consists of primarily of passenger and freight shipments along an integrated rail network. Indian Railways (IR), a statutory body under the ownership of the Ministry of Railways of the Government of India, operates India&#x27;s national railway system. It is the primary owner and operator of rail operations throughout the country including suburban rail in major metros.

Majority of the metro urban rail networks are operated by independent bodies constituted for the purpose of the respective operations. Private owned rails exist in few places, mostly used to connect freight to the integrated rail network. Inter-city rail services are operated primarily by Indian Railways though efforts have been made to introduce privately operated trains as recently as 2022.

The national rail network comprised total route length of , with more than of track and 8,000+ stations and is the fourth-largest in the world. It is one of the busiest networks in the world, transporting more than 11 billion passengers and 1.416 billion tonnes of freight annually. As of August 2024, more than of all the routes have been electrified with 25 KV AC electric traction. The rolling stock consisted of 318,196 freight wagons, 84,863 passenger coaches, 14,781 locomotives and other multiple units owned by Indian Railways apart from rail-sets operated by metro rail corporations.

Studies by economic historians have identified substantially beneficial economic effects from the Indian railway network.

==History==
=== 1832–1852: Industrial railways ===
In 1832, the proposal to construct the first railway line in India at Madras was made. In 1835, a railway track was constructed between Red Hills and Chintadripet in Madras and became operational in 1837. It was hauled by a rotary steam engine imported from England and was used for ferrying granite.

The Madras Railway was established in 1845. Temporary railway lines were built such as the Godavari Dam Construction Railway at Dowleswaram by Arthur Cotton to supply stone for the construction of a dam over the Godavari River in 1845 and the Solani aqueduct railway, built by Proby Cautley in Roorkee to transport construction materials for an aqueduct over the Solani river in 1851. On 1 August 1849, the Great Indian Peninsular Railway was incorporated with a guarantee system providing free land and guaranteeing five-percent rates of return to private English companies building railways. In 1852, a steam locomotive imported from England was tried at Byculla.

=== 1853–1924: Passenger railways and expansion ===

In 1853, the first passenger train on broad gauge ran for between Bombay and Thane which had 14-carriages carrying 400 people, hauled by three steam locomotives: the Sahib, Sindh and Sultan. The Great Southern of India Railway Company was established with its headquarters in England in 1853. The Thane viaducts, the first railway bridges, were built over the Thane creek when the Mumbai-Thane line was extended to Kalyan in May 1854. Eastern India&#x27;s first passenger train ran from Howrah, near Kolkata, to Hoogly on 15 August 1854. The construction of line in the South between Royapuram in Madras and Arcot started in 1853, which became operational on 1 July 1856. The first workshops were established by GIPR at Byculla in 1854 and Madras Railway at Perambur in 1856. The Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway (BB&amp;CI) was incorporated in 1855 and Eastern Bengal Railway in 1858. The Carnatic Railway was founded in 1869. On 24 February 1873, a horse-drawn tram opened in Calcutta between Sealdah and Armenian Ghat street. On 9 May 1874, a horse-drawn tramway began operation in Bombay between Colaba and Parel. The Great Southern of India Railway and the Carnatic Railway merged in 1874 to form the South Indian Railway. In 1879, the Nizam&#x27;s Guaranteed State Railway was established which built railway lines across the then Hyderabad State. In 1877, an Ajmer built F-1/734 Steam Locomotive became the first indigenously built locomotive in India. East Coast State Railway was established in 1890. In 1897, lighting in passenger coaches was introduced with Jodhpur Railway, the first to introduce electric lighting as standard fixtures. In 1908, Madras Railway merged with Southern Mahratta Railway to form the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway. Pamban bridge, the first sea bridge was opened on 24 February 1914. 
In 1920, electric lighting of signals was introduced between Dadar and Currey Road in Bombay.

=== 1925–1949: Electrification and further expansion ===

The first railway budget was presented in 1924. The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway was merged with the East Indian Railway Company (EIR) in the same year. On 3 February 1925, the first electric train ran between Victoria Terminus (VT) and Kurla, hauled by a SLM electric locomotive on 1500 V DC traction. Later, the VT–Bandra section was electrified and the first Electric Multiple Units (EMU) were introduced in with 1.5KV DC units imported were from Cammell Laird and Uerdingenwagonfabrik. On 1 April 1929, Grand Trunk Express commenced operations between Peshawar in the North Western Railway and Mangalore with two coaches detached and connected to Madras further. The Frontier Mail made its inaugural run between Bombay and Peshawar in 1928. Technical advancements led to automatic colour light signals that become operational between Bombay and Byculla in 1928. In the subsequent years, the route from Bombay to Poona was electrified and in June 1930, the first deluxe train, Deccan Queen began running, hauled by a WCP-1 locomotives with seven coaches along the route. The Grand Trunk express commenced operating as a dedicated daily train between Madras and Delhi from 1 September 1930. Chennai suburban railway started operating in 1931 with a single metre gauge line from Chennai Beach to Tambaram. In 1944, all the railway companies were taken over by the Government.

==== Indian Railway Classification ====
Beginning 1926 and for statistical purposes, the Government of British Raj classified Indian railway systems according to three classes. It was a similar system to the Railroad classes in North America.

Trams, industrial and port railways were recorded separately and independently of turnover.
In terms of net revenue, East Indian Railway was the largest company in 1927 with 86,881,000 rupees. Followed by the North Western State Railway with 57,343,000 rupees and the Great Indian Peninsula Railway with 56,215,000 rupees. No further reclassification was carried out after 1942, but the rankings remained in use until the mid-1950s.

=== 1950–1983: Zonal re-organisation and further developments ===
The first locomotive manufacturing unit at Chittaranjan was commissioned in 1950. In December 1950, the Central Advisory Committee for Railways approved the plan for re-organising Indian Railways into six regional zones with the Southern (14 April 1951), Central (5 November 1951), and Western (5 November 1951) zones being the first to be created. On 14 April 1952, the Northern Railway, the Eastern Railway and the North Eastern Railway were created. In 1952, fans and lights were mandated for all compartments in passenger trains and sleeping accommodations were introduced in coaches. In 1953, the Indian Railways completed hundred years of operation which was commemorated by multiple events and a commemorative postage stamp. The first diesel locomotive used in India was fabricated by North British Locomotive Company in 1954. On 1 August 1955 the South-Eastern Railway was split from the Eastern Railway, and, the following year, divisional systems of administration were set up for the various regional zones. The first rail coaches were manufactured in India from 1956 when the Integral Coach Factory was established at Madras. In 1956, the first air-conditioned train plied between Howrah and New Delhi. In 1958, the North-Eastern Railway split to form a new Northeast Frontier Railway.

In 1957, Indian Railways adopted 25 kV AC traction with the first trial runs operating with the WAM-1 locomotives in 1959 and commercial services beginning in August 1960. In 1960, the Railway Board of India commissioned a study to increase the speed of passenger trains to with an intermediate stage of . Research Design and Standards Organisation (RDSO) started work on the same in 1962 with field trials commencing in 1967 with coaches manufactured by the Integral Coach Factory at Madras and hauled by diesel locomotives. The first containerized freight rail transport began between Bombay and Ahmedabad in 1966. In 1966, electrification of several suburban tracks around Delhi, Madras and Calcutta were completed with the 25 kV AC system. In 1969, the Government of India announced the introduction of a new express train capable of reaching speeds of up to in the railway budget and the first Rajdhani Express was flagged off from New Delhi to Howrah in March 1969. In 1974, Indian Railways endured a 20-day strike. In 1979, the Main Line Electrification Project was reconstituted into the Central Organisation for Railway Electrification (CORE). In 1980, the WAP-1 electric locomotives reached a speed of .

=== 1984–present: Rapid transit and later developments ===

The first metro rail was introduced in Calcutta on 24 October 1984 with the line between Esplanade and Bhowanipore. In 1986, computerized ticketing and reservations were introduced by Indian Railways. In 1988, the first Shatabdi Express was introduced between New Delhi and Jhansi. Two years later, the first self-printing ticket machine (SPTM) was introduced in Delhi. In 1993, air-conditioned three-tier and sleeper were introduced. In 1995, Chennai MRTS became the first operational elevated railway line in India. In 1995, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, a joint venture between Government of India and Government of Delhi was established. Centralized computer reservation system was deployed in Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai in September 1996, coupon validating machines (CVMs) were introduced at Mumbai CSMT in 1998 and the nationwide concierge system began operation on 18 April 1999. In 1999, the South East Central Railway zone was established and on 6 July 2002, the East Coast, South Western, South East Central, North Central, and West Central zones were created.

The Indian Railways website went online in February 2000. Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) was incorporated in 1999 and online ticketing was introduced on 3 August 2002 through IRCTC. The first line of the Delhi Metro was inaugurated on 24 December 2002. In 2012, Western Railway switched completely to AC traction with Central Railway following it in 2016. On 1 February 2014, Mumbai Monorail became the first operational monorail system in India. In 2015, the first Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) powered trains were rolled out. On 5 April 2016, Gatimaan Express, then India&#x27;s fastest train with a maximum speed of , made its first run from New Delhi to Agra Cantonment.

The central government approved the merger of the Rail and General budgets from 2017. On 31 March 2017, Indian Railways announced a target of electrifying the entire rail network would be electrified by 2023. In March 2020, Indian Railways announced a nationwide shutdown of passenger service to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in India with the freight operations continuing to transport essential goods. The railways resumed passenger services in a phased manner in May 2020.
Starting in the 2010s, various infrastructure modernization projects have been undertaken including high-speed rail, redevelopment of 400 stations, doubling tracks to reduce congestion, refurbishing of coaches, Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled tracking of trains and modernization of locomotives. In 2018, a semi-high speed self-propelled train-set capable of reaching speeds of over was rolled out from ICF and the Vande Bharat Express was launched in 2019. Indian Railways announced plans to become a net-zero carbon emission railway by 2030 and has implemented rainwater harvesting at stations, reforestation along the tracks, introduction of solar-powered trains, installation of solar and wind power generation facilities, and sustainable LED lighting at all the stations. Indian railways removed all unstaffed level crossings by 2019 with staffed level crossings being replaced by bridges. Other safety projects include the extension of an automated fire alarm system to all air-conditioned coaches and GPS-enabled Fog Pilot Assistance System railway signalling devices. In 2020, Indian Railways allowed the operation of private passenger trains for the first time with the first train flagged off from Coimbatore in June 2022.

=== Route length ===

== Freight trains ==
=== Rolling stock ===

Indian Railways hauls variety of cargo to cater to various requirements and have specialized rolling stock corresponding to the cargo hauled. There are 243 types of rolling stock used for cargo operations. These include covered wagons, boxcars, flat wagons, flatbeds, open wagons, hoppers, containers, automobile carriers, defense vehicle carriers and tankers. The freight cars can often carry loads from 10 to 80 tonnes per car depending on the configuration. A new wagon numbering system was adopted in Indian Railways in 2003.
The requirement of wagons was previously met by Bharat wagon and engineering with the procurement and manufacturing now done by both in public and private sector. The earliest goods trains in the 1800s were hauled by imported steam locomotives. Locomotives are classified by various parameters including function (passenger/goods/mixed). Indian Railways uses dedicated electric locomotives such as WAG series (Wide AC Goods), dedicated diesel locomotives such as WDG series and diesel locomotives of mixed usage such as WDM series to haul freight trains.
=== Network and infrastructure ===
Indian railways operates a broad gauge network which is equipped with long-welded, high-tensile 52kg/60kg 90 UTS rails with pre-stressed concrete (PSC) sleepers and elastic fastenings. These tracks are shared by both freight and passenger trains with passenger trains often priortized on the network. The Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India (DFCCI) was established in 2006 to construct dedicated freight corridors to reduce congestion, increase speed and reliability and proposed upgradation of existing goods sheds, attracting private capital to build dedicated logistics terminals.

=== Services ===

The first rail operational in Madras in 1837 was used for ferrying granite. The first dedicated commercial freight rail was operated between Bombay and Ahmedabad in 1966. Indian Railways ferries various commodities and cargo to cater to various industrial, consumer, and agricultural segments. Apart from dedicated freight trains, parcels, mail and small cargo are carried on specialized carriages attached to passenger trains. In 2022–23, Indian Railways operated 8,479 trains on average daily and transported 1418.1 million tonnes of freight. Indian Railways has historically subsidized the passenger segment with income from the freight business and hence, freight services were unable to complete other modes of transport on both cost and speed of delivery, leading to continuous erosion of market share till the early 2000s. To counter this, Indian Railways aimed to increase speed and reliability through various means including operating time-tabled freight trains and tweaking with the freight pricing/product mix. End-to-end integrated transport solutions such as roll-on, roll-off (RORO) service, a road-rail system pioneered by Konkan Railway in 1999 to carry trucks on flatbed trailers has been extended to other routes.

== Express and passenger trains ==
=== Rolling stock ===
The early rail coaches were based on a prototype by a Swiss company and were termed as ICF coaches after Integral coach factory (ICF), the first coach manufacturing unit in India. 
These coaches, manufactured from 1955 to 2018, were largely in use till the early 2010s. From the late 1990s, the ICF coaches were replaced by safer and newer LHB coaches designed by Linke-Hofmann-Busch of Germany. In the late 2010s, Indian railways started upgrading the coaches of select trains from LHB to new Tejas coaches with enhanced features. As of March 2023, Indian Railways&#x27; had 84,863 passenger coaches. Coaches are manufactured by five manufacturing units of the Indian Railways and public sector companies BEML and BHEL. The coaching stock have unique five or six digit identifiers. Till 2018, the first two digits indicating the year of manufacture and the last three digits indicating the class. In 2018, the numbering system was changed with the first two digits indicating the year of manufacture and the last four digits indicating the sequence number.

=== Network and infrastructure ===

;Track

As of 31 March 2023, Indian railway network spanned in route length. Track sections are rated for speeds ranging from , though the maximum speed attained by passenger trains is . Spanning broad gauge is the most used gauge with and narrow gauge and narrower gauge tracks limited to certain routes. Indian Railways uses a range of signalling technologies and methods to manage its train operations based on traffic density and safety requirements. It primarily uses coloured signal lights, which replaced the earlier semaphores and disc-based signalling.

;Stations

As of March 2023, Indian Railways manages and operates 7,308 stations. Prior to 2017, the stations were classified into seven categories based on their earnings. Since 2017, Indian Railways categorizes the stations by commercial importance into three different categories namely Non Suburban Group (NSG), Suburban Group (SG) and Halt Group (HG). These are further subdivided into subcategories based on their commercial importance (NSG 1–6, SG 1-3 and from HG 1–3). The commercial importance of a station is determined by taking into account its passenger footfall, earnings and strategic importance and these categories are used to determine the minimum essential amenities required by each station.

=== Services ===
;Travel classes

Indian Railways offers various travel classes on its coaches. For the purpose of identification in passenger trains, coaches in a train-set are assigned an alpha-numeric code. The first letter identifies the coach class and the second letter identifies the coach number. The berths and seats are numbered by an alphanumeric code with the letter(s) identifying the berth/seat type and numbers identifying the position. In standard coaches, the berths and seats are classified as follows:
Saloon coaches are also available for chartering which are equipped with a bedroom and kitchen and can be attached to normal trains.

;Trains
Indian Railways operates various classes of passenger and express trains. The trains are classified basis average speed and facilities with express trains having fewer halts, priority on rail network and faster average speed. The trains are identified by five digit numbers with train-pairs traveling in opposite directions usually labelled with consecutive numbers. Express trains often have specific unique names for easy identification. In 2018–19, Indian Railways operated 13,523 passenger trains on average daily and carried 8.44 billion passengers. India Railways operates various categories of express trains including Rajdhani Express, Shatabdi Express, Garib Rath Express, Double Decker Express, Tejas Express, Gatimaan Express, Humsafar Express, Duronto Express, Yuva Express, Uday Express, Jan Shatabdi Express, Sampark Kranti Express, Vivek Express, Rajya Rani Express, Mahamana Express, Antyodaya Express, Jan Sadharan Express, Suvidha Express and Intercity Express.

==== Ticketing and fares ====

In 1986, computerized ticketing and reservations were introduced before which ticketing was done manually. Self-printing ticket machines (SPTM) were introduced in 1988. Centralized computer reservation system was deployed in September 1996. The ticketing network at stations is computerized with the exception of few stations. The Indian Railways website went online in February 2000 and online ticketing was introduced on 3 August 2002 through IRCTC. Indian Railways now provides multiple channels for passengers to book tickets through website, smartphone apps, SMS, rail reservation counters at train stations, or through private ticket booking counters. Reserved tickets may be booked up to 120 days in advance and confirmed reservation tickets will show the passenger and fare details along with berth or seat number(s) allocated to them on the ticket.

In case of no confirmed reservation, a wait-list number is assigned and wait-listed tickets get confirmed if there are cancellations of already reserved tickets. Reservation against cancellation tickets is an intermediate category between the waiting and confirmed lists in sleeper classes which allows a ticket holder to board the train and share a berth. Reserved tickets can be booked by passengers who want to travel at short notice at higher fares through the Tatkal train ticket, where no refund is applicable on cancellation. A valid proof for the purchase of ticket along with photo identification is required to board the train. Unreserved tickets for short distance or unplanned travels may be purchased at stations or through UTS mobile app at any time before departure. Holders of such tickets may only board the general or unreserved coaches. India has some of the lowest train fares in the world, and lower class passenger fares are subsidised. Discounted fares are applicable for railway employees, senior citizens (over age 60), the differently-abled, students, athletes, patients and those taking competitive examinations. Seats of lower class of accommodation are reserved for women or senior citizens in some trains.

== Higher-speed rail ==

=== Rolling stock ===
In 1980, the WAP-1 electric locomotives reached a speed of . WAP-5 class locomotives, initially imported from ABB in 1995 and later manufactured at Chittaranjan Locomotive Works in India, reached in trials. The locomotive later set an Indian speed record by hauling a train between Delhi and Agra at a speed of in 2014. In 2018, a modified WAP-5A locomotive reached speeds of in trials. In 2018, Integral Coach Factory in Chennai, rolled out a semi-high-speed EMU train-set, capable of reaching . These trains have eight or sixteen coaches with driver cabins on both ends, which eliminates the time needed for turnaround at the terminal station with faster acceleration and deceleration, enabling the train to travel at a top speed for longer distance. For high-speed rail, the Indian railways will construct bullet train assembly facilities on a public-private participation (PPP) model with Japanese companies setting up manufacturing facilities in India to build the parts for bullet train sets.

=== Network and infrastructure ===

In 2009, Indian Railways envisioned a plan to increase the speed of passenger trains to on dedicated conventional tracks and improve the existing conventional lines on Broad gauge to handle speeds of up to . On 25 July 2013, Government of India established the High Speed Rail Corporation under Rail Vikas Nigam (RVNL) for the implementation of high-speed rail corridor projects. In 2014, the Diamond Quadrilateral high-speed rail network project was launched by Government of India and is envisioned to connect the four major metro cities of India namely: Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai. , India does not have any operational high-speed tracks with the segment of track in the Tughlakabad Agra Cantonment section supporting semi-high speeds of up to . By 2026, Ministry of Railways envisaged to have top speeds of with trains running on elevated corridors to isolate high-speed train tracks to prevent trespassing. Multiple feasibility studies have been done and probable routes have been identified. In 2017, a standard gauge line between Mumbai and Ahmedabad was approved for construction and is expected to be operational by 2028. RapidX system operating on Standard gauge tracks with Namo Bharat train-sets capable of supporting speeds of up to , became operational with the partial opening of Delhi–Meerut line in 2023.

<text>A mailing list is a collection of names and addresses used by an individual or an organization to send material to multiple recipients. The term is often extended to include the people subscribed to such a list, so the group of subscribers is referred to as &quot;the mailing list&quot;, or simply &quot;the list&quot;.

==Types==
At least two types of mailing lists can be defined: 
* an &quot;announcement list&quot; is closer to the original sense, where a &quot;mailing list&quot; of people was used as a recipient for newsletters, periodicals or advertising. Traditionally this was done through the postal system, but with the rise of email, the electronic mailing list became popular. This type of list is used primarily as a one-way conduit of information and may only be &quot;posted to&quot; by selected people. This may also be referred to by the term &quot;newsletter&quot;. Newsletter and promotional emailing lists are employed in various sectors as parts of direct marketing campaigns.
* a &quot;discussion list&quot; allows subscribing members (sometimes even people outside the list) to post their own items which are broadcast to all of the other mailing list members. Recipients may answer in a similar fashion, thus, actual discussion and information exchanges can occur. Mailing lists of this type are usually topic-oriented (for example, politics, scientific discussion, health problems, joke contests), and the topic may range from extremely narrow to &quot;whatever you think could interest us.&quot; In this they are similar to Usenet newsgroups, another form of discussion group that may have an aversion to off-topic messages.

Historically mailing lists preceded email/web forums; both can provide analogous functionalities. When used in that fashion, mailing lists are sometimes known as &quot;discussion lists&quot; or &quot;discussion forums&quot;. Discussion lists provide some advantages over typical web forums, so they are still used in various projects, notably Git and Debian. The advantages over web forums include the ability to work offline, the ability to sign/encrypt posts via GPG, and the ability to use an e-mail client&#x27;s features, such as filters.

==Tracking==
Mailers want to know when items are delivered, partly to know how to staff call centers. Salting (or seeding) their lists enables them to compare delivery times, especially when time-of-year affects arrival delays. It may also provide information about poor handling of samples.

Having seeded entries in an eMail list simplifies tracking who may have &quot;borrowed&quot; the list without permission.

==More definitions==
When similar or identical material is sent out to all subscribers on a mailing list, it is often referred to as a mailshot or a blast. A list for such use can also be referred to as a distribution list.

On legitimate (non-spam) mailing lists, individuals can subscribe or unsubscribe themselves.

Mailing lists are often rented or sold. If rented, the renter agrees to use the mailing list only at contractually agreed-upon times. The mailing list owner typically enforces this by &quot;salting&quot; (known as &quot;seeding&quot; in direct mail) the mailing list with fake addresses and creating new salts for each time the list is rented. Unscrupulous renters may attempt to bypass salts by renting several lists and merging them to find common, valid addresses.

Mailing list brokers exist to help organizations rent their lists. For some list owners, such as specialized niche publications or charitable groups, their lists may be some of their most valuable assets, and mailing list brokers help them maximize the value of their lists. Transmission may be paper-based or electronic. Each has its strengths, although a 2022 article claimed that compared to email, &quot;direct mail still brings in the lion&#x27;s share of revenue for most organizations.&quot;

A mailing list is simply a list of e-mail addresses of people who are interested in the same subject, are members of the same work group, or who are taking classes together. When a member of the list sends a note to the group&#x27;s special address, the e-mail is broadcast to all of the members of the list. The key advantage of a mailing list over things such as web-based discussion is that as the new message becomes available they are immediately delivered to the participants&#x27; mailboxes. A mailing list sometimes can also include information such as phone number, postal address, fax number, and more.

===Electronic mailing list===
An electronic mailing list or email list is a special use of email that allows for widespread distribution of information to many Internet users. It is similar to a traditional mailing list – a list of names and addresses – as might be kept by an organization for sending publications to its members or customers, but typically refers to four things:
* a list of email addresses,
* the people (&quot;subscribers&quot;) receiving mail at those addresses, thus defining a community gathered around a topic of interest,
* the publications (email messages) sent to those addresses, and
* a &quot;reflector&quot;, which is a single email address that, when designated as the recipient of a message, will send a copy of that message to all of the subscribers.
====Mechanism====
Electronic mailing lists usually are fully or partially automated through the use of special mailing list software and a reflector address set up on a server capable of receiving email. Incoming messages sent to the reflector address are processed by the software, and, depending on their content, are acted upon internally (in the case of messages containing commands directed at the software itself) or are distributed to all email addresses subscribed to the mailing list.

A web-based interface is often available to allow people to subscribe, unsubscribe, and change their preferences. However, mailing list servers existed long before the World Wide Web, so most also accept commands over email to a special email address. This allows subscribers (or those who want to be subscribers) to perform such tasks as subscribing and unsubscribing, temporarily halting the sending of messages to them, or changing available preferences – all via email. The common format for sending these commands is to send an email that contains simply the command followed by the name of the electronic mailing list the command pertains to. Examples: &quot;subscribe anylist&quot; or &quot;subscribe anylist John Doe&quot;.

Electronic mailing list servers may be set to forward messages to subscribers of a particular mailing list either individually as they are received by the list server, or in digest form in which all messages received on a particular day by the list server are combined into one email that is sent once per day to subscribers. Some mailing lists allow individual subscribers to decide how they prefer to receive messages from the list server (individual or digest).

==History==
Mailing lists have first been scholarly mailing lists. The genealogy of mailing lists as a communication tool between scientists can be traced back to the times of the fledgling Arpanet. The aim of the computer scientists involved in this project was to develop protocols for the communication between computers. In so doing, they have also built the first tools of human computer-mediated communication. Broadly speaking, the scholarly mailing lists can even be seen as the modern version of the salons of the Enlightenment ages, designed by scholars for scholars.

The &quot;threaded conversation&quot; structure (where the header of a first post defines the topic of a series of answers thus constituting a thread) is a typical and ubiquitous structure of discourse within lists and fora of the Internet. It is pivotal to the structure and topicality of debates within mailing lists as an arena, or public sphere in Habermas wording. The flame wars (as the liveliest episodes) give valuable and unique information to historians to comprehend what is at stake in the communities gathered around lists.

Anthropologists, sociologists and historians have used mailing lists as fieldwork. Topics include TV series fandom, online culture, or scientific practices among many other academic studies. From the historian&#x27;s point of view, the issue of the preservation of mailing lists heritage (and Internet fora heritage in general) is essential. Not only the text of the corpus of messages has yet to be perennially archived, but also their related metadata, timestamps, headers that define topics, etc. Mailing lists archives are a unique opportunity for historians to explore interactions, debates, even tensions that reveal a lot about communities.

==List security==
On both discussion lists and newsletter lists precautions are taken to avoid spamming.

Discussion lists often require every message to be approved by a moderator before being sent to the rest of the subscribers (moderated lists), although higher-traffic lists typically only moderate messages from new subscribers. Companies sending out promotional newsletters have the option of working with whitelist mail distributors, which agree to standards and high fines from ISPs should any of the opt-in subscribers complain. In exchange for their compliance and agreement to prohibitive fines, the emails sent by whitelisted companies are not blocked by spam filters, which often can reroute these legitimate, non-spam emails.

===Subscription===
Some mailing lists are open to anyone who wants to join them, while others require an approval from the list owner before one may join. Joining a mailing list is called &quot;subscribing&quot; and leaving a list is called &quot;unsubscribing&quot;.

===Archives===
A mailing list archive is a collection of past messages from one or more electronic mailing lists. Such archives often include searching and indexing functionality. Many archives are directly associated with the mailing list, but some organizations, such as Gmane, collect archives from multiple mailing lists hosted at different organizations; thus, one message sent to one popular mailing list may end up in many different archives. Gmane had over 9,000 mailing list archives as of 16 January 2007. Some popular free software programs for collecting mailing list archives are Hypermail, MHonArc, FUDforum, and public-inbox (which is notably used for archiving the Linux kernel mailing list along with many other software development mailing lists and has a web-service API used by search-and-retrieval tools intended for use by the Linux kernel development community).

==Listwashing==
Listwashing is the process through which individual entries in mailing lists are to be removed. These mailing lists typically contain email addresses or phone numbers
 of those that have not voluntarily subscribed. Only complainers are removed via this process. Because most of those that have not voluntarily subscribed stay on the list, this helps spammers to maintain a low-complaint list of spammable email addresses. Internet service providers who forward complaints to the spamming party are often seen as assisting the spammer in list washing, or, in short, helping spammers. Most legitimate list holders provide their customers with listwashing and data deduplication service regularly for no charge or a small fee.

<doc id="167612" wikidata="Q1072897" url="?curid=167612" title="Jerky">
<text>Jerky or &quot;charqui&quot; is lean trimmed meat cut into strips and dehydrated to prevent spoilage. Normally, this drying includes the addition of salt to prevent bacteria growth. The word &quot;jerky&quot; derives from the Quechua word &quot;&quot; which means &quot;dried, salted meat&quot;.

Modern manufactured jerky is often marinated, prepared with a seasoned spice rub or liquid, or smoked with low heat (usually under ). Store-bought jerky commonly includes sweeteners such as brown sugar.

Jerky is ready to eat, needs no additional preparation, and can be stored for months without refrigeration. A proper protein-to-moisture content is required in the final cured product to ensure maximum shelf-life.

Many products that are sold as jerky consist of highly processed, chopped, and formed meat rather than traditional sliced whole-muscle meat. These products may contain more fat, but moisture content, as in the whole-muscle product, must meet a 0.75 to 1 moisture-to protein ratio in the US.

== Preparation ==

Jerky is made from domesticated animals as well as game animals. Jerky from domesticated animals includes beef, pork, goat and mutton or lamb and game animals such as deer, kudu, springbok, kangaroo, and bison are also used. Recently, other animals such as turkey, ostrich, salmon, chicken, duck, goose, shrimps, oxen, squids, octopuses, alligator, pigeon, crocodile, tuna, emu, horse, camel, lion, bear, snake and earthworm have entered the market.

Most fat must be trimmed from the meat prior to drying, as fat increases the chances of spoilage (modern vacuum packing and chemical preservatives have served to help prevent these risks). The meat must be dried quickly to limit bacterial growth during the critical period when the meat is not yet dry. To dry quickly without high temperature, which would cook the meat, the meat must be sliced or pressed thin.

In industrial settings, large low-temperature drying ovens with many heater elements and fans use exhaust ports to remove moisture-laden air. The combination of fast-moving air and low heat dries the meat to the desired moisture content within a few hours. The raw, marinated jerky strips are placed on racks of nylon-coated metal screens sprayed with light vegetable oil to allow the meat to be removed easily. The screen trays are placed closely in layers on rolling carts and then put in the drying oven.

Chemical preservatives, such as sodium nitrite, are often used to prepare jerky with the historical salted drying procedure. Smoking is the most traditional method, as it preserves, flavors, and dries the meat simultaneously. Salting is the most common method used today, as it provides seasoning to improve the flavor as well as preserve the meat. While some methods involve applying the seasonings with a marinade, adding moisture to the meat can increase the drying time.
==Packaging==
After the jerky is dried to the proper moisture content to prevent spoilage, it is cooled and then packaged in (often resealable) plastic bags, either nitrogen gas flushed or vacuumed packed. The sealed packages usually contain small pouches of oxygen absorber to avoid fat oxidation. These small packets are filled with iron particles, which react with oxygen, removing the oxygen from the sealed jerky package and from an opened and resealed unfinished packet.

Because of the necessary low fat and moisture content, jerky is high in protein. For example, a 30 g (about 1 oz) portion of lean meat contains about 7 g of protein. By removing 15 g of water from the meat, the protein ratio is doubled to nearly 15 g of protein per 30 g portion. In some low moisture varieties, a 30 g serving will contain 21 g of protein, and only one g of fat. The price per unit weight of this type of jerky is higher than less-dried forms, as it takes 90 g of 99% lean meat to generate 30 g of jerky.

Unpackaged fresh jerky made from sliced, whole-muscle meat has been available in specialty stores in Hong Kong at least since the 1970s. The products are purchased in kilograms, and customers choose from 10 to 20 types of meat used to make the product. Some are sold in strands instead of slices. Macau has also opened numerous specialty shops, many of which are franchise extensions of stores from Hong Kong. Compared to the sealed packaged versions, unpackaged jerky has a relatively short shelf life.

This type of jerky has also become very popular in convenience stores in the United States, where it is usually sold in clear plastic containers under the name &quot;slab&quot; jerky.

==Regulation==
Most nations have regulations pertaining to the production of dried meat products. There are strict requirements to ensure safe and wholesome production of jerky products. Factories are required to have inspectors and sanitation plans. In the United States, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is responsible for that oversight. To comply with USDA regulations, poultry jerky must be heated to an internal temperature of for uncured poultry or for cured poultry to be considered safe. Many European Union countries presently prohibit the importation of meat products, including jerky, without additional and extensive customs documentation, and further inspections.

== Nutrition ==
A typical 30 g portion of fresh jerky contains 10–15 g of protein, 1 g of fat, and 0–3 g of carbohydrates, although some beef jerky can have a protein content above 65%. Since traditional jerky recipes use a basic salt cure, sodium can be a concern for some people. A 30 g serving of jerky could contain more than 600 mg of sodium, which would be about 30% of the recommended USRDA.

== Market size and popularity ==
In the United States, sales of jerky snacks increased significantly, rising by 10.4% in 2024 to reach $3.29 billion. This growth can be attributed to the rising popularity of salty and spicy snacks and a growing interest in snackable protein sources. As a result, dried meat snacks have emerged as the fastest-growing category within the United States snack food market.

==Ch&#x27;arki==
Ch&#x27;arki (Quechua for dried, salted meat, Hispanicized spellings &quot;charque, charqui, charquí&quot;) is a dried, salted meat product. Andean charqui, made in Peru, Bolivia, and Chile, is from alpaca, llama, or alpaca-llama cross-breeds. Peru is the world&#x27;s largest producer, producing approximately 450 tons annually. Brazilian charque is made from beef.

The manufacture of charqui principally consists of salting and sun-drying. In some regions, such as in Puno, the meat is sliced before drying; in others, like Cusco, the meat is dried from whole bone-in carcass pieces, known as &#x27;charqui completo&#x27;.

It was industrialized in &quot;charqueadas&quot; (in Brazil) or &quot;saladeros&quot; (in Argentina and Uruguay). In the United States &quot;ch&#x27;arki&quot; was Anglicised as &quot;jerky&quot;.

When encountered by the Spanish, the Inca Empire supplied &quot;tampu&quot; (inns) along the Inca road system with llama ch&#x27;arki for travelers. The Inca used a freeze drying process that took advantage of their cold dry mountain air and strong sun.

<text>Nim Chimpsky (November 19, 1973 – March 10, 2000) was a chimpanzee used in a study to determine whether chimps could learn a human language, American Sign Language (ASL). The project was led by Herbert S. Terrace of Columbia University with linguistic analysis by psycholinguist Thomas Bever. Chimpsky was named as a pun on linguist Noam Chomsky, who posited that humans are &quot;wired&quot; to develop language.

Over the course of Project Nim, the infant chimp was shuttled between locations and a revolving group of roughly 60 caregivers, including teenagers and grad students, few of whom were proficient in sign language. Four years into the project, Nim became too difficult to manage and was returned to the Institute for Primate Studies in Oklahoma.

After reviewing the results, Terrace concluded that Nim mimicked signs from his teachers in order to get a reward. Terrace argued that Nim did not initiate conversation or create sentences. Terrace said that he had not noticed this throughout the duration of the study but only upon reviewing video tape. Terrace ultimately became a popularly cited critic of ape language studies.

==Project Nim==

Herbert Terrace, a professory of Psychology at Columbia University, launched Project Nim in 1973, six years after R. Allen and Beatrix Gardner began testing a chimpanzee&#x27;s ability to acquire American Sign Language with Project Washoe. Terrace named the infant chimpanzee as a pun on Noam Chomsky. With this project, Terrace intended to challenge Chomsky&#x27;s assertion that only humans can use language. (Terrace&#x27;s mentor, B.F. Skinner, a key figure in behaviorism, was known as an academic target and rival of Chomsky.)

===Nim&#x27;s early years===
Nim&#x27;s life history is detailed in Elizabeth Hess&#x27;s seminal biography, &quot;Nim Chimpsky: The Chimp Who Would Be Human&quot; (2008), which became the basis for a 2011 documentary film directed by James Marsh, &quot;Project Nim&quot; (see below).

Nim was born at the Institute for Primate Studies in Norman, Oklahoma. A few days after his birth, he was taken from his sedated mother and placed in the New York City home of Stephanie LaFarge. LaFarge was a former grad student of Terrace&#x27;s with three children and four stepchildren. LaFarge &quot;knew nothing&quot; about chimps and instantly recognized that the arrangement would be a problem. The LaFarge household was unconventional: she breastfed the chimp (though she had no milk) and smoked pot with him. Stephanie LaFarge and her daughter Jennie Lee used signs sporadically, focusing instead on play and establishing trust, which they saw as a developmental need. They did not maintain records of Nim&#x27;s development and did not support the harsh discipline practices that Terrace and his lead trainer at the time demanded. (This included the use of cattle prods and forcing Nim into a small, dark box when he misbehaved.). By mutual agreement two years later, Nim was moved out of the LaFarge brownstone and into a large house in Riverdale, where a grad student, Laura-Ann Petitto, took over as primary caregiver.

After the move to Riverdale, Nim exhibited symptoms of intense anxiety. For the first few weeks, he refused to be alone for even a minute. When left with a new person, he would rip off his clothes and pee and poop all over the room. His habit of &quot;sinking his teeth into human flesh&quot;—which started before he was a year old—became both more frequent and more damaging.

Adding further complication, Terrace became romantically involved with Petitto. (He had also been sexually involved with LaFarge but the relationship ended years before Project Nim.) After he &quot;abruptly&quot; ended the relationship, Petitto quit, cutting off Nim (again) from his closet companion and maternal figure. Terrace&#x27;s two other full-timers quit around the same time. In the wake of these turnovers, Nim&#x27;s behavior deteriorated further; he became more aggressive and less compliant with sign-language sessions.

===Problems with the study===

A number of factors were problematic in the study of Nim’s and other chimpanzees&#x27; signing abilities including the definition of language, turnover of research and care staff, varying teaching methods, and the traumatic experiences inflicted upon the chimpanzees. Whilst the research experiments were considered studies of language, they were in effect, studies of trauma. It had been assumed that the chimpanzees had no language of their own prior to being taught American Sign Language, and the quality of their attachments to human carers and other chimpanzees had not been considered. In fact, by giving chimpanzees the ability to sign, the means were created for them to produce narratives about the experiences that they endured.

Another problem with the study was the quality (and number) of people working with Nim. There were about 60 total, mostly volunteers, and few were proficient in sign language. Mary Wambaugh, a deaf woman fluent in ASL, joined the team three years into the study and raised concerns that the others were improperly signing. She told Terrace that Nim was being taught a pidgin version of the language, not proper ASL, which has a structure and set of rules. As Hess observed, this made sense given the study&#x27;s heavy reliance on students and untrained volunteers. The caregivers signed word-by-word, the same way Nim did.

Another significant problem involved Nim&#x27;s classroom. Nim performed his signs most fluidly and creatively when playing with his (human) friends at &quot;home&quot; — &quot;home&quot; being initially the LaFarge brownstone and, later, the Riverdale mansion. Yet Terrace needed Nim to work primarily in a space at Columbia, a windowless, noisy, 15&#x27; square &quot;dungeon.&quot; Terrace described the challenges with the space in &quot;Nim&quot;:In the classroom, the slightest noise would make Nim jump into the arms of a teacher. At times, he was so scared he tried to hide under his teacher&#x27;s skirt. The squeals of rats [in a nearby room] caused him to panic. And he would rock back-and-forth on the floor.Joyce Butler, who took over as primary caregiver after Petitto quit, said that Nim was nearly impossible to wrangle in the classroom and would repeatedly ask to leave by signing &quot;dirty&quot; to go to the bathroom. Butler and her fellow caregivers fought Terrace over his requirement that Nim attend the classroom daily. Eventually, they refused to take him there.

As difficulties with staff, funding concerns, and Nim&#x27;s behavior came to a head, Terrace called an end to the study. Over intense resistance from staff, he sent Nim back to the Institute for Primate Studies in 1977 and then set about analyzing his data.

=== Terrace&#x27;s conclusions ===
While Nim was in New York, Terrace believed he was learning sign language. But in reviewing the data, Terrace came to a conclusion that surprised most everyone involved: Nim, he said, was not using language at all. Terrace said that he changed his mind when watching videotapes of Nim (in his classroom). Language requires the use of sentences, and Nim didn&#x27;t use sentences. Though Nim recognized and used signs, Terrace said he did not initiate conversation. When Nim combined signs, they tended to be highly repetitive and filled with &quot;wild cards&quot;—words like ME, HUG, NIM, and MORE. For example, Nim&#x27;s longest utterance, 16 signs, was: &quot;Give orange me give eat orange me eat orange give me eat orange give me you.&quot; The videotapes, Terrace argued, proved that Nim mimicked his teachers and used signs strictly to get a reward, not unlike a dog or horse.

Terrace&#x27;s results shocked some of Nim&#x27;s trainers and contradicted his earlier observations, including those in his book &quot;Nim&quot; (1979). That said, his findings regarding the Nim data were generally accepted as accurate. Among the many problems with Terrace&#x27;s project (see above), he did not build in blind controls, making Project Nim vulnerable to the Clever Hans effect.

Controversy erupted over the fact that Terrace did not restrict his analysis to Nim. He claimed that other apes in other sign language research projects—most notably, Washoe and gorilla Koko—were mere mimmicks as well. He made these claims after examining brief video clips of the apes taken from a NOVA documentary and a film by Allen and Beatrix Gardner. Terrace&#x27;s criticisms of other ape research led to heated debates, with many scholars contesting Terrace&#x27;s claims. The arguments back-and-forth were summarized at that time by Jean Marx in &quot;Science&quot; (1980) and Dava Sobel (1979) and Eugene Linden in the &quot;New York Times&quot;.

Terrace ultimately became a popularly cited critic of ape language studies.

==Life after Project Nim==
 Nim&#x27;s return to the Institute of Primate Studies (IPS) in Oklahoma was by all accounts traumatic. By contemporary standards, IPS was a dreary facility. The apes spent most of their time in relatively small cages with concrete floors. But IPS founder William Lemmon recognized the critical importance of apes&#x27; social interactions and connected the cages so that chimps had access to each other. He also provided a better, healthier diet than the standard monkey chow. Compared to many zoos and other research facilities at the time, the IPS chimps fared relatively well.

Nim&#x27;s celebrity was unique, but many of the IPS chimps had similarly been raised by humans. Like Nim, they were returned to IPS when they started growing up and exhibiting wild behaviors. Also like Nim, they had never met members of their own species before. The switch from a human environment to concrete cages with alien beasts caused intense stress and, in some cases, self-mutilation.

But Nim&#x27;s depression turned out to be relatively short-lived compared to other new arrivals at IPS. Though terrified of the other chimps at first, Nim made new friends. Also, several students in Roger Fouts&#x27; sign language program enjoyed working with Nim and took him out for walks on the grounds. Nim continued to use signs, including STONE SMOKE TIME NOW to request marijuana. One IPS student, Bob Ingersoll, took a particular interest in Nim and advocated for him in the turmoil that was to follow.

In the early 1980s, University of Oklahoma withdrew its support of the IPS. Faced with the loss of funding, William Lemmon arranged to gradually sell off chimps to a New York University (NYU) biomedical lab, LEMSIP. (Roger Fouts, who had been working with several IPS chimps, had suddenly left for a new position in Washington, taking Washoe and Loulis with him.) Beginning in December 1981, IPS started sending chimps to LEMSIP, including many, like Nim, who had been used in sign language research. Staff at LEMSIP began noticing the chimps using ASL to communicate with them, so vet James Mahoney posted signs around the facility to help the staff understand the chimps&#x27; gestures.

When Bob Ingersoll found out about the LEMSIP plan, he called his Nim contacts to launch a protest and press campaign. He also contacted Jane Goodall, who wrote a letter to the University of Oklahoma on the chimps&#x27; behalf. Henry Herrman, a lawyer who had caught wind of the story in the Boston Globe reached out to Terrace, who had been quoted, to offer his services. His call to Terrace proved to be fortuitous. Other IPS personnel made a few calls that ultimately led to a CBS news story. When CBS News interviewed Terrace, Terrace said he was shocked to hear about the move and, referring to his contact with Herrman, announced that he would be filing a lawsuit to stop it. (According to James Mahoney of LEMSIP, Terrace had known about the move for several months and only acted outraged when the press attention hit.)

Though NYU initially ignored the press, the mounting legal threats and negative attention made holding on to the celebrity chimp — Nim — no longer worth it for the university. NYU arranged to send Nim and fellow chimp Ally back to IPS. Nim had been at LEMSIP for less than a month. The other sign language-trained chimps remained at LEMSIP. The press by then had moved on.

In 1983, philanthropist Cleveland Amory stepped in to buy Nim, by now a celebrity, and brought him to his equine sanctuary, Black Beauty Ranch, in Texas. As the only chimpanzee at the Ranch, Nim sank into a deep depression. Nim would gesture to staff but they did not sign back. When Ingersoll came to visit, Nim signed BOB, OUT, KEY. Ingersoll urged Amory to get a companion for Nim but was ignored. Meanwhile, Nim studied the locks on his cage and would periodically escape and run into the manager&#x27;s house, raid the refrigerator, and sometimes turn on the TV. Once, in the process, he threw the ranch&#x27;s pet poodle against a wall, killing it.

A year after Nim&#x27;s arrival, Amory arranged to adopt another chimp, Sally. In her biography of Nim, Hess writes that the chimps became inseparable. Nim taught Sally how to sign DRINK, BANANA and GUM, three of the words he used most frequently at the ranch. He was frequently seen signing SORRY to Sally after they had a squabble. Nim still escaped, but a new manager handled those escapes differently. When Nim and Sally showed up at his house, he would act happy to see them and let them stay until they got bored. By keeping tensions low, he found, the chimps did not need to be darted.

After almost ten years with Nim, Sally died, sending Nim once again into severe distress. After hearing about Sally&#x27;s death, Ingersoll arranged to help get three new chimp companions for Nim: Kitty, Midge, and Lulu. The chimps thrived as a small group until March 10, 2000, when Nim died suddenly of a heart attack. He was 26 years old, about half his average life expectancy.

==In media==
&quot;Project Nim&quot;, a documentary film by James Marsh about the Nim study, explores the story (and the wealth of archival footage) to consider ethical issues, the emotional experiences of the participants, and the deeper issues the experiment raised. The film is based on &quot;Nim Chimpsky&quot;, the biography by Elizabeth Hess, and Hess is credited as the writer. This documentary (produced by BBC Films, Red Box Films, and Passion Films) opened the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. The film was released in theaters on July 8, 2011 by Roadside Attractions and on DVD on February 7, 2012.

Terrace wrote an op-ed in response to what he considered a negative portrayal of his Nim project, stating that the filmmakers inaccurately equated his study&#x27;s negative results with &quot;failure.&quot;

<doc id="167617" wikidata="Q216398" url="?curid=167617" title="Alan Sillitoe">
<text>Alan Sillitoe FRSL (4 March 192825 April 2010) was an English writer and one of the so-called &quot;angry young men&quot; of the 1950s. He disliked the label, as did most of the other writers to whom it was applied. He is best known for his debut novel &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot; and his early short story &quot;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&quot;, both of which were adapted into films.

== Biography ==
Sillitoe was born in Nottingham to working-class parents, Christopher Sillitoe and Sabina (née Burton). Like Arthur Seaton, the anti-hero of his first novel, &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot;, his father worked at the Raleigh Bicycle Company&#x27;s factory in the town. His father was illiterate, violent, and unsteady with his jobs, and the family was often on the brink of starvation.

Sillitoe left school at the age of 14, having failed the entrance examination to grammar school. He worked at the Raleigh factory for the next four years, spending his free time reading prodigiously and being a &quot;serial lover of local girls&quot;. He joined the Air Training Corps in 1942, then the Royal Air Force (RAF), albeit too late to serve in the Second World War. He served as a wireless operator in Malaya during the Emergency. After returning to Britain, he was planning to enlist in the Royal Canadian Air Force when it was discovered that he had tuberculosis. He spent 16 months in an RAF hospital.

Pensioned off at the age of 21 on 45 shillings (£2.25) a week, he lived in France and Spain for seven years in an attempt to recover. In 1955, while living in Mallorca with the American poet Ruth Fainlight, whom he married in 1959, and in contact with the poet Robert Graves, Sillitoe started work on &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot;, which was published in 1958. Influenced in part by the stripped-down prose of Ernest Hemingway, the book conveys the attitudes and situation of a young factory worker faced with the inevitable end of his youthful philandering. As with John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; (1956) and John Braine&#x27;s &quot;Room at the Top&quot; (1957), the novel&#x27;s real subject was the disillusionment of post-war Britain and the lack of opportunities for the working class. &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot; was adapted as a film with the same name by Karel Reisz in 1960, with Albert Finney as Arthur Seaton; the screenplay was written by Sillitoe.

Sillitoe&#x27;s story &quot;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&quot;, which concerns the rebellion of a borstal boy with a talent for running, won the Hawthornden Prize in 1959. It was also adapted into a film, in 1962, directed by Tony Richardson and starring Tom Courtenay. Sillitoe again wrote the screenplay.

With Fainlight he had a child, David. They later adopted another, Susan. Sillitoe lived at various times in Kent, London and Montpellier. In London he was friendly with the bookseller Bernard Stone (who had been born in Nottingham a few years before Sillitoe) and became one of the bohemian crowd that congregated at Stone&#x27;s Turret Bookshop on Kensington Church Walk.

In the 1960s Sillitoe was celebrated in the Soviet Union as a spokesman for the &quot;oppressed worker&quot; in the West. Invited to tour the country, he visited several times in the 1960s and in 1968 he was asked to address the Congress of Soviet Writers&#x27; Unions, where he denounced Soviet human rights abuses, many of which he had witnessed.

In 1990 Sillitoe was awarded an honorary degree by Nottingham Polytechnic, now Nottingham Trent University. The city&#x27;s older Russell Group university, the University of Nottingham, also awarded him an honorary D.Litt. in 1994. In 2006 his best-known play was staged at the university&#x27;s Lakeside Arts theatre in an in-house production.

Sillitoe wrote many novels and several volumes of poems. His autobiography, &quot;Life Without Armour&quot;, which was critically acclaimed on publication in 1995, offers a view of his squalid childhood. In an interview Sillitoe claimed that &quot;A writer, if he manages to earn a living at what he&#x27;s doing, even if it&#x27;s a very poor living, acquires some of the attributes of the old-fashioned gentleman (if I can be so silly).&quot;

&quot;Gadfly in Russia&quot;, an account of his travels in Russia spanning 40 years, was published in 2007. In 2008, London Books republished &quot;A Start in Life&quot; in its London Classics series to mark the author&#x27;s 80th birthday. Sillitoe appeared on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; on BBC Radio 4 on 25 January 2009.

Sillitoe&#x27;s long-held desire for &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot; to be remade for a contemporary filmgoing audience was never achieved, despite strong efforts. Danny Brocklehurst was to adapt the book and Sillitoe gave his blessing to the project, but Tony Richardson&#x27;s estate and Woodfall Films prevented it from going ahead.

Sillitoe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1997.

==Death==

Sillitoe died of cancer on 25 April 2010 at Charing Cross Hospital in London. He was 82. He is buried in Highgate Cemetery.

<doc id="167622" wikidata="Q368831" url="?curid=167622" title="Colin Wilson">
<text>Colin Henry Wilson (26 June 1931 – 5 December 2013) was an English existentialist philosopher-novelist. He also wrote widely on true crime, mysticism and the paranormal, eventually writing more than a hundred books. Wilson called his philosophy &quot;new existentialism&quot; or &quot;phenomenological existentialism&quot;, and maintained his life work was &quot;that of a philosopher, and (his) purpose to create a new and optimistic existentialism&quot;.

== Early life ==
Wilson was born on 26 June 1931 in Leicester, the first child of Arthur and Annetta Wilson. His father worked in a shoe factory. At the age of eleven he attended Gateway Secondary Technical School, where his interest in science began to blossom. By the age of 14 he had compiled a multi-volume work of essays covering many aspects of science entitled &quot;A Manual of General Science&quot;. But by the time he left school at sixteen, his interests were already switching to literature. His discovery of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s work, particularly &quot;Man and Superman&quot;, was a landmark. He started to write stories, plays, and essays in earnest – a long &quot;sequel&quot; to &quot;Man and Superman&quot; made him consider himself to be &#x27;Shaw&#x27;s natural successor.&#x27; After two unfulfilling jobs – one as a laboratory assistant at his old school – he drifted into the Civil Service, but found little to occupy his time.

In the autumn of 1949, he was conscripted into the Royal Air Force but soon found himself clashing with authority, eventually feigning homosexuality in order to be dismissed. Upon leaving he took up a succession of menial jobs, spent some time wandering around Europe, and finally returned to Leicester in 1951. There he married his first wife, (Dorothy) Betty Troop, and moved to London, where a son, Roderick Gerard, was born. He later wrote a semi-autobiographical novel, &quot;Adrift in Soho&quot;, that was based on his time in London. But the marriage rapidly disintegrated as he drifted in and out of several jobs. During this traumatic period, Wilson was continually working and reworking the novel that was eventually published as &quot;Ritual in the Dark&quot; (1960). He also met three young writers who became close friends – Bill Hopkins, Stuart Holroyd and Laura Del-Rivo. Another trip to Europe followed, and he spent some time in Paris attempting to sell magazine subscriptions. Returning to Leicester again, he met Joy Stewart – later to become his second wife and mother of their three children – who accompanied him to London. There he continued to work on &quot;Ritual in the Dark&quot;, receiving some advice from Angus Wilson (no relation) – then deputy superintendent of the British Museum&#x27;s Reading Room – and slept rough (in a sleeping bag) on Hampstead Heath to save money.

On Christmas Day, 1954, alone in his room, he sat down on his bed and began to write in his journal. He described his feelings as follows:

Gollancz published the 24-year-old Wilson&#x27;s &quot;The Outsider&quot; in 1956. The work examines the role of the social &quot;outsider&quot; in seminal works by various key literary and cultural figuressuch as Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre, Ernest Hemingway, Hermann Hesse, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, William James, T. E. Lawrence, Vaslav Nijinsky and Vincent van Goghand discusses Wilson&#x27;s perception of social alienation in their work. The book became a best-seller and helped popularise existentialism in Britain. It has never been out of print and has been translated into more than thirty languages.

== Career ==

=== Non-fiction writing ===
Wilson became associated with the &quot;angry young men&quot; of British literature. He contributed to &quot;Declaration&quot;, an anthology of manifestos by writers associated with the movement, and was also anthologised in a popular paperback sampler, &quot;Protest: The Beat Generation and the Angry Young Men&quot;. Some viewed Wilson and his friends Bill Hopkins and Stuart Holroyd as a sub-group of the &quot;Angries&quot;, more concerned with &quot;religious values&quot; than with liberal or socialist politics. Critics on the left swiftly labelled them as fascist; commentator Kenneth Allsop called them &quot;the law givers&quot;. Controversially, during the 1950s Wilson expressed critical support for some of the ideas of Oswald Mosley the leader of Union Movement and after Mosley&#x27;s death in December 1980, Wilson contributed articles to Mosley&#x27;s former secretary Jeffrey Hamm&#x27;s &quot;Lodestar&quot; magazine.

The success of &quot;The Outsider&quot; notwithstanding, Wilson&#x27;s second book, &quot;Religion and the Rebel&quot; (1957), was universally panned by critics although Wilson himself claimed it was a more comprehensive book than the first one. While &quot;The Outsider&quot; was focused on documenting the subject of mental strain and near-insanity, &quot;Religion and the Rebel&quot; was focused on how to expand our consciousness and transform us into visionaries. &quot;Time&quot; magazine published a review, headlined &quot;Scrambled Egghead&quot;, that pilloried the book. Undaunted, Wilson continued to expound his positive &quot;new&quot; existentialism in the six philosophical books known as &quot;The Outsider Cycle&quot;, all written within the first ten years of his literary career. These books were summarised by &quot;Introduction to the New Existentialism&quot; (1966). When the book was re-printed in 1980 as &quot;The New Existentialism&quot;, Wilson wrote: &quot;If I have contributed anything to existentialism – or, for that matter, to twentieth century thought in general, here it is. I am willing to stand or fall by it.&quot;

In &quot;The Age of Defeat&quot; (1959) – book 3 of &quot;The Outsider Cycle&quot; – he bemoaned the loss of the hero in twentieth century life and literature, convinced that we were becoming embroiled in what he termed &quot;the fallacy of insignificance&quot;. It was this theory that encouraged celebrated American psychologist Abraham Maslow to contact him in 1963. The two corresponded regularly and met on several occasions before Maslow&#x27;s death in 1970. Wilson wrote a biography and assessment of Maslow&#x27;s work, &quot;New Pathways in Psychology: Maslow and the Post-Freudian Revolution&quot;, based on audiotapes that Maslow had provided, which was published in 1972. Maslow&#x27;s observation of &quot;peak experiences&quot; in his students – those sudden moments of overwhelming happiness that we all experience from time to time – provided Wilson with an important clue in his search for the mechanism that might control the Outsider&#x27;s &quot;moments of vision&quot;. Maslow, however, was convinced that peak experiences could not be induced; Colin Wilson thought otherwise and, indeed, in later books like &quot;Access to Inner Worlds&quot; (1983) and &quot;Super Consciousness&quot; (2009), suggested how they could be induced at will.

Wilson was also known for what he termed &quot;Existential Criticism&quot;, which suggested that a work of art should not just be judged by the principles of literary criticism or theory alone but also by what it has to say, in particular about the meaning and purpose of existence. In his pioneering essay for &quot;Chicago Review&quot; (Volume 13, no. 2, 1959, pp. 152–181) he wrote:

No art can be judged by purely aesthetic standards, although a painting or a piece of music may appear to give a purely aesthetic pleasure. Aesthetic enjoyment is an intensification of the vital response, and this response forms the basis of all value judgements. The existentialist contends that all values are connected with the problems of human existence, the stature of man, the purpose of life. These values are inherent in all works of art, in addition to their aesthetic values, and are closely connected with them.

He went on to write several more essays and books on the subject. Among the latter were &quot;The Strength to Dream&quot; (1962), &quot;Eagle and Earwig&quot; (1965), &quot;Poetry and Mysticism&quot; (1970) &quot;The Craft of the Novel&quot; (1975), &quot;The Bicameral Critic&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Books in My Life&quot; (1998). He also applied existential criticism to many of the hundreds of book reviews he wrote for journals including &quot;Books &amp; Bookmen&quot;, &quot;The Literary Review&quot;, &quot;The London Magazine&quot;, &quot;John O&#x27;London&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot; and &quot;The Aylesford Review&quot; throughout his career. Some of these were gathered together in a book entitled &quot;Existential Criticism: Selected Book Reviews&quot;, published in 2009.

Meanwhile, the prolific Wilson found time to write about other subjects that interested him, even on occasion when his level of expertise might be questionable. The title of his opinionated 1964 volume on music appreciation, &quot;Brandy of the Damned&quot;, inspired by his enthusiasm for record collecting, used for its title a self-deprecating reference from the onetime music critic Bernard Shaw. The full quote (from &quot;Man and Superman&quot;) is: &quot;Hell is full of musical amateurs: music is the brandy of the damned. May not one lost soul be permitted to abstain?”

By the late 1960s Wilson had become increasingly interested in metaphysical and occult themes. In 1971, he published &quot;The Occult: A History&quot;, featuring interpretations on Aleister Crowley, George Gurdjieff, Helena Blavatsky, Kabbalah, primitive magic, Franz Mesmer, Grigori Rasputin, Daniel Dunglas Home and Paracelsus, among others. He also wrote a markedly unsympathetic biography of Crowley, &quot;Aleister Crowley: The Nature of the Beast&quot;, and has written biographies on other spiritual and psychological visionaries, including Gurdjieff, Carl Jung, Wilhelm Reich, Rudolf Steiner, and P. D. Ouspensky.

Originally, Wilson focused on the cultivation of what he called &quot;Faculty X&quot;, which he saw as leading to an increased sense of meaning, and on abilities such as telepathy and the awareness of other energies. In his later work he suggests the possibility of life after death and the existence of spirits, which he personally analyses as an active member of the Ghost Club.

He also wrote non-fiction books on crime, ranging from encyclopedias to studies of serial killing. He had an ongoing interest in the life and times of Jack the Ripper and in sex crime in general.

=== Fiction ===
Wilson explored his ideas on human potential and consciousness in fiction, mostly detective fiction or science fiction, including several Cthulhu Mythos pieces; often writing a non-fiction work and a novel concurrently – as a way of putting his ideas into action. He wrote:

Like some of his non-fiction work, many of Wilson&#x27;s novels from &quot;Ritual in the Dark&quot; (1960) onwards have been concerned with the psychology of murder—especially that of serial killing. However, he has also written science fiction of a philosophical bent, including &quot;The Mind Parasites&quot; (1967), &quot;The Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (1969), &quot;The Space Vampires&quot; (1976) and the four-volume &quot;Spider-World&quot; series: &quot;Spider World: The Tower&quot; (1987), &quot;Spider World: the Delta&quot; (1987), &quot;Spider World: The Magician&quot; (1992) and &quot;Spider World: Shadowland&quot; (2003); novels described by one critic as &quot;an artistic achievement of the highest order... destined to be regarded to be one of the central products of the twentieth century imagination.&quot; Wilson wrote the &quot;Spider World&quot; series in response to a suggestion made to him by Roald Dahl to &#x27;write a novel for children.&#x27; He also said he&#x27;d &#x27;like to be remembered as the man who wrote &quot;Spider World.’&quot;

In &quot;The Strength to Dream&quot; (1961) Wilson attacked H. P. Lovecraft as &quot;sick&quot; and as &quot;a bad writer&quot; who had &quot;rejected reality&quot;—but he grudgingly praised Lovecraft&#x27;s story &quot;The Shadow Out of Time&quot; as capable science fiction. August Derleth, incensed by Wilson&#x27;s treatment of Lovecraft in &quot;The Strength to Dream&quot;, then dared Wilson to write what became &quot;The Mind Parasites&quot;—to expound his philosophical ideas in the guise of fiction. In the preface to &quot;The Mind Parasites&quot;, Wilson concedes that Lovecraft, &quot;far more than Hemingway or Faulkner, or even Kafka, is a symbol of the outsider-artist in the 20th century&quot; and asks: &quot;what would have happened if Lovecraft had possessed a private income—enough, say, to allow him to spend his winters in Italy and his summers in Greece or Switzerland?&quot; answering that in his [Wilson&#x27;s] opinion &quot;[h]e would undoubtedly have produced less, but what he did produce would have been highly polished, without the pulp magazine cliches that disfigure so much of his work. And he would have given free rein to his love of curious and remote erudition, so that his work would have been, in some respect, closer to that of Anatole France or the contemporary Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges&quot;.
Wilson also discusses Lovecraft in &quot;Order of Assassins&quot; (1972) and in the prefatory note to &quot;The Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (1969). His short novel &quot;The Return of the Lloigor&quot; (1969/1974) also has roots in the Cthulhu Mythos – its central character works on the real book the Voynich manuscript, but discovers it to be a mediaeval Arabic version of the &quot;Necronomicon&quot; – as does his 2002 novel &quot;The Tomb of the Old Ones&quot;.

== Adaptations ==
Tobe Hooper directed the film &quot;Lifeforce&quot;, an adaptation written by Dan O&#x27;Bannon based on Wilson&#x27;s novel &quot;The Space Vampires&quot;. After its release, Colin Wilson recalled that author John Fowles regarded the film adaptation of Fowles&#x27; own novel &quot;The Magus&quot; as the worst film adaptation of a novel ever. Wilson told Fowles there was now a worse one.

A film of his 1961 novel &quot;Adrift in Soho&quot; by director Pablo Behrens was released by Burning Films in 2018 with a score by Anthony Reynolds.

== Illness and death ==
After a major spinal operation in 2011, Wilson suffered a stroke and lost his ability to speak. He was admitted to hospital in October 2013 for pneumonia. He died on 5 December 2013 and was buried in the churchyard at Gorran Churchtown in Cornwall. A memorial service for him was held at St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly, London, on 14 October 2014.

== Reception ==
Howard F. Dossor, author of a book about Wilson&#x27;s career, wrote appreciatively: &quot;Wilson constitutes one of the most significant challenges to twentieth-century critics. It seems most likely that critics analysing his work in the middle of the twenty-first century, will be puzzled that his contemporaries paid such inadequate attention to him. But it is not merely for their sake that he should be examined. Critics who turn to him will find themselves involved in the central questions of our age and will be in touch with a mind that has disclosed an extraordinary resilience in addressing them.&quot; Critic Nicolas Tredell agreed: &quot;The twenty-first century may look back on Colin Wilson as one of the novelists who foresaw the future of fiction, and something, perhaps, of the future of man.&quot;

Science writer Martin Gardner saw Wilson as an intelligent writer who was duped by paranormal claims. He once commented that &quot;Colin bought it all. With unparalleled egotism and scientific ignorance he believed almost everything he read about the paranormal, no matter how outrageous.&quot; Gardner described Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;The Geller Phenomenon&quot; as &quot;the most gullible book ever written about the Israeli charlatan&quot;. Gardner concluded that Wilson had decayed into an &quot;occult eccentric&quot; writing books for the &quot;lunatic fringe&quot;. The psychologist Dorothy Rowe gave Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;Men of Mystery&quot; a negative review and wrote that it &quot;does nothing to advance research into the paranormal&quot;. Benjamin Radford has written that Wilson had a &quot;bias toward mystery-mongering&quot; and that he ignored scientific and skeptical arguments on some of the topics he wrote about. Radford described Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;The Mammoth Encyclopedia of the Unsolved&quot; as &quot;riddled with errors and obfuscating omissions, betraying a bizarre disregard for accuracy&quot;.

In 2016 the first full-length biography of Wilson, &quot;Beyond the Robot: The Life and Work of Colin Wilson&quot;, by Gary Lachman, appeared. It received a positive endorsement from Philip Pullman, who wrote that &quot;Wilson was always far better and more interesting than fashionable opinion claimed, and in Lachman he has found a biographer who can respond to the whole range of his work with sympathy and understanding, in a style which, like Wilson&#x27;s own, is always immensely readable.&quot; Michael Dirda in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called Wilson a &quot;controversial writer who explored the nature of human consciousness in dozens of books&quot; and said that Lachman, a &quot;leading student of the western esoteric tradition, writes with &quot;exceptional grace, forcefulness, and clarity.&quot; Brett Taylor &quot;enjoyed&quot; the biography, but said that &quot;a more critical author might have written a book that argued for the subject&#x27;s worth in a broader and more convincing context. Lachman displays credulity on occult matters and an admiration for Wilson&#x27;s sometimes dodgy philosophy.&quot;

On 1 July 2016, the First International Colin Wilson Conference took place at the University of Nottingham. A second conference took place at the same venue on 6 July 2018. The Third Conference was held in Nottingham on September 1-3, 2023 which included the premiere of the Figgis-West eight-part documentary film series &quot;Colin Wilson: his life and work&quot;. Directed and edited by Jason Figgis, the documentary is a detailed study of Wilson&#x27;s life and work which includes interviews with Uri Geller, Gary Lachman,Tahir Shah, Damon Wilson, Jason Figgis, John West, Martha Rafferty and Philip Pullman.

Wilson&#x27;s archive is held at the Manuscripts and Special Collections Department at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. It contains the entirety of his published work plus manuscripts, correspondence and journals.

<text>MARC (Mailing list ARChive) is a computer-related mailing list archive. It archives over 31 million e-mails from over 2400 mailing lists, with approximately 320,000 new mails added per month. The archive is hosted by KoreLogic, and is maintained by a group of volunteers led by Hank Leininger.

Mailing list indexes includes popular mailing list such as Linux kernel mailing list.

MARC was founded in 1996 to serve as a unified archive of electronic mailing lists, similar to what DejaNews (now Google Groups) did for Usenet.

MARC uses a MySQL relational database to store its messages and Perl to access the data. The archive can be searched for mailing list names, authors, subject lines and full-text of the e-mail messages.

== Privacy criticism ==
In controversy with Right to be forgotten MARC is very reluctant to delete posts upon user requests.

The strict requirements are:
* On request from an original poster ... that is agreed-to by the list admin/owner.
* Court orders to remove messages

Mails not conforming to this rules are ignored and not responded to.

<doc id="167626" wikidata="Q313841" url="?curid=167626" title="John Osborne">
<text>John James Osborne (12 December 1929 – 24 December 1994) was an English playwright, screenwriter, actor, and entrepreneur, who is regarded as one of the most influential figures in post-war theatre. Born in London, he briefly worked as a journalist before starting out in theatre as a stage manager and actor. He lived in poverty for several years before his third produced play, &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; (1956), brought him national fame.

Based on Osborne&#x27;s volatile relationship with his first wife, Pamela Lane, it is considered the first work of kitchen sink realism, initiating a movement which made use of social realism and domestic settings to address disillusion with British society in the waning years of the Empire. The phrase “angry young man”, coined by George Fearon to describe Osborne when promoting the play, came to embody the predominantly working class and left-wing writers within this movement. Osborne was considered its leading figure due to his often controversial left-wing politics, though critics nevertheless noted a conservative strain even in his early writing.

&quot;The Entertainer&quot; (1957), &quot;Luther&quot; (1961), and &quot;Inadmissable Evidence&quot; (1964) were also well-received, &quot;Luther&quot; winning the 1964 Tony Award for Best Play, though reception to his later plays was less favourable. During this period Osborne began writing and acting for television and appearing in films, most notably as crime boss Cyril Kinnear in &quot;Get Carter&quot; (1971).

In 1958, Osborne joined &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; director Tony Richardson and film producer Harry Saltzman to form Woodfall Film Productions, in order to produce Richardson&#x27;s 1959 film adaptation of &quot;Anger&quot; and other works of kitchen sink realism, spearheading the British New Wave. This included Osborne-penned adaptations of &quot;the Entertainer&quot; (1960) (co-written by Nigel Kneale), and &quot;Inadmissible Evidence&quot; (1968), as well as the period comedy &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1963), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and BAFTA Award for Best British Screenplay.

Osborne was married five times, but the first four were troubled by affairs and his mistreatment of his partners. In 1978 he married Helen Dawson, and from 1986 they lived in rural Shropshire. He wrote two volumes of autobiography, &quot;A Better Class of Person&quot; (1981) and &quot;Almost a Gentleman&quot; (1991), and a collection of his non-fiction writing, &quot;Damn You, England&quot;, was published in 1994. He died from complications of diabetes on 24 December of that year at the age of 65.

== Early life ==
Osborne was born on 12 December 1929 in London, the son of Thomas Godfrey Osborne, a commercial artist and advertising copywriter of South Welsh ancestry, and Nellie Beatrice Grove, a Cockney barmaid.

In 1936, the family moved to the north Surrey suburb of Stoneleigh, where Thomas&#x27;s mother had already settled. Osborne, however, would regard it as a cultural desert – a school friend declared subsequently that &quot;he thought [we] were a lot of dull, uninteresting people.&quot; He adored his father but hated his mother, whom he described as &quot;hypocritical, self-absorbed, calculating and indifferent.&quot;

Thomas Osborne died in 1940, leaving the young boy an insurance settlement which he used to pay for a private education at Belmont College, a minor public school in Barnstaple, Devon. He entered the school in 1943, but was expelled in the summer term of 1945. Osborne claimed this was for hitting the headmaster, who had struck him for listening to a broadcast by Frank Sinatra, but another former pupil asserted that Osborne was caught fighting with other pupils and did not assault the headmaster. A School Certificate was the only formal qualification he acquired.

==Career==

After school, Osborne went home to his mother in London and briefly tried trade journalism. A job tutoring a touring company of junior actors introduced him to the theatre. He soon became involved as a stage manager and actor and joined Anthony Creighton&#x27;s provincial touring company. Osborne tried his hand at writing plays, co-writing his first, &quot;The Devil Inside Him&quot;, with his mentor Stella Linden, who directed it at the Theatre Royal in Huddersfield in 1950. In June 1951 Osborne married Pamela Lane. His second play, &quot;Personal Enemy,&quot; was written with Anthony Creighton, with whom he later wrote &quot;Epitaph for George Dillon&quot;, staged at the Royal Court in 1958. &quot;Personal Enemy&quot; was staged in regional theatres before he submitted &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;.

=== &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; ===
&quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; was written in 17 days in a deck chair on Morecambe pier where Osborne was performing in Hugh Hastings&#x27; play &quot;Seagulls over Sorrento&quot; in a repertory theatre. Osborne&#x27;s play is largely autobiographical, based on his time living, and arguing, with Pamela Lane in cramped accommodation in Derby, while she had an affair with a local dentist. It was submitted to several agents in London, who rejected it. In his autobiography, Osborne writes: &quot;The speed with which it had been returned was not surprising, but its aggressive dispatch did give me a kind of baffled relief. It was like being grasped at the upper arm by a testy policeman and told to move on&quot;. Finally it was sent to the new English Stage Company at London&#x27;s Royal Court Theatre.

Formed by actor-manager and artistic director George Devine, the company had seen its first two productions perform disappointingly. Devine was prepared to gamble on this play because he saw in it a powerful articulation of a new post-war spirit. Osborne was living on a houseboat with Creighton at Cubitts Yacht Basin in Chiswick on the River Thames at the time and eating stewed nettles from the riverbank. When Devine accepted the play, he had to row out to the houseboat to speak to Osborne. The play was directed by Tony Richardson and starred Kenneth Haigh, Mary Ure and Alan Bates. George Fearon, a press officer at the theatre, used the phrase &quot;angry young man&quot; when promoting &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;. He told Osborne that he disliked the play and feared it would be impossible to market.

Reviews of &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; were mixed: most of the critics who attended the first night felt it was a failure. Positive reviews from Kenneth Tynan and Harold Hobson, however, plus a TV broadcast of Act 2, helped create interest, and the play transferred successfully to the Lyric Theatre (Hammersmith) and to Broadway, later touring to Moscow. A film version was released in May 1959 with Richard Burton and Mary Ure in the leading roles. The play brought Osborne fame and won him the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Drama Award as the most promising playwright of 1956.

During production Osborne, then married, began a relationship with (Eileen) Mary Ure, and would divorce his wife, Pamela Lane, to marry Ure in 1957. Ure died in 1975.

=== &quot;The Entertainer&quot; and into the 1960s ===

When he first saw &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;, Laurence Olivier had a poor opinion of the play. At the time, Olivier was making a film of Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;The Prince and the Showgirl&quot; co-starring Marilyn Monroe, and she was accompanied to London by her husband Arthur Miller. Olivier asked the American dramatist what plays he might want to see in London. Based on its title, Miller suggested Osborne&#x27;s work; Olivier tried to dissuade him, but the playwright was insistent and the two of them saw it together.

Miller found the play revelatory, and they went backstage to meet Osborne. Olivier was impressed by the American&#x27;s reaction and asked Osborne for a part in his next play. George Devine, artistic director of the Royal Court, sent Olivier the incomplete script of &quot;The Entertainer.&quot; Olivier eventually took the central role as failing music-hall performer Archie Rice, playing successfully both at the Royal Court and in the West End.

&quot;The Entertainer&quot; uses the metaphor of the dying music hall tradition and its eclipse by early rock and roll to comment on the declining influence of the British Empire and its eclipse by the increasing influence of the United States, as illustrated during the Suez Crisis of November 1956 which forms the backdrop to the play. &quot;The Entertainer&quot; found critical acclaim.

Osborne followed &quot;The Entertainer&quot; with &quot;The World of Paul Slickey&quot; (1959), a musical that satirizes the tabloid press; the televised documentary play &quot;A Subject of Scandal and Concern&quot; (1960); and the double bill &quot;Plays for England&quot;, comprising &quot;The Blood of the Bambergs&quot; and &quot;Under Plain Cover&quot; (1962).

&quot;Luther&quot;, depicting the life of Martin Luther, was first performed in 1961; it transferred to Broadway and won Osborne a Tony Award. &quot;Inadmissible Evidence&quot; was first performed in 1964. In between these plays, Osborne won an Oscar for his 1963 screenplay adaptation of &quot;Tom Jones&quot;. His 1965 play, &quot;A Patriot for Me&quot;, draws on the Austrian Redl case, involving themes of homosexuality and espionage, and helped to end the system of theatrical censorship under the Lord Chamberlain.

Both &quot;A Patriot For Me&quot; and &quot;The Hotel in Amsterdam&quot; (1968) won &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Best Play of the Year awards. &quot;The Hotel in Amsterdam&quot; features three showbiz couples in a hotel suite, having fled a tyrannical movie producer, referred to as &quot;K.L.&quot; Osborne&#x27;s biographer John Heilpern asserts that &quot;K.L.&quot; was meant to represent director and producer Tony Richardson.

=== 1970s and later life ===
John Osborne&#x27;s plays in the 1970s included &quot;West of Suez,&quot; starring Ralph Richardson; 1975&#x27;s &quot;The End of Me Old Cigar&quot;; and &quot;Watch It Come Down&quot;, starring Frank Finlay. Theatre historian Phyllis Hartnoll wrote that Osborne&#x27;s work of this period &quot;failed to enhance his reputation&quot;: his fellow playwright Alan Bennett recalled &quot;frozen embarrassment&quot; at the premiere of &quot;Watch It Come Down&quot;, though Richard Ellmann, reviewing an early performance, noticed unintentional audience laughter.

Perhaps his most harshly received work from this era was &quot;A Sense of Detachment&quot; (1972), which has no plot and features a scene where an elderly lady recites at length from a hardcore porn catalogue. Part of the play involves actors planted in the audience pretending to protest, though after this began to trigger actual heckling, actress Rachel Kempson leapt into the stalls and assaulted some of the troublemakers in a much publicised incident. A representative review in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; declared, &quot;This must surely be an end to his career in the theatre&quot;.

During that decade Osborne played the role of gangster Cyril Kinnear in &quot;Get Carter&quot; (1971). Later, he appeared in &quot;Tomorrow Never Comes&quot; (1978) and &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (1980).

Osborne&#x27;s later public image differed from his &#x27;angry young man&#x27; persona of the 1950s. From 1986, Osbourne and his wife Helen lived at The Hurst, near Clunton in rural Shropshire. Increasingly his life resembled that of an old-fashioned country gentleman. He wrote a diary for conservative British magazine &quot;The Spectator&quot;, a publication that when young he had been contemptuous of. He raised money for the local church roof by opening his garden to the public, and threatened to withdraw funding for this unless the vicar restored the Book of Common Prayer (Osborne had returned to the Church of England in about 1974). Ferdinand Mount draws a contrast between this devotion to Anglican ritual and the opening of &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;, with Jimmy Porter railing against the sound of church bells. In 2003 the Osbourne&#x27;s residence was opened as a residential retreat for writers by the Arvon Foundation.

In the last two decades of his life Osborne published two volumes of autobiography, &quot;A Better Class of Person&quot; (1981) and &quot;Almost a Gentleman&quot; (1991). Reviewing the first of these books, Alan Bennett wrote, &quot;It is immensely enjoyable, is written with great gusto and Osborne has had better notices for it than for any of his plays since &quot;Inadmissible Evidence&quot;.&quot; &quot;A Better Class of Person&quot; was filmed by Thames Television in 1985, featuring Eileen Atkins and Alan Howard as his parents, and Gary Capelin and Neil McPherson as Osborne. It was nominated for the Prix Italia. 

Osborne&#x27;s last play was &quot;Déjàvu&quot; (1992), a sequel to &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;. Various of his newspaper and magazine writings appeared in a collection entitled &quot;Damn You, England&quot; (1994), while his two autobiographical volumes were reissued as &quot;Looking Back – Never Explain, Never Apologise&quot; (1999).

== Critical responses, idols and effect ==

===Inspiration===
Osborne described his childhood home as a place &quot;where books... were almost completely disregarded&quot;. One of the role models he identified was not a literary figure but a popular entertainer. Osborne was a great fan of comic Max Miller, and saw parallels between them: 

He claimed that it was his childhood memories of music hall that inspired &quot;The Entertainer&quot;, &quot;not, as I was told authoritatively by others, the influence of Bertolt Brecht&quot;.

===Impact===
Osborne&#x27;s work transformed British theatre. He helped to make it artistically respected again, throwing off the formal constraints of the former generation, and turning public attention once more to language, theatrical rhetoric, and emotional intensity. As a young man he decided &#x27;it was a beholden duty at all times for me to kick against the pricks&#x27;; he saw theatre as a weapon with which ordinary people could break down class barriers. He wanted his plays to be a reminder of real pleasures and real pains. David Hare said in his memorial address:

Osborne did change the world of theatre, influencing playwrights such as Edward Albee and Mike Leigh. However, work of his kind of authenticity and originality would remain the exception rather than the rule. This did not surprise Osborne; nobody understood the tackiness of the theatre better than the man who had played Hamlet on Hayling Island. In 1992 he was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Writer&#x27;s Guild of Great Britain.

== Personal life ==

=== Politics ===
In &quot;A Better Class of Person&quot;, Osborne describes the emotional appeal that socialism had to him as a schoolboy and how he and his closest friends &quot;all attended the local Labour Party meetings&quot; as youths. He carried these affiliations with him into adult life, alienating fellow commuters and colleagues by regularly bringing a copy of the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; into the office as a young journalist. Given a platform to express his views in the 1957 anthology &quot;Declaration&quot;, he took the opportunity to criticize monarchy:
He also protested about &quot;the Christmas Island explosion&quot; and what he perceived as the blindly supportive response of the British media. Osborne joined the CND in 1959, and in the early &#x27;60s was a member of the Committee of 100 who engaged in civil disobedience to protest against nuclear weapons. 

In 1961, in the aftermath of the Berlin Wall being built, the left-wing magazine &quot;Tribune&quot; published Osborne&#x27;s &quot;Letter to My Fellow Countrymen&quot;, addressing those politicians the author considered responsible for nuclear proliferation:
The letter caused controversy. Conservative journalist Peregrine Worsthorne expressed concern about its &quot;murderous language&quot; and the possibility that the &quot;resentment that John Osborne so virulently articulated&quot; might be shared by many others, while the trade unionist Jack Jones commented, &quot;every true Socialist should roar with applause&quot;.

In his public letter, however, Osborne had denounced Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell as well as Conservative PM Harold Macmillan. The following year, he told the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; that he would not be voting Labour at the next election, adding &quot;Barrenness is preferable to rape by one of two monsters.&quot; His play &quot;Time Present&quot; (1968) contains a mocking caricature of a female Labour MP. Critics saw a conservative attitude to empire reflected in &quot;West of Suez&quot;, and later in the 1970s he expressed support for Enoch Powell. In the words of Osborne&#x27;s biographer Michael Ratcliffe, &quot;he drifted to the libertarian, unorganized right&quot;; even his friend David Hare acknowledged that he passed &quot;from passion to prejudice. He was forced back into a position which, finally, for most writers is undignified and unproductive: the pretence that the past is always, necessarily, superior to the present&quot;. Several commentators have argued that a conservative and nostalgic strain was apparent in Osborne&#x27;s work from an early stage. As early as 1957, Kenneth Tynan had noticed &quot;a deeply submerged nostalgia&quot; for Britain&#x27;s pre-WW1 past in &quot;The Entertainer&quot;.

=== Relationships ===
Osborne had many affairs and frequently mistreated his wives and lovers. He was married five times, all except the last being unhappy unions. The first four were marred by frequent affairs and mistreatment of his partners. He outlived three of his wives, being survived only by the first and the last, both of whom have since died. His final marriage, from 1978 until his death, was to the journalist Helen Dawson. 

==== Pamela Lane (1951–57) ====
Source:

In &quot;A Better Class of Person&quot;, Osborne describes feeling an immediate and intense attraction towards his first wife, Pamela Lane. The pair were both members of an acting troupe in Bridgwater.
Though Alison Porter in &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; was based on Pamela, Osborne describes Lane&#x27;s respectable middle-class parents – her father a successful draper, her mother of a family of minor rural gentry – as &quot;much coarser&quot;, and how at one point they hired a private detective to follow him after a fellow actor was seen &#x27;fumbling&#x27; with his knee in a tea shop.

Lane and Osborne married in nearby Wells and then left Bridgwater the following Sunday amidst an uneasy truce with Lane&#x27;s parents (Osborne&#x27;s hated mother was not aware of the union until the couple were divorcing), spending their first night as a married couple together in the Cromwell Road in London.

The two lived a fairly itinerant and reasonably happy married existence at first, living at a number of places around London and finding work there at first, then touring, staying in Kidderminster in Osborne&#x27;s case. While Lane&#x27;s acting career flourished in Derby, Osborne&#x27;s struggled, and she began an affair with Joe Selby, a dental surgeon.

Osborne spent much of the next two years before their divorce hoping they would reconcile. In 1956, after the opening of &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;, Osborne met Lane at the railway station in York, where she told Osborne of her recent abortion and enquired after his relationship with Mary Ure. In April 1957, Osborne was granted a divorce from Lane, on the grounds of his adultery. It later emerged that in the 1980s, Lane and Osborne corresponded frequently and met in secret until he became angered by her request for a loan.

==== Mary Ure (1957–1963) ====
Osborne began a relationship with Ure shortly after meeting her when she was cast as Alison in &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; in 1956, while he was married to Pamela Lane. The affair swiftly progressed; and the two moved in together in Woodfall Road, Chelsea, London. He wrote later:

Eventually, Osborne became jealous and somewhat contemptuous of Ure&#x27;s stable family background and her relationship with them. He also began to lose regard for her acting abilities.

There was infidelity on both sides; and, after an affair with Robert Webber, Ure eventually left Osborne for the actor and novelist Robert Shaw.

Osborne described visiting her after she had left him and having sex with her while she was pregnant with the first of four children she would bear to Shaw. Of their divorce, Osborne wrote of being surprised that she repeatedly refused to return to him treasured postcards drawn for him by his father, but is circumspect about her early death in 1975: &quot;Destiny dragged her so pointlessly from a life better contained by the softly lapping waters of the Clyde.&quot;

==== Penelope Gilliatt (1963–68) ====
Osborne met his third wife, writer Penelope Gilliatt, initially through social connections, and then through an interview she conducted with him:

One great attraction Penelope held for Osborne was her red hair: &quot;Penelope was a redhead, as was Pamela... I took red hair to be the mantle of goddesses&quot;. Despite her being married and Osborne knowing her husband, Gilliatt set out to seduce Osborne and succeeded in doing so. &quot;Penelope&#x27;s behaviour and my own during the weeks that followed were probably grotesquely indefensible&quot;, he wrote.

Osborne and Gilliatt were together for seven years, five of which they spent married, and became the parents of his only biological child, Nolan. Osborne had an abusive relationship with his daughter and cast her out of his house when she was 17; they never spoke again. Osborne and Gilliatt&#x27;s marriage suffered through what Osborne perceived to be an unnecessary obsession on her part with her work, writing film reviews for &quot;The Observer&quot;. &quot;I tried to point out that it seemed an inordinate amount of time and effort to expend on a thousand-word review to be read by a few thousand film addicts and forgotten almost at once.&quot; Osborne wanted Gilliatt to give up her multiple careers and move with him to a country house where she would tend his needs. Osborne had put a refrigerator in the couple&#x27;s bedroom and filled it with champagne to alleviate his night terrors. Both began to have struggles with alcoholism.

He treated with contempt what he saw as Gilliatt&#x27;s growing pretentiousness. &quot;She was to become increasingly obsessed with fripperies and titles … She took to calling herself &#x27;Professor Gilliatt&#x27;.&quot; Strains in the marriage led to Osborne conducting numerous affairs behind her back, including one with his future wife, Jill Bennett.

==== Jill Bennett (1968–1977) ====
Osborne had a turbulent nine-year marriage to the actress Jill Bennett. Their marriage degenerated into mutual abuse with Bennett insulting Osborne, calling him impotent and homosexual in public as early as 1971. Osborne showed similar cruelty towards her, breaching a court order by harassing her with abusive messages after their divorce. Bennett committed suicide in 1990 (having expressed suicidal thoughts for decades): some have blamed this on Osborne&#x27;s treatment of her. He said of Bennett, &quot;She was the most evil woman I have come across&quot;, and showed open contempt for her suicide.

He concluded by stating that his only regret was that he could not &quot;look down upon her open coffin and, like that bird in the Book of Tobit, drop a good, large mess in her eye.&quot; Reviewing &quot;Almost a Gentleman&quot;, which contains this passage, Hilary Mantel commented, &quot;the pious reader may wish to pray, the queasy reader vomit, the prudent reviewer consult the libel laws&quot; (though she did speculate about Osborne&#x27;s mental health). Michael Billington called the attack on Bennett a &quot;vicious assault&quot;, though he added, &quot;he must have once loved her a lot to have hated her so much&quot;.

==== Helen Dawson (1978–1994) ====
Helen Dawson (1939–2004) was a former arts journalist and critic for &quot;The Observer&quot;. This final marriage of Osborne&#x27;s, which lasted until his death, seems to have been happier than any of his prior marriages. Until her death in 2004, Dawson worked to preserve and promote Osborne&#x27;s legacy.

Osborne died deeply in debt; his final word to Dawson was: &quot;Sorry&quot;. After her death in 2004, Dawson was buried next to Osborne.

=== Vegetarianism ===
Around the time of &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;, Osborne was a vegetarian, something which was considered unusual at the time. In &quot;Almost a Gentleman&quot; he gives some insight into this lifestyle choice:

== Death ==
After a serious liver crisis in 1987 Osborne became diabetic, injecting insulin twice a day. He died on 24 December 1994 at the age of 65 from complications of diabetes at The Hurst, his home in Clunton, near Craven Arms, Shropshire. He is buried in St George&#x27;s churchyard, Clun, Shropshire. His last wife, Helen Dawson, who died in 2004, is buried next to him.

== Archive ==
Osborne began placing his papers at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas in Austin in the 1960s, with additions made throughout his life and by relatives in the years after his death. The primary archive is over 50 boxes and includes typescripts and manuscripts for all of his works, correspondence, newspaper and magazine articles, scrapbooks, posters, programmes, and business documents.

In 2008, the Ransom Center purchased an additional archive of over 30 boxes that had been held by Helen Dawson Osborne. While largely focusing on the latter years of Osborne&#x27;s life, the collection also includes a series of notebooks that he had kept separately from his original archive.

<text>Svend Åge Madsen ( born 2 November 1939) is a Danish novelist. He studied mathematics before he began writing fiction. His novels are generally philosophical and humorous. Several of his works have been made into films in Denmark. His writings are extensive and has been translated into many languages.

Madsen&#x27;s writing style and philosophy have placed him amongst the most distinguished and widely read authors in Denmark today. His novels reflect the grave problems faced by modern civilisation, and a number of them have achieved cult status in Denmark. The interplay between quasi-realism and complete fantasy in Svend Åge Madsen&#x27;s novels leads to contemplation of the indefinable nature of human existence.

== Work ==

Madsen&#x27;s work may be divided into three phases. The first phase comprises abstract modernist works influenced by writers such as Franz Kafka, Samuel Beckett, Alain Robbe-Grillet and James Joyce. These works examine the capacity of language to depict reality; they include the experimental novels &quot;The Visit&quot; (&quot;Besøget&quot;, 1963) and &quot;Additions&quot; (&quot;Tilføjelser&quot;, 1967), the &quot;unnovel&quot; &quot;Pictures of Lust&quot; (&quot;Lystbilleder&quot;, 1964), and the collection of short stories &quot;Eight Times Orphan&quot; (&quot;Otte gange orphan&quot;, 1965).

Madsen would later define these novels as &quot;anti-art&quot;. The change to the next phase of his work was, according to him, a shift from &quot;anti-art&quot; to &quot;anti-anti-art&quot;, which accepted the result of the first phase: &quot;that reality can not be described&quot;, but that one may attempt to build a meaningful literature from a relativistic stance. The project was now to show how &quot;lower&quot; genres (such as crime fiction, romantic fiction and science fiction) could be a mosaic of equal truths that make up reality. This change is also a change from modernist literature to postmodern literature.

The third phase of Madsen&#x27;s work comprises some novels that are less abstract and more realistic than his earlier works, but are still highly imaginative. At the same time, Madsen started working on a &quot;macro&quot;-text in which characters are used repeatedly in different novels, main characters becoming minor characters and vice versa. All of these novels take places in the city of Aarhus in Denmark. Through a complex net of bizarre stories, Madsen creates an alternative Aarhus in which everything is possible and extreme philosophical positions are explored. Madsen&#x27;s late literature is quite unique but can perhaps best be likened to the magical realism of Latin America.

A recurring trait in his books is that the characters face some sort of extreme situation which enables a philosophical theme to emerge.

Perhaps Madsen&#x27;s most famous work is &quot;Vice and Virtue in the Middle Time&quot; (&quot;Tugt og utugt i mellemtiden&quot;, 1976) which has been translated into English. In this novel, a man from a very distant future takes on the experiment of writing a novel of the age called Middle Time, which is the western world in the 1970s. This creates an amusing philosophical position, in which everything we take for granted is questioned in the light of a totally different perspective on life. The main plot is a rewriting of Alexandre Dumas, père&#x27;s &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, but there are references to many classic novels.

<text>The May Department Stores Company was an American department store holding company, formerly headquartered in downtown St. Louis, Missouri. It was founded in Leadville, Colorado, by David May in 1877, moving to St. Louis in 1905. After many changes in the retail industry, the company merged with Federated Department Stores (now Macy&#x27;s, Inc.) in 2005.

This company was only a holding company that bought, sold, and merged regional department stores, such as Foley&#x27;s and L.S. Ayres. During most of its history, the operations of the various divisions were kept separate and had their own buyers and credit cards. The latter were not accepted at other May-owned stores. At times, two different May stores operated in the same geographical market, but they were aimed at different customers. Most decisions for each of the regional store companies were made by management at the local headquarters and not by the holding company in St. Louis.

Some of the regional stores shared names that were similar to the parent company, such as Los Angeles–based May Company California. All it had in common with the parent was that these stores were headed by a different member of the May family as the president of their respective regional store chain. They were separate legal entities.

==History==
In 1877, the May Department Stores Company was founded in Leadville during the Colorado silver rush. In 1889, the headquarters moved to Denver.

In 1899, May acquired the E. R. Hull &amp; Dutton Co. of Cleveland, renaming it the May Company, Cleveland, later named the May Company Ohio.

In 1905, the headquarters moved to St. Louis. In 1910, the business was officially incorporated as the May Department Stores Company. In 1911, The Famous Clothing Store (owned by May) and the William Barr Dry Goods Company merged to create Famous-Barr.

In 1912, May acquired the M. O&#x27;Neil Co. (O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s) department store of Akron, Ohio.

In 1923, May acquired A. Hamburger &amp; Sons Co. in Los Angeles and renames it May Company California.

In 1946, May acquired the Kaufmann&#x27;s chain based in Pittsburgh, retaining it as a separate division. In 1947, May acquires Strouss-Hirshberg Co. based in Youngstown, Ohio, retaining it as a separate division and changing the name to Strouss.

In 1956, May acquired the Daniels &amp; Fisher Company of Denver, merging it with May stores in the area to create a new May-Daniels &amp; Fisher division.

In 1958, May acquired the Cohen Brothers Department Store in Jacksonville, Florida, turning it into the May Cohens chain.

In 1959, May acquired the Hecht Company of Baltimore, adding it as a new division. In 1965, May acquired G. Fox &amp; Co. of Hartford, Connecticut.

In 1966, May acquired the Meier &amp; Frank chain based in Portland, Oregon, adding it as a new division. David&#x27;s grandson Morton May became the chairman in 1951 and headed the company for 16 years. Morton May was active in St. Louis civic affairs and was a patron of the St. Louis Art Museum.

In 1968, Venture Stores was founded when Target co-founder John F. Geisse went to work for May Department Stores. Under an antitrust settlement reached with the Department of Justice, May was unable to acquire any more retail chains at the time, and the department store company needed a way to compete against the emerging discount store chains.

In August 1978, May sold the 70-store Consumers chain of catalogue merchants to the Canadian Consumers Distributing. It closed its stores in 1996.

In 1986, May acquired the Associated Dry Goods holding company and its chains (including J. W. Robinson&#x27;s and its Florida division, Loehmann&#x27;s, Lord &amp; Taylor, Caldor, Joseph Horne Company, The Denver Dry Goods Company, Goldwater&#x27;s, Hahne and Company, L. S. Ayres, H. &amp; S. Pogue Company, Stewart Dry Goods, and Sibley&#x27;s), the largest-ever retail acquisition in history at that time.

In 1987, May renamed the five-unit May-Cohens as May Florida and sold the ten stores from Robinson’s of Florida to Maison Blanche so as to give them a foothold in the Floridan market. Stores at Tyrone Square, Orlando Fashion Square, WestShore Plaza, Altamonte Mall, University Square Mall, Countryside Mall, Southgate Plaza, Edison Mall, Coastland Center, and The Florida Mall were included in the deal along with a proposed 11th store at Lakeland Square Mall. May acquired Foley&#x27;s in Houston and Filene&#x27;s in Boston from Federated Department Stores whereas May Florida was also acquired by Maison Blanche. As a result, May withdrew from Florida by closing the Gateway location and converting those at Roosevelt Square, Regency Square, Volusia Mall, and Orange Park Mall under the Maison Blanche nameplate. 

In 1993, May Company California and J.W. Robinson&#x27;s merged to form Robinsons-May. In that same year, Filene&#x27;s absorbed the G. Fox division, Kaufmann&#x27;s absorbed the May Company Ohio division, and Foley&#x27;s absorbed the May D&amp;F division.

In 1995, May acquired the John Wanamaker chain based in Philadelphia. In 1996, May acquires the Strawbridge&#x27;s chain based in Philadelphia.

In 1998, May acquired The Jones Store chain based in Kansas City, Missouri.

In 1999, May acquired Zions Cooperative Mercantile Institution based in Salt Lake City, folding it into the Meier &amp; Frank subsidiary.

In 2000, May Department Stores purchases David&#x27;s Bridal.

In 2001, Meier &amp; Frank absorbed the ZCMI name, entering the Utah marketplace. In that same year, Hecht&#x27;s acquired five Proffitt&#x27;s stores in Nashville TN, entering the Nashville marketplace.

In 2002, Meier &amp; Frank operations consolidated with the Robinsons-May division while Kaufmann&#x27;s operations consolidated with the Filene&#x27;s division, yet both retaining the Meier &amp; Frank and Kaufmann&#x27;s names.

In 2004, May Department Stores took over the Marshall Field&#x27;s chain from Target Corporation.

In 2005, May was acquired by Federated Department Stores for $11 billion (~$ in ) in stock, with all former May divisions being folded into Federated&#x27;s various Macy&#x27;s branches.

In 2006, over 400 former May stores, with their wide variety of long-standing brand names, were consolidated and renamed as Macy&#x27;s. In addition, Federated sells off three former May chains (David&#x27;s Bridal, Lord &amp; Taylor and Priscilla of Boston).

===Merger of Federated and May===
On February 28, 2005, Federated Department Stores, Inc., announced that they would acquire the May company for $11 billion. To help finance the May Company deal, Federated agreed to sell its combined proprietary credit card business to Citigroup. The merger was completed on August 30, 2005 after an assurance agreement was reached with the State Attorneys General of New York, California, Massachusetts, Maryland and Pennsylvania.

By September 2006, all of the May regional nameplates, except for the Lord &amp; Taylor chain, ceased to exist as Federated consolidated its operations under the Macy&#x27;s mastheads including the stores most famous names Marshall Field&#x27;s, Filene&#x27;s, and Kaufmann&#x27;s, as well as the last nameplate to still have the May name (Robinsons-May). All locations that were not sold off were rebranded as Macy&#x27;s, except for one Hecht&#x27;s location in Friendship Heights. That was rebuilt and rebranded as Bloomingdale&#x27;s. In advance of the retail consolidation, May&#x27;s credit call center in Lorain, Ohio, ceased operations on July 1, 2006. Lord &amp; Taylor, the lone department store division not to be largely converted to the Macy&#x27;s nameplate, was sold to a group of investors at NRDC Equity Partners, LLC for $1.2 billion (~$ in ) in October 2006. David&#x27;s Bridal and After Hours Formalwear were sold in November 2006.

==May Centers==
Around the beginning of the twentieth century, the May Department Stores Company created a real estate division that handled the purchase of land and the construction of the buildings that would house their new stand-alone department stores. Starting in 1947, when they wanted to open a new store for their May Company California division, May entered the new open-air shopping center development business with the construction of what would later become the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza in Los Angeles. After that time, May became a major shopping center, and later mall developer when they began to develop new malls to house their newly proposed department stores.

During the mid-1980s, the company noticed that their stock was vastly undervalued and therefore was at risk of becoming a hostile takeover target. May Department Stores needed to re-purchase some of its company&#x27;s stock to increase the share price. To accomplish this, they needed to obtain cash quickly, which they did by making a deal with Prudential Insurance in which the insurance company gave May $550 million in exchange for 50% ownership of May Centers. In 1992, Prudential purchased the rest of May Centers and renamed the company CenterMark.
