<text>The Delfonics were an American R&amp;B/soul vocal group from Philadelphia. The Delfonics were most popular in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Their most notable hits include &quot;La-La (Means I Love You)&quot;, &quot;Didn&#x27;t I (Blow Your Mind This Time)&quot;, &quot;Break Your Promise&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry&quot;, and &quot;Ready or Not Here I Come (Can&#x27;t Hide from Love)&quot;. Their hit songs were primarily written by lead vocalist and founding member William &quot;Poogie&quot; Hart, and arranger and producer Thom Bell. Wilbert Hart is the last surviving founding member.

Their songs have been used in film soundtracks, including Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 1997 movie &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;, in which &quot;La-La (Means I Love You)&quot; and &quot;Didn&#x27;t I (Blow Your Mind This Time)&quot; underscore the pivotal relationship between the characters played by Pam Grier and Robert Forster. Their songs &quot;Ready or Not Here I Come (Can&#x27;t Hide from Love)&quot; and &quot;Funny Feeling&quot; were used in the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; on the fictional radio station The Lowdown 91.1.

==Career==
===Early days===
Prior to forming the Delfonics, William &quot;Poogie&quot; Hart sang in a variety of groups including Little Hart and The Everglows, the Veltones, the Four Guys, and the Four Gents. Members of some of these early groups included brothers William and Wilbert Hart, Ritchie Daniels, Randy Cain, and Jimmy Wroten, Stan Lathan, and Donald Cannon, friends who met at Overbrook High School in the 1960s.

Circa 1964, William &quot;Poogie&quot; Hart and his brother, Wilbert Hart, formed a group called The Orphonics, consisting of themselves plus Randy Cain and Richie Daniels. After Daniels joined the armed services, they used Ricky Johnson. Randy Cain later rejoined, and the original trio of William Hart, Wilbert Hart, and Randy Cain became The Orphonics. The name came from a stereophonic machine the Harts had in their basement.

In 1965, William Hart was working in a barbershop in Philadelphia. A man named Stan Watson came into the barbershop one day, where William Hart, who had written quite a few songs by this point, would sing while playing his guitar. Watson told William Hart that he knew a young arranger/producer for Cameo-Parkway Records named Thom Bell, who was at the time working with Chubby Checker. Watson thereafter introduced the group to Bell. William Hart recalls that the first song he presented to Bell was an original composition of his entitled &quot;He Don&#x27;t Really Love You&quot;. Bell immediately produced the music arrangement to that song and it was released on Moon Shot, which later became Cameo-Parkway Records.

===Hit years===
The Orphonics were soon renamed &quot;The Delfonics,&quot; and their first recording, &quot;He Don&#x27;t Really Love You&quot; b/w &quot;Without You&quot;, which had been arranged and produced by Thom Bell, was released on the small Moon Shot Records label in around August 1966. (The artist on first pressings of the 45 RPM record was actually listed as &quot;The Del Fonics&quot; and Thom Bell was credited as &quot;Tommy Bell.&quot; Following the increased popularity of the group, the Moon Shot record was reissued in April 1968, and on this later release it was distributed by Calla Records.) The second Delfonics&#x27; recording, &quot;You&#x27;ve Been Untrue&quot; b/w &quot;I Was There,&quot; once again arranged/produced by Bell (now credited as &quot;Thom Bell&quot;) was released in April 1967 on Cameo Records.

By the end of 1967, Cameo-Parkway Records announced that it would soon no longer exist as a record company. In December of that year, Thom Bell took the Delfonics into Cameo-Parkway&#x27;s recording studio to record a William Hart composition, entitled &quot;La-La (Means I Love You)&quot;, which featured Hart on falsetto lead. With Cameo-Parkway about to be defunct, Stan Watson started up his own label entitled Philly Groove Records and, in December 1967, &quot;La-La (Means I Love You)&quot; was first released to the local Philadelphia music market. After gaining national distribution/promotion with New York&#x27;s Amy-Mala-Bell, the single became a hit in 1968, selling over one million copies. It reached No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and was awarded a gold disc.

The group&#x27;s debut album &quot;La La Means I Love You&quot;, released on Philly Groove Records in 1968, featured the hit original compositions &quot;La-La (Means I Love You)&quot;, &quot;Break Your Promise&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry&quot;, and &quot;Can You Remember&quot;; along with covers of the Hal David/Burt Bacharach compositions &quot;Alfie&quot; and &quot;The Look of Love&quot;.

Four more Bell-produced albums appeared in the next few years: &quot;The Sound of Sexy Soul&quot;, &quot;The Delfonics Super Hits&quot;, &quot;The Delfonics&quot; and &quot;Tell Me This Is a Dream&quot;. Among the Delfonics&#x27; popular hits were the Grammy Award–winning &quot;Didn&#x27;t I (Blow Your Mind This Time)&quot;, &quot;(For The Love) I Gave To You&quot;, &quot;Ready or Not Here I Come (Can&#x27;t Hide from Love)&quot;, and &quot;Hey! Love&quot;, written by Wilbert Hart. The Delfonics and Bell had to work with a basic budget on the first creation as Thom explained &quot;When I took them into the studio we didn&#x27;t have any money to pay for string players and an orchestra so I played most of the instruments myself!&quot;—a far cry from the full classical productions from 1968 to the beginning of the 1970s. &quot;Didn&#x27;t I (Blow Your Mind This Time)&quot; also sold a million copies and by March 1970 received a gold disc from the R.I.A.A.

By 1972, the Delfonics racked up twelve top-20 hits on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s R&amp;B/Soul Single Chart.

Randy Cain left the group in 1971 after completing their fourth album, and in 1973 had a hand in forming Blue Magic. Cain was replaced by Major Harris; by then, however, Thom Bell had moved on to produce The Stylistics and later, The Spinners. The Delfonics swiftly produced another album, &quot;Alive &amp; Kicking&quot; (1974), produced by Stan Watson. However, in the absence of Bell, the Delfonics&#x27; career declined sharply, and with the exception of the aforementioned &quot;Hey Love&quot; and the minor hits &quot;When You Get Right Down to It&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Make You Wait&quot; and &quot;I Told You So&quot;, success eluded them after 1975. (&quot;(For the Love) I Gave to You&quot;, although popular, was never released as a single.) Most of their songs at this point were written by lead singer William Hart.

===1974–1980s===
Late 1974, Major Harris started his solo career by signing with Atlantic Records, and releasing his 1975 No. 1 R&amp;B hit single, &quot;Love Won&#x27;t Let Me Wait&quot;, which peaked at No. 5 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. on June 25, 1975.

The group split around 1975; one group featured Major Harris and Wilbert Hart, with new member Frank Washington, formerly of the Futures. The other group featured William Hart with new members. Line-ups would become confusing as members shifted between groups and multiple groups toured. Major Harris moved to William&#x27;s group around 1980, with their third member being the returning Randy Cain. Frank Washington also switched from Wilbert Hart&#x27;s group, joining in 1985. While the main recording line-up of the group was William Hart, Major Harris, and Frank Washington, they would tour as two separate trios with additional members added. One group featured William Hart, Randy Cain, and Garfield Fleming, and the other consisted of Frank Washington, Major Harris, and Freddy Ingleton. William Hart also toured with another line-up consisting of himself, Johnny (&quot;JJ&quot;) Johnson and Pat Palmer, and toured in Japan at least one time with Ingleton and Dr. Salaam Love. In 1989, Wilbert Hart, Major Harris and Frank Washington appeared on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;.

===1990–2000===
Through the 1990s, the Delfonics groups continued to perform. The William Hart&#x27;s with Major Harris and Frank Washington made several recordings, including backing vocals on the track &quot;After the Smoke is Clear&quot;, on the 1996 hip hop album, &quot;Ironman&quot; by Ghostface Killah.

The groups reorganized again in the 1990s. William Hart began touring with Johnnie Johnson and Garfield Fleming; this group recorded as the Delfonics. Major Harris toured with Frank Washington and Pat Palmer. Wilbert Hart&#x27;s group included Salaam Love (formerly in William&#x27;s group) and Eban Brown who formerly performed with Ray, Goodman &amp; Brown and a short stay with the Manhattans as lead tenor. Brown was lead tenor with Wilbert Hart&#x27;s group for five years, from 1993 until his departure to take a two-year break from the industry in 1998. Brown and Love were replaced by first tenor Van Fields and New York native Greg Hill around 1999. After a very short stay with Wilbert Hart&#x27;s group, Fields left and joined the Stylistics in 2000 and Hill left in 2005 and was replaced by Dr. Salaam Love.

William Hart&#x27;s group with Johnson and Fleming were featured in concert on the DVDs &quot;The Big Show&quot; and &quot;″70s Soul Jam&quot;, whereas Wilbert Hart&#x27;s group is featured on the DVD &quot;Old School Soul Party Live!&quot;, which was part of the PBS My Music series. Harris is also featured on the re-released DVD &quot;Blue Magic/Margie Joseph/Major Harris Live!&quot;, which was recorded in 1975. Wilbert Hart released a CD in 2005 entitled &quot;Fonic Zone&quot;, which he wrote and produced. Rick Ross was featured on the single entitled &quot;Here For U&quot;.

===2005–2022===
William &quot;Poogie&quot; Hart continued touring with his group, Johnson and Fleming while Wilbert Hart continued touring with his group, Branch and Salaam. Randy Cain reunited with the brothers at the Rhythm and Blues Foundation Awards in Philadelphia to perform for the first time together in years, and were honored with the Pioneer Award. Soon after, Cain joined William Hart on his tour and stayed with that unit until his death in 2009. William Hart, along with Russell Thompkins Jr., the original lead singer of the Stylistics and Ted Mills the original lead singer of Blue Magic came together to record a CD entitled, &quot;The Three Tenors of Soul&quot;, which was produced by songwriter and producer, Bobby Eli and released in 2007.

Randy Cain died on April 9, 2009, at age 63.

Major Harris died on November 9, 2012, at age 65.

In 2020, William Hart and Wilbert Hart celebrated their 55th anniversary in the music industry.

Lead singer William &quot;Poogie&quot; Hart died on July 14, 2022, at age 77.

Wilbert Hart is the only surviving original member of the Delfonics still performing as of 2025.

Upon the death of William &quot;Poogie&quot; Hart, Johnnie Johnson and Garfield Fleming returned to the group (now named &quot;William Hart&#x27;s Delfonics&quot;) joined by Michael Muse, who replaced Eban Brown as lead singer for the Stylistics for a short period of time.

<doc id="167064" wikidata="Q685595" url="?curid=167064" title="De La Soul">
<text>De La Soul ( ) are an American hip hop group formed in 1988 in the village of Amityville on Long Island, New York. They are best known for their eclectic sampling, eccentric lyrics, and contributions to the evolution of the jazz rap and alternative hip hop subgenres. Kelvin &quot;Posdnuos&quot; Mercer, David &quot;Trugoy the Dove&quot; Jolicoeur, and Vincent &quot;Maseo&quot; Mason formed the group in high school and caught the attention of producer Prince Paul with a demo tape of the song &quot;Plug Tunin&#x27;&quot;. 

With its playful wordplay, innovative sampling, and witty skits, the group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; (1989), has been called &quot;a hip hop masterpiece&quot;. It remains their biggest commercial success, though subsequent albums have continued to receive acclaim. De La Soul is the second-longest-standing Native Tongues group, after the Jungle Brothers. In 2006, the group won a Grammy for their collaboration with Gorillaz on their single &quot;Feel Good Inc.&quot;

The group released nine studio albums and one live album between 1989 and 2016. Their catalog was not available on audio streaming services or digital media stores until 2023 due to contractual disputes and copyright clearances for their extensive sampling. Trugoy the Dove died in 2023.

== History ==

=== 1989–1993: &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; and &quot;De La Soul Is Dead&quot; ===
De La Soul&#x27;s debut album, &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot;, released in 1989, was a critical smash hit in the hip hop genre. They quickly became prominent members of the Native Tongues Posse along with A Tribe Called Quest, Black Sheep, Queen Latifah, and the Jungle Brothers among others. The single &quot;Me Myself and I&quot; became a huge hit, further cementing the group&#x27;s popularity. However, the sixties pop group The Turtles sued De La Soul for using a sample from their 1969 hit &quot;You Showed Me&quot; for the interlude track &quot;Transmitting Live from Mars&quot;.

Lyrically, much of &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; focused on striving for peace and harmony. &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; also introduced De La Soul&#x27;s concept of the &quot;D.A.I.S.Y. Age&quot; (an acronym standing for &quot;da inner sound, y&#x27;all&quot;). As a result, audiences were quick to peg the members of De La Soul as hippies. This stereotype greatly agitated the group&#x27;s members, as they always envisioned their career as a constantly changing style; this frustration would influence their next recording sessions. In the press kit for &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot;, the members explained their stage names: Trugoy when reversed spells yogurt, because he liked yogurt, and Posdnuos spelled backwards is &quot;sound sop&quot;. The album artwork was designed by radical British artist collective the Grey Organisation.
De La Soul&#x27;s second album, &quot;De La Soul Is Dead&quot; (1991), was a much more mature album. It featured a wealth of material that criticized the violent, careless direction that hip hop was heading in at the time, though it still managed to maintain a light, absurd sense of humor. The cover of the album features a broken daisy flower pot, symbolizing the death of the &quot;D.A.I.S.Y. Age&quot; and the imagery that went along with it. The album spawned several singles, including the dark &quot;Millie Pulled a Pistol on Santa&quot;, a tale of a young girl who could no longer take the sexual abuse from her father, and the lead single &quot;Ring Ring Ring (Ha Ha Hey)&quot;, a story about people using the group&#x27;s recent fame to try to launch their own careers.

De La Soul collaborated with Black Sheep on &quot;Fanatic of the B Word&quot; and Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest on &quot;A Roller Skating Jam Named &#x27;Saturdays&#x27;&quot;; Prince Paul makes an appearance on the mic in &quot;Pass the Plugs&quot; with a verse of his own. The album also more prominently featured Maseo as a rapper, providing verses of his own on &quot;Bitties in the BK Lounge&quot;, &quot;Afro Connections at a Hi-5&quot;, and &quot;Ring Ring Ring (Ha Ha Hey)&quot;.

Though it received mixed reviews and did not sell as well as &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; it eventually became a cult classic. &quot;The Source&quot; magazine listed the album as one of their top 100 hip hop albums of all time. There were initially major differences between the CD version and the other formats, as the tracks &quot;My Brother&#x27;s a Basehead&quot;, &quot;Kicked Out the House&quot;, and &quot;Who Do U Worship?&quot; were only available on the CD. Subsequent vinyl reissues have restored the running order as originally intended.

=== 1993–2000: &quot;Buhloone Mindstate&quot; and &quot;Stakes Is High&quot; ===
The group&#x27;s third studio release, 1993&#x27;s &quot;Buhloone Mindstate&quot;, saw the group evolve a new sound as they continued to grow stylistically and musically. There were several moments on the album which proved the band had matured. &quot;I Be Blowin&#x27;&quot; was a departure as the track was an instrumental featuring saxophone playing by Maceo Parker. The introspective &quot;I Am I Be&quot; showed De La Soul at their most self-referential to date with subject matter about Pos&#x27; daughter Ayana Monet as well as his grandmother. &quot;Long Island Wildin&#x27;&quot; was a collaboration with Japanese hip hop artists Kan Takagi (Major Force) and trio Scha Dara Parr (SDP). The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Breakadawn&quot;, used a sample of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; and Smokey Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Quiet Storm&quot;. De La Soul collaborated for the first time with Gang Starr&#x27;s Guru on &quot;Patti Dooke&quot;, female MC Shortie No Mas, a cousin of Posdnuos, was prominent on many tracks on the album, showcased particularly &quot;In The Woods&quot;. The album ended with an old school Biz Markie collaboration called &quot;Stone Age&quot;. Missing from vocal duties is Mase, whose voice can only be heard on &quot;Area&quot; in a break near the end of the track. Also rarely featured is his scratching which was heard often on previous albums, with only &quot;In the Woods&quot; showcasing his talent in that area. The album was a critical success, but it was the biggest commercial failure for the group at the time of its release. Many publications, such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, have listed this album as one of the best hip hop albums of all time.

In 1994, 500 copies of a promotional EP called &quot;Clear Lake Audiotorium&quot; were released on clear vinyl and CD. The 6 track EP contained edited versions of tracks off of &quot;Buhloone Mindstate&quot; but also featured the tracks &quot;Sh.Fe.MC&#x27;s&quot; (Shocking Female MC&#x27;s) which was a collaboration with A Tribe Called Quest, and &quot;Stix &amp; Stonz&quot; which featured old-school hip hop artists Grandmaster Caz, Tito of Fearless Four, Whipper Whip, LA Sunshine and Superstar. The EP was widely bootlegged afterwards.

&quot;Stakes Is High&quot; (1996) was the first album not produced by Prince Paul, with overall production credits given solely to the trio. Although it was met with poor sales, it has been critically lauded for its music, lyricism, and its overall message concerning the artistic decline rap music began to face in the mid-90s. The title track and first single, produced by J Dilla, was not a hit, but the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Itzsoweezee (HOT)&quot;, with only Dave on vocals, did fare better due to its creative music video. The album spawned a third single &quot;4 More&quot;, featuring Zhane which peaked at #52 in the UK. The album did provide a launching pad for future star rapper and actor Mos Def, who appeared on the track &quot;Big Brother Beat&quot;. The album also featured collaborations with Common, Truth Enola, and the Jazzyfatnastees.

=== 2000–2005: &quot;Art Official Intelligence&quot; and &quot;The Grind Date&quot; ===

In 2000, De La Soul launched the Spitkicker Tour, a U.S.-wide tour first hosted by De La Soul, Common, Biz Markie, Talib Kweli, Pharoahe Monch. That same year, they established the Spitkicker collective, which grew to include progressive hip-hop artists, comedian Dave Chappelle, chef Marcus Samuelsson, and others. De La Soul also announced that they would release a triple album series entitled &quot;Art Official Intelligence&quot; (or AOI). All three albums were intended to be released within a year, beginning with the release of &quot;Art Official Intelligence: Mosaic Thump&quot;. This was followed by &quot;&quot; in late 2001. After this, however, the third and final album in the AOI series was never released. For the next two years, the only De La Soul releases were singles or remix compilations. David &quot;Trugoy the Dove&quot; Jolicoeur stated in an interview that it usually takes about four years for the group to record an album, promote it with advertisements, touring and so on. The group was having trouble finishing the last AOI installment for many reasons, one of which being an ongoing struggle with Tommy Boy Records, which had been releasing its albums ever since its debut.

In the summer of 2002, De La Soul toured with Cake, Modest Mouse, The Flaming Lips, Kinky, and the Hackensaw Boys during the Unlimited Sunshine Tour. The band was briefly featured in the video game &quot;PaRappa the Rapper 2&quot; with the song &quot;Say &quot;I Gotta Believe!&quot;&quot;, featuring Double, and also appeared on the soundtrack of the game.

In 2004, De La Soul released a new full album: &quot;The Grind Date&quot; on Sanctuary/BMG Records because the venture between Tommy Boy and Warner Bros. Records was shut down and the group&#x27;s contract was shopped to the other WEA labels. The band thought about having its contract absorbed by Elektra Records, but it decided to leave WEA altogether. Although it was not the third AOI album fans had been expecting, the album was released to some critical acclaim and was well received by most fans. The album features guests MF Doom, Ghostface Killah, Butta Verses and Flavor Flav, with production from 9th Wonder, Jake One, Madlib and more. The lead single &quot;Shopping Bags (She Got from You)&quot; did not fare very well and set the tone for disappointing commercial acceptance. In conjunction with the album&#x27;s release, the group also offered up the track &quot;Come on Down&quot; featuring Flavor Flav for remixing on Sony&#x27;s Acid Planet website. The winning remix was &quot;Come On Down (KY Raised NY Glazed)&quot; by Interlude Jones who said he tried to &quot;take the influential sound of old New York hip hop and marry it back to its roots.&quot;

=== 2005–present: Features, &quot;And the Anonymous Nobody...&quot; and the death of Trugoy the Dove ===
In 2005, De La Soul collaborated with Gorillaz on the hit single &quot;Feel Good Inc.&quot;, which won a Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Collaboration (the first Grammy win in the group&#x27;s career) after being nominated for a total of three Grammys. De La Soul also appeared on the LA Symphony single &quot;Universal&quot; and Posdnuos collaborated with the Portuguese MC Boss AC on a track called &quot;Yo (Não Brinques Com Esta Merda)&quot;. The following year they released mixtapes &quot;Hip-Hop Mixtape&quot;, a covermount with British dance magazine &quot;Mixmag&quot;, and &quot;The Impossible: Mission TV Series – Pt. 1&quot;, a release on the group&#x27;s own AOI Records label. De La Soul collaborated with the athletic sneaker company Nike to produce two versions of the Nike Dunk under their skateboarding division, Nike SB. 
In 2008, the group joined A Tribe Called Quest, Nas, Tech N9ne, The Pharcyde and others on the annual Rock the Bells tour and were honored at the 5th Annual VH1 Hip Hop Honors. Later in the year they collaborated with dan le sac vs Scroobius Pip on a re-recording of the British group&#x27;s debut single &quot;Thou Shalt Always Kill&quot;.

De La Soul returned as a guest on the third Gorillaz studio album, &quot;Plastic Beach&quot; alongside Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys on the song &quot;Superfast Jellyfish&quot;. Two other collaborations were recorded, but did not make the final cut for the album. They were supposed to appear on a track entitled &quot;Sloped Tropics&quot;, though this song did not make the final cut. The group remixed indie rockers Yo La Tengo&#x27;s single, &quot;Here To Fall for the Here To Fall&quot; remixes EP which included remixes by RJD2 and Pete Rock, and were featured on a remix of Matt &amp; Kim&#x27;s single &quot;Daylight&quot; by DJ Troublemaker.

In 2011, the group earned Top 5 rankings on both NPR and Soul Train&#x27;s year end &quot;Best of&quot; lists with the Amerigo Gazaway produced De La Soul/Fela Kuti mashup, &quot;Fela Soul&quot;. De La Soul and Nike released &quot;Are You In?: Nike+ Original Run&quot;, which was the group&#x27;s first original material since &quot;The Impossible: Mission TV Series – Pt. 1&quot;. The album features Raheem DeVaughn as well as production from the Chicago-based duo Flosstradamus. The recording is a single-track recording at 44 minutes, 17 seconds, part of a continuing series of releases through the &quot;Nike+ Sport Music&quot; section of the online store.

The group released &quot;De La Soul&#x27;s Plug 1 &amp; Plug 2 presents... First Serve&quot; in April 2012, an album that did not feature any contributions from Maseo. With little promotion, the album was released to positive reviews. This was followed by releasing one track a month during 2013.

In March 2015, De La Soul created a Kickstarter to help fund their upcoming album. It surpassed the original goal of $110,000 in under ten hours. The resulting album, &quot;And the Anonymous Nobody...&quot;, was released in August 2016. Originally planned for an April release, but delayed due to rights issues, the album was preceded by a four track EP &quot;For Your Pain &amp; Suffering&quot; and the single &quot;Pain&quot;, featuring Snoop Dogg. The album was nominated at the 59th Grammy Awards for Best Rap Album.

De La Soul was featured on the track &quot;Momentz&quot; on Gorillaz’ 2017 album &quot;Humanz&quot;, on &quot;Leap of Faith&quot; by Mr. Jukes, alongside Horace Andy, and on Tom Misch&#x27;s 2018 single &quot;It Runs Through Me&quot;. A tenth studio album, featuring production contributions from Pete Rock and DJ Premier, will reportedly be released by Mass Appeal Records.

At the 65th Grammy Awards on February 5, 2023, Posdnuos performed a segment of &quot;Buddy&quot; as part of the ceremony’s tribute to fifty years of hip-hop. Days later, Trugoy the Dove died on February 12, 2023, at the age of 54. He had been suffering from congestive heart failure since 2017. His death came only weeks before the release of De La Soul&#x27;s music on streaming platforms following their long-fought catalogue disputes. The remaining members of De La Soul and other artists including Nas, Chuck D, and LL Cool J came together for &quot;The DA.I.S.Y Experience&quot;, a tribute concert to Trugoy, on March 2, the day before De La Soul&#x27;s music was released digitally. The re-release of their music led to the group charting in the United Kingdom for the first time since 1990. On February 27, 2023, Gorillaz released the deluxe edition of their album &quot;Cracker Island&quot;, featuring De La Soul on the song &quot;Crocadillaz&quot;, being Trugoy’s final recording credit with De La Soul.

In September and October of 2023, De La Soul opened for Wu-Tang Clan and Nas during the North American stretch of their New York State of Mind Tour.

== Catalog dispute ==
De La Soul&#x27;s back catalog was not released on audio streaming services or digital media stores until 2023. Until 2017, it was owned by Warner Music Group, which, according to Posdnuos, had been reluctant to clear samples and renegotiate contracts. The samples used in De La Soul&#x27;s music were only cleared for physical media distribution; the wording of their contracts is not vague enough to enable them to distribute the music digitally on unforeseen technologies.

In 2017, De La Soul&#x27;s catalog was purchased by Tommy Boy Records. In February 2019, De La Soul announced that their catalog would soon be available on digital services. However, as they were unhappy receiving 10% of the revenue, with the rest for Tommy Boy, the release was postponed pending further negotiations. Hip hop artists including Nas, Pete Rock, and Questlove called for a boycott of Tommy Boy. In August, De La Soul announced they had been unable to settle the dispute with Tommy Boy and ended negotiations. In February 2020, Posdnuos said that Tommy Boy &quot;sort of came back to the table, we are looking to sort of get it going&quot;. In April, Benjy Grinberg, the head of Rostrum Records, said he was attempting to buy Tommy Boy to return the master recordings to De La Soul.

Tommy Boy enlisted the music licensing company DMG Clearances to secure clearance for the samples, but talks failed with many of the copyright holders, as they were reticent to become involved with the conflicts between De La Soul and Tommy Boy. On June 4, 2021, Reservoir Media acquired Tommy Boy for USD$100 million. On August 8, Talib Kweli announced that De La Soul had gained ownership of their music. In January 2022, DMG Clearances restarted talks with sample copyright owners. It took around a year to license most of the samples; De La Soul interpolated or replayed samples that could not be cleared.

De La Soul&#x27;s first six albums were released on audio streaming services on March 3, 2023, the 34th anniversary of &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot;. All their Tommy Boy releases are now owned by De La Soul&#x27;s company A.O.I., LLC, and are licensed to Chrysalis Records, which, like Tommy Boy, is also owned by Reservoir.

<text>The was a general army of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. It was responsible for all military operations in South East Asian and South West Pacific campaigns of World War II. Its military symbol was NA.

The Southern Expeditionary Army Group was formed on November 6, 1941, under the command of &quot;Gensui&quot; Count Terauchi Hisaichi, with orders to attack and occupy Allied territories and colonies in South East Asia and the South Pacific.

==Operational history==

===The Philippines===

Plans for an invasion of the Philippines were finalized on November 13–15, by Lt General Masaharu Homma, Lt General Hideyoshi Obata, Vice Admiral Ibō Takahashi and Vice Admiral Nishizo Tsukahara.

These plans called for air attacks against the Philippines, beginning on &quot;X-Day&quot;, by the 5th Army Air Force Division and the 11th Naval Air Fleet. At this time, Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy units were to land on Batan Island, Luzon (at Aparri, Cagayan, Vigan, and Legazpi City), and at Davao, Mindanao, and to seize airfields. Following the elimination of American air support, the main body of the IJA 14th Army was to land at Lingayen Gulf, while another force landed at Lamon Bay. These forces were then to attack Manila in a pincer attack. After this, the islands of Manila Bay were to be taken. In the resulting Battle of the Philippines (1942), Japanese forces accomplished their primary objectives.

===French Indochina===

On July 22, 1941, Japanese forces, called Indochina Expeditionary Army invaded Vichy French Indochina and occupied its naval and air bases.

===Netherlands East Indies===
On January 18, 1942, the commander of 16th Army Lt. General Hitoshi Imamura arrived at Takao, Taiwan from his base at Saigon. He received an order to hasten the invasion preparation toward Java. But due to shipping shortages, he had to adjust the plans. On January 21, he arrived at Manila to inspect the Imperial Japanese Army 48th Division and to have discussion with the commander of the Imperial Japanese Navy 3rd Fleet. The Netherlands East Indies was invaded in a three-prong attack by using 3 groups: western, center and eastern group.

====Western invasion group====

The IJA 2nd Division of the IJA 16th Army, which was assembled in Taiwan, was ordered on January 25 to move in to Cam Ranh Bay and became the main force of western invasion group. At Cam Ranh Bay, the troops were trained for the tropical jungle warfare. On the 30th, the attack order was announced. The western group was carried aboard 56 transport ships and left for Java on February 18. By midnight on February 28, the ships landed at Merak and Bantam Bay on Java island.

Following the surrender of Hong Kong, the 228th, 229th and 230th Infantry Regiments from the IJA 38th Division were also deployed to Netherlands East Indies separately. On February 13, the 229th and 230th assaulted Palembang on Sumatra and then joined the main force. On February 28 midnight the 230th Infantry Regiment landed on Eretan Wetan on Java.

====Center invasion group====
The center group was composed of IJA 48th Division, left for Java on February 8, 1942 from Lingayen Gulf, in the Philippines. On February 25, the convoy arrived at Balikpapan and the Sakaguchi detachment (56th Regiment Group) joined the force. They landed at Kragan on Java by midnight February 28.

Earlier on January 11, the Sakaguchi detachment and 2nd Kure Special Naval Landing Force occupied Tarakan. They secured Balikpapan on January 23. On 10 February Bandjermasin, the capital of Dutch Borneo was occupied.

====Eastern invasion group====
The Eastern invasion group included the Sasebo Combined Naval Landing Force and 1st Yokosuka Special Naval Landing Force. They left Davao on January 9 and during the early morning of January 11, arrived at and occupied Menado. The Sasebo Combined Special Naval Landing Force then attacked and occupied Kendari on January 23. Makassar was captured on 9 February by the Sasebo Combined Special Naval Landing Force. All these are on Celebes island.

The 1st Kure Special Naval Landing Force and 228th Infantry Regiment from 38th Army and Airplane Carrier Division 2 from Japan, reached Ambon on January 30.

<text>Count was a &quot;Gensui&quot; (or field marshal) in the Imperial Japanese Army, commander of the Southern Expeditionary Army Group during World War II.

==Biography==
===Early military career===
Terauchi was born in Tokyo Prefecture, and was the eldest son of &quot;Gensui&quot; Count Terauchi Masatake, the first Governor-General of Korea and the 9th Prime Minister of Japan. When he was four, his father was transferred to France, and he was sent to live with his maternal aunt in Yamaguchi. Due to his family&#x27;s close connections with former Chōshū Domain, he was officially registered as a resident of Yamaguchi Prefecture around that time. After his father returned from an overseas assignment, the family moved back to Tokyo. He graduated from the 11th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1899, and served as a junior officer in the Russo-Japanese War with the Guards 2nd Infantry Battalion.

After the war, Terauchi returned to the Army Staff College and graduated from the 21st class in 1909. In July 1912, he was sent as a military attaché to Austria-Hungary and in July 1914 to Germany. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in November 1916 and attached to the IJA 2nd Infantry Regiment in September 1917. He worked as several administrative posts within the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff from September 1918.

In early November 1919, he succeeded in the hereditary title of &quot;hakushaku&quot; (count) under the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage system upon the death of his father, and was raised in military rank to colonel. In September 1920, he became commander of the 3rd Guards Infantry Battalion, and chief-of-staff of the Imperial Guard from September 1923.

===As general===
Terauchi was promoted to major general in February 1924 and was assigned to the staff of the IJA 1st Division in March 1926. In September 1926, the San&#x27;yō Main Line train he was riding on derailed in an accident that killed 34 people, but Terauchi was not injured.
In August 1927, Terauchi became Chief of Staff of the Chosen Army in Korea. He was promoted to lieutenant general in August 1929 and was assigned command of the Hiroshima-based IJA 5th Division. In January 1932, he was transferred to the Osaka-based IJA 4th Division. He was the leading military commander in Osaka during the notorious &quot;Go-Stop Incident&quot;, in which the verbal altercation between two young men—an off-duty soldier in uniform who had ignored a traffic light and a policeman, which developed into fistfights, and finally into a ministerial-level conflict between the Home Ministry and the Army. Terauchi demanded an official apology from the Osaka police, insisting that the policeman had unfairly injured the Army&#x27;s prestige.The Osaka police refused to apologize, stating that military personnel should also observe the law. However, the Home Ministry and the Army concluded later an agreement that precluded the civilian police from handling crimes committed by military personnel, which effectively placed military personnel above the law.

In August 1934, Terauchi was transferred to command the Taiwan Army of Japan. He was promoted to full general in October 1935.

===Military-political career===

After the February 26th Incident, Terauchi briefly served as interim Army Minister in March 1936 in the cabinet of Prime Minister Kōki Hirota. During his term, he began an extensive purge against the Imperial Way Faction members within the military and supported the Control Faction. His inflammatory rhetoric brought about the collapse of the Hirota administration in January 1937 when he engaged in a verbal shouting match against Speaker of the House Kunimatsu Hamada, accusing him of defaming the Army. Hamada retorted that he did not insult the Army, and would commit &quot;seppuku&quot; if it could be proven otherwise. On the other hand, Hamada said that Terauchi should commit &quot;seppuku&quot; himself if his accusation should be proven false. This clash further intensified the conflict between the military and the civilian political parties in the Japanese Diet.

===World War II===
In February 1937, Terauchi was appointed head of the Inspectorate General of Military Training, the third-most prestigious post in the military. With the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Terauchi was assigned combat duty and was given command of the North China Area Army in August 1937. He was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun in 1938.

In November 1941, Terauchi was transferred to command of the Southern Expeditionary Army Group and soon afterward began coordinating war plans with Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku for the Pacific War. After leading the conquest of Southeast Asia, Terauchi established his headquarters in Singapore. He received the Order of the Golden Kite, 1st class, in March 1942. Promoted to &quot;Gensui&quot; (Field Marshal) on 6 June 1943, he relocated to the Philippines in May 1944. When this area came under threat from the Allied attack, he retreated to Saigon in French Indochina. Soon after receiving word of the loss of Burma by Japan, he suffered a stroke on 10 May 1945. 

As the war in the Pacific drew to a close, a British Intelligence Liaison Officer, Major Richard Holbrook McGregor, was sent by Admiral Mountbatten to Saigon to verify that Count Terauchi was indeed in a hospital and unable to make the flight to RAF Mingaladon Airfield to personally discuss terms of a cease-fire. Instead, the remaining 680,000 Japanese soldiers in Southeast Asia were surrendered on his behalf in Singapore on 12 September 1945 by General Seishirō Itagaki. Terauchi personally surrendered to Mountbatten on 30 November 1945 in Saigon. On 12 June 1946, he suffered from another stroke at Renggam, Johor Bahru, Malaya while being transferred to a prisoner of war camp and died. He was buried at the Japanese cemetery in Singapore.

The 2nd Count Terauchi surrendered his family heirloom &quot;wakizashi&quot; short sword to the then Lord Louis Mountbatten in Saigon in 1945. The sword dates from 1413, and is now kept at Windsor Castle. It was almost the subject of a diplomatic incident in the mid-1980s, when Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother wanted to place it on prominent display during a dinner held for Crown Prince Naruhito of Japan. However, her daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, vetoed the idea.

==War crimes==
Terauchi was given command of Southern Expeditionary Army, responsible for the opening Japanese offensive of the Pacific War. He was critical of Masaharu Homma for being too &quot;soft&quot; on Filipinos and of Hitoshi Imamura for being too lenient to the Indonesian independence movement. Terauchi&#x27;s attitude likely played a role in Homma&#x27;s subsequent relief and retirement. 

Terauchi thought the army should stay out of politics, by which he probably meant that the politicians should keep their hands off the army. In other respects he was a typically ruthless Japanese Army officer. Neither the Americans nor his own peers thought much of him, but his staff were impressed by the fact that such a wealthy man chose to live so frugally. Yamashita felt otherwise, writing in his diary that &quot;... that damn Terauchi lives in luxury in Saigon, sleeps in a comfortable bed, eats good food and plays &quot;shogi&quot;&quot;. Yamashita added that: If there are two ways of doing something, trust Southern Army to pick the wrong one. 

When told that Terauchi was in too poor health to attend the surrender ceremony at Singapore, Mountbatten sent his own doctor to examine Terauchi. The doctor confirmed his fragile health, and Mountbatten had him transferred to a bungalow in Malaya in March 1946. On 11 June 1946, Terauchi became angered by a report of a Kempeitai lieutenant colonel who had threatened to disclose Japanese war crimes to the Allies, and he suffered a second massive stroke and died early the next morning. As a consequence, he never stood trial for war crimes, such as his responsibility for mistreatment of laborers on the Burma-Siam Railroad and his order that all Allied prisoners of war in his command area were to be massacred if Japan was invaded.

<text>Lawrence Kohlberg (; October 25, 1927 – January 17, 1987) was an American psychologist best known for his theory of stages of moral development.

He served as a professor in the Psychology Department at the University of Chicago and at the Graduate School of Education at Harvard University. Even though it was considered unusual in his era, he decided to study the topic of moral judgment, extending Jean Piaget&#x27;s account of children&#x27;s moral development from 25 years earlier. In fact, it took Kohlberg five years before he was able to publish an article based on his views. Kohlberg&#x27;s work reflected and extended not only Piaget&#x27;s findings but also the theories of philosophers George Herbert Mead and James Mark Baldwin. At the same time he was creating a new field within psychology: &quot;moral development&quot;.

In an empirical study using six criteria, such as citations and recognition, Kohlberg was found to be the 30th most eminent psychologist of the 20th century.

==Early life and education==
Lawrence Kohlberg was born in Bronxville, New York. He was the youngest of four children of Alfred Kohlberg, a Jewish German entrepreneur, and of his second wife, Charlotte Albrecht, a Christian German chemist. His parents separated when he was four years old and divorced finally when he was 14. From 1933 to 1938, Lawrence and his three siblings rotated between their mother and father for six months at a time. This rotating custody of the Kohlberg children ended in 1938, when the children were allowed to choose the parent with whom they wanted to live. 

Kohlberg attended high school at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, and served in the Merchant Marine at the end of World War II. He worked for a time with the Haganah on a ship smuggling Jewish refugees from Romania into Palestine through the British Blockade. Captured by the British and held at an internment camp on Cyprus, Kohlberg escaped with fellow crew members. Kohlberg was in Palestine during the fighting in 1948 to establish the state of Israel, but refused to participate and focused on nonviolent forms of activism. He also lived on a kibbutz during this time, until he was able to return to America in 1948. In the same year, he enrolled at the University of Chicago. At the time it was possible to gain credit for courses by examination, and Kohlberg earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in one year, 1948. He then began study for his doctoral degree in psychology, which he completed at Chicago in 1958. In 1955 while beginning his dissertation, he married Lucille Stigberg, and the couple had two sons, David and Steven.

In those early years he read Piaget&#x27;s work. Kohlberg found a scholarly approach that gave a central place to the individual&#x27;s reasoning in moral decision making. At the time this contrasted with the current psychological approaches of behaviorism and psychoanalysis that explained morality as simple internalization of external cultural or parental rules, through teaching using reinforcement and punishment or identification with a parental authority.

==Career==

Kohlberg&#x27;s first academic appointment was at Yale University, as an assistant professor of psychology, 1958–1961.

 Kohlberg spent a year at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, in Palo Alto, California, 1961–1962, and then joined the Psychology Department of the University of Chicago as assistant, then associate professor of psychology and human development, 1962–1967. There he instituted the Child Psychology Training Program. 

He held a visiting appointment at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, 1967–1968, and then was appointed Professor of Education and Social Psychology there, beginning 1968, where he remained until his death.

In 1969 he accepted Rebecca Shribman-Katz&#x27;s invitation of the Society for Justice-Ethics-Morals (JEM) and visited Israel to study the morality of young people in that country. This was the beginning of the life-long cooperation between JEM and Kohlberg. JEM published many books in Hebrew under his supervision, merging Kohlberg&#x27;s morality theory and Jewish morality and putting it into practice, in teaching justice, ethics and morals to judges, lawyers, teachers, police officers, prisoners and the young generation of Israel . 

In 1978, Kohlberg invited Katz to participate in the conference of Law in a Free Society, which led to the research published in 1980 &quot;Moral Education and Law-Related Education&quot;.

===Stages of moral development===

In his unpublished 1958 dissertation, Kohlberg described what are now known as Kohlberg&#x27;s stages of moral development. These stages are planes of moral adequacy conceived to explain the development of moral reasoning. Created while studying psychology at the University of Chicago, the theory was inspired by the work of Jean Piaget and a fascination with children&#x27;s reactions to moral dilemmas. Kohlberg proposed a form of &quot;Socratic&quot; moral education and reaffirmed John Dewey&#x27;s idea that development should be the aim of education. He also outlined how educators can influence moral development without indoctrination and how public school can be engaged in moral education consistent with the United States Constitution.

Kohlberg&#x27;s approach begins with the assumption that humans are intrinsically motivated to explore and become competent at functioning in their environments. In social development, this leads us to imitate role models we perceive as competent and to look to them for validation. Thus our earliest childhood references on the rightness of our and others&#x27; actions are adult role models with whom we are in regular contact. Kohlberg also held that there are common patterns of social life, observed in universally occurring social institutions, such as families, peer groups, structures, and procedures for clan or society decision-making, and cooperative work for mutual defense and sustenance. Endeavoring to become competent participants in such institutions, humans in all cultures exhibit similar actions and thoughts concerning the relations of self, others, and the social world. Furthermore, the more one is prompted to have empathy for the other person, the more quickly one learns to function well in cooperative human interactions. 

The sequence of stages of moral development thus corresponds to a sequence of progressively more inclusive social circles (family, peers, community, etc.) within which humans seek to operate competently. When those groups function well, oriented by reciprocity and mutual care and respect, growing humans adapt to larger and larger circles of justice, care, and respect. Each stage of moral cognitive development is the realization in conscious thought of the relations of justice, care, and respect exhibited in a wider circle of social relations, including narrower circles within the wider.

Kohlberg&#x27;s theory holds that moral reasoning, which is the basis for ethical behavior, has six identifiable developmental constructive stages – each more adequate at responding to moral dilemmas than the last. Kohlberg suggested that the higher stages of moral development provide the person with greater capacities/abilities in terms of decision making and so these stages allow people to handle more complex dilemmas. In studying these, Kohlberg followed the development of moral judgment beyond the ages originally studied earlier by Piaget, who also claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages. Expanding considerably upon this groundwork, it was determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice and that its development continued throughout the life span, even spawning dialogue of philosophical implications of such research. His model &quot;is based on the assumption of co-operative social organization on the basis of justice and fairness.&quot;

Kohlberg studied moral reasoning by presenting subjects with moral dilemmas. He would then categorize and classify the reasoning used in the responses, into one of six distinct stages, grouped into three levels: preconventional, conventional and postconventional. Each level contains two stages. These stages heavily influenced others and have been utilized by others like James Rest in making the &quot;Defining Issues Test&quot; in 1979.

=== Moral education ===
Kohlberg is most well known among psychologists for his research in moral psychology, but among educators he is known for his applied work of moral education in schools. The three major contributions Kohlberg made to moral education were the use of Moral Exemplars, Dilemma Discussions, and Just Community Schools.

Kohlberg&#x27;s first method of moral education was to examine the lives of moral exemplars who practiced principled morals such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Socrates, and Abraham Lincoln. He believed that moral exemplars&#x27; words and deeds increased the moral reasoning of those who watched and listened to them. Kohlberg never tested to see if examining the lives of moral exemplars did in fact increase moral reasoning. Recent research in moral psychology has brought back the value of witnessing moral exemplars in action or learning about their stories. Witnessing the virtuous acts of moral exemplars may not increase moral reasoning, but it has been shown to elicit an emotion known as moral elevation that can increase an individual&#x27;s desire to be a better person and even has the potential to increase prosocial and moral behavior. Although Kohlberg&#x27;s hypothesis that moral exemplars could increase moral reasoning might be unfounded, his understanding that moral exemplars have an important place in moral education has growing support.

Dilemma discussions in schools was another method proposed by Kohlberg to increase moral reasoning. Unlike moral exemplars, Kohlberg tested this method by integrating moral dilemma discussion into the curricula of school classes in humanities and social studies. Results of this and other studies using similar methods found that moral discussion does increase moral reasoning and works best if the individual in question is in discussion with a person who is using reasoning that is just one stage above their own.

The final method Kohlberg used for moral education was known as &quot;just communities&quot;. In 1974, Kohlberg worked with schools to set up democracy-based programs, where both students and teachers were given one vote to decide on school policies. The purpose of these programs were to build a sense of community in schools in order to promote democratic values and increase moral reasoning. Kohlberg&#x27;s idea and development of &quot;just communities&quot; were greatly influenced by his time living on a kibbutz as a young adult in 1948 and when he was doing longitudinal cross-cultural research of moral development at Sasa, another kibbutz.

===Writing===
Some of Kohlberg&#x27;s most important publications were collected in his &quot;Essays on Moral Development&quot;, Vols. I and II, &quot;The Philosophy of Moral Development&quot; (1981) and &quot;The Psychology of Moral Development&quot; (1984), published by Harper &amp; Row. Other works published by Kohlgainz or about Kohlberg&#x27;s theories and research include &quot;Consensus and Controversy&quot;, &quot;The Meaning and Measurement of Moral Development&quot;, &quot;Lawrence Kohlberg&#x27;s Approach to Moral Education&quot; and &quot;Child Psychology and Childhood Education: A Cognitive Developmental View&quot;.

==Critiques==
Carol Gilligan, a fellow researcher of Kohlberg&#x27;s in the studies of moral reasoning that led to Kohlberg&#x27;s developmental stage theory, suggested that to make moral judgments based on optimizing concrete human relations is not necessarily a lower stage of moral judgment than to consider objective principles. Postulating that women may develop an empathy-based ethic with a different, but not lower structure than that Kohlberg had described, Gilligan wrote &quot;In a Different Voice&quot;, a book that founded a new movement of care-based ethics that initially found strong resonance among feminists and later achieved wider recognition.

Kohlberg&#x27;s response to Carol Gilligan&#x27;s criticism was that he agreed with her that there is a care moral orientation that is distinct from a justice moral orientation, but he disagreed with her claim that women scored lower than men on measures of moral developmental stages because they are more inclined to use care orientation rather than a justice orientation. Kohlberg disagreed with Gilligan&#x27;s position on two grounds. Firstly, many studies measuring moral development of males and females found no difference between men and women, and when differences were found, they were attributable to differences in education, work experiences, and role-taking opportunities, but not gender. Secondly, longitudinal studies of females found the same invariant sequence of moral development as previous studies that were of males only. In other words, Gilligan&#x27;s criticism of Kohlberg&#x27;s moral development theory was centered on differences between males and females that did not exist. Kohlberg&#x27;s detailed responses to numerous critics can be read in his book &quot;Essays on Moral Development: Vol.II. The Psychology of Moral Development: The Nature and Validity of Moral Stages.&quot;

Another criticism against Kohlberg&#x27;s theory was that it focused too much on reason at the expense of other factors. One problem with Kohlberg&#x27;s focus on reason was that little empirical evidence found a relationship between moral reasoning and moral behavior. Kohlberg recognized this lack of a relationship between his moral stages and moral behavior. In an attempt to understand this, he proposed two sub-stages within each stage, to explain individual differences within each stage. He then proposed a model of the relationship between moral judgments and moral action. According to Kohlberg, an individual first interprets the situation using their moral reasoning, which is influenced by their moral stage and sub-stage. After interpretation individuals make a deontic choice and a judgment of responsibility, which are both influenced by the stage and sub-stage of the individual. If the individual does decide on a moral action and their obligation to do it, they still need the non-moral skills to carry out a moral behavior. If this model is true then it would explain why research was having a hard time finding a direct relationship between moral reason and moral behavior.

Another problem with Kohlberg&#x27;s emphasis on moral reasoning is growing empirical support that individuals are more likely to use intuitive &quot;gut reactions&quot; to make moral decisions than use reason-based thought. The high use of intuition directly challenges the place of reason in moral experience. This expanding of the moral domain from reason has raised questions that perhaps morality research is entering areas of inquiry that are not considered real morality, which was a concern of Kohlberg when he first started his research.

Scholars such as Elliot Turiel and James Rest have responded to Kohlberg&#x27;s work with their own significant contributions.

==Death==
While doing cross-cultural research in Belize in 1971, Kohlberg contracted a tropical parasitic infection, causing him extreme abdominal pain. The long-term effects of the infection and the medications took their toll, and Kohlberg&#x27;s health declined as he also engaged in increasingly demanding professional work, including &quot;Just Community&quot; prison and school moral education programs. Kohlberg experienced depression as well.

On January 17, 1987, Kohlberg parked at the end of a dead end street in Winthrop, Massachusetts, across from Boston&#x27;s Logan Airport. He left his wallet with identification on the front seat of his unlocked car and apparently walked into the icy Boston Harbor. His car and wallet were found within a couple of weeks, and his body was recovered some time later, with the late winter thaw, in a tidal marsh across the harbor near the end of a Logan Airport runway.

After Kohlberg&#x27;s body was recovered and his death confirmed, former students and colleagues published special issues of scholarly journals to commemorate his contribution to developmental psychology.

<text>A smartphone is a mobile device that combines the functionality of a traditional mobile phone with advanced computing capabilities. It typically has a touchscreen interface, allowing users to access a wide range of applications and services, such as web browsing, email, and social media, as well as multimedia playback and streaming. Smartphones have built-in cameras, GPS navigation, and support for various communication methods, including voice calls, text messaging, and internet-based messaging apps. Smartphones are distinguished from older-design feature phones by their more advanced hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems, access to the internet, business applications, mobile payments, and multimedia functionality, including music, video, gaming, radio, and television.

Smartphones typically feature metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) chips, various sensors, and support for multiple wireless communication protocols. Examples of smartphone sensors include accelerometers, barometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers; they can be used by both pre-installed and third-party software to enhance functionality. Wireless communication standards supported by smartphones include LTE, 5G NR, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and satellite navigation. By the mid-2020s, manufacturers began integrating satellite messaging and emergency services, expanding their utility in remote areas without reliable cellular coverage. Smartphones have largely replaced personal digital assistant (PDA) devices, handheld/palm-sized PCs, portable media players (PMP), point-and-shoot cameras, camcorders, and, to a lesser extent, handheld video game consoles, e-reader devices, pocket calculators, and GPS tracking units.

Following the rising popularity of the iPhone in the late 2000s, the majority of smartphones have featured thin, slate-like form factors with large, capacitive touch screens with support for multi-touch gestures rather than physical keyboards. Most modern smartphones have the ability for users to download or purchase additional applications from a centralized app store. They often have support for cloud storage and cloud synchronization, and virtual assistants.

Since the early 2010s, improved hardware and faster wireless communication have bolstered the growth of the smartphone industry. , over a billion smartphones are sold globally every year. In 2019 alone, 1.54 billion smartphone units were shipped worldwide. , 75.05 percent of the world population were smartphone users. 

==History==
Early smartphones were marketed primarily towards the enterprise market, attempting to bridge the functionality of standalone PDA devices with support for cellular telephony, but were limited by their bulky form, short battery life, slow analog cellular networks, and the immaturity of wireless data services. These issues were eventually resolved with the exponential scaling and miniaturization of MOS transistors down to sub-micron levels (Moore&#x27;s law), the improved lithium-ion battery, faster digital mobile data networks (Edholm&#x27;s law), and more mature software platforms that allowed mobile device ecosystems to develop independently of data providers.

In the 2000s, NTT DoCoMo&#x27;s i-mode platform, BlackBerry, Nokia&#x27;s Symbian platform, and Windows Mobile began to gain market traction, with models often featuring QWERTY keyboards or resistive touchscreen input and emphasizing access to push email and wireless internet.

===Forerunner===

In the early 1990s, IBM engineer Frank Canova considered that chip-and-wireless technology was becoming small enough to use in handheld devices. The first commercially available device that could be properly referred to as a &quot;smartphone&quot; began as a prototype called &quot;Angler&quot; developed by Canova in 1992 while at IBM and demonstrated in November of that year at the COMDEX computer industry trade show. A refined version was marketed to consumers in 1994 by BellSouth under the name Simon Personal Communicator. In addition to placing and receiving cellular calls, the touchscreen-equipped Simon could send and receive faxes and emails. It included an address book, calendar, appointment scheduler, calculator, world time clock, and notepad, as well as other visionary mobile applications such as maps, stock reports and news.

The IBM Simon was manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric, which integrated features with its own cellular radio technologies. It featured a liquid-crystal display (LCD) and PC Card support. The Simon was commercially unsuccessful, particularly due to its bulky form factor and limited battery life, using NiCad batteries rather than the nickel–metal hydride batteries commonly used in mobile phones in the 1990s, or lithium-ion batteries used in modern smartphones.

The term &quot;smart phone&quot; (in &quot;two&quot; words) was not coined until a year after the introduction of the Simon, appearing in print as early as 1995, describing AT&amp;T&#x27;s PhoneWriter Communicator.

The term &quot;smartphone&quot; (as &quot;one&quot; word) was first used by Ericsson in 1997 to describe a new device concept, the GS88.

===PDA/phone hybrids===
Beginning in the mid-to-late 1990s, many people who had mobile phones carried a separate dedicated PDA device, running early versions of operating systems such as Palm OS, Newton OS, Symbian or Windows CE/Pocket PC. These operating systems would later evolve into early mobile operating systems. Most of the &quot;smartphones&quot; in this era were hybrid devices that combined these existing familiar PDA OSes with basic phone hardware. The results were devices that were bulkier than either dedicated mobile phones or PDAs, but allowed a limited amount of cellular Internet access. PDA and mobile phone manufacturers competed in reducing the size of devices. The bulk of these smartphones combined with their high cost and expensive data plans, plus other drawbacks such as expansion limitations and decreased battery life compared to separate standalone devices, generally limited their popularity to &quot;early adopters&quot; and business users who needed portable connectivity.

In March 1996, Hewlett-Packard released the OmniGo 700LX, a modified HP 200LX palmtop PC with a Nokia 2110 mobile phone piggybacked onto it and ROM-based software to support it. It had a 640 × 200 resolution CGA compatible four-shade gray-scale LCD screen and could be used to place and receive calls, and to create and receive text messages, emails and faxes. It was also 100% DOS 5.0 compatible, allowing it to run thousands of existing software titles, including early versions of Windows.

In August 1996, Nokia released the Nokia 9000 Communicator, a digital cellular PDA based on the Nokia 2110 with an integrated system based on the PEN/GEOS 3.0 operating system from Geoworks. The two components were attached by a hinge in what became known as a clamshell design, with the display above and a physical QWERTY keyboard below. The PDA provided e-mail; calendar, address book, calculator and notebook applications; text-based Web browsing; and could send and receive faxes. When closed, the device could be used as a digital cellular telephone.

In June 1999, Qualcomm released the &quot;pdQ Smartphone&quot;, a CDMA digital PCS smartphone with an integrated Palm PDA and Internet connectivity.

Subsequent landmark devices included:

* The Ericsson R380 (December 2000) by Ericsson Mobile Communications, the first phone running the operating system later named Symbian (it ran EPOC Release 5, which was renamed Symbian OS at Release 6). It had PDA functionality and limited Web browsing on a resistive touchscreen utilizing a stylus. While it was marketed as a &quot;smartphone&quot;, users could not install their own software on the device.
* The Kyocera 6035 (February 2001), a dual-nature device with a separate Palm OS PDA operating system and CDMA mobile phone firmware. It supported limited Web browsing with the PDA software treating the phone hardware as an attached modem. 
* The Nokia 9210 Communicator (June 2001), the first phone running Symbian (Release 6) with Nokia&#x27;s Series 80 platform (v1.0). This was the first Symbian phone platform allowing the installation of additional applications. Like the Nokia 9000 Communicator, it is a large clamshell device with a full physical QWERTY keyboard inside.
* Handspring&#x27;s Treo 180 (2002), the first smartphone that fully integrated the Palm OS on a GSM mobile phone having telephony, SMS messaging and Internet access built into the OS. The 180 model had a thumb-type keyboard and the 180g version had a Graffiti handwriting recognition area, instead.

===Japanese cell phones===
In 1999, Japanese wireless provider NTT DoCoMo launched i-mode, a new mobile internet platform which provided data transmission speeds up to 9.6 kilobits per second, and access web services available through the platform such as online shopping. NTT DoCoMo&#x27;s i-mode used cHTML, a language which restricted some aspects of traditional HTML in favor of increasing data speed for the devices. Limited functionality, small screens and limited bandwidth allowed for phones to use the slower data speeds available. The rise of i-mode helped NTT DoCoMo accumulate an estimated 40 million subscribers by the end of 2001, and ranked first in market capitalization in Japan and second globally. 

Japanese cell phones increasingly diverged from global standards and trends to offer other forms of advanced services and smartphone-like functionality that were specifically tailored to the Japanese market, such as mobile payments and shopping, near-field communication (NFC) allowing mobile wallet functionality to replace smart cards for transit fares, loyalty cards, identity cards, event tickets, coupons, money transfer, etc., downloadable content like musical ringtones, games, and comics, and 1seg mobile television. Phones built by Japanese manufacturers used custom firmware, however, and did not yet feature standardized mobile operating systems designed to cater to third-party application development, so their software and ecosystems were akin to very advanced feature phones. As with other feature phones, additional software and services required partnerships and deals with providers.

The degree of integration between phones and carriers, unique phone features, non-standardized platforms, and tailoring to Japanese culture made it difficult for Japanese manufacturers to export their phones, especially when demand was so high in Japan that the companies did not feel the need to look elsewhere for additional profits.

The rise of 3G technology in other markets and non-Japanese phones with powerful standardized smartphone operating systems, app stores, and advanced wireless network capabilities allowed non-Japanese phone manufacturers to finally break in to the Japanese market, gradually adopting Japanese phone features like emojis, mobile payments, NFC, etc. and spreading them to the rest of the world.

===Early smartphones===
Phones that made effective use of any significant data connectivity were still rare outside Japan until the introduction of the Danger Hiptop in 2002, which saw moderate success among U.S. consumers as the T-Mobile Sidekick. Later, in the mid-2000s, business users in the U.S. started to adopt devices based on Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Mobile, and then BlackBerry smartphones from Research In Motion. American users popularized the term &quot;CrackBerry&quot; in 2006 due to the BlackBerry&#x27;s addictive nature. In the U.S., the high cost of data plans and relative rarity of devices with Wi-Fi capabilities that could avoid cellular data network usage kept adoption of smartphones mainly to business professionals and &quot;early adopters.&quot;

Outside the U.S. and Japan, Nokia was seeing success with its smartphones based on Symbian, originally developed by Psion for their personal organisers, and it was the most popular smartphone OS in Europe during the middle to late 2000s. Initially, Nokia&#x27;s Symbian smartphones were focused on business with the Eseries, similar to Windows Mobile and BlackBerry devices at the time. From 2002 onwards, Nokia started producing consumer-focused smartphones, popularized by the entertainment-focused Nseries. Until 2010, Symbian was the world&#x27;s most widely used smartphone operating system.

The touchscreen personal digital assistant (PDA)derived nature of adapted operating systems like Palm OS, the &quot;Pocket PC&quot; versions of what was later Windows Mobile, and the UIQ interface that was originally designed for pen-based PDAs on Symbian OS devices resulted in some early smartphones having stylus-based interfaces. These allowed for virtual keyboards and handwriting input, thus also allowing easy entry of Asian characters.

By the mid-2000s, the majority of smartphones had a physical QWERTY keyboard. Most used a &quot;keyboard bar&quot; form factor, like the BlackBerry line, Windows Mobile smartphones, Palm Treos, and some of the Nokia Eseries. A few hid their full physical QWERTY keyboard in a sliding form factor, like the Danger Hiptop line. Some even had only a numeric keypad using T9 text input, like the Nokia Nseries and other models in the Nokia Eseries. Resistive touchscreens with stylus-based interfaces could still be found on a few smartphones, like the Palm Treos, which had dropped their handwriting input after a few early models that were available in versions with Graffiti instead of a keyboard.

===Form factor and operating system shifts===

The late 2000s and early 2010s saw a shift in smartphone interfaces away from devices with physical keyboards and keypads to ones with large finger-operated capacitive touchscreens. The first phone of any kind with a large capacitive touchscreen was the LG Prada, announced by LG in December 2006. This was a fashionable feature phone created in collaboration with Italian luxury designer Prada with a 3&quot; 240 x 400 pixel screen, a 2-Megapixel digital camera with 144p video recording ability, an LED flash, and a miniature mirror for self portraits.

In January 2007, Apple Computer introduced the iPhone. It had a 3.5&quot; capacitive touchscreen with twice the common resolution of most smartphone screens at the time, and introduced multi-touch to phones, which allowed gestures such as &quot;pinching&quot; to zoom in or out on photos, maps, and web pages. The iPhone was notable as being the first device of its kind targeted at the mass market to abandon the use of a stylus, keyboard, or keypad typical of contemporary smartphones, instead using a large touchscreen for direct finger input as its main means of interaction.

The iPhone&#x27;s operating system was also a shift away from older operating systems (which older phones supported and which were adapted from PDAs and feature phones) to an operative system powerful enough to not require using a limited, stripped down web browser that can only render pages specially formatted using technologies such as WML, cHTML, or XHTML and instead ran a version of Apple&#x27;s Safari browser that could render full websites not specifically designed for mobile phones.

Later Apple shipped a software update that gave the iPhone a built-in on-device App Store allowing direct wireless downloads of third-party software. This kind of centralized App Store and free developer tools quickly became the new main paradigm for all smartphone platforms for software development, distribution, discovery, installation, and payment, in place of expensive developer tools that required official approval to use and a dependence on third-party sources providing applications for multiple platforms.

The advantages of a design with software powerful enough to support advanced applications and a large capacitive touchscreen affected the development of another smartphone OS platform, Android, with a more BlackBerry-like prototype device scrapped in favor of a touchscreen device with a slide-out physical keyboard, as Google&#x27;s engineers thought at the time that a touchscreen could not completely replace a physical keyboard and buttons. Android is based around a modified Linux kernel, again providing more power than mobile operating systems adapted from PDAs and feature phones. The first Android device, the horizontal-sliding HTC Dream, was released in September 2008.

In 2012, Asus started experimenting with a convertible docking system named &quot;PadFone&quot;, where the standalone handset can when necessary be inserted into a tablet-sized screen unit with integrated supportive battery and used as such.

In 2013 and 2014, Samsung experimented with the hybrid combination of compact camera and smartphone, releasing the Galaxy S4 Zoom and K Zoom, each equipped with integrated 10× optical zoom lens and manual parameter settings (including manual exposure and focus) years before these were widely adapted among smartphones. The S4 Zoom additionally has a rotary knob ring around the lens and a tripod mount.

While screen sizes have increased, manufacturers have attempted to make smartphones thinner at the expense of utility and sturdiness, since a thinner frame is more vulnerable to bending and has less space for components, namely battery capacity.

====Operating system competition====
The iPhone and later touchscreen-only Android devices together popularized the slate form factor, based on a large capacitive touchscreen as the sole means of interaction, and led to the decline of earlier, keyboard- and keypad-focused platforms. Later, navigation keys such as the home, &quot;back&quot;, &quot;menu&quot;, &quot;task&quot; and &quot;search&quot; buttons have also been increasingly replaced by nonphysical touch keys, then virtual, simulated on-screen navigation keys, commonly with access combinations such as a long press of the task key to simulate a short menu key press, as with home button to search. More recent &quot;bezel-less&quot; types have their screen surface space extended to the unit&#x27;s front bottom to compensate for the display area lost for simulating the navigation keys. While virtual keys offer more potential customizability, their location may be inconsistent among systems depending on screen rotation and software used.
Multiple vendors attempted to update or replace their existing smartphone platforms and devices to better-compete with Android and the iPhone; Palm unveiled a new platform known as webOS for its Palm Pre in late-2009 to replace Palm OS, which featured a focus on a task-based &quot;card&quot; metaphor and seamless synchronization and integration between various online services (as opposed to the then-conventional concept of a smartphone needing a PC to serve as a &quot;canonical, authoritative repository&quot; for user data). HP acquired Palm in 2010 and released several other webOS devices, including the Pre 3 and HP TouchPad tablet. As part of a proposed divestment of its consumer business to focus on enterprise software, HP abruptly ended development of future webOS devices in August 2011, and sold the rights to webOS to LG Electronics in 2013, for use as a smart TV platform.

Research in Motion introduced the vertical-sliding BlackBerry Torch and BlackBerry OS 6 in 2010, which featured a redesigned user interface, support for gestures such as pinch-to-zoom, and a new web browser based on the same WebKit rendering engine used by the iPhone. The following year, RIM released BlackBerry OS 7 and new models in the Bold and Torch ranges, which included a new Bold with a touchscreen alongside its keyboard, and the Torch 9860—the first BlackBerry phone to not include a physical keyboard. In 2013, it replaced the legacy BlackBerry OS with a revamped, QNX-based platform known as BlackBerry 10, with the all-touch BlackBerry Z10 and keyboard-equipped Q10 as launch devices.

In 2010, Microsoft unveiled a replacement for Windows Mobile known as Windows Phone, featuring a new touchscreen-centric user interface built around flat design and typography, a home screen with &quot;live tiles&quot; containing feeds of updates from apps, as well as integrated Microsoft Office apps. In February 2011, Nokia announced that it had entered into a major partnership with Microsoft, under which it would exclusively use Windows Phone on all of its future smartphones, and integrate Microsoft&#x27;s Bing search engine and Bing Maps (which, as part of the partnership, would also license Nokia Maps data) into all future devices. The announcement led to the abandonment of both Symbian, as well as MeeGo—a Linux-based mobile platform it was co-developing with Intel. Nokia&#x27;s low-end Lumia 520 saw strong demand and helped Windows Phone gain niche popularity in some markets, overtaking BlackBerry in global market share in 2013.

In mid-June 2012, Meizu released its mobile operating system, Flyme OS.

Many of these attempts to compete with Android and iPhone were short-lived. Over the course of the decade, the two platforms became a clear duopoly in smartphone sales and market share, with BlackBerry, Windows Phone, and other operating systems eventually stagnating to little or no measurable market share. In 2015, BlackBerry began to pivot away from its in-house mobile platforms in favor of producing Android devices, focusing on a security-enhanced distribution of the software. The following year, the company announced that it would also exit the hardware market to focus more on software and its enterprise middleware, and began to license the BlackBerry brand and its Android distribution to third-party OEMs such as TCL for future devices.

In September 2013, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire Nokia&#x27;s mobile device business for $7.1 billion, as part of a strategy under CEO Steve Ballmer for Microsoft to be a &quot;devices and services&quot; company. Despite the growth of Windows Phone and the Lumia range (which accounted for nearly 90% of all Windows Phone devices sold), the platform never had significant market share in the key U.S. market, and Microsoft was unable to maintain Windows Phone&#x27;s momentum in the years that followed, resulting in dwindling interest from users and app developers. After Balmer was succeeded by Satya Nadella (who has placed a larger focus on software and cloud computing) as CEO of Microsoft, it took a $7.6 billion write-off on the Nokia assets in July 2015, and laid off nearly the entire Microsoft Mobile unit in May 2016.

Prior to the completion of the sale to Microsoft, Nokia released a series of Android-derived smartphones for emerging markets known as Nokia X, which combined an Android-based platform with elements of Windows Phone and Nokia&#x27;s feature phone platform Asha, using Microsoft and Nokia services rather than Google.

===Camera advancements===

The first commercial camera phone was the Kyocera Visual Phone VP-210, released in Japan in May 1999. It was called a &quot;mobile videophone&quot; at the time, and had a 110,000-pixel front-facing camera. It could send up to two images per second over Japan&#x27;s Personal Handy-phone System (PHS) cellular network, and store up to 20 JPEG digital images, which could be sent over e-mail. The first mass-market camera phone was the J-SH04, a Sharp J-Phone model sold in Japan in November 2000. It could instantly transmit pictures via cell phone telecommunication.

By the mid-2000s, higher-end cell phones commonly had integrated digital cameras. In 2003 camera phones outsold stand-alone digital cameras, and in 2006 they outsold film and digital stand-alone cameras. Five billion camera phones were sold in five years, and by 2007 more than half of the installed base of all mobile phones were camera phones. Sales of separate cameras peaked in 2008.

Many early smartphones did not have cameras at all, and earlier models that had them had low performance and insufficient image and video quality that could not compete with budget pocket cameras and fulfill user&#x27;s needs. By the beginning of the 2010s almost all smartphones had an integrated digital camera. The decline in sales of stand-alone cameras accelerated due to the increasing use of smartphones with rapidly improving camera technology for casual photography, easier image manipulation, and abilities to directly share photos through the use of apps and web-based services. By 2011, cell phones with integrated cameras were selling hundreds of millions per year. In 2015, digital camera sales were 35.395 million units or only less than a third of digital camera sales numbers at their peak and also slightly less than film camera sold number at their peak.

Contributing to the rise in popularity of smartphones being used over dedicated cameras for photography, smaller pocket cameras have difficulty producing bokeh in images, but nowadays, some smartphones have dual-lens cameras that reproduce the bokeh effect easily, and can even rearrange the level of bokeh after shooting. This works by capturing multiple images with different focus settings, then combining the background of the main image with a macro focus shot.

In 2007, the Nokia N95 was notable as a smartphone that had a 5.0 Megapixel (MP) camera, when most others had cameras with around 3 MP or less than 2 MP. Some specialized feature phones like the LG Viewty, Samsung SGH-G800, and Sony Ericsson K850i, all released later that year, also had 5.0 MP cameras. By 2010, 5.0 MP cameras were common; a few smartphones had 8.0 MP cameras and the Nokia N8, Sony Ericsson Satio, and Samsung M8910 Pixon12 feature phone had 12 MP. The main camera of the 2009 Nokia N86 uniquely features a three-level aperture lens.

The Altek Leo, a 14-megapixel smartphone with 3x optical zoom lens and 720p HD video camera was released in late 2010.

In 2011, the same year the Nintendo 3DS was released, HTC unveiled the Evo 3D, a 3D phone with a dual five-megapixel rear camera setup for spatial imaging, among the earliest mobile phones with more than one rear camera.

The 2012 Samsung Galaxy S3 introduced the ability to capture photos using voice commands.

In 2012, Nokia announced and released the Nokia 808 PureView, featuring a 41-megapixel 1/1.2-inch sensor and a high-resolution f/2.4 Zeiss all-aspherical one-group lens. The high resolution enables four times of lossless digital zoom at 1080p and six times at 720p resolution, using image sensor cropping. The 2013 Nokia Lumia 1020 has a similar high-resolution camera setup, with the addition of optical image stabilization and manual camera settings years before common among high-end mobile phones, although lacking expandable storage that could be of use for accordingly high file sizes.

Mobile optical image stabilization was first introduced by Nokia in 2012 with the Lumia 920, and the earliest known smartphone with an optically stabilized front camera is the HTC 10 from 2016. Optical image stabilization enables prolonged exposure times for low-light photography and smoothing out handheld video shaking, since the appearance of shakes magnifies over a larger display such as a monitor or television set, which would be detrimental to the watching experience.

Since 2012, smartphones have become increasingly able to capture photos while filming. The resolution of those photos resolution may vary between devices. Samsung has used the highest image sensor resolution at the video&#x27;s aspect ratio, which at 16:9 is 6 Megapixels (3264 × 1836) on the Galaxy S3 and 9.6 Megapixels (4128 × 2322) on the Galaxy S4. The earliest iPhones with such functionality, iPhone 5 and 5s, captured simultaneous photos at 0.9 Megapixels (1280 × 720) while filming.

Starting in 2013 on the Xperia Z1, Sony experimented with real-time augmented reality camera effects such as floating text, virtual plants, volcano, and a dinosaur walking in the scenery. Apple later did similarly in 2017 with the iPhone X.

In the same year, iOS 7 introduced the later widely implemented viewfinder intuition, where exposure value can be adjusted through vertical swiping, after focus and exposure has been set by tapping, and even while locked after holding down for a brief moment. On some devices, this intuition may be restricted by software in video/slow motion modes and for front camera.

In 2013, Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S4 Zoom smartphone with the grip shape of a compact camera and a 10× optical zoom lens, as well as a rotary knob ring around the lens, as used on higher-end compact cameras, and an &quot;ISO 1222&quot; tripod mount. It is equipped with manual parameter settings, including for focus and exposure. The successor 2014 Samsung Galaxy K Zoom brought resolution and performance enhancements, but lacks the rotary knob and tripod mount to allow for a more smartphone-like shape with less protruding lens.

The 2014 Panasonic Lumix DMC-CM1 was another attempt at mixing mobile phone with compact camera, so much so that it inherited the Lumix brand. While lacking optical zoom, its image sensor has a format of 1&quot;, as used in high-end compact cameras such as the Lumix DMC-LX100 and Sony CyberShot DSC-RX100 series, with multiple times the surface size of a typical mobile camera image sensor, as well as support for light sensitivities of up to ISO 25600, well beyond the typical mobile camera light sensitivity range. , no successor has been released.

In 2013 and 2014, HTC experimentally traded in pixel count for pixel surface size on their One M7 and M8, both with only four megapixels, marketed as &quot;UltraPixel&quot;, citing improved brightness and less noise in low light, though the more recent One M8 lacks optical image stabilization.

The One M8 additionally was one of the earliest smartphones to be equipped with a dual camera setup. Its software allows generating visual spatial effects such as 3D panning, weather effects, and focus adjustment (&quot;UFocus&quot;), simulating the postphotographic selective focusing capability of images produced by a light-field camera. HTC returned to a high-megapixel single-camera setup on the 2015 One M9.

Meanwhile, in 2014, LG Mobile started experimenting with time-of-flight camera functionality, where a rear laser beam that measures distance accelerates autofocus.

Phase-detection autofocus was increasingly adapted throughout the mid-2010s, allowing for quicker and more accurate focusing than contrast detection.

In 2016, Apple introduced the iPhone 7 Plus, one of the phones to popularize a dual camera setup. The iPhone 7 Plus included a main 12 MP camera along with a 12 MP telephoto camera. In early 2018 Huawei released a new flagship phone, the Huawei P20 Pro, one of the first triple camera lens setups with Leica optics. In late 2018, Samsung released a new mid-range smartphone, the Galaxy A9 (2018) with the world&#x27;s first quad camera setup. The Nokia 9 PureView was released in 2019 featuring a penta-lens camera system.

2019 saw the commercialization of high resolution sensors, which use pixel binning to capture more light. 48 MP and 64 MP sensors developed by Sony and Samsung are commonly used by several manufacturers. 108 MP sensors were first implemented in late 2019 and early 2020.

====Video resolution====

With stronger getting chipsets to handle computing workload demands at higher pixel rates, mobile video resolution and framerate has caught up with dedicated consumer-grade cameras over years.

In 2009, the Samsung Omnia HD became the first mobile phone with 720p HD video recording. In the same year, Apple brought video recording initially to the iPhone 3GS, at 480p, whereas the 2007 original iPhone and 2008 iPhone 3G lacked video recording entirely.

720p was more widely adapted in 2010, on smartphones such as the original Samsung Galaxy S, Sony Ericsson Xperia X10, iPhone 4, and HTC Desire HD.

The early 2010s brought a steep increase in mobile video resolution. 1080p mobile video recording was achieved in 2011 on the Samsung Galaxy S2, HTC Sensation, and iPhone 4s.

In 2012 and 2013, select devices with 720p filming at 60 frames per second were released: the Asus PadFone 2 and HTC One M7, unlike flagships of Samsung, Sony, and Apple. However, the 2013 Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom does support it.

In 2013, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 introduced 2160p (4K) video recording at 30 frames per second, as well as 1080p doubled to 60 frames per second for smoothness.

Other vendors adapted 2160p recording in 2014, including the optically stabilized LG G3. Apple first implemented it in late 2015 on the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.

The framerate at 2160p was widely doubled to 60 in 2017 and 2018, starting with the iPhone 8, Galaxy S9, LG G7, and OnePlus 6.

Sufficient computing performance of chipsets and image sensor resolution and its reading speeds have enabled mobile 4320p (8K) filming in 2020, introduced with the Samsung Galaxy S20 and Redmi K30 Pro, though some upper resolution levels were foregone (skipped) throughout development, including 1440p (&quot;2.5K&quot;), 2880p (5K), and 3240p (6K), except 1440p on Samsung Galaxy front cameras.

;Mid-class
Among mid-range smartphone series, the introduction of higher video resolutions was initially delayed by two to three years compared to flagship counterparts. 720p was widely adapted in 2012, including with the Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini, Sony Xperia go, and 1080p in 2013 on the Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini and HTC One mini.

The proliferation of video resolutions beyond 1080p has been postponed by several years. The mid-class Sony Xperia M5 supported 2160p filming in 2016, whereas Samsung&#x27;s mid-class series such as the Galaxy J and A series were strictly limited to 1080p in resolution and 30 frames per second at any resolution for six years until around 2019, whether and how much for technical reasons is unclear.

;Setting
A lower video resolution setting may be desirable to extend recording time by reducing space storage and power consumption.

The camera software of some smartphones is equipped with separate controls for resolution, frame rate, and bit rate. An example of a smartphone with these controls is the LG V10.

====Slow motion video====
A distinction between different camera software is the method used to store high frame rate video footage, with more recent phones retaining both the image sensor&#x27;s original output frame rate and audio, while earlier phones do not record audio and stretch the video so it can be played back slowly at default speed.

While the stretched encoding method used on earlier phones enables slow motion playback on video player software that lacks manual playback speed control, typically found on older devices, if the aim were to achieve a slow motion effect, the real-time method used by more recent phones offers greater versatility for video editing, where slowed down portions of the footage can be freely selected by the user, and exported into a separate video. A rudimentary video editing software for this purpose is usually pre-installed. The video can optionally be played back at normal (real-time) speed, acting as usual video.

;Development
The earliest smartphone known to feature a slow motion mode is the 2009 Samsung i8000 Omnia II, which can record at QVGA (320×240) at 120 fps (frames per second). Slow motion is not available on the Galaxy S1, Galaxy S2, Galaxy Note 1, and Galaxy S3 flagships.

In early 2012, the HTC One X allowed 768×432 pixel slow motion filming at an undocumented frame rate. The output footage has been measured as a third of real-time speed.

In late 2012, the Galaxy Note 2 brought back slow motion, with D1 (720 × 480) at 120 fps. In early 2013, the Galaxy S4 and HTC One M7 recorded at that frame rate with 800 × 450, followed by the Note 3 and iPhone 5s with 720p (1280 × 720) in late 2013, the latter of which retaines audio and original sensor frame rate, as with all later iPhones. In early 2014, the Sony Xperia Z2 and HTC One M8 adapted this resolution as well. In late 2014, the iPhone 6 doubled the frame rate to 240 fps, and in late 2015, the iPhone 6s added support for 1080p (1920 × 1080) at 120 frames per second. In early 2015, the Galaxy S6 became the first Samsung mobile phone to retain the sensor framerate and audio, and in early 2016, the Galaxy S7 became the first Samsung mobile phone with 240 fps recording, also at 720p.

In early 2015, the &quot;MT6795&quot; chipset by MediaTek promised 1080p@480 fps video recording. The project&#x27;s status remains indefinite.

Since early 2017, starting with the Sony Xperia XZ, smartphones have been released with a slow motion mode that unsustainably records at framerates multiple times as high, by temporarily storing frames on the image sensor&#x27;s internal burst memory. Such a recording lasts a few real-time seconds at most.

In late 2017, the iPhone 8 brought 1080p at 240 fps, as well as 2160p at 60 fps, followed by the Galaxy S9 in early 2018. In mid-2018, the OnePlus 6 brought 720p at 480 fps, sustainable for one minute.

In early 2021, the OnePlus 9 Pro became the first phone with 2160p at 120 fps.

====HDR video====
The first smartphones to record HDR video were the early 2013 Sony Xperia Z and mid-2013 Xperia Z Ultra, followed by the early 2014 Galaxy S5, all at 1080p.

====Audio recording====
Mobile phones with multiple microphones usually allow video recording with stereo audio for spaciality, with Samsung, Sony, and HTC initially implementing it in 2012 on their Samsung Galaxy S3, Sony Xperia S, and HTC One X. Apple implemented stereo audio starting with the 2018 iPhone Xs family and iPhone XR.

====Front cameras====
=====Photo=====
Emphasis is being put on the front camera since the mid-2010s, where front cameras have reached resolutions as high as typical rear cameras, such as the 2015 LG G4 (8 megapixels), Sony Xperia C5 Ultra (13 megapixels), and 2016 Sony Xperia XA Ultra (16 megapixels, optically stabilized). The 2015 LG V10 brought a dual front camera system where the second has a wider angle for group photography. Samsung implemented a front-camera sweep panorama (&quot;panorama selfie&quot;) feature since the Galaxy Note 4 to extend the field of view.

=====Video=====
In 2012, the Galaxy S3 and iPhone 5 brought 720p HD front video recording (at 30 fps). In early 2013, the Samsung Galaxy S4, HTC One M7 and Sony Xperia Z brought 1080p Full HD at that framerate, and in late 2014, the Galaxy Note 4 introduced 1440p video recording on the front camera. Apple adapted 1080p front camera video with the late 2016 iPhone 7.

In 2019, smartphones started adapting 2160p 4K video recording on the front camera, six years after rear camera 2160p commenced with the Galaxy Note 3.

===Display advancements===
In the early 2010s, larger smartphones with screen sizes of at least diagonal, dubbed &quot;phablets&quot;, began to achieve popularity, with the 2011 Samsung Galaxy Note series gaining notably wide adoption. In 2013, Huawei launched the Huawei Mate series, sporting a HD (1280 x 720) IPS+ LCD display, which was considered to be quite large at the time.

Some companies began to release smartphones in 2013 incorporating flexible displays to create curved form factors, such as the Samsung Galaxy Round and LG G Flex.

By 2014, 1440p displays began to appear on high-end smartphones. In 2015, Sony released the Xperia Z5 Premium, featuring a 4K resolution display, although only images and videos could actually be rendered at that resolution (all other software was shown at 1080p).

New trends for smartphone displays began to emerge in 2017, with both LG and Samsung releasing flagship smartphones (LG G6 and Galaxy S8), utilizing displays with taller aspect ratios than the common 16:9 ratio, and a high screen-to-body ratio, also known as a &quot;bezel-less design&quot;. These designs allow the display to have a larger diagonal measurement, but with a slimmer width than 16:9 displays with an equivalent screen size.
Another trend popularized in 2017 were displays containing tab-like cut-outs at the top-centre—colloquially known as a &quot;notch&quot;—to contain the front-facing camera, and sometimes other sensors typically located along the top bezel of a device. These designs allow for &quot;edge-to-edge&quot; displays that take up nearly the entire height of the device, with little to no bezel along the top, and sometimes a minimal bottom bezel as well. This design characteristic appeared almost simultaneously on the Sharp Aquos S2 and the Essential Phone, which featured small circular tabs for their cameras, followed just a month later by the iPhone X, which used a wider tab to contain a camera and facial scanning system known as Face ID. The 2016 LG V10 had a precursor to the concept, with a portion of the screen wrapped around the camera area in the top-left corner, and the resulting area marketed as a &quot;second&quot; display that could be used for various supplemental features.

Other variations of the practice later emerged, such as a &quot;hole-punch&quot; camera (such as those of the Honor View 20, and Samsung&#x27;s Galaxy A8s and Galaxy S10)—eschewing the tabbed &quot;notch&quot; for a circular or rounded-rectangular cut-out within the screen instead, while Oppo released the first &quot;all-screen&quot; phones with no notches at all, including one with a mechanical front camera that pops up from the top of the device (Find X), and a 2019 prototype for a front-facing camera that can be embedded and hidden below the display, using a special partially-translucent screen structure that allows light to reach the image sensor below the panel. The first implementation was the ZTE Axon 20 5G, with a 32 MP sensor manufactured by Visionox.

Displays supporting refresh rates higher than 60 Hz (such as 90 Hz or 120 Hz) also began to appear on smartphones in 2017; initially confined to &quot;gaming&quot; smartphones such as the Razer Phone (2017) and Asus ROG Phone (2018), they later became more common on flagship phones such as the Pixel 4 (2019) and Samsung Galaxy S21 series (2021). Higher refresh rates allow for smoother motion and lower input latency, but often at the cost of battery life. As such, the device may offer a means to disable high refresh rates, or be configured to automatically reduce the refresh rate when there is low on-screen motion.

====Multi-tasking====
An early implementation of multiple simultaneous tasks on a smartphone display are the picture-in-picture video playback mode (&quot;pop-up play&quot;) and &quot;live video list&quot; with playing video thumbnails of the 2012 Samsung Galaxy S3, the former of which was later delivered to the 2011 Samsung Galaxy Note through a software update. Later that year, a split-screen mode was implemented on the Galaxy Note 2, later retrofitted on the Galaxy S3 through the &quot;premium suite upgrade&quot;.

The earliest implementation of desktop and laptop-like windowing was on the 2013 Samsung Galaxy Note 3.

===Foldable smartphones===
Smartphones utilizing flexible displays were theorized as possible once manufacturing costs and production processes were feasible. In November 2018, the startup company Royole unveiled the first commercially available foldable smartphone, the Royole FlexPai. Also that month, Samsung presented a prototype phone featuring an &quot;Infinity Flex Display&quot; at its developers conference, with a smaller, outer display on its &quot;cover&quot;, and a larger, tablet-sized display when opened. Samsung stated that it also had to develop a new polymer material to coat the display as opposed to glass. Samsung officially announced the Galaxy Fold, based on the previously demonstrated prototype, in February 2019 for an originally-scheduled release in late-April. Due to various durability issues with the display and hinge systems encountered by early reviewers, the release of the Galaxy Fold was delayed to September to allow for design changes.

In November 2019, Motorola unveiled a variation of the concept with its re-imagining of the Razr, using a horizontally-folding display to create a clamshell form factor inspired by its previous feature phone range of the same name. Samsung would unveil a similar device known as the Galaxy Z Flip the following February.

===Other developments in the 2010s===
The first smartphone with a fingerprint reader was the Motorola Atrix 4G in 2011. In September 2013, the iPhone 5S was unveiled as the first smartphone on a major U.S. carrier since the Atrix to feature this technology. Once again, the iPhone popularized this concept. One of the barriers of fingerprint reading amongst consumers was security concerns, however Apple was able to address these concerns by encrypting this fingerprint data onto the A7 Processor located inside the phone as well as make sure this information could not be accessed by third-party applications and is not stored in iCloud or Apple servers

In 2012, Samsung introduced the Galaxy S3 (GT-i9300) with retrofittable wireless charging, pop-up video playback, 4G-LTE variant (GT-i9305) quad-core processor.

In 2013, Fairphone launched its first &quot;socially ethical&quot; smartphone at the London Design Festival to address concerns regarding the sourcing of materials in the manufacturing followed by Shiftphone in 2015. In late 2013, QSAlpha commenced production of a smartphone designed entirely around security, encryption and identity protection.

In October 2013, Motorola Mobility announced Project Ara, a concept for a modular smartphone platform that would allow users to customize and upgrade their phones with add-on modules that attached magnetically to a frame. Ara was retained by Google following its sale of Motorola Mobility to Lenovo, but was shelved in 2016. That year, LG and Motorola both unveiled smartphones featuring a limited form of modularity for accessories; the LG G5 allowed accessories to be installed via the removal of its battery compartment, while the Moto Z utilizes accessories attached magnetically to the rear of the device.

Microsoft, expanding upon the concept of Motorola&#x27;s short-lived &quot;Webtop&quot;, unveiled functionality for its Windows 10 operating system for phones that allows supported devices to be docked for use with a PC-styled desktop environment.

Samsung and LG used to be the &quot;last standing&quot; manufacturers to offer flagship devices with user-replaceable batteries.
But in 2015, Samsung succumbed to the minimalism trend set by Apple, introducing the Galaxy S6 without a user-replaceable battery.
In addition, Samsung was criticised for pruning long-standing features such as MHL, MicroUSB 3.0, water resistance and MicroSD card support, of which the latter two came back in 2016 with the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge.

, the global median for smartphone ownership was 43%. Statista forecast that 2.87 billion people would own smartphones in 2020.

Within the same decade, rapid deployment of LTE cellular network and general availability of smartphones have increased popularity of the streaming television services, and the corresponding mobile TV apps.

Major technologies that began to trend in 2016 included a focus on virtual reality and augmented reality experiences catered towards smartphones, the newly introduced USB-C connector, and improving LTE technologies.

In 2016, adjustable screen resolution known from desktop operating systems was introduced to smartphones for power saving, whereas variable screen refresh rates were popularized in 2020.

In 2018, the first smartphones featuring fingerprint readers embedded within OLED displays were announced, followed in 2019 by an implementation using an ultrasonic sensor on the Samsung Galaxy S10.

In 2019, the majority of smartphones released have more than one camera, are waterproof with IP67 and IP68 ratings, and unlock using facial recognition or fingerprint scanners.

Designs first implemented by Apple have been replicated by other vendors several times. These include a sealed body that does not allow replacing the battery, a lack of the physical audio connector (since the iPhone 7 from 2016), a screen with a cut-out area at the top for the earphone and front-facing camera and sensors (colloquially known as &quot;notch&quot;; since the iPhone X from 2017), the exclusion of a charging wall adapter from the scope of delivery (since the iPhone 12 from 2019), and a camera user interface with circular and usually solid-colour shutter button and a camera mode selector using perpendicular text and separate camera modes for photo and video (since iOS 7 from 2013).

===Other developments in the 2020s===
In 2020, the first smartphones featuring high-speed 5G network capability were announced.

Since 2020, smartphones have decreasingly been shipped with rudimentary accessories like a power adapter and headphones that have historically been almost invariably within the scope of delivery. This trend was initiated with Apple&#x27;s iPhone 12, followed by Samsung and Xiaomi on the Galaxy S21 and Mi 11 respectively, months after having mocked the same through advertisements. The reason cited is reducing environmental footprint, though reaching raised charging rates supported by newer models demands a new charger shipped through separate packaging with its own environmental footprint.
With the development of the PinePhone and Librem 5 in the 2020s, there are intensified efforts to make open source GNU/Linux for smartphones a major alternative to iOS and Android. Moreover, associated software enabled convergence (beyond convergent and hybrid apps) by allowing the smartphones to be used like a desktop computer when connected to a keyboard, mouse and monitor.

In the early 2020s, manufacturers began to integrate satellite connectivity into smartphone devices for use in remote areas, where local terrestrial communication infrastructures, such as landline and cellular networks, are not available. Due to the antenna limitations in the conventional phones, in the early stages of implementation satellite connectivity would be limited to the satellite messaging and satellite emergency services.

==Hardware==

A typical smartphone contains a number of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) chips, which in turn contain billions of tiny MOS field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). A typical smartphone contains the following MOS IC chips:

* Application processor (CMOS system-on-a-chip)
* Flash memory (floating-gate MOS memory)
* Cellular modem (baseband RF CMOS)
* RF transceiver (RF CMOS)
* Phone camera image sensor (CMOS image sensor)
* Power management integrated circuit (power MOSFETs)
* Display driver (LCD or LED driver)
* Wireless communication chips (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS receiver)
* Sound chip (audio codec and power amplifier)
* Gyroscope
* Capacitive touchscreen controller (ASIC and DSP)
* RF power amplifier (LDMOS)

Some are also equipped with an FM radio receiver, a hardware notification LED, and an infrared transmitter for use as remote control. A few models have additional sensors such as thermometer for measuring ambient temperature, hygrometer for humidity, and a sensor for ultraviolet ray measurement.

A few smartphones designed around specific purposes are equipped with uncommon hardware such as a projector (Samsung Beam i8520 and Samsung Galaxy Beam i8530), optical zoom lenses (Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom and Samsung Galaxy K Zoom), thermal camera, and even PMR446 (walkie-talkie radio) transceiver.

===Central processing unit===
Smartphones have central processing units (CPUs), similar to those in computers, but optimised to operate in low power environments. In smartphones, the CPU is typically integrated in a CMOS (complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor) system-on-a-chip (SoC) application processor.

The performance of mobile CPU depends not only on the clock rate (generally given in multiples of hertz) but also on the memory hierarchy. Because of these challenges, the performance of mobile phone CPUs is often more appropriately given by scores derived from various standardized tests to measure the real effective performance in commonly used applications.

===Buttons===

Smartphones are typically equipped with a power button and volume buttons. Some pairs of volume buttons are unified. Some are equipped with a dedicated camera shutter button. Units for outdoor use may be equipped with an &quot;SOS&quot; emergency call and &quot;PTT&quot; (push-to-talk button). The presence of physical front-side buttons such as the home and navigation buttons has decreased throughout the 2010s, increasingly becoming replaced by capacitive touch sensors and simulated (on-screen) buttons.

As with classic mobile phones, early smartphones such as the Samsung Omnia II were equipped with buttons for accepting and declining phone calls. Due to the advancements of functionality besides phone calls, these have increasingly been replaced by navigation buttons such as &quot;menu&quot; (also known as &quot;options&quot;), &quot;back&quot;, and &quot;tasks&quot;. Some early 2010s smartphones such as the HTC Desire were additionally equipped with a &quot;Search&quot; button (🔍) for quick access to a web search engine or apps&#x27; internal search feature.

Since 2013, smartphones&#x27; home buttons started integrating fingerprint scanners, starting with the iPhone 5s and Samsung Galaxy S5.

Functions may be assigned to button combinations. For example, screenshots can usually be taken using the home and power buttons, with a short press on iOS and one-second holding Android OS, the two most popular mobile operating systems. On smartphones with no physical home button, usually the volume-down button is instead pressed with the power button. Some smartphones have a screenshot and possibly screencast shortcuts in the navigation button bar or the power button menu.

===Display===
One of the main characteristics of smartphones is the screen. Depending on the device&#x27;s design, the screen fills most or nearly all of the space on a device&#x27;s front surface. Many smartphone displays have an aspect ratio of 16:9, but taller aspect ratios became more common in 2017, as well as the aim to eliminate bezels by extending the display surface to as close to the edges as possible.

====Screen sizes====
Screen sizes are measured in diagonal inches. Phones with screens larger than 5.2 inches are often called &quot;phablets&quot;. Smartphones with screens over 4.5 inches in size are commonly difficult to use with only a single hand, since most thumbs cannot reach the entire screen surface; they may need to be shifted around in the hand, held in one hand and manipulated by the other, or used in place with both hands. Due to design advances, some modern smartphones with large screen sizes and &quot;edge-to-edge&quot; designs have compact builds that improve their ergonomics, while the shift to taller aspect ratios have resulted in phones that have larger screen sizes whilst maintaining the ergonomics associated with smaller 16:9 displays.

====Panel types====
Liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) and organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays are the most common. Some displays are integrated with pressure-sensitive digitizers, such as those developed by Wacom and Samsung, and Apple&#x27;s Force Touch system. A few phones, such as the YotaPhone prototype, are equipped with a low-power electronic paper rear display, as used in e-book readers.

====Alternative input methods====

Some devices are equipped with additional input methods such as a stylus for higher precision input and hovering detection or a self-capacitive touch screens layer for floating finger detection. The latter has been implemented on few phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S4, Note 3, S5, Alpha, and Sony Xperia Sola, making the Galaxy Note 3 the only smartphone with both so far.

Hovering can enable preview tooltips such as on the video player&#x27;s seek bar, in text messages, and quick contacts on the dial pad, as well as lock screen animations, and the simulation of a hovering mouse cursor on web sites.

Some styluses support hovering as well and are equipped with a button for quick access to relevant tools such as digital post-it notes and highlighting of text and elements when dragging while pressed, resembling drag selection using a computer mouse. Some series such as the Samsung Galaxy Note series and LG G Stylus series have an integrated tray to store the stylus in.

Few devices such as the iPhone 6s until iPhone Xs and Huawei Mate S are equipped with a pressure-sensitive touch screen, where the pressure may be used to simulate a gas pedal in video games, access to preview windows and shortcut menus, controlling the typing cursor, and a weight scale, the latest of which has been rejected by Apple from the App Store.

Some early 2010s HTC smartphones such as the HTC Desire (Bravo) and HTC Legend are equipped with an optical track pad for scrolling and selection.

====Notification light====
Many smartphones except Apple iPhones are equipped with low-power light-emitting diodes besides the screen that are able to notify the user about incoming messages, missed calls, low battery levels, and facilitate locating the mobile phone in darkness, with marginial power consumption.

To distinguish between the sources of notifications, the colour combination and blinking pattern can vary. Usually three diodes in red, green, and blue (RGB) are able to create a multitude of colour combinations.

===Sensors===
Smartphones are equipped with a multitude of sensors to enable system features and third-party applications.

====Common sensors====
Accelerometers and gyroscopes enable automatic control of screen rotation. Uses by third-party software include bubble level simulation. An ambient light sensor allows for automatic screen brightness and contrast adjustment, and an RGB sensor enables the adaption of screen colour.

Many mobile phones are also equipped with a barometer sensor to measure air pressure, such as Samsung since 2012 with the Galaxy S3, and Apple since 2014 with the iPhone 6. It allows estimating and detecting changes in altitude.

A magnetometer can act as a digital compass by measuring Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.

====Rare sensors====
Samsung equips their flagship smartphones since the 2014 Galaxy S5 and Galaxy Note 4 with a heart rate sensor to assist in fitness-related uses and act as a shutter key for the front-facing camera.

So far, only the 2013 Samsung Galaxy S4 and Note 3 are equipped with an ambient temperature sensor and a humidity sensor, and only the Note 4 with an ultraviolet radiation sensor which could warn the user about excessive exposure.

A rear infrared laser beam for distance measurement can enable time-of-flight camera functionality with accelerated autofocus, as implemented on select LG mobile phones starting with LG G3 and LG V10.

Due to their currently rare occurrence among smartphones, not much software to utilize these sensors has been developed yet.

===Storage===
While eMMC (&quot;embedded multi media card&quot;) flash storage was most commonly used in mobile phones, its successor, UFS (&quot;Universal Flash Storage&quot;) with higher transfer rates emerged throughout the 2010s for upper-class devices.

;Capacity
While the internal storage capacity of mobile phones has been near-stagnant during the first half of the 2010s, it has increased steeper during its second half, with Samsung for example increasing the available internal storage options of their flagship class units from 32 GB to 512 GB within only 2 years between 2016 and 2018.

====Memory cards====
The space for data storage of some mobile phones can be expanded using MicroSD memory cards, whose capacity has multiplied throughout the 2010s (→ ). Benefits over USB on the go storage and cloud storage include offline availability and privacy, not reserving and protruding from the charging port, no connection instability or latency, no dependence on voluminous data plans, and preservation of the limited rewriting cycles of the device&#x27;s permanent internal storage. Large amounts of data can be moved immediately between devices by changing memory cards, large-scale data backups can be created offline, and data can be read externally should the smartphone be inoperable.

In case of technical defects which make the device unusable or unbootable as a result of liquid damage, fall damage, screen damage, bending damage, malware, or bogus system updates, etc., data stored on the memory card is likely rescueable externally, while data on the inaccessible internal storage would be lost. A memory card can usually immediately be re-used in a different memory-card-enabled device with no necessity for prior file transfers.

Some dual-SIM mobile phones are equipped with a hybrid slot, where one of the two slots can be occupied by either a SIM card or a memory card. Some models, typically of higher end, are equipped with three slots including one dedicated memory card slot, for simultaneous dual-SIM and memory card usage.

;Physical location
The location of both SIM and memory card slots vary among devices, where they might be located accessibly behind the back cover or else behind the battery, the latter of which denies hot swapping.

Mobile phones with non-removable rear cover typically house SIM and memory cards in a small tray on the handset&#x27;s frame, ejected by inserting a needle tool into a pinhole.

Some earlier mid-range phones such as the 2011 Samsung Galaxy Fit and Ace have a sideways memory card slot on the frame covered by a cap that can be opened without tool.

====File transfer====
Originally, mass storage access was commonly enabled to computers through USB. Over time, mass storage access was removed, leaving the Media Transfer Protocol as protocol for USB file transfer, due to its non-exclusive access ability where the computer is able to access the storage without it being locked away from the mobile phone&#x27;s software for the duration of the connection, and no necessity for common file system support, as communication is done through an abstraction layer.

However, unlike mass storage, Media Transfer Protocol lacks parallelism, meaning that only a single transfer can run at a time, for which other transfer requests need to wait to finish. This, for example, denies browsing photos and playing back videos from the device during an active file transfer. Some programs and devices lack support for MTP. In addition, the direct access and random access of files through MTP is not supported. Any file is wholly downloaded from the device before opened.

===Sound===
Some audio quality enhancing features, such as Voice over LTE and HD Voice have appeared and are often available on newer smartphones. Sound quality can remain a problem due to the design of the phone, the quality of the cellular network and compression algorithms used in long-distance calls. Audio quality can be improved using a VoIP application over Wi-Fi. Cellphones have small speakers so that the user can use a speakerphone feature and talk to a person on the phone without holding it to their ear. The small speakers can also be used to listen to digital audio files of music or speech or watch videos with an audio component, without holding the phone close to the ear. However, integrated speakers may be small and of restricted sound quality to conserve space.

Some mobile phones such as the HTC One M8 and the Sony Xperia Z2 are equipped with stereophonic speakers to create spacial sound when in horizontal orientation.

====Audio connector====
The 3.5mm headphone receptible (coll. &quot;headphone jack&quot;) allows the immediate operation of passive headphones, as well as connection to other external auxiliary audio appliances. Among devices equipped with the connector, it is more commonly located at the bottom (charging port side) than on the top of the device.

The decline of the connector&#x27;s availability among newly released mobile phones among all major vendors commenced in 2016 with its lack on the Apple iPhone 7. An adapter reserving the charging port can retrofit the plug.

Battery-powered, wireless Bluetooth headphones are an alternative. Those tend to be costlier however due to their need for internal hardware such as a Bluetooth transceiver and a battery with a charging controller, and a Bluetooth coupling is required ahead of each operation.

===Battery===
Smartphones typically feature lithium-ion or lithium-polymer batteries due to their high energy densities.

Batteries chemically wear down as a result of repeated charging and discharging throughout ordinary usage, losing both energy capacity and output power, which results in loss of processing speeds followed by system outages. Battery capacity may be reduced to 80% after few hundred recharges, and the drop in performance accelerates with time.
Some mobile phones are designed with batteries that can be interchanged upon expiration by the end user, usually by opening the back cover. While such a design had initially been used in most mobile phones, including those with touch screen that were not Apple iPhones, it has largely been usurped throughout the 2010s by permanently built-in, non-replaceable batteries; a design practice criticized for planned obsolescence.

====Charging====
Due to limitations of electrical currents that existing USB cables&#x27; copper wires could handle, charging protocols which make use of elevated voltages such as Qualcomm Quick Charge and MediaTek Pump Express have been developed to increase the power throughput for faster charging, to maximize the usage time without restricted ergonomy and to minimize the time a device needs to be attached to a power source.

The smartphone&#x27;s integrated charge controller (IC) requests the elevated voltage from a supported charger. &quot;VOOC&quot; by Oppo, also marketed as &quot;dash charge&quot;, took the counter approach and increased current to cut out some heat produced from internally regulating the arriving voltage in the end device down to the battery&#x27;s charging terminal voltage, but is incompatible with existing USB cables, as it requires the thicker copper wires of high-current USB cables. Later, USB Power Delivery (&quot;USB-PD&quot;) was developed with the aim to standardize the negotiation of charging parameters across devices of up to 100 Watts, but is only supported on cables with USB-C on both endings due to the connector&#x27;s dedicated PD channels.

While charging rates have been increasing, with 15 watts in 2014, 20 Watts in 2016, and 45 watts in 2018, the power throughput may be throttled down significantly during operation of the device.

Wireless charging has been widely adapted, allowing for intermittent recharging without wearing down the charging port through frequent reconnection, with &quot;Qi&quot; being the most common standard, followed by Powermat. Due to the lower efficiency of wireless power transmission, charging rates are below that of wired charging, and more heat is produced at similar charging rates.

By the end of 2017, smartphone battery life has become generally adequate; however, earlier smartphone battery life was poor due to the weak batteries that could not handle the significant power requirements of the smartphones&#x27; computer systems and color screens.

Smartphone users purchase additional chargers for use outside the home, at work, and in cars and by buying portable external &quot;battery packs&quot;. External battery packs include generic models which are connected to the smartphone with a cable, and custom-made models that &quot;piggyback&quot; onto a smartphone&#x27;s case. In 2016, Samsung had to recall millions of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphones due to an explosive battery issue. For consumer convenience, wireless charging stations have been introduced in some hotels, bars, and other public spaces.

====Power management====
A technique to minimize power consumption is the panel self-refresh, whereby the image to be shown on the display is not sent at all times from the processor to the integrated controller (IC) of the display component, but only if the information on screen is changed. The display&#x27;s integrated controller instead memorizes the last screen contents and refreshes the screen by itself. This technology was introduced around 2014 and has reduced power consumption by a few hundred milliwatts.

===Cameras===
Cameras have become standard features of smartphones. phone cameras are now a highly competitive area of differentiation between models, with advertising campaigns commonly based on a focus on the quality or capabilities of a device&#x27;s main cameras.

Images are usually saved in the JPEG file format; some high-end phones since the mid-2010s also have RAW imaging capability.

====Space constraints====
Typically smartphones have at least one main rear-facing camera and a lower-resolution front-facing camera for &quot;selfies&quot; and video chat. Owing to the limited depth available in smartphones for image sensors and optics, rear-facing cameras are often housed in a &quot;bump&quot; that is thicker than the rest of the phone. Since increasingly thin mobile phones have more abundant horizontal space than the depth that is necessary and used in dedicated cameras for better lenses, there is additionally a trend for phone manufacturers to include multiple cameras, with each optimized for a different purpose (telephoto, wide angle, etc.).

Viewed from back, rear cameras are commonly located at the top center or top left corner. A cornered location benefits by not requiring other hardware to be packed around the camera module while increasing ergonomy, as the lens is less likely to be covered when held horizontally.

Modern advanced smartphones have cameras with optical image stabilisation (OIS), larger sensors, bright lenses, and even optical zoom plus RAW images. HDR, &quot;Bokeh mode&quot; with multi lenses and multi-shot night modes are now also familiar. Many new smartphone camera features are being enabled via computational photography image processing and multiple specialized lenses rather than larger sensors and lenses, due to the constrained space available inside phones that are being made as slim as possible.

====Dedicated camera button====
Some mobile phones such as the Samsung i8000 Omnia 2, some Nokia Lumias and some Sony Xperias are equipped with a physical camera shutter button.

Those with two pressure levels resemble the point-and-shoot intuition of dedicated compact cameras. The camera button may be used as a shortcut to quickly and ergonomically launch the camera software, as it is located more accessibly inside a pocket than the power button.

===Back cover materials===
Back covers of smartphones are typically made of polycarbonate, aluminium, or glass. Polycarbonate back covers may be glossy or matte, and possibly textured, like dotted on the Galaxy S5 or leathered on the Galaxy Note 3 and Note 4.

While polycarbonate back covers may be perceived as less &quot;premium&quot; among fashion- and trend-oriented users, its utilitarian strengths and technical benefits include durability and shock absorption, greater elasticity against permanent bending like metal, inability to shatter like glass, which facilitates designing it removable; better manufacturing cost efficiency, and no blockage of radio signals or wireless power like metal.

===Accessories===
A wide range of accessories are sold for smartphones, including cases, memory cards, screen protectors, chargers, wireless power stations, USB On-The-Go adapters (for connecting USB drives and or, in some cases, a HDMI cable to an external monitor), MHL adapters, add-on batteries, power banks, headphones, combined headphone-microphones (which, for example, allow a person to privately conduct calls on the device without holding it to the ear), and Bluetooth-enabled powered speakers that enable users to listen to media from their smartphones wirelessly.

Cases range from relatively inexpensive rubber or soft plastic cases which provide moderate protection from bumps and good protection from scratches to more expensive, heavy-duty cases that combine a rubber padding with a hard outer shell. Some cases have a &quot;book&quot;-like form, with a cover that the user opens to use the device; when the cover is closed, it protects the screen. Some &quot;book&quot;-like cases have additional pockets for credit cards, thus enabling people to use them as wallets.

Accessories include products sold by the manufacturer of the smartphone and compatible products made by other manufacturers.

However, some companies, like Apple, stopped including chargers with smartphones in order to &quot;reduce carbon footprint&quot;, etc., causing many customers to pay extra for charging adapters.

==Software==
===Mobile operating systems===
A mobile operating system (or mobile OS) is an operating system for phones, tablets, smartwatches, or other mobile devices. Globally, Android and IOS are the two most used mobile operating systems based on usage share, with the former having been the best selling OS globally on all devices since 2013.

Mobile operating systems combine features of a personal computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use; usually including, and most of the following considered essential in modern mobile systems; a touchscreen, cellular, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Protected Access, Wi-Fi, Global Positioning System (GPS) mobile navigation, video- and single-frame picture cameras, speech recognition, voice recorder, music player, near-field communication, and infrared blaster. By Q1 2018, over 383 million smartphones were sold with 85.9 percent running Android, 14.1 percent running iOS and a negligible number of smartphones running other OSes. Android alone is more popular than the popular desktop operating system Windows, and in general, smartphone use (even without tablets) exceeds desktop use. Other well-known mobile operating systems are Flyme OS and Harmony OS.

Mobile devices with mobile communications abilities (e.g., smartphones) contain two mobile operating systemsthe main user-facing software platform is supplemented by a second low-level proprietary real-time operating system which operates the radio and other hardware. Research has shown that these low-level systems may contain a range of security vulnerabilities permitting malicious base stations to gain high levels of control over the mobile device.
===Mobile apps===

A mobile app is a computer program designed to run on a mobile device, such as a smartphone. The term &quot;app&quot; is a short-form of the term &quot;software application&quot;.

===Application stores===
The introduction of Apple&#x27;s App Store for the iPhone and iPod Touch in July 2008 popularized manufacturer-hosted online distribution for third-party applications (software and computer programs) focused on a single platform. There are a huge variety of apps, including video games, music products and business tools. Up until that point, smartphone application distribution depended on third-party sources providing applications for multiple platforms, such as GetJar, Handango, Handmark, and PocketGear. Following the success of the App Store, other smartphone manufacturers launched application stores, such as Google&#x27;s Android Market (later renamed to the Google Play Store) and RIM&#x27;s BlackBerry App World, Android-related app stores like Aptoide, Cafe Bazaar, F-Droid, GetJar, and Opera Mobile Store. In February 2014, 93% of mobile developers were targeting smartphones first for mobile app development.

==Sales==


Since 1996, smartphone shipments have had positive growth. In November 2011, 27% of all photographs created were taken with camera-equipped smartphones. In September 2012, a study concluded that 4 out of 5 smartphone owners use the device to shop online. Global smartphone sales surpassed the sales figures for feature phones in early 2013. Worldwide shipments of smartphones topped 1 billion units in 2013, up 38% from 2012&#x27;s 725 million, while comprising a 55% share of the mobile phone market in 2013, up from 42% in 2012. In 2013, smartphone sales began to decline for the first time. In Q1 2016 for the first time the shipments dropped by 3 percent year on year. The situation was caused by the maturing China market. A report by NPD shows that fewer than 10% of US citizens have spent $1,000 or more on smartphones, as they are too expensive for most people, without introducing particularly innovative features, and amid Huawei, Oppo and Xiaomi introducing products with similar feature sets for lower prices. In 2019, smartphone sales declined by 3.2%, the largest in smartphone history, while China and India were credited with driving most smartphone sales worldwide. It is predicted that widespread adoption of 5G will help drive new smartphone sales.

===By manufacturer===

In 2011, Samsung had the highest shipment market share worldwide, followed by Apple. In 2013, Samsung had 31.3% market share, a slight increase from 30.3% in 2012, while Apple was at 15.3%, a decrease from 18.7% in 2012. Huawei, LG and Lenovo were at about 5% each, significantly better than 2012 figures, while others had about 40%, the same as the previous years figure. Only Apple lost market share, although their shipment volume still increased by 12.9%; the rest had significant increases in shipment volumes of 36 to 92%.

In Q1 2014, Samsung had a 31% share and Apple had 16%. In Q4 2014, Apple had a 20.4% share and Samsung had 19.9%. In Q2 2016, Samsung had a 22.3% share and Apple had 12.9%. In Q1 2017, IDC reported that Samsung was first placed, with 80 million units, followed by Apple with 50.8 million, Huawei with 34.6 million, Oppo with 25.5 million and Vivo with 22.7 million.

Samsung&#x27;s mobile business is half the size of Apple&#x27;s, by revenue. Apple business increased very rapidly in the years 2013 to 2017. Realme, a brand owned by Oppo, is the fastest-growing phone brand worldwide since Q2 2019. In China, Huawei and Honor, a brand owned by Huawei, have 46% of market share combined and posted 66% annual growth , amid growing Chinese nationalism. In 2019, Samsung had a 74% market share of 5G smartphones in South Korea.

In the first quarter of 2024, global smartphone shipments rose by 7.8% to 289.4 million units. Samsung, with a 20.8% market share, overtook Apple to become the leading smartphone manufacturer. Apple&#x27;s smartphone shipments dropped 10%. Xiaomi secured the third spot with a 14.1% market share.

===By operating system===
==Use==
===Contemporary use and convergence===
The rise in popularity of touchscreen smartphones and mobile apps distributed via app stores along with rapidly advancing network, mobile processor, and storage technologies led to a convergence where separate mobile phones, organizers, and portable media players were replaced by a smartphone as the single device most people carried. Advances in digital camera sensors and on-device image processing software more gradually led to smartphones replacing simpler cameras for photographs and video recording. The built-in GPS capabilities and mapping apps on smartphones largely replaced stand-alone satellite navigation devices, and paper maps became less common. Mobile gaming on smartphones greatly grew in popularity, allowing many people to use them in place of handheld game consoles, and some companies tried creating game console/phone hybrids based on phone hardware and software. People frequently have chosen not to get fixed-line telephone service in favor of smartphones. Music streaming apps and services have grown rapidly in popularity, serving the same use as listening to music stations on a terrestrial or satellite radio. Streaming video services are easily accessed via smartphone apps and can be used in place of watching television. People have often stopped wearing wristwatches in favor of checking the time on their smartphones, and many use the clock features on their phones in place of alarm clocks. Mobile phones can also be used as a digital note taking, text editing and memorandum device whose computerization facilitates searching of entries.

Additionally, in many lesser technologically developed regions smartphones are people&#x27;s first and only means of Internet access due to their portability, with personal computers being relatively uncommon outside of business use. The cameras on smartphones can be used to photograph documents and send them via email or messaging in place of using fax (facsimile) machines. Payment apps and services on smartphones allow people to make less use of wallets, purses, credit and debit cards, and cash. Mobile banking apps can allow people to deposit checks simply by photographing them, eliminating the need to take the physical check to an ATM or teller. Guide book apps can take the place of paper travel and restaurant/business guides, museum brochures, and dedicated audio guide equipment.

===Mobile banking and payment===

In many countries, mobile phones are used to provide mobile banking services, which may include the ability to transfer cash payments by secure SMS text message. Kenya&#x27;s M-PESA mobile banking service, for example, allows customers of the mobile phone operator Safaricom to hold cash balances which are recorded on their SIM cards. Cash can be deposited or withdrawn from M-PESA accounts at Safaricom retail outlets located throughout the country and can be transferred electronically from person to person and used to pay bills to companies.

Branchless banking has been successful in South Africa and the Philippines. A pilot project in Bali was launched in 2011 by the International Finance Corporation and an Indonesian bank, Bank Mandiri.

Another application of mobile banking technology is Zidisha, a US-based nonprofit micro-lending platform that allows residents of developing countries to raise small business loans from Web users worldwide. Zidisha uses mobile banking for loan disbursements and repayments, transferring funds from lenders in the United States to borrowers in rural Africa who have mobile phones and can use the Internet.

Mobile payments were first trialled in Finland in 1998 when two Coca-Cola vending machines in Espoo were enabled to work with SMS payments. Eventually, the idea spread and in 1999, the Philippines launched the country&#x27;s first commercial mobile payments systems with mobile operators Globe and Smart.

Some mobile phones can make mobile payments via direct mobile billing schemes, or through contactless payments if the phone and the point of sale support near-field communication (NFC). Enabling contactless payments through NFC-equipped mobile phones requires the co-operation of manufacturers, network operators, and retail merchants.

===Facsimile===
Some apps allows for sending and receiving facsimile (fax), over a smartphone, including facsimile data (composed of raster bi-level graphics) generated directly and digitally from document and image file formats.

===Films===

Films are increasingly made using smartphones and tablets, leading to the rise of dedicated film festivals for such films, including the SmartFone Flick Fest in Sydney, Australia; Dublin Smartphone Film Festival; the International Mobil Film Festival based in San Diego; the Spanish festival Cinephone – Festival Internacional de Cine con Smartphone; the African Smartphone International Film Festival; Toronto Smartphone Film Festival; New York Mobile Film Festival; and others.

==Criticism and issues==

===Social impacts===
====Manufacture====
Cobalt is needed in order to manufacture smartphones&#x27; rechargeable batteries. Workers, including children, suffer injuries, amputations, and death as the result of the hazardous working conditions and mine tunnel collapses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during artisanal mining of cobalt. In 2019 a lawsuit was filed against Apple and other tech companies for the use of child labor in mining cobalt; in 2024 the court ruled that the companies were not liable. Apple announced it would convert to using recycled cobalt by 2025.

====Use====

In 2012, University of Southern California study found that unprotected adolescent sexual activity was more common among owners of smartphones. 

A study conducted by the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute&#x27;s (RPI) Lighting Research Center (LRC) concluded that smartphones, or any backlit devices, can seriously affect sleep cycles. 

Some persons might become psychologically attached to smartphones, resulting in anxiety when separated from the devices. 

A &quot;smombie&quot; (a combination of &quot;smartphone&quot; and &quot;zombie&quot;) is a walking person using a smartphone and not paying attention as they walk, possibly risking an accident in the process, an increasing social phenomenon. The issue of slow-moving smartphone users led to the temporary creation of a &quot;mobile lane&quot; for walking in Chongqing, China. The issue of distracted smartphone users led the city of Augsburg, Germany, to embed pedestrian traffic lights in the pavement.

===While driving===


Mobile phone use while driving—including calling, text messaging, playing media, web browsing, gaming, using mapping apps or operating other phone features—is common but controversial, since it is widely considered dangerous due to what is known as distracted driving. Being distracted while operating a motor vehicle has been shown to increase the risk of accidents. In September 2010, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reported that 995 people were killed by drivers distracted by phones. In March 2011 a US insurance company, State Farm Insurance, announced the results of a study which showed 19% of drivers surveyed accessed the Internet on a smartphone while driving. Many jurisdictions prohibit the use of mobile phones while driving. In Egypt, Israel, Japan, Portugal and Singapore, both handheld and hands-free calling on a mobile phone (which uses a speakerphone) is banned. In other countries, including the UK and France, and in many US states, calling is only banned on handheld phones, while hands-free calling is permitted.

A 2011 study reported that over 90% of college students surveyed text (initiate, reply or read) while driving.
The scientific literature on the danger of driving while sending a text message from a mobile phone, or texting while driving, is limited. A simulation study at the University of Utah found a sixfold increase in distraction-related accidents when texting. Due to the complexity of smartphones that began to grow more after, this has introduced additional difficulties for law enforcement officials when attempting to distinguish one usage from another in drivers using their devices. This is more apparent in countries which ban both handheld and hands-free usage, rather than those which ban handheld use only, as officials cannot easily tell which function of the phone is being used simply by looking at the driver. This can lead to drivers being stopped for using their device illegally for a call when, in fact, they were using the device legally, for example, when using the phone&#x27;s incorporated controls for car stereo, GPS or satnav.
A 2010 study reviewed the incidence of phone use while cycling and its effects on behavior and safety. In 2013 a national survey in the US reported the number of drivers who reported using their phones to access the Internet while driving had risen to nearly one of four. A study conducted by the University of Vienna examined approaches for reducing inappropriate and problematic use of mobile phones, such as using phones while driving.

Accidents involving a driver being distracted by being in a call on a phone have begun to be prosecuted as negligence similar to speeding. In the United Kingdom, from 27 February 2007, motorists who are caught using a handheld phone while driving will have three penalty points added to their license in addition to the fine of £60. This increase was introduced to try to stem the increase in drivers ignoring the law. Japan prohibits all use of phones while driving, including use of hands-free devices. New Zealand has banned handheld phone use since 1 November 2009. Many states in the United States have banned text messaging on phones while driving. Illinois became the 17th American state to enforce this law. , 30 states had banned texting while driving, with Kentucky becoming the most recent addition on July 15.

Public Health Law Research maintains a list of distracted driving laws in the United States. This database of laws provides a comprehensive view of the provisions of laws that restrict the use of mobile devices while driving for all 50 states and the District of Columbia between 1992, when first law was passed through December 1, 2010. The dataset contains information on 22 dichotomous, continuous or categorical variables including, for example, activities regulated (e.g., texting versus talking, hands-free versus handheld calls, web browsing, gaming), targeted populations, and exemptions.

===Legal===

A &quot;patent war&quot; between Samsung and Apple started when the latter claimed that the original Galaxy S Android phone copied the interfaceand possibly the hardwareof Apple&#x27;s iOS for the iPhone 3GS. There was also smartphone patents licensing and litigation involving Sony Mobile, Google, Apple Inc., Samsung, Microsoft, Nokia, Motorola, HTC, Huawei and ZTE, among others. The conflict is part of the wider &quot;patent wars&quot; between multinational technology and software corporations. To secure and increase market share, companies granted a patent can sue to prevent competitors from using the methods the patent covers. Since the 2010s the number of lawsuits, counter-suits, and trade complaints based on patents and designs in the market for smartphones, and devices based on smartphone OSes such as Android and iOS, has increased significantly. Initial suits, countersuits, rulings, license agreements, and other major events began in 2009 as the smartphone market stated to grow more rapidly by 2012.

===Medical===

With the rise in number of mobile medical apps in the market place, government regulatory agencies raised concerns on the safety of the use of such applications. These concerns were transformed into regulation initiatives worldwide with the aim of safeguarding users from untrusted medical advice. According to the findings of these medical experts in recent years, excessive smartphone use in society may lead to headaches, sleep disorders and insufficient sleep, while severe smartphone addiction may lead to physical health problems, such as hunchback, muscle relaxation and uneven nutrition.

===Impacts on cognition and mental health===

There is a debate about beneficial and detrimental impacts of smartphones or smartphone-uses on cognition and mental health.

===Security===

Smartphone malware is easily distributed through an insecure app store. Often, malware is hidden in pirated versions of legitimate apps, which are then distributed through third-party app stores. Malware risk also comes from what is known as an &quot;update attack&quot;, where a legitimate application is later changed to include a malware component, which users then install when they are notified that the app has been updated. As well, one out of three robberies in 2012 in the United States involved the theft of a mobile phone. An online petition has urged smartphone makers to install kill switches in their devices. In 2014, Apple&#x27;s &quot;Find my iPhone&quot; and Google&#x27;s &quot;Android Device Manager&quot; can locate, disable, and wipe the data from phones that have been lost or stolen. With BlackBerry Protect in OS version 10.3.2, devices can be rendered unrecoverable to even BlackBerry&#x27;s own Operating System recovery tools if incorrectly authenticated or dissociated from their account.

Leaked documents from 2013 to 2016 codenamed Vault 7 detail the capabilities of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare, including the ability to compromise the operating systems of most smartphones (including iOS and Android). In 2021, journalists and researchers reported the discovery of spyware, called Pegasus, developed and distributed by a private company which can and has been used to infect iOS and Android smartphones oftenpartly via use of 0-day exploitswithout the need for any user-interaction or significant clues to the user and then be used to exfiltrate data, track user locations, capture film through its camera, and activate the microphone at any time. Analysis of data traffic by popular smartphones running variants of Android found substantial by-default data collection and sharing with no opt-out by this pre-installed software.

Guidelines for mobile device security were issued by NIST and many other organizations. For conducting a private, in-person meeting, at least one site recommends that the user switch the smartphone off and disconnect the battery.

===Sleep===

Using smartphones late at night can disturb sleep, due to the blue light and brightly lit screen, which affects melatonin levels and sleep cycles. In an effort to alleviate these issues, &quot;Night Mode&quot; functionality to change the color temperature of a screen to a warmer hue based on the time of day to reduce the amount of blue light generated became available through several apps for Android and the f.lux software for jailbroken iPhones. iOS 9.3 integrated a similar, system-level feature known as &quot;Night Shift.&quot; Several Android device manufacturers bypassed Google&#x27;s initial reluctance to make Night Mode a standard feature in Android and included software for it on their hardware under varying names, before Android Oreo added it to the OS for compatible devices.

It has also been theorized that for some users, addiction to use of their phones, especially before they go to bed, can result in &quot;ego depletion.&quot; Many people also use their phones as alarm clocks, which can also lead to loss of sleep.

==Replacement of dedicated digital cameras==
As the 2010s decade commenced, the sale figures of dedicated compact cameras decreased sharply since mobile phone cameras were increasingly perceived as serving as a sufficient surrogate camera.

Increases in computing power in mobile phones enabled fast image processing and high-resolution filming, with 1080p Full HD being achieved in 2011 and the barrier to 2160p 4K being breached in 2013.

However, due to design and space limitations, smartphones lack several features found even on low-budget compact cameras, including a hot-swappable memory card and battery for nearly uninterrupted operation, physical buttons and knobs for focusing and capturing and zooming, a bolt thread tripod mount, a capacitor-charged xenon flash that exceeds the brightness of smartphones&#x27; LED flashlights, and an ergonomic grip for steadier holding during handheld shooting, which enables longer exposure times. Since dedicated cameras can be more spacious, they can house larger image sensors and feature optical zooming.

Since the late 2010s, smartphone manufacturers have bypassed the lack of optical zoom to a limited extent by incorporating additional rear cameras with fixed magnification levels.

==Lifespan==
In mobile phones released since the second half of the 2010s, operational life span commonly is limited by built-in batteries which are not designed to be interchangeable. The life expectancy of batteries depends on usage intensity of the powered device, where activity (longer usage) and tasks demanding more energy expire the battery earlier.

Lithium-ion and lithium-polymer batteries, those commonly powering portable electronics, additionally wear down more from fuller charge and deeper discharge cycles, and when unused for an extended amount of time while depleted, where self-discharging may lead to a harmful depth of discharge.

Manufacturers have prevented some smartphones from operating after repairs, by associating components&#x27; unique serial numbers to the device so it will refuse to operate or disable some functionality in case of a mismatch that would occur after a replacement. Locking of the serial number was first documented in 2015 on the iPhone 6, which would become inoperable from a detected replacement of the &quot;home&quot; button. Later, some functionality was restricted on Apple and Samsung smartphones when a battery replacement not authorized by the vendor was detected.

<doc id="167082" wikidata="Q851746" url="?curid=167082" title="Dashi">
<text>is a family of stocks used in Japanese cuisine. &quot;Dashi&quot; forms the base for miso soup, clear broth soup, noodle broth soup, and many simmering liquids to accentuate the savory flavor known as umami. &quot;Dashi&quot; is also mixed into the flour base of some grilled foods like okonomiyaki and takoyaki.

==Preparation==
The most common form of &quot;dashi&quot; is a simple broth made by heating water containing &quot;kombu&quot; (edible kelp) and &quot;kezurikatsuo&quot; (shavings of &quot;katsuobushi&quot; – preserved, fermented skipjack tuna or bonito) to near-boiling, then straining the resultant liquid; dried anchovies or sardines may be substituted. Katsuobushi is especially high in sodium inosinate and kombu is especially high in glutamic acids; both combined create a synergy of umami.

Granulated or liquid instant &quot;dashi&quot; largely replaced the homemade product in the second half of the 20th century. Homemade &quot;dashi&quot; is less popular today, even in Japan. Compared to the taste of homemade dashi, instant &quot;dashi&quot; tends to have a stronger, less subtle flavor, due to the use of chemical flavor enhancers—glutamates and ribonucleotides.

==Variations==
Other kinds of &quot;dashi&quot; are made by soaking kelp, niboshi, or shiitake in water for many hours or by heating them in near-boiling water and straining the resulting broth.
* &quot;Kombu dashi&quot; is made by soaking or gently simmering kelp in water; soaking is traditional and fit for making baby food while simmering is a more modern practice. Kombu dashi becomes bitter and unpalatable when boiled.
* &quot;Niboshi dashi&quot; is made by pinching off the heads and entrails of small dried sardines (to prevent bitterness) and soaking the rest in water. Sometimes the heads are used as not everyone finds them to be bitter, and the fish are occasionally toasted to evaporate any volatile unpleasant fishy odors.
* &quot;Shiitake dashi&quot; is made by soaking dried shiitake mushrooms in water. Dried shiitake is preferred over fresh due to a stronger presence of savory or umami flavors.

<doc id="167083" wikidata="Q13395199" url="?curid=167083" title="Yeshua">
<text>Yeshua () was a common alternative form of the name Yehoshua () in later books of the Hebrew Bible and among Jewish people of the Second Temple period. The name corresponds to the Greek spelling (), from which, through the Latin /, comes the English spelling [[Jesus (name)|Jesus]].

The Hebrew spelling () appears in some later books of the Hebrew Bible. Once for Joshua the son of Nun, and 28 times for Joshua the High Priest and other priests called Jeshua – although these same priests are also given the spelling Joshua in 11 further instances in the books of Haggai and Zechariah. It differs from the usual Hebrew Bible spelling of Joshua (, ), found 218 times in the Hebrew Bible, in the absence of the consonant () and placement of the semivowel () after, not before, the consonant (). It also differs from the Hebrew spelling () which is found in Ben-Yehuda Dictionary and used in most secular contexts in Modern Hebrew to refer to Jesus, although the Hebrew spelling () is generally used in translations of the New Testament into Hebrew and used by Hebrew-speaking Christians in Israel. The name Yeshua is also used in Hebrew historical texts to refer to other Joshuas recorded in Greek texts such as Jesus ben Ananias and Jesus ben Sira.

In English, the name Yeshua is extensively used by followers of Messianic Judaism, whereas East Syriac Christian denominations use the name in order to preserve the Syriac name of Jesus. The 2004 film &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;, which was made in Aramaic, used Yeshua as the name of Jesus and is the most well-known western Christian work to have done so.

==Etymology==

The name , (transliterated in the English Old Testament as Jeshua), is a late form of the Biblical Hebrew name , (Joshua), and spelled with a in the second syllable. The Late Biblical Hebrew spellings for earlier names often contracted the theophoric element to . Thus, , , contracted to , .

Yeshua in Hebrew is a verbal derivative from &quot;to rescue&quot;, &quot;to deliver&quot;. Among the Jews of the Second Temple period, the Biblical Aramaic/Hebrew name , was common: the Hebrew Bible mentions several individuals with this name – while also using their full name Joshua. This name is a feature of biblical books written in the post-Exilic period (Ezra, Nehemiah, and Chronicles) and was found in the Dead Sea Scrolls, though Haggai and Zechariah prefer the spelling Joshua. Strong&#x27;s Concordance connects the name , , in the English form Jeshua (as used in multiple instances in Ezra, Nehemiah, and 1 and 2 Chronicles), with the verb &quot;to deliver&quot; (or, &quot;to rescue&quot;). It is often translated as &quot;He saves,&quot; to conform with Matthew 1:21: &quot;She will bear a Son; and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins&quot;.

The name occurs in the Hebrew of the Old Testament at verses Ezra 2:2, 2:6, 2:36, 2:40, 3:2, 3:8, 3:9, 3:10, 3:18, 4:3, 8:33; Nehemiah 3:19, 7:7, 7:11, 7:39, 7:43, 8:7, 8:17, 9:4, 9:5, 11:26, 12:1, 12:7, 12:8, 12:10, 12:24, 12:26; 1 Chronicles 24:11; and 2 Chronicles 31:15, and also in Aramaic at Ezra 5:2. In Nehemiah 8:17 this name refers to Joshua son of Nun, the successor of Moses, as leader of the Israelites. In earlier English (where adaptations of names of Biblical figures were generally based on the Latin Vulgate forms), Yeshua was generally transcribed identically to &quot;Jesus&quot; in English.

The name Yehoshua has the form of a compound of &quot;Yeho-&quot; and &quot;shua&quot;: () is another form of , , a theophoric element standing for the name of God, (the Tetragrammaton YHWH, sometimes transcribed into English as Yahweh), and , is a noun meaning &quot;a cry for help&quot;, &quot;a saving cry&quot;, that is to say, a shout given when in need of rescue.

Another explanation for the name Yehoshua is that it comes from the root , , meaning &quot;to deliver, save, or rescue&quot;. According to the Book of Numbers verse 13:16, the name of Joshua, the son of Nun was originally (), and the name () is usually spelled the same but with a added at the beginning. &quot;Hosheaʿ&quot; certainly comes from the root , , (in the Hif&#x27;il form the becomes a ), and not from the word , .)

In the 1st century, Philo of Alexandria, in a Greek exposition, offered this understanding of Moses&#x27;s reason for the name change of the biblical hero Jehoshua/Joshua son of Nun from Hoshea (similar to , meaning &quot;He rescued&quot;) to Yehoshua in commemoration of his salvation: &quot;And refers to salvation of the Lord&quot; [ or being the Greek form of the name] () (&quot;On the Change of Names&quot; 21.121).

Similarly, the Septuagint renders Ben Sira as saying (in the Greek form of the name): &quot; the son of Naue [Yehoshua Ben Nun] who &quot;according to his name&quot; became great unto [the] salvation/deliverance of his chosen ones&quot; () (Ben Sira 46:1–2). However, Ben Sira originally wrote in Hebrew in the second century BC, and the only extant Hebrew manuscript for this passage has &quot;in his days&quot; (), not &quot;according to his name&quot; (which would be in Hebrew), and thus does not comment on the name Yehoshua as connoting &quot;deliverance&quot;: &quot;Yehoshua Ben Nun, who was formed to be &quot;in his days&quot; a great deliverer for his chosen ones&quot; ().

==Archaeological evidence==

Tal Ilan&#x27;s Lexicon of Jewish Names in Late Antiquity (2002) includes for &quot;Joshua&quot; 85 examples of Hebrew , 15 of , and 48 examples of in Greek inscriptions,&quot; with only one Greek variant as . One ossuary of the around twenty known with the name Yeshua, Rahmani No.9, discovered by Ezra Sukenik in 1931, has &quot;Yeshu... Yeshua ben Yosef.&quot; The &quot;Yeshu...&quot; may have been scratched out. Two Jewish magical incantation bowls have been discovered both bearing variant spellings of Yeshua.

Apart from the &quot;Yeshua... Yeshua ben Yosef&quot; ossuary, the only other known evidence for the existence of a Yeshua form prior to the material related to Jesus in the Talmud, is a graffito which Joachim Jeremias identified in Bethesda in 1966, but which is now filled in.

==Pronunciation==
In (, ), the Hebrew letter (, is vocalized with the Hebrew vowel (, a &#x27;long&#x27; &quot;e&quot; like the first syllable of &quot;neighbor&quot; but not diphthongized), rather than with a (, as Y&#x27;shua) or (, Yesh-shua). The final letter, () is (a voiced pharyngeal sound not found in Greek or English), sometimes transcribed (). The final represents the &quot;patach genuvah&quot; (&quot;furtive&quot; &quot;patach&quot;), indicating that the consonant is pronounced after the &quot;a&quot; vowel, and the word&#x27;s stress is moved to the middle syllable (the characteristics of the furtive patach can be seen in other words, such as , &#x27;spirit&#x27;). Thus it is pronounced in Modern Hebrew.

The Hebrew name of Jesus is probably pronounced , although this is uncertain and depends on the reconstruction of several ancient Hebrew dialects. Talshir suggests, even though Galileans tended to keep the traditional spelling for with for , they still pronounced the name similarly to the Judeans, as &#x27;Yeshua&#x27; , who tended to spell the name phonetically as , perhaps reducing the name thus: &gt; &gt; , with the palatalizing (via dissimilation) before the .

Qimron describes the general linguistic environment of Hebrew dialects by the time of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The articulation of the (along with other guttural phonemes , , and , as well as approximants and ) lenited significantly. Thus Hebrew pronunciations became less stable when two successive vowels were no longer separated by a consonant . The speakers optionally either reduced the two vowels to a single vowel or oppositely expanded them to emphasize each vowel separately, sometimes forming a furtive glide in between, or . For example, the Dead Sea Scrolls spell the Hebrew word (, &#x27;seen&#x27;) variously, recording both pronunciations: reduced () and expanded ().

The Hebrew name Yehoshua generally reduced to Yeshua, but an expanded Yehoshua is possible, especially in Galilee, whose traditional orthography possibly reflects this.

==Original name for Jesus==
The English name &quot;Jesus&quot; derives from the Late Latin name , which transliterates the Koine Greek name .

In the Septuagint and other Greek-language Jewish texts, such as the writings of Josephus and Philo of Alexandria, () is the standard Koine Greek form used to translate both of the Hebrew names: Yehoshua and Yeshua. The Greek or is also used to represent the name of Joshua son of Nun in the New Testament passages Acts 7:45 and Hebrews 4:8. (It was even used in the Septuagint to translate the name &quot;Hoshea&quot; in one of the three verses where this referred to Joshua the son of Nun—Deuteronomy 32:44.)

During the second Temple period (beginning 538 BC–70 AD), Yeshua first became a known form of the name Yehoshua. All occurrences of Yeshua in the Hebrew Bible are in 1 Chronicles 24:11, 2 Chronicles 31:15, Ezra, and Nehemiah where it is transliterated into English as Jeshua. Two of these men (Joshua the son of Nun and Joshua the High Priest) are mentioned in other books of the Hebrew Bible where they are instead called Yehoshua (transliterated into English as Joshua).

The earlier form Yehoshua did not disappear, however, and remained in use as well. In the post-exilic books, Joshua the son of Nun is called both Yeshua bin-Nun (Nehemiah 8:17) and Yehoshua (1 Chronicles 7:27). The short form Yeshua was used for Jesus ben Sirach in Hebrew fragments of the Wisdom of Sirach. (Some concern remains over whether these fragments faithfully represent the original Hebrew text or are instead a later translation back into Hebrew.) The earlier form Yehoshua saw revived usage from the Hasmonean period onwards, although the name Yeshua is still found in letters from the time of the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132–135 AD).

In the documentary &quot;The Lost Tomb of Jesus&quot;, archeologist Amos Kloner stated that the name Yeshua was then a popular form of the name Yehoshua and was &quot;one of the common names in the time of the Second Temple.&quot; In discussing whether it was remarkable to find a tomb with the name of Jesus (the particular ossuary in question bears the inscription &quot;Yehuda bar Yeshua&quot;), he pointed out that the name had been found 71 times in burial caves from that time period.

Thus, both the full form Yehoshua and the abbreviated form Yeshua were in use during the Gospel period – and in relation to the same person, as in the Hebrew Bible references to Yehoshua/Yeshua son of Nun, and Yehoshua/Yeshua the high priest in the days of Ezra. An argument in favor of the Hebrew reduced form , , as opposed to Yehoshua, is the Western Syriac language, in which the pronunciation is &quot;Yeshuʿ&quot; .

===East Syriac ===

Aramaic and Classical Syriac render the pronunciation of the same letters as &#x27; and &#x27; . The Aramaic Bibles and the Syriac Peshitta preserve these same spellings. Current scholarly consensus posits that the New Testament texts were translated from the Greek, but this theory is not supported directly at least by the name for Jesus, which is not a simple transliteration of the Greek form as would otherwise be expected, as Greek did not have a &quot;sh&quot; sound, and substituted ; and likewise lacked and therefore omitted the final (). Moreover, Eusebius (early 4th century) reports that Papias of Hierapolis (early 2nd century) reports that Jesus&#x27;s disciple Matthew the Evangelist wrote a gospel &quot;in the Hebrew language&quot;. (Scholars typically argue the word &quot;Hebrew&quot; in the New Testament refers to Aramaic; however, others have attempted to refute this view.) The Aramaic of the Peshitta does not distinguish between &quot;Joshua&quot; and &quot;Jesus&quot;, and the Lexicon of William Jennings gives the same form of for both names. The Hebrew final letter () is equivalent to final in Syriac varieties of Aramaic. It can be argued that Aramaic speakers who used this name had a continual connection to the Aramaic-speakers in communities founded by the apostles and other students of Jesus, thus independently preserved his historical name Yeshuuʿ and the Eastern dialectical . Those churches following the East Syriac Rite still preserve the name .
In the Talmud, only one reference is made to the spelling Yeshuaʿ, in verbatim quotation from the Hebrew Bible regarding Jeshua son of Jozadak (elsewhere called Joshua son of Josedech). The Talmud does refer to several people named Yehoshua from before (e.g. Joshua ben Perachyah) and after Jesus (e.g., Joshua ben Hananiah). In references to Jesus in the Talmud, however, where the name occurs, it is rendered Yeshu, which is a name reserved in Aramaic and Hebrew literature from the early medieval period until today, solely for Jesus, not for other Joshuas. Some scholars, such as Maier (1978), regard the two named &quot;Yeshuʿ&quot; texts in the Talmud (Sanhedrin 43a and 107b) to be later amendments, and not original.

===Rabbinical commentary on the difference Yeshuʿ/Yeshuaʿ===
In general rabbinical sources, the name Yeshuʿ is used, and this is the form to which some named references to Jesus in the Talmud as Yeshu occur in some manuscripts of the Babylonian Talmud, though some scholars, such as Maier (1978) have argued that the presence of the name Yeshuʿ in these texts is a late interpolation. Some of the Hebrew sources referencing Yeshu include the , &quot;The Book of Nestor the Priest&quot;, Jacob ben Reuben&#x27;s , , , the works of ibn Shaprut, Moses ha-Kohen de Tordesillas, and Hasdai Crescas.

The name Yeshu is unknown in archeological sources and inscriptions, except for one ossuary found in Israel which has an inscription where someone has started to write first &quot;Yeshu..&quot; and then written &quot;Yeshuaʿ bar Yehosef&quot; beneath it. There are 24 other ossuaries to various Yeshuas and Yehoshuas. None of the others have Yeshu. All other &quot;Joshuas&quot; in the Talmud, rabbinical writings, modern Hebrew, are always Yeshua or Yehoshua. There are no undisputed examples of any Aramaic or Hebrew text where Yeshu refers to anyone else than Jesus.

Some of rabbinical sources comment on the reasons for the missing from Yeshu, as opposed to the Hebrew Bible Yeshuaʿ and Yehoshuaʿ. Leon Modena argues that it was Jesus himself who made his disciples remove the , and that therefore they cannot now restore it. (Modena was a 17th-century polemicist and does not have reliable linguistic evidence for the claim.) A tradition states that the shortening to Yeshu relates to the Y-SH-U of the , &quot;may his name be obliterated.&quot; Against this David Flusser suggested that the name &quot;Yeshu&quot; itself was &quot;in no way abusive,&quot; but &quot;almost certainly&quot; a Galilean dialect form of Yeshua. But E.Y. Kutscher showed that the was still pronounced in Galilee, refuting a thesis by Paul Kahle.

<doc id="167090" wikidata="Q1689159" url="?curid=167090" title="Jim McMahon">
<text>James Robert McMahon Jr. (born August 21, 1959) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 15 seasons, most notably with the Chicago Bears. McMahon played college football for the BYU Cougars, winning the Davey O&#x27;Brien Award and the Sammy Baugh Trophy as a senior. He was selected by the Bears fifth overall in the 1982 NFL draft.

McMahon achieved his greatest professional success with the 1985 Bears team that won the franchise&#x27;s first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XX over the New England Patriots. He also received Pro Bowl honors during the season. However, after suffering a rotator cuff injury the following season, McMahon struggled with injuries throughout the rest of his career. Following his seven years in Chicago, McMahon played for the San Diego Chargers, Philadelphia Eagles, Minnesota Vikings, Arizona Cardinals, and Green Bay Packers. He spent his final seasons in a backup role, including on the Packers team that won Super Bowl XXXI, also over the Patriots. McMahon was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1998.

==Early life==
McMahon was born in Jersey City, New Jersey. He was raised Catholic. He moved with his family to San Jose, California, when he was three. Growing up, McMahon played all sports in his neighborhood, encouraged by his parents. &quot;We told him to believe he was the best,&quot; his mother said. &quot;If he didn&#x27;t, nobody else would.&quot;

McMahon played high school football his freshman and sophomore years at Andrew Hill High School, then moved with his family in the summer of 1975 to Roy, Utah, where he played his junior and senior years at Roy High School and graduated in 1977.

==College career==
McMahon enrolled at Brigham Young University (BYU) and played college football for the Cougars. He was their punter during his freshman season. He also played baseball, but he played enough at quarterback to throw his first-ever collegiate touchdown pass against UTEP. He continued as the Cougars&#x27; punter as the 1978 season began, but when Marc Wilson was injured in the third game of the season (against Colorado State), McMahon became the starting quarterback. McMahon led BYU to victory against Colorado State, accounting for 112 passing yards, 80 rushing yards, and two touchdowns. He was named Chevrolet Player of the Game and Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Player of the Week for his performance. McMahon and Wilson shared quarterback duties for the rest of the season; McMahon played well enough to earn All-WAC honors and Associated Press Honorable Mention All-America. The best game of his sophomore year was against Wyoming: he passed for 317 yards and rushed for 49 more yards, earning another WAC Player of the Week award.

McMahon suffered a knee injury towards the end of the 1978 season and BYU coaches chose to redshirt him in 1979. McMahon watched from the sidelines as Wilson set nine NCAA records, tied two others, and became the first BYU player to earn consensus first-team All-American honors; he finished third in Heisman Trophy balloting.

With Wilson graduated and in the NFL with the Oakland Raiders, McMahon beat out Royce Bybee to claim the starting quarterback position in 1980. BYU lost the opener 25–21 against New Mexico, but then won eleven straight to claim the WAC championship. McMahon set 32 NCAA records, including single-season records for yards of total offense (4,627), passing yards (4,571), touchdown passes (47), and passing efficiency (176.9). His best game was against Utah State; he completed 21 of 33 passes for 485 yards and six touchdowns, and added two rushing touchdowns. That performance earned him &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;&#x27;s National Player of the Week award. McMahon&#x27;s season statistics might have been even better, but he spent significant time on the sidelines because the Cougars won many games by wide margins. Although he started all 12 regular-season games, he only finished three of them.

BYU led the nation in passing offense, total offense, and scoring offense during the regular season. McMahon earned numerous awards for his individual accomplishments, being named WAC Player of the Year, unanimous First-team All-WAC, Utah Sportsman of the Year, and &quot;Deseret News&quot; Athlete of the Year. He was named to four All-America teams and finished fifth in Heisman Trophy voting.

In the Holiday Bowl, the Cougars faced an SMU team led by star running backs Craig James and Eric Dickerson, and the Mustangs built a 45–25 lead over BYU with just four minutes left in the game. As Cougar fans headed for the exits, McMahon screamed that the game was not over yet. He promptly guided BYU&#x27;s offense to three quick touchdowns, including a 41-yard Hail Mary pass to Clay Brown to win the game as time expired. It is regarded as one of the greatest comebacks in college football history; BYU fans refer to it as the &quot;Miracle Bowl&quot;.

In McMahon&#x27;s senior season in 1981, despite missing two games due to injuries, he passed for 3,555 yards and 30 touchdowns in the regular season, again leading BYU to a WAC championship. For his efforts, he was named WAC Player of the Year and unanimous First-team All-WAC. On a national level, he was named First-team All-American by five different organizations and finished third in Heisman Trophy balloting. He received the Davey O&#x27;Brien Trophy and the Sammy Baugh Award, and he shared the Pigskin Club NCAA Offensive Player of the Year award with USC&#x27;s Marcus Allen. He earned &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;&#x27;s Player of the Week award after his performance against Colorado State, in which he tied a school record with seven touchdown passes.

In his last game as a Cougar, McMahon passed for 342 yards and 3 touchdowns in BYU&#x27;s victory over Washington State in the 1981 Holiday Bowl. His career totals were 9,536 passing yards and 84 touchdown passes (not including bowl games). McMahon left college with 70 NCAA records and tied for one other. He entered the College Football Hall of Fame in 1999.

In September 2010, McMahon announced he would complete his coursework at BYU, which would qualify him for induction into the Brigham Young University Athletics Hall of Fame. On October 2, 2014, after completing his degree in communications, McMahon was inducted into the BYU Athletics Hall of Fame as part of the 2014 class. BYU honored McMahon by retiring his No. 9 jersey during a halftime ceremony at the BYU vs. Utah State football game on Friday, October 3, 2014.

==Professional career==
===Chicago Bears===
The Chicago Bears selected McMahon in the first round (fifth overall) of the 1982 NFL draft. McMahon, thrilled to be free from what he considered a restrictive culture at BYU, strolled into his first public function with the Bears holding a cold beer in his hand. Head coach Mike Ditka was not impressed, nor was Bears owner and founder George Halas. McMahon was to find the atmosphere in Chicago almost as challenging as that at Brigham Young, and he would lock horns with Ditka routinely during his seven years with the Bears.

McMahon won the Bears&#x27; starting quarterback job as a rookie in 1982, and was named to several All-Rookie teams when he nearly led the team to the playoffs, despite the NFL only playing two games before a players&#x27; strike that cancelled nearly half the season. McMahon quickly displayed a natural ability to read defenses and an athletic versatility that surprised many.

McMahon, a rollout passer, explained that coaching in his youth had taught him to square his shoulders to the direction he wanted to throw the football, and he was thus able to execute passes with tight spirals and a high degree of accuracy when running to either his left or his right. The Bears finished the strike-shortened season at 3–6, and McMahon was named NFC Offensive Rookie of the Year, losing the league-wide honor to Marcus Allen.

In 1983, McMahon continued to improve as a passer and as a field general. He made a habit of changing the play both in the huddle and at the line of scrimmage, a practice which frustrated Ditka but usually led to success. His knowledge of the game and an instinctive, intuitive grasp of in-game situations were significant. He became a frequent scorer in goal-line situations, after the dying Halas instructed Ditka to make the quarterback sneak a bigger part of the Bears&#x27; offense. He also began to catch touchdown passes on option plays, and was the emergency punter. Chicago finished the season at 8–8, missing the division title and a playoff berth by one victory.

In 1984, the Bears broke through, reaching the conference title game before losing to the San Francisco 49ers. McMahon started the season strongly, though nursing minor injuries like those that would plague him throughout his career. In a violent game against the Los Angeles Raiders at Soldier Field, McMahon sustained a season-ending injury when he was brutally tackled by two Los Angeles defenders. He suffered bruised ribs and a lacerated kidney on the play, but limped to the huddle and breathlessly called the next play, despite difficulty breathing and increasing pain. The players could barely hear him in the huddle, and when McMahon attempted an audible at the line of scrimmage the Bears receivers were unable to hear his call. McMahon was on the verge of collapsing on the field, clutching his flank and rasping in his attempts to convey his situation. The offensive linemen helped McMahon stand and leave the field. McMahon went to the locker room, and reported urine that &quot;looked like grape juice&quot;.

====1985====
In 1985, the Bears had a tremendous season, later voted by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine as the greatest of all time, winning their first 12 games and finishing at 15–1. McMahon became a media darling, not only for his outstanding play on the field, but also for his personality. He appeared in a rap record made by the team, &quot;The Super Bowl Shuffle&quot;, in which he proclaimed, &quot;I&#x27;m the punky QB known as McMahon.&quot; In an early-season Thursday night game at Minnesota, McMahon was slated to back up Steve Fuller, as McMahon had missed practice time earlier in the week due to a neck injury that required an overnight hospital stay. Midway into the third quarter, the Vikings held a 17–9 lead. McMahon lobbied to get into the game until well into the third quarter. Once finally on the field, his first play was an opportunistic 70-yard touchdown pass to Willie Gault. After an interception by Wilber Marshall on the Vikings ensuing possession, McMahon&#x27;s very next offensive play was a 25-yard touchdown pass to Dennis McKinnon, making him 2–2 for 95 yards and two touchdowns. He followed up with another successful offensive drive, including a crucial third and short sneak to set up another 43-yard touchdown pass to McKinnon. The Bears led 30–17 and went on to win the game 33–24.

McMahon played solidly, throwing for career-highs of 15 touchdowns and 2,392 yards in 13 games and running well (5.4 yards per carry, three rushing touchdowns).

McMahon was notorious for head-first baseball-style slides when running the football, despite being coached to slide feet-first to protect his body. In the playoffs, McMahon heeded this coaching advice and was speared by a defender&#x27;s helmet squarely in his buttocks, causing a painful deep bruise for which McMahon sought acupuncture treatment. This led to a point of controversy before the Super Bowl in New Orleans, when McMahon &quot;mooned&quot; journalists who were inquiring as to the status of the injury. Thursday morning before the big-game, McMahon made more headlines when a local television station reported that he had called women of New Orleans &quot;sluts&quot;, an accusation he denied and which the announcer later admitted was made up. McMahon claimed in an interview, that he received death threats and wore a different jersey number during practice.

He ended the season with a strong performance in Super Bowl XX, which the Bears won 46–10 over the New England Patriots. In that game, McMahon became the first quarterback in the history of the Super Bowl to rush for two touchdowns. McMahon earned a spot in his only Pro Bowl.

====1986–1988====

In week 12 of the 1986 NFL regular season, McMahon was playing against the Green Bay Packers, while dealing with an existing rotator cuff injury to his right shoulder. After throwing a third down interception and at least two seconds after his pass was thrown, Green Bay nose tackle Charles Martin grabbed McMahon from behind and body-slammed him to the turf, exacerbating his existing rotator cuff injury. McMahon briefly returned to the game, but it soon became apparent that he couldn&#x27;t throw effectively, and he left the game in the third quarter, never to play again in 1986. Martin was immediately ejected from the game and later suspended for two additional games — the first multi-game suspension for an on-field incident in modern NFL history. Without McMahon, and despite finishing tied for the league&#x27;s best record at 14–2, the Bears were unable to defend their Super Bowl championship and lost in the Divisional Playoff round to the Washington Redskins.

McMahon battled injuries for the rest of his career, although at one point between the 1984 and 1987 seasons, he won 22 consecutive regular-season (25 including playoffs and the Super Bowl) starts, the longest &quot;regular season winning streak&quot; by an NFL quarterback at the time, now held by Peyton Manning, who won 23 in 2008 to 2009 (but lost a wildcard playoff game to the Chargers during his &quot;winning streak&quot;).

In 1987, McMahon came right back from a head injury and brought the Bears back in the first game following the NFL players strike to defeat the Buccaneers, 27–26. The Bears went on to an 11–4 record, with many expecting McMahon to start and lead the Bears back to the Super Bowl. However, 1987 ended exactly the same way 1986 had, with the Bears being eliminated by the eventual Super Bowl champion Redskins.

McMahon returned for the 1988 season with a much more serious attitude. His main offensive weapon in Walter Payton had retired and McMahon publicly expressed his desire to win a Super Bowl again. The Bears looked strong all season and went 12–4, again winning the NFC Central, and finishing with the NFC&#x27;s top seed, ensuring they would host the NFC Championship Game at Soldier Field if they advanced that far. McMahon was unable to get the Bears back to the Super Bowl, as they were routed by the eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship which saw McMahon benched in favor of Mike Tomczak in the fourth quarter.

During the offseason, McMahon and Bears president Michael McCaskey had a major falling out. He also fell out of favor with head coach Mike Ditka, and after spending his first seven seasons in the league with Chicago, McMahon was traded to the San Diego Chargers.

As of 2017&#x27;s NFL off-season, McMahon held at least 15 Bears franchise records, including:
* Completions: playoffs (70)
* Passing Yards: playoffs (967), playoff season (636 in 1985)
* Passing TDs: playoffs (4), playoff season (3 in 1985; with Rex Grossman), playoff game (2 on 1986-01-05 NYG; with Steve Walsh and Jay Cutler), rookie season (9 in 1982; with Kyle Orton)
* Passer Rating: playoffs (77.1), playoff season (106.6 in 1985), rookie season (79.9 in 1982)
* Sacked: playoffs (10), rookie game (7 on 1982-11-28 @MIN)
* Yds/Pass Att: playoffs (7.61), playoff season (9.64 in 1985)
* Pass Yds/Game: rookie season (187.6 in 1982)

===San Diego Chargers===
McMahon started 11 games for the 6–10 Chargers team in 1989. He went 4–7 in the games he started, though the team lost four of those games by a combined 11 points. He had only 4 games over 200 yards, but had 389 yards against the Houston Oilers in a Week 2 loss.

However, McMahon again found himself in trouble when he fell out of favor with his coach, Dan Henning, his teammates, and the team&#x27;s front office staff. He was benched for the final four games in favor of Billy Joe Tolliver and finished the year with 2,132 yards, 10 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. McMahon was released after the season.

===Later career===

McMahon signed with the Philadelphia Eagles, who were coached by former Bears assistant Buddy Ryan, for the 1990 season. For the first time in his career he served as a full-time backup, as Randall Cunningham was entrenched as the starter. After Cunningham tore his ACL in the opening game of the following season, new coach Rich Kotite named McMahon his starter. He helped the Eagles to a 10–6 record and earned the NFL Comeback Player of the Year award. McMahon stayed with the Eagles for one additional season in the backup role.

McMahon&#x27;s last chance to be a full-time starter came with the Minnesota Vikings in 1993. Supplanting Sean Salisbury as the team&#x27;s starter, McMahon led the Vikings to eight wins in twelve starts and returned to the postseason as a starter for the first time since 1988. However, the Vikings lost to the New York Giants.

After the season, McMahon joined the Arizona Cardinals, now coached by Ryan, for the 1994 season, where he made his final career start in Week 3, against the Cleveland Browns. He finished the season as the team&#x27;s third quarterback behind Steve Beuerlein and Jay Schroeder and left the team at its conclusion. McMahon made the Cleveland Browns in the 1995 preseason but did not play a down with them, McMahon later in the season joined the Green Bay Packers. He retired following the 1996 season, which finished with a Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots in New Orleans, eleven years to the day of the Bears&#x27; Super Bowl victory over the Patriots in the same venue.

McMahon caused some controversy when he showed up to the Packers&#x27; reception at the White House wearing his Bears jersey, due to the rivalry between the two teams. McMahon later explained that he did so because he was unable to visit the White House when he led the Bears to victory in Super Bowl XX; two days after the Bears won the game, the crew of Space Shuttle mission STS-51-L were killed in the explosion of their craft, Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;, and the Bears&#x27; scheduled visit was cancelled. McMahon and his surviving teammates and coaches were eventually received in 2011 by President Barack Obama, himself a Bears fan.

==Post-retirement==
===Legal troubles===
In November 2003, McMahon was apprehended in Navarre, Florida for driving under the influence. &quot;One breathalyzer exam put McMahon&#x27;s blood-alcohol level at 0.261 percent, another put it at 0.258 percent. The legal limit in Florida is 0.08 percent,&quot; the Associated Press reported. &quot;During a sobriety test, Mr. McMahon looked at the officer and said, &#x27;I&#x27;m too drunk. You got me,&#x27;&quot; a Santa Rosa County, Florida sheriff spokesperson said.

On April 9, 2012, it was reported that McMahon was targeted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for $104 million in bad loans made by Chicago-based Broadway Bank, where McMahon was a member of the board. The FDIC sought to recover $104 million in loans made by the bank before it was shut down. In addition to McMahon, six other former Broadway Bank board members and two former bank executives were targeted. McMahon approved only one of the 17 bad loans, which was used for the purchase of a $28 million Miami Beach condominium project. The FDIC said the bank lost $19.5 million on the loan. McMahon said in a statement that the FDIC&#x27;s claims were without merit and he expected to be vindicated. &quot;I am proud to have served as an outside, independent director for a brief part of the bank&#x27;s history,&quot; he wrote, according to the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;. In 2016, the FDIC settled its lawsuit against the bank with a $5 million settlement.

===Concussions===
In a November 6, 2010 interview, McMahon admitted to having memory problems due to injuries suffered on the football field. McMahon was quoted as saying, &quot;There are a lot of times when I walk into a room and forget why I walked in there.&quot;

Along with six other retired professional football players, McMahon filed a class action lawsuit against the NFL in August 2011, citing the league&#x27;s negligence and misconduct in its handling of concussion-related injuries. It followed lawsuits filed shortly before by 75 other NFL retirees making similar claims in addition to asserting that the NFL knew about the dangers concussions posed to its athletes as far back as the 1920s and actively withheld the information from the affected and the general public until summer of 2010. The August suit that McMahon joined seeks to expand the scope of the suit to potentially all NFL players who suffered game-related concussions or head injuries.

On September 27, 2012, it was reported that, at age 53, McMahon had been diagnosed as being in the early stages of dementia. 

The improvement in McMahon&#x27;s health was documented in 2017 by longtime &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; columnist Scott Ostler. McMahon expressed skepticism toward the effectiveness of NFL-sanctioned treatments for head and neck injuries, believing that NFL officials prioritize corporate interests over player well-being.

===Medical cannabis===

McMahon uses cannabis to treat the chronic pain and arthritis that he suffers from as a result of his football career. He has called cannabis a &quot;godsend&quot; that allowed him to eliminate his painkiller habit, which he says included 100 Percocet pills a month.

McMahon has been active in speaking about his experience using cannabis, serving as spokesperson for the Cannabis Sports Policy Project and a member of the Gridiron Cannabis Coalition along with several other former NFL players. McMahon appeared in a TV ad supporting a ballot measure to legalize cannabis in Arizona.

In November 2016, McMahon was among the signatories of an open letter addressed to the NFL, urging a change in the league&#x27;s policy towards cannabis. The letter was penned by Doctors for Cannabis Regulation and signed by several other NFL players. McMahon is also a member of the Doctors for Cannabis Regulation NFL steering committee.

===Other activities===

In December 2006, McMahon went to Iraq with the USO to visit American forces in the field.

During Super Bowl XLIV, McMahon joined other members of the 1985 Chicago Bears in resurrecting the Super Bowl Shuffle in a Boost Mobile commercial.

In 2010, McMahon became a part owner of the Indoor Football League&#x27;s Chicago Slaughter.

In November 2012, McMahon appeared on an episode of the sitcom &quot;The League&quot; called &quot;The Tailgate.&quot;

In August 2020, a documentary entitled &quot;Mad Mac: The Memory Of Jim McMahon&quot; by director CJ Wallis began shooting. The film covers McMahon&#x27;s life in and out of professional sports.

==Legacy==
Throughout his career, McMahon was known for both on- and off-field antics. His wearing of a headband while on the sidelines led to him being fined by then NFL commissioner, Pete Rozelle, since the headband had an unauthorized Adidas corporate logo on it. The next week, his headband simply said &quot;Rozelle&quot;. The commissioner later admitted in a letter to McMahon that the headband with Rozelle&#x27;s name was &quot;funny as hell&quot;, but declined to rescind the $5,000 fine. Prior to Super Bowl XX, hundreds of fans mailed McMahon headbands in hopes he would wear them during the game; Rozelle warned the quarterback not to wear anything &quot;unacceptable&quot;.

In response, McMahon decided to help bring attention to Juvenile Diabetes by wearing a headband simply stating &quot;JDF Cure&quot;, before switching to one stating &quot;POW-MIA&quot;, and finally one with the word &quot;Pluto&quot;, the nickname of his close friend and favorite collegiate receiving target, former BYU wide receiver Danny Plater, who was afflicted with a brain tumor.

McMahon is known for his trademark sunglasses, which he wears for medical reasons. At age six, while trying to untie a knot in a toy gun holster with a fork, he accidentally severed the cornea in his right eye when the fork slipped. While his vision was saved, the accident left that eye extremely sensitive to light. On the field he was among the first to wear a helmet fitted with a tinted plastic visor covering the eyes, leading to nicknames like &quot;Darth Vader&quot;.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
==Personal life==
McMahon met Nancy Daines at BYU, and the couple married in 1982 after four years of dating. They had four children together and divorced in 2009. He was in a romantic relationship with Laurie Navon, who was cited in the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article where his health was discussed. The specifics of his relationship with Navon are not known, but more recent media reports seem to indicate he may be in a relationship with Mayra Montoya.

<text>OK (), with spelling variations including okay, okeh, O.K. and many others, is an English word (originating in American English) denoting approval, acceptance, agreement, assent, acknowledgment, or a sign of indifference. &quot;OK&quot; is frequently used as a loanword in other languages. It has been described as the most frequently spoken or written word on the planet.

The origin of &quot;OK&quot; is disputed; however, most modern reference works hold that it originated around Boston as part of a fad in the late 1830s of abbreviating misspellings; that it is an initialism of &quot;oll korrect&quot; as a misspelling of &quot;all correct&quot;. This origin was first described by linguist Allen Walker Read in the 1960s.

As an adjective, &quot;OK&quot; principally means &quot;adequate&quot; or &quot;acceptable&quot; as a contrast to &quot;bad&quot; (&quot;The boss approved this, so it is OK to send out&quot;); it can also mean &quot;mediocre&quot; when used in contrast with &quot;good&quot; (&quot;The french fries were great, but the burger was just OK&quot;). It fulfills a similar role as an adverb (&quot;Wow, you did OK for your first time skiing!&quot;). As an interjection, it can denote compliance (&quot;OK, I will do that&quot;), or agreement (&quot;OK, that is fine&quot;). It can mean &quot;assent&quot; when it is used as a noun (&quot;the boss gave her the OK to the purchase&quot;) or, more colloquially, as a verb (&quot;the boss OKed the purchase&quot;). &quot;OK&quot;, as an adjective, can express acknowledgement without approval. As a versatile discourse marker or continuer, it can also be used with appropriate intonation to show doubt or to seek confirmation (&quot;OK?&quot;, &quot;Is that OK?&quot;). Some of this variation in use and shape of the word is also found in other languages.

==Etymologies==
Many explanations for the origin of the expression have been suggested, but few have been discussed seriously by linguists. The following proposals have found mainstream recognition.

===Boston abbreviation fad===
The etymology that most reference works provide today is based on a survey of the word&#x27;s early history in print: a series of six articles by Allen Walker Read in the journal &quot;American Speech&quot; in 1963 and 1964. He tracked the spread and evolution of the word in American newspapers and other written documents, and later throughout the rest of the world. He also documented controversy surrounding &quot;OK&quot; and the history of its folk etymologies, both of which are intertwined with the history of the word itself. Read argues that, at the time of the expression&#x27;s first appearance in print, a broader fad existed in the United States of &quot;comical misspellings&quot; and of forming and employing acronyms, themselves based on colloquial speech patterns:

The general fad is speculated to have existed in spoken or informal written U.S. English for a decade or more before its appearance in newspapers. &quot;OK&quot;″s original presentation as &quot;all correct&quot; was later varied with spellings such as &quot;Oll Korrect&quot; or even &quot;Ole Kurreck&quot;.

The term appears to have achieved national prominence in 1840, when supporters of the Democratic political party claimed during the 1840 United States presidential election that it stood for &quot;Old Kinderhook&quot;, a nickname for the Democratic president and candidate for reelection, Martin Van Buren, a native of Kinderhook, New York. &quot;Vote for OK&quot; was snappier than using his Dutch name. In response, Whig opponents attributed &quot;OK&quot;, in the sense of &quot;Oll Korrect&quot;, to the bad spelling of Andrew Jackson, Van Buren&#x27;s predecessor. The country-wide publicity surrounding the election appears to have been a critical event in &quot;OK&quot;″s history, widely and suddenly popularizing it across the United States.

Read proposed an etymology of &quot;OK&quot; in &quot;Old Kinderhook&quot; in 1941. The evidence presented in that article was somewhat sparse, and the connection to &quot;Oll Korrect&quot; not fully elucidated. Various challenges to the etymology were presented; e.g., Heflin&#x27;s 1962 article. However, Read&#x27;s landmark 1963–1964 papers silenced most of the skepticism. Read&#x27;s etymology gained immediate acceptance, and is now offered without reservation in most dictionaries. Read himself was nevertheless open to evaluating alternative explanations:

===Choctaw===
In &quot;All Mixed Up&quot;, the folk singer Pete Seeger sang that &quot;OK&quot; was of Choctaw origin, as the dictionaries of the time tended to agree. Three major American reference works (Webster&#x27;s, New Century, Funk &amp; Wagnalls) cited this etymology as the probable origin until as late as 1961.

The earliest written evidence for the Choctaw origin is provided in work by the Christian missionaries Cyrus Byington and Alfred Wright in 1825. These missionaries ended many sentences in their translation of the Bible with the particle &quot;okeh&quot;, meaning &quot;it is so&quot;, which was listed as an alternative spelling in the 1913 Webster&#x27;s.

Byington&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of the Choctaw Language&quot; confirms the ubiquity of the &quot;okeh&quot; particle, and his &quot;Grammar of the Choctaw Language&quot; calls the particle &quot;-keh&quot; an &quot;affirmative contradistinctive&quot;, with the &quot;distinctive&quot; o- prefix.

The Choctaw language was one of the languages spoken at this time in the Southeastern United States by a tribe with significant contact with African slaves. The major language of trade in this area, Mobilian Jargon, was based on Choctaw-Chickasaw, two Muskogean-family languages. This language was used, in particular, for communication with the slave-owning Cherokee (an Iroquoian-family language). For the three decades prior to the Boston abbreviation fad, the Choctaw had been in extensive negotiation with the U.S. government, after having fought alongside them at the Battle of New Orleans.

Arguments for a more Southern origin for the word note the tendency of English to adopt loan words in language contact situations, as well as the ubiquity of the OK particle. Similar particles exist in native language groups distinct from Iroquoian (Algonquian, Cree cf. &quot;ekosi&quot;).

===West African===
An early attestation of the particle &#x27;kay&#x27; is found in a 1784 transcription of a North Carolina slave, who, seeking to avoid being flogged, explained being found asleep in the canoe he had been ordered to bring to a certain place to pick up a European exploring near his newly-purchased property :

A West African (Mande and/or Bantu) etymology has been argued in scholarly sources, tracing the word back to word &quot;waw-kay&quot; or the Mande (aka &quot;Mandinke&quot; or &quot;Mandingo&quot;) phrase &quot;o ke&quot;.

David Dalby first made the claim that the particle &quot;OK&quot; could have African origins in the 1969 Hans Wolff Memorial Lecture. His argument was reprinted in various newspaper articles between 1969 and 1971. This suggestion has also been mentioned by Joseph Holloway, who argued in the 1993 book &quot;The African Heritage of American English&quot; (co-written with a retired missionary) that various West African languages have near-homophone discourse markers with meanings such as &quot;yes indeed&quot; or which serve as part of the back-channeling repertoire. Frederic Cassidy challenged Dalby&#x27;s claims, asserting that there is no documentary evidence that any of these African-language words had any causal link with its use in the American press.

The West African hypothesis had not been accepted by 1981 by any etymologists, yet has since appeared in scholarly sources published by linguists and non-linguists alike.

===Alternative etymologies===
A large number of origins have been proposed. Some of them are thought to fall into the category of folk etymology and are proposed based merely on apparent similarity between &quot;OK&quot; and one or another phrase in a foreign language with a similar meaning and sound. Some examples are:
* A corruption from the speech of the large number of descendants of Scottish and Ulster Scots (Scots-Irish) immigrants to North America, of the common Scots phrase &quot;och aye&quot; (&quot;oh yes&quot;).
* A borrowing of the Greek phrase (), meaning &quot;all good&quot;.

==Early history in print==
Allen Walker Read identifies the earliest known use of &quot;O.K.&quot; in print as 1839, in the edition of 23 March of the &quot;Boston Morning Post&quot;. The announcement of a trip by the Anti-Bell-Ringing Society (a &quot;frolicsome group&quot; according to Read) received attention from the Boston papers. Charles Gordon Greene wrote about the event using the line that is widely regarded as the first instance of this strain of &quot;OK&quot;, complete with gloss:

Read gives a number of subsequent appearances in print. Seven instances were accompanied with glosses that were variations on &quot;all correct&quot; such as &quot;oll korrect&quot; or &quot;ole kurreck&quot;, but five appeared with no accompanying explanation, suggesting that the word was expected to be well known to readers and possibly in common colloquial use at the time.

Various claims of earlier usage have been made. For example, it was claimed that the phrase appeared in a 1790 court record from Sumner County, Tennessee, discovered in 1859 by a Tennessee historian named Albigence Waldo Putnam, in which Andrew Jackson apparently said &quot;proved a bill of sale from Hugh McGary to Gasper Mansker, for a Negro man, which was O.K.&quot;. The lawyer who successfully argued many Indian rights claims, Felix S. Cohen, supported the Jacksonian popularization of the term based on its Choctaw origin:
David Dalby brought up a 1941 reference dating the term to 1815. The apparent notation &quot;we arrived ok&quot; appears in the hand-written diary of William Richardson traveling from Boston to New Orleans about a month after the Battle of New Orleans. However, Frederic Cassidy asserts that he personally tracked down this diary, writing:
Similarly, H. L. Mencken, who originally considered it &quot;very clear that &#x27;o. k.&#x27; is actually in the manuscript&quot;, later recanted his endorsement of the expression, asserting that it was used no earlier than 1839. Mencken (following Read) described the diary entry as a misreading of the author&#x27;s self-correction, and stated it was in reality the first two letters of the words &quot;a h[andsome]&quot; before noticing the phrase had been used in the previous line and changing his mind.

Another example given by Dalby is a Jamaican planter&#x27;s diary of 1816, which records a black slave saying &quot;Oh ki, massa, doctor no need be fright, we no want to hurt him&quot;. Cassidy asserts that this is a misreading of the source, which actually begins &quot;Oh, ki, massa ...&quot;, where &quot;ki&quot; is a phrase by itself:

==Variations==
Whether this word is printed as OK, Ok, ok, okay, or O.K. is a matter normally resolved in the style manual for the publication involved. Dictionaries and style guides such as &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; and &quot;The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage&quot; provide no consensus. Whilst most variants have descended from the root &quot;OK&quot;, &quot;okay&quot; predominates in edited English as it permits easier modification (e.g. by pluralising).

===International usage===


==Gesture==
In the United States and much of Europe a related gesture is made by touching the index finger with the thumb (forming a rough circle) and raising of the remaining fingers. It is not known whether the gesture is derived from the expression, or if the gesture appeared first. The gesture was popularized in the United States in 1840 as a symbol to support then-presidential candidate and incumbent vice president Martin Van Buren. This was because Van Buren&#x27;s nickname, Old Kinderhook, derived from his hometown of Kinderhook, NY, had the initials O.K. Similar gestures have different meanings in other cultures, some offensive, others devotional.

==Computers==

&quot;OK&quot; is used to label buttons in modal dialog boxes such as error messages or print dialogs, indicating that the user can press the button to accept the contents of the dialog box and continue. When the dialog box contains only one button, it is almost always labeled &quot;OK&quot;. When there are two buttons, they are most commonly labeled &quot;OK&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot;. &quot;OK&quot; is commonly rendered in upper case and without punctuation: &quot;OK&quot;, rather than &quot;O.K. or&quot; &quot;Okay.&quot; The &quot;OK&quot; button can probably be traced to user interface research done for the Apple Lisa.

The Forth programming language prints &quot;ok&quot; when ready to accept input from the keyboard. This prompt is used on Sun, Apple, and other computers with the Forth-based Open Firmware (OpenBoot). The appearance of &quot;ok&quot; in inappropriate contexts is the subject of some humor.

In the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), upon which the World Wide Web is based, a successful response from the server is defined as &quot;OK&quot; (with the numerical code 200 as specified in RFC 2616). The Session Initiation Protocol also defines a response, &quot;200 OK&quot;, which conveys success for most requests (RFC 3261).

Some Linux distributions, including those based on Red Hat Linux, display boot progress on successive lines on-screen, which include &quot;[ OK ]&quot;.

<text>John Joseph Dunn (October 6, 1872 – October 22, 1928) was an American pitcher and infielder in Major League Baseball at the turn of the 20th century who later became a minor league baseball club owner.

==Early life and playing career==
Dunn was born in Meadville, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Bayonne, New Jersey. When he was nine, a boxcar ran over his left arm while playing at a local railway. He was told by doctors that his arm had to be either amputated or risk death. He declined an amputation, but his arm was left crippled from above the elbow and couldn&#x27;t lift the arm above his neck.

In 1896 Dunn played for Toronto in the Eastern League, and the following year he reached the major leagues as a pitcher for the Brooklyn Bridegrooms. He bounced around the majors for seven years, having one good season with the Bridegrooms in 1899, with a 23–13 record. When he wasn&#x27;t playing, Dunn studied how the game worked from the sidelines. He was also a third baseman and shortstop. After 1904, he pitched and managed in the minors for a few seasons, winning an International League pennant in 1905.

==Minor league ownership==
In 1907, Dunn took over as manager of the Baltimore Orioles, a minor league club with no connection to the current major league team by that name. He bought the team on November 16, 1909, for $70,000. He allegedly received a $10,000 loan from Philadelphia Athletics owner/manager Connie Mack. He developed a minor league powerhouse by scouting and developing his own players. He allegedly signed players by how they looked instead of skill, sometimes never seeing a player play before offering a contract.

In 1914, the Orioles were running away with the league pennant but losing money at the box office because of a rival team in town from the new aspiring &quot;third major league&quot;, the Federal League. The Baltimore Terrapins played at their new steel-beamed modern stadium, Terrapin Park, which was across the street from his older &quot;American League Park&quot; of 1901 from the club&#x27;s days in the beginnings of the &quot;upstart&quot; American League. To make his payroll, Dunn had to move the team to Richmond, Virginia, and sell off his star player, Babe Ruth, and 11 other players to the majors. He later said that selling Ruth was his biggest regret. Dunn was indirectly responsible for Ruth&#x27;s famous nickname, with Ruth&#x27;s teammates referring to him as &quot;Dunn&#x27;s $10,000 Babe&quot; for the price he drew.

The team moved back to Baltimore in 1916, and Dunn again put together a juggernaut, ultimately signing 10 more players who went on to have solid major league careers. The best of these was pitcher Lefty Grove, who went 109–36 as an Oriole between 1920 and 1924. By that time, Dunn&#x27;s team was in the midst of winning seven straight International League championships, many by huge margins. In addition to Grove, Dunn discovered other quality major leaguers such as Ernie Shore, Jack Bentley, Tommy Thomas, George Earnshaw, and Dick Porter.

Dunn&#x27;s team was regarded as the equal of many major league teams, and he kept them so by refusing to trade or sell players to the majors. It wasn&#x27;t until the 1925 off-season, when the other, struggling teams in the league made an agreement with the majors on a set price for transferring players, that Dunn finally relented and began selling his stars for money. His team won one more league title in 1925 and then dropped back into the pack.

Dunn&#x27;s son, Jack Dunn Jr., played for the Orioles in 1914, 1918, and 1922, and was secretary and co-manager for several years until his death from pneumonia in 1923. Dunn&#x27;s grandson, Jack Dunn III (1921-1987), managed the club in 1949.

Dunn ran the Orioles until his death from a heart attack in Baltimore on October 22, 1928.

<doc id="167104" wikidata="Q831454" url="?curid=167104" title="Culture of Japan">
<text>Japanese culture has changed greatly over the millennia, from the country&#x27;s prehistoric Jōmon period, to its contemporary modern culture, which absorbs influences from Asia and other regions of the world.

Since the Jomon period, ancestral groups like the Yayoi and Kofun, who arrived to Japan from Korea and China, respectively, have shaped Japanese culture. Rice cultivation and centralized leadership were introduced by these groups, shaping Japanese culture. Chinese dynasties, particularly the Tang dynasty, have influenced Japanese culture throughout history and brought it into the Sinosphere. After 220 years of isolation, the Meiji era opened Japan to Western influences, enriching and diversifying Japanese culture. Popular culture shows how much contemporary Japanese culture influences the world.

== Identity ==

There are two competing hypotheses that try to explain the lineage of the Japanese people.

The first hypothesis proposes a dual-structure model, in which Japanese populations are descendants of the indigenous Jōmon people and later arrivals of people from the East Eurasian continent, known as the Yayoi people. Japan&#x27;s indigenous culture originates primarily from the Yayoi people who settled in Japan between 1000 BCE and 300 CE. Yayoi culture spread to the main island of Honshu, mixing with the native Jōmon culture. Modern Japanese have an estimated 80% Yayoi and 20% Jōmon ancestry.

The second hypothesis proposes a tripartite model of genomic origin. This hypothesis proposes that contemporary Japanese people are from three distinct ancestral groups: Jōmon, Yayoi and Kofun, with 13%, 16% and 71% of genetic ancestry, respectively. During the Kofun period, it is said that migrant groups from China came to Japan and settled on the island, bringing with them various cultural advances and centralized leadership. The migrants who came to Japan during the Kofun period appear to have had ancestry that mainly resembles the ancestry of the Han Chinese population of China. The Jomon people were hunter-gathers; the Yayoi people introduced rice cultivation; and the Kofun migrants introduced imperial state formation.

Japanese culture was influenced from ancient times to the Middle Ages primarily by multiple Chinese dynasties, with substantial derivation from the Tang dynasty, and to a lesser extent by other Asian countries. For example, one of the scripts for writing in the Japanese language is Chinese characters (kanji), but Japanese has no genetic relationship with Chinese. Since the Meiji era, Japan has been primarily influenced by Western countries.

The inhabitants of Japan experienced a long period of relative isolation from the outside world for over 220 years during the Tokugawa shogunate until the arrival of the &quot;Black Ships&quot; and the Meiji era.

Today, the culture of Japan stands as one of the most influential cultures around the world, mainly because of the global reach of its popular culture. In 2023, U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked Japan&#x27;s cultural influence as the highest in Asia and 4th worldwide.

== Language ==

Japanese is the national and primary language of Japan. The language is a lexically distinct pitch-accent system. Early Japanese is known primarily by its state in the 8th century when the three major works of Old Japanese were compiled. The earliest attestation of the Japanese language was found in a Chinese document from 256 CE. However, the Japanese language has no genetic relationship with Chinese, nor any clear affiliation with any other language. While there are a number of theories about the origins of Japanese, the strongest arguments for affiliation are with Korean on the basis of similar syntax. More controversially, it has also been paired with Altaic languages due to a similar number of systems and verb forms. While Japanese is the only official language of Japan, other languages such as Ainu and Ryukyuan are spoken on the Japanese islands.

Written Japanese uses a combination of three scripts: Chinese characters pronounced as &quot;kanji&quot; in Japanese, hiragana, and katakana. Japan had no writing system prior to adopting kanji from China in 751 CE, and like Chinese, kanji are used extensively in Japanese as logograms. Presently, there is a notable number of kanji in modern Japanese with a different meaning from the corresponding character used in modern Chinese. Modern Japanese also features far fewer simplified Chinese characters in comparison to modern Chinese as Japanese typically uses fewer kanji, mainly for nouns, adjective stems, and verb stems. Both hiragana and katakana are phonetic syllabaries derived from the Chinese of the 5th century. Hiragana and katakana were developed from simplified kanji; hiragana emerged somewhere around the 9th century and were mainly used by women for informal language while katakana was mainly used by men in formal language. By the 10th century, both systems were used commonly by everyone.

Japanese vocabulary consists of 49% words of Chinese origin, 33% words of Japanese origin, and 18% loanwords from other languages, including European languages, words of mixed origin, and the made-in-Japan pseudo-English known as wasei-eigo. The Latin alphabet is often used in modern Japanese, especially for company names, logos, advertising, and when inputting Japanese into a computer. The Hindu–Arabic numerals are often used for numbers and can be read in either Japanese or English, but traditional Sino–Japanese numerals are also common. The influence of Japanese culture in the Western world over the past few centuries has led to many of its terms, such as &quot;origami&quot;, &quot;tsunami&quot;, &quot;karaoke,&quot; and pop cultural terms like &quot;shonen&quot; and &quot;shōjo&quot; being incorporated into the English language. Words like these have also been added to the Oxford English Dictionary.

==Religion==


Shinto and Buddhism are the primary religions of Japan. According to the annual statistical research on religion in 2018 by the Government of Japan&#x27;s Agency for Culture Affairs, 66.7 percent of the population practices Buddhism, 25.6 percent practices Shintoism, 7.7 percent other religions. According to the annual statistical research on religion in 2018 by the Government of Japan&#x27;s Agency for Culture Affairs, about two million or around 1.5% of Japan&#x27;s population are Christians. Other religions include Islam (70,000) and Judaism (2,000), which are largely immigrant communities with some ethnic Japanese practitioners.

===Shinto===

Shinto is an ethnic religion focusing on ceremonies and rituals. In Shinto, followers believe that – Shinto deities or spirits – are present throughout nature, including rocks, trees, and mountains. Humans can also be considered to possess a . One of the goals of Shinto is to maintain or strengthen the connection between humans, nature, and . The religion developed in Japan prior to the 6th century CE, after which point followers built shrines to worship .

===Buddhism===

Buddhism developed in India around the 6th and 4th centuries BCE and eventually spread through the Sinosphere and South East Asia. It arrived in Japan during the 6th century CE, where it was initially unpopular. Most Japanese people were unable to understand the difficult philosophical messages present in Buddhism; however, an appreciation for the religion&#x27;s art is believed to have led to Buddhism later growing in popularity.

Buddhism is concerned with the cycle of rebirth and karma. In Buddhism, a person&#x27;s status in society is considered unimportant, instead their good or bad deeds are valued, as every person eventually becomes ill, ages, dies, and is eventually reincarnated into a new life, a cycle known as ; the suffering people experience during life is considered to be one way for people to ensure a better future, with the ultimate goal of Buddhism being to escape the cycle of death and rebirth by attaining true insight.

===Christianity===

Christianity was introduced in the 16th century. When the religion was banned during the 17th century, a group of hidden Christians blended Christian theology with Shinto and Buddhist practices. Hidden Christian Sites in the Nagasaki Region have become World Heritage Sites, and the unique style of Christian art is now recognized.

Despite being a minority religion in Japan, Christian chapel marriage ceremonies are a popular wedding style in Japan.

=== Islam ===

A minority of Japanese are Muslims. Cultural differences and a predominantly non-Muslim society present unique challenges for Japan&#x27;s Muslim community, mostly immigrants from Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Iran.

Muslims are scattered in Japan. Mosques and halal food are scarce due to their dispersion. Family-linked long-term residents are assimilating into Japanese society despite language and cultural barriers. Analysts say the small Muslim community and cultural differences between Islam and Japan reduce future conflicts. Syncretic Sufi Islam may increase Japan&#x27;s Muslim population.

==National character==

The Japanese &quot;national character&quot; has been written about under the term , literally meaning &#x27;theories/discussions about the Japanese people&#x27; and referring to texts on matters that are normally the concerns of sociology, psychology, history, linguistics, and philosophy, but emphasizing the authors&#x27; assumptions or perceptions of Japanese exceptionalism; these are predominantly written in Japan by Japanese people, though examples have also been written by foreign residents, journalists and even scholars.
==Literature==
Early works of Japanese literature were heavily influenced by cultural contact with China and Chinese literature, often written in Classical Chinese. Eventually, Japanese literature developed into a separate style in its own right as Japanese writers began writing their own works about Japan. &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;, written by Murasaki Shikibu during the Heian period, is known worldwide as a unique Japanese literature. Since Japan reopened its ports to Western trading and diplomacy in the 19th century, Western and Eastern literature have strongly affected each other and continue to do so.

==Visual arts ==


Japanese calligraphy, rendered using flowing, brush-drawn strokes, is considered to be a traditional art form, as well as a means of conveying written information. Typical calligraphic works can consist of phrases, poems, stories, or even characters represented by themselves; the style and format of the calligraphy can mimic the subject matter through aspects such as the texture of the writing and the speed of the brush strokes. Several different styles of Japanese calligraphy exist, with considerable effort put into the outcome; in some cases, it can take over one hundred attempts to produce the desired result of a single character. This form of calligraphy is known as , literally meaning &#x27;the way of writing or calligraphy&#x27;, or more commonly, , &#x27;learning how to write characters&#x27;. Commonly confused with calligraphy is the art form of , literally meaning &#x27;ink painting&#x27;, which is the art of painting a scene or object using diluted black ink.

Painting has been an art in Japan for a very long time: the brush is a traditional writing and painting tool, and the extension of that to its use as an artist&#x27;s tool was probably natural. Japanese painters are often categorized by what they painted, as most of them constrained themselves solely to subjects such as animals, landscapes, or figures. Chinese papermaking was introduced to Japan around the 7th century. Later, was developed from it. Native Japanese painting techniques are still in use today, as well as techniques adopted from continental Asia and from the West. Schools of painting such as the Kano school of the 16th century became known for their bold brush strokes and contrast between light and dark, especially after Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu began to use this style. Famous Japanese painters include Kanō Sanraku, Maruyama Ōkyo, and Tani Bunchō.

Ukiyo-e, literally means &#x27;pictures of the floating world&#x27;, is a genre of woodblock prints that exemplifies the characteristics of pre-Meiji Japanese art. Because these prints could be mass-produced, they were available to a wide cross-section of the Japanese populace – those not wealthy enough to afford original paintings – during their heyday, from the 17th to 20th century.

Japanese lacquerware and ceramics have historically gained international fame, and lacquerware has been actively exported since the Muromachi period and ceramics since the Edo period. Japanese crafts became known in Europe after Nanban trade.

 is the Japanese art of flower arrangement. It has gained widespread international fame for its focus on harmony, color use, rhythm, and elegantly simple design. It is an art centered greatly on expressing the seasons and is meant to act as a symbol to something greater than the flower itself.

==Traditional clothing==


The kimono is the national garment of Japan, having developed from Chinese court clothing in the Nara period following the exchange of diplomatic envoys between the two countries at that time. The word &quot;kimono&quot; translates literally as &#x27;thing to wear on the shoulders&#x27;; however, this term developed some time around the Edo period, before which most kimono-like garments were referred to as the (), with longer-sleeved garments being known as ().

The earliest versions of the kimono were heavily influenced by traditional Chinese clothing, known today as ( in Japanese). This influence was spread through Japanese envoy missions to China, resulting in extensive Chinese cultural adoption by Japan as early as the 5th century CE. It was during the 8th century, however, that Chinese fashions came fully into style, and following the cancellation of the 20th mission to Tang dynasty China, these fashions developed independently, with the overlapping, V-shaped collar becoming women&#x27;s fashion and the precursor to the modern kimono.

Kimono, alongside all other items of traditional Japanese clothing, are known collectively as , meaning &#x27;Japanese clothing&#x27;, as opposed to , Western-style clothing. Kimono come in a variety of colors, styles, and sizes. Men mainly wear darker or more muted colors, while women tend to wear brighter colors and pastels, and, especially for younger women, often with complicated abstract or floral patterns.

In previous decades, married women wore short sleeved kimono, whereas unmarried women wore long sleeved kimono to both formal and informal occasions; however, the rise in both the average age of marriage and the numbers of women never marrying in Japan has led to the divide between sleeve length becoming one more of age, with most women in their early twenties wearing long sleeved kimono only to formal occasions, and most women past their early twenties wearing short sleeved kimono to formal events, regardless of marriage status. Other developments include the abandoning of layered kimono and the standardisation of the length of short sleeved women&#x27;s kimono to a range of roughly in length, both developments driven by fabric shortages in WWII.

The coat is another form of traditional clothing. A (commonly Anglicised as &quot;happy&quot;) coat is a straight sleeved coat typically decorated with a family crest and/or kanji along the collar. In previous centuries, -style coats known as or simply hikeshi banten were commonly worn by firefighters; the coats would be constructed from several layers of heavy cotton stitched together, and would be soaked in water to provide protection from fire.

Alongside traditional clothing, Japan also has distinct footwear; , ankle-length split-toed socks, are commonly worn with the kimono, and are designed to be worn with traditional shoes such as geta and zōri. Geta are thonged sandals mounted on wooden blocks extending from the base of the shoe to the floor, and are worn by men and women with kimono or ; zōri are flat-based or sloping sandals made of a number of different materials, and are considered to be more formal than geta.

Fashion trends and consumer apathy have hurt the Japanese kimono industry. Kimono sales and traditional tailors suffered after WWII due to Western fashion. Innovative and diverse kimono makers have revived the declining industry. Internationally, the industry has tried casual styles. Cultural appropriation is hard. The Boston Museum of Fine Arts&#x27; &quot;Kimono Wednesdays&quot; led to cultural appropriation debates. Asian-American protesters cited Orientalism, racism, and cultural appropriation. Protests sparked global cultural debate and appropriation. The protests lacked Japanese and Japanese-American representation, say critics. Scholars say Edward Said&#x27;s &quot;Orientalism&quot; may not always apply (O&#x27;Dwyer, 2015).

Cultural appropriation could harm kimono exhibitions. War can hinder cultural exchange and Japanese fashion abroad. Japanese mainstream media and cultural commentators rarely mention it. Cultural appropriation may lead to kimono experimentation, say Japanese commentators. Cultural appropriation and Japanese fashion remain hot topics. Globally, the industry must balance cultural integrity and innovation (O&#x27;Dwyer, 2015).

==Installation arts==

Japanese architecture was originally heavily influenced by Chinese architecture and later developed many unique aspects indigenous to Japan. Examples of traditional architecture are seen at temples, Shinto shrines, and castles in Kyoto and Nara. Some of these buildings are constructed with traditional gardens, which are influenced by Zen ideas. Some modern architects, such as Yoshio Taniguchi and Tadao Ando are known for their amalgamation of Japanese traditional and Western architectural influences.

Traditional Japanese garden architecture is considered to hold the same importance as traditional building architecture, and both are influenced by similar historical and religious backgrounds. A primary design principle of a traditional garden is the creation of the landscape based on, or at least greatly influenced by, the style of three-dimensional monochrome ink () landscape painting known as or ; as such, garden landscaping is elevated to the status of an artform in Japan.

Traditional Japanese sculptures mainly focused on Buddhist images, such as Tathagata, Bodhisattva, and Myō-ō. The oldest sculpture in Japan is a wooden statue of Amitābha at the Zenkō-ji temple. In the Nara period, Buddhist statues were made by the national government to boost its prestige. These examples are seen in present-day Nara and Kyoto, most notably a colossal bronze statue of the Buddha Vairocana in the Tōdai-ji temple.

Wood has traditionally been used as the chief material in Japan, along with traditional Japanese architecture. Statues are often lacquered, gilded, or brightly painted, although there are commonly few traces of this on the surface. Bronze and other metals are generally not used. Other materials, such as stone and pottery, have had extremely important roles in traditional sculpture.

==Music==
The music of Japan includes a wide array of styles both distinctly traditional and modern. Traditional Japanese music is quite different from Western music and is based on the intervals of human breathing rather than mathematical timing; traditional music also typically slides between notes, a feature also not commonly found in Western music. The word for music in Japanese is &quot;ongaku&quot; (音楽), combining the kanji &quot;on&quot; (音, &quot;sound&quot;) with the kanji &quot;gaku&quot; (楽, &quot;enjoyment&quot;). Major aesthetic concepts are &quot;jo-ha-kyū&quot; and &quot;ma&quot;. &quot;Jo-ha-kyū&quot; (序破急) roughly translates to &quot;beginning, break, rapid&quot;, it essentially means that all actions or efforts should begin slowly, speed up, and then end swiftly. &quot;Ma&quot; literally means a space or interval between two points (in space or time). In music, it refers to rhythm. In &quot;nagauta&quot; (長唄, literally &quot;long song&quot;) (played on the shamisen and used in kabuki theater), &quot;uki-ma&quot; implies a slight lengthening of the first of a pair of beats, while &quot;tsume-ma&quot; implies the reverse. It is this meaning of timing that is seen as a unique aesthetic to explain otherwise inexplicable aspects of Japanese performing arts. Japanese music stresses sound quality and prizes the richness and complexity of each instrument&#x27;s sound spectrum. Noise is also used in a highly formalized manner to imitate &quot;nature&quot; and the expressive energy and artistic potential of noise are accepted and incorporated.

=== History of Traditional Music ===
Traditional Japanese music finds its first major historic periods in the Nara (710–794) and Heian (794–1185) periods. The two most common kinds of music during this time were the music of the court (Gagaku) and the music of Buddhist rituals (shōmyō). The music of the Nara period can be classified as belonging to the first international period in Japanese music history. The court music was all of Chinese, Korean, or Indian origin and was played primarily by foreign musicians in its original style. Gagaku classical music has been performed at the Imperial court since the Heian period. At the same time, Buddhist ritual music exerted some influence on the native vocal style. While poetry anthologies indicate that folk music had continued its steady pace, the historical records and relics show us music that was primarily instrumental and often connected with dance. By the time of the Kamakura period, most traces of the international character of Japanese music had disappeared. Court music in general was declining, while there was a steady growth of more theatrical arts. The indigenous folk ritual music of flute and drums here encountered the aristocratic aesthetic of poetry and literary tales. Japan&#x27;s indigenous musical culture can still be found in much of folk music and the music of Shinto festivals in local communities.

=== Traditional Instruments ===
Several traditional instruments were adopted and assimilated into Japanese culture from various sources. They were further experimented with and developed by Japan. One of the imported end-blown bamboo flutes from China developed into the &quot;shakuhachi&quot;, which became the ritual instrument of the &quot;Fuke&quot; sect of Zen monks. By the middle of the eighteenth century, in secular performances, the &quot;shamisen lute&quot; and &quot;koto&quot;, invented in China and brought to Japan during the Nara Period, 13-string &quot;zither&quot; as used for genteel entertainment and professionally controlled by blind musicians who had the rights to &quot;heike&quot; narrative. The &quot;shamisen&quot;, modified from the Chinese sanxian introduced via the Ryukyu Islands in the late sixteenth century, came into its own in the theatrical contexts of &quot;bunraku&quot; puppet drama and &quot;kabuki&quot; drama.

=== Modern Music ===
Japan is the second largest music market in the world behind the United States, and is the largest in Asia, with most of the market dominated by Japanese artists. Local music often appears at karaoke venues on lease from record labels.

Western music has been adopted and adapted to the Japanese context and has often in the process become Japanized (domesticated) and different from its model. Hybrid music has resulted, such as &quot;enka, J-pop&quot;, and ‘contemporary Japanese music’ (&quot;gendai hōgaku&quot;) or ‘new Japanese music’ (&quot;shin-hōgaku&quot;). Famous enka singers include Hibari Misora, Saburo Kitajima, Ikuzo Yoshi, and Haruo Minami. One notable contemporary influence on Japanese musical music came from Ainu music and the so-called nationalist composer Ifukube Akiraa (b. 1914 in Hokkaido) who brought the &quot;tonkori&quot; zither onto the World Music scene.

In the late 20th century Japanese music rose in popularity with &quot;Aidoru&quot; (Japanese Idols) with popular audition shows such as the Suta¯tanjo¯(A Star Is Born). Japanese music further evolved in the jazz, pop, R&amp;B, and Rock music genres and continues into today. Popular artists of the 20th-21st centuries include Yoko Ono, Suzuka Nakamoto, Koji Tamaki, Hideto Takarai, Takahiro Moriuchi, Kenshi Yonezu, and Haruomi Hosono. Popular groups of the same eras include The Oral Cigarettes, Yoasobi, Bump of Chicken, King Gnu, Mrs. Green Apple, Fishmans, and Perfume.

==Performing arts==
The four traditional theatres from Japan are noh (or ), , kabuki, and . Noh had its origins in the union of the , with music and dance made by Kan&#x27;ami and Zeami Motokiyo. Among the characteristic aspects of it are the masks, costumes, and the stylized gestures, sometimes accompanied by a fan that can represent other objects. The Noh programs are presented in alternation with the ones of , traditionally in numbers of five, but currently in groups of three.

The , of a humorous character, had an older origin, in 8th century entertainment brought from China, developing itself in . In , masks are rarely used and even if the plays can be associated with the ones of noh, currently many are not.

Kabuki appears in the beginning of the Edo period from the representations and dances of Izumo no Okuni in Kyoto. Due to concerns over the number of actresses engaged in selling sex, the participation of women in the plays was forbidden by the government in 1629, and the feminine characters had passed to be represented only by men (). Recent attempts to reintroduce actresses in kabuki had not been well accepted. Another characteristic of kabuki is the use of makeup for the actors in historical plays () and the performance of ballads.

Japanese puppet theater () developed in the same period as kabuki, in both competition with and collaboration with its actors and authors. The origin of , however, is older, beginning in the Heian period. In 1914, the Takarazuka Revue was founded, a company solely composed by women who introduced the revue to Japan.

==Sports and leisure==
In the long feudal period governed by the samurai class, some methods that were used to train warriors were developed into well-ordered martial arts, in modern times referred to collectively as . Examples include , and sumo, all of which were established in the Edo period. After the rapid social change in the Meiji Restoration, some martial arts changed into modern sports, called . Judo was developed by Kanō Jigorō, who studied some sects of jujutsu. These sports are still widely practiced in present-day Japan and other countries.

Baseball, association football, and other popular Western sports were imported to Japan in the Meiji period. These sports are commonly practiced in schools, along with traditional martial arts. Baseball, soccer, football, and ping pong are the most popular sports in Japan. Association football gained prominence in Japan after the J League (Japan Professional Football League) was established in 1991. Japan also co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with Korea. In addition, there are many semi-professional organizations, which are sponsored by private companies: for example, volleyball, basketball, rugby union, table tennis, and so on.

==Cuisine==
Through a long culinary past, the Japanese have developed sophisticated and refined cuisine. In more recent years, Japanese food has become fashionable and popular in the United States, Europe, and many other areas. Dishes such as sushi, tempura, noodles, and teriyaki are some of the foods that are commonly known. The Japanese diet consists principally of rice; fresh, lean seafood; and pickled or boiled vegetables. The Japanese diet is often believed to be related to the longevity of Japanese people.

Despite the traditional cuisine (和食 washoku) being very important and present, western cuisine (洋食 &quot;yōshoku&quot;) has influenced Japanese eating culture tremendously.

==Popular culture==

Japanese popular culture not only reflects the attitudes and concerns of the present day but also provides a link to the past. Popular films, television programs, manga, music, anime and video games all developed from older artistic and literary traditions, and many of their themes and styles of presentation can be traced to traditional art forms. Contemporary forms of popular culture, much like the traditional forms, provide not only entertainment but also an escape for the contemporary Japanese from the problems of an industrial world. Many anime and manga series are very popular around the world and continue to become popular, as well as Japanese video games, fashion, and game shows.

In the late 1980s, the family was the focus of leisure activities, such as excursions to parks or shopping districts. Although Japan is often thought of as a hard-working society with little time for leisure, the Japanese seek entertainment wherever they can. It is common to see Japanese commuters riding the train to work, enjoying their favorite manga, or listening through earphones to the latest in popular music. A wide variety of types of popular entertainment are available. There is a large selection of music, films, and the products of a huge manga and anime industry, among other forms of entertainment, from which to choose. Game centers, bowling alleys, and karaoke are popular hangout places for teens while older people may play or in specialized parlors. Together, the publishing, film/video, music/audio, and game industries in Japan make up the growing Japanese content industry.

==Cultural landscapes==
There are 51 official in Japan. These landscapes evolved with the way of life and geocultural features of a region, and which are indispensable for understanding the lifestyle of the Japanese people.

The is the canonical list of Japan&#x27;s three most celebrated scenic sights, attributed to 1643 scholar Hayashi Gahō. These are the pine-clad islands of Matsushima in Miyagi Prefecture, the pine-clad sandbar of Amanohashidate in Kyoto Prefecture, and Itsukushima Shrine in Hiroshima Prefecture. In 1915, the New Three Views of Japan were selected with a national election by the . In 2003, the Three Major Night Views of Japan were selected by the .

==National symbols==

The Japanese archipelago is located to the east of the Asian continent. Japan is regarded as the most eastern Asian country, because east of Japan is the vast Pacific Ocean. Minamitorishima is Japan&#x27;s easternmost island. Thus Japan is the land where the sun rises before the Asian continent. The kanji that make up the name of Japan literally mean . It is pronounced as or in Japanese, and is often referred to by the epithet &quot;Land of the Rising Sun&quot;. The is the national flag of Japan. It symbolizes the rising sun and corresponds with the name of Japan. The earliest accounts of the rising sun flag is in the 7th century CE. In 607, an official correspondence that began with &quot;from the Emperor of the rising sun&quot; was sent to Chinese Emperor Yang of Sui. Thus the central importance of the sun in Japanese culture is represented in the national flag and other cultural goods. Similarly, the Japan Self-Defense Forces have flags that symbolize the sun.

The Sun also plays an important role in Japanese mythology and religion as the emperor is said to be the direct descendant of the Sun goddess Amaterasu, the personification of Japan. She is seen as the goddess of the Sun and the universe in Shinto religion. The emperor is &quot;the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people.&quot; is the national founder of Japan.

The national animals are the green pheasant, koi fish and the great purple emperor butterfly. The Imperial Seal of Japan is one of the national seals and a crest () used by the Emperor of Japan and members of the Imperial Family. The cherry blossom (Prunus serrulata) &amp; chrysanthemum morifolium are de facto national flowers of Japan. Japan&#x27;s de facto national dish is sushi, Japanese curry and ramen. The de facto national liquor is .

<text>The Tuscarora Trail is a hiking trail in the eastern United States, following the Appalachian Mountains through portions of Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. Its route is roughly parallel to, and to the west of, the Appalachian Trail.

== History ==

The Tuscarora Trail was originally conceived as an alternate route for the Appalachian Trail, which had been built in the 1920s-30s. By the 1960s, and before it was protected as a National Scenic Trail, a number of segments of the Appalachian Trail were being encroached upon and sometimes closed by private and commercial landowners. To ensure the trail&#x27;s continuity, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy began to consider alternate routes that could be used to bypass those threatened segments of the AT, with the goal of avoiding high-demand areas and maximizing public land usage.

The alternate route was originally built in the late 1960s as two separate trails: the 142-mile Big Blue Trail in Virginia and West Virginia, and the 110-mile Tuscarora Trail in Maryland and Pennsylvania, which were separated by an unofficial crossing of the Potomac River. By 1997, a crossing of the river via a road bridge had been approved, and the two trails were combined to form a continuous 252-mile route known as the Tuscarora Trail, because it largely traverses ridgetops above the Tuscarora Sandstone formation.

During the 1980s, several segments of the Tuscarora Trail in Pennsylvania had to be closed due to damage from gypsy moth infestations. After several years of rehabilitation, those segments were reopened. In the early 2000s, the Tuscarora Trail was named as a component of the Great Eastern Trail, which will extend for more than 2,000 miles from Florida to New York. A loop consisting of the Tuscarora Trail and the Appalachian Trail between their two junctions has been dubbed the Tuscalachian Loop, which is 435 miles in length.
== Route ==

The southern terminus of the Tuscarora Trail is at a junction with the Appalachian Trail in Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, on top of Blue Ridge. Traveling northbound, the Tuscarora Trail diverges from the AT to the northwest and traverses Massanutten Mountain and Great North Mountain through Virginia for about its first 106 miles. North of the town of Siler, the trail passes into West Virginia and for about the next 37 miles crosses that state&#x27;s Eastern Panhandle region. The trail crosses the Potomac River via the road bridge for US Route 522, and enters Maryland at Hancock. 

The trail then shares its route with the C&amp;O Canal Towpath for about eight miles, then heads north for about six additional miles in Maryland. It then crosses the Mason Dixon Line and spends the next 95 miles in Pennsylvania, traversing Tuscarora Mountain then Blue Mountain. The northern terminus of the Tuscarora Trail is at another junction with the Appalachian Trail, plus the Darlington Trail, on Blue Mountain about 10 miles north of Harrisburg. 

For planning purposes, the Tuscarora Trail is divided into 22 sections, ranging from 6 to 18 miles in length, with section names displayed prominently in guidebooks and on some trail signs.

<text>Francis Stewart Leland Lyons (11 November 1923 – 21 September 1983) was an Irish historian and academic who served as the 40th Provost of Trinity College Dublin from 1974 to 1981.
==Biography==
Leland Lyons was born in Derry, Northern Ireland, in 1923, the son of Northern Bank official Stewart Lyons and Florence May, née Leland. He was known as Le among his friends and family. The Lyons family were Irish Protestant, of Presbyterian and Church of Ireland background, descended from a cadet branch of the landed gentry Lyons family, formerly of Old Park, Belfast, After his birth, his family soon moved to Boyle, County Roscommon, Ireland. He was educated at Dover College in Kent and later attended The High School, Dublin. At Trinity College Dublin, he was elected a Scholar in Modern History and Political Science in 1943.

He was a lecturer in history at the University of Hull and then at Trinity College Dublin. He became the founding Professor of Modern History at the University of Kent in 1964, serving also as Master of Eliot College from 1969 to 1972.

Lyons became Provost of Trinity College Dublin in 1974, but, relinquished the post in 1981 to concentrate on writing. He won the Heinemann Prize in 1978 for his work in &quot;Charles Stewart Parnell&quot;. He wrote &quot;Culture and Anarchy in Ireland, 1890–1939&quot; which won the Christopher Ewart-Biggs Memorial Prize and the Wolfson Literary Prize for History in 1979. Lyons was also awarded honorary doctorates by five universities and had fellowships at the Royal Society of Literature and the British Academy. He was Visiting Professor at Princeton University.

His principal works include &quot;Ireland Since the Famine&quot;, the standard university textbook for Irish history from the mid-19th to late-20th century, which &quot;The Times&quot; called &quot;the definitive work of modern Irish history&quot; and a biography of Charles Stewart Parnell.

Lyons was critical of Cecil Woodham-Smith&#x27;s much-acclaimed history of the Great Irish Famine and has generally been considered among the &quot;revisionist&quot; historians who reconsidered the role of the British state in events like the Famine.

Lyons married his wife Jennifer Ann Stuart McAlister in 1954, and had two sons, one of whom, Nicholas, is a former Lord Mayor of London. Following a short illness, Lyons died in Dublin in 1983, just shy of his 60th birthday.

<text>Gravel () is a loose aggregation of rock fragments. Gravel occurs naturally on Earth as a result of sedimentary and erosive geological processes; it is also produced in large quantities commercially as crushed stone.

Gravel is classified by particle size range and includes size classes from granule- to boulder-sized fragments. In the Udden-Wentworth scale gravel is categorized into granular gravel () and pebble gravel (). ISO 14688 grades gravels as fine, medium, and coarse, with ranges for fine and for coarse. One cubic metre of gravel typically weighs about , or one cubic yard weighs about .

Gravel is an important commercial product, with a number of applications. Almost half of all gravel production is used as aggregate for concrete. Much of the rest is used for road construction, either in the road base or as the road surface (with or without asphalt or other binders.) Naturally occurring porous gravel deposits have a high hydraulic conductivity, making them important aquifers.

==Definition and properties==
Colloquially, the term gravel is often used to describe a mixture of different size pieces of stone mixed with sand and possibly some clay. The American construction industry distinguishes between gravel (a natural material) and crushed stone (produced artificially by mechanical crushing of rock.)

The technical definition of gravel varies by region and by area of application. Many geologists define gravel simply as loose rounded rock particles over in diameter, without specifying an upper size limit. Gravel is sometimes distinguished from rubble, which is loose rock particles in the same size range but angular in shape. The Udden-Wentworth scale, widely used by geologists in the US, defines granular gravel as particles with a size from and pebble gravel as particles with a size from . This corresponds to all particles with sizes between coarse sand and cobbles.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Soil Science Society of America define gravel as particles from in size, while the German scale (Atterburg) defines gravel as particles from in size. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers defines gravel as particles under in size that are retained by a number 4 mesh, which has a mesh spacing of . ISO 14688 for soil engineering grades gravels as fine, medium, and coarse with ranges 2 mm to 6.3 mm to 20 mm to 63 mm.

The bulk density of gravel varies from . Natural gravel has a high hydraulic conductivity, sometimes reaching above 1 cm/s.

==Origin==
Most gravel is derived from disintegration of bedrock as it weathers. Quartz is the most common mineral found in gravel, as it is hard, chemically inert, and lacks cleavage planes along which the rock easily splits. Most gravel particles consist of multiple mineral grains, since few rocks have mineral grains coarser than about in size. Exceptions include quartz veins, pegmatites, deep intrusions, and high-grade metamorphic rock. The rock fragments are rapidly rounded as they are transported by rivers, often within a few tens of kilometers of their source outcrops.

Gravel is deposited as gravel blankets or bars in stream channels; in alluvial fans; in near-shore marine settings, where the gravel is supplied by streams or erosion along the coast; and in the deltas of swift-flowing streams. The upper Mississippi embayment contains extensive chert gravels thought to have their origin less than from the periphery of the embayment.

It has been suggested that wind-formed (aeolian) gravel &quot;megaripples&quot; in Argentina have counterparts on the planet Mars.

==Production and uses==
Gravel is a major basic raw material in construction. Sand is not usually distinguished from gravel in official statistics, but crushed stone is treated as a separate category. In 2020, sand and gravel together made up 23% of all industrial mineral production in the U.S., with a total value of about $12.6 billion. Some 960 million tons of construction sand and gravel were produced. This greatly exceeds production of industrial sand and gravel (68 million tons), which is mostly sand rather than gravel.

It is estimated that almost half of construction sand and gravel is used as aggregate for concrete. Other important uses include in road construction, as road base or in blacktop; as construction fill; and in myriad minor uses.

Gravel is widely and plentifully distributed, mostly as river deposits, river flood plains, and glacial deposits, so that environmental considerations and quality dictate whether alternatives, such as crushed stone, are more economical. Crushed stone is already displacing natural gravel in the eastern United States, and recycled gravel is also becoming increasingly important.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;gravel&quot; comes from the Old French &quot;gravele&quot; or &quot;gravelle&quot;.

==Types==

Different varieties of gravel are distinguished by their composition, origin, and use cases. Types of gravel include:

;Bank gravel: naturally deposited gravel intermixed with sand or clay found in and next to rivers and streams. Also known as &quot;bank run&quot; or &quot;river run&quot;.
;Bench gravel: a bed of gravel located on the side of a valley above the present stream bottom, indicating the former location of the stream bed when it was at a higher level. The term is most commonly used in Alaska and the Yukon Territory.
;Crushed stone: rock crushed and graded by screens and then mixed to a blend of stones and fines. It is widely used as a surfacing for roads and driveways, sometimes with tar applied over it. Crushed stone may be made from granite, limestone, dolomite, and other rocks. Also known as &quot;crusher run&quot;, DGA (dense grade aggregate) QP (quarry process), and shoulder stone. Crushed stone is distinguished from gravel by the U.S. Geological Survey.
;Fine gravel: gravel consisting of particles with a diameter of 
;Lag gravel: a surface accumulation of coarse gravel produced by the removal of finer particles.
;Pay gravel: also known as &quot;pay dirt&quot;; a nickname for gravel with a high concentration of gold and other precious metals. The metals are recovered through gold panning.
;Pea gravel: also known as &quot;pea shingle&quot; is clean gravel similar in size to garden peas. Used for concrete surfaces, walkways, driveways and as a substrate in home aquariums.
;Piedmont gravel: a coarse gravel carried down from high places by mountain streams and deposited on relatively flat ground, where the water runs more slowly.
;Plateau gravel: a layer of gravel on a plateau or other region above the height at which stream-terrace gravel is usually found.
;Shingle: Coarse, loose, well-rounded, waterworn, specifically alluvial and beach, sediment that is largely composed of smooth and spheroidal or flattened pebbles, cobbles, and sometimes small boulders, generally measuring in diameter.

==Relationship to plant life==
In locales where gravelly soil is predominant, plant life is generally more sparse. This is due to the inferior ability of gravels to retain moisture, as well as the corresponding paucity of mineral nutrients, since finer soils that contain such minerals are present in smaller amounts.

==In the geologic record==
Sediments containing over 30% gravel that become lithified into solid rock are termed conglomerate. Conglomerates are widely distributed in sedimentary rock of all ages, but usually as a minor component, making up less than 1% of all sedimentary rock. Alluvial fans likely contain the largest accumulations of gravel in the geologic record. These include conglomerates of the Triassic basins of eastern North America and the New Red Sandstone of south Devon.

<text>Public holidays in Australia refer to the holidays recognised in law in Australia. Although they are declared on a state and territory basis, they comprise a mixture of nationally celebrated days and holidays exclusive to the individual jurisdictions.

Public holidays function as non-working days, with workers generally receiving full paid leave independently of annual leave. Those working on public holidays receive additional penalty rates of pay. Where they fall on a weekend, public holidays are generally declared &quot;in lieu&quot; for the following Monday.

Statutory holidays in Australia are based on varying religious, cultural and civic observations. Christian celebrations, namely Christmas and Easter, are some of the most significant ones observed. A Labour Day is observed in each state and territory, although it is varied in date. There are two significant national days, Australia Day (26 January) and Anzac Day (25 April), which are nationwide public holidays.

When a public holiday occurs on a Friday or Monday, the three-day period is colloquially known as a &quot;long weekend&quot;.

==Nature of public holidays==
Traditionally, Australians in employment (whether in the public or private sector) have had the right to take a public holiday off work with regular pay. In recent years this tradition has changed somewhat. For example, businesses that normally open on a public holiday may request employees to work on that day. Employers can deny employees a holiday only on reasonable business grounds.

From 2006, WorkChoices eliminated the entitlement to penalty rates in many workplaces; however since the implementation of the Fair Work Act 2009 and the modern awards in 2010, most public-holiday penalty rates have increased dramatically. employees generally receive pay at a penalty rate—usually 2.5 times (known as &quot;double time and a half&quot;) the base rate of pay—when they work on a public holiday.

Besides designating days as public holidays, Australian authorities also designate some of these days as restricted trading days.

Public holidays are determined by a combination of:
* statutes, with specific gazetting of public holidays 
* industrial awards and agreements

If a standard public holiday falls on a weekend, a substitute public holiday will sometimes be observed on the first non-weekend day (usually Monday) after the weekend, whether by virtue of the public holiday legislation or by &quot;ad hoc&quot; proclamation. Workers required to work on a public holiday or substituted public holiday will usually be entitled to remuneration at a holiday penalty rate.

All states have their own public holidays in addition to national public holidays, and in some states certain public holidays, such as Melbourne Cup Day, are in force in only part of a state.

Alcohol licences in several states prevent sale of alcohol on certain public holidays, such as Good Friday.

==Public holidays==
; Legend:
: B City of Brisbane only. The Royal National Agricultural (RNA) Show Day (Brisbane only) is held on the Wednesday during the RNA Show period. The RNA Show commences on the first Friday in August, unless the first Friday is prior to 5 August, then it commences on the second Friday of August. Other Queensland show holidays: Show holiday dates | Public, school and show holidays
: C = Conditional: Public Service employees or where defined in Employment Agreement/Award

: H = Hobart area only
: NH = Not Hobart area
: P Part day, from 7 pm to midnight (6 pm to midnight for QLD)
: † Often substituted with the Geelong Cup for Geelong residents. For regional Victoria other local cup days are sometimes substituted. 
: * Depends on occupation, generally from 6 pm to midnight

===Substitute holidays for holidays falling on a weekend===
When a public holiday falls on a weekend, the following work day may be considered a public holiday depending on the state/territory and the holiday in question.
Holidays that always fall on a particular day of the week are not listed in this table. Prior to 2008, Victorian law only specified substitute holidays for New Year and Boxing Day, and only if they fell on a Sunday. From 2008, Victorian law specifies the substitute holidays in the table above.

Since Easter Monday can occur as late as 26 April it is possible for the Easter Monday holiday to coincide with Anzac Day, as occurred in 2011. State Acts do not give a provision to separate the days when this occurs, so no additional public holiday is given by law. However an extra day is usually proclaimed by the minister, so as to have a steady number of public holidays each year. In the year 2038, Anzac Day will coincide with Easter Sunday.

===Australia Day===
Nationally, Australia Day was originally celebrated on 30 July 1915.

Recorded celebrations of the 26 January date back to 1808 in Australia, and in 1818, Governor Lachlan Macquarie held the first official celebration of Australia Day. 26 January was chosen because it is the day of the establishment of the first British settlement at Port Jackson by Captain Arthur Phillip in 1788. It was made a public holiday in New South Wales in 1836, and Victoria adopted the day as a public holiday in 1931. The 26 January commenced to be recognised by all states and territories as Australia Day in 1935 (pre 150th Anniversary) and all States except SA observed it from the 1888 centenary.

Australia Day has been celebrated as a national public holiday on 26 January since 1994.

Since 1960, the winner of the Australian of the Year award is announced by the Prime Minister on the eve of Australia Day (25 Jan).

===Labour Day===
Labour Day commemorates the achievements of the Australian labour movement. The celebration of Labour Day has its origins in the eight-hour day movement, which advocated eight hours for work, eight hours for recreation, and eight hours for rest. On 21 April 1856 Stonemasons and building workers on building sites around Melbourne, Australia, stopped work and marched from the University of Melbourne to Parliament House to achieve an eight-hour day. Their direct action protest was a success, and they are noted as the first organised workers in the world to achieve an eight-hour day with no loss of pay, which subsequently inspired the celebration of Labour Day and May Day. In Tasmania the public holiday is called Eight Hours Day and in the Northern Territory it is called May Day.

The Labour Day public holiday varies considerably between the various states and territories. It is the first Monday in October in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales and South Australia. In Western Australia, it is the first Monday in March. In both Victoria and Tasmania, it is the second Monday in March. In the Northern Territory, and in Queensland it is the first Monday in May. More than 80 countries celebrate Labor Day. Labor Day is a long weekend.

===Easter===
The days of Easter vary each year depending on the day determined by the Western Christian calendar. Until 1994 Easter Tuesday was a Bank Holiday in Victoria (it retains this status partially in Tasmania). The day after Good Friday and before Easter Sunday is traditionally known as Holy Saturday. However, the states where that day is a public holiday use different terminology – it is officially gazetted as &quot;Easter Saturday&quot; in the ACT, New South Wales, the Northern Territory and South Australia, as &quot;the day after Good Friday&quot; in Queensland, and as &quot;Saturday before Easter Sunday&quot; in Victoria.

===ANZAC Day===
ANZAC Day is a day on which the country remembers those citizens who fell fighting or who served the country in wars. ANZAC Day is commemorated on 25 April every year. The tradition began to remember the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) soldiers who landed at Gallipoli in Turkey during World War I.

ANZAC Day commemoration features marches by veterans and by solemn &quot;Dawn Services&quot;, a tradition started in Albany, Western Australia on 25 April 1923 and now held at war memorials around the country, accompanied by thoughts of those lost at war to the ceremonial sounds of The Last Post on the bugle. The fourth stanza of Laurence Binyon&#x27;s poem (known as the &quot;Ode of Remembrance&quot;) is often recited.

===King&#x27;s Birthday===
In all states and territories except Queensland and Western Australia, the King&#x27;s Birthday is observed on the second Monday in June. Because Western Australia celebrates Western Australia Day (formerly Foundation Day) on the first Monday in June, the Governor of Western Australia proclaims the day on which the state will observe the King&#x27;s Birthday, based on school terms and the Perth Royal Show. There is no firm rule to determine this date before it is proclaimed, though it is typically the last Monday of September or the first Monday of October: in 2011 the King&#x27;s Birthday holiday in Western Australia was moved from Monday, 3 October 2011 to Friday, 28 October 2011 to coincide with the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), which was held in Perth. In parts of the Pilbara, it is celebrated on a different date from the rest of Western Australia, and it may even be celebrated on different dates in different parts of the Pilbara. In Queensland, it is celebrated on the 1st Monday in October.

The day has been celebrated since 1788, when Governor Arthur Phillip declared a holiday to mark the birthday of King George III. Until 1936 it was held on the actual birthday of the Monarch, but after the death of King George V, it was decided to keep the date at mid-year.

On that day the &quot;King&#x27;s Birthday honours list&quot; is released naming new members of the Order of Australia and other Australian honours. This occurs on the date observed in the Eastern States, not the date observed in Western Australia.

The King&#x27;s Birthday weekend and Empire Day, 24 May, were long the traditional times for public fireworks displays in Australia. Although they still occur, the tradition has recently been overshadowed by larger New Year&#x27;s Eve fireworks, as the sale of fireworks to the public was banned by the states in the 1980s, and in the ACT as of 24 August 2009. In the Northern Territory fireworks remain available to the public on 1 July for the celebration of Territory Day.

===Christmas Day===
Christmas is observed on 25 December each year to commemorate the birth of Jesus. In Australia, it was introduced with British settlement in 1788 as the cultural norms were transferred to the new colonies.

===Boxing Day===
Boxing Day is on the day after Christmas, i.e. 26 December each year, except in South Australia where it is replaced by Proclamation Day.

Boxing Day is noted for the start of the post-Christmas sale season. The day has also become a significant sporting day. Melbourne hosts the Boxing Day Test match; the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race also starts on this day.

==Other holidays==
*Every public holiday and Sunday is a bank holiday in South Australia.
*Proclamation Day is in December in South Australia only.
*Canberra Day is held on the 2nd Monday in March in the ACT. Prior to 2008, this holiday was celebrated on the 3rd Monday of March.
*Melbourne Cup Day is held on the first Tuesday of November—the day of the Melbourne Cup. It was originally observed only in the Melbourne metropolitan area. From 2007 to 2009 in ACT, Melbourne Cup day was also a holiday called &quot;Family and Community Day&quot;. The holiday continued from 2010 to 2017 but no longer coincided with Melbourne Cup day. In Victoria, the Public Holidays Act 1993 (Vic) was amended from 24 September 2008 and made the Melbourne Cup Day holiday applicable in all parts of the state (unless another day is observed in substitute). It also made the holiday applicable to employees covered by federal awards.
*Recreation Day is the first Monday of November, and celebrated in Northern Tasmania where Regatta Day is not a holiday.
* Regatta Day is the second Monday in February, and is celebrated in Southern Tasmania. Previously it was held on the second Tuesday in February.
*Geelong Cup Day is held on the fourth Wednesday of October in the city of Geelong, Victoria
*Queensland Day is celebrated on 6 June each year, but not with a public holiday.
*Adelaide Cup Day is held on the second Monday in March in South Australia (held in May before 2006)
*Western Australia Day in Western Australia on the first Monday in June.
*Picnic Day in the Northern Territory in August, and also May Day
*Tasmania has Easter Tuesday as a bank holiday (for bank and government employees only).
*New South Wales has the first Monday in August as a bank holiday (for bank employees only).
*Many cities and towns observe local public holidays for their local Agricultural Show. For example:
**Darwin Show Day in Darwin area in late July
**Royal Queensland Show Day in Brisbane area in August
**Gold Coast Show in Gold Coast area in October
**Territory Day celebrated in the Northern Territory on 1 July while not a designated public holiday, it remains the only Australian public celebration where the public may purchase fireworks for home detonation
*&quot;National Day of Mourning for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II&quot; was a &quot;one off&quot; national public holiday declared by the Prime Minister for 22 September 2022 to allow people to pay their respects for the death of Queen Elizabeth II, the longest-reigning Australian monarch.

==Public holidays by state==

===Queensland===
The days are set in the &quot;Holidays Act 1983&quot;. Most public holidays include a second public holiday on a week-day if they happen to fall on Saturday or Sunday. In which case, both days are public holidays.

*New Year&#x27;s Day: 1 January, or if 1 January is a Saturday or Sunday, the following Monday.
*Australia Day: 26 January, or if 26 January is a Saturday or Sunday, the following Monday.
*Good Friday: on the date it is publicly observed, always a Friday.
*The day after Good Friday: Always a Saturday, one day after Good Friday.
*Easter Monday: The next Monday after Good Friday.
*Anzac Day: 25 April, or if 25 April is a Sunday, 26 April.
*Labour Day (&quot;May Day&quot;): 1st Monday in May.
*King&#x27;s/Queen&#x27;s Birthday: 1st Monday in October. (legislated as the &quot;Birthday of the Sovereign&quot;)
*Christmas Day: 25 December.
*Boxing Day: 26 December.

If Christmas Day (25 December) is a Saturday or Sunday, then 27 December is also a public holiday.
If Boxing day (26 December) is a Saturday or Sunday, then 28 December is also a public holiday.

Because of the variable days of Easter, Anzac day could fall on an Easter holiday. When Anzac day falls on a Saturday, there is no week day public holiday. In such situations it is generally expected that the minister will proclaim extra public holidays on week-days to ensure every year has the same number of public holidays on week-days.

The minister of the state may proclaim and adjustments or additions, such as the date of the Brisbane Ekka Show day holiday. This day has historically always been proclaimed for the second Wednesday in August, except if there are five Wednesdays in August, in which case it is the third Wednesday in August.

===New South Wales===
Public holidays generally follow the national pattern, but special cases are resolved by the State Government and advised by proclamation. Details of future holidays can be found on the NSW Industrial Relations website. Public holidays are regulated by the New South Wales &quot;Public Holidays Act 2010 No 115&quot;, which supersedes the &quot;Banks and Bank Holidays Act 1912 No 43&quot;.

The first Monday in August is a Bank Holiday, during which banks and financial institutions are closed.

===Australian Capital Territory and Jervis Bay Territory===
Most New South Wales public holidays are public holidays in the Australian Capital Territory, with the addition of Canberra Day and Reconciliation Day, which holiday falls on the Monday closest to 27 May.

===South Australia===
Public holidays in South Australia are set out in the &quot;Public Holidays Act 2023&quot;, while additional holidays may be proclaimed in all or part of the state by the Governor.

===Victoria===
Public holidays in Victoria are regulated by the Victorian &quot;Public Holidays Act&quot; 1993.

Victorian employees fall under the Workchoices system either as coming within the Commonwealth constitutional power (called &quot;constitutional corporation employees&quot;) or because of Victoria&#x27;s referral of its legislative powers to the Commonwealth for particular workplace relations matters.

Employee entitlements to public holidays and additional pay depend on whether they are covered by a federal award or agreement.

Employees not covered by a federal award or agreement are entitled to public holidays under the Victorian &quot;Public Holidays Act&quot; 1993. Also, all permanent employees not covered by a federal award or agreement who would normally work on a public holiday (or a substitute public holiday) are entitled to the holiday without loss of pay. Their employers are not required to provide additional payment if they work on a public holiday, but this does not exclude the possibility of employees and employers negotiating for additional pay.

Employees who are covered by a federal award or agreement are entitled to public holidays as provided by the relevant federal award or agreement and the &quot;Public Holidays Act&quot; 1993. Many federal awards and agreements also provide for additional penalty rates for work performed on a public holiday.

Restricted shop trading laws apply to Good Friday, Christmas Day and before 1 pm on Anzac Day. On these days only exempted businesses are permitted to open for trading. All public holidays and substitute public holidays are bank holidays.

In August 2015, the day before the AFL Grand Final, as well as Easter Sunday, were gazetted as Public Holidays within Victoria. This date of the holiday is as gazetted by the Victorian Government and cannot be accurately predicted. In 2019, the Victorian Parliament legislated the AFL Grand Final public holiday by amending the &quot;Public Holidays Act 1993 (Vic)&quot;.

The Victorian public holidays are as follows:

* Melbourne Cup Day is observed in most of the state, but various cup days and show days in the state&#x27;s west are locally substituted. See the list at Non-Metropolitan Public Holiday Dates (Victoria Online).

Melbourne Show Day used to be observed on the Thursday in the last full week of September as a half-day public holiday—later changing to full day—until 1994 (abolished by the state government). Easter Tuesday was observed as a Bank Holiday in Victoria until 1994 (also abolished by the state government).

===Western Australia===
* *If a Public Holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the following Monday is also observed as a Public Holiday
* #The King&#x27;s Birthday may be held on a different date in regional communities

==Penalty rates==
Penalty rates are the rates of pay which an employee is paid higher than their standard base rate for working at times or on days, such as public holidays, which are outside the normal working week. They were introduced in 1947 for workers working on the Sabbath, as most workers were Christian, while today, these rates of pay are set by the Fair Work Commission.

<doc id="167131" wikidata="Q15984" url="?curid=167131" title="Leer, Lower Saxony">
<text>Leer () is a town in the district of Leer, in the northwestern part of Lower Saxony, Germany. It is situated on the river Leda, a tributary of the river Ems, near the border with the Netherlands. With 34,958 inhabitants (2021), it is the third-largest city in East Frisia after Emden and Aurich.

It has a railway and autobahn connection to Groningen, Netherlands, Emden, Bremen and the South (Rheine and the Ruhr industrial region).

==Geography==
Leer had been a settlement long before it was first mentioned in written documents. Originally, the city was situated at a meander near the mouth of the river Leda into the Ems, which is still the center of the town today. Even though Leer is some away from the coast, it can be reached by large ships via the Ems.
Leer lies close to the Dutch border; the district of Leer shares a border with the Dutch province of Groningen. The island and nature reserve of Bingumer Sand lies within the district.

==History==
There are many traces of early settlements in the area, including crude flint tools that are dated back to roughly 3200 BC.

In 791 AD Saint Ludger built the first chapel in East Frisia at the western edge of the settlement Leer, then still named &quot;Hleri&quot; after &quot;feetlot&quot;, &quot;willow&quot;. This chapel is mentioned for the first time in a written document from 850 AD.

During the 14th and 15th centuries, Leer was hometown of the Ukena family, which was one most influential East-Frisian chieftain families of that time. The town profited from the trade with the Hanse, and a fortress Leerort was built.

In 1508, Count Edzard obtained the official right to host a market, which started the tradition of the &quot;Gallimarkt,&quot; which is now an annual fair. In 1744 East Frisia fell to Prussia, then ruled by Frederick the Great. Town privileges were awarded in 1823 by George IV, King of Hanover.

In 1854 Leer became connected to the &quot;Hannoversche Westbahn&quot; railway, which at that time connected Emden and Rheine in the Ruhr area. In 1856, the Westbahn was connected to the central German railway network.

Unlike Emden, Leer only suffered little damage by Allied bombing in World War II. The city was occupied by Canadian troops on 28 April 1945.

On 1 October 1955, Leer received the status of an independent city.

==Politics==
Since 1964 the city&#x27;s government has been led by the Social-Democratic Party SPD. The major opposition parties are the Christian Democratic Union Party CDU, the Green Party and the &quot;Allgemeine Wählergemeinschaft&quot; (AWG), an independent local party. The mayor of Leer is Claus-Peter Horst, elected in 2021.

The town council consists of (elections of 2016):

* SPD: 36.7% / 14 seats
* CDU: 27.9% / 11 seats
* AWG: 10.2% / 4 seats
* Grüne: 13.9% / 5 seats
* FDP: 3.0% / 1 seat
* The Left: 3.1% / 1 seat
*CDL: 3.5% / 1 seat
*BfL 1.3%: / 1 seat
*Haase 0.5%: / 0 seat

=== Mayors ===
==Notable buildings==
* Harderwykenburg
* Haneburg
* Evenburg
* Philippsburg (Castle)
* Telecommunication tower &quot;Leer-Nüttermoor&quot; (Height:160 meters)


==Religion==
Leer is a traditional Protestant city and home to both the Lutheran and Reformed churches. The German Reformed Church has its head office in Leer. Furthermore, Leer offers an unusually large variety of smaller religious communities, especially Baptists, Mennonites, Methodists, Adventists and Mormons. Even though Eastern Frisia is a mainly a Protestant region, there is a small Roman Catholic community in Leer.

==Economics and infrastructure==
Two autobahns (freeways) cross north of Leer, the A 28 (Leer – Bremen) and the A 31 (Emden – Oberhausen, Ruhr Area). The city itself has three junctions to the autobahns. Leer railway station is a relay station between Groningen and Bremen in the west–east direction and the South and Emden harbour (with a large VW factory and shipping facilities) in the north. The airfield Leer-Papenburg north of the city offers limited passenger flights to nearby airfields, most notably the East Frisian Islands. The closest international airport is Bremen International Airport.

Leer is home to many German shipping companies – about 20 per cent of the German merchant fleet are registered in Leer. The Bünting group Home is based in Leer and is one of the city&#x27;s main employers. Although Bünting owns several German supermarket chains, the company is best known for their tea, which is available all over Germany.

Each year in autumn the Gallimarkt is held. Traditionally a cattle-market, the Gallimarkt is now one of the largest fairs in Northwest Germany.

==Education==
In Leer there are seven primary schools and numerous secondary schools. The two gymnasiums, Telletta-Gross-Gymnasium and Ubbo-Emmius-Gymnasium, educate more than 1,500 pupils each and are two of the largest grammar schools in Lower Saxony. The Navigation School is now a faculty of the Hochschule Emden – Leer (University of applied science). The town also offers education at two vocational schools.

<text>A brain transplant or whole-body transplant is a procedure in which the brain of one organism is transplanted into the body of another organism. It is a procedure distinct from head transplantation, which involves transferring the entire head to a new body, as opposed to the brain only. Theoretically, a person with complete organ failure could be given a new and functional body while keeping their own personality, memories, and consciousness through such a procedure. Neurosurgeon Robert J. White has grafted the head of a monkey onto the headless body of another monkey. EEG readings showed the brain was later functioning normally. Initially, it was thought to prove that the brain was an immunologically privileged organ, as the host&#x27;s immune system did not attack it at first, but immunorejection caused the monkey to die after nine days. Brain transplants and similar concepts have also been explored in various forms of science fiction.

== Existing challenges ==
One of the most significant barriers to the procedure is the inability of nerve tissue to heal properly; scarred nerve tissue does not transmit signals well, which is why spinal cord injuries devastate muscle function and sensation.

Alternatively, a brain–computer interface can be used connecting the subject to their own body. A study using a monkey as a subject shows that it is possible to directly use commands from the brain, bypass the spinal cord and enable hand function. An advantage is that this interface can be adjusted after the surgical interventions are done where nerves can not be reconnected without surgery.

Also, for the procedure to be practical, the age of the donated body must be close to that of the recipient brain: an adult brain cannot fit into a skull that has not reached its full growth, which occurs at age 9–12 years.

When organs are transplanted, aggressive transplant rejection by the host&#x27;s immune system can occur. Because immune cells of the CNS contribute to the maintenance of neurogenesis and spatial learning abilities in adulthood, the brain has been hypothesized to be an immunologically privileged (unrejectable) organ. However, immunorejection of a functional transplanted brain has been reported in monkeys.

== Partial brain transplant ==
In 1982, Dr. Dorothy T. Krieger, chief of endocrinology at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City, achieved success with a partial brain transplant in mice.

In 1998, a team of surgeons from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center attempted to transplant a group of brain cells to Alma Cerasini, who had suffered a severe stroke that caused the loss of mobility in her right limbs as well as had limited speech. The team hoped that the cells would correct the listed damage. She died later on.

== In science fiction ==
The whole-body transplant is just one of several means of putting a consciousness into a new body that have been explored in science fiction.

In the film &quot;Get Out&quot; (2017), written and directed by Jordan Peele, a white woman (Allison Williams) lures her black boyfriend (Daniel Kaluuya) to her family&#x27;s estate to be auctioned off for a brain transplant procedure that enables older white people to obtain pseudo-immortality in a black person&#x27;s body.

In the film &quot;Pichaikkaran 2&quot; (2023), written and directed by Vijay Antony, a CEO and his accomplice transplanted a beggar&#x27;s brain to an ultra-rich man to rob him of his wealth.

In Maxwell Atoms&#x27; Cartoon Network series &quot;Evil Con Carne&quot; (2003–2004), Hector Con Carne was reduced to a brain and a stomach and both of them were put in jars attached to the body of a Russian circus bear. Hector&#x27;s brain is the main character of the cartoon.

Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; &quot;The Mastermind of Mars&quot; involves a surgeon who performs brain transplants as his main operation, as well as a man from Earth—the narrator and main character—who is also trained to perform brain transplants.

In Neil R. Jones&#x27; &quot;Professeur Jameson&quot; stories (1931), the main character is the last earthman, whose brain is saved by some alien cyborgs called the Zoromes, and is inserted into a robotic body, making him immortal.

Robert Heinlein&#x27;s 1970 science fiction novel, &quot;I Will Fear No Evil&quot;, features a main character named Johann Sebastian Bach Smith whose entire brain is transplanted into his deceased secretary&#x27;s skull.

In the horror film &quot;The Skeleton Key&quot;, the protagonist, Caroline, discovers that the old couple she is looking after are poor Voodoo witch doctors who stole the bodies of two young, privileged children in their care using a ritual which allows a soul to swap bodies. Unfortunately the evil old couple also trick Caroline and their lawyer into the same procedure, and both end up stuck in old dying bodies unable to speak while the witch doctors walk off with their young bodies.

In Anne Rice&#x27;s &quot;The Tale of the Body Thief&quot;, the vampire Lestat discovers a man, Raglan James, who can will himself into another person&#x27;s body. Lestat demands that the procedure be used on him to allow him to be human once again, but soon finds that he has made an error and is forced to recapture James in his vampiric form so he can take his body back.

In &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot; (part 3: &quot;Stardust Crusaders&quot;), Dio Brando, a vampire who was the main antagonist in the first part of JJBA, comes back from his 100-year sleep with his new body of Jonathan Joestar. He was only left with his head, so he took the body of Jonathan from the neck down.

In Matthew Broughton&#x27;s BBC radio drama thriller &quot;Tracks&quot; (series 1 – &quot;Origins&quot;), the protagonist Helen Ash discovers that many of the victims in a plane crash which she witnessed have vital organs missing or deficient, including the brain. She goes on to uncover her estranged father&#x27;s murky and secretive past and her own connection.

In the horror game &quot;SOMA&quot;, the protagonist&#x27;s brain is scanned in extreme detail for medical purposes; over a century later, the data from the scan are transferred into an artificial body, effectively performing a consciousness transplant. Later in the story, the protagonist comes across many other cases of a similar event, with far worse body choices for the transplanted consciousnesses. The Protagonist&#x27;s goal is to ensure that an artificial world called the &quot;ARK&quot; is as safe as possible. The ARK is a supercomputer, a server hosting a virtual world, which can be explored with one&#x27;s consciousness alone. Many people, including the protagonist, have had their brains scanned and consciousnesses &quot;transplanted&quot; into the computer, so that they may live on, since Earth is no longer habitable in SOMA&#x27;s story.

Similar in many ways to this is the idea of mind uploading, promoted by Marvin Minsky and others with a mechanistic view of natural intelligence and an optimistic outlook regarding artificial intelligence. It is also a goal of Raëlism, a small cult based in Florida, France, and Quebec. While the ultimate goal of transplanting is transfer of the brain to a new body optimized for it by genetics, proteomics, and/or other medical procedures, in uploading the brain itself moves nowhere and may even be physically destroyed or discarded; the goal is rather to duplicate the information patterns contained within the brain.

Another similar literary theme, though different from either procedure described above, is the transplanting of a human brain into an artificial, usually robotic, body. Examples of this include: &quot;Caprica&quot;; &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;; &quot;RoboCop&quot;; the DC Comics superhero Robotman; the Cybermen from the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television series; the cymeks in the &quot;Legends of Dune&quot; series; Dr. Light and Dr. Wily in the Mega Man Series, in which their consciousnesses are seen living on a century after through program data in the Mega Man X series; as full-body cyborgs in many manga or works in the cyberpunk genre. In one episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Spock&#x27;s Brain is stolen and installed in a large computer-like structure; and in &quot;I, Mudd&quot; Uhura is offered immortality in an android body. The novel &quot;Harvest of Stars&quot; by Poul Anderson features many central characters who undergo such transplants, and deals with the difficult decisions facing a human contemplating such a procedure. In the &quot;&quot;Star Wars&quot; expanded universe&quot; the shadow droids were created by taking the brains of grievously wounded TIE fighter pilot aces. After surgically transplanting them into a protective cocoon filled with nutrient fluids, they were surgically connected to cybernetic hardware that gave them external sensors, flight control, and tactical computers that augmented their reflexes beyond the biological limit, at the cost of their humanity. Emperor Palpatine also imbued them with the dark side giving them a sixth sense, and making them into extensions of his own will.

<doc id="167138" wikidata="Q472940" url="?curid=167138" title="Bolshevism">
<text>Bolshevism (derived from Bolshevik) is a revolutionary socialist current of Soviet Leninist and later Marxist–Leninist political thought and political regime associated with the formation of a rigidly centralized, cohesive and disciplined party of social revolution, focused on overthrowing the existing capitalist state system, seizing power and establishing the &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot;. 

Bolshevism originated at the beginning of the 20th century in Russia and was associated with the activities of the Bolshevik faction within the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party led by Vladimir Lenin, Bolshevism&#x27;s main theorist. Other theoreticians included Joseph Stalin, Leon Trotsky, Nikolai Bukharin and Yevgeni Preobrazhensky. While Bolshevism was based on Marxist philosophy, it also absorbed elements of the ideology and practice of the socialist revolutionaries of the second half of the 19th century (Sergey Nechaev, Pyotr Tkachev, Nikolay Chernyshevsky) and was influenced by Russian agrarian socialist movements like the Narodniks. 

In October 1917, the Bolshevik Party won a majority in the revolutionary workers&#x27; councils (soviets) which had been formed throughout Russia following the February Revolution. It subsequently organized the October Revolution, which overthrew the Provisional Government and replaced it with a state power under the control of the soviets, led by the Bolsheviks along with other left-wing socialists.

Some researchers attribute to Bolshevik theory the program of Joseph Stalin, who headed the All–Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and at the same time possessed full state power in the Soviet Union. However, others (both Stalin&#x27;s contemporaries and later) do not confuse &quot;Bolshevism&quot; and &quot;Stalinism&quot; proper, considering them to be multidirectional (revolutionary and thermidorian) phenomena.

The expression &quot;Bolshevism&quot;, and later &quot;Communism&quot;, has become established in Western historiography in the sense of a certain set of features of Soviet power in a certain political period. At present, the name &quot;Bolsheviks&quot; is actively used by various groups of Marxist–Leninists and Trotskyists.

==Concepts==

===Dictatorship of the proletariat===

Lenin, according to his interpretation of Marx&#x27;s theory of the state, believed democracy to be unattainable anywhere in the world before the proletariat seized power. According to Marxist theory, the state is a vehicle for oppression and is headed by a ruling class, an &quot;organ of class rule&quot;. He believed that during his lifetime, the only viable solution was dictatorship since the war was heading into a final conflict between the &quot;progressive forces of socialism and the degenerate forces of capitalism&quot;. The Russian Revolution of 1917 was already a failure according to its original aim, which was to act as an inspiration for a world revolution. As a result, the initial anti-statist posture and the active campaigning for direct democracy was replaced with dictatorship. From the perspective of the Bolsheviks, the rationale for this change was Russia&#x27;s lack of development, its status as the sole socialist state in the world, its encirclement by imperialist powers, and its internal encirclement by the peasantry.

Marx, similar to Lenin, considered it fundamentally irrelevant whether a bourgeois state was ruled according to a republican, parliamentarian, or constitutionally monarchic political system because this did not change the mode of production itself. These systems, regardless of whether they are ruled by an oligarchy or by mass participation, were ultimately all a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie by definition because the bourgeoisie, by the very condition of their class and its interests, would promote and implement policies in their class interests and thus in defense of capitalism. There was a difference, though; Lenin, after the failures of the world revolutions, argued that this did not necessarily have to change under the dictatorship of the proletariat. The reasoning came from wholly practical considerations: the majority of the country&#x27;s inhabitants were not communists and the party could not introduce parliamentary democracy since that was inconsistent with their ideology and would lead to the party losing power. He therefore concluded that &quot;[t]he form of government has absolutely nothing to do with&quot; the nature of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Bukharin and Trotsky agreed with Lenin, both claiming that the revolution had only destroyed the old, but failing completely in creating anything sort of new. Lenin had now concluded that the dictatorship of the proletariat would not alter the relationship of power between persons, but rather &quot;transform their productive relations so that, in the long run, the realm of necessity could be overcome and, with that, genuine social freedom realised&quot;.

It was in the period of 1920–1921 that Soviet leaders and ideologists began differentiating between socialism and communism; hitherto the two terms had been used to describe similar conditions. From then, the two terms developed separate meanings. According to Soviet ideology, Russia was in the transition from capitalism to socialism (referred to interchangeably under Lenin as the dictatorship of the proletariat), socialism being the intermediate stage to communism, with the latter being the final stage which follows after socialism. By now, the party leaders believed that universal mass participation and true democracy could only take form in the last stage, if only because of Russia&#x27;s current conditions at the time.

In early Bolshevik discourse, the term &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; was of little significance; the few times it was mentioned, it was likened to the form of government which had existed in the Paris Commune. With the ensuing Russian Civil War and the social and material devastation that followed, however, its meaning was transformed from communal democracy to disciplined totalitarian rule. By now, Lenin had concluded that only a proletarian regime as oppressive as its opponents could survive in this world. The powers previously bestowed upon the soviets were now given to the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars; the central government was in turn to be governed by &quot;an army of steeled revolutionary Communists [by Communists he referred to the Party]&quot;. In a letter to Gavril Myasnikov, Lenin in late 1920 explained his new reinterpretation of the term &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot;;

Dictatorship means nothing more nor less than authority untrammelled by any laws, absolutely unrestricted by any rules whatever, and based directly on force. The term &#x27;dictatorship&#x27; &quot;has no other meaning but this&quot;.

Lenin justified these policies by claiming that all states were class states by nature, and that these states were maintained through class struggle. This meant that the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviet Union could only be &quot;won and maintained by the use of violence against the bourgeoisie&quot;. The main problem with this analysis is that the Party came to view anyone opposing or holding alternate views of the party as bourgeoisie. The worst enemy remained the moderates, however, which were &quot;objectively&quot; considered to be &quot;the real agents of the bourgeoisie in the working class movement, the labour lieutenants of the capitalist class&quot;.

Consequently, &quot;bourgeoisie&quot; became synonymous with &quot;opponent&quot; and with people who disagreed with the party in general. These oppressive measures led to another reinterpretation of the dictatorship of the proletariat and socialism in general; it was now defined as a purely economic system. Slogans and theoretical works about democratic mass participation and collective decision-making were now replaced with texts which supported authoritarian management. Considering the situation, the party believed it had to use the same powers as the bourgeoisie to transform Russia, for there was no other alternative. Lenin began arguing that the proletariat, similar to the bourgeoisie, did not have a single preference for a form of government, and because of that dictatorship was acceptable to both the party and the proletariat. In a meeting with party officials, Lenin stated—in line with his economist view of socialism—that &quot;[i]ndustry is indispensable, democracy is not&quot;, further arguing that &quot;we do not promise any democracy or any freedom&quot;.

===Anti-imperialism===

The Marxist theory on imperialism was conceived by Lenin in his book, &quot;&quot; (published in 1917). It was written in response to the theoretical crisis within Marxist thought, which occurred due to capitalism&#x27;s recovery in the 19th century. According to Lenin, imperialism was a specific stage of development of capitalism; a stage he referred to as state monopoly capitalism. The Marxist movement was split on how to solve capitalism&#x27;s resurgence and revitalisation after the great depression of the late-19th century. Eduard Bernstein, from the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SDP), considered capitalism&#x27; revitalisation as proof that capitalism was evolving into a more humane system, further adding that the basic aims of socialists were not to overthrow the state, but rather to take power through elections. On the other hand, Karl Kautsky, from the SDP, held a highly dogmatic view, claiming that there was no crisis within Marxist theory. Both of them, however, denied or belittled the role of class contradictions in society after the crisis. In contrast, Lenin believed that capitalism&#x27; resurgence was the beginning of a new phase of capitalism; this stage being created because of a strengthening of class contradiction, not because of its reduction.

Lenin did not know when the imperialist stage of capitalism began, and claimed it would be foolish to look for a specific year, however he did assert it began at the beginning of the 20th century (at least in Europe). Lenin believed that the economic crisis of 1900 accelerated and intensified the concentration of industry and banking, which led to the transformation of the finance capital connection to industry into the monopoly of large banks.&quot; In &quot;Imperialism: the Highest Stage of Capitalism&quot;, Lenin wrote; &quot;the twentieth century marks the turning-point from the old capitalism to the new, from the domination of capital in general to the domination of finance capital.&quot; Lenin&#x27;s defines imperialism as the monopoly stage of capitalism.

Despite radical anti-imperialism being an original core value of Bolshevism, the Soviet Union from 1939 onward was widely viewed as a de facto imperial power whose ideology could not allow it to admit its own imperialism. Through the Soviet ideological viewpoint, pro-Soviet factions in each country were the only legitimate voice of &quot;the people&quot; regardless of whether they were minority factions. All other factions were simply class enemies of &quot;the people&quot;, inherently illegitimate rulers regardless of whether they were majority factions. Thus, in this view, any country that became Soviet or a Soviet ally naturally did so via a legitimate voluntary desire, even if the requesters needed Soviet help to accomplish it. The principal examples were the Soviet invasion of Finland yielding the annexation of Finnish parts of Karelia, the Soviet invasion of Poland, the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states, and the postwar de facto dominance over the satellite states of the Eastern Bloc under a pretense of total independence. In the post-Soviet era even many Ukrainians, Georgians, and Armenians feel that their countries were forcibly annexed by the Bolsheviks, but this has been a problematic view because the pro-Soviet factions in these societies were once sizable as well. Each faction felt that the other did not represent the true national interest. This civil war–like paradox has been seen in the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, as pro-Russian Crimeans have been viewed as illegitimate by pro-Ukrainian Crimeans, and vice versa.

===Peaceful coexistence===

&quot;Peaceful coexistence&quot; was an ideological concept introduced under Khrushchev&#x27;s rule. While the concept has been interpreted by fellow communists as proposing an end to the conflict between the systems of capitalism and socialism, Khrushchev saw it instead as a continuation of the conflict in every area with the exception in the military field. The concept claimed that the two systems were developed &quot;by way of diametrically opposed laws&quot;, which led to &quot;opposite principles in foreign policy.&quot;

The concept was steeped in Leninist and Stalinist thought. Lenin believed that international politics were dominated by class struggle, and Stalin stressed in the 1940s the growing polarization which was occurring in the capitalist and socialist systems. Khrushchev&#x27;s peaceful coexistence was based on practical changes which had occurred; he accused the old &quot;two camp&quot; theory of neglecting the non-aligned movement and the national liberation movements. Khrushchev considered these &quot;grey areas&quot;, in which the conflict between capitalism and socialism would be fought. He still stressed that the main contradiction in international relations were those of capitalism and socialism. The Soviet Government under Khrushchev stressed the importance of peaceful coexistence, claiming it had to form the basis of Soviet foreign policy. Failure to do, they believed, would lead to nuclear conflict. Despite this, Soviet theorists still considered peaceful coexistence as a continuation of the class struggle between the capitalist and socialist worlds, just not one based on armed conflict. Khrushchev believed that the conflict, in its current phase, was mainly economical.

The emphasis on peaceful coexistence did not mean that the Soviet Union accepted a static world, with clear lines. They continued to uphold the creed that socialism was inevitable, and they sincerely believed that the world had reached a stage in which the &quot;correlations of forces&quot; were moving towards socialism. Also, with the establishment of socialist regimes in Eastern Europe and Asia, Soviet foreign policy-planners believed that capitalism had lost its dominance as an economic system.

===Socialism in one country===
The concept of &quot;socialism in one country&quot; was conceived by Stalin in his struggle against Leon Trotsky and his concept of permanent revolution. In 1924, Trotsky published his pamphlet &quot;Lessons of October&quot; in which he stated that socialism in the Soviet Union would fail because of the backward state of economic development unless a world revolution began. Stalin responded to Trotsky&#x27;s pamphlet with his article, &quot;October and Comrade Trotsky&#x27;s Theory of Permanent Revolution&quot;. In it, Stalin stated, that he did not believe an inevitable conflict between the working class and the peasants would take place, further adding that &quot;socialism in one country is completely possible and probable&quot;. Stalin held the view common amongst most Bolsheviks at the time; there was possibility of real success for socialism in the Soviet Union despite the country&#x27;s backwardness and international isolation. While Grigoriy Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev and Nikolai Bukharin, together with Stalin, opposed Trotsky&#x27;s theory of permanent revolution, they diverged on how socialism could be built. According to Bukharin, Zinoviev and Kamenev supported the resolution of the 14th Conference (held in 1925) which stated that &quot;we cannot complete the building of socialism due to our technological backwardness.&quot; Despite the rather cynical attitude, Zinoviev and Kamenev did believe that a defective form of socialism could be constructed. At the 14th Conference, Stalin reiterated his position, claiming that socialism in one country was feasible despite the capitalist blockade of the country. After the conference, Stalin wrote &quot;Concerning the Results of the XIV Conference of the RCP(b)&quot;, in which he stated that the peasantry would not turn against the socialist system because he believed they had a self-interest in preserving. The contradictions which would arise with the peasantry during the socialist transition, Stalin surmised, could &quot;be overcome by our own efforts&quot;. He concluded that the only viable threat to socialism in the Soviet Union was a military intervention.

In late 1925, Stalin received a letter from a party official which stated that his position of &quot;Socialism in One Country&quot; was in contradiction with Friedrich Engels own writings on the subject. Stalin countered, stating that Engels&#x27; writings &#x27;reflected&#x27; &quot;the era of pre-monopoly capitalism, the pre-imperialist era when there were not yet the conditions of an uneven, abrupt development of the capitalist countries.&quot; From 1925 onwards, Bukharin began writing extensively on the subject, and in 1926, Stalin wrote &quot;On Questions of Leninism&quot;, which contained his best-known writings on the subject. Trotsky, with the publishing of &quot;Leninism&quot;, began countering Bukharin&#x27;s and Stalin&#x27;s arguments, claiming that socialism in one country was possible, but only in the short-run, and claimed that without a world revolution it would be impossible to safeguard the Soviet Union from the &quot;restoration of bourgeoisie relations&quot;. Zinoviev on the other hand, disagreed with both Trotsky and Bukharin and Stalin, holding instead steadfast to Lenin&#x27;s own position from 1917 to 1922, and continued to claim that only a defecting form of socialism could be constructed in the Soviet Union without a world revolution. Bukharin, by now, began arguing for the creation of an autarkic economic model, while Trotsky, in contrast, claimed that the Soviet Union had to participate in the international division of labour to develop. In contrast to Trotsky and Bukharin, Stalin did not believe a world revolution was possible, claiming in 1938 that a world revolution was in fact impossible, and claiming that Engels was wrong on the matter. At the 18th Congress, Stalin took the theory to its inevitable conclusion, claiming that the communist mode of production could be conceived in one country. He rationalised this by claiming that the state could exist in a communist society, as long as the Soviet Union was encircled by capitalism. However, surprisingly, with the establishment of satellite states in Eastern Europe, Stalin claimed that socialism in one country was only possible in a large country like the Soviet Union, and that the other states, in order to survive, had to follow the Soviet line.

==History==
The concept of Bolshevism arose at the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (1903) as a result of the split of the party into two factions: supporters of Lenin and the rest. One of the main reasons for the split was the question of a party of a new type. In the course of work on the Charter of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, Vladimir Lenin and Yuliy Martov proposed two different wordings of the clause on party membership. According to Lenin&#x27;s wording, a party member is a citizen who recognizes the program and charter, pays membership fees and works in one of the party organizations. Martov suggested limiting the charter to the first two requirements. During the elections to the central organs of the party, the majority was won by supporters of the Leninist formulation, after which Lenin began to call his faction &quot;Bolsheviks&quot;, while Martov called his supporters &quot;Mensheviks&quot;. Although in the subsequent history of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, Lenin&#x27;s supporters often found themselves in the minority, they were assigned the politically advantageous name &quot;Bolsheviks&quot;.

As Lenin&#x27;s biographer Robert Service points out, the division of the newly created party into two factions &quot;plunged Russian Marxists into a state of shock&quot;. All but the extreme left Petersburg Marxists disagreed with Lenin&#x27;s party policy.

At the Fourth Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party in 1906, the organizational unity of the party was temporarily restored. At the Fifth Congress, the Central Committee was elected, which, due to disagreements between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks, turned out to be unworkable, and the Bolshevik Center, headed by Vladimir Lenin, which was created during the Congress by Bolshevik delegates at one of its factional meetings, arbitrarily took over the leadership of the Bolshevik organizations of the party.

At the Sixth (Prague) Conference of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, held on January 18–30, 1912, which constituted itself as the all–party conference of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party and the supreme organ of the party, almost exclusively Lenin&#x27;s supporters were represented. By this time, the central committee of the party had virtually ceased to exist (its last plenum was held in January 1910), and the party found itself without an official leading center. In this regard, a Bolshevik Central Committee was elected at the Prague Conference.

In 1916, Lenin wrote his work &quot;Imperialism as the Highest Stage of Capitalism&quot;, which was a major contribution to the development of classical Marxism in the new conditions. In this work the thesis about the unevenness of economic and political development of capitalism in the epoch of imperialism was expressed and theoretically grounded, which leads to the conclusion about the possibility of the victory of socialism initially in a few or in one single country, which is not yet economically developed enough – such as Russia – provided that the head of the revolutionary movement will be a disciplined avant–garde, ready to go all the way to the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Immediately after the outbreak of the World War, Lenin and his supporters advanced the slogan of the defeat of tsarism in the war and the transformation of the imperialist war into a civil war. It was with this that Lenin&#x27;s criticism of the so–called &quot;social–chauvinists&quot;, who supported their governments in the world war, was connected. Lenin viewed the civil war as &quot;an inevitable continuation, development and intensification of the class struggle&quot;.

By the beginning of the February Revolution, the leading figures of the Bolshevik faction were mainly in exile or in emigration, and therefore the Bolsheviks did not take an organized part in it. The Bolshevik leaders who returned from exile, who, along with the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, became members of the Petrograd Soviet, at first tended to cooperate with the Provisional Government. From the very beginning, while still abroad, Lenin insisted on the immediate break of the Petrograd Soviet with the Provisional Government in order to actively prepare for the transition from the bourgeois–democratic to the next, &quot;proletarian&quot; stage of the revolution, the seizure of power and the end of the war. Returning to Russia, he came up with a new program of action for the Bolshevik party – the April Theses – in which he put on the agenda the demand for the transfer of all power to the Soviets in the interests of the proletariat and the poorest peasantry. Faced with resistance even among the representatives of &quot;theoretical&quot;, &quot;scientific&quot; Bolshevism, Lenin managed to overcome it, relying on the support of the lower classes – local party organizations, adherents of immediate practical action. In the course of the unfolding controversy about the possibility of socialism in Russia, Lenin rejected all the critical arguments of the Mensheviks, socialist revolutionaries and other political opponents about the country&#x27;s unpreparedness for a socialist revolution due to its economic backwardness, weakness, lack of culture and organization of the working masses, including the proletariat, about the danger the split of the revolutionary democratic forces and the inevitability of a civil war.

In April 1917, the split of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party was finalized. During a heated discussion at the 7th All–Russian (April) Conference of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) ( April 24–29), the April Theses received the support of the majority of delegates from the localities and formed the basis of the policy of the entire party. The Bolshevik faction became known as the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks).

The Russian Social Democratic Labour Party was renamed the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) at the 7th (April) Conference in 1917. In March 1918, the party adopted the name of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and in December 1925, the All–Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). At the 19th Congress in October 1952, the All–Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) was renamed the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

In 1990, at the last, 28th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, during the legalization of political platforms within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Bolshevik Platform was formed, giving rise to several modern political parties and social movements.

===Bolshevism and private property===
Realizing the Leninist slogan &quot;plunder the loot&quot;, the Bolsheviks en masse carried out a complete confiscation (expropriation) from the owners of private property, which they considered acquired through the exploitation of the working people, that is, the robbery of the workers. At the same time, the Bolsheviks never found out whether private property was obtained through their own labor, or through the exploitation of other people, whether the owners adequately paid for hired labor, what part of the confiscated private property the owner created with his own labor.

===Bolsheviks and the Russian Revolution===
During and before the Russian Revolution, the Bolsheviks and their ideology led up to the formation of the Communist Party. Vladimir Lenin and his ideas for &quot;a workers&#x27; socialist state&quot; heavily dominated the movement.

This is how the famous Social Democrat Alexander Parvus wrote about the topic in 1918:
Bolshevik figures such as Anatoly Lunacharsky, Moisei Uritsky and Dmitry Manuilsky agreed that Lenin’s influence on the Bolshevik party was decisive but the October insurrection was carried out according to Trotsky’s, not to Lenin’s plan.

==Support for the Bolsheviks by the people==
According to the British historian Orlando Figes, the opinion that the Bolsheviks were raised to the top of power by massive popular support for their party was not true. According to Figes, the October Uprising in Petrograd was a coup d&#x27;état supported by only a small part of the population. Figes explains the success of the Bolsheviks by the fact that the latter were the only political party that uncompromisingly advocated the slogan &quot;all power to the Soviets&quot;, which gained great popularity in 1917 after the unsuccessful Revolt of General Kornilov. As Figes points out, in the fall of 1917, there was a stream of resolutions from factories, from villages, from army units, calling for the formation of a Soviet government. At the same time, the authors of the resolutions understood &quot;the power of the Soviets&quot; as the All–Russian Council with the participation of all socialist parties.

Meanwhile, the commitment of the Bolsheviks to the principle of Soviet power was not at all so unconditional. In July 1917, when the Bolshevik Party was unable to obtain a majority in the Soviets of Workers&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Deputies, it &quot;temporarily removed&quot; the slogan &quot;all Power to the Soviets!&quot;. After the October coup, during the so–called &quot;triumphal march of Soviet power&quot; in those cases when individual Soviets did not agree to become the organs of the dictatorship of the Russian Social–Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (Bolsheviks), the Bolsheviks did not hesitate to disperse them and replace them by emergency bodies – revolutionary committees, military revolutionary committees, etc.

Alexander Parvus wrote in 1918:

===Supporters and opponents===
The Bolsheviks were supported, although not without criticism of their political practice, by left–wing theorists in Europe, such as Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht.

At the same time, this political trend rejected the centrist social democrats, for example, Karl Kautsky and the extreme left supporters of &quot;workers&#x27; council communism&quot;, for example, Otto Rühle and Antonie Pannekoek. The answer to the extreme leftist criticism was given by Lenin in the brochure &quot;Childhood Illness of &quot;Leftism&quot; in Communism&quot;, in turn Antonie Pannekoek answered to Vladimir Lenin in the work &quot;World Revolution and Communist Tactics&quot;.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the Left Opposition to Stalin adopted the self–designation &quot;Bolshevik–Leninists&quot;, thereby emphasizing its continuity with the revolutionary tradition as opposed to Thermidorian Stalinism. After the political trials of the 1930s, most of the &quot;Leninist Guards&quot; were repressed. Proceeding from this, there is an opinion that Bolshevism as a phenomenon has left the historical scene:
But on the other hand, a number of scientists are of the opinion that Bolshevism has undergone changes over time, and as a phenomenon, it ended only in the early 1990s.

Some modern scholars agree that Bolshevism:

In Western political science, some authors analyze Bolshevism from the standpoint of similarities and differences with fascism and Nazism.

According to sociologist Boris Kagarlitsky, one of the central contradictions of the post–revolutionary policy of the Bolsheviks is defined as a consequence of the historically developed socio–political situation in Russia:

In journalism, some authors also understand it as a synonym for extreme extremism, ideological fanaticism, intolerance, and a propensity for violence.

===Social democratic views===
Bolshevism was criticized by the Social Democrats. Thus, the famous Social Democrat Alexander Parvus wrote in 1918:
===Criticism and historical estimates===
According to the philosopher and linguist Nikolay Trubetskoy:

The authors of &quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot; note:

Russian President Vladimir Putin, answering questions in the Federation Council on June 27, 2012, accused the Bolshevik leadership of betraying national interests – &quot;the Bolsheviks committed an act of national betrayal...&quot; as a result of which Russia lost the First World War – &quot;...the result of the betrayal of the then government&quot;.

<doc id="167140" wikidata="Q932202" url="?curid=167140" title="Peace of Nicias">
<text>The Peace of Nicias was a peace treaty signed between the Greek city-states of Athens and Sparta in March 421 BC that ended the first half of the Peloponnesian War. 

In 425 BC, the Spartans had lost the battles of Pylos and Sphacteria, a severe defeat resulting in the Athenians holding 292 prisoners. At least 120 were Spartiates, who had recovered by 424 BC, when the Spartan general Brasidas captured Amphipolis. In the same year, the Athenians suffered a major defeat in Boeotia at the Battle of Delium, and in 422 BC, they were defeated again at the Battle of Amphipolis in their attempt to take back that city. Both Brasidas, the leading Spartan general, and Cleon, the leading politician in Athens, were killed at Amphipolis. By then, both sides were exhausted and ready for peace.

The negotiations were started by Pleistoanax, King of Sparta, and Nicias, an Athenian general. The most amicable proposal was to return everything to the prewar state except for Nisaea and Plataea. Athens would retain control of Nisaea and Thebes would retain control over Plataea. Amphipolis would be returned to Athens and Pylos would be returned to Sparta. Athenians would release the Spartan prisoners taken at Sphacteria and Sparta together with Thebes would return Athenian prisoners. Temples throughout Greece would be open to worshipers from all cities, and the oracle at Delphi would regain its autonomy. Athens would continue to collect tribute from the states from which it had received it since the time of Aristides, but Athens could not force them to become allies. Athens also agreed to come to Sparta&#x27;s aid if the helots revolted. Few of Sparta&#x27;s allies agreed to sign the peace. Boeotia, Corinth, Elis, Megara and Amphipolis opposed the treaty. 

Seventeen representatives from each side swore an oath to uphold the treaty, which was meant to last for fifty years. The Spartan representatives were the kings Pleistoanax and Agis II, Pleistolas, Damagetus, Chionis, Metagenes, Acanthus, Daithus, Ischagoras, Philocharidas, Zeuxidas, Antiphus, Tellis, Alcindas, Empedias, Menas, and Laphilus. The Athenian representatives were Lampon, Isthmonicus, Nicias, Laches, Euthydemus, Procles, Pythodorus, Hagnon, Myrtilus, Thrasycles, Theagenes, Aristocrates, Iolcius, Timocrates, Leon, Lamachus, and Demosthenes. However, Athens&#x27;s chief goal, the restoration of Amphipolis, was denied when Clearidas obtained from the Spartans a clause in the treaty negating the transfer. The treaty was broken from the start and, after several more failures, was formally abandoned in 414 BC. The Peloponnesian War resumed the second stage.

<text>Francisco Muniz IV (; born December 5, 1985) is an American actor and professional stock car racing driver. Muniz came to prominence in the 2000s playing the title character of the Fox sitcom &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; (2000–2006), for which he was nominated for an Emmy and two Golden Globe Awards. He also worked in the films &quot;Big Fat Liar&quot; (2002), &quot;Deuces Wild&quot; (2002), &quot;Agent Cody Banks&quot; (2003), and &quot;Racing Stripes&quot; (2005). At the height of his fame in 2003, Muniz was considered one of the most popular child actors and &quot;one of Hollywood&#x27;s most bankable teens&quot;.

In 2008, Muniz put his acting career on hold to pursue an open-wheel racing career and competed in the Atlantic Championship. He returned to racing in 2021 in stock cars, joining Rette Jones Racing for a full season in the ARCA Menards Series in 2023, where he finished 4th in the standings. He competes full-time in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series, driving the No. 33 Ford F-150 for Reaume Brothers Racing.

==Early life==
Francisco Muniz IV was born in Wood-Ridge, New Jersey, on December 5, 1985, the son of nurse Denise and restaurateur Francisco Muñiz III. Muniz&#x27;s mother is half Irish and half Italian, while his father is Puerto Rican (of Spanish descent from Asturias). He has an older sister named Cristina. When Muniz was four years old, his family moved to Knightdale, North Carolina, where he grew up. He was discovered at the age of eight at a talent show in Raleigh, North Carolina, playing Tiny Tim in a local production of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. His parents divorced shortly after, and he subsequently moved with his mother to Burbank, California. Beginning in the sixth grade, he was home-schooled by his mother.

==Career==
===Acting===

Muniz appeared in commercials and made his film debut in the made-for-television movie &quot;To Dance with Olivia&quot; (1997), starring Lou Gossett Jr. In that same year, he appeared in the CBS Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation of &quot;What the Deaf Man Heard&quot;. A small role in the film &quot;Lost &amp; Found&quot; (1999) led to his breakout role as the title character on Linwood Boomer&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, which premiered on Fox on January 9, 2000. The show was successful and it was quickly met with accolades. The pilot episode was watched by 23 million people and the second episode, &quot;Red Dress&quot; (premiered on January 16, 2000), by 26 million. He was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2001, and received &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; &quot;Young Star Award&quot; for his work in the series.

Throughout his television career, Muniz made guest appearances on the shows &quot;Lizzie McGuire;&quot; &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch;&quot; and &quot;MADtv&quot;. His first starring role was as Willie Morris in the 2000 family drama film &quot;My Dog Skip&quot;, which was released at the same approximate time as the pilot for &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;. That same year, he provided the character voice of Domino in the 2000 video game &quot;102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue&quot; and was featured on the video game &quot;Stargate Worlds&quot;.

The following year, he contributed a character voice to the animal cast of the film &quot;Dr. Dolittle 2&quot;. Muniz was also the voice of Chester McBadBat in the first two seasons of &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; until Jason Marsden took over. He had a hit with the 2002 release &quot;Big Fat Liar&quot;, in which he co-starred with teen actress Amanda Bynes as a pair of students seeking revenge on a sleazy movie producer (played by Paul Giamatti). Muniz was also part of the ensemble for the gang film &quot;Deuces Wild&quot;, released that same year. In 2003, he made a cameo appearance as Cher&#x27;s underage boyfriend in &quot;Stuck on You&quot;. That same year, he appeared in the series premiere of Ashton Kutcher&#x27;s MTV practical joke series &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot;.

Muniz subsequently played the title role in the film &quot;Agent Cody Banks&quot; as well as its sequel, &quot;Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London&quot;. The first film opened in March 2003, and grossed $47 million; the sequel, which opened a year later, grossed $28 million. He trained in martial arts for the films and performed most of his own stunts. He also commented that it was the point in his career where he should &quot;make the transition from child actor to an adult actor or a respectable actor.&quot; In 2004, he wrote the teleplay of the TV show &quot;Granted&quot;, on which he was also the executive producer.

Muniz provided the character voice of a zebra named Stripes, who wishes to become a racing equine, in the 2005 film &quot;Racing Stripes&quot;. That same year, he made a guest appearance as himself in &quot;Mr. F&quot;, an episode of the Fox comedy &quot;Arrested Development&quot;. In April 2006, he began filming &quot;My Sexiest Year&quot;, an independent film in which Harvey Keitel played his father. He announced, during that same month, that he would be taking a break from acting, in order to pursue a career in race car driving, under a full-time two-year deal with Jensen Motorsport in the Formula BMW competition. In 2006, he was executive producer for the movie &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure: The Abominable Snowman&quot;.

&quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; finished its run on May 14, 2006. Ten days later, on May 24, Muniz appeared in the horror film &quot;Stay Alive&quot;. He expressed a desire to leave traditional Hollywood film roles behind, saying: &quot;Growing up has never scared me until last year. I started thinking about getting older, being an adult, and it scared me. Hopefully things will work out in my career. If they don&#x27;t, then it was never meant to be.&quot;

Despite his earlier stated intention to take a break from acting, in May 2006, he signed on to star in the R-rated teen-sex comedy &quot;Extreme Movie&quot;. The film was originally planned to be released in 2007 by Dimension Films, but was ultimately released straight to DVD in February 2009.

In 2007, he became an associate producer of the film &quot;Choose Connor&quot;. In late 2007, he made a guest appearance in an episode of the CBS crime drama &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;. In December 2007, he made a cameo appearance in the movie &quot;Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story&quot;, playing Buddy Holly. In 2008, he began work on a film with former Missy Elliott protégée Brianna Perry, but the project was never released.

Muniz made a foray into the superhero genre with the family action film &quot;Pizza Man&quot;, in 2011. In 2012, he made a cameo appearance as himself in the second season of the comedy &quot;Don&#x27;t Trust the B---- in Apartment 23&quot;. In 2015, he made another cameo appearance in &quot;The Mysteries of Laura&quot;, in which one of the detectives (Merideth Bose) had a crush on the actor/ racecar driver (Frankie Muniz) who was competing in a drag race. The team was on an NYPD case and suspected evidence would present itself at the drag race.

On September 6, 2017, Muniz was announced as one of the celebrities who would compete on the 25th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He was paired with professional dancer, Witney Carson. Muniz and Carson finished the season in third place.

On August 1, 2018, it was announced Muniz would be the co-host of &quot;Dancing with the Stars Juniors&quot; on ABC, co-hosting with Jordan Fisher who was Season 25&#x27;s Mirrorball Trophy winner.

In 2021, he was a guest star in an episode of ABC&#x27;s The Rookie. He played a former child actor who had become a cult leader, in an apparent parody of his former teen idol status.

On December 21, 2023, he starred with Kelly Elizabeth Lawera and Kyle Fecteau in Santa&#x27;s Training Camp/Ford Performance.

On March 24, 2024, it was revealed he was joining the Australian adaption of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; as a celebrity contestant. On 14 April, Muniz withdrew from the series for family reasons.

===Racing===
Muniz has had a long-running interest in car racing. On February 18, 2001, Muniz drove the pace car for the Daytona 500 and met Dale Earnhardt shortly before Earnhardt entered his vehicle for the race. Muniz, who was also attending the race to film for MTV&#x27;s documentary series &quot;True Life&quot;, witnessed the subsequent crash on the final lap which killed Earnhardt.

Muniz&#x27;s career in car racing traces back to 2004, when he ran the Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race in Long Beach as a celebrity participant, finishing 7th. The following year, he finished third, and was the best-finishing celebrity after capitalizing on Ingo Rademacher and Aaron Peirsol&#x27;s contact on the final lap. While investigating the possibility of joining a racing team as an owner, he was granted a test in a car, and instead signed a two-year deal with Jensen Motorsport as a driver. Muniz entered fourteen races during the 2006 Formula BMW USA season, and failed to finish in a point-scoring position. He was selected as one of the thirty–six drivers to compete in the annual Formula BMW World Final at Valencia. Muniz finished 29th. In April, he again competed in the Toyota Pro/Celebrity, finishing 11th after starting 19th.

In 2007, Muniz moved up to the more competitive Champ Car Atlantic Series, where he competed in the entire season of 12 races. For the season, his best race finish was ninth place, and he officially earned a total of 41 points (for 22nd place) and $17,000 in prize money, logging 351 laps. In January 2007, he placed second at the Sebring Winter National race. He signed with Atlantic Championship-winning team Pacific Coast Motorsports in January 2008, with a goal to consistently compete in the top ten of the points championship. He finished the 2008 season in eleventh place. At the end of the 2008 season, he won the Jovy Marcelo Award, an award for sportsmanship voted on by fellow drivers named in memory of the 1991 Atlantic Championship winner who was killed during practice for the 1992 Indianapolis 500. In 2009, Muniz joined Team Stargate Worlds, and finished in the top ten in every race he contested, with a best finish of fourth at Miller Motorsports Park. However, prior to the penultimate race at Road America, his season was shortened by wrist surgery.

In 2011, Muniz returned to the Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race; after starting 15th, he finished 4th.

On October 23, 2021, Muniz made his stock car racing debut at Kern County Raceway Park in Bakersfield, California, competing in the SRL Pro Late Model series driving for High Point Racing.

In January 2022, Muniz participated in the ARCA Menards Series test at Daytona International Speedway, driving the No. 01 Ford for Fast Track Racing.

On January 11, 2023, it was announced that Muniz would drive full-time for Rette Jones Racing in the ARCA Menards Series in the team&#x27;s No. 30 Ford Mustang. Muniz finished fourth in the standings with one top-five and 11 top-tens, including a season-best fifth-place finish at Michigan International Speedway.

On February 9, 2024, it was announced that Muniz would attempt to make his NASCAR Xfinity Series debut at the season-opening race at Daytona International Speedway, driving the No. 35 Ford for Joey Gase Motorsports. Along with that race, he would compete on a part-time schedule in the car.

On June 19, 2024, it was announced that Muniz would attempt his NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series debut at Nashville Superspeedway, driving the No. 22 Ford F-150 for Reaume Brothers Racing. It was also announced that Muniz would make two additional starts for the team, as well as an ARCA Menards Series start at Michigan International Speedway for the team.

On October 22, 2024, it was announced that Muniz will drive full-time for Reaume Brothers Racing in the No. 33 truck for the NASCAR Truck Series 2025 season, replacing Lawless Alan.

===Music===
Muniz joined the unsigned band You Hang Up as a drummer.

In 2012, he joined Kingsfoil, a band based in York, Pennsylvania, and endorsed SJC Drums and Imperial Cymbals. In 2014, he left the band because of scheduling problems.

In 2017, Muniz announced on Facebook that he is the manager for the York-based band Astro Lasso, which consists of Jordan Davis and Tristan Martin of his former band Kingsfoil. Muniz travels with the band doing their monitor systems, lights, as well as being the designated driver. The band opened for We the Kings, Cute Is What We Aim For, and Plaid Brixx on the 10th anniversary of We the Kings&#x27; self titled album tour during spring of 2017.

===Business ventures===
Muniz has been an active real estate investor throughout his adult life. In addition to purchasing multiple residential properties, Muniz purchased parking lots in Downtown Los Angeles, specifically around the Staples Center, in the early 2000s in an effort to generate passive income with low overhead. Muniz sold the parking lots in 2006.

In 2018, Muniz and Paige Price bought Outrageous Olive Oils &amp; Vinegars, a small specialty shop in Scottsdale, Arizona. He said that he and Price had fallen into &quot;complementary step&quot; with Price handling the inventory and social media while he tackles logistics. In an interview with &quot;The Cut&quot;, he explained his schedule: &quot;My day this morning started at 6 a.m. getting up to go to Restaurant Depot to get products that we needed. Then I got here early to start filling bottles and to make sure all the shelves were stocked. We&#x27;re not just ordering product and putting it on the shelf. We bottle everything. We label the bottles. We seal everything. We do all that ourselves here in store. It&#x27;s a lot of work, but it&#x27;s really rewarding when people come in and rave about the product.&quot; In August 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the two sold the store; they said that Price&#x27;s pregnancy was the reason for the sale, and that sales were steady despite the pandemic forcing the business into an online-only model. In May 2021, Muniz spoke about his love for carbon fiber wallets and announced a partnership with The Ridge Wallet.

==Personal life==
Muniz is a fan of the Arizona Cardinals and the Los Angeles Clippers.

Muniz is reportedly a supporter of English football club Coventry City, this connection apparently coming from a friendship he made with a producer on the set of the film &quot;Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London&quot;.

In 2005, Muniz was engaged to Jamie Gandy. In 2008, he met publicist Elycia Marie Turnbow through their mutual personal trainer at a Los Angeles gym. They began dating and later moved to Scottsdale, Arizona. They had a domestic dispute in February 2011, which involved the police and reportedly involved Muniz pointing a gun at his own head, though he later called this a &quot;fake overblown story&quot;. They became engaged in October 2011, but they later called it off.

Muniz began dating actress and model Paige Price in 2016, and he announced their engagement on November 18, 2018. They married on October 3, 2019. Their son was born on March 22, 2021.

===Health problems===
On November 30, 2012, at age 26, Muniz was hospitalized after having a suspected transient ischemic attack, and spoke about the experience on &quot;Katie&quot;. He was diagnosed with a second attack a year later on November 25, 2013. When asked about his health in October 2017, he said that he has had no issues. However, that same month, it was claimed on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; that he suffered significant amnesia, theorized to be caused (at least partially) by multiple concussions; the TV show star gave the impression that he could not remember the majority of his time on &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, and that his former co-star Bryan Cranston often called him to remind him about the good times they had.

In 2021, as a guest on the &quot;Steve-O&#x27;s Wild Ride!&quot; podcast, Muniz revealed that the mini-strokes were a misdiagnosis and he was instead suffering from migraine auras. He also clarified that the story of his memory loss was largely misinterpreted by media sources. In the same podcast he also clarified that reports of his amnesia were false, and that they were based on a throwaway sentence: &quot;Man, I don&#x27;t remember what happened in 2001.&quot; Individual gaps in his memory occurred due to a large number of concussions as a teenager.

<doc id="167146" wikidata="Q7653615" url="?curid=167146" title="Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education">
<text>Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1 (1971), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case dealing with the busing of students to promote integration in public schools. The Court held that busing was an appropriate remedy for the problem of racial imbalance in schools, even when the imbalance resulted from the selection of students based on geographic proximity to the school rather than from deliberate assignment based on race. This was done to ensure the schools would be &quot;properly&quot; integrated and that all students would receive equal educational opportunities regardless of their race.

Judge John J. Parker of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit interpreted the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; case as a charge not to segregate rather than an order to integrate. In 1963, the Court ruled in &quot;McNeese v. Board of Education and Goss v. Board of Education&quot; in favor of integration, and showed impatience with efforts to end segregation. In 1968 the Warren Court ruled in &quot;Green v. County School Board&quot; that freedom of choice plans were insufficient to eliminate segregation; thus, it was necessary to take proactive steps to integrate schools. In &quot;United States v. Montgomery County Board of Education&quot; (1969), Judge Frank Johnson&#x27;s desegregation order for teachers was upheld, allowing an approximate ratio of the races to be established by a district judge.

== Background ==
North Carolina was one of the more moderate Southern states, and its resistance to integration was much weaker than in most other areas of the South. After &quot;Brown&quot;, it had ended segregation with a school assignment plan based on neighborhoods that was approved by the Court. However, when Charlotte consolidated school districts from the city itself with a surrounding area totaling , the majority of black students (who lived in central Charlotte) still attended mostly black schools as compared with majority white schools further outside the city.

==Legal proceedings==
The NAACP Legal Defense Fund brought the Swann case on behalf of six-year-old James Swann and nine other families, with Julius L. Chambers presenting the case. Swann was chosen because his father was a theology professor, and was thus unlikely to be economically burdened by local retaliation.

In 1965, Judge J. Braxton Craven decided &quot;Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education&quot; in favor of Charlotte-Mecklenburg, because there was no requirement in the Constitution to act purposely to increase racial mixing.

After the Green ruling, the Swann case was filed again, and this time taken by Judge James Bryan McMillan as his first important case on the federal bench. McMillan had at one point been a public opponent of busing to integrate schools, but when the case was presented to him he said that the facts outweighed his feelings, and busing was the only way to fulfill the constitutional requirement of desegregation.

Experts from Rhode Island College were brought in for the Plaintiff&#x27;s side to judge the effectiveness of the school board&#x27;s new plan. From April to November 1969, McMillan repeatedly ordered the board to revise the plan. The Board eventually submitted a plan rezoning neighborhoods into pie-shaped wedges, where blacks living in the center of Charlotte would be divided up and distributed to outlying, formerly white high schools. The school board&#x27;s plan required busing and would achieve a black population of 2-36% in all ten of the high schools. Due to the greater number of elementary schools, elaborate gerrymandering was required and would achieve greater integration, but would leave more than half of black elementary students at majority-black schools.

The Court rejected the Board&#x27;s plan in favor of outsider Dr. John Finger&#x27;s plan. The Finger Plan required busing of an additional 300 black students, established &quot;satellite zones&quot; and required pairing and grouping techniques to achieve even greater integration. As a consequence, McMillan became a local pariah. Chambers&#x27; home, office and car were bombed when he first took up the case.

When the case was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the case was heard &quot;en banc&quot; by six of the seven judges sitting on the court. The seventh judge Judge J. Braxton Craven, recused himself due to him being the original trial court judge. The opinion was 3-2-1 that the restructured busing orders should be affirmed for older students, but that it be remanded for those of elementary school age. Two dissenters would have affirmed the whole decision, while one would reverse McMillan&#x27;s ruling in its entirety. McMillan decided to follow his original plan for elementary school students after the case was remanded to him.

==Swann before the Supreme Court==
Justice Douglas had previously been strongly opposed to busing. The Court was urged to begin their term early to hear the case, but decided to wait until the first day of their new term to begin.

Despite his relative youth and inexperience, Julius Chambers argued the case, because of his intimate knowledge of the facts involved. Erwin Griswold, the Solicitor General of the United States, represented the federal government, advocating Nixon&#x27;s “go-slow” policy. Though no official vote was taken, Chief Justice Burger and Justice Black wanted to reverse McMillan&#x27;s order, while Justices Douglas, Harlan, Brennan, and Marshall wanted a strong affirmation of the order; Justices Stewart, White, and Blackmun did not express a strong feeling either way. Douglas, Brennan, and Marshall were quite liberal, but Harlan was usually conservative. When Burger circulated his very grudging affirmation of McMillan that limited future action and action in other areas by the Court, he met strong resistance. Douglas, Harlan, Brennan, and Marshall all demanded revisions and circulated suggestions for alternate drafts. Justice Stewart also reacted strongly after carefully considering the facts of the case, and wrote a “dissent” that would have been the opinion of the court without revisions of Burger&#x27;s drafts.

Burger revised the opinion five times, each time making a stronger affirmation of McMillan and incorporating the language of Harlan, Brennan, Stewart, and others into it. After the fifth draft, Justice Black threatened a dissent if the opinion was made any stronger an affirmation, and so a sixth and final draft was created that was close to what Justice Stewart had composed after the first conference. The final opinion was 9-0 affirming McMillan&#x27;s order.

The decision led to the widespread use of busing to end segregation by federal judges in the South.

==Timeline of the case being overturned==
When the courts mandated that busing should occur to desegregate the schools, they also noted that one day when the school system was thought to be unitary, busing would end and the school board would be able to come up with a new plan which would best suit the education of students in Charlotte-Mecklenburg.
After busing was enforced in 1971, throughout the 1970s and the 1980s, Charlotte was known across the nation as the “city that made desegregation work.” It paved the way for many different school systems to use the busing plan to force integration in the school systems.

However, due to the booming economy of the city in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Charlotte experienced a rapid immigration from the Northeast and the Midwest, which resulted in a decline of the acceptance of busing. In 1992, in response to these complaints, CMS created a managed choice plan to reduce the number of students being bused. This new choice plan revolved around magnet schools, making one-third of the schools in Charlotte-Mecklenburg either magnets or partial magnets, and each magnet had a quota of black and white students that were allowed to attend. But this didn&#x27;t please many white families who were denied entrance into magnet schools that had fulfilled their quotas.

In 1997, a parent, William Capacchione, sued the school system when his daughter was denied entrance into a magnet school for the second time based on her race. While the school system opposed the end of busing, Judge Robert D. Potter declared the mandate of a unitary system had been met and lifted the court order on mandatory busing by race or ethnicity. This ruling was upheld by the appeals court in Richmond, Virginia in 2000 and after the final appeal was declined to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, federal order of busing was ended in Charlotte-Mecklenburg and it was left in the hands of the city school board to decide how to redo the assignment policy for school attendance.

The new assignment policy which was adopted in the fall of 2002 was known as the “School Choice Plan.” This new choice plan divided the city into four large attendance zones based on neighborhoods. Students were allowed to choose to stay at their neighborhood &quot;home school,&quot; or they could rank their top three choices of any other school in CMS; however they would only receive free transportation to their home school or any of the magnet schools in the district. If families chose their home school as their first choice, they were guaranteed that school; otherwise they were entered into a lottery that gave available spaces in overenrolled schools. If people did not choose a school, they were immediately placed into their home school. After creating a variety of programs to inform families about the new plan, over 95% of the families in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system submitted choices for the new school year.

<text>Satyāgraha (from ; &quot;satya&quot;: &quot;truth&quot;, &quot;āgraha&quot;: &quot;insistence&quot; or &quot;holding firmly to&quot;), or &quot;holding firmly to truth&quot;,&quot;&quot; or &quot;truth force&quot;, is a particular form of nonviolent resistance or civil resistance. Someone who practises satyagraha is a satyagrahi.

The term &quot;satyagraha&quot; was coined and developed by Mahatma Gandhi (1869–1948) as early as 1919.
Gandhi practised satyagraha as part of the Indian independence movement and also during his earlier struggles in South Africa for Indian rights. Satyagraha theory influenced Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s and James Bevel&#x27;s campaigns during the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, as well as Nelson Mandela&#x27;s struggle against apartheid in South Africa and many other social-justice and similar movements.

== Principles ==
Gandhi envisioned &quot;satyagraha&quot; as not only a tactic to be used in acute political struggle but as a universal solvent for injustice and harm.

He founded the Sabarmati Ashram to teach &quot;satyagraha&quot;. He asked &quot;satyagrahis&quot; to follow the following principles 
# Nonviolence (ahimsa)
# Truth – this includes honesty, but goes beyond it to mean living fully in accord with and in devotion to that which is true
# Not stealing
# Non-possession (not the same as poverty)
# Body-labour or bread-labour
# Control of desires (gluttony)
# Fearlessness
# Equal respect for all religions
# Economic strategy such as boycotts of imported goods (&quot;swadeshi&quot;)

On another occasion, he listed these rules as &quot;essential for every Satyagrahi in India&quot;:
# Must have a living faith in God
# Must be leading a chaste life and be willing to die or lose all his possessions
# Must be a habitual khadi weaver and spinner
# Must abstain from alcohol and other intoxicants

== Rules for satyagraha campaigns ==
Gandhi proposed a series of rules for &quot;satyagrahi&quot;s to follow in a resistance campaign:
# Harbour no anger.
# Suffer the anger of the opponent.
# Never retaliate to assaults or punishment, but do not submit, out of fear of punishment or assault, to an order given in anger.
# Voluntarily submit to arrest or confiscation of your own property.
# If you are a trustee of property, defend that property (non-violently) from confiscation with your life.
# Do not curse or swear.
# Do not insult the opponent.
# Neither salute nor insult the flag of your opponent or your opponent&#x27;s leaders.
# If anyone attempts to insult or assault your opponent, defend your opponent (non-violently) with your life.
# As a prisoner, behave courteously and obey prison regulations (except any that are contrary to self-respect).
# As a prisoner, do not ask for special favourable treatment.
# As a prisoner, do not fast in an attempt to gain conveniences whose deprivation does not involve any injury to your self-respect.
# Joyfully obey the orders of the leaders of the civil disobedience action.

== Origin and meaning of name ==
The terms originated in a competition in the news-sheet &quot;Indian Opinion&quot; in South Africa in 1906. Mr. Maganlal Gandhi, grandson of an uncle of Mahatma Gandhi, came up with the word &quot;Sadagraha&quot; and won the prize. Subsequently, to make it clearer, Gandhi changed it to &quot;Satyagraha&quot;. &quot;Satyagraha&quot; is a &quot;tatpuruṣa&quot; compound of the Sanskrit words &quot;satya&quot; (meaning &quot;truth&quot;) and &quot;āgraha&quot; (&quot;polite insistence&quot;, or &quot;holding firmly to&quot;). Satya is derived from the word &quot;sat&quot;, which means &quot;being&quot;. Nothing is or exists in reality except Truth. In the context of satyagraha, Truth, therefore, includes a) Truth in speech, as opposed to falsehood, b) knowledge of what is real, as opposed to nonexistent (asat), and c) good as opposed to evil or bad. This was critical to Gandhi&#x27;s understanding of and faith in nonviolence: &quot;The world rests upon the bedrock of &quot;satya&quot; or truth. &quot;Asatya&quot;, meaning untruth, also means nonexistent, and &quot;satya&quot; or truth, also means that which is. If untruth does not so much as exist, its victory is out of the question. And truth being that which is, can never be destroyed. This is the doctrine of satyagraha in a nutshell.&quot;
For Gandhi, satyagraha went far beyond mere &quot;passive resistance&quot; and became strength in practising non-violent methods. In his words:
In September 1935, in a letter to P. Kodanda Rao, Servants of India Society, Gandhi disputed the proposition that his idea of civil disobedience was adapted from the writings of Henry David Thoreau, especially the essay &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot; published in 1849.
Gandhi described it as follows:

== Contrast to &quot;passive resistance&quot; ==

Gandhi distinguished between satyagraha and passive resistance in the following letter:
==Ahimsa and satyagraha==
There is a connection between ahimsa and satyagraha. Satyagraha is sometimes used to refer to the whole principle of nonviolence, where it is essentially the same as ahimsa, and sometimes used in a &quot;marked&quot; meaning to refer specifically to direct action that is largely obstructive, for example in the form of civil disobedience.

Gandhi says:
=== Defining success ===
Assessing the extent to which Gandhi&#x27;s ideas of satyagraha were or were not successful in the Indian independence struggle is a complex task. Judith Brown has suggested that &quot;this is a political strategy and technique which, for its outcomes, depends greatly on historical specificities.&quot; The view taken by Gandhi differs from the idea that the goal in any conflict is necessarily to defeat the opponent or frustrate the opponent&#x27;s objectives, or to meet one&#x27;s own objectives despite the efforts of the opponent to obstruct these. In satyagraha, by contrast, &quot;The Satyagrahi&#x27;s object is to convert, not to coerce, the wrong-doer.&quot; The opponent must be converted, at least as far as to stop obstructing the just end, for this cooperation to take place. There are cases, to be sure, when an opponent, e.g. a dictator, has to be unseated and one cannot wait to convert him. The &quot;satyagrahi&quot; would count this a partial success.

=== Means and ends ===
The theory of satyagraha sees means and ends as inseparable obtain an end are wrapped up in and attached to that end. Therefore, it is contradictory to try to use unjust means to obtain justice or to try to use violence to obtain peace. As Gandhi wrote: &quot;They say, &#x27;means are, after all, means&#x27;. I would say, &#x27;means are, after all, everything&#x27;. As the means so the end. Separating means and ends would ultimately amount to introducing a form of duality and inconsistency at the core of Gandhi&#x27;s non-dual (Advaitic) conception.

Gandhi used an example to explain this: &quot;If I want to deprive you of your watch, I shall certainly have to fight for it; if I want to buy your watch, I shall have to pay for it; and if I want a gift, I shall have to plead for it; and, according to the means I employ, the watch is stolen property, my own property, or a donation.&quot;
Gandhi rejected the idea that injustice should, or even could, be fought against &quot;by any means necessary&quot;—if you use violent, coercive, unjust means, whatever ends you produce will necessarily embed that injustice. However, in Hind Swaraj Gandhi admits that even though his book argues that machinery is bad, it was produced by machinery, which he says can do nothing good. Thus, he says, &quot;sometimes poison is used to kill poison&quot; and for that reason as long as machinery is viewed as bad it can be used to undo itself. This implies that sometimes, bad means can achieve positive ends.

=== Satyagraha versus duragraha ===
The essence of satyagraha is that it seeks to eliminate antagonisms without harming the antagonists themselves, as opposed to violent resistance, which is meant to cause harm to the antagonist. A satyagrahi therefore does not seek to end or destroy the relationship with the antagonist, but instead seeks to transform or &quot;purify&quot; it to a higher level. A euphemism sometimes used for satyagraha is that it is a &quot;silent force&quot; or a &quot;soul force&quot; (a term also used by Martin Luther King Jr. during his famous &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech). It arms the individual with moral power rather than physical power. Satyagraha is also termed a &quot;universal force,&quot; as it essentially &quot;makes no distinction between kinsmen and strangers, young and old, man and woman, friend and foe.&quot;

Gandhi contrasted satyagraha (holding on to truth) with &quot;duragraha&quot; (holding on by force), as in protest meant more to harass than enlighten opponents. He wrote: &quot;There must be no impatience, no barbarity, no insolence, no undue pressure. If we want to cultivate a true spirit of democracy, we cannot afford to be intolerant. Intolerance betrays want of faith in one&#x27;s cause.&quot;

Civil disobedience and non-cooperation as practised under satyagraha are based on the &quot;law of suffering&quot;, a doctrine that the endurance of suffering is a means to an end. This end usually implies a moral uplift or progress of an individual or society. Therefore, the non-cooperation of satyagraha is in fact a means to secure the cooperation of the opponent that is consistent with truth and justice.

==Large-scale usage of satyagraha==
When using satyagraha in a large-scale political conflict involving civil disobedience, Gandhi believed that the satyagrahis must undergo training to ensure discipline. He wrote that it is &quot;only when people have proved their active loyalty by obeying the many laws of the State that they acquire the right of Civil Disobedience.&quot;

He therefore made part of the discipline that satyagrahis:
# Appreciate the other laws of the State and obey them voluntarily
# Tolerate these laws, even when they are inconvenient
# Be willing to undergo suffering, loss of property, and to endure the suffering that might be inflicted on family and friends

This obedience has to be not merely grudging but extraordinary:
== American Civil Rights Movement ==
Satyagraha theory also influenced many other movements of nonviolence and civil resistance. For example, Martin Luther King Jr. wrote about Gandhi&#x27;s influence on his developing ideas regarding the Civil Rights Movement in the United States:

== Satyagraha in relation to genocide ==
In view of the Nazi persecution of the Jews in Germany, Gandhi offered satyagraha as a method of combating oppression and genocide, stating:

When Gandhi was criticized for these statements, he responded in another article entitled &quot;Some Questions Answered&quot;:

In a similar vein, anticipating a possible attack on India by Japan during World War II, Gandhi recommended satyagraha as a means of national defense (what is now sometimes called &quot;Civilian Based Defense&quot; (CBD) or &quot;social defence&quot;):

<doc id="167150" wikidata="Q179680" url="?curid=167150" title="Alfred de Musset">
<text>Alfred Louis Charles de Musset-Pathay (; 11 December 1810 – 2 May 1857) was a French dramatist, poet, and novelist. Along with his poetry, he is known for writing the autobiographical novel &quot;La Confession d&#x27;un enfant du siècle&quot; (&quot;The Confession of a Child of the Century&quot;).

==Biography==

Musset was born in Paris. His family was upper-class but poor; his father worked in various key government positions, but never gave his son any money. Musset&#x27;s mother came from similar circumstances, and her role as a society hostess – for example her drawing-room parties, luncheons and dinners held in the Musset residence – left a lasting impression on young Alfred.

An early indication of his boyhood talents was his fondness for acting impromptu mini-plays based upon episodes from old romance stories he had read. Years later, elder brother Paul de Musset would preserve these and many other details, for posterity, in a biography of his famous younger brother.

Alfred de Musset entered the lycée Henri-IV at the age of nine, where in 1827 he won the Latin essay prize in the Concours général at age 17. With the help of Paul Foucher, Victor Hugo&#x27;s brother-in-law, he began to attend, at the age of 17, the Cénacle, the literary salon of Charles Nodier at the Bibliothèque de l&#x27;Arsenal. After attempts at careers in medicine (which he gave up owing to a distaste for dissections), law, drawing, English and piano, he became one of the first Romantic writers, with his first collection of poems, &quot;Contes d&#x27;Espagne et d&#x27;Italie&quot; (1829, Tales of Spain and Italy). By the time he reached the age of 20, his rising literary fame was already accompanied by a sulphurous reputation fed by his dandy side.

He was the librarian of the French Ministry of the Interior under the July Monarchy. His politics were of a liberal stamp, and he was on good terms with the family of King Louis Philippe. During this time he also involved himself in polemics during the Rhine crisis of 1840, caused by the French prime minister Adolphe Thiers, who as Minister of the Interior had been Musset&#x27;s superior. Thiers had demanded that France should own the left bank of the Rhine (described as France&#x27;s &quot;natural boundary&quot;), as it had under Napoleon, despite the territory&#x27;s German population. These demands were rejected by German songs and poems, including Nikolaus Becker&#x27;s &quot;Rheinlied&quot;, which contained the verse: &quot;Sie sollen ihn nicht haben, den freien, deutschen Rhein ...&quot; (&quot;They shall not have it, the free, German Rhine&quot;). Musset answered to this with a poem of his own: &quot;Nous l&#x27;avons eu, votre Rhin allemand&quot; (&quot;We&#x27;ve had it, your German Rhine&quot;).

The tale of his celebrated love affair with George Sand in 1833–1835 is told from his point of view in his autobiographical novel &quot;La Confession d&#x27;un Enfant du Siècle&quot; (&quot;The Confession of a Child of the Century&quot;) (1836), which was made into a 1999 film, &quot;Children of the Century&quot;, and a 2012 film, &quot;Confession of a Child of the Century&quot;, and is told from her point of view in her &quot;Elle et lui&quot; (1859). Musset&#x27;s &quot;Nuits&quot; (Nights) (1835–1837) traces the emotional upheaval of his love for Sand from early despair to final resignation. He is also believed to be the anonymous author of &quot;Gamiani, or Two Nights of Excess&quot; (1833), a lesbian erotic novel which was rumored to be modeled on Sand.

Outside of his relationship with Sand he was a well-known figure in brothels, and is widely accepted to be the anonymous author-client who beat and humiliated the author and courtesan Céleste de Chabrillan, also known as &quot;La Mogador&quot;.

Musset was dismissed from his post as librarian by the new minister Ledru-Rollin after the revolution of 1848. He was, however, appointed librarian of the Ministry of Public Instruction in 1853.

On 24 April 1845, Musset received the Légion d&#x27;honneur at the same time as Balzac, and was elected to the Académie Française in 1852 after two failed attempts in 1848 and 1850.

Alfred de Musset died in his sleep in Paris in 1857. The cause was heart failure, the combination of alcoholism and a longstanding aortic insufficiency. One symptom that had been noticed by his brother was a bobbing of the head as a result of the amplification of the pulse; this was later called de Musset&#x27;s sign. He was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

==Reception==

The French poet Arthur Rimbaud was highly critical of Musset&#x27;s work. Rimbaud wrote in his &quot;Letters of a Seer&quot; (&quot;Lettres du Voyant&quot;) that Musset did not accomplish anything because he &quot;closed his eyes&quot; before the visions (letter to Paul Demeny, May 1871).

Director Jean Renoir&#x27;s &quot;La règle du jeu&quot; (&quot;The Rules of the Game&quot;) was inspired by Musset&#x27;s play &quot;Les Caprices de Marianne&quot;.

Henri Gervex&#x27;s 1878 painting &quot;Rolla&quot; was based on a poem by De Musset. It was rejected by the jury of the Salon de Paris for immorality, since it features suggestive metaphors in a scene from the poem, with a naked prostitute shown after having sex with her client, but the controversy helped Gervex&#x27;s career.

Jean Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;Eurydice&quot; (1941) employs an intertextually salient quote of Musset&#x27;s play &quot;On ne badine pas avec l&#x27;amour&quot; II.5 (1834), &quot;The Tirade of Perdican&quot; — Vincent and Eurydice&#x27;s Mother rekindle the glorious days of their earlier acting careers and their own amours, when once his on-stage performance of Perdican&#x27;s tirade instigated their first dressing-room love scene.

==Music==
Numerous (often French) composers wrote works using Musset&#x27;s poetry during the 19th and early 20th century.

; Opera

Georges Bizet&#x27;s opera &quot;Djamileh&quot; (1871, with a libretto by Louis Gallet) is based on Musset&#x27;s story &quot;Namouna&quot;. In 1872 Offenbach composed an opéra comique &quot;Fantasio&quot; with a libretto by Paul de Musset closely based on the 1834 play of the same name by his brother Alfred. Dame Ethel Smyth composed an opera based on the same work, that premiered in Weimar in 1898. The play &quot;La Coupe et les lèvres&quot; was the basis of Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s opera &quot;Edgar&quot; (1889). &quot;Fortunio&quot;, a four-act opera by André Messager is based on Musset&#x27;s 1835 comedy &quot;Le Chandelier&quot;.The libretto of Mary Rosselli Nissim’s opera &quot;Andrea del Sarto&quot; (1931) was by Antonio Lega based on writings by Musset.&quot;Les caprices de Marianne&quot;, a two-act opéra comique by Henri Sauguet (1954) is based on the play by Musset. The opera &quot;Andrea del Sarto&quot; (1968) by French composer Daniel-Lesur was based on Musset&#x27;s play &quot;André del Sarto&quot;. &quot;Lorenzaccio&quot;, which takes place in Medici&#x27;s Florence, was set to music by the musician Sylvano Bussotti in 1972.

; Song

Bizet set Musset&#x27;s poems &quot;À une fleur&quot; and &quot;Adieux à Suzon&quot; for voice and piano in 1866; the latter had previously been set by Chabrier in 1862. Pauline Viardot set Musset&#x27;s poem &quot;Madrid&quot; for voice and piano as part of her 6 Mélodies (1884). The Welsh composer Morfydd Llwyn Owen wrote song settings for Musset&#x27;s &quot;La Tristesse&quot; and &quot;Chanson de Fortunio&quot;. Lili Boulanger&#x27;s &quot;Pour les funérailles d&#x27;un soldat&quot; for baritone, mixed chorus and orchestra is a setting of several lines from Act IV of Musset&#x27;s play &quot;La Coupe et les lèvres&quot;.

; Instrumental music

Ruggero Leoncavallo&#x27;s symphonic poem &quot;La Nuit de Mai&quot; (1886) was based on Musset&#x27;s poetry. Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco&#x27;s &quot;Cielo di settembre&quot;, op. 1 for solo piano (1910) takes its name from a line of Musset&#x27;s poem &quot;A quoi rêvent les jeunes filles&quot;. The score, in the original publication, is preceded by that line, &quot;Mais vois donc quel beau ciel de septembre…&quot; Rebecca Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Viola Sonata&quot; (1919) is prefaced by two lines from Musset&#x27;s &quot;La Nuit de Mai&quot;.

; Other

Shane Briant played Alfred de Musset in one episode of a 1974 TV drama series, &quot;Notorious Woman&quot;.

In 2007, Céline Dion recorded a song called &quot;Lettre de George Sand à Alfred de Musset&quot; for her album &quot;D&#x27;elles&quot;.

==Iconography==
Musset is one of the five characters in the painting &quot;George Sand dans l&#x27;atelier de Delacroix avec Musset, Balzac et Chopin&quot; [George Sand in Delacroix&#x27;s studio with Musset, Balzac and Chopin] made by Peruvian painter Herman Braun-Vega at the request of the Museums of Châteauroux, France, in 2004, for the bicentenary of George Sand&#x27;s birth. In his commentary on the painting, Braun-Vega evokes the relationship between Musset and George Sand. The painting was exhibited for the first time in 2004-2005 at the Couvent des Cordeliers in Châteauroux, France.

<doc id="167151" wikidata="Q3181835" url="?curid=167151" title="John John Molina">
<text>Juan Molina (born March 17, 1965), better known as John John Molina in the world of boxing, is a former boxer whose career transcended boxing in Puerto Rico. A multiple time world champion, this boxer was also known as quite a socialite. Molina is a native of Fajardo, Puerto Rico.

==Amateur career==
Molina represented Puerto Rico as a Bantamweight at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games. His results were:
*1st round bye
*Defeated Jarmo Eskelinen (Finland) 5-0
*Lost to Pedro Nolasco (Dominican Republic) 2-3

Molina won the Boxing World Cup in Seoul, South Korea, November 1985, by knocking out Kelcie Banks in the finals. Upon returning to Puerto Rico, the 20-year-old youngster announced to Rafael Bracero on TV he would be ready to fight professional world Featherweight champion &quot;Victor Luvi Callejas&quot; within a year. That wasn&#x27;t to happen, however.

==Professional career==
Molina started as a professional on February 25, 1986, beating Job Walters by a decision in four. His first three fights were decisions. He won his first 14 bouts, nine of them by knockout. Among the people he beat during that span was Victor Aponte, who was a stablemate of both Alberto Mercado and Juan Carazo. Aponte got knocked out by Molina in the 10th and final round. During this period of his career, Molina received much television exposure in Puerto Rico, many of his fights being shown on TV by producer and fight commentator Ivonne Class and her &quot;Video Deportes&quot; company.

Then, he faced Lupe Suarez, losing for the first time, when he was knocked out in the ninth round. Immediately after suffering his first loss, he embarked on a five-fight win streak, including a disqualification win in four rounds over former Hector Camacho world title challenger Rafael Solis, and a knockout in eight over Miguel Medina. After those two wins, he was ranked as the number one challenger by the IBF.

On October 27, 1988, Molina was at The Arco Arena in Sacramento, to challenge the IBF super featherweight champion Tony Lopez, in what marked the beginning of a three-fight rivalry between Molina and Lopez. Molina dropped Lopez in round two, but Lopez went on to retain the title by a split decision.

In his next fight, April 29, 1989, the WBO put him and former WBC featherweight champion Juan Laporte against each other for the vacant WBO super featherweight title. Molina became a world champion by beating Laporte by a 12-round unanimous decision at Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan. 

===First major world title===
in September of 1989, he returned to Arco Arena to resume his rivalry with Lopez. Molina won the IBF belt by knocking Lopez out in the tenth round.

On January 28, 1990, he avenged his loss to Suarez by knocking him out in the sixth round to retain the belt, but then, on May 20 of that year, he and Lopez met for their rubber match, this time in Reno. Lopez dropped Molina and won a unanimous decision to recover his status as world Jr. Lightweight champion.

===Rebuilding===
Between 1990 and 1992, Molina won five straight fights, four by knockout. 

===Second title reign===
In early 1992, after Brian Mitchell (who had beaten Lopez), left the IBF title vacant due to retirement, Molina travelled to South Africa, where he met Jackie Gunguzula for the vacant world title. He knocked Gunguzula out in the fourth round to become world champion once again, and, days later, he was the object of a large welcoming at Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan. During this period of his reign, Molina made seven defenses, beating challengers like Bernard Taylor, Floyd Havard, Wilson Rodriguez, former world Featherweight champion Gregorio Vargas and future world Featherweight champion Manuel &quot;Mantecas&quot; Medina, among others.

Around then, he became quite known by the mainstream Puerto Rican public, becoming one of the first boxers ever to be portrayed on the cover of &quot;Vea&quot; magazine, and dating a famous model.

===De La Hoya vs. Molina===

Molina then moved up in weight to challenge the WBO lightweight champion Oscar De La Hoya, losing by a unanimous decision in 12 rounds in an HBO Boxing televised event.

===Latter career===
After that, Molina engaged in a series of fights against mostly lower-level opposition for the next two years, and he grew frustrated over the fact that his opposition level was being downgraded by promoters after the fight with de la Hoya. He won his next nine bouts, but the only two opponents that can probably be called respectable names in his list of opponents during that span were Jaime &quot;Rocky&quot; Balboa, beaten by decision in ten, and Isaac Cruz, beaten by a disqualification in four.

On May 9, 1998, Molina was given a second chance at a world lightweight championship, when he met IBF champion Sugar Shane Mosley, in Molina&#x27;s second HBO fight. Mosley retained the title by a knockout in the eighth round, and Molina went back to the super featherweight division.

His next fight was also for the world title, but he had to wait nine months for that fight. In February 1999, he faced IBF super featherweight champion Robert Garcia, dropping the champion in their pay per view event but losing a 12-round decision in what turned out to be his last world title fight.

Molina wasn&#x27;t done with boxing, and he went on to win seven more fights in a row, including two decision wins, one of which was televised by the USA Network over Emanuel Burton, and another one over future Kostya Tszyu world title challenger Ben Tackie, which was on the undercard of the Lennox Lewis vs. David Tua fight&#x27;s pay per view program.

His last fight was a T.K.O. loss to Mexican Juan Lazcano, Molina retired from boxing after the fight.

<text>Jerral Wayne Jones Sr. (born October 13, 1942) is an American businessman who is the owner, president, and general manager of the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL). He bought the team from Bum Bright in 1989.

Jones was born in Los Angeles, California, and moved to North Little Rock, Arkansas, as a child. His parents owned an independent grocery store. Jones was a running back at North Little Rock High School, graduating in 1960. Afterward, his family moved to Springfield, Missouri, where his father led a successful insurance company. Jones attended the University of Arkansas, co-captaining the 1964 national championship football team. Following graduation, he became an executive vice president at his family&#x27;s insurance company. After selling it, the Joneses established Buena Vista Animal Paradise.

In 1989, Jones purchased the Dallas Cowboys for $140 million, and swiftly replaced Tom Landry with Jimmy Johnson as the head coach. Under Jones, the team achieved success, winning Super Bowl XXVII, XXVIII, and XXX. Jones stands out as an NFL owner with a successful football player background. Despite initial criticism for firing beloved personnel, Jones&#x27; leadership elevated the franchise&#x27;s value to an estimated $10 billion. He played a pivotal role in securing lucrative TV deals, contributing to the NFL&#x27;s financial prosperity. Criticized for his high visibility and controversial decisions as both owner and general manager, Jones remains a polarizing figure among fans. Notably, he mended relations with Johnson in 2023, inducting him into the Cowboys Ring of Honor. Jones also influenced team relocations and faced fines from the NFL for public comments on officiating and labor issues. Inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017, Jones has been a recipient of various honors. He has an estimated net worth of $8.5 billion, mainly from his Cowboys ownership.

==Early life==
Jones was born in Los Angeles, California, to John &quot;Pat&quot; and Arminta Jones. The family moved back to North Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1945. His parents owned two branches of Pat&#x27;s Super Market in the Rose City neighborhood of North Little Rock. Jones was a running back at North Little Rock High School, graduating in 1960.

After his graduation, Jones&#x27; parents moved to Springfield, Missouri, where Pat was president and chairman of Modern Security Life Insurance Co. The company, which an advertisement billed as a &quot;one in a million&quot; company, saw its assets increase from $440,299.76 in its first statement in 1961 to $6,230,607 in 1965 ($4,643,041.96 to $62,365,606.91 in 2024). After graduating from the University of Arkansas, Jerral W. Jones was listed as an executive vice president. With the success of the company, the Joneses assembled the Buena Vista Ranch east of Springfield in Rogersville, Missouri, in the Ozark Mountains. In 1971, after selling the insurance company, the couple carved out of their ranch to start Buena Vista Animal Paradise, where tourists could visit exotic animals (now Wild Animal Safari in Strafford, Missouri, just south of Interstate 44).

===College football career===
Jones attended the University of Arkansas, where he was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity. He was co-captain of Arkansas&#x27; 1964 national championship football team. He was an offensive lineman for College Football Hall of Fame coach Frank Broyles and a teammate of college football and NFL coach Jimmy Johnson, whom Jones hired as his first head coach after purchasing the Cowboys.

Other notable teammates were Glen Ray Hines, a consensus All-American offensive tackle; Ken Hatfield, who went on to coach several major programs including Arkansas; Jim Lindsey; future Outland Trophy winner Loyd Phillips; and College Football Hall of Fame linebacker Ronnie Caveness. Several future head coaches were assistant coaches for Broyles on the Razorbacks&#x27; staff during Jones&#x27; college career in Fayetteville, including three more members of the College Football Hall of Fame: Hayden Fry (Southern Methodist University, North Texas State University, and the University of Iowa); Johnny Majors (Iowa State University, University of Pittsburgh, and the University of Tennessee), and Barry Switzer (University of Oklahoma, and later head coach of the Cowboys under Jones).

==Business ventures==
According to an interview with Jones on HBO, after graduating from college in 1965, he borrowed a million dollars from Jimmy Hoffa&#x27;s Teamsters union to open up a string of Shakey&#x27;s Pizza Parlor restaurants in Missouri. When that venture failed, Jones was given a job at his father&#x27;s insurance company, Modern Security Life of Springfield, Missouri. He received his master&#x27;s degree in business in 1970. After several other unsuccessful business ventures (including an attempt, again using Teamsters money, to purchase the American Football League&#x27;s San Diego Chargers in 1966), he began an oil and gas exploration business in Arkansas, Jones Oil and Land Lease, which became successful. His privately held company currently does natural resource prospecting.

In 2008, Jones formed a partnership with Yankee Global Enterprises to create Legends Hospitality, a food, beverage, merchandise, retail, and stadium operations corporation serving entertainment venues.
==Dallas Cowboys==
On February 25, 1989, Jones purchased the Cowboys from H. R. &quot;Bum&quot; Bright for $140 million (equivalent to $ in ). Soon after the purchase, he fired longtime coach Tom Landry, to that point the only coach in the team&#x27;s history, in favor of his old teammate at Arkansas, Jimmy Johnson. At the time Johnson was the head coach of the University of Miami Hurricanes, whom he had led to a national championship in 1987. A few months later, Jones fired longtime general manager Tex Schramm and assumed complete control over football matters.

After a slow start under Jones and Johnson (the first season under Jones, a 1–15 finish, remains second only to the team&#x27;s inaugural season in terms of futility), they quickly built a team often considered one of the best NFL franchises of the 1990s. The Cowboys won Super Bowl XXVII in the 1992 season, as well as Super Bowl XXVIII the following year. Johnson then departed and was replaced by Barry Switzer, who won Super Bowl XXX in the 1995 season.

At the time of the sale, the financially troubled Bright claimed to be losing $1 million per month on the franchise. During Jones&#x27; tenure, the Cowboys have appreciated in value to an estimated $5.5 billion, turning its owner into a billionaire in the process. Much of the league&#x27;s financial success since 1989 has been credited to Jones himself. In particular, he was decisive in securing Fox as the NFC&#x27;s primary broadcaster at a time when the traditional &quot;Big Three&quot; networks were trying to convince the league into accepting a rollback in television rights fees.

Increased television revenues have played a decisive role in securing the NFL&#x27;s place as the world&#x27;s richest sports league, with revenues of well over $1.2 billion per season.

The 2020 NFL season was Jones&#x27; 32nd as Cowboys owner, longer than the combined tenures of his predecessors.

===Criticism===

In an online poll from October 8, 2003, Jones was named the least-favorite sports personality by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, in three states (Virginia, Delaware, and Texas).

Jones is often vilified by fans who remain bitter at his unceremonious firings of longtime Cowboys personnel who were fan favorites, most notably head coach Tom Landry and personnel chief Gil Brandt, even though the Cowboys had done poorly the last few seasons before Jones became owner. Jones stated he did not give consideration to retaining Landry for even a season, as he said he would not have purchased the team unless he could hire Johnson as coach. Jones did not discuss the matter with Landry before announcing the decision. This was denounced by football fans and media as lacking class and respect. The Cowboys had long emphasized pride and tradition, and great performance and loyal service were expected to be rewarded. Since the dismissal, Jones indicated that he regrets the process of Landry&#x27;s firing and his role in it. It later emerged that Jones&#x27; predecessor, Bright, had been dissatisfied with Landry for years and offered to relieve Jones of the inevitable criticism by dismissing the longtime coach himself prior to selling the team. Bright had wanted to fire Landry as early as 1987, only to have general manager Tex Schramm tell him that there wasn&#x27;t a suitable replacement available.

Some of the fan criticism is due to Jones&#x27; high visibility and involvement as the &quot;face of the team&quot;, a contrast to both Bright and the Cowboys&#x27; original owner, Clint Murchison Jr. Jones&#x27;s prominent role has led to fans expressing displeasure with Jones and the lack of success of the franchise, with particular criticism of Jones serving as his own general manager. There was particular criticism of Jones over his conflict with head coach Jimmy Johnson, as Jones &quot;wanted Cowboys fans to know he had helped build those Super Bowl-winning teams&quot;, while &quot;Johnson insisted that he made all of the personnel moves&quot; because he had the final say in football matters and refused to relinquish this power. Consequently, Jones ousted Johnson after the 1993 season despite two consecutive Super Bowl wins, and refused to induct Johnson into the Cowboys Ring of Honor for 30 years. On November 19, 2023, Jones announced that Johnson would be inducted into the Cowboys Ring of Honor on December 30 of that year. Jones also initially promised Bill Parcells, the Cowboys&#x27; head coach from 2003 through 2006, complete control over football matters; however, their relationship broke down after Jones signed controversial wide receiver Terrell Owens. Parcells&#x27; successor, Wade Phillips, complained to friends about being &quot;undermined and second-guessed, repeatedly&quot; by Jones.

Jones and Mike Brown of the Cincinnati Bengals are the only two active NFL owners who have the title or powers of general manager. Jones stated that working as his own general manager helps streamline decision-making and communication lines with the coaching staff. Over Jones&#x27; tenure, Cowboys fans have organized a number of grassroots efforts to displace Jones from his position.

Jones is the subject of the 2008 book &quot;Playing to Win&quot; by David Magee. In the book, Jones admitted he handled the firing of Landry poorly and accepted some blame for the disintegration of his relationship with Landry&#x27;s successor, Jimmy Johnson.

Jones became involved in the St. Louis Rams move back to Los Angeles with Rams owner Stan Kroenke in 2016. He was instrumental in brokering a deal between Kroenke, San Diego Chargers owner Dean Spanos, and Oakland Raiders owner Mark Davis to ensure that Kroenke&#x27;s SoFi Stadium plan passed, which it did via a 30–2 owners&#x27; vote in favor. Jones&#x27; support and role in the negotiations were criticized by some fans and sports media in St. Louis. Jones was also a key proponent of the Oakland Raiders&#x27; move to Las Vegas to play at Allegiant Stadium.

===NFL fines===
Jones was fined $25,000 by the NFL for publicly criticizing referee Ed Hochuli after Hochuli made a call in a game between the San Diego Chargers and the Denver Broncos on September 14, 2008. Jones made comments both to the press and on his radio show, saying Hochuli was one of the most criticized officials in the NFL. This was Jones&#x27; first fine by the NFL.

In 2009, Jones was fined $100,000 for violating a gag order on labor issues, commenting that revenue sharing was &quot;on its way out&quot;. Commissioner Roger Goodell had issued a gag order for all owners and team executives from discussing any aspect of the pending labor issues. Jones &quot;crossed the line&quot;, drawing a &quot;six-figure&quot; fine, sources said, as the commissioner distributed a memo to all 32 owners, along with a reminder that the gag order remains in effect. Goodell did not disclose the specific amount of Jones&#x27;s fine in the memo.

==Jones in popular culture==
Jones was the inspiration for the character Baxter Cain (Robert Vaughn), owner of the Dallas Felons, in the 1998 film &quot;BASEketball&quot;. He had a brief cameo appearance as himself in the 1998 made-for-television reunion movie &quot;&quot;.

Jones and Deion Sanders appeared together in several television commercials during Sanders&#x27; time with the Cowboys.

Jones also appeared as himself in a 1996 episode of the TV show &quot;Coach&quot; and in a 2007 television commercial for Diet Pepsi MAX, which also featured then Cowboys head coach Wade Phillips and quarterback Tony Romo.

He appeared as himself in the seventh season of the HBO series &quot;Entourage&quot; in 2010, in an episode of the TNT incarnation of &quot;Dallas&quot; titled &quot;Truth and Consequences&quot;, which aired on July 4, 2012, in a series of commercials for the 2012 season of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, and in the season 4 premiere of &quot;The League&quot;. In 2013, Jones narrated a documentary film on former teammate and business partner Jim Lindsey.

Jones also appeared in a 2013 Pepsi commercial, walking into an elevator filled with three men wearing New York Giants apparel, who look at him with discontent.

He was parodied on the first episode, &quot;Go Fund Yourself&quot;, of the eighteenth season of &quot;South Park&quot;, along with several other NFL team owners. In one scene, Jones is depicted as having huge, bulging chameleon-like eyes, as a young woman&#x27;s head pops up from his lap. He reappears in the season 21 episode &quot;Moss Piglets.&quot;

He appeared as himself in the ninth episode of &quot;Landman&quot;, titled &quot;Wolf Camp&quot;, alongside Billy Bob Thorton and Jon Hamm.

==Personal life==
Jones married Eugenia Chambers in 1963, whom he met while both were college undergraduates. They have three children. Stephen is the Cowboys&#x27; chief operating officer, executive vice president, and director of player personnel. Charlotte is the Cowboys&#x27; executive vice president and chief brand officer. Jerry Jones Jr. is the Cowboys&#x27; chief sales and marketing officer/vice president. Jones splits his time between a home in Highland Park, Texas and a home in Destin, Florida.

Jones revealed in July 2015 at a press conference before Cowboys training camp that he had undergone hip replacement surgery, joking that he would not start the season on the PUP list.

, Jones&#x27; net worth is reported by &quot;Forbes&quot; to be $16.1 billion, the majority of which can be accounted for as being his ownership stake in the Cowboys who are currently valued by the same publication to be the world&#x27;s most valuable sports team at $10.1 billion.

In March 2022, Jones was served with legal action by a 25-year-old woman who claimed that he is her biological father. The woman is the daughter of a former airline employee that Jones met in Little Rock, Arkansas. Jones has paid nearly $3 million to the woman and her mother, which included the woman&#x27;s full tuition at Southern Methodist University and a $70,000 Range Rover on her 16th birthday. Requests for money and other expenses exceeded the amount that Jones agreed to pay in the trust agreement between the parties by nearly $1 million over the years, including $33,000 for a &quot;Sweet 16&quot; birthday party, which was featured on the reality TV show &quot;Big Rich Texas&quot;. On February 29, 2024, a court decision required Jones to undergo a paternity test concerning the woman&#x27;s claim.

In November 2022, a 1957 photo surfaced depicting a 14-year-old Jerry Jones witnessing an argument where White students attempted to prevent six African-American students from entering North Little Rock High School in Arkansas. North Little Rock was beginning to integrate in 1957. Despite the school&#x27;s head football coach ordering the team (which Jones was a part of) to stay away from such scenes, Jones said he was there as a curious bystander. Jones also stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t know that I or anybody anticipated or had a background of knowing what was involved. It was more a curious thing.&quot; Jones has expressed regret in not doing more to help the Black students feel more accepted at Little Rock.

<text>Organ transplantation is a medical procedure in which an organ is removed from one body and placed in the body of a recipient, to replace a damaged or missing organ. The donor and recipient may be at the same location, or organs may be transported from a donor site to another location. Organs and/or tissues that are transplanted within the same person&#x27;s body are called autografts. Transplants that are recently performed between two subjects of the same species are called allografts. Allografts can either be from a living or cadaveric source.

Organs that have been successfully transplanted include the heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, pancreas, intestine, thymus and uterus. Tissues include bones, tendons (both referred to as musculoskeletal grafts), corneae, skin, heart valves, nerves and veins. Worldwide, the kidneys are the most commonly transplanted organs, followed by the liver and then the heart. Corneae and musculoskeletal grafts are the most commonly transplanted tissues; these outnumber organ transplants by more than tenfold. 

Organ donors may be living, brain dead, or dead via circulatory death. Tissue may be recovered from donors who die of circulatory death, as well as of brain death – up to 24 hours past the cessation of heartbeat. Unlike organs, most tissues (with the exception of corneas) can be preserved and stored for up to five years, meaning they can be &quot;banked&quot;. Transplantation raises a number of bioethical issues, including the definition of death, when and how consent should be given for an organ to be transplanted, and payment for organs for transplantation. Other ethical issues include transplantation tourism (medical tourism) and more broadly the socio-economic context in which organ procurement or transplantation may occur. A particular problem is organ trafficking. There is also the ethical issue of not holding out false hope to patients.

Transplantation medicine is one of the most challenging and complex areas of modern medicine. Some of the key areas for medical management are the problems of transplant rejection, during which the body has an immune response to the transplanted organ, possibly leading to transplant failure and the need to immediately remove the organ from the recipient. When possible, transplant rejection can be reduced through serotyping to determine the most appropriate donor-recipient match and through the use of immunosuppressant drugs.
== Types of transplant ==

=== Autograft ===
Autografts are the transplant of tissue to the same person. Sometimes this is done with surplus tissue, tissue that can regenerate, or tissues more desperately needed elsewhere (examples include skin grafts, vein extraction for CABG, etc.). Sometimes an autograft is done to remove the tissue and then treat it or the person before returning it (examples include stem cell autograft and storing blood in advance of surgery). In a rotationplasty, a distal joint is used to replace a more proximal one; typically a foot or ankle joint is used to replace a knee joint. The person&#x27;s foot is severed and reversed, the knee removed, and the tibia joined with the femur.

=== Allograft and allotransplantation ===
An allograft is a transplant of an organ or tissue between two genetically non-identical members of the same species. Most human tissue and organ transplants are allografts. Due to the genetic difference between the organ and the recipient, the recipient&#x27;s immune system will identify the organ as foreign and attempt to destroy it, causing transplant rejection. The risk of transplant rejection can be estimated by measuring the panel-reactive antibody level.

==== Isograft ====
An isograft is a subset of allograft in which organs or tissues are transplanted from a donor to a genetically identical recipient (such as an identical twin). Isografts are differentiated from other types of transplants because while they are anatomically identical to allografts, they do not trigger an immune response.

=== Xenograft and xenotransplantation ===
A xenograft is a transplant of organs or tissue from one species to another. An example is porcine heart valve transplant, which is quite common and successful. Another example is attempted piscine–primate (fish to non-human primate) transplant of pancreatic islets. The latter research study was intended to pave the way for potential human use if successful. However, xenotransplantation is often an extremely dangerous type of transplant because of the increased risk of non-functional compatibility, rejection, and disease carried in the tissue. In the opposite direction, attempts are being made to devise a way to transplant human fetal hearts and kidneys into animals for future transplantation into human patients to address the shortage of donor organs.

=== Domino transplants ===
In people with cystic fibrosis (CF), where both lungs need to be replaced, it is a technically easier operation with a higher rate of success to replace both the heart and lungs of the recipient with those of the donor. As the recipient&#x27;s original heart is usually healthy, it can then be transplanted into a second recipient in need of a heart transplant, thus making the person with CF a living heart donor.

In a 2016 case at Stanford Medical Center, a woman who was needing a heart-lung transplant had cystic fibrosis which had led to one lung expanding and the other shrinking, thereby displacing her heart. The second patient who in turn received her heart was a woman with right ventricular dysplasia which had led to a dangerously abnormal rhythm. The dual operations required three surgical teams, including one to remove the heart and lungs from a recently deceased initial donor. The two living recipients did well and had an opportunity to meet six weeks after their simultaneous operations.

Another example of this situation occurs with a special form of liver transplant in which the recipient has familial amyloid polyneuropathy, a disease where the liver slowly produces a protein that damages other organs. The recipient&#x27;s liver can then be transplanted into an older person for whom the effects of the disease will not necessarily contribute significantly to mortality.

This term also refers to a series of living donor transplants in which one donor donates to the highest recipient on the waiting list and the transplant center utilizes that donation to facilitate multiple transplants. These other transplants are otherwise impossible due to blood type or antibody barriers to transplantation. The &quot;Good Samaritan&quot; kidney is transplanted into one of the other recipients, whose donor in turn donates his or her kidney to an unrelated recipient. This method allows all organ recipients to get a transplant even if their living donor is not a match for them. This further benefits people below any of these recipients on waiting lists, as they move closer to the top of the list for a deceased-donor organ. Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and Northwestern University&#x27;s Northwestern Memorial Hospital have received significant attention for pioneering transplants of this kind. In February 2012, the last link in a record 60-person domino chain of 30 kidney transplants was completed.

In May 2023, New York Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital performed the first domino heart transplantation in a baby, eventually saving two baby girls.

=== ABO-incompatible transplants ===
Because very young children (generally under 12 months, but often as old as 24 months) do not have a well-developed immune system, it is possible for them to receive organs from otherwise incompatible donors. This is known as ABO-incompatible (ABOi) transplantation. Graft survival and people&#x27;s mortality are approximately the same between ABOi and ABO-compatible (ABOc) recipients. While focus has been on infant heart transplants, the principles generally apply to other forms of solid organ transplantation.

The most important factors are that the recipient not have produced isohemagglutinins, and that they have low levels of T cell-independent antigens. United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) regulations allow for ABOi transplantation in children under two years of age if isohemagglutinin titers are 1:4 or below, and if there is no matching ABOc recipient. Studies have shown that the period under which a recipient may undergo ABOi transplantation may be prolonged by exposure to nonself A and B antigens. Furthermore, should the recipient (for example, type B-positive with a type AB-positive graft) require eventual retransplantation, the recipient may receive a new organ of either blood type.

Limited success has been achieved in ABO-incompatible heart transplants in adults, though this requires that the adult recipients have low levels of anti-A or anti-B antibodies. Renal transplantation is more successful, with similar long-term graft survival rates to ABOc transplants.

=== Transplantation in obese individuals ===

Until recently, people with obesity were not considered appropriate candidate donors for renal transplantation. In 2009, the physicians at the University of Illinois Medical Center performed the first robotic renal transplantation in an obese recipient and have continued to transplant people with a body mass index over 35 using robotic surgery. As of January 2014, over 100 people who would otherwise have been turned down because of their weight have successfully been transplanted.

=== Impact of Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) Reactivation on Pediatric Liver Transplantation ===
Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) reactivation emerges as a notable concern in pediatric liver transplantation, potentially influencing both graft and recipient health. HHV-6, prevalent in a substantial portion of the population, can manifest in liver transplant recipients with inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6 (iciHHV-6), predisposing them to heightened risks of complications such as graft-versus-host disease and allograft rejections. Recent case studies underscore the significance of HHV-6 reactivation, demonstrating its ability to infect liver grafts and impact recipient outcomes. Clinical management involves early detection, targeted antiviral therapy, and vigilant monitoring post-transplantation, with future research aimed at optimizing preventive measures and therapeutic interventions to mitigate the impact of HHV-6 reactivation on pediatric liver transplant outcomes.

* Pancreatic transplantation is a complex surgical procedure performed in patients with severe chronic diabetes, often in association with renal transplantation.
* Heart transplantation is increasingly performed in patients with end-stage heart failure, most often related to ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies.

== Complications ==

The main complications are procedural complications, infection, acute rejection, cardiac allograft vasculopathy and malignancy.

Non-vascular and vascular complications can occur in the initial post-transplant phase and at later stages. Overall postoperative complications after kidney transplantation occur in approximately 12% to 25% of kidney transplant patients.

Following a transplant, recipients will be given lab draws, ultrasounds, and other tests to see if the transplanted organ is being accepted.
== Types of donor ==
Organ donors may be living or may have died of brain death or circulatory death. Most deceased donors are those who have been pronounced brain dead. Brain dead means the cessation of brain function, typically after receiving an injury (either traumatic or pathological) to the brain, or otherwise cutting off blood circulation to the brain (drowning, suffocation, etc.). Breathing is maintained via artificial sources, which, in turn, maintains heartbeat. Once brain death has been declared, the person can be considered for organ donation. Criteria for brain death vary. Because less than 3% of all deaths in the US are the result of brain death, the overwhelming majority of deaths are ineligible for organ donation, resulting in severe shortages. It is important to note currently that patients that have been pronounced brain dead are one of the most common and ideal donors, since often these donors are young and healthy, thus leading to high quality organs.

Organ donation is possible after cardiac death in some situations, primarily when the person is severely brain-injured and not expected to survive without artificial breathing and mechanical support. Independent of any decision to donate, a person&#x27;s next-of-kin may decide to end artificial support. If the person is expected to expire within a short period of time after support is withdrawn, arrangements can be made to withdraw that support in an operating room to allow quick recovery of the organs after circulatory death has occurred.

Tissues may be recovered from donors who die of either brain or circulatory death. In general, tissues may be recovered from donors up to 24 hours past the cessation of heartbeat. In contrast to organs, most tissues (with the exception of corneas) can be preserved and stored for up to five years, meaning they can be &quot;banked.&quot; Also, more than 60 grafts may be obtained from a single tissue donor. Because of these three factorsthe ability to recover from a non-heart-beating donor, the ability to bank tissue, and the number of grafts available from each donortissue transplants are much more common than organ transplants. The American Association of Tissue Banks estimates that more than one million tissue transplants take place in the United States each year.

=== Living donor ===
In living donors, the donor remains alive and donates a renewable tissue, cell, or fluid (e.g., blood, skin), or donates an organ or part of an organ in which the remaining organ can regenerate or take on the workload of the rest of the organ (primarily single kidney donation, partial donation of liver, lung lobe, small bowel). Regenerative medicine may one day allow for laboratory-grown organs, using person&#x27;s own cells via stem cells, or healthy cells extracted from the failing organs.

=== Deceased donor ===
Deceased donors (formerly cadaveric) are people who have been declared brain-dead and whose organs are kept viable by ventilators or other mechanical mechanisms until they can be excised for transplantation. Apart from brainstem-dead donors, who have formed the majority of deceased donors for the last 20 years, there is increasing use of after-circulatory-death donors (formerly non-heart-beating donors) to increase the potential pool of donors as demand for transplants continues to grow. Prior to the legal recognition of brain death in the 1980s, all deceased organ donors had died of circulatory death. These organs have inferior outcomes to organs from a brain-dead donor. For instance, patients who underwent liver transplantation using donation-after-circulatory-death allografts have been shown to have significantly lower graft survival than those from donation-after-brain-death allografts due to biliary complications and primary nonfunction in liver transplantation. However, given the scarcity of suitable organs and the number of people who die waiting, any potentially suitable organ must be considered. Jurisdictions with medically assisted suicide may co-ordinate organ donations from that source.

== Allocation of organs ==
In most countries there is a shortage of suitable organs for transplantation. Countries often have formal systems in place to manage the process of determining who is an organ donor and in what order organ recipients receive available organs.

The overwhelming majority of deceased-donor organs in the United States are allocated by federal contract to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, held since it was created by the Organ Transplant Act of 1984 by the United Network for Organ Sharing, or UNOS. (UNOS does not handle donor cornea tissue; corneal donor tissue is usually handled by multiple eye banks with guidance from the Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Individual regional organ procurement organizations, all members of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, are responsible for the identification of suitable donors and collection of the donated organs. UNOS then allocates organs based on the method considered most fair by the leadership in the field. The allocation methodology varies somewhat by organ, and changes periodically. For example, liver allocation is based partially on MELD score (Model of End-Stage Liver Disease), an empirical score based on lab values indicative of the sickness of the person from liver disease. In 1984, the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA) was passed; it gave way to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, which maintains the organ registry and ensures equitable allocation of organs. The Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients was also established to conduct ongoing studies into the evaluation and clinical status of organ transplants. In 2000 the Children&#x27;s Health Act passed and required NOTA to consider special issues around pediatric patients and organ allocation.

An example of &quot;line jumping&quot; occurred in 2003 at Duke University when doctors attempted to correct an initially incorrect transplant. An American teenager received a heart-lung donation with the wrong blood type for her. She then received a second transplant even though she was then in such poor physical shape that she normally would not be considered a good candidate for a transplant.

In an April 2008 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Steven Tsui, the head of the transplant team at Papworth Hospital in the UK, is quoted in raising the ethical issue of not holding out false hope. He stated, &quot;Conventionally we would say if people&#x27;s life expectancy was a year or less we would consider them a candidate for a heart transplant. But we also have to manage expectations. If we know that in an average year we will do 30 heart transplants, there is no point putting 60 people on our waiting list, because we know half of them will die and it&#x27;s not right to give them false hope.&quot;

Experiencing somewhat increased popularity, but still very rare, is directed or targeted donation, in which the family of a deceased donor (often honoring the wishes of the deceased) requests an organ be given to a specific person, subverting the allocation system. In the United States, there are various lengths of waiting times due to the different availabilities of organs in different UNOS regions. In other countries such as the UK, only medical factors and the position on the waiting list can affect who receives the organ.

One of the more publicized cases of this type was the 1994 Chester and Patti Szuber transplant. This was the first time that a parent had received a heart donated by one of their own children. Although the decision to accept the heart from his recently killed child was not an easy decision, the Szuber family agreed that giving Patti&#x27;s heart to her father would have been something that she would have wanted.

Access to organ transplantation is one reason for the growth of medical tourism.

== Reasons for donation and ethical issues ==

=== Living related donors ===
Living related donors donate to family members or friends in whom they have an emotional investment. The risk of surgery is offset by the psychological benefit of not losing someone related to them, or not seeing them suffer the ill effects of waiting on a list.

==== Paired exchange ====

A &quot;paired-exchange&quot; is a technique of matching willing living donors to compatible recipients using serotyping. For example, a spouse may be willing to donate a kidney to their partner but cannot since there is not a biological match. The willing spouse&#x27;s kidney is donated to a matching recipient who also has an incompatible but willing spouse. The second donor must match the first recipient to complete the pair exchange. Typically the surgeries are scheduled simultaneously in case one of the donors decides to back out and the couples are kept anonymous from each other until after the transplant. Paired-donor exchange, led by work in the New England Program for Kidney Exchange as well as at Johns Hopkins University and the Ohio organ procurement organizations, may more efficiently allocate organs and lead to more transplants.

Paired exchange programs were popularized in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; article &quot;Ethics of a paired-kidney-exchange program&quot; in 1997 by L.F. Ross. It was also proposed by Felix T. Rapport in 1986 as part of his initial proposals for live-donor transplants &quot;The case for a living emotionally related international kidney donor exchange registry&quot; in &quot;Transplant Proceedings&quot;. A paired exchange is the simplest case of a much larger exchange registry program where willing donors are matched with any number of compatible recipients. Transplant exchange programs have been suggested as early as 1970: &quot;A cooperative kidney typing and exchange program.&quot;

The first pair exchange transplant in the US was in 2001 at Johns Hopkins Hospital. The first complex multihospital kidney exchange involving 12 people was performed in February 2009 by The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis and Integris Baptist Medical Center in Oklahoma City. Another 12-person multihospital kidney exchange was performed four weeks later by Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, New Jersey, Newark Beth Israel Medical Center and New York-Presbyterian Hospital. Surgical teams led by Johns Hopkins continue to pioneer this field with more complex chains of exchange, such as an eight-way multihospital kidney exchange. In December 2009, a 13 organ 13 recipient matched kidney exchange took place, coordinated through Georgetown University Hospital and Washington Hospital Center, Washington, DC.

=== Good Samaritan ===
Good Samaritan or &quot;altruistic&quot; donation is giving a donation to someone that has no prior affiliation with the donor. The idea of altruistic donation is to give with no interest of personal gain, it is out of pure selflessness. On the other hand, the current allocation system does not assess a donor&#x27;s motive, so altruistic donation is not a requirement. Some people choose to do this out of a personal need to donate. Some donate to the next person on the list; others use some method of choosing a recipient based on criteria important to them. Websites are being developed that facilitate such donation. Over half of the members of the Jesus Christians, an Australian religious group, have donated kidneys in such a fashion.

=== Financial compensation ===
Monetary compensation for organ donors, in the form of reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses, has been legalised in Australia, and strictly only in the case of kidney transplant in the case of Singapore (minimal reimbursement is offered in the case of other forms of organ harvesting by Singapore). Kidney disease organizations in both countries have expressed their support.

In compensated donation, donors get money or other compensation in exchange for their organs. This practice is common in some parts of the world, whether legal or not, and is one of the many factors driving medical tourism.

In the illegal black market the donors may not get sufficient after-operation care, the price of a kidney may be above $160,000, middlemen take most of the money, the operation is more dangerous to both the donor and receiver, and the receiver often gets hepatitis or HIV. In legal markets of Iran the price of a kidney is $2,000 to $4,000.

An article by Gary Becker and Julio Elias on &quot;Introducing Incentives in the market for Live and Cadaveric Organ Donations&quot; said that a free market could help solve the problem of a scarcity in organ transplants. Their economic modeling was able to estimate the price tag for human kidneys ($15,000) and human livers ($32,000).

In the United States, The National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 made organ sales illegal. In the United Kingdom, the Human Organ Transplants Act 1989 first made organ sales illegal, and has been superseded by the Human Tissue Act 2004. In 2007, two major European conferences recommended against the sale of organs. Recent development of websites and personal advertisements for organs among listed candidates has raised the stakes when it comes to the selling of organs, and have also sparked significant ethical debates over directed donation, &quot;good-Samaritan&quot; donation, and the current US organ allocation policy. Bioethicist Jacob M. Appel has argued that organ solicitation on billboards and the internet may actually increase the overall supply of organs.

In an experimental survey, Elias, Lacetera and Macis (2019) find that preferences for compensation for kidney donors have strong moral foundations; participants in the experiment especially reject direct payments by patients, which they find would violate principles of fairness.

Many countries have different approaches to organ donation such as the opt-out approach and many advertisements of organ donors, encouraging people to donate. Although these laws have been implemented in a certain country they are not forced upon everyone as it is an individual decision.

Two books, &quot;Kidney for Sale By Owner&quot; by Mark Cherry (Georgetown University Press, 2005) and &quot;Stakes and Kidneys: Why Markets in Human Body Parts are Morally Imperative&quot; by James Stacey Taylor:
(Ashgate Press, 2005), advocate using markets to increase the supply of organs available for transplantation.
In a 2004 journal article economist Alex Tabarrok argues that allowing organ sales, and elimination of organ donor lists will increase supply, lower costs and diminish social anxiety towards organ markets.

Iran has had a legal market for kidneys since 1988. The donor is paid approximately US$1200 by the government and also usually receives additional funds from either the recipient or local charities. &quot;The Economist&quot; and the Ayn Rand Institute approve and advocate a legal market elsewhere. They argued that if 0.06% of Americans between 19 and 65 were to sell one kidney, the national waiting list would disappear (which, the Economist wrote, happened in Iran). The Economist argued that donating kidneys is no more risky than surrogate motherhood, which can be done legally for pay in most countries.

In Pakistan, 40 percent to 50 percent of the residents of some villages have only one kidney because they have sold the other for a transplant into a wealthy person, probably from another country, said Dr. Farhat Moazam of Pakistan, at a World Health Organization conference. Pakistani donors are offered $2,500 for a kidney but receive only about half of that because middlemen take so much. In Chennai, southern India, poor fishermen and their families sold kidneys after their livelihoods were destroyed by the Indian Ocean tsunami on 26 December 2004. About 100 people, mostly women, sold their kidneys for 40,000–60,000 rupees ($900–1,350). Thilakavathy Agatheesh, 30, who sold a kidney in May 2005 for 40,000 rupees said, &quot;I used to earn some money selling fish but now the post-surgery stomach cramps prevent me from going to work.&quot; Most kidney sellers say that selling their kidney was a mistake.

In Cyprus in 2010, police closed a fertility clinic under charges of trafficking in human eggs. The Petra Clinic, as it was known locally, brought in women from Ukraine and Russia for egg harvesting and sold the genetic material to foreign fertility tourists. This sort of reproductive trafficking violates laws in the European Union. In 2010, Scott Carney reported for the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting and the magazine Fast Company explored illicit fertility networks in Spain, the United States and Israel.

=== Forced donation ===

There have been concerns that certain authorities are harvesting organs from people deemed undesirable, such as prison populations. The World Medical Association stated that prisoners and other individuals in custody are not in a position to give consent freely, and therefore their organs must not be used for transplantation.

According to former Chinese Deputy Minister of Health, Huang Jiefu, the practice of transplanting organs from executed prisoners is still occurring . World Journal reported Huang had admitted approximately 95% of all organs used for transplantation are from executed prisoners. The lack of a public organ donation program in China is used as a justification for this practice. In July 2006, the Kilgour-Matas report stated, &quot;the source of 41,500 transplants for the six-year period 2000 to 2005 is unexplained&quot; and &quot;we believe that there has been and continues today to be large scale organ seizures from unwilling Falun Gong practitioners&quot;. Investigative journalist Ethan Gutmann estimates 65,000 Falun Gong practitioners were killed for their organs from 2000 to 2008. However 2016 reports updated the death toll of the 15-year period since the persecution of Falun Gong began putting the death toll at 150,000 to 1.5 million. In December 2006, after not getting assurances from the Chinese government about allegations relating to Chinese prisoners, the two major organ transplant hospitals in Queensland, Australia stopped transplantation training for Chinese surgeons and banned joint research programs into organ transplantation with China.

In May 2008, two United Nations Special Rapporteurs reiterated their requests for &quot;the Chinese government to fully explain the allegation of taking vital organs from Falun Gong practitioners and the source of organs for the sudden increase in organ transplants that has been going on in China since the year 2000&quot;. People in other parts of the world are responding to this availability of organs, and a number of individuals (including US and Japanese citizens) have elected to travel to China or India as medical tourists to receive organ transplants which may have been sourced in what might be considered elsewhere to be unethical manner.

== Organ transplantation by region ==
Some estimates of the number of transplants performed in various regions of the world have been derived from the Global Burden of Disease Study.


According to the Council of Europe, Spain through the Spanish Transplant Organization shows the highest worldwide rate of 35.1 donors per million population in 2005 and 33.8 in 2006. In 2011, it was 35.3.

In addition to the citizens waiting for organ transplants in the US and other developed nations, there are long waiting lists in the rest of the world. More than 2 million people need organ transplants in China, 50,000 waiting in Latin America (90% of whom are waiting for kidneys), as well as thousands more in the less documented continent of Africa. Donor bases vary in developing nations.

In Latin America the donor rate is 40–100 per million per year, similar to that of developed countries. However, in Uruguay, Cuba, and Chile, 90% of organ transplants came from cadaveric donors. Cadaveric donors represent 35% of donors in Saudi Arabia. 

There is continuous effort to increase the utilization of cadaveric donors in Asia. However, the popularity of living, single kidney donors in India yields a cadaveric donor prevalence of less than 1 per million population. India has a very low donation rate, as compared to the world average, despite the fact, that it ranks third among the countries with largest transplantation activities.

Traditionally, Muslims believe body desecration in life or death to be forbidden, and thus many reject organ transplant. However most Muslim authorities nowadays accept the practice if another life will be saved. As an example, it may be assumed in countries such as Singapore with a cosmopolitan populace that includes Muslims, a special Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura governing body is formed to look after the interests of Singapore&#x27;s Muslim community over issues that includes their burial arrangements.

Organ transplantation in Singapore is generally overseen by the National Organ Transplant Unit of the Ministry of Health (Singapore). Due to a diversity in mindsets and religious viewpoints, while Muslims on this island are generally not expected to donate their organs even upon death, youth in Singapore are educated on the Human Organ Transplant Act at the age of 18, which is around the age of military conscription. The Organ Donor Registry maintains two types of information, firstly people of Singapore that donate their organs or bodies for transplantation, research or education upon their death, under the Medical (Therapy, Education and Research) Act (MTERA), and secondly people that object to the removal of kidneys, liver, heart and corneas upon death for the purpose of transplantation, under the Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA). The Live On social awareness movement is also formed to educate Singaporeans on organ donation.

Organ transplantation in China has taken place since the 1960s, and China has one of the largest transplant programmes in the world, peaking at over 13,000 transplants a year by 2004. Organ donation, however, is against Chinese tradition and culture, and involuntary organ donation is illegal under Chinese law. China&#x27;s transplant programme attracted the attention of international news media in the 1990s due to ethical concerns about the organs and tissue removed from the corpses of executed criminals being commercially traded. In 2006 it became clear that about 41,500 organs had been sourced from Falun Gong practitioners in China since 2000.

With regard to organ transplantation in Israel, there is a severe organ shortage due to religious objections by some rabbis who oppose all organ donations and others who advocate that a rabbi participate in all decision making regarding a particular donor. One-third of all heart transplants performed on Israelis are done in China; others are done in Europe. Dr. Jacob Lavee, head of the heart-transplant unit, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv, believes that &quot;transplant tourism&quot; is unethical and Israeli insurers should not pay for it. The organization HODS (Halachic Organ Donor Society) is working to increase knowledge and participation in organ donation among Jews throughout the world.

Transplantation rates also differ based on race, sex, and income. A study done with people beginning long term dialysis showed that the sociodemographic barriers to renal transplantation present themselves even before patients are on the transplant list. For example, different groups express definite interest and complete pretransplant workup at different rates. Previous efforts to create fair transplantation policies had focused on people currently on the transplantation waiting list.

In the United States, nearly 35,000 organ transplants were done in 2017, a 3.4 percent increase over 2016. About 18 percent of these were from living donors – people who gave one kidney or a part of their liver to someone else. But 115,000 Americans remain on waiting lists for organ transplants. By September 2022, the US had reached one million organ transplants overall.

== History ==
Successful human allotransplants have a relatively long history of operative skills that were present long before the necessities for post-operative survival were discovered. Rejection and the side effects of preventing rejection (especially infection and nephropathy) were, are, and may always be the key problem.

Several apocryphal accounts of transplants exist well prior to the scientific understanding and advancements that would be necessary for them to have actually occurred. The Chinese physician Pien Chi&#x27;ao reportedly exchanged hearts between a man of strong spirit but weak will with one of a man of weak spirit but strong will in an attempt to achieve balance in each man. Roman Catholic accounts report the 3rd-century saints Damian and Cosmas as replacing the gangrenous or cancerous leg of the Roman deacon Justinian with the leg of a recently deceased Ethiopian. Most accounts have the saints performing the transplant in the 4th century, many decades after their deaths; some accounts have them only instructing living surgeons who performed the procedure.

The more likely accounts of early transplants deal with skin transplantation. The first reasonable account is of the Indian surgeon Sushruta in the 2nd century BC, who used autografted skin transplantation in nose reconstruction, a rhinoplasty. Success or failure of these procedures is not well documented. Centuries later, the Italian surgeon Gasparo Tagliacozzi performed successful skin autografts; he also failed consistently with allografts, offering the first suggestion of rejection centuries before that mechanism could possibly be understood. He attributed it to the &quot;force and power of individuality&quot; in his 1596 work &quot;De Curtorum Chirurgia per Insitionem&quot;.

The first successful corneal allograft transplant was performed in 1837 in a gazelle model; the first successful human corneal transplant, a keratoplastic operation, was performed by Eduard Zirm at Olomouc Eye Clinic, now in the Czech Republic, in 1905.

The first transplant in the modern sense – the implantation of organ tissue in order to replace an organ function – was a thyroid transplant in 1883. It was performed by the Swiss surgeon and later Nobel laureate Theodor Kocher. In the preceding decades Kocher had perfected the removal of excess thyroid tissue in cases of goiter to an extent that he was able to remove the whole organ without the person dying from the operation. Kocher carried out the total removal of the organ in some cases as a measure to prevent recurrent goiter. By 1883, the surgeon noticed that the complete removal of the organ leads to a complex of particular symptoms that we today have learned to associate with a lack of thyroid hormone. Kocher reversed these symptoms by implanting thyroid tissue to these people and thus performed the first organ transplant. In the following years Kocher and other surgeons used thyroid transplantation also to treat thyroid deficiency that appeared spontaneously, without a preceding organ removal.

Thyroid transplantation became the model for a whole new therapeutic strategy: organ transplantation. After the example of the thyroid, other organs were transplanted in the decades around 1900. Some of these transplants were done in animals for purposes of research, where organ removal and transplantation became a successful strategy of investigating the function of organs. Kocher was awarded his Nobel Prize in 1909 for the discovery of the function of the thyroid gland. At the same time, organs were also transplanted for treating diseases in humans. The thyroid gland became the model for transplants of adrenal and parathyroid glands, pancreas, ovary, testicles and kidney. By 1900, the idea that one can successfully treat internal diseases by replacing a failed organ through transplantation had been generally accepted. Pioneering work in the surgical technique of transplantation was made in the early 1900s by the French surgeon Alexis Carrel, with Charles Guthrie, with the transplantation of arteries or veins. Their skillful anastomosis operations and the new suturing techniques laid the groundwork for later transplant surgery and won Carrel the 1912 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. From 1902, Carrel performed transplant experiments on dogs. Surgically successful in moving kidneys, hearts, and spleens, he was one of the first to identify the problem of rejection, which remained insurmountable for decades. The discovery of transplant immunity by the German surgeon Georg Schöne, various strategies of matching donor and recipient, and the use of different agents for immune suppression did not result in substantial improvement so that organ transplantation was largely abandoned after WWI.

In 1954, the first ever successful transplant of any organ was done at the Brigham &amp; Women&#x27;s Hospital in Boston. The surgery was performed by American surgeon Dr. Joseph Murray, who received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work. The success of this transplant was mostly due to the family relation between the recipient, a Richard Herrick of Maine, and his donor and identical twin brother Ronald. Richard Herrick was in the Navy and became severely ill with acute renal failure. His brother Ronald donated his kidney to Richard, and Richard lived on for another eight years. Prior to this case, transplant recipients did not survive for more than thirty days. Their close family relation meant there was no need for anti-rejection medications, which was not known until this time, so the case shed light on the cause of rejection and of possible anti-rejection medicine.

Major steps in skin transplantation occurred during the First World War, notably in the work of Harold Gillies at Aldershot, United Kingdom. Among his advances was the tubed pedicle graft, which maintained a flesh connection from the donor site until the graft established its own blood flow. Gillies&#x27; assistant, Archibald McIndoe, carried on the work into the Second World War as reconstructive surgery. In 1962, the first successful replantation surgery was performed – re-attaching a severed limb and restoring (limited) function and feeling.

Transplant of a single gonad (testis) from a living donor was carried out in early July 1926 in Zaječar, Serbia, by a Russian émigré surgeon Dr. Peter Vasil&#x27;evič Kolesnikov. The donor was a convicted murderer, one Ilija Krajan, whose death sentence was commuted to 20 years imprisonment, and he was led to believe that it was done because he had donated his testis to an elderly medical doctor. Both the donor and the receiver survived, but charges were brought in a court of law by the public prosecutor against Dr. Kolesnikov, not for performing the operation, but for lying to the donor.

The first attempted human deceased-donor transplant was performed by the Ukrainian surgeon Yurii Voronoy in the 1930s; but failed due to ischemia. Joseph Murray and J. Hartwell Harrison performed the first successful transplant, a kidney transplant between identical twins, in 1954, because no immunosuppression was necessary for genetically identical individuals.

In the late 1940s British surgeon Peter Medawar, working for the National Institute for Medical Research, improved the understanding of rejection. Identifying the immune reactions in 1951, Medawar suggested that immunosuppressive drugs could be used. Cortisone had been recently discovered and the more effective azathioprine was identified in 1959, but it was not until the discovery of cyclosporine in 1970 that transplant surgery found a sufficiently powerful immunosuppressive.

There was a successful deceased-donor lung transplant into an emphysema and lung cancer patient in June 1963 by James Hardy at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi. The patient John Russell survived for eighteen days before dying of kidney failure.

Thomas Starzl of Denver attempted a liver transplant in the same year, but he was not successful until 1967.

In the early 1960s and prior to long-term dialysis becoming available, Keith Reemtsma and his colleagues at Tulane University in New Orleans attempted transplants of chimpanzee kidneys into 13 human patients. Most of these patients only lived one to two months. However, in 1964, a 23-year-old woman lived for nine months and even returned to her job as a school teacher until she suddenly collapsed and died. It was assumed that she died from an acute electrolyte disturbance. At autopsy, the kidneys had not been rejected nor was there any other obvious cause of death. One source states this patient died from pneumonia. Tom Starzl and his team in Colorado used baboon kidneys with six human patients who lived one or two months, but with no longer term survivors. Others in the United States and France had limited experiences.

The heart was a major prize for transplant surgeons. But over and above rejection issues, the heart deteriorates within minutes of death, so any operation would have to be performed at great speed. The development of the heart-lung machine was also needed. Lung pioneer James Hardy was prepared to attempt a human heart transplant in 1964, but when a premature failure of comatose Boyd Rush&#x27;s heart caught Hardy with no human donor, he used a chimpanzee heart, which beat in his patient&#x27;s chest for approximately one hour and then failed. The first partial success was achieved on 3 December 1967, when Christiaan Barnard of Cape Town, South Africa, performed the world&#x27;s first human-to-human heart transplant with patient Louis Washkansky as the recipient. Washkansky survived for eighteen days amid what many saw as a distasteful publicity circus. The media interest prompted a spate of heart transplants. Over a hundred were performed in 1968–1969, but almost all the people died within 60 days. Barnard&#x27;s second patient, Philip Blaiberg, lived for 19 months.

It was the advent of cyclosporine that altered transplants from research surgery to life-saving treatment. In 1968 surgical pioneer Denton Cooley performed 17 transplants, including the first heart-lung transplant. Fourteen of his patients were dead within six months. By 1984 two-thirds of all heart transplant patients survived for five years or more. With organ transplants becoming commonplace, limited only by donors, surgeons moved on to riskier fields, including multiple-organ transplants on humans and whole-body transplant research on animals. On 9 March 1981, the first successful heart-lung transplant took place at Stanford University Hospital. The head surgeon, Bruce Reitz, credited the patient&#x27;s recovery to cyclosporine.

As the rising success rate of transplants and modern immunosuppression make transplants more common, the need for more organs has become critical. Transplants from living donors, especially relatives, have become increasingly common. Additionally, there is substantive research into xenotransplantation, or transgenic organs; although these forms of transplant are not yet being used in humans, clinical trials involving the use of specific cell types have been conducted with promising results, such as using porcine islets of Langerhans to treat type 1 diabetes. However, there are still many problems that would need to be solved before they would be feasible options in people requiring transplants.

Recently, researchers have been looking into means of reducing the general burden of immunosuppression. Common approaches include avoidance of steroids, reduced exposure to calcineurin inhibitors, increased coverance of vaccination for Vaccine-preventable disease and other means of weaning drugs based on patient outcome and function. While short-term outcomes appear promising, long-term outcomes are still unknown, and in general, reduced immunosuppression increases the risk of rejection and decreases the risk of infection. The risk of early rejection is increased if corticosteroid immunosuppression are avoided or withdrawn after renal transplantation.

Many other new drugs are under development for transplantation.
The emerging field of regenerative medicine promises to solve the problem of organ transplant rejection by regrowing organs in the lab, using person&#x27;s own cells (stem cells or healthy cells extracted from the donor site).

==Society and culture==

=== Success rates ===

Since 2000, there have been approximately 2,200 lung transplants performed each year worldwide. From 2000 to 2006, the median survival period for lung transplant patients has been 5.5 years.

=== Comparative costs ===

In China, a kidney transplant operation runs for around $70,000, liver for $160,000, and heart for $120,000.

=== Safety ===
In the United States, tissue transplants are regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which sets strict regulations on the safety of the transplants, primarily aimed at the prevention of the spread of communicable disease. Regulations include criteria for donor screening and testing as well as strict regulations on the processing and distribution of tissue grafts. Organ transplants are not regulated by the FDA. It is essential that the HLA complexes of both the donor and recipient be as closely matched as possible to prevent graft rejection.

In November 2007, the CDC reported the first-ever case of HIV and Hepatitis C being simultaneously transferred through an organ transplant. The donor was a 38-year-old male, considered &quot;high-risk&quot; by donation organizations, and his organs transmitted HIV and Hepatitis C to four organ recipients. Experts say that the reason the diseases did not show up on screening tests is probably because they were contracted within three weeks before the donor&#x27;s death, so antibodies would not have existed in high enough numbers to detect. The crisis has caused many to call for more sensitive screening tests, which could pick up antibodies sooner. Currently, the screens cannot detect the small number of antibodies produced in HIV infections within the last 90 days or Hepatitis C infections within the last 18–21 days before a donation is made.

Nucleic acid testing is now being done by many organ procurement organizations and is able to detect HIV and hepatitis C directly within seven to ten days of exposure to the virus.

=== Transplant laws ===
Both developing and developed countries have forged various policies to try to increase the safety and availability of organ transplants to their citizens. However, whilst potential recipients in developing countries may mirror their more developed counterparts in desperation, potential donors in developing countries do not. The Indian government has had difficulty tracking the flourishing organ black market in their country, but in recent times it has amended its organ transplant law to make punishment more stringent for commercial dealings in organs. It has also included new clauses in the law to support deceased organ donation, such as making it mandatory to request for organ donation in case of brain death. Other countries victimized by illegal organ trade have also implemented legislative reactions. Moldova has made international adoption illegal in fear of organ traffickers. China has made selling of organs illegal as of July 2006 and claims that all prisoner organ donors have filed consent. However, doctors in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, have accused China of abusing its high capital punishment rate. Despite these efforts, illegal organ trafficking continues to thrive and can be attributed to corruption in healthcare systems, which has been traced as high up as the doctors themselves in China and Ukraine, and the blind eye economically strained governments and health care programs must sometimes turn to organ trafficking. Some organs are also shipped to Uganda and the Netherlands. This was a main product in the triangular trade in 1934.

Starting on 1 May 2007, doctors involved in commercial trade of organs will face fines and suspensions in China. Only a few certified hospitals will be allowed to perform organ transplants in order to curb illegal transplants. Harvesting organs without donor&#x27;s consent was also deemed a crime.

On 27 June 2008, Indonesian, Sulaiman Damanik, 26, pleaded guilty in Singapore court for sale of his kidney to CK Tang&#x27;s executive chair, Tang Wee Sung, 55, for 150 million rupiah (S$22,200). The Transplant Ethics Committee must approve living donor kidney transplants. Organ trading is banned in Singapore and in many other countries to prevent the exploitation of &quot;poor and socially disadvantaged donors who are unable to make informed choices and suffer potential medical risks.&quot; Toni, 27, the other accused, donated a kidney to an Indonesian patient in March, alleging he was the patient&#x27;s adopted son, and was paid 186 million rupiah (US$20,200). Upon sentence, both would suffer each, 12 months in jail or 10,000 Singapore dollars (US$7,600) fine.

In an article appearing in the April 2004 issue of Econ Journal Watch, economist Alex Tabarrok examined the impact of direct consent laws on transplant organ availability. Tabarrok found that social pressures resisting the use of transplant organs decreased over time as the opportunity of individual decisions increased. Tabarrok concluded his study suggesting that gradual elimination of organ donation restrictions and move to a free market in organ sales will increase supply of organs and encourage broader social acceptance of organ donation as a practice.

In the United States 24 states have no law preventing discrimination against potential organ recipients based on cognitive ability, including children. A 2008 study found that of the transplant centers surveyed in those states 85 percent considered disability when deciding transplant list and forty four percent would deny an organ transplant to a child with a neurodevelopmental disability.

=== Ethical concerns ===
The existence and distribution of organ transplantation procedures in developing countries, while almost always beneficial to those receiving them, raise many ethical concerns. Both the source and method of obtaining the organ to transplant are major ethical issues to consider, as well as the notion of distributive justice. The World Health Organization argues that transplantations promote health, but the notion of &quot;transplantation tourism&quot; has the potential to violate human rights or exploit the poor, to have unintended health consequences, and to provide unequal access to services, all of which ultimately may cause harm. Regardless of the &quot;gift of life&quot;, in the context of developing countries, this might be coercive. The practice of coercion could be considered exploitative of the poor population, violating basic human rights according to Articles 3 and 4 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. There is also a powerful opposing view, that trade in organs, if properly and effectively regulated to ensure that the seller is fully informed of all the consequences of donation, is a mutually beneficial transaction between two consenting adults, and that prohibiting it would itself be a violation of Articles 3 and 29 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Even within developed countries there is concern that enthusiasm for increasing the supply of organs may trample on respect for the right to life. The question is made even more complicated by the fact that the &quot;irreversibility&quot; criterion for legal death cannot be adequately defined and can easily change with changing technology.

=== Artificial organ transplantation ===
Surgeons, notably Paolo Macchiarini, in Sweden performed the first implantation of a synthetic trachea in July 2011, for a 36-year-old patient who had cancer. Stem cells taken from the patient&#x27;s hip were treated with growth factors and incubated on a plastic replica of his natural trachea.

According to information uncovered by the Swedish documentary &quot;Dokument Inifrån: Experimenten&quot; (Swedish: &quot;Documents from the Inside: The Experiments&quot;) the patient, Andemariam went on to develop an increasingly terrible and eventually bloody cough to dying, incubated, in the hospital. At that point, determined by autopsy, 90% of the synthetic windpipe had come loose. He allegedly made several trips to see Macchiarini for his complications, and at one point had surgery again to have his synthetic windpipe replaced, but Macchiarini was notoriously difficult to get an appointment with. According to the autopsy, the old synthetic windpipe did not appear to have been replaced.

Macchiarini&#x27;s academic credentials have been called into question and he has recently been accused of alleged research misconduct.

Left ventricular assist devices are often used as a &quot;bridge&quot; to provide additional time while a patient waits for a transplant. For example, former US vice-president Dick Cheney had such a device implanted in 2010 and then 20 months later received a heart transplant in 2012. In year 2012, about 3,000 ventricular assist devices were inserted in the United States, as compared to approximately 2,500 heart transplants. The use of airbags in cars as well as greater use of helmets by bicyclists and skiers has reduced the number of persons with fatal head injuries, which is a common source of donors hearts.

==Research==

An early-stage medical laboratory and research company, called Organovo, designs and develops functional, three dimensional human tissue for medical research and therapeutic applications. The company utilizes its NovoGen MMX Bioprinter for 3D bioprinting. Organovo anticipates that the bioprinting of human tissues will accelerate the preclinical drug testing and discovery process, enabling treatments to be created more quickly and at lower cost. Additionally, Organovo has long-term expectations that this technology could be suitable for surgical therapy and transplantation.

A further area of active research is concerned with improving and assessing organs during their preservation. Various techniques have emerged which show great promise, most of which involve perfusing the organ under either hypothermic (4–10 °C) or normothermic (37 °C) conditions. All of these add additional cost and logistical complexity to the organ retrieval, preservation and transplant process, but early results suggest it may well be worth it. Hypothermic perfusion is in clinical use for transplantation of kidneys and liver whilst normothermic perfusion has been used effectively in the heart, lung, liver and, less so, in the kidney.

Another area of research being explored is the use of genetically engineered animals for transplants. Similar to human organ donors, scientists have developed a genetically engineered pig with the aim of reducing rejection to pig organs by human patients. This is currently at the basic research stage, but shows great promise in alleviating the long waiting lists for organ transplants and the number of people in need of transplants outweighs the amount of organs donated. Trials are being done to prevent the pig organ transplant to enter a clinical trial phase until the potential disease transfer from pigs to humans can be safely and satisfactorily managed (Isola &amp; Gordon, 1991).

== Negative effects of transplantation ==

In 2021, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine published a report titled &quot;Exploring the State of the Science of Solid Organ Transplantation and Disability&quot; which discussed quality of life after transplantation. In the chapter about pediatric transplantation, Nitika Gupta, Eyal Shemesh, George Mazariegos, Dorry Segev, and other researchers discuss outcomes in young transplant recipients. Pediatric intestine transplant recipients have poor long-term outcomes with 15% requiring retransplant within 5 years of receiving their first transplant and 40-60% experiencing transplant failure after 10 years.

Pediatric transplant recipients frequently have mental and behavioral problems. As many as one in three adolescent transplant recipients are nonadherenant to their medication regimens. Adolescent kidney recipients are more likely to be diagnosed with mental disorders such as depression and anxiety following transplantation, living with their parents and experiencing unemployment as adults, and having poor grades in school. They were also more likely to commit suicide and abuse substances. Dr. Clifford Chin explains his opinion that rather than being a cure, heart transplantation creates a chronic illness with a plethora of adverse side effects, such as developmental delay, limited ability to participate in everyday activities, and impaired cognitive function, which may suggest an arrested development, but hepatologist Saeed Mohammad later explains how lack of proper oxygen levels may effect intellectual ability following the transplant.

Saeed Mohammad also discussed the correlation between developmental milestones and pediatric transplantation in general. He considers pediatric transplant recipients to be chronically ill, even though the transplants cured their illnesses. He explains how children who had received transplants are often underestimated, but also points out that immunosuppressive therapy can affect brain development.

Patients who had received liver transplants between the ages of eleven and seventeen had lower survival rates than compared to those who had received liver transplants when they were under five years old, especially if they had their transplant between the ages of sixteen and seventeen. Nitika Gupta, a pediatric hepatologist, points out that teenagers&#x27; brains are still forming and developing, which can have critical effects on patients. 

It should be pointed out that the researchers refer to pediatric transplant recipients as chronically ill, special needs, and affected by chronic health conditions, though transplantation is a medical operation, rather than a diagnosable condition.

In young liver transplant recipients, nonadherence was more common in girls, patients living in single-parent homes, and patients nineteen and older.
== Myths ==
There are myths that transplantation, regardless of organ, leads to infertility, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and avoidance. In reality, females can often get pregnant, and most patients don&#x27;t experience avoidant behavior.

<text>Bophuthatswana (, ), officially the Republic of Bophuthatswana (; ), and colloquially referred to as the Bop and by outsiders as Jigsawland (In reference to its enclave-ridden borders) was a Bantustan (also known as &quot;Homeland&quot;, an area set aside for members of a specific ethnicity) that was declared (nominally) independent by the apartheid regime of South Africa in 1977. However, like the other Bantustans of Ciskei, Transkei and Venda, its independence was not recognized by any country other than South Africa.

Bophuthatswana was the second Bantustan to be declared an independent state by the Apartheid government, after Transkei. Its territory constituted a scattered patchwork of enclaves spread across what was then Cape Province, Orange Free State and Transvaal. Its seat of government was Mmabatho, which is now a suburb of Mahikeng.

On 27 April 1994, it was reintegrated into South Africa with the coming into force of the country&#x27;s interim constitution. Its territory was distributed between the new provinces of the Free State, Gauteng, Mpumalanga and North West Province.

==History==

===Establishment===

The area comprising former native reserves was set up as the only &quot;homeland&quot; for Tswana-speaking people in 1961 and administered by the Tswana Territorial Authority. It was given nominal self-rule in 1971, and elections were held the following year.

Following the 1977 elections, Chief Lucas Mangope became the first president after his Bophuthatswana Democratic Party won a majority of seats.

===Independence and international reaction===

The territory became nominally independent on 6 December 1977. Bophuthatswana&#x27;s independence was not recognized by any government other than those of South Africa and Transkei, the first homeland to gain nominal independence. In addition, it was later internally recognized by the two additional countries within the TBVC-system, Ciskei and Venda.


Arguing in favour of independence, President Mangope claimed that the move would enable its population to negotiate with South Africa from a stronger position: &quot;We would rather face the difficulties of administering a fragmented territory, the wrath of the outside world, and accusations of ill-informed people. It&#x27;s the price we are prepared to pay for being masters of our own destiny.&quot;

United Nations Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim stated that he &quot;strongly deplored&quot; the establishment of &quot;another so-called independent tribal homeland in pursuance of the discredited policies of apartheid&quot;, and in resolution A/RES/32/105N, passed on 14 December 1977, the United Nations General Assembly linked Bophuthatswana&#x27;s &quot;so-called &#x27;independence to South Africa&#x27;s &quot;stubborn pursuit&quot; of its policies, and called upon all governments to &quot;deny any form of recognition to the so-called &#x27;independent&#x27; bantustans&quot;.

During a parliamentary debate in the UK on 6 December 1977, Foreign Secretary David Owen replied in the negative when asked &quot;whether Her Majesty&#x27;s Government intend to recognise travel documents issued by the authorities of ... Bophuthatswana for the purpose of admitting visitors to the United Kingdom&quot;.

While the majority of news reports echoed these official declarations, there were others which opined that Western critics should &quot;suspend judgment for a time&quot;, and despite its generally critical stance on South Africa&#x27;s policies, &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote that Bophuthatswana had &quot;considerable economic potential&quot; with an expected $30 million a year coming from mining revenues.

Despite its official isolation, however, the government in Mmabatho managed to set up a trade mission in Tel Aviv, Israel, and conducted some business with neighbouring Botswana in an effort to sway attitudes; furthermore, Botswana agreed on &quot;informal arrangements&quot; short of official recognition in order to facilitate cross-border travel.

Bophuthatswana maintained an unofficial embassy in Israel during the 1980s, located next to the British embassy in Tel Aviv. The Israeli Foreign Ministry objected to the embassy&#x27;s presence, as Israel did not recognize Bophuthatswana as a country. The Bantustan&#x27;s president, Lucas Mangope, was nevertheless able to meet with prominent figures such as Moshe Dayan during visits to Israel.

In the 1982 elections, the Democratic Party won all 72 elected seats. It also won a large majority in the 1987 elections.

===Series of coups d&#x27;état===

On 10 February 1988, Rocky Malebane-Metsing of the People&#x27;s Progressive Party (PPP) became the president of Bophuthatswana for one day when he took over the government through a military coup. He accused Mangope of corruption and charged that the recent election had been rigged in the government&#x27;s favour. A statement by the defence force said &quot;serious and disturbing matters of great concern&quot; had emerged, citing Mangope&#x27;s close association with a multimillionaire Soviet émigré Shabtai Kalmanovich.

Subsequently, the South African Defence Force invaded Bophuthatswana and Mangope was reinstated and continued his term unabated. P. W. Botha, State President of South Africa at the time, justified the reinstatement by saying that &quot;[t]he South African Government is opposed in principle to the obtaining or maintaining of power by violence.&quot;

In 1990, a second coup attempt took place in which an estimated 50,000 protesters demanded the President&#x27;s resignation over his handling of the economy. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that seven people had been killed and 450 wounded &quot;after police officers in armoured cars fired their rifles into the crowds and used tear gas and rubber bullets&quot;.

After Mangope had asked for help from the South African government, he declared a state of emergency and cut telephone links to the territory &quot;for political reasons&quot;, claiming that &quot;normal laws had become inadequate&quot;. Human Rights Watch put the number of protesters at 150,000.

===Crisis of 1994===

In the beginning of 1994 with South Africa heading for democratic elections, President Lucas Mangope resisted the elections taking place in Bophuthatswana and opposed reincorporation of the territory into South Africa. This resulted in increasing unrest and 40 people were wounded when Bophuthatswana Defence Force troops opened fire on striking civil servants. Mangope took an increasingly hardline stance, rejected Independent Electoral Commission chairman Judge Johann Kriegler&#x27;s plea for free political activity in the territory, and fired the staff of the Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation, closing down two television stations and three radio stations.

With unrest growing and rumors of ANC supporters massing at Bophuthatswana&#x27;s borders, Mangope invited General Constand Viljoen, head of the right-wing Afrikaner Volksfront, to immediately assist in keeping the peace. The Afrikaners were hastily rallied and mobilised, including the white supremacist group Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB), which took the opportunity to move in and try to restore the apartheid status quo. Uniformed members of the AWB on an armed incursion to the Mmabatho/Mafikeng area shot at unarmed civilians blocking the road, injuring and killing many.

They themselves were shot at by members of the Bophuthatswana Defence Force (BDF) and the Police and were forced to retreat. One member of the AWB travelling back in a blue Mercedes Benz shot at some people along the road, which was then followed by members of the Bophuthatswana Police opening fire at the car. The driver, Nicolaas Fourie, and his two passengers promptly surrendered and were disarmed. After the media were allowed to photograph the badly injured prisoners, they were then executed at point-blank range by a Bophuthatswana policeman, Ontlametse Bernstein Menyatswe. These killings effectively spelt the end of white right-wing military opposition to democratic reforms.

On 12 March 1994, Mangope was deposed as President of Bophuthatswana by the South African government and the Transitional Executive Council. South African Ambassador to Bophuthatswana, Prof. Tjaart van der Walt, was then appointed as the territory&#x27;s new administrator.

===Dissolution===

With the end of apartheid after the first multi-racial elections and the coming into force of the Interim Constitution of South Africa on 27 April 1994, Bophuthatswana ceased to exist and once again became part of South Africa.

The majority of the country became part of the North West province, while the Thaba &#x27;Nchu district became part of the Free State, and the Mathanjana exclave north-east of Pretoria became part of Mpumalanga. The capital, Mmabatho, was merged with Mafikeng and the combined city is now the capital of the North-West province.
==Geography==


===Territory===

Bophuthatswana had a surface area of approximately and consisted of seven enclaves dispersed over the former South African provinces of Cape Province, Transvaal, and Orange Free State. Six of the enclaves were located relatively close together with three in the Cape Province and another three in Transvaal. The seventh enclave was in the Orange Free State between Bloemfontein and the Lesotho border.

One of the enclaves shared a border with Botswana, while two of the enclaves were located near Pretoria and its surrounding industrial areas. The townships in these enclaves, such as Ga-Rankuwa and Mabopane continued to serve as dormitory townships for the supply of labour (as they had done prior to Bophuthatswana&#x27;s independence) despite being located in Bophuthatswana territory. Other enclaves were similarly located near South African cities such as Rustenburg and Bloemfontein.

The capital, Mmabatho, was situated in the enclave bordering Botswana.

The territory and borders of the country were fluid as the South African government frequently incorporated territory into the country. As a result, when independence was declared in 1977, the country originally consisted of six enclaves but just before its reincorporation into South Africa, it had seven enclaves. Another example was the incorporation of Mafeking, which was located just outside the borders of Bophuthatswana when it gained independence in 1977, into the country in 1980 after a local referendum.

==Demographics==

The homeland was set up to house Setswana-speaking peoples. In 1983, it had more than 1,430,000 inhabitants; in 1990, it had an estimated population of 2,352,296. Only 10% of Bophuthatswana&#x27;s total land area was arable, and much of that was covered with scrub bush.

Though the majority of its population was Tswana-speaking, Tswana, English, and Afrikaans were all designated as official languages by the Constitution of Bophuthatswana.
==Economy==

Bophuthatswana was the richest of the TBVC-states as it had platinum mines, which accounted for two-thirds of the total platinum production in the Western world. It was also rich in asbestos, granite, vanadium, chromium and manganese. Additional revenues came from the Sun City casino, which was a day trip from Johannesburg and Pretoria, where gambling was illegal under the National Party government, as it was throughout all of South Africa.

Bophuthatswana also issued bearer development bonds. The so-called &quot;Bop Bonds&quot; are not recognized or redeemable in South Africa, and are now worthless as financial instruments. However, bonds in excellent condition are considered collectible. Bonds issued in 1988 and 1989, in R10 and R20 denominations, currently trade at 10–25% of original face value.

==Media==

Bophuthatswana ran a now-defunct television station called Bop TV. Bop TV was also available in some townships like Soweto, for Tswana people (who were ostensibly citizens of Bophuthatswana), but the signal was also watched by white South Africans seeking a more entertaining alternative to the SABC.

== BOP Records ==

Bophuthatswana Recording Studios, also known as BRS or BOP, was constructed in 1991 as an effort to raise the international profile of South Africa.

==Security forces==

Towards the end of its existence, the Bophuthatswana Defence Force (BDF) had an estimated number of 4,000 troops, mostly infantry. It was organized into six military regions, and its ground forces included two infantry battalions, possessing two armoured personnel carriers. The Bophuthatswana Air Force of 150 personnel possessed three combat aircraft and two armed helicopters. The president was commander-in-chief and was authorised to deploy the armed forces in both cross-border operations as well as domestically.

During its last days in 1994, the Bophuthatswana Police had 6,002 police officers, operating from 56 police stations throughout the territory.

With the dissolution of Bophuthatswana in 1994, the BDF and the Bophuthatswana Police were incorporated into the South African National Defence Force and the South African Police Service, respectively.

==Coins==

Bophuthatswana was the only Bantustan to produce its own coins. Two coins were minted as a proof set only; the South African Rand remained the official currency.

==Notable people==
List of notable former residents of Bophuthatswana includes:

* Patrice Motsepe, businessman

<text>Borkum () is an island and a municipality in the Leer District in Lower Saxony, northwestern Germany. It is situated east of Rottumeroog and west of Juist.

==Geography==
Borkum is bordered to the west by the Westerems strait (which forms the border with the Netherlands), to the east by the Osterems strait, to the north by the North Sea, and to the south by the Wadden Sea. It is the largest and westernmost of the East Frisian Islands in the North Sea, due north of the Dutch province of Groningen.

The island was formed in 1863 by two previously separate islands which were still separated by a shallow water. The seam between the former eastern and western parts is called &quot;Tüskendör&quot; (&quot;through in between&quot;).

=== Climate ===
Borkum is the only East Frisian island that is under the influence of the North Sea all year round thanks to its distance from the mainland. The maritime climate is influenced by the Gulf Stream and the west wind zone with correspondingly high humidity throughout the year. This ensures varied weather with much sun and wind but also occasional rain and showers.
Compared to the mainland, there is a climate with much milder winters and cooler summers without extremely cold or hot days. This is due to the buffering effect of the sea, which warms up slowly in spring and summer, but stores the warm temperatures longer in autumn.

==History==
Mentioned as &quot;Burchana fabaria&quot; (island of beans) by both Strabo and Pliny the Elder, Borkum by the time of Charlemagne was part of a larger island called &quot;Bant&quot;, which consisted of the present day islands of Borkum, Juist, and the western part of Norderney.

In 1484, Bant passed to the Earls of East Frisia, who developed trade, and the island became known as a centre of piracy and whaling. By 1781, violent storms in the 18th century divided Bant into three islands. As whaling decreased, the inhabitants became impoverished, and many left, with the island&#x27;s population falling from 852 in 1776 to 406 by 1811. The first tourists arrived on the island in 1834, and the local economy improved as a tourist resort.

In &quot;Mexico as I saw it&quot;, published by Thomas Nelson, Mrs Alec Tweedie, writing in 1911 about a trip of 1900 to Mexico, compares the brick roads of Monterrey with those of Borkum, &quot;the one spot on earth from which Jews are banished&quot;. This had to do with the aggressive and successful campaign of German tourists to keep Borkum free from Jewish visitors, as celebrated in the antisemitic &quot;Borkum-Lied&quot;.

In 1910, British officers Captain Bernard Frederick Trench and Lieutenant Vivian H. Brandon were imprisoned for espionage for photographing the military installations on the island.

On 19 and 20 December 1934, Wernher von Braun launched &quot;Max&quot; and &quot;Moritz&quot;, the two prototypes of the A2-rocket.

In 1944, the island was the site of the massacre of 7 American POWs. After the war, these murders were prosecuted in the Borkum Island war crimes trial.

In November 2024, the German press revealed the existence of Klaasohm festival, held every 5th of December for decades and still ongoing. This hidden festival allows packs of young men to chase women and spank them with cows&#x27; horns, sometimes causing bruises and hematomas. The festival is endorsed by the island authorities. Victims reported in the press that even minors and pregnant women are not spared.

==Transport==
The island is partially car-free. Off-season, driving by car is permitted everywhere, otherwise there are car-free zones. The only town on the island is also called Borkum. There is an airfield in the Tüskendör area. Borkum is served by ferries from Emden, Germany and Eemshaven, the Netherlands. The Borkumer Kleinbahn narrow-gauge railway connects the harbour and the town of Borkum.

<text>2002 in film is an overview of events, including the highest-grossing films, award ceremonies, festivals, a list of country- and genre- specific lists of films released, notable deaths and film debuts. Paramount Pictures and Universal Pictures celebrated their 90th anniversaries in 2002.

== Highest-grossing films ==

The top 10 films released in 2002 by worldwide gross are as follows:

2002 was the first year to see three films cross the eight-hundred-million-dollar milestone, surpassing the previous year&#x27;s record of two eight-hundred-million-dollar films. It also surpasses the previous year&#x27;s record of having the most ticket sales in a single year (fueled by the success of various sequels and the first &quot;Spider-Man&quot; movie).

== Events ==
* March 1 — Paramount Pictures reveals a new-on screen logo that was used until December 2011 to celebrate its 90th anniversary.
* May – &quot;The Pianist&quot; directed by Roman Polanski wins the &quot;Palme d&#x27;Or&quot; at the Cannes Film Festival.
* May 3–5 – &quot;Spider-Man&quot; becomes the first film to earn $100 million in one weekend. This surpassed the previous all-time opening weekend record held by &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot;, as well as the previous May opening weekend record held by &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;. The film went on to earn over $800 million worldwide, surpassing &quot;Batman&quot; to become the highest-grossing superhero film of all time and &quot;Men in Black&quot; to become Sony&#x27;s most successful film.
* May 16 – &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; opens in theaters. Although a huge success, it was the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film not to be the highest-grossing of the year.
* &quot;Amélie&quot; directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet wins the 2002 César Award for Best Film, Best Director, Best Music, and Best Art Direction. &quot;Amélie&quot; also became the highest-grossing French-language film in the United States ever.
* Another French-language film &quot;Brotherhood of the Wolf&quot; also became the second-highest-grossing French-language film in the United States in the last two decades.
