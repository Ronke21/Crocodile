<text>Porcelain (), also called china, is a ceramic material made by heating raw materials, generally including kaolinite, in a kiln to temperatures between . The greater strength and translucence of porcelain, relative to other types of pottery, arise mainly from vitrification and the formation of the mineral mullite within the body at these high temperatures. End applications include tableware, decorative ware such as figurines, and products in technology and industry such as electrical insulators and laboratory ware.

The manufacturing process used for porcelain is similar to that used for earthenware and stoneware, the two other main types of pottery, although it can be more challenging to produce. It has usually been regarded as the most prestigious type of pottery due to its delicacy, strength, and high degree of whiteness. It is frequently both glazed and decorated.

Though definitions vary, porcelain can be divided into three main categories: hard-paste, soft-paste, and bone china. The categories differ in the composition of the body and the firing conditions.

Porcelain slowly evolved in China and was finally achieved (depending on the definition used) at some point about 2,000 to 1,200 years ago. It slowly spread to other East Asian countries, then to Europe, and eventually to the rest of the world. The European name, porcelain in English, comes from the old Italian &quot;porcellana&quot; (cowrie shell) because of its resemblance to the surface of the shell. Porcelain is also referred to as &quot;china&quot; or fine china in some English-speaking countries, as it was first seen in imports from China during the 17th century. Properties associated with porcelain include low permeability and elasticity; considerable strength, hardness, whiteness, translucency, and resonance; and a high resistance to corrosive chemicals and thermal shock.


Porcelain has been described as being &quot;completely vitrified, hard, impermeable (even before glazing), white or artificially coloured, translucent (except when of considerable thickness), and resonant&quot;. However, the term &quot;porcelain&quot; lacks a universal definition and has &quot;been applied in an unsystematic fashion to substances of diverse kinds that have only certain surface-qualities in common&quot;.

Traditionally, East Asia only classifies pottery into low-fired wares (earthenware) and high-fired wares (often translated as porcelain), the latter also including what Europeans call &quot;stoneware&quot;, which is high-fired but not generally white or translucent. Terms such as &quot;proto-porcelain&quot;, &quot;porcellaneous&quot;, or &quot;near-porcelain&quot; may be used in cases where the ceramic body approaches whiteness and translucency.

In 2021, the global market for porcelain tableware was estimated to be worth US$22.1 billion.

== Types ==

=== Hard paste ===
Hard-paste porcelain was invented in China, and it was also used in Japanese porcelain. Most of the finest quality porcelain wares are made of this material. The earliest European porcelains were produced at the Meissen factory in the early 18th century; they were formed from a paste composed of kaolin and alabaster and fired at temperatures up to in a wood-fired kiln, producing a porcelain of great hardness, translucency, and strength. Later, the composition of the Meissen hard paste was changed, and the alabaster was replaced by feldspar and quartz, allowing the pieces to be fired at lower temperatures. Kaolinite, feldspar, and quartz (or other forms of silica) continue to constitute the basic ingredients for most continental European hard-paste porcelains.

=== Soft paste ===

Soft-paste porcelains date back to early attempts by European potters to replicate Chinese porcelain by using mixtures of clay and frit. Soapstone and lime are known to have been included in these compositions. These wares were not yet actual porcelain wares, as they were neither hard nor vitrified by firing kaolin clay at high temperatures. As these early formulations suffered from high pyroplastic deformation, or slumping in the kiln at high temperatures, they were uneconomic to produce and of low quality.

Formulations were later developed based on kaolin with quartz, feldspars, nepheline syenite, or other feldspathic rocks. These are technically superior and continue to be produced. Soft-paste porcelains are fired at lower temperatures than hard-paste porcelains; therefore, these wares are generally less hard than hard-paste porcelains.

=== Bone china ===

Although originally developed in England in 1748 to compete with imported porcelain, bone china is now made worldwide, including in China. The English had read the letters of Jesuit missionary François Xavier d&#x27;Entrecolles, which described Chinese porcelain manufacturing secrets in detail. One writer has speculated that a misunderstanding of the text could possibly have been responsible for the first attempts to use bone-ash as an ingredient in English porcelain, although this is not supported by modern researchers and historians.

Traditionally, English bone china was made from two parts of bone ash, one part of kaolin, and one part of china stone, although the latter has been replaced by feldspars from non-UK sources.

== Materials ==

Kaolin is the primary material from which porcelain is made, even though clay minerals might account for only a small proportion of the whole. The word &quot;paste&quot; is an old term for both unfired and fired materials. A more common terminology for the unfired material is &quot;body&quot;; for example, when buying materials a potter might order an amount of porcelain body from a vendor.

The composition of porcelain is highly variable, but the clay mineral kaolinite is often a raw material. Other raw materials can include feldspar, ball clay, glass, bone ash, steatite, quartz, petuntse and alabaster.

The clays used are often described as being long or short, depending on their plasticity. Long clays are cohesive (sticky) and have high plasticity; short clays are less cohesive and have lower plasticity. In soil mechanics, plasticity is determined by measuring the increase in content of water required to change a clay from a solid state bordering on the plastic, to a plastic state bordering on the liquid, though the term is also used less formally to describe the ease with which a clay may be worked.

Clays used for porcelain are generally of lower plasticity than many other pottery clays. They wet very quickly, meaning that small changes in the content of water can produce large changes in workability. Thus, the range of water content within which these clays can be worked is very narrow and consequently must be carefully controlled.

== Production ==
=== Forming ===
Porcelain can be made using all the shaping techniques for pottery.

=== Glazing ===
Biscuit porcelain is unglazed porcelain treated as a finished product, mostly for figures and sculpture. Unlike their lower-fired counterparts, porcelain wares do not need glazing to render them impermeable to liquids and for the most part are glazed for decorative purposes and to make them resistant to dirt and staining. Many types of glaze, such as the iron-containing glaze used on the celadon wares of Longquan, were designed specifically for their striking effects on porcelain.

=== Decoration ===

Porcelain often receives underglaze decoration using pigments that include cobalt oxide and copper, or overglaze enamels, allowing a wider range of colours. Like many earlier wares, modern porcelains are often biscuit-fired at around , coated with glaze and then sent for a second glaze-firing at a temperature of about or greater. Another early method is &quot;once-fired&quot;, where the glaze is applied to the unfired body and the two fired together in a single operation.

=== Firing ===
In this process, &quot;green&quot; (unfired) ceramic wares are heated to high temperatures in a kiln to permanently set their shapes, vitrify the body and the glaze. Porcelain is fired at a higher temperature than earthenware so that the body can vitrify and become non-porous. Many types of porcelain in the past have been fired twice or even three times, to allow decoration using less robust pigments in overglaze enamel.

== History ==

=== Chinese porcelain ===
Porcelain was invented in China over a centuries-long development period beginning with &quot;proto-porcelain&quot; wares dating from the Shang dynasty (1600–1046 BCE). By the time of the Eastern Han dynasty (25–220 CE) these early glazed ceramic wares had developed into porcelain, which Chinese defined as high-fired ware. By the late Sui dynasty (581–618 CE) and early Tang dynasty (618–907 CE), the now-standard requirements of whiteness and translucency had been achieved, in types such as Ding ware. The wares were already exported to the Islamic world, where they were highly prized.

Eventually, porcelain and the expertise required to create it began to spread into other areas of East Asia. During the Song dynasty (960–1279 CE), artistry and production had reached new heights. The manufacture of porcelain became highly organised, and the dragon kilns excavated from this period could fire as many as 25,000 pieces at a time, and over 100,000 by the end of the period. While Xing ware is regarded as among the greatest of the Tang dynasty porcelain, Ding ware became the premier porcelain of the Song dynasty. By the Ming dynasty, production of the finest wares for the court was concentrated in a single city, and Jingdezhen porcelain, originally owned by the imperial government, remains the centre of Chinese porcelain production.

By the time of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 CE), porcelain wares were being exported to Asia and Europe. Some of the most well-known Chinese porcelain art styles arrived in Europe during this era, such as the coveted &quot;blue-and-white&quot; wares. The Ming dynasty controlled much of the porcelain trade, which was expanded to Asia, Africa and Europe via the Silk Road. In 1517, Portuguese merchants began direct trade by sea with the Ming dynasty, and in 1598, Dutch merchants followed.

Some porcelains were more highly valued than others in imperial China. The most valued types can be identified by their association with the court, either as tribute offerings, or as products of kilns under imperial supervision. Since the Yuan dynasty, the largest and best centre of production has made Jingdezhen porcelain. During the Ming dynasty, Jingdezhen porcelain had become a source of imperial pride. The Yongle emperor erected a white porcelain brick-faced pagoda at Nanjing, and an exceptionally smoothly glazed type of white porcelain is peculiar to his reign. Jingdezhen porcelain&#x27;s fame came to a peak during the Qing dynasty.

=== Japanese porcelain ===

Although the Japanese elite were keen importers of Chinese porcelain from early on, they were not able to make their own until the arrival of Korean potters that were taken captive during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598). They brought an improved type of kiln, and one of them spotted a source of porcelain clay near Arita, and before long several kilns had started in the region. At first their wares were similar to the cheaper and cruder Chinese porcelains with underglaze blue decoration that were already widely sold in Japan; this style was to continue for cheaper everyday wares until the 20th century.
Exports to Europe began around 1660, through the Chinese and the Dutch East India Company, the only Europeans allowed a trading presence. Chinese exports had been seriously disrupted by civil wars as the Ming dynasty fell apart, and the Japanese exports increased rapidly to fill the gap. At first the wares used European shapes and mostly Chinese decoration, as the Chinese had done, but gradually original Japanese styles developed.

Nabeshima ware was produced in kilns owned by the families of feudal lords, and were decorated in the Japanese tradition, much of it related to textile design. This was not initially exported, but used for gifts to other aristocratic families. Imari ware and Kakiemon are broad terms for styles of export porcelain with overglaze &quot;enamelled&quot; decoration begun in the early period, both with many sub-types.
A great range of styles and manufacturing centres were in use by the start of the 19th century, and as Japan opened to trade in the second half, exports expanded hugely and quality generally declined. Much traditional porcelain continues to replicate older methods of production and styles, and there are several modern industrial manufacturers. By the early 1900s, Filipino porcelain artisans working in Japanese porcelain centres for much of their lives, later on introduced the craft into the native population in the Philippines, although oral literature from Cebu in the central Philippines have noted that porcelain were already being produced by the natives locally during the time of Cebu&#x27;s early rulers, prior to the arrival of colonizers in the 16th century.

=== Korean porcelain ===

Olive green glaze was introduced in the late Silla Dynasty. Most ceramics from Silla are generally leaf-shaped, which is a very common shape in Korea. Korean celadon comes in a variety of colors, from turquoise to putty. Additionally, in the late 13th century, the Inlay technique of expressing pigmented patterns by filling the hollow parts of pottery with white and red clay was frequently used. The main difference from those in China is that many specimens have inlay decoration under the glaze.
Most Korean ceramics from the Joseon Dynasty (1
-1910) are of excellent decorative quality. It usually has a melon shape and is asymmetrical.

=== European porcelain ===

Imported Chinese porcelains were held in such great esteem in Europe that in English &quot;&quot; became a commonly used synonym for the Italian-derived &quot;porcelain&quot;. The first mention of porcelain in Europe is in &quot;Il Milione&quot; by Marco Polo in the 13th century. Apart from copying Chinese porcelain in &quot;faience&quot; (tin glazed earthenware), the soft-paste Medici porcelain in 16th-century Florence was the first real European attempt to reproduce it, with little success.

Early in the 16th century, Portuguese traders returned home with samples of kaolin, which they discovered in China to be essential in the production of porcelain wares. However, the Chinese techniques and composition used to manufacture porcelain were not yet fully understood. Countless experiments to produce porcelain had unpredictable results and met with failure. In the German state of Saxony, the search concluded in 1708 when Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus produced a hard, white, translucent type of porcelain specimen with a combination of ingredients, including kaolin and alabaster, mined from a Saxon mine in Colditz. It was a closely guarded trade secret of the Saxon enterprise.

In 1712, many of the elaborate Chinese porcelain manufacturing secrets were revealed throughout Europe by the French Jesuit father Francois Xavier d&#x27;Entrecolles and soon published in the &quot;Lettres édifiantes et curieuses de Chine par des missionnaires jésuites&quot;. The secrets, which d&#x27;Entrecolles read about and witnessed in China, were now known and began seeing use in Europe.

==== Meissen ====

Von Tschirnhaus along with Johann Friedrich Böttger were employed by Augustus II, King of Poland and Elector of Saxony, who sponsored their work in Dresden and in the town of Meissen. Tschirnhaus had a wide knowledge of science and had been involved in the European quest to perfect porcelain manufacture when, in 1705, Böttger was appointed to assist him in this task. Böttger had originally been trained as a pharmacist; after he turned to alchemical research, he claimed to have known the secret of transmuting dross into gold, which attracted the attention of Augustus. Imprisoned by Augustus as an incentive to hasten his research, Böttger was obliged to work with other alchemists in the futile search for transmutation and was eventually assigned to assist Tschirnhaus. One of the first results of the collaboration between the two was the development of a red stoneware that resembled that of Yixing.

A workshop note records that the first specimen of hard, white and vitrified European porcelain was produced in 1708. At the time, the research was still being supervised by Tschirnhaus; however, he died in October of that year. It was left to Böttger to report to Augustus in March 1709 that he could make porcelain. For this reason, credit for the European discovery of porcelain is traditionally ascribed to him rather than Tschirnhaus.

The Meissen factory was established in 1710 after the development of a kiln and a glaze suitable for use with Böttger&#x27;s porcelain, which required firing at temperatures of up to to achieve translucence. Meissen porcelain was &quot;once-fired&quot;, or &quot;green-fired&quot;. It was noted for its great resistance to thermal shock; a visitor to the factory in Böttger&#x27;s time reported having seen a white-hot teapot being removed from the kiln and dropped into cold water without damage. Although widely disbelieved this has been replicated in modern times.

==== Russian porcelain ====
In 1744, Elizabeth of Russia signed an agreement to establish the first porcelain manufactory; previously it had to be imported. The technology of making &quot;white gold&quot; was carefully hidden by its creators. Peter the Great had tried to reveal the &quot;big porcelain secret&quot;, and sent an agent to the Meissen factory, and finally hired a porcelain master from abroad. This relied on the research of the Russian scientist Dmitry Ivanovich Vinogradov. His development of porcelain manufacturing technology was not based on secrets learned through third parties, but was the result of painstaking work and careful analysis. Thanks to this, by 1760, Imperial Porcelain Factory, Saint Petersburg became a major European factories producing tableware, and later porcelain figurines. Eventually other factories opened: Gardner porcelain, Dulyovo (1832), Kuznetsovsky porcelain, Popovsky porcelain, and Gzhel.

During the twentieth century, under Soviet governments, ceramics continued to be a popular artform, supported by the state, with an increasingly propagandist role. One artist, who worked at the Baranovsky Porcelain Factory and at the Experimental Ceramic and Artistic Plant in Kyiv, was Oksana Zhnikrup, whose porcelain figures of the ballet and the circus were widely known.

==== Soft paste porcelain ====

The pastes produced by combining clay and powdered glass (frit) were called &quot;Frittenporzellan&quot; in Germany and &quot;frita&quot; in Spain. In France they were known as &quot;pâte tendre&quot; and in England as &quot;soft-paste&quot;. They appear to have been given this name because they do not easily retain their shape in the wet state, or because they tend to slump in the kiln under high temperature, or because the body and the glaze can be easily scratched.

;France
Experiments at Rouen produced the earliest soft-paste in France, but the first important French soft-paste porcelain was made at the Saint-Cloud factory before 1702. Soft-paste factories were established with the Chantilly manufactory in 1730 and at Mennecy in 1750. The Vincennes porcelain factory was established in 1740, moving to larger premises at Sèvres in 1756. Vincennes soft-paste was whiter and freer of imperfections than any of its French rivals, which put Vincennes/Sèvres porcelain in the leading position in France and throughout the whole of Europe in the second half of the 18th century.

;Italy
Doccia porcelain of Florence was founded in 1735 and remains in production, unlike Capodimonte porcelain which was moved from Naples to Madrid by its royal owner, after producing from 1743 to 1759. After a gap of 15 years Naples porcelain was produced from 1771 to 1806, specializing in Neoclassical styles. All these were very successful, with large outputs of high-quality wares. In and around Venice, Francesco Vezzi was producing hard-paste from around 1720 to 1735; survivals of Vezzi porcelain are very rare, but less so than from the Hewelke factory, which only lasted from 1758 to 1763. The soft-paste Cozzi factory fared better, lasting from 1764 to 1812. The Le Nove factory produced from about 1752 to 1773, then was revived from 1781 to 1802.

; England
The first soft-paste in England was demonstrated by Thomas Briand to the Royal Society in 1742 and is believed to have been based on the Saint-Cloud formula. In 1749, Thomas Frye took out a patent on a porcelain containing bone ash. This was the first bone china, subsequently perfected by Josiah Spode. William Cookworthy discovered deposits of kaolin in Cornwall, and his factory at Plymouth, established in 1768, used kaolin and china stone to make hard-paste porcelain with a body composition similar to that of the Chinese porcelains of the early 18th century. But the great success of English ceramics in the 18th century was based on soft-paste porcelain, and refined earthenwares such as creamware, which could compete with porcelain, and had devastated the faience industries of France and other continental countries by the end of the century. Most English porcelain from the late 18th century to the present is bone china.

In the twenty-five years after Briand&#x27;s demonstration, a number of factories were founded in England to make soft-paste tableware and figures:
* Chelsea (1743)
* Bow (1745)
* St James&#x27;s (1748)
* Bristol porcelain (1748)
* Longton Hall (1750)
* Royal Crown Derby (1750 or 1757)
* Royal Worcester (1751)
* Lowestoft porcelain (1757)
* Wedgwood (1759)
* Spode (1767)

== Applications other than decorative and tableware ==

=== Electric insulators ===

Porcelain has been used for electrical insulators since at least 1878, with another source reporting earlier use of porcelain insulators on the telegraph line between Frankfurt and Berlin. It is widely used for insulators in electrical power transmission system due to its high stability of electrical, mechanical and thermal properties even in harsh environments.

A body for electrical porcelain typically contains varying proportions of ball clay, kaolin, feldspar, quartz, calcined alumina and calcined bauxite. A variety of secondary materials can also be used, such as binders which burn off during firing. UK manufacturers typically fired the porcelain to a maximum of 1200 °C in an oxidising atmosphere, whereas reduction firing is standard practice at Chinese manufacturers.

In 2018, a porcelain bushing insulator manufactured by NGK in Handa, Aichi Prefecture, Japan was certified as the world&#x27;s largest ceramic structure by Guinness World Records. It is 11.3 m in height and 1.5 m in diameter.

The global market for high-voltage insulators was estimated to be worth US$4.95 billion in 2015, of which porcelain accounts for just over 48%.

=== Chemical porcelain ===

A type of porcelain characterised by low thermal expansion, high mechanical strength and high chemical resistance. Used for laboratory ware, such as reaction vessels, combustion boats, evaporating dishes and Büchner funnels. Raw materials for the body include kaolin, quartz, feldspar, calcined alumina, and possibly also low percentages of other materials. A number of International standards specify the properties of the porcelain, such as ASTM C515.

=== Tiles ===

A porcelain tile has been defined as &#x27;a ceramic mosaic tile or paver that is generally made by the dust-pressed method of a composition resulting in a tile that is dense, fine-grained, and smooth with sharply formed face, usually impervious and having colors of the porcelain type which are usually of a clear, luminous type or granular blend thereof.&#x27; Manufacturers are found across the world with Italy being the global leader, producing over 380 million square metres in 2006.

Historic examples of rooms decorated entirely in porcelain tiles can be found in several palaces including ones at Galleria Sabauda in Turin, Museo di Doccia in Sesto Fiorentino, Museo di Capodimonte in Naples, the Royal Palace of Madrid and the nearby Royal Palace of Aranjuez. and the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing. More recent examples include the Dakin Building in Brisbane, California and the Gulf Building in Houston, Texas, which when constructed in 1929 had a porcelain logo on its exterior.

=== Sanitaryware ===

Because of its durability, inability to rust and impermeability, glazed porcelain has been in use for personal hygiene since at least the third quarter of the 17th century. During this period, porcelain chamber pots were commonly found in higher-class European households, and the term &quot;bourdaloue&quot; was used as the name for the pot.

Whilst modern sanitaryware, such as closets and washbasins, is made of ceramic materials, porcelain is no longer used and vitreous china is the dominant material. Bath tubs are not made of porcelain, but of enamel on a metal base, usually of cast iron. Porcelain enamel is a marketing term used in the US, and is not porcelain but vitreous enamel.

=== Dental porcelain ===

Dental porcelain is used for crowns, bridges and veneers. A formulation of dental porcelain is 70-85% feldspar, 12-25% quartz, 3-5% kaolin, up to 15% glass and around 1% colourants.

<text>The Blackfoot Confederacy, Niitsitapi, or Siksikaitsitapi (ᖹᐟᒧᐧᒣᑯ, meaning &quot;the people&quot; or &quot;Blackfoot-speaking real people&quot;), is a historic collective name for linguistically related groups that make up the Blackfoot or Blackfeet people: the &quot;Siksika&quot; (&quot;Blackfoot&quot;), the &quot;Kainai or Blood&quot; (&quot;Many Chiefs&quot;), and two sections of the Peigan or Piikani (&quot;Splotchy Robe&quot;) – the Northern Piikani (&quot;Aapátohsipikáni&quot;) and the Southern Piikani (&quot;Amskapi Piikani&quot; or &quot;Pikuni&quot;). Broader definitions include groups such as the &quot;Tsúùtínà&quot; (Sarcee) and &quot;A&#x27;aninin&quot; (Gros Ventre) who spoke quite different languages but allied with or joined the Blackfoot Confederacy.

Historically, the member peoples of the Confederacy were nomadic bison hunters and trout fishermen, who ranged across large areas of the northern Great Plains of western North America, specifically the semi-arid shortgrass prairie ecological region. They followed the bison herds as they migrated between what are now the United States and Canada, as far north as the Bow River. In the first half of the 18th century, they acquired horses and firearms from white traders and their Cree and Assiniboine go-betweens. The Blackfoot used these to expand their territory at the expense of neighboring tribes.

Today, three Blackfoot First Nation band governments (the Siksika, Kainai, and Piikani Nations) reside in the Canadian province of Alberta, while the Blackfeet Nation is a federally recognized Native American tribe of Southern Piikani in Montana, United States. Additionally, the Gros Ventre are members of the federally recognized Fort Belknap Indian Community of the Fort Belknap Reservation of Montana in the United States and the Tsuutʼina Nation is a First Nation band government in Alberta, Canada.

== Government ==

The four Blackfoot nations come together to make up what is known as the Blackfoot Confederacy, meaning that they have banded together to help one another. The nations have their own separate governments ruled by a head chief, but regularly come together for religious and social celebrations.

Originally the Blackfoot/Plains Confederacy consisted of three peoples (&quot;nation&quot;, &quot;tribes&quot;, &quot;tribal nations&quot;) based on kinship and dialect, but all speaking the common language of Blackfoot, one of the Algonquian languages family. The three were the &quot;Piikáni&quot; (historically called &quot;Piegan Blackfeet&quot; in English-language sources), the &quot;Káínaa&quot; (called &quot;Bloods&quot;), and the &quot;Siksikáwa&quot; (&quot;Blackfoot&quot;). They later allied with the unrelated &quot;Tsuu T&#x27;ina&quot; (&quot;Sarcee&quot;), who became merged into the Confederacy and, (for a time) with the &quot;Atsina,&quot; or A&#x27;aninin (&quot;Gros Ventre&quot;).

Each of these highly decentralized peoples were divided into many bands, which ranged in size from 10 to 30 lodges, or about 80 to 240 persons. The band was the basic unit of organization for hunting and defence.

The Confederacy occupied a large territory where they hunted and foraged; in the 19th century it was divided by the current Canada–US international border. But during the late nineteenth century, both governments forced the peoples to end their nomadic traditions and settle on &quot;Indian reserves&quot; (Canadian terminology) or &quot;Indian reservations&quot; (US terminology). The South Peigan are the only group who chose to settle in Montana. The other three Blackfoot-speaking peoples and the Sarcee are located in Alberta. Together, the Blackfoot-speakers call themselves the &quot;Niitsítapi&quot; (the &quot;Original People&quot;). After leaving the Confederacy, the Gros Ventres also settled on a reservation in Montana.

When these peoples were forced to end their nomadic traditions, their social structures changed. Tribal nations, which had formerly been mostly ethnic associations, were institutionalized as governments (referred to as &quot;tribes&quot; in the United States and &quot;bands&quot; or &quot;First Nations&quot; in Canada). The Piegan were divided into the North Peigan in Alberta, and the South Peigan in Montana.

==History==
The Confederacy had a territory that stretched from the North Saskatchewan River (called &quot;Ponoká&#x27;sisaahta&quot;) along what is now Edmonton, Alberta, in Canada, to the Yellowstone River (called &quot;Otahkoiitahtayi&quot;) of Montana in the United States, and from the Rocky Mountains (called &quot;Miistakistsi&quot;) and along the South Saskatchewan River to the present Alberta-Saskatchewan border (called &quot;Kaayihkimikoyi&quot;), east past the Cypress Hills. They called their tribal territory &quot;Niitsitpiis-stahkoii&quot; (ᖹᐟᒧᐧᐨᑯᐧ ᓴᐦᖾᐟ)- &quot;Original People
s Land.&quot; To the east, the Innu and Naskapi called their territory &quot;Nitassinan&quot; – &quot;Our Land.&quot; They had adopted the use of the horse from other Plains tribes, probably by the early eighteenth century, which gave them expanded range and mobility, as well as advantages in hunting.

The basic social unit of the &quot;Niitsitapi&quot; above the family was the band, varying from about 10 to 30 lodges, about 80 to 241 people. This size group was large enough to defend against attack and to undertake communal hunts, but was also small enough for flexibility. Each band consisted of a respected leader , possibly his brothers and parents, and others who were not related. Since the band was defined by place of residence, rather than by kinship, a person was free to leave one band and join another, which tended to ameliorate leadership disputes. Also, should a band fall upon hard times, its members could split up and join other bands. In practice, bands were constantly forming and breaking up. The system maximized flexibility and was an ideal organization for a hunting people on the northwestern Great Plains.
During the summer, the people assembled for nation gatherings. In these large assemblies, warrior societies played an important role for the men. Membership into these societies was based on brave acts and deeds.

For almost half the year in the long northern winter, the Niitsitapi lived in their winter camps along a wooded river valley. They were located perhaps a day&#x27;s march apart, not moving camp unless food for the people and horses, or firewood became depleted. Where there was adequate wood and game resources, some bands would camp together. During this part of the year, buffalo also wintered in wooded areas, where they were partially sheltered from storms and snow. They were easier prey as their movements were hampered. In spring the buffalo moved out onto the grasslands to forage on new spring growth. The Blackfoot did not follow immediately, for fear of late blizzards. As dried food or game became depleted, the bands would split up and begin to hunt the buffalo.

In midsummer, when the chokecherries ripened, the people regrouped for their major ceremony, the &quot;Okan&quot; (Sun Dance). This was the only time of year when the four nations would assemble. The gathering reinforced the bonds among the various groups and linked individuals with the nations. Communal buffalo hunts provided food for the people, as well as offerings of the bulls&#x27; tongues (a delicacy) for the ceremonies. These ceremonies are sacred to the people. After the &quot;Okan&quot;, the people again separated to follow the buffalo. They used the buffalo hides to make their dwellings and temporary tipis.

In the fall, the people would gradually shift to their wintering areas. The men would prepare the buffalo jumps and pounds for capturing or driving the bison for hunting. Several groups of people might join at particularly good sites, such as Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump. As the buffalo were naturally driven into the area by the gradual late summer drying off of the open grasslands, the Blackfoot would carry out great communal buffalo kills.

The women processed the buffalo, preparing dried meat, and combining it for nutrition and flavor with dried fruits into pemmican, to last them through winter and other times when hunting was poor. At the end of the fall, the Blackfoot would move to their winter camps. The women worked the buffalo and other game skins for clothing, as well as to reinforce their dwellings; other elements were used to make warm fur robes, leggings, cords and other needed items. Animal sinews were used to tie arrow points and lances to throwing sticks, or for bridles for horses.

The Niitsitapi maintained this traditional way of life based on hunting bison, until the near extirpation of the bison by 1881 forced them to adapt their ways of life in response to the encroachment of the European settlers and their descendants. In the United States, they were restricted to land assigned in the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851. Nearly three decades later, they were given a distinct reservation in the Sweetgrass Hills Treaty of 1887. In 1877, the Canadian Niitsitapi signed Treaty 7 and settled on reserves in southern Alberta.

This began a period of great struggle and economic hardship; the Niitsitapi had to try to adapt to a completely new way of life. They suffered a high rate of fatalities when exposed to Eurasian diseases, for which they had no natural immunity.

Eventually, they established a viable economy based on farming, ranching, and light industry. Their population has increased to about 16,000 in Canada and 15,000 in the U.S. today. With their new economic stability, the Niitsitapi have been free to adapt their culture and traditions to their new circumstances, renewing their connection to their ancient roots.

=== Early history ===
The Niitsitapi, also known as the Blackfoot or Blackfeet Indians, reside in the Great Plains of Montana and the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Originally, only one of the Niitsitapi tribes was called Blackfoot or Siksika. The name is said to have come from the color of the peoples&#x27; moccasins, made of leather. They had typically dyed or painted the soles of their moccasins black. One legendary story claimed that the Siksika walked through ashes of prairie fires, which in turn colored the bottoms of their moccasins black.
Due to language and cultural patterns, anthropologists believe the Niitsitapi did not originate in the Great Plains of the Midwest North America, but migrated from the upper Northeastern part of the country. They coalesced as a group while living in the forests of what is now the Northeastern United States. They were mostly located around the modern-day border between Canada and the state of Maine. By 1200, the Niitsitapi were moving in search of more land. They moved west and settled for a while north of the Great Lakes in present-day Canada, but had to compete for resources with existing tribes. They left the Great Lakes area and kept moving west.

When they moved, they usually packed their belongings on an A-shaped sled called a &quot;travois.&quot; The travois was designed for transport over dry land. The Blackfoot had relied on dogs to pull the &quot;travois&quot;; they did not acquire horses until the 18th century. From the Great Lakes area, they continued to move west and eventually settled in the Great Plains.

The Plains had covered approximately with the Saskatchewan River to the north, the Rio Grande to the south, the Mississippi River to the east, and the Rocky Mountains to the west. Adopting the use of the horse, the Niitsitapi established themselves as one of the most powerful Indian tribes on the Plains in the late 18th century, earning themselves the name &quot;The Lords of the Plains.&quot; Niitsitapi stories trace their residence and possession of their plains territory to &quot;time immemorial.&quot;

=== Importance and uses of bison ===
The Niitsitapi main source of food on the plains was the American bison (buffalo), the largest mammal in North America, standing about tall and weighing up to . Before the introduction of horses, the Niitsitapi needed other ways to get in range. The buffalo jump was one of the most common ways. The hunters would round up the buffalo into V-shaped pens, and drive them over a cliff (they hunted pronghorn antelopes in the same way). Afterwards the hunters would go to the bottom and take as much meat as they could carry back to camp. They also used camouflage for hunting. The hunters would take buffalo skins from previous hunting trips and drape them over their bodies to blend in and mask their scent. By subtle moves, the hunters could get close to the herd. When close enough, the hunters would attack with arrows or spears to kill wounded animals.

The people used virtually all parts of the body and skin. The women prepared the meat for food: by boiling, roasting or drying for jerky. This processed it to last a long time without spoiling, and they depended on bison meat to get through the winters. The winters were long, harsh, and cold due to the lack of trees in the Plains, so people stockpiled meat in summer. As a ritual, hunters often ate the bison heart minutes after the kill. The women tanned and prepared the skins to cover the tepees. These were made of log poles, with the skins draped over it. The tepee remained warm in the winter and cool in the summer, and was a great shield against the wind.

The women also made clothing from the skins, such as robes and moccasins, and made soap from the fat. Both men and women made utensils, sewing needles and tools from the bones, using tendon for fastening and binding. The stomach and bladder were cleaned and prepared for use for storing liquids. Dried bison dung was fuel for the fires. The Niitsitapi considered the animal sacred and integral to their lives.

=== Discovery and uses of horses ===

Up until around 1730, the Blackfoot traveled by foot and used dogs to carry and pull some of their goods. They had not seen horses in their previous lands, but were introduced to them on the Plains, as other tribes, such as the Shoshone, had already adopted their use. They saw the advantages of horses and wanted some. The Blackfoot called the horses &quot;ponokamita&quot; (elk dogs). The horses could carry much more weight than dogs and moved at a greater speed. They could be ridden for hunting and travel.
Horses revolutionised life on the Great Plains and soon came to be regarded as a measure of wealth. Warriors regularly raided other tribes for their best horses. Horses were generally used as universal standards of barter. Medicine men were paid for cures and healing with horses. Those who designed shields or war bonnets were also paid in horses. The men gave horses to those who were owed gifts as well as to the needy. An individual&#x27;s wealth rose with the number of horses accumulated, but a man did not keep an abundance of them. The individual&#x27;s prestige and status was judged by the number of horses that he could give away. For the Indians who lived on the Plains, the principal value of property was to share it with others.
After driving the hostile Shoshone and Arapaho from the Northwestern Plains, the Niitsitapi began in 1800 a long phase of keen competition in the fur trade with their former Cree allies, which often escalated militarily. In addition both groups had adapted to using horses about 1730, so by mid-century an adequate supply of horses became a question of survival. Horse theft was at this stage not only a proof of courage, but often a desperate contribution to survival, for many ethnic groups competed for hunting in the grasslands.

The Cree and Assiniboine continued horse raiding against the Gros Ventre (in Cree: &quot;Pawistiko Iyiniwak&quot; – &quot;Rapids People&quot; – &quot;People of the Rapids&quot;), allies of the Niitsitapi. The Gros Ventres were also known as &quot;Niya Wati Inew&quot;, &quot;Naywattamee&quot; (&quot;They Live in Holes People&quot;), because their tribal lands were along the Saskatchewan River Forks (the confluence of North and South Saskatchewan River). They had to withstand attacks of enemies with guns. In retaliation for Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) supplying their enemies with weapons, the Gros Ventre attacked and burned in 1793 South Branch House of the HBC on the South Saskatchewan River near the present village of St. Louis, Saskatchewan. Then, the tribe moved southward to the Milk River in Montana and allied themselves with the Blackfoot. The area between the North Saskatchewan River and Battle River (the name derives from the war fought between these two tribal groups) was the limit of the now warring tribal alliances.

=== Enemies and warrior culture ===
Blackfoot war parties would ride hundreds of miles on raids. A boy on his first war party was given a silly or derogatory name. But after he had stolen his first horse or killed an enemy, he was given a name to honor him. Warriors would strive to perform various acts of bravery called counting coup, in order to move up in social rank. The coups in order of importance were: taking a gun from a living enemy and or touching him directly; capturing lances, and bows; scalping an enemy; killing an enemy; freeing a tied horse from in front of an enemy lodge; leading a war party; scouting for a war party; stealing headdresses, shields, pipes (sacred ceremonial pipes); and driving a herd of stolen horses back to camp.

The Niitsitapi were enemies of the Crow, Cheyenne (&quot;kiihtsipimiitapi&quot; – ″Pinto People″), and Sioux (Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota) (called &quot;pinaapisinaa&quot; – &quot;East Cree&quot;) on the Great Plains; and the Shoshone, Flathead, Kalispel, Kootenai (called &quot;kotonáá&#x27;wa&quot;) and Nez Perce (called &quot;komonóítapiikoan&quot;) in the mountain country to their west and southwest. Their most mighty and most dangerous enemy, however, were the political/military/trading alliance of the Iron Confederacy or &quot;Nehiyaw-Pwat&quot; (in Plains Cree: &quot;Nehiyaw&quot; – &#x27;Cree&#x27; and &quot;Pwat&quot; or &quot;Pwat-sak&quot; – &#x27;Sioux, i.e. Assiniboine&#x27;) – named after the dominating Plains Cree (called &quot;Asinaa&quot;) and Assiniboine (called &quot;Niitsísinaa&quot; – &quot;Original Cree&quot;). These included the Stoney (called &quot;Saahsáísso&#x27;kitaki&quot; or &quot;Sahsi-sokitaki&quot; – ″Sarcee trying to cut″), Saulteaux (or Plains Ojibwe), and Métis to the north, east and southeast.

With the expansion of the &quot;Nehiyaw-Pwat&quot; to the north, west and southwest, they integrated larger groups of Iroquois, Chipewyan, Danezaa (&quot;Dunneza&quot; – &#x27;The real (prototypical) people&#x27;), Ktunaxa, Flathead, and later Gros Ventre (called &quot;atsíína&quot; – &quot;Gut People&quot; or &quot;like a Cree&quot;), in their local groups. Loosely allied with the &quot;Nehiyaw-Pwat&quot;, but politically independent, were neighboring tribes like the Ktunaxa, Secwepemc and in particular the arch enemy of the Blackfoot, the Crow, or Indian trading partners like the Nez Perce and Flathead.

The Shoshone acquired horses much sooner than the Blackfoot and soon occupied much of present-day Alberta, most of Montana, and parts of Wyoming, and raided the Blackfoot frequently. Once the Piegan gained access to horses of their own and guns, obtained from the HBC via the Cree and Assiniboine, the situation changed. By 1787 David Thompson reports that the Blackfoot had completely conquered most of Shoshone territory, and frequently captured Shoshone women and children and forcibly assimilated them into Blackfoot society, further increasing their advantages over the Shoshone. Thompson reports that Blackfoot territory in 1787 was from the North Saskatchewan River in the north to the Missouri River in the South, and from Rocky Mountains in the west out to a distance of to the east.

Between 1790 and 1850, the &quot;Nehiyaw-Pwat&quot; were at the height of their power; they could successfully defend their territories against the Sioux (Lakota, Nakota and Dakota) and the Niitsitapi Confederacy. During the so-called Buffalo Wars (about 1850 – 1870), they penetrated further and further into the territory from the Niitsitapi Confederacy in search for the buffalo, so that the Piegan were forced to give way in the region of the Missouri River (in Cree: &quot;Pikano Sipi&quot; – &quot;Muddy River&quot;, &quot;Muddy, turbid River&quot;), the Kainai withdrew to the Bow River and Belly River; only the Siksika could hold their tribal lands along the Red Deer River. Around 1870, the alliance between the Blackfoot and the Gros Ventre broke, and the latter began to look to their former enemies, the Southern Assiniboine (or Plains Assiniboine), for protection.

=== First contact with Europeans and the fur trade ===
Anthony Henday of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) met a large Blackfoot group in 1754 in what is now Alberta. The Blackfoot had established dealings with traders connected to the Canadian and English fur trade before meeting the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1806. Lewis and Clark and their men had embarked on mapping the Louisiana Territory and upper Missouri River for the United States government.

On their return trip from the Pacific Coast, Lewis and three of his men encountered a group of young Blackfoot warriors with a large herd of horses, and it was clear to Meriwether Lewis that they were not far from much larger groups of warriors. Lewis explained to them that the United States government wanted peace with all Indian nations, and that the US leaders had successfully formed alliances with other Indian nations. The group camped together that night, and at dawn there was a scuffle as it was discovered that the Blackfoot were trying to steal guns and run off with their horses while the Americans slept. In the ensuing struggle, one warrior was fatally stabbed and another shot by Lewis and presumed killed.

In subsequent years, American mountain men trapping in Blackfoot country generally encountered hostility. When John Colter, a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, returned to Blackfoot country soon after, he barely escaped with his life. In 1809, Colter and his companion were trapping on the Jefferson River by canoe when they were surrounded by hundreds of Blackfoot warriors on horseback on both sides of the river bank. Colter&#x27;s companion, John Potts, did not surrender and was killed. Colter was stripped of his clothes and forced to run for his life, after being given a head start (famously known in the annals of the West as &quot;Colter&#x27;s Run.&quot;) He eventually escaped by reaching a river five miles away and diving under either an island of driftwood or a beaver dam, where he remained concealed until after nightfall. He trekked another 300 miles to a fort.
In the context of shifting tribal politics due to the spread of horses and guns, the Niitsitapi initially tried to increase their trade with the HBC traders in Rupert&#x27;s Land whilst blocking access to the HBC by neighboring peoples to the West. But the HBC trade eventually reached into what is now inland British Columbia.

By the late 1820s, [this prompted] the Niitsitapiksi, and in particular the Piikani, whose territory was rich in beaver, [to] temporarily put aside cultural prohibitions and environmental constraints to trap enormous numbers of these animals and, in turn, receive greater quantities of trade items.
The HBC encouraged Niitsitapiksi to trade by setting up posts on the North Saskatchewan River, on the northern boundary of their territory. In the 1830s the Rocky Mountain region and the wider Saskatchewan District were the HBC&#x27;s most profitable, and Rocky Mountain House was the HBC&#x27;s busiest post. It was primarily used by the Piikani. Other Niitsitapiksi nations traded more in pemmican and buffalo skins than beaver, and visited other posts such as Fort Edmonton.

Meanwhile, in 1822, the American Fur Company entered the Upper Missouri region from the south for the first time, without Niitsitapiksi permission. This led to tensions and conflict until 1830, when peaceful trade was established. This was followed by the opening of Fort Piegan as the first American trading post in Niitsitapi territory in 1831, joined by Fort MacKenzie in 1833. The Americans offered better terms of trade and were more interested in buffalo skins than the HBC, which brought them more trade from the Niitsitapi. The HBC responded by building Bow Fort (Peigan Post) on the Bow River in 1832, but it was not a success.

In 1833, German explorer Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied and Swiss painter Karl Bodmer spent months with the Niitsitapi to get a sense of their culture. Bodmer portrayed their society in paintings and drawings.

Contact with the Europeans caused a spread of infectious diseases to the Niitsitapi, mostly cholera and smallpox. In one instance in 1837, an American Fur Company steamboat, the &quot;St. Peter&#x27;s&quot;, was headed to Fort Union and several passengers contracted smallpox on the way. They continued to send a smaller vessel with supplies farther up the river to posts among the Niitsitapi. The Niitsitapi contracted the disease and eventually 6,000 died, marking an end to their dominance among tribes over the Plains. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company did not require or help their employees get vaccinated; the English doctor Edward Jenner had developed a technique 41 years before but its use was not yet widespread.

===Indian Wars===
Like many other Great Plains Indian nations, the Niitsitapi often had hostile relationships with white settlers. Despite the hostilities, the Blackfoot stayed largely out of the Great Plains Indian Wars, neither fighting against nor scouting for the United States army. One of their friendly bands, however, was attacked by mistake and nearly destroyed by the US Army in the Marias Massacre on 23 January 1870, undertaken as an action to suppress violence against settlers. A friendly relationship with the North-West Mounted Police and learning of the brutality of the Marias Massacre discouraged the Blackfoot from engaging in wars against Canada and the United States.

When the Lakota, together with their Cheyenne and Arapaho allies, were fighting the United States Army, they sent runners into Blackfoot territory, urging them to join the fight. Crowfoot, one of the most influential Blackfoot chiefs, dismissed the Lakota messengers. He threatened to ally with the NWMP to fight them if they came north into Blackfoot country again. News of Crowfoot&#x27;s loyalty reached Ottawa and from there London; Queen Victoria praised Crowfoot and the Blackfoot for their loyalty. Despite his threats, Crowfoot later met those Lakota who had fled with Sitting Bull into Canada after defeating George Armstrong Custer and his battalion at the Battle of Little Big Horn. Crowfoot considered the Lakota then to be refugees and was sympathetic to their strife, but retained his anti-war stance. Sitting Bull and Crowfoot fostered peace between the two nations by a ceremonial offering of tobacco, ending hostilities between them. Sitting Bull was so impressed by Crowfoot that he named one of his sons after him.

The Blackfoot also chose to stay out of the North-West Rebellion, led by the famous Métis leader Louis Riel. Louis Riel and his men added to the already unsettled conditions facing the Blackfoot by camping near them. They tried to spread discontent with the government and gain a powerful ally. The North-West Rebellion was made up mostly of Métis, Assiniboine (Nakota) and Plains Cree, who all fought against European encroachment and destruction of Bison herds. The Plains Cree were one of the Blackfoot&#x27;s most hated enemies; however, the two nations made peace when Crowfoot adopted Poundmaker, an influential Cree chief and great peacemaker, as his son. Although he refused to fight, Crowfoot had sympathy for those with the rebellion, especially the Cree led by such notable chiefs as Poundmaker, Big Bear, Wandering Spirit and Fine-Day.

When news of continued Blackfoot neutrality reached Ottawa, Lord Lansdowne, the governor general, expressed his thanks to Crowfoot again on behalf of the Queen back in London. The cabinet of John A. Macdonald (the current Prime Minister of Canada at the time) gave Crowfoot a round of applause.

=== Further encroachment by Canada and United States ===
During the mid-1800s, the Niitsitapi faced a dwindling food supply, as European-American hunters were hired by the U.S. government to kill bison so the Blackfeet would remain in their reservation. Settlers were also encroaching on their territory. Without the buffalo, the Niitsitapi were forced to depend on the United States government for food supplies. In 1855, the Niitsitapi chief Lame Bull made a peace treaty with the United States government. The Lame Bull Treaty promised the Niitsitapi $20,000 annually in goods and services in exchange for their moving onto a reservation.

In 1860, very few buffalo were left, and the Niitsitapi became completely dependent on government supplies. Often the food was spoiled by the time they received it, or supplies failed to arrive at all. Hungry and desperate, Blackfoot raided white settlements for food and supplies, and outlaws on both sides stirred up trouble.

Events were catalyzed by Owl Child, a young Piegan warrior who stole a herd of horses in 1867 from an American trader named Malcolm Clarke. Clarke retaliated by tracking Owl Child down and severely beating him in full view of Owl Child&#x27;s camp, and humiliating him. According to Piegan oral history, Clarke had also raped Owl Child&#x27;s wife. But, Clarke was long married to Coth-co-co-na, a Piegan woman who was Owl Child&#x27;s cousin. The raped woman gave birth to a child as a result of the rape, which oral history said was stillborn or killed by band elders. Two years after the beating, in 1869 Owl Child and some associates killed Clarke at his ranch after dinner, and severely wounded his son Horace. Public outcry from news of the event led to General Philip Sheridan to dispatch a band of cavalry, led by Major Eugene Baker, to find Owl Child and his camp and punish them.
On 23 January 1870, a camp of Piegan Indians were spotted by army scouts and reported to the dispatched cavalry, but it was mistakenly identified as a hostile band. Around 200 soldiers surrounded the camp the following morning and prepared for an ambush. Before the command to fire, the chief Heavy Runner was alerted to soldiers on the snowy bluffs above the encampment. He walked toward them, carrying his safe-conduct paper. Heavy Runner and his band of Piegans shared peace between American settlers and troops at the time of the event. Heavy Runner was shot and killed by army scout Joe Cobell, whose wife was part of the camp of the hostile Mountain Chief, further along the river, from whom he wanted to divert attention. Fellow scout Joe Kipp had realized the error and tried to signal the troops. He was threatened by the cavalry for reporting that the people they attacked were friendly.

Following the death of Heavy Runner, the soldiers attacked the camp. According to their count, they killed 173 Piegan and suffered just one U.S. Army soldier casualty, who fell off his horse and broke his leg, dying of complications. Most of the victims were women, children and the elderly, as most of the younger men were out hunting. The Army took 140 Piegan prisoner and then released them. With their camp and belongings destroyed, they suffered terribly from exposure, making their way as refugees to Fort Benton.

As reports of the massacre gradually were learned in the east, members of the United States Congress and press were outraged. General William Tecumseh Sherman reported that most of the killed were warriors under Mountain Chief. An official investigation never occurred, and no official monument marks the spot of the massacre. Compared to events such as the massacres at Wounded Knee and Sand Creek, the Marias Massacre remains largely unknown. But, it confirmed President Ulysses S. Grant in his decision not to allow the Army to take over the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as it had been suggesting to combat corruption among Indian agents. Grant chose to appoint numerous Quakers to those positions as he pursued a peace policy with Native Americans.

The Cree and Assiniboine also suffered from the dwindling herds of the buffalo. By 1850 herds were found almost exclusively on the territory of the Blackfoot. Therefore, in 1870 various &quot;Nehiyaw-Pwat&quot; bands began a final effort to get hold of their prey, by beginning a war. They hoped to defeat the Blackfoot weakened by smallpox and attacked a camp near Fort Whoop-Up (called &quot;Akaisakoyi&quot; – &quot;Many Dead&quot;). But they were defeated in the so-called Battle of the Belly River (near Lethbridge, called &quot;Assini-etomochi&quot; – &quot;where we slaughtered the Cree&quot;) and lost over 300 warriors. The next winter the hunger compelled them to negotiate with the Niitsitapi, with whom they made a final lasting peace.

The United States passed laws that adversely affected the Niitsitapi. In 1874, the US Congress voted to change the Niitsitapi reservation borders without discussing it with the Niitsitapi. They received no other land or compensation for the land lost, and in response, the Kainai, Siksika, and Piegan moved to Canada; only the Pikuni remained in Montana.

The winter of 1883–1884 became known as &quot;Starvation Winter&quot; because no government supplies came in, and the buffalo were gone. That winter, 600 Niitsitapi died of hunger.

In efforts to assimilate the Native Americans to European-American ways, in 1898, the government dismantled tribal governments and outlawed the practice of traditional Indian religions. They required Blackfoot children to go to boarding schools, where they were forbidden to speak their native language, practise customs, or wear traditional clothing. In 1907, the United States government adopted a policy of allotment of reservation land to individual heads of families to encourage family farming and break up the communal tribal lands. Each household received a farm, and the government declared the remainder &quot;surplus&quot; to the tribe&#x27;s needs. It put it up for sale for development. The allotments were too small to support farming on the arid plains. A 1919 drought destroyed crops and increased the cost of beef. Many Indians were forced to sell their allotted land and pay taxes which the government said they owed.

In 1934 the Indian Reorganization Act, passed by the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, ended allotments and allowed the tribes to choose their own government. They were also allowed to practise their cultures. In 1935, the Blackfeet Nation of Montana began a Tribal Business Council. After that, they wrote and passed their own Constitution, with an elected representative government.

==Culture==

=== Electing a leader ===
Family was highly valued by the Blackfoot Indians. For traveling, they also split into bands of 20–30 people, but would come together for times of celebration. They valued leadership skills and chose the chiefs who would run their settlements wisely. During times of peace, the people would elect a peace chief, meaning someone who could lead the people and improve relations with other tribes. The title of war chief could not be gained through election and needed to be earned by successfully performing various acts of bravery including touching a living enemy. Blackfoot bands often had minor chiefs in addition to an appointed head chief.

=== Societies ===
Within the Blackfoot nation, there were different societies to which people belonged, each of which had functions for the tribe. Young people were invited into societies after proving themselves by recognized passages and rituals. For instance, young men had to perform a vision quest, begun by a spiritual cleansing in a sweat lodge. They went out from the camp alone for four days of fasting and praying. Their main goal was to see a vision that would explain their future. After having the vision, a youth returned to the village ready to join society.

In a warrior society, the men had to be prepared for battle. Again, the warriors would prepare by spiritual cleansing, then paint themselves symbolically; they often painted their horses for war as well. Leaders of the warrior society carried spears or lances called a &quot;coup&quot; stick, which was decorated with feathers, skin, and other tokens. They won prestige by &quot;counting coup&quot;, tapping the enemy with the stick and getting away.
Members of the religious society protected sacred Blackfoot items and conducted religious ceremonies. They blessed the warriors before battle. Their major ceremony was the Sun Dance, or Medicine Lodge Ceremony. By engaging in the Sun Dance, their prayers would be carried up to the Creator, who would bless them with well-being and abundance of buffalo.

Women&#x27;s societies also had important responsibilities for the communal tribe. They designed refined quillwork on clothing and ceremonial shields, helped prepare for battle, prepared skins and cloth to make clothing, cared for the children and taught them tribal ways, skinned and tanned the leathers used for clothing and other purposes, prepared fresh and dried foods, and performed ceremonies to help hunters in their journeys.

===Ethnobotany===
Sage and sweet grass are both used by Blackfoot and other Plains tribes for ceremonial purposes and are considered sacred plants. Sage and sweet grass are burned with the user inhaling and covering themselves in the smoke in a process known widely as smudging. Sage is said to rid the body of negative emotions such as anger. Sweet grass is said to draw in positive energy. Both are used for purification purposes. The pleasant and natural odor of the burning grass is said to attract spirits. Sweet grass is prepared for ceremony by braiding the stems together then drying them before burning.

Sweet grass is also often present and burned in pipe-smoking mixtures alongside bearberry and red willow plants. The smoke from the pipe is said to carry the users prayers up to the creator with the rising smoke. Large medicine bags often decorated with ornate beaded designs were used by medicine men to carry sage, sweet grass, and other important plants. Blackfoot also used sweet grass smoke, or sachets of sweet grass in their clothing, as an effective insect repellent.

They apply a poultice of chewed roots Asclepias viridiflora to swellings, to &quot;diarrhea rash&quot;, to rashes, to the sore gums of nursing infants and to sore eyes. They also chew the root of Asclepias viridiflora for sore throats, and use the plant to spice soups, and use the fresh roots for food. They make use of Viola adunca, applying an infusion of the roots and leaves to sore and swollen joints, giving an infusion of the leaves and roots to asthmatic children, and using the plant to dye their arrows blue. They put Carex in moccasins to protect the feet during winter horse stealing expeditions.

=== Marriage ===
In the Blackfoot culture, men were responsible for choosing their marriage partners, but women had the choice to accept them or not. The male had to show the woman&#x27;s father his skills as a hunter or warrior. If the father was impressed and approved of the marriage, the man and woman would exchange gifts of horses and clothing and were considered married. The married couple would reside in their own tipi or with the husband&#x27;s family. Although the man was permitted more than one wife, typically he only chose one. In cases of more than one wife, quite often the male would choose a sister of the wife, believing that sisters would not argue as much as total strangers.

=== Responsibilities and clothing ===

In a typical Blackfoot family, the father would go out and hunt and bring back supplies that the family might need. The mother would stay close to home and watch over the children while the father was out. The children were taught basic survival skills and culture as they grew up. It was generally said that both boys and girls learned to ride horses early. Boys would usually play with toy bows and arrows until they were old enough to learn how to hunt.

They would also play a popular game called shinny, which later became known as ice hockey. They used a long curved wooden stick to knock a ball, made of baked clay covered with buckskin, over a goal line. Girls were given a doll to play with, which also doubled as a learning tool because it was fashioned with typical tribal clothing and designs and also taught the young women how to care for a child. As they grew older, more responsibilities were placed upon their shoulders. The girls were then taught to cook, prepare hides for leather, and gather wild plants and berries. The boys were held accountable for going out with their father to prepare food by means of hunting.Typically clothing was made primarily of softened and tanned antelope and deer hides. The women would make and decorate the clothes for everyone in the tribe. Men wore moccasins, long leggings that went up to their hips, a loincloth, and a belt. Occasionally they would wear shirts but generally they would wrap buffalo robes around their shoulders. The distinguished men of bravery would wear a necklace made of grizzly bear claws.

Boys dressed much like the older males, wearing leggings, loincloths, moccasins, and occasionally an undecorated shirt. They kept warm by wearing a buffalo robe over their shoulders or over their heads if it became cold. Women and girls wore dresses made from two or three deerskins. The women wore decorative earrings and bracelets made from sea shells, obtained through trade with distant tribes, or different types of metal. They would sometimes wear beads in their hair or paint the part in their hair red, which signified that they were old enough to bear children.

===Headdresses===
Similar to other Indigenous Peoples of the Great Plains, the Blackfoot developed a variety of different headdresses that incorporated elements of creatures important to them; these served different purposes and symbolized different associations. The typical war bonnet was made from eagle feathers, because the bird was considered powerful. It was worn by prestigious warriors and chiefs (including war-chiefs) of the Blackfoot. The straight-up headdress is a uniquely Blackfoot headdress that, like the war bonnet, is made with eagle feathers. The feathers on the straight-up headdress point directly straight upwards from the rim (hence the name). Often a red plume is attached to the front of the headdress; it also points straight upward.

The split-horn headdress was very popular among Northern Plains Indians, particularly those nations of the Blackfoot Confederacy. Many warrior societies, including the Horn Society of the Blackfoot, wore the split-horn headdress. The split-horn headdress was made from a single bison horn, split in two and reshaped as slimmer versions of a full-sized bison horn, and polished. The horns were attached to a beaded, rimmed felt hat. Furs from weasels (taken when carrying heavy winter coats) were attached to the top of the headdress, and dangled from the sides. The side furs were often finished with bead work where attached to the headdress. A similar headdress, called the antelope horn headdress, was made in a similar fashion using the horn or horns from a pronghorn antelope.

Blackfoot men, particularly warriors, sometimes wore a roach made from porcupine hair. The hairs of the porcupine are most often dyed red. Eagle and other bird feathers were occasionally attached to the roach.

Buffalo scalps, often with horns still attached and often with a beaded rim, were also worn. Fur &quot;turbans&quot; made from soft animal fur (most often otter) were also popular. Buffalo scalps and fur turbans were worn in the winter to protect the head from the cold.

The Blackfoot have continued to wear traditional headdresses at special ceremonies. They are worn mostly by elected chiefs, members of various traditional societies (including the Horn, Crazy Dog and Motokik societies), powwow dancers and spiritual leaders.

One of the most famous traditions held by the Blackfoot is their story of sun and the moon. It starts with a family of a man, wife, and two sons, who live off berries and other food they can gather, as they have no bows and arrows, or other tools (albeit a stone axe). One night, the man had a dream: he was told by the dream to get a large spider web and put it on the trail where the animals roamed, and they would get caught up and could be easily killed with the stone axe he had. The man had done so and saw that it was true. One day, he came home from bringing in some fresh meat from the trail and discovered his wife to be applying perfume on herself. He thought that she must have another lover since she never did this before. He then told his wife that he was going to move a web and asked if she could bring in the meat and wood he had left outside from a previous hunt. She had reluctantly gone out and passed over a hill. The wife looked back three times and saw her husband in the same place she had left him, so she continued on to retrieve the meat. The father then asked his children if they went with their mother to find wood, but they never had. However they knew the location in which she retrieved it from.

The man set out and found the timber along with a den of rattlesnakes, one of which was his wife&#x27;s lover. He set the timber on fire and killed the snakes. He knew by doing this that his wife would become enraged, so the man returned home. He told the children to flee and gave them a stick, stone, and moss to use if their mother chased after them. He remained at the house and put a web over his front door. The wife tried to get in but became stuck and had her leg cut off. She then put her head through and he cut that off also. While the body followed the husband to the creek, the head followed the children. The oldest boy saw the head behind them and threw the stick. The stick turned into a great forest. The head made it through, so the younger brother instructed the elder to throw the stone. He did so, and where the stone landed a huge mountain popped up. It spanned from big water (ocean) to big water and the head was forced to go through it, not around. The head met a group of rams and said to them she would marry their chief if they butted their way through the mountain. The chief agreed and they butted until their horns were worn down, but this still was not through. She then asked the ants if they could burrow through the mountain with the same stipulations, it was agreed and they get her the rest of the way through. The children were far ahead, but eventually saw the head rolling behind them. The boys wet the moss and wrung it out behind themselves. They were then in a different land surrounded by an expanse of water (the &#x27;new land&#x27; is commonly interpreted as Russia, with the expanse of water being the Bering Strait). The head rolled into the water and drowned. The children decided to build a raft and head back. Once they returned to their land, however, they discovered that it was now occupied by the Crow people and the Snake people, so they decided to split up.

One brother was simple and went north to discover what he could and make people. The other was smart and went south to make white people. He taught them how to forge and make advanced weapons, which is how the Blackfoot people believe the whites became so technologically advanced. The simple brother created the Blackfoot nation and was unable to teach them anything. He became known as Left Hand, and later by the Blackfoot as Old Man (or Napiw, the Creator). The woman still chases the man: she is the moon and he is the sun, and if she ever catches him, it will always be night.

=== Blackfoot creation story ===
The creation myth is part of the oral history of the Blackfoot nation. It was said that in the beginning, Napio floated on a log with four animals. The animals were: Mameo (fish), Matcekups (frog), Maniskeo (lizard), and Sopeo (turtle). Napio sent all of them into the deep water, one after another. The first three had gone down and returned with nothing. The turtle went down and retrieved mud from the bottom and gave it to Napio.

He took the mud and rolled it in his hand and created the earth. He let it roll out of his hand and over time, it has grown to what it is today. After he created the earth, he created women first, followed by men. He had them living separately from one another. The men were shy and afraid, but Napio said to them to not fear and take one as their wife. They had done as he asked, and Napio continued to create the buffalo and bows and arrows for the people so that they could hunt them.

== People ==
=== Ethnic divisions ===
The largest ethnic group in the Confederacy is the &quot;Piegan&quot;, also spelled &quot;Peigan&quot; or &quot;Pikuni&quot;. Their name derives from the Blackfoot term &quot;Piikáni&quot;. They are divided into the Piikani Nation (&quot;Aapátohsipikáni&quot; (&quot;the companion up there&quot;) or simply &quot;Piikáni&quot;) in present-day Alberta, and the South Peigan or Piegan Blackfeet (&quot;Aamsskáápipikani&quot;) in Montana, United States. A once large and mighty division of the Piegan were the Inuk&#x27;sik (&quot;the humans&quot;) of southwestern Montana. Today they survive only as a clan or band of the South Peigan.

The modern Kainai Nation is named for the Blackfoot-language term &quot;Káínaa&quot;, meaning &quot;Many Chief people&quot;. These were historically also called the &quot;Blood,&quot; from a Plains Cree name for the Kainai: &quot;Miko-Ew&quot;, meaning &quot;stained with blood&quot; (i.e. &quot;the bloodthirsty, cruel&quot;). The common English name for the tribe is Blood or the Blood tribe.

The Siksika Nation&#x27;s name derives from &quot;Siksikáwa,&quot; meaning &quot;Those of like&quot;. The Siksika also call themselves &quot;Sao-kitapiiksi,&quot; meaning &quot;Plains People&quot;.

The Sarcee call themselves the &quot;Tsu T&#x27;ina,&quot; meaning &quot;a great number of people.&quot; During early years of conflict, the Blackfoot called them &quot;Saahsi&quot; or &quot;Sarsi&quot;, &quot;the stubborn ones&quot;, in their language. The Sarcee are from an entirely different language family; they are part of the Athabascan or Dené language family, most of whose members are located in the Subarctic of Northern Canada. Specifically, the Sarcee are an offshoot of the Beaver (Danezaa) people, who migrated south onto the plains sometime in the early eighteenth century. They later joined the Confederacy and essentially merged with the Pikuni (&quot;Once had&quot;).

The Gros Ventre people call themselves the &quot;Haaninin&quot; (&quot;white clay people&quot;), also spelled &quot;A&#x27;aninin.&quot; The French called them &quot;Gros Ventres&quot; (&quot;fat bellies&quot;), misinterpreting a physical sign for waterfall; and the English called them the Fall Indians, related to waterfalls in the mountains. The Blackfoot referred to them as the &quot;Piik-siik-sii-naa&quot; (&quot;snakes&quot;) or &quot;Atsina&quot; (&quot;like a Cree&quot;), because of years of enmity. Early scholars thought the A&#x27;aninin were related to the Arapaho Nation, who inhabited the Missouri Plains and moved west to Colorado and Wyoming. They were allied with the Confederacy from circa 1793 to 1861, but came to disagreement and were enemies of it thereafter.

===Modern communities===

====Economy and services====
Today, many of the Blackfoot live on reserves in Canada. About 8,500 live on the Montana reservation of . In 1896, the Blackfoot sold a large portion of their land to the United States government, which hoped to find gold or copper deposits. No such mineral deposits were found. In 1910, the land was set aside as Glacier National Park. Some Blackfoot work there and occasional Native American ceremonies are held there.

Unemployment is a challenging problem on the Blackfeet Reservation and on Canadian Blackfoot reserves, because of their isolation from major urban areas. Many people work as farmers, but there are not enough other jobs nearby. To find work, many Blackfoot have relocated from the reservation to towns and cities. Some companies pay the Blackfoot governments to lease use of lands for extracting oil, natural gas, and other resources. The nations have operated such businesses such as the Blackfoot Writing Company, a pen and pencil factory, which opened in 1972, but it closed in the late 1990s. In Canada, the Northern Piegan make traditional craft clothing and moccasins, and the Kainai operate a shopping center and factory.

In 1974, the Blackfoot Community College, a tribal college, opened in Browning, Montana. The school is also the location of the tribal headquarters. As of 1979, the Montana state government requires all public school teachers on or near the reservation to have a background in American Indian studies.

In 1986, the Kainai Nation opened the Red Crow Community College in Stand Off, Alberta. In 1989, the Siksika tribe in Canada completed the construction of a high school to go along with its elementary school.

==== Traditional culture ====

The Blackfoot continue many cultural traditions of the past and hope to extend their ancestors&#x27; traditions to their children. They want to teach their children the Pikuni language as well as other traditional knowledge. In the early 20th century, a white woman named Frances Densmore helped the Blackfoot record their language. During the 1950s and 1960s, few Blackfoot spoke the Pikuni language. In order to save their language, the Blackfoot Council asked elders who still knew the language to teach it. The elders had agreed and succeeded in reviving the language, so today the children can learn Pikuni at school or at home. In 1994, the Blackfoot Council accepted Pikuni as the official language.

The people have revived the Black Lodge Society, responsible for protecting songs and dances of the Blackfoot. They continue to announce the coming of spring by opening five medicine bundles, one at every sound of thunder during the spring. One of the biggest celebrations is called the North American Indian Days. Lasting four days, it is held during the second week of July in Browning. Lastly, the Sun Dance, which was illegal from the 1890s–1934, has been practiced again for years. While it was illegal, the Blackfoot held it in secret. Since 1934, they have practised it every summer. The event lasts eight days – time filled with prayers, dancing, singing, and offerings to honor the Creator. It provides an opportunity for the Blackfoot to get together and share views and ideas with each other, while celebrating their culture&#x27;s most sacred ceremonies.

The Blackfeet Nation in Montana have a blue tribal flag. The flag shows a ceremonial lance or coup stick with 29 feathers. The center of the flag contains a ring of 32 white and black eagle feathers. Within the ring is an outline map of the Blackfoot Reservation. Within the map is depicted a warrior&#x27;s headdress and the words &quot;Blackfeet Nation&quot; and &quot;Pikuni&quot; (the name of the tribe in the Algonquian native tongue of the Blackfoot).

<text>Clue (known as &quot;Cluedo&quot; outside of North America) is a 1998 video game based on the board game of the same name. It is also known as &quot;Clue: Murder at Boddy Mansion&quot; or &quot;Cluedo: Murder at Blackwell Grange&quot;, depending on whether the country of release used American or British English.

&quot;Clue&quot; runs on Microsoft Windows. It was developed in 1998 for Hasbro Interactive by EAI. Infogrames (now Atari) took over publishing rights for the game in 2000 when Hasbro Interactive went out of business. The game, just like the board game, is meant for 3-6 players due to the six suspects. The game garnered generally positive reviews upon release.

Engineering Animation released a spin-off named &quot;Clue Chronicles: Fatal Illusion&quot; in 1999.
==Development==

&quot;Clue&quot; was developed by a branch of Engineering Animation, Inc. known as EAI Interactive. The development process was divided between EAI&#x27;s interactive division located in Salt Lake City, Utah, and its main office in Ames, Iowa. While the majority of the programming and game design activities were conducted in Salt Lake, the Ames office focused on art and animations. The creation of the in-game mansion, built piece by piece, initially began in Ames but shifted to Salt Lake City midway through the project.

The primary motivation for developing the game was to enhance and rectify the shortcomings of the previous 1992 version, which was criticized for subpar AI, board presentations, and game mechanics. The new iteration of &quot;Clue&quot; sought to rectify these issues, with a particular emphasis on improving the artificial intelligence of computer players within the game.

The development of &quot;Clue&quot; spanned approximately one year, with funding provided by the game&#x27;s publisher, Hasbro Interactive. Chris Nash, Lead Programmer on the project, described the experience as both enjoyable and challenging, especially during crunch times near the project&#x27;s conclusion.

Nash explained the design process, highlighting the collaboration between the development team and Hasbro, the publisher. He acknowledged that Hasbro had the final say on graphical treatments, with one notable flaw being the lack of visual representation for suggestions made within the game. Nash discussed the challenge of aligning the UI design with both the Game Designer&#x27;s vision and Hasbro&#x27;s preferences. Despite some design conflicts, Nash emphasized that Hasbro&#x27;s involvement generally did not involve excessive micromanagement. The characters&#x27; designs, particularly that of Miss Scarlet, underwent iterations before finalization. Nash also addressed an unconfirmed rumor that Miss Scarlet&#x27;s appearance was modeled after the game&#x27;s producer, Virginia.

The development team for &quot;Clue&quot; included numerous individuals who contributed to various aspects of the game, such as programming, art, design, and testing. Notable contributors included Michael S. Glosecki, Bryan Brandenburg, Tom Zahorik, Virginia McArthur, Rick Raymer, Tim Zwica, Joshua Jensen, and others.

&quot;Clue&quot; enjoyed a longer shelf life than typical for video games. It remained available for purchase years after its 1998 release, either as a standalone product or part of collections such as the &quot;Classic Game Collection&quot;. The game&#x27;s availability was also promoted through tie-ins, including distribution with breakfast cereal and other Hasbro video games. The longevity of &quot;Clue&quot; was in part attributed to its association with the 50th anniversary of the original Clue board game.

===Artificial Intelligence===
The artificial intelligence (AI) implemented in &quot;Clue&quot; for computer-controlled opponents was considered advanced for a digital board game conversion. The AI&#x27;s ability to deduce solutions led to customer complaints of cheating, although the AI simply outperformed the average human player. The AI recorded players&#x27; suggestions and tracked information often overlooked by human players. This allowed the AI to deduce which cards players possessed without explicitly asking about them.

Three difficulty levels for the AI were provided, with the hardest level utilizing the entire game history for decision-making. The AI&#x27;s development was led by Mike Reed, based on a design by Bob Pennington. Independent studies demonstrated the AI&#x27;s effectiveness in making deductions about the game&#x27;s case file contents.

The success of &quot;Clue&quot; led to the reuse of its 3D characterizations in the &quot;Cluedo&quot;-inspired title &quot;Fatal Illusion&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The game has the same objective as the board game it is based on: to find the murderer, the room which housed Mr. Boddy/Dr. Black&#x27;s demise, and the weapon used.

In addition to play by the original rules, &quot;Clue&quot; has an additional mode that allows movement via &quot;points&quot;. Each turn begins with nine points and every action the player takes costs points. The player can only do as many things as he has points. For example, moving from square to square costs one point, making a suggestion costs three points. Many players prefer this mode of play as it makes the game more balanced since each player gets the same number of &quot;moves&quot; each turn.

A few features of &quot;Clue&quot;:
* Detailed depictions of the characters made famous by the board game.
* A 3D isometric view.
* A top down view reminiscent of the board game.
* Video clips of the characters carrying out the crime.
* Online play via the Internet.

The Providence Journal described the game as having a &quot;film-noir environment (like a murder-mystery movie of the 1940s)&quot;. Christian Spotlight explains that these can be switched off if one so chooses.

AllGame explains that &quot;each room is richly created in loving detail, complete with exotic period furniture and secret passages. Both the mood and gameplay is enhanced by the deep, sonorous voice of the Butler as he announces events as they occur&quot;. Spong says: &quot;Cluedo takes place mostly in the house where the murder was committed, creating a chilling atmosphere. Environments are beautifully rendered, featuring all characters from the original board game in full 3D&quot;.

Cnet explains, &quot;Clue offers full animations of the characters walking from room to room. While this is interesting for a while, you&#x27;ll probably want to play with the standard overhead view of the board. Along with the animations is a really good soundtrack that includes sounds of the storm outside the mansion and a forbidding butler who calls out each suggestion as it is played&quot;. It adds, &quot;the &quot;autonotes&quot; feature that takes notes as to what cards you&#x27;ve seen doesn&#x27;t record what suggestions have already been made, so making educated guesses as to which cards people don&#x27;t have by their suggestions becomes a pen and paper experience&quot;.

The background music is inspired by genres such as jazz and film noir. Christian Spotlight said that &quot;the music is a bit annoying, simply replaying the same bars over and over and over again. Thankfully, the music is quiet and not much of a distraction&quot;. It also added: &quot;Click on some of the objects in each area and be surprised by the many short animations that unfold&quot;.

Spong says: &quot;A multi-player option over LAN offers something new to Cluedo that only a video game can accomplish. Whether your playing head to head or co-operatively, the experience makes the game much more sociable and enjoyable. And it’s quite possible that this gameplay addition alone makes Cluedo: Murder at Blackwell Grange a thoroughly playable experience&quot;. The game was originally connected to the MSN Gaming Zone, but MSN stopped hosting the game. In-game links to online play now go to an invalid URL address. Christian Spotlight says: &quot;The Internet play is absolutely flawless, even over a slow Internet connection. The game is stable and is supported quite well. Play with a few friends or family members around the computer or across the Internet. But for large groups in a single location, the original board game is much more easier than cramping around the computer keyboard and mouse&quot;.

The game uses an algorithm that allows it to be reusable, so that multiple levels are not needed. In &quot;Clue&quot;, &quot;the idea is that of starting a new game each time. This particular game places a new puzzle to the player every new game so that the game is new to him/her every time&quot; - having a different 3-card solution - despite using exactly the same game mechanics.

==Cutscenes==
===Opening===
The video opens on a view outside Blackwell Grange/Boddy Manor. The view cuts to the inside hall with the game&#x27;s murderer, holding a lit candlestick, walking down the hall and entering one of the rooms. The candle is extinguished and silhouetted via a lightning flash, an indeterminate human figure prepares to strike the victim when the video cuts to the game&#x27;s title.

===Deal===
Mr. Boddy/Dr. Black&#x27;s spirit has returned to shuffle the cards and hand them out the players, in order for them to discover how he was murdered then puts the three cards representing the game&#x27;s murderer, room and weapon in a briefcase. &quot;Clue&quot; is a direct conversion of the original game as a video game.

===Murder===
Every possible suspect and method of killing the victim is represented via a custom cutscene when a suggestion is made. These cutscenes are played through Mr. Boddy/Dr. Black&#x27;s perspective. For example:
* The suspect stabbing with or throwing a knife at him
* Hanging, hitting, or strangling him with the rope
* Hitting him with the candlestick, wrench, or lead pipe
* Shooting him with a revolver

===Jail===
When the game is solved, the game&#x27;s true killer walks into a jail cell and the door closes. The character&#x27;s actions in the scene are as follows:
* Either Miss Scarlet (who poses), Colonel Mustard (who stands to attention), or Mrs. White (who dusts the wall) entering the jail cell 
* Mr. Green lying on the bed
* Mrs. Peacock sitting on the bed
* A sad Professor Plum sitting on a toilet

==Reception==
&quot;AllGame&quot; gave the game 3 out of 5, commenting that &quot;the game&#x27;s graphics and sound are excellent and add to the escalating feel of suspense&quot;, while adding that &quot;so much is happening in the visually stunning backgrounds, or the deep, sinister soundtrack&quot; that the sometimes-slow pace of the board game is unnoticeable. In a 1999 &quot;MABM&quot; review, Helen Ubinas said: &quot;Whoever thought of moving this classic to disc had a clue&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; thought the game was &quot;stunning&quot;, and thought the &quot;sexy...mysterious&quot; soundtrack could have been made for a feature film.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; gave it a rating of 7.6, saying: &quot;Basically, if you love the board game, you&#x27;re going to want this version. And if you haven&#x27;t played the board game, buy this instead&quot;. &quot;CNET&quot; gave the game a 3.5-star rating, writing &quot;this is probably more fun than playing the board game&quot;, while concluding that &quot;overall, this is one of the best translations to the PC that Hasbro has ever done. Beyond the simple fault of some extra features that weren&#x27;t implemented to their best effect, there aren&#x27;t really many faults with the game&quot;. &quot;Christian Spotlight&quot; gave the game a rating of 4.5 out 5 stars, while &quot;Gamezebo&quot; gave the game a 4 out of 5 star rating.

The game was named &quot;Video Game of the Week&quot; on 1999-02-06 in the &quot;Fresno Bee&quot;.

<doc id="167724" wikidata="Q1234074" url="?curid=167724" title="Jungle Fever">
<text>Jungle Fever is a 1991 American romantic drama film written, produced and directed by Spike Lee. Starring Lee, Wesley Snipes, Annabella Sciorra, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Samuel L. Jackson, Lonette McKee, John Turturro, Frank Vincent, Tim Robbins, Brad Dourif, Giancarlo Esposito, Debi Mazar, Michael Imperioli, Anthony Quinn, and Halle Berry and Queen Latifah in their film debuts, &quot;Jungle Fever&quot; explores the beginning and end of an extramarital interracial relationship against the urban backdrop of the streets of New York City in the early 1990s. The film received positive reviews, with particular praise for Samuel L. Jackson&#x27;s performance, and was also commercially successful.

==Plot==
Successful Harlem architect Flipper Purify lives with his wife Drew, a buyer at Bloomingdale&#x27;s, and their young daughter, Ming. One day at his office, the Mast &amp; Covington architecture firm in mid-town Manhattan, Flipper discovers that an Italian-American woman named Angela &quot;Angie&quot; Tucci from Bensonhurst has been hired as his temp secretary. Initially upset at being the only black person, he relents when senior partners Jerry and Leslie remind him that hiring is based on ability, not race.

Angie&#x27;s quiet fiancé Paulie Carbone co-manages a corner grocery store/cafe and newsstand and lives with his elderly widowed father Lou. When Paulie arrives to take her out on a date, her brothers Charlie and James antagonize him while he awaits her arrival, threatening physical retribution if he sexually disrespects her. Nevertheless, she urges Paulie to stand up to them as they depart.

After working several late nights together, Flipper and Angie have sex, beginning a tumultuous relationship. The next day, Flipper demands that Jerry and Leslie promote him to partner, but they deny his request, and he resigns, telling his employers that his ideas have made the firm very profitable. Eventually, he admits his infidelity to his longtime friend, Cyrus, who criticizes him not for his infidelity towards his wife, but for his affair with a white woman. Cyrus describes his situation as &quot;jungle fever&quot;—an attraction borne of sexualized racial myths rather than love—and Flipper warns him against telling anyone. Angie&#x27;s friends are equally disparaging when she discloses her liaison.

Drew learns about Flipper&#x27;s affair through Cyrus&#x27;s wife Vera and ejects him from their home, forcing him to move in with his father, Southern Baptist preacher The Good Reverend Doctor Purify, and his mother, Lucinda. Later that night, he confronts Cyrus for betraying his trust and insults Vera for being unable to keep a secret, which damages his friendship with Cyrus. Shortly afterwards, Flipper denounces Cyrus, realizing that he will always side with Vera regardless of her actions. Later, Angie devastates Paulie by ending their longstanding engagement, but when she returns, her father Mike, having discovered her relationship with Flipper, severely beats Angie with his belt and kicks her out.

Flipper attempts to reconcile with Drew at her workplace by bringing her flowers, but Drew declines, feeling he was only attracted to her for being half-white. He and Angie move into an apartment in Greenwich Village, where they encounter discrimination for being a mixed-race couple, such as insults from a waitress named LaShawn at a local restaurant, chastisement from The Good Reverend during the couple&#x27;s dinner with his parents, and financial issues. One night, Flipper is restrained and almost arrested by two policemen (the same ones from &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;) who receive a wrongful report that he was attacking Angie. The couple&#x27;s issues are compounded by Flipper&#x27;s feelings for his family and her wanting to have children of her own, causing their split. Echoing Cyrus&#x27;s earlier words, Flipper tells Angie their relationship has been based on sexual racial myths and not love. Angie, although upset, accepts that the affair has ultimately run its course.

Later, Flipper&#x27;s crack-addicted brother Gator steals and sells Lucinda&#x27;s TV for drugs. Searching all over Harlem, Flipper eventually locates him in a crack house and exasperatedly disowns him. Soon afterwards, Gator returns to his parents&#x27; house to ask for money and, after Lucinda refuses, begins ransacking the home. His erratic behavior ignites an altercation that ends with The Good Reverend angrily disowning him before shooting him with a handgun. Gator collapses and dies in Lucinda&#x27;s arms as The Good Reverend watches remorsefully.

Meanwhile, Paulie&#x27;s racist Italian-American friends mock the end of his engagement. He asks one of his customers, a friendly black woman named Orin Goode, out on a date, defying Lou. En route to meet Orin, his other customers viciously assault him for attempting an interracial relationship. Although badly beaten, Paulie still arrives for his date with Orin. Mike reluctantly allows Angie to return home, and Flipper, unaware of his own family tragedy, unsuccessfully tries to mend his relationship with Drew. As Flipper leaves from his apartment, a young crack-addicted prostitute propositions him; in response, Flipper embraces her and cries out in anguished torment.

==Cast==
== Production ==
A few months after the murder of Yusuf K. Hawkins on August 23, 1989, Spike Lee began conceptualizing &quot;Jungle Fever&quot;, jotting down ideas and eventually organizing them into scenes on index cards. Subsequently, he commenced writing dialogue with specific actors in mind, envisioning Wesley Snipes, Ossie Davis, and John Turturro for the roles of &quot;Flipper Purify,&quot; &quot;The Good Reverend Doctor Purify,&quot; and &quot;Paulie Carbone,&quot; respectively. Lee reportedly crafted the character &quot;Vinny,&quot; Paulie&#x27;s tough friend, drawing inspiration from Joseph Fama, the teenager responsible for Hawkins&#x27; shooting. Additionally, certain aspects of architect Flipper Purify were influenced by cinematographer Ernest Dickerson, Lee&#x27;s longtime friend and collaborator, who studied architecture at Howard University.

Principal photography began on August 20, 1990, in New York City, primarily in the Harlem and Bensonhurst districts. Additional scenes were shot in Brooklyn&#x27;s Flatlands neighborhood, Greenwich Village, and at the San Gennaro street festival in Little Italy. The Manhattan offices of the Walker Group served as the backdrop for the fictional architecture firm &quot;Mast &amp; Covington.&quot; While expanding on the basic script, a significant portion of the film&#x27;s dialogue was developed during production. In a scene where &quot;Drew&quot; and her friends discuss Flipper’s infidelity, the actresses&#x27; performances were largely improvised, creating an emotionally charged conversation that left a strong impression on critics, requiring three days of rehearsal and an entire day to film.

Lee initially filmed a prologue addressing racial issues, but at the encouragement of distributor Universal Pictures, he decided to remove the &quot;offending&quot; scene from the $12.5 million production.

==Themes==
=== Racism ===
Lee dedicated the film to Yusuf Hawkins. Hawkins was killed on August 23, 1989, in Bensonhurst, New York by Italian-Americans who said the teenager was involved with a white girl in the neighborhood, though he was actually in the neighborhood to inquire about a used car for sale. According to the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, &quot;the attack had more to do with race than romance&quot;.

=== Drugs ===
In the film, Flipper&#x27;s brother, Gator, is a crack addict. He is constantly pestering his family members for money. His father has disowned him, but his mother and Flipper still occasionally give him money when he asks.

In an interview with &quot;Esquire&quot;, Jackson explains that he was able to effectively play the crack addict Gator because he had just gotten out of rehab for his own crack addiction. Because of his personal experience with the drug, Jackson was able to help Lee make Gator&#x27;s character seem more realistic by helping establish Gator&#x27;s antics and visibility in the film.

==Music==
The film&#x27;s soundtrack was by Stevie Wonder and was released by Motown Records. Although the album was created for the movie, it was released before the movie&#x27;s premiere in May 1991. It has 11 tracks, all of which are written by Stevie Wonder, except for one. Though some found Wonder&#x27;s album was unappealing, others believed that it was his best work in years.

The instrumental theme for the film is &quot;Bless the Star&quot; by Terence Blanchard. This theme was used in &quot;Mo&#x27; Better Blues&quot; previously but does not appear on either&#x27;s soundtrack.

== Release ==
=== Theatrical ===
&quot;Jungle Fever&quot; premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 16, 1991, and was released in theaters on June 7, 1991. It made $5.3 million in its opening weekend and sparked controversy among viewers. On July 7, 1991, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; published a full page of letters responding to the film and an earlier article by African-American writer Itabari Njeri, who criticized the film for perpetuating myths about interracial relationships. Film critics recognized Lee as a provocateur and praised the performances.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film garnered mostly positive reviews from critics, with particular praise for Samuel L. Jackson&#x27;s performance as crack addict Gator, which is often considered to be his breakout role. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 80% based on reviews from 49 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Jungle Fever&quot; finds Spike Lee tackling timely sociopolitical themes in typically provocative style, even if the result is sometimes ambitious to a fault.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 78% based on reviews from 24 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it three-and-a-half out of four stars and wrote: &quot;Jungle Fever contains two sequences - the girl talk and the crackhouse visit - of amazing power. It contains humor and insight and canny psychology, strong performances, and the fearless discussion of things both races would rather not face.&quot;

<doc id="167730" wikidata="Q1110102" url="?curid=167730" title="Lady Caroline Lamb (film)">
<text>Lady Caroline Lamb is a 1972 British epic romantic drama film based on the life of Lady Caroline Lamb, novelist, sometime lover of Lord Byron and wife of politician William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne (later Prime Minister). The only film written and directed by Robert Bolt, it starred his wife, Sarah Miles, as Lady Caroline, Jon Finch, Richard Chamberlain, Laurence Olivier, Ralph Richardson, John Mills, Margaret Leighton and Michael Wilding.

==Plot synopsis==
Caroline Ponsonby (Sarah Miles) accepts a marriage proposal from William Lamb (Jon Finch). Despite the misgivings of his mother, the marriage seems happy enough at first, a love match, but on their honeymoon in Italy William becomes concerned about Lady Caroline&#x27;s wilful behaviour, which leads to a man&#x27;s death. Back in England William is seen as a political &quot;coming man&quot;, respected by parliamentarians both Whig and Tory. Meanwhile Lady Caroline meets the poverty stricken Lord Byron (Richard Chamberlain), and visits his modest flat. To her husband, she claims to find Byron &quot;disturbing&quot; and that she will not see him again.

Byron has a sudden success with his long poem &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;, and becomes a wealthy celebrity, feted in society. An early literary superstar, he also becomes an object of fascination among women, some of whom write to him provocative fan letters. Lady Caroline and Byron begin a scandalous affair. Eventually he tires of her, and after she appears with Byron at a Holland House costume ball as a black slave, half naked and covered in greasepaint, she finds herself humiliated and a figure of derision in society.

At the ball, Byron becomes interested in another woman, his future wife, Anne Isabella Millbanke (Silvia Monti). Lady Caroline&#x27;s behaviour becomes more bizarre when, dressed as a coach boy, she stalks Byron to a ceremonial dinner commemorating Wellington&#x27;s victory against the French. Crashing the gathering, she interrupts Byron and Millbanke, cutting her forearm with a knife. William is taken to meet King George IV, who pressures him to leave Lady Caroline so he can take up the prestigious post of Chief Secretary for Ireland, but William is reluctant to abandon her.

Lady Caroline&#x27;s mental health has deteriorated further but, with the support of her husband, she appears to recover. However, after she understands that her notoriety is undermining her husband&#x27;s career, her wilfulness returns. She flees to France, where she has a brief affair with Wellington. Spurned by him, she returns to England and prepares a legal separation, with the approval of William&#x27;s mother. Lady Caroline descends further into despair and illness, dying apparently from a broken heart.

==Background==
The film was the directorial debut of screenwriter Robert Bolt and starred his wife Sarah Miles in the title role. Bolt said he was attracted to the story of Lamb because it &quot;was funny, touching and entertaining&quot; and felt the movie was about &quot;the struggle between the romantics of the world and the classicists... The classical, ignoble view of life, as espoused by Wellington in the film, keep society going... but it&#x27;s the romantics, like Caroline, who drive life, who instigate new ideas, and who often are the true geniuses.&quot;

Bolt wrote the script as a vehicle for Miles and decided to direct himself. Fernando Ghia agreed to produce. Bolt said it was difficult to raise finance because people said they had not heard of Lady Caroline Lamb. In July 1971 it was announced the film, then called &quot;Lamb&quot; would be the first film financed by Tomorrow Entertainment, a subsidiary of General Electric, in association with Pulsar Productions and Vides Cinematographa of Rome. Richard Chamberlain and Sarah Miles would star, with cameos from Laurence Olivier, Margaret Leighton and John Mills.

However these plans fell through. Eventually finance was raised from Anglo-EMI and General Electric, along with Franco Cristaldi in Italy. Bolt had to waive all his fee in order to keep artistic control. EMI&#x27;s investment, through Nat Cohen, was reportedly £250,000 and was covered by pre-sales overseas.

Timothy Dalton was originally cast as Lamb. However Bolt then decided to cast Jon Finch in the role. Dalton sued and won damages.

&quot;I&#x27;ve been playing zanies and eccentrics for the past few years,&quot; said Chamberlain, &quot;so Byron is new for me. He was like this incredible pop star.&quot;

==Production==
Filming started 20 September 1971 at Pinewood Studios. By that stage Bolt said he had been working on the film for ten months.

&quot;I&#x27;m not a good director but I know what the author intended&quot;, said Bolt. He elected to use new collaborators rather than David Lean&#x27;s crew apart from Norman Savage, who died shortly after the film premiered. Filming was plagued by the presence of David Whiting who was working as an assistant to Miles and Bolt.

One scene was cut after it earned the film an X-Certificate; Bolt refused to re-shoot it, which meant that several crucial moments of exposition, much of it necessary for understanding the film&#x27;s narrative, were left out.

Bolt did not direct another film. &quot;Never again&quot;, he remarked years later.

The film is also notable because it is the last film in which Michael Wilding appeared, in a cameo with his last wife, Margaret Leighton, who played Lady Melbourne. The film score was composed by Richard Rodney Bennett, who later based a concert work, &quot;Elegy for Lady Caroline Lamb&quot; for viola and orchestra, on some of the material.

==Reception==
===Critical===
Praise came for Laurence Olivier&#x27;s cameo as the Duke of Wellington, with Philip French of &quot;The Times&quot; writing that &quot;... Olivier&#x27;s brief appearance as the Duke of Wellington is a beautifully witty and rounded characterization that is worth the price of the admission in itself&quot;.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;beautiful but dumb.&quot;

Pauline Kael felt Bolt &quot;thrashes about from one style and point of view to another. The film seems to have been made by a square Ken Russell; Bolt tries for romantic excess, but he can’t get anything warmed up. His Caroline Lamb is an hysterical fool but also a misunderstood free spirit struggling against a hypocritical society—a sort of Regency Zelda. Sarah Miles acts like a dizzy shopgirl dreaming of being a great lady, and falling flat even in her dreams; as Byron, Richard Chamberlain scowls and sneers.&quot;

===Box office===
The film was one of the most popular films of 1973 at the British box office. In November 1973 Nat Cohen of Anglo-EMI said &quot;we&#x27;ve done very well with &quot;Lady Caroline Lamb&quot; which turned out to be popular entertainment.&quot; However the film was a commercial disappointment in the US. Bolt and Ghia would collaborate again on &quot;The Mission&quot;.

===Awards===
It was nominated for three BAFTA awards.

<text>Lady Caroline Lamb (née Ponsonby; 13 November 1785 – 25 January 1828) was an Anglo-Irish aristocrat and novelist, best known for &quot;Glenarvon&quot;, a Gothic novel. In 1812, she had an affair with Lord Byron, whom she described as &quot;mad, bad, and dangerous to know&quot;. Her husband was the Honourable William Lamb, who after her death became 2nd Viscount Melbourne and British prime minister.

==Family background==
Lamb was the only daughter of Frederick Ponsonby, 3rd Earl of Bessborough, an Anglo-Irish peer, and Henrietta, Countess of Bessborough. She was known as the Honourable Caroline Ponsonby until her father succeeded to the earldom in 1793. While her brother, Frederick Ponsonby, was severely injured in the Battle of Waterloo, in the days after the battle, she had an affair with the Duke of Wellington. She was related to other leading society ladies and was the niece of Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, and cousin (by marriage) of Annabella, Lady Byron. She was related to Sarah Ponsonby, one half of the Ladies of Llangollen, and Diana, Princess of Wales.

She was never Viscountess Melbourne because she died before Melbourne succeeded to the peerage.

==Youth and education==
As a small child, Lamb was considered delicate and for her health spent much time in the country. She travelled with her mother and other family to Italy, where she recovered from an illness caused by worms that nearly ended her life. After returning with her mother to England, she rejoined a lively group of children who lived at Devonshire House and Roehampton, her cousins, the children of William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire: by his first marriage, to Lady Georgiana Spencer, three children, Lady Georgiana (&quot;Little G&quot;), Lady Harriet Cavendish (&quot;Hary-o&quot;), and Lord Hartington (&quot;Hart&quot;, later the 6th Duke of Devonshire); and by his mistress and second wife, Lady Elizabeth Foster, two children, Augustus Clifford and Caroline St Jules, later wife of George Lamb. During childhood, she became particularly close to Lady Harriet, who was only three months older than her. Her behaviour reportedly grew increasingly troublesome to her family, and she experimented with sedatives like laudanum and had a special governess to control her.

Lady Morgan reported in her memoirs that Lady Caroline told her that she had grown up as a tomboy and was unable to read or write until adolescence. 
As a child, Lady Caroline considered being able to wash a dog one of her most satisfying accomplishments. While many scholars have accepted that (and other melodramatic claims made by Lady Morgan), published works of correspondence about her family members make it extremely unlikely. The grandmother she shared with her Cavendish cousins, the Dowager Lady Spencer, was zealously dedicated to promoting education and later employed their governess as her own companion. The governess was Miss Selina Trimmer, the daughter of Mrs Sarah Trimmer, a well-known and respected author of moral tales for children. She taught them an extensive curriculum, considerably beyond mere literacy. There is a published letter that Lady Caroline wrote on 31 October 1796 (just before her eleventh birthday) that not only demonstrates her literacy but also shows a merciless wit and talent for mimicry.

Lady Caroline was exceptionally well educated at home. She also attended a school in Hans Place, Knightsbridge, London, the successor to Reading Abbey Girls&#x27; School, where she was taught by Frances Arabella Rowden. Rowden was not only a published poet, but also, according to another pupil, Mary Russell Mitford, &quot;she had a knack of making poetesses of her pupils&quot;.

In her early adult years, Lady Caroline not only wrote prose and poetry, but also took to sketching portraiture. She spoke French and Italian fluently, was skilled at Greek and Latin and also enjoyed music and drama.

==Marriage and family==

In June 1805, at the age of nineteen, Lady Caroline Ponsonby married William Lamb, a rising politician and heir to the 1st Viscount Melbourne. Although their meeting had been shrewdly orchestrated by William Lamb&#x27;s mother, theirs was a love match. The couple had become &quot;mutually captivated&quot; during a visit to Brocket Hall in 1802 and for many years the pair enjoyed a happy marriage. In 1809, his brother George married her namesake cousin Caroline St Jules.

Caroline gave birth to a stillborn child in January 1806, and she and William later had a son, George Augustus Frederick, born on 11 August 1807, and a premature daughter, born in 1809, who died within 24 hours. Lady Caroline suffered long recovery periods after each birth.

Her son was born with severe mental problems. Although most aristocratic families typically sent such relatives to institutions, the Lambs cared for their son at home until his eventual death in 1836, eight years after Lady Caroline&#x27;s death. The stress of their son&#x27;s ill health, combined with William Lamb&#x27;s consuming career ambitions, drove a wedge between the couple. A further difficulty was that William&#x27;s siblings all detested Caroline, whom they called &quot;the little beast&quot;, and she and her mother-in-law had hated each other from the start. Their lifelong enmity was reportedly a great cause of unhappiness to Caroline.

==Relationship with Lord Byron==
From March to August 1812, Lady Caroline embarked on a well-publicised affair with Lord Byron. He was 24, and she was 26. She spurned his attention on their first meeting, which was at a society event at Holland House. According to the memoirs of her friend Sydney, Lady Morgan, Lady Caroline claimed she coined the phrase &quot;mad, bad, and dangerous to know&quot; soon after she had met the poet. It became his lasting epitaph, but there is no contemporary evidence to prove that she coined the famous phrase at the time. She wrote him a fan letter. His response was to visit her because of her high social status and then to pursue her passionately.

Lady Caroline and Lord Byron publicly decried each other as they privately pledged their love over the following months. Byron referred to Lamb as &quot;Caro&quot;, which she adopted as her public nickname. After Byron ended the affair, her husband took Lady Caroline to Ireland. The distance did not cool Lady Caroline&#x27;s interest in the poet, and she and Byron corresponded constantly during her exile. When Lady Caroline returned to London in 1813, however, Byron made it clear that he had no intention of restarting their relationship. That spurred increasingly-public attempts to reunite with her former lover. Matters came to a head at a ball in honour of the Duke of Wellington when Byron publicly insulted Lady Caroline, who responded by breaking a wine glass and trying to slash her wrists. She did not seriously injure herself, and it is most unlikely that she had any suicidal intentions, but her reputation was damaged and her mental stability was questioned. Byron himself referred to it as a theatrical performance: &quot;Lady Caroline performed the dagger scene&quot; (a reference to &quot;Macbeth&quot;).

Lady Caroline&#x27;s obsession with Byron would define much of her later life, as well as influencing both her and Byron&#x27;s works. They would write poems in the style of each other about each other and even embed overt messages to one another in their verse. After a thwarted visit to Byron&#x27;s home, Lady Caroline wrote &quot;Remember Me!&quot; into the flyleaf of one of Byron&#x27;s books. He responded with the hate poem: &quot;Remember thee! Remember thee!; Till Lethe quench life&#x27;s burning stream; Remorse and shame shall cling to thee, And haunt thee like a feverish dream! Remember thee! Ay, doubt it not. Thy husband too shall think of thee! By neither shalt thou be forgot, Thou false to him, thou fiend to me!&quot;

Her cousin Harriet (now Lady Granville) with whom Lady Caroline&#x27;s relationship had deteriorated after childhood, visited her in December 1816 and was so incredulous at her unrepentant behaviour that she ended her description of the visit in a letter to her sister, &quot;I mean my visits to be annual&quot;.

==Literary career==
Lady Caroline Lamb was noted to have been involved in a few different literary circles that met in the Holland House, Lady Charleville&#x27;s, Lord Ward&#x27;s, Lord Lansdowne&#x27;s and others of similar repute.Lady Caroline&#x27;s most famous work is &quot;Glenarvon&quot;, a Gothic novel that was released in 1816 just weeks after Byron&#x27;s departure from England. Although published anonymously, Lady Caroline&#x27;s authorship was an open secret. It featured a thinly disguised pen-picture of herself and her former lover, who was painted as a war hero who turns traitor against Irish nationalism. The book was notable for featuring the first version of the Byronic hero outside of Byron&#x27;s own work as well as a detailed scrutiny of the Romantic period and, more specifically, the Ton. Lady Caroline included scathing caricatures of several of those prominent society members. One of them, the Countess of Jersey, cancelled Lady Caroline&#x27;s vouchers to Almack&#x27;s in retribution for her characterisations. This was the opening salvo in a backlash that found Lady Caroline outcast from fashionable society: although her sister-in-law, Emily Lamb, Countess Cowper, got Lady Caroline readmitted to Almack&#x27;s in 1819, her reputation never fully recovered.

Byron responded to the novel; &quot;I read &quot;Glenarvon&quot; too by Caro Lamb….God damn!&quot; The book was a financial success that sold out several editions but was dismissed by critics as pulp fiction. However, Goethe deemed it worthy of serious literary consideration.

In 1819, Lady Caroline mimicked Byron&#x27;s style in the narrative poem &quot;A New Canto&quot;. Years before, Lady Caroline had impersonated Byron in a letter to his publishers to have them send her a portrait of Byron. It worked, and the tone and substance of her request fooled them into sending the painting. She used that skill to respond to Byron&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan I and II&quot;. Lady Caroline was most concerned with the allusions Byron had made about her; for example, the line &quot;Some play the devil—and then write a novel&quot; from &quot;Don Juan II&quot;. In &quot;A New Canto&quot;, Lady Caroline wrote—as Byron—&quot;I&#x27;m sick of fame; I&#x27;m gorged with it; so full I almost could regret the happier hour; When northern oracles proclaimed me dull.&quot; Byron never publicly responded to the poem. A reviewer of the time opined, in part; &quot;The writer of this lively nonsense has evidently intended it as an imitation of Lord Byron. It is a rhapsody from beginning to end.&quot;

Lady Caroline published three additional novels during her lifetime: &quot;Graham Hamilton&quot; (1822), &quot;Ada Reis&quot; (1823), and &quot;Penruddock&quot; (1823).

==Later life and death==

Byron&#x27;s confidante and close friend was his wife&#x27;s maternal aunt, William Lamb&#x27;s own mother, the colourful Elizabeth Lamb, Viscountess Melbourne. Lady Melbourne had been instrumental in bringing about the politically-advantageous marriage of her son to Lady Caroline, despite disliking both her and her mother.

However, once Lady Caroline had begun her affair with Byron, her mother-in-law began a long and blatant campaign to rid her son of his wife. As Lord David Cecil remarks, she had long since concluded that Caroline deserved all her misfortunes. William Lamb refused to submit and regretted that his mother had conspired against his wife with Byron. Calling Byron treacherous, William Lamb was supportive of his wife to her death.

Ultimately, it was Lady Caroline who prevailed on her husband to agree to a formal separation in 1825. Both parties had had numerous extramarital affairs by then, and Lamb had long been known to eschew duplicity. She took up permanent residence at Brocket Hall. Her struggle with mental illness became more pronounced in her last years and was complicated by her abuse of alcohol and laudanum. By 1827, she was under the care of a full-time physician as her body, which had always been frail, began to shut down and she retained fluids (a condition then known as dropsy, and now known as oedema). William Lamb was now Chief Secretary for Ireland and made a perilous crossing to be by her side when Lady Caroline died on 25 January 1828.

Lady Caroline was buried in the graveyard of St Etheldreda&#x27;s Church in Hatfield; her husband was later buried within the church.

==In popular culture==

The 1905 novel &quot;The Marriage of William Ashe&quot; by Mary Augusta Ward was based on Lady Caroline and her husband.

The 1964 historical novel &quot;This for Caroline&quot; by Doris Leslie is based on her life.

In 1972, the film &quot;Lady Caroline Lamb&quot; was released with Sarah Miles in the lead role and Richard Chamberlain as Byron.

In 2003, the BBC broadcast &quot;Byron&quot; with Jonny Lee Miller in the title role and Camilla Power as Lady Caroline Lamb.

<text>Iranian Georgians or Persian Georgians (; ) are Iranian citizens who are ethnically Georgian, and are an ethnic group living in Iran. Today&#x27;s Georgia was a subject of Iran in ancient times under the Achaemenid and Sassanian empires and from the 16th century till the early 19th century, starting with the Safavids in power and later Qajars. Shah Abbas I, his predecessors, and successors, relocated by force hundreds of thousands of Christian, and Jewish Georgians as part of his programs to reduce the power of the Qizilbash, develop industrial economy, strengthen the military, and populate newly built towns in various places in Iran including the provinces of Isfahan (Fereydan, Fereydunshahr, and Buin-Miandasht ), Mazandaran, Gilan, Semnan, Fars, Azerbaijan, Khorasan and Khuzestan. A certain number of these, among them members of the nobility, also migrated voluntarily over the centuries, as well as some that moved as muhajirs in the 19th century to Iran, following the Russian conquest of the Caucasus. The Georgian community of Fereydunshahr have retained their distinct Georgian identity to this day, despite adopting certain aspects of Iranian culture such as the Persian language.

== History ==
===Safavid era===

Most likely, the first extant community of Georgians within Iran was formed following Shah Tahmasp I&#x27;s invasions of Georgia and the rest of the Caucasus, in which he deported some 30,000 Georgians and other Caucasians back to mainland Safavid Iran. The first genuine compact Georgian settlements however appeared in Iran in the 1610s when Shah Abbas I relocated some two hundred thousand from their historical homeland, eastern Georgian provinces of Kakheti and Kartli, following a punitive campaign he conducted against his formerly most loyal Georgian servants, namely Teimuraz I of Kakheti and Luarsab II of Kartli. Most of modern-day Iranian Georgians are the latter&#x27;s descendants, although the first large movements of Georgians from the Caucasus to the heartland of the Safavid empire in Iran happened as early as during the rule of Tahmasp I. Subsequent waves of large deportations after Abbas also occurred throughout the rest of the 17th, but also the 18th and 19th centuries, the last ones by the Qajar dynasty. A certain amount also migrated as muhajirs in the 19th century to Iran, following the Russian conquest of the Caucasus. 
The Georgian deportees were settled by the Shah&#x27;s government into the scarcely populated lands which were quickly made by their new inhabitants into the lively agricultural areas. Many of these new settlements were given Georgian names, reflecting the toponyms found in Georgia. During the Safavid era, Georgia became so politically and somewhat culturally intertwined with Iran that Georgians replaced the Qizilbash among the Safavid officials, alongside the Circassians and Armenians.

During his travels the Italian adventurer Pietro Della Valle claimed that there was no household in Persia without its Georgian slaves, noticing the huge amounts of Georgians present everywhere in society. The later Safavid capital, Isfahan, was home to many Georgians. Many of the city&#x27;s inhabitants were of Georgian, Circassian, and Daghistani descent. Engelbert Kaempfer, who was in Safavid Persia in 1684-85, estimated their number at 20,000. Following an agreement between Shah Abbas I and his Georgian subject Teimuraz I of Kakheti (&quot;Tahmuras Khan&quot;), whereby the latter submitted to Safavid rule in exchange for being allowed to rule as the region&#x27;s wāli (governor) and for having his son serve as dāruḡa (&quot;prefect&quot;) of Isfahan in perpetuity, a Georgian prince converted to Islam served as governor. He was accompanied by a certain number of soldiers, and they spoke in Georgian among themselves. There must also have been some Georgian Orthodox Christians. The royal court in Isfahan had a great number of Georgian ḡolāms (military slaves) as well as Georgian women. Although they spoke Persian or Turkic, their mother tongue was Georgian.

During the last days of the Safavid empire, the Safavids arch enemy, namely the neighboring Ottoman Turks, as well as neighboring Imperial Russia, but also the tribal Afghans from the far off easternmost regions of the empire took advantage of Iranian internal weakness and invaded Iran.
The Iranian Georgian contribution in wars against the invading Afghans was crucial. Georgians fought in the battle of Golnabad, and in the battle of Fereydunshahr. In the latter battle they brought a humiliating defeat to the Afghan army.

In total, the Persian sources mention that during the Safavid era 225,000 Georgians were transplanted to mainland Iran during the first two centuries, while the Georgian sources keep this number at 245,000.

===Afsharid era===

During the Afsharid dynasty, 5,000 Georgian families were moved to mainland Iran according to the Persian sources, while the Georgian sources keep it on 30,000 persons.

===Qajar era===

During the Qajar dynasty, the last Iranian empire that would, despite very briefly, have effective control over Georgia, 15,000 Georgians were moved to Iran according to the Persian sources, while the Georgian ones mention 22,000 persons. This last large wave of Georgian movement and settlement towards mainland Iran happened as a result of the Battle of Krtsanisi in 1795.

===Modern Iran===
Despite their isolation from Georgia, many Georgians have preserved their language and some traditions, but embraced Islam. The ethnographer Lado Aghniashvili was first from Georgia to visit this community in 1890.

In the aftermath of World War I, the Georgian minority in Iran was caught in the pressures of the rising Cold War. In 1945, this compact ethnic community, along with other ethnic minorities that populated northern Iran, came to the attention of the Soviet as a possible instrument for fomenting unrest in Iranian domestic politics. While the Soviet Georgian leadership wanted to repatriate them to Georgia, Moscow clearly preferred to keep them in Iran. The Soviet plans were abandoned only after Joseph Stalin realized that his plans to obtain influence in northern Iran foiled by both Iranian stubbornness and United States pressure.

In June 2004, the new Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, became the first Georgian politician to have visited the Iranian Georgian community in Fereydunshahr. Thousands of local Georgians gave the delegation a warm welcome, which included waving of the newly adopted Georgian national flag with its five crosses. Saakashvili who stressed that the Iranian Georgians have historically played an important role in defending Iran put flowers on the graves of the Iranian Georgian dead of the eight years long Iran–Iraq War.

==Notable Georgians of Iran==

Many Iranian military commanders and administrators were (Islamized) Georgians. Many members of the Safavid and Qajar dynasties and nobility had Georgian blood. In fact, the heavily mixed Safavid dynasty (1501-1736) was of partial Georgian origins from its very beginning.

===List of Iranian Georgians===

Military: Allahverdi Khan, Otar Beg Orbeliani, Rustam Khan the &quot;sipahsalar&quot;, Imam-Quli Khan, Yusef Khan-e Gorji, Grigor Mikeladze, Konstantin Mikeladze, Daud Khan Undiladze, Rustam Khan the &quot;qullar-aqasi&quot;, Eskandar Mirza (d. 1711), Bektash of Kakheti, Kaikhosro of Kartli, Shah-Quli Khan (Levan of Kartli), Eskandar Mirza (Prince Aleksandre of Georgia), Prince Rostom of Kartli, Vsevolod Starosselsky

Others: Undiladze, Mahmoud Karimi Sibaki

The names of actors Cyrus Gorjestani and Sima Gorjestani, as well as the late Nematollah Gorji, suggest that they are/were (at least from the paternal side) of Georgian origin. Reza Shah Pahlavi&#x27;s mother was a Georgian muhajir, who most likely came to mainland Persia after Persia was forced to cede all of its territories in the Caucasus following the Russo-Persian Wars several decades prior to Reza Shah&#x27;s birth.

==Geographic distribution, language and culture==
The Georgian language is still used by a minority of people in Iran. The center of Georgians in Iran is Fereydunshahr, a small city, 150 km to the west of Isfahan in the area historically known as Fereydan. In this area there are 10 Georgian towns and villages around Fereydunshahr. In this region the old Georgian identity is retained the best compared to other places in Iran, and most people speak and understand the Georgian language there.

There were other compact settlements in Khorasan at Abbas Abad (half-way between Shahrud and Sabzevar where there remained only one old woman who remembered Georgian in 1934), Mazandaran at Behshahr and Farah Abad, Gilan, Isfahan Province at Najafabad, Badrud, Rahmatabad, Yazdanshahr and Amir Abad. These areas are frequently called Gorji Mahalleh (&quot;Georgian neighborhood&quot;). Many Georgians or Iranians of partial Georgian descent are also scattered in major Iranian cities, such as Tehran, Isfahan, Rasht, Dezful, Karaj and Shiraz. 

Most of these communities no longer speak the Georgian language, but retain aspects of Georgian culture and keep a Georgian conscious. Some argue that Iranian Georgians retain remnants of Christian traditions, but there is no evidence for this. Most Georgians in Fereydunshahr and Fereydan speak and understand Georgian. Iranian Georgians observe the Shia traditions and also non-religious traditions similar to other people in Iran. They observe the traditions of Nowruz.

The local self-designation of Georgians in Iran, like the rest of the Georgians over the world is &quot;Kartveli&quot; (, from Kartvelebi, Georgian: ქართველები, namely &quot;Georgians&quot;), although occasionally the ethnonyms Gorj, Gorji, or even Gurj-i (from Persian &quot;Gorji&quot; which means Georgian). They call their language Kartuli (Georgian: ქართული). As Rezvani states, this is not surprising given that all other Georgian dialects in Iran are extinct.

The number of Georgians in Iran is estimated to be over 100,000. According to Encyclopaedia Georgiana (1986) some 12,000–14,000 lived in rural Fereydan c. 1896, and a more recent estimation cited by Rezvani (published 2009, written in 2008) states that there may be more than 61,000 Georgians in Fereydan. Modern-day estimations regarding the number of Iranian Georgians are that they compose over 100,000. They are also the largest Caucasus-derived group in the nation, ahead of the Circassians.

<text>An insult is an expression, statement, or behavior that is often deliberately disrespectful, offensive, scornful, or derogatory towards an individual or a group. 
Insults can be intentional or unintentional, and they often aim to belittle, offend, or humiliate the target. While intentional insults can sometimes include factual information, they are typically presented in a pejorative manner, intended to provoke a negative emotional response or have a harmful reaction effect when used harmfully. Insults can also be made unintentionally or in a playful way but could in some cases also have negative impacts and effects even when they were not intended to insult.

Insults can have varying impacts, effects, and meanings depending on intent, use, recipient&#x27;s understanding of the meaning, and intent behind the action or words, and social setting and social norms including cultural references and meanings.

==History==
In ancient Rome, political speeches and debates were known to include strong harshness and personal attacks. Historians suggest that insults and verbal attacks were common in the political discourse of the time. This practice reflected the highly confrontational nature of political engagement in ancient Rome.

Many religious texts and beliefs have also contributed to views on insults and the implications of making insults in anger. Buddhism teaches &#x27;Right Speech&#x27; is a part of the Noble Eightfold Path.

In Christianity, for example, the Sermon on the Mount delivered by Jesus includes teachings on the significance of anger. Jesus emphasized the importance of managing one&#x27;s emotions and non judgment in this example.

In addition to political contexts, history also reveals unusual instances of insults. The Cadaver Synod, was an event where Pope Stephen VI held a posthumous trial for Pope Formosus in 897 AD. Stephen became the Pope after Pope Formosus and had his body dug up, dressed, and placed on a throne to stand trial even after his death.

==Unintentional Insults==
An example of an unintentional insult may be not tasting a dessert made by a host. 
Comments made carelessly can also become unintentional insults. Another example could include comments made carelessly about facial features, personality traits, personal taste (e.g. in music), underestimating personal abilities or interests, asking about involvement in something potentially creating stereotypes, jokes, or even walking away from someone outside are among some things that may cause offence accidentally.

==Jocular exchange==
Lacan considered insults a primary form of social interaction, central to the imaginary order – &quot;a situation that is symbolized in the &#x27;Yah-boo, so are you&#x27; of the transitivist quarrel, the original form of aggressive communication&quot;.

Erving Goffman points out that every &quot;crack or remark set up the possibility of a counter-riposte, topper, or squelch, that is, a comeback&quot;. He cites the example of possible interchanges at a dance in a school gym:
== Backhanded compliments ==
A backhanded (or left-handed) compliment, or , is an insult that is disguised as, or accompanied by, a , especially in situations where the belittling or condescension is intentional.

Examples of backhanded compliments include, but are not limited to:

*&quot;I did not expect you to ace that exam. Good for you.&quot;, which could impugn the target&#x27;s success as a fluke.
*&quot;That skirt makes you look far thinner.&quot;, insinuating hidden fat, with the implication that fat is something to be ashamed of.
*&quot;I wish I could be as straightforward as you, but I always try to get along with everyone.&quot;, insinuating an overbearing attitude.
*&quot;I like you. You have the boldness of a much younger person.&quot;, insinuating decline with age.

Negging is a type of backhanded compliment used for emotional manipulation or as a seduction method. The term was coined and prescribed by pickup artists. Negging is often viewed as a straightforward insult rather than as a pick-up line, in spite of the fact that proponents of the technique traditionally stress it is not an insult.

==Personal attacks==
A personal attack is an insult which is directed at some attribute of the person.

The Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s personal attack rule defined a personal attack as one made upon the honesty, character, integrity, or like personal qualities in the Communications Act of 1934.

Personal attacks are generally considered a fallacy when used in arguments since they do not attempt to debunk the opposing sides argument, rather attacking the qualities of a person.

==Sexuality==
Verbal insults often take a phallic or pudendal form. This includes profanity, and may also include insults to one&#x27;s sexuality. There are also insults pertaining to the extent of one&#x27;s sexual activity. For example, according to James Bloodworth, &quot;incel&quot; “has gradually crept into the vocabulary of every internet troll, sometimes being used against men who blame and harass women for not wanting to sleep with them.” 

==Entertainment==
Insults in poetic form is practiced throughout history, more often as entertainment rather than maliciousness. Flyting is a contest consisting of the exchange of insults between two parties, often conducted in verse and became public entertainment in Scotland in the 15th and 16th centuries. Senna is a form of Old Norse Eddic poetry consisting of an exchange of insults between participants.

O du eselhafter Peierl (Oh, you asinine Peierl), composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, was meant for fun, mocking, scatological humor directed at a friend of Mozart&#x27;s.

More modern versions include poetry slam, dozens, diss song and battle rap. In the 1980s &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; franchise, the character of Skeletor became known for insulting those around him with comedic putdowns. There is also now a comedy genre of insult comedy.

==Anatomies==
Various typologies of insults have been proposed over the years. Ethologist Desmond Morris, noting that &quot;almost any action can operate as an Insult Signal if it is performed out of its appropriate context – at the wrong time or in the wrong place&quot;, classes such signals in ten &quot;basic categories&quot;:
# Uninterest signals
# Boredom signals
# Impatience signals
# Superiority signals
# Deformed-compliment signals
# Mock-discomfort signals
# Rejection signals
# Mockery signals
# Symbolic insults
# Dirt signals

Elizabethans took great interest in such analyses, distinguishing out, for example, the &quot;fleering frump ... when we give a mock with a scornful countenance as in some smiling sort looking aside or by drawing the lip awry, or shrinking up the nose&quot;. Shakespeare humorously set up an insult-hierarchy of seven-fold &quot;degrees. The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct&quot;.

==Perceptions==
What qualifies as an insult is also determined both by the individual social situation and by changing social mores. Thus on one hand the insulting &quot;obscene invitations of a man to a strange girl can be the spicy endearments of a husband to his wife&quot;.

<text>Hydrographic survey is the science of measurement and description of features which affect maritime navigation, marine construction, dredging, offshore wind farms, offshore oil exploration and drilling and related activities. Surveys may also be conducted to determine the route of subsea cables such as telecommunications cables, cables associated with wind farms, and HVDC power cables. Strong emphasis is placed on soundings, shorelines, tides, currents, seabed and submerged obstructions that relate to the previously mentioned activities. The term &quot;hydrography&quot; is used synonymously to describe &quot;maritime cartography&quot;, which in the final stages of the hydrographic process uses the raw data collected through hydrographic survey into information usable by the end user.

Hydrography is collected under rules which vary depending on the acceptance authority. Traditionally conducted by ships with a sounding line or echo sounding, surveys are increasingly conducted with the aid of aircraft and sophisticated electronic sensor systems in shallow waters.

Offshore survey is a specific discipline of hydrographic survey primarily concerned with the description of the condition of the seabed and the condition of the subsea oilfield infrastructure that interacts with it.

==Organizations==

===National and international offices===

Hydrographic offices evolved from naval heritage and are usually found within national naval structures, for example Spain&#x27;s Instituto Hidrográfico de la Marina. Coordination of those organizations and product standardization is voluntarily joined with the goal of improving hydrography and safe navigation is conducted by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO). The IHO publishes Standards and Specifications followed by its Member States as well as Memoranda of Understanding and Co-operative Agreements with hydrographic survey interests.

The product of such hydrography is most often seen on nautical charts published by the national agencies and required by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and national regulations to be carried on vessels for safety purposes. Increasingly those charts are provided and used in electronic form unders IHO standards.

===Non-national agencies===
Governmental entities below the national level conduct or contract for hydrographic surveys for waters within their jurisdictions with both internal and contract assets. Such surveys commonly are conducted by national organizations or under their supervision or the standards they have approved, particularly when the use is for the purposes of chart making and distribution or the dredging of state-controlled waters.

In the United States, there is coordination with the National Hydrography Dataset in survey collection and publication. State environmental organizations publish hydrographic data relating to their mission.

=== Private organizations ===
Commercial entities also conduct large-scale hydrographic and geophysical surveying, particularly in the dredging, marine construction, oil exploration, and drilling industries. Industrial entities installing submarine communications cables or power require detailed surveys of cable routes prior to installation and increasingly use acoustic imagery equipment previously found only in military applications when conducting their surveys. Specialized companies exist that have both the equipment and expertise to contract with both commercial and governmental entities to perform such surveys .

Companies, universities, and investment groups will often fund hydrographic surveys of public waterways prior to developing areas adjacent those waterways. Survey firms are also contracted to survey in support of design and engineering firms that are under contract for large public projects. Private surveys are also conducted before dredging operations and after these operations are completed. Companies with large private slips, docks, or other waterfront installations have their facilities and the open water near their facilities surveyed regularly, as do islands in areas subject to variable erosion such as in the Maldives.

==Methods==
===Lead lines and sounding poles===
The history of hydrographic surveying dates almost as far back as that of sailing. For many centuries, a hydrographic survey required the use of lead lines – ropes or lines with depth markings attached to lead weights to make one end sink to the bottom when lowered over the side of a ship or boat – and sounding poles, which were poles with depth markings which could be thrust over the side until they touched bottom. In either case, the depths measured had to be read manually and recorded, as did the position of each measurement with regard to mapped reference points as determined by three-point sextant fixes. The process was labor-intensive and time-consuming and, although each individual depth measurement could be accurate, even a thorough survey as a practical matter could include only a limited number of sounding measurements relative to the area being surveyed, inevitably leaving gaps in coverage between soundings.

===Wire-drag surveying===
In 1904, wire-drag surveys were introduced into hydrography, and the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey′s Nicholas H. Heck played a prominent role in developing and perfecting the technique between 1906 and 1916. In the wire-drag method, a wire attached to two ships or boats and set at a certain depth by a system of weights and buoys was dragged between two points. If the wire encountered an obstruction, it would become taut and form a &quot;V&quot; shape. The location of the &quot;V&quot; revealed the position of submerged rocks, wrecks, and other obstructions, while the depth at which the wire was set showed the depth at which the obstruction was encountered. This method revolutionized hydrographic surveying, as it allowed a quicker, less laborious, and far more complete survey of an area than did the use of lead lines and sounding poles. From a navigational safety point of view, a wire-drag survey would not miss a hazard to navigation that projected above the drag wire depth.
Prior to the advent of sidescan sonar, wire-drag surveying was the only method for searching large areas for obstructions and lost vessels and aircraft. Between 1906 and 1916, Heck expanded the capability of wire-drag systems from a relatively limited area to sweeps covering channels in width. The wire-drag technique was a major contribution to hydrographic surveying during much of the rest of the 20th century. So valuable was wire-drag surveying in the United States that for decades the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, and later the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, fielded a pair of sister ships of identical design specifically to work together on such surveys. USC&amp;GS &quot;Marindin&quot; and USC&amp;GS &quot;Ogden&quot; conducted wire-drag surveys together from 1919 to 1942, USC&amp;GS &quot;Hilgard&quot; (ASV 82) and USC&amp;GS &quot;Wainwright&quot; (ASV 83) took over from 1942 to 1967, and USC&amp;GS &quot;Rude&quot; (ASV 90) (later NOAAS &quot;Rude&quot; (S 590)) and USC&amp;GS &quot;Heck&quot; (ASV 91) (later NOAAS &quot;Heck&quot; (S 591)) worked together on wire-drag operations from 1967.

The rise of new electronic technologies – sidescan sonar and multibeam swath systems – in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s eventually made the wire-drag system obsolete. Sidescan sonar could create images of underwater obstructions with the same fidelity as aerial photography, while multibeam systems could generate depth data for 100 percent of the bottom in a surveyed area. These technologies allowed a single vessel to do what wire-drag surveying required two vessels to do, and wire-drag surveys finally came to an end in the early 1990s. Vessels were freed from working together on wire-drag surveys, and in the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), for example, &quot;Rude&quot; and &quot;Heck&quot; operated independently in their later years.

===Single-beam echosounders===
Single-beam echosounders and fathometers began to enter service in the 1930s which used sonar to measure the depth beneath a vessel. This greatly increased the speed of acquiring sounding data over that possible with lead lines and sounding poles by allowing information on depths beneath a vessel to be gathered in a series of lines spaced at a specified distance. However, it shared the weakness of earlier methods by lacking depth information for areas in between the strips of sea bottom the vessel sounded.

===Multibeam Echosounders===

A multibeam echosounder (MBES) is a type of sonar that is used to map the seabed. It emits acoustic waves in a fan shape beneath its transceiver. The time it takes for the sound waves to reflect off the seabed and return to the receiver is used to calculate the water depth. Unlike other sonars and echo sounders, MBES uses beamforming to extract directional information from the returning soundwaves, producing a swath of depth soundings from a single ping.

Explicit inclusion of phraseology like: &quot;For all MBES surveys for LINZ, high resolution, geo-referenced backscatter intensity is to be logged and rendered as a survey deliverable.&quot; in a set of contract survey requirements, is a clear indication that the wider hydrographic community is embracing the benefits that can be accrued by employing MBES technology and, in particular, are accepting as a fact that a MBES which provides acoustic backscatter data is a valuable tool of the trade.

The introduction of multispectral multibeam echosounders continues the trajectory of technological innovations providing the hydrographic surveying community with better tools for more rapidly acquiring better data for multiple uses. A multispectral multibeam echosounder is the culmination of many progressive advances in hydrography from the early days of acoustic soundings when the primary concern about the strength of returning echoes from the bottom was whether, or not, they would be sufficiently large to be noted (detected). The operating frequencies of the early acoustic sounders were primarily based on the ability of magneostrictive and piezoelectric materials whose physical dimensions could be modified by means of electrical current or voltage. Eventually it became apparent, that while the operating frequency of the early single vertical beam acoustic sounders had little, or no, bearing on the measured depths when the bottom was hard (composed primarily of sand, pebbles, cobbles, boulders, or rock), there was a noticeable frequency dependency of the measured depths when the bottom was soft (composed primarily of silt, mud or flocculent suspensions). It was observed that higher frequency single vertical beam echosounders could provide detectable echo amplitudes from high porosity sediments, even if those sediments appeared to be acoustically transparent at lower frequencies.

In the late 1960s, single-beam hydrographic surveys were conducted using widely spaced track lines and the shallow (peak) soundings in the bottom data were retained in preference to deeper soundings in the sounding record. During that same time period, early side scan sonar was introduced into the operational practices of shallow water hydrographic surveying. The frequencies of the early side scan sonars were a matter of engineering design expediency and the most important aspect of the side scanning echoes was not the value of their amplitudes, but rather that the amplitudes were spatially variable. In fact, important information was deduced about the shape of the bottom and manmade items on the bottom, based on the regions where there were absences of detectable echo amplitudes (shadows) In 1979, in hopes of a technological solution to the problems of surveying in &quot;floating mud&quot;, the Director of the National Ocean Survey (NOS) established a NOS study team to conduct investigations to determine the functional specifications for a replacement shallow water depth sounder. The outcome of the study was a class of vertical-beam depth sounders, which is still widely used. It simultaneously pinged at two acoustic frequencies, separated by more than 2 octaves, making depth and echo-amplitude measurements that were concurrent, both spatially and temporally, albeit at a single vertical grazing angle.

The first MBES generation was dedicated to mapping the seafloor in deep water. Those pioneering MBES made little, or no, explicit use of the amplitudes, as their objective was to obtain accurate measurements of the bathymetry (representing both the peaks and deeps). Furthermore, their technical characteristics did not make it easy to observe spatial variations in the echo amplitudes. Subsequent to the early MBES bathymetric surveys and at the time when single frequency side scan sonar had begun to produce high quality images of the seabed that were capable of providing a degree of discrimination between different types of sediments, the potential of the echo amplitudes from a MBES was recognized.

With Marty Klein&#x27;s introduction of dual frequency (nominally 100 kHz and 500 kHz) side scan sonar, it was apparent that spatially and temporally coincident backscatter from any given seabed at those two widely separated acoustic frequencies, would likely provide two separate and unique images of that seascape. Admittedly, the along-track insonification and receiving beam patterns were different, and due to the absence of bathymetric data, the precise backscatter grazing angles were unknown. However, the overlapping sets of side scanning across-track grazing angles at the two frequencies were always the same.

Following the grounding of the off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, in 1992, the emphasis for shallow water surveying migrated toward full bottom coverage surveys by employing MBES with increasing operating frequencies to further improve the spatial resolution of the soundings. Given that side scan sonar, with its across-track fan-shaped swath of insonification, had successfully exploited the cross-track variation in echo amplitudes, to achieve high quality images of the seabed, it seemed a natural progression that the fan-shaped across-track pattern of insonification associated with the new monotone higher frequency shallow water MBES, might also be exploited for seabed imagery. Images acquired under the initial attempts at MBES bottom imaging were less than stellar, but fortunately improvements were forthcoming.

Side scan sonar parses the continual echo returns from a receive beam that is perfectly aligned with the insonification beam using time-after-transmit, a technique that is independent of water depth and the cross-track beam opening angle of the sonar receive transducer. The initial attempt at multibeam imagery employed multiple receive beams, which only partially overlapped the MBES fan-shaped insonification beam, to segment the continual echo returns into intervals that were dependent on water depth and receiver cross-track beam opening angle. Consequently, the segmented intervals were non-uniform in both their length of time and time-after-transmit. The backscatter from each ping in each of the beam-parsed segments was reduced to a single value and assigned to the same geographical coordinates as those assigned to that beam&#x27;s measured sounding. In subsequent modifications to MBES bottom imaging, the echo sequence in each of the beam-parsed intervals was designated as a snippet. On each ping, each snippet from each beam was additionally parsed according to time-after-transmit. Each of the echo amplitude measurements made within a snippet from a particular beam was assigned a geographical position based on linear interpolation between positions assigned to the soundings measured, on that ping, in the two adjacent cross-track beams. The snippet modification to MBES imagery significantly improved the quality of the imagery by increasing the number of echo amplitude measurements available to be rendered as a pixel in the image and also by having a more uniform spatial distribution of the pixels in the image which represented an actual measured echo amplitude.

The introduction of multispectral multibeam echosounders continued the progressive advances in hydrography. In particular, multispectral multibeam echosounders not only provide &quot;multiple look&quot; depth measurements of a seabed, they also provide multispectral backscatter data that are spatially and temporally coincident with those depth measurements. A multispectral multibeam echosounder directly computes a position of origin for each of the backscatter amplitudes in the output data set. Those positions are based on the backscatter measurements themselves and not by interpolation from some other derived data set. Consequently, multispectral multibeam imagery is more acute compared to previous multibeam imagery. The inherent precision of the bathymetric data from a multispectral multibeam echosounder is also a benefit to those users that may be attempting to employ the acoustic backscatter angular response function to discriminate between different sediment types. Multispectral multibeam echosounders reinforces the fact that spatially and temporally coincident backscatter, from any given seabed, at widely separated acoustic frequencies provides separate and unique images of the seascape.

=== Crowdsourcing ===

Crowdsourcing also is entering hydrographic surveying, with projects such as OpenSeaMap, TeamSurv and ARGUS. Here, volunteer vessels record position, depth, and time data using their standard navigation instruments, and then the data is post-processed to account for speed of sound, tidal, and other corrections. With this approach there is no need for a specific survey vessel, or for professionally qualified surveyors to be on board, as the expertise is in the data processing that occurs once the data is uploaded to the server after the voyage. Apart from obvious cost savings, this also gives a continuous survey of an area, but the drawbacks are time in recruiting observers and getting a high enough density and quality of data. Although sometimes accurate to 0.1 – 0.2m, this approach cannot substitute for a rigorous systematic survey, where this is required. Nevertheless, the results are often adequate for many requirements where high resolution, high accuracy surveys are not required, are unaffordable or simply have not been done yet.

==== General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans ====
==Modern integrated hydrographic surveying==
In suitable shallow-water areas lidar (light detection and ranging) may be used. Equipment can be installed on inflatable craft, such as Zodiacs, small craft, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), Remote Operated Vehicles (ROV) or large ships, and can include sidescan, single-beam and multibeam equipment. At one time different data collection methods and standards were used in collecting hydrographic data for maritime safety and for scientific or engineering bathymetric charts, but increasingly, with the aid of improved collection techniques and computer processing, the data is collected under one standard and extracted for specific use.

After data is collected, it has to undergo post-processing. A massive amount of data is collected during the typical hydrographic survey, often several soundings per square foot. Depending on the final use intended for the data (for example, navigation charts, Digital Terrain Model, volume calculation for dredging, topography, or bathymetry) this data must be thinned out. It must also be corrected for errors (i.e., bad soundings,) and for the effects of tides, heave, water level salinity and thermoclines (water temperature differences) as the velocity of sound varies with temperature and salinity and affects accuracy. Usually the surveyor has additional data collection equipment on site to measure and record the data required for correcting the soundings. The final output of charts can be created with a combination of specialty charting software or a computer-aided design (CAD) package, usually Autocad.

Although the accuracy of crowd-sourced surveying can rarely reach the standards of traditional methods, the algorithms used rely on a high data density to produce final results that are more accurate than single measurements. A comparison of crowd-sourced surveys with multibeam surveys indicates an accuracy of crowd-sourced surveys of around plus or minus 0.1 to 0.2 meter (about 4 to 8 inches).

<doc id="167742" wikidata="Q193626" url="?curid=167742" title="Scientism">
<text>Scientism is the belief that science and the scientific method are the best or only way to render truth about the world and reality.

While the term was defined originally to mean &quot;methods and attitudes typical of or attributed to natural scientists&quot;, some scholars, as well as political and religious leaders, have also adopted it as a pejorative term with the meaning &quot;an exaggerated trust in the efficacy of the methods of natural science applied to all areas of investigation (as in philosophy, the social sciences, and the humanities)&quot;.

==Overview==
Francis Bacon has been viewed by some scholars as an early proponent of scientism, but this is a modern assertion as Bacon was a devout Anglican, writing in his Essays, &quot;a little philosophy inclineth man&#x27;s mind to atheism, but depth in philosophy bringeth men&#x27;s minds about to religion.&quot;

With respect to the philosophy of science, the term &quot;scientism&quot; frequently implies a critique of the more extreme expressions of logical positivism and has been used by social scientists such as Friedrich Hayek, philosophers of science such as Karl Popper, and philosophers such as Mary Midgley, the later Hilary Putnam, and Tzvetan Todorov to describe (for example) the dogmatic endorsement of scientific methods and the reduction of all knowledge to only that which is measured or confirmatory.

More generally, scientism is often interpreted as science applied &quot;in excess&quot;. This use of the term &quot;scientism&quot; has two senses:

* The improper use of science or scientific claims. This usage applies equally in contexts where science might not apply, such as when the topic is perceived as beyond the scope of scientific inquiry, and in contexts where there is insufficient empirical evidence to justify a scientific conclusion. It includes an excessive deference to the claims of scientists or an uncritical eagerness to accept any result described as scientific. This can be a counterargument to appeals to scientific authority. It can also address attempts to apply natural science methods and claims of certainty to the social sciences, which Friedrich Hayek described in &quot;The Counter-Revolution of Science&quot; (1952) as being impossible, because those methods attempt to eliminate the &quot;human factor&quot;, while social sciences (including his own topic of economics) mainly concern the study of human action.
* &quot;The belief that the methods of natural science, or the categories and things recognized in natural science, form the only proper elements in any philosophical or other inquiry&quot;, or that &quot;science, and only science, describes the world as it is in itself, independent of perspective&quot; with a concomitant &quot;elimination of the psychological [and spiritual] dimensions of experience&quot;. Tom Sorell provides this definition: &quot;Scientism is a matter of putting too high a value on natural science in comparison with other branches of learning or culture.&quot; Philosophers such as Alexander Rosenberg have also adopted &quot;scientism&quot; as a name for the opinion that science is the only reliable source of knowledge.

It is also sometimes used to describe the universal applicability of the scientific method, and the opinion that empirical science constitutes the most authoritative worldview or the most valuable part of human learning, sometimes to the complete exclusion of other opinions, such as historical, philosophical, economic or cultural opinions. It has been defined as &quot;the view that the characteristic inductive methods of the natural sciences are the only source of genuine factual knowledge and, in particular, that they alone can yield true knowledge about man and society&quot;. The term &quot;scientism&quot; is also used by historians, philosophers, and cultural critics to highlight the possible dangers of lapses towards excessive reductionism with respect to all topics of human knowledge.

For social theorists practising the tradition of Max Weber, such as Jürgen Habermas and Max Horkheimer, the concept of scientism relates significantly to the philosophy of positivism, but also to the cultural rationalization for modern Western civilization. Ernesto Sabato, physicist and essayist, wrote in his 1951 essay (&quot;Man and mechanism&quot;) of the &quot;superstition of science&quot; as the most contradictory of all superstitions, since this would be the &quot;superstition that one should not be &quot;superstitious&quot;&quot;. He wrote: &quot;science had become a new magic and the man in the street believed in it the more the less he understood it&quot;.

==Definitions==
Reviewing the references to scientism in the works of contemporary scholars in 2003, Gregory R. Peterson detected two main general themes:
* It is used to criticize a totalizing opinion of science as if it were capable of describing &quot;all&quot; reality and knowledge, or as if it were the &quot;only&quot; true method to acquire knowledge about reality and the nature of things;
* It is used, often pejoratively, to denote violations by which the theories and methods of one (scientific) discipline are applied inappropriately to another (scientific or non-scientific) discipline and its domain. An example of this second usage is to term as scientism any attempt to claim science as the only or primary source of human values (a traditional domain of ethics) or as the source of meaning and purpose (a traditional domain of religion and related worldviews).

The term &quot;scientism&quot; was popularized by F. A. Hayek, who defined it in 1942 as the &quot;slavish imitation of the method and language of Science&quot;.

Mathematician Alexander Grothendieck, in his 1971 essay &quot;The New Universal Church&quot;, characterized scientism as a religion-like ideology that advocates scientific reductionism, scientific authoritarianism, political technocracy and technological salvation, while denying the epistemological validity of feelings and experiences such as love, emotion, beauty and fulfillment. He predicted that &quot;in coming years, the chief political dividing line will fall less and less among the traditional division between &#x27;right&#x27; and &#x27;left&#x27;, but increasingly between the adherents of scientism, who advocate &#x27;technological progress at any price&#x27;, and their opponents, i.e., roughly speaking, those who regard the enhancement of life, in all its richness and variety, as being the supreme value&quot;.

E. F. Schumacher, in his &quot;A Guide for the Perplexed&quot; (1977), criticized scientism as an impoverished world view confined solely to what can be counted, measured and weighed. &quot;The architects of the modern worldview, notably Galileo and Descartes, assumed that those things that could be weighed, measured, and counted were more true than those that could not be quantified. If it couldn&#x27;t be counted, in other words, it didn&#x27;t count.&quot;

In 1979, Karl Popper defined scientism as &quot;the aping of what is widely mistaken for the method of science&quot;.

In 2003, Mikael Stenmark proposed the expression &quot;scientific expansionism&quot; as a synonym of scientism. In the &quot;Encyclopedia of Science and Religion&quot;, he wrote that, while the doctrines that are described as scientism have many possible forms and varying degrees of ambition, they share the idea that the boundaries of science (that is, typically the natural sciences) could and should be expanded so that something that has not been previously considered as a subject pertinent to science can now be understood as part of science (usually with science becoming the sole or the main arbiter regarding this area or dimension). According to Stenmark, the strongest form of scientism states that science does not have any boundaries and that all human problems and all aspects of human endeavor, with due time, will be dealt with and solved by science alone. This idea has also been termed the myth of progress.

Intellectual historian T. J. Jackson Lears argued in 2013 that there has been a recent reemergence of &quot;nineteenth-century positivist faith that a reified &#x27;science&#x27; has discovered (or is about to discover) all the important truths about human life. Precise measurement and rigorous calculation, in this view, are the basis for finally settling enduring metaphysical and moral controversies.&quot; Lears specifically identified Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker&#x27;s work as falling in this category. Philosophers John N. Gray and Thomas Nagel have made similar criticisms against popular works by moral psychologist Jonathan Haidt, atheist author Sam Harris, and writer Malcolm Gladwell.

=== Strong and weak scientism ===
There are various ways of classifying kinds of scientism. Some authors distinguish between strong and weak scientism, as follows:

* : &quot;of all the knowledge we have, scientific knowledge is the &quot;only&quot; &#x27;real knowledge&#x27;&quot; (Moti Mizrahi), or, &quot;the view that some proposition or theory is true and/or rational to believe if and only if it is a scientific proposition or theory&quot; (J. P. Moreland), or, &quot;only science yields epistemically credible data&quot; (Michael W. Austin)
* : &quot;of all the knowledge we have, scientific knowledge is the &quot;best&quot; knowledge&quot; (Moti Mizrahi), or, &quot;science is the most valuable, most serious, and most authoritative sector of human learning&quot; (J. P. Moreland), or, &quot;scientific knowledge claims are the most credible knowledge claims&quot; (Michael W. Austin)

==Relevance to debates about science and religion==
Both religious and non-religious scholars have applied the term &quot;scientism&quot; to individuals associated with New Atheism. Theologian John Haught argued that philosopher Daniel Dennett and other New Atheists subscribe to a belief system of scientific naturalism, which includes the dogma that &quot;only nature, including humans and our creations, is real: that God does not exist; and that science alone can give us complete and reliable knowledge of reality.&quot; Haught argued that this belief system is self-refuting since it requires its adherents to assent to beliefs that violate its own stated requirements for knowledge. Christian philosopher Peter Williams argued in 2013 that it is only by conflating science with scientism that New Atheists feel qualified to &quot;pontificate on metaphysical issues&quot;. Daniel Dennett responded to religious criticism of his 2006 book &quot;Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon&quot; by saying that accusations of scientism &quot;[are] an all-purpose, wild-card smear ... When someone puts forward a scientific theory that [religious critics] really don&#x27;t like, they just try to discredit it as &#x27;scientism&#x27;. But when it comes to facts, and explanations of facts, science is the only game in town&quot;.

Non-religious scholars have also associated New Atheist thought with scientism and/or with positivism. Atheist philosopher Thomas Nagel argued that philosopher Sam Harris conflated all empirical knowledge with scientific knowledge. Marxist literary critic Terry Eagleton argued that Christopher Hitchens possessed an &quot;old-fashioned scientistic notion of what counts as evidence&quot; that reduces knowledge to what can and cannot be proven by scientific procedure. Agnostic philosopher Anthony Kenny has also criticized New Atheist philosopher Alexander Rosenberg&#x27;s &quot;The Atheist&#x27;s Guide to Reality&quot; for resurrecting a self-refuting epistemology of logical positivism and reducing all knowledge of the universe to the discipline of physics.

Michael Shermer, founder of The Skeptics Society, discussed resemblances between scientism and traditional religions, indicating the cult of personality that develops for some scientists. He defined scientism as a worldview that encompasses natural explanations, eschews supernatural and paranormal speculations, and embraces empiricism and reason.

The Iranian scholar Seyyed Hossein Nasr has stated that in the Western world, many will accept the ideology of modern science, not as &quot;simple ordinary science&quot;, but as a replacement for religion.

Gregory R. Peterson wrote that &quot;for many theologians and philosophers, scientism is among the greatest of intellectual sins&quot;. Genetic biologist Austin L. Hughes wrote in the conservative journal &quot;The New Atlantis&quot; that scientism has much in common with superstition: &quot;the stubborn insistence that something ... has powers which no evidence supports.&quot;

Repeating common criticisms of logical positivism and verificationism, philosopher of religion Keith Ward has said that scientism is philosophically inconsistent or even self-refuting, as the truth of the two statements &quot;no statements are true unless they can be proven scientifically (or logically)&quot; and &quot;no statements are true unless they can be shown empirically to be true&quot; cannot themselves be proven scientifically, logically, or empirically.

==Philosophy of science==
===Anti-scientism===
Philosopher Paul Feyerabend, who was an enthusiastic proponent of scientism during his youth, later came to characterize science as &quot;an essentially anarchic enterprise&quot; and argued emphatically that science merits no exclusive monopoly of &quot;dealing in knowledge&quot; and that scientists have never operated within a distinct and narrowly self-defined tradition. In his essay &quot;Against Method&quot; he depicted the process of contemporary scientific education as a mild form of indoctrination, intended for &quot;making the history of science duller, simpler, more uniform, more &#x27;objective&#x27; and more easily accessible to treatment by strict and unchanging rules&quot;.

===Pro-scientism===
Physicist and philosopher Mario Bunge used the term &quot;scientism&quot; with a favorable rather than pejorative sense in numerous books published during several decades, and in articles with titles such as &quot;In Defense of Realism and Scientism&quot; and &quot;In Defense of Scientism&quot;. Bunge said that scientism should not be equated with inappropriate reductionism, and he dismissed critics of science such as Hayek and Habermas as dogmatists and obscurantists:
In 2018, philosophers Maarten Boudry and Massimo Pigliucci co-edited a book titled &quot;Science Unlimited? The Challenges of Scientism&quot; in which a number of chapters by philosophers and scientists defended scientism. In his chapter &quot;Two Cheers for Scientism&quot;, Taner Edis wrote:
==Rhetoric of science==

Thomas M. Lessl argued that religious themes persist in what he terms scientism, the public rhetoric of science. There are two methods of describing this idea of scientism: the epistemological method (the assumption that the scientific method trumps other ways of knowing) and the ontological method (that the rational mind represents the world and both operate in knowable ways). According to Lessl, the ontological method is an attempt to &quot;resolve the conflict between rationalism and skepticism&quot;. Lessl also argued that without scientism, there would not be a scientific culture.

==Rationalization and modernity==

In the introduction to his collected works on the sociology of religion, Max Weber asked why &quot;the scientific, the artistic, the political, or the economic development [elsewhere] ... did not enter upon that path of rationalization which is peculiar to the Occident?&quot; According to the German social theorist Jürgen Habermas, &quot;For Weber, the intrinsic (that is, not merely contingent) relationship between modernity and what he called &#x27;Occidental rationalism&#x27; was still self-evident.&quot; Weber described a process of rationalisation, disenchantment and the &quot;disintegration of religious world views&quot; that resulted in modern secular societies and capitalism.
Habermas is critical of pure instrumental rationality, arguing that the &quot;Social Life–World&quot; of subjective experiencing is better suited to literary expression, whereas the sciences deal with &quot;intersubjectively accessible experiences&quot; that can be generalized in a formal language, while the literary arts &quot;must generate an intersubjectivity of mutual understanding in each concrete case&quot;. Habermas quoted writer Aldous Huxley in support of this duality of literature and science:

<text>A cowboy is an animal herder who tends cattle on ranches in North America, traditionally on horseback, and often performs a multitude of other ranch-related tasks. The historic American cowboy of the late 19th century arose from the &quot;vaquero&quot; traditions of northern Mexico and became a figure of special significance and legend. A subtype, called a wrangler, specifically tends the horses used to work cattle. In addition to ranch work, some cowboys work for or participate in rodeos. Cowgirls, first defined as such in the late 19th century, had a less-well documented historical role, but in the modern world work at identical tasks and have obtained considerable respect for their achievements. Cattle handlers in many other parts of the world, particularly South America and Australia, perform work similar to the cowboy.

The cowboy has deep historic roots tracing back to Spain and the earliest European settlers of the Americas. Over the centuries, differences in terrain and climate, and the influence of cattle-handling traditions from multiple cultures, created several distinct styles of equipment, clothing and animal handling. As the ever-practical cowboy adapted to the modern world, his equipment and techniques also adapted, though many classic traditions are preserved.

==Etymology and mainstream usage==
The English word &quot;cowboy&quot; has an origin from several earlier terms that referred to both age and to cattle or cattle-tending work.

The English word &quot;cowboy&quot; was derived from &quot;vaquero&quot;, a Spanish word for an individual who managed cattle while mounted on horseback. &quot;Vaquero&quot; was derived from &quot;vaca&quot;, meaning &quot;cow&quot;, which came from the Latin word &quot;vacca&quot;. &quot;Cowboy&quot; was first used in print by Jonathan Swift in 1725, and was used in the British Isles from 1820 to 1850 to describe young boys who tended the family or community cows. Originally though, the English word &quot;cowherd&quot; was used to describe a cattle herder (similar to &quot;shepherd&quot;, a sheep herder), and often referred to a pre-adolescent or early adolescent boy, who usually worked on foot. This word is very old in the English language, originating prior to the year 1000.

By 1849 &quot;cowboy&quot; had developed its modern sense as an adult cattle handler of the American West. Variations on the word appeared later. &quot;Cowhand&quot; appeared in 1852, and &quot;cowpoke&quot; in 1881, originally restricted to the individuals who prodded cattle with long poles to load them onto railroad cars for shipping. Names for a cowboy in American English include &quot;buckaroo&quot;, &quot;cowpoke&quot;, &quot;cowhand&quot;, and &quot;cowpuncher&quot;. Another English word for a cowboy, &quot;buckaroo&quot;, is an anglicization of &quot;vaquero&quot; ().

Today, &quot;cowboy&quot; is a term common throughout the west and particularly in the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, &quot;buckaroo&quot; is used primarily in the Great Basin and California, and &quot;cowpuncher&quot; mostly in Texas and surrounding states.

Equestrianism required skills and an investment in horses and equipment rarely available to or entrusted to a child, though in some cultures boys rode a donkey while going to and from pasture. In antiquity, herding of sheep, cattle and goats was often the job of minors, and still is a task for young people in various Developing World cultures.

Because of the time and physical ability needed to develop necessary skills, both historic and modern cowboys often began as an adolescent. Historically, cowboys earned wages as soon as they developed sufficient skill to be hired (often as young as 12 or 13). If not crippled by injury, cowboys may handle cattle or horses for a lifetime. In the United States, a few women also took on the tasks of ranching and learned the necessary skills, though the &quot;cowgirl&quot; (discussed below) did not become widely recognized or acknowledged until the close of the 19th century. On western ranches today, the working cowboy is usually an adult. Responsibility for herding cattle or other livestock is no longer considered suitable for children or early adolescents. Boys and girls growing up in a ranch environment often learn to ride horses and perform basic ranch skills as soon as they are physically able, usually under adult supervision. Such youths, by their late teens, are often given responsibilities for &quot;cowboy&quot; work on the ranch.

===Other historic word uses===
&quot;Cowboy&quot; was used during the American Revolution to describe American fighters who opposed the movement for independence. Claudius Smith, an outlaw identified with the Loyalist cause, was called the &quot;Cow-boy of the Ramapos&quot; due to his penchant for stealing oxen, cattle and horses from colonists and giving them to the British. In the same period, a number of guerrilla bands operated in Westchester County, which marked the dividing line between the British and American forces. These groups were made up of local farmhands who would ambush convoys and carry out raids on both sides. There were two separate groups: the &quot;skinners&quot; fought for the pro-independence side, while the &quot;cowboys&quot; supported the British.

In the Tombstone, Arizona, area during the 1880s, the term &quot;cowboy&quot; or &quot;cow-boy&quot; was used pejoratively to describe men who had been implicated in various crimes. One loosely organized band was dubbed &quot;The Cowboys&quot;, and profited from smuggling cattle, alcohol, and tobacco across the U.S.–Mexico border. &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; wrote in an editorial, &quot;Cowboys [are] the most reckless class of outlaws in that wild country ... infinitely worse than the ordinary robber.&quot; It became an insult in the area to call someone a &quot;cowboy&quot;, as it suggested he was a horse thief, robber, or outlaw. Cattlemen were generally called herders or ranchers. Other synonyms for cowboy were ranch hand, range hand or trail hand, although duties and pay were not entirely identical. The Cowboys&#x27; activities were ultimately curtailed by the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and the resulting Earp Vendetta Ride.

==History==
The origins of the cowboy tradition come from Spain, beginning with the hacienda system of medieval Spain. This style of cattle ranching spread throughout much of the Iberian peninsula, and later was imported to the Americas. Both regions possessed a dry climate with sparse grass, thus large herds of cattle required vast amounts of land to obtain sufficient forage. The need to cover distances greater than a person on foot could manage gave rise to the development of the horseback-mounted &quot;vaquero&quot;.

===Spanish roots===

Various aspects of the Spanish equestrian tradition can be traced back to Islamic rule in Spain, including Moorish elements such as the use of Oriental-type horses, the &quot;la jineta&quot; riding style characterized by a shorter stirrup, solid-treed saddle and use of spurs, the heavy noseband or hackamore, (Arabic &quot;šakīma&quot;, Spanish &quot;jaquima&quot;) and other horse-related equipment and techniques. Certain aspects of the Arabic tradition, such as the hackamore, can in turn be traced to roots in ancient Persia.

During the 16th century, the Conquistadors and other Spanish settlers brought their cattle-raising traditions as well as both horses and domesticated cattle to the Americas, starting with their arrival in what today is Mexico and Florida. The traditions of Spain were transformed by the geographic, environmental and cultural circumstances of New Spain, which later became Mexico and the Southwestern United States. In turn, the land and people of the Americas also saw dramatic changes due to Spanish influence.

The arrival of horses was particularly significant, as equines had been extinct in the Americas since the end of the prehistoric ice age. Horses quickly multiplied in America and became crucial to the success of the Spanish and later settlers from other nations. The earliest horses were originally of Andalusian, Barb and Arabian ancestry, but a number of uniquely American horse breeds developed in North and South America through selective breeding and by natural selection of animals that escaped to the wild. The mustang and other colonial horse breeds are now called &quot;wild&quot;, but in reality are feral horses—descendants of domesticated animals.

===Vaqueros===

Though popularly considered American, the traditional cowboy began with the Spanish tradition, which evolved further in what today is Mexico and the Southwestern United States into the &quot;vaquero&quot; of northern Mexico and the &quot;charro&quot; of the Jalisco and Michoacán regions. While most &quot;hacendados&quot; (ranch owners) were ethnically Spanish &quot;criollos&quot;, many early &quot;vaqueros&quot; were Native Americans trained to work for the Spanish missions in caring for the mission herds. &quot;Vaqueros&quot; went north with livestock. In 1598, Don Juan de Oñate sent an expedition across the Rio Grande into New Mexico, bringing along 7000 head of cattle. From this beginning, &quot;vaqueros&quot; drove cattle from New Mexico and later Texas to Mexico City. Mexican traditions spread both South and North, influencing equestrian traditions from Argentina to Canada.

===American development===
As English-speaking traders and settlers expanded westward, English and Spanish traditions, language and culture merged to some degree. Before the Mexican–American War in 1848, New England merchants who traveled by ship to California encountered both &quot;hacendados&quot; and &quot;vaqueros&quot;, trading manufactured goods for the hides and tallow produced from vast cattle ranches. American traders along what later became known as the Santa Fe Trail had similar contacts with &quot;vaquero&quot; life. Starting with these early encounters, the lifestyle and language of the &quot;vaquero&quot; began a transformation which merged with English cultural traditions and produced what became known in American culture as the &quot;cowboy&quot;.

The arrival of English-speaking settlers in Texas began in 1821. Rip Ford described the country between Laredo and Corpus Christi as inhabited by &quot;countless droves of mustangs and ... wild cattle ... abandoned by Mexicans when they were ordered to evacuate the country between the Nueces and the Rio Grande by General Valentin Canalizo ... the horses and cattle abandoned invited the raids the Texians made upon this territory.&quot; California, on the other hand, did not see a large influx of settlers from the United States until after the Mexican–American War. In slightly different ways, both areas contributed to the evolution of the iconic American cowboy. Particularly with the arrival of railroads and an increased demand for beef in the wake of the American Civil War, older traditions combined with the need to drive cattle from the ranches where they were raised to the nearest railheads, often hundreds of miles away.

Black cowboys in the American West accounted for up to 25 percent of workers in the range-cattle industry from the 1860s to 1880s, estimated to be between 6,000 and 9,000 workers. Typically former slaves or children of former slaves, many black men had skills in cattle handling and headed West at the end of the Civil War.

By the 1880s, the expansion of the cattle industry resulted in a need for additional open range. Thus many ranchers expanded into the northwest, where there were still large tracts of unsettled grassland. Texas cattle were herded north, into the Rocky Mountain west and the Dakotas. The cowboy adapted much of his gear to the colder conditions, and westward movement of the industry also led to intermingling of regional traditions from California to Texas, often with the cowboy taking the most useful elements of each.

Mustang-runners or &quot;Mesteñeros&quot; were cowboys and vaqueros who caught, broke and drove mustangs to market in Mexico, and later American territories of what is now Northern Mexico, Texas, New Mexico and California. They caught the mustangs that roamed the Great Plains and the San Joaquin Valley of California, and later in the Great Basin, from the 18th century to the early 20th century.

Large numbers of cattle lived in a semi-feral or a completely feral state on the open range and were left to graze, mostly untended, for much of the year. In many cases, different ranchers formed &quot;associations&quot; and grazed their cattle together on the same range. In order to determine the ownership of individual animals, they were marked with a distinctive brand, applied with a hot iron, usually while the cattle were still calves.

In order to find young calves for branding, and to sort out mature animals intended for sale, ranchers would hold a roundup, usually in the spring. A roundup required a number of specialized skills on the part of both cowboys and horses. Individuals who separated cattle from the herd required the highest level of skill and rode specially trained &quot;cutting&quot; horses, trained to follow the movements of cattle, capable of stopping and turning faster than other horses. Once cattle were sorted, most cowboys were required to rope young calves and restrain them to be branded and (in the case of most bull calves) castrated. Occasionally it was also necessary to restrain older cattle for branding or other treatment.

A large number of horses were needed for a roundup. Each cowboy would require three to four fresh horses in the course of a day&#x27;s work. Horses themselves were also rounded up. It was common practice in the west for young foals to be born of tame mares, but allowed to grow up &quot;wild&quot; in a semi-feral state on the open range. There were also &quot;wild&quot; herds, often known as mustangs. Both types were rounded up, and the mature animals tamed, a process called horse breaking, or &quot;bronco-busting&quot;, usually performed by cowboys who specialized as horse trainers. In some cases, extremely brutal methods were used to tame horses, and such animals tended to never be completely reliable. Other cowboys recognized their need to treat animals in a more humane fashion and modified their horse training methods, often re-learning techniques used by the &quot;vaqueros&quot;, particularly those of the &quot;Californio&quot; tradition. Horses trained in a gentler fashion were more reliable and useful for a wider variety of tasks.

Informal competition arose between cowboys seeking to test their cattle and horse-handling skills against one another, and thus, from the necessary tasks of the working cowboy, the sport of rodeo developed.

===Cattle drives===

Prior to the mid-19th century, most ranchers primarily raised cattle for their own needs and to sell surplus meat and hides locally. There was also a limited market for hides, horns, hooves, and tallow in assorted manufacturing processes. While Texas contained vast herds of stray, free-ranging cattle available for free to anyone who could round them up, prior to 1865, there was little demand for beef. At the end of the American Civil War, Philip Danforth Armour opened a meat packing plant in Chicago, which became known as Armour and Company. With the expansion of the meat packing industry, the demand for beef increased significantly. By 1866, cattle could be sold to northern markets for as much as $40 per head, making it potentially profitable for cattle, particularly from Texas, to be herded long distances to market.

The first large-scale effort to drive cattle from Texas to the nearest railhead for shipment to Chicago occurred in 1866, when many Texas ranchers banded together to drive their cattle to the closest point that railroad tracks reached, which at that time was in Sedalia, Missouri. Farmers in eastern Kansas, afraid that Longhorns would transmit cattle fever to local animals as well as trample crops, formed groups that threatened to beat or shoot cattlemen found on their lands. Therefore, the 1866 drive failed to reach the railroad, and the cattle herds were sold for low prices. In 1867, a cattle shipping facility was built west of farm country around the railhead at Abilene, Kansas, and became a center of cattle shipping, loading over 36,000 head of cattle that year. The route from Texas to Abilene became known as the Chisholm Trail, after Jesse Chisholm, who marked out the route. It ran through present-day Oklahoma, which then was Indian Territory. Later, other trails forked off to different railheads, including those at Dodge City and Wichita, Kansas. By 1877, the largest of the cattle-shipping boom towns, Dodge City, Kansas, shipped out 500,000 head of cattle.

Cattle drives had to strike a balance between speed and the weight of the cattle. While cattle could be driven as far as in a single day, they would lose so much weight that they would be hard to sell when they reached the end of the trail. Usually they were taken shorter distances each day, allowed periods to rest and graze both at midday and at night. On average, a herd could maintain a healthy weight moving about per day. Such a pace meant that it would take as long as two months to travel from a home ranch to a railhead. The Chisholm trail, for example, was miles long.

On average, a single herd of cattle on a drive numbered about 3,000 head. To herd the cattle, a crew of at least 10 cowboys was needed, with three horses per cowboy. Cowboys worked in shifts to watch the cattle 24 hours a day, herding them in the proper direction in the daytime and watching them at night to prevent stampedes and deter theft. The crew also included a cook, who drove a chuck wagon, usually pulled by oxen, and a horse wrangler to take charge of the &quot;remuda&quot;, or herd of spare horses. The wrangler on a cattle drive was often a very young cowboy or one of lower social status, but the cook was a particularly well-respected member of the crew, as not only was he in charge of the food, he also was in charge of medical supplies and had a working knowledge of practical medicine.

===End of the open range===

Barbed wire, an innovation of the 1880s, allowed cattle to be confined to designated areas to prevent overgrazing of the range. In Texas and surrounding areas, increased population required ranchers to fence off their individual lands. In the north, overgrazing stressed the open range, leading to insufficient winter forage for the cattle and starvation, particularly during the harsh winter of 1886–1887, when hundreds of thousands of cattle died across the Northwest, leading to collapse of the cattle industry. By the 1890s, barbed-wire fencing was also standard in the northern plains, railroads had expanded to cover most of the nation, and meat packing plants were built closer to major ranching areas, making long cattle drives from Texas to the railheads in Kansas unnecessary. Hence, the age of the open range was gone and large cattle drives were over. Smaller cattle drives continued at least into the 1940s, as ranchers, prior to the development of the modern cattle truck, still needed to herd cattle to local railheads for transport to stockyards and packing plants. Meanwhile, ranches multiplied all over the developing West, keeping cowboy employment high, if still low-paid, but also somewhat more settled.

==Culture==

===Ethnicity===

American cowboys were drawn from multiple sources. By the late 1860s, following the American Civil War and the expansion of the cattle industry, former soldiers from both the Union and Confederacy came west, seeking work, as did large numbers of restless white men in general. A significant number of African-American freedmen also were drawn to cowboy life, in part because there was not quite as much racial discrimination in the West as in other areas of American society at the time. A significant number of Mexicans and American Indians already living in the region also worked as cowboys. Later, particularly after 1890, when American policy promoted &quot;assimilation&quot; of Indian people, some Indian boarding schools also taught ranching skills. Today, some Native Americans in the western United States own cattle and small ranches, and many are still employed as cowboys, especially on ranches located near Indian reservations. The &quot;Indian Cowboy&quot; is also part of the rodeo circuit.

Because cowboys ranked low in the social structure of the period, there are no firm figures on the actual proportion of various races. One writer states that cowboys were &quot;of two classes—those recruited from Texas and other States on the eastern slope; and Mexicans, from the south-western region&quot;. Census records suggest that about 15% of all cowboys were of African-American ancestry—ranging from about 25% on the trail drives out of Texas, to very few in the northwest. Similarly, cowboys of Mexican descent also averaged about 15% of the total, but were more common in Texas and the southwest. Some estimates suggest that in the late 19th century, one out of every three cowboys was a Mexican vaquero, and 20% may have been African-American. Other estimates place the number of African-American cowboys as high as 25 percent.

Regardless of ethnicity, most cowboys came from lower social classes and the pay was poor. The average cowboy earned approximately a dollar a day, plus food, and, when near the home ranch, a bed in the bunkhouse, usually a barracks-like building with a single open room.

===Social world===
Over time, the cowboys of the American West developed a personal culture of their own, a blend of frontier and Victorian values that even retained vestiges of chivalry. Such hazardous work in isolated conditions also bred a tradition of self-dependence and individualism, with great value put on personal honesty, exemplified in songs and poetry. The cowboy often worked in an all-male environment, particularly on cattle drives, and in the frontier west, men often significantly outnumbered women.

Some men were attracted to the frontier by other men. At times, in a region where men outnumbered women, even social events normally attended by both sexes were at times all male, and men could be found partnering up with one another for dances. Homosexual acts between young, unmarried men occurred, but cowboys culture itself was and remains deeply homophobic. Though anti-sodomy laws were common in the Old West, they often were only selectively enforced.

===Popular image===

Heather Cox Richardson argues for a political dimension to the original cowboy image in the 1870s and 1880s:The timing of the cattle industry&#x27;s growth meant that cowboy imagery grew to have extraordinary power. Entangled in the vicious politics of the postwar years, Democrats, especially those in the old Confederacy, imagined the West as a land untouched by Republican politicians they hated. They developed an image of the cowboys as men who worked hard, played hard, lived by a code of honor, protected themselves, and asked nothing of the government. In the hands of Democratic newspaper editors, the realities of cowboy life -- the poverty, the danger, the debilitating hours -- became romantic. Cowboys embodied virtues Democrats believed Republicans were destroying by creating a behemoth government catering to lazy ex-slaves. By the 1860s, cattle drives were a feature of the plains landscape, and Democrats had made cowboys a symbol of rugged individual independence, something they insisted Republicans were destroying. 

The traditions of the working cowboy were further etched into the minds of the general public with the development of Wild West shows in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which showcased and romanticized the life of both cowboys and Native Americans. Beginning in the 1920s and continuing to the present day, Western films popularized the cowboy lifestyle but also formed persistent stereotypes. In some cases, the cowboy and the violent gunslinger are often associated with one another. On the other hand, some actors who portrayed cowboys promoted other values, such as the &quot;cowboy code&quot; of Gene Autry, that encouraged honorable behavior, respect and patriotism. Historian Robert K. DeArment draws a connection between the popularized Western code and the stereotypical rowdy cowboy image to that of the &quot;subculture of violence&quot; of drovers in Old West Texas that was influenced itself by the Southern code duello.

Likewise, cowboys in movies were often shown fighting with American Indians. Most armed conflicts occurred between Native people and cavalry units of the U.S. Army. Relations between cowboys and Native Americans were varied but were generally unfriendly. Native people usually allowed cattle herds to pass through for a toll of ten cents a head but raided cattle drives and ranches in times of active white-Native conflict or food shortages. In the 1860s, for example, the Comanche created problems in Western Texas. Similar attacks also occurred with the Apache, Cheyenne and Ute Indians. Cowboys were armed against both predators and human thieves, and often used their guns to drive away people of any race who attempted to rustle cattle.

In reality, working ranch hands past and present had very little time for anything other than the constant hard work involved in maintaining a ranch.

==Cowgirls==

The history of women in the West, and women who worked on cattle ranches in particular, is not as well documented as is that of men. Institutions such as the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in modern years have attempted to gather and document the contributions of women.

There are few records mentioning girls or women working to drive cattle up the cattle trails of the Old West. Women performed considerable ranch work, and in some cases (especially when the men went to war or on embarked on long cattle drives) ran them. There is little doubt that women, particularly the wives and daughters of men who owned small ranches and could not afford to hire large numbers of outside laborers, worked side-by-side with men and thus needed to ride horses and perform related tasks. The largely undocumented contributions of women to the West were acknowledged in law; the Western states led the United States in granting women the right to vote, beginning with Wyoming in 1869. Early photographers such as Evelyn Cameron documented the life of working ranch women during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

While impractical for everyday work, the sidesaddle was a tool that afforded women the ability to ride horses in public settings instead of being left on foot or confined to horse-drawn vehicles. Following the Civil War, Charles Goodnight modified the traditional English sidesaddle, creating a western-styled design. The traditional &quot;charras&quot; of Mexico preserve a similar tradition and ride sidesaddles today in &quot;charreada&quot; exhibitions on both sides of the border.

It was not until the advent of Wild West shows that &quot;cowgirls&quot; came into their own. These adult women were skilled performers, demonstrating riding, expert marksmanship and trick roping that entertained audiences around the world. Women such as Annie Oakley became household names. By 1900, skirts split for riding astride became popular and allowed women to compete with men without scandalizing Victorian-era audiences by wearing men&#x27;s clothing or bloomers. In the films that followed beginning in the early 20th century, the role of the cowgirl was expanded in popular culture and film set designers developed attractive clothing suitable for riding Western saddles.

Independently of the entertainment industry, the growth of rodeo brought about the rodeo cowgirl. In the early Wild West shows and rodeos, women competed in all events, sometimes against other women, sometimes with the men. Cowgirls such as Fannie Sperry Steele rode the same &quot;rough stock&quot; and assumed the same risks as the men (and all while wearing a heavy split skirt that was more encumbering than men&#x27;s trousers) and competed at major rodeos such as the Calgary Stampede and Cheyenne Frontier Days.
Rodeo competition for women changed in the 1920s as the result of several factors. After 1925, when Eastern promoters started staging indoor rodeos in places like Madison Square Garden, women were generally excluded from the men&#x27;s events and many of the women&#x27;s events were dropped. Also, many in the public had difficulties with seeing women seriously injured or killed, and in particular, the death of Bonnie McCarroll at the 1929 Pendleton Round-Up led to the elimination of women&#x27;s bronc riding from rodeo competition.

In today&#x27;s rodeos, men and women compete equally together only in the event of team roping, although women could now enter other open events. In all-women rodeos, women compete in bronc riding, bull riding and all other traditional rodeo events. In open rodeos, cowgirls primarily compete in the timed riding events such as barrel racing, and most professional rodeos do not offer as many women&#x27;s events as they do men&#x27;s events.

Boys and girls are more apt to compete against one another in all events in high-school rodeos as well as O-Mok-See competition, where boys can be seen in events traditionally associated with women riders, such as barrel racing. Outside of the rodeo world, women compete equally with men in nearly all other equestrian events, including the Olympics, and Western riding events such as cutting, reining and endurance riding.

Today&#x27;s working cowgirls generally use clothing, tools and equipment indistinguishable from those of men, other than in color and design, usually preferring a flashier look in competition. Sidesaddles are only seen in exhibitions and a limited number of specialty horse-show classes. A modern working cowgirl wears jeans, close-fitting shirts, boots, hat and when needed, chaps and gloves. If working on the ranch, they perform the same chores as cowboys and dress to suit the situation.

==Regional traditions==
Geography, climate and cultural traditions caused differences to develop in cattle-handling methods and equipment from one part of the United States to another. The period between 1840 and 1870 marked a mingling of cultures when English and French-descended people began to settle west of the Mississippi River and encountered the Spanish-descended people who had settled in the parts of Mexico that later became Texas and California. In the modern world, remnants of two major and distinct cowboy traditions remain, known today as the &quot;Texas&quot; tradition and the &quot;Spanish&quot;, &quot;Vaquero&quot;, or &quot;California&quot; tradition. Less well-known but equally distinct traditions also developed in Hawaii and Florida. Today, the various regional cowboy traditions have merged to some extent, though a few regional differences in equipment and riding style still remain, and some individuals choose to deliberately preserve the more time-consuming but highly skilled techniques of the pure &quot;vaquero&quot; or &quot;buckaroo&quot; tradition. The popular &quot;horse whisperer&quot; style of natural horsemanship was originally developed by practitioners who were predominantly from California and the Northwestern states, clearly combining the attitudes and philosophy of the California vaquero with the equipment and outward look of the Texas cowboy.

===California and Pacific region===

The vaquero, the Spanish or Mexican cowboy who worked with young, untrained horses, arrived in the 18th century and flourished in Alta California and bordering territories during the Spanish Colonial period. Settlers from the United States did not enter California in significant numbers until after the Mexican–American War, and most early settlers were miners rather than livestock ranchers, leaving livestock-raising largely to the Spanish and Mexican people who chose to remain in California. The California vaquero or buckaroo, unlike the Texas cowboy, was considered a highly skilled worker, who usually stayed on the same ranch where he was born or had grown up and raised his own family there. In addition, the geography and climate of much of California was dramatically different from that of Texas, allowing more intensive grazing with less open range, plus cattle in California were marketed primarily at a regional level, without the need (nor, until much later, even the logistical possibility) to be driven hundreds of miles to railroad lines. Thus, a horse- and livestock-handling culture remained in California and the Pacific Northwest that retained a stronger direct Spanish influence than that of Texas. The modern distinction between &quot;vaquero&quot; and &quot;buckaroo&quot; within American English may also reflect the parallel differences between the California and Texas traditions of western horsemanship.
====Buckaroos====
Some cowboys of the California tradition were dubbed &quot;buckaroos&quot; by English-speaking settlers. The words &quot;buckaroo&quot; and &quot;vaquero&quot; are still used on occasion in the Great Basin, parts of California and, less often, in the Pacific Northwest. Elsewhere, the term &quot;cowboy&quot; is more common.

The word &quot;buckaroo&quot; is generally believed to be an anglicized version of &quot;vaquero&quot; and shows phonological characteristics compatible with that origin. &quot;Buckaroo&quot; first appeared in American English in 1827. The word may also have developed with influences from the English word &quot;buck&quot; or bucking, the behavior of young, untrained horses. In 1960, one etymologist suggested that &quot;buckaroo&quot; derives, through , from the Ibibio and , meaning &quot;white man, master, boss&quot;. Although that derivation was later rejected, another possibility advanced was that &quot;buckaroo&quot; was a pun on &quot;vaquero&quot;, blending both Spanish and African sources.

===Texas tradition===
In the 18th century, people in Spanish Texas began to herd cattle on horseback to sell in Louisiana, both legally and illegally. By the early 19th century, the Spanish Crown, and later, independent Mexico, offered &quot;empresario&quot; grants in what would later be Texas to non-citizens, such as settlers from the United States. In 1821, Stephen F. Austin led a group which became the first English-speaking Mexican citizens. Following Texas independence in 1836, even more Americans immigrated into the &quot;empresario&quot; ranching areas of Texas. Here the settlers were strongly influenced by the Mexican &quot;vaquero&quot; culture, borrowing vocabulary and attire from their counterparts, but also retaining some of the livestock-handling traditions and culture of the Eastern United States and Great Britain. The Texas cowboy was typically a bachelor who hired on with different outfits from season to season.

Following the American Civil War, vaquero culture combined with the cattle herding and drover traditions of the southeastern United States that evolved as settlers moved west. Additional influences developed out of Texas as cattle trails were created to meet up with the railroad lines of Kansas and Nebraska, in addition to expanding ranching opportunities in the Great Plains and Rocky Mountain Front, east of the Continental Divide. The new settlers required more horses, to be trained faster, and brought a bigger and heavier horse with them. This led to modifications in the bridling and bitting traditions used by the vaquero. Thus, the Texas cowboy tradition arose from a combination of cultural influences, in addition to the need for adaptation to the geography and climate of west Texas and the need to conduct long cattle drives to get animals to market.

Historian Terry Jordan proposed in 1982 that some Texan traditions that developed—particularly after the Civil War—may trace to colonial South Carolina, as most settlers to Texas were from the southeastern United States. These theories have been questioned by some reviewers. In a subsequent work, Jordan also noted that the influence of post-War Texas upon the whole of the frontier Western cowboy tradition was likely much less than previously thought.

===Florida and the southeastern US===

The Florida &quot;cowhunter&quot; or &quot;cracker cowboy&quot; of the 19th and early 20th centuries was distinct from the Texas and California traditions. Florida cowboys did not use lassos to herd or capture cattle. Their primary tools were bullwhips and dogs. Since the Florida cowhunter did not need a saddle horn for anchoring a lariat, many did not use Western saddles, instead using a McClellan saddle. While some individuals wore boots that reached above the knees for protection from snakes, others wore brogans. They usually wore inexpensive wool or straw hats, and used ponchos for protection from rain.

Cattle and horses were introduced into Spanish Florida in the 16th century, and flourished throughout the 17th century. The cattle introduced by the Spanish persist today in two rare breeds: Florida Cracker cattle and Pineywoods cattle. The Florida Cracker Horse, which is still used by some Florida cowboys, is descended from horses introduced by the Spanish. From shortly after 1565 until the end of the 17th century, cattle ranches owned by Spanish officials and missions operated in northern Florida to supply the Spanish garrison in St. Augustine and markets in Cuba. Raids into Spanish Florida by the Province of Carolina and its Native American allies, which wiped out the native population of Florida, led to the collapse of the Spanish mission and ranching systems.

In the 18th century, Creek, Seminole, and other Indian people moved into the depopulated areas of Florida and started herding the cattle left from the Spanish ranches. In the 19th century, most tribes in the area were dispossessed of their land and cattle and pushed south or west by white settlers and the United States government. By the middle of the 19th century white ranchers were running large herds of cattle on the extensive open range of central and southern Florida. The hides and meat from Florida cattle became such a critical supply item for the Confederacy during the American Civil War that a unit of &quot;Cow Cavalry&quot; was organized to round up and protect the herds from Union raiders. After the Civil War, and into the 20th Century, Florida cattle were periodically driven to ports on the Gulf of Mexico, such as Punta Rassa near Fort Myers, Florida, and shipped to market in Cuba.

The Florida cowhunter or cracker cowboy tradition gradually assimilated to western cowboy tradition during the 20th century. Texas tick fever and the screw-worm were introduced to Florida in the early 20th century by cattle entering from other states. These pests forced Florida cattlemen to separate individual animals from their herds at frequent intervals for treatment, which eventually led to the widespread use of lassos. Florida cowboys continue to use dogs and bullwhips for controlling cattle.

===Hawai&#x27;i===
The Hawaiian cowboy, the &quot;paniolo&quot;, is also a direct descendant of the &quot;vaquero&quot; of California and Mexico. Experts in Hawaiian etymology believe &quot;Paniolo&quot; is a Hawaiianized pronunciation of &quot;español&quot;. (The Hawaiian language has no /s/ sound, and all syllables and words must end in a vowel.) Paniolo, like cowboys on the mainland of North America, learned their skills from Mexican &quot;vaqueros&quot;. Other theories of word origin suggest &quot;Paniolo&quot; was derived from &quot;pañuelo&quot; (Spanish for handkerchief) or possibly from a Hawai&#x27;ian language word meaning &quot;hold firmly and sway gracefully&quot;.

Captain George Vancouver brought cattle and sheep in 1793 as a gift to Kamehameha I, monarch of the Hawaiian Kingdom. For ten years, Kamehameha forbade killing of cattle, and imposed the death penalty on anyone who violated his edict. As a result, numbers multiplied astonishingly, and were wreaking havoc throughout the countryside. By the reign of Kamehameha III the number of wild cattle were becoming a problem, so in 1832 he sent an emissary to California, then still a part of Mexico. He was impressed with the skill of the vaqueros, and invited three to Hawai&#x27;i to teach the Hawaiian people how to work cattle.

The first horses arrived in Hawai&#x27;i in 1803. By 1837 John Parker, a sailor from New England who settled in the islands, received permission from Kamehameha III to lease royal land near Mauna Kea, where he built a ranch.

The Hawaiian style of ranching originally included capturing wild cattle by driving them into pits dug in the forest floor. Once tamed somewhat by hunger and thirst, they were hauled out up a steep ramp, and tied by their horns to the horns of a tame, older steer (or ox) that knew where the paddock with food and water was located. The industry grew slowly under the reign of Kamehameha&#x27;s son Liholiho (Kamehameha II).

Even today, traditional paniolo dress, as well as certain styles of Hawaiian formal attire, reflect the Spanish heritage of the vaquero. The traditional Hawaiian saddle, the &quot;noho lio&quot;, and many other tools of the cowboy&#x27;s trade have a distinctly Mexican/Spanish look and many Hawaiian ranching families still carry the names of the vaqueros who married Hawaiian women and made Hawai&#x27;i their home.

===Virginia===
On the Eastern Shore of Virginia, the &quot;Salt Water Cowboys&quot; are known for rounding up the feral Chincoteague Ponies from Assateague Island and driving them across Assateague Channel into pens on Chincoteague Island during the annual Pony Penning.

==Canada==

Ranching in Canada has traditionally been dominated by the province of Alberta. The most successful early settlers of the province were the ranchers, who found Alberta&#x27;s foothills to be ideal for raising cattle. Most of Alberta&#x27;s ranchers were English settlers, but cowboys such as John Ware—who brought the first cattle into the province in 1876—were American. American style open range dryland ranching began to dominate southern Alberta (and, to a lesser extent, southwestern Saskatchewan) by the 1880s. The nearby city of Calgary became the centre of the Canadian cattle industry, earning it the nickname &quot;Cowtown&quot;. The cattle industry is still extremely important to Alberta, and cattle outnumber people in the province. While cattle ranches defined by barbed-wire fences replaced the open range just as they did in the US, the cowboy influence lives on. Canada&#x27;s first rodeo, the Raymond Stampede, was established in 1902. In 1912, the Calgary Stampede began, and today it is the world&#x27;s richest cash rodeo. Each year, Calgary&#x27;s northern rival Edmonton, Alberta stages the Canadian Finals Rodeo, and dozens of regional rodeos are held through the province. British Columbia also has a significant ranching history and cowboy culture in the interior, and has been home to the Williams Lake Stampede since 1920.

==Outside North America==

The necessity for horse riders who guard herds of cattle, sheep or horses is common wherever wide, open land for grazing exists. In the French Camargue, riders called &quot;gardians&quot; herd cattle and horses. In Hungary, csikós guard horses and gulyás tend to cattle. The herders in the region of Maremma, in Tuscany (Italy) are called butteri (singular: &quot;buttero&quot;). The Asturian pastoral population is referred to as &quot;vaqueiros de alzada&quot;.

The Spanish exported their horsemanship and knowledge of cattle ranching not only to North America, but also to South America, where traditions developed such as the &quot;gaucho&quot; of Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and (with the spelling &quot;gaúcho&quot;) southern Brazil, the &quot;&quot; and &quot;Morochuco&quot; in Peru, the &quot;llanero&quot; of Venezuela, and the &quot;huaso&quot; of Chile.

In Australia, where ranches are known as stations, cowboys are known as stockmen and ringers, (&quot;jackaroos&quot; and &quot;jillaroos&quot; who also do stockwork are trainee overseers and property managers). The Australian droving tradition was influenced by Americans in the 19th century, and as well as practices imported directly from Spain. The adaptation of both of these traditions to local needs created a unique Australian tradition, which also was strongly influenced by Australian indigenous people, whose knowledge played a key role in the success of cattle ranching in Australia&#x27;s climate.

==Modern work==

On the ranch, the cowboy is responsible for feeding the livestock, branding and earmarking cattle (horses also are branded on many ranches), plus tending to animal injuries and other needs. The working cowboy usually is in charge of a small group or &quot;string&quot; of horses and is required to routinely patrol the rangeland in all weather conditions checking for damaged fences, evidence of predation, water problems, and any other issue of concern.

They also move the livestock to different pasture locations, or herd them into corrals and onto trucks for transport. In addition, cowboys may do many other jobs, depending on the size of the &quot;outfit&quot; or ranch, the terrain, and the number of livestock. On a smaller ranch with fewer cowboys—often just family members, cowboys are generalists who perform many all-around tasks; they repair fences, maintain ranch equipment, and perform other odd jobs. On a very large ranch (a &quot;big outfit&quot;), with many employees, cowboys are able to specialize on tasks solely related to cattle and horses. Cowboys who train horses often specialize in this task only, and some may &quot;Break&quot; or train young horses for more than one ranch.

The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics collects no figures for “cowboys” &quot;per se&quot;, and the definition is broad, encompassing ranch hands to rodeo performers, so the exact number of working cowboys is unknown. Working cowboys or ranch hands are included in the 2003 category, &quot;Support activities for animal production&quot;, which totals 9,730 workers averaging $19,340 per annum. In addition to cowboys working on ranches, in stockyards, and as staff or competitors at rodeos, the category includes farmhands working with other types of livestock (sheep, goats, hogs, chickens, etc.). Of those 9,730 workers, 3,290 are listed in the subcategory of &quot;Spectator sports&quot; which includes rodeos, circuses, and theaters needing livestock handlers.

===Attire===
Most cowboy attire, sometimes termed &quot;Western wear&quot;, grew out of practical need and the environment in which the cowboy worked. Most items were adapted from the Mexican &quot;vaqueros&quot;, though sources from other cultures, including Native Americans and mountain men contributed.
* Bandanna; a large cotton neckerchief that had myriad uses: from mopping up sweat to masking the face from dust storms. In modern times, is now more likely to be a silk neckscarf for decoration and warmth.
* Chaps (usually pronounced &quot;shaps&quot;) or chinks protect the rider&#x27;s legs while on horseback, especially riding through heavy brush or during rough work with livestock.
* Cowboy boots; a boot with a high top to protect the lower legs, pointed toes to help guide the foot into the stirrup, and high heels to keep the foot from slipping through the stirrup while working in the saddle; with or without detachable spurs.
* Cowboy hat; High crowned hat with a wide brim to protect from sun, overhanging brush, and the elements. There are many styles, initially influenced by John B. Stetson&#x27;s Boss of the Plains, which was designed in response to the climatic conditions of the West.
* Gloves, usually of deerskin or other leather that is soft and flexible for working purposes, yet provides protection when handling barbed wire, assorted tools or clearing native brush and vegetation.
* Jeans or other sturdy, close-fitting trousers made of canvas or denim, designed to protect the legs and prevent the trouser legs from snagging on brush, equipment or other hazards. Properly made cowboy jeans also have a smooth inside seam to prevent blistering the inner thigh and knee while on horseback.

Many of these items show marked regional variations. Parameters such as hat brim width, or chap length and material were adjusted to accommodate the various environmental conditions encountered by working cowboys.

* Lariat; from the Spanish &quot;la riata&quot;, meaning &quot;the rope&quot;, sometimes called a &quot;lasso&quot;, especially in the East, or simply, a &quot;rope&quot;. This is a tightly twisted stiff rope, originally of rawhide or leather, now often of nylon, made with a small loop at one end called a &quot;hondo&quot;. When the rope is run through the hondo, it creates a loop that slides easily, tightens quickly and can be thrown to catch animals.
* Spurs; metal devices attached to the heel of the boot, featuring a small metal shank, usually with a small serrated wheel attached, used to allow the rider to provide a stronger (or sometimes, more precise) leg cue to the horse.
* Firearms: Modern cowboys may utilize a rifle to protect livestock from wild animals or feral dogs. Rifles may be carried on horseback in a scabbard attached to a saddle. Riders may instead carry a pistol. ln modern use, firearms are often carried in a pickup truck or ATV.
* Knife; cowboys have traditionally favored some form of pocket knife, specifically the folding cattle knife or stock knife. The knife has multiple blades, usually including a leather punch and a &quot;sheepsfoot&quot; blade.

===Horses===

The traditional means of transport for the cowboy, even in the modern era, is by horseback. Horses can travel over terrain that vehicles cannot access. Horses, along with mules and burros, also serve as pack animals. The most important horse on the ranch is the everyday working ranch horse that can perform a wide variety of tasks; horses trained to specialize exclusively in one set of skills such as roping or cutting are very rarely used on ranches. Because the rider often needs to keep one hand free while working cattle, the horse must neck rein and have good &quot;cow sense&quot;—it must instinctively know how to anticipate and react to cattle.

A good stock horse is on the small side, generally under 15.2 hands (62 inches) tall at the withers and often under 1000 pounds, with a short back, sturdy legs and strong muscling, particularly in the hindquarters. While a steer roping horse may need to be larger and weigh more in order to hold a heavy adult cow, bull or steer on a rope, a smaller, quick horse is needed for herding activities such as cutting or calf roping. The horse has to be intelligent, calm under pressure and have a certain degree of &#x27;cow sense&quot; – the ability to anticipate the movement and behavior of cattle.

Many breeds of horse make good stock horses, but the most common today in North America is the American Quarter Horse, which is a horse breed developed primarily in Texas from a combination of Thoroughbred bloodstock crossed on horses of mustang and other Iberian horse ancestry, with influences from the Arabian horse and horses developed on the east coast, such as the Morgan horse and now-extinct breeds such as the Chickasaw and Virginia Quarter-Miler.

===Tack===
Equipment used to ride a horse is referred to as &quot;tack&quot; and includes:
* Bridle; a Western bridle usually has a curb bit and long split reins to control the horse in many different situations. Generally the bridle is open-faced, without a noseband, unless the horse is ridden with a tiedown. Young ranch horses learning basic tasks usually are ridden in a jointed, loose-ring snaffle bit, often with a running martingale. In some areas, especially where the &quot;California&quot; style of the &quot;vaquero&quot; or &quot;buckaroo&quot; tradition is still strong, young horses are often seen in a &quot;bosal&quot; style hackamore.
* Martingales of various types are seen on horses that are in training or have behavior problems.
* Saddle bags (leather or nylon) can be mounted to the saddle, behind the cantle, to carry various sundry items and extra supplies. Additional bags may be attached to the front or the saddle.
* Saddle blanket; a blanket or pad is required under the Western saddle to provide comfort and protection for the horse.
* Western saddle; a saddle specially designed to allow horse and rider to work for many hours and to provide security to the rider in rough terrain or when moving quickly in response to the behavior of the livestock being herded. A western saddle has a deep seat with high pommel and cantle that provides a secure seat. Deep, wide stirrups provide comfort and security for the foot. A strong, wide saddle tree of wood, covered in rawhide (or made of a modern synthetic material) distributes the weight of the rider across a greater area of the horse&#x27;s back, reducing the pounds carried per square inch and allowing the horse to be ridden longer without harm. A horn sits low in front of the rider, to which a lariat can be snubbed, and assorted dee rings and leather &quot;saddle strings&quot; allow additional equipment to be tied to the saddle.

===Vehicles===
The most common motorized vehicle driven in modern ranch work is the pickup truck. Sturdy and roomy, with a high ground clearance, and often four-wheel drive capability, it has an open box, called a &quot;bed&quot;, and can haul supplies from town or over rough trails on the ranch. It is used to pull stock trailers transporting cattle and livestock from one area to another and to market. With a horse trailer attached, it carries horses to distant areas where they may be needed. Motorcycles are sometimes used instead of horses for some tasks, but the most common smaller vehicle is the four-wheeler. It will carry a single cowboy quickly around the ranch for small chores. In areas with heavy snowfall, snowmobiles are also common. Some jobs remain, particularly working cattle in rough terrain or close quarters, that are best performed by cowboys on horseback.
==Rodeo==

The word &quot;rodeo&quot; is from the Spanish &quot;rodear&quot; (to turn), which means &quot;roundup&quot;. In the beginning there was no difference between the working cowboy and the rodeo cowboy, and in fact, the term &quot;working cowboy&quot; did not come into use until the 1950s. Prior to that it was assumed that all cowboys were working cowboys. Early cowboys both worked on ranches and displayed their skills at the roundups.

The advent of professional rodeos allowed cowboys, like many athletes, to earn a living by performing their skills before an audience. Rodeos also provided employment for many working cowboys who were needed to handle livestock. Many rodeo cowboys are also working cowboys and most have working cowboy experience.

The dress of the rodeo cowboy is not very different from that of the working cowboy on his way to town. Snaps, used in lieu of buttons on the cowboy&#x27;s shirt, allowed the cowboy to escape from a shirt snagged by the horns of steer or bull. Styles were often adapted from the early movie industry for the rodeo. Some rodeo competitors, particularly women, add sequins, colors, silver and long fringes to their clothing in both a nod to tradition and showmanship. Modern riders in &quot;rough stock&quot; events such as saddle bronc or bull riding may add safety equipment such as kevlar vests or a neck brace, but use of safety helmets in lieu of the cowboy hat is yet to be accepted, in spite of constant risk of injury.

==In popular culture==
As the frontier ended, the cowboy life came to be highly romanticized. Exhibitions such as those of Buffalo Bill Cody&#x27;s Wild West Show helped to popularize the image of the cowboy as an idealized representative of the tradition of chivalry.

In today&#x27;s society, there is little understanding of the daily realities of actual agricultural life. Cowboys are more often associated with (mostly fictitious) Indian-fighting than with their actual life of ranch work and cattle-tending. The cowboy is also portrayed as a masculine ideal via images ranging from the Marlboro Man to the Village People. Actors such as John Wayne are thought of as exemplifying a cowboy ideal, even though western movies seldom bear much resemblance to real cowboy life. Arguably, the modern rodeo competitor is much closer to being an actual cowboy, as many were actually raised on ranches and around livestock, and the rest have needed to learn livestock-handling skills on the job.

In the United States, the Canadian West and Australia, guest ranches offer people the opportunity to ride horses and get a taste of the western life—albeit in far greater comfort. Some ranches also offer vacationers the opportunity to actually perform cowboy tasks by participating in cattle drives or accompanying wagon trains. This type of vacation was popularized by the 1991 movie &quot;City Slickers&quot;, starring Billy Crystal.

===Symbolism===
In 2005, the United States Senate declared the fourth Saturday of July as &quot;National Day of the American Cowboy&quot; via a Senate resolution and has subsequently renewed this resolution each year, with the United States House of Representatives periodically issuing statements of support.
The long history of the West in popular culture tends to define those clothed in Western clothing as cowboys or cowgirls whether they have ever been on a horse or not. This is especially true when applied to entertainers and those in the public arena who wear Western wear as part of their persona. Many other people, particularly in the West, including lawyers, bankers, and other white collar professionals wear elements of Western clothing, particularly cowboy boots or hats, as a matter of form even though they have other jobs. Conversely, some people raised on ranches do not necessarily define themselves cowboys or cowgirls unless they feel their primary job is to work with livestock or if they compete in rodeos.

Actual cowboys have derisive expressions for individuals who adopt cowboy mannerisms as a fashion pose without any actual understanding of the culture. For example, a &quot;drugstore cowboy&quot; means someone who wears the clothing but does not actually sit upon anything but the stool of the drugstore soda fountain—or, in modern times, a bar stool. Similarly, the phrase &quot;all hat and no cattle&quot; is used to describe someone (usually male) who boasts about himself, far in excess of any actual accomplishments. The word &quot;dude&quot; (or the now-archaic term &quot;greenhorn&quot;) indicates an individual unfamiliar with cowboy culture, especially one who is trying to pretend otherwise.

Outside of the United States, the cowboy has become an archetypal image of Americans abroad. In the late 1950s, a Congolese youth subculture calling themselves the Bills based their style and outlook on Hollywood&#x27;s depiction of cowboys in movies. Something similar occurred with the term &quot;Apache&quot;, which in early 20th century Parisian society was a slang term for an outlaw.

===Word===
The word &quot;cowboy&quot; is sometimes used pejoratively. Originally this derived from the behavior of some cowboys in the boomtowns of Kansas, at the end of the trail for long cattle drives, where cowboys developed a reputation for violence and wild behavior due to the inevitable impact of large numbers of cowboys, mostly young single men, receiving their pay in large lump sums upon arriving in communities with many drinking and gambling establishments.

&quot;Cowboy&quot; as an adjective for &quot;reckless&quot; developed in the 1920s. &quot;Cowboy&quot; is sometimes used today in a derogatory sense to describe someone who is reckless or ignores potential risks, irresponsible or who heedlessly handles a sensitive or dangerous task. &quot;Time&quot; magazine referred to President George W. Bush&#x27;s foreign policy as &quot;Cowboy diplomacy&quot;, and Bush has been described in the press, particularly in Europe, as a &quot;cowboy&quot;, not realizing that this was not a compliment.

In English-speaking regions outside North America, such as the British Isles and Australasia, &quot;cowboy&quot; can refer to a tradesman whose work is of shoddy and questionable value, e.g., &quot;a cowboy plumber&quot;. The term also lent itself to the British 1980s TV sitcom, &quot;Cowboys&quot;. Similar usage is seen in the United States to describe someone in the skilled trades who operates without proper training or licenses. In the eastern United States, &quot;cowboy&quot; as a noun is sometimes used to describe a fast or careless driver on the highway.

<text>The vaquero (; , ) is a horse-mounted livestock herder of a tradition that has its roots in the Iberian Peninsula and extensively developed in Mexico from a method brought to the Americas from Spain. The vaquero became the foundation for the North American cowboy, in Northern Mexico, Southwestern United States, and Western Canada.

The cowboys of the Great Basin still use the term &quot;buckaroo&quot;, which may be a corruption of &quot;vaquero&quot;, to describe themselves and their tradition. Many in Llano Estacado and along the southern Rio Grande prefer the term &quot;vaquero&quot;, while the indigenous and Hispanic communities in the age-old &quot;Nuevo México&quot; and New Mexico Territory regions use the term &quot;caballero&quot;. &quot;Vaquero&quot; heritage remains in the culture of the Californio (California), Neomexicano (New Mexico), and Tejano (Texas), along with Mexico, Central and South America, as well as other places where there are related traditions.

==Etymology==
&quot;Vaquero&quot; is the Spanish word for cowherder or herder of cattle. It derives from the word vaca, the Spanish word for &quot;cow&quot; and thus, the Medieval meaning &quot;cowherd&quot;, from &quot;vacca&quot;, meaning “cow”, and the suffix &quot;-ārius&quot; used to form nouns denoting an agent of use, such as a dealer or artisan, from other nouns.

A related term, &quot;buckaroo&quot;, still is used to refer to a certain style of cowboys and horsemanship most often seen in the Great Basin region of the United States that closely retains characteristics of the traditional vaquero. The word &quot;buckaroo&quot; is generally believed to be an anglicized version of &quot;vaquero&quot; and shows phonological characteristics compatible with that origin. &quot;Buckaroo&quot; first appeared in American English in 1827. The word may also have developed with influences from the English word &quot;buck&quot; or bucking, the behavior of young, untrained horses.

==History==


The origins of the &quot;vaquero&quot; tradition come from Spain, beginning with the &quot;hacienda&quot; system of medieval Spain. This style of cattle ranching spread throughout much of the Iberian Peninsula, and it was later brought to the Americas. Both regions possessed a dry climate with sparse grass, and thus large herds of cattle required vast amounts of land in order to obtain sufficient forage. The need to cover distances greater than a person on foot could manage gave rise to the development of the horseback-mounted &quot;vaquero&quot;. 

===Arrival in the Americas===

During the 16th century, the Conquistadors, and other Spanish settlers brought their cattle-raising traditions as well as both horses and domesticated cattle to the Americas, starting with their arrival in what today is Mexico, Florida, and Central America. The traditions of Spain were transformed by the geographic, environmental and cultural circumstances of New Spain, which later became Mexico and the Southwestern United States. They also developed this culture in all of western Latin America, developing the Gaucho cowboys in Argentina, Chile, Guatemala, and Peru. In turn, the land, and people of the Americas also saw dramatic changes due to Spanish influence.

In Brazil, the &quot;vaqueiro&quot; (in Portuguese) appeared in the 16th century, in the interior, specifically in the caatinga areas in the state of Bahia.

The arrival of horses in the Americas was particularly significant, as equines had been extinct there since the end of the prehistoric ice age. However, horses quickly multiplied in America and became crucial to the success of the Spanish and later settlers from other nations. In “Libro de Albeyteria” (1580), the Spanish-Mexican horseman and veterinarian, Don Juan Suárez de Peralta, wrote about the proliferation of horses in colonial Mexico: &quot;In New Spain today there are a great number of horses, and mares, so many that they roam wild in the countryside, without an owner, which they call cimarrones, that there must be horses and mares that are over twenty years old, and they die of old age without ever seeing man; And if by chance they see any, they quickly flee to the mountains with their tails and their manes raised, resembling a deer […] None of the stable horses is superior to them in size or beauty and beautiful coats, and some have long manes growing below the knee.”

The earliest horses were originally of Spanish, Barb and Arabian ancestry, but a number of uniquely American horse breeds developed in North and South America through selective breeding and by natural selection of animals that escaped to the wild and became feral. Spanish army Captain, Bernardo Vargas Machuca, wrote in 1599, that the best and finest horses were the Mexican ones: “Horses, which were the most noble animal and of most use, God wished to greatly multiply, so much so that there is no Spaniard who is unable to breed them and even the Indians do so in the settled lands […] this animal is used more for service there than here in Spain, for the pack trains primarily use horses because those with mules serve little for loads unless it’s on Tierra Firme. There are excellent parade horses, and the stables are well stocked. The finest are Mexican horses, but in general they are all good because in addition to being light and marvelously fast, they rein well and respond to punishment, without bad habits like those from here in Spain, and they breed better and stronger hooves. They have but one fault, that they are not high-steppers, and running well comes from this; but as they are low-steppers they charge better and are lighter, and fourteen years old is not an old horse.”

The Mustang and other colonial horse breeds are now called &quot;wild&quot;, but in reality are feral horses—descendants of domesticated animals.

===16th to 19th centuries===
The Spanish tradition evolved further in what today is Mexico, and the Southwestern United States. Most &quot;vaqueros&quot; were men of mestizo, and mulatto origin while most of the &quot;hacendados&quot; (ranch owners) were ethnically Spanish. 

By the 1570’s, mulattos, and blacks had become the overwhelming majority, especially the former, as a result from the high mortality rate of the Natives in Mexico due to European and African diseases and war, according to a Mexican Mesta ordinance. The ordinance, dated March 5th, 1576, states: “Don Martin Enriquez &amp;c. Inasmuch as by the older cattle breeders of this New Spain it has been reported to me that all the cattle ranching, as well as the branding, collecting and removing the steers for the butcher shops, and doing the rodeos, was almost universally done by Mulattos, and since there began to be cattle, and cattle ranching, they had never received more than twelve, fifteen, twenty, and at most up to twenty-five or thirty pesos a year; and that for the last two years now, as there had been a high mortality of Indians who also helped in the said cattle ranching, the said Mulattos had demanded higher wages, and asked for fifty, eighty, one hundred, and even two hundred pesos, and they did not want to continue working if they were not given the said wages. . .” 

By the late 16th century, with the growth of the Mestizo population, Mestizos and Mulattos had become the bulk of the Vaquero population. In “&quot;Treatise on the Heathen Superstitions&quot;” (1629), Spanish Priest Hernando Ruiz de Alarcón explained the distinct geographic, environmental and cultural circumstances of Mexico and the racial composition of Vaqueros:
“Since in this land it is so necessary, so common and so easy for every kind of people to ride on horseback, because all the land is very rough, the settlements are very far apart, the roads lack provisions, and horses and other beasts exist in large quantities and along with this there are many herds of cattle where large quantities of Mulattos, Mestizos, Indians and other vile people work as vaqueros; […] and although the majority of those in this occupation of vaquero are mestizos or mulattos, even so I make mention here of this because Indians also take part […]”
In Santa Fe de Nuevo México, however, both Hispano and Pueblo people owned land and livestock.

Those early Vaqueros in the 16th century, whether slave or free, lived on a cattle estancia and worked for a single cattle baron for most of their lives. But towards the end of that century, in the Bajío region and in the Kingdom of Nueva Galicia, a new type of Vaquero began to appear. Called “Hombres de fuste” (saddle-tree men), “Vagamundos” (drifters, vagabonds, nomads), and “Forajidos” (outlaws), these Vaqueros roamed the Mexican countryside on horseback going from village to village, estancia to estancia, working for the highest bidder. They were superior horsemen and spent their entire lives on horseback. Many were runaway black or Mulatto slaves, others dabble in the crime of “abigeato” (cattle rustling), among other crimes. They carried weapons such as an arquebus, desjarretadera (hocking lance), sickle, and knives. Spanish priest and auditor Gaspar de la Fuente warned of the existence of these outlaw nomadic Vaqueros in a report to the King, dated April 1st, 1603 in Guadalajara: “The number of Mestizos and Mulattoes has grown so much in these realms, and so have the excesses and crimes that they commit every day, striking terror to the heart of the population, who is unable to do anything about it, because as Vaqueros, they ride on horseback with desjarretaderas and scythes, and they gather in gangs and nobody dares to confront them. His Majesty would remedy this by ordering that none of the aforementioned be able to carry such a weapon (under penalty of death) in a town or in an uninhabited place if it is not on the appointed days that they are cattle hunting, and in the company of their boss . . .”
In another description, in a letter dated April 20th, 1607, by Spanish priest and lawyer Luis Ramírez de Alarcón, states: “In the Royal mining town of Zacatecas and towards the north, it fills up with Black, Mestizo and Mulatto outlaws, all of them Vaqueros, and they cannot be captured and be punished because they have light horses and protection from the estancieros […] these people are agile, robust and grow in their generation and multiply too much, and one can very well expect trouble, because […] there are men that gather 300 horsemen from these outlaws to work as vaqueros, and most are well armed with strong cueras, arquebuses, scythes, desjarretaderas and other weapons”

===Rancheros===
Eventually, towards the 18th century, those nomadic Vaqueros, as well as those that lived on the cattle estancias, began to be known under the name of “&quot;Rancheros&quot;”. The term &quot;&quot;Ranchero&quot; comes from &quot;Rancho&quot;, a term that was given in Mexico, since the 18th century, to the countryside or hamlets where cattle were raised or land was sowed. Spanish priest, Mateo José de Arteaga, in his —&quot;Description of the Diocese of Guadalajara de Indias&quot;&quot; (1770)— defined &quot;Rancho&quot; as: &quot;&quot;those places in which few people live with few goods and housed in huts&quot;. While the Spanish friar, José Alejandro Patiño, in his text —&quot;Topografía del Curato de Tlaxomulco&quot; (1778)— defined it as: &quot;In these Indian kingdoms, Ranchos are country houses of little pomp and value, where men of average means and the poor live, cultivating the small plots of land that they own or rent, sowing to the extent that each one can afford and raising their domestic, country animals, according to their strength&quot;.&quot; 

These rural lands and hamlets, were part of a Hacienda, since most land belonged to the landed elites. Thus, a hacienda was made up of &quot;Ranchos&quot;, and in those Ranchos lived the people that worked for the hacienda, the &quot;Rancheros&quot;. The &quot;Rancheros&quot; managed the cattle and horses, working as &quot;Vaqueros&quot;, &quot;Caporales&quot;, &quot;Mayordomos&quot; or &quot;Horse-tamers&quot;, among other jobs. By the 1840s, Spanish (from Spain) dictionaries included the Mexican definition of Rancho as: &quot;&quot;In Mexico it is a separate farmhouse dependent on a hacienda&quot;; while for &quot;Ranchero&quot; they give the definition: &quot;the one who lives on a rancho; it is usually understood the same as&quot; CAMPESINO [countryman, or farmer]&quot;. Spanish historian and journalist Niceto de Zamacois, defined the terms Ranchero and Rancho, as follows: The men of the countryside who carry out their jobs on horseback are given the name of &quot;Rancheros,&quot; derived from the word Rancho that is applied to a small hacienda, or to a part of a large one that is divided into villages or ranchos. Those who carry out the same tasks in the haciedas of Veracruz are given the name of &quot;Jarochos.&quot;

Thomas Mayne Reid, an Irish-American novelist who fought in the Mexican-American War, defined the terms in the 1840’s, as follows:
The &quot;RANCHERO&quot; is a Mexican countryman, above the order of the serf or peon. He is the vaquero at times, or the arriero [muleteer], or he may be possessed of a small holding, and farm it for himself. He is a great horseman, and always mounted, galloping after cattle, or amusing himself in some other way. The &quot;Vaquero&quot; is also a ranchero; so, too, is the montero, who is so called from living in a mountainous district. 

VAQUERO - A &quot;Vaquero&quot; is a ranchero or countryman, who looks after cattle. As Mexico is chiefly a grazing country it will be seen that there are many of its inhabitants employed in this pursuit. The vaquero is always mounted, and generally well dressed. He carries the lazo constantly; and he is the man, above all others, who can use it with dexterity. He can fling it over a bull&#x27;s horns twenty yards off, or loop it round the foot of the animal when going at a full gallop! This feat I have witnessed a hundred times. Your vaquero is also expert in the game of &quot;Colea de toros&quot; or &quot; bull-tailing&quot;—that is, he can, on horseback, catch the tail of a running bull —whip it under the hind leg— and fling the animal on its back! This feat also have I witnessed over and again. The vaquero takes his name from &quot;vacas,&quot; signifying cows or cattle.

Thus, &quot;Ranchero&quot; is the inhabitant of the Mexican countryside, a horse-mounted countryman, who performed all his duties on the hacienda or countryside on horseback, working as &quot;Vaqueros&quot; and &quot;Caporales&quot;, among other jobs. The term “Charro” started off in the 18th century as a derogatory term for Rancheros, synonymous with the English terms yokel, or “bumpkin”, but evolved to be synonymous with Ranchero; thus both, &quot;Ranchero&quot; and &quot;Charro&quot; were, historically, the same thing, a name for the people of the countryside, more specifically the horse-mounted country people (horsemen). Although, in some instances, Charro was used specifically, for the Vaqueros of “&quot;Tierra&quot;-&quot;Adentro&quot;”, or the interior land, which included the Bajio and northern Mexico, or anything beyond north of Mexico City. English naval officer and explorer, George Francis Lyon, explained that while most Rancheros had a light, active and sinewy frame, some of the vaqueros of the &quot;Tierra Adentro&quot; were as tall and muscular as the Yorkshiremen. Rancheros or Charros were known for their superb horsemanship and athleticism, and for their colorful and unique costume, designed for horse riding.

In his book —&quot;Mexico in 1842&quot; (1844)– Spanish lawyer and monarchist, Luis Manuel del Rivero, wrote: The Ranchero is a man of higher thoughts, very strong, great horseman, a good drinker, who spends a peso without hesitation when he has any; that when he walks he drags his colossal and sonorous spurs, while handling his quirt; that on horseback he never gets rid of his machete, tucked under his thigh, and often crossing it with that of his adversary, or with that of a friend, giving or receiving a slash merely for fun and amusement. He is a man who, confined in his rancheria, cultivates the land with his wife and children, or perhaps leaves this servile occupation to his family, and he gives himself up to the noblest of arms in the woods and at crossroads. He is a man that when he works in the haciendas, he performs all his tasks on horseback and follows his master everywhere, to whom he usually sells his body and soul. He is an Arab in his habits, a little nomadic, and more specifically in the knowledge and handling of the horse, which he raises and educates like a son, works him without compassion, and loves him with delirium as the faithful companion of his adventures, and the noble instrument of his amusements and his glories. His attire, boots made of leather with which the leg is wrapped several times; spurs, as I have said, colossal; wide leather or cloth pants over cloth underwear; cotton shirt; a sash with which the waist is secured; a cotona, that is, a short leather jacket that is worn over the head, and a very large and heavy chambergo or Jarano hat. For overdress, a Manga or Serape. His horse&#x27;s trappings are no less grotesque, since the Vaquero saddle with its large stirrups and flaps, especially if it is complemented by an anquera, water shields and other trifles, is a world in the midst of which the Ranchero finds himself in his world, and he believes himself superior to all the powerful men of the earth, executing extremely difficult spins and movements.

An 1849 report on Guanajuato, in the Bajio region, states:“The horsemen of the countryside wear the dress we call &quot;Charro&quot;, that is, leather or cloth pants with many buttons; embossed deer or goat skin boots; large spurs and a wide-brimmed hat, which are accompanied by the manga or serape, and water shields.”

Mexican traditions spread both South and North, influencing equestrian traditions from Argentina to Canada.

As English-speaking traders and settlers expanded westward, English and Spanish traditions, language and culture merged to some degree. Before the Mexican–American War in 1848, New England merchants who traveled by ship to California encountered both &quot;hacendados&quot; and &quot;vaqueros&quot;, trading manufactured goods for the hides and tallow produced from vast cattle ranches. American traders along what later became known as the Santa Fe Trail had similar contacts with &quot;vaquero&quot; life. Starting with these early encounters, the lifestyle and language of the &quot;vaquero&quot; began a transformation which merged with English cultural traditions and produced what became known in American culture as the &quot;cowboy&quot;.

Mesteñeros were Charros that caught, broke and drove Mustangs to market in the Spanish and later Mexican, and then American territories. They caught the horses that roamed in Northern Mexico, the Great Plains and the San Joaquin Valley of California, and later in the Great Basin, from the 18th century to the early 20th century.

===Modern United States===
&quot;Vaqueros invented the cowboy trade as we know it today.&quot; The vaquero heritage had an influence on cowboy traditions which arose throughout the California, Hawaii, Montana, New Mexico, Texas, and broader Western United States, distinguished by their own local culture, geography and historical patterns of settlement. Cowboy styles reflect origins in Texas, the southeast, and Mexico, while buckaroos have adopted, quite remarkably intact, techniques from Spanish and Mexican California. &quot;The Southwestern United States has a &quot;caballero&quot; heritage that originates in New Mexico&#x27;s Hispanic and indigenous groups from the region, whereas the &quot;Texas&quot; &quot;vaquero&quot; tradition melded Tejano techniques with ranching styles of eastern states from Louisiana to Florida, while the &quot;buckaroo&quot; or &quot;California&quot; tradition resembled Northern Mexico traditions. The modern distinction between &quot;caballero&quot;, &quot;vaquero&quot;, and &quot;buckaroo&quot; within American English reflects parallels between traditions of western horsemanship.

====American Southwest====
In the Southwestern United States, the Hispano, Pueblo, Navajo, and Apache traditions of Santa Fe de Nuevo México continue to hold significant influence over cowboy lifestyles in the region. This area became the New Mexico Territory and eventually the Southwestern US states of New Mexico, Arizona, and the southern portions of Colorado, Nevada, and Utah. Descendants of the Hispano and indigenous cowboys of former &quot;Nuevo México&quot; have long been referred to as &quot;caballero&quot; or &quot;caballera&quot;, a Spanish term which translates to gentlemen or lady, but regionally means cowboy or cowgirl.

Cowboys in the Southwest are associated with popularizing Native American jewelry, Christian icons, Southwestern and New Mexican cuisine, Western music styles of Tejano and New Mexico music, along with other aspects into the general Western lifestyle.

====California tradition====
Cowboys of this tradition were dubbed &quot;buckaroos&quot; by English-speaking settlers. The words &quot;buckaroo&quot; and &quot;vaquero&quot; are still used on occasion in the Great Basin, parts of California and, less often, in the Pacific Northwest. Elsewhere, the term &quot;cowboy&quot; is more common. The &quot;vaqueros&quot; of the Americas were the horsemen and cattle herders of New Spain, who first came to California with the Jesuit priest Eusebio Kino in 1687, and later with expeditions in 1769 and the Juan Bautista de Anza expedition in 1774. They were the first cowboys in the region.

Even though the lands of the California &quot;vaqueros&quot; were fertile for farming, &quot;it was not the disposition of Spanish Californians to over-exert themselves, so the raising of cattle, which was little drain on the energies, was a very much more agreeable way of life than farming ... there were few in the world who could surpass ... [the] vaquero in horsemanship.&quot; The future Mexican or Spanish vaqueros were placed in the saddle at 5 years of age, and sometimes earlier, and worked with young, often trained horses, which had originally arrived from Mexico in the 18th century and flourished in California and bordering territories during the Spanish/Mexican era.

Although the Californios were considered by most foreigners as great horsemen, their treatment and method of training the horses was frowned upon. Englishman William Robert Garner mention that their method of breaking and training horses: “. . . &quot;likewise tends to break the spirit of the animals, and injure them in their joints.[…] when it is tired they take the saddle off it, and make it fast to a post, without anything to eat, and keep it there for four or five days, on nothing but water&quot;.” William Redmond Ryan, another English writer and immigrant, said that: “&quot;of the wild horses subjected to this process of training, at least one-fourth are killed, and a still larger proportion seriously injured&quot;.” German immigrant Edward Vischer once commented that: “&quot;The barbarous Californians look upon a horse as a useful commodity which is of little value and easily replaced&quot;.”

Settlers originally arriving from the United States prior to 1846 (Mexican War) could marry a Californio woman or apply for Mexican citizenship in order to receive a land grant, which would then almost require the new &quot;citizen&quot; to acquire the &quot;vaquero&quot; skills and life styles, a life style in which he would &quot;invariably [keep] a horse saddled before his door, awaiting his pleasure. If it was necessary to go more than fifty steps, he rode.&quot; After the conquest of California, with the conclusion of the Mexican–American War in 1848, Americans began to flood the newly conquered territory with immigration, for the 1849 goldrush, which resulted in most of them being miners rather than livestock ranchers. The California vaquero or buckaroo, unlike the Texas cowboy, was considered a highly skilled worker, who usually stayed on the same ranch where he was born or had grown up. He generally married and raised a family. In addition, the geography and climate of much of California was dramatically different from that of Texas, allowing more intensive grazing with less open range, plus cattle in California were marketed primarily at a regional level, without the need (nor, until much later, even the logistical possibility) to be driven hundreds of miles to railroad lines. Thus, a horse- and livestock-handling culture remained in California and the Pacific Northwest that retained a stronger direct Mexican and Spanish influence than that of Texas.

====Texas tradition====

The Texas tradition arose from a combination of cultural influences, as well as the need to adapt to the geography and climate of west Texas and, later, the need to conduct long cattle drives to get animals to market. In the early 1800s, the Spanish Crown, and later, independent Mexico, offered &quot;empresario&quot; grants in what would later be Texas to non-citizens, such as settlers from the United States. In 1821, Stephen F. Austin and his East Coast comrades became the first Anglo-Saxon community in Texas. Following Texas independence in 1836, even more Americans immigrated into the &quot;empresario&quot; ranching areas of Texas. Here the settlers were strongly influenced by the Mexican &quot;vaquero&quot; culture, borrowing vocabulary and attire from their counterparts, but also retaining some of the livestock-handling traditions and culture of the Eastern United States and Great Britain.

Following the American Civil War, vaquero culture diffused eastward and northward, combining with the cow herding traditions of the eastern United States that evolved as settlers moved west. Other influences developed out of Texas as cattle trails were created to meet up with the railroad lines of Kansas and Nebraska, in addition to expanding ranching opportunities in the Great Plains and Rocky Mountain Front, east of the Continental Divide. The Texas-style vaquero tended to be an itinerant single male who moved from ranch to ranch.

====Hawaiian paniolo====
The Hawaiian cowboy, the &quot;paniolo&quot;, is also a direct descendant of the &quot;vaquero&quot; of California and Mexico. Experts in Hawaiian etymology believe &quot;Paniolo&quot; is a Hawaiianized pronunciation of &quot;español&quot;. (The Hawaiian language has no /s/ sound, and all syllables and words must end in a vowel.) Paniolo, like cowboys on the mainland of North America, learned their skills from Mexican &quot;vaqueros&quot;.

Curtis J. Lyons, scientist and assistant government surveyor, wrote in 1892 for the Hawaiian Historical Society, that:

By the early 19th century, Capt. George Vancouver&#x27;s gift of cattle to Pai`ea Kamehameha, monarch of the Hawaiian Kingdom, had multiplied astonishingly, and were wreaking havoc throughout the countryside. About 1812, John Parker, a sailor who had jumped ship and settled in the islands, received permission from Kamehameha to capture the wild cattle and develop a beef industry.

The Hawaiian style of ranching originally included capturing wild cattle by driving them into pits dug in the forest floor. Once tamed somewhat by hunger and thirst, they were hauled out up a steep ramp, and tied by their horns to the horns of a tame, older steer (or ox) that knew where the paddock with food and water was located. The industry grew slowly under the reign of Kamehameha&#x27;s son Liholiho (Kamehameha II). Later, Liholiho&#x27;s brother, Kauikeaouli (Kamehameha III), visited California, then still a part of Mexico. He was impressed with the skill of the Mexican vaqueros, and invited several to Hawaii in 1832 to teach the Hawaiian people how to work cattle.

Even today, traditional paniolo dress, as well as certain styles of Hawaiian formal attire, reflect the Spanish heritage of the vaquero. The traditional Hawaiian saddle, the &quot;noho lio,&quot; and many other tools of the cowboy&#x27;s trade have a distinctly Mexican/Spanish look and many Hawaiian ranching families still carry the names of the vaqueros who married Hawaiian women and made Hawaii their home.

<doc id="167748" wikidata="Q8394" url="?curid=167748" title="Sex position">
<text>A sex position is a positioning of the bodies that people use to engage in sexual intercourse or other sexual activities. Sexual acts are generally described by the positions the participants adopt in order to perform those acts. Though sexual intercourse generally involves penetration of the body of one person by another, sex positions commonly involve non-penetrative sexual activities.

Three broad and overlapping categories of sexual activity are commonly practiced: vaginal sex, anal sex, and oral sex (mouth-on-genital or mouth-on-anus). Sex acts may also be part of a fourth category, manual sex, which is stimulating the genitals or anus by using fingers or hands. Some acts may include stimulation by a device (sex toy), such as a dildo or vibrator. There are numerous sex positions that participants may adopt in any of these types of sex acts, and some authors have argued that the number of sex positions is essentially limitless.
==History==
Sex manuals typically present a guide to sex positions. They have a long history. In the Greco-Roman era, a sex manual was written by
Philaenis of Samos, possibly a hetaira (courtesan) of the Hellenistic period (3rd–1st century BC). The &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; of Vatsyayana, believed to have been written in the 1st to 6th centuries, has a notorious reputation as a sex manual. Different sex positions result in differences in the depth and angle of sexual penetration. Alfred Kinsey categorized six primary positions, The earliest known European medieval text dedicated to sexual positions is the &quot;Speculum al foderi&quot;, (The Mirror of Coitus) a 15th-century Catalan text discovered in the 1970s.

==Exclusively penetrative==
These positions involve the insertion of a phallic object(s) (such as a penis, strap-on dildo, plug, or other nonporous object(s)) into a vagina, anus or mouth.

===Penetrating partner on top with front entry===

In the missionary position, the participants face each other. The receiving partner lies on their back with legs apart, while the penetrating partner lies on top. This position and the following variations may be used for vaginal or anal intercourse.

*The penetrating partner stands in front of the receiving partner, whose legs dangle over the edge of a bed or some other platform like a table.
*With the receiving partner&#x27;s legs lifted towards the ceiling and resting against the penetrating partner, this is sometimes called the &quot;butterfly position&quot;. This can also be done as a kneeling position.
*The receiving partner lies on their back. The penetrating partner stands and lifts the receiving partner&#x27;s pelvis for penetration. A variant is for the receiving partner to rest their legs on the penetrating partner&#x27;s shoulders.
*The receiving partner lies on their back, legs pulled up straight and knees near to the head. The penetrating partner holds the receiving partner&#x27;s legs and penetrates from above.
*Similarly to the previous position, but the receiving partner&#x27;s legs need not be straight and the penetrating partner wraps their arms around the receiving partner to push the legs as close as possible to the chest. Called &quot;the stopperage&quot; in Burton&#x27;s translation of &quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot;.
*The &quot;coital alignment technique&quot;, a position where a woman is vaginally penetrated by a man, and the penetrating partner moves upward along the woman&#x27;s body until the penis is pointing down, the dorsal side of the penis now rubbing against the clitoris.
*The receiving partner crosses their feet behind their head (or at least puts their feet next to their ears), while lying on their back. The penetrating partner then holds the receiving partner tightly around each instep or ankle and lies on the receiving partner full-length. A variation is to have the receiving partner cross their ankles on their stomach, knees to shoulders, and then have the penetrating partner lie on the receiving partner&#x27;s crossed ankles with their full weight. Called the &quot;Viennese oyster&quot; by &quot;The Joy of Sex&quot;.

===Penetrating from behind===

Most of these positions can be used for either vaginal or anal penetration. Variants include:
*The receiving partner is on all fours with their torso horizontal and the penetrating partner inserts either their penis or sex toy into either the vagina or anus from behind.
*The receiving partner&#x27;s torso is angled downwards and the penetrating partner raises their own hips above those of the receiving partner for maximum penetration.
*The penetrating partner places their feet on each side of the receiving partner while keeping their knees bent and effectively raising up as high as possible while maintaining penetration. The penetrating partner&#x27;s hands usually have to be placed on the receiving partner&#x27;s back to keep from falling forward.
*The receiving partner kneels upright while the penetrating partner gently pulls the receiving partner&#x27;s arms backwards at the wrists towards them.

In the &quot;spoons position&quot; both partners lie on their side, facing the same direction. Variants of this technique include the following:
*The receiving partner lies on their side. The penetrating partner kneels and penetrates from behind. Alternatively, the penetrating partner can stand if the receiving partner is on a raised surface.
*The receiving partner lies facing down in prone position, possibly with their legs spread. The penetrating partner lies on top of them. The placement of a pillow beneath the receiving partner&#x27;s hips can help increase stimulation in this position.
*The receiving partner lies face down, knees together. The penetrating partner lies on top with spread legs.
*The receiving partner lies on their side with their uppermost leg forward. The penetrating partner kneels astride the receiver&#x27;s lowermost leg.

===Receiving partner on top===

Most of these positions can be used for either vaginal or anal penetration.
When the receiving partner is a woman, these positions are sometimes called the &quot;woman on top&quot;, or &quot;cowgirl&quot; positions.

A feature of these positions is that the penetrating partner lies on their back with the receiving partner on top:
*The receiving partner can kneel while straddling the penetrating partner, with the participants facing each other.
*Alternatively, the receiving partner can face away from the penetrating partner. This position is sometimes called the &quot;reverse cowgirl&quot; position.
*The receiving partner can arch back with hands on the ground.
*The receiving partner can squat (instead of kneel) facing the penetrating partner.
*The receiving partner can bring forward their knees against the ground.
*The penetrating partner lies with their upper back on a low table, couch, chair or edge of bed, keeping their feet flat on the floor and back parallel to floor. The receiving partner straddles them, also keeping their feet on the floor. Receiving partner can assume any of various positions.
*The &quot;lateral coital position&quot; was recommended by Masters and Johnson, and was preferred by three quarters of their heterosexual study participants after having tried it. The position involves the male on his back, with the female rolled slightly to the side so that her pelvis is atop his, but her weight is beside his. This position can also be used for anal penetration, and is not limited to heterosexual partners.

===Sitting and kneeling===

Most of these positions can be used for either vaginal or anal penetration.
*The penetrating partner sits on an area surface, legs outstretched. The receiving partner sits on top and wraps their legs around the penetrating partner. Called &quot;pounding on the spot&quot; in the Burton translation of &quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot;. If the penetrating partner sits cross-legged, it is called the &quot;lotus position&quot; or &quot;lotus flower&quot;. The position can be combined with fondling of erogenous zones.
*The penetrating partner sits in a chair. The receiving partner straddles penetrating partner and sits, facing the penetrating partner, feet on floor. This is sometimes called a &quot;lap dance&quot;, which is somewhat erroneous as a lap dance typically does not involve penetration. The receiving partner may also sit in reverse, with their back to the penetrating partner.
*The penetrating partner sits on a couch or in a chair that has armrests. The receiving partner sits in the penetrating partner&#x27;s lap, perpendicular to penetrating partner, with their back against the armrest.
*The penetrating partner kneels while the receiving partner lies on their back, ankles on each side of penetrating partner&#x27;s shoulders.

===Standing===
Most of these positions can be used for either vaginal or anal penetration. In the basic standing position, both partners stand facing each other. The following variations are possible:
*In the basic standing position, both partners stand facing each other and engage in vaginal sex. In order to match heights, the shorter partner can, for instance, stand on a stair or wear high heels. It may be easier to maintain solid thrusts if the woman has her back to a wall. With such a support, the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; calls this position the &quot;Suspended Congress&quot;. This position is most often used in upright places, such as a wall in a bedroom or a shower.
*The penetrating partner stands, and the receiving partner wraps their arms around his neck, and their legs around his waist, thereby exposing either the vagina or anus to the man&#x27;s penis. This position is made easier with the use of a solid object behind the receiver, as above. To assume this position, it can be easier to start with the receiving partner laying on their back on the edge of a bed; the penetrating partner puts his elbows under their knees, enters them, and then lifts them as he rises to a standing position. In Japan, this is colloquially called the &quot;Ekiben&quot; position, after a specific bento lunch box sold at train stations.
*Alternatively, the receiving partner can face away from the penetrating partner which allows for anal sex. This position is varied by having the receiving partner assume different semi-standing positions. For instance, they may bend at the waist, resting their hands or elbows on a table.

===Anal sex positions===
These positions involve anal penetration: 
*Doggy style penetration maximizes the depth of penetration, but can pose the risk of pushing against the sigmoid colon. If the receiving partner is male, this increases the chances of stimulating the prostate. The penetrating partner controls the thrusting rhythm. A variation is the &quot;leapfrog position&quot;, in which the receiving partner angles their torso downward. The receiving partner may also lie flat and face down, with the penetrating partner straddling their thighs. 
*In the missionary positions, to achieve optimal alignment, the receiving partner&#x27;s legs should be in the air with the knees drawn towards their chest. Some sort of support (such as a pillow) under the receiving partner&#x27;s hips can also be useful. The penetrating partner positions themselves between the receiving partner&#x27;s legs. The penetrating partner controls the thrusting rhythm. This position is often cited as good for beginners, because it allows them to relax more fully than is usual in the doggy style position.
*The spoons position allows the receiving partner to control initial penetration and the depth, speed and force of subsequent thrusting.
*The &quot;receiving partner on top&quot; positions allow the receiving partner more control over the depth, rhythm and speed of penetration. More specifically, the receiving partner can slowly push their anus down on the penetrating partner, allowing time for their muscles to relax.

===Less common positions===

These positions are more innovative, and perhaps not as widely known or practiced as the ones listed above.

*The receiving partner lies on their back with knees up and legs apart. The penetrating partner lies on their side perpendicular to the receiver, with the penetrating partner&#x27;s hips under the arch formed by receiver&#x27;s legs. This position is sometimes called the &quot;T-square&quot;.

*The receiving partner&#x27;s legs are together turning to one side while looking up towards the penetrator, who has spread legs and is kneeling straight behind the other&#x27;s hips. The penetrator&#x27;s hands are on the other&#x27;s hips. This position can be called the &quot;modified T-square&quot;.
*The &quot;Seventh Posture&quot; of Burton&#x27;s translation of &quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot; is an unusual position not described in other classical sex manuals. The receiving partner lies on their side. The penetrating partner faces the receiver, straddling the receiver&#x27;s lower leg, and lifts the receiver&#x27;s upper leg on either side of the body onto the crook of penetrating partner&#x27;s elbow or onto the shoulder. While some references describe this position as being &quot;for acrobats and not to be taken seriously&quot;, others have found it very comfortable, especially during pregnancy.
*The &quot;piledriver&quot; is a difficult position sometimes seen in porn videos. It is described in many ways by different sources. In a heterosexual context, the woman lies on her back, then raises her hips as high as possible, so that her partner, standing, can enter her vaginally or anally. The position places considerable strain on the woman&#x27;s neck, so firm cushions should be used to support her.
*The receiver lies face down legs spread on the edge of the bed and parallel to the floor, while the penetrator stands behind, holding both legs.
*The &quot;rusty bike pump&quot; is similar to a piledriver where penetration is achieved from above at a downward angle with the receiving partner bottom side up.

====Others====
*The receiving partner is on the bottom. The penetrating partner lies on top perpendicularly to them.
*The penetrating partner lies on their back, legs spread. The receiving partner is on their back on top of the penetrator, legs spread, facing the opposite direction.
*The penetrator and the receiver lie on their backs, heads pointed away from one another. Each places one leg on the other&#x27;s shoulder (as a brace) and the other leg out somewhat to the side.
*The receiving partner lies on their back with the penetrating partner lying perpendicular. The receiving partner bends the knee closest to the penetrating partner&#x27;s head enough so that there is room for the penetrating partner&#x27;s waist to fit beneath it, while the penetrating partner&#x27;s legs straddle the receiving partner&#x27;s other leg. The in-and-out thrusting action will move more along a side-to-side rather than top-to-bottom axis. This position allows for breast stimulation during sex, for partners to maintain eye contact if they wish, and for a good view of both partners as they reach orgasm.
*The penetrating partner sits on edge of a bed or chair with feet spread wide on floor. The receiving partner lies on their back on the floor and drapes their legs and thighs over the legs of the penetrating partner. The penetrating partner holds the knees of the receiving partner and controls thrusts.

===Using furniture or special apparatus===
Most sex acts are typically performed on a bed or other simple platform. As the range of supports available increases, so does the range of positions that are possible. Ordinary furniture can be used for this purpose. Also, various forms of erotic furniture and other apparatus such as fisting slings and trapezes have been used to facilitate even more exotic sexual positions.

===Positions to promote or prevent conception===
Pregnancy is a potential result of any form of sexual activity where sperm comes in contact with the vagina; this is typically during vaginal sex, but pregnancy can result from anal sex, digital sex (fingering), oral sex, or by another body part, if sperm is transferred from one area to the vagina between a fertile female and a fertile male. Men and women are typically fertile during puberty. Though certain sexual positions are believed to produce more favorable results than others, none of these are effective means of contraception.

===Positions during pregnancy===
The goal is to prevent excessive pressure on the belly and to restrict penetration as required by the particular partners. Some of the positions below are popular positions for sex during pregnancy.

*Woman on top: takes the pressure off of the woman&#x27;s abdomen and allows her to control the depth and frequency of thrusting.
*Woman on back: like the missionary, but with less pressure on abdomen or uterus. The woman lies on her back and raises her knees up towards her chest. The partner kneels between her legs and enters from the front. A pillow is placed under her bottom for added comfort.
*Sideways: also keeps pressure off of her abdomen while supporting her uterus at the same time.
*Spooning: very popular positions to use during the late stages of pregnancy; allowing only shallow penetration and relieves the pressure on the abdomen.
*Sitting: she mounts the sitting partner, relieving her abdomen of pressure.
*From behind: allowing her to support abdomen and breasts.

==Non-exclusively penetrative==
===Oral sex positions===
Oral sex is genital stimulation by the mouth. It may be penetrative or non-penetrative, and may take place before, during, as, or following intercourse. It may also be performed simultaneously (for example, when one partner performs cunnilingus, while the other partner performs fellatio), or only one partner may perform upon the other; this creates a multitude of variations.

====Fellatio====

&quot;Fellatio&quot; is oral sex performed on the penis. Possible positions include:
* Sitting
** The receiver lies on their back while the partner kneels between the receiver&#x27;s legs.
** The receiver lies on their back while the partner lies off to the side of their legs.
** The receiver sits in a chair, the partner kneels in front of them between their legs.
* Standing
** The receiver stands while the partner either kneels in front of them or sits (in a chair or on the edge of a bed, etc.) and bends forward.
** The receiver stands while the partner, also standing, bends forward at the waist.
** The receiver stands or crouches at the edge of the bed, facing the bed. The active partner lies on the bed with their head hanging over the edge of the bed backward. The receiver inserts their penis into the partner&#x27;s mouth, usually to achieve &quot;deep throat&quot; penetration.
* Lying
** While the active partner lies on their back, the receiver assumes the missionary position but adjusted forward.
** The active partner (with breasts) lies on their back, and the receiver inserts their penis between the breasts, and into the mouth.

====Cunnilingus====

&quot;Cunnilingus&quot; is oral sex performed on the vulva. Possible positions include:
*The receiver lies on her back as in the missionary position. The active partner lies on their front between their legs.
*The active partner sits. The receiver stands facing away and bends at the hips.
*The active partner sits. The receiver stands or squats facing towards partner and may arch their back, to create further stimulation.
*The active partner lies on their back while the receiver kneels with their legs at their sides and their vulva on their mouth. In other words, the receiver sits on the partner&#x27;s face.
*The receiver rests on all fours as in the doggy style position. The partner lies on their back with their head under their vulva. Their feet may commonly extend off the bed and rest on the floor.
*The receiver stands, possibly bracing themself against a wall. The active partner kneels in front of them.
*The receiver sits on the bed with their legs open, the active partner kneels in front of them.
*The receiver is upside-down (standing on hands, held by partner, or using support, such as bondage or furniture), with the active partner standing or kneeling (depending on elevation) in front or behind. Such a position may be difficult to achieve, or maintain for extended time periods, but the rush of blood to the brain can alter stimulation&#x27;s effect.
*The receiver stands on hands, resting each leg on either side of the active partner&#x27;s head, with the active partner standing or kneeling facing them. Depending on which way up the receiver is facing, different stimulation and levels of comfort may be available.

====Sixty-nine====
Simultaneous oral sex between two people is called &quot;69&quot;. They can lie side-by-side, lie one on top of the other, or stand with one partner holding the other upside down.

====Anilingus====
&quot;Anilingus&quot; is oral sex performed on the anus. Positions for anilingus are often variants on those for genital-oral sex. Possible positions include:
*The passive partner is on all fours in the doggy position with the active partner behind.
*The passive partner is on their back in the missionary position with their legs up.
*The passive partner on top in the 69 position.
*The &quot;rusty trombone&quot;, in which a male stands while the active partner performs both anilingus from behind, generally from a kneeling position, and also manually stimulates the standing partner&#x27;s penis, thus somewhat resembling someone playing the trombone.

===Other positions===
*&quot;Fingering&quot; of the vulva, vagina or anus.
*&quot;Fisting&quot;: inserting the entire hand into the vagina or rectum.

==Non-penetrative==

&quot;Non-penetrative sex&quot; or &quot;frottage&quot; generally refers to a sexual activity that excludes penetration, and often includes rubbing one&#x27;s genitals on one&#x27;s sexual partner. This may include the partner&#x27;s genitals or buttocks, and can involve different sex positions. As part of foreplay or to avoid penetrative sex, people engage in a variety of non-penetrative sexual behavior, which may or may not lead to orgasm.

*&quot;Dry humping&quot;: frottage while clothed. This act is common, although not essential, in the dance style known as &quot;grinding&quot;.
*&quot;Handjob&quot;: manual stimulation of a partner&#x27;s penis. 
*&quot;Fingering&quot;: manual stimulation of a partner&#x27;s vulva. 
*&quot;Footjob&quot;: using the feet to stimulate the genitals.
*&quot;Mammary intercourse&quot;: using the breasts together to stimulate the penis through the cleavage.
*&quot;Axillary intercourse&quot;: with the penis in the armpit. Commonly known as &quot;bagpiping&quot;.
*&quot;Orgasm control&quot;: By self or by a partner managing the physical stimulation and sensation connected with the emotional and physiologic excitement levels. Through the practice of masturbation, an individual can learn to develop control of their own body&#x27;s orgasmic response and timing. In partnered stimulation, either partner can control their own orgasmic response and timing. With mutual agreement, either partner can similarly learn to control or enhance their partner&#x27;s orgasmic response and timing. Partnered stimulation orgasm techniques referred to as expanded orgasm, extended orgasm or orgasm control can be learned and practiced for either partner to refine their control of the orgasmic response of the other. Partners mutually choose which is in control or in response to the other.

The slang term &quot;humping&quot; may refer to masturbation—thrusting one&#x27;s genitals against the surface of non-sexual objects, clothed or unclothed; or it may refer to penetrative sex.

===Genital–genital rubbing===
Genital–genital rubbing (often termed GG rubbing by primatologists to describe the ubiquitous behavior among female bonobos) is the sexual act of mutually rubbing genitals; it is commonly grouped with &quot;frottage&quot;, as well as other terms, such as &quot;non-penetrative sex&quot; or &quot;outercourse&quot;:
*&quot;Intercrural sex&quot; or &quot;interfemoral sex&quot;: the penis is placed between the partner&#x27;s thighs, perhaps rubbing the vulva, scrotum or perineum.
*&quot;Frot&quot;: two males mutually rubbing penises together.
*&quot;Tribadism&quot;: two females mutually rubbing vulvae together.
*&quot;Docking&quot;: inserting the glans penis into the foreskin of another penis.

==Group sex==

People may participate in group sex. While group sex does not imply that all participants must be in sexual contact with all others simultaneously, some positions are only possible with three or more people.

As with the positions listed above, more group sex positions become practical if erotic furniture is used.

===Threesomes===
When three people have sex with each other, it is called a &quot;threesome&quot;. Possible ways of having all partners in sexual contact with each include some of the following:
*One person performs oral sex on one partner while they engage in receptive anal or vaginal intercourse with the other partner. Sometimes called a &quot;spit roast&quot;.
*The &quot;369&quot; position is where two people engage in oral sex in the 69 position while a third person positions himself to penetrate one of the others; usually a man engaging in sex doggie-style with the woman on top in the 69 position.
*A man has vaginal or anal sex with one partner, while himself being anally penetrated by another (possibly with a strap-on dildo).
*Two participants engage in cowgirl position, a third straddles man&#x27;s face allowing him to go down on them. Generally called a &quot;double cowgirl.&quot;
*Three partners lie or stand in parallel, with one between the other two. Sometimes called a &quot;sandwich&quot;. This term may specifically refer to the &quot;double penetration&quot; of a woman, with one penis in her anus, and the other in her vagina or of a male, with two penises in his anus.
*Two participants have vaginal/anal sex with each other, and one/both perform oral sex on a third.
*Three people perform oral/vaginal/anal sex on one another simultaneously, commonly called a &quot;daisy chain&quot;.
*The slang term &quot;lucky Pierre&quot; is sometimes used in reference to the person playing the middle role in a threesome, being anally penetrated while engaging in penetrative anal or vaginal sex.

===Foursomes===
*A &quot;469&quot; is a four-person sexual position where two individuals engage in 69 oral sex while a third and a fourth person both position themselves on each end to penetrate the two engaged in simultaneous oral sex; similar to a 369, with the addition of a fourth person.

===With many participants===
These positions can be expanded to accommodate any number of participants:
*A group of males masturbating is called a &quot;circle jerk&quot;.
*Sexual intercourse involving multiple women in which one man is the central focus is known as &quot;reverse gangbang&quot;.
*A group of males masturbating and ejaculating on one person&#x27;s face is known as &quot;bukkake&quot;.
*A group of men, women, or both, each performing oral sex upon each other, in a circular arrangement, is a &quot;daisy chain&quot;.
*When one woman or man is given the serial or parallel attention of many, often involving a queue (&quot;pulling a train&quot;), it is often termed a &quot;gang bang&quot;.

===Multiple penetration===

A person may be sexually penetrated multiple times simultaneously. Penetration may involve use of fingers, toes, sex toys, or penises. Scenes of multiple penetration are common in pornography.

If one person is penetrated by two objects, it is generically called &quot;double penetration&quot; (&quot;DP&quot;). Double penetration of the vagina, anus, or mouth can involve:
*Simultaneous penetration of the anus by two penises or other objects. This is commonly called &quot;double anal penetration (DAP)&quot;.
*Simultaneous penetration of the vagina by two penises or other objects. This is commonly called &quot;double vaginal penetration (DVP)&quot; or &quot;double stuffing&quot;.
*Simultaneous penetration of the vagina and anus. The &quot;shocker&quot; accomplishes this using several fingers of one hand.
*Simultaneous penetration of the mouth and either the vagina or anus. If the penetrating objects are penises, this is sometimes called the &quot;spit roast&quot;, the &quot;Chinese finger trap&quot;, or the &quot;Eiffel tower&quot;.

== Cultural differences and preferences ==
Sexual practices vary between cultures. Latin American couples that recorded their sexual activities do not practice the missionary position as much as couples from United States reported. The duration of sexual intercourse seems to be similar amongst European and Latin American couples.

<text>A bunker buster is a type of munition that is designed to penetrate hardened targets or targets buried deep underground, such as military bunkers.

==Armor piercing shells==
===Germany===
Röchling shells were bunker-busting artillery shells, developed by the German engineer August Coenders, based on the theory of increasing sectional density to improve penetration. They were tested in 1942 and 1943 against the Belgian Fort d&#x27;Aubin-Neufchâteau.

==Aircraft delivered bombs==

===World War II===

==== Germany ====
In World War II the Luftwaffe developed a series of unguided rocket-propelled armor-piercing bombs for use against shipping and fortifications.

====United Kingdom====

In World War II, the British designer Barnes Wallis, already famous for inventing the bouncing bomb, designed two bombs that would become the conceptual predecessors of modern bunker busters: the five tonne Tallboy and the ten tonne Grand Slam. These were &quot;Earthquake&quot; bombs—a concept he had first proposed in 1939. The designs were very aerodynamic, allowing them to exceed the speed of sound as they fell from 22,000 ft (6,700 m). The tails were designed with offset fins causing the bombs to spin as they fell. Using the same principle as a spinning top, this enabled them to resist being deflected, thereby improving accuracy. They had casings of high grade steel, much stronger than the typical World War II bomb so that they would survive hitting a hardened surface, or penetrate deep into the ground.

Though these bombs might be thought of as &quot;bunker busters&quot; today, in fact the original &quot;earthquake&quot; theory was more complex and subtle than simply penetrating a hardened surface. The earthquake bombs were designed not to strike a target directly, but to impact beside it, penetrate under it, and create a &#x27;camouflet&#x27;, or large buried cavern, at the same time as delivering a shock wave through the target&#x27;s foundations. The target then collapses into the hole, no matter how hardened it may be. The bombs had strong casings because they needed to travel through rock rather than reinforced concrete, though they could perform equally well against hardened surfaces. In an attack on the Valentin U-Boat pens at Farge, two Grand Slams went through the 15 ft (4.5 m) reinforced concrete hardening—equalling or exceeding the best current penetration specifications.

The British &quot;Disney&quot; bomb (officially &quot;4500 lb [2,000 kg] Concrete piercing/Rocket Assisted Bomb&quot;, also known as the &quot;Crab&quot;) was a World War II device designed to be used against U-boat pens and other super-hardened targets. Devised by Captain Edward Terrell RNVR of the Admiralty&#x27;s Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development, it had a streamlined hardened case and weighed about including the rocket assembly. The actual explosive content was about .

For accuracy, the bombs had to be dropped precisely from a pre-determined height (usually ). They would free-fall for around 30 seconds until, at , the rockets were ignited, causing the tail section to be expelled. The rocket burn lasted for three seconds and added to the bomb&#x27;s speed, giving a final impact speed of , approximately Mach 1.29. Post-war tests demonstrated that the bombs were able to penetrate a thick concrete roof, with the predicted (but untested) ability to penetrate of concrete.

====United States====
Post war, the US added a form of remote guidance to the Tallboy to create the &quot;Tarzon&quot;, a bomb deployed in the Korean War against an underground command center near Kanggye.

===Modern===
The BLU-109 bomb is intended to penetrate concrete shelters and other hardened structures before exploding. It entered service in 1985. Israeli F-15I fighter jets are believed to have used BLU-109s in the strikes that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut on 27 September 2024.

During Operation Desert Storm (1991), there was a need for a deep penetration bomb similar to the British weapons of World War II, but none of the NATO air forces had such a weapon. As a stop-gap, some were developed over a period of 28 days, using old 8 inch (203 mm) artillery barrels as casings. These bombs weighed over two tons but carried only of high explosive. They were laser-guided and were designated &quot;Guided Bomb Unit-28 (GBU-28)&quot;. It was proven effective for the intended role.

An example of a Russian bunker buster is the KAB-1500L-Pr. It is delivered with the Su-24M and the Su-34 aircraft. It is stated to be able to penetrate 10–20 m of earth or 2 m of reinforced concrete. The bomb weighs , with being the high explosive penetrating warhead. It is laser guided and has a reported strike accuracy of CEP.

The US has a series of custom made bombs such as the Paveway series of laser-guided bombs to penetrate hardened or deeply buried structures:

More recently, the US has developed the GBU-57.

Turkey is another country known to be developing bunker busters, such as the SARB-83 and NEB-84.

== Fuzing ==
The traditional fuze is the same as a classic armor-piercing bomb: a combination of timer and a sturdy dynamic propeller on the rear of the bomb. The fuze is armed when the bomb is released, and detonates when the propeller stops turning and the timer has expired.

Modern bunker busters may use a traditional fuze, but some also include a microphone and microcontroller. The microphone listens, and the microcontroller counts the number of floors until the bomb breaks through the desired numbers of floors.
Northrop Grumman is working on the Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze (HTVSF), an electronic, cockpit programmable, fuze capable of destroying deeply buried and targets. It provides multiple delay arming and detonation times, as well as a void-sensing capability, which allows for precision activation of the fuze for weapons to explode when they reach an open space in a deeply buried bunker.
==Missiles==
The extra speed provided by a rocket motor enables greater penetration of a missile-mounted bunker buster warhead. To reach maximum penetration (impact depth), the warhead may consist of a high-density projectile only. Such a warhead carries more energy than a warhead with chemical explosives (kinetic energy of a projectile at hypervelocity).

==Nuclear==
The nuclear bunker buster is the nuclear weapon version of the bunker buster. The non-nuclear component of the weapon is designed to greatly enhance the penetration into soil, rock, or concrete to deliver a nuclear warhead to a target. These weapons would be used to destroy hardened, underground military bunkers deeply buried. In theory, the amount of radioactive nuclear fallout would be reduced from that of a standard, air-burst nuclear detonation because they would have relatively low explosive yield. However, because such weapons necessarily come into contact with large amounts of earth-based debris, they may, under certain circumstances, still generate significant fallout. Warhead yield and weapon design have changed periodically throughout the history of the design of such weapons. An underground explosion releases a larger fraction of its energy into the ground, compared to an explosion at or above the surface which releases most of its energy into the atmosphere.

<text>Agfa-Gevaert N.V. (Agfa) is a Belgian-German multinational corporation that develops, manufactures, and distributes analogue and digital imaging products, software, and systems.

The company began as a dye manufacturer in 1867. In 1925, the company merged with several other German chemical companies to become chemicals giant IG Farben. IG Farben would go on to play major role in the economy of Nazi Germany. It extensively employed forced and slave labor during the Nazi period, and produced Zyklon B poison gas used in the Holocaust. IG Farben was disestablished by the Allies in 1945. AGFA was reconstituted (as a subsidiary of Bayer) from the remnants of IG Farben in 1952. 

Agfa photographic film and cameras were once prominent consumer products. In 2004, the consumer imaging division was sold to a company founded via management buyout. AgfaPhoto GmbH, as the new company was called, filed for bankruptcy after a year, and its brands are now licensed to other companies by AgfaPhoto Holding GmbH, a holding firm. Today Agfa-Gevaert&#x27;s commerce is 100% business-to-business.

== History ==
* 1867 The company Aktiengesellschaft für Anilinfabrikation &quot;(Corporation for Aniline Production)&quot; was founded in Rummelsburg (now in the Lichtenberg borough of Berlin) as a manufacturer of dyes and stains. It became a public limited company in 1873. The founders were Paul Mendelssohn Bartholdy (son of composer Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy) and Carl Alexander von Martius.
* 1894 The company L. Gevaert &amp; Cie was founded in Antwerp, Belgium, arising from the workshop for the manufacture of photographic paper belonging to Lieven Gevaert.

==Company structure==
Agfa is headquartered in Mortsel, Belgium, with sales organisations in 40 countries. In countries where Agfa does not have its own sales organisation, the market is served by a network of agents and representatives. At the end of 2011, the company had 11,728 employees (full-time equivalent permanent) worldwide. Agfa has manufacturing plants around the world. The largest production and research centres are based in Belgium, the United States, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and China. Net sales for 2011 totalled 3,023 million euros.

Since January 1, 2019, two new entities emerged within the Agfa-Gevaert Group: Agfa HealthCare (ITCo) and Agfa (MainCo). Agfa HealthCare groups all IT-related activities of the former Agfa HealthCare business group. The newer Agfa includes the activities of the former Agfa Graphics and Agfa Specialty Products business groups, as well as the Imaging activities of the former Agfa HealthCare business group.

=== Agfa Healthcare ===
Agfa Healthcare is a developer of medical imaging information systems, with main offices in Mortsel (Belgium), Ghent (Belgium), Waterloo (Ontario, Canada), Shanghai (China) and Vienna (Austria).

=== Agfa division business groups ===
The activities of the Agfa division have been subdivided into three groups: Offset Solutions (the prepress business of the former Agfa Graphics business group), Digital Print &amp; Chemicals (the inkjet business of the former Agfa Graphics business group and the activities of the former Agfa Specialty Products business group) and Radiology Solutions (the imaging activities of the former Agfa HealthCare business group).

==Products==

In 2004, Agfa-Gevaert withdrew from the consumer market, including photographic film, cameras and other photographic equipment.

Because Agfa-Gevaert still produce photographic films for the aerial photography market, it is still possible to buy fresh, Agfa-produced photographic films for use in consumer cameras. They are sold by the Lomography Society and Rollei and are branded accordingly. This is because those companies purchase the aerial photography film from Agfa-Gevaert, and then cut and package it into consumer photographic formats.

As of 2012, such products carry a small Agfa logo discreetly on their packaging, but are not sold as Agfa branded products.

By contrast, Agfaphoto branded photographic films are not made by Agfa-Gevaert at all, originally having been made by the now closed Ferrania plant in Italy. Agfaphoto films are now produced by Fujifilm in Japan for Lupus Imaging Media.

<text>The Sussex Archaeological Society is an organisation dedicated to researching and preserving the history and archaeology of the English counties of East Sussex and West Sussex. It manages six historic sites, including Lewes Castle and Fishbourne Roman Palace.

==History==
The discovery in 1845 of remains of Lewes Priory during the construction of the Brighton, Lewes and Hastings Railway sparked interest in the county&#x27;s history and in the formation of an archaeological society. On 18 June 1846 a meeting was convened by Mark Antony Lower, William Henry Blaauw and William Figg at County Hall in Lewes at which the Sussex Archaeological Society was formally established.

In 1864 the Society appointed its first curator and librarian, and in 1866 the first museum catalogue was compiled. Having rented space in Castle Lodge, the Society later acquired Barbican House, which continues to house its museum and library.

==Activities==
The Sussex Archaeological Society organises excavations, talks and conferences on the archaeology and history of Sussex and offers research facilities at its library. Its chief executive is currently Andrew Edwards.

As well as supervising excavations in Sussex, it also publishes the &quot;Sussex Archaeological Collections&quot; and an annual report, and administers the Long Man of Wilmington. It manages six historic properties and museums, which are open to the public:

* Fishbourne Roman Palace
* Lewes Castle and Barbican House Museum
* Anne of Cleves House, Lewes
* Michelham Priory
* Marlipins Museum, Shoreham-By-Sea
* The Priest House, West Hoathly

In 2006 the Society began an archeological investigation in the Tide Mills area, which, according to the Newhaven Local &amp; Maritime Museum, would include not only the tide mill but also a record of the entire East Beach site, comprising the mills, railway station, nurses home, Chailey Heritage Marine Hospital, Newhaven Seaplane Base, holiday homes and the Newhaven Marconi Radio Station.

In 2020 the society received a £250,000 grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund to cover costs during the Covid-19 pandemic. It also received £323,800 from the British government&#x27;s Culture Recovery Fund in 2021.

==Notable members==
==Publications==
The Society has published an official journal, &quot;Sussex Archaeological Collections&quot;, annually since 1848 with a few gaps. The current editor is Jaime Kaminski.

<doc id="167769" wikidata="Q3474024" url="?curid=167769" title="Saturday Night (musical)">
<text>Saturday Night is a 1955 musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, and a book by Julius J. Epstein, based on the play, &quot;Front Porch in Flatbush&quot;, written by Epstein and his brother Philip.

The first professional musical written by Stephen Sondheim, &quot;Saturday Night&quot; was intended to open on Broadway in 1955; however, after the sudden death of its lead producer, the show was shelved. Sondheim then went on to make his professional premiere in 1957, as the lyricist for &quot;West Side Story&quot;. 

Following a student production, &quot;Saturday Night&quot; was staged at the Bridewell Theatre, London in 1997 and then in Chicago in 1999 and Off-Broadway in 2000. The musical also ran in the West End in 2009.

==Background==
&quot;Saturday Night&quot; was scheduled to open in the 1954-55 Broadway season. Announcements of the production appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and auditions were held in mid-1955, following some revisions to the music brought about by backers&#x27; auditions. In the summer of 1955, it appeared that &quot;Saturday Night&quot; would be Sondheim&#x27;s musical debut on Broadway that fall. However, in August 1955, lead producer Lemuel Ayers died, leaving the production with little morale and even less cash. The production was scrapped, and the musical material shelved.

The show nearly made it to Broadway in 1960, after Jule Styne decided to revive it after working with Sondheim on &quot;Gypsy&quot;. However, during the audition process, Sondheim halted proceedings due to feeling that his compositional level had outstripped what he had written six years previously. Although a handful of songs from the musical have appeared in revues and on Sondheim compilation albums, the score as a whole went unperformed until 1997.

==Productions==
The Stephen Sondheim Society supported the first ever fully staged performance of the musical at the University of Birmingham, having been given permission to stage the show by Sondheim himself. The production was overseen by Professor Stephen Banfield who, also with permission from Sondheim, orchestrated the show for full band from the existing piano scores. Unfortunately, Sondheim was unable to attend but sent his best wishes to all involved. It was then repeated, in a concert version, the following year at the Bridewell Theatre, London, with Sondheim in attendance. During the post-show Q &amp; A session, one of the members of The Stephen Sondheim Society asked Mr. Sondheim if he would now allow the show to be performed publicly. He agreed to think about it having previously always said &#x27;no!&#x27; and Carol Metcalfe, Artistic Director of The Bridewell Theatre, immediately volunteered to stage it. Directed by Carol Metcalfe and Clive Paget, &quot;Saturday Night&quot; opened at the Bridewell Theatre on December 17, 1997 and closed on January 24, 1998 after 38 performances. The leading role of Gene Gorman was played by Sam Newman. A cast recording was made, distributed by First Night (UK) and RCA Victor (US).

Following that production, the show had its US premiere with the Pegasus Players in Chicago. It opened at the O&#x27;Rourke Center for the Performing Arts, Truman College, Chicago, on May 19, 1999 and closed on July 18, 1999. Gary Griffin directed, with choreography by Marc Robin. Sondheim wrote two new song/scenes, &quot;Delighted, I&#x27;m Sure&quot; and &quot;Montana Chem&quot;. The original book was edited by Sondheim, and there were new orchestrations by Jonathan Tunick. The copyright date for &quot;Delighted, I&#x27;m Sure&quot; is 1954 by Sondheim. The other songs have copyright dates from 1973 (Tribute show) to 1999 (Chicago production) and are all by music publishers.

The New York premiere was at the Off-Broadway Second Stage Theatre on February 17, 2000, where it ran until March 26, 2000, for 45 performances. The Second Stage production was directed and choreographed by Kathleen Marshall, and featured David Campbell (Gene), Lauren Ward (Helen), Natascia Diaz (Florence), Christopher Fitzgerald (Bobby), Andréa Burns (Celeste) &amp; Clarke Thorell (Hank). This production won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Lyrics. A recording was made with this original New York cast, released on June 20, 2000 by Nonesuch (ASIN: B00004TG64).

When asked his reaction to seeing &quot;Saturday Night&quot; performed in New York after 40 years, Sondheim replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t have any emotional reaction to &quot;Saturday Night&quot; at all — except fondness. It&#x27;s not bad stuff for a 23-year-old. There are some things that embarrass me so much in the lyrics — the missed accents, the obvious jokes. But I decided, Leave it. It&#x27;s my baby pictures. You don&#x27;t touch up a baby picture — you&#x27;re a baby!&quot;

Magnormos produced the Australasian premiere of &quot;Saturday Night&quot; in Melbourne in 2003, directed by the company&#x27;s founder Aaron Joyner. It was first presented at Chapel Off Chapel, and then at the newly opened Federation Square, the first work of musical theatre performed in The Edge theatre. It had successful reviews and was a sell-out. In 2010 &quot;Saturday Night&quot; was the first musical in Magnormos&#x27; &quot;A Sondheim Triptych&quot; to celebrate the composer&#x27;s 80th birthday, and it became the first musical theatre piece to perform in the Elisabeth Murdoch Hall, Melbourne Recital Centre.

Primavera Productions produced the first UK revival at the fringe Jermyn Street Theatre in London, running from February 10, 2009 through March 14, 2009; this was the UK premiere of the revised Off-Broadway score. The musical then opened in the West End on March 25, 2009 through April 11 at the Arts Theatre. Directed by Tom Littler, with Musical Direction by Tom Attwood, and the cast included Helena Blackman, David Ricardo-Pearce, David Botham,
Charlie Cameron, Lee Drage, Lloyd Gorman, Joanna Hickman, Joanna Hollister, Kevin Millington, David Osmond, Nick Trumble and Harry Waller.

In October 2011 the Signature Theatre in Arlington County, Virginia presented a concert staging of &quot;Saturday Night&quot; in its MAX Theatre. The production, directed by Matthew Gardiner, starred Geoff Packard as Gene, Susan Derry as Helen, Eleasha Gamble as Florence/Dakota, William Beech as Bobby, and Tracy Lynn Olivera as Celeste.

In November 2014 the York Theatre Company (New York City) presented a concert staging of &quot;Saturday Night&quot; as part of its Musicals in Mufti series. The cast included Andrew Keenan-Bolger, Lindsay Mendez, and Ben Fankhauser.

==Plot synopsis==
In 1929 in Brooklyn, New York, middle-class bachelor friends are restless on several Saturday nights because they have no dates. Gene, who works in a menial position in a Wall Street brokerage, has dreams of the exciting society life to be found in Manhattan, while his friends are content to stay in the neighborhood. Gene meets Helen, who is crashing a party (as is Gene). He schemes to &quot;get rich quick&quot;, but his plan backfires and he barely escapes jail.

<text>The University of Surrey is a public research university in Guildford, Surrey, England. The university received its royal charter in 1966, along with a number of other institutions following recommendations in the Robbins Report. The institution was previously known as Battersea College of Technology and was located in Battersea Park, London. Its roots however, go back to Battersea Polytechnic Institute, founded in 1891 to provide further and higher education in London, including its poorer inhabitants.

The university is a member of the Association of MBAs and is one of four universities in the University Global Partnership Network. It is also part of the SETsquared partnership along with the University of Bath, the University of Bristol, the University of Southampton, and the University of Exeter. The university&#x27;s main campus is on Stag Hill, close to the centre of Guildford and adjacent to Guildford Cathedral. Surrey Sports Park is situated at the nearby Manor Park, the university&#x27;s secondary campus. Among British universities, the University of Surrey had the 41st highest average UCAS Tariff for new entrants in 2020.

The university holds a number of formal links with institutions worldwide, including the Surrey International Institute, launched in partnership with the Dongbei University of Finance and Economics. The university owns the Surrey Research Park, providing facilities for over 110 companies engaged in research. Surrey has been awarded three Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prizes for its research, with the 2021 Research Excellence Framework seeing the university rise 12 places to 33rd in the UK for overall research quality and 41% of the university&#x27;s research outputs classified as &quot;world leading&quot;. It was named &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; University of the Year in 2016, was nominated again for the same accolade in 2023, and was &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; University of the Year for Graduate Employment in 2022.

The chancellor of the university is Prince Edward, Duke of Kent. Current and emeritus academics at the university include ten Fellows of the Royal Society, twenty-one Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering, one Fellow of the British Academy and six Fellows of the Academy of Social Sciences. Surrey has educated many notable alumni, including Olympic gold medallists, several senior politicians, as well as a number of notable persons in various fields including the arts, sports and academia. Graduates typically abbreviate the University of Surrey to &quot;Sur&quot; when using post-nominal letters after their degree.

== History ==

===Foundation and early period===

The University of Surrey was preceded by the Battersea Polytechnic Institute which was founded in 1891 and admitted its first students in 1894. Its aim was to provide greater access to further and higher education for Londoners, including some of the city&#x27;s &quot;poorer inhabitants&quot;. In 1901, evening classes provided instruction in subjects such as Mechanical Engineering and Building, Electrical Engineering, Chemical and other trades, Physics and Natural Science, Maths, Languages, Commercial subjects, Music and special classes for women including Domestic Economy subjects. Day classes consisted of Art, Science, Women&#x27;s Subjects and Gymnastics, and classes were also offered in preparation for university and professional examinations. The institute focused on science and technology subjects, and from about 1920 taught University of London students, awarding University of London external degrees.

In 1956, the institute was among the first to receive the designation &quot;College of Advanced Technology&quot; and was renamed Battersea College of Technology. By the beginning of the sixties, the college had virtually outgrown its building in Battersea and had decided to move to Guildford. In addition to this, the Robbins Report of 1963 proposed that the Colleges of Advanced Technology, including Battersea, should expand and become degree-awarding universities. In 1965, the university-designate acquired a greenfield site in Guildford from Guildford Cathedral, Guildford Borough Council and the Onslow Village Trust.

===University status===
On 9 September 1966 the University of Surrey was established by royal charter. In 1967, on the day before the installation ceremony of the first Chancellor of the university, the Aberfan disaster occurred. Alfred Robens, Baron Robens of Woldingham who was appointed the first Chancellor, was also the chairman of the National Coal Board, and as such was expected to visit the site of the disaster. Controversially, in a decision parodied by &quot;Private Eye&quot;, Robens continued with the ceremony in Guildford to become Chancellor. During this transition period, visitors to the Battersea campus on 25 October 1968 saw Led Zeppelin perform their very first gig, advertised as being at the university&#x27;s Victorian Great Hall, on Battersea Park Road. By 1970 the move from Battersea to Guildford was complete.

The university&#x27;s Battersea Court consists of halls of residence which were named in honour of the university&#x27;s Battersea origins.

Between 1982 and 2008, the university became the trustee of the building of the Guildford Institute, using parts of the building for its adult education programme and providing a university presence in the heart of Guildford. The Assessment and Qualifications Alliance (formerly Associated Examining Board) moved from Aldershot to its own headquarters building on the Stag Hill campus in 1985. The university marked its Silver Jubilee in 1991, an event celebrated by the publishing of &quot;Surrey – The Rise of a Modern University&quot; by Roy Douglas and by a Service of Thanksgiving in Guildford Cathedral attended by HM The Queen in March 1992.

In 1998, due to the ongoing development in the relationship between the university and the nearby Roehampton Institute, it was decided to form an academic federation. In November 1999, the Privy Council approved the necessary changes to the university&#x27;s Charter and Statutes and the Roehampton Institute became the University of Surrey Roehampton at the beginning of 2000. Between 2000 and 2004, the university and Roehampton worked together as the Federal University of Surrey. In June 2004, the Privy Council granted Roehampton an independent university title, and it became Roehampton University from 1 August 2004, ending the partnership between the institutions.

The university celebrated its 35th anniversary in May 2002 with a major event in Guildford Cathedral. It was also marked by the unveiling of &quot;The Surrey Scholar&quot; sculpture (by Allan Sly FBS) to mark the Golden Jubilee of Her Majesty The Queen and as a gift to the people of Guildford. &quot;The Surrey Scholar&quot; is at the bottom of Guildford High Street. &quot;Understanding the Real World&quot;, a visual history of the university, by Christopher Pick, was published to coincide with this anniversary. In 2007, the university saw a major increase in overall applications by 39% compared with the previous year. This was followed by a further increase in applications of 12% in 2008. In October 2008, the university lost out to Royal Holloway in a bid to merge with London medical institute St George&#x27;s, University of London. From September 2009, the Guildford School of Acting became a subsidiary of the university and relocated from Guildford town centre to the university campus.

In March 2019 the university announced it would have to make £15m worth of cuts owing to the effects of Brexit and anticipated cuts in tuition fees, and was offering redundancy to all staff. Following the announcement, &quot;The Stag&quot;, published an article titled &#x27;Paygate: The Problem with Surrey&#x27;s Vice-Chancellor&#x27;, in which it compared Vice-Chancellor Max Lu&#x27;s &quot;performance-related bonuses&quot; to the university&#x27;s actual performance. Soon after, in May 2019, staff and students held a no confidence vote against the university management, with coverage largely focused on Lu&#x27;s leadership. Of all the unionised staff who voted, 96% gave a vote of no confidence in &quot;the Vice-Chancellor and Executive Board&quot;. The all-staff vote was approved by all three trade unions represented at the university, in a meeting held with the largest member attendance seen. Concerns raised by staff specifically include &quot;Lu&#x27;s language which suggests staff are a cost rather than an asset&quot;, according to the University and College Union, while the Students&#x27; Union was specifically concerned about the closure of many arts courses at the university despite a &quot;healthy&quot; number of applications for them. Students who wanted a &quot;no&quot; vote hoped this result would make the university management &quot;engage with staff and students and discuss changes&quot;.

==Buildings and sites==


===Main sites===

The university began moving in 1968 to a new site on Stag Hill in Guildford, adjacent to Guildford Cathedral. Students continued to alternate between the original Battersea campus and the new Guildford campus until 1970. A further allocated to the university remained undeveloped until 2005. The BBC&#x27;s local radio station for Surrey and North-East Hampshire, BBC Surrey, has its studios on the campus. In addition the university has a student-run medium wave radio station, &quot;Stag Radio&quot;. In September 2009, the Guildford School of Acting moved into a new purpose-built facility on the main Stag Hill campus as part of a strategic merger between the two organisations. The old Sports Centre was converted into the Ivy Arts Centre, a performing arts facility housing a 200-seat theatre and studio and workshop space. In October 2015, the £45m School of Veterinary Medicine was opened by the Queen accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh. The new Manor Park campus, designed as a car-free village, is from the Stag Hill campus and on the other side of the A3 trunk road. It combines residences for students and staff, buildings for research and teaching, and sporting facilities.

===Sports facilities===

In April 2010, a £36 million sports centre named the Surrey Sports Park opened to replace the former UniSport facilities on the Stag Hill Campus. Surrey Sports Park is situated close to the main University campus, on its Manor Park site. It houses a 50-metre swimming pool, three multi-sports halls, six squash courts, a modern gym, three artificial floodlit pitches, outdoor tennis courts, a climbing centre and a coffee shop, bar and restaurant.

The 1,000 seat indoor arena is home to Surrey Scorchers basketball team (formerly Guildford Heat, Surrey Heat and Surrey United), who have been using the venue since 2010 following a move from their previous home at Guildford Spectrum. Surrey Scorchers are one of the leading teams and former winners of the British Basketball League, the country&#x27;s top division. It also plays host to Surrey Storm netball (formerly Brunel Hurricanes), who also made the move to the Sports Park from Guildford Spectrum in 2010. Surrey Storm are two-time Netball Superleague champions, securing their last title with a 55–53 win over Manchester Thunder at London&#x27;s Copper Box Arena in the 2016 Grand Final. It played host to all but four matches of the 2010 Women&#x27;s Rugby World Cup (the semi-finals, third place play off and final were held at the Twickenham Stoop). It is also the official training facility for Harlequins rugby club, playing host to their Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s first teams plus Academy fixtures, and was used as a training base for the 2015 Rugby World Cup, hosting a number of teams including South Africa, Scotland and Italy.

2012 saw Surrey Sports Park host a number of Olympic and Paralympic teams in preparation for the London 2012 Olympic Games, including delegations from across the globe for swimming, table tennis, basketball and triathlon camps. In 2013, Surrey Sports Park hosted the annual Danone Nations Cup junior football tournament, with fixtures being played on the outdoor pitches through to the finals at Wembley Stadium. In 2017, Surrey Sports Park hosted the Women&#x27;s Lacrosse World Cup, with over 25 nations competing for the world title in Guildford. All matches took place at the venue, including the finals, with a temporary outdoor stadium erected for the 10-day event.

Prince Edward, Duke of Kent was installed as Chancellor, a ceremonial non-residential post, in 1977. The university is led at the executive level by the President and Vice-Chancellor, Max Lu. The key bodies in the university governance structure are the council, Senate and executive board. The council is the governing body of the university, responsible for the overall planning and management of the university and to ensure processes are in place to monitor financial and operational controls, and the university&#x27;s performance against its strategy. The council is composed of no fewer than eleven external members, up to seven ex-officio members and up to three members elected by Senate.

The Senate is the statutory body responsible for governing the university&#x27;s academic matters, including teaching and research, and the regulation and direction of the education and conduct of students. The composition of the Senate is drawn from the academic staff of the university, together with a number of ex-officio, elected and co-opted members. The Chair of the Senate is the President and Vice-Chancellor of the university. The executive board is the senior advisory body that assists the President and Vice-Chancellor in discharging his executive authority to manage the operations and affairs of the university. It is responsible for advising on all matters relating to the university&#x27;s strategy and for making recommendations to Council for approval. The above Bodies are supported by a series of Committees that oversee the activities of distinctive administrative and academic areas of the university.

On 3 December 2015 it was announced that Max Lu would become the university&#x27;s fifth President and Vice-Chancellor, taking up his appointment in April 2016. He succeeded Sir Christopher Snowden who moved to take up the Vice-Chancellorship at the University of Southampton in September 2015. Sir Christopher joined Surrey on 1 July 2005. His predecessors are Patrick J. Dowling (1994–2005), Anthony Kelly (1975–1994) and Peter Leggett, the last Principal of Battersea College of Technology and the university&#x27;s first Vice-Chancellor.

==Student life==
=== Students&#x27; Union ===

The University of Surrey Students&#x27; Union is the sole representative body of Surrey students. They represent students on academic and welfare issues, as well as administering sports clubs and societies. The Union was incorporated as a non-profit charity in July 2011, so any takings from the Union&#x27;s four commercial outlets are invested in supporting the membership side of the business. Four zones exist within the organisation representing Support, Voice, Community and Activity, with a sabbatical officer managing each one, as well as a president who is a member of the University Council. The Students&#x27; Union also organise events on a weekly basis which are held at their venues including Rubix and The Basement for students to take part in.

In 2017 the university was specifically identified in the report by the Free Speech University Rankings as having &quot;unfamiliar&quot; restrictions on free speech because of a collection of its union byelaws regarding university mascot Steve the Stag: the mascot is not allowed to be depicted by students to be drinking, smoking or, as the report and subsequent articles directly quote, &quot;involved in lewd acts&quot;.
Subsequent editions of the Students&#x27; Union Byelaws contained a further explanatory note for this.

===Media===
StagTV is the television station run by students at the University of Surrey. It is primarily run from offices on the main Stag Hill campus and it also creates content for the Students&#x27; Union, through which it is a constituted group, but has editorial independence. Other student media on campus include Stag Radio and &quot;The Stag&quot; magazine.

<text>The National Theatre (NT), officially the Royal National Theatre and sometimes referred to in international contexts as the National Theatre of Great Britain, is a performing arts venue and associated theatre company located in London, England. The theatre was founded by Laurence Olivier in 1963 and many well-known actors have since performed with it.

The company was based at The Old Vic theatre in Waterloo until 1976. The current building is located next to the Thames in the South Bank area of central London. In addition to performances at the National Theatre building, it tours productions at theatres across the United Kingdom. The theatre has transferred numerous productions to Broadway and toured some as far as China, Australia and New Zealand. However, touring productions to European cities were suspended in February 2021 over concerns about uncertainty over work permits, additional costs and delays because of Brexit. Permission to add the &quot;Royal&quot; prefix to the name of the theatre was given in 1988, but the full title is rarely used. The theatre presents a varied programme, including Shakespeare, other international classic drama, and new plays by contemporary playwrights. Each auditorium in the theatre can run up to three shows in repertoire, thus further widening the number of plays which can be put on during any one season. However, the post-2020 covid repertoire model became straight runs, required by the imperatives of greater resource efficiency and financial constraint coupled with the preference (and competition for the availability) of creatives working across stage and screen, thus bringing it in line with that of most theatres.

In June 2009, the theatre began National Theatre Live (NT Live), a programme of simulcasts of live productions to cinemas, first in the United Kingdom and then internationally. The programme began with a production of &quot;Phèdre&quot;, starring Helen Mirren, which was screened live in 70 cinemas across the UK. NT Live productions have since been broadcast to over 2,500 venues in 60 countries around the world. In November 2020, National Theatre at Home, a video on demand streaming service, specifically created for National Theatre Live recordings, was introduced. Videos of plays are added every month, and can be &quot;rented&quot; for temporary viewing, or unlimited recordings can be watched through a monthly or yearly subscription programme.

The NT had an annual turnover of approximately £105 million in 2015–16, of which earned income made up 75% (58% from ticket sales, 5% from NT Live and Digital, and 12% from commercial revenue such as in the restaurants, bars, bookshop, etc.). Support from Arts Council England provided 17% of income, 1% from Learning and Participation activity, and the remaining 9% came from a mixture of companies, individuals, trusts and foundations.

==Origins==
In 1847, a critic using the pseudonym &quot;Dramaticus&quot; published a pamphlet describing the parlous state of British theatre. Production of serious plays was restricted to the patent theatres, and new plays were subjected to censorship by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office. At the same time, there was a burgeoning theatre sector featuring a diet of low melodrama and musical burlesque; but critics described British theatre as driven by commercialism and a &quot;star&quot; system. There was a demand to commemorate serious theatre, with the &quot;Shakespeare Committee&quot; purchasing the playwright&#x27;s birthplace for the nation demonstrating a recognition of the importance of &quot;serious drama&quot;. The following year saw more pamphlets on a demand for a national theatre from London publisher Effingham William Wilson. The situation continued, with a renewed call every decade for a national theatre. Attention was aroused in 1879 when the Comédie-Française took a residency at the Gaiety Theatre, described in &quot;The Times&quot; as representing &quot;the highest aristocracy of the theatre&quot;. The principal demands now coalesced around: a structure in the capital that would form a permanent memorial to Shakespeare; an &quot;exemplary theatre&quot; company producing at the highest level of quality; and a centre from which appreciation of great drama could be spread as part of education throughout the country.

The Shakespeare Memorial Theatre was opened in Stratford upon Avon on 23 April 1879, with the New Shakespeare Company (now the Royal Shakespeare Company, RSC); then Herbert Beerbohm Tree founded an academy of dramatic art at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in 1904. This still left the capital without a national theatre. A London Shakespeare League was founded in 1902 to develop a Shakespeare National Theatre and – with the impending tercentenary in 1916 of his death – in 1913 purchased land for a theatre in Bloomsbury. This work was interrupted by World War I.

In 1910, George Bernard Shaw wrote a short comedy, &quot;The Dark Lady of the Sonnets&quot;, in which Shakespeare himself attempts to persuade Elizabeth I of the necessity of building a national theatre to stage his plays. The play was part of the long-term campaign to build a national theatre.


Finally, in 1948, the London County Council (LCC) presented a site close to the Royal Festival Hall for the purpose, so the (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6. c. 16), offering financial support, was passed by Parliament. Ten years after the foundation stone had been laid in 1951, the government declared that the nation could not afford a national theatre; in response, the LCC offered to waive any rent and pay half the construction costs. The government still tried to apply unacceptable conditions to save money, attempting to force the amalgamation of the existing publicly supported companies: the RSC, Sadler&#x27;s Wells and Old Vic.

Following some initial inspirational steps taken with the opening of the Chichester Festival Theatre in Chichester in June 1962, the developments in London proceeded. In July 1962, with agreements finally reached, a board was set up to supervise construction, and a separate board was constituted to run the proposed National Theatre Company which would lease the Old Vic theatre in the interim. The National Theatre Company opened on 22 October 1963 with &quot;Hamlet&quot;, starring Peter O&#x27;Toole in the title role. The company was founded by Laurence Olivier, who became the first artistic director of the company. As fellow directors, he enlisted William Gaskill and John Dexter. Among the first ensemble of actors of the company were Robert Stephens, Maggie Smith, Joan Plowright, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi, Lynn Redgrave, Michael Redgrave, Colin Blakely and Frank Finlay.

Meanwhile, construction of the permanent theatre proceeded with a design by architects Sir Denys Lasdun and Peter Softley and structural engineers Flint &amp; Neill containing three stages, which opened individually between 1976 and 1977. The construction work was carried out by the Sir Robert McAlpine company.

The company remained at the Old Vic until 1976, when construction of the Olivier was complete.

==Theatre building and architecture==
=== Theatres ===
The National Theatre building houses three separate theatres. Additionally, a temporary structure was added in April 2013 and closed in May 2016.

====Olivier Theatre====
Named after the theatre&#x27;s first artistic director, Laurence Olivier, this is the main auditorium. Modelled on the Ancient Theatre of Epidaurus, it has an open stage and a fan-shaped audience seating area for 1160 people. A &quot;drum revolve&quot; (a five-storey revolving stage section) extends eight metres beneath the stage and is operated by a single staff member. The drum has two rim revolves and two platforms, each of which can carry ten tonnes, facilitating dramatic and fluid scenery changes. Its design ensures that the audience&#x27;s view is not blocked from any seat, and that the audience is fully visible to actors from the stage&#x27;s centre. Designed in the 1970s by Richard Brett and Richard Pilbrow and a prototype of current technology, the drum revolve and a multiple &quot;sky hook&quot; flying system were initially very controversial and required ten years to commission, but seem to have fulfilled the objective of functionality with high productivity.

====Lyttelton Theatre====
Named after Oliver Lyttelton, the National Theatre&#x27;s first board chairman, it can accommodate an audience of 890 and has a proscenium arch design with flat side walls and seating arranged in long straight rows on two raked tiers. The proscenium arch is adjustable in width and there is an orchestra pit lift. The Lyttelton has been criticised for its lack of warmth, partly arising from the fact that the upper level audience is invisible to those on the lower level (and, of course, vice versa).

====Dorfman Theatre====
Named after Lloyd Dorfman (philanthropist and chairman of Travelex Group), the Dorfman is &quot;the smallest, the barest and the most potentially flexible of the National Theatre houses . . . a dark-walled room&quot; with an audience capacity of 400. It was formerly known as the Cottesloe Theatre (named after Lord Cottesloe, Chairman of the South Bank Theatre Board). The Cottesloe was the smallest of the National’s three theatres and, but for pressure exerted by Peter Brook and Peter Hall, might easily have been omitted. It sits below the stage of the Olivier in a space initially planned for a third third theatre which had been cancelled earlier in the design process. It was designed by Iain Mackintosh and Theatre Projects Consultants. It was the most influential of the modern ‘courtyard’ theatres, with its extremely simple, rectangular form and the audience on three shallow tiers, it could be readily adapted to proscenium, end stage, thrust, in-the-round, traverse or promenade form. The Cottesloe closed its doors on 23 February 2013 to undergo major refurbishment and reopened as the Dorfman Theatre on 30 September 2014 as part of the National&#x27;s NT Future redevelopment.

The enhanced theatre reopened in September 2014 under its new name.

====Temporary Theatre====
The Temporary Theatre, formerly called The Shed, was a 225-seat black box theatre which opened in April 2013 and featured new works; it closed in May 2016, following the refurbishment of the Dorfman Theatre.

In 2015 British artist Carl Randall painted a portrait of actress Katie Leung standing in front of The Shed as part of the artist&#x27;s &quot;London Portraits&quot; series, where he asked various cultural figures to choose a place in London for the backdrop of their portraits. Leung explained she chose The Shed as her backdrop because she performed there in the 2013 play &quot;The World of Extreme Happiness&quot;, and also because &quot;... it&#x27;s a temporary theatre, it&#x27;s not permanent, and I wanted to make it permanent in the portrait&quot;.

=== Architecture ===

The style of the National Theatre building was described by architecture historian Mark Girouard as &quot;an aesthetic of broken forms&quot; at the time of opening. Architectural opinion was split at the time of construction. Even enthusiastic advocates of the Modern Movement such as Nikolaus Pevsner found the &quot;Béton brut&quot; RAAC concrete both inside and out overbearing. Most notoriously, the future Charles III described the building in 1988 as &quot;a clever way of building a nuclear power station in the middle of London without anyone objecting&quot;. John Betjeman, a man not noted for his enthusiasm for brutalist architecture, wrote to Lasdun stating ironically that he &quot;gasped with delight at the cube of your theatre in the pale blue sky and a glimpse of St Paul&#x27;s to the south of it. It is a lovely work and so good from so many angles...it has that inevitable and finished look that great work does.&quot;

Despite the controversy, the theatre has been a Grade II* listed building since 1994. Although the theatre is often cited as an archetype of Brutalist architecture in England, since Lasdun&#x27;s death the building has been re-evaluated as having closer links to the work of Le Corbusier, rather than contemporary monumental 1960s buildings such as those of Paul Rudolph. The carefully refined balance between horizontal and vertical elements in Lasdun&#x27;s building has been contrasted favourably with the lumpiness of neighbouring buildings such as the Hayward Gallery and Queen Elizabeth Hall. It is now in the unusual situation of having appeared simultaneously in the top ten &quot;most popular&quot; and &quot;most hated&quot; London buildings in opinion surveys. A recent lighting scheme illuminating the exterior of the building, in particular the fly towers, has proved very popular, and is one of several positive artistic responses to the building. A key intended viewing axis is from Waterloo Bridge at 45 degrees head on to the fly tower of the Olivier Theatre (the largest and highest element of the building) and the steps from ground level. This view is largely obscured now by mature trees along the riverside walk but it can be seen in a more limited way at ground level.

=== Foyers and interior spaces ===
The National Theatre&#x27;s foyers are open to the public, with a large theatrical bookshop, restaurants, bars and exhibition spaces. The terraces and foyers of the theatre complex have also been used for ad hoc, short seasonal and experimental performances and screenings. The riverside forecourt of the theatre is used for regular season of open-air performances in the summer months.

The Clore Learning Centre is a new dedicated space for learning at the National Theatre. It offers events and courses for all ages, exploring theatre-making from playwriting to technical skills, often led by the NT&#x27;s own artists and staff. One of its spaces is The Cottesloe Room, so called in recognition of the original name of the adjacent theatre.

The dressing rooms for all actors are arranged around an internal light-well and air-shaft and so their windows each face each other. This arrangement has led to a tradition whereby, on the opening night (known as &quot;Press Night&quot;) and closing night of any individual play, when called to go to &quot;beginners&quot; (opening positions), the actors will go to the window and drum on the glass with the palms of their hands.

Backstage tours run throughout the day and the Sherling High Level Walkway, open daily until 7.30 pm, offers visitors views into the backstage production workshops for set construction and assembly, scenic painting and prop-making.

==NT Future==
2013 saw the commencement of the &quot;NT Future&quot; project; a redevelopment of the National Theatre complex which it was estimated would cost about £80 million.

==Studio==

The studio building across the road from the Old Vic on The Cut in Waterloo. The studio used to house the NT&#x27;s workshops but became the theatre&#x27;s research and development wing in 1984. The studio building houses the New Work Department, the Archive, and the NT&#x27;s Immersive Storytelling Studio.

The studio is a Grade II listed building designed by architects Lyons Israel Ellis. Completed in 1958, the building was refurbished by architects Haworth Tompkins and reopened in 2007.

The National Theatre Studio was founded in 1985 under the directorship of Peter Gill, who ran it until 1990. Laura Collier became Head of the Studio in November 2011, replacing Purni Morrell who headed the Studio from 2006. Following the merge of the Studio and the Literary Department under the leadership of Rufus Norris, Emily McLaughlin became the Head of New Work in 2015.

==National Theatre Live==

National Theatre Live is an initiative which broadcasts performances of their productions (and from other theatres) to cinemas and arts centres around the world. It began in June 2009 with Helen Mirren in Jean Racine&#x27;s &quot;Phedre&quot;, directed by Nicholas Hytner, in the Lyttelton Theatre.

In 2012 Nicholas Wright&#x27;s play &quot;Travelling Light&quot; was broadcast on 9 February, followed by &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; with Lenny Henry on 1 March and &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot; with Katherine Kelly, Steve Pemberton and Sophie Thompson on 29 March.

&quot;One Man, Two Guvnors&quot; returned to cinema screens in the United States, Canada and Australia for a limited season in Spring 2012. Danny Boyle&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; also returned to cinema screens worldwide for a limited season in June and July 2012.

The fourth season of broadcasts commenced on Thursday 6 September 2012 with &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot;, a play based on the international best-selling novel by Mark Haddon. This was followed by &quot;The Last of the Haussmans&quot;, a new play by Stephen Beresford starring Julie Walters, Rory Kinnear and Helen McCrory on 11 October 2012. William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; followed on 1 November 2012 starring Simon Russell Beale as Timon. On 17 January 2013, NT Live broadcast Arthur Wing Pinero&#x27;s &quot;The Magistrate&quot;, with John Lithgow.

The performances to be filmed and broadcast are nominated in advance, allowing planned movement of cameras with greater freedom in the auditorium.

==Learning and participation==

=== National Theatre Connections ===

National Theatre Connections is the annual nationwide youth theatre festival run by the National Theatre. The festival was founded in 1995, and features ten new plays for young people written by leading playwrights. Productions are staged by schools and youth groups at their schools and community centres, and at local professional theatre hubs. One of the productions of each play is invited to perform in a final festival at the National Theatre, usually in the Olivier Theatre and Dorfman Theatre.

=== National Theatre Collection ===
The &quot;National Theatre Collection&quot; (formerly called &quot;On Demand. In Schools&quot;) is the National Theatre&#x27;s free production streaming service for educational establishments worldwide, which is free to UK state schools.

In March 2020, in light of the coronavirus pandemic, the National Theatre Collection was made available for pupils and teachers to access at home to aid blended learning programmes. In April 2020, six new titles were added to the service to bring the total up to 30 productions. These include &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (directed by Benedict Andrews for the Young Vic, starring Sienna Miller and Jack O&#x27;Connell) and &quot;Small Island&quot; (directed by Rufus Norris for the National Theatre).

=== Public Acts ===

The first Public Acts production was &quot;Pericles&quot; in August 2018, at the National Theatre, in the Olivier Theatre. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described this as &#x27;a richly sung version with brilliant performances from a cast of hundreds.&#x27; The second production was &quot;As You Like It&quot; performed in August 2019 at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, Hornchurch.

Since 2019, Public Acts has been working on a third production in Doncaster in partnership with Cast and six local community partners. The new adaptation of &quot;The Caucasian Chalk Circle&quot; was originally planned for 2020 but has been postponed, due to COVID-19.

In December 2020, in partnership with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Public Acts released an online musical called &quot;We Begin Again&quot; by James Graham (&quot;Quiz&quot;) as a music video and a standalone track released by Broadway Records.

==Artistic directors==

*Sir Laurence Olivier (1963–1973)
*Sir Peter Hall (1973–1988)
*Sir Richard Eyre (1988–1997)
*Sir Trevor Nunn (1997–2003)
*Sir Nicholas Hytner (2003–2015)
*Rufus Norris (2015–2025)
Laurence Olivier became artistic director of the National Theatre at its formation in 1963. He was considered the foremost British film and stage actor of the period, and became the first director of the Chichester Festival Theatre – there forming the company that would unite with the Old Vic Company to form the National Theatre Company. In addition to directing, he continued to appear in many successful productions, not least as Shylock in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. In 1969 the National Theatre Company received a Special Tony Award which was accepted by Olivier at the 23rd Tony Awards. He became a life peer in 1970, for his services to theatre, and stepped down in 1973.

Peter Hall took over to manage the move to the South Bank. His career included running the Arts Theatre between 1956 and 1959 – where he directed the English language première of Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;. He went on to take over the Memorial Theatre at Stratford, and to create the permanent Royal Shakespeare Company, in 1960, also establishing a new RSC base at the Aldwych Theatre for transfers to the West End. He was artistic director at the National Theatre between 1973 and 1988. During this time he directed major productions for the Theatre, and also some opera at Glyndebourne and the Royal Opera House. After leaving, he ran his own company at The Old Vic and summer seasons at the Theatre Royal, Bath also returning to guest direct &quot;Tantalus&quot; for the RSC in 2000 and &quot;Bacchai&quot; in the National Theatre&#x27;s Olivier and &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; in the Dorfman some years later. In 2008, he opened a new theatre, The Rose, and remained its &quot;Director Emeritus&quot; until his death in 2017.

One of the National&#x27;s associate directors under Peter Hall, Richard Eyre, became artistic director in 1988; his experience included running the Royal Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh and the Nottingham Playhouse. He was noted for his series of collaborations with David Hare on the state of contemporary Britain.

In 1997, Trevor Nunn became artistic director. He came to the National from the RSC, having undertaken a major expansion of the company into the Swan, The Other Place and the Barbican Theatres. He brought a more populist style to the National, directing My Fair Lady, Oklahoma! and South Pacific.

In April 2003, Nicholas Hytner took over as artistic director. He previously worked as an associate director with the Royal Exchange Theatre and the National. A number of his successful productions have been made into films. In April 2013 Hytner announced he would step down as artistic director at the end of March 2015.

Amongst Hytner&#x27;s innovations were NT Future, the National Theatre Live initiative of simulcasting live productions, and the Entry Pass scheme, allowing young people under the age of 26 to purchase tickets for £7.50 to any production at the theatre.

Rufus Norris took over as artistic director in March 2015. He is the first person since Laurence Olivier to hold the post without being a University of Cambridge graduate. In June 2023 it was announced that Norris would be stepping down in 2025.

It was announced in December 2023 that Indhu Rubasingham would take over as artistic director in 2025.

<doc id="167777" wikidata="Q1064031" url="?curid=167777" title="Topic map">
<text>A topic map is a standard for the representation and interchange of knowledge, with an emphasis on the findability of information. Topic maps were originally developed in the late 1990s as a way to represent back-of-the-book index structures so that multiple indexes from different sources could be merged. However, the developers quickly realized that with a little additional generalization, they could create a meta-model with potentially far wider application. The ISO/IEC standard is formally known as ISO/IEC 13250:2003.

A topic map represents information using
* &quot;topics&quot;, representing any concept, from people, countries, and organizations to software modules, individual files, and events,
* &quot;associations&quot;, representing hypergraph relationships between &quot;topics&quot;, and
* &quot;occurrences&quot;, representing information resources relevant to a particular &quot;topic&quot;.

Topic maps are similar to concept maps and mind maps in many respects, though only topic maps are ISO standards. Topic maps are a form of semantic web technology similar to RDF.

==Ontology and merging==
Topics, associations, and occurrences can all be typed, where the types must be defined by the one or more creators of the topic map(s). The definitions of allowed types is known as the ontology of the topic map.

Topic maps explicitly support the concept of merging of identity between multiple topics or topic maps. Furthermore, because ontologies are topic maps themselves, they can also be merged thus allowing for the automated integration of information from diverse sources into a coherent new topic map. Features such as subject identifiers (URIs given to topics) and PSIs (&quot;published subject indicators&quot;) are used to control merging between differing taxonomies. Scoping on names provides a way to organise the various names given to a particular topic by different sources.

==Current standard==
The work standardizing topic maps (ISO/IEC 13250) took place under the umbrella of the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 34/WG 3 committee (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34, Working Group 3 – Document description and processing languages – Information Association). However, WG3 was disbanded and maintenance of ISO/IEC 13250 was assigned to WG8.

The topic maps (ISO/IEC 13250) reference model and data model standards are defined independent of any specific serialization or syntax.
* TMRM Topic Maps – Reference Model
* TMDM Topic Maps – Data Model

==Data format==
The specification is summarized in the abstract as follows: &quot;This specification provides a model and grammar for representing the structure of information resources used to define topics, and the associations (relationships) between topics. Names, resources, and relationships are said to be characteristics of abstract subjects, which are called topics. Topics have their characteristics within scopes: i.e. the limited contexts within which the names and resources are regarded as their name, resource, and relationship characteristics. One or more interrelated documents employing this grammar is called a topic map.&quot;

===XML serialization formats===
* In 2000, Topic Maps was defined in an XML syntax XTM. This is now commonly known as &quot;XTM 1.0&quot; and is still in fairly common use.
* The ISO standards committee published an updated XML syntax in 2006, XTM 2.0 which is increasingly in use today.
&quot;Note that XTM 1.0 predates and therefore is not compatible with the more recent versions of the (ISO/IEC 13250) standard.&quot;

===Other formats===
Other proposed or standardized serialization formats include:
* CXTM – Canonical XML Topic Maps format (canonicalization of topic maps)
* CTM – a Compact Topic Maps Notation (not based on XML)
* GTM – a Graphical Topic Maps Notation

The above standards are all recently proposed or defined as part of ISO/IEC 13250. As described below, there are also other, serialization formats such as LTM, AsTMa= that have not been put forward as standards.

Linear topic map notation (LTM) serves as a kind of shorthand for writing topic maps in plain text editors. This is useful for writing short personal topic maps or exchanging partial topic maps by email. The format can be converted to XTM.

There is another format called AsTMa which serves a similar purpose. When writing topic maps manually it is much more compact, but of course can be converted to XTM. Alternatively, it can be used directly with the Perl Module TM (which also supports LTM).

The data formats of XTM and LTM are similar to the W3C standards for RDF/XML or the older N3 notation.

==Related standards==
===Topic Maps API===
A de facto API standard called Common Topic Maps Application Programming Interface (TMAPI) was published in April 2004 and is supported by many Topic Maps implementations or vendors:
* TMAPI – Common Topic Maps Application Programming Interface
* TMAPI 2.0 – Topic Maps Application Programming Interface (v2.0)

===Query standard===
In normal use it is often desirable to have a way to arbitrarily query the data within a particular Topic Maps store. Many implementations provide a syntax by which this can be achieved (somewhat like &#x27;SQL for Topic Maps&#x27;) but the syntax tends to vary a lot between different implementations. With this in mind, work has gone into defining a standardized syntax for querying topic maps:
* ISO 18048: TMQL – Topic Maps Query Language

===Constraint standards===
It can also be desirable to define a set of constraints that can be used to guarantee or check the semantic validity of topic maps data for a particular domain. (Somewhat like database constraints for topic maps). Constraints can be used to define things like &#x27;every document needs an author&#x27; or &#x27;all managers must be human&#x27;. There are often implementation specific ways of achieving these goals, but work has gone into defining a standardized constraint language as follows:
* ISO 19756: TMCL – Topic Maps Constraint Language

TMCL is functionally similar to RDF Schema with Web Ontology Language (OWL).

===Earlier standards===
The &quot;Topic Maps&quot; concept has existed for a long time. The HyTime standard was proposed as far back as 1992 (or earlier?). Earlier versions of ISO 13250 (than the current revision) also exist. More information about such standards can be found at the ISO Topic Maps site.

==RDF relationship==
Some work has been undertaken to provide interoperability between the W3C&#x27;s RDF/OWL/SPARQL family of semantic web standards and the ISO&#x27;s family of &quot;Topic Maps&quot; standards though the two have slightly different goals.

The semantic expressive power of Topic Maps is, in many ways, equivalent to that of RDF, but the major differences are that Topic Maps (i) provide a higher level of semantic abstraction (providing a template of topics, associations and occurrences, while RDF only provides a template of two arguments linked by one relationship) and (hence) (ii) allow &quot;n&quot;-ary relationships (hypergraphs) between any number of nodes, while RDF is limited to triplets.

<doc id="167779" wikidata="Q1752963" url="?curid=167779" title="Saint Anthony Falls">
<text>Saint Anthony Falls, or the Falls of Saint Anthony (), located at the northeastern edge of downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota, was the only natural major waterfall on the Mississippi River. Throughout the mid-to-late 1800s, various dams were built atop the east and west faces of the falls to support the milling industry that spurred the growth of the city of Minneapolis. In 1880, the central face of the falls was reinforced with a sloping timber apron to stop the upstream erosion of the falls. In the 1950s, the apron was rebuilt with concrete, which makes up the most visible portion of the falls today. A series of locks were constructed in the 1950s and 1960s to extend navigation to points upstream.

The falls were renamed from their Dakota title in 1680 by Father Louis Hennepin after his patron saint, St. Anthony of Padua. The towns of St. Anthony and Minneapolis, which had developed on the east and west sides of the falls, respectively, merged in 1872 to fully use the power of the falls for milling operations. From 1880 to about 1930, Minneapolis was known as the &quot;Flour Milling Capital of the World&quot;.

Today, the falls are defined by the spillway, the upper dam and the locks, located just downstream of the 3rd Avenue Bridge, and the Lower Lock and Dam, just upstream of the I-35W Saint Anthony Falls Bridge. These locks were built as part of the Upper Mississippi River 9-Foot Navigation Project. The area around the falls is designated the St. Anthony Falls Historic District and features a self-guided walking trail with signs explaining the area&#x27;s past.

==History==


The falls hold cultural and spiritual significance for native tribes who frequented and lived in the area. The falls is an important and sacred site to the Mdewakanton Dakota and they called the Mississippi River, &quot;hahawakpa&quot;, &quot;river of the falls&quot;. The falls (&quot;Haha&quot;) themselves were given specific names, &quot;mnirara&quot; &quot;curling waters&quot;, &quot;owahmenah&quot; &quot;falling waters&quot;, or &quot;owamni,&quot; &quot;whirlpool&quot; (&quot;mniyomni&quot; in the Eastern Dakota dialect and &quot;owamniyomni&quot; in the Teton Dakota (Lakota) dialect). Dakota associate the falls with legends and spirits, including Oanktehi, god of waters and evil, who lived beneath the falling water. A small island in the stream, called Spirit Island, was once a nesting ground for eagles that fed on fish below the falls. Dakota people camped on Nicollet Island upstream of the falls to fish and to tap the sugar maple trees.

Since the cataract had to be portaged, the area became one of the natural resting and trade points along the Mississippi between Dakota and Anishinaabe peoples. The Anishinaabe (Ojibwe) term was recorded as &quot;kakabikah&quot; (&quot;gakaabikaa&quot;, &quot;split rock&quot; or more descriptively, &quot;gichi-gakaabikaa,&quot; &quot;the great severed rock&quot; which referenced the jagged chunks of limestone constantly eroding by the falls).

In 1680, the falls became known to the Western world when they were observed and published in a journal by Father Louis Hennepin, a Catholic friar of Belgian birth, who had earlier brought the Niagara Falls to the world&#x27;s attention via a publication. Hennepin named them the &quot;Chutes de Saint-Antoine&quot; or the Falls of Saint Anthony after his patron saint, Anthony of Padua. Later explorers to document the falls include Zebulon Montgomery Pike and Jonathan Carver, the first Englishman to undertake an exploration of the west. According to the John Carter Brown Library, &quot;Carver&#x27;s purpose was to map the land, to befriend the , and to discover the Northwest passage. His journey began in 1766 and, in some ways, was the precursor of the Lewis and Clark expedition; his book was the first popular American travel book.&quot; Carver created this early image, an engraving of the falls, in 1778.

In 1817, Major Stephen Harriman Long headed a military excursion up the Mississippi River to the Falls of St. Anthony near the confluence with the Minnesota River. As a result of his recommendations, the Army established Fort Snelling to guard against Indian incursions against settlers in the Upper Mississippi Valley. Long recorded his experiences of the expedition in a journal, which was first published as &quot;Voyage in a Six-Oared Skiff to the Falls of St. Anthony&quot;, by the Minnesota Historical Society in 1860. In his journal, Long described the &quot;majestic cataract&quot; of the falls and said that &quot;the murmuring of the cascade, the roaring of the river, and the thunder of the cataract, all contributed to render the scene the most interesting and magnificent of any I ever before witnessed.&quot;

Following the establishment of Fort Snelling in 1820, the falls became an attraction for tourists, writers, and artists who sought inspiration, even if Hennepin&#x27;s descriptions were not as majestic as hoped for. By the 1850s a romantic &quot;Indian legend&quot; had become associated with the falls (first noted in Long&#x27;s 1817 journal), describing a wife whose husband had taken a second bride. The offended first wife placed her child (or children) in a canoe and paddled toward the falls, plunging herself and her offspring to certain death as the husband looked on helplessly.

By the 1860s, industrial waste had filled the area and marred the falls&#x27; majesty. Further competition over the power of the falls on both banks of the river led to the Eastman tunnel disaster in 1869 which could have destroyed the falls. The disaster was fixed with a dike under the falls.

===Industry===

The first private land claim at the falls was made by Franklin Steele in 1838 — though he did not obtain financing for development until 1847, in the form of $12,000 for a nine-tenths stake in the property. On May 18, 1848, President James K. Polk approved the claims made in St. Anthony, and Steele was able to build his dam on the east side of the river above the Falls, blocking the east channel.

The dam extended diagonally into the river , was high, and was secured to the limestone riverbed. Its thickness tapered from 40 wide at its base to wide at the top. Steele dispatched logging crews to the Crow Wing River in December 1847 to supply pine for the sawmill, and by September 1, 1848, sawing commenced using two up-down saws. He was able to sell the lumber readily, supplying construction projects in the booming town. The new community at the Falls attracted entrepreneurs from New England, many of whom had experience in lumber and milling. He had hired Ard Godfrey to help build and run the first commercial sawmill at the Falls. Godfrey knew the most efficient ways to use natural resources, like the falls, and the great pine forests, to make lumber products. 
The house built in 1848 in St. Anthony for Godfrey is the oldest remaining wood-frame house in the Twin Cities.
Steele had the town platted in 1849, and it incorporated in 1855.
By 1854, 300 squatters occupied the west bank of the river, and in 1855, Congress recognized the squatters&#x27; right to purchase the land they had claimed. The west side quickly developed scores of new mills and consortia. They built a dam diagonally into the river to the north, which, along with Steele&#x27;s dam created the inverted V-shape, still apparent today. Steele created the St. Anthony Falls Water Power Company in 1856 with three New York financiers, Davis, Gebhard, and Sanford. The company struggled for several years, due to poor relations with the financiers, a depression, and the Civil War. In 1868, the firm reorganized with new officers including John Pillsbury, Richard and Samuel Chute, Sumner Farnham, and Frederick Butterfield.

As Minneapolis (and its former neighbor across the river, St. Anthony) developed, the water power at the falls became a source of power for several industries including textile mills, wool, machinery, paper, and wood products, of which the North Star Woolen Mill was successful. Sawmills made the falls a major lumber producing area, with the mills largely built on platforms above the limestone cap forming the falls. Subsequently, the dominant industry became flour milling.

The falls industrialization caused problems. Logs, sometimes a hundred at a time, escaped from log booms and hammered the falls. Diversion of water left parts of the limestone cap dry, increasing weathering effects. Shafts and tunnels from sawmills and other users weakened the limestone and its sandstone foundation, accelerating the falls&#x27; upriver erosion to per year between 1857 and 1868. The falls quickly approached the edge of the limestone cap; once the limestone had completely eroded away, the falls would degenerate into sandstone rapids unsuitable for waterpower. To protect the falls and stop upstream progression a protective wood timber apron was built from the edge of the falls sloping downstream. The apron dissipated the energy of the falling water and moved it away from the base of the falls. It also protected from errant logs. An apron built in 1866 lasted until 1867. The Corps of Engineers completed one in 1880 that lasted until destroyed in 1952. It was replaced with a concrete apron.

The usual flour milling techniques did not work well for &quot;spring wheat&quot;, which is the only kind that could be dependably grown on the rapidly expanding wheat farms in Minnesota and the Dakotas. In the late 1860s, major milling innovations at the falls were a &quot;middlings purifier&quot; and &quot;gradual-reduction&quot; grinding, both borrowed from Europe. Metal rollers replaced grindstones. The changes not only solved the spring wheat problem but produced high quality flour in a milling process that was highly profitable. As the result of the new technology, flour mills began to dominate the falls after 1870.
Millers on the Minneapolis side formed a consortium to extract power with the &quot;Lowell model&quot; in which water was supplied in a large headrace &quot;power canal&quot; connecting to the millpond above the falls and extending parallel to the river below the falls. Mills built on both sides of the power canal diverted upper-level water into waterwheel-equipped vertical shafts (driven through the limestone bedrock into the soft, underlying sandstone) and then through horizontal tailrace tunnels to the falls&#x27; lower level. This system was very effective and mills lined the canal. &quot;turning the west side of the river into the country&#x27;s most densely industrialized, direct-drive waterpower district.&quot; The mills on the St. Anthony (east) side of the river were less-well organized for harnessing the power, and therefore industry developed at a slower pace on that side. But the Pillsbury A-Mill, built on the east bank and completed in 1881, was the world&#x27;s largest flour mill for 18 years. It produced about 1/3 as much flour as the entire west side. The mills at the falls were very large and substantially automated. &quot;By the end of the century, they had created the country&#x27;s greatest waterpower industrial district, which was also the country&#x27;s leading flour milling center from 1880 to 1930.&quot;

By the early 1900s, three companies controlled 97% of the falls flour production. They were the Pillsbury-Washburn Flour Mills Company (later Pillsbury Flour Mills Company and now General Mills), the Washburn-Crosby Company (later General Mills), and Northwestern Consolidated Milling Company (later Standard Milling Company).&quot; The Pillsbury and Washburn-Crosby companies were started at the falls.

===1869 collapse of the Eastman tunnel===
The early dams built to harness the waterpower exposed the limestone to freezing and thawing forces, narrowed the channel, and increased damage from floods. A report in 1868 found that only of the limestone remained upstream, and if it were eroded away, the falls would turn into a rapids that would no longer be useful for waterpower. Meanwhile, as the result of a lawsuit, the St. Anthony Falls Water Power Company approved a plan for the firm of William W. Eastman and John L. Merriam to build a tailrace tunnel from below the falls, under Hennepin Island, under the riverbed to Nicollet Island. Nicollet Island is or more above the falls. The tailrace tunnel would allow waterpower development at the Island. This plan met with disaster on October 5, 1869, when the limestone cap was breached.

The leak turned into a torrent of water coming out the tunnel. The water blasted Hennepin Island, causing a section to collapse into the tunnel. Believing that the mills and all the other industries around the falls would be ruined, hundreds of people rushed to view the impending disaster. Groups of volunteers started shoring up the gap by throwing trees and timber into the river, but that was ineffective. They then built a huge raft of timbers from the milling operations on Nicollet Island. This worked briefly, but also proved ineffective. A number of workers worked for months to build a dam that would funnel water away from the tunnel. The next year, an engineer from Lowell, Massachusetts, recommended completing a wooden apron, sealing the tunnel, and building low dams above the falls to avoid exposing the limestone to the weather.

The fix for the tunnel disaster was a concrete dike constructed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The dike was just above the falls and Hennepin Island, from right under the limestone cap down as much as , and long across the entire river channel. The dike, completed 1876, cut off the tunnel and any possible future bypass channels. A separate problem was damage to the falls and its upstream progression. To stop the damage the Corps built a protective wood timber apron completed 1880. The Corps also built two low dams, completed by 1880, on top of the limestone cap to keep the cap wet. The federal government spent $615,000 on this effort, while the two cities spent $334,500.
===Hydroelectric power production===

Hydroelectric power production also developed early at the falls. In 1881, the Pillsbury &quot;A&quot; Mill added a Brush Electric arc light plant powered from their turbines; some other mills did so also. In 1882, a Brush hydroelectric central station plant was in use, the third central station in the country. (Edison&#x27;s Pearl Street Station also started producing electric power in 1882 - using steam.) The waterpower companies encouraged or developed hydroelectric plants. Major plants were completed in 1894. 1895, and 1908. (The first large scale production of electricity in the world was at the Adams (Tesla) plant at Niagara Falls starting 1895). As waterpower became available it was used to generate electricity. After the third plant was in operation in 1908, 45% of the waterpower being used was for hydroelectric. One of the historic St. Anthony Falls plants is still operating.

River flow is variable and flour production may have to be decreased with low flow rates. In the winter, mills may shut down because there is not enough water flow. So many mills supplemented water power with steam, starting with a 1,400 HP steam engine at the Pillsbury A mill in 1884. By 1892 ten of the fifteen mills had supplementary steam power. As electricity developed as a power source, some electricity was generated from steam to run equipment. Using electricity from the St. Anthony Falls hydroelectric plants was not very practical because those plants competed for the same water flow. But about 1910 electric power was available from St. Croix Falls and it was used in combination with waterpower and steam, and electricity eventually took over.
The Mississippi river flow rate changes based on how much rain there is its watershed. Starting 1880, dams were created on the Mississippi further north to create reservoirs - water could be released to increase flow at times when it would be low. This helped both waterpower industries and river navigation. The dams were at Lake Winnibigoshish, Leech Lake, Pokegama Falls, Pine River, Sandy Lake, and Gull Lake.

==Locks and dams==

St. Paul was effectively the upper limit of commercial navigation on the Mississippi. High bluffs on both sides of the river from the River Waren falls and the falls progressing up the Mississippi, made access difficult. In addition the rapid descent of the river from the falls to below what is now the Ford Dam (lock and dam No. 1) made the river shallow and fast running. The Ford dam, completed 1917, extended navigation to a little above the Washington Ave. bridge, with a shipping terminal on the west bank. Locks completed in 1956 at the lower dam and around the falls in 1963 extended navigation out of the river gorge to north Minneapolis. Since those two locks are smaller than most of the locks on the rest of the river, the practical limit for many commercial tows was still further downriver. In 2015, the Upper St. Anthony Falls lock was permanently closed to stop the spread of invasive species, namely Asian carp.

The St. Anthony Falls and the Upper Dam. The upper dam (&quot;horseshoe dam&quot;), built on top of the limestone cap forming the falls, is successor to dams built in the 1850s. The dam increases the head for two hydroelectric plants and increases the water level above the falls. The water level rise from the falls is and from the dam is . The lift at this lock, , is the highest of any lock on the Mississippi. The upper pool has a normal capacity of and a normal level of 799 feet (244 m) above sea level. The navigation channel required alteration of the historic Stone Arch Bridge, which now has a metal truss section to allow ships to pass below.
The Lower St. Anthony Falls Dam, located about a half mile below the falls, was completed 1897 with a water level rise of . The dam was built for hydroelectric production, and included a power plant. There never was a falls at this location. The dam was rebuilt and locks added in 1956. The rise was increased to . The new dam is a gravity-type hydro-electric dam in height, consisting of a long concrete spillway with four tainter gates. The upper pool (sometimes called the intermediate pool) has a normal capacity of and a normal level of 750 feet (229 m) above sea level.

The upper and lower locks are each wide by long.

The current around the spillway/falls is often swift and dangerous. In 1991, a small boat drifted too close and fell over one part of the dam. One person on board was killed, and one had to be rescued by helicopter. Rescues at the site are usually much less dramatic, but continue to happen occasionally.

==Geology==

Geologists say that the falls first appeared roughly 12,000 years ago about downstream at the confluence of the glacial River Warren (at present-day Fort Snelling). Estimates are that the falls were about high when the River Warren Falls receded past the confluence of the Mississippi River and the glacial River Warren. Over the succeeding 10,000 years, the falls moved upstream to its present location. The water churning at the bottom of the falls ate away at the soft sandstone, eventually breaking off the hard limestone cap in chunks as the falls receded. From its origins near Fort Snelling, St. Anthony Falls relocated upstream at a rate of about per year until it reached its present location in the early 19th century. In the 6 miles (9.7 km) from the top of the falls (not including the horseshoe dam) to below the Ford dam the river drops 97 feet (30 m), all of it the remnant of the original 180 feet (55 m) falls. The limestone cap gets thinner upriver from the falls, and the cap disappears about upstream. In a short time, geologically speaking, the falls will reach the end of the cap and become a rapids.
 Tributaries such as Minnehaha Creek begot their own waterfalls as the Mississippi River valley was cut into the landscape.

When Father Louis Hennepin documented the falls he estimated the falls&#x27; height to be . Later explorers described it as being in the range of high. The height of the falls, not including the upper dam, is now . The river descends downstream from the falls, which might add another to the falls where they were when Hennepin saw them.

The geological formation of the area consisted of a hard thin layer of Platteville Formation, a limestone, overlaying the soft St. Peter Sandstone subsurface. These layers were the result of an Ordovician Period sea which covered east-central Minnesota 500 million years ago.

==Historic and commemorative markers==

The area around the river was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the St. Anthony Falls Historic District in 1971. It includes 8th Avenue Northeast extending downstream to 6th Avenue Southeast and approximately two city blocks on both shoreline.

 The falls are a contributing resource to the Historic District. The district&#x27;s archaeological record is one of the most-endangered historic sites in Minnesota. The National Register of Historic Places is facilitated by the National Park Service. The national significance of the Saint Anthony Falls Historic District is a major reason why the National Park Service&#x27;s Mississippi National River and Recreation Area was established along the Mississippi River in the Minneapolis – Saint Paul metropolitan area.

A Heritage Trail plaque nearby says,

For untold generations of Indian people the Mississippi River was an important canoe route. To pass around the falls, the Dakota (Sioux) and Ojibway (Chippewa) used a well-established portage trail. Starting at a landing below the site now occupied by the steam plant, the trail climbed the bluff to this spot. From here it followed the east bank along what is now Main Street to a point well above the falls.

Water Works park overlooking the falls opened in 2021.

== In popular culture ==
Along with Yosemite Valley, Saint Anthony Falls held a particular attraction for painters of 19th-century landscapes. The falls were a popular tourist attraction at the time, and were depicted in many paintings, including works by Albert Bierstadt, Henry Lewis, and George Catlin.

Mark Twain visited the falls as part of his journeys recounted in the 1883 memoir &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot;; the original printing of the book included a drawing by John Harley of the falls. Twain noted that the waterfall&#x27;s industrial capacity was &quot;of inestimable value, business-wise, though somewhat to the damage of the Falls as a spectacle, or as a background against which to get your photograph taken&quot;.

<text>Raymond Henry Williams (31 August 1921 – 26 January 1988) was a Welsh socialist writer, academic, novelist and critic influential within the New Left and in wider culture. His writings on politics, culture, the media and literature contributed to the Marxist critique of culture and the arts. Some 750,000 copies of his books were sold in UK editions alone, and there are many translations available. His work laid foundations for the field of cultural studies and cultural materialism.

== Life ==
=== Early life ===
Born in Pandy, just north of Llanfihangel Crucorney, near Abergavenny, Wales, Williams was the son of a railway worker in a village where all of the railwaymen voted Labour, while the local small farmers mostly voted Liberal. It was not a Welsh-speaking area: he described it as &quot;Anglicised in the 1840s&quot;. There was, nevertheless, a strong Welsh identity. &quot;There is the joke that someone says his family came over with the Normans and we reply: &#x27;Are you liking it here?&#x27;&quot;

Williams attended King Henry VIII Grammar School in Abergavenny. His teenage years were overshadowed by the rise of Nazism and the threat of war. His father was secretary of the local Labour Party, but Raymond declined to join, although he did attend meetings around the 1935 general election. He was 14 when the Spanish Civil War broke out, and was conscious of what was happening through his membership of the local Left Book Club. He also mentions the Italian invasion of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and Edgar Snow&#x27;s &quot;Red Star Over China&quot;, originally published in Britain by the Left Book Club.

At this time, he supported the League of Nations, attending a League-organised youth conference in Geneva in 1937. On the way back, his group visited Paris and he went to the Soviet pavilion at the International Exhibition. There he bought a copy of &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; and read Karl Marx for the first time.

In July 1939, he was involved in the Monmouth by-election, helping with an unsuccessful campaign by the Labour candidate, Frank Hancock, who was a pacifist. Williams was also a pacifist at this time, having distributed leaflets for the Peace Pledge Union.

=== University education ===
Williams won a state scholarship to read English at Trinity College, Cambridge, matriculating in 1939. While at Cambridge, he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain. Along with Eric Hobsbawm, he was given the task of writing a Communist Party pamphlet about the Russo-Finnish War. He says in (&quot;Politics and Letters&quot;) that they &quot;were given the job as people who could write quickly, from historical materials supplied for us. You were often in there writing about topics you did not know very much about, as a professional with words&quot;.

At the time, the British government was keen to support Finland in its war against the Soviet Union, while still being at war with Nazi Germany. He took a second (division two) in part one of the tripos in 1941, and, after returning from war service, achieved first-class honours in part two in 1946. He graduated from the University of Cambridge with a BA degree in 1946: as per tradition, his BA was promoted to a Master of Arts (MA Cantab) degree. He was later awarded a higher doctorate by Cambridge: the Doctor of Letters (LittD) degree in 1969.

=== World War II ===
Williams interrupted his education to serve in the Second World War. He enlisted in the British Army in late 1940, but stayed at Cambridge to take his exams in June 1941, the month when Germany invaded Russia. Joining the military was against the Communist party line at the time. According to Williams, his Communist Party membership lapsed without him formally resigning.

When Williams joined the army, he was assigned to the Royal Corps of Signals, which was a typical assignment for university undergraduates. He received initial training in military communications, but was reassigned to artillery and anti-tank weapons. He was chosen to serve as an officer in the Anti-Tank Regiment of the Guards Armoured Division in 1941–1945, being sent into early fighting in the Invasion of Normandy after the D-Day Normandy Landings. He writes in &quot;Politics and Letters&quot;, &quot;I don&#x27;t think the intricate chaos of that Normandy fighting has ever been recorded.&quot; He commanded a unit of four tanks and mentions losing touch with two of them while fighting against Waffen-SS Panzer forces in the Bocage. He never discovered what happened to them as a withdrawal of troops ensued.

Williams took part in the fighting from Normandy in 1944 and through Belgium and the Netherlands to Germany in 1945. There he was involved in liberating a smaller Nazi concentration camp, which was afterwards used by the Allies to detain SS officers.

He was shocked to find that Hamburg had suffered saturation bombing by the Royal Air Force, not just military targets and docks, as they had been told. He was expecting to be sent to Burma, but as his studies had been interrupted by the war, was instead granted Class B release, which meant immediate demobilisation. He returned to Cambridge, where he found that the student culture had changed from 1941, with the left-wing involvement much diminished.

=== Adult education and early publications ===
Williams received his BA from Cambridge in 1946, and then served as a tutor in adult education at Oxford University&#x27;s Delegacy for Extra-Mural Studies (1946-1961). Moving to Seaford, Sussex, he gave Workers&#x27; Educational Association evening classes in East Sussex in English literature, drama, and later culture and environment. This allowed Williams to write in the mornings, beginning work on novels and what would become cultural studies.

In 1946, he founded the review &quot;Politics and Letters&quot;, a journal which he edited with Clifford Collins and Wolf Mankowitz until 1948. Williams published &quot;Reading and Criticism&quot; in 1950; he joined the editorial board of the new journal &quot;Essays in Criticism&quot;. In 1951, he was recalled to the army as a reservist to fight in the Korean War. He refused to go, registering as a conscientious objector. He expected to be jailed for a month, but the Appeal Tribunal panel, which included a professor of classics, was convinced by his case and discharged him from further military obligations in May 1951.

Between 1946 and 1957, he was involved with the film-maker Michael Orrom, whom he had known in Cambridge. They co-wrote &quot;Preface to Film&quot;, published in 1954, and Williams wrote the script for an experimental film, &quot;The Legend&quot;, in 1955. This was rejected in July 1956 and he parted company with Orrom shortly afterwards. He wrote a number of novels in this period, but only one, &quot;Border Country&quot;, would be published.

Inspired by T. S. Eliot&#x27;s 1948 publication &quot;Notes towards the Definition of Culture&quot;, Williams began exploring the concept of culture. He first outlined his argument that the concept emerged with the Industrial Revolution in the essay &quot;The Idea of Culture&quot;, which resulted in the widely successful book &quot;Culture and Society&quot;, published in 1958, in which he coined the term structure of feeling. This was followed in 1961 by &quot;The Long Revolution&quot;. Williams&#x27;s writings were taken up by the New Left and received a wide readership. He was also well known as a regular book reviewer for &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; newspaper. His years in adult education were an important experience and Williams was always something of an outsider at Cambridge University. Asked to contribute to a book called &quot;My Cambridge&quot;, he began his essay by saying: &quot;It was not my Cambridge. That was clear from the beginning.&quot;

=== Academic career ===

On the strength of his books, Williams was invited to return to Cambridge in 1961, where he was elected a fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge. He eventually achieved an appointment in the Faculty of English, University of Cambridge, first as Reader in Drama (1967–1974), and then as the university&#x27;s first Professor of Drama (1974–1983). He was a visiting professor of political science at Stanford University in 1973, an experience he used to effect in his still useful book &quot;Television: Technology and Cultural Form&quot; (1974).

A committed socialist, he was interested in the relations between language, literature and society, and published many books, essays and articles on these and other issues. Among the main ones is &quot;The Country and the City&quot; (1973), where chapters on literature alternate with chapters on social history. His tightly written &quot;Marxism and Literature&quot; (1977) is mainly for specialists, but also sets out his approach to cultural studies, which he called cultural materialism. The book was in part a response to structuralism in literary studies and pressure on Williams to make a more theoretical statement of his position, against criticisms that it was a humanist Marxism, based on unexamined assumptions about lived experience. He makes much use of the ideas of Antonio Gramsci, though the book is uniquely Williams&#x27;s and written in his characteristic voice. For a more accessible version, see &quot;Culture&quot; (1981-1982), which develops an argument about cultural sociology, which he hoped would become &quot;a new major discipline&quot;. Introducing the US edition, Bruce Robbins identifies it as &quot;implicit self-critique&quot; of Williams&#x27;s earlier ideas, and a basis on which &quot;to conceive the oppositionality of the critic in a permanently fragmented society&quot;.

=== Concepts and theory ===
==== Vocabulary ====
Williams was keen to establish the changing meanings of the vocabulary used in discussions of culture. He began with the word &quot;culture&quot; itself; his notes on 60 significant, often difficult words were to have appeared as an appendix to &quot;Culture and Society&quot; in 1958. This was not possible, and so an extended version with notes and short essays on 110 words appeared as &quot;&quot; in 1976. Those examined included &quot;aesthetic&quot;, &quot;bourgeois&quot;, &quot;culture&quot;, &quot;hegemony&quot;, &quot;isms&quot;, &quot;organic&quot;, &quot;romantic&quot;, &quot;status&quot;, &quot;violence&quot; and &quot;work&quot;. A revised version in 1983 added 21 new words, including &quot;anarchism&quot;, &quot;ecology&quot;, &quot;liberation&quot; and &quot;sex&quot;. Williams wrote that the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (OED) &quot;is primarily philological and etymological,&quot; whilst his work was on &quot;meanings and contexts&quot;. In 1981, Williams published &quot;Culture&quot;, where the term, discussed at length, is defined as &quot;a &quot;realized signifying system&quot;&quot; and supported by chapters on &quot;the means of cultural production, and the process of cultural reproduction&quot;.

=== Debate ===
Williams wrote critically of Marshall McLuhan&#x27;s writings on technology and society. This is the background to a chapter in &quot;Television: Technology and Cultural Form&quot; (1974) called &quot;The Technology and the Society&quot;, where Williams defended his visions against technological determinism, focusing on the prevalence of social over technological in the development of human processes. Thus &quot;Determination is a real social process, but never (as in some theological and some Marxist versions)... a wholly controlling, wholly predicting set of causes. On the contrary, the reality of determination is the setting of limits and the exertion of pressures, within which variable social practices are profoundly affected but never necessarily controlled.&quot;

His book &quot;Modern Tragedy&quot; may be read as a response to &quot;The Death of Tragedy&quot; by the conservative literary critic George Steiner. Later, Williams was interested in the work of Pierre Bourdieu, although he found it too pessimistic about the possibilities for social change.

=== Last years ===
Williams joined the Labour Party after he moved to Cambridge in 1961, but resigned in 1966 after the new majority Labour government had broken the seafarers&#x27; strike and introduced public expenditure cuts. He joined the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign, and wrote the May Day Manifesto (published 1967), along with Edward Thompson and Stuart Hall. Williams later became a Plaid Cymru member and a Welsh nationalist. He retired from Cambridge in 1983 and spent his last years in Saffron Walden. While there he wrote &quot;Loyalties&quot;, a novel about a fictional group of upper-class radicals attracted to 1930s Communism.

Williams was working on &quot;People of the Black Mountains&quot;, an experimental historical novel about people who lived or might have lived around the Black Mountains, his own part of Wales, told through flashbacks featuring an ordinary man in modern times, looking for his grandfather, who has not returned from a hill-walk. He imagines the region as it was and might have been. The story begins in the Paleolithic, and would have come up to modern times, focusing on ordinary people. He had completed it to the Middle Ages by the time he died in 1988. The whole work was prepared for publication by his wife, Joy Williams, then published in two volumes with a postscript briefly describing what the remainder would have been. Almost all the stories were complete in typescript, mostly revised many times by the author. Only &quot;The Comet&quot; was left incomplete and needed small additions for a continuous narrative.

In the 1980s, Williams made important links to debates on feminism, peace, ecology and social movements, and extended his position beyond what might be recognised as Marxism. He concluded that with many different societies in the world, there would be not one, but many socialisms. Influenced partly by critical readings of Sebastiano Timpanaro and Rudolf Bahro, he called for convergence between the labour movement and what was then called the ecology movement.

The Raymond Williams Society was founded in 1989 &quot;to support and develop intellectual and political projects in areas broadly connected with Williams&#x27;s work&quot;. Since 1998 it has published &quot;Key Words: A Journal of Cultural Materialism&quot;, which is &quot;committed to developing the tradition of cultural materialism&quot; he originated. 

The Raymond Williams Centre for Recovery Research opened at Nottingham Trent University in 1995. 

he Raymond Williams Foundation (RWF) supports activities in adult education; In 2024 the Raymond Williams Foundation offers grants and in 2022 celebrated Williams&#x27; centenary. The Foundation was originally formed in 1988 as the Raymond Williams Memorial Fund. 

A collaborative research project building on Williams&#x27;s investigation of cultural keywords called the &quot;Keywords Project&quot;, initiated in 2006, is supported by Jesus College, University of Cambridge, and the University of Pittsburgh. Similar projects building on Williams&#x27;s legacy include the 2005 publication, &quot;New Keywords: A Revised Vocabulary of Culture and Society&quot;, edited by the cultural-studies scholars Tony Bennett, Lawrence Grossberg, and Meaghan Morris, and the &quot;Keywords&quot; series from New York University Press including &quot;Keywords for American Cultural Studies.&quot;

In 2007 a collection of Williams&#x27;s papers was deposited at Swansea University by his daughter Merryn, a poet and author.

<doc id="167782" wikidata="Q1200546" url="?curid=167782" title="Descent (video game)">
<text>Descent is a first-person shooter (FPS) game developed by Parallax Software and released by Interplay Productions in 1995 for MS-DOS, and later for Macintosh, PlayStation, and RISC OS. It popularized a subgenre of FPS games employing six degrees of freedom and was the first FPS to feature entirely true-3D graphics. The player is cast as a mercenary hired to eliminate the threat of a mysterious extraterrestrial computer virus infecting off-world mining robots. In a series of mines throughout the Solar System, the protagonist pilots a spaceship and must locate and destroy the mine&#x27;s power reactor and escape before being caught in the mine&#x27;s self-destruction, defeating opposing robots along the way. Players can play online and compete in either deathmatches or cooperate to take on the robots.

&quot;Descent&quot; was a commercial success. Together with its sequel, it sold over 1.1 million units as of 1998 and was critically acclaimed. Commentators and reviewers compared it to &quot;Doom&quot; and praised its unrestrained range of motion and full 3D graphics. The combination of traditional first-person shooter mechanics with that of a space flight simulator was also well received. Complaints tended to focus on the frequency for the player to become disoriented and the potential to induce motion sickness. The game&#x27;s success spawned expansion packs and the sequels &quot;Descent II&quot; (1996) and &quot;Descent 3&quot; (1999).

==Gameplay==
===Single-player===
&quot;Descent&quot; is a first-person shooter and shoot &#x27;em up game wherein the player pilots a spaceship through labyrinthine mines while fighting virus-infected robots, using the ship&#x27;s armaments. They must find and destroy each mine&#x27;s reactor core, triggering a meltdown that will destroy the mine as the player escapes. For two levels, the reactor core is replaced with a boss. To obtain access to the reactor, the player must collect one or a combination of the three colored access keys for each level. As a secondary objective, the player can also choose to rescue PTMC (Post Terran Mining Corporation) workers who were taken hostage by the infected robots.

&quot;Descent&quot; features 30 levels, of which three are secret levels. Each level is based in a mine or military installation in various locations in the Solar System. The game demands that players keep their sense of orientation in a fully 3D environment with a flight model featuring six degrees of freedom in zero-gravity. It also provides a 3-dimensional wire-frame automap that displays any area of the current mine visited or seen by the player. Variously colored lines indicate locked doors and zones such as energy stations and reactor areas. These mines may contain hidden doors or robot generators that spawn enemy robots. Flares and lasers light up dark areas of the mine.

Items are available as collectible power-ups. They are either scattered throughout the mines or may be obtained by destroying robots. Weapons are split up into primary and secondary weapons. Primary weapons range from lasers to wide-range Spreadfire Cannons to the chargeable Fusion Cannons whose shots can punch through numerous enemies. They all consume energy as their ammunition, except for the Vulcan Cannon, which uses rounds of explosive shells. Secondary weapons include various missiles (both unguided and homing) including the Smart Missile which upon impact released several smaller guided bomblets, as well as Proximity Bombs that are dropped behind the player&#x27;s craft to slow pursuing enemies. The player&#x27;s spacecraft uses shield power as health, and can carry a maximum of 200 units of shields and energy each. Energy is replenished from energy power-ups or recharged to 100 units at permanent energy centers. Shields can only be restored by collecting blue shield orbs. There are also power-ups that modify the ship&#x27;s status and weaponry. For example, Cloaking Devices temporarily render the ship invisible, Invulnerability temporarily inhibits receiving damage, and Quad Lasers modify the ship&#x27;s laser system to fire four bolts of energy instead of the standard two. Points are gained by defeating robots, rescuing hostages, and escaping the mine before its self-destruction. If the player ship&#x27;s shields drop to 0, the ship is destroyed, all acquired weapons are strewn about the area as power-ups, and any rescued hostages aboard are killed. The ship respawns at the cost of a life and the player must navigate the mines to regain the power-ups. Players can record and later view their experiences in the form of demos, both in single-player and multiplayer.

===Multiplayer===
&quot;Descent&quot; allows online competitive and cooperative multiplayer sessions. The competitive sector consists of &quot;Anarchy&quot;, &quot;Team Anarchy&quot;, and &quot;Anarchy With Robots&quot;, three deathmatch modes whereby players attempt to destroy as many of each other&#x27;s ships as possible. Team Anarchy assigns players to two opposing teams, and Anarchy With Robots adds hostile robots to the match. In Cooperative, players team up to destroy mines and compete for the highest score. Competitive modes allow a maximum of eight players and cooperative modes allow up to four. Players can press a single key to type a message referred to as a taunt, rather than pausing to type in the full message. They can also join same servers across different platforms, particularly MS-DOS and Macintosh.

==Plot==
&quot;Descent&quot; is set in 2169. The story begins with a briefing between PTMC executive S. Dravis and the player&#x27;s character, PTMC&#x27;s best &quot;Material Defender&quot;, who is hired on a mercenary basis to eliminate the threat of a mysterious alien computer virus infecting the machines and robots used for off-world mining operations.

The PTMC developed numerous mines in the Solar System&#x27;s planets and moons for a variety of uses, including resource extraction, science research, and military installations. Prior to entering a mine, the player receives an intelligence briefing upon the robots used there, however the computer virus has resulted in some existing robots either modified considerably or even new robots being produced that PTMC is unaware about. The player starts with the mines on the Moon and later shift to Venus and to Mercury, where a boss robot has to be destroyed. Afterward, the mines progress further away from the Sun, as the player visits Mars, then the moons of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and eventually to Pluto and its moon Charon. The player accesses the three secret levels located in the asteroid belt using alternative exit doors hidden in specific levels.

After defeating the boss robot on Charon, the Material Defender is informed he cannot return to the PTMC&#x27;s headquarters in Earth orbit, as there is a chance his ship may be infected with the same virus as the defeated robots. His employer also mentions that PTMC has lost contact with their deep-space installations outside the Solar System, setting the stage for the sequel.

==Development==
&quot;Descent&quot; was co-created by programmers Mike Kulas and Matt Toschlog. It has origins as far back as 1986, when Toschlog first joined the gaming industry at Sublogic, where he also first met Kulas. There, the pair worked on various simulation titles from &quot;Flight Simulator 2&quot; to &quot;Jet&quot;. Toschlog left the company in 1988 for Looking Glass, where he worked with Ned Lerner to develop &quot;Car and Driver.&quot; Kulas joined the company in 1990 to develop utilities for &quot;Car and Driver&quot;. The two had devised an idea of an indoor flight simulator that used shaded polygons. After working on &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot; however, they realized they could add textures to the polygons for a spectacular effect. By April 1993, they finished a two-page sketch for what would become &quot;Descent&quot;.

&quot;Descent&quot; took about 21 months to finish. According to Kulas, the game cost around US$450,000 to make. The game&#x27;s marketing budget was $1 million. Deciding that their idea was too good for anyone else to develop it, Kulas and Toschlog left Looking Glass in June 1993 to form Parallax Software. They hired Che-Yuan Wang and John Slagel as their programmers, with Wang also being their level designer. They also hired Adam Pletcher as their artist. They set out to contact publishers, including Scott Miller of Apogee Software, id Software&#x27;s primary publisher, who was excited about their proposal and signed a contract with them. For the next seven months, Apogee invested in Parallax and shared with them experience they had gained from developing their own 3D shareware titles. Parallax would implement artistic and structural changes that Apogee requested. After those months, Apogee had numerous projects in the works, and Parallax&#x27;s project became more expensive to create, so Apogee severed its involvement in the project.

Left without a publisher, Parallax spent the next three months to develop a mock-up prototype, continuing their coding. The project was originally titled &quot;Miner&quot;, but Parallax presented their prototype in written letters to 50 game companies as &quot;Inferno&quot;. Of those letters, three of them received a reply. One of them was from Interplay, who immediately signed the company up. Until the game&#x27;s full release, Interplay&#x27;s producer Rusty Buchert would oversee and guide the development of the project. Parallax hired three more people to finish the project: level designers Mark Dinse and Jasen Whiteside and story writer and 3D modeler Josh White.

During level design, the idea of simple connected tunnels as the sole component of level architecture expanded to also include rooms and exits. As levels became more complex and confusing, the developers added an automap to address this problem. To design the levels, &quot;Descent&quot;″s graphics engine uses portal rendering, which uses collections of cubes to form rooms and tunnels. Within the game, sides of cubes can be attached to other cubes, or display up to two texture maps. Cubes can be deformed so long as they remain convex. To create effects like doors and see-through grating, walls could be placed at the connected sides of two cubes. Robots were drawn as polygonal models; sprites were only used to represent the hostages and power-ups. This system was very efficient, and made possible the first truly 3D textured environment in a video game.

Another obstacle to overcome was adding online multiplayer. Parallax found it difficult to implement and were initially reluctant to do so. At the same time during development, they had learned of &quot;Doom&quot; and the popularity of its multiplayer. Interplay sent Rob Huebner to help Parallax program multiplayer. Near their project&#x27;s completion, Parallax faced yet another obstacle: they needed to make sure that their highly detailed and complex game could run smoothly on computers. Although ultimately the requirements to run the game fast were high, an added option to adjust detail complexity did help.

===Releases and ports===
Parallax Software and Interplay followed the shareware model used by Apogee and id Software, and on December 24, 1994; uploaded a seven-level shareware demo as &quot;Descent&quot; both in retail and on the Internet.

The full game for MS-DOS was released in the United Kingdom on March 3, 1995, and in North America on March 17, 1995, followed by a Macintosh port published by MacPlay in December 1995. A modified version of &quot;Descent&quot; with stereoscopic graphics was released as a bundle with StereoGraphics&#x27;s SimulEyes VR 3D glasses.

A PlayStation port was released in Japan on January 26, 1996, in the United States on March 12, 1996, and in Europe that same month, with SoftBank being the Japanese version&#x27;s developer. The PlayStation version replaces the still screens and text with full-motion video pre-rendered cutscenes incorporating voice acting.

November 22, 1995 also saw the release of &quot;Descent: Levels of the World&quot;, an add-on containing over 100 winning level submissions from a design competition held by Interplay, plus one level designed by Parallax Software. Also in March 1996, &quot;Descent: Anniversary Edition&quot; was released, which bundled &quot;Descent&quot;, &quot;Levels of the World&quot;, as well as additional exclusive levels.

On October 29, 1997, Interplay published &quot;Descent I and II: The Definitive Collection&quot;, a compilation containing the full versions of &quot;Descent&quot;, the &quot;Levels of the World&quot; mission pack, &quot;Descent II&quot;, and &quot;Vertigo&quot; mission packs, and a mission editor. Besides a choice of the original &quot;Descent II&quot; levels (subtitled &quot;Counterstrike&quot;), or the &quot;Vertigo Series&quot; levels, the first &quot;Descent&quot; levels (subtitled &quot;The First Strike&quot;) can be started in the &quot;Descent II&quot; game UI where robots adopt the &quot;Descent II&quot; sounds and improved AI. The original &quot;Descent&quot; program is included for players that prefer the unmodified &quot;The First Strike&quot;, as well as to run &quot;Levels of the World&quot;. There is also a preview for the upcoming &quot;Descent 3&quot;.

&quot;Descent&quot; was later ported to RISC OS by R-Comp Interactive in late 1998, which received a 32-bit update in 2003.

====Cancelled ports====
A Sega 32X version of &quot;Descent&quot; was planned as the first console version, but it was never released. A 3DO Interactive Multiplayer version was showcased at E3 1995 and slated to be published by Interplay, but never came to fruition for unknown reasons. Likewise, a Panasonic M2 version was also announced but never released due to the system&#x27;s cancellation. A planned Sega Saturn version was cancelled because the programmers found that a straight port of the PlayStation version was not possible, and they did not think it would be worth their while to do a more elaborate port for the Saturn. Interplay had plans dating to mid-1996 to port &quot;Descent&quot; to Nintendo 64 under the name &quot;Ultra Descent&quot;. The port was delayed before it was eventually cancelled in 1998 in favor of &quot;Descent 3&quot;, with Parallax&#x27;s Jim Boone explaining that it never reached the design phase in development. In April 2010, Interplay partnered with independent developer G1M2 to release a WiiWare version for Fall 2010. It would have featured enhanced textures and a variety of controls, including motion controls of a Wii Remote and Nunchuk with a MotionPlus accessory and possibly a Wii Balance Board. The deadline was missed, and the last time the developer publicly provided an update on its progress was in a response to a news inquiry in 2011, assuring that the project was still underway, before it was ultimately quietly abandoned.

===Mods===
&quot;Descent&quot; uses package files to store and load level data such as level structures, graphics, objects, and sound effects and music—similar to the WAD file format used for &quot;Doom&quot;. It also allows players to create their own such files containing the data, which can then be loaded and played. Later in 1997 on the end-of-life commercial cycle came the release of the game&#x27;s source code, excluding the audio code. Parallax released the source code under the license that permits non-commercial uses only. All of this, combined with the game&#x27;s popularity, has resulted in a number of distributed mods.

===Re-releases===
&quot;Descent&quot; was re-released on modern digital distribution services. It was one of the launch titles for the open beta version of Good Old Games on September 8, 2008, followed by a Steam release on February 13, 2014. However, the game was withdrawn from Good Old Games in December 2015 along with &quot;Descent II&quot; and &quot;Descent 3&quot;, and later from Steam. A representative of Parallax Software responded to speculation on the Good Old Games forums regarding the withdrawal of the titles. Interplay owned the &quot;Descent&quot; trademark and the publishing rights to those games, but their developers still retained the copyrights to them. The latter pulled their games off because Interplay purportedly had not paid them royalties since 2007. As a result, they had terminated the sales agreement, disallowing Interplay from further selling them.

However, in November 2017, Good Old Games announced that the Descent series would be available for sale again on their platform. The game has also since resurfaced on Steam.

==Reception==

===Pre-release===
Customer reception of the shareware version of &quot;Descent&quot; was very positive, with players praising the fully 3D environment and commentators noting perceived &quot;loyalty and goodwill&quot; that both Parallax and Interplay fostered. However, it also garnered player complaints about a technical bug that would recharge each robot&#x27;s shields whenever the player ship was destroyed (the problem was exacerbated on the last level of the shareware, where the power reactor is replaced with a boss and the gameplay thus becomes extremely difficult). It also received complaints for lacking the ability to save &quot;in-game&quot;, instead saving the player&#x27;s progress &quot;between&quot; levels. Parallax recognized the bug and the popularity of the save feature, so they released patches to address the issues. Mark Burgess of &quot;PC Zone&quot; called it one of the best shoot &#x27;em up games and wrote that it justified shareware, giving it a perfect five floppy disks out of five. &quot;Descent&quot; would later go on to become one of the games to inspire other retailers and software companies to look into and embrace the shareware model.

===Sales===
On &quot;Electronic Entertainment&quot;″s charts in March 1995, the PC and CD-ROM editions of &quot;Descent&quot; appeared as Nos. 5 and 8 of the top-selling PC and CD-ROM titles before climbing to Nos. 4 and 3 the next month, respectively. The game first appeared on &quot;PC Zone&quot;″s charts of the top-selling games in May 1995, landing on Nos. 4 and 2 on the top full price and CD-ROM titles, respectively. The shareware version appeared as No. 3 on the top budget games. In June 1995, the CD-ROM version dropped off, and the shareware version fell to No. 6 of the budget games and the full game to No. 9 of the full price games before dropping off next month. The full game rose back up in August 1995 to No. 19 of the top full price games, while the shareware version fell down to No. 7 of the top commercial titles. The game dropped off &quot;PC Zone&quot;″s charts altogether the next month. The Macintosh port also landed on No. 10 of the top Macintosh games in December 1995.

Interplay estimated in March 1995 before &quot;Descent&quot;″s full release that shareware copies of &quot;Descent&quot; were distributed 900,000 times via online services, on the Internet, or at retail. Official global sales of the game, together with its sequel, surpassed 1.1 million copies as of June 1998, while VentureBeat estimated in 2015 that the actual sales figure of the original was as high as 25 million copies.

===Computer versions===
The computer versions of &quot;Descent&quot; received near-universal acclaim, with reviewers widely comparing it to &quot;Doom&quot; and noting its unique use of free motion, as well as a fully three-dimensional environment. The multiplayer aspect received equal acclaim. Michael Ryan of &quot;PC Magazine&quot; enthusiastically attributed the attention the game received to its unique gameplay and found no similar alternatives. &quot;GameSpot&quot; remarked that &quot;only one 3-D shooter adds a whole new dimension to the field: &quot;Descent&quot;.&quot;, particularly noting the labyrinthine environments. Charlie Brooker of &quot;PC Zone&quot; noted the game&#x27;s intense environment and similarities to &quot;Doom&quot; and praised its multiplayer and ability to taunt opposing players, with only minor criticism directed toward its slight repetitiveness. Common complaints tended to focus on &quot;Descent&quot;″s ability to disorient players, as well as potentially induce motion sickness.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; particularly praised the graphics and animation, intelligent enemies, and wide array of power-ups, all of which it said would &quot;keep most gamers glued to the screen for hours&quot;. They were however disappointed by the game&#x27;s delayed release, asserting it led to the game being overshadowed by id Software&#x27;s then-newly released &quot;Heretic&quot;. Nevertheless, they rated it the fourth-best virtual reality game in September 1995 due to its 3D environment and graphics. In its third-highest-rated review, &quot;PC Player&quot; also praised the intelligent enemies, as well as the lighting effects, the use of various graphical textures, and &quot;genuine&quot; 3D graphics. &quot;Edge&quot; remarked the ability to record demos that capture the player&#x27;s experiences, but also criticized the slightly repetitive gameplay and noted the robots&#x27; basic algorithm of being only a little more than &quot;fire and evade&quot;, despite their intelligence.

The Macintosh port of &quot;Descent&quot; also received praise. Bob LeVitus of &quot;MacUser&quot; called it &quot;one of the best Mac games ever released&quot;, attributing its popularity to its online multiplayer mode. His only criticism was the high system requirements (the port required a Power Macintosh to play) and a difficult learning curve. &quot;Macworld&quot;″s Fred DeLisio also praised the enemy artificial intelligence, realism and sense of immersion, and multiplayer for allowing cross-platform sessions between MS-DOS and Macintosh users and allowing players to join and quit anytime without ending the sessions for everyone else, but also criticized the high system requirements.

Jeremy Parish of &quot;USgamer&quot; ran a retrospective feature on the game, saying &quot;Descent&quot; combined the genre of space flight simulator with a first-person shooter experience. He also attributed the game&#x27;s popularity and modifiability to the continued development of fan mods. &quot;Engadget&quot;″s David Lumb retrospectively likened the game&#x27;s graphical innovations to the computer-generated imagery used in the 1995 film &quot;Toy Story&quot;. &quot;GamesTM&quot; rated it No. 4 on their retrospective &quot;Top Five FPS&quot; list for its truly 3D environment combined with the six degrees of freedom, and &quot;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&quot; ranked it No. 13 on its list of &quot;The best space games on PC&quot;, citing the game&#x27;s numerous innovations, speed, labyrinthine level structures, and the free range of motion.
====Accolades====
===PlayStation version===
The PlayStation port of &quot;Descent&quot; also received praise, which was often directed to the port&#x27;s use of impressive lighting effects. Like its computer versions, criticism commonly centered on the player&#x27;s disorientation. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; called it an outstanding conversion due to its extremely fast rendering speed and improved lighting effects. However, two of them felt that the gameplay lacked excitement. Major Mike of &quot;GamePro&quot; also judged it &quot;an excellent conversion&quot; due to its complex but generally easy to master controls, though he did complain of occasional severe slowdown. &quot;Maximum&quot; stated it &quot;is one of the greatest games to grace the PlayStation, and rates alongside &quot;WipeOut&quot; as one of the best ambassadors for the machine.&quot; They particularly applauded the labyrinthine level design and intelligent enemy AI. Their subsequent feature on the game was more critical, saying that &quot;the official PAL version of &quot;Descent&quot; features some of the most hideous letterbox PAL borders we&#x27;ve ever seen, with no sign of PAL optimization whatsoever.&quot; However, it also praised the game&#x27;s use of the PlayStation Link Cable.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; too praised the developers for adding a new industrial soundtrack to the PlayStation version rather than doing a direct port. Like Major Mike, they found the controls complex but easy to master. While criticizing that the game can be dry and repetitive, they concluded that &quot;Overall, you still can&#x27;t go wrong, and if you&#x27;ve got the ability to fly against someone else, it doesn&#x27;t get much better.&quot; K. Lee of &quot;GameFan&quot; praised the sound and music and noted the game&#x27;s difficulty due to the ubiquitous doors on walls, ceilings, and floors. He thought the automap was useful, though still found it too easy to become disoriented.

&quot;Descent&quot; is credited with starting a subgenre of six-degrees-of-freedom first-person shooters, and remains an icon of the subgenre. It holds a Guinness World Record for being the first fully 3D first-person shooter, and its popularity spawned two sequels: Descent II in 1996 and Descent 3 in 1999. It also led to a 1999 trilogy of Peter Telep novels based on the series, comprising &quot;Descent&quot;, &quot;Descent: Stealing Thunder&quot;, and &quot;Descent: Equinox&quot;. It brought about a handful of similar &quot;&quot;Descent&quot; clones&quot;, most notably &quot;Forsaken&quot;, which was released by Acclaim Entertainment in 1998 and had similar graphics and almost identical gameplay to &quot;Descent&quot;.

In 1997, Interplay released &quot;Descent to Undermountain&quot;, a role-playing video game that used a modified version of the &quot;Descent&quot; graphics engine.

Since &quot;Descent 3&quot;, there had been plans and considerations to work on another game in the series. Those were either cancelled or abandoned in favor of other projects. Volition, the developer of the &quot;&quot; series, began work on &quot;Descent 4.&quot; Again, development was cancelled, as most of the company was interested in developing a fantasy role-playing game instead. It would have been a prequel to &quot;Descent&quot;, and reportedly served as the basis for the 2001 first-person shooter &quot;Red Faction.&quot; Similarities would have included plot points such as an evil faceless corporation and the mysterious &quot;Plague&quot; they are attempting to harness. President of Volition Mike Kulas stated in an interview that the &quot;Red Faction&quot; and &quot;Descent&quot; universes are strictly separate, but also that the code intended for &quot;Descent 4&quot; had been used in &quot;Red Faction&quot;.

A series revival was planned in the late 2010s when development of another &quot;Descent&quot; title was confirmed. On Kickstarter in March 2015, Descendent Studios announced a prequel to the original game, partnering with Interplay and using their intellectual property rights to develop it. Titled simply &quot;Descent&quot;, it would have been the first game since &quot;Descent 3&quot; to be released in the series. However, after a settlement in 2022, the game was renamed to &quot;Ships That Fight Underground&quot;, dropping the &quot;Descent&quot; title altogether. Another game, &quot;Overload,&quot; was announced on Kickstarter by Revival Productions and successfully crowdfunded in 2016. It included many of the former employees of Parallax Software, including co-founders Mike Kulas and Matt Toschlog. It is a six-degrees-of-freedom tunnel shooter and a spiritual successor to the &quot;Descent&quot; games that released in 2018.

<doc id="167785" wikidata="Q1146254" url="?curid=167785" title="Royal Shakespeare Company">
<text>The Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) is a major British theatre company, based in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, England. The company employs over 1,000 staff and opens around 20 productions a year. The RSC plays regularly in London, Stratford-upon-Avon, and on tour across the UK and internationally.

The company&#x27;s home is in Stratford-upon-Avon, where it has redeveloped its Royal Shakespeare and Swan theatres as part of a £112.8-million &quot;Transformation&quot; project. The theatres re-opened in November 2010, having closed in 2007.

As well as the plays of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, the RSC produces new work from living artists.

==Company history==

===The early years===

There have been theatrical performances in Stratford-upon-Avon since at least Shakespeare&#x27;s day, though the first recorded performance of a play written by Shakespeare himself was in 1746 when Parson Joseph Greene, master of Stratford Grammar School, organised a charitable production to fund the restoration of Shakespeare&#x27;s funerary monument. John Ward&#x27;s Birmingham-based company, the Warwickshire Company of Comedians, agreed to perform it. A surviving copy of the playbill records that the company performed &quot;Othello&quot;. The first building erected to commemorate Shakespeare was David Garrick&#x27;s Jubilee Pavilion in 1769, and there have been at least 17 buildings used to perform Shakespeare&#x27;s plays since.

The first permanent commemorative building to Shakespeare&#x27;s works in the town was a theatre built in 1827, in the gardens of New Place, but has long since been demolished. The RSC&#x27;s history began with the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, which was the brainchild of a local brewer, Charles Edward Flower. He donated a site by the River Avon and in 1875 launched an international campaign to build a theatre in the town of Shakespeare&#x27;s birth. The theatre, a Victorian-Gothic building seating just over 700 people, opened on 23 April 1879, with a performance of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, a title which gave ammunition to several critics.

The Memorial, a red brick Gothic cathedral, designed by &quot;Dodgshun and Unsworth&quot; of Westminster, was unkindly described by Bernard Shaw as &quot;an admirable building, adaptable to every purpose except that of a theatre.&quot; From 1919, under the direction of William Bridges-Adams and after a slow start, its resident New Shakespeare Company became one of the most prestigious in Britain. The theatre received a royal charter of Incorporation in 1925, which gave it status.

On the afternoon of 6 March 1926, when a new season was about to commence rehearsals, smoke was seen. Fire broke out, and the mass of half-timbering chosen to ornament the interior provided dry tinder. By the following morning the theatre was a blackened shell. The company transferred its Shakespeare festivals to a converted local cinema. Fund-raising began for the rebuilding of the theatre, with generous donations arriving from philanthropists in America.

In January 1928, following an open competition, 29-year-old Elisabeth Scott was unanimously appointed architect for the new theatre which became the first important work erected in the United Kingdom from the designs of a female architect. George Bernard Shaw commented that her design was the only one that showed any theatre sense. Her modernist plans for an art deco structure came under fire from many directions but the new building was opened triumphantly on William Shakespeare&#x27;s birthday, 23 April 1932. Later it came under the direction of Sir Barry Jackson in 1945, Anthony Quayle from 1948 to 1956 and Glen Byam Shaw 1957–1959, with an impressive roll-call of actors. Scott&#x27;s building, with some minor adjustments to the stage, remained in constant use until 2007 when it was closed for a major refit of the interior.

===The RSC===

====Foundation and history====
In 1959, while still the director-designate of the Memorial Theatre, Peter Hall announced that the formation of a permanent company would be a primary objective. David Addenbrooke wrote of Hall&#x27;s belief that Shakespeare, more than any other dramatist, needed a &#x27;style&#x27;, a tradition and unity of direction and acting. On 14 January 1960, Hall&#x27;s first policy statement as director also proposed the acquisition of a second theatre, in London, to be used as a city outlet for selected Stratford productions. The RSC was formally established on 20 March 1961 with the royal announcement that the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre would henceforth be known as the Royal Shakespeare Theatre and the company as the Royal Shakespeare Company.

The critic Michael Billington, summarising these events, wrote: &quot;In 1960 the twenty-nine-year-old Peter Hall formally took charge at Stratford-upon-Avon and set about turning a star-laden, six-month Shakespeare festival into a monumental, year-round operation built around a permanent company, a London base and contemporary work from home and abroad. Looking back, it is difficult to realise just how radical Hall&#x27;s dream was at the time; or indeed how much opposition there was to the creation of what became officially known in March 1961 as the Royal Shakespeare Company.&quot;

John Barton had been appointed associate director in January 1960, and was followed in 1962 by Michel Saint-Denis, Peter Brook and Clifford Williams who joined the company as resident directors. John Bury was appointed head of design in 1964. The repertoire was also widened to take in modern work and classics other than Shakespeare.

In 1962, strong opposition to the establishment of a London base for the RSC came from the Royal National Theatre which – led by Viscount Chandos and Laurence Olivier – wished to be the sole subsidised company operating in London. Following a deal with Prince Littler, managing director of Associated Theatre Properties, the RSC established the Aldwych Theatre as its London base for productions transferred from Stratford to London, its stage redesigned to match the RST&#x27;s apron stage.

Twenty years later, in the summer of 1982, the company took up London residence in both the Barbican Theatre and The Pit studio space in the Barbican Centre under the auspices of the City of London. The RSC was closely involved in the design of these two venues. In 2002 it left the Barbican after a series of allegedly poor seasons, partly because the then artistic director Adrian Noble wanted to develop the company&#x27;s touring performances. His decision means the company has no regular London home.

====Innovation and growth====
The RSC had first tackled its need for a small auditorium in 1971. At the insistence of Sir Trevor Nunn (who had taken over as artistic director in 1968), the company hired The Place off the Euston Road in London and constructed its own theatre space for an audience of 330, seated on raked wooden benches. Two seasons of plays were staged in 1972 and 1973, none suitable for the Aldwych. In December 1973 Buzz Goodbody, the company&#x27;s first female director, drew up a plan for what would become The Other Place studio theatre in Stratford, designed by Michael Reardon to seat 140 people, which opened to a first and highly successful season in 1974. The name chosen for the new studio space was favoured within the company because it implied an alternative theatre, but also because it is a quotation from &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

In August 1976, Nunn staged &quot;Macbeth&quot; with a minimalist set at The Other Place, playing for 2 hours 15 minutes without an interval. The small, nearly round stage focused attention on the psychological dynamics of the characters. Both Ian McKellen in the title role and Judi Dench as Lady Macbeth received exceptionally favourable reviews. The production transferred to London, opening at the Donmar Warehouse in September 1977 before its further transfer to the larger Young Vic venue for a two-month season. It was also recorded for transmission by Thames Television. In 2004, members of the RSC voted Dench&#x27;s performance the greatest by an actress in the history of the company.

Summing up this triumphant period, The Guardian critic Michael Billington later wrote: &quot;[In 1977] the RSC struck gold. This was, in fact, the perihelion of Trevor Nunn&#x27;s ten-year reign as the company&#x27;s sole Artistic Director and Chief Executive (in 1978 he began to share power with Terry Hands). In London, the company opened a new studio space at the Donmar Warehouse with plays by Barker, Taylor, Bond and Brecht. Its Aldwych repertory combined the usual Stratford transfers with Nichol&#x27;s &quot;Privates on Parade&quot;, Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Pillars of the Community&quot; and Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Days of the Commune&quot;. At the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Terry Hands and actor Alan Howard had a marathon year working on &quot;Henry V&quot;, a virtually uncut, &quot;Henry VI, part 1&quot;, &quot;Henry VI, part 2&quot; and &quot;Henry VI, part 3&quot; and &quot;Coriolanus&quot;. And the action at The Other Place included Jonson, Ford, Musset, Gems and Rudkin. No other company in the world could match that output for quantity and quality&quot;.

Nunn and Hands were joint artistic directors of the RSC when the company opened The Swan, its third theatre in Stratford. The Swan Theatre, also designed by Michael Reardon, has a deep thrust stage and a galleried, intimate 450-capacity auditorium. The space was to be dedicated to playing the works of Shakespeare&#x27;s contemporaries, the works of European writers and the occasional work of Shakespeare. The theatre was launched on 8 May 1986 with a production of &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher (not published until 1634 and thought to be Shakespeare&#x27;s last work for the stage). It was directed by Barry Kyle.

==== Costumes and props ====
The RSC&#x27;s costume department is &#x27;the largest in-house costume-making workshop in British theatre&#x27; and &#x27;world-renowned&#x27;. In 2021, the RSC raised over £8 million for a project to update the costume and prop department. Alistair McArthur, head of costume, called the old working space &quot;Dickensian&quot; and added, &quot;If we knew there was rain coming we&#x27;d have to clear everything off the table the night before.&quot;

The prop-makers design and make many of their own props for the many productions. A &#x27;Prop Shop&#x27; in Stratford-upon-Avon is the studio in which most of the props are made.

====Troubled times====
Nunn (who had been appointed to follow Hall&#x27;s tenure at the National Theatre in 1968) ceded his RSC executive directorship in 1986 to his co-artistic director Terry Hands, who bore the brunt of media hostility during a difficult few years for the company. Hands took the decision to suspend the RSC&#x27;s residency at The Barbican Theatre and The Pit during the winter season of 1990–91, thus vacating the capital for the first time in 30 years. This was seen as essential if the RSC was to secure an increase in subsidy from the Arts Council.

Shortly after that decision Adrian Noble returned to the RSC to take over from Hands as artistic director and chief executive. The company had serious funding problems. Noble&#x27;s decision to sever all RSC connections with the Barbican Centre, funded by the Corporation of the City of London, was widely condemned, and towards the end of his tenure things began to go terribly wrong, partly through his pursuit and support of the so-called Project Fleet, a radical scheme aimed at rescuing the RSC from its financial crisis by replacing the Royal Shakespeare Theatre with a crowd-pleasing &#x27;Shakespeare Village&#x27; and streamlining the company&#x27;s performance structure and ensemble principle.

====A 21st-century renaissance====
None of Noble&#x27;s plans came to fruition. He left the job an unhappy man in March 2003. Michael Boyd then assumed control of the RSC, now burdened with a deficit of £2.8 million. By a combination of artistic excellence and quiet husbandry, including a year-long Complete Works of Shakespeare Festival (begun in April 2006 in collaboration with other theatre companies) plus a financially successful London season at the Novello Theatre in 2006, Boyd slowly rebuilt the company&#x27;s fortunes and reputation

In 2007 he launched the long-awaited Stratford theatre redevelopments, including construction of the temporary Courtyard Theatre while work was in progress, designed to house his RSC Histories cycle before its transfer to the Roundhouse in London in 2008. Talking of these achievements with typical modesty he told the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; in December 2007 (&#x27;The Man Who Remade the RSC&#x27;): &quot;There was a bit of gardening to do, but we are now beginning to show signs of walking the walk.&quot; &#x27;The Histories&#x27; ensemble went on to win three Olivier awards in 2009. In addition, that same year the RSC commissioned a completely new edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s First Folio, titled &quot;William Shakespeare Complete Works&quot; and published by Modern Library.

To provide balance, Simon Trowbridge in &quot;A Royal Shakespeare Company Book&quot;, published in 2017, is highly critical of aspects of the Boyd years, including his decision to redevelop the Royal Shakespeare Theatre as a second Swan Theatre.

The RSC is the sole British member theatre of the Union of the Theatres of Europe.

In March 2008, the RSC launched a manifesto &#x27;Stand up for Shakespeare&#x27;, a campaign to promote a positive experience of Shakespeare for children and young people. The tenets of this manifesto, &quot;Do It on Your Feet, See It Live, Start It Earlier&quot; form the basis of the work of the Education department.

In 2010, the RSC opened a new suite of education spaces on Waterside.

In 2011, BP began to subsidised the RSC&#x27;s £5 ticket scheme for 16 to 25-year-olds.

In summer 2011 the company undertook a residency in Park Avenue Armory, New York, running a series of performances and an accompanying education programme in partnership with the NYC Department of Education.

In 2012, the RSC produced the World Shakespeare Festival, a celebration of &#x27;Shakespeare as the world&#x27;s playwright&#x27; working with UK and international arts organisations, and including the Globe to Globe Festival by Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe. The same year, planning permission was granted by Stratford District Council to reinstate The Other Place. Funding for the new theatre came from a £3 million grant from the Arts Council England, raised through the National Lottery. Funding was also received from the Gatsby Charitable Foundation, The Backstage Trust, and from public donations; this is the final phase of the Transformation project.

Live from Stratford-upon-Avon, a new project to broadcast the company&#x27;s productions in cinemas around the world and stream them into schools was announced in May 2013. The project began with Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot;, starring David Tennant, in November 2013, and followed up with &quot;Henry IV&quot; parts 1 and 2 and &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; in 2014.

In February 2016, Artistic Director Gregory Doran&#x27;s productions of &quot;Henry IV Part I&quot; and &quot;Henry IV Part II&quot;, and &quot;Henry V&quot; went on tour in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong as part of the King &amp; Country Tour. The same year, the Royal Shakespeare Company also opened their first permanent exhibition, entitled The Play&#x27;s The Thing.

On 23 April 2016, the RSC performed a one night extravaganza, called &#x27;Shakespeare Live!&#x27;. Broadcast on BBC Two from the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, it marked the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare&#x27;s Death. It involved a collection of Shakespeare scenes and monologues with appearances from David Tennant, Catherine Tate, Dame Judi Dench, Benedict Cumberbatch and even one from Prince Charles.

In June 2019, the actor Mark Rylance resigned from the RSC over its sponsorship deal with oil company BP.

In October 2019, the RSC announced that it would be ending its partnership with BP at the end of year following criticism of its association with the oil company. A week before, school students threatened to boycott the theatre company if it did not sever links with the firm. A spokesperson for the RSC explained that &quot;Young people are now saying clearly to us that the BP sponsorship is putting a barrier between them and their wish to engage with the RSC&quot;.

In February 2021, the RSC announced five new members to its board of trustees: Andrew Miller, Amanda Parker, Winsome Pinnock, Justine Themen and Ayanna Thompson.

It was announced that Daniel Evans and Tamara Harvey would become joint Artistic Directors from June 2023. Their first season was announced on 16 January 2024 commencing from April.

==Theatres==
The RSC has three permanent theatres in Stratford-upon-Avon:

* The Swan Theatre, a smaller thrust stage, capacity 461
* The Other Place, a studio theatre, rehearsal room and development space that opened in April 2016

The Courtyard Theatre was built as a temporary replacement for The Other Place theatre to house the company&#x27;s work when the RST and Swan were closed for the Transformation project. It provided a full-scale working prototype for the new RST&#x27;s auditorium, seating 1,045 people around a thrust stage. It was also used in 2012 for productions in the World Shakespeare Festival including &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; in an Indian setting. The Courtyard Theatre was replaced by The Other Place, which was reinstated as a 200-seat studio theatre in 2016. In July 2021, a temporary 500-seat outdoor theatre was built in the Swan Gardens named the Lydia &amp; Manfred Gorvy Garden Theatre. The theatre was built due to the COVID-19 pandemic to allow productions to return following the Government guidance, beginning with Phillip Breen&#x27;s production of &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; running during summer 2021. The theatre was resurrected and renamed as The Holloway Garden Theatre for the summer 2024 production of &quot;As You Like It&quot;, directed by Brendan O&#x27;Hea.

The company&#x27;s London presence has included tenancies of the Aldwych Theatre, The Place in Duke&#x27;s Road, Euston, the Donmar Warehouse in Covent Garden, the Barbican Theatre and The Pit at the Barbican Centre in the City of London. There have also been seasons at The Mermaid Theatre, the Almeida Theatre (1988 and 1989), the Roundhouse in Camden, the Young Vic, the Playhouse Theatre, the Novello Theatre and the Gielgud Theatre.

The Theatre Royal in Newcastle upon Tyne is the third home of the Royal Shakespeare Company, alongside Stratford-upon-Avon and London.

<doc id="167786" wikidata="Q1070743" url="?curid=167786" title="Sister Sledge">
<text>Sister Sledge was an American musical vocal group from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Formed in 1971, the group consists of sisters Joni, Kim, Debbie, and Kathy Sledge. The siblings achieved international success at the height of the disco era. In 1979, they released their breakthrough album &quot;We Are Family&quot;, which peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and included the 1979 US top-10 singles &quot;He&#x27;s the Greatest Dancer&quot; and &quot;We Are Family&quot;. &quot;We Are Family&quot; earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.

Their other US singles include a 1982 remake of Mary Wells&#x27;s 1964 hit &quot;My Guy&quot;, &quot;Mama Never Told Me&quot; (1973), and &quot;Thinking of You&quot; (1984), before reaching number one on the UK Singles Chart with the song &quot;Frankie&quot; in 1985. Remixed versions of three of their singles in 1993 returned them to the UK Top 20. Although Kathy undertook a solo career in 1989, she continued to tour with the group (with Kathy occasionally rejoining for one-off performances and several releases in the 1990s). In 2015, Sister Sledge performed for Pope Francis at the World Festival of Families in Philadelphia.

As of 2024, Debbie performs as part of group Sister Sledge ft. Sledgendary, with daughter Camille Sledge, son David Sledge, nephew Thaddeus Sledge, and vocalist Tanya Ti-et. Meanwhile, Kathy performs as part of the group Sister Sledge ft. Kathy Sledge with guest vocalists and dancers.

==Background==
Natives of Philadelphia, the sisters: Debra Edwina &quot;Debbie&quot; Sledge (born 1954), Joan Elise &quot;Joni&quot; Sledge (1956–2017), Kim Sledge (born 1957), and Kathy Sledge (born 1959) are the daughters of Broadway tap dancer Edwin Sledge (1923–1996) and actress Florez Sledge (née Williams; 1928–2007) The sisters were given vocal training by their grandmother Viola Williams, a former lyric soprano opera singer and protégée of civil rights leader Mary McLeod Bethune. Under Viola&#x27;s guidance, they regularly sang at their family church, Williams Temple Christian Methodist Episcopal, until forming a band and performing at charity and political events throughout Philadelphia, aptly named &quot;Mrs. Williams&#x27; Grandchildren&quot;. The sisters graduated from Olney High School: Debbie in 1972, Joni in 1974, Kim in 1975, and Kathy in 1977. By the end of the decade, all four sisters graduated from Temple University in Philadelphia.

==Career==
===Early career===
The group toured much of the East Coast, including New York, New Jersey, and home town Philadelphia with Florez acting as their manager (and tour bus driver) and Debbie as musical director. They released their first single &quot;Time Will Tell&quot; in 1971 on local music label Money Back. In 1973, they released the single &quot;Mama Never Told Me&quot;, which became a top-20 hit in the UK in 1975, but with the Patrick Grant and Gwen Guthrie single &quot;Love Don’t Go Through No Changes On Me&quot; (released in 1974), the siblings enjoyed their first success. The song was a big hit in Japan, and as a result, the girls were flown to the country to perform at the Tokyo Music Festival, where they won the Silver Prize. The sisters also performed at the Zaire 74 concert in Africa alongside James Brown during the Rumble in the Jungle boxing event.

Sister Sledge&#x27;s first album, &quot;Circle of Love&quot;, was released by ATCO (a subsidiary of Atlantic Records) in 1975, and included songs written by Gwen Guthrie and Gwen&#x27;s then-boyfriend, studio bassist Patrick Grant, who later changed his name to Haras Fyre. The group enjoyed some success in Europe, and as a result, the album &quot;Together&quot; was recorded in Germany in 1977. Released through the Cotillion label, another Atlantic subsidiary, the album produced a minor hit with the single &quot;Blockbuster Boy&quot; reaching number 61 on the US R&amp;B chart.

=== International breakthrough ===
At something of a crossroads in their careers, the future seemed a little uncertain for the group, but Atlantic Records connected them with producers Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards of the band Chic, and the situation changed. After some initial challenges to working collaboratively, the breakthrough album &quot;We Are Family&quot; was recorded and released by Cotillion on January 22, 1979. The lead single &quot;He’s the Greatest Dancer&quot; charted at number one R&amp;B and was a Top 10 Pop crossover smash, peaking at #9. In 1979, the record&#x27;s anthemic title track &quot;We Are Family&quot; followed and became a worldwide smash charting at number two pop and number one R&amp;B. The song and group were nominated for a Grammy Award and &quot;We Are Family&quot; was adopted as the official anthem for the Pittsburgh Pirates, who went on to win the World Series that year. Sister Sledge was duly invited to perform the national anthem at the opening game in front of 45,000 fans. Nile Rodgers credited the lasting influence of Sister Sledge on black music. 

The album was certified platinum by the RIAA and produced two more classic disco singles, &quot;Lost in Music&quot; and &quot;Thinking of You&quot;. Around this time, Debbie Sledge went on maternity leave and the eldest sister, Carol, filled in for her. They were named &quot;Billboard&quot; Best New Artists. In 1980, their follow-up album &quot;Love Somebody Today&quot; (also written and produced by Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards) was released. The lead single &quot;Love Somebody Today&quot; scored moderately well, charting at number six on the R&amp;B and number 64 on the pop charts. An extensive three-year live tour began and the quartet performed sold-out shows all over the world.

In 1981, Sister Sledge worked with Narada Michael Walden, who produced their fifth studio album, &quot;All American Girls&quot;. The project was intended as a collaboration, but the resulting album is generally attributed to Narada Michael Walden. The title track became a number-three R&amp;B hit, but the following singles &quot;Next Time You&#x27;ll Know&quot; and &quot;If You Really Want Me&quot; did only moderate business. As a tribute to the late Bob Marley, a reggae-influenced mix of the album&#x27;s fourth release &quot;He&#x27;s Just a Runaway&quot; was recorded at Radio City Music Hall in New York. The girls self-produced their next record &quot;The Sisters&quot; in 1982. The album spawned the number-14 R&amp;B and number-23 pop hit &quot;My Guy&quot; (a cover of the Mary Wells classic). The group subsequently appeared on the March 1984 episode of &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; entitled &quot;My Guy, George&quot;, in which they performed the song.

=== Continued European success ===
The album &quot;Bet Cha Say That to All the Girls&quot; was released in 1983, the lead single from which featured American Jazz singer Al Jarreau. The group experienced renewed success in 1984, when Atlantic Records belatedly released &quot;Thinking of You&quot; followed by a Nile Rodgers remix of &quot;Lost in Music&quot; in the UK, the latter peaking at number four. The following year, they released their seventh studio album &quot;When the Boys Meet the Girls&quot; and continued success in the UK. Released by Atlantic Records, lead single &quot;Frankie&quot; hit the top spot on the UK Singles Chart, spending four weeks at number one.

In 1989, Kathy began a solo career, while still active with Sister Sledge for certain shows. Debbie, Joni, and Kim continued to perform as Sister Sledge and in 1992 collaborated with Jean-Paul &quot;Bluey&quot; Maunick from UK acid jazz group Incognito on the single &quot;World Rise and Shine&quot;. The song featured on their greatest-hits album &quot;And Now…Sledge…Again&quot;. The single reached number one in Italy and resulted in the trio hosting their own TV show there. The group (including Kathy) experienced a resurgence of success in the UK the following year when the Sure as Pure remix of &quot;We Are Family&quot; was released and peaked at number five, followed by remixes of &quot;Lost in Music&quot; (number 14) and &quot;Thinking of You&quot; (number 17). A greatest-hits album, &quot;The Very Best of Sister Sledge 1973–93&quot;, was also released. In 1996, after witnessing a shooting in LA, Joni Sledge wrote the protest song &quot;Brother, Brother Stop&quot; that was recorded by the trio and featured on a new greatest-hits CD. In 1997, Joni produced the group&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;African Eyes&quot;, that garnered critical acclaim and was nominated for a Grammy as best-produced CD.

===2000–present===
In December 2000, Sister Sledge (Kathy, Debbie, Joni, and Kim) performed at the White House for the President and First Lady at the final Christmas party of the Clinton administration. The following year, in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, all four sisters re-recorded &quot;We Are Family&quot; as a benefit record with a host of other artists, including Diana Ross and Patti LaBelle. Debbie, Joni, and Kim produced solo material during this period before being reunited to record the album &quot;Style&quot; in 2003. Due to legal difficulties, the album remained unreleased. Kim, an ordained minister, took some time out from the group, but soon joined Kathy and Joni on various international shows. Joni and Debbie continued to tour (with various guest artists, including Debbie&#x27;s daughter Camille Sledge, completing a trio), and in 2005 performed on the famous pyramid stage at the Glastonbury Music Festival in the UK. In 2011, Sister Sledge came together on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; for the &quot;Women Who Rock&quot; episode. In the summer of 2012, Tanya Tiet was added to the lineup.

In 2014, Sister Sledge headlined at the Tramlines Festival in Sheffield, United Kingdom along with hip-hop icons, Public Enemy, and collaborated with Scottish electronic producer The Revenge, recording the track &quot;Stay a While&quot; in London. With Kim rejoining in 2015, all three sisters performed at a large-scale charity benefit in London for Save the Children and were invited to perform for Pope Francis along with Aretha Franklin and Andrea Bocelli at the World Festival of Families in Philadelphia at Eakins Oval on September 26, 2015, which was covered by global media and went viral due to crowds of nuns in the audience dancing to &quot;We Are Family&quot;. Debbie, Joni, and Kim soon thereafter launched the brand concept, Nothing is Greater Than Love.

Joni Sledge, born September 13, 1956, died of natural causes at her home in Phoenix, Arizona on March 10, 2017 at age 60. Following Joni&#x27;s death, Debbie and Kim announced that they will continue to perform as Sister Sledge. In 2019, Kim departed from the group and was replaced by Camille Sledge.
