<text>In molecular biology, molecular chaperones are proteins that assist the conformational folding or unfolding of large proteins or macromolecular protein complexes. There are a number of classes of molecular chaperones, all of which function to assist large proteins in proper protein folding during or after synthesis, and after partial denaturation. Chaperones are also involved in the translocation of proteins for proteolysis.

The first molecular chaperones discovered were a type of assembly chaperones which assist in the assembly of nucleosomes from folded histones and DNA. One major function of molecular chaperones is to prevent the aggregation of misfolded proteins, thus many chaperone proteins are classified as heat shock proteins, as the tendency for protein aggregation is increased by heat stress.

The majority of molecular chaperones do not convey any steric information for protein folding, and instead assist in protein folding by binding to and stabilizing folding intermediates until the polypeptide chain is fully translated. The specific mode of function of chaperones differs based on their target proteins and location. Various approaches have been applied to study the structure, dynamics and functioning of chaperones. Bulk biochemical measurements have informed us on the protein folding efficiency, and prevention of aggregation when chaperones are present during protein folding. Recent advances in single-molecule analysis have brought insights into structural heterogeneity of chaperones, folding intermediates and affinity of chaperones for unstructured and structured protein chains.

==Functions of molecular chaperones==
Many chaperones are heat shock proteins, that is, proteins expressed in response to elevated temperatures or other cellular stresses. Heat shock protein chaperones are classified based on their observed molecular weights into Hsp60, Hsp70, Hsp90, Hsp104, and small Hsps. The Hsp60 family of protein chaperones are termed chaperonins, and are characterized by a stacked double-ring structure and are found in prokaryotes, in the cytosol of eukaryotes, and in mitochondria.

Some chaperone systems work as foldases: they support the folding of proteins in an ATP-dependent manner (for example, the GroEL/GroES or the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system). Although most newly synthesized proteins can fold in absence of chaperones, a minority strictly requires them for the same. Other chaperones work as holdases: they bind folding intermediates to prevent their aggregation, for example DnaJ or Hsp33.
Chaperones can also work as disaggregases, which interact with aberrant protein assemblies and revert them to monomers. Some chaperones can assist in protein degradation, leading proteins to protease systems, such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system in eukaryotes. Chaperone proteins participate in the folding of over half of all mammalian proteins.

Macromolecular crowding may be important in chaperone function. The crowded environment of the cytosol can accelerate the folding process, since a compact folded protein will occupy less volume than an unfolded protein chain. However, crowding can reduce the yield of correctly folded protein by increasing protein aggregation. Crowding may also increase the effectiveness of the chaperone proteins such as GroEL, which could counteract this reduction in folding efficiency. Some highly specific &#x27;steric chaperones&#x27; convey unique structural information onto proteins, which cannot be folded spontaneously. Such proteins violate Anfinsen&#x27;s dogma, requiring protein dynamics to fold correctly.

Other types of chaperones are involved in transport across membranes, for example membranes of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotes. A bacterial translocation-specific chaperone SecB maintains newly synthesized precursor polypeptide chains in a translocation-competent (generally unfolded) state and guides them to the translocon.

New functions for chaperones continue to be discovered, such as bacterial adhesin activity, induction of aggregation towards non-amyloid aggregates, suppression of toxic protein oligomers via their clustering, and in responding to diseases linked to protein aggregation and cancer maintenance.

==Human chaperone proteins==
In human cell lines, chaperone proteins were found to compose ~10% of the gross proteome mass, and are ubiquitously and highly expressed across human tissues.

Chaperones are found extensively in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), since protein synthesis often occurs in this area.

===Endoplasmic reticulum===
In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) there are general, lectin- and non-classical molecular chaperones that moderate protein folding.
*General chaperones: GRP78/BiP, GRP94, GRP170.
*Lectin chaperones: calnexin and calreticulin
*Non-classical molecular chaperones: HSP47 and ERp29
*Folding chaperones:
**Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI),
**&quot;Peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase&quot; (PPI), Prolyl isomerase
**ERp57

== Nomenclature and examples of chaperone families ==
There are many different families of chaperones; each family acts to aid protein folding in a different way. In bacteria like &quot;E. coli&quot;, many of these proteins are highly expressed under conditions of high stress, for example, when the bacterium is placed in high temperatures, thus heat shock protein chaperones are the most extensive.

A variety of nomenclatures are in use for chaperones. As heat shock proteins, the names are classically formed by &quot;Hsp&quot; followed by the approximate molecular mass in kilodaltons; such names are commonly used for eukaryotes such as yeast. The bacterial names have more varied forms, and refer directly to their apparent function at discovery. For example, &quot;GroEL&quot; originally stands for &quot;phage growth defect, overcome by mutation in phage gene E, large subunit&quot;.

=== Hsp10 and Hsp60 ===

Hsp10/60 (GroEL/GroES complex in &quot;E. coli&quot;) is the best characterized large (~ 1 MDa) chaperone complex. GroEL (Hsp60) is a double-ring 14mer with a hydrophobic patch at its opening; it is so large it can accommodate native folding of 54-kDa GFP in its lumen. GroES (Hsp10) is a single-ring heptamer that binds to GroEL in the presence of ATP or ADP. GroEL/GroES may not be able to undo previous aggregation, but it does compete in the pathway of misfolding and aggregation. Also acts in the mitochondrial matrix as a molecular chaperone.

===Hsp70 and Hsp40===
Hsp70 (DnaK in &quot;E. coli&quot;) is perhaps the best characterized small (~ 70 kDa) chaperone. The Hsp70 proteins are aided by Hsp40 proteins (DnaJ in &quot;E. coli&quot;), which increase the ATP consumption rate and activity of the Hsp70s. The two proteins are named &quot;Dna&quot; in bacteria because they were initially identified as being required for &quot;E. coli&quot; DNA replication.

It has been noted that increased expression of Hsp70 proteins in the cell results in a decreased tendency toward apoptosis. Although a precise mechanistic understanding has yet to be determined, it is known that Hsp70s have a high-affinity bound state to unfolded proteins when bound to ADP, and a low-affinity state when bound to ATP.

It is thought that many Hsp70s crowd around an unfolded substrate, stabilizing it and preventing aggregation until the unfolded molecule folds properly, at which time the Hsp70s lose affinity for the molecule and diffuse away. Hsp70 also acts as a mitochondrial and chloroplastic molecular chaperone in eukaryotes.

=== Hsp90 ===

Hsp90 (HtpG in &quot;E. coli&quot;) may be the least understood chaperone. Its molecular weight is about 90 kDa, and it is necessary for viability in eukaryotes (possibly for prokaryotes as well). Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone essential for activating many signaling proteins in the eukaryotic cell.

Each Hsp90 has an ATP-binding domain, a middle domain, and a dimerization domain. Originally thought to clamp onto their substrate protein (also known as a client protein) upon binding ATP, the recently published structures by Vaughan &quot;et al.&quot; and Ali &quot;et al.&quot; indicate that client proteins may bind externally to both the N-terminal and middle domains of Hsp90.

Hsp90 may also require co-chaperones-like immunophilins, Sti1, p50 (Cdc37), and Aha1, and also cooperates with the Hsp70 chaperone system.

=== Hsp100 ===

Hsp100 (Clp family in &quot;E. coli&quot;) proteins have been studied &quot;in vivo&quot; and &quot;in vitro&quot; for their ability to target and unfold tagged and misfolded proteins.

Proteins in the Hsp100/Clp family form large hexameric structures with unfoldase activity in the presence of ATP. These proteins are thought to function as chaperones by processively threading client proteins through a small 20 Å (2 nm) pore, thereby giving each client protein a second chance to fold.

Some of these Hsp100 chaperones, like ClpA and ClpX, associate with the double-ringed tetradecameric serine protease ClpP; instead of catalyzing the refolding of client proteins, these complexes are responsible for the targeted destruction of tagged and misfolded proteins.

Hsp104, the Hsp100 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is essential for the propagation of many yeast prions. Deletion of the HSP104 gene results in cells that are unable to propagate certain prions.

==Bacteriophage==

The genes of bacteriophage (phage) T4 that encode proteins with a role in determining phage T4 structure were identified using conditional lethal mutants. Most of these proteins proved to be either major or minor structural components of the completed phage particle. However among the gene products (gps) necessary for phage assembly, Snustad identified a group of gps that act catalytically rather than being incorporated themselves into the phage structure. These gps were gp26, gp31, gp38, gp51, gp28, and gp4 [gene 4 is synonymous with genes 50 and 65, and thus the gp can be designated gp4(50)(65)]. The first four of these six gene products have since been recognized as being chaperone proteins. Additionally, gp40, gp57A, gp63 and gpwac have also now been identified as chaperones.

Phage T4 morphogenesis is divided into three independent pathways: the head, the tail and the long tail fiber pathways as detailed by Yap and Rossman. With regard to head morphogenesis, chaperone gp31 interacts with the bacterial host chaperone GroEL to promote proper folding of the major head capsid protein gp23. Chaperone gp40 participates in the assembly of gp20, thus aiding in the formation of the connector complex that initiates head procapsid assembly. Gp4(50)(65), although not specifically listed as a chaperone, acts catalytically as a nuclease that appears to be essential for morphogenesis by cleaving packaged DNA to enable the joining of heads to tails.

During overall tail assembly, chaperone proteins gp26 and gp51 are necessary for baseplate hub assembly. Gp57A is required for correct folding of gp12, a structural component of the baseplate short tail fibers.

Synthesis of the long tail fibers depends on the chaperone protein gp57A that is needed for the trimerization of gp34 and gp37, the major structural proteins of the tail fibers. The chaperone protein gp38 is also required for the proper folding of gp37. Chaperone proteins gp63 and gpwac are employed in attachment of the long tail fibers to the tail baseplate.

==History==
The investigation of chaperones has a long history. The term &quot;molecular chaperone&quot; appeared first in the literature in 1978, and was invented by Ron Laskey to describe the ability of a nuclear protein called nucleoplasmin to prevent the aggregation of folded histone proteins with DNA during the assembly of nucleosomes. The term was later extended by R. John Ellis in 1987 to describe proteins that mediated the post-translational assembly of protein complexes. In 1988, it was realised that similar proteins mediated this process in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The details of this process were determined in 1989, when the ATP-dependent protein folding was demonstrated &quot;in vitro&quot;.

== Clinical significance ==
There are many disorders associated with mutations in genes encoding chaperones (i.e. multisystem proteinopathy) that can affect muscle, bone and/or the central nervous system.

<text>Dame Gladys Constance Cooper (18 December 1888 – 17 November 1971) was an English actress, theatrical manager and producer, whose career spanned seven decades on stage, in films and on television.

Beginning as a teenager in Edwardian musical comedy and pantomime, she starred in dramatic roles and silent films before the First World War. She managed the Playhouse Theatre from 1917 to 1934, where she starred in many roles. From the early 1920s Cooper won praise in plays by W. Somerset Maugham and others.

In the 1930s she starred steadily in productions both in London&#x27;s West End and on Broadway. Moving to Hollywood in 1940, Cooper found success in a variety of character roles. She received three Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress, for performances in &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot; (1943), &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1964) and, most famously, &quot;Now, Voyager&quot; (1942). Throughout the 1950s and 1960s she worked both on stage and on screen, continuing to star on stage until her last year.

==Early life and career==

Cooper was born at 23 Ennersdale Road, Hither Green, Lewisham, London, the eldest of the three daughters of Charles William Frederick Cooper (1844–1939) and Mabel (Barnett) Cooper (1861–1944). Her two younger sisters were Doris Mabel (1891–1987) and Grace Muriel (1893–1982). Writer Henry St. John Cooper was a half-brother. Cooper spent most of her childhood in Chiswick, where her family moved when she was an infant.

She made her stage debut in 1905 touring with Seymour Hicks in his musical &quot;Bluebell in Fairyland&quot; and was becoming a popular photographic model. In 1906, she appeared as Lady Swan in London in &quot;The Belle of Mayfair&quot; and then in the pantomime &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot; as Mavis. The following year she became a chorus girl at the Gaiety Theatre, creating the small role of Eva in &quot;The Girls of Gottenberg&quot;. That Christmas, she was again in &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot;, this time playing Molly. In 1908, she appeared in the musical &quot;Havana&quot; followed, the next year, by &quot;Our Miss Gibbs&quot;, in which she played Lady Connie; she was then on tour again with Hicks, in &quot;Papa&#x27;s Wife&quot;, before playing Sadie von Tromp in the operetta &quot;The Dollar Princess&quot; at Daly&#x27;s Theatre in 1909. In 1911, she appeared in a production of &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; and in &quot;Man and Superman&quot;. Among several other plays, the next year she was Muriel Pym in &quot;Milestones&quot; at the Royalty Theatre. A highlight of 1913 was Dora in &quot;Diplomacy&quot; at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre. That year she also played the title role in &quot;The Pursuit of Pamela&quot; at the Royalty.
In 1913 Cooper appeared in her first film, &quot;The Eleventh Commandment&quot;, going on to make several more silent films during the First World War and shortly afterwards. She continued full-time stage work, however, including appearances as Lady Agatha Lazenby in &quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot; in 1916 and Clara de Foenix in &quot;Trelawny of the Wells&quot;. In addition, in 1917, Cooper became co-manager, with Frank Curzon, of the Playhouse Theatre, taking over sole control from 1927 until she left in 1933. During these years, she starred several times in &quot;My Lady&#x27;s Dress&quot;. She appeared in W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s &quot;Home and Beauty&quot; in 1919, repeated Dora at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in 1920 and elsewhere thereafter, and both produced and played numerous roles at the Playhouse Theatre.

It was not until 1922, however, then in her mid-thirties, that she found major critical success, in Arthur Wing Pinero&#x27;s &quot;The Second Mrs. Tanqueray&quot;. Early in her stage career, she was criticised for being too stiff. Aldous Huxley dismissed her performance in &quot;Home and Beauty&quot;, writing &quot;she is too impassive, too statuesque, playing all the time as if she were Galatea, newly unpetrified and still unused to the ways of the living world.&quot; Evidently, her acting improved during this period, as Maugham praised her for &quot;turning herself from an indifferent actress to an extremely competent one&quot; through her common sense and industriousness. For both the 1923 and 1924 Christmas shows at the Adelphi Theatre, Cooper played the title character in &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, while also playing several other roles at that theatre during those two years. She appeared in Maugham&#x27;s &quot;The Letter&quot; in London and on tour in 1927 and 1928, in &quot;Excelsior&quot; (adapted from &quot;L&#x27;Ecole des Cocottes&quot; by H.M. Harwood) in 1928, and in Maugham&#x27;s &quot;The Sacred Flame&quot; in 1929, also in London and on tour.

Among other roles, Cooper was Clemency Warlock in &quot;Cynara&quot; (1930), Wanda Heriot in &quot;The Pelican&quot; (1931), Lucy Haydon in &quot;Dr Pygmalion&quot; (1932), Carola in &quot;The Firebird&quot; (1932), Jane Claydon in &quot;The Rats of Norway&quot; (1933), Mariella Linden in &quot;The Shining Hour&quot; in 1934 and 1935, in London and New York City and on tour (at the same time making her first &quot;talkie&quot; film, &quot;The Iron Duke&quot;), also playing Desdemona and Lady Macbeth on Broadway in 1935. She was Dorothy Hilton in &quot;Call it a Day&quot;, again in both London and New York, from 1935 to 1936. A highlight of 1937 was Laura Lorimer in &quot;Goodbye to Yesterday&quot; in London and on tour. In 1938, she played Tiny Fox-Collier in &quot;Spring Meeting&quot; in New York, Montreal and Britain, as well as several Shakespeare roles and Fran Dodsworth in &quot;Dodsworth&quot;. She repeated &quot;Spring Meeting&quot; in 1939.

==Later career==

Cooper turned to film full-time in 1940, finding success in Hollywood in a variety of character roles and was frequently cast as a disapproving, aristocratic society woman, although she sometimes played lively, approachable types, as she did in &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1940). She was nominated three times for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performances as Bette Davis&#x27;s domineering mother in &quot;Now, Voyager&quot; (1942), a sceptical nun in &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot; (1943), and Rex Harrison&#x27;s mother, Mrs. Higgins, in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1964). In 1945, after playing the role of Clarissa Scott in the film &quot;The Valley of Decision&quot;, for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer she was given a contract with the studio. Her credits there included both dramatic and comedy films, including &quot;The Green Years&quot; (1946), &quot;The Cockeyed Miracle&quot; (1946) and &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; (1949). Other notable film roles were &quot;The Man Who Loved Redheads&quot; (1955), &quot;Separate Tables&quot; (1958) and &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot; (1967) as Aunt Mary Drexel, singing &quot;There Are Those&quot;.

Her only stage roles in the 1940s were Mrs. Parrilow in &quot;The Morning Star&quot; in Philadelphia and New York (1942) and Melanie Aspen in &quot;The Indifferent Shepherd&quot; in Britain (1948). She returned to theatre (between films) more often in the 1950s and 1960s, playing in London and on tour in such roles as Edith Fenton in &quot;The Hat Trick&quot; (1950); Felicity, Countess of Marshwood, in &quot;Relative Values&quot; (1951 and 1953); Grace Smith in &quot;A Question of Fact&quot; (1953); Lady Yarmouth in &quot;The Night of the Ball&quot; (1954); Mrs. St. Maugham in &quot;The Chalk Garden&quot; (1955–56), Dame Mildred in &quot;The Bright One&quot; (1958); Mrs. Vincent in &quot;Look on Tempests&quot; (1960); Mrs. Gantry (Bobby) in &quot;The Bird of Time&quot; (1961); Mrs. Moore in a stage adaptation of &quot;A Passage to India&quot; (1962); Mrs Tabret in &quot;The Sacred Flame&quot; (1966 and 1967); Prue Salter in &quot;Let&#x27;s All Go Down the Strand&quot; (1967); Emma Littlewood in &quot;Out of the Question&quot; (1968); Lydia in &quot;His, Hers and Theirs&quot; (1969); and others. She received two nominations for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play, for her roles in &quot;The Chalk Garden&quot; and &quot;A Passage to India&quot;.
She also had various television roles in the 1950s and &#x27;60s. These included, among others, three episodes of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;: &quot;Nothing in the Dark&quot; (1962), &quot;Passage on the Lady Anne&quot; (1963) and &quot;Night Call&quot; (1964). Cooper starred in the 1964–65 series &quot;The Rogues&quot; with David Niven, Charles Boyer, Gig Young, Robert Coote, John Williams and Larry Hagman. The series lasted a single season of thirty episodes, most of which featured Cooper as the matriarch of an ethical family of con artists who only prey on criminals.

In 1967, at the age of 79, she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE). Her last major success on the stage was at age 82, in 1970–71 in the role of Mrs. St. Maugham in Enid Bagnold&#x27;s &quot;The Chalk Garden&quot;, a role she had created on Broadway and in the West End in 1955–56.

Her final public appearance was on the 5 May 1971 episode of &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, on which she guested with her son-in-law Robert Morley in London. On the day following Cooper&#x27;s death, her &quot;Now, Voyager&quot; co-star Bette Davis appeared on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; and called Cooper &quot;Without a doubt, the most beautiful person as well as actress, and a professional ... never was she late one minute, never didn&#x27;t she know every line.&quot;

==Personal life==

Cooper was married three times.
* Captain Herbert Buckmaster (1908–1921). The couple had two children: Joan (1910–2005), who married the actor Robert Morley, and John R. Buckmaster (1915–1983).
* Sir Neville Pearson (1927–1936). Sir Neville and Lady Pearson had one daughter, Sally Pearson, aka Sally Cooper, who was married to the actor Robert Hardy from 1961 to 1986.
* Philip Merivale (1937–1946), a fellow actor. The couple lived for many years in Santa Monica, California as permanent resident aliens. He died at age 59 from a heart ailment. Her stepson from this marriage was John Merivale.

Cooper published a self-titled autobiography in 1931. She lived mostly in England in her final years and died from pneumonia in 1971 at the age of 82 in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.

<doc id="167634" wikidata="Q712073" url="?curid=167634" title="Arthur Wing Pinero">
<text>Sir Arthur Wing Pinero (24 May 185523 November 1934) was an English playwright and, early in his career, actor.

Pinero was drawn to the theatre from an early age, and became a professional actor at the age of 19. He gained experience as a supporting actor in British provincial theatres, and from 1876 to 1881 was a member of Henry Irving&#x27;s company, based at the Lyceum Theatre, London.

Pinero wrote his first play in 1877. Seven years later, having written 15 more, three of them highly successful, he abandoned acting and became a full-time playwright. He first became known for a series of farces, of which &quot;The Magistrate&quot; (1885) was the longest-running. During the 1890s he turned to serious subjects. &quot;The Second Mrs Tanqueray&quot; (1893), dealing with a woman with a scandalous past, was regarded as shocking, but ran well and made a large profit. His other successes included &quot;Trelawny of the &quot;Wells&quot;&quot; (1898), a romantic comedy celebrating the theatre, old and new, and &quot;The Gay Lord Quex&quot;, about a reformed roué and a feisty young woman. A venture into opera, with a libretto for &quot;The Beauty Stone&quot; (1898), was not a success, and Pinero thereafter generally stuck to his familiar genre of society dramas and comedies.

Although he continued to write throughout the first three decades of the 20th century and into the fourth, it is Pinero&#x27;s work from the 1880s and 1890s that has endured. There have been numerous revivals of many of his plays; and some have been adapted for the cinema or as musicals. By his later years, Pinero was seen as old-fashioned, and his last plays were not successful. He died in London at the age of 79.

==Life and career==
===Early years===

Pinero was born in London, the only son, and second of three children, of John Daniel Pinero (1798–1871), and his wife Lucy, &quot;née&quot; Daines (1836–1905). Pinero&#x27;s father and grandfather were London solicitors. They were descended from the Pinheiro family, described by Pinero&#x27;s biographer John Dawick as &quot;a distinguished family of Sephardic Jews who rose to prominence in medieval Portugal before suffering the persecutions of the Inquisition&quot;. Pinero&#x27;s branch of the family fled to England. His grandfather abandoned the Jewish faith, became a member of the Church of England, married a Christian Englishwoman, Margaret Wing, and became a highly successful lawyer. His younger son, Pinero&#x27;s father, also took up the legal profession, but was much less successful; Pinero was brought up in circumstances that were not poor but were not affluent. He attended Spa Fields Chapel charity school in Exmouth Street, Clerkenwell, London, until the age of ten, when he went to work in his father&#x27;s office.

John Daniel Pinero died in May 1871, leaving very little money. To contribute to the family income, Pinero continued to work as a solicitor&#x27;s clerk, earning £1 a week. In the evenings he studied elocution at the Birkbeck Literary and Scientific Institution. He and his fellow students staged several productions of plays, and Pinero became irresistibly drawn to the theatre. In May 1874 he abandoned the legal profession and joined R. H. Wyndham at the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh, as a &quot;general utility&quot; actor. He made his professional debut in the small role of a groom in an adaptation of Wilkie Collins&#x27;s &quot;The Woman in White&quot;.

===Actor and rising playwright: 1874–1884===

As a junior member of Wyndham&#x27;s company Pinero quickly gained experience in a range of roles, supporting E. A. Sothern in &quot;Our American Cousin&quot;, and Charles Mathews in the Balzac adaptation &quot;A Game of Speculation&quot;, and graduating to larger parts such as Crosstree in &quot;Black-Eyed Susan&quot;. His engagement in Edinburgh came to a sudden end in February 1875 when the theatre was destroyed by fire. He was fortunate in being offered another provincial engagement, at the Royal Alexandra Theatre, Liverpool, where he began to be noticed by the press, gaining approving reviews for his acting in supporting roles. A production of &quot;Miss Gwilt&quot;, an adaptation of Wilkie Collins&#x27;s &quot;Armadale&quot;, starring Ada Cavendish, was reported by the theatrical paper &quot;The Era&quot; as &quot;a genuine triumph&quot;; the play transferred from Liverpool to the West End, and Pinero retained his role as an elderly solicitor. The production was not the hoped-for success in London, but Pinero received good notices for his performance, and when the run finished after ten weeks he was immediately engaged by Henry Irving&#x27;s manager, Mrs Bateman, as a member of the supporting cast for Irving&#x27;s forthcoming provincial tour.

Although the tour was uncongenial, and Pinero gathered some highly critical notices, he continued to work as a supporting actor to Irving for five years. He first appeared at the Lyceum, Irving&#x27;s London base, in December 1876 and played a total of 21 parts there between then and 1881. His Shakespearean roles were Lord Stanley in &quot;Richard III&quot; (1877), Rosencrantz in &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1878), Guildenstern in &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1879), Salarino in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; (1879), and Roderigo in &quot;Othello&quot; (1881). In a revival of the melodrama &quot;The Bells&quot;, with which Irving&#x27;s name was already synonymous, he played Dr Zimmer (1878).

While in Irving&#x27;s company Pinero wrote his first plays. He began with &quot;£200 a Year&quot;, a one-act comedy written in a single afternoon for a colleague to present at a benefit performance in 1877. The play was well received and was given several further performances, bringing Pinero&#x27;s name a modest amount of publicity. His first full-length play, &quot;La Comète&quot;, was staged in a theatre in Croydon in 1878, and he wrote four more one-act comedies, staged in London in 1878–1880, playing in two of them – &quot;Daisy&#x27;s Escape&quot; and &quot;Bygones&quot; – at the Lyceum. Another of these, &quot;Hester&#x27;s Mystery&quot; (1880), written for the comic actor J. L. Toole, ran for 300 performances at the Folly Theatre.
Pinero&#x27;s profile as a playwright was further raised by &quot;The Money Spinner&quot;, a full-length comedy, first given at the Prince&#x27;s Theatre, Manchester in November 1880 and then at the St James&#x27;s in London in January 1881. The theatre historian J. P. Wearing regards the play as of particular importance in the history of the St James&#x27;s, a theatre previously known more for its failures than its successes. Pinero&#x27;s play was regarded as daringly unconventional and a risky venture, but it caught on with the public, particularly for the character Baron Croodle, a &quot;disreputable but delightful old reprobate and card-shark&quot; played by John Hare. The following year Pinero wrote the first of eleven more plays for the St James&#x27;s, &quot;The Squire&quot; (1881). It caused controversy by its supposed similarity to Thomas Hardy&#x27;s &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot;.

After leaving Irving&#x27;s company Pinero joined another well-known London management, Squire Bancroft and his wife Effie, who ran the Haymarket Theatre. For them he played the Marquis de Cevennes (&quot;Plot and Passion&quot;, 1881), Sir Alexander Shendryn (&quot;Ours&quot;, 1882), Hanway (&quot;Odette&quot;, 1882) and finally Sir Anthony Absolute in &quot;The Rivals&quot; (1884) as part of a starry cast that included Squire Bancroft, Johnston Forbes-Robertson, Lionel Brough and Julia Gwynne. Pinero received mixed notices, some unfavourable, and others among the best of his acting career. This was his last professional engagement as an actor.

During his time at the Haymarket Pinero married Myra Emily Wood (c. 1852–1919), who had acted under the stage name of Myra Holme, a widow with two children, Angus and Myra, from her first marriage. The wedding took place on 19 April 1883. There were no children of the marriage to Pinero.

===Farces and drawing-room comedies: 1884–1893===

With the exception of two adaptations of serious French works, &quot;The Ironmaster&quot; (1884) and &quot;Mayfair&quot; (1885), Pinero&#x27;s output between 1884 and 1893 consisted of six farces and five comedies. During this period he became particularly associated with the Court Theatre, where five of his farces were presented, with great success at the box office, between 1885 and 1892, beginning with &quot;The Magistrate&quot;. Wearing writes that in these plays Pinero &quot;attacked facets of Victorian society by creating credible though blinkered characters, trying to preserve their respectability while trapped in a relentless whirlpool of catastrophically illogical events&quot;.

Pinero told an interviewer that with the first of his Court farces, &quot;The Magistrate&quot;, he had tried &quot;to raise farce a little from the low pantomime level&quot;. Instead of relying on the Parisian stereotype, revolving around potentially adulterous liaisons, he tried to create believable characters in credible situations. The piece played for 363 performances in its first run, the first play in the history of the Court to run for more than a year. When its star, Arthur Cecil, required a summer break, Beerbohm Tree deputised for him for three weeks. Three touring companies were needed to meet the demand for the play in the British provinces, and local managements in Australia, India and South Africa were licensed to stage it; Pinero travelled to New York for the American premiere, at Daly&#x27;s Theatre in October 1885. He had turned 30 earlier that year. A retrospective review of his career published in 1928 pointed out that Pinero – who had recently celebrated 50 years as a West End playwright – achieved fame at an unusually early age: his contemporaries Bernard Shaw, J. M. Barrie and John Galsworthy were all in their thirties before their plays were produced in London.

Pinero&#x27;s other Court farces – &quot;The Schoolmistress&quot; (1886), &quot;Dandy Dick&quot; (1887), &quot;The Cabinet Minister&quot; (1890) and &quot;The Amazons&quot; (1893) – ran for 291, 262, 199 and 114 performances respectively, an aggregate of 866. Their success was outstripped by that of the gentler comedy &quot;Sweet Lavender&quot;, which ran at Terry&#x27;s Theatre for 684 performances from March 1888 to January 1890. This piece concerns an impoverished clerk, a bibulous but wise barrister, fraudulent bankers, a long-lost sweetheart and happy endings all round. It was billed as &quot;a domestic drama&quot;, and was mainly comic, but, &quot;The Era&quot; reported, &quot;there are scenes where the laughter is hushed, where smiles give way to tears, and where mirth is merged in heartfelt sympathy&quot;.

===Serious plays===
Plays in a similar vein to &quot;Sweet Lavender&quot; – &quot;The Weaker Sex&quot; (1888) and &quot;Lady Bountiful&quot; (1891) – did not match its success, running for 61 and 65 performances respectively. Nonetheless Pinero&#x27;s attention continued to turn more to serious than to farcical topics. Wearing comments that Pinero began to write &quot;problem plays&quot;, considering &quot;the double standard of morality, applied unequally to men and women&quot;. His first was &quot;The Profligate&quot; (1889), in which past misdeeds come to haunt a seemingly respectable man. It was chosen to inaugurate the new Garrick Theatre, but the lessee, John Hare, persuaded a reluctant Pinero to tone down the ending to avoid alienating his respectable society audience: in the final version the protagonist does not kill himself, as Pinero had written, but is forgiven by his wife. The play ran for 129 performances.

When his next such drama came to be produced Pinero remained firm: the play would, and did, end in tragedy. This was his best-known serious work, &quot;The Second Mrs Tanqueray&quot; (1893). While he was planning it, several plays of Henrik Ibsen were presented in London for the first time, regarded by much of polite society as &quot;avant garde&quot;, blunt and shocking. Seeing &quot;Ghosts&quot; led Pinero to reconsider his approach to playwriting, which now seemed old-fashioned by comparison. He was far from uncritical of Ibsen&#x27;s plays, but recognised that if he was to be a serious dramatist he must treat social problems and human misconduct frankly.

&quot;The Second Mrs Tanqueray&quot; centred on &quot;a woman with a past&quot;. Hare declined to present it, and George Alexander, the actor-manager running the St James&#x27;s Theatre, to whom Pinero then offered the play, said, &quot;Sorry, I daren&#x27;t do it&quot;. He had second thoughts, and accepted it. The production was scheduled to replace Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot;, which also focused on a woman with a far from respectable past. Unlike Pinero&#x27;s play, Wilde&#x27;s ended happily, and was seen by the respectable habitués of the St James&#x27;s as mildly shocking but acceptable. In Pinero&#x27;s play Paula Tanqueray kills herself. In Wearing&#x27;s words, &quot;although not as avant-garde as Ibsen&#x27;s plays, Tanqueray confronted its fashionable St James&#x27;s audiences with as forceful a social message as they could stomach&quot;. Both Pinero and Alexander were apprehensive about the public reception of the piece, but it was a sensational success at its opening in May 1893, made a profit of more than £10,000, and was still playing to full houses when Alexander, who disliked acting in long runs, closed the production in April 1894 after 225 performances.

Wearing comments that the public&#x27;s appetite for similar Pinero plays varied. &quot;The Notorious Mrs Ebbsmith&quot; (1895) managed a run of 88 performances, &quot;The Benefit of the Doubt&quot; (1895) ran for 74, &quot;The Thunderbolt&quot; (1908) and &quot;Mid-Channel&quot; (1909) both ran for 58.

===Fin de siècle===
The year 1898 saw one of Pinero&#x27;s most enduring successes and his most conspicuous failure. The first was &quot;Trelawny of the &quot;Wells&quot;&quot;, the second, &quot;The Beauty Stone&quot;. In &quot;Trelawny of the &quot;Wells&quot;&quot;, described by a 21st-century critic as &quot;Pinero&#x27;s love letter to theatre&quot;, the author addressed his regular topics of class and inexorable change, to which he added a study of the enduring power of the theatre. The play shows a popular actress in mid-Victorian melodramas marrying into the aristocracy, regretting it, returning to the stage and finding that she can no longer make the old style of plays work, successfully switching to works in the new realistic style. Wearing calls the play Pinero&#x27;s homage to Tom Robertson, whose pioneering theatrical realism influenced two generations of writers including W. S. Gilbert and Bernard Shaw as well as Pinero. The critics were confused by the play. Pinero commented that they seemed &quot;divided as to whether the piece is a weak farce or an imperfect realistic drama&quot;. It had a good, though not outstanding, run of 135 performances at the Court, but subsequently became one of Pinero&#x27;s most revived plays.

At the same time the impresario Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte was in need of a new opera for his Savoy Theatre after the end of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s long partnership. It is not clear why Carte chose to commission a libretto from two writers with no experience in the genre, but for Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Beauty Stone&quot; he brought together Pinero and J. Comyns Carr, an art critic, gallery owner and part-time author of dramas. Sullivan, who was used to Gilbert&#x27;s skill and flexibility, quickly found his new collaborators inept: &quot;gifted and brilliant men, with &quot;no&quot; experience in writing for music, and yet obstinately refusing to accept any suggestions from me as to form and construction&quot;. He later wrote in his diary, &quot;heartbreaking to have to try to make a musical piece out of such badly constructed (for music) mess of involved sentences&quot;. The musical analyst William Parry describes the libretto as &quot;a verbose mess ... suffused with a fussy air of arch medievalism&quot;. At its premiere, on 28 May 1898, the piece ran for four hours, and Pinero and Carr had to accept some drastic cuts to their words, which also meant sacrificing some of Sullivan&#x27;s best music. The reviews for the music ranged from polite to enthusiastic; for the libretto they ranged from polite to damning. Max Beerbohm, who had succeeded Shaw as theatre critic of &quot;The Saturday Review&quot; and who was to become a persistent irritant to Pinero, was particularly waspish. Besides the shortcomings of the libretto, the uncomic, romantic style of the piece was not in keeping with the traditions of the Savoy or the expectations of its audience, and the opera closed on 16 July after 50 performances – the worst run for any of Sullivan&#x27;s operas.

Within a year of the disappointment of &quot;The Beauty Stone&quot; Pinero returned to successful form with a four-act play &quot;The Gay Lord Quex&quot;, a comedy of manners, in succession to two others in the genre, &quot;The Times&quot; (1891) and &quot;The Princess and the Butterfly&quot; (1897). &quot;The Gay Lord Quex&quot;, a story of a determined and resourceful young woman and a reformed aristocratic philanderer, had an initial run of 300 performances, and has proved one of Pinero&#x27;s more revivable plays.

===20th century===

In the first decade of the century Pinero continued to be regarded as among the forefront of British playwrights. His comedy of manners &quot;Iris&quot; (1901) ran for 115 performances, and in 1906 he had one of his biggest successes, with &quot;His House in Order&quot;, another work for Alexander and the St James&#x27;s. This piece is a drama about a put-upon second wife who eventually triumphs over the domineering family of her husband&#x27;s dead first wife and wins his undivided love. It was a triumph for Irene Vanbrugh and Alexander in the lead roles, and for Pinero; it ran for 430 performances and took more than £78,000 at the box-office. The alliance between Alexander had by now become a firm friendship, punctuated by occasional arguments between the actor-manager and the author, who became extremely prescriptive about the staging of his plays and the delivery of his lines.

Another of Pinero&#x27;s friends was Shaw. As authors they held very different views of the nature and purpose of drama. Although both addressed social problems in their plays, Shaw, who held that all good art is didactic, concentrated on the problem itself, whereas Pinero focused more on the people affected by it, which Shaw felt weakened the argument. Nevertheless, they were on good terms and both were prominent in campaigns for a national theatre and the reform or abolition of theatre censorship. Shaw conceived the idea that playwrights needed a titled figure to lead their campaigns, and lobbied the British government to secure a knighthood for Pinero. Whether because of Shaw&#x27;s canvassing or not is unknown, but Pinero was knighted in 1909, only the second dramatist to receive the honour (Gilbert having been knighted two years earlier). Pinero rarely used the title, but shortened his signature from &quot;Arthur W. Pinero&quot; to &quot;Arthur Pinero&quot;.
In the second decade of the century Pinero had his last two real successes. The comedy &quot;The &quot;Mind the Paint&quot; Girl&quot; ran at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre for 126 performances in 1912, and &quot;The Big Drum&quot;, his last play for Alexander had 111 performances at the St James&#x27;s in 1915. The First World War badly affected his wish and ability to write. He had suffered an emotional blow in 1913 when his stepson killed himself, and the outbreak of war the following year appalled Pinero. Following the sinking of by a German U-boat on 7 May 1915, he wrote to &quot;The Times&quot; calling on naturalised British citizens of German origin to make public statements of their loyalty to the King and reject Germany&#x27;s methods of warfare. In the following days, numerous letters were received by the newspaper from naturalised Britons affirming their loyalty, including public figures such as Sir Ernest Cassel, Sir George Henschel, Sir Carl Meyer and Sir Felix Schuster. Among others who came under public pressure because of the war was Shaw, who opposed it strenuously, and was much vilified by the public and even by his colleagues. Pinero refused to join in the chorus of disapproval, and his friendship with Shaw endured, although they saw less of each other after Shaw resigned from the Dramatists&#x27; Club under pressure from its pro-war members led by Henry Arthur Jones.

Pinero&#x27;s wife died in 1919, having been an invalid for some time. Although her death was foreseen it caused Pinero deep distress, and after it he was often despondent, despite the devoted attention of his stepdaughter. During the last years of his life Pinero gradually ceased to be a figure of importance in the theatre. After the end of the war he wrote eight more plays; two of them remained unstaged and of the four that were produced in London the longest-running lasted for 64 performances.

His heart weakened by a serious bout of influenza, Pinero failed to survive an operation for a hernia. He died on 23 November 1934 in Marylebone Nursing Home. A memorial service was held at St Marylebone Parish Church on 28 November 1934, after which, by Pinero&#x27;s request, his ashes were buried in his wife&#x27;s grave in the churchyard of Chiddingfold, Surrey, close to their former country house.

::Source: Dawick.
In 2012 &quot;The Times&quot; remarked on a revival in interest in Pinero, with new productions of &quot;The Second Mrs Tanqueray&quot; at the Rose Theatre, &quot;The Magistrate&quot; at the National Theatre, starring John Lithgow in the title role, &quot;Trelawney of the &quot;Wells&quot;&quot; at the Donmar, and &quot;Dandy Dick&quot;, with Patricia Hodge and Nicholas Le Prevost. The paper commented, &quot;Like Terence Rattigan in recent years, Pinero is being dusted down, reappraised and hailed as one of the great British playwrights&quot;.

===Adaptations===
====Musicals====
Four of Pinero&#x27;s plays have been adapted as musicals: &quot;The Magistrate&quot; as &quot;The Boy&quot; (1917) with words by Fred Thompson, Percy Greenbank and Adrian Ross and music by Lionel Monckton and Howard Talbot; &quot;In Chancery&quot; as &quot;Who&#x27;s Hooper?&quot; (1919) with lyrics by Thompson and music by Talbot and Ivor Novello; &quot;The Schoolmistress&quot; as &quot;My Niece&quot; (1921) with words by Greenbank and music by Talbot; and &quot;Trelawny of the &quot;Wells&quot;&quot; as &quot;Trelawny&quot; (1972), adapted by Aubrey Woods, George Rowell and Julian Slade.

====Cinema====
The first of Pinero&#x27;s works to be filmed was &quot;The Second Mrs Tanqueray&quot;, in an unauthorised American silent version in 1914, which prompted a successful but not very lucrative lawsuit by the author. With his approval, eight of his plays were adapted for the silent cinema, an authorised version of &quot;The Second Mrs Tanqueray&quot; (1916) with George Alexander in his first film role, reprising the part he created in 1893; &quot;Trelawny of the &quot;Wells&quot;&quot; (1916); &quot;Sweet Lavender&quot; (twice: in 1915 and 1920); &quot;Iris&quot; (twice: 1916 and as &quot;A Slave of Vanity&quot;, 1920); &quot;The Profligate&quot; (1917); &quot;The Gay Lord Quex&quot; (twice: 1917 and 1919); &quot;Mid-Channel&quot; (1920); &quot;His House in Order&quot; (1920) and &quot;The Enchanted Cottage (1924).

After the days of silent films there were adaptions of &quot;His House in Order&quot; (1928) &quot;Trelawny of the &quot;Wells&quot;&quot; (as &quot;The Actress&quot;, 1928), &quot;The Magistrate&quot; (as &quot;Those Were the Days&quot;, 1934), &quot;Dandy Dick&quot; (1935), &quot;The Enchanted Cottage&quot; (1945), and &quot;The Second Mrs Tanqueray&quot; (1952).

====Television====
There have been many adaptations of Pinero&#x27;s works for broadcasting. Television versions include &quot;The Gay Lord Quex&quot; (1946, 1953 and 1983, starring respectively Ronald Ward, André Morell and Anton Rogers); &quot;The Magistrate&quot; (1946, 1951 and 1972, Desmond Walter-Ellis, Richard Goolden and Michael Hordern); &quot;Trelawny of the &quot;Wells&quot;&quot; (1949, 1971 and 1985, Bransby Williams, Roland Culver, Michael Hordern); &quot;Dandy Dick&quot; (1948, directed by Athene Seyler) and &quot;The Second Mrs Tanqueray&quot; starring Elizabeth Sellars (1962).

===Reputation===
In 1906, &quot;The Times&quot; commented:
:When Mr. Pinero is at his best we reckon ourselves as close upon the high water mark of theatrical enjoyment. … This or that playwright may show more &quot;heart&quot; than Mr. Pinero or a more delicate subtlety, a third may easily outclass him in intellectual gymnastic, but in his command of the resources of the stage for the legitimate purposes of the stage he is without a rival. As it was said of Euripides that he was τραγικώτατος, the most tragic of the tragic writers, as it might be said of Molière that he was the most comic of comic writers, so it may be said of Mr. Pinero that of all our dramatists to-day he is the most &quot;dramatic&quot;. The art of drama is, quintessentially, the art of story-telling, as the sculptors say, &quot;in the round&quot;. Mr. Pinero is supreme as a story-teller of that sort. We are always keenly interested in what his people are doing at the moment; we always have the liveliest curiosity about what they are going to do a moment later.

By the time of Pinero&#x27;s death in 1934 the paper had become less enthusiastic. Both &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; published polite obituaries that respectfully relegated his works to a bygone era. For twenty years after his death Pinero&#x27;s reputation remained in what Dawick calls &quot;a state of near-eclipse&quot;. From the 1950s onwards interest in his Court farces grew. In a 1972 study of the playwright, Walter Lazenby wrote, &quot;Pinero cannot be outranked as a farceur by any other English writer; not even Shakespeare consistently expended on this form the care and art which went into the Court Theatre farces or achieved such thoroughly satisfying results&quot;. Reviewing the book, the academic Robert Ronning agreed that the farces were Pinero&#x27;s most enduring works:
:The fact that students will continue to read &quot;The Second Mrs Tanqueray&quot; instead of &quot;The Magistrate&quot; does not mean much except for what they learn about craftsmanship, and this could be learned equally well from the farces. ... While we have seen considerable interest in the field of nineteenth century drama in recent years, one doubts if Pinero&#x27;s social and problem plays will ever catch on.
In 2012 the director Stephen Unwin wrote:

:One of the most heartening developments in recent years has been the critical rehabilitation of the oft-scorned giants of the commercial theatre. Thus Coward has been revealed as an English Chekhov and Rattigan as the supreme explorer of the hidden heart. But neither would have been possible without Pinero, whose surprisingly moving, amazingly theatrical and deeply humane plays still have the power to astonish and delight 100 years after they first created such a stir.

<text>Animal welfare organizations are concerned with the health, safety and psychological wellness of individual animals. These organizations include animal rescue groups and wildlife rehabilitation centers, which care for animals in distress and sanctuaries, where animals are brought to live and be protected for the rest of their lives. Their goals are generally distinct from conservation organizations, which are primarily concerned with the preservation of species, populations, habitats, ecosystems and biodiversity, rather than the welfare of individual animals.

For organizations with Wikipedia pages, see :Category:Animal welfare organizations.

<text>Carrefour Group, S.A. (, ), is a French multinational retail and wholesaling corporation headquartered in Massy, France. It operates a chain of hypermarkets, grocery stores and convenience stores. By 2024, the group had 14,000 stores in 40 countries. It is the seventh-largest retailer in the world by revenue.

==History==
The first Carrefour shop (not a hypermarket) opened in 1960, within suburban Annecy, near a crossroads (hence the name ― &quot;carrefour&quot; means &quot;crossroads&quot; in French). The group was created in 1958 by Marcel Fournier, Denis Defforey and Jacques Defforey, who attended and were influenced by several seminars in the United States led by &quot;the Pope of retail&quot;, Bernardo Trujillo.

The Carrefour group was the first in Europe to open a hypermarket: a large supermarket and a department store under the same roof. They opened their first hypermarket on 15 June 1963 in Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois, near Paris.

In September 2009, Carrefour updated its logo.

In May 2011, Carrefour reviewed its business situation under conditions of stagnant growth and increasing competition in France from rivals including Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA, and decided to invest €1.5  billion ($2.22  billion) to introduce the supermarket concept of Carrefour Planet in Western Europe.

In April 2015, Brazilian businessman Abílio Diniz revealed he was in talks to raise his 5.07 per cent stake in Carrefour and has the support of shareholders to take a board seat.

On 9 June 2017, the board of directors chose Alexandre Bompard as the new chairman and chief executive officer of Carrefour with effect as of 18 July 2017.

In 2017, Carrefour began working with a small French start-up, Expliceat, on a trial basis.

In January 2018, Alexandre Bompard announced a strategic plan for the company, entitled &quot;Carrefour 2022&quot;, that seeks to make Carrefour the &quot;leader of the food transition for all&quot;. The plan includes measures for better food and package sustainability, limitation of food waste, development of organic products, e-commerce partnerships, and two billion euros in annual investments from 2018 as well as organisational and cost reduction measures.

In the exceptional context of the COVID-19 pandemic, Carrefour is the first retailer to join &quot;C&#x27;est qui le Patron ?&quot; initiative to share its additional incomes related to COVID-19 to support people who are suffering from the current situation. According to co-founder Nicolas Chabanne, 100,000 euros have been paid out, then 50,000 euros each week until 11 May.

Carrefour&#x27;s Board of Directors has decided to reduce by 50% the dividend proposed for 2019. The dividend is now €0.69 per share (versus €0.46 per share).

Until the end of the year, Alexandre Bompard and all the members of Carrefour Group&#x27;s board of directors have decided to waive 25% of their director&#x27;s fees. These savings will be used to finance solidarity actions for the company&#x27;s employees, both in France and abroad.

Alexandre Bompard has decided to waive 25% of his fixed salary for a period of two months. To express his gratitude to his personnel in the field, he has decided to offer an exceptional bonus of €1,000 net to 85,000 employees in France.

== Financial data ==
== Domestic operations ==
The headquarters of the Groupe Carrefour is in Massy, in the Paris metropolitan area. In 2019, the former Carrefour head office of Boulogne-Billancourt and the Carrefour France division office of Courcouronnes, Essonne, near Évry, were combined at that major location. A secondary head office is located in Mondeville, near Caen (Normandy), which was until 1999 the former Promodès headquarters.

In France, Carrefour operates under its name over 230 hypermarkets (from 2500 up to 23000 sq m sales area), 1020 Carrefour Market supermarkets (generally from 1000 up to 4000 sq m), and over 2000 smaller supermarkets and convenience stores under the Carrefour City, Carrefour Contact and Carrefour Express banners.

Carrefour also owns the Promocash Cash&amp;Carry chain (130 locations) and supplies 1500 independent small food stores under the Proxi banner. It has recently acquired the organic food chains SoBio and Bio C&#x27;Bon to boost its presence in this promising segment.

In 2019, the group launched its first Supeco soft discount stores, which are so far all located in the French Northern region Hauts-de-France. The concept is still being assessed.

In December 2023, Carrefour and Uber decided to team up to get access to the French supermarket chain&#x27;s charging points for electric vehicles. Uber has invested around $323,400 to allow its VTC (tourist vehicle with drivers) drivers using EVs to charge their cars in the Carrefour Énergies&#x27; stations in France.

==International operations==

By 2024, the group had 14,000 stores in 40 countries.

===Africa===

====Kenya====
Carrefour has 20 outlets in Kenya, largely located in the suburbs of Nairobi. The retailer&#x27;s expansion into Kenya has benefited from the failure of previously dominant supermarket chains such as Nakumatt and Uchumi as Carrefour rushed in to occupy the retail spaces and market share they vacated.

The retailer is the anchor client of The Hub Karen Mall where it opened its first Kenyan store in May 2016. A second outlet was opened at Two Rivers Mall in March 2017, soon followed by a third store the Thika Road Mall in November 2017. The fourth outlet was opened at the Junction Mall along Ngong Road in January 2018; the fifth at Sarit Center in April 2018. In June 2020, Carrefour opened a new store along Uhuru Highway.

In September 2020, Carrefour announced plans to continue its expansion efforts by opening three branches in the coastal city of Mombasa. In May 2021 it opened another branch of Carrefour Market in Garden City Mall along the Thika superhighway. It also has a branch at Westgate Mall previously occupied by ShopRite.

====Uganda====
Carrefour operates multiple stores in the Ugandan capital city of Kampala and Entebbe. The anchor clients are located at Oasis Mall and Metroplex and are in spaces previously occupied by the Kenyan retail chain Nakumatt.

In September 2021 Carrefour signed an agreement with Shoprite of South Africa for the former to take over six stores that the latter would vacate in Uganda. This has increased Carrefour&#x27;s presence in the country significantly.

As of 2023, there are six outlets located in Kampala: Acacia Mall (Kissimenti), Arena Mall (Nsambya), Lugogo Mall (Nakawa), Metroplex (Naalya), Oasis Mall (Nakasero and Village Mall (Bugolobi). One outlet is located in Victoria Mall in Entebbe.

West and Central Africa

In 2013, Carrefour and the CFAO Group signed a contract for the opening of stores in West and Central Africa. With the first hypermarket opening on Playce Shopping Mall in Abidjan on 2015, Carrefour also has another hypermarket on Yaoundé.

On 22 March 2016, it expanded its operations to Islamabad by opening a hypermarket in World Trade Center Islamabad.

Since 20 December 2018, MAF has rebranded Hyperstar to Carrefour across Pakistan. It has plans to expand its stores to other cities including Gujranwala, Multan and Hyderabad. As of June 2019, the group had already invested and was looking to invest another in Pakistan. It is operating at least seven hypermarkets (three in Lahore, two in Karachi, one in Islamabad and one in Faisalabad&#x27;s Lyallpur Galleria) and one superstore in Pakistan.

====Taiwan====
In 2020, Carrefour Taiwan announced they would acquire 199 Wellcome and 25 Jasons Market Place stores from Dairy Farm International.

In 2022, Carrefour announced that it sold 60% equity of Carrefour Taiwan to Uni-President Enterprises Corporation.

In 1999, Carrefour entered the Greek market in collaboration with Marinopoulos S.A. Carrefour stopped operating in Greece in 2017 due to its acquisition by the Sklavenitis group. The company reopened in the country in May 2022, and the reactivation of the Carrefour brand in the market will be done in collaboration with Retail &amp; more S.A., a subsidiary of the Teleunicom group.

In 2001, Carrefour entered the Romanian market, expanded into 43 stores. It is one of the top retailers in Romania.

The company operates in Spain under the name of Centros Comerciales Carrefour SA. As of 2019, Carrefour Spain is the 15th most important Spanish company by revenue.

Eight years after bankruptcy (2016), Carrefour returned to Bulgaria. As of June 2024, there are stores open in Varna, Sofia and Burgas. In December 2023 Carrefour has announced the &quot;return of stores and products&quot; of its brand in Bulgaria through the Greek franchisee Retail &amp; More, which will provide &quot;sub-franchising of the Carrefour brand&quot; for at least around 20 stores.

==Former international operations==


* Austria – In 1976 Carrefour opened a store in the Shopping City Süd at the southern edge of Vienna. Due to limited success, the store closed soon after. Carrefour has not made any other attempt at entering the Austrian market after that.
* Chile – Carrefour opened six supermarkets in Santiago de Chile between 1998 and 2003. However, Carrefour never surpassed a 3% market share in the country and their assets in Chile were sold to D&amp;S in 2003.
* China – Carrefour entered China in 1995. In 2007, Carrefour opened 22 stores in China – where the company broke its record for store openings in a one-year period. It was the leading foreign retailer in terms of sales figures, until 2008 and has since lost its No. 1 position in China to Walmart. In 2019, Carrefour sold 80% equity of Carrefour China to local retail comglomorate Suning.com at €620 million, marking the company&#x27;s exit from China.
* Colombia – In October 2012, Carrefour sold all 72 stores in Colombia to Chilean retailer Cencosud for $2.6  billion, with Cencosud converting all existing Carrefour hypermarkets to its Jumbo and Metro brands. Carrefour pulled out of Colombia to focus on its core markets.
* Cyprus – In 2017, all of the Carrefour stores were sold to a Greek supermarket brand Sklavenitis and underwent a major rebranding, to reflect the brand that now owns the stores.
* Czech Republic – In September 2005, Carrefour sold eleven stores in the Czech Republic to Tesco, the largest UK retailer. Tesco paid €57.4  million as well as its stores in Taiwan. Carrefour opened its first store in 1998 in the Czech Republic. The stores use the Tesco name and brand now.
* Germany – The only store in Germany was opened in 1977 in Mainz-Bretzenheim as a joint venture with Delhaize le Lion and German retailer Stüssgen (later part of REWE Group). Due to problems with a new building permit process and the associated difficulties in opening new locations, the store was sold in 1979 to the German retailer Massa.
* Hong Kong – On 18 September 2000, Carrefour closed its stores in Hong Kong after complaints from manufacturers about selling products (especially electronics) at prices far below those of its competitors. A company spokesman said at that time that the closures were due to &quot;difficulties in finding sites suitable for developing its hypermarket concept and quickly acquiring a significant market share&quot;. Carrefour entered the Hong Kong market in December 1996 with a store in Heng Fa Chuen and later added stores in Tsuen Wan (Skyline Plaza), Tuen Mun, Yuen Long and Tsim Sha Tsui. Plans to open additional stores in Ma On Shan, Tseung Kwan O and Yau Tsim Mong had been cancelled.
* India – Carrefour operated cash and carry stores in India under the name Carrefour Wholesale Cash &amp; Carry. The first store opened on 30 December 2010 in Shahdara, Delhi. This was followed by a store in Jaipur in late 2011 and one in Meerut in October 2012, Agra in December 2013. Prior to September 2012, India&#x27;s foreign direct investment (FDI) policy did not allow foreign companies to open multi-brand retail stores in the country. However, 100% FDI in cash-and-carry has been permitted since 1997. As a result, most global retailers, including Carrefour, opted for the cash-and-carry route in India. A new FDI policy, allowing up to 51% FDI in multi-brand retail, came into effect on 20 September 2012. On 8 July 2014, Carrefour announced that it would shut down its Indian operations and close its five wholesale stores by the end of September.
* Indonesia – The first Carrefour branch in Indonesia opened on 14 October 1998 in Cempaka Putih region of Jakarta, following the end of 1997 Asian financial crisis and the subsequent fall of Suharto.

CT Corp developed Transmart in 2014, a subsidiary of CT Corp operated by PT Trans Retail Indonesia (formerly PT Carrefour Indonesia, PT Contimas Utama Indonesia, PT Cartisa Properti Indonesia and PT Carti Satria Megaswalayan) and named after CT Corp&#x27;s television networks Trans TV. It also developed Groserindo, a grocery store also largely operated by Carrefour. Carrefour officially left the nation in 2020, and CT Corp rebranded all remaining branches as Transmart.

Sales were initially strong, but, as Miki Tanikawa of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;...10 months later, there is barely a line for most of the day at cash registers of most Carrefour stores here. Lengthy aisles of goods ranging from clothes to bicycles are mostly empty.&quot; In early 2003, Carrefour sold its 8 hypermarkets to AEON Group and on 10 March 2005, the subsidiary&#x27;s name changed to AEON Marché Co., Ltd. The stores were still operated in the Carrefour name until 31 March 2010, when the license expired. 
* Kazakhstan – In the summer of 2017, the one and only Carrefour hypermarket closed down in Almaty as a result of the loss of value of the Tenge currency.
* Malaysia – Carrefour entered Malaysia in 1994 and sold its 26 hypermarkets to AEON Group in November 2012. The hypermarkets was rebranded as AEON BIG, and operates with an orange logo, compared to the magenta logo used by its parent company and existing JUSCO stores in the country. The outlets in Kota Damansara and Jalan Ipoh were the first to be changed from Carrefour to AEON BIG;

*Jordan – Carrefour started its operations in Jordan in 2006 under Majid Al Futtaim, becoming a prominent retailer with multiple outlets across the country. Known for its diverse product range and affordability. However, Carrefour announced its closure in Jordan, citing challenges such as increasing competition, changing market dynamics, and a strategic decision to optimize operations in the region. Despite its closure, Carrefour continues to thrive in neighboring countries under Majid Al Futtaim&#x27;s management. Carrefour closed down all its operating units from 4 November 2024. It was rebranded as HyperMax.
*Oman – Carrefour started its operations in Oman in 2001 under Majid Al Futtaim, becoming a prominent retailer with multiple outlets across the country. Known for its diverse product range and affordability, it served Omani shoppers for over two decades. However, in late 2024, Carrefour announced its closure in Oman, citing challenges such as increasing competition, changing market dynamics, and a strategic decision to optimize operations in the region. Despite its closure, Carrefour continues to thrive in neighboring countries under Majid Al Futtaim&#x27;s management. Carrefour closed down all its operating units from 7 January 2025. It was rebranded as HyperMax.
* Portugal – Carrefour entered Portugal by buying its first stores in 1991 – two Euromarché hypermarkets in Telheiras (a neighbourhood of Lisbon) and Vila Nova de Gaia. In July 2007 Carrefour sold all of its 12 hypermarkets and 9 fuel stations to Sonae for €662  million. Also included were 11 licenses for opening new commercial spaces.

* South Korea – Carrefour entered the Korean market in 1996 with their first store in Bucheon and operated 32 stores across the country at its peak in its final year, 2006. Carrefour was confident they would dominate the market, and by 1999 invested a total of US$925 million into the Korean venture – more than any other foreign company in the Korean market at that time. Carrefour Korea enjoyed mediating success initially, gaining traction for unseen low prices and standing above its competitors, but the rise quickly ended when the Asian Financial Crisis struck South Korea in late 1997. Carrefour&#x27;s reputation suffered a blow when they were exposed smuggling real estate in South Korea to international recipients. Alongside the reluctance of people spending in the midst of the financial crisis, boycotts ensued, beginning Carrefour&#x27;s eventual demise. Complaints of Carrefour Korea&#x27;s poor service quality grew, citing pushing products unfit for the Korean market and significantly soured relationships between the executives and the labour unions. With the company&#x27;s attitude becoming reckless to its clients and suppliers, clients would boycott again while suppliers began refusing association with Carrefour Korea. With the company stained with controversial negativity, Carrefour Korea sold all their stores to E-Land and exited the Korean market in April 2006. Shortly after, E-Land sold their supermarket asset to Homeplus, recognized as Carrefour Korea&#x27;s spiritual successor.

Carrefour entered the Thai market in 1995 under Central Group joint venture stakes and opened their first branch in the following year.
* United Kingdom – Carrefour opened the first of several hypermarkets in the UK in September 1972 in Caerphilly, South Wales, in a joint partnership with a UK company Wheatsheaf and Distribution &amp; Trading Ltd, followed by stores at the Telford Centre, Chandler&#x27;s Ford, Minworth, Patchway and Swindon. The Dee Corporation later acquired the stores in the early 1980s; they continued to trade under the Carrefour name, while some other existing smaller sites were rebranded as Carrefour. In the 1980s, new stores were opened at the MetroCentre in Tyne and Wear, and the Merry Hill Shopping Centre in the West Midlands, before being rebranded under the now-defunct Gateway chain in 1988. In 1990, the stores were sold to Asda. The initial Caerphilly store was redeveloped in the 1990s; however, the original 1970s hypermarkets at Chandler&#x27;s Ford, Minworth and Patchway (Cribbs Causeway) still exist as large Asda Supercentres. Since July 2011, online supermarket Ocado has sold a range of Carrefour products in the UK.
* United States – Carrefour opened its first hypermarket in the United States in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in March 1988, across from the Franklin Mills shopping mall (now Philadelphia Mills). Despite the large selection, the store was generally derided for its poor conditions, and most of the time, many of the 61 checkout lanes in the store were deserted. In 1992, another location opened in Voorhees Township, New Jersey. Both stores closed because of financial debt in 1993. The Voorhees store was broken up into many smaller stores, while the Philadelphia location became a Walmart and a Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods.
* Uzbekistan - Carrefour previously opened hypermarkets in Uzbekistan on 2021, which were franchised by Majid Al-Futtaim, however all stores in Uzbekistan closed in 2023.
* Vietnam – Carrefour had two stores at Ho Chi Minh City until 2004. The stores were later converted into Lotte Mart branches.

==Carrefour Foundation==
The Carrefour Foundation (&quot;Fondation d&#x27;Enterprise Carrefour&quot;) is a philanthropic fund created by Carrefour in 2000 to support social welfare programmes &#x27;linked to [its] core business as a retailer&#x27; in countries the company operates and in countries where its suppliers are located.

==Criticism and controversies==

On 1 May 2007, more than 30 employees of the now-closed Carrefour Ratu Plaza, Jakarta, Indonesia, were taken to the Pertamina Central Hospital after being affected by carbon monoxide. The hypermarket was located in the mall&#x27;s basement, which offered insufficient ventilation.

On 26 June 2007, the company was convicted in a French court for false advertising. The suit alleged that Carrefour regularly stocked insufficient quantities of advertised products for sale. In addition, the company was convicted of selling products below cost and accepting kickbacks from wholesalers. Carrefour was ordered to pay a fine of €2 million and to prominently and legibly display a notice in all of its French stores disclosing the false advertising.

In Carrefour Mangga Dua Square in Jakarta, Indonesia, a 5-metre high metal rack fell on top of a 3-year-old boy, killing him almost instantly due to internal bleeding. Afterwards, the victim&#x27;s family claimed that Carrefour has refused to meet with them to settle the case. However, a Carrefour Corporate Affairs Officer denied this allegation.

Carrefour has also received criticism for engaging in sweatshop practices.

On 7 May 2009, the French government asked a tribunal to fine Carrefour some €220,000 for more than 2,500 violations. Meat products lacked proper tracking information (more than 25% of inventory at some locations), and some products had incorrect labels – such as meat products that &quot;shrank&quot; in weight by 15% after receiving labels. The chain sold products that had long since passed their expiration dates, including, in one case, packs of baby formula that had expired six months earlier. Some 1,625 frozen and refrigerated products were found that had been stored in warehouses at ambient temperatures.

On 17 September 2018 images revealed that the municipal slaughterhouse in Boischaut, France, responsible for supplying meat to Carrefour, was killing animals in an extremely cruel way: cutting them up while they were still alive. The mistreatment scandal reverberated around the world and led to the closure of the slaughterhouse.

On 10 January 2019 the French branch made the news after selling zebra meat, Carrefour said it stopped selling the meat.

===Boycott of supplies in China===

In April 2008, after the 2008 Olympic torch relay was disrupted by Tibetan independence movement advocates in London and especially in Paris, where some protesters attempted to wrest control of the torch from the torch bearers, Chinese activists promoted boycotting Carrefour because of unsubstantiated rumours that the company gave funds to Tibetan independence groups and the Dalai Lama. In its response, Carrefour China stated that it did support the Beijing Olympics; and that it would never do anything to harm the feelings of the Chinese people. Protests and calls for the boycott later subsided, partly because of efforts by French officials to apologize for the Paris torch attack.

===Building collapse at Savar===

On 24 April 2013, the eight-story &quot;Rana Plaza&quot; commercial building collapsed in Savar, a sub-district near Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. At least 1,127 people died and over 2,438 were injured. The factory housed a number of separate garment factories employing around 5,000 people, several shops, and a bank and manufactured apparel for brands including the Benetton Group, Joe Fresh, The Children&#x27;s Place, Primark, Monsoon, and Dressbarn. Of the 29 brands identified as having sourced products from the Rana Plaza factories, only 9 attended meetings held in November 2013 to agree a proposal on compensation to the victims. Several companies refused to sign, including Walmart, Carrefour, Bonmarché, Mango, Auchan and KiK. The agreement was signed by Primark, Loblaw, Bonmarché and El Corte Ingles.

===Slavery in Thailand===
In 2014, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Carrefour is a client of Charoen Pokphand Foods. During a six-month investigation, &quot;The Guardian&quot; traced the entire supply chain from slave ships in Asian waters to leading producers and retailers.

=== Incidents of violence in Brazil ===
In Brazil, from 2007 onwards, the chain suffered at least four lawsuits against violence, racism and homophobia, in addition to an execution against a man who stole 4 pieces of chicken meat, for public humiliation against employees and violence against children.

In one of the cases, a black man who owned a Ford EcoSport was mistaken for a thief while caring for his sleeping two-year-old child in the parking lot, while waiting for the rest of his family who were shopping inside. He was initially approached by a security officer in plain clothes who accused him of stealing the vehicle, who then punched his face and injuring his jaw. He was then taken inside by third-party security and physically and psychologically tortured for more than 15 minutes, in addition to hearing slurs referring to his black color. After the incident, the store removed the security officer and discredited the third-party security company.

Another case of beatings followed by death occurred at the Supermercado Dia e Noite store, a subsidiary of the Carrefour group in São Carlos. The theft of two cheese breads, some drumsticks and hair cream, committed by bricklayer Ademir Peraro, aged 43 at the time, led to his beating by the store supervisor and a security guard. After the end of torture, the victim was locked in the bathroom until the store closed, when he was thrown into the street. Rescued by family members, he was taken to the hospital; before dying, the mason was able to report the torture he was subjected to. The most costly lawsuit for Carrefour so far was in the amount of R$50,000, followed by another for R$44,640.

The episode, known as the Manchinha case or Caso Manchinha, sparked a series of protests led by activists in front of the Osasco store in December 2018, and also inspired the creation of bill PL 1.095/2019, which was later approved by the executive and turned into a federal law in September 2020, imposing harsher penalties to crimes related to animal abuse.

On 5 January 2019 the Rio de Janeiro branch made the news after 15 cats were killed by poisoning by supermarket employees. The company became aware of the case, and carried out a census to determine the animals that resided in its units so that it could rescue them and direct them to shelters.

On 19 November 2020, one day before the Brazilian holiday Black Awareness Day, a 40-year-old black man named João Alberto Silveira Freitas was killed by security guards after an altercation with a cashier. After an alleged &quot;violent gesture&quot; to one of the cashiers, two security guards were called, proceeded to drag the man out of the store and beat him to death in the parking lot.

<text>The secretary of state for Wales (), also referred to as the Welsh secretary, is a secretary of state in the Government of the United Kingdom, with responsibility for the Wales Office. The incumbent is a member of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom.

The officeholder works alongside the other Wales Office ministers. The corresponding shadow minister is the shadow secretary of state for Wales. The position is currently held by Jo Stevens having been appointed by Keir Starmer in July 2024.

==Creation==
In the first half of the 20th century, a number of politicians had supported the creation of the post of Secretary of State for Wales as a step towards home rule for Wales. A post of Minister of Welsh Affairs was created in 1951 under the home secretary and was upgraded to minister of state level in 1954.

The Labour Party proposed the creation of a Welsh Office run by a Secretary of State for Wales in their manifesto for the 1959 general election. When they came to power in 1964 this was soon put into effect.

The post of Secretary of State for Wales came into existence on 17 October 1964; the first incumbent was Jim Griffiths, MP for Llanelli. The position entailed responsibility for Wales, and expenditure on certain public services was delegated from Westminster. In April 1965 administration of Welsh affairs, which had previously been divided between a number of government departments, was united in a newly created Welsh Office with the secretary of state for Wales at its head, and the Welsh secretary became responsible for education and training, health, trade and industry, environment, transport and agriculture within Wales.

==History==
During the 1980s and 1990s, as the number of Conservative MPs for Welsh constituencies dwindled almost to zero, the office fell into disrepute. Nicholas Edwards, MP for Pembrokeshire, held the post for eight years. On his departure, the government ceased to look within Wales for the secretary of state, and the post was increasingly used as a way of getting junior high-fliers into the Cabinet. John Redwood in particular caused embarrassment when he publicly demonstrated his inability to sing &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot;, the Welsh national anthem, at a conference.

The introduction of the National Assembly for Wales and the Welsh Government, after the devolution referendum of 1997, was the beginning of a new era. On 1 July 1999 the majority of the functions of the Welsh Office transferred to the new assembly. The Welsh Office was disbanded, but the post of Secretary of State for Wales was retained, as the head of the newly created Wales Office.

Since 1999 there have been calls for the office of Welsh secretary to be scrapped or merged with the posts of Secretary of State for Scotland and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, to reflect the lesser powers of the role since devolution. Those calling for a Secretary of State for the Union include Robert Hazell, in a department into which Rodney Brazier has suggested adding a Minister of State for England with responsibility for English local government.

In June 2024, Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, called for the position&#x27;s abolishment describing it as &quot;outdated&quot;, that it &quot;entrench[es]&quot; a power imbalance, and its powers should be devolved. The party&#x27;s representatives accused the shadow Labour holder, Jo Stevens, of having a &quot;contemptuous attitude towards devolution&quot; based on Stevens&#x27; comments relating to High Speed 2 and justice and policing. The Conservative incumbent David TC Davies expressed his surprise, stating that the &quot;so-called &#x27;party of Wales&#x27; is now wanting to silence Wales&#x27; voice [in the cabinet]&quot;. In Plaid Cymru&#x27;s motion on 26 June, calling for the post&#x27;s abolishment, leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew RT Davies, supported the motion after being confused it was a Tory amendment being voted on.

<text>A seamount is a large submarine landform that rises from the ocean floor without reaching the water surface (sea level), and thus is not an island, islet, or cliff-rock. Seamounts are typically formed from extinct volcanoes that rise abruptly and are usually found rising from the seafloor to in height. They are defined by oceanographers as independent features that rise to at least above the seafloor, characteristically of conical form. The peaks are often found hundreds to thousands of meters below the surface, and are therefore considered to be within the deep sea. During their evolution over geologic time, the largest seamounts may reach the sea surface where wave action erodes the summit to form a flat surface. After they have subsided and sunk below the sea surface, such flat-top seamounts are called &quot;guyots&quot; or &quot;tablemounts&quot;.

Earth&#x27;s oceans contain more than 14,500 identified seamounts, of which 9,951 seamounts and 283 guyots, covering a total area of , have been mapped but only a few have been studied in detail by scientists. Seamounts and guyots are most abundant in the North Pacific Ocean, and follow a distinctive evolutionary pattern of eruption, build-up, subsidence and erosion. In recent years, several active seamounts have been observed, for example Kamaʻehuakanaloa (formerly Lōʻihi) in the Hawaiian Islands.

Because of their abundance, seamounts are one of the most common marine ecosystems in the world. Interactions between seamounts and underwater currents, as well as their elevated position in the water, attract plankton, corals, fish, and marine mammals alike. Their aggregational effect has been noted by the commercial fishing industry, and many seamounts support extensive fisheries. There are ongoing concerns on the negative impact of fishing on seamount ecosystems, and well-documented cases of stock decline, for example with the orange roughy (&quot;Hoplostethus atlanticus&quot;). 95% of ecological damage is done by bottom trawling, which scrapes whole ecosystems off seamounts.

Because of their large numbers, many seamounts remain to be properly studied, and even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite altimetry are two technologies working to close the gap. There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts; for example, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship that struck it in 1973. However, the greatest danger from seamounts are flank collapses; as they get older, extrusions seeping in the seamounts put pressure on their sides, causing landslides that have the potential to generate massive tsunamis.

==Geography==
Seamounts can be found in every ocean basin in the world, distributed extremely widely both in space and in age. A seamount is technically defined as an isolated rise in elevation of or more from the surrounding seafloor, and with a limited summit area, of conical form. There are more than 14,500 seamounts. In addition to seamounts, there are more than 80,000 small knolls, ridges and hills less than 1,000 m in height in the world&#x27;s oceans.

Most seamounts are volcanic in origin, and thus tend to be found on oceanic crust near mid-ocean ridges, mantle plumes, and island arcs. Overall, seamount and guyot coverage is greatest as a proportion of seafloor area in the North Pacific Ocean, equal to 4.39% of that ocean region. The Arctic Ocean has only 16 seamounts and no guyots, and the Mediterranean and Black seas together have only 23 seamounts and 2 guyots. The 9,951 seamounts which have been mapped cover an area of . Seamounts have an average area of , with the smallest seamounts found in the Arctic Ocean and the Mediterranean and Black Seas; whilst the largest mean seamount size, , occurs in the Indian Ocean. The largest seamount has an area of and it occurs in the North Pacific. Guyots cover a total area of and have an average area of , more than twice the average size of seamounts. Nearly 50% of guyot area and 42% of the number of guyots occur in the North Pacific Ocean, covering . The largest three guyots are all in the North Pacific: the Kuko Guyot (estimated ), Suiko Guyot (estimated ) and the Pallada Guyot (estimated ).

===Grouping===

Seamounts are often found in groupings or submerged archipelagos, a classic example being the Emperor Seamounts, an extension of the Hawaiian Islands. Formed millions of years ago by volcanism, they have since subsided far below sea level. This long chain of islands and seamounts extends thousands of kilometers northwest from the island of Hawaii.

There are more seamounts in the Pacific Ocean than in the Atlantic, and their distribution can be described as comprising several elongate chains of seamounts superimposed on a more or less random background distribution. Seamount chains occur in all three major ocean basins, with the Pacific having the most number and most extensive seamount chains. These include the Hawaiian (Emperor), Mariana, Gilbert, Tuomotu and Austral Seamounts (and island groups) in the north Pacific and the Louisville and Sala y Gomez ridges in the southern Pacific Ocean. In the North Atlantic Ocean, the New England Seamounts extend from the eastern coast of the United States to the mid-ocean ridge. Craig and Sandwell noted that clusters of larger Atlantic seamounts tend to be associated with other evidence of hotspot activity, such as on the Walvis Ridge, Vitória-Trindade Ridge, Bermuda Islands and Cape Verde Islands. The mid-Atlantic ridge and spreading ridges in the Indian Ocean are also associated with abundant seamounts. Otherwise, seamounts tend not to form distinctive chains in the Indian and Southern Oceans, but rather their distribution appears to be more or less random.

Isolated seamounts and those without clear volcanic origins are less common; examples include Bollons Seamount, Eratosthenes Seamount, Axial Seamount and Gorringe Ridge.

If all known seamounts were collected into one area, they would make a landform the size of Europe. Their overall abundance makes them one of the most common, and least understood, marine structures and biomes on Earth, a sort of exploratory frontier.

==Geology==
===Geochemistry and evolution===
Most seamounts are built by one of two volcanic processes, although some, such as the Christmas Island Seamount Province near Australia, are more enigmatic. Volcanoes near plate boundaries and mid-ocean ridges are built by decompression melting of rock in the upper mantle. The lower density magma rises through the crust to the surface. Volcanoes formed near or above subducting zones are created because the subducting tectonic plate adds volatiles to the overriding plate that lowers its melting point. Which of these two process involved in the formation of a seamount has a profound effect on its eruptive materials. Lava flows from mid-ocean ridge and plate boundary seamounts are mostly basaltic (both tholeiitic and alkalic), whereas flows from subducting ridge volcanoes are mostly calc-alkaline lavas. Compared to mid-ocean ridge seamounts, subduction zone seamounts generally have more sodium, alkali, and volatile abundances, and less magnesium, resulting in more explosive, viscous eruptions.

All volcanic seamounts follow a particular pattern of growth, activity, subsidence and eventual extinction. The first stage of a seamount&#x27;s evolution is its early activity, building its flanks and core up from the sea floor. This is followed by a period of intense volcanism, during which the new volcano erupts almost all (e.g. 98%) of its total magmatic volume. The seamount may even grow above sea level to become an oceanic island (for example, the 2009 eruption of Hunga Tonga). After a period of explosive activity near the ocean surface, the eruptions slowly die away. With eruptions becoming infrequent and the seamount losing its ability to maintain itself, the volcano starts to erode. After finally becoming extinct (possibly after a brief rejuvenated period), they are ground back down by the waves. Seamounts are built in a far more dynamic oceanic setting than their land counterparts, resulting in horizontal subsidence as the seamount moves with the tectonic plate towards a subduction zone. Here it is subducted under the plate margin and ultimately destroyed, but it may leave evidence of its passage by carving an indentation into the opposing wall of the subduction trench. The majority of seamounts have already completed their eruptive cycle, so access to early flows by researchers is limited by late volcanic activity.

Ocean-ridge volcanoes in particular have been observed to follow a certain pattern in terms of eruptive activity, first observed with Hawaiian seamounts but now shown to be the process followed by all seamounts of the ocean-ridge type. During the first stage the volcano erupts basalt of various types, caused by various degrees of mantle melting. In the second, most active stage of its life, ocean-ridge volcanoes erupt tholeiitic to mildly alkalic basalt as a result of a larger area melting in the mantle. This is finally capped by alkalic flows late in its eruptive history, as the link between the seamount and its source of volcanism is cut by crustal movement. Some seamounts also experience a brief &quot;rejuvenated&quot; period after a hiatus of 1.5 to 10 million years, the flows of which are highly alkalic and produce many xenoliths.

In recent years, geologists have confirmed that a number of seamounts are active undersea volcanoes; two examples are Kamaʻehuakanaloa (formerly Lo‘ihi) in the Hawaiian Islands and Vailulu&#x27;u in the Manu&#x27;a Group (Samoa).

===Lava types===
The most apparent lava flows at a seamount are the eruptive flows that cover their flanks, however igneous intrusions, in the forms of dikes and sills, are also an important part of seamount growth. The most common type of flow is pillow lava, named so after its distinctive shape. Less common are sheet flows, which are glassy and marginal, and indicative of larger-scale flows. Volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks dominate shallow-water seamounts. They are the products of the explosive activity of seamounts that are near the water&#x27;s surface, and can also form from mechanical wear of existing volcanic rock.

===Structure===
Seamounts can form in a wide variety of tectonic settings, resulting in a very diverse structural bank. Seamounts come in a wide variety of structural shapes, from conical to flat-topped to complexly shaped. Some are built very large and very low, such as Koko Guyot and Detroit Seamount; others are built more steeply, such as Kamaʻehuakanaloa Seamount and Bowie Seamount. Some seamounts also have a carbonate or sediment cap.

Many seamounts show signs of intrusive activity, which is likely to lead to inflation, steepening of volcanic slopes, and ultimately, flank collapse. There are also several sub-classes of seamounts. The first are guyots, seamounts with a flat top. These tops must be or more below the surface of the sea; the diameters of these flat summits can be over . Knolls are isolated elevation spikes measuring less than . Lastly, pinnacles are small pillar-like seamounts.

==Ecology==
===Ecological role of seamounts===
Seamounts are exceptionally important to their biome ecologically, but their role in their environment is poorly understood. Because they project out above the surrounding sea floor, they disturb standard water flow, causing eddies and associated hydrological phenomena that ultimately result in water movement in an otherwise still ocean bottom. Currents have been measured at up to 0.9 knots, or 48 centimeters per second. Because of this upwelling seamounts often carry above-average plankton populations, seamounts are thus centers where the fish that feed on them aggregate, in turn falling prey to further predation, making seamounts important biological hotspots.

Seamounts provide habitats and spawning grounds for these larger animals, including numerous fish. Some species, including black oreo &quot;(Allocyttus niger)&quot; and blackstripe cardinalfish &quot;(Apogon nigrofasciatus)&quot;, have been shown to occur more often on seamounts than anywhere else on the ocean floor. Marine mammals, sharks, tuna, and cephalopods all congregate over seamounts to feed, as well as some species of seabirds when the features are particularly shallow.

Seamounts often project upwards into shallower zones more hospitable to sea life, providing habitats for marine species that are not found on or around the surrounding deeper ocean bottom. Because seamounts are isolated from each other they form &quot;undersea islands&quot; creating the same biogeographical interest. As they are formed from volcanic rock, the substrate is much harder than the surrounding sedimentary deep sea floor. This causes a different type of fauna to exist than on the seafloor, and leads to a theoretically higher degree of endemism. However, recent research especially centered at Davidson Seamount suggests that seamounts may not be especially endemic, and discussions are ongoing on the effect of seamounts on endemicity. They &quot;have&quot;, however, been confidently shown to provide a habitat to species that have difficulty surviving elsewhere.

The volcanic rocks on the slopes of seamounts are heavily populated by suspension feeders, particularly corals, which capitalize on the strong currents around the seamount to supply them with food. These coral are therefore host to numerous other organisms in a commensal relationship, for example brittle stars, who climb the coral to get themselves off the seafloor, helping them to catch food particles, or small zooplankton, as they drift by. This is in sharp contrast with the typical deep-sea habitat, where deposit-feeding animals rely on food they get off the ground. In tropical zones extensive coral growth results in the formation of coral atolls late in the seamount&#x27;s life.

In addition soft sediments tend to accumulate on seamounts, which are typically populated by polychaetes (annelid marine worms) oligochaetes (microdrile worms), and gastropod mollusks (sea slugs). Xenophyophores have also been found. They tend to gather small particulates and thus form beds, which alters sediment deposition and creates a habitat for smaller animals. Many seamounts also have hydrothermal vent communities, for example Suiyo and Kamaʻehuakanaloa seamounts. This is helped by geochemical exchange between the seamounts and the ocean water.

Seamounts may thus be vital stopping points for some migratory animals, specifically whales. Some recent research indicates whales may use such features as navigational aids throughout their migration. For a long time it has been surmised that many pelagic animals visit seamounts as well, to gather food, but proof of this aggregating effect has been lacking. The first demonstration of this conjecture was published in 2008.

===Fishing===
The effect that seamounts have on fish populations has not gone unnoticed by the commercial fishing industry. Seamounts were first extensively fished in the second half of the 20th century, due to poor management practices and increased fishing pressure seriously depleting stock numbers on the typical fishing ground, the continental shelf. Seamounts have been the site of targeted fishing since that time.

Nearly 80 species of fish and shellfish are commercially harvested from seamounts, including spiny lobster (Palinuridae), mackerel (Scombridae and others), red king crab (&quot;Paralithodes camtschaticus&quot;), red snapper (&quot;Lutjanus campechanus&quot;), tuna (Scombridae), Orange roughy (&quot;Hoplostethus atlanticus&quot;), and perch (Percidae).

===Conservation===
The ecological conservation of seamounts is hurt by the simple lack of information available. Seamounts are very poorly studied, with only 350 of the estimated 100,000 seamounts in the world having received sampling, and fewer than 100 in depth. Much of this lack of information can be attributed to a lack of technology, and to the daunting task of reaching these underwater structures; the technology to fully explore them has only been around the last few decades. Before consistent conservation efforts can begin, the seamounts of the world must first be mapped, a task that is still in progress.

Overfishing is a serious threat to seamount ecological welfare. There are several well-documented cases of fishery exploitation, for example the orange roughy (&quot;Hoplostethus atlanticus&quot;) off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand and the pelagic armorhead (&quot;Pseudopentaceros richardsoni&quot;) near Japan and Russia. The reason for this is that the fishes that are targeted over seamounts are typically long-lived, slow-growing, and slow-maturing. The problem is confounded by the dangers of trawling, which damages seamount surface communities, and the fact that many seamounts are located in international waters, making proper monitoring difficult. Bottom trawling in particular is extremely devastating to seamount ecology, and is responsible for as much as 95% of ecological damage to seamounts.

Corals from seamounts are also vulnerable, as they are highly valued for making jewellery and decorative objects. Significant harvests have been produced from seamounts, often leaving coral beds depleted.

Individual nations are beginning to note the effect of fishing on seamounts, and the European Commission has agreed to fund the OASIS project, a detailed study of the effects of fishing on seamount communities in the North Atlantic. Another project working towards conservation is CenSeam, a Census of Marine Life project formed in 2005. CenSeam is intended to provide the framework needed to prioritise, integrate, expand and facilitate seamount research efforts in order to significantly reduce the unknown and build towards a global understanding of seamount ecosystems, and the roles they have in the biogeography, biodiversity, productivity and evolution of marine organisms.

Possibly the best ecologically studied seamount in the world is Davidson Seamount, with six major expeditions recording over 60,000 species observations. The contrast between the seamount and the surrounding area was well-marked. One of the primary ecological havens on the seamount is its deep sea coral garden, and many of the specimens noted were over a century old. Following the expansion of knowledge on the seamount there was extensive support to make it a marine sanctuary, a motion that was granted in 2008 as part of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Much of what is known about seamounts ecologically is based on observations from Davidson. Another such seamount is Bowie Seamount, which has also been declared a marine protected area by Canada for its ecological richness.

==Exploration==
The study of seamounts has been hindered for a long time by the lack of technology. Although seamounts have been sampled as far back as the 19th century, their depth and position meant that the technology to explore and sample seamounts in sufficient detail did not exist until the last few decades. Even with the right technology available, only a scant 1% of the total number have been explored, and sampling and information remains biased towards the top . New species are observed or collected and valuable information is obtained on almost every submersible dive at seamounts.

Before seamounts and their oceanographic impact can be fully understood, they must be mapped, a daunting task due to their sheer number. The most detailed seamount mappings are provided by multibeam echosounding (sonar), however after more than 5000 publicly held cruises, the amount of the sea floor that has been mapped remains minuscule. Satellite altimetry is a broader alternative, albeit not as detailed, with 13,000 catalogued seamounts; however this is still only a fraction of the total 100,000. The reason for this is that uncertainties in the technology limit recognition to features or larger. In the future, technological advances could allow for a larger and more detailed catalogue.

Observations from CryoSat-2 combined with data from other satellites has shown thousands of previously uncharted seamounts, with more to come as data is interpreted.

== Deep-sea mining ==
Seamounts are a possible future source of economically important metals. Even though the ocean makes up 70% of Earth&#x27;s surface area, technological challenges have severely limited the extent of deep sea mining. But with the constantly decreasing supply on land, some mining specialists see oceanic mining as the destined future, and seamounts stand out as candidates.

Seamounts are abundant, and all have metal resource potential because of various enrichment processes during the seamount&#x27;s life. An example for epithermal gold mineralization on the seafloor is Conical Seamount, located about 8 km south of Lihir Island in Papua New Guinea. Conical Seamount has a basal diameter of about 2.8 km and rises about 600 m above the seafloor to a water depth of 1050 m. Grab samples from its summit contain the highest gold concentrations yet reported from the modern seafloor (max. 230 g/t Au, avg. 26 g/t, n=40). Iron-manganese, hydrothermal iron oxide, sulfide, sulfate, sulfur, hydrothermal manganese oxide, and phosphorite (the latter especially in parts of Micronesia) are all mineral resources that are deposited upon or within seamounts. However, only the first two have any potential of being targeted by mining in the next few decades.

== Dangers ==
Some seamounts have not been mapped and thus pose a navigational danger. For instance, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship that hit it in 1973. More recently, the submarine USS &quot;San Francisco&quot; ran into an uncharted seamount in 2005 at a speed of , sustaining serious damage and killing one seaman.

One major seamount risk is that often, in the late of stages of their life, extrusions begin to seep in the seamount. This activity leads to inflation, over-extension of the volcano&#x27;s flanks, and ultimately flank collapse, leading to submarine landslides with the potential to start major tsunamis, which can be among the largest natural disasters in the world. In an illustration of the potent power of flank collapses, a summit collapse on the northern edge of Vlinder Seamount resulted in a pronounced headwall scarp and a field of debris up to away. A catastrophic collapse at Detroit Seamount flattened its whole structure extensively. Lastly, in 2004, scientists found marine fossils up the flank of Kohala mountain in Hawaii. Subsidation analysis found that at the time of their deposition, this would have been up the flank of the volcano, far too high for a normal wave to reach. The date corresponded with a massive flank collapse at the nearby Mauna Loa, and it was theorized that it was a massive tsunami, generated by the landslide, that deposited the fossils.

<text>James (Jeremiah) Griffiths (19 September 1890 – 7 August 1975) was a Welsh Labour Party politician who served for 34 years as a Member of Parliament (MP). He was a trade union leader and became the first Secretary of State for Wales, serving from 1964 to 1966 under Harold Wilson.

==Background and education==
He was born in the predominantly Welsh-speaking village of Betws, near Ammanford in Carmarthenshire. The youngest of ten children, his father, William Griffiths, was the local blacksmith. He spoke no English until he was five. Educated at Betws Board School, he left at the age of 13 to work at Ammanford No. 1 colliery (Gwaith Isa&#x27;r Betws), where he eventually became Lodge Secretary. Griffiths was a pacifist and while campaigning against the Great War met fellow socialist Winifred Rutley, and they married in October 1918. His brother (David Rees Griffiths, 1882–1953) was a Welsh poet who took the bardic name of &#x27;Amanwy&#x27; after his native valley.

==Political career==
Griffiths continued his education by attending night school and became an active socialist. He helped establish a branch of the Independent Labour Party in Ammanford in 1908 and soon became its secretary. Later, he occupied the powerful post of secretary of the newly formed Ammanford Trades Council (1916–1919). At the age of 29, he left the colliery on a miner&#x27;s scholarship (1919–1921) to the Central Labour College, London, where at the same time Aneurin Bevan and Morgan Phillips were studying.

On returning home, Griffiths worked as Llanelli Labour Party agent (1922–1925), before becoming an agent for the Anthracite Miners&#x27; Association (1925–1936), and President of the powerful South Wales Miners&#x27; Federation – known locally as the Fed – in the Anthracite district of West Wales (1934–1936). In 1936, he was elected Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for what was then safe seat of Llanelli. Three years later, he continued his rise through the Labour movement by getting elected to the party&#x27;s National Executive Committee. In 1942, he led 97 Labour MP&#x27;s to vote against the Labour Party&#x27;s compromise with Winston Churchill&#x27;s Conservative Party for the government to neither endorse nor condemn the Beveridge Report recommending the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state in postwar Britain. Despite the defiance of the party leadership, the vote boosted Labour&#x27;s popularity by demonstrating its support for the report&#x27;s recommendations.

Following Labour&#x27;s victory at the 1945 general election, he was made a Privy Counsellor and Minister for National Insurance by Prime Minister Clement Attlee. In this role, he was responsible for creating the modern state benefit system. He introduced the Family Allowances Act 1945, the National Insurance Act 1946 and the National Assistance and Industrial Injuries Act 1948. Along with Bevan, he was one of the chief architects of the British welfare state. He served as Chairman of the Labour Party (1948–1949), and in 1950 he became Secretary of State for the Colonies. Within two years, though, the Labour Party was out of office.

During the long period in opposition, Griffiths became Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (1955–1959), and spokesman on Welsh affairs. He used his good relationship with Hugh Gaitskell to commit the Labour Party to a measure of devolution. Amid the Suez Crisis of 1956, he made an important speech opposing the underhanded tactics of the then Prime Minister Anthony Eden in which he stated: &quot;This is for our country a black and tragic week... an unjustifiable and wicked war&quot;. This was said to sum up the mood of many at the time.

Given Griffiths&#x27; determination in having campaigned for a Secretary of State for Wales ever since the 1930s, Harold Wilson persuaded him to delay retirement and serve as the first Secretary of State for Wales following Labour&#x27;s 1964 general election victory. At Wilson&#x27;s instigation, Griffiths established the Welsh Office and laid the foundations for the role until the 1966 general election, whereupon he returned to the backbenches. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour.

Though by now suffering from ill-health, Griffiths avoided resigning from the House of Commons, because he feared that if he did so, Labour would lose a by-election in Llanelli. Plaid Cymru had captured the neighbouring seat of Carmarthen in 1966; and the Llanelli Rugby coach Carwyn James was poised to stand for Plaid Cymru in a by-election, had Griffiths stood down. He remained in Parliament until the 1970 general election, by which time he was about to turn 80 and was among Parliament&#x27;s oldest MPs, and among the few born in the 19th century. He was succeeded in Llanelli by Denzil Davies, who fended off the Plaid Cymru challenge. Similarly to Griffiths, Davies would remain MP for the constituency for around 35 years. The previous year, Griffiths had published his autobiography, &quot;Pages From Memory&quot; (London: Dent, 1969).

==Personal life==
He died in Teddington, Greater London, aged 84, leaving two sons and two daughters. He is buried at the Christian Temple chapel in Ammanford. In a memorial address, Jim Callaghan, prime minister (1976–79), described him as &quot;one of the greatest sons of Wales. We honour the memory of Jim Griffiths of Ammanford. I mention his birth place because, despite all his honours and journeyings, it was the place of his birth, deep in the heart of Wales, that essentially shaped his life and actions.&quot;

<doc id="167651" wikidata="Q48280" url="?curid=167651" title="Marianne Faithfull">
<text>Marianne Evelyn Gabriel Faithfull (29 December 1946 – 30 January 2025) was an English singer and actress who achieved popularity in the 1960s with the release of her UK top 10 single &quot;As Tears Go By&quot;. She became one of the leading female artists of the British Invasion in the United States.

Born in Hampstead, London, Faithfull began her career in 1964 after attending a party for the Rolling Stones, where she was discovered by the band&#x27;s manager Andrew Loog Oldham. Her 1965 debut studio album &quot;Marianne Faithfull&quot;, released simultaneously with her studio album &quot;Come My Way&quot;, was a huge success and was followed by further albums on Decca Records. From 1966 to 1970 she had a highly publicised romantic relationship with Mick Jagger. Her popularity was enhanced by roles in films, including &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Forget What&#x27;s&#x27;isname&quot; (1967), &quot;The Girl on a Motorcycle&quot; (1968) and &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1969). Her popularity was overshadowed by personal problems in the 1970s, when she became anorexic, homeless and addicted to heroin.

During her 1960s musical career, Faithfull was noted for her distinctive melodic, high-register vocals. In the subsequent decade her voice was altered by severe laryngitis and persistent drug abuse, which left her sounding permanently raspy, cracked and lower in pitch. The new sound was praised as &quot;whisky soaked&quot; by some critics and was seen as having helped to capture the raw emotions expressed in her music.

After a long absence, Faithfull made a musical comeback in 1979 with the release of a critically acclaimed seventh studio album, &quot;Broken English&quot;. The album was a commercial success and marked a resurgence of her musical career. &quot;Broken English&quot; earned Faithfull a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance and is regarded as her &quot;definitive recording&quot;. She followed this with a series of studio albums including &quot;Dangerous Acquaintances&quot; (1981), &quot;A Child&#x27;s Adventure&quot; (1983) and &quot;Strange Weather&quot; (1987). Faithfull wrote three books about her life: &quot;&quot; (1994), &quot;Memories, Dreams &amp; Reflections&quot; (2007) and &quot;Marianne Faithfull: A Life on Record&quot; (2014).

Faithfull received the World Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2009 Women&#x27;s World Awards, and in 2011 she was made a of the by the government of France.

==Early life==

=== Ancestry ===
Faithfull was born at the old Queen Mary&#x27;s Maternity House in Hampstead, London. Her father, Major Robert Glynn Faithfull, was a British intelligence officer and professor of Italian literature at Bedford College, London University. Her mother, Eva, was the daughter of Artur Wolfgang Ritter von Sacher-Masoch (1875–1953), an Austro-Hungarian nobleman of old Polonized Catholic Ruthenian nobility. Eva was born in Budapest and moved to Vienna in 1918; she chose to style herself as Eva von Sacher-Masoch, Baroness Erisso in adulthood. She had been a ballerina for the Max Reinhardt Company during her early years, and danced in productions of works by the German theatrical duo Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill.

The Sacher-Masoch family secretly opposed the Nazi regime in Vienna. Faithfull&#x27;s father met Eva through his intelligence work for the British Army, which brought him into contact with her family. Faithfull&#x27;s maternal grandfather had aristocratic roots in the Habsburg Dynasty, and Faithfull&#x27;s maternal grandmother was Jewish.

Faithfull&#x27;s maternal great-great-uncle was Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, whose erotic novel &quot;Venus in Furs&quot; spawned the word &quot;masochism&quot;. Regarding her roots in the Austrian nobility, Faithfull appeared on the British television series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, which discussed that the title used by family members was Ritter von Sacher-Masoch.

=== Childhood ===
Faithfull&#x27;s family lived in Ormskirk, Lancashire, while her father completed a doctorate at Liverpool University. Marianne spent part of her early life in Braziers Park, Oxfordshire, at a commune formed by John Norman Glaister in which Faithfull&#x27;s father played an instrumental role.

Her parents divorced when she was six. Faithfull&#x27;s half-brother, 19 years her junior, is artist Simon Faithfull. Following the divorce, Faithfull moved with her mother to Reading, Berkshire. Her primary school was in Brixton, London. They lived in underprivileged circumstances, and Marianne&#x27;s girlhood was marred by bouts of tuberculosis. She was a charitably subsidised (bursaried) pupil at St Joseph&#x27;s Roman Catholic Convent School, Reading, where she was for a time a weekly boarder. While at St Joseph&#x27;s, she was a member of the Progress Theatre&#x27;s student group.

== Singing career ==
=== 1960s ===
Faithfull began her singing career in 1964. Her first gigs as a folk music performer were in coffeehouses and she soon began taking part in London&#x27;s exploding social scene. In early 1964 she attended a Rolling Stones launch party with artist John Dunbar and met Andrew Loog Oldham, who &#x27;discovered&#x27; her. &quot;As Tears Go By&quot;, her first single, was written and composed by Jagger, Keith Richards, and Oldham, and became a chart success. (The Rolling Stones recorded their version one year later, which was also successful.) She then released a series of successful singles, including &quot;This Little Bird&quot;, &quot;Summer Nights&quot;, and &quot;Come and Stay with Me&quot;. Faithfull married John Dunbar on 6 May 1965 in Cambridge, with Peter Asher as the best man. The couple lived in a flat at 29 Lennox Gardens in Belgravia, London SW1. On 10 November 1965, she gave birth to their son, Nicholas.

In 1966 she took Nicholas to stay with Brian Jones and Anita Pallenberg in London. During this period, Faithfull started smoking marijuana and became best friends with Pallenberg. She began a much-publicised relationship with Mick Jagger that same year and left her husband to live with him. The couple became a notorious part of the hip Swinging London scene. Her voice is heard on The Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. She was found wearing only a fur rug by police executing a drug search at Redlands, Keith Richards&#x27;s house in West Wittering, Sussex. In an interview 27 years later with A.M. Homes for &quot;Details&quot;, Faithfull discussed her wilder days and admitted that the drug bust fur rug incident had ravaged her personal life: &quot;It destroyed me. To be a male drug addict and to act like that is always enhancing and glamorising. A woman in that situation becomes a slut and a bad mother.&quot; It was during this time that Faithfull lost three opportunities to appear in films. &quot;I really thought I had blown my career.&quot; 
In May 1967, Graham Nash, who found Marianne Faithfull &quot;unbelievably attractive,&quot; wrote and released the hit song &quot;Carrie Anne&quot; with The Hollies, a track which started out as being about Faithfull.
In 1968, Faithfull, by now addicted to cocaine, gave birth to a stillborn daughter (whom she had named Corrina) while returning from Jagger&#x27;s country house in Ireland.

Faithfull&#x27;s involvement in Jagger&#x27;s life was reflected in some of the Rolling Stones&#x27; best known songs. &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;, featured on the 1968 album &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;, was partially inspired by &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;, written by Mikhail Bulgakov, a book that Faithfull introduced to Jagger. The song &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot; on the 1969 album &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; was supposedly written and composed about Faithfull; the songs &quot;Wild Horses&quot; and &quot;I Got the Blues&quot; on the 1971 album &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; were allegedly influenced by Faithfull, and she co-wrote &quot;Sister Morphine&quot;. The writing credit for the song was the subject of a protracted legal battle that was resolved by listing Faithfull as co-author. In her autobiography, Faithfull said Jagger and Richards released it in their own names so that her agent would not collect all the royalties and proceeds from the song, especially as she was homeless and addicted to heroin at the time. In 1968, Faithfull appeared in &quot;The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus&quot; concert, giving a solo performance of &quot;Something Better&quot;.

=== 1970s ===
Faithfull ended her relationship with Jagger in May 1970 after starting an affair with Anglo-Irish nobleman &quot;Paddy&quot; Rossmore. She lost custody of her son in that same year, which led to her attempting suicide. Faithfull&#x27;s personal life went into decline and her career went into a tailspin. She made only a few public appearances, including an October 1973 performance with David Bowie singing Sonny &amp; Cher&#x27;s &quot;I Got You Babe&quot;.

Faithfull lived on London&#x27;s Soho streets for two years, suffering from heroin addiction and anorexia nervosa. Friends intervened and enrolled her in an NHS heroin-assisted treatment programme. She failed to control or stabilise her addiction. In 1971, producer Mike Leander found her on the streets and made an attempt to revive her career, producing part of her album &quot;Rich Kid Blues&quot;. The album was shelved until 1985.

In 1975, she released the country-influenced record &quot;Dreamin&#x27; My Dreams&quot;. The album was re-released in 1978 as &quot;Faithless&quot; with some new tracks added and reached No.1 on the Irish Albums Chart. Faithfull squatted in a Chelsea flat without hot water or electricity with her then-boyfriend Ben Brierly of the band the Vibrators. She later shared flats in 
Chelsea and Regent&#x27;s Park with Henrietta Moraes.

In 1979, the same year that she was arrested for marijuana possession in Norway, Faithfull&#x27;s career returned full force with the album &quot;Broken English&quot;, her most critically hailed album. Partially influenced by the punk explosion and her marriage to Brierly in the same year, it ranged from the punk-pop sounds of the title track, which addressed terrorism in Europe (and was dedicated to Ulrike Meinhof), to the punk-reggae rhythms of &quot;Why D&#x27;Ya Do It?&quot;, a song with aggressive lyrics adapted from a poem by Heathcote Williams. This song had a complex musical structure. On the superficial hard rock it had a tango in 4/4 time, with an opening electric guitar riff by Barry Reynolds in which beats 1 and 4 of each measure were accented on the up-beat, and beat 3 was accented on the down beat. Faithfull, in her autobiography, commented that her fluid yet rhythmic reading of Williams&#x27; lyric was &quot;an early form of rap&quot;. &quot;Broken English&quot; was the album that revealed the full extent of Faithfull&#x27;s alcohol and drug use and their effects on her singing voice, with the melodic vocals on her early records replaced by raucous, deep vocals which helped to express the raw emotions expressed in the album&#x27;s songs. A disastrous February 1980 appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; was blamed on too many rehearsals, but it was suspected that drugs had caused her voice to seize up.

&quot;The Ballad of Lucy Jordan&quot; was released as a single from the album in October 1979 and became one of her highest-charting songs. It featured on the soundtracks of the films &quot;Montenegro&quot;, &quot;Tarnation&quot; and &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot;. Faithfull also performed the song during a guest appearance in an episode in the fourth season of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;. In 2016, the song was used in the finale of &quot;American Horror Story: Hotel&quot;. Faithfull discussed her interpretation of the song in a 2007 interview on ITV&#x27;s &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;.

=== 1980s ===
Faithfull began living in New York City after the release of &quot;Dangerous Acquaintances&quot; in 1981. The same year, she appeared as a vocalist on the single &quot;Misplaced Love&quot; by Rupert Hine, which charted in Australia. Despite her comeback, in the mid-1980s she was battling with addiction and at one point tripped and broke her jaw on a flight of stairs while under the influence. &quot;Rich Kid Blues&quot; (1985) was another collection of her early work combined with new recordings, a double record showcasing both the pop and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll facets of her output to date. In 1985, Faithfull performed &quot;Ballad of the Soldier&#x27;s Wife&quot; on Hal Willner&#x27;s tribute album &quot;Lost in the Stars: The Music of Kurt Weill&quot;. Faithfull&#x27;s restrained readings lent themselves to the material and this collaboration informed several subsequent works.

In 1985, she attended the Hazelden Foundation Clinic in Minnesota for rehabilitation and received treatment at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts. While living at a hotel in nearby Cambridge, Massachusetts, Faithfull started an affair (while still married to Brierly) with a dual diagnosis (mentally ill and drug dependent) man, Howard Tose, who later committed suicide by jumping from a 14th floor window of the flat they shared. In 1987, Faithfull dedicated a &quot;thank you&quot; to Tose on the album sleeve of &quot;Strange Weather&quot;: &quot;To Howard Tose with love and thanks&quot;. Faithfull&#x27;s divorce from Brierly was finalised that year. In 1995, she wrote and sang about Tose&#x27;s death in &quot;Flaming September&quot; on the album &quot;A Secret Life&quot;.

In 1987, Faithfull ventured into jazz and blues on &quot;Strange Weather&quot;, which was also produced by Willner. The album became her most critically lauded album of the decade. Coming full circle, the renewed Faithfull cut another recording of &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; for &quot;Strange Weather&quot;, this time in a tighter, more gravelly voice. The singer confessed to a lingering irritation with her first hit. &quot;I always childishly thought that was where my problems started, with that damn song,&quot; she told Jay Cocks in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, but she came to terms with it as well as with her past. In a 1987 interview with Rory O&#x27;Connor of &quot;Vogue&quot;, Faithfull declared &quot;forty is the age to sing it, not seventeen.&quot; The album of covers was produced by Hal Willner after the two had spent numerous weekends listening to hundreds of songs from 20th-century music. They chose such diverse tracks to record as Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Keep It with Mine&quot; and &quot;Yesterdays&quot;, written by Broadway composers Jerome Kern and Otto Harbach. The work included tunes first made notable by such blues luminaries as Billie Holiday and Bessie Smith; Tom Waits wrote the title track. In 1988, Faithfull married writer and actor Giorgio Della Terza, and they divorced in 1991.

=== 1990s ===
When Roger Waters assembled an all-star cast of musicians to perform the rock opera &quot;The Wall&quot; live in Berlin in July 1990, Faithfull played the part of Pink&#x27;s overprotective mother. Her musical career rebounded for the third time during the early 1990s with the live album &quot;Blazing Away,&quot; which featured Faithfull revisiting songs she had performed over the course of her career. &quot;Blazing Away&quot; was recorded at St. Ann&#x27;s Cathedral in Brooklyn. The 13 selections include &quot;Sister Morphine&quot;, a cover of Edith Piaf&#x27;s &quot;Les Prisons du Roy&quot;, and &quot;Why D&#x27;Ya Do It?&quot; from &quot;Broken English&quot;. Alanna Nash of &quot;Stereo Review&quot; commended the musicians whom Faithfull had chosen to back her: Longtime guitarist Reynolds was joined by former Band member Garth Hudson and pianist Dr. John. Nash was impressed with the album&#x27;s autobiographical tone, noting that &quot;Faithfull&#x27;s gritty alto is a cracked and halting rasp, the voice of a woman who&#x27;s been to hell and back on the excursion fare which, of course, she has.&quot; She extolled Faithfull as &quot;one of the most challenging and artful of women artists,&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Fred Goodman asserted: &quot;&quot;Blazing Away&quot; is a fine retrospective – proof that we can still expect great things from this greying, jaded contessa.&quot;

&quot;A Collection of Her Best Recordings&quot; was released in 1994 by Island Records to coincide with the release of Faithfull&#x27;s autobiography; they originally shared the same cover art. The album contained Faithfull&#x27;s updated version of &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; from &quot;Strange Weather&quot;, several cuts from &quot;Broken English&quot; and &quot;A Child&#x27;s Adventure&quot; and a song written by Patti Smith which had been scheduled for inclusion on an Irish AIDS benefit album. This track, &quot;Ghost Dance&quot;, suggested to Faithfull by a friend who later died of AIDS, was made with a trio of old friends; Stones&#x27; drummer Charlie Watts and guitarist Ron Wood backed Faithfull&#x27;s vocals on the song and Keith Richards co-produced it. The retrospective album featured one live track, &quot;Times Square&quot;, from &quot;Blazing Away,&quot; as well as the Faithfull original &quot;She&quot;, written with composer and arranger Angelo Badalamenti. It was released the following year on &quot;A Secret Life&quot;, with additional songs co-written with Badalamenti. Faithfull sang &quot;Love Is Teasin&quot;, an Irish folk standard, with The Chieftains on their album &quot;The Long Black Veil&quot;, released in 1995. During this time she sang a duet with John Prine on the song &quot;This Love Is Real&quot; on Prine&#x27;s album &quot;Lost Dogs and Mixed Blessings&quot;. Faithfull sang a duet and recited text on the San Francisco band Oxbow&#x27;s 1997 album &quot;Serenade in Red&quot;. She sang interlude vocals on Metallica&#x27;s song &quot;The Memory Remains&quot; on their 1997 album &quot;Reload&quot; and appeared in the song&#x27;s music video. The track reached No.13 in the UK, No. 28 in the U.S. (No.3 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart).

As her fascination with the music of Weimar-era Germany continued, Faithfull performed in &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; at the Gate Theatre, Dublin, playing Pirate Jenny. Her interpretation of the music led to a new album, &quot;Twentieth Century Blues&quot; (1996), which focused on the music of Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht as well as Noël Coward, followed in 1998 by a recording of &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot; with the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Dennis Russell Davies. A hugely successful concert and cabaret tour, accompanied by pianist Paul Trueblood, culminated in the filming at the Montreal Jazz Festival of the DVD &quot;Marianne Faithfull Sings Kurt Weill&quot;.

In 1998, Faithfull released &quot;A Perfect Stranger: The Island Anthology&quot;, a two-disc compilation that chronicled her years with Island Records. It featured tracks from her albums &quot;Broken English&quot;, &quot;Dangerous Acquaintances&quot;, &quot;A Child&#x27;s Adventure&quot;, &quot;Strange Weather&quot;, &quot;Blazing Away&quot;, and &quot;A Secret Life&quot;, as well as several B sides and unreleased tracks.

Faithfull&#x27;s 1999 DVD &quot;Dreaming My Dreams&quot; contained material about her childhood and parents, with historical video footage going back to 1964, and included interviews with the artist and several friends who had known her since childhood. The documentary included sections on her relationship with John Dunbar and Mick Jagger, and brief interviews with Keith Richards. It concluded with footage from a 30-minute live concert, originally broadcast on PBS for the series &quot;Sessions at West 54th&quot;. The same year, she ranked 25th in &quot;VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Women in Rock and Roll&quot;.

Roger Waters of Pink Floyd wrote the song &quot;Incarceration of a Flower Child&quot; as a portrayal of Syd Barrett in 1968, although it was never recorded by Pink Floyd. The song was recorded by Faithfull on her 1999 album &quot;Vagabond Ways&quot;.

=== 2000s ===

Faithfull released several albums from the late 1990s into the 2000s that received positive critical response, beginning with &quot;Vagabond Ways&quot; (1999), which was produced and recorded by Mark Howard. &quot;Vagabond Ways&quot; included collaborations with Daniel Lanois, Emmylou Harris, Pink Floyd&#x27;s Roger Waters, and writer and friend Frank McGuinness. Later that year she sang &quot;Love Got Lost&quot; on Joe Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Night and Day II&quot;.

Her renaissance continued with &quot;Kissin Time&quot;, released in 2002. The album contained songs written with Blur, Beck, Billy Corgan, Jarvis Cocker, Dave Stewart, David Courts and the French pop singer Étienne Daho. On this record, she paid tribute to Nico (with &quot;Song for Nico&quot;), whose work she admired. The album included an autobiographical song she co-wrote with Cocker, called &quot;Sliding Through Life on Charm&quot;.

In 2005, she released &quot;Before the Poison&quot;. The album was primarily a collaboration with PJ Harvey and Nick Cave; Damon Albarn and Jon Brion also contributed. &quot;Before the Poison&quot; received mixed reviews from both &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Village Voice&quot;. In 2005 she recorded and co-produced &quot;Lola R Forever&quot;, a cover of the Serge Gainsbourg song &quot;Lola Rastaquouere&quot; with Sly and Robbie for the tribute album &quot;Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited&quot;. In 2007, Faithfull collaborated with the British singer-songwriter Patrick Wolf on the duet &quot;Magpie&quot; from his third album &quot;The Magic Position,&quot; and wrote and recorded a new song for the French film &quot;Truands&quot; called &quot;A Lean and Hungry Look&quot; with Ulysse.

In March 2007, she returned to the stage with a touring show titled &quot;Songs of Innocence and Experience&quot;. Supported by a trio, the performance had a semi-acoustic feel and toured European theatres throughout the spring and summer. The show featured many songs she had not performed live before, including &quot;Something Better&quot;, the song she sang on &quot;The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus&quot;. The show included the Harry Nilsson song &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Me&quot;, &quot;Marathon Kiss&quot; from &quot;Vagabond Ways&quot;, and a version of the traditional &quot;Spike Driver Blues&quot;. On 4 November 2007, the European Film Academy announced that Faithfull had received a nomination for Best Actress for her role as Maggie in &quot;Irina Palm&quot;.

Articles published at that time hinted that Faithfull was looking to retire and was hoping that money from &quot;Songs of the Innocence and Experience&quot; would enable her to live in comfort. She said: &quot;I&#x27;m not prepared to be 70 and absolutely broke. I realised last year that I have no safety net at all and I&#x27;m going to have to get one. So I need to change my attitude to life, which means I have to put away 10 per cent every year of my old age. I want to be in a position where I don&#x27;t have to work. I should have thought about this a long time ago but I didn&#x27;t.&quot; She still lived in her flat located on one of the richest Parisian avenues and had a house in County Waterford, Ireland. Recording of &quot;Easy Come, Easy Go&quot; commenced in New York City on 6 December 2007; the album was produced by Hal Willner, who had recorded &quot;Strange Weather&quot; in 1997. and featured a version of Morrissey&#x27;s &quot;Dear God Please Help Me&quot; from his 2006 album &quot;Ringleader of the Tormentors&quot;. In March 2009, she performed &quot;The Crane Wife 3&quot; on &quot;The Late Show&quot;. In late March, Faithfull began the Easy Come, Easy Go tour, which took her to France, Germany, Austria, New York City, Los Angeles and London.

In November, Faithfull was interviewed by Jennifer Davies on World Radio Switzerland, where she described the challenges of being stereotyped as a &quot;mother, or the pure wife&quot;. Because of this, she insisted, it had been hard to maintain a long career as a female artist, which, she said, gave her empathy for Amy Winehouse when they had met recently.

On 5 March 2009, Faithfull received the World Arts Award for Lifetime Achievement at the 2009 Women&#x27;s World Awards. &quot;Marianne&#x27;s contribution to the arts over a 45-year career including 18 studio albums as a singer, songwriter and interpreter, and numerous appearances on stage and screen is now being acknowledged with this special award.&quot; The award was presented in Vienna, with ceremonies televised in over 40 countries on 8 March 2009 as part of International Women&#x27;s Day.

On 26 October 2009, Faithfull was honoured with the Icon of the Year award from Q magazine.

=== 2010s ===
On 31 January 2011, Faithfull released her 18th studio album, &quot;Horses and High Heels,&quot; in mainland Europe to mixed reviews. The 13-track album contained four songs co-written by Faithfull; the rest were mainly covers of well-known songs such as Dusty Springfield&#x27;s &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot; and the Shangri-Las&#x27; &quot;Past, Present, Future&quot;. A UK CD release was planned for 7 March 2011. Faithfull supported the album&#x27;s release with an extensive European tour with a five-piece band and arrived in the UK on 24 May for a rare show at London&#x27;s Barbican Centre, with an extra UK show added at Leamington Spa on 26 May.

On 23 March 2011, Faithfull was awarded the Commandeur of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, one of France&#x27;s highest cultural honours. On 7 May 2011, she appeared on the &quot;Graham Norton Show&quot;. She reunited with Metallica in December 2011 for their 30th anniversary celebration at the Fillmore where she performed &quot;The Memory Remains&quot;.

In 2012, Faithfull recorded a cover version of a Stevie Nicks track from the Fleetwood Mac album &quot;Tusk&quot; as part of a Fleetwood Mac tribute project. The track, &quot;Angel&quot;, was released on 14 August 2012 as part of the tribute album &quot;Just Tell Me That You Want Me&quot;. On 22 June 2013, she made a sell-out concert appearance at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, with jazz musician Bill Frisell playing guitar, as a part of the Meltdown Festival curated by Yoko Ono. In September 2014, Faithfull released an album of all-new material, titled &quot;Give My Love to London&quot;. She started a 12-month 50th anniversary tour at the end of 2014.

During a webchat hosted by &quot;The Guardian&quot; on 1 February 2016, Faithfull revealed plans to release a live album from her 50th anniversary tour. She had ideas for a follow-up for &quot;Give My Love to London&quot;, but had no intention of recording new material for at least a year and a half. Faithfull&#x27;s album &quot;Negative Capability&quot;, was released in November 2018. It featured Rob Ellis, Warren Ellis, Nick Cave, Ed Harcourt, and Mark Lanegan.

=== 2020s ===
A spoken word album titled &quot;She Walks in Beauty&quot; was released in May 2021. Faithfull was accompanied with musical arrangements by Warren Ellis, Brian Eno, Nick Cave and Vincent Segal. The album saw her recite 19th-century British Romantic poets.

== Achievements ==
In 1999, Faithfull ranked 25th on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Women of Rock and Roll. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Faithfull at number 173 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

== Personal life ==
Faithfull had three miscarriages and four abortions. The first abortion was in 1965, when she had become pregnant by Gene Pitney; the procedure was still illegal in the United Kingdom at the time and Faithfull stated that she had a hard time dealing with the guilt. She began to feel better once her son was born the year after. Subsequent terminations were from her period of drug abuse as she did not wish for the children to be born as addicts.

During the 1960s, Faithfull had relationships with both men and women.

=== Health and death ===
In later years, Faithfull&#x27;s touring and work schedule were interrupted by health problems. In late 2004, she called off the European leg of a world tour, promoting &quot;Before the Poison&quot;, after collapsing on stage in Milan, and was hospitalised for exhaustion. In 2005, the tour resumed to include a U.S. leg. In September 2006, she again cancelled a concert tour, this time after receiving a breast cancer diagnosis The following month, she underwent surgery in France, but required no further treatment as the tumour had been caught very early. Less than two months later, she made a public statement of full recovery.

In October 2007, on the UK television program &quot;This Morning&quot;, Faithfull disclosed that she suffered from hepatitis C, which had first been diagnosed 12 years earlier. She discussed both the cancer and hepatitis diagnoses in greater depth in her memoir &quot;Memories, Dreams and Reflections&quot;. On 27 May 2008, she posted the following on her MySpace page, with the headline &quot;Tour Dates Cancelled&quot; (and credited to FR Management, the company operated by her boyfriend/manager François Ravard): &quot;Due to general mental, physical, and nervous exhaustion, doctors have ordered Marianne Faithfull to immediately cease all work activities and rehabilitate. The treatment and recovery should last around six months.&quot;

In August 2013, Faithfull was forced to cancel a string of concerts in the U.S. and Lebanon, after a back injury during a holiday trip in California.

On 30 May 2014, Faithfull suffered a broken hip after a fall while vacationing on the Greek island of Rhodes and underwent surgery. Afterwards, an infection developed, causing Faithfull to cancel or postpone parts of her 50th anniversary tour, so that she could receive additional surgery and rehabilitation.

In 2016, she revealed she had emphysema, a lung disease induced by smoking, and needed to use inhaled medication daily. She continued to smoke, however, and was not able to quit until 2019, later regretting that she had not done so sooner.

On 4 April 2020, it was announced that Faithfull was hospitalised in London for pneumonia following a positive COVID-19 test. Her management company reported that she was &quot;stable and responding to treatment.&quot; On 21 April, following a three-week stay, she was discharged from the hospitalisation. In a brief statement, she publicly thanked the hospital staff for, &quot;without a doubt,&quot; saving her life. She initially thought she would be unable to sing again after the effects of the coronavirus on her lungs, and she continued to suffer memory loss because of it. She worked on her breathing and undertook singing practice as a part of her recovery.

Faithfull died in London on 30 January 2025, at the age of 78.

<text>Safeway Limited is a British groceries brand, and former chain of supermarkets and convenience shops. The British Safeway was founded in 1962 by the American Safeway Inc., before being sold to Argyll Foods in 1987. It was later listed on the London Stock Exchange. It was purchased by Morrisons in March 2004. Most of its 479 shops were rebranded as Morrisons, with others being sold. Safeway-branded shops disappeared from the United Kingdom on 24 November 2005.

In November 2016, Morrisons revived the Safeway brand for a range of products, manufactured in the company&#x27;s own factories, for distribution through UK independent retailers.

==History==

===Early years===
Safeway Food Stores was established in 1962 in the United Kingdom by the American supermarket chain Safeway, with seven supermarkets and a few smaller stores in Greater London, and its first purpose-built store was opened in Bedford in 1963. It brought many ideas from the US, including larger stores with wider aisles and delicatessens, and a much wider range of products. By 1987, it had 133 shops around the United Kingdom.

===Acquisition by Argyll Foods===

In 1987, Safeway Inc. put Safeway Food Stores up for sale. Argyll Foods eventually secured it for the sum of £681 million, with £600 million raised through a rights issue that was three times oversubscribed. The merger of Argyll and Safeway was hailed by commentators as one of the most successfully integrated retail combinations in the United Kingdom, bringing together Argyll&#x27;s experienced management team, with a strong but somewhat underdeveloped retail brand.

Argyll then began converting the larger Presto supermarkets to the Safeway brand. The Presto name continued on smaller supermarkets in North East England and Scotland for several years and even enjoyed a brief revival in the early 1990s, when several new Presto shops began to open and a range of Presto own label products was introduced. The last new Presto shops opened in 1995. The revival was short lived, as in 1995, many smaller Presto shops were sold to a consortium of SPAR retailers.

Over the next few years, competitive pressures intensified. Pre tax profits fell by 13% during the year ended 30 April 1994, prompting a wide-ranging strategic review known as &quot;Safeway 2000&quot;, led by the then chief executive, Colin Smith, with assistance from McKinsey Consulting. This involved the sale of the Lo-Cost chain to Co-operative Retail Services and the redesign of Safeway shops to appeal to the family shopper.

In July 1996, Argyll conducted a share buyback and renamed itself Safeway plc. During 1997, several Presto stores were converted to Safeways, and by the beginning of 1998, the final Presto shops were either converted or closed down. All shops traded simply as Safeway, regardless of size.

David Webster, who had taken over as chairman in 1997, after the retirement of Alistair Grant, decided to open merger talks with Asda. These talks were called off after a few weeks following a leak to a Sunday newspaper, and then briefly revived in the early months of 1998, before breaking down again.

The outcome, if the negotiations had been successful, would probably have been the disappearance of the Safeway name and the emergence of a stronger Asda, still focussing on discount prices, but with a bigger volume to support it. This might have achieved a more secure future for Safeway, than continuing the struggle to keep up with Tesco and Sainsbury&#x27;s.

Safeway was the first of the large supermarket groups to introduce a loyalty card, which it launched in 1995 and called ABC (Added Bonus Card). As this was initially only introduced into selected shops on a trial basis, Tesco is able to claim the title for the first nationwide introduction of a loyalty card, with Clubcard.

Safeway, in 1999, started a rail container flow carrying goods to its far north shops, some as far as Inverness, Nairn, Elgin and Buckie. The train consisted of van wagons and containers. The train was operated by EWS.

===&quot;New Safeway&quot;===
By early 1999 Safeway was coming under renewed criticism from investors. Its shares had under-performed in the food sector over the previous five years. It had been pushed back into fourth position by Asda and it did not have enough shops of adequate size to offer a comprehensive non-food range. In July 1999, Safeway announced the appointment of a new chief executive, Carlos Criado-Perez, who had held senior posts in Wal-Mart&#x27;s international division.

The problem was how to distinguish Safeway from Tesco and Sainsbury&#x27;s, and how to minimise its scale disadvantage. According to estimates made by the Competition Commission, Tesco was able to negotiate significantly lower prices from its suppliers than Safeway – averaging about 3% on big selling branded items.

Criado-Perez&#x27;s response was to introduce selective deep discounting, the so-called high/low pricing formula, which was later branded as &#x27;substantially discredited&#x27; by Morrisons management, making deep price cuts on a limited set of products for a limited period. Criado-Perez also abandoned Safeway&#x27;s loyalty card, arguing that these cards were no longer an effective marketing tool. This project was branded &#x27;New Safeway&#x27;.

The new approach to pricing was one of the four pillars of Safeway&#x27;s strategy, the others being &quot;Best for Fresh Foods&quot;, &quot;Best for Customer Service&quot; and &quot;Best for Product Availability&quot;. Criado-Perez envisaged a five-year programme of developing the shops along these lines, to be completed by 2004.

In 2002, Safeway was the fourth largest supermarket chain by sales in the United Kingdom. It was growing more slowly than other large chains in the United Kingdom and this was reflected in a share price below the values of the group&#x27;s assets, leading to the various takeover rumours that circulated during 2002, indicating the City was unconvinced with the Criado-Perez strategy.

===Morrisons takeover===

On 9 January 2003, the much smaller Morrisons, with around 119 shops largely located in the North of England, made a surprise offer to purchase the chain, offering 1.32 new shares of Morrisons for each share of Safeway, with the co-operation of the Safeway board. This served to start a stampede of other potential buyers. Sainsbury&#x27;s, Asda, KKR (the company which helped finance the sale of Safeway to Argyll in 1987), Trackdean Investments Limited (controlled by Philip Green, owner of BHS and Arcadia) and Tesco all said they were considering making offers.

They were all asked to make submissions to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) for approval under the Fair Trading Act 1973. On 23 January, Safeway&#x27;s board dropped its recommendation of the Morrisons offer. KKR later dropped its proposal. On 19 March, the remaining proposals except for Trackdean&#x27;s (which was said to raise no competition issues) were referred to the Competition Commission by the Trade and Industry Secretary, Patricia Hewitt. The report of the Competition Commission was made public on 26 September.

A takeover of Safeway by Sainsbury&#x27;s, Asda or Tesco was &quot;expected to operate against the public interest, and should be prohibited&quot;. However, a takeover by Morrisons was held to be acceptable on the condition that 53 shops of the combined operation be sold, due to local competition issues. Patricia Hewitt accepted these recommendations.

Philip Green announced on 30 October that he was not proceeding with a takeover bid, on the basis that it was not clear whether approval could be obtained to sell off individual shops to other chains. On 15 December, Morrisons, the only remaining bidder, made a new offer of one share of Morrisons, plus sixty pence for each Safeway share, again with the co-operation of the Safeway board. On 11 February 2004, shareholders of both Wm Morrison and Safeway voted to approve the merger of the two companies, subject to the result of two High Court rulings later in the month.

===Shop disposals===
Originally, 52 shops were to be compulsorily divested after the takeover, but this was reduced to 50 after one shop in Sunderland burned down and the lease ended on another in Leeds city centre. John Lewis Partnership purchased 19 to be part of its Waitrose chain, while Sainsbury&#x27;s purchased a further 14 , and Tesco bought 10 in October 2004.

Unlike other operators, most notably Tesco, Sainsbury&#x27;s and the Co-op, Morrisons had chosen not to move into the convenience shop sector. Further to this policy decision, it was announced in October 2004 that the 114 smaller shops of Safeway Compact were to be sold off to rival supermarket chain Somerfield, in a two part deal worth £260.2 million in total.

In Northern Ireland, Morrisons sold former Safeway shops to Asda. These included a shop in Bangor, which actually opened after the takeover by Morrisons, in June 2005.

Morrisons continued to sell and close shops not covered by the Competition Commission ruling, which it felt did not fit with the scale and layout of its format of &quot;Market Street&quot;. In total, 254 shops were sold off by October 2005, which left the chain with around 367 shops by November 2005. In all, seventy two shops were sold that were neither part of the original Competition Commission ruling nor part of the Safeway Compact portfolio.

One of the largest single purchases in 2005 was that of five shops by Waitrose in August. On 18 July 2005, a further six shops were sold to Waitrose, including the former Safeway shop in Hexham, Northumberland, which became the most northerly Waitrose branch in England.

In May 2005, Morrisons announced the termination of Safeway&#x27;s joint-venture forecourt shop/petrol station format with BP. Under the deal, the premises were split 50/50 between the two companies. Five sites were subsequently sold on to BP, while Morrisons sold the rest of its sites to Somerfield and Tesco, which both maintain a presence in this market sector. Following the termination of the BP/Safeway deal, BP began to roll out Marks and Spencer food forecourt shops in their place from 2005, with the network expanding over subsequent years.

Morrisons also sold Safeway&#x27;s Channel Islands shops, in Guernsey and Jersey, to CI Traders, where they continued to trade under the Safeway brand name, despite selling products from chains such as Iceland. In February 2011, CI Traders sold the Safeway shops on the Channel Islands to Waitrose and the Safeway brand disappeared from the Channel Islands.

On the Isle of Man, the Douglas shop was sold to Shoprite and the Ramsey shop was sold to the Co-op. The shop in Gibraltar was originally marketed for sale, but was then converted. In November 2005, plans were submitted for the extension and redevelopment of the shop, in order to introduce the full Morrisons format.

In September 2005, the company announced the closure of former Safeway depots in Kent, Bristol and Warrington, with the loss of around 2,500 jobs. The Kent depot was later sold to Waitrose, whilst the Warrington depot was sold to Iceland. Part of the Bristol depot was sold off to Gist. The shop conversion process was completed on 24 November 2005, when the last Safeway fascia disappeared from the United Kingdom.

===Partial brand revival===
In November 2016, Morrisons announced a revival of the Safeway brand, on food products that it manufactures for retailers. This was followed by McColl&#x27;s signing an agreement to stock Safeway-branded products in its nationwide chain of small-format convenience stores in August 2017.

A trial of a branded Safeway Daily convenience store was unveiled at a petrol station forecourt in Derby during 2019, but the location did not retain the brand long term.

<text>Wm Morrison Supermarkets Limited, trading as Morrisons, is the fifth largest supermarket chain in the United Kingdom. As of 2021, the company had 497 supermarkets across England, Wales and Scotland, and one in Gibraltar. The company is headquartered in Bradford, England.

Founded in 1899 by William Morrison, hence the contraction Wm Morrison, it began as an egg and butter stall in Rawson Market, Bradford. Until 2004, its store locations were focused in the North of England but with the takeover of Safeway in that year, the company&#x27;s presence increased significantly in the South of England, Wales and Scotland. As of February 2021, Morrisons employed 110,000 employees and served around 11 million customers each week.

The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange until it was acquired by private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice (CD&amp;R) in October 2021. Many changes were made after the takeover, and the company was struggling financially.

Morrisons is the fifth largest supermarket in the United Kingdom by market share (8.6%), overtaken for fourth place by Aldi in September 2022.

==History==

===Founding===
The company was founded in June 1899 by William Morrison, who started the business as an egg and butter merchant in Rawson Market, Bradford, England, operating under the name of &quot;Wm Morrison Limited&quot;.

His son Ken Morrison took over the company in 1952, aged 21. In 1958, Morrisons opened a small shop in the city centre. It was the first self-service store in Bradford, the first store to have prices on its products, and it had three checkouts. The company opened its first supermarket, &quot;Victoria&quot;, in the Girlington district of Bradford in 1961.

In 1967, Morrisons became a public limited company listed on the London Stock Exchange.

===Safeway===
In March 2004, Morrisons acquired Safeway, a British supermarket chain which owned 479 stores, giving Morrisons a larger presence in southern England. The company was purchased for £3.3 billion, comprising 1 new Morrisons share (enabling Safeway shareholders to have a 50% stake in the enlarged group and reducing the Morrison family&#x27;s shareholding to 18%), plus 60 pence in cash (paid for by the divestment of 52 overlapping stores) for each Safeway share held. The acquisition quickly ran into difficulties caused in part by changing the accounting systems six weeks before the transaction was completed, leading to a series of profit warnings being issued by Morrisons, poor financial results and a reversion to manual systems.

The programme of store conversions from Safeway to Morrisons was the largest of its kind in British retail history, focusing initially on the retained stores which were freehold, over with separate car parks. Within a few weeks, Safeway carrier bags were replaced by those of Morrisons, and Morrisons own-brand products began to appear in Safeway stores.

Originally 52 shops were to be compulsorily divested after the takeover. Two closed for other reasons, John Lewis Partnership purchased 19 to be part of its Waitrose chain, J Sainsbury plc purchased a further 14, and Tesco bought 10 in October 2004. At the time Morrisons chose not to move into the convenience store sector, although it later did so with its M Local stores. In accordance with this policy decision, 114 smaller &#x27;Safeway Compact&#x27; stores were sold to rival supermarket chain Somerfield in 2004 in a two-part deal worth £260.2 million.

In 2004, the first Morrisons store in Scotland was officially opened in Kilmarnock. In Northern Ireland Morrisons sold the Safeway stores, and a store in Bangor that opened after the Morrisons takeover, to Asda. Waitrose purchased five stores in 2005, followed by six more on 18 July 2006, including the former Safeway store in Hexham, Northumberland, which became England&#x27;s most northerly Waitrose branch. In May 2005, Morrisons announced the closure of Safeway and BP joint venture convenience store/petrol station. Under the deal, the premises had been split 50/50 between the two companies.

Morrisons also sold Safeway&#x27;s Channel Islands stores, in Guernsey and Jersey, to CI Traders where the stores continued to trade as Safeway, although the products they sold carried the brand names of chains such as Iceland. In 2011, Sandpiper CI/CI Traders sold the Channel Island Safeway stores to Waitrose, and the Safeway brand disappeared from the Channel Islands. On the Isle of Man, the Douglas store was sold to Shoprite and the Ramsey store was sold to The Co-operative Food. The Gibraltar store was originally offered for sale, but was ultimately converted. In November 2006, plans were submitted for the extension and redevelopment of the store to introduce the full Morrisons format.

In September 2005, the company announced the closure of former Safeway depots in Kent, Bristol and Warrington with the loss of 2,500 jobs. The Kent depot was later sold to upmarket rival Waitrose, and the Warrington one to frozen food rival Iceland. Part of the Bristol depot was sold to Gist.
The store conversion process was completed on 24 November 2005 when the final Safeway fascia disappeared from the UK.

===Morrison family step down===
Following the acquisition of Safeway, Morrisons encountered a number of difficulties. The company had issued five profits warnings since the acquisition, and it was felt that Morrisons&#x27; &quot;northern&quot; format did not work as well in the south. To reinvigorate its new national image, Morrisons appointed Dutchman Marc Bolland, the chief operating officer of Heineken, as its new Chief Executive.

On 13 March 2008, Sir Ken Morrison retired as chairman after 55 years at the company, and was made Honorary President.

===Expansion and partnerships===
When the Co-operative Group completed its takeover of the Somerfield supermarket chain in March 2009, it was required to sell a number of stores by the Competition Commission. Morrisons purchased 35 stores from the combined group, mostly trading under the Somerfield name. These new stores were the first of more than 100 identified by Morrisons for expansion into smaller supermarkets, with the aim of having a store within 15 minutes of every UK home.
Marc Bolland departed to become the CEO of Marks &amp; Spencer in December 2009, and Dalton Philips was appointed as his replacement in January 2010.

In 2010, Morrisons signed a deal with budget retailer Peacocks, the first concession store opened as part of a refurbishment at the retailer&#x27;s store in Idle, Bradford. The Peacocks section was rolled out into other stores before launching its own children&#x27;s-wear brand &#x27;Nutmeg&#x27; into 85 stores on 21 March 2013.

The first Morrisons M local store opened in Ilkley, Yorkshire, in 2011. All M Local stores were later rebranded as the short-lived &quot;My Local&quot; chain in 2015.

In December 2012, a television advertising campaign which showed a dog being given pieces of Christmas pudding was criticised by the British Veterinary Association and the Kennel Club, as raisins are harmful to dogs. Morrisons said that veterinarian advice they received said that there would be minimal risk.

In May 2013, Morrisons formed a partnership with Ocado to use its technology systems and distribution infrastructure to help launch its own online service.

===Restructuring===
Richard Pennycook, who had joined Morrisons in October 2005, was replaced as Chief Financial Officer at Morrisons in June 2013 by Trevor Strain, previously Finance Director Corporate.

In February 2014, it emerged that younger members of the founding Morrison family, who own 10% of the company and who are thought to include two of Honorary President Sir Ken Morrison&#x27;s children, William Morrison Junior and Andrea Shelley, along with Sir Ken Morrison&#x27;s niece and her husband, Susan and Nigel Pritchard, had approached a number of private equity firms about taking the company private. They were said to be unhappy about the company&#x27;s financial performance, and Dalton Philips&#x27;s corporate strategy.

Following a new three-year corporate strategy revealed in March 2014 aimed at recovering sales and market share, at Morrisons Annual General Meeting in June 2014 Morrisons former chairman Sir Ken Morrison criticised Dalton Philips&#x27;s approach. Morrison&#x27;s nephew Chris Blundell, who controls most of the remaining family stake in the supermarket, agreed, telling told the board it needed rescuing, and welcomed the decision by chairman Sir Ian Gibson to leave the business in June 2015.

In June 2014, Morrisons announced that plans had been put in place to cut 2,600 jobs as a result of changes to its management structure. Morrisons stated that it had trialled the new structure and believed that better performance was achieved via these methods. These cuts would primarily affect department manager and supervisory positions. Morrisons claimed they would create 1,000 jobs in Morrisons M local convenience stores and 3,000 in new supermarkets. Following this, Morrisons sold its distribution centre in Kent to a real estate investment company for £97.8 million. The depot in Kemsley was to be immediately leased back to the supermarket chain on a 25-year agreement, for a rent of £5.4 million per annum.

Following a 3.1% drop in like-for-like sales in the Christmas 2014 trading period, Sir Ian Gibson stood down six months early and was replaced by former Tesco chief financial officer Andrew Higginson at the end of January 2015. On 25 February 2015, Morrisons named former Tesco director David Potts as its new chief executive. Dalton Philips and five other executives also left the company in March 2015. 

Morrisons also announced the closure of ten loss-making stores (eight former Netto UK stores and two former Somerfield stores, bought under Philips&#x27;s leadership) in Cramlington, Accrington, Ravensthorpe, Bransholme (Hull), Telford, West Bromwich, Wallasey (Seacombe), Newton le Willows, Rugby and Crawley. In addition, six unprofitable convenience stores would close, and the roll-out of the convenience store chain would be slowed, as a batch of 40 sites would no longer be bought.

In June 2015, Morrisons cut the price of 200 &#x27;everyday items&#x27; by up to 33% The store chain&#x27;s like-for-like sales had fallen by 2.9% in the first three months of 2015, after falling 2.6% in the last three months of 2014. The company responded by deciding to &#x27;simplify&#x27; its head office in Bradford at the cost of 720 jobs.

In September 2015, Morrisons announced the sale of its 140 M Local stores to Mike Greene and Greybull Capital, to be re-branded My Local, for £25 million and that it planned to close 11 supermarkets, with a reported 900 jobs lost. In January 2016 Morrisons bosses announced that a further 7 stores would be closing to help optimise their existing assets and address areas of underperformance.

Following a well-publicised crash in UK milk prices in November 2015, Morrisons launched a variety milk labelled &#x27;For Farmers&#x27;, with a large Union Jack on the label, claiming an extra 23p per 4-pint bottle would to be given to farmers – 10p per litre. Following complaints, Morrisons admitted that the extra money was actually paid to the supplier of the milk, Arla Foods, to be divided among several countries, with only a fifth of the 23p going to UK farmers. Morrisons later changed the scheme in 2017 such that the total additional payment went directly to a selected group of 300 British farmers. A smaller group of 50 farmers were tasked with supplying the range, with additional welfare standards applied to the production of the milk.

From March 2020, the company aimed to cut down 3,000 management roles, and created 7,000 shop-floor jobs as part of its restructuring plan.

In December 2020, Morrisons was criticised for retaining Paula Vennells on its board, despite her role as CEO of the Post Office during the subpostmasters&#x27; scandal and criticism of her leadership there as &quot;both cruel and incompetent&quot; by a Conservative peer and various MPs. Vennells eventually left her role as a non-executive director on 26 April 2021.

On 16 August 2021, a worker led a protest against the company for raising deformed birds at four of its intensive farms. &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that campaigners from Open Cages, Animal Equality UK and The Humane League UK were urging Morrisons to sign the Better Chicken Commitment (BCC), banning the use of fast-growing breeds susceptible to lameness and heart attacks, and giving birds natural light and more space. The company responded that they cared about animal welfare, required suppliers to maintain standards, and had asked for a full investigation.

===CD&amp;R takeover===
In June 2021, Morrisons rejected a £5.5 billion takeover bid from private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice (CD&amp;R) believing it &quot;significantly undervalued&quot; the company.

In July 2021 a bid to take over Morrisons, led by US private equity firm, Fortress Investment Group and backed by the Canada Pension Plan and Koch Industries, valuing the company at £6.3 billion ($8.7 billion), was made. This bid was provisionally accepted by the board, subject to shareholder approval, on 3 July 2021. Following the Fortress bid, Apollo Global were considering a bid, leading to speculation of a bidding war, but Apollo Global withdrew and supported the Fortress bid. On 6 August 2021, the Fortress-led consortium increased its offer to £6.7 billion ($9.29 billion) after Silchester International Investors, Morrisons largest shareholder, said the previous offer was too low. The Morrisons board once again recommended the deal to shareholders. However, on 19 August 2021 an improved offer of £7 billion from CD&amp;R was recommended by the board of Morrisons to shareholders; the board dropped its recommendation for Fortress&#x27;s offer.

In October 2021 the £7 billion CD&amp;R bid was accepted; the takeover was approved by the High Court on 26 October 2021.

In May 2022, Morrisons purchased McColl&#x27;s in a pre-packaged insolvency arrangement with its administrator, with all stores eventually converting to the Morrisons Daily fascia.

In February 2023, 16 months after the CD&amp;R takeover of the 124-year-old chain, it was reported as having &quot;fallen into a hole that just keeps getting deeper&quot;.

The chain&#x27;s underlying profits had dropped by 15% to £828 million in the year ending 30 October; sales dropped by 4.2% despite prices increasing sharply—implying an even greater loss in volume of sales—for a pre-tax loss of £33 million. Morrisons&#x27; net debt obligations had been £3.2bn before the CD&amp;R takeover, and had increased to £7.5 billion. A former senior Morrisons executive said &quot;[CD&amp;R] paid too much and now they have to claw that back&quot;. Unlike any other UK supermarket, Morrisons has a manufacturing arm including abattoirs, vegetable packing houses and fish processing plants comprising a vertically integrated supply chain. An industry insider suggested that this may be sold, which would mean a complete change of course for the company.

On 6 November 2023 Rami Baitiéh succeeded David Potts as Chief Executive.

==Financial performance==
The financial results have been as follows:
==Current operations==

In July 2020, Morrisons had 497 superstores in the United Kingdom, including those it retained following its purchase of Safeway plc. Until 2004, Morrisons superstores were largely concentrated in the English Midlands and the North of England, but had expanded southwards, beginning with a store at Erith, Greater London, which opened in 1998.

In April 2021, Morrisons said that it would replace plastic bags with paper bags to cut plastic use.

===Store formats===
Most Morrisons superstores have produce in &quot;Market Street&quot;. Packaged meat is near or next to a butcher&#x27;s counter, a delicatessen with cheese fridge is nearby, and there is a rotisserie counter named &quot;Oven Fresh&quot;.

=== Convenience stores ===
Following the failure of the supermarket&#x27;s M Local stores, Morrisons returned to the convenience market in 2016 with a new chain of five trial forecourt stores under the Morrisons Daily brand in partnership with Motor Fuel Group. Soon after in 2017, this trial ended with the stores closed and a new partnership was formed with Rontec to open 40 stores across the company&#x27;s forecourts. In 2019, Morrisons Daily stores operated by MPK Garages and Essar began to trade under a similar deal. 

In 2018, Morrisons agreed on a franchise and wholesale supply deal with SandpiperCI to operate 43 Morrisons Daily convenience stores in the Channel Islands, which were previously operated under the Nisa brand. By 2022, SandpiperCI had converted 19 of their stores in the Channel Islands to the Morrisons Daily format, including the former Benest&#x27;s of Millbrook store at Lisbon House.

A partnership agreement in 2021 saw Morrisons and McColl&#x27;s committing to the conversion of 300 existing McColl&#x27;s convenience stores into Morrisons Daily stores over the next three years, following a successful trial of 30 conversions in the months prior. This extension is of a deal, first struck in 2017, which saw Morrisons acting as McColl&#x27;s sole supplier until at least 2027, with the supermarket supplying over 1,200 of their stores. Morrisons converted all McColl&#x27;s stores to the Morrisons Daily fascia by September 2024.

Morrisons revived the Safeway brand in 2016 for use in stores of its wholesale customers and in Morrisons Daily stores, along with two MPK Garages forecourt stores which operate with Safeway Daily branding.

===Online retail===
In 2012, the group launched its first retail website called &quot;Morrisons Cellar&quot; selling wine from around the world.

Unlike its competitors, Morrisons did not offer online shopping for many years. In May 2013 Morrisons announced a partnership with Ocado to use its technology systems and distribution infrastructure to help launch its own online service. Morrisons also signed a deal with Amazon to supply products for their Prime Pantry.

===Market share===

Morrisons&#x27; UK market share declined steadily since 2019; in January 2025 it was 8.6% – behind Tesco (28.5%), Sainsbury&#x27;s (15.9%), Asda (12.6%) and Aldi (10.2%), and ahead of Lidl (7.2%).

According to CACI, as of 2006, Morrisons had market dominance in 10 postcode areas, half of which were in its home county of Yorkshire; SY (Shrewsbury), LD (Llandrindod Wells), WS (Walsall),
TS (Teesside), TD (Hawick), BD (Bradford), HG (Harrogate), LS (Leeds), WF (Wakefield) and HD (Huddersfield).

===Vertical integration===
Morrisons produce more than half of its products in-house.

=== Home-delivery service ===

Morrisons now offer a home delivery service, as do most UK supermarkets.

In June 2020, at an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom Morrisons, introduced a home delivery program with telephone ordering for elderly and vulnerable people, limited to those residing within 10 miles of a Morrisons shop. Morrison&#x27;s Doorstep Delivery continued to be available, with some changes (in particular, a limit of three items per order to prevent stockpiling was dropped), after pandemic restrictions were removed.

=== Petrol stations ===
Morrisons operate 339 petrol stations across the UK (as of 2022), offering Petrol &amp; Diesel at all sites and LPG Autogas at selected sites. Most petrol stations are located in the car park area within selected stores, but there are also a number of standalone petrol stations operated by either Morrisons Daily or Morrisons Select.

Over the years, Morrisons petrol stations underwent several different re-brands and colour schemes. These were:
==== Fuel cards ====
For many years until 2014, Morrisons petrol stations provided a loyalty card scheme known as the Miles card. Each member earned 10 points whenever they purchased a litre of fuel, along with a £5 shopping voucher if they bought a total of 500 litres or more. This was replaced by the Match &amp; More card in 2014, followed by the More card in 2016 and My Morrisons in 2021, later rebranded as Morrisons More with deals such as Fiver, where purchases give customers points, 5000 points being worth £5 in 2023.

Morrisons also offer the fuelGenie fuel card scheme.

== Former operations ==

===Kiddicare===
In 2011, Morrisons bought children&#x27;s retailer Kiddicare for £70 million to give it the knowledge to sell clothing and homewares online. In 2012 10 former Best Buy stores from the Carphone Warehouse were acquired to expand Kiddicare into retail stores. Kiddicare was sold to the Endless private equity firm for £2 million in July 2014, and sold on to Worldstores two months later for an undisclosed sum.

===FreshDirect===
Morrisons purchased a 10% stake in New York-based online grocer FreshDirect for £31 million in 2011. After having sent a team to New York to learn from the business ahead of the predicted launch in 2013, Morrisons began a home delivery initiative in January 2014. In March 2014 Morrisons CEO Dalton Phillips announced the company had agreed to sell its stake in FreshDirect due to financial difficulties the company was facing and, as it had set up its own online shopping site, it no longer needed FreshDirect. The sale was completed in August 2016 for £45 million.

===Convenience stores===

The company operated a number of smaller stores called &quot;Morrisons M Local&quot; in major places such as Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff and Bristol. These stores had a similar format to small Tesco Express and Sainsbury&#x27;s Local stores, but included a wider range of ready-to-eat hot food such as pastries, coffee, rotisserie, porridge and also a salad bar. Items were supplied from nearby superstores and shoppers could also order foods, including fresh meat and fish.

A distribution centre in Feltham, West London was acquired to provide a distribution network to the stores in London and the South East where there are relatively few Morrisons superstores.

Around 70 stores were opened by the end of 2013, boosted by the purchase of 7 Jessops and 49 Blockbuster stores from administrators. On 26 February 2013, a further six HMV stores were acquired from administrators. The M Local chain was sold to a private equity group in 2015 and rebranded My Local, but entered administration itself less than a year later.

==Marketing and branding==
===Logos and slogans===

On 15 March 2007, Morrisons unveiled what they proclaimed as a &quot;more modern brand image&quot;, which was rolled out to all stores, vehicles and distribution sites. This kept the main &#x27;Morrisons&#x27; signage and colour scheme, while replacing the familiar &#x27;M&#x27; logo. The low price in-house brand, &quot;Bettabuy&quot;, was also changed to a &#x27;more modern&#x27; brand called &quot;Morrisons Value&quot;, which was again rebranded to &quot;M Savers&quot; in January 2012.
The change saw the replacement of the old yellow and black logo, with the &#x27;More Reasons To Shop at Morrisons&#x27; strap line replaced with &#x27;Fresh Choice For You&#x27;. In 2010 this was replaced by &#x27;Eat Fresh. Pay Less&#x27;. This was later changed again in 2013 to &#x27;More Of What Matters&#x27;. It also involved the replacement of external signage, with the previous &quot;Morrisons&quot; signs being retained alongside the new logo, as well as changes to product packaging, point of sale, advertising, staff uniforms (replacing the old blue ties and bows with green ones) and distribution vehicles. The rationale behind the decision was the need for Morrisons to attract a wider national customer base, capitalising on its expanded geographical spread following the acquisition of Safeway.

In 2015, Morrisons released a new logo and slogan &#x27;Morrisons Makes It&#x27; to try and draw on the brand&#x27;s heritage, with the new logo being installed on all store signs as well as new uniforms and new in-store looks.

In May 2023, Morrisons launched a new advertising campaign which saw the old &#x27;More Reasons to Shop at Morrisons&#x27; slogan and jingle being revived.

===Loyalty card===
The Match &amp; More card, introduced in 2014, price matched the chain&#x27;s customers&#x27; comparable grocery shopping in store and online with Aldi, Lidl, Tesco, Sainsbury&#x27;s and Asda. If a customer spent £15 or more and could have paid less for their comparable groceries, Morrisons automatically gave them the difference in points on their card at the checkout. For 1p difference in the cost of shopping, customers got 10 Match points—and for £1 difference they got 1,000 points. The difference was calculated at the checkout on national brands and comparable own label products and fresh food, even those that are on promotion elsewhere. In 2016 the Match &amp; More loyalty cards were rebranded as the &quot;More&quot; loyalty card and all customers were issued a new card in line with the rebranding. The loyalty scheme was rebranded once again in May 2021 as &quot;My Morrisons&quot;, in line with the company dropping the points collection feature.
The Morrisons More loyalty scheme was reintroduced on 22 May 2023, replacing My Morrisons. This latest change to their loyalty card format - the fourth in less than ten years - to the original Match &amp; More scheme announced in 2014.

===Product ranges===
Morrisons stocks thousands of lines sold under their own brands. These include Morrisons Savers, formerly M Savers, an economy brand including items ranging from food and drink to toiletries, in 2015 the UK&#x27;s fastest-growing grocery brand.

=== Tommy&#x27;s Afternoon Tea Box ===
Morrisons launched a special &#x27;Tommy&#x27;s Afternoon Tea Box&#x27; to support shoppers wishing to mark the end of World War Two anniversary on 2 September 2020. The boxes benefitted the Tommy Tea initiative through the Royal British Legion Industries (RBLI), with £1 on every box heading to the charity, as well as an additional £10,000 provided by the company.

==Distribution==
In 2005, Morrisons purchased part of the collapsed Rathbones Bakeries, which supplied Morrisons bread, for £15.5 million.

In 2007, Morrisons opened a new Distribution Centre in Swindon and announced that it had bought a new site on Junction 23 of the M5 in Bridgwater in Somerset, for redevelopment as a fresh produce packing facility.

In 2011, Morrisons opened a new 767,500 sq/foot distribution centre in Bridgwater as part of the £11 million redevelopment project. This project also created 1,200 new jobs. Following the opening of the new distribution centre the Swindon depot was no longer required, and it was closed in December 2011.

<text>Salvatore Mineo Jr. (January 10, 1939 – February 12, 1976) was an American actor. He was best known for his role as John &quot;Plato&quot; Crawford in the drama film &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955), which earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor at age 17, making him the fifth-youngest nominee in the category.

Mineo also starred in films such as &quot;Crime in the Streets&quot;, &quot;Giant&quot; (both 1956), &quot;Exodus&quot; (1960), for which he won a Golden Globe and received a second Academy Award nomination, &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962), John Ford&#x27;s final western &quot;Cheyenne Autumn&quot; (1964) and &quot;Escape from the Planet of the Apes&quot; (1971).

== Early life and education ==
Mineo was born in The Bronx, New York City, the son of coffin makers Josephine (née Alvisi; 1913–1989) and Salvatore Mineo Sr (1913–1972). He was of Sicilian descent; his father was born in Italy and his mother, of Italian origin, was born in the United States. Mineo&#x27;s sister Sarina (1941–2024), brothers Michael (1937–1984) and Victor (1935–2015) were also actors. He attended the Quintano School for Young Professionals and was one of the few Italian-American actors of his era to keep his surname, saying he was proud of his heritage and identity.

==Acting career==
===Child actor===
Mineo&#x27;s mother enrolled him in dancing and acting school at an early age. He had his first stage appearance in Tennessee Williams&#x27;s play &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; (1951). He also played the young prince opposite Yul Brynner in the stage musical &quot;The King and I&quot;. Brynner took the opportunity to help Mineo better himself as an actor.

On May 8, 1954, Mineo portrayed the Page (lip-synching to the voice of mezzo-soprano Carol Jones) in the NBC Opera Theatre&#x27;s production of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot; (in English translation), set to Oscar Wilde&#x27;s play. Elaine Malbin performed the title role, and Peter Herman Adler conducted Kirk Browning&#x27;s production.

As a teenager, Mineo appeared on ABC&#x27;s musical quiz program &quot;Jukebox Jury&quot;. Mineo made several television appearances before making his screen debut in the Joseph Pevney film &quot;Six Bridges to Cross&quot; (1955). He beat out Clint Eastwood for the role. Mineo also successfully auditioned for a part in &quot;The Private War of Major Benson&quot; (1955), as a cadet colonel opposite Charlton Heston.

===&quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; and stardom===

Mineo&#x27;s breakthrough as an actor came in &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955), in which he played John &quot;Plato&quot; Crawford, a sensitive teenager smitten with main character Jim Stark (played by James Dean). Mineo&#x27;s performance resulted in an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and he became the fifth-youngest nominee in the category, at the age of 17. Mineo&#x27;s biographer Paul Jeffers recounted that Mineo received thousands of letters from young female fans, was mobbed by them at public appearances, and further wrote: &quot;He dated the most beautiful women in Hollywood and New York City.&quot;

In &quot;Giant&quot; (1956), Mineo played Angel Obregon II, a Mexican boy killed in World War II. Many of his subsequent roles were variations of his role in &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;, and he was typecast as a troubled teen. In the Disney adventure &quot;Tonka&quot; (1958), for instance, Mineo starred as a young Sioux named White Bull who traps and domesticates a clear-eyed, spirited wild horse named Tonka that becomes the famous Comanche, the lone survivor of Custer&#x27;s Last Stand.
By the late 1950s, Mineo was a major celebrity. He was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Switchblade Kid&quot;, a nickname he earned from his role as a criminal in the movie &quot;Crime in the Streets&quot; (1956).

In 1957, Mineo made a brief foray into pop music by recording a handful of songs and an album. Two of his singles reached the Top 40 in the United States&#x27; &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The more popular of the two, &quot;Start Movin&#x27; (In My Direction)&quot;, reached No. 9 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s pop chart. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. He starred as drummer Gene Krupa in the movie &quot;The Gene Krupa Story&quot; (1959), directed by Don Weis with Susan Kohner, James Darren, and Susan Oliver. He appeared as the celebrity guest challenger on the June 30, 1957, episode of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;

Mineo made an effort to break his typecasting. In addition to his roles as an Indian brave in &quot;Tonka&quot; (1958), and a Mexican boy in &quot;Giant&quot; (1956), he played a Jewish Holocaust survivor in &quot;Exodus&quot; (1960); for his work in &quot;Exodus&quot;, he won a Golden Globe Award and received his second Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

=== Career shift ===
By the early 1960s, Mineo was becoming too old to play the type of role that had made him famous, and rumors of his homosexuality led to his being considered inappropriate for leading roles. For example, he auditioned for David Lean&#x27;s film &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962) but was not hired. Mineo appeared in &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962), in which he played a private killed by a German after the landing in Sainte-Mère-Église. Mineo was baffled by his sudden loss of popularity, later saying: &quot;One minute it seemed I had more movie offers than I could handle; the next, no one wanted me.&quot;

Mineo was the model for Harold Stevenson&#x27;s painting &quot;The New Adam&quot; (1963). Now in the Guggenheim Museum&#x27;s permanent collection, the painting is considered &quot;one of the great American nudes&quot;. Mineo also appeared on the Season 2 episode of &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot;: &quot;Patty Meets a Celebrity&quot; (1964).

Mineo&#x27;s role as a stalker in &quot;Who Killed Teddy Bear&quot; (1965), which co-starred Juliet Prowse, did not seem to help his career. Although his performance was praised by critics, he found himself typecast again—this time as a deranged criminal. The high point of this period was his portrayal of Uriah in &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965). Mineo guest-starred in an episode of the TV series &quot;Combat!&quot; in 1966, playing the role of a GI wanted for murder. He did two more appearances on the same show, including appearing in an installment with Fernando Lamas.

In 1969, Mineo returned to the stage to direct a Los Angeles production of the gay-themed play &quot;Fortune and Men&#x27;s Eyes&quot; (1967), featuring then-unknown Don Johnson as Smitty and Mineo as Rocky. The production received positive reviews, although its expanded prison rape scene was criticized as excessive and gratuitous. Mineo&#x27;s last role in a motion picture was a small part in the film &quot;Escape from the Planet of the Apes&quot; (1971); he played the chimpanzee Dr. Milo.

In December 1972, Mineo stage-directed the Gian Carlo Menotti short opera &quot;The Medium&quot; in Detroit. Muriel Costa-Greenspon portrayed the title character, Madame Flora, and Mineo played the mute, Toby. In 1975, Mineo appeared as Rachman Habib, the assistant to a murderous consular head (portrayed by Hector Elizondo) of a Middle Eastern country, in the &quot;Columbo&quot; episode &quot;A Case of Immunity,&quot; on NBC-TV. One of his last roles was a guest spot on the TV series &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; (1975), in which he portrayed a cult leader similar to Charles Manson.

By 1976, Mineo&#x27;s career had begun to turn around. While playing the role of a bisexual burglar in a series of stage performances of the comedy &quot;P.S. Your Cat Is Dead&quot; in San Francisco, Mineo received substantial publicity from many positive reviews; he moved to Los Angeles along with the play.

==Personal life==
In a 1972 interview with Boze Hadleigh, Mineo confirmed his bisexuality.

Mineo met English-born actress Jill Haworth on the set of the film &quot;Exodus&quot; in 1960, in which they portrayed young lovers. Mineo and Haworth were in an on-and-off relationship for many years. They were engaged to be married at one point. According to Mineo biographer Michael Gregg Michaud, Haworth cancelled the engagement after she caught Mineo engaging in sexual relations with a man. The two remained very close friends until Mineo&#x27;s death. Mineo expressed disapproval of Haworth&#x27;s brief relationship with television producer Aaron Spelling, because he was 22 years older than her. One night, when Mineo found Haworth and Spelling at a private Beverly Hills nightclub, he punched Spelling in the face, yelling, &quot;Do you know how old she is? What are you doing with her at your age?&quot;

At the time of his death, he was in a six-year relationship with actor and retired acting coach Courtney Burr III.

==Death==
On the night of February 12, 1976, Mineo returned home from a rehearsal for the play &quot;P.S. Your Cat Is Dead&quot; at 10:00 pm. After parking his car in the carport below his West Hollywood apartment, he was stabbed in the heart by a mugger. Mineo was found lying and bleeding profusely in the parking alley by his neighbor Raymond Evans, who had heard his cries for help, but Mineo was only able to walk a few steps, after which he collapsed immediately. Mineo was pronounced dead at the scene at the age of 37, due to massive hemorrhage.

Lionel Ray Williams, a young pizza delivery man with a long criminal record, was convicted and sentenced in March 1979 to 51 years in prison for killing Mineo and also for committing ten robberies. Although considerable confusion existed as to what witnesses had seen in the dark the night Mineo was murdered, Williams claimed to have had no idea who Mineo was. Corrections officers later said they had overheard Williams admitting to the stabbing. Williams&#x27; wife later confirmed that on the night Mineo died, he had come home with blood on his shirt. After several years of speculation about the motives for the murder,
the police investigation concluded that it was a random robbery. Williams was paroled in 1990 after serving 12 years.

A funeral for Mineo was held at Most Holy Trinity Church, Mamaroneck, on February 17, 1976, and was attended by 250 mourners. Mineo was buried at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York.

<text>Peter and Gordon were a British pop duo, composed of Peter Asher (b. 1944) and Gordon Waller (1945–2009), who achieved international fame in 1964 with their first single, the million-selling &quot;A World Without Love&quot;. The duo had several subsequent hits in America in the British Invasion era, including &quot;I Go to Pieces&quot;, &quot;Lady Godiva&quot;, &quot;Woman&quot;, &quot;True Love Ways&quot; and &quot;Nobody I Know&quot;.

==History==
Peter Asher and his sister Jane were child actors in the 1950s. They played siblings in a 1955 episode of the television series &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;. Jane dated Paul McCartney between 1963 and 1968, and Peter and Gordon recorded several songs written by McCartney but credited to Lennon–McCartney. Those hits included &quot;A World Without Love&quot; (US &amp; UK No. 1), &quot;Nobody I Know&quot; (US No. 12; UK No. 10) and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to See You Again&quot; (US No. 16, but not a hit in the UK).

With &quot;Woman&quot; (1966: US No. 14, UK No. 28), McCartney used the pseudonym Bernard Webb to see if he could have a hit song without his name attached. First pressings of the US Capitol single listed the composer as &quot;A. Smith&quot;. Peter and Gordon also recorded the John Lennon–penned Lennon–McCartney song &quot;If I Fell&quot;, which was previously recorded by the Beatles and released on their 1964 album &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;.

Other hits for the duo included &quot;I Go to Pieces&quot; (US No. 9), written by Del Shannon and given to Peter and Gordon after the two acts toured together. The duo also recorded remakes of Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;True Love Ways&quot; (1965: US No. 14, UK No. 2), and The Teddy Bears&#x27; &quot;To Know Him Is To Love Him&quot;, retitled &quot;To Know You Is To Love You&quot; (1965: US No. 24, UK No. 5).

Peter and Gordon had their last hit in the UK in late 1966 with &quot;Lady Godiva&quot;, which reached No. 16 there (and No. 6 in the US), whilst their success lasted into 1967 in the US, with &quot;Knight in Rusty Armour&quot; and &quot;Sunday for Tea&quot; both registering in the upper reaches of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 that year.

Peter Asher subsequently became head of A&amp;R for Apple Records. He continued his career as a recording executive in California, where he managed and produced Linda Ronstadt and James Taylor throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Asher also produced recordings for Cher, 10,000 Maniacs, and Diana Ross. His daughter, Victoria Asher, is a member of the alternative group Cobra Starship.

In August 2005, Peter and Gordon reunited onstage for the first time in more than 30 years, as part of two tribute concerts for Mike Smith of The Dave Clark Five in New York City. This was followed by full concerts at The Fest for Beatles Fans (formerly Beatlefest) conventions that began the following year. Paul McCartney heard about the reunion shows and sent a message to congratulate them on reuniting. Peter and Gordon told Palmiere at the Las Vegas Festival for Beatles Fans that they were to perform at the 2006 Adopt-A-Minefield show with Paul McCartney, who subsequently cancelled it because of his impending divorce from Heather Mills.

In the spring of 2007 and 2008, Peter and Gordon were featured performers in the EPCOT &quot;Flower Power&quot; concert series at Walt Disney World. Also in 2007, they performed as part of &quot;Love-In: A Musical Celebration&quot;, a tribute to the music of the 1960s, which was filmed at the Birch North Park Theatre in San Diego, California, and released on DVD in March 2009. On 21 August 2008, they performed a free concert on the pier in Santa Monica, California.

The pair played numerous times at the &quot;50 Winters Later&quot; celebration, in February 2009, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the death of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper. This was held in Clear Lake, Iowa, at the Surf Ballroom.

They subsequently performed in Chicago, New Jersey, and at the Festival for Beatles Fans convention in Las Vegas on 1 and 2 July 2009, where, according to a report by journalist Peter Palmiere for &quot;Beatlefan&quot; magazine, the pair were the performing highlight of the convention.

Gordon Waller died of a heart attack on 17 July 2009 in Ledyard, Connecticut, at the age of 64.

==Certifications==
&quot;A World Without Love&quot;, &quot;Nobody I Know&quot;, &quot;True Love Ways&quot;, and &quot;Lady Godiva&quot; each sold over one million copies, and were awarded gold discs.

<text>A cell type is a classification used to identify cells that share morphological or phenotypical features. A multicellular organism may contain cells of a number of widely differing and specialized cell types, such as muscle cells and skin cells, that differ both in appearance and function yet have identical genomic sequences. Cells may have the same genotype, but belong to different cell types due to the differential regulation of the genes they contain. Classification of a specific cell type is often done through the use of microscopy (such as those from the cluster of differentiation family that are commonly used for this purpose in immunology). Recent developments in single cell RNA sequencing facilitated classification of cell types based on shared gene expression patterns. This has led to the discovery of many new cell types in e.g. mouse cortex, hippocampus, dorsal root ganglion and spinal cord.

Animals have evolved a greater diversity of cell types in a multicellular body (100–150 different cell types), compared
with 10–20 in plants, fungi, and protists. The exact number of cell types is, however, undefined, and the Cell Ontology, as of 2021, lists over 2,300 different cell types.

==Multicellular organisms==
All higher multicellular organisms contain cells specialised for different functions. Most distinct cell types arise from a single totipotent cell that differentiates into hundreds of different cell types during the course of development. Differentiation of cells is driven by different environmental cues (such as cell–cell interaction) and intrinsic differences (such as those caused by the uneven distribution of molecules during division). Multicellular organisms are composed of cells that fall into two fundamental types: germ cells and somatic cells. During development, somatic cells will become more specialized and form the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. After formation of the three germ layers, cells will continue to specialize until they reach a terminally differentiated state that is much more resistant to changes in cell type than its progenitors.

The simplest organism considered to have well defined cell types are some volvoceans, such as &quot;Volvox carteri&quot;, in which each organism is composed of distinct and interdependent cell populations, some somatic and some reproductive.

== Conceptual definition ==
Even though the concept of cell type is widely used, specialists still discuss the exact definition of what constitutes a cell type.

==Humans==
A list of cell types in the human body may include several hundred distinct types depending on the source.

A 2006 peer-reviewed article by Vickaryous and Hall listed 411 distinct human cell types.

<doc id="167663" wikidata="Q222628" url="?curid=167663" title="Small Faces">
<text>Small Faces were an English rock band from London, founded in 1965. The group originally consisted of Steve Marriott, Ronnie Lane, Kenney Jones and Jimmy Winston, with Ian McLagan replacing Winston as the band&#x27;s keyboardist in 1966. The band were one of the most acclaimed and influential mod groups of the 1960s, recording hit songs such as &quot;Itchycoo Park&quot;, &quot;Lazy Sunday&quot;, &quot;All or Nothing&quot; and &quot;Tin Soldier&quot;, as well as their concept album &quot;Ogdens&#x27; Nut Gone Flake&quot;. They evolved into one of the UK&#x27;s most successful psychedelic bands until 1969.

When Marriott left to form Humble Pie, the remaining three members collaborated with Ronnie Wood, Wood&#x27;s older brother Art Wood, Rod Stewart and Kim Gardner, briefly continuing under the name Quiet Melon, and then, with the departure of Art Wood and Gardner, as the Faces. In North America, the Faces&#x27; debut album was credited to Small Faces.

Following the breakup of both the Faces and Humble Pie in 1975, the classic line-up of Small Faces re-formed (consisting of Marriott, Lane, McLagan and Jones) after a re-release of &quot;Itchycoo Park&quot; became a top-ten hit. Lane left shortly thereafter, and was replaced by Rick Wills (later of Foreigner). This line-up (dubbed Mk-II by Marriott) recorded one album &quot;Playmates&quot; before recruiting Jimmy McCulloch. This five-piece line-up released only &quot;78 in the Shade&quot; before breaking up.

Small Faces have been considered one of the early inspirations forand even an early root ofthe later Britpop movement. English music journalist Jon Savage has called them &quot;the one Brit group that prefigures the early Sex Pistols [who covered Small Faces&#x27; &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do About It&quot;, and whose member Glenn Matlock performed with a reformed version of successor band Faces].&quot; They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012.

==History==

===Origins (1965)===
==== Meeting of Lane and Marriott (1965) ====
Lane and Marriott met in 1965 while Marriott was working at the J60 Music Bar in Manor Park, London. Lane came in with his father Stan to buy a bass guitar, struck up a conversation with Marriott, bought the bass and went back to Marriott&#x27;s house after work to listen to records. They recruited friends Kenny Jones and Jimmy Winston who switched from guitar to the organ. They rapidly progressed from rehearsals at The Ruskin Arms public house (which was owned by Winston&#x27;s parents) in Manor Park, London, to ramshackle pub gigs, to semi-professional club dates. The group chose the name, &quot;Small Faces&quot;, because of the members&#x27; small physical stature and a &quot;face&quot; was somebody special; more than just a snappy dresser, he was someone in mod circles as a leader, someone to look up to. A face had the sharpest clothes, the best records and always was seen with the prettiest girl on his arm.

==== Early stage performances (1965) ====
The band&#x27;s early song set included R&amp;B/soul classics such as &quot;Jump Back&quot;, James Brown&#x27;s &quot;Please Please Please&quot;, Smokey Robinson&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;ve Really Got a Hold on Me&quot; and Ben E. King&#x27;s &quot;Stand by Me&quot;. The band also performed two Marriott/Lane original compositions, a fast and loud &quot;Come on Children&quot; and the &quot;speed enhanced&quot; song &quot;E too D&quot;, in which Marriott would display his considerable vocal abilities in the style of his heroes and role models, Otis Redding and Bobby Bland. &quot;E too D&quot;, which appears on their first album, &quot;Small Faces&quot;, is named after the guitar chord structure. On US compilation albums the track is titled &quot;Running Wild&quot;. Marriott&#x27;s unique and powerful voice attracted rising attention. Singer Elkie Brooks was struck by Marriott&#x27;s vocal prowess and stage presence, and recommended them to a local club owner, Maurice King. Impressed, King began finding them work in London and beyond. Their first out-of-London concert was at a working men&#x27;s club in Sheffield. Since the crowd was mainly made up of Teddy boys and hard-drinking workers, the band were paid off after three songs. Despondent, they walked into the mod-orientated King Mojo Club nearby (then owned by Peter Stringfellow) and offered to perform for free. They played a set that left the local mods wanting more. During a crucial residency at Leicester Square&#x27;s Cavern Club, they were supported by Sonny &amp; Cher, who were living in London at the time.

=== Decca years (1965–67) ===

====Signing to Decca and first two singles (1965)====

The band signed a management contract with management impresario Don Arden, and they were in turn signed to Decca Records for recording. They released a string of high-energy mod/soul singles on the label. Their debut single was in 1965 with &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do About It&quot;, a Top 20 UK singles chart hit. Marriott and Lane are credited with creating the instrumental to the song, &quot;borrowing&quot; the guitar riff from the Solomon Burke record &quot;Everybody Needs Somebody to Love&quot;. The lyrics were co-written by the Drifters band member Ian Samwell (who wrote one of the first British rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll records, &quot;Move It&quot;) and Brian Potter.

The group failed to capitalise on the success of their first single with the follow-up which was written by Marriott/Lane, the hard-edged mod number &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Mine&quot;. The band appeared as themselves in a 1965 crime film titled &quot;Dateline Diamonds&quot; starring Kenneth Cope as the band&#x27;s manager and it featured the band playing their second single release. Arden thought the band&#x27;s song would receive publicity from the film; however, the film&#x27;s UK release was delayed, and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Mine&quot; subsequently failed to chart despite receiving good reviews.

Shortly thereafter, Jimmy Winston left the band for an acting and music solo career. He went on to succeed as an actor in TV, film and became a successful business man. In a 2000 interview, Kenney Jones said the reason Winston was fired from the band was because &quot;He (Winston) got above his station and tried to compete with Steve Marriott.&quot; Winston subsequently said he left the group over conflicts between Arden and Winston&#x27;s brother.

==== &quot;Small Faces&quot; and further hit singles (1966) ====
Winston was replaced by Ian McLagan, whose keyboard talents and diminutive stature fit with the groove of the band perfectly. McLagan played his first performance with the band on 2 November 1965.
The new Small Faces line-up hit the charts with their third single, &quot;Sha-La-La-La-Lee&quot;, released on 28 January 1966. It was written for the group by Mort Shuman (who wrote many of Elvis Presley&#x27;s biggest singles, including &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;) and popular English entertainer and singer Kenny Lynch. The song was a big hit in Britain, peaking at number three in the UK singles chart. Their first album, &quot;Small Faces&quot;, released on 6 May 1966, was also a considerable success. They rapidly rose in popularity with each chart success, becoming regulars on British pop TV shows such as &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, and toured incessantly in the UK and Europe. Their popularity peaked in August 1966, when &quot;All or Nothing&quot;, their fifth single, hit the top of the UK charts. According to Marriott&#x27;s mother Kay, he is said to have written the song about his breakup with his ex-fiancée Susan Oliver. On the success of &quot;All or Nothing&quot; they were set to tour America with the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful and the Mamas &amp; the Papas; however, these plans had to be shelved by Don Arden after details of Ian McLagan&#x27;s recent drug conviction were leaked.

By 1966, despite being one of the highest-grossing live acts in the country and scoring many successful singles, including four UK Top 10 chart hits, the group still had little money. After a confrontation with Arden who tried to face down the boys&#x27; parents by claiming that the whole band were using drugs, they broke with both Arden and Decca.

===Immediate label years (1967–69)===

==== &quot;Here Come the Nice&quot; and eponymous second album (1967) ====

They were almost straight away offered a deal with the newly established Immediate label, formed by ex-Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham. Given a virtual open account at Olympic Studios in Barnes, London, the band progressed rapidly, working closely with engineer Glyn Johns. Their first Immediate single was the daring &quot;Here Come the Nice&quot;, which was clearly influenced by their drug use, and managed to escape censorship despite the fact that it openly referred to the dealer who sold drugs. A second self-titled album, &quot;Small Faces&quot;, followed, which, if not a major seller, was very highly regarded by other musicians and would exert a strong influence on a number of bands both at home and abroad.

Three weeks before, their old label, Decca, released the album &quot;From The Beginning&quot;, combining old hits with a number of previously unreleased recordings. It included earlier versions of songs they re-recorded for Immediate, including &quot;My Way of Giving&quot;, which they had demoed for Chris Farlowe, and &quot;(Tell Me) Have You Ever Seen Me?&quot;, which they had given to Apostolic Intervention. The album also featured their stage favourite &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t You Do It&quot;, featuring Jimmy Winston on lead vocals and guitar.

==== &quot;Itchycoo Park&quot;, &quot;There Are But Four Small Faces&quot; and &quot;Lazy Sunday&quot; (1967–68) ====
The band&#x27;s following single &quot;Itchycoo Park&quot;, released on 11 August 1967, was the first of the band&#x27;s two charting singles in the United States, reaching No. 16 in January 1968. The single was a bigger hit in Britain, peaking at No. 3. &quot;Itchycoo Park&quot; was the first British single to use flanging, the technique of playing two identical master tapes simultaneously but altering the speed of one of them very slightly by touching the &quot;flange&quot; of one tape reel, which yielded a distinctive comb-filtering effect. The effect had been applied by Olympic Studios engineer George Chkiantz. &quot;Itchycoo Park&quot; was followed in December 1967 by &quot;Tin Soldier&quot;, written by Marriott. Also, the track features American singer P. P. Arnold on backing vocals. The song was quite a hit reaching No. 9 on the UK charts and No. 73 on the U.S. Hot 100 chart. The Immediate &quot;Small Faces&quot; album was eventually released in the United States as &quot;There Are But Four Small Faces&quot;, with a considerable track change, including singles &quot;Here Come The Nice&quot;, &quot;Itchycoo Park&quot;, and &quot;Tin Soldier&quot;, but eliminating several UK album tracks. The next single &quot;Lazy Sunday&quot;, released in 1968, was an East End music-hall style song released by Immediate against the band&#x27;s wishes. It was written by Marriott inspired by the feuds with his neighbours and recorded as a joke. The single reached No. 2 in the UK charts. The final official single during the band&#x27;s career was folksy sounding &quot;The Universal&quot;, released in the summer of 1968. The song was recorded by adding studio overdubs to a basic track that Marriott had cut live in his back garden in Essex with an acoustic guitar. Taped on a home cassette recorder, Marriott&#x27;s recording included his dogs&#x27; barking in the background. The single&#x27;s comparative lack of success in the charts (No. 16 on the UK chart) disappointed Marriott, who then stopped writing music.

====&quot;Ogdens&#x27; Nut Gone Flake&quot; (1968) ====

At home in England, their career reached an all-time high after the release of their classic psychedelia-influenced album &quot;Ogdens&#x27; Nut Gone Flake&quot; on 24 May 1968. It is widely regarded as a classic album, and featured an innovative round cover, the first of its kind, designed to resemble an antique tobacco tin. It stayed at No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart for six weeks, but reached only No. 159 in the US.

The two-act concept album consisted of six original songs on side one and a whimsical psychedelic fairy tale on side two relating the adventures of &quot;Happiness Stan&quot; and his need to find out where the other half of the moon went when it waned. It was narrated by Stanley Unwin, after original plans to have Spike Milligan narrate the album went awry when he turned them down.

Critics were enthusiastic, and the album sold well, but the band were confronted by the practical problem that they had created a studio masterpiece which was virtually impossible to recreate on the road. &quot;Ogdens&quot;&#x27; was performed as a whole just once, and memorably, live in the studio on the BBC television programme &quot;Colour Me Pop&quot;.

====Breakup and &quot;The Autumn Stone&quot; (1969)====

Marriott officially quit the band at the end of 1968, walking off stage during a live New Year&#x27;s Eve gig yelling &quot;I quit&quot;. Citing frustration at their failure to break out of their pop image and their inability to reproduce the more sophisticated material properly on stage, Marriott was already looking ahead to a new band, Humble Pie, with Peter Frampton. On the subject of the group&#x27;s breakup, Kenney Jones, in an interview with John Hellier (2001), said:

So after fulfilling outstanding live performance commitments, including a European tour in January, Small Faces&#x27; dissolution was formally announced in March 1969, and Marriott and Frampton&#x27;s plans to form a new group together were unveiled (although the band were already formed and had been rehearsing together since January). 

A posthumous album, &quot;The Autumn Stone&quot;, was released later in 1969, and included the major Immediate recordings, a rare live concert performance, and a number of previously unreleased tracks recorded for their intended fourth LP, &quot;1862&quot;, including the classic Swinging Sixties instrumental &quot;Wide Eyed Girl on the Wall&quot; and &quot;Donkey Rides, A Penny, A Glass&quot;, co-written by Ian McLagan. The final single, &quot;Afterglow (Of Your Love)&quot;, was released in 1969 after the band had ceased to exist and the single only reached No. 36 in the UK Singles Charts.

===Hiatus: 1969–75===

==== Faces (1969–75) ====

After Small Faces split, Lane, Jones and McLagan joined forces with two former members of the Jeff Beck Group, singer Rod Stewart and guitarist Ronnie Wood. along with Art Wood and Kim Gardner to form Quiet Melon. Four singles were recorded before the lineup minus Art Wood and Gardner, became the Faces. However, hoping to capitalize on Small Faces&#x27; earlier success, record company executives wanted the band to keep their old name. The band objected, arguing the personnel changes resulted in a group altogether different from Small Faces.

As a compromise, the new line-up&#x27;s first album in the UK was credited as &quot;First Step&quot; by the Faces, while in the US the same album was released as &quot;First Step&quot; by Small Faces. The album was only a mild commercial success, and the record companies perceived no further need to market this new line-up as the &quot;Small Faces&quot;. Accordingly, all subsequent albums by this incarnation of the band appeared under the new name, &quot;Faces&quot;, on both sides of the Atlantic. However, all North American LP, cassette and CD reissues of &quot;First Step&quot; still credit the band as Small Faces.

Jones and McLagan stayed with the Faces until their breakup in 1975. Lane exited the Faces slightly earlier, in 1973. With his backing band, Slim Chance, Lane then released several singles and albums from 1973 to 1976, including the 1974 UK hit &quot;How Come&quot;.

==== Humble Pie (1969–75) ====

Marriott&#x27;s first post-Small Faces venture was with the rock group Humble Pie, formed with the former Herd member Peter Frampton. Initially, the group was a huge hit in the US and the UK, but Humble Pie split in 1975 due to lack of later chart success. Marriott went solo and released an album in 1976.

===Reunion: 1975–78===
Following the breakup of the Faces in 1975, the original Small Faces line-up reformed briefly to film videos miming to the reissued &quot;Itchycoo Park&quot; which hit the charts again. The group tried recording together again but Lane left after the first rehearsal due to an argument. Unknown to the others, he was just beginning to show the symptoms of multiple sclerosis, and his behaviour was misinterpreted by Marriott and the others as a drunken tantrum.

Nevertheless, McLagan, Jones and Marriott decided to stay together as Small Faces, recruiting ex-Roxy Music bassist Rick Wills to take Lane&#x27;s place. This iteration of Small Faces recorded two albums, &quot;Playmates&quot; (1977) and &quot;78 in the Shade&quot; (1978), released on Atlantic Records. Guitarist Jimmy McCulloch also briefly joined this line-up after leaving Wings. When McCulloch phoned Paul McCartney, who had found him increasingly difficult to work with, to announce he was joining Marriott, McCartney reportedly said &quot;I was a little put out at first, but, well, what can you say to that?&quot; McCulloch&#x27;s tenure with the band lasted only for a few months in late 1977. He recorded only one album with the group, &quot;78 in the Shade&quot; .

The reunion albums were both critical and commercial failures. Small Faces broke up again in 1978.

===Post-reunion activity: 1979–present===
Kenney Jones became the drummer of the Who after Keith Moon&#x27;s death in 1978 and continued to work with the Who through the late 1980s. His most recent work includes a band he formed and named the Jones Gang.

Ian McLagan went on to perform with artists such as Bonnie Raitt, Bob Dylan (the 1984 European tour), the Rolling Stones, David Lindley and his band El Rayo-X among others, and more recently Billy Bragg. In 1998 he published his autobiography, &quot;All the Rage&quot;. He lived in a small town of Manor outside Austin, Texas, and was bandleader to his own &quot;Bump Band&quot;. He died from a stroke on 3 December 2014.

Steve Marriott recorded with a revived line-up of Humble Pie from 1979 to 1981. During their tour of Australia in 1982 this version of Humble Pie was sometimes billed as Small Faces in order to sell more tickets. Along with Ronnie Lane, he formed a new band called the Majik Mijits in 1981, but this band&#x27;s lone album, &quot;Together Again: The Lost Majik Mijits Recordings&quot;, was not issued until 2000. Later in the 1980s, Marriott went solo, playing nearly 200 concerts a year. On 20 April 1991, Marriott died in his sleep when a fire, caused by a cigarette, swept through his home in Essex, England. His death came just a few days after he had begun work on a new album in the United States with his former Humble Pie bandmate, Peter Frampton.

Ronnie Lane&#x27;s recording career was curtailed by the effects of multiple sclerosis, though he issued collaborative albums with Pete Townshend and Ronnie Wood in the late 1970s. He moved to the United States and continued to perform live into the early 1990s. Lane died at his home in Trinidad, Colorado, on 4 June 1997, after battling multiple sclerosis for nearly 20 years.

Rick Wills of the reunited Small Faces played on David Gilmour&#x27;s 1978 album, &quot;David Gilmour&quot;, then joined Foreigner later that year. He stayed with Foreigner for 14 years, until 1992. Subsequently, Wills was a member of Bad Company from 1992 to 1998 and again, briefly in 2001. Currently, he lives in Cambridge, England, and works with Kenney Jones in the Jones Gang.

Jimmy McCulloch&#x27;s stint with Small Faces only lasted for a few months in late 1977. Shortly after leaving, he started a band called Wild Horses with Brian Robertson, Jimmy Bain and Kenney Jones. He and Jones both left the band before they issued any recordings. McCulloch then became a member of the Dukes, who issued one album in 1979. That same year, McCulloch died at the age of twenty-six from a heroin overdose at his flat in Maida Vale.

== Influence ==
Small Faces were an early influence on seminal British punk band the Sex Pistols, who regularly covered them in live shows. Johnny Rotten changed lyrics like &quot;I want you to know that I love you baby, want you to know that I care&quot; in &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do About It&quot; to &quot;I want you to know that I &quot;hate&quot; you baby, want you to know I &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; care&quot;.

Small Faces and other 1960s mod bands resurged in interest with the mod revival of the late-1970s, led by the Jam. Paul Weller of the Jam said: &quot;The Small Faces are a massive influence on me. It&#x27;s everything for me: they looked great, their music was great, their attitude was great. It was the most complete band for me.&quot;

Small Faces were one of the 1960s British pop groups that highly influenced the Britpop movement of the 1990s; Professors Andy Bennett and Jon Stratton place them among the Beatles and the Kinks in this regard.

==Honours and awards==

In 1996, Small Faces were awarded the Ivor Novello Outstanding Contribution to British Music &quot;Lifetime Achievement&quot; award.

On 4 September 2007, a Small Faces and Don Arden commemorative plaque, issued by the London Borough of Westminster, was unveiled in their memory in Carnaby Street. Kenney Jones, who attended the ceremony, said in a BBC television interview, &quot;To honour Small Faces after all these years is a terrific achievement. I only wish that Steve Marriott, Ronnie Lane and the late Don Arden were here to enjoy this moment with me.&quot;

On 7 December 2011, Small Faces were announced as 2012 inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The induction ceremony was held on 14 April 2012.

At least one tribute band exists, the Small Fakers, who have been approved by Jones and Winston as well as family members of those involved with the band.

<text>Epsilon Eridani (Latinized from ε Eridani), proper name Ran, is a star in the southern constellation of Eridanus. At a declination of −9.46°, it is visible from most of Earth&#x27;s surface. Located at a distance from the Sun, it has an apparent magnitude of 3.73, making it the third-closest individual star (or star system) visible to the naked eye.

The star is estimated to be less than a billion years old. This relative youth gives Epsilon Eridani a higher level of magnetic activity than the Sun, with a stellar wind 30 times as strong. The star&#x27;s rotation period is 11.2 days at the equator. Epsilon Eridani is smaller and less massive than the Sun, and has a lower level of elements heavier than helium. It is a main-sequence star of spectral class K2, with an effective temperature of about , giving it an orange hue. It is a candidate member of the Ursa Major moving group of stars, which share a similar motion through the Milky Way, implying these stars shared a common origin in an open cluster.

Periodic changes in Epsilon Eridani&#x27;s radial velocity have yielded evidence of a giant planet orbiting it, designated Epsilon Eridani b. The discovery of the planet was initially controversial, but most astronomers now regard the planet as confirmed. In 2015 the planet was given the proper name AEgir . The Epsilon Eridani planetary system also includes a debris disc consisting of a Kuiper belt analogue at 70 au from the star and warm dust between about 3 au and 20 au from the star. The gap in the debris disc between 20 and 70 au implies the likely existence of outer planets in the system.

As one of the nearest Sun-like stars, Epsilon Eridani has been the target of several observations in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Epsilon Eridani appears in science fiction stories and has been suggested as a destination for interstellar travel. From Epsilon Eridani, the Sun would appear as a star in Serpens, with an apparent magnitude of 2.4.

== Nomenclature ==
&quot;ε Eridani&quot;, Latinised to &quot;Epsilon Eridani&quot;, is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation. Despite being a relatively bright star, it was not given a proper name by early astronomers. It has several other catalogue designations. Upon its discovery, the planet was designated Epsilon Eridani b, following the usual designation system for extrasolar planets.

The planet and its host star were selected by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) as part of the NameExoWorlds competition for giving proper names to exoplanets and their host stars, for some systems that did not already have proper names. The process involved nominations by educational groups and public voting for the proposed names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning names were &quot;Ran&quot; for the star and &quot;AEgir&quot; for the planet. Those names had been submitted by the pupils of the 8th Grade at Mountainside Middle School in Colbert, Washington, United States. Both names derive from Norse mythology: Rán is the goddess of the sea and Ægir, her husband, is the god of the ocean.

In 2016, the IAU organised a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardise proper names for stars. In its first bulletin of July 2016, the WGSN explicitly recognised the names of exoplanets and their host stars that were produced by the competition. Epsilon Eridani is now listed as Ran in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. Professional astronomers have mostly continued to refer to the star as Epsilon Eridani.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Celestial Meadows&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of ε Eridani, γ Eridani, δ Eridani, π Eridani, ζ Eridani, η Eridani, π Ceti, τ1 Eridani, τ2 Eridani, τ3 Eridani, τ4 Eridani, τ5 Eridani, τ6 Eridani, τ7 Eridani, τ8 Eridani and τ9 Eridani. Consequently, the Chinese name for ε Eridani itself is (, the Fourth [Star] of Celestial Meadows.)

== Observational history ==
=== Cataloguing ===
Epsilon Eridani has been known to astronomers since at least the 2nd century AD, when Claudius Ptolemy (a Greek astronomer from Alexandria, Egypt) included it in his catalogue of more than a thousand stars. The catalogue was published as part of his astronomical treatise the &quot;Almagest&quot;. The constellation Eridanus was named by Ptolemy – , and Epsilon Eridani was listed as its thirteenth star. Ptolemy called Epsilon Eridani (here is the number four). This refers to a group of four stars in Eridanus: γ, π, δ and ε (10th–13th in Ptolemy&#x27;s list). ε is the most western of these, and thus the first of the four in the apparent daily motion of the sky from east to west. Modern scholars of Ptolemy&#x27;s catalogue designate its entry as &quot;P 784&quot; (in order of appearance) and &quot;Eri 13&quot;. Ptolemy described the star&#x27;s magnitude as 3.

Epsilon Eridani was included in several star catalogues of medieval Islamic astronomical treatises, which were based on Ptolemy&#x27;s catalogue: in Al-Sufi&#x27;s &quot;Book of Fixed Stars&quot;, published in 964, Al-Biruni&#x27;s &quot;Mas&#x27;ud Canon&quot;, published in 1030, and Ulugh Beg&#x27;s &quot;Zij-i Sultani&quot;, published in 1437. Al-Sufi&#x27;s estimate of Epsilon Eridani&#x27;s magnitude was 3. Al-Biruni quotes magnitudes from Ptolemy and Al-Sufi (for Epsilon Eridani he quotes the value 4 for both Ptolemy&#x27;s and Al-Sufi&#x27;s magnitudes; original values of both these magnitudes are 3). Its number in order of appearance is 786. Ulugh Beg carried out new measurements of Epsilon Eridani&#x27;s coordinates in his observatory at Samarkand, and quotes magnitudes from Al-Sufi (3 for Epsilon Eridani). The modern designations of its entry in Ulugh Beg&#x27;s catalogue are &quot;U 781&quot; and &quot;Eri 13&quot; (the latter is the same as Ptolemy&#x27;s catalogue designation).

In 1598 Epsilon Eridani was included in Tycho Brahe&#x27;s star catalogue, republished in 1627 by Johannes Kepler as part of his &quot;Rudolphine Tables&quot;. This catalogue was based on Tycho Brahe&#x27;s observations of 1577–1597, including those on the island of Hven at his observatories of Uraniborg and Stjerneborg. The sequence number of Epsilon Eridani in the constellation Eridanus was 10, and it was designated ; the meaning is the same as Ptolemy&#x27;s description. Brahe assigned it magnitude 3.

Epsilon Eridani&#x27;s Bayer designation was established in 1603 as part of the &quot;Uranometria&quot;, a star catalogue produced by German celestial cartographer Johann Bayer. His catalogue assigned letters from the Greek alphabet to groups of stars belonging to the same visual magnitude class in each constellation, beginning with alpha (α) for a star in the brightest class. Bayer made no attempt to arrange stars by relative brightness within each class. Thus, although Epsilon is the fifth letter in the Greek alphabet, the star is the tenth-brightest in Eridanus. In addition to the letter ε, Bayer had given it the number 13 (the same as Ptolemy&#x27;s catalogue number, as were many of Bayer&#x27;s numbers) and described it as . Bayer assigned Epsilon Eridani magnitude 3.

In 1690 Epsilon Eridani was included in the star catalogue of Johannes Hevelius. Its sequence number in constellation Eridanus was 14, its designation was , and it was assigned magnitude 3 or 4 (sources differ). The star catalogue of English astronomer John Flamsteed, published in 1712, gave Epsilon Eridani the Flamsteed designation of 18 Eridani, because it was the eighteenth catalogued star in the constellation of Eridanus by order of increasing right ascension. In 1818 Epsilon Eridani was included in Friedrich Bessel&#x27;s catalogue, based on James Bradley&#x27;s observations from 1750–1762, and at magnitude 4. It also appeared in Nicolas Louis de Lacaille&#x27;s catalogue of 398 principal stars, whose 307-star version was published in 1755 in the , and whose full version was published in 1757 in , Paris. In its 1831 edition by Francis Baily, Epsilon Eridani has the number 50. Lacaille assigned it magnitude 3.

In 1801 Epsilon Eridani was included in , Joseph Jérôme Lefrançois de Lalande&#x27;s catalogue of about 50,000 stars, based on his observations of 1791–1800, in which observations are arranged in time order. It contains three observations of Epsilon Eridani. In 1847, a new edition of Lalande&#x27;s catalogue was published by Francis Baily, containing the majority of its observations, in which the stars were numbered in order of right ascension. Because every observation of each star was numbered and Epsilon Eridani was observed three times, it got three numbers: 6581, 6582 and 6583. (Today numbers from this catalogue are used with the prefix &quot;Lalande&quot;, or &quot;Lal&quot;.) Lalande assigned Epsilon Eridani magnitude 3. Also in 1801 it was included in the catalogue of Johann Bode, in which about 17,000 stars were grouped into 102 constellations and numbered (Epsilon Eridani got the number 159 in the constellation Eridanus). Bode&#x27;s catalogue was based on observations of various astronomers, including Bode himself, but mostly on Lalande&#x27;s and Lacaille&#x27;s (for the southern sky). Bode assigned Epsilon Eridani magnitude 3. In 1814 Giuseppe Piazzi published the second edition of his star catalogue (its first edition was published in 1803), based on observations during 1792–1813, in which more than 7000 stars were grouped into 24 hours (0–23). Epsilon Eridani is number 89 in hour 3. Piazzi assigned it magnitude 4. In 1918 Epsilon Eridani appeared in the Henry Draper Catalogue with the designation HD 22049 and a preliminary spectral classification of K0.

=== Detection of proximity ===
Based on observations between 1800 and 1880, Epsilon Eridani was found to have a large proper motion across the celestial sphere, which was estimated at three arcseconds per year (angular velocity). This movement implied it was relatively close to the Sun, making it a star of interest for the purpose of stellar parallax measurements. This process involves recording the position of Epsilon Eridani as Earth moves around the Sun, which allows a star&#x27;s distance to be estimated. From 1881 to 1883, American astronomer William L. Elkin used a heliometer at the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa, to compare the position of Epsilon Eridani with two nearby stars. From these observations, a parallax of was calculated. By 1917, observers had refined their parallax estimate to 0.317 arcseconds. The modern value of 0.3109 arcseconds is equivalent to a distance of about .

=== Circumstellar discoveries ===

Based on apparent changes in the position of Epsilon Eridani between 1938 and 1972, Peter van de Kamp proposed that an unseen companion with an orbital period of 25 years was causing gravitational perturbations in its position. This claim was refuted in 1993 by Wulff-Dieter Heintz and the false detection was blamed on a systematic error in the photographic plates.

Launched in 1983, the space telescope IRAS detected infrared emissions from stars near to the Sun, including an excess infrared emission from Epsilon Eridani. The observations indicated a disk of fine-grained cosmic dust was orbiting the star; this debris disk has since been extensively studied. Evidence for a planetary system was discovered in 1998 by the observation of asymmetries in this dust ring. The clumping in the dust distribution could be explained by gravitational interactions with a planet orbiting just inside the dust ring.

In 1987, the detection of an orbiting planetary object was announced by Bruce Campbell, Gordon Walker and Stephenson Yang. From 1980 to 2000, a team of astronomers led by Artie P. Hatzes made radial velocity observations of Epsilon Eridani, measuring the Doppler shift of the star along the line of sight. They found evidence of a planet orbiting the star with a period of about seven years. Although there is a high level of noise in the radial velocity data due to magnetic activity in its photosphere, any periodicity caused by this magnetic activity is expected to show a strong correlation with variations in emission lines of ionized calcium (the Ca II H and K lines). Because no such correlation was found, a planetary companion was deemed the most likely cause. This discovery was supported by astrometric measurements of Epsilon Eridani made between 2001 and 2003 with the Hubble Space Telescope, which showed evidence for gravitational perturbation of Epsilon Eridani by a planet.

=== SETI and proposed exploration ===
In 1960, physicists Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi proposed that extraterrestrial civilisations might be using radio signals for communication. Project Ozma, led by astronomer Frank Drake, used the Tatel Telescope to search for such signals from the nearby Sun-like stars Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti. The systems were observed at the emission frequency of neutral hydrogen, 1,420 MHz (21 cm). No signals of intelligent extraterrestrial origin were detected. Drake repeated the experiment in 2010, with the same negative result. Despite this lack of success, Epsilon Eridani made its way into science fiction literature and television shows for many years following news of Drake&#x27;s initial experiment.

In &quot;Habitable Planets for Man&quot;, a 1964 RAND Corporation study by space scientist Stephen H. Dole, the probability of a habitable planet being in orbit around Epsilon Eridani were estimated at 3.3%. Among the known nearby stars, it was listed with the 14 stars that were thought most likely to have a habitable planet.

William I. McLaughlin proposed a new strategy in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) in 1977. He suggested that widely observable events such as nova explosions might be used by intelligent extraterrestrials to synchronise the transmission and reception of their signals. This idea was tested by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in 1988, which used outbursts of Nova Cygni 1975 as the timer. Fifteen days of observation showed no anomalous radio signals coming from Epsilon Eridani.

Because of the proximity and Sun-like properties of Epsilon Eridani, in 1985 physicist and author Robert L. Forward considered the system as a plausible target for interstellar travel. The following year, the British Interplanetary Society suggested Epsilon Eridani as one of the targets in its Project Daedalus study. The system has continued to be among the targets of such proposals, such as Project Icarus in 2011.

Based on its nearby location, Epsilon Eridani was among the target stars for Project Phoenix, a 1995 microwave survey for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence. The project had checked about 800 stars by 2004 but had not yet detected any signals.

== Properties ==
At a distance of , Epsilon Eridani is the 13th-nearest known star (and ninth nearest solitary star or stellar system) to the Sun as of 2014. Its proximity makes it one of the most studied stars of its spectral type. Epsilon Eridani is located in the northern part of the constellation Eridanus, about 3° east of the slightly brighter star Delta Eridani. With a declination of −9.46°, Epsilon Eridani can be viewed from much of Earth&#x27;s surface, at suitable times of year. Only to the north of latitude 80° N is it permanently hidden below the horizon. The apparent magnitude of 3.73 can make it difficult to observe from an urban area with the unaided eye, because the night skies over cities are obscured by light pollution.

Epsilon Eridani has an estimated mass of 0.82 solar masses and a radius of 0.738 solar radii. It shines with a luminosity of only 0.34 solar luminosities. The estimated effective temperature is 5,084 K. With a stellar classification of K2 V, it is the second-nearest K-type main-sequence star (after Alpha Centauri B). Since 1943 the spectrum of Epsilon Eridani has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. Its metallicity, the fraction of elements heavier than helium, is slightly lower than the Sun&#x27;s. In Epsilon Eridani&#x27;s chromosphere, a region of the outer atmosphere just above the light emitting photosphere, the abundance of iron is estimated at 74% of the Sun&#x27;s value. The proportion of lithium in the atmosphere is five times less than that in the Sun.

Epsilon Eridani&#x27;s K-type classification indicates that the spectrum has relatively weak absorption lines from absorption by hydrogen (Balmer lines) but strong lines of neutral atoms and singly ionized calcium (Ca II). The luminosity class V (dwarf) is assigned to stars that are undergoing thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen in their core. For a K-type main-sequence star, this fusion is dominated by the proton–proton chain reaction, in which a series of reactions effectively combines four hydrogen nuclei to form a helium nucleus. The energy released by fusion is transported outward from the core through radiation, which results in no net motion of the surrounding plasma. Outside of this region, in the envelope, energy is carried to the photosphere by plasma convection, where it then radiates into space.

=== Magnetic activity ===

Epsilon Eridani has a higher level of magnetic activity than the Sun, and thus the outer parts of its atmosphere (the chromosphere and corona) are more dynamic. The average magnetic field strength of Epsilon Eridani across the entire surface is , which is more than forty times greater than the magnetic-field strength in the Sun&#x27;s photosphere. The magnetic properties can be modelled by assuming that regions with a magnetic flux of about 0.14 T randomly cover approximately 9% of the photosphere, whereas the remainder of the surface is free of magnetic fields. The overall magnetic activity of Epsilon Eridani shows co-existing and year activity cycles. Assuming that its radius does not change over these intervals, the long-term variation in activity level appears to produce a temperature variation of 15 K, which corresponds to a variation in visual magnitude (V) of 0.014.

The magnetic field on the surface of Epsilon Eridani causes variations in the hydrodynamic behaviour of the photosphere. This results in greater jitter during measurements of its radial velocity. Variations of −1 were measured over a 20 year period, which is much higher than the measurement uncertainty of −1. This makes interpretation of periodicities in the radial velocity of Epsilon Eridani, such as those caused by an orbiting planet, more difficult.
Epsilon Eridani is classified as a BY Draconis variable because it has regions of higher magnetic activity that move into and out of the line of sight as it rotates. Measurement of this rotational modulation suggests that its equatorial region rotates with an average period of 11.2 days, which is less than half of the rotation period of the Sun. Observations have shown that Epsilon Eridani varies as much as 0.050 in V magnitude due to starspots and other short-term magnetic activity. Photometry has also shown that the surface of Epsilon Eridani, like the Sun, is undergoing differential rotation i.e. the rotation period at equator differs from that at high latitude. The measured periods range from 10.8 to 12.3 days. The axial tilt of Epsilon Eridani toward the line of sight from Earth is highly uncertain: estimates range from 24° to 72°.

The high levels of chromospheric activity, strong magnetic field, and relatively fast rotation rate of Epsilon Eridani are characteristic of a young star. Most estimates of the age of Epsilon Eridani place it in the range from 200 million to 800 million years. The low abundance of heavy elements in the chromosphere of Epsilon Eridani usually indicates an older star, because the interstellar medium (out of which stars form) is steadily enriched by heavier elements produced by older generations of stars. This anomaly might be caused by a diffusion process that has transported some of the heavier elements out of the photosphere and into a region below Epsilon Eridani&#x27;s convection zone.

The X-ray luminosity of Epsilon Eridani is about (). It is more luminous in X-rays than the Sun at peak activity. The source for this strong X-ray emission is Epsilon Eridani&#x27;s hot corona. Epsilon Eridani&#x27;s corona appears larger and hotter than the Sun&#x27;s, with a temperature of , measured from observation of the corona&#x27;s ultraviolet and X-ray emission. It displays a cyclical variation in X-ray emission that is consistent with the magnetic activity cycle.

The stellar wind emitted by Epsilon Eridani expands until it collides with the surrounding interstellar medium of diffuse gas and dust, resulting in a bubble of heated hydrogen gas (an astrosphere, the equivalent of the heliosphere that surrounds the Sun). The absorption spectrum from this gas has been measured with the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing the properties of the stellar wind to be estimated. Epsilon Eridani&#x27;s hot corona results in a mass loss rate in Epsilon Eridani&#x27;s stellar wind that is 30 times higher than the Sun&#x27;s. This stellar wind generates the astrosphere that spans about and contains a bow shock that lies from Epsilon Eridani. At its estimated distance from Earth, this astrosphere spans 42 arcminutes, which is wider than the apparent size of the full Moon.

=== Kinematics ===
Epsilon Eridani has a high proper motion, moving −0.976 arcseconds per year in right ascension (the celestial equivalent of longitude) and 0.018 arcseconds per year in declination (celestial latitude), for a combined total of 0.962 arcseconds per year. The star has a radial velocity of (away from the Sun). The space velocity components of Epsilon Eridani in the galactic co-ordinate system are = , which means that it is travelling within the Milky Way at a mean galactocentric distance of 28.7 kly (8.79 kiloparsecs) from the core along an orbit that has an eccentricity of 0.09. The position and velocity of Epsilon Eridani indicate that it may be a member of the Ursa Major Moving Group, whose members share a common motion through space. This behaviour suggests that the moving group originated in an open cluster that has since diffused. The estimated age of this group is years, which lies within the range of the age estimates for Epsilon Eridani.

During the past million years, three stars are believed to have come within of Epsilon Eridani. The most recent and closest of these encounters was with Kapteyn&#x27;s Star, which approached to a distance of about roughly 12,500 years ago. Two more distant encounters were with Sirius and Ross 614. None of these encounters are thought to have been close enough to affect the circumstellar disk orbiting Epsilon Eridani.

Epsilon Eridani made its closest approach to the Sun about 105,000 years ago, when they were separated by . Based upon a simulation of close encounters with nearby stars, the binary star system Luyten 726-8, which includes the variable star UV Ceti, will encounter Epsilon Eridani in approximately 31,500 years at a minimum distance of about 0.9 ly (0.29 parsecs). They will be less than 1 ly (0.3 parsecs) apart for about 4,600 years. If Epsilon Eridani has an Oort cloud, Luyten 726-8 could gravitationally perturb some of its comets with long orbital periods.

=== Debris disc ===
An infrared excess around Epsilon Eridani was detected by IRAS indicating the presence of circumstellar dust. Observations with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) at a wavelength of 850 μm show an extended flux of radiation out to an angular radius of 35 arcseconds around Epsilon Eridani, resolving the debris disc for the first time. Higher resolution images have since been taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, showing that the belt is located 70 au from the star with a width of just 11 au. The disc is inclined 33.7° from face-on, making it appear elliptical.

Dust and possibly water ice from this belt migrates inward because of drag from the stellar wind and a process by which stellar radiation causes dust grains to slowly spiral toward Epsilon Eridani, known as the Poynting–Robertson effect. At the same time, these dust particles can be destroyed through mutual collisions. The time scale for all of the dust in the disk to be cleared away by these processes is less than Epsilon Eridani&#x27;s estimated age. Hence, the current dust disk must have been created by collisions or other effects of larger parent bodies, and the disk represents a late stage in the planet-formation process. It would have required collisions between 11 Earth masses&#x27; worth of parent bodies to have maintained the disk in its current state over its estimated age.

The disk contains an estimated mass of dust equal to a sixth of the mass of the Moon, with individual dust grains exceeding 3.5 μm in size at a temperature of about 55 K. This dust is being generated by the collision of comets, which range up to 10 to 30 km in diameter and have a combined mass of 5 to 9 times that of Earth. This is similar to the estimated 10 Earth masses in the primordial Kuiper belt. The disk around Epsilon Eridani contains less than of carbon monoxide. This low level suggests a paucity of volatile-bearing comets and icy planetesimals compared to the Kuiper belt.

The JCMT images show signs of clumpy structure in the belt that may be explained by gravitational perturbation from a planet, dubbed Epsilon Eridani c. The clumps in the dust are theorised to occur at orbits that have an integer resonance with the orbit of the suspected planet. For example, the region of the disk that completes two orbits for every three orbits of a planet is in a 3:2 orbital resonance. The planet proposed to cause these perturbations is predicted to have a semimajor axis of between 40 and 50 au. However, the brightest clumps have since been identified as background sources and the existence of the remaining clumps remains debated.

Dust is also present closer to the star. Observations from NASA&#x27;s Spitzer Space Telescope suggest that Epsilon Eridani actually has two asteroid belts and a cloud of exozodiacal dust. The latter is an analogue of the zodiacal dust that occupies the plane of the Solar System. One belt sits at approximately the same position as the one in the Solar System, orbiting at a distance of from Epsilon Eridani, and consists of silicate grains with a diameter of 3 μm and a combined mass of about 1018 kg. If the planet Epsilon Eridani b exists then this belt is unlikely to have had a source outside the orbit of the planet, so the dust may have been created by fragmentation and cratering of larger bodies such as asteroids. The second, denser belt, most likely also populated by asteroids, lies between the first belt and the outer comet disk. The structure of the belts and the dust disk suggests that more than two planets in the Epsilon Eridani system are needed to maintain this configuration.

In an alternative scenario, the exozodiacal dust may be generated in the outer belt. This dust is then transported inward past the orbit of Epsilon Eridani b. When collisions between the dust grains are taken into account, the dust will reproduce the observed infrared spectrum and brightness. Outside the radius of ice sublimation, located beyond 10 au from Epsilon Eridani where the temperatures fall below 100 K, the best fit to the observations occurs when a mix of ice and silicate dust is assumed. Inside this radius, the dust must consist of silicate grains that lack volatiles.

The inner region around Epsilon Eridani, from a radius of 2.5 AU inward, appears to be clear of dust down to the detection limit of the 6.5 m MMT telescope. Grains of dust in this region are efficiently removed by drag from the stellar wind, while the presence of a planetary system may also help keep this area clear of debris. Still, this does not preclude the possibility that an inner asteroid belt may be present with a combined mass no greater than the asteroid belt in the Solar System.

=== Long-period planets ===

As one of the nearest Sun-like stars, Epsilon Eridani has been the target of many attempts to search for planetary companions. Its chromospheric activity and variability mean that finding planets with the radial velocity method is difficult, because the stellar activity may create signals that mimic the presence of planets. Searches for exoplanets around Epsilon Eridani with direct imaging have been unsuccessful.

Infrared observation has shown there are no bodies of three or more Jupiter masses in this system, out to at least a distance of 500 au from the host star. Planets with similar masses and temperatures as Jupiter should be detectable by Spitzer at distances beyond 80 au. One roughly Jupiter-sized long-period planet has been detected and characterized by both the radial velocity and astrometry methods. Planets more than 150% as massive as Jupiter can be ruled out at the inner edge of the debris disk at 30–35 au.

==== Planet b (AEgir) ====

Referred to as Epsilon Eridani b, this planet was announced in 2000, but the discovery remained controversial over roughly the next two decades. A comprehensive study in 2008 called the detection &quot;tentative&quot; and described the proposed planet as &quot;long suspected but still unconfirmed&quot;. Many astronomers believed the evidence is sufficiently compelling that they regard the discovery as confirmed. The discovery was questioned in 2013 because a search program at La Silla Observatory did not confirm it exists. Further studies since 2018 have gradually reaffirmed the planet&#x27;s existence through a combination of radial velocity and astrometry.

Published sources remain in disagreement as to the planet&#x27;s basic parameters. Recent values for its orbital period range from 7.3 to 7.6 years, estimates of the size of its elliptical orbit—the semimajor axis—range from 3.38 au to 3.53 au, and approximations of its orbital eccentricity range from 0.055 to 0.26.

Initially, the planet&#x27;s mass was unknown, but a lower limit could be estimated based on the orbital displacement of Epsilon Eridani. Only the component of the displacement along the line of sight to Earth was known, which yields a value for the formula &quot;m&quot; sin &quot;i&quot;, where &quot;m&quot; is the mass of the planet and &quot;i&quot; is the orbital inclination. Estimates for the value of ranged from 0.60 Jupiter masses to 1.06 Jupiter masses, which sets the lower limit for the mass of the planet (because the sine function has a maximum value of 1). Taking in the middle of that range at 0.78, and estimating the inclination at 30° as was suggested by Hubble astrometry, this yields a value of Jupiter masses for the planet&#x27;s mass. More recent astrometric studies have found lower masses, ranging from 0.63 to 0.78 Jupiter masses.

Of all the measured parameters for this planet, the value for orbital eccentricity is the most uncertain. The eccentricity of 0.7 suggested by some older studies is inconsistent with the presence of the proposed asteroid belt at a distance of 3 au. If the eccentricity was this high, the planet would pass through the asteroid belt and clear it out within about ten thousand years. If the belt has existed for longer than this period, which appears likely, it imposes an upper limit on Epsilon Eridani b&#x27;s eccentricity of about 0.10–0.15. If the dust disk is instead being generated from the outer debris disk, rather than from collisions in an asteroid belt, then no constraints on the planet&#x27;s orbital eccentricity are needed to explain the dust distribution.

==== Potential habitability ====
Epsilon Eridani is a target for planet finding programs because it has properties that allow an Earth-like planet to form. Although this system was not chosen as a primary candidate for the now-canceled Terrestrial Planet Finder, it was a target star for NASA&#x27;s proposed Space Interferometry Mission to search for Earth-sized planets. The proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets of Epsilon Eridani have also made it the subject of multiple studies on whether an interstellar probe can be sent to Epsilon Eridani.

The orbital radius at which the stellar flux from Epsilon Eridani matches the solar constant—where the emission matches the Sun&#x27;s output at the orbital distance of the Earth—is 0.61 au. That is within the maximum habitable zone of a conjectured Earth-like planet orbiting Epsilon Eridani, which currently stretches from about 0.5 to 1.0 au. As Epsilon Eridani ages over a period of 20 billion years, the net luminosity will increase, causing this zone to slowly expand outward to about 0.6–1.4 au. The presence of a large planet with a highly elliptical orbit in proximity to Epsilon Eridani&#x27;s habitable zone reduces the likelihood of a terrestrial planet having a stable orbit within the habitable zone.

A young star such as Epsilon Eridani can produce large amounts of ultraviolet radiation that may be harmful to life, but on the other hand it is a cooler star than the Sun and so produces less ultraviolet radiation to start with. The orbital radius where the UV flux matches that on the early Earth lies at just under 0.5 au. Because that is actually slightly closer to the star than the habitable zone, this has led some researchers to conclude there is not enough energy from ultraviolet radiation reaching into the habitable zone for life to ever get started around the young Epsilon Eridani.

<doc id="167665" wikidata="Q204289" url="?curid=167665" title="Boston (band)">
<text>Boston is an American rock band formed in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1975 by Tom Scholz. The band&#x27;s core members include multi-instrumentalist, founder and leader Scholz, who played the majority of instruments on the band&#x27;s 1976 self-titled debut album, and former lead vocalist Brad Delp, among a number of other musicians who varied from album to album.

Boston experienced significant commercial success during the 1970s and 1980s. Their best-known songs include &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot;, &quot;Peace of Mind&quot;, &quot;Foreplay/Long Time&quot;, &quot;Rock and Roll Band&quot;, &quot;Smokin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;, &quot;A Man I&#x27;ll Never Be&quot;, &quot;Hitch a Ride&quot;, &quot;Party&quot;, &quot;Amanda&quot; and &quot;Feelin&#x27; Satisfied&quot;. The band has sold more than 75 million records worldwide, including 31 million units sold in the United States, of which 17 million were the band&#x27;s debut album and seven million copies of the band&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; (1978), placing the group at #63 amongst the world&#x27;s best-selling music artists. Altogether, the band has released six studio albums in a career spanning over years. Boston&#x27;s recorded output has been minimal since the 1980s – with &quot;Third Stage&quot;, &quot;Walk On&quot; and &quot;Corporate America&quot; all released eight years apart, and the latter followed eleven years later by the band&#x27;s most recent album &quot;Life, Love &amp; Hope&quot; (2013) – although they have continued to perform live and have occasionally been hinting at an upcoming seventh studio album. Boston was ranked the 63rd-best hard rock artist by VH1.

After original longtime lead singer Brad Delp died in 2007, a number of vocalists have taken the stage, including Stryper frontman and vocalist Michael Sweet. Since 2007, Tommy DeCarlo has been the group&#x27;s lead singer. Other current members of the band include guitarist Gary Pihl, bassist Tracy Ferrie, drummer Jeff Neal and vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Beth Cohen.

==History==
===Early years (1969–1975)===
Tom Scholz first started writing music in 1969 while he was attending Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he wrote an instrumental song, &quot;Foreplay&quot;. While attending MIT, Scholz joined the band Freehold, where he met guitarist Barry Goudreau and drummer Jim Masdea, who would later become members of Boston. Vocalist Brad Delp was added to the collective in 1970. After graduating with a master&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering from MIT, Scholz worked for Polaroid, using his salary to build a recording studio in his basement, and to finance demonstration tapes recorded in professional recording studios. These early demo tapes were recorded with (at various times) Delp on vocals, Goudreau on guitar, Masdea on drums, and Scholz on guitar, bass, and keyboards. The demo tapes were sent to record companies, but received consistent rejections. In 1973 Scholz formed the band Mother&#x27;s Milk with Delp, Goudreau, and Masdea. That group disbanded by 1974, but Scholz subsequently worked with Masdea and Delp to produce six new demos, including &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot;, &quot;Peace of Mind&quot;, &quot;Rock and Roll Band&quot;, &quot;Something About You&quot; (then entitled &quot;Life Isn&#x27;t Easy&quot;), &quot;Hitch a Ride&quot; (then entitled &quot;San Francisco Day&quot;), and &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid&quot;. Scholz stated they finished four of the six by the end of 1974, and they finished &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot; and &quot;Something About You&quot; in 1975. Scholz played all the instruments on the demos, except for the drums, which were played by Masdea, and used self-designed pedals to create the desired guitar sounds.

This final demo tape attracted the attention of promoters Paul Ahern and Charlie McKenzie. Masdea left the band around this time. According to Scholz, the managers insisted that Masdea had to be replaced before the band could get a recording deal. Years later, Delp told journalist Chuck Miller: &quot;[Jim] actually told me he was losing interest in playing drums. I know Tom felt very bad when the whole thing happened. And then, of course, we started getting some interest.&quot; Scholz and Delp signed a deal with Epic Records after Masdea&#x27;s departure, thanks to Ahern and McKenzie. Before the deal could be finalized, the band had to do a live audition for the record-company executives. The duo recruited Goudreau on guitar, bassist Fran Sheehan, and drummer Sib Hashian to create a performing unit that could replicate Scholz&#x27;s richly layered recordings on stage. According to Scholz, Masdea had insisted on performing a drum solo during the audition. Scholz stated that &quot;The night before we auditioned I was going over a few things, trying to get everybody psyched up, and this guy says, &#x27;You know, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re going to get this contract unless we have something flashy like a good drum solo right in the middle.&#x27; We&#x27;d only been working on arrangements and on this set for a month ...so we got Sib, whom I&#x27;d known for quite awhile.&quot; The showcase was a success and the band agreed to put out 10 albums over the next six years.
In addition to the firing of Masdea, the record label insisted that Scholz re-record the demo tapes in a professional studio. However, Scholz wanted to record them in his basement studio so that he could work at his own pace. Scholz and producer John Boylan hatched a plan to send the rest of the band to Los Angeles to make the record label happy, while Scholz recorded most of Boston&#x27;s debut album at home, with Masdea playing drums on the track &quot;Rock and Roll Band&quot; and Scholz playing the other instruments. The multitrack tapes were then brought to Los Angeles, where Delp added vocals and the album was mixed by Boylan. Then, the band was named &quot;Boston&quot;, by suggestion of Boylan and engineer Warren Dewey.

===&quot;Boston&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; (1976–1978)===

The debut album, &quot;Boston&quot;, released on August 25, 1976, ranks as one of the best-selling debut albums in U.S. history with over 17 million copies sold.

During the late summer and early fall of 1976, Boston attracted publicity due to the record sales. However, according to Cameron Crowe in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, there was &quot;a conscious effort to de-emphasize Scholz as the total mastermind behind Boston&quot;. After opening for Black Sabbath, Blue Öyster Cult, Foghat, and others in the fall, the band embarked on a headlining tour in the winter and spring of 1976–1977 to support the album. This helped establish Boston as one of rock&#x27;s top acts within a short time, being nominated for a Grammy Award as a &quot;Best New Artist&quot;. Boston was the first band in history to make their New York City debut at Madison Square Garden.

The album spawned three singles, &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot;, &quot;Long Time&quot;, and &quot;Peace of Mind&quot;, all of which made the national charts. The album peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and remained on the charts for 132 weeks.

Despite having problems with manager Paul Ahern, being caught in the middle of a fight between Ahern and his business partner Charles McKenzie, and doing most of the recording work alone, Scholz completed the second Boston album two years after the debut album&#x27;s release. The second album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;, was released by Epic in August 1978. At the time, this was considered a long gap between albums, but Scholz still considered &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; to be a rush job and was unhappy with the album&#x27;s second side in particular. Overall, &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; sold about half as well as the debut album, eventually selling over 7 million records.

Another tour followed (playing with the likes of AC/DC, Black Sabbath, Van Halen, Sammy Hagar, and the Doobie Brothers), and the album&#x27;s title track became a top-five hit. Additionally, two other singles, &quot;A Man I&#x27;ll Never Be&quot; and &quot;Feelin&#x27; Satisfied&quot;, went top 40 and top 50, respectively. Despite the success, Scholz&#x27;s relationship with Ahern completely deteriorated. Delayed by technical renovations to his studio, Scholz eventually began the process of working on Boston&#x27;s third album, determined to complete the album at his own pace and up to his demanding standard.

===Solo projects and CBS lawsuit (1979–1985)===
In late 1979, Scholz began writing new material, but Boston&#x27;s former co-manager, Paul Ahern, argued that according to an agreement Scholz had signed years earlier with Ahern, Ahern owned a percentage of all songs Scholz wrote from that point on. Delayed further by the dispute, Scholz suggested that in the meantime, the individual members should work on whatever other projects they might be considering.
Goudreau then decided to record a solo album that featured Boston members Delp, who contributed vocals and co-wrote songs on the album and Sib Hashian, and which was recorded with the help of Paul Grupp, an engineer and producer familiar with Scholz&#x27;s studio techniques. The album, released in 1980, was titled &quot;Barry Goudreau&quot; and featured the minor hit single &quot;Dreams&quot;. Tension arose when CBS&#x27;s marketing connected Goudreau&#x27;s solo album to Boston&#x27;s signature guitar sound, despite Scholz not having played at all on this album. Scholz objected to the ad copy, but it became irrelevant when Epic dropped promotion on Goudreau&#x27;s album citing lack of interest. After a meeting with Scholz, Goudreau was fired from the band in 1981. Brad Delp, at the same meeting voiced his disapproval and told Scholz that he was quitting Boston but that he would record and complete the tour for that album. Goudreau then formed Orion the Hunter. After the tour for &quot;Third Stage&quot; ended in 1988, Delp teamed up with Goudreau and recorded the &quot;Return to Zero&quot; LP

While Scholz and Delp were recording new material for the third Boston album, CBS filed a $60 million lawsuit against Scholz, alleging breach of contract for failing to deliver a new Boston album on time.

During this same period, Scholz founded his high-tech company Scholz Research &amp; Development (SR&amp;D), which made amplifiers and other musical electronic equipment. Its most famous product, the Rockman amplifier, was introduced in 1982.

The legal trouble slowed progress toward the completion of the next album, which took six years to record and produce. Joining Scholz in the album&#x27;s development again were Delp and Jim Masdea. In 1985, guitarist Gary Pihl left Sammy Hagar&#x27;s touring band to work with Scholz as both a musician and an SR&amp;D executive. As CBS v. Scholz played out in court, CBS opted to withhold royalty payments to Scholz, hoping to force him to settle on unfavorable terms.

The lawsuit&#x27;s first round was eventually decided in Scholz&#x27;s favor, and Scholz moved the band to MCA Records.

The CBS case took seven years to run its course, and in April 1990, Scholz won.

===&quot;Third Stage&quot; (1986–1988)===
Despite the adversity, progress continued to be made on the third Boston album. A tape of one of the songs, &quot;Amanda&quot;, leaked out of the studio in 1983. The song became the lead single when &quot;Third Stage&quot; was finally released on September 23, 1986.

The album topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 while the lead single &quot;Amanda&quot; went to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and the subsequent singles &quot;We&#x27;re Ready&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;tcha Say&quot; reached numbers 9 and 20, respectively. &quot;Cool the Engines&quot; also got significant airplay on rock radio. The album sold over 4 million copies.

The group headed off on tour to promote &quot;Third Stage&quot; in 1987 and 1988. &quot;Third Stage&quot; was played in sequence in its entirety during the shows, with expanded arrangements of some cuts. Boston opened with &quot;Rock and Roll Band&quot; and brought back the original drummer, Jim Masdea, to play drums for this one song. For the tour, the group was joined by Doug Huffman and David Sikes, both of whom stayed with the band into the mid-1990s.

===Departure of Delp; &quot;Walk On&quot; (1989–1996)===
After the Third Stage Tour in 1988 Delp left Boston and formed RTZ with Barry Goudreau, releasing the &quot;Return to Zero&quot; LP in July 1991. With Delp&#x27;s departure, Scholz was then the last remaining original member. Before he left, Delp co-wrote with Scholz and David Sikes the song &quot;Walk On&quot;, which eventually became the title track of the new album.

Scholz eventually replaced Delp with vocalist Fran Cosmo, who had been in Goudreau&#x27;s previous band Orion the Hunter and sang on Goudreau&#x27;s 1980 solo album.

For the second album in a row, and for the second time in a decade, Scholz&#x27;s work was delayed by renovations to his studio. In the end, eight years passed between &quot;Third Stage&quot; and &quot;Walk On&quot;, which was released in June 1994. &quot;Walk On&quot; was certified platinum by the RIAA, and reached No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 Albums chart. Unlike Boston&#x27;s previous albums, it failed to chart in the top 5. It produced one hit single, &quot;I Need Your Love&quot;, which was widely played on some rock radio stations. Wanting to tour the album but finding that no one could sing the classic songs other than Delp, Scholz asked Delp to rejoin Boston at the end of 1994. Their first appearance was for two benefit shows at the House of Blues on December 12–13, 1994, in Cambridge. The band also handed a check of $5,000 to Globe Santa and another check of $5,000 to Operation Christmas in Fall River.

The group toured in the summer of 1995 with Cosmo and Delp combining vocals. By that time drummer Huffman had been replaced by Curly Smith, who was previously with Jo Jo Gunne. Following the conclusion of the &quot;Livin&#x27; For You&quot; tour in 1995, Scholz announced that a greatest hits album would be released. Initially planned for release in August 1996, the album was pushed back to a 1997 release date.

===&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and &quot;Corporate America&quot; (1997–2006)===
Boston released a compilation album in 1997, titled simply &quot;Boston: Greatest Hits&quot;. The album featured all of the band&#x27;s hit singles except &quot;We&#x27;re Ready&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;tcha Say (You Believe In Me)/Still In Love&quot;, and &quot;I Need Your Love&quot; along with three new songs, &quot;Higher Power&quot;, &quot;Tell Me&quot;, and an instrumental version of the &quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot;. Smith and Sikes left the band in late 1997 and recorded an album together.
Scholz headed back to the studio in 1998 to begin work on a fifth album, which eventually turned out to be &quot;Corporate America&quot;. The title track of &quot;Corporate America&quot; was uploaded by Tom Scholz to MP3.com under the pseudonym of &quot;Downer&#x27;s Revenge&quot; in early 2002 in order to test the album&#x27;s appeal to a younger demographic. The song reached No. 2 on the progressive rock charts on the website for two weeks.

November 2002 marked the release of &quot;Corporate America&quot; on the independent label Artemis Records. This album featured the largest Boston lineup ever; returning members included Delp and Cosmo on rhythm guitar and lead vocals, Scholz on lead guitar and keyboards, and Gary Pihl on guitar, along with new members Anthony Cosmo on rhythm guitar, Jeff Neal on drums, and Kimberley Dahme on bass, acoustic guitar, and vocals. Dahme, Delp, and Cosmo all contributed lead vocals to the album. Due to lack of promotion on Artemis Records part, Tom Scholz sued Artemis. Artemis settled and subsequently went out of business but with that took that album with them. The album has been out of print for 20 years. The group embarked on a national tour in support of the album in 2003 and 2004. In 2006, the first two Boston albums appeared in remastered form.

===Death of Brad Delp (2007)===
On March 9, 2007, lead singer Delp died by suicide at his home in Atkinson, New Hampshire. Police found him dead in his master bathroom, along with several notes for whoever would find him. In the bathroom where he died, two charcoal grills were found on the bathroom fixtures, and the door was sealed with duct tape and a towel underneath. Police called the death &quot;untimely&quot; and said no foul play was indicated. Delp was alone at the time of his death, according to the police report. He was found by his fiancée, who saw a dryer hose attached to his car. According to the New Hampshire medical examiner, his death was the result of suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. Delp&#x27;s last concert with Boston was performed at Boston Symphony Hall on November 13, 2006, at a concert honoring Doug Flutie.

A concert in honor of Delp named &quot;Come Together: A Tribute to Brad Delp&quot; occurred on August 19, 2007, at the Bank of America Pavilion in Boston. The concert included Ernie and the Automatics, Beatlejuice, Farrenheit, Extreme, Godsmack, RTZ, Orion the Hunter, and finally the current version of Boston.

All of the living members of Boston were invited to perform in the concert. The singers for Boston included Michael Sweet of Stryper, former band member Curly Smith, band member Kimberley Dahme, and a Boston fan from North Carolina named Tommy DeCarlo, who was chosen to sing based on his performances of Boston cover songs on his MySpace page.

===New line-up and intermittent performances (2008–2012)===
The ongoing conflicts among the surviving band members spilled over to the 2008 Presidential campaign. Barry Goudreau appeared with Mike Huckabee and played with him at some rallies in New Hampshire. Huckabee used &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot; as a campaign theme song. Scholz, a self-described &quot;Obama supporter&quot;, sent an open letter to Huckabee in February 2008 stating that the band had never endorsed any candidate, and that he had never authorized the use of &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot; as Huckabee&#x27;s theme song. Scholz made a point of saying that he, and not Goudreau or Sheehan, actually played all the guitars on &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot; as well as most of Boston&#x27;s songs. Huckabee eventually stopped using the song for his campaign.

In the spring of 2008, Scholz and Sweet introduced a new Boston lineup, which subsequently did a North American summer tour, playing 53 dates in 12 weeks (on a double bill with Styx). Scholz was the only founding member of Boston to play on the tour, although longtime member Gary Pihl was also part of the band, and Dahme and Neal returned on bass and drums, respectively. DeCarlo and Sweet shared lead vocals.

In January 2009, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was re-released as a remastered disc.

Michael Sweet left the band in August 2011, in order to focus on Stryper. In 2012, guitarist and vocalist David Victor joined the band, beginning in the studio, where he contributed vocals to several tracks on the album in progress.

Scholz and Pihl led the band on a 2012 North American tour, beginning on June 28, 2012, at the Seminole Hard Rock Live arena in Hollywood, Florida and ending on September 8 at the U.S. Cellular Grandstand in Hutchinson, Kansas. Victor and DeCarlo shared lead vocals, with drummer Curly Smith returning for the first time in over a decade, and former Stryper member Tracy Ferrie on bass. Neither Dahme nor Neal played on the tour.

===&quot;Life, Love &amp; Hope&quot; (2013–2017)===
Boston&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Life, Love &amp; Hope&quot;, was released on December 3, 2013, by Frontiers Records; it includes lead vocals from Brad Delp, Tommy DeCarlo, Kimberley Dahme, David Victor, and Tom Scholz. Work on the album started in 2002. On December 11, 2013, Boston re-recorded a Christmas song, &quot;God Rest Ye Metal Gentlemen 2013&quot; (previously released in 2002 as &quot;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen&quot;). In 2014 Boston embarked on the &quot;Heaven on Earth Tour&quot; spanning the United States and Japan with a lineup including Scholz, Pihl, DeCarlo, Victor and Ferrie. Dahme returned, this time performing rhythm guitar and vocals, and drumming duties were split between Neal and Smith, with Neal handling the first leg of the tour. Victor departed the lineup partway through the tour due to creative differences. In his stead, Siobhan Magnus joined the tour as a guest vocalist in July, performing lead vocals on &quot;Walk On&quot;.

In 2015, Boston launched another tour with a lineup consisting of Scholz, Pihl, DeCarlo, Ferrie and new member Beth Cohen, who performed keyboards, rhythm guitar and vocals. Cohen had previously recorded with the group on both &quot;Corporate America&quot; and &quot;Life, Love &amp; Hope&quot; as a vocalist and flautist. Initially, the lineup was to include former Spock&#x27;s Beard drummer and vocalist Nick D&#x27;Virgilio for its first month of shows, with Neal then returning, but D&#x27;Virgilio proved &quot;not the right fit&quot; and Smith rejoined in his place. This seven-person lineup proved Boston&#x27;s most stable lineup in some time, touring as well in the summers of 2016 and 2017. The 2016 tour marked the group&#x27;s 40th anniversary and included shows in Boston&#x27;s Wang Theatre, their first full performances in their namesake town since 1994.

On March 22, 2017, former drummer Sib Hashian died after collapsing on a Legends of Rock cruise ship.

===Upcoming seventh album (2017–present)===
In April 2017, Scholz reported that he has been writing new material for the seventh Boston album. He told &quot;Sun Herald&quot;, &quot;I find that I&#x27;m in a position that I really need to write things that we can play at the shows. We play basically everything that people expect to hear that we can fit into two hours. We also do a lot of things that aren&#x27;t on any of the records by adding things and segues and instrumental parts, so I always have to come up with new stuff. It&#x27;s quite a challenge. I have to write new things for the tour every year, which is what I wanted to do in the first place. But I got sidetracked in the studio, recording. Now, I&#x27;m actually a performing musician, and I have to tell you, it&#x27;s much more fun.&quot; When asked the same month about a potential release date of the album, Scholz said, &quot;Who knows? I&#x27;m only 70. I figure I&#x27;ve got 30 years.&quot; While Scholz has vaguely stated that he is working on new music, the band has not toured since 2017 and no plans have been mentioned about a tour or new album. In an August 2024 interview with MIT Technology Review, Scholz revealed that his Analog studio equipment is in need of repair and &quot;Unfortunately there&#x27;s almost no one left locally that can repair or maintain analog equipment.&quot; Scholz also stated that &quot;I&#x27;m still writing music, believe it or not, with what&#x27;s left of my brain. It&#x27;s very frustrating not to be able to go in and record what I hear.&quot;

==Spaceship theme==
A prominent theme on Boston&#x27;s album covers is the presence of a guitar-shaped spaceship, ostensibly a generation or colony ship carrying the city of Boston inside a clear dome, with the city&#x27;s name emblazoned across the front. The original spaceship was designed in 1976 by Paula Scher and illustrated by Roger Huyssen with lettering by Gerard Huerta for Epic Records.

===Appearances===
*&quot;Boston&quot; (1976) – Two long lines of guitar shaped starships flee a planet that is breaking apart. The ships all have blue flames coming out of the bottom.
*&quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; (1978) – The Boston ship is flying low or perhaps hovering over a grassy, crystalline planet. The ship has searchlights on.
*&quot;Third Stage&quot; (1986) – The Boston ship is headed towards a large flat spaceship resembling a bank of pipe organ pipes over a blue planet.
*&quot;Walk On&quot; (1994) – The Boston ship is shown crashing through a rock outcropping.
*&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (1997, compilation album) – The Boston ship is flying low over a planet with turquoise rocks and a turquoise tower in the distance.
*&quot;Corporate America&quot; (2002) – The Boston ship is flying towards Earth and the United States.
*&quot;Life, Love &amp; Hope&quot; (2013) – The Boston ship is flying in space, near a nebula.

Their spaceship also appeared on their tours in the late 1980s, early 1990s, and early 2000s in the form of a giant lighting rig and accompanied on stage by their giant pipe-organ set piece, which is known to Boston insiders as Bertha because of its sheer size.

It is also thought that the Boston logo could represent a front view of the spaceship, with the top being shaped similarly to the city dome and the left and right &quot;fins&quot; corresponding to the edges of the ship.

==Innovation and style==
Boston&#x27;s genre is mostly described as hard rock and arena rock. The band has also incorporated elements of progressive rock into its music.

Boston founder, guitarist, and primary songwriter Tom Scholz&#x27;s blend of musical styles, ranging from classical to 1960s English pop, has resulted in a sound characterized by multiple lead and blended harmonies guitar work (usually harmonized in thirds), often alternating between and then mixing electric and acoustic guitars. The band&#x27;s harmonic style has been characterized as being &quot;violin-like&quot; without using synthesizers. Scholz developed complex, multi-tracked guitar harmonies, using handmade, high-tech equipment, such as the Rockman, used by artists such as Journey guitarist Neal Schon and the band ZZ Top. Def Leppard&#x27;s album &quot;Hysteria&quot; was created using only Rockman technology.

Tom Scholz also credited Brad Delp with helping to create Boston&#x27;s sound with his vocal style. Delp, who was influenced by the Beatles, had an extended vocal range, shown on hits such as &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot;.

<doc id="167666" wikidata="Q1783187" url="?curid=167666" title="Artful Dodger">
<text>Jack Dawkins, better known as the Artful Dodger, is a character in Charles Dickens&#x27;s 1838 novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. The Dodger is a pickpocket and his nickname refers to his skill and cunning in that occupation. In the novel, he is the leader of the gang of child criminals on the streets of London trained and overseen by the elderly Fagin. The term has become an idiom describing a person who engages in skillful deception.

==Role in the novel==

In the novel, Jack becomes Oliver&#x27;s closest friend (although he betrays Oliver when Oliver is caught) and he tries to make him a pickpocket, but he soon realises that Oliver will not succeed and feels sorry for him, saying &quot;What a pity it is he isn&#x27;t a prig!&quot; He also has a close relationship with Charley Bates. 

The Artful Dodger is characterised as a child who acts like an adult. He is described as wearing adult clothes which are much too large for him. Like an adult, he seldom gives in to childish urges:

Ultimately the Dodger is caught with a stolen silver snuff box and presumably transported from England to a penal colony in Australia (only alluded to in the novel). The absurdity of the master pickpocket being caught over something so small is remarked upon in the book:

The Dodger chooses to consider himself a &quot;victim of society&quot;, roaring in the courtroom, &quot;I am an Englishman, ain&#x27;t I? Where are my priwileges?&quot; The jailer tells him &quot;You&#x27;ll get your privileges soon enough&quot;, while the judge has little patience for the Dodger&#x27;s posturing and orders him out of the courtroom immediately after the jury convicts him of the theft. Dickens describes him this way:

Dickens had first used a similar term to &quot;Artful Dodger&quot; in his previous novel, &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;. At the close of Chapter 16, Sam Weller refers to the recent schemes of Mr Jingle: &quot;Reg&#x27;lar do, sir; artful dodge.&quot;

The Artful Dodger, though a pickpocket, is not a heartless character. He has a great respect for Fagin – &quot;There ain&#x27;t no teacher like Fagin!&quot; (chapter 3) – to whom he delivers all of the pickpocketing spoils without question.

== Actors who have played the role ==
The role of the Artful Dodger has been played by several notable performers in adaptations of the novel. 

=== Stage ===
The role of the Artful Doger was amplified in the musical &quot;Oliver!&quot;. The part was first played by Martin Horsey, and later by Tony Robinson, Davy Jones, Leonard Whiting, Steve Marriott, and Phil Collins. Others to have played the role in amateur productions include Adam Levine, Ben Elton, Robbie Williams, Joe Jonas, Claire Josefson, and Hayley Smith.

=== Television ===
For the 1962 BBC TV serial, Melvyn Hayes portrayed the character in a manner that reviewers described as faithful to the book&#x27;s original depiction. 

In the 1980 ATV series &quot;The Further Adventures of Oliver Twist&quot;, the Dodger was played by John Fowler. In this sequel to &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, Oliver, who has been sent to a Northern boarding school by Mr. Brownlow, finds that through Oliver&#x27;s uncle Harry Maylie&#x27;s intercession the Dodger escaped transportation to Australia and was instead enrolled in the school. The two friends re-unite, and when Oliver flees the school the Dodger follows him back to London after learning of a plot against him. Oliver is made to believe, by Noah Claypole, Noah&#x27;s girlfriend Charlotte, and Mrs Carraway (Mr Brownlow&#x27;s corrupt new housekeeper), that Mr. Brownlow is ill to the point of death. After Dodger rescues Oliver from imprisonment in the Brownlow cellar and the two are accused by Mrs. Carraway and Claypole of theft, he and Oliver are forced to take to the streets to uncover the truth, encountering Mr. Bumble, the villainous Monks and their old mentor Fagin (who had escaped execution) along the way; at the series&#x27; conclusion, Mr. Brownlow also adopts Dodger as his son along with Oliver.

Elijah Wood also portrayed the character in the 1997 television film, which aired as part of The Wonderful World of Disney on ABC. 

In the BBC adaptation of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; in 2007, he was played by Adam Arnold. 

In the 2023 8-part Hulu miniseries &quot;The Artful Dodger&quot;, Thomas Brodie-Sangster plays Jack Dawkins—a semi-reformed Artful Dodger in his adulthood—who goes on to become a decorated Navy officer and skilled surgeon, yet remains unable and unwilling to fully escape a life of crime. The series takes place in 1850s Australia, over a decade after the events depicted in Dickens&#x27; Oliver Twist.

=== Film ===
Anthony Newley played the character in a 1948 film adaptation of the story. 

In the 1968 film &quot;Oliver!&quot;, Jack Wild played the role and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. 

The Artful Dodger was played by Harry Eden in Roman Polanski&#x27;s big-budget 2005 film version. 

In the 2021 film &quot;Twist&quot;, Rita Ora played the role.

== Cultural influences ==
Argentine football player and 1986 FIFA World Cup winning captain Diego Maradona was frequently referred to as the Artful Dodger due to his cunning personality and ability to get away with fouls, such as disguising the illegal use of his hand, as he infamously did when scoring with the &quot;Hand of God&quot;.

Condredge Holloway, the quarterback for the University of Tennessee Volunteers (1972–74), was known as &quot;The Artful Dodger&quot; for his scrambling prowess and elusive manner. Holloway was the first African-American starting quarterback in the history of Southeastern Conference football, went on to star in the Canadian Football League from 1975 through 1987, and was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1999.

==Modern interpretations==
In Walt Disney&#x27;s 1988 animated feature film version of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, &quot;Oliver and Company&quot;, the character of the Artful Dodger was changed to a streetwise mutt simply named Dodger. The voice was provided by musician Billy Joel.

In Saban&#x27;s Adventures of Oliver Twist, Artful Dodger is voiced by Brianne Siddall and resembles a rabbit.

In 1996, Jean Loup Wolfman played the role in an adaptation by Seth Michael Donsky entitled &quot;Twisted&quot;. The film is set in a contemporary New York City underground populated by drag queens, drug abusers and hustlers. The Artful Dodger is a gay rent boy and hustler called Arthur, better known among his clientele as &quot;Fine Art&quot;. He befriends the Oliver Twist character called Lee (played by Keivyn McNeill Grayes), the latter a black adolescent runaway.

In the first edition of Alan Moore and Kevin O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s comic series &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;, set in 1898 London, the Dodger briefly appears as an elderly man running his own gang of boy thieves, hinting that he is still following in Fagin&#x27;s footsteps.

In 2001, the Artful Dodger was the subject of an Australian children&#x27;s show called &quot;Escape of the Artful Dodger&quot;. The show followed the Artful Dodger&#x27;s adventures in the Australian penal colony in New South Wales, as well as his eventual redemption. Oliver Twist and Fagin also appeared.

In the 2003 film &quot;Twist&quot;, the Artful Dodger is called Dodge and is played by Nick Stahl. The film is told from his point of view, in which he is a drug addict influenced by Fagin.

In the 2010 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio drama &quot;Legend of the Cybermen&quot;, the Artful Dodger is one of the characters seen in the land of fiction. He was voiced by Steven Kynman.

In Tony Lee&#x27;s 2011 novel &quot;Dodge &amp; Twist&quot;, set twelve years after the events of Oliver Twist, Dodger has returned to England a changed man from his time in Australia, and is planning a heist. However he cannot escape the &#x27;ghost&#x27; of Fagin, who still guides his actions, even past the grave.

In Terry Pratchett&#x27;s 2012 novel &quot;Dodger&quot;, the title character bears certain similarities to the Dickens character. The sampler of the book also includes him meeting an astute gentleman who concerns himself with the well-being of the poor called Charlie Dickens.

A 2014 novel by Peter David, &quot;Artful&quot;, features the Artful Dodger as the main character, and depicts his life following the events of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, which includes confrontations with vampires, one of whom is revealed to be Fagin. The storyline of that novel was continued in a comic book series of the same name.

In the late 2015 BBC series &quot;Dickensian&quot;, the Artful Dodger is portrayed by Wilson Radjou-Pujalte.

In the 2021 film &quot;Twist&quot;, the Artful Dodger is gender-flipped into a woman and played by Rita Ora.

In the 2022 CBBC series, &quot;Dodger&quot;, the Artful Dodger is portrayed by Billy Jenkins.

In the 2023 miniseries &quot;The Artful Dodger&quot;, which is set in 1850s Australia, the titular character is portrayed by Thomas Brodie-Sangster.

<text>The Eurofighter Typhoon is a European multinational twin-engine, supersonic, canard delta wing, multirole fighter. The Typhoon was designed originally as an air-superiority fighter and is manufactured by a consortium of Airbus, BAE Systems and Leonardo that conducts the majority of the project through a joint holding company, Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug GmbH. The NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency, representing the UK, Germany, Italy and Spain, manages the project and is the prime customer.

The aircraft&#x27;s development effectively began in 1983 with the Future European Fighter Aircraft programme, a multinational collaboration among the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Previously, Germany, Italy and the UK had jointly developed and deployed the Panavia Tornado combat aircraft and desired to collaborate on a new project, with additional participating EU nations. Disagreements over design authority and operational requirements however, led France to leave the consortium to develop the Dassault Rafale independently. A technology demonstration aircraft, the British Aerospace EAP, first flew on 6 August 1986; a Eurofighter prototype made its maiden flight on 27 March 1994. The aircraft&#x27;s name, Typhoon, was adopted in September 1998 and the first production contracts were also signed that year.

The sudden end of the Cold War reduced European demand for fighter aircraft and led to debate over the aircraft&#x27;s cost and work share and protracted the Typhoon&#x27;s development: the Typhoon entered operational service in 2003 and is now in service with the air forces of Austria, Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, Saudi Arabia and Oman. Kuwait and Qatar have also ordered the aircraft, bringing the procurement total to 680 aircraft .

The Eurofighter Typhoon is a highly agile aircraft, designed to be an effective dogfighter in combat. Later production aircraft have been increasingly better equipped to undertake air-to-surface strike missions and to be compatible with an increasing number of different armaments and equipment, including Storm Shadow, Brimstone and Marte ER missiles. The Typhoon had its combat debut during the 2011 military intervention in Libya with the UK&#x27;s Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Italian Air Force, performing aerial reconnaissance and ground-strike missions. The type has also taken primary responsibility for air-defence duties for the majority of customer nations.
==Development==
===Origins===

In the UK, as early as 1971, work commenced on the development of a manoeuvrable, tactical aircraft to replace the SEPECAT Jaguar (that was then about to enter service with the RAF). This work soon expanded to include an air superiority capability. A specification titled &quot;Air Staff Target 403&quot; (AST 403), in 1972, led to the Hawker P.96, an unbuilt design with a relatively conventional planform, including a separate tail structure, in the late 1970s.

Simultaneously, in West Germany, the requirement for a new fighter had resulted in competition between Dornier, VFW-Fokker and Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) for a future &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; contract known as &quot;Taktisches Kampfflugzeug 90&quot; (&quot;Tactical Combat Aircraft 90&quot;; TKF-90). Dornier collaborated with Northrop in the US on an acclaimed, but unsuccessful design, known as the . MBB was successful, with a design including a cranked delta wing, close-coupled-canard controls, and artificial stability.

In 1979, MBB and British Aerospace (BAe) presented a formal proposal to their respective governments for a collaboration, to be known as the European Collaborative Fighter, or &quot;European Combat Fighter&quot; (ECF). In October 1979, French firm Dassault joined the ECF project. It was at this stage of development the Eurofighter name was first attached to the aircraft. The development of three separate prototypes continued however: MBB continued to refine its TKF-90 concept, and Dassault produced a design known as the ACX.

In the meantime, while the P.96 would have met the original UK specification, it had been cancelled because it was considered to offer little potential for future upgrades and redevelopment. In addition, there was a feeling within the UK aircraft industry that the P.96 would have been too similar to the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet, which was then known to be at an advanced stage of development. The P.96 would not have been available until long after the Hornet, which would therefore likely have met and closed off most potential export markets for the P.96. BAe then produced two new proposals: the P.106B, a single-engined lightweight fighter, superficially resembling the JAS 39 Gripen, and the twin-engine P.110. The RAF rejected the P.106 concept on the grounds it had &quot;half the effectiveness of the two-engined aircraft at two-thirds of the cost&quot;.

The ECF project collapsed in 1981 for several reasons, including differing requirements, Dassault&#x27;s insistence on &quot;design leadership&quot; and the British preference for a new version of the RB199 to power the aircraft versus the French preference for the new Snecma M88.
Consequently, the Panavia partners (MBB, BAe and Aeritalia) launched the &quot;Agile Combat Aircraft&quot; (ACA) programme in April 1982. BAe designers agreed with the overall configuration of the proposed MBB TKF-90, although they rejected some of its more ambitious features such as engine vectoring nozzles and vented trailing edge controls – a form of boundary layer control. The ACA, like the BAe P.110, had a cranked delta wing, canards and a twin tail. One major external difference was the replacement of the side-mounted engine intakes with a chin intake. The ACA was to be powered by a modified version of the RB199. The German and Italian governments withdrew funding, and the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) agreed to fund 50% of the cost with the remaining 50% to be provided by industry. MBB and Aeritalia signed up and it was agreed that the aircraft would be produced at two sites: BAe Warton and an MBB factory in Germany. In May 1983, BAe announced a contract with the MoD for the development and production of an ACA demonstrator, the Experimental Aircraft Programme.

In 1983, Italy, Germany, France, the UK and Spain launched the &quot;Future European Fighter Aircraft&quot; (FEFA) programme. The aircraft was to have short take off and landing (STOL) and beyond visual range (BVR) capabilities. In 1984, France reiterated its requirement for a carrier-capable version and demanded a leading role. Italy, West Germany and the UK opted out and established a new EFA programme. In Turin on 2 August 1985, West Germany, the UK and Italy agreed to go ahead with the Eurofighter; and confirmed France, along with Spain, had chosen not to proceed as a member of the project. Despite pressure from France, Spain rejoined the Eurofighter project in early September 1985. France officially withdrew from the project to pursue its own ACX project, which was to become the Dassault Rafale.

By 1986, the programme&#x27;s cost had reached £180 million. When the EAP programme had started, the cost was supposed to be equally shared by government and industry, but the West German and Italian governments wavered on the agreement and the British government and private finance had to provide £100 million to keep the programme from ending. In April 1986, the British Aerospace EAP was rolled out at BAe Warton. The EAP first flew on 6 August 1986. The Eurofighter bears a strong resemblance to the EAP. Design work continued over the next five years using data from the EAP. Initial requirements were: UK: 250 aircraft, Germany: 250, Italy: 165 and Spain: 100. The share of the production work was divided among the countries in proportion to their projected procurement – BAe (33%), DASA (33%), Aeritalia (21%), and Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA) (13%).

The Munich-based Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug GmbH was established in 1986 to manage development of the project and EuroJet Turbo GmbH, the alliance of Rolls-Royce, MTU Aero Engines, FiatAvio (now Avio) and ITP for development of the EJ200. The aircraft was known as Eurofighter EFA from the late 1980s until it was renamed EF 2000 in 1992.

By 1990, the selection of the aircraft&#x27;s radar had become a major stumbling-block. The UK, Italy and Spain supported the Ferranti Defence Systems-led ECR-90, while Germany preferred the APG-65-based MSD2000 (a collaboration between Hughes, AEG and GEC-Marconi). An agreement was reached after UK Defence Secretary Tom King assured his West German counterpart Gerhard Stoltenberg that the British government would approve the project and allow the GEC subsidiary Marconi Electronic Systems to acquire Ferranti Defence Systems from its parent, the Ferranti Group, which was in financial and legal difficulties. GEC thus withdrew its support for the MSD2000.

===Delays===
The financial burdens placed on Germany by reunification caused Helmut Kohl to make an election promise to cancel the Eurofighter. In early to mid-1991 German Defence Minister Volker Rühe sought to withdraw Germany from the project in favour of using Eurofighter technology in a cheaper, lighter plane. Because of the amount of money already spent on development, the number of jobs dependent on the project, and the binding commitments on each partner government, Kohl was unable to withdraw; &quot;Rühe&#x27;s predecessors had locked themselves into the project by a punitive penalty system of their own devising.&quot;
In 1995 concerns over workshare appeared. Since the formation of Eurofighter the workshare split had been agreed at 33/33/21/13 (United Kingdom/Germany/Italy/Spain) based on the number of units being ordered by each contributing nation, all the nations then reduced their orders. The UK cut its orders from 250 to 232, Germany from 250 to 140, Italy from 165 to 121 and Spain from 100 to 87. According to these order levels the workshare split should have been 39/24/22/15 UK/Germany/Italy/Spain, however Germany was unwilling to give up such a large amount of work. In January 1996, after much negotiation between German and UK partners, a compromise was reached whereby Germany would purchase another 40 aircraft. The workshare split was therefore UK 37.42%, Germany 29.03%, Italy 19.52% and Spain 14.03%.

At the 1996 Farnborough Airshow the UK announced funding for the construction phase of the project. On 22 December 1997 the defence ministers of the four partner nations signed the contract for production of the Eurofighter.

===Testing===
The maiden flight of the Eurofighter prototype took place in Bavaria on 27 March 1994, flown by DASA chief test pilot Peter Weger. In December 2004, Eurofighter Typhoon IPA4 began three months of Cold Environmental Trials (CET) at the Vidsel Air Base in Sweden, the purpose of which was to verify the operational behaviour of the aircraft and its systems in temperatures between −25 and 31 °C. The maiden flight of Instrumented Production Aircraft7 (IPA7), the first fully equipped Tranche2 aircraft, took place from EADS&#x27; Manching airfield on 16 January 2008.

===Procurement, production and costs===
The first production contract was signed on 30 January 1998 between Eurofighter GmbH, Eurojet and NETMA. The procurement totals were as follows: the UK 232, Germany 180, Italy 121, and Spain 87. Production was again allotted according to procurement: BAe (37.42%), DASA (29.03%), Aeritalia (19.52%), and CASA (14.03%).

On 2 September 1998, a naming ceremony was held at Farnborough, United Kingdom. This saw the Typhoon name formally adopted, initially for export aircraft only. The name continues the storm theme started by the Panavia Tornado. This was reportedly resisted by Germany; the Hawker Typhoon was a fighter-bomber aircraft used by the RAF during the Second World War to attack German targets. The name &quot;Spitfire II&quot; (after the famous British Second World War fighter, the Supermarine Spitfire) had also been considered and rejected for the same reason early in the development programme. In September 1998, contracts were signed for production of 148 Tranche1 aircraft and procurement of long lead-time items for Tranche2 aircraft. In March 2008, the final Tranche1 aircraft was delivered to the German Air Force. On 21 October 2008, the RAF&#x27;s first two of 91 Tranche2 aircraft, were delivered to RAF Coningsby.

In July 2009, after almost 2 years of negotiations, the planned Tranche 3 purchase was split into 2 parts and the Tranche 3A contract was signed by the partner nations. The &quot;Tranche 3B&quot; order did not go ahead.

The Eurofighter Typhoon is unique in modern combat aircraft in that there are four separate assembly lines. Each partner company assembles its own national aircraft, but builds the same parts for all aircraft (including exports); Premium AEROTEC (main centre fuselage), EADS CASA (right wing, leading edge slats), BAE Systems (BAE) (front fuselage (including foreplanes), canopy, dorsal spine, tail fin, inboard flaperons, rear fuselage section) and Leonardo (left wing, outboard flaperons, rear fuselage sections).

Production is divided into three tranches (see table below). Tranches are a production/funding distinction, and do not imply an incremental increase in capability with each tranche. Tranche3 are based on late Tranche2 aircraft with improvements added. Tranche3 was split into A and B parts. Tranches were further divided up into production standard/capability blocks and funding/procurement batches, though these did not coincide, and are not the same thing; e.g., the Eurofighter designated &quot;FGR4&quot; by the RAF is a Tranche 1, block 5. Batch1 covered block 1, but batch2 covered blocks 2, 2B and 5. On 25 May 2011 the 100th production aircraft, ZK315, rolled off the production line at Warton.

In 1985 the estimated cost of 250 UK aircraft was £7 billion. By 1997 the estimated cost was £17 billion; by 2003, £20 billion, and the in-service date (2003, defined as the date of delivery of the first aircraft to the RAF) was 54 months late. After 2003, the MoD refused to release updated cost-estimates on the grounds of commercial sensitivity. However, in 2011, the National Audit Office estimated the UK&#x27;s &quot;assessment, development, production and upgrade costs eventually hit £22.9 billion&quot; and total programme costs would reach £37billion.

By 2007, Germany estimated the system cost (aircraft and training, plus spare parts) at €120million and said it was in perpetual increase. On 17 June 2009, Germany ordered 31 aircraft of Tranche 3A for €2.8billion, leading to a system cost of €90million per aircraft. The UK&#x27;s Committee of Public Accounts reported that mismanagement of the project had helped increase the cost of each aircraft by seventy-five percent. The Spanish MoD put the cost of their Typhoon project up to December 2010 at €11.718billion, up from an original €9.255billion and implying a system cost for their 73 aircraft of €160million.

On 31 March 2009, a Eurofighter Typhoon fired an AIM-120 AMRAAM whilst having its radar in passive mode for the first time; the necessary target data for the missile was acquired by the radar of a second Eurofighter Typhoon and transmitted using the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS). The entire Typhoon fleet passed the 500,000 flying hours milestone in 2018. As of August 2019, a total of 623 orders had been received.

In July 2016, the ten-year Typhoon Total Availability Enterprise (TyTAN) support deal between the RAF and industry partners BAE and Leonardo was announced that aims to reduce the Typhoon&#x27;s per-hour operating cost by 30 to 40 percent. This should equate to a saving of at least £550million ($712million), which &quot;will be recycled into the programme&quot; and, according to BAE, will result in the Typhoon having a per-hour operating cost &quot;equivalent to a F-16&quot;. By 2022 it was estimated that savings would be &quot;over £500million.&quot;

===Upgrades===
In 2000, the UK selected the Meteor from MBDA as the long range air-to-air missile armament for its Typhoons with an in-service date (ISD) of December 2011. In December 2002, France, Germany, Spain and Sweden joined the British in a $1.9bn contract for Meteor on Typhoon, the Dassault Rafale and the Saab Gripen. The protracted contract negotiations pushed the ISD to August 2012, and it was further put back by Eurofighter&#x27;s failure to make trials aircraft available to the Meteor partners. In 2014 the &quot;second element of the Phase1 Enhancements package known as &#x27;P1Eb&#x27;&quot; was announced, allowing &quot;Typhoon to realise both its air-to-air and air-to-ground capability to full effect&quot;.

In 2011 &quot;Flight International&quot; reported that budgetary pressures being encountered by the four original partner nations were limiting upgrades. For example, the four original partner nations were reluctant at that stage to fund enhancements that extend the aircraft&#x27;s air-to-ground capability, such as integration of the MBDA Storm Shadow cruise missile.

Tranche 3 aircraft ESM/ECM enhancements have focused on improving radiating jamming power with antenna modifications, while EuroDASS is reported to offer a range of new capabilities, including the addition of a digital receiver, extending band coverage to low frequencies (VHF/UHF) and introducing an interferometric receiver with extremely precise geolocation functionalities. On the jamming side, EuroDASS is looking to low-band (VHF/UHF) jamming, more capable antennae, new ECM techniques, while protection against missile is to be enhanced through a new passive MWS in addition to the active devices already on board the aircraft. The latest support for self-protection will however originate from the new AESA radar which is to replace the Captor system, providing in a spiralled programme with passive, active and cyberwarfare RF capabilities. Selex ES has developed a self-contained expendable Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) jammer for fast jet aircraft known as BriteCloud which is being studied for integration on the Typhoon.
Eurojet is attempting to find funding to test thrust vectoring control (TVC) nozzles on a flight demonstrator. In April 2014, BAE announced new wind tunnel tests to assess the aerodynamic characteristics of conformal fuel tanks (CFTs). The CFTs, which can be fitted to any Tranche 3 aircraft, could carry 1,500 litres each to increase the Typhoon&#x27;s combat radius by a factor of 25% to 1,500 n miles (2,778 km).

BAE has completed development of its Striker II Helmet-Mounted Display that builds on the capabilities of the original Striker Helmet-Mounted Display, which is already in service on the Typhoon. Striker II features a new display with more colour and can transition between day and night seamlessly eliminating the need for separate night vision goggles. In addition, the helmet can monitor the pilot&#x27;s exact head position so it always knows exactly what information to display. The system is compatible with ANR, a 3-D audio threats system and 3-D communications; these are available as customer options. In 2015, BAE was awarded a £1.7million contract to study the feasibility of a common weapon launcher that could be capable of carrying multiple weapons and weapon types on a single pylon.
Also in 2015, Airbus flight tested a package of aerodynamic upgrades for the Eurofighter known as the Aerodynamic Modification Kit (AMK) consisting of reshaped (delta) fuselage strakes, extended trailing-edge flaperons and leading-edge root extensions. This increases wing lift by 25% resulting in an increased turn rate, tighter turning radius, and improved nose-pointing ability at low speed with angle of attack values around 45% greater and roll rates up to 100% higher. Eurofighter&#x27;s Laurie Hilditch said these improvements should increase subsonic turn rate by 15% and give the Eurofighter the sort of &quot;knife-fight in a phone box&quot; turning capability enjoyed by rivals such as Boeing&#x27;s F/A-18E/F or the Lockheed Martin F-16, without sacrificing the transonic and supersonic high-energy agility inherent to its delta wing-canard configuration. Eurofighter Project Pilot Germany Raffaele Beltrame said: &quot;The handling qualities appeared to be markedly improved, providing more manoeuvrability, agility and precision while performing tasks representative of in-service operations. And it is extremely interesting to consider the potential benefits in the air-to-surface configuration thanks to the increased variety and flexibility of stores that can be carried.&quot;

In April 2016, Finmeccanica (now Leonardo) demonstrated the air-to-ground capabilities of its Mode5 Reverse-Identification friend or foe (IFF) system which showed that it is possible to give pilots the ability to distinguish between friendly and enemy platforms in a simple fashion using the aircraft&#x27;s existing transponder. Finmeccanica said NATO is considering the system as a short- to mid-term solution for air-to-surface identification of friendly forces and thus avoid collateral damages due to friendly fire during close air support operations.

====UK Project Centurion upgrades====
With the confirmed retirement date of March 2019 for RAF Tornado GR4s, in 2014 the UK commenced an upgrade programme that would eventually become the £425 million Project Centurion to ensure the Typhoon was able to assume the precision strike duties of the ageing Tornado. The upgrade was delivered under different phases:
*Phase 0 – initial multirole upgrades.
*Phase 1/P2EA – MBDA Meteor integration and initial Storm Shadow Capability.
*Phase 2/P3EA – Full Storm Shadow capability as well as Brimstone integration.

Phase 1 standard aircraft were used operationally for the first time as part of Operation Shader over Iraq and Syria in 2018. On 18 December 2018 the RAF approved release to service for the full Project Centurion package.

====Proposed upgrade for German Tornado replacement====
On 24 April 2018, Airbus announced its offer to replace Germany&#x27;s Panavia Tornado fleet, proposing the integration of new weaponry, performance enhancements and additional capabilities to the Eurofighter Typhoon. This is similar to that being performed as part of the UK&#x27;s Project Centurion. Integration of air-to-ground weapons already has begun on German Typhoons as part of Project Odin. Among the weapons being offered are the Kongsberg Joint Strike Missile for the anti-ship mission and the Taurus cruise missile.

The consortium is keen to make use of the engine&#x27;s growth potential to boost thrust by around 15% as well as improve fuel efficiency and range. This will be combined with a new design and enlarged 1,800-litre fuel tank. The aircraft currently is fitted with 1,000-litre fuel tanks. Other modifications will include the Aerodynamic Modification Kit, test flown in 2014, to improve maneuverability and handling, particularly with heavy weapon loads. Eurofighter says it is comfortable with delivering integration of the U.S. B61 nuclear weapon onto the aircraft, a process that requires U.S. certification. Paltzo said he was confident the U.S. government would not use the certification requirements of the weapon as &quot;leverage&quot; to force Germany towards a U.S. platform. A next-generation electronic warfare suite has been planned by the four-country consortium.

In November 2019, Airbus proposed a SEAD capability for the aircraft, a role which is currently performed by the Tornado ECR in German service. The Typhoon ECR would be configured with two Escort Jammer pods under the wings and two Emitter Location Systems at the wing tips. Armament configuration would include four MBDA Meteor, two IRIS-T and six SPEAR-EW in addition to three drop tanks.

On 5 November 2020, the German government approved an order for 38 Tranche 4 with ground attack capabilities for the replacement of Tranche 1 units in German service.

The Luftwaffe ordered 15 ECR electronic warfare aircraft for the &quot;Luftgestützte Wirkung im Elektromagnetischen Spektrum&quot; (luWES) requirement in March 2022. The 15 ECR EW aircraft will be transformed from existing German Typhoons and will be equipped with AGM-88E AARGM Anti-radiation missiles. The aircraft are expected to be NATO-certified by 2030.

The Tranche 4PE is a further development package aiming at integrating improved missiles (Meteor, Taurus, AMRAAM, GBU, JDAM).

===Replacement===
Germany is to replace the Eurofighter with the New Generation Fighter (NGF), co-developed with France and Spain. The Global Combat Air Programme is a ‘6th Generation’ fighter envisioned as a replacement for the RAF and Italian Air Force (AM), part of the UK&#x27;s wider Future Combat Air System.

==Design==
===Airframe overview===
The Typhoon is a highly agile aircraft both at supersonic and at low speeds, achieved through having an intentionally relaxed stability design. It has a quadruplex digital fly-by-wire control system providing artificial stability, as manual operation alone could not compensate for the inherent instability. The fly-by-wire system is described as &quot;carefree&quot;, and prevents the pilot from exceeding the permitted manoeuvre envelope. Roll control is primarily achieved by use of the ailerons. Pitch control is by operation of the canards and ailerons, because the canards disturb airflow to inner elevons (flaps). The yaw control is done by a large, single rudder. Engines are fed by a chin double intake ramp situated below a splitter plate.

The Typhoon features lightweight construction (82% composites consisting of 70% carbon fibre composite materials and 12% glass fibre reinforced composites) with an estimated lifespan of 6,000 flying hours.

====Radar signature reduction features====
Although it was not designated a stealth fighter, measures were taken to reduce the Typhoon&#x27;s radar cross section (RCS), especially from the frontal aspect; An example of these measures is that the Typhoon has jet inlets that conceal the front of the engines (a strong radar target) from radar. Many important potential radar targets, such as the wing, canard and fin leading edges, are highly swept so they will reflect radar energy well away from the front. Some external weapons are mounted semi-recessed into the aircraft, partially shielding these missiles from incoming radar waves. In addition radar-absorbent materials (RAM), developed primarily by EADS/DASA, coat many of the most significant reflectors, such as the wing leading edges, the intake edges and interior, the rudder surrounds, and strakes.

The manufacturers carried out tests on the early Eurofighter prototypes to optimise the low observability characteristics of the aircraft from the early 1990s. Testing at Warton on the DA4 prototype measured the RCS of the aircraft and investigated the effects of a variety of RAM coatings and composites. Another measure to reduce the likelihood of discovery is the use of passive sensors (PIRATE IRST), which minimises the radiation of treacherous electronic emissions. While canards generally have poor stealth characteristics from side because of corner to hull, the flight control system is designed to maintain the elevon trim and canards at an angle at which they have the smallest RCS.

===Cockpit===
The Typhoon features a glass cockpit without any conventional instruments. It incorporates three full colour multi-function head-down displays (MHDDs). The display formats on these MHDDs are manipulated by means of dedicated controls, softkeys, XY cursor, and voice (Direct Voice Input or DVI) command. There is a wide-angle head-up display (HUD) with forward-looking infrared (FLIR), a voice and hands-on throttle and stick (Voice+HOTAS), a Helmet Mounted Symbology System (HMSS), a manual data-entry facility (MDEF) located on the left glareshield and a fully integrated aircraft warning system with a dedicated warnings panel (DWP). There is also an interactive display panel for the MIDS. Reversionary flying instruments, lit by LEDs, are located under a hinged right glareshield. Access to the cockpit is normally via either a telescopic integral ladder or an external version. The integral ladder is stowed in the port side of the fuselage, below the cockpit.
User needs were given a high priority in the cockpit&#x27;s design; both layout and functionality was developed with feedback and assessments from military pilots and a specialist testing facility. The aircraft is controlled by means of a centre stick (or control stick) and left hand throttles, designed on a Hand on Throttle and Stick (HOTAS) principle to lower pilot workload. Emergency escape is provided by a Martin-Baker Mk.16A ejection seat, with the canopy being jettisoned by two rocket motors. The HMSS was delayed by years but should have been operational by late 2011. Standard &quot;g&quot;-force protection is provided by the &quot;full-cover anti-&quot;g&quot; trousers&quot; (FCAGTs), a specially developed &quot;g&quot; suit providing sustained protection up to nine &quot;g&quot;. German and Austrian Air Force pilots wear a hydrostatic &quot;g&quot;-suit called &quot;Libelle&quot; (&quot;dragonfly&quot;) Multi G Plus instead, which also provides protection to the arms, theoretically giving more complete &quot;g&quot; tolerance.
In the event of pilot disorientation, the Flight Control System allows for rapid and automatic recovery by the simple press of a button. On selection of this cockpit control the FCS takes full control of the engines and flying controls, and automatically stabilises the aircraft in a wings level, gentle climbing attitude at 300 knots, until the pilot is ready to retake control. The aircraft also has an Automatic Low-Speed Recovery system (ALSR) which prevents it from departing from controlled flight at very low speeds and high angle of attack. The FCS system is able to detect a developing low-speed situation and to raise an audible and visual low-speed cockpit warning. This gives the pilot sufficient time to react and to recover the aircraft manually. If the pilot does not react, however, or if the warning is ignored, the ALSR takes control of the aircraft, selects maximum dry power for the engines and returns the aircraft to a safe flight condition. Depending on the attitude, the FCS employs an ALSR &quot;push&quot;, &quot;pull&quot; or &quot;knife-over&quot; manoeuvre.
The Typhoon Direct Voice Input (DVI) system uses a speech recognition module (SRM), developed by Smiths Aerospace and Computing Devices. It was the first production DVI system used in a military cockpit. DVI provides the pilot with an additional natural mode of command and control over approximately 26 non-critical cockpit functions, to reduce pilot workload, improve aircraft safety, and expand mission capabilities. An important step in the development of the DVI occurred in 1987 when Texas Instruments completed the TMS-320-C30, a digital signal-processor, enabling reductions in the size and system complexity required. The project was given the go-ahead in July 1997, with development carried out on the Eurofighter Active Cockpit Simulator at Warton. The DVI system is speaker-dependent, requiring each pilot to create a template. It is not used for safety-critical or weapon-critical tasks, such as weapon release or lowering of the undercarriage. Voice commands are confirmed by visual or aural feedback, and serves to reduce pilot workload. All functions are also achievable by means of a conventional button-press or soft-key selections; functions include display management, communications, and management of various systems. EADS Defence and Security in Spain has worked on a new non-template DVI module to allow for continuous speech recognition, speaker voice recognition with common databases (e.g. British English, American English, etc.) and other improvements.

BAE Systems has been awarded a contract to develop new touch screen displays in the cockpit and enhance data processing capability for Eurofighter Typhoon.

===Avionics===
Navigation is via both GPS and an inertial navigation system. The Typhoon can use Instrument Landing System (ILS) for landing in poor weather. The aircraft also features an enhanced ground proximity warning system (GPWS) based on the TERPROM Terrain Referenced Navigation (TRN) system used by the Panavia Tornado. MIDS provides a Link 16 data link.

The aircraft employs a sophisticated and highly integrated Defensive Aids Sub-System named Praetorian (formerly Euro-DASS) Praetorian monitors and responds automatically to air and surface threats, provides an all-round prioritised assessment, and can respond to multiple threats simultaneously. Threat detection methods include a Radar warning receiver (RWR), a missile warning system (MWS) and a laser warning receiver (LWR, only on UK Typhoons). Protective countermeasures consist of chaff, flares, an electronic countermeasures (ECM) suite and a towed radar decoy (TRD). The ESM-ECM and MWS consists of 16 antenna array assemblies and 10 radomes.

Traditionally each sensor in an aircraft is treated as a discrete source of information; however this can result in conflicting data and limits the scope for the automation of systems, hence increasing pilot workload. To overcome this, the Typhoon employs sensor fusion techniques. In the Typhoon, fusion of all data sources is achieved through the Attack and Identification System, or AIS. This combines data from the major on-board sensors along with any information obtained from off-board platforms such as AWACS and MIDS. Additionally the AIS integrates all the other major offensive and defensive systems (e.g. DASS &amp; communications). The AIS physically comprises two essentially separate units: the Attack Computer (AC) and the Navigation Computer (NC).

By having a single source of information, pilot workload should be reduced by removing the possibility of conflicting data and the need for cross-checking, improving situational awareness and increasing systems automation. In practice the AIS should allow the Eurofighter to identify targets at distances in excess of and acquire and auto-prioritise them at over . In addition the AIS offers the ability to automatically control emissions from the aircraft, so called EMCON (from EMissions CONtrol). This should aid in limiting the detectability of the Typhoon by opposing aircraft further reducing pilot workload.

In 2017 a RAF Eurofighter Typhoon demonstrated interoperability with the F-35B using its Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) in a two-week trial known as Babel Fish III, in the Mojave Desert. This was achieved by translating the MADL messages into Link 16 format, thus allowing an F-35 in stealth mode to communicate directly with the Typhoon.

===Radar and sensors===
====Captor radar====

The Euroradar Captor is a mechanical multi-mode pulse Doppler radar designed for the Eurofighter Typhoon. The Eurofighter operates automatic Emission Controls (EMCON) to reduce the electro-magnetic emissions of the current CAPTOR mechanically scanned radar. The Captor-M has three working channels, one intended for classification of jammer and for jamming suppression. A succession of radar software upgrades have enhanced the air-to-air capability of the radar. These upgrades have included the R2P programme (initially UK only, and known as T2P when &#x27;ported&#x27; to the Tranche2 aircraft) which is being followed by R2Q/T2Q. R2P was applied to eight German Typhoons deployed on Red Flag Alaska in 2012.

;Captor-E AESA variant
The Captor-E is an AESA derivative of the original Captor radar, also known as CAESAR (from Captor Active Electronically Scanned Array Radar) being developed by the Euroradar Consortium, led by Selex ES.

Synthetic Aperture Radar is expected to be fielded as part of the AESA radar upgrade which will give the Eurofighter an all-weather ground attack capability. The conversion to AESA will also give the Eurofighter a low probability of intercept radar with improved jam resistance. These include an innovative design with a gimbal to meet RAF requirements for a wider scan field than a fixed AESA. The coverage of a fixed AESA is limited to 120° in azimuth and elevation. A senior EADS radar expert has claimed that Captor-E is capable of detecting an F-35 from roughly away.

The first flight of a Eurofighter equipped with a &quot;mass model&quot; of the Captor-E occurred in late February 2014, with flight tests of the actual radar beginning in July of that year. On 19 November 2014 the contract to upgrade to the Captor-E was signed at the offices of EuroRadar lead Selex ES in Edinburgh, in a deal worth €1bn. Kuwait became the launch customer for the Captor-E active electronically scanned array radar in April 2016. Germany has announced the intention to integrate the AESA Captor-E into their Typhoons, beginning in 2022.

In January 2024, it was announced that the first European Common Radar System (ECRS) MK2 had been fitted to an RAF operated test and evaluation Typhoon ZK355 (BS116), at BAE Systems&#x27; site Warton. Leonardo and DE&amp;S announced that the initial flight was scheduled to take place later in 2024.

The AESA radar program for the Eurofighter is now split into three European Common Radar System (ECRS) variants:
*ECRS Mk0: also called Radar One Plus, this is the baseline Captor-E model which was developed by Leonardo. Hardware development is complete and it is fitted to aircraft delivered to Kuwait and Qatar.
*ECRS Mk1: an upgrade of the Mk0 being developed by Hensoldt/Indra, for Germany and Spain. It will be retrofitted to their Tranche 2 and 3 aircraft, and also fitted to both countries&#x27; new Tranche 4 models.
*ECRS Mk2: also known as Radar Two, a different version developed from the ARTS and Bright Adder demonstrators, and from the Gripen E&#x27;s ES-05 Raven radar. With electronic warfare/attack capabilities, it is being developed by Leonardo for the RAF, and integrated by BAE Systems. It will initially be applied to Tranche 3 aircraft, but the RAF may upgrade Tranche 2 later. Italy has joined development of the ECRS Mk2, which was part of the Typhoon offer to Finland for its HX Fighter Program.

====IRST====
The Passive Infra-Red Airborne Track Equipment (PIRATE) system is an infrared search and track (IRST) system mounted on the port side of the fuselage, forward of the windscreen. Selex ES is the lead contractor which, along with Thales Optronics (system technical authority) and Tecnobit of Spain, make up the EUROFIRST consortium responsible for the system&#x27;s design and development. Eurofighters starting with Tranche1 block5 have the PIRATE. The first Eurofighter Typhoon with PIRATE-IRST was delivered to the Italian Aeronautica Militare in August 2007. More advanced targeting capabilities can be provided with the addition of a targeting pod such as the Litening pod.
When used with the radar in an air-to-air role, it functions as an infrared search and track system, providing passive target detection and tracking. The system can detect variations in temperature at a long range. It also provides a navigation and landing aid. PIRATE is linked to the pilot&#x27;s helmet-mounted display. It allows the detection of both hot exhaust plumes of jet engines and surface heating caused by friction; processing techniques further enhance the output, giving a near-high resolution image of targets. The output can be directed to any of the Multi-function Head Down Displays, and can also be overlaid on both the Helmet Mounted Sight and the Head Up Display.

Up to 200 targets can be simultaneously tracked using one of several different modes; Multiple Target Track (MTT), Single Target Track (STT), Single Target Track Ident (STTI), Sector Acquisition and Slaved Acquisition. In MTT mode the system will scan a designated volume space looking for potential targets. In STT mode PIRATE will provide tracking of a single designated target. An addition to this mode, STT Ident allows for visual identification of the target, the resolution being superior to CAPTOR&#x27;s. When in Sector Acquisition mode PIRATE will scan a volume of space under direction of another onboard sensor such as CAPTOR. In Slave Acquisition, off-board sensors are used with PIRATE being commanded by data obtained from an AWACS or other source. When a target is found in either of these modes, PIRATE will automatically designate it and switch to STT.

Once a target has been tracked and identified, PIRATE can be used to cue an appropriately equipped short range missile, i.e. a missile with a high off-boresight tracking capability such as ASRAAM. Additionally the data can be used to augment that of Captor or off-board sensor information via the AIS. This should enable the Typhoon to overcome severe ECM environments and still engage its targets. PIRATE also has a passive ranging capability although the system remains limited when providing passive firing solutions, as it does not have a laser rangefinder.

===Engines===
The Eurofighter Typhoon is fitted with two Eurojet EJ200 engines, each capable of providing up to 60 kN (13,500 lbf) of dry thrust and &gt;90 kN (20,230 lbf) with afterburners. Using the &quot;war&quot; setting, dry thrust increases by 15% to 69 kN per engine and afterburners by 5% to 95 kN per engine and for a few seconds, up to 102 kN thrust without damaging the engine. The EJ200 engine combines the leading technologies from each of the four European companies, using advanced digital control and health monitoring; wide chord aerofoils and single crystal turbine blades; and a convergent / divergent exhaust nozzle to give high thrust-to-weight ratio, multimission capability, supercruise performance, low fuel consumption, low cost of ownership, modular construction and growth potential.
The Typhoon is capable of supersonic cruise without using afterburners (referred to as supercruise). &quot;Air Forces Monthly&quot; gives a maximum supercruise speed of Mach 1.1 for the RAF FGR4 multirole version, however in a Singaporean evaluation, a Typhoon managed to supercruise at Mach 1.21 on a hot day with a combat load. Eurofighter states that the Typhoon can supercruise at Mach 1.5. As with the F-22, the Eurofighter can launch weapons while under supercruise to extend their ranges via this &quot;running start&quot;. In 2007, the EJ200 engine had accumulated 50,000 Engine Flying Hours in service with the four Nation Air Forces (Germany, UK, Spain and Italy).
The EJ200 engine has the potential to be fitted with a thrust vectoring control (TVC) nozzle, which the Eurofighter and Eurojet consortium have been actively developing and testing, primarily for export but also for future upgrades of the fleet. TVC could reduce fuel burn on a typical Typhoon mission by up to 5%, as well as increase available thrust in supercruise by up to 7% and take-off thrust by 2%. Clemens Linden, Eurojet TURBO GmbH CEO, speaking at the 2018 Farnborough International Air Show, said &quot;15 per cent more thrust would allow pilots to operate with a heavily loaded aircraft in the battlespace with the same performance levels as they have today. The technology insertion also provides more persistence – giving aircraft longer range or longer loitering time. To achieve more thrust we would increase the airflow and pressure ratios of the high and low pressure compressors and run higher temperatures in the turbines by using the latest generation single crystal turbine blade materials. And with higher aerodynamic efficiencies we can achieve a lower fuel burn. A third area of improvement would be the engine exhaust nozzle which would be upgraded with the installation of a 2-parametric version allowing independent and optimized adjustment of the throat and exit area at all flight conditions, providing fuel burn advantages. The technologies for the different components are at a Technology readiness level of between 7 and 9. The nozzle has been at ITP in Spain on a test bed for 400 hours.&quot;

===Performance===
The Typhoon&#x27;s combat performance, compared to the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II fighters and the French Dassault Rafale, has been the subject of much discussion. In March 2005, United States Air Force Chief of Staff General John P. Jumper, then the only person to have flown both the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Raptor, said:


In the 2005 Singapore evaluation, the Typhoon won all three combat tests, including one in which a single Typhoon defeated three RSAF F-16s, and reliably completed all planned flight tests. In July 2009, Former Chief of Air Staff for the RAF, Air Chief Marshal Sir Glenn Torpy, said that &quot;The Eurofighter Typhoon is an excellent aircraft. It will be the backbone of the Royal Air Force along with the JSF.&quot;

In July 2007, Indian Air Force Su-30MKI fighters participated in the &quot;Indra-Dhanush&quot; exercise with the RAF&#x27;s Typhoon. This was the first time the two fighters had taken part in such an exercise. The IAF did not allow their pilots to use the MKI&#x27;s radar during the exercise to protect the highly classified Russian N011M Bars. The IAF pilots were impressed by the Typhoon&#x27;s agility. In 2015, Indian Air Force Su-30MKIs again participated in a &quot;Indra-Dhanush&quot; exercise with RAF Typhoons.

===Armament===
==== Air to ground ====
The Typhoon is a multi-role fighter with maturing air-to-ground capabilities. The initial absence of air-to-ground capability is believed to have been a factor in the type&#x27;s rejection from Singapore&#x27;s fighter competition in 2005. At the time it was claimed that Singapore was concerned about the delivery timescale and the ability of the Eurofighter partner nations to fund the required capability packages. Tranche1 aircraft could drop laser-guided bombs in conjunction with third-party designators but the anticipated deployment of Typhoon to Afghanistan meant that the UK required self-contained bombing capabilities before the other partners. In 2006 the UK embarked on the £73m Change Proposal 193 (CP193) to give an &quot;austere&quot; air-to-surface capability using GBU-16 Paveway II and Rafael/Ultra Electronics Litening III laser designator for Tranche1 Block5 aircraft. Aircraft with this upgrade were designated Typhoon FGR4 by the RAF.
Similar capability was added to Tranche 2 aircraft on the main development pathway as part of the Phase1 Enhancements. P1Ea (SRP10) entered service in 2013 Q1 and added the use of Paveway IV, EGBU16 and the cannon against surface targets. P1Eb (SRP12) added full integration with GPS bombs such as GBU-10 Paveway II, GBU-16 Paveway II, Paveway IV and a new real-time operating system that allows multiple targets to be attacked in a single run. This new system will form the basis for future weapons integration by individual countries under the Phase2 Enhancements. The Storm Shadow and KEPD 350 (Taurus) cruise missiles, together with the Meteor Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air missile flight trials had been successfully completed by January 2016. The Storm Shadow and Meteor firings are part of the Phase2 Enhancement (P2E) programme which introduced a range of new and improved long range attack capabilities to Typhoon. In addition to Meteor and Storm Shadow, the first live firing of MBDA&#x27;s Brimstone air-to-surface missile, part of the Phase3 Enhancements (P3E) programme, was successfully completed in July 2017.
German aircraft can carry four GBU-48 1000 lb bombs.

An anti-ship capability has been studied but has not yet been contracted. Weapon options for this role could include Boeing Harpoon, MBDA Marte, &quot;Sea Brimstone&quot;, and RBS-15.

==== Air to air ====

The Typhoon also carries a specially developed variant of the Mauser BK-27 27 mm cannon that was developed originally for the Panavia Tornado. This is a single-barrel, electrically fired, gas-operated revolver cannon with a new linkless feed system which is located in the starboard wing root, and is capable of firing up to 1700 rounds per minute. There was a proposal on cost grounds in 1999 to limit UK gun-armament fit to the first 53 batch-1 aircraft and not used operationally, but this decision was reversed in 2006. The aircraft carries 150 rounds.
In his 2022 book &quot;Typhoon&quot;, former RAF pilot Mike Sutton reported that his 27 mm cannon had jammed during a strafing run in Syria, against ISIS targets, while supporting Allied ground units. According to his book, the Typhoon was originally intended to be built without an internal gun, like the F-4 Phantom and the Harrier jump jet. A decision to install an internal gun had led to &quot;manufacturing issues&quot;. Sutton claimed that, during his staffing run, the gun jammed after 26 rounds, with the HUD showing a &quot;GUN FAIL&quot; warning legend. During the debrief it transpired that the problem was well known to both the pilots and ground crews.

In addition to its air to ground armament; the Typhoon can carry a mixture of air to air weaponry to fulfill its role as an air superiority fighter. This includes the ASRAAM, IRIS-T, and the AIM-9 Sidewinder heat seeking missiles; and the AIM-120 AMRAAM and the MBDA Meteor beyond visual range radar guided missiles. Under Tranche 2, Block 15 EOC (Enhanced Operational Capability) 2; the Meteor was integrated into the Typhoon&#x27;s arsenal. This similar capability was achieved in the RAF under &quot;Project Centurion&quot;; with 107 Tranche 2 and 3 Typhoons modified to be capable to use the Meteor along with Brimstone and Storm Shadow air to ground missiles.

==Operational history==
===Austrian Air Force (&quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot;)===
In 2002, Austria selected the Typhoon as its new air defence aircraft, it having beaten the F-16 and the Saab Gripen in competition. The purchase of 18 Typhoons was agreed on 1 July 2003, however this was reduced to 15 in June 2007. The first aircraft (&quot;7L-WA&quot;) was delivered on 12 July 2007 to Zeltweg Air Base and formally entered service with the Austrian Air Force. A 2008 report by the Austrian Court of Audit calculated, that instead of getting 18 Tranche2 jets at a price of €109million each, as stipulated by the original contract, the revised deal, agreed to by Minister Norbert Darabos, meant that Austria was paying an increased unit price of €114million for 15 partially used, Tranche1 jets. In July 2008, the Luftstreitkräfte assigned the Eurofighter to Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) duties, by the end of the year they had been scrambled 73 times.

Austrian prosecutors are investigating allegations that up to €100million was made available to lobbyists to influence the original purchase decision in favour of the Eurofighter. By October 2013, all Typhoons in service with Austria had been upgraded to the latest &quot;Tranche1&quot; standard. In 2014, due to defence budget restrictions, there were only 12 pilots available to fly the 15 aircraft in Austria&#x27;s Air Force. In February 2017, Austrian defence minister Hans Peter Doskozil accused Airbus of fraudulent intent following a probe that allegedly unveiled corruption linked to the order of Typhoon jets.

In July 2017, the Austria Defence Ministry announced that it would be replacing all its Typhoon aircraft by 2020. The ministry said continued use of its Typhoons over their 30-year life span would cost about €5billion with the bulk being for maintenance. By comparison it is estimated that buying and operating a new fleet of 15 single-seat and three twin-seat fighters would save €2billion over that period. Austria plans to explore a government-to-government sale or lease agreement to avoid a lengthy and costly tender process with a manufacturer. Possible replacements include the Gripen and the F-16.

On 20 July 2020, a letter written by Indonesia&#x27;s defence minister, Prabowo Subianto, was published by Indonesian news outlets expressing interest in acquiring Austria&#x27;s entire fleet of Typhoon jets.

===German Air Force (&quot;Luftwaffe&quot;)===
On 4 August 2003, the German Air Force accepted its first series production Eurofighter (&quot;30+03&quot;) starting the replacement process of the Mikoyan MiG-29s inherited from the East German Air Force. The first Luftwaffe Wing to accept the Eurofighter was &quot;Jagdgeschwader 73&quot; &quot;Steinhoff&quot; on 30 April 2004 at Rostock–Laage Airport. The second Wing was &quot;Jagdgeschwader 74&quot; (JG74) on 25 July 2006, with four Eurofighters arriving at Neuburg Air Base, beginning the replacement of JG74&#x27;s McDonnell Douglas F-4F Phantom IIs.

The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; assigned their Eurofighters to QRA on 3 June 2008, taking over from the F-4F Phantom II.

On 28 October 2014, while deployed to Ämari Air Base in Estonia as part of the NATO Baltic Air Policing mission, German Eurofighters scrambled and intercepted seven Russian Air Force aircraft over the Baltic Sea.

The Luftwaffe once again provided Baltic Air Policing at Ämari Air Base between 31 August 2020 and April 2021, having taken over from Dassault Mirage 2000-5Fs of the French Air and Space Force.

On 5 June 2024, the German chancellor announced plans to purchase another twenty Eurofighters.

German Eurofighters took part in Exercise Tarang Shakti held by the Indian Air Force from 6 August 2024.

===Italian Air Force (&quot;Aeronautica Militare&quot;)===

On 16 December 2005, the F-2000 Typhoon reached initial operational capability (IOC) with the Italian Air Force (&quot;Aeronautica Militare&quot;). Its F-2000 Typhoons were put into service as air defence fighters at the Grosseto Air Base, and immediately assigned to QRA at the same base.

On 17 July 2009, Italian Air Force F-2000A Typhoons were deployed to protect Albania&#x27;s airspace. On 29 March 2011, Italian Air Force Eurofighter Typhoons began flying combat air patrol missions in support of NATO&#x27;s Operation Unified Protector in Libya.

Between January and August 2015, four &quot;Aeronautica Militare&quot; F-2000A Typhoons (from 36º and 37º &quot;Stormo&quot;) were deployed to Šiauliai Air Base in northern Lithuania as part of the Baltic Air Policing mission.
===Kuwait Air Force===
On 11 September 2015, Eurofighter confirmed that an agreement had been reached to supply Kuwait with 28 aircraft. On 1 March 2016, the Kuwaiti National Assembly approved the procurement of 22 single-seat and six twin-seat Typhoons. On 5 April 2016, Kuwait signed a contract with Leonardo valued at €7.957billion ($9.062billion) for the supply of the 28 aircraft, all to tranche 3 standard. The Kuwaiti aircraft will be the first Typhoons to receive the Captor-E AESA radar, with two instrumented production aircraft from the UK and Germany currently undergoing ground-based integration trials. The Typhoons will be fitted with Leonardo&#x27;s Praetorian defensive aids suite and PIRATE infrared search and track system. The contract involves the production of aircraft in Italy and covers logistics, operational support and the training of flight crews and ground personnel. It also encompasses infrastructure work at the Ali Al Salem Air Base, where the Typhoons will be based. Aircraft deliveries will begin in 2020.

===Qatar Emiri Air Force===
From January 2011 the Qatar Emiri Air Force (QEAF) evaluated the Typhoon, alongside the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, the McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle, the Dassault Rafale, and the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, to replace its then inventory of Dassault Mirage 2000-5s. On 30 April 2015 Qatar announced that it would order 24 Rafales.

In December 2017 a deal for Qatar to buy 24 jets and a support and training package from BAE was announced, scheduled to begin in 2022. In September 2018, Qatar made the first payment for the procurement of 24 Eurofighter Typhoons and nine BAE Systems Hawk aircraft to BAE.

===Royal Air Force (UK)===
The UK&#x27;s first Typhoon Development Aircraft (DA-2) &quot;ZH588&quot; made its maiden flight on 6 April 1994 from Warton. On 1 September 2002, No. XVII (Reserve) Squadron was reformed at Warton as the Typhoon Operational Evaluation Unit (TOEU), receiving its first aircraft on 18 December 2003. The first RAF production aircraft to take to the air was &quot;ZJ800&quot; (BT001) on 14 February 2003, completing a 21-minute flight. The next Typhoon squadron to be formed was No. 29 (R) Squadron which formed as the Typhoon Operational Conversion Unit (OCU). The first operational RAF Typhoon squadron to be formed was No.3 (Fighter) Squadron on 31 March 2006, when it moved to RAF Coningsby.

No. 3 (F) Squadron Typhoon F2s took over QRA responsibilities from the Panavia Tornado F3 on 29 June 2007, initially alternating with the Tornado F3 every month. On 9 August 2007, the UK&#x27;s MoD reported that No. XI (F) Squadron of the RAF, which stood up as a Typhoon squadron on 29 March 2007, had taken delivery of its first two multi-role Typhoons. Two of No. XI (F) Squadron&#x27;s Typhoons were sent to intercept a Russian Tupolev Tu-95 approaching British airspace on 17 August 2007. The RAF Typhoons were declared combat ready in the air-to-ground role by 1 July 2008. The RAF Typhoons were projected to be ready to deploy for operations by mid-2008.

In late 2009, four RAF Typhoons were deployed to RAF Mount Pleasant, replacing the Tornado F3s of No. 1435 Flight defending the Falkland Islands. No.6 Squadron stood up at RAF Leuchars on 6 September 2010, making Leuchars the second RAF base to operate the Typhoon.
On 20 March 2011 ten Typhoons from RAF Coningsby and RAF Leuchars arrived at the Gioia del Colle airbase in southern Italy to enforce a no-fly zone in Libya alongside Panavia Tornado GR4s. On 21 March, RAF Typhoons flew their first-ever combat mission while patrolling the no-fly zone. On 29 March, it was revealed that the RAF was having to divert personnel from Typhoon training to meet the shortfall in pilots available to fly the required number of sorties over Libya. On 12 April 2011, a RAF Typhoon and a Tornado GR4 dropped precision-guided bombs on ground vehicles operated by Gaddafi forces. The RAF said that each aircraft dropped one GBU-16 Paveway II 454 kg (1,000 lb) laser-guided bomb which struck &quot;very successfully and very accurately [and this] represented] a significant milestone in the delivery of multi-role Typhoon.&quot; Target designation was provided by the Tornados with their Litening III targeting pods due to the lack of Typhoon pilots trained in air-to-ground missions.

The National Audit Office observed in 2011 that the distribution of the Eurofighter&#x27;s parts supply and repairs over several countries has led to parts shortages, long timescales for repairs, and the cannibalisation of some aircraft to keep others flying. The UK&#x27;s then Defence Secretary Liam Fox admitted on 14 April 2011 that Britain&#x27;s Eurofighter Typhoon jets were grounded in 2010 due to shortage of spare parts. The RAF &quot;cannibalised&quot; aircraft for spare parts in a bid to keep the maximum number of Typhoons operational on any given day. The MoD warned that the problems were likely to continue until 2015.

On 15 September 2012, No.1 (F) Squadron stood up at RAF Leuchars, joining No.6 Squadron as the second Typhoon unit to operate in Scotland. On 22 April 2013, No. 41 (R) Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES) began operating the Typhoon from RAF Coningbsy.

By July 2014, a dozen RAF Tranche 2 Typhoons had been upgraded with Phase1 Enhancement (P1E) capability to enable them to use the Paveway IV guided bomb; the Tranche1 version had used the GBU-12 Paveway II in combat over Libya, but the Paveway IV can be set to explode above or beneath a target and to hit at a set angle.

No. II (AC) Squadron became the fifth RAF Typhoon squadron on 12 January 2015 at RAF Lossiemouth. In July 2015, it was reported that Typhoons from No. II (AC) Squadron were training with Type 45 destroyers in an Air-Maritime Integration (AMI) role, conceding that the service had recently neglected the role following the decommissioning of the Nimrod Maritime Patrol aircraft. In the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR), the UK decided to retain some of the Tranche1 aircraft to increase the number of front-line squadrons from five to seven and to extend the out-of-service date from 2030 to 2040 as well as implementing the Captor-E AESA radar in later tranches. In 2015, Typhoons were deployed to Malta as security for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.

On 3 December 2015, six Typhoon FGR4s deployed to RAF Akrotiri to support operations against ISIL. The following evening the Typhoons, accompanied by Tornados, attacked targets in Syria.

In October 2016, four Typhoon FGR4s from No. II (AC) Squadron, supported by an Airbus Voyager KC3 aerial tanker and a Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, deployed to Misawa Air Base in Japan for the first bilateral exercises with non-US forces hosted by the JASDF.
On 14 December 2017, it was announced No. 12 (B) Squadron would stand as a joint RAF/Qatari Air Force squadron, with the Qatari crew temporarily operating Typhoons to prepare them for their own Typhoon deliveries in 2022. On 29 January 2018, the RAF announced that 16 twin-seat Typhoons would undergo the Return to Produce (RTP) process in an effort to save £800million, with each airframe producing £50M of spare parts. This move also reflected the switch from two-seat trainer to single-seat pilot training and greater use of training simulators. In addition, the two-seat airframes were primarily from Tranche1 and could not be equipped with Tranche3 and later upgrades such as Captor-E.

On 1 April 2019, No. IX (B) Squadron officially converted from the Tornado GR4 to the Typhoon FGR4, becoming an aggressor and air defence squadron at Lossiemouth. In April, four Typhoons of No. XI (F) Squadron deployed from RAF Coningsby to Ämari Airbase, Estonia, to undergo a four month long NATO Baltic policing mission (Op AZOTIZE). Five Typhoons of No.6 Squadron participated in the Arctic Challenge Exercise (ACE) in Sweden from 22 May to 4 June. No. 12 Squadron were assigned their first Typhoon FGR4 in July 2019. The 160th, and last, Typhoon (&quot;ZK437&quot;) was delivered to the RAF on 27 September 2019.

Between November and December 2019, No. 1(F) Squadron deployed to Keflavik Airbase in Iceland as part of NATO&#x27;s Icelandic Air Policing Mission. During this one-month deployment the aircraft conducted more than 180 practice intercepts and 59 training sorties.

Between April and September 2020, No. 6 Squadron deployed to Šiauliai Air Base, Lithuania, as part of Operation Azotize. While deployed the squadron participated in Exercise BALTOPs 2020. In July 2020, No. 12 Squadron began operating as a joint RAF-QEAF unit at RAF Coningsby.

On 22 March 2021 the 2021 Defence Command Paper announced the retirement of all Tranche 1 Typhoons by 2025, with the remaining fleet being upgraded. Also in 2021 the UK launched the P3Ec package, due for delivery in 2024, including several upgrades, including replacing the multifunction displays with a Large Area Display (LAD). On 14 December 2021 the RAF executed its first operational air-to-air engagement with a Typhoon, shooting down a small hostile drone with an ASRAAM near the Al-Tanf coalition base in Syria.

On 7 September 2022 during the joint UK/US SinkEx &#x27;Atlantic Thunder&#x27; a 41 Squadron Typhoon successfully hit the ex-USS Boone with Paveway IVs, becoming the first RAF Typhoon to strike a naval target with live ordnance.

Between 18 and 22 September 2023, Typhoons from 41 Squadron took part in the Finnish led Exercise ‘Baana 23’. During this exercise, the aircraft performed landings and takeoffs from a highway in Tervo, marking a first for any Eurofighter operator.

On 12 January 2024, at 2:30 am local time, four RAF Typhoons dropped Paveway IV bombs on two military facilities, used by Houthis to launch drone and missile strikes on ships in the Red Sea, as a part of the 2024 Yemeni airstrike.

On 13 April 2024, RAF Typhoons shot down an unspecified number of unmanned aerial vehicles during the 2024 Iranian strikes in Israel. The Typhoons, based in Cyprus and Romania, were operating in Iraqi and Syrian airspace as part of Operation Shader.

===Royal Air Force of Oman===
During the 2008 Farnborough Airshow it was announced that Oman was in an &quot;advanced stage&quot; of discussions to order Typhoons as a replacement for its SEPECAT Jaguar aircraft. On 21 December 2012, the Royal Air Force of Oman (RAFO) became the Typhoon&#x27;s seventh customer when BAE and Oman announced an order for 12 Typhoons to enter service in 2017. The first of the Typhoons (plus Hawk Mk 166) ordered by Oman were &quot;formally presented to the customer&quot; on 15 May 2017. This included a flypast by a RAFO Typhoon.

===Royal Saudi Air Force===
In August 2006, Saudi Arabia confirmed it had agreed to purchase 72 Typhoons for the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF). In December 2006, it was reported in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that Saudi Arabia had threatened to buy Rafales because of a UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) investigation into the Al Yamamah defence deals which commenced in the 1980s.

On 14 December 2006, Britain&#x27;s attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, ordered that the SFO discontinue its investigation into BAE Systems&#x27; alleged bribery of senior Saudi officials in the Al-Yamamah contracts, citing &quot;the need to safeguard national and international security&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; raised the possibility that RAF production aircraft would be diverted as early Saudi Arabian aircraft, with the RAF forced to wait for its full complement of aircraft. This arrangement would mirror the diversion of RAF Tornados to the RSAF. &quot;The Times&quot; also reported that such an arrangement would make the UK purchase of its Tranche3 commitments more likely. On 17 September 2007, Saudi Arabia confirmed it had signed a £4.43 billion contract for 72 aircraft. 24 aircraft would be at the Tranche2 build standard, previously destined for the UK RAF, the first being delivered in 2008. The remaining 48 aircraft were to be assembled in Saudi Arabia and delivered from 2011, however following contract renegotiations in 2011, it was agreed that all 72 aircraft would be assembled by BAE Systems in the UK, with the last 24 aircraft being built to Tranche3 capability.

On 29 September 2008, the United States Department of State approved the Typhoon sale, required because of a certain technology governed by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) process which was incorporated into the MIDS of the Eurofighter.

On 22 October 2008, the first RSAF Typhoon made its maiden flight at Warton. Since 2010, BAE has been training Saudi Arabian personnel at Warton.

By 2011, 24 Tranche 2 Eurofighter Typhoons had been delivered to Saudi Arabia, consisting of 18 single-seat and six two-seat aircraft. After that, BAE and Riyadh entered into discussions over configurations and price of the rest of the 72-plane order. On 19 February 2014, BAE announced that the Saudis had agreed to a price increase. BAE announced that the last of the original 72 Typhoons had been delivered to Saudi Arabia in June 2017.

RSAF Typhoons are playing a central role in the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen. In February 2015, Saudi Typhoons attacked ISIS targets over Syria using Paveway IV bombs for the first time.

On 9 March 2018, a memorandum of intent for the additional 48 Typhoons was signed during Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman&#x27;s visit to the United Kingdom, however the deal has not been completed due to German arms sanctions implemented in November 2018 in response to the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi.

===Spanish Air and Space Force===
The first Spanish production Eurofighter Tifón to fly was &quot;CE.16-01&quot; (ST001) on 17 February 2003, flying from Getafe Air Base. The Spanish Air and Space Force assigned their Typhoons to QRA responsibilities in July 2008.

On 7 August 2018, a Spanish Air and Space Force Typhoon, on a training exercise near Otepää in Estonia, released an AMRAAM missile by mistake. There were no casualties, but the ten-day search operation for missile remains was unsuccessful and the status of the missile is unknown, whether it self-destructed in the air or landed unexploded and left a hazardous situation for the public. The pilot was disciplined for negligence, but received only the minimum penalty in the light of undisclosed mitigating circumstances.
==Sales and marketing==
===Germany===
Germany placed an order for an additional 38 Tranche 4 Typhoons on 11 November 2020 under the Quadriga Agreement. The aircraft are due to replace Tranche 1 aircraft currently in service, with the first airframe being announced as in production in November 2022. Deliveries are due to take place from 2025.

In March 2022, the German government announced the decision to purchase Typhoon EK over the EA-18G Growler to replace the ageing Tornado ECR from 2030. On 30 November 2023, the Bundestag budget committee formally announced the plans to convert 15 Typhoons to Electronic Warfare standard.

On 5 June 2024, it was announced that an additional 20 Typhoons would be ordered on top of the 38 already on order.

=== Italy ===
On 23 December 2024, an order worth €7.5 billion was placed for 24 aircraft.

===Spain===
The Spanish Air and Space Force has a requirement for a further 45 Typhoons split across two contracts.

Halcon I was signed in June 2022 for the purchase of 20 aircraft will begin deliveries from 2026. The contract is for 16 single-seat and four twin-seat airframes, all at Tranche 4 standard. These aircraft are expected to replace the EF-18 Hornets of Ala 46, based at Gando Air Base on the Canary Islands.

Halcon II followed on 12 September 2023 for the acquirement of a further 25 Typhoons. These aircraft will replace the rest of the EF-18 Hornet fleet which is due to be decommissioned in 2030. The Spanish Government announced that these aircraft would be of Tranche 5 configuration.

===Saudi Arabia===
In October 2016, it was reported that BAE Systems was in talks with Saudi Arabia over an order for another 48 aircraft. On 9 March 2018, a memorandum of intent for the additional 48 Typhoons was signed during Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman&#x27;s visit to the United Kingdom.

In January 2024, the German government announced that it would no longer block the sale of 48 Typhoons to Saudi Arabia. As of February 2024, there has been no official confirmation that the sale will go ahead as other aircraft have been considered to strengthen the Royal Saudi Air Force&#x27;s combat fleet.

===Egypt===
In January 2023, reports surfaced that Egypt would acquire 24 Typhoons as part of a wider $10–12 Billion arms package from Italy.

===Turkey===
Turkey has also expressed interest, amid US hesitance on delivering the latest block F-16s, and has started negotiations with the UK. Defense Minister Yaşar Güler has underscored Turkey&#x27;s continued interest in acquiring Typhoons, asserting that they remain a compelling alternative, despite recent disagreements with Germany over the potential purchase. &quot;If we can realize the issues we talked about with our friends, maybe we won&#x27;t need it, but we do now. The Eurofighter is a very good alternative, and we want to buy it,&quot; Güler said in a televised interview with private broadcaster NTV on 11 December 2023. Turkey expects the United States to approve a proposed sale of new F-16 jets and modernization kits in return for Ankara finally green-lighting Sweden&#x27;s admission into NATO. It was revealed in November that Turkey was in talks with the United Kingdom and Spain over procuring 40 Typhoons. Any sale would require Germany&#x27;s approval, which is not forthcoming. President Erdoğan has been in Germany since the negotiations were revealed, but has not raised the issue with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

===Others===
Other countries have expressed interest in the fighter, including Serbia, Bangladesh, Colombia, and Ukraine.

The following countries have formally eliminated the Typhoon from their respective fighter programs: Belgium, Denmark, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, and Finland.

==Variants==
The Eurofighter is produced in single-seat and twin-seat variants. The twin-seat variant is not used operationally, but only for training, though it is combat capable. The aircraft has been manufactured in three major standards; seven Development Aircraft (DA), seven production standard Instrumented Production Aircraft (IPA) for further system development, and a continuing number of Series Production Aircraft. The production aircraft are now operational with the partner nation&#x27;s air forces.

The Tranche 1 aircraft were produced from 2000 onwards. Aircraft capabilities are being increased incrementally, with each software upgrade resulting in a different standard, known as blocks. With the introduction of the block5 standard, the R2 retrofit programme began to bring all Tranche1 aircraft to that standard.

==Accidents==
*On 21 November 2002, the Spanish twin-seat Typhoon prototype DA-6 crashed due to a double engine flameout caused by surges of the two engines at 45,000 ft. The two crew members escaped unhurt and the aircraft crashed in a military test range near Toledo, some from its base at Getafe Air Base.
*On 23 April 2008, a RAF Typhoon FGR4 from 17 Squadron at RAF Coningsby (ZJ943), made a wheels–up landing at the US Navy&#x27;s NAWS China Lake, in the United States. The aircraft was severely damaged however the pilot from 17 Squadron did not sustain any significant injury. It is thought the pilot may have forgotten to deploy the undercarriage or that for some reason he was not alerted to the undercarriage having not been deployed.
*On 24 August 2010, a Spanish twin-seat Typhoon crashed at Spain&#x27;s Morón Air Base moments after take-off for a routine training flight. It was being piloted by a RSAF pilot, who was killed, and a Spanish Air Force Major, who ejected safely. In September 2010 the German Air Force grounded its 55 planes and the RAF temporarily grounded all Typhoon training flights amidst concerns that after ejecting successfully the pilot had fallen to his death. On 21 September, the RAF announced that the harness system had been sufficiently modified to enable routine flying from RAF Coningsby. The Austrian Air Force also said all its aircraft had been cleared for flight. On 24 August 2010, the ejection seat manufacturer Martin Baker commented: &quot;...under certain conditions, the quick release fitting could be unlocked using the palm of the hand, rather than the thumb and fingers, and that this posed a risk of inadvertent release&quot;, adding that a modification had been rapidly developed and approved &quot;to eliminate this risk&quot; and was being fitted to all Typhoon seats.
*On 9 June 2014, the Spanish Air Force announced that a Typhoon had crashed at Spain&#x27;s Morón Air Base on landing after a routine training flight. The sole pilot, Captain Fernando Lluna Carrascosa of the Spanish Air Force, who had over 600 Eurofighter flying hours, died in the crash.
*On 23 June 2014, a Typhoon of the German Air Force suffered a mid-air collision with a Learjet 35A, which crashed near Olsberg, Germany. The severely damaged Eurofighter made a safe landing at Nörvenich Air Base, while the Learjet crashed with the two onboard killed.
*On 1 September 2017, a RAF Typhoon overran the runway on landing at Pardubice Airport, Czech Republic, after diverting for bad weather.
*On 14 September 2017, a RSAF aircraft crashed on a combat mission in Yemen&#x27;s Abhyan province, killing its pilot. According to the Saudi Government, the aircraft crashed due to technical reasons.
*On 24 September 2017, an Italian Air Force aircraft crashed during an airshow in Terracina, Lazio, Italy. The pilot did not eject and died in the accident.

<text>P.S. Your Cat Is Dead is a novel by James Kirkwood Jr., originally published in 1972, adapted from his play. The book and play later were adapted to film in 2002.

==Synopsis==
Abandoned by his girlfriend on New Year&#x27;s Eve, and still unaware that his beloved cat Bobby Seale has died in an animal clinic, hopeless New York actor Jimmy Zoole is feeling depressed and unstable when he happens across a cat burglar named Vito in his apartment. Furious, he beats the stranger unconscious and ties him to his kitchen sink. Jimmy begins to torment his terrified captive; however, the unlikely pair soon establish a bond. Vito once had a wife who left him after she discovered he was gay and who took their child with her. Jimmy questions his own sexual orientation as his relationship with Vito takes on an erotic dimension, and decides to use his prisoner to exact revenge on his former lover. In the end, Jimmy and Vito, now working as a team, sell a stash of stolen drugs and run away together.

==Genesis==
In his James Kirkwood biography &quot;Ponies &amp; Rainbows&quot;, Sean Egan traces the genesis of the play, which had its roots in a series of burglaries at Kirkwood&#x27;s apartment on West 58th Street in New York. The book also features a photograph of Gino Marino, a friend and lover of Kirkwood&#x27;s upon whom Egan claims the author based the character Vito.

==1975 Broadway production==
After five previews, the Broadway production, directed by Vivian Matalon, opened on April 7, 1975, at the John Golden Theatre, where it ran for 16 performances. The cast included Keir Dullea, Tony Musante, and Jennifer Warren. Actor and LGBTQ activist Sal Mineo played Vito in the San Francisco run of the play from November 1975 to January 1976. He was preparing for the Los Angeles run in February 1976, but he was murdered at his West Hollywood apartment on February 12 by a drug addict, a week before it was slated to open. Afterwards, Drama Desk Award nominations were sent to Kirkwood for Outstanding New Play and Musante for Outstanding Actor in a Play.

After changes were made to the script in the early 1980s, the play re-opened Off Broadway at Circle in the Square Downtown with a cast that included Zeljko Ivanek as Vito.

During his acceptance speech for the Tony Award that he received for &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; on April 16, 1976, author James Kirkwood stated the following:
&quot;As &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; was previewing at the Newman Theater, I had a little ditty open on Broadway about a month before called &quot;P.S. Your Cat Is Dead&quot;. 
It was greeted by some of the critics as if I&#x27;d dramatized the Black Plague. It&#x27;s been rewritten. It&#x27;s got a whole new life on the coast, so it&#x27;s alive and well.&quot;
==Mexican play==
In Mexico, this play first was produced in 1983 under the title &quot;P.D. Tu gato ha muerto&quot; and starred Manuel Ojeda as Jimmy and Humberto Zurita as Eddie. It was produced from 1997 to 2000 and starred Otto Sirgo in the role of Jimmy. The role of Eddie throughout the years went to Héctor Soberón, Juan Soler, Xavier Ortiz, Héctor Suarez Gomiz, Jorge Poza and Sebastián Rulli. The play was presented in several cities of the United States when Juan Soler was part of the cast.

==2002 film==
In 2002, Steve Guttenberg combined the play and novel into the feature film &quot;P.S. Your Cat Is Dead&quot;, which he co-wrote with Jeff Korn and directed, starring himself as the writer, Cynthia Watros as his ex-girlfriend Kate, and Lombardo Boyar as the youthful burglar Eddie. It was screened at the 2002 Philadelphia International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival.

==Brazilian play==
In 2004, the play was produced in São Paulo, with the title &quot;P.S.: Seu Gato Morreu&quot;, directed by Jarbas Homem de Mello, and had Teco Tavares - who also produced and translated the play to Portuguese - in the role of Jimmy Zoole and Paula Picarelli as Kate. The roles of Vito and Fred were played by Luís Araújo and Eduardo Estrela, respectively.

==German play==
The first performance of a German version of the play took place on 29 January 2011 in Berlin at Jüdisches Theater Bimah, directed by Thomas Maul. While the roles of Vito (played by Markus Riexinger) and Jimmy&#x27;s girlfriend Kate (Katrin Stephan) were taken from the original play as they are, Jimmy Zoole was turned into a woman: Jenny Zola (Jasmin Steck), turning the relationship with Kate into a lesbian one.

Argentine Play
The play was a success back in 1978 at the ATENEO Theater (Buenos Aires), produced by Carlos Rottemberg, directed by Emilio Alfaro and with Luis Brandoni and Gerardo Romano in its leading roles.

<text>Canned Heat is an American blues and rock band that was formed in Los Angeles in 1965. The group has been noted for its efforts to promote interest in blues music and its original artists. It was launched by two blues enthusiasts Alan Wilson and Bob Hite, who took the name from Tommy Johnson&#x27;s 1928 &quot;Canned Heat Blues&quot;, a song about an alcoholic who had desperately turned to drinking Sterno, generically called &quot;canned heat&quot;. After appearances at the Monterey and Woodstock festivals at the end of the 1960s, the band acquired worldwide fame with a lineup of Hite (vocals), Wilson (guitar, harmonica and vocals), Henry Vestine and later Harvey Mandel (lead guitar), Larry Taylor (bass), and Adolfo de la Parra (drums).

The music and attitude of Canned Heat attracted a large following and established the band as one of the popular acts of the hippie era. Canned Heat appeared at most major musical events at the end of the 1960s, performing blues standards along with their own material and occasionally indulging in lengthy &quot;psychedelic&quot; solos. Three of their songs—&quot;Going Up the Country&quot;, &quot;On the Road Again&quot;, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Work Together&quot;—became international hits.

Since the early 1970s, following the early death of Wilson, numerous personnel changes have occurred. For much of the 1990s and 2000s and following Taylor&#x27;s death in 2019, de la Parra has been the only member from the band&#x27;s 1960s lineup. Walter Trout and Junior Watson are among the guitarists who played in later editions of the band.

== History ==
=== Origins and early lineups ===
Canned Heat was started within the community of blues collectors. Bob Hite had been trading blues records since his early teens, and his house in Topanga Canyon was a meeting place for people interested in music. In 1965, some blues devotees there decided to form a jug band and started rehearsals. The initial configuration included Hite as vocalist, Alan Wilson on bottleneck guitar, Mike Perlowin on lead guitar, Stu Brotman on bass and Keith Sawyer on drums. Perlowin and Sawyer dropped out within a few days, so guitarist Kenny Edwards (a friend of Wilson&#x27;s) stepped in to replace Perlowin, and Ron Holmes agreed to sit in on drums until they could find a permanent drummer.

Another of Hite&#x27;s friends, Henry Vestine (who had been let go from Frank Zappa&#x27;s Mothers of Invention for smoking pot), asked if he could join the band and was accepted, while Edwards was kept on temporarily. Soon Edwards departed (he went on to form the Stone Poneys with Bobby Kimmel and Linda Ronstadt), and at the same time Frank Cook came in to replace Holmes as their permanent drummer. Cook already had substantial professional experience, having performed with such jazz luminaries as bassist Charlie Haden, trumpeter Chet Baker, and pianist Elmo Hope, and had also collaborated with black soul/pop artists such as Shirley Ellis and Dobie Gray.

In 1966, producer Johnny Otis brought them into a studio to record material for a first album, with the ensemble of Hite, Wilson, Cook, Vestine, and Brotman. However, the recordings went unissued until 1970 when they appeared as &quot;Vintage Heat&quot;, released by Janus Records. Otis oversaw the session which produced a dozen tracks, including two versions of &quot;Rollin&#x27; and Tumblin&#x27; (with and without harmonica), &quot;Spoonful&quot; by Willie Dixon, and &quot;Louise&quot; by John Lee Hooker in his studio in Los Angeles. Over a summer hiatus in 1966, Stuart Brotman effectively left Canned Heat after he had signed a contract for a long engagement in Fresno with an Armenian belly-dance revue. Canned Heat had contacted Brotman, touting a recording contract which had to be signed the next day, but Brotman was unable to make the signing on short notice. Brotman would go on to join the world-music band Kaleidoscope with David Lindley, replacing Chris Darrow. Replacing Brotman in Canned Heat was Mark Andes, who lasted only a couple of months before he returned to his former colleagues in the Red Roosters, who adopted the new name Spirits Rebellious, later shortened to Spirit.

After joining up with managers Skip Taylor and John Hartmann, Canned Heat finally found a permanent bassist in Larry Taylor, who joined in March 1967. He was a former member of the Moondogs and the brother of Ventures&#x27; drummer, Mel Taylor, and already had experience backing Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry in concert, and recording studio sessions for the Monkees.

This lineup (Hite, Wilson, Vestine, Taylor, Cook) started recording in April 1967 for Liberty Records with Calvin Carter, who had been the head of A&amp;R for Vee-Jay Records and had recorded such bluesmen as Jimmy Reed and John Lee Hooker. They recorded &quot;Rollin&#x27; and Tumblin&#x27;, backed with &quot;Bullfrog Blues&quot;, and this became Canned Heat&#x27;s first single. The first official album, &quot;Canned Heat&quot;, was released three months later in July 1967. All tracks were re-workings of older blues songs. The &quot;Los Angeles Free Press&quot; reported: &quot;This group has it! They should do very well, both live and with their recordings.&quot; &quot;Canned Heat&quot; fared reasonably well commercially, reaching number 76 on the Billboard chart.

=== Rise to fame and formation of the classic lineup ===
The first big live appearance of Canned Heat was at the Monterey Pop Festival on June 17, 1967. A picture of the band taken at the performance was featured on the cover of &quot;Down Beat&quot; where an article complimented their playing:
D.A. Pennebaker&#x27;s documentary captured their rendition of &quot;Rollin&#x27; and Tumblin&#x27; and two other songs from the set, &quot;Bullfrog Blues&quot; and &quot;Dust My Broom&quot;, found a place later in a boxed CD set in 1992.

Canned Heat also began to garner their notoriety as &quot;the bad boys of rock&quot; for being jailed in Denver, Colorado, after a police informant provided enough evidence for their arrest for drugs (an incident recalled in their song &quot;My Crime&quot;). Band manager Skip Taylor was forced to obtain the $10,000 bail by selling off Canned Heat&#x27;s publishing rights to Liberty Records president Al Bennett.

After the Denver incident, Frank Cook was replaced with Adolfo de la Parra, who had been playing the drums in Bluesberry Jam (the band which evolved into Pacific Gas &amp; Electric). As an official member of Canned Heat, de la Parra played his first gig on December 1, 1967, sharing top billing with the Doors at the Long Beach Auditorium. This began what de la Parra refers to as the classic and perhaps best known Canned Heat lineup, which recorded some of the band&#x27;s most famous and well-regarded songs. During this &quot;classic&quot; period, Skip Taylor and John Hartmann introduced the use of band member nicknames:
* Bob &quot;The Bear&quot; Hite
* Alan &quot;Blind Owl&quot; Wilson
* Henry &quot;Sunflower&quot; Vestine (and later Harvey &quot;The Snake&quot; Mandel)
* Larry &quot;The Mole&quot; Taylor
* Adolfo &quot;Fito&quot; de la Parra

Their second released album, &quot;Boogie with Canned Heat&quot;, included &quot;On the Road Again&quot;, an updated version of a 1950s composition by Floyd Jones. &quot;On the Road Again&quot; became the band&#x27;s breakout song and was a worldwide success. The album also included a twelve-minute version of &quot;Fried Hockey Boogie&quot;, (credited to Larry Taylor, but derived from John Lee Hooker&#x27;s &quot;Boogie Chillen&#x27; riff) allowed each member to stretch out on his instrument while establishing them with hippie ballroom audiences across America as the &quot;kings of the boogie&quot;. Hite&#x27;s &quot;Amphetamine Annie&quot; (a &quot;speed kills&quot; tune inspired by the drug abuse of an acquaintance and reminiscent of Albert King&#x27;s &quot;The Hunter&quot;), became one of their most enduring songs and one of the first &quot;anti-drug&quot; songs of the decade. Although not featured on the album&#x27;s artwork, this was the first Canned Heat album to have featured drummer de la Parra.

With this success Taylor, Hartmann and new associate Gary Essert leased a Hollywood club they named the Kaleidoscope, in which Canned Heat essentially became the house band; Jefferson Airplane, Grateful Dead, Buffalo Springfield and Sly and the Family Stone also performed there. Also in 1968, after playing before 80,000 at the first annual Newport Pop Festival in September, Canned Heat left for their first European tour. It entailed a month of concert performances and media engagements that included television appearances on the British show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. They also appeared on the German program &quot;Beat Club&quot;, where they lip-synched &quot;On the Road Again&quot;.

=== &quot;Going Up the Country&quot; and Woodstock ===
In October, the band released their third album, &quot;Living the Blues&quot;, which included &quot;Going Up the Country&quot;, their best-known song. Wilson&#x27;s recreation of Henry Thomas&#x27; &quot;Bull-Doze Blues&quot; was almost a note-for-note copy of the original, including Thomas&#x27; instrumental break on the &quot;quills&quot; (pan-pipes) which Jim Horn duplicated on flute. Wilson rewrote the lyrics with a simple message that caught the &quot;back-to-nature&quot; attitude of the late 1960s. The song was a hit in numerous countries around the world (number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100) and was used as the unofficial theme song of the Woodstock Festival in Michael Wadleigh&#x27;s 1970 documentary. The album also included a 19-minute experimental track &quot;Parthenogenesis&quot;, which was a nine-part sound collage of blues, ragas, jaw-harp sounds, guitar distortion and other electronic effects; all pulled together under the direction of manager/producer, Skip Taylor. Longer still is &quot;Refried Boogie&quot;, clocking in at over 40 minutes, recorded live at the Kaleidoscope.

Also recorded live at the Kaleidoscope around this time was the album, which was later 1971 released with the deceptive title, &quot;Live at Topanga Corral&quot; (later renamed &quot;Live at the Kaleidoscope&quot;), by Wand Records because Liberty Records did not want to release a live album at the time and manager Skip Taylor did not want a lawsuit. The band ended 1968 in a big way at a New Year&#x27;s show at the Shrine Auditorium, in Los Angeles, with Bob Hite riding a painted purple dayglo elephant to the stage.

In July 1969, just prior to Woodstock, &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, their fourth album was released. The &quot;Melody Maker&quot; review included: &quot;While less ambitious than some of their work, this is nonetheless an excellent blues-based album and they remain the most convincing of the white electric blues groups.&quot; The album contained mainly original compositions with lyrics relating to the band such as Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Time Was&quot; and a few re-worked covers like &quot;Sic &#x27;em Pigs&quot; (Bukka White&#x27;s &quot;Sic &#x27;em Dogs&quot;) and the original &quot;Canned Heat&quot; by Tommy Johnson.

Within days of the album&#x27;s release, Vestine left the group after an on-stage blow up at the Fillmore West between himself and Larry Taylor. The next night after Mike Bloomfield and Harvey Mandel jammed with Canned Heat, both were offered Vestine&#x27;s spot in the band&#x27;s lineup and Mandel accepted. The new lineup played two dates at the Fillmore before appearing at Woodstock in mid-August.

Arriving via helicopter at Woodstock, Canned Heat played their set on the second day of the festival at sunset. The set included &quot;Going Up the Country&quot; which became the title track in the documentary, even though the band&#x27;s performance was not shown. The song was included in the first (triple) ; while the second album, &quot;Woodstock 2&quot;, contained &quot;Woodstock Boogie&quot;. The expanded &quot;25th Anniversary Collection&quot; added &quot;Leaving This Town&quot; to the band&#x27;s collection of Woodstock performances and &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come&quot; was included on the director&#x27;s cut of the documentary film; leaving only &quot;Let&#x27;s Work Together&quot; to be released.

Before their European tour in early 1970, the band recorded &quot;Future Blues&quot;, an album containing five original compositions and three covers. &quot;Let&#x27;s Work Together&quot;, a Wilbert Harrison song, was the single chosen for release in Europe to coincide with the tour. At the band&#x27;s insistence the U.S. release was delayed in order to offer the author&#x27;s version a chance in the market first. Canned Heat had a big hit with &quot;Let&#x27;s Work Together&quot; and was the band&#x27;s only top forty hit to feature the vocals of Bob &quot;The Bear&quot; Hite. The album featured piano by Dr. John and an atypical jump blues style also. Some controversy was sparked by the Moon landing/Iwo Jima album cover and the upside-down American flag. The upside-down flag was Wilson&#x27;s idea and was a response to his love of nature, growing environmentalism and concern that humankind would soon be polluting the Moon as well as the Earth (as reflected in his song &quot;Poor Moon&quot;).

Material from their 1970 European tour provided the tracks for &quot;Canned Heat &#x27;70 Concert Live in Europe&quot;, later retitled &quot;Live in Europe&quot;. It was a live album that combined tracks from different shows throughout the tour, but was put together in such a way as to resemble one continuous concert for the listener. Although the album garnered some critical acclaim and did well in the UK (peaking at number 15), it had only limited commercial success in the U.S.; Returning from Europe in May 1970, an exhausted Larry Taylor left the band to join John Mayall (who had moved to Laurel Canyon, California) and was followed by Mandel.

=== &quot;Hooker &#x27;n Heat&quot; and the death of Wilson ===
With Taylor and Mandel gone, Vestine returned on guitar, accompanied by bassist Antonio de la Barreda who had played with de la Parra for five years in Mexico City and was previously a member of the groups Jerome and Sam &amp; the Goodtimers. This lineup went into the studio to record with John Lee Hooker the tracks that would yield the double album, &quot;Hooker &#x27;n Heat&quot;. The band had originally met Hooker at the airport in Portland, Oregon, and discovered they were fans of each other&#x27;s work. Hooker and Canned Heat became good friends and Hooker had stated that Wilson was &quot;the greatest harmonica player ever&quot;.

The planned format for the sessions called for Hooker to perform a few songs by himself, followed by some duets with Wilson playing piano or guitar. The rest of the album featured Hooker with some backing by the group (sans Bob Hite, who co-produced the album along with Skip Taylor). The album was finished after Wilson&#x27;s passing and became the first album in Hooker&#x27;s career to make the charts, topping out at number 73 in February 1971. Hooker &#x27;n Heat reunited in 1978 and record a live album at the Fox Venice Theatre in Los Angeles, released in 1981 as, &quot;Hooker &#x27;n Heat, Live at the Fox Venice Theatre&quot;, under Rhino Records. Also in 1989, Canned Heat (and many others) guested on John Lee Hooker&#x27;s album &quot;The Healer&quot;.

Shortly after the original &quot;Hooker &#x27;n Heat&quot; sessions, Wilson, who had always suffered from depression, was said by some to have attempted suicide by driving his van off the road near Hite&#x27;s home in Topanga Canyon. Unlike other members of the band, Wilson did not have much success with women and was deeply upset and frustrated by this. His depression also worsened over time. On September 3, 1970, just before leaving for a festival in Berlin, the band learned of Wilson&#x27;s death by barbiturate overdose; his body was found on a hillside behind Hite&#x27;s home. De la Parra and other members of the band believed that his death was a suicide. Wilson died at the age of 27, just weeks before Jimi Hendrix, and then Janis Joplin, died at the same age.

=== &quot;Historical Figures&quot;, &quot;New Age&quot; and &quot;Human Condition&quot; lineups ===
Joel Scott Hill, who had played with the Strangers and the Joel Scott Hill Trio, was recruited to fill the void left by Wilson&#x27;s death. The band still had a touring contract for September, as well as upcoming studio dates. That fall they toured Australia and Europe; including a show played in Baarn, Netherlands, for the VPRO television program &quot;Piknik&quot; and the following summer they appeared at the Turku Festival in Finland. These performances were recorded, but the recordings were not released until much later, with the albums &quot;Live at Turku Rock Festival&quot; in 1995 and &quot;Under the Dutch Skies 1970–74&quot; in 2007 (which encompassed three separate tours). At the end of 1971 a new studio album, &quot;Historical Figures and Ancient Heads&quot;, was released. The album included Hite&#x27;s vocal duet with Little Richard on &quot;Rockin&#x27; with the King&quot;, written by Skip Taylor and featuring the guitar playing of both Vestine and Joel Scott Hill.

This lineup of Hite, Vestine, Scott Hill, de la Barreda and de la Parra did not last, as the band was in disarray; Scott Hill and de la Barreda&#x27;s attitudes were not fitting in with the rest of the band, and drummer de la Parra decided to call it quits. He was talked out of it by Hite, and it was Scott Hill and de la Barreda who left the band instead.

New additions to the group were James Shane on rhythm guitar and vocals, Ed Beyer on keyboards, and Richard Hite (Bob Hite&#x27;s brother) on bass. This lineup recorded what was the band&#x27;s last album for Liberty/United Artists Records, &quot;The New Age&quot;, released in 1973. This album featured the popular biker-themed anthem &quot;The Harley-Davidson Blues&quot;, written by James Shane. The era of the late 1960s was changing, but nonetheless the band embarked on another European tour, during which they recorded a session with Memphis Slim in Paris for the album &quot;Memphis Heat&quot;. They also recorded with Clarence &quot;Gatemouth&quot; Brown, while still in Paris, for the album &quot;Gates on the Heat&quot; (both were released by Blue Star Records). Footage from this era is included on the DVD &quot;Canned Heat Live at Montreux&quot; (2004).

Met with hard times, de la Parra writes that the band resorted to importing drugs from Mexico to make ends meet between shows. Over $30,000 in debt, manager Skip Taylor advised the band to sign away their future royalties to their previous Liberty/United Artists material and jump to Atlantic Records. After a bad introduction to Atlantic Records, which included a brawl between Hite and Vestine over a vending machine, the band released the album &quot;One More River to Cross&quot; in 1973. Produced by Roger Hawkins and Barry Beckett, this album had a different sound and featured the Muscle Shoals Horns.

On a subsequent promotional tour of Europe, this new &quot;horn band&quot; sound included the talents of Clifford Solomon and Jock Ellis. Absent from Canned Heat at this time, after growing ever more distant, was longtime manager Skip Taylor, who had left after the band joined Atlantic. Atlantic producer Tom Dowd tried to get one more album out of Canned Heat, despite their drug use and heavy drinking; they ultimately recorded an album&#x27;s worth of material at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, during 1974 (featuring some collaboration with former member Mandel), but Atlantic ended its relationship with Canned Heat before it could be released. The masters for the bulk of the material, which had been kept at Skip Taylor&#x27;s house, were destroyed in a fire, and what material was rescued by de la Parra was finally restored and issued decades later, in 1997, titled &quot;The Ties That Bind&quot;.

Shortly thereafter, new manager Howard Wolf set up the struggling band with a gig at California&#x27;s Mammoth Ski Resort. Bob Hite, in a foul rage, went off on the crowd, to the disapproval of Vestine, James Shane and Ed Beyer, who quit the band as a result.

Taking the place of those who departed were pianist Gene Taylor and guitarist Chris Morgan, who both joined in late 1974. Taylor departed in 1976 in response to an argument during a tour of Germany, and after a brief fill-in by Stan Webb (of Chicken Shack), Mark Skyer came in as the new guitar player. In the meantime the band had worked out a deal with Takoma Records, and this &quot;Human Condition/Takoma&quot; lineup recorded the 1977 album &quot;Human Condition&quot;. Despite the appearance of the Chambers Brothers on the album, it was met with very little success, largely because of the growing popularity of disco music in the late 1970s. Before long, more arguments ensued, and Mark Skyer, Chris Morgan and Richard Hite all quit the band in 1977. Hite promptly hired a new bass player, Richard Exley, after befriending him on tour and watching his performance with the band Montana. Becoming fast friends with Hite, Exley toured the remainder of the year with the band and collaborated with Hite on many of the arrangements during their 1976 Texas Bicentennial Comeback Tour. Exley then quit the band after an argument over Hite&#x27;s excessive drinking and drug use on stage. Frustrated and fed up, Exley joined the Texas Heartbreakers at the end of that year but returned periodically to fill in as a favor to Hite while the band struggled to find permanent members amidst heavy drinking and drug use. Exley remarked about his time with the band, &quot;No one ever remembers the bass player ...&quot;. This effectively reduced the band&#x27;s members to just Hite and de la Parra.

=== Burger Brothers revival and the death of Bob Hite ===
The popularity of the blues genre rose in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the release of the musical-comedy film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (1980), starring Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi. During this time, de la Parra had bought into the partnership of an East Hollywood recording studio at which he was again working with former bandmate Larry Taylor. Taylor had been associating with guitarist Mike &quot;Hollywood Fats&quot; Mann and pianist Ronnie Barron and before long Taylor, Barron and Hollywood Fats were in the band. This version referred to by Hite and Mann as the &quot;Burger Brothers&quot; lineup, was soon joined by blind piano player Jay Spell, as Ronnie Barron walked out on the band after a blow-up between himself and Taylor.

The Burger Brothers played the tenth anniversary of Woodstock at Parr Meadows in 1979. A recording of the performance eventually surfaced through King Biscuit Flower Hour&#x27;s Barry Ehrmann as, &quot;Canned Heat in Concert&quot;, in 1995 (de la Parra considers this to be Canned Heat&#x27;s best recorded live album). Another recording made around this time was for Cream Records, who desired a more R&amp;B-style sound than what Canned Heat was currently offering. This upset Hollywood Fats and Mike Halby was brought in to finish the project; which would not find commercial release until 1981 when former band member Tony de la Barreda put it out under RCA as a tribute album called, &quot;In Memory of Bob &quot;The Bear&quot; Hite 1943–1981—&quot;Don&#x27;t Forget To Boogie&quot;&quot;. After a falling out with de la Parra and Hite, Taylor and Mann were increasingly unhappy with the musical direction of the band and eventually left to focus more attention on their Hollywood Fats Band. Nevertheless, Jay Spell was still on board and brought in bass player Jon Lamb; Mike Halby was now a full-time member and long-time guitarist Vestine once again made his return to the band, with Hite and de la Parra as its leaders.

No longer managed by Howard Wolf, Eddie Haddad set the band up touring military bases across the U.S., Europe and Japan non-stop. Returning with little pay after the difficult tour, Jay Spell quit the band. Jon Lamb stayed on for one more tour in the south and just before Christmas 1980 (and lacking the outlaw roots of the others), he too quit the band; but by then even Hite was starting to lose it. He had attempted to give it another try by hiring a large enthusiastic biker with the moniker &quot;The Push&quot; as their manager; hoping that the band&#x27;s popularity with the biker community would give them renewed energy. With new bass player Ernie Rodriguez joining the ranks, Canned Heat recorded the 1981 album, &quot;Kings of the Boogie&quot;, the last album to feature Hite on a few of the tracks.

On April 5, 1981, having collapsed from a heroin overdose during a show at the Palomino in Los Angeles, Bob Hite was later found dead in de la Parra&#x27;s Mar Vista home at the age of 38.

=== Later history and the death of Vestine ===
The death of frontman Bob Hite was a devastating blow that most thought would end the career of Canned Heat; however, de la Parra kept the band alive and would lead it back to prosperity over the next few decades. An Australian tour had been set up before Hite&#x27;s death and harmonica player Rick Kellogg had joined to finish off the &quot;Kings of the Boogie&quot; album. This incarnation of Canned Heat without Bob Hite was nicknamed the &quot;Mouth Band&quot; by Vestine and was a huge hit in Australia, especially with the biker crowd. Under the management of &quot;The Push&quot;, the band toured the States playing biker bars and began work on a video known as &quot;The Boogie Assault&quot;, starring Canned Heat and various members of the San Francisco chapter of the Hells Angels.

As production for &quot;The Push&#x27;s&quot; video dragged on, a drunken Vestine got into a brawl with Ernie Rodriguez and was once again out of the band; this time replaced by guitarist Walter Trout. After a tour with John Mayall, as the production for &quot;The Boogie Assault&quot; continued, de la Parra was forced to fire &quot;The Push&quot; as the band&#x27;s manager; but did eventually finish the video and a live album of the same name recorded in Australia in 1982 (also re-released as &quot;Live in Australia&quot; and &quot;Live in Oz&quot;). This version of Canned Heat would also soon dissolve with a dispute between Mike Halby and de la Parra after the recording of the &quot;Heat Brothers &#x27;84&quot; EP.

During the 1980s the interest in the type of music played by Canned Heat was revived and, despite the past tragedies and permanent instability, the band appeared to be revitalized. In 1985, Trout had left to join John Mayall&#x27;s Bluesbreakers, so Vestine was once again back in the band and he brought with him new musical talent from Oregon in James Thornbury (slide guitar, harmonica and lead vocals) and Skip Jones (bass). They were dubbed the &quot;Nuts and Berries&quot; band by de la Parra, due to their love of organic food. It was not long before former members Larry Taylor (replacing Jones) and Ronnie Barron returned to round out the group. Versions of this lineup would record the live album, &quot;Boogie Up The Country&quot;, in Kassel, Germany, in 1987 and also appear on the &quot;Blues Festival Live in Bonn &#x27;87 Vol 2&quot; compilation. Barron, just as before did not last long in this lineup, nor did Vestine, who was once again ousted from the band due to pressure from Larry Taylor. Replacing Vestine on lead guitar was Junior Watson; his style emulated Hollywood Fats (who died in late 1986) and was perfectly suited for the band as witnessed by the well-regarded album &quot;Reheated&quot;. Unfortunately, the album was released only in Germany in 1988 due to disagreements with the Chameleon Music Group Record label. In 1990, the &quot;Would-Be&quot; lineup of James T, Taylor, Watson, and de la Parra also recorded a sequel live album in Australia entitled &quot;Burnin&#x27; Live&quot;.

The lineup dissolved in the early 1990s as Junior Watson went his own way and Mandel came back into the fold, bringing along Ron Shumake on bass to take some of the load off of Larry Taylor. Mandel, however, left the band after a few tours, so singer and guitarist Becky Barksdale was brought in for a tour of France, Germany, and Hawaii, but lasted no longer. Smokey Hormel was also considered but only played one gig before friction between de la Parra and Larry Taylor caused Taylor to bitterly go his separate way with Hormel in tow.

The revolving door that was Canned Heat continued as Vestine and Watson made their returns to the lineup as the &quot;Heavy Artillery&quot; band. Several former members including Mandel, Barron, and Taylor joined up in de la Parra&#x27;s effort for the album &quot;Internal Combustion&quot;, which was released in 1994, but saw only limited release due to the returning manager Skip Taylor&#x27;s falling out with Red River Records. In 1995, James Thornbury left the band with no hard feelings after ten years of service to live the married life in New South Wales, Australia, and new front-man Robert Lucas came in to take his place. Mandel returned and Shumake left the band in 1996, and after the position of bassist was taken temporarily by Mark &quot;Pocket&quot; Goldberg, Greg Kage took the reins as the bass player, and after a reconciliation with Larry Taylor the band released, &quot;Canned Heat Blues Band&quot;, in 1996. On October 20, 1997, a tired and cancer stricken Vestine died in Paris following the final gig of a European tour. Taylor and Watson subsequently left the band.

=== 2000s–2020s ===
Canned Heat&#x27;s popularity has endured in some European countries and Australia. Their studio albums during this period include &quot;Boogie 2000&quot; (1999), and &quot;Friends in the Can&quot; (2003), which features various guests, including John Lee Hooker, Taj Mahal, Trout, Corey Stevens, Roy Rogers, Mandel, Larry Taylor, and Vestine. Eric Clapton and Dr. John made guest appearances on the &quot;Christmas Album&quot; (2007). In July 2007, a documentary, &quot;Boogie with Canned Heat: The Canned Heat Story&quot;, was released, as was a biography of Wilson, &quot;Blind Owl Blues&quot;, by author Rebecca Davis Winters.

By 2000, Robert Lucas had departed and the lineup was completed by Dallas Hodge (vocals, guitar), John Paulus (guitar) and Stanley &quot;Baron&quot; Behrens (harmonica, saxophone, flute). Lucas returned to Canned Heat in late 2005 but left again in the fall of 2008. He died, age 46, on November 23, 2008, at a friend&#x27;s home in Long Beach, California; the cause was an apparent drug overdose. Other more recent deaths of band members included Hite&#x27;s brother, bassist Richard Hite, who died at age 50 on September 22, 2001, due to complications from cancer. Also, former bassist Antonio de la Barreda died of a heart attack on February 17, 2009.

From late 2008 to the Spring of 2010 the lineup included Dale Spalding (guitar, harmonica and vocals), Barry Levenson (lead guitar), Greg Kage (bass), and classic lineup hold-over and band leader de la Parra on drums. Mandel and Larry Taylor toured with Canned Heat during the summer of 2009 on the Heroes of Woodstock Tour to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Woodstock. In 2010, Taylor and Mandel officially replaced Kage and Levenson, and as of 2012, this lineup (de la Parra, Taylor, Mandel, and Spalding) continued to tour regularly.

In October 2012, during a festival tour in Spain, France and Switzerland, Randy Resnick was called to replace Mandel who had to quit the tour due to health issues. Resnick played two dates, October 4 and 5, but had to return home for prior commitments. De la Parra was able to get Paulus to fly in from Portland to finish the tour. On September 7, 2013, Paulus once again substituted for Mandel at the Southern Maryland Blues Festival. In 2014, he officially replaced Mandel. On August 19, 2019, longtime bass guitarist Taylor died after a twelve-year battle with cancer. Drummer Frank Cook died on July 9, 2021, aged 79.

== Style ==
&quot;AllMusic&quot; writer Joe Viglione wrote of the band, &quot;With Bob Hite and Alan Wilson switching off on vocals, Canned Heat delivered as consistent a blues product as George Thorogood only with more diversity and subtle musical nuances keeping the listener involved&quot;. &quot;Classic Rock&quot; described the band as &quot;the badass blues band that death couldn&#x27;t kill&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s first great boogie-rock band&quot;. &quot;uDiscoverMusic&quot; described them as being among the elite country blues groups and as being &quot;at the zenith of blues-rock&quot;, specializing in &quot;psych trippy R&amp;B&quot; Lindsay Planer described the band&#x27;s style as a blend of &quot;amplified late-&#x27;60s electric rhythm and blues, with an expressed emphasis on loose and limber boogie-woogie&quot;. &quot;Goldmine&quot; described them as a &quot;earthy, outlaw boogie-blues band&quot;. Initially known for soulful interpretations of blues standards, Canned Heat would become known for lengthy psychedelic jams by the end of the &#x27;60s. &quot;iLoveClassicRock&quot; wrote that &quot;they were the first psychedelic band to gain popularity with their music catered to hipsters and any people who love to dance disco-style.&quot; Describing them as &quot;one of America&#x27;s greatest boogie bands&quot;, &quot;Rocks Off&quot; magazine said that &quot;Canned Heat was one of the first real hippie bands to gain popularity&quot; and were known &quot;for their bluesy style mixed with psychedelic funk.&quot; &quot;SputnikMusic&quot; staff wrote that &quot;Canned Heat used the old folk blues style played by legends such as John Lee Hooker as a platform, enriched it with driving boogie elements and served it with a psychedelic vibe.&quot; Adolfo &quot;Fito&quot; de la Parra, who joined the band in 1967, said in a 1991 interview, &quot;Bob Hite and Alan Wilson started Canned Heat in 1966 as a jug band, just to have fun. Both of them were musicologists, record collectors, not musicians.&quot;

<doc id="167676" wikidata="Q7750517" url="?curid=167676" title="The Mask of Orpheus">
<text>The Mask of Orpheus is an opera with music by Harrison Birtwistle, electronic music realised by Barry Anderson and a libretto by Peter Zinovieff. It was premiered in London at the English National Opera on 21 May 1986 to great critical acclaim. A recorded version conducted by Andrew Davis and Martyn Brabbins has also received good reviews. A new production of the opera was staged at the English National Opera in 2019, conducted by Martyn Brabbins and James Henshaw. The work is around three hours long.

==Synopsis==
The structure of the opera&#x27;s plot is complex. Rather than telling a story by starting at A and going through B to C, &quot;The Mask of Orpheus&quot; explores the Orpheus myth in a number of directions at once, examining the various contradictions which are in the various versions of the myth.
This is done by a very elaborate stage design, whereby the stage is divided into a number of different areas, each containing its own part of the action. In addition, each of the major characters – Orpheus, Eurydice and Aristaeus – appear in three forms: as a singer who represents their human forms; as a mime, representing their heroic selves; and as a puppet, representing their myths. Also, individual events may occur within the opera on several occasions, as they are being predicted, as they happen, and as they are being remembered.

An example of this process in action is the seduction of Eurydice by Aristaeus. When first seen in act 1, this event is shown simultaneously in two different versions: in one, Eurydice is raped by Aristaeus before dying; in the other she is not. Later, in act 2, Orpheus remembers this event, but now it is Orpheus, not Aristaeus, who is seducing Eurydice before her death.

Because of the complex structure of the work, it is difficult to provide a detailed synopsis. However, the opera&#x27;s story might be broadly said to be as follows:

==Act 1==
Orpheus and Eurydice fall in love and marry. Eurydice later dies from a snake bite, and Orpheus consults the Oracle of the Dead, intending to follow her to the Underworld.

==Act 2==
Orpheus journeys to the Underworld through seventeen arches, each with a symbolic name. On his journey back, he believes Eurydice is following him, but it is actually Persephone and the mime Eurydice. Orpheus goes back for Eurydice but realises she cannot follow him. Orpheus hangs himself. The act ends with Orpheus waking up, realising that his journey to the Underworld was a dream.

The Seventeen Arches

Each of the arches that Orpheus must travel through is given a symbolic name.

*1st arch – The Arch of Countryside
*2nd arch – The Arch of Crowds
*3rd arch – The Arch of Evening
*4th arch – The Arch of Contrast
*5th arch – The Arch of Dying
*6th arch – The Arch of Wings
*7th arch – The Arch of Colors
*8th arch – The Arch for Secrecy
*9th arch – The Arch of Glass
*10th arch – The Arch of Building
*11th arch – The Arch of Weather
*12th arch – The Arch of Eyes
*13th arch – The Arch of Knives
*14th arch – The Arch of Animals
*15th arch – The Arch of Robes (or Roads)
*16th arch – The Arch of Blood
*17th arch – The Arch of Fear

==Act 3==
At the start of this act, time is moving backwards: Orpheus travels back out of and into the Underworld, and Eurydice dies once more. Then time moves forwards as Orpheus leaves the Underworld again. One version of the Orpheus story is that he is then killed by a thunderbolt thrown by Zeus, while another is that he is dismembered by the women of Dionysus. Orpheus then becomes the subject of a cult and an oracle. Time flows backwards once more, and Orpheus&#x27; death is acted out again, and the opera ends with the Orpheus myth decaying.

==The electronic music==

&quot;The Mask of Orpheus&quot;, in addition to vocal and orchestral music, contains a significant amount of electronic music, which was realised on behalf of Birtwistle by Barry Anderson. Anderson&#x27;s premature death in 1987, as well as a paucity of extant sketch material, has made an objective assessment of the collaboration unclear. The issue has been raised of whether Birtwistle has acknowledged the true extent of his collaboration with Anderson as a fellow composer. Anderson mapped out the electronic music in detail at the IRCAM studios in Paris between 1981 and 1984.

Each act has its own electronic &quot;aura&quot;, which goes on continuously, sometimes prominently, sometimes inaudibly; the voice of Apollo is heard on several occasions as an electronic sound &quot;speaking&quot; in an invented language. There are also six purely electronic interludes created by computer manipulation of harp sounds.

==The staging==
Jocelyn Herbert was commissioned to design the sets and costumes for the opera&#x27;s premiere. The staging was complex, involving suns, rivers, and a flying golden carriage. Each singer wore (and sang through) a mask. Large puppets were created to change proportion on stage. All the masks and costumes were designed to appear timeless, so as to avoid placing the opera in a specific era.

<text>The Electric Prunes are an American psychedelic rock band, formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1965. Much of the band&#x27;s music was, as music historian Richie Unterberger described it, possessed of &quot;an eerie and sometimes anguished ambiance.&quot; Their most successful material was by songwriters Annette Tucker and Nancie Mantz, though the group also penned their own songs. Incorporating psychedelia and elements of embryonic electronic rock, the band&#x27;s sound was marked by innovative recording techniques with fuzz-toned guitars and oscillating sound effects. In addition, guitarist Ken Williams&#x27; and singer James Lowe&#x27;s concept of &quot;free-form garage music&quot; provided the band with a richer sonic palette and exploratory lyrical structure than many of their contemporaries.

The band was signed to Reprise Records in 1966 and released their first single, &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Hard&quot;, in the latter part of the year. Their first album, &quot;The Electric Prunes&quot;, included the band&#x27;s two nationally charting songs, &quot;I Had Too Much to Dream (Last Night)&quot; and &quot;Get Me to the World on Time&quot;. With the appearance of their second album, &quot;Underground&quot;, the band was more free to create their own material. However, the original group disbanded by 1968 when they proved unable to record the innovative and complex arrangements by David Axelrod on the albums &quot;Mass in F Minor&quot; and &quot;Release of an Oath&quot;. Both albums were released under the band&#x27;s name, the rights to which were owned by their record producer David Hassinger, but were largely performed by other musicians. Several of the original band members reconvened in 1999 and began recording again. The band still performs occasionally, although the only remaining original member is lead singer James Lowe.

==History==
===Origin===
The band originated from a surf rock-influenced garage rock group, the Sanctions, in 1965. The Sanctions, which included James Lowe (vocals, guitar), Mark Tulin (bass guitar), Ken Williams (lead guitar), and Michael &quot;Quint&quot; Weakley (drums), recorded 12 cover songs on an acetate disc on March 27, 1965, in a home studio owned by Russ Bottomley. For their next set of recordings on September 29, 1965, the group, then known as Jim and the Lords, was joined by keyboardist Dick Hargrave, who left shortly afterwards to pursue a career in graphic arts. The songs went unreleased until Heartbeat Productions distributed the 2000 album, &quot;Then Came The Electric Prunes&quot;, which was commended for its good sound quality, considering the circumstances in which it was recorded. Back to a quartet, the band, while rehearsing in a garage, met a real estate agent named Barbara Harris. Harris had connections in the music industry, and introduced the group to Dave Hassinger to record demos at Sky Hill Studios. Hassinger, who had been working as the resident sound engineer at RCA Studios and recently completed development for The Rolling Stones&#x27; album, &quot;Aftermath&quot;, expressed a desire to produce a record. He suggested to the group that they change their name, and they considered a list of alternatives. According to Lowe, the name Electric Prunes started off as a joke, but he eventually convinced other band members, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s the one thing everyone will remember. It&#x27;s not attractive, and there&#x27;s nothing sexy about it, but people won&#x27;t forget it.&quot; As a result of the recordings, a single, featuring a cover of the Gypsy Trips&#x27; folk rock tune, &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Hard&quot;, and the Lowe-penned song, &quot;Little Olive&quot;, was released in early 1966, but failed to chart.

===Early success===
Despite the commercial failure of &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Hard&quot;, Reprise Records was encouraged by the group&#x27;s effort, and signed the band to a recording contract that left them under Hassinger&#x27;s authority. Weakley departed the band after the single, and was replaced by Preston Ritter, and rhythm guitarist James &quot;Weasel&quot; Spagnola was recruited to make The Electric Prunes a quintet. Although the band was composing their own material, Hassinger called upon songwriters Annette Tucker and Nancie Mantz to write the majority of the group&#x27;s songs. The new line-up recorded six demos at American Recording Studio and Leon Russell&#x27;s Skyhill Studios studio. These mainly comprised cover songs and Tucker-Mantz compositions. According to Lowe, while at Russell&#x27;s recording studio, &quot;Dave cued up a tape and didn&#x27;t hit &#x27;record,&#x27; and the playback in the studio was way up: ear-shattering vibrating jet guitar. Ken had been shaking his Bigsby wiggle stick with some fuzztone and tremolo at the end of the tape. Forward it was cool. Backward it was amazing. I ran into the control room and said, &#x27;What was that?&#x27; They didn&#x27;t have the monitors on so they hadn&#x27;t heard it. I made Dave cut it off and save it for later.&quot; The fluttering buzz sound was utilized for the opening to the Tucker-Mantz song, &quot;I Had Too Much to Dream (Last Night)&quot;, which also included a heavily textured psychedelic guitar motif. The song was chosen to be released as The Electric Prunes&#x27; second single in November 1966. It peaked at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and reached number 49 on the UK Singles Chart. The success of the single prompted immediate touring, and earned the group a promotional contract with musical equipment makers Vox. Williams recorded an advert, demonstrating the use of Vox&#x27;s wah-wah pedal in early 1967, and the band was featured in magazines such as &quot;Vox Teen Beat&quot;.

The band&#x27;s follow-up single, &quot;Get Me to the World on Time&quot;, which put distorted sound effects to a psychedelic-tinged Bo Diddley beat, was released in May 1967. The song managed to chart at number 27 in the US and number 42 in the UK, and was the most electronically experimental composition by the group thus far. When it came time for The Electric Prunes to record songs for their first album, they were limited musically due to the predominant presence of Tucker and Mantz&#x27;s (also Jill Jones) songwriting partnership, which composed the majority of the album&#x27;s material. The group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Electric Prunes&quot; possessed exotically combined effects, and violin-like guitar riffs, mixed with a diverse, and somewhat uneven, selection of pop songs, with only &quot;Train For Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Luvin&#x27;&quot; being penned by the band. Tracks such as the soft rock tune, &quot;Onie&quot; and &quot;Toonerville Trolley&quot; suggest inconsistency in an attempt to produce a commercially viable sound. Reflecting on the album, Tulin said, &quot;Consequently there are definitely songs that I believe do not belong on the album and were, in fact, a waste of our time and energy. There were several other ideas we were working on, but [we] realized there was no use pursuing them because they too would have been &#x27;too weird.&#x27;&quot;

In July 1967, the band released their fourth single, one of the more unusual compositions to come from the pen of the Tucker-Mantz songwriting duo, &quot;Dr. Do-Good&quot;. The song, which featured Williams playing a prototype steel guitar, and childlike to maddening vocals, was described by music historian Richie Unterberger as &quot;sounding more like a horror movie theme run amok than a radio-ready hit&quot;, and consequently the single bubbled under the Hot 100 at number 128. The Electric Prunes reconvened at American Recording Studios to record their second album, &quot;Underground&quot;, though Hassinger was not as involved in the band&#x27;s activities, which allowed much more creative freedom to the group to write their own material. For the album, the band wrote seven of the twelve tracks, and expanded upon the experimentation of the first album, with inventive guitar reverb and oscillation, in a unified effort. However, in the middle of the recording sessions the line-up went through changes when Ritter departed for musical differences, and was replaced by original drummer Weakley, who appeared on five tracks. Spagnola left near the conclusion of recording to address medical concerns, and Mike Gannon was recruited to finish the album. Gannon was included on just two songs as well as the non-album track, &quot;Everybody Knows You&#x27;re Not In Love&quot;. In August 1967, &quot;Underground&quot; was released, but, without a hit-ready single, did not fare as well on the Billboard 200, where it peaked at number 172. After a U.S. tour in the latter half of 1967, the new line-up embarked on a European tour and this led to appearances at high-profile venues such as The Roundhouse, The Speakeasy Club and Middle Earth. On the final leg of the tour, The Electric Prunes&#x27; performance was recorded in Stockholm by the Swedish Broadcasting Corporation. The recordings were issued in 1997 on the live album, &quot;Stockholm &#x27;67&quot;.

===The Axelrod period===
At the suggestion of manager Lenny Poncher and Hassinger, The Electric Prunes agreed to record a concept album that integrated Gregorian music into psychedelic pop, with the belief it would launch them into commercial success. Poncher recruited David Axelrod, a formally classically trained musician, to compose all of the material for the project. The result, &quot;Mass in F Minor&quot;, was a complex arrangement of religious-based rock, which was sung entirely in Greek and Latin. Although the band did record the songs &quot;Kyrie Eleison&quot;, &quot;Gloria&quot;, and &quot;Credo&quot;, the intricate orchestration proved to be too difficult and time-consuming for the group. As a consequence, Hassinger enlisted the Canadian group The Collectors, among other session musicians, in completing the album, although Lowe, Tulin, and Weakley did contribute to every track.

&quot;Mass in F Minor&quot; was released in January 1968 and reached number 135 on the Billboard 200. An eerie version of the opening track, &quot;Kyrie Eleison&quot;, became somewhat of an underground favorite when it appeared in the soundtrack for the counterculture film, &quot;Easy Rider&quot;.

The Electric Prunes performed with the new songs in concert just once, at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, which Tulin described: &quot;From the outset the performance was a disaster. We missed the intro on the first song and it never got any better. Amp speakers blew, charts fell off music stands and everyone was, in general, in a complete state of confusion. Ended up each song turned into one long jam. I think we were, at times, all in the same key. I made my way over to the four celli and four French horns and told them to &#x27;jam in E.&#x27; Somehow we would hit a break and James would manage a vocal&quot;. 

As a result of financial and musical issues, Weakley and Lowe left the group in early 1968. Tulin and Williams finished a tour with a line-up that also included Kenny Loggins and Jeremy Stuart, but by mid-1968 they too departed the group.

Nonetheless, Hassinger still owned the rights to The Electric Prunes&#x27;s name, and was encouraged by the success of &quot;Mass in F Minor&quot;, which prompted him to assemble a new line-up. He was steered toward the Colorado group, Climax, by Rich Fifield. Fifield had worked in fellow Colorado band, Hardwater (previously the surf rock band The Astronauts), which was managed by Poncher, and produced an album with Axelrod. The new Electric Prunes line-up included Climax members Richard Whetstone (vocals, drums, percussion, guitar), John Herron (organ), and Mark Kincaid (guitar) with Brett Wade (bass guitar), who was recommended by The Collectors. With the group restructured, Axelrod, again, composed all the material for their next album, in the same vein as the previous effort, and centered it around the Jewish prayer, Kol Nidre. The album, titled &quot;Release of an Oath&quot;, utilized several session musicians including Howard Roberts, Carol Kaye, and Earl Palmer, and saw Whetstone as the only band member to contribute to the recordings. Although the album was considered more cohesive and progressive than its predecessor, it failed to chart upon its release in November 1968. Afterwards, Axelrod returned to his past position at Capitol Records, and The Electric Prunes toured as a supporting act for bands such as Steppenwolf, Canned Heat, and New Buffalo Springfield.

===The &quot;New Improved&quot; Electric Prunes===
The band&#x27;s final album, &quot;Just Good Old Rock and Roll&quot;, was released in June 1969 with the cover describing the group as The &quot;New Improved&quot; Electric Prunes. Herron left the group before they completed recording of the album, although he was still credited as the keyboardist. He was replaced by Ron Morgan, who had been the guitarist of Three Dog Night, and an essential session musician for the first three albums released by The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band. With the exception of &quot;Finders Keepers, Losers Weepers&quot;, which was co-written by Jimmy Holiday, all the songs on &quot;Just Good Old Rock and Roll&quot; were composed solely by the band. In addition, Wade composed &quot;Flowing Smoothly&quot;, the B-side to the non-album single, &quot;Hey, Mr. President&quot;.

&quot;Just Good Old Rock and Roll&quot; is much more straightforward than past works, consisting of funk-influenced hard rock, although &quot;So Many People to Tell&quot; and &quot;Silver Passion Mine&quot; also exhibit a late-psychedelic sound. As Whetstone explains, &quot;We were fairly naive in terms of guidance; we had none, so we were experimenting with a lot of musical styles. If you listen to the album, you&#x27;ll hear a lot of diversity, feel and tempo changes...That was our learning curve.&quot; In early 1970, Whetstone and Wade departed the band and moved to Canada where they formed Stallion Thumbrock. Morgan and Kincaid constructed another line-up of The Electric Prunes that included Michael Kearns, Clay Groomer, Huey Plumeigh, and Galen Pugh; however, by mid-1970 the band dissolved.

===Revival and reformation===
Although the band broke up in 1970, their material continued to be circulated through reissues and compilation albums. Following the inclusion of &quot;I Had Too Much to Dream (Last Night)&quot; as the first track on the seminal &quot;&quot; in 1972, a slow return of interest in the band&#x27;s music began. In Europe, the band&#x27;s albums were re-released, with 1986 seeing the reissue of &quot;Underground&quot;, &quot;Release of an Oath&quot;, and, essentially The Electric Prunes&#x27;s first greatest hits album, &quot;Long Days Flight&quot;. This was the first album to include their first single, &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Hard&quot;, the non-LP track &quot;You Never Had It Better&quot;, and the first to be released on the compact disc format in 1989.

By 1997, all of the group&#x27;s albums were available via compact disc. Following the release of the 1997 live album, &quot;Stockholm &#x27;67&quot;, on Heartbeat Records, the original line-up of Tulin, Lowe, Williams, and Weakley (now known as Fortune) reconvened, in 1999, to record new material for the first time in 31 years. After the success of the 2001 compilation album, &quot;Lost Dreams&quot;, the band began to perform live again along with new members.

On October 31, 2001, the band released the album, &quot;Artifact&quot;, which included several guest musicians, most notably former Moby Grape guitarist, Peter Lewis. Deemed the &quot;one we never got to make&quot;, the album was a cohesive take on the band&#x27;s psychedelic sound. In August 2002, the group toured Europe for the first time since 1968, with concerts in the UK and Greece and, in 2003, a DVD looking into the UK portion of their European tour, called &quot;Rewired&quot;, was released. Additional albums were released over the years, including the concept album, &quot;California&quot;, in 2004, and their most experimental album since The Electric Prunes&#x27;s reformation, &quot;Feedback&quot;, in 2006.

On February 26, 2011, Tulin died aged 62 from a heart attack while volunteering at the University of Southern California Catalina Hyperbaric Chamber. After Tulin&#x27;s death, the band went on hiatus, but returned to touring in 2013. On May 22, 2014, the band released &quot;WaS&quot;, which featured new material inspired by the group&#x27;s tour in Tokyo, Japan. The album includes the last recordings with Tulin, and the two live tracks, &quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot; and &quot;Bullet Thru the Backseat&quot;. Preston Ritter died in 2015, aged 65.

<text>Mittelschmerz () is a term for pain due to ovulation. It occurs mid-cycle (between days 7 and 24) and can last minutes to up to several days. The pain affects one side of the lower abdomen and may be dull or sharp in nature. Other symptoms may include spotting. Often it occurs monthly and may alternate sides.
The underlying mechanism is unclear but may involve irritation due to release of blood and fluid from the follicle or high blood levels of luteinizing hormone causing contraction of smooth muscle. Diagnosis involves ruling out other potential causes such as appendicitis, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, ectopic pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections.
Treatment may involve paracetamol or ibuprofen. Birth control pills may be used for prevention. It is not serious, though may reoccur. &quot;Mittelschmerz&quot; affects about 20 to 40% of women. The term is from the German for &quot;middle pain&quot;. Its presence has been used to manage fertility.

==Signs and symptoms==
Mittelschmerz is characterized by lower abdominal and pelvic pain that occurs roughly midway through a woman&#x27;s menstrual cycle. The pain can appear suddenly and usually subsides within hours, although it may sometimes last two or three days. In some cases it can last up to the following cycle. In some women, the mittelschmerz is localized enough so that they can tell which of their two ovaries provided the egg in a given month. Because ovulation occurs on a random ovary each cycle, the pain may switch sides or stay on the same side from one cycle to another.

===Other ovulation symptoms===
Women may notice other physical symptoms associated with their mittelschmerz, during or near ovulation. The most common sign is the appearance of fertile cervical mucus in the days leading up to ovulation. Cervical mucus is one of the primary signs used by various fertility awareness methods. Other symptoms are sometimes called &quot;secondary fertility signs&quot; to distinguish from the three primary signs.

* Mid-cycle or ovulatory bleeding is thought to result from the sudden drop in estrogen that occurs just before ovulation. This drop in hormones can trigger withdrawal bleeding in the same way that switching from active to placebo birth control pills does. The rise in hormones that occurs after ovulation prevents such mid-cycle spotting from becoming as heavy or long lasting as a typical menstruation. Spotting is more common in longer cycles.
* A woman&#x27;s vulva may swell just prior to ovulation, especially the side on which ovulation will occur.
* One of the groin lymph nodes (on the side on which ovulation will occur) will swell to about the size of a pea, and may become tender.

==Causes==
Mittelschmerz is believed to have a variety of causes:

*Follicular swelling: The swelling of follicles in the ovaries prior to ovulation. While only one or two eggs mature to the point of being released, a number of follicles grow during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (non-dominant follicles atrophy prior to ovulation). Because follicles develop on both sides, this theory explains mittelschmerz that occurs simultaneously on both sides of the abdomen.

*Ovarian wall rupture: The ovaries have no openings; at ovulation the egg breaks through the ovary&#x27;s wall. This may make ovulation itself painful for some women.
*Fallopian tube contraction: After ovulation, the fallopian tubes contract (similar to peristalsis of the esophagus), which may cause pain in some women.
*Smooth muscle cell contraction: At ovulation, this pain may be related to smooth muscle cell contraction in the ovary as well as in its ligaments. These contractions occur in response to an increased level of prostaglandin F2-alpha, itself mediated by the surge of luteinizing hormone (LH).

*Irritation: At the time of ovulation, blood or other fluid is released from the ruptured egg follicle. This fluid may cause irritation of the abdominal lining.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of mittelschmerz is generally made if a woman is mid-cycle and a pelvic examination shows no abnormalities. If the pain is prolonged and/or severe, other diagnostic procedures such as an abdominal ultrasound may be performed to rule out other causes of abdominal pain.

The pain of mittelschmerz is sometimes mistaken for appendicitis and is one of the differential diagnoses for appendicitis in women of child-bearing age.

==Treatment==
The pain is not harmful and does not signify the presence of disease. No treatment is usually necessary. Pain relievers (analgesics) such as NSAIDS (Non-steroidal anti inflammatories) may be needed in cases of prolonged or intense pain.

Hormonal forms of contraception can be taken to prevent ovulation—and therefore ovulatory pain—but otherwise there is no known prevention.

==Usefulness==
Women charting with some form of fertility awareness may find mittelschmerz to be a helpful secondary sign in detecting ovulation. Because normal sperm life is up to five days, however, mittelschmerz alone does not provide sufficient advance warning to avoid pregnancy. Because other causes of minor abdominal pain are common, mittelschmerz alone also cannot be used to confirm the beginning of the post-ovulatory infertile period.

<text>Henri Laurens (February 18, 1885 – May 5, 1954) was a French sculptor and illustrator.

==Early life and education==
Born in Paris, Henri Laurens worked as a stonemason before he became a sculptor. From 1899 to 1902, he attended drawing classes at the École d&#x27;Art Industriel, during which he produced works that were greatly influenced by the popularity of Auguste Rodin.

==Career==
Later Laurens was drawn to a new gathering of artistic creativity in Montparnasse. From 1915, he began to sculpt in the Cubist style after meeting Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Juan Gris and Fernand Léger.

Laurens was exempted from call-up for the First World War, after having a leg amputated in 1909 due to osteo-tuberculosis.
Multi-talented, Laurens worked with poster paint, and collage. He was an engraver, and created theatre design and decoration. In 1915, he illustrated a book for his friend, the author Pierre Reverdy.

In 1937, he was awarded the Helena Rubinstein Prize, which brought him in additional commissions. In 1938, he shared an exhibition with Braque and Picasso that travelled to major Scandinavian cities. In 1947, he made prints for book illustrations. In 1948, he exhibited his art at the important international &quot;Venice Biennale&quot;. That same year, he exhibited at the &quot;Galerie d&#x27;Art Moderne&quot; in Basel, Switzerland.

Many of his sculptures are massive objects. An example of this style is the monumental piece &quot;L&#x27;Amphion&quot;, which he first designed on a smaller scale before created the final version in 1952 for the Central University of Venezuela, Caracas, after a request from the architect Carlos Raúl Villanueva.

Laurens&#x27; sculptural work influenced the work of architect Jørn Utzon, famous for the Sydney Opera House, in particular Laurens&#x27; tomb for an aviator designed for the cemetery of Montparnasse, Paris, in 1924.

==Death==
Henri Laurens died in Paris, after collapsing while out on an evening walk, and was interred in the Cimetière du Montparnasse there. His tomb is decorated with his sculpture, &quot;La Douleur&quot;.

<doc id="167695" wikidata="Q511277" url="?curid=167695" title="The Fabulous Thunderbirds">
<text>The Fabulous Thunderbirds is an American blues band formed in 1974. Singer Kim Wilson is the only constant member through the band&#x27;s entire history. Their 1986 album &quot;Tuff Enuff&quot; sold over a million copies, and spawned two minor hit singles: the title track and &quot;Wrap It Up&quot;.

==Career==
After performing for several years in the Austin, Texas, blues scene, the band won a recording contract with Takoma/Chrysalis Records and later signed with Epic Records. In 2011, they signed with Severn Records.

Their first two albums were released in 1979 and 1980, with Kim Wilson&#x27;s lead vocals and harmonica, Jimmie Vaughan as lead guitarist, and Keith Ferguson on bass guitar. Mike Buck was on drums for the first album but left the band and was replaced by Fran Christina on the second. Both albums initially sold through the small number printed (about 3000 units) and are now regarded as significant blues recordings. The Thunderbirds&#x27; blues style mixed Texas blues with the harmonica-laced swamp blues sounds of Slim Harpo and Lazy Lester—both of whom the Thunderbirds covered. The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Butt-Rockin&quot;&#x27;, released in 1981, took the band closer to old rhythm and blues and added additional musicians playing piano and brass.

Although the Fabulous Thunderbirds had become favorites of fellow musicians—opening shows for the likes of the Rolling Stones and Eric Clapton—and had been critically well-received, the band&#x27;s records did not sell well. Chrysalis dropped the band following the release of &quot;T-Bird Rhythm&quot;, leaving the band without a contract for four years. While still in limbo, the Fabulous Thunderbirds continued to play concerts across the US. During this time, bassist Keith Ferguson left the band and was replaced by Preston Hubbard, a former member of Roomful of Blues. Also during this time, the band was featured on the 1983 Carlos Santana album &quot;Havana Moon&quot;. In 1985, the band landed another recording contract with Epic/Associated.

The single &quot;Tuff Enuff&quot; was featured in the 1986 film &quot;Gung Ho&quot;. It was also featured in the film &quot;Tough Guys&quot;, as was the follow-up single, &quot;Wrap It Up&quot;, which went to number 50 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. &quot;Tuff Enuff&quot; remains the band&#x27;s only Top 40 hit, peaking at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album &quot;Tuff Enuff&quot; went gold in several countries and was subsequently certified platinum in the United States, with sales of over one million. The band&#x27;s music was also used in the 1987 movie &quot;Hot Pursuit&quot;. The Vaughan–Wilson composition &quot;Twist It Off&quot; appears in the 1987 Michael J. Fox and Joan Jett film &quot;Light of Day&quot; and on the issued soundtrack. The band also appears in the film performing the song live. The Fabulous Thunderbirds&#x27; next album, &quot;Hot Number&quot;, fell off the charts quickly. But following that, their recording of &quot;Powerful Stuff&quot; was a success, based in part on its inclusion in the 1988 film &quot;Cocktail&quot;.

Jimmie Vaughan left the band in 1990 to record an album with his brother Stevie Ray Vaughan, &quot;Family Style&quot;. Following Stevie Ray&#x27;s death in 1990, Jimmie pursued a full-time solo career. 
The band then embarked on a long series of lineup changes and albums throughout the 1990s. The Fabulous Thunderbirds replaced Vaughan with two guitarists, Duke Robillard and Kid Bangham. Long-time drummer Fran Christina left in 1996 and went on to join with Marcia Ball and later Doug Sahm&#x27;s Last Real Texas Blues Band. Doug &quot;Kid&quot; Bangham left the band after three years to pursue a solo career and open the Carver School of Music and the Carver Institute of Rock in Carver, Massachusetts.

In the early 1990s, Kim Wilson recorded a pair of solo albums while continuing to tour with the Fabulous Thunderbirds. In 1994, the band recorded its ninth album, &quot;Roll of the Dice&quot;, which was released on Private Music in 1995. &quot;High Water&quot; followed in 1997, although this was actually a collaboration between Wilson and studio musicians Steve Jordan and Danny Kortchmar issued under the Fabulous Thunderbirds name.

Former bassist Keith Ferguson died of liver failure on April 29, 1997, at the age of 50.

On the evening of February 16, 2000, the Fabulous Thunderbirds were the first band ever to be broadcast on the Internet using high-definition cameras in what is claimed to be one of the first high-resolution multi-track recordings of a live concert event. The companion CD &quot;Live!&quot; was released in 2001.; the companion DVD, &quot;Invitation Only&quot;, presents this event in standard resolution due to limitations of the format.

The band recorded &quot;Painted On&quot; in 2005, produced by Steve Berlin (of Los Lobos) and featuring Rachel Nagy of the Detroit Cobras on the track &quot;Love Speaks Louder Than Words&quot;. Guitarist Nick Curran joined Wilson on vocals for &quot;Two Time Fool&quot;.

In 2016, Kim Wilson announced that the Fabulous Thunderbirds lineup for 2016 will be Steve Gomes on bass, Kevin Anker on keyboards, Wes Watkins on drums, with holdover Johnny Moeller on guitar. This lineup plus drummer Rob Stupka recorded the album &quot;Strong Like That&quot; released in August 2016.

Former bassist Preston Hubbard (born on March 15, 1953, in Providence, Rhode Island) was found dead at his home in St. Louis, Missouri, on August 17, 2016, at the age of 63. Former keyboardist Gene Taylor died on February 20, 2021.

<text>The &#x27; or &#x27; (Latin for &quot;The Book of Calculation&quot;) was a 1202 Latin work on arithmetic by Leonardo of Pisa, posthumously known as Fibonacci. It is primarily famous for introducing both base-10 positional notation and the symbols known as Arabic numerals in Europe.

==Premise==
 was among the first Western books to describe the Hindu–Arabic numeral system and to use symbols resembling modern &quot;Arabic numerals&quot;. By addressing the applications of both commercial tradesmen and mathematicians, it promoted the superiority of the system and the use of these glyphs.

Although the book&#x27;s title is sometimes translated as &quot;The Book of the Abacus&quot;, notes that it is an error to read this as referring to the abacus as a calculating device. Rather, the word &quot;abacus&quot; was used at the time to refer to calculation in any form; the spelling &quot;abbacus&quot; with two &quot;b&quot;s was, and still is in Italy, used to refer to calculation using Hindu-Arabic numerals, which can avoid confusion. The book describes methods of doing calculations without aid of an abacus, and as confirms, for centuries after its publication the algorismists (followers of the style of calculation demonstrated in ) remained in conflict with the abacists (traditionalists who continued to use the abacus in conjunction with Roman numerals). The historian of mathematics Carl Boyer emphasizes in his &quot;History of Mathematics&quot; that although &quot;&quot;Liber abaci&quot;...is &quot;not&quot; on the abacus&quot; &quot;&quot;, nevertheless &quot;...it is a very thorough treatise on algebraic methods and problems in which the use of the Hindu-Arabic numerals is strongly advocated.&quot;

==Summary of sections==
The first section introduces the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, including its arithmetic and methods for converting between different representation systems. This section also includes the first known description of trial division for testing whether a number is composite and, if so, factoring it.

The second section presents examples from commerce, such as conversions of currency and measurements, and calculations of profit and interest.

The third section discusses a number of mathematical problems; for instance, it includes the Chinese remainder theorem, perfect numbers and Mersenne primes as well as formulas for arithmetic series and for square pyramidal numbers. Another example in this chapter involves the growth of a population of rabbits, where the solution requires generating a numerical sequence. Although the resulting Fibonacci sequence dates back long before Leonardo, its inclusion in his book is why the sequence is named after him today.

The fourth section derives approximations, both numerical and geometrical, of irrational numbers such as square roots.

The book also includes proofs in Euclidean geometry. Fibonacci&#x27;s method of solving algebraic equations shows the influence of the early 10th-century Egyptian mathematician Abū Kāmil Shujāʿ ibn Aslam.

==Fibonacci&#x27;s notation for fractions==
In reading , it is helpful to understand Fibonacci&#x27;s notation for rational numbers, a notation that is intermediate in form between the Egyptian fractions commonly used until that time and the vulgar fractions still in use today.

Fibonacci&#x27;s notation differs from modern fraction notation in three key ways:

# Modern notation generally writes a fraction to the right of the whole number to which it is added, for instance formula_1 for 7/3. Fibonacci instead would write the same fraction to the left, i.e., formula_2.
# Fibonacci used a &quot;composite fraction&quot; notation in which a sequence of numerators and denominators shared the same fraction bar; each such term represented an additional fraction of the given numerator divided by the product of all the denominators below and to the right of it. That is, formula_3, and formula_4. The notation was read from right to left. For example, 29/30 could be written as formula_5, representing the value formula_6. This can be viewed as a form of mixed radix notation and was very convenient for dealing with traditional systems of weights, measures, and currency. For instance, for units of length, a foot is 1/3 of a yard, and an inch is 1/12 of a foot, so a quantity of 5 yards, 2 feet, and formula_7 inches could be represented as a composite fraction: formula_8 yards. However, typical notations for traditional measures, while similarly based on mixed radixes, do not write out the denominators explicitly; the explicit denominators in Fibonacci&#x27;s notation allow him to use different radixes for different problems when convenient. Sigler also points out an instance where Fibonacci uses composite fractions in which all denominators are 10, prefiguring modern decimal notation for fractions.
# Fibonacci sometimes wrote several fractions next to each other, representing a sum of the given fractions. For instance, 1/3+1/4 = 7/12, so a notation like formula_9 would represent the number that would now more commonly be written as the mixed number formula_10, or simply the improper fraction formula_11. Notation of this form can be distinguished from sequences of numerators and denominators sharing a fraction bar by the visible break in the bar. If all numerators are 1 in a fraction written in this form, and all denominators are different from each other, the result is an Egyptian fraction representation of the number. This notation was also sometimes combined with the composite fraction notation: two composite fractions written next to each other would represent the sum of the fractions.

The complexity of this notation allows numbers to be written in many different ways, and Fibonacci described several methods for converting from one style of representation to another. In particular, chapter II.7 contains a list of methods for converting an improper fraction to an Egyptian fraction, including the greedy algorithm for Egyptian fractions, also known as the Fibonacci–Sylvester expansion.

== &quot;Modus Indorum&quot; ==
In the , Fibonacci says the following introducing the affirmative &quot;Modus Indorum&quot; (the method of the Indians), today known as Hindu–Arabic numeral system or base-10 positional notation. It also introduced digits that greatly resembled the modern Arabic numerals.

In other words, in his book he advocated the use of the digits 0–9, and of place value. Until this time Europe used Roman numerals, making modern mathematics almost impossible. The book thus made an important contribution to the spread of decimal numerals. The spread of the Hindu-Arabic system, however, as Ore writes, was &quot;long-drawn-out&quot;, taking many more centuries to spread widely, and did not become complete until the later part of the 16th century, accelerating dramatically only in the 1500s with the advent of printing.

== Textual history ==
The first appearance of the manuscript was in 1202. No copies of this version are known. A revised version of dedicated to Michael Scot, appeared in 1227 CE. There are at least nineteen manuscripts extant containing parts of this text. There are three complete versions of this manuscript from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. There are a further nine incomplete copies known between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries, and there may be more not yet identified.

There were no known printed versions of until Boncompagni&#x27;s Italian translation of 1857. The first complete English translation was Sigler&#x27;s text of 2002.

<doc id="167702" wikidata="Q379448" url="?curid=167702" title="Hot Tuna">
<text>Hot Tuna is an American blues rock band formed in 1969 by former Jefferson Airplane members Jorma Kaukonen (guitarist/vocals) and Jack Casady (bassist). Although it has always been a fluid aggregation, with musicians coming and going over the years, the band&#x27;s center has always been Kaukonen and Casady&#x27;s ongoing collaboration.

== History ==
=== 1969–1973: beginnings ===
Hot Tuna began as a side project to Jefferson Airplane, intended to mark time while Grace Slick recovered from vocal cord nodule surgery that had left her unable to perform. They initially named the group Hot Shit but then decided on the more innocuous Hot Tuna. That name came from someone Jorma Kaukonen referred to as a &quot;witty wag&quot; who called out &quot;hot tuna&quot; after hearing the line &quot;What&#x27;s that smell like fish, oh baby&quot;, from the song &quot;Keep On Truckin&#x27;&quot;. Kaukonen, Jack Casady, Paul Kantner and new drummer Joey Covington played several shows around San Francisco, including the Airplane&#x27;s original club, The Matrix, before Jefferson Airplane resumed performing to support &quot;Volunteers&quot;. (Although Covington had been hired by Jefferson Airplane, he only performed at select engagements, with Spencer Dryden continuing to perform as the band&#x27;s principal drummer until his 1970 dismissal). Once the Airplane had resumed touring, Tuna found itself opening for the Airplane. Their early repertoire derived mainly from Kaukonen&#x27;s Airplane material and covers of American country and blues artists such as Reverend Gary Davis, Jelly Roll Morton, Bo Carter and Blind Blake.

In September 1969, Kaukonen and Casady employed the moniker for a week of acoustic-based concerts at the New Orleans House in Berkeley, California; recordings culled from this engagement were released as the band&#x27;s eponymous debut album in 1970. This album has become affectionately known by the group&#x27;s fans as the &quot;breaking glass album&quot;, because of the sound of breaking beer glasses during the recording of &quot;Uncle Sam Blues&quot;. Some tracks included Will Scarlett on harmonica. After the album was recorded, Jorma&#x27;s brother Peter Kaukonen soon replaced Kantner on rhythm guitar and Jefferson Airplane co-lead vocalist Marty Balin joined on vocals for the electric songs. In 1970, the younger Kaukonen was replaced by Paul Ziegler.
That summer, RCA paid for the band to go to Jamaica to record their next album, but the album was never finished, in part due to a financial dispute between Balin (who left both bands shortly thereafter) and Kaukonen and Casady. Violinist Papa John Creach joined Hot Tuna and Jefferson Airplane in October 1970. Both bands finished a joint tour in November 1970 with shows at the Fillmore East.

In September 1970, Kaukonen and Casady performed two acoustic-based shows as Hot Tuna without Jefferson Airplane at Pepperland (a large dance hall in San Rafael, California) and received good reviews, further signifying that Hot Tuna could survive without the other band to support it.

As Jefferson Airplane wound down and stopped regularly touring for over eighteen months (save for a handful of concerts in the summer of 1971 and winter of 1972) after the Fillmore East shows, Hot Tuna became an independent group. In this era, Hot Tuna&#x27;s members were Kaukonen, Casady, drummer Sammy Piazza, and Creach, moving fully to the electric band format. This lineup was first documented on the album &quot;First Pull Up, Then Pull Down&quot; (1971), which was recorded live at the Chateau Liberte, an obscure club located near Los Gatos, California, in the Santa Cruz Mountains that was favored by the band throughout the era. The group also appeared on three tracks from Papa John Creach&#x27;s debut solo album, as well as &quot;Walking the Tou Tou&quot; from his second album, &quot;Filthy!&quot;

The studio albums &quot;Burgers&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Phosphorescent Rat&quot; (1974) followed, with Creach leaving before the latter was recorded. These two albums featured mostly Kaukonen compositions. On the former album, David Crosby sang supporting vocals on &quot;Highway Song&quot;, while keyboardist Nick Buck (who frequently guested with the group in the studio for the next five years before serving as a touring member in 1977) contributed to two tracks.

=== 1974–1977: Power trio ===
As the band prepared for its 1974 tour in support of &quot;The Phosphorescent Rat&quot;, Kaukonen laid off Piazza after deciding to have the band return to its semi-acoustic repertoire. Kaukonen and Casady then proceeded to record Kaukonen&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Quah&quot;. However, July 1974 marked a departure from their primarily bluesy, acoustic style when Hot Tuna dropped their acoustic sets completely and morphed into a heavy rock band. In October 1974, the group performed on &quot;The Midnight Special&quot;.

The albums &quot;America&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1975), &quot;Yellow Fever&quot; (1975), and &quot;Hoppkorv&quot; (1976) showcase a power trio with the addition of new drummer Bob Steeler. Jeff Tamarkin&#x27;s liner notes on the RCA &quot;Platinum Gold Hot Tuna Collection&quot; characterize this trilogy as being emblematic of the band&#x27;s &quot;rampage years.&quot; Kaukonen is quoted as saying the change of focus was because &quot;it was just fun to be loud.&quot; During this period, Kaukonen&#x27;s electric guitar playing was multi-layered, prominently showcasing such effects as the Roland Jet phaser. His &quot;rampage&quot; style is typified by the solos on &quot;Funky #7&quot; and &quot;Serpent of Dreams&quot; on &quot;America&#x27;s Choice&quot; and &quot;Song for the Fire Maiden,&quot; &quot;Sunrise Dance with the Devil,&quot; and &quot;Surphase Tension&quot; on &quot;Yellow Fever&quot;. Live performances throughout the epoch were distinguished by free-flow improvisational jams and very long sets (up to six hours uninterrupted) with extended versions of their studio material. A November 1976 concert at the Palladium in New York City featured a 16-minute version of &quot;Invitation.&quot; However, producer Harry Maslin did not appreciate the group&#x27;s style and held them to a more traditional rock format (including several cover songs) for &quot;Hoppkorv&quot;. In 1977, Kaukonen began to perform solo sets before the band would perform. The trio stopped touring at the end of 1977 and performed its final concert at the Palladium on November 26, with keyboardist Nick Buck and saxophonist &quot;Buffalo&quot; Bob Roberts.

Although live performances from all iterations of the group enjoyed a notable cult following for much of the 1970s, Hot Tuna failed to rival or eclipse Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship from a commercial standpoint. All but two Hot Tuna albums from the era reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100, &quot;America&#x27;s Choice&quot; was their only post-1972 album to chart for more than ten weeks, peaking at No. 75.

=== 1978–1985: hiatus and brief reunion ===
Due to emergent tensions between Kaukonen and Casady, a planned 1978 tour was canceled, with Kaukonen filling these dates by performing solo. A double live album, &quot;Double Dose&quot;, was released that year as a document of the previous year&#x27;s tour. Casady and Kaukonen went their separate ways and pursued short-lived careers in the new wave bands SVT and Vital Parts, respectively. In 1979, Kaukonen released his second solo album and Grunt Records released the Hot Tuna compilation &quot;Final Vinyl&quot;.

Rhythm guitarist Michael Falzarano and drummer Shigemi Komiyama joined Kaukonen and Casady for a Hot Tuna reunion tour in 1983. The group played a mix of new material alongside the classic Hot Tuna songs. This, combined with the group&#x27;s hard rock and heavy metal approach, were not well received, with reports of fans walking out of shows.

=== 1986–present ===

Hot Tuna again reformed in 1986, with producer Joey Balin joining on rhythm guitar until 1987. Kantner joined the band in 1987 and 1988, adding some old Jefferson Airplane songs to the setlist. Grace Slick appeared with them for one show at The Fillmore in March 1988. The band continued into 1989 and Kaukonen and Casady joined the 1989 Jefferson Airplane reunion album and tour, performing acoustic Hot Tuna sets in the middle of each show. At the end of the Airplane tour, Hot Tuna resumed their electric performances, adding Falzarano and drummer Joey Stefko. Shortly thereafter, New Yorker Harvey Sorgen replaced Stefko on drums and Galen Underwood joined on keyboards for their first album of all new material in almost 14 years, 1990&#x27;s &quot;Pair a Dice Found&quot;. Kaukonen and Falzarano both contributed original songs.

Throughout the 1990s, Hot Tuna again alternated between acoustic and electric styles. The two &quot;Sweetwater&quot; albums were predominantly acoustic sets with guests such as Bob Weir, Maria Muldaur and former Jefferson Starship bassist-keyboardist Pete Sears; the latter was to join the group for the remainder of the decade.

On August 13, 1994 the duo would perform with &quot;The Band &amp; Friends&quot; (along with Bruce Hornsby) on the South Stage at Woodstock &#x27;94.

The 1997 release &quot;Live in Japan&quot; was in many ways reminiscent of the very first Hot Tuna album, having a minimalistic sound and being recorded live at a tiny venue (Stove&#x27;s in Yokohama). Falzarano and Sears stayed with the band until the early 2000s.

In 2004, Casady and Kaukonen were joined by mandolinist Barry Mitterhoff and drummer Erik Diaz. In August 2009, following the departure of Diaz, Skoota Warner officially joined the band as drummer. In November 2010, Hot Tuna performed as a semi-acoustic trio: Casady, Kaukonen and Mitterhoff at a Midnight Ramble at Levon Helm&#x27;s Barn studio in Woodstock, New York. In the same month, Kaukonen announced on his blog that Hot Tuna had begun recording its first studio album in 20 years. The album, &quot;Steady as She Goes&quot;, was released by Red House Records on April 5, 2011. For the first half of 2011, guitarist Jim Lauderdale and harmonica player Charlie Musselwhite toured with them; later in the year they were joined by Musselwhite, guitarists David Bromberg, Larry Campbell, Steve Kimock, and G. E. Smith, and vocalist Teresa Williams. Both Campbell and Williams, who guested on the &quot;Steady as She Goes&quot; album, have remained with the band in a touring capacity. In 2014, Justin Guip, who had engineered the album in addition to Kaukonen&#x27;s recent solo work, took over drumming duties from Warner.

<doc id="167703" wikidata="Q868575" url="?curid=167703" title="Empowerment">
<text>Empowerment is the degree of autonomy and self-determination in people and in communities. This enables them to represent their interests in a responsible and self-determined way, acting on their own authority. It is the process of becoming stronger and more confident, especially in controlling one&#x27;s life and claiming one&#x27;s rights. Empowerment as action refers both to the process of self-empowerment and to professional support of people, which enables them to overcome their sense of powerlessness and lack of influence, and to recognize and use their resources.

As a term, empowerment originates from American community psychology and is associated with the social scientist Julian Rappaport (1981).

In social work, empowerment forms a practical approach of resource-oriented intervention. In the field of citizenship education and democratic education, empowerment is seen as a tool to increase the responsibility of the citizen. Empowerment is a key concept in the discourse on promoting civic engagement. Empowerment as a concept, which is characterized by a move away from a -oriented towards a more strength-oriented perception, can increasingly be found in management concepts, as well as in the areas of continuing education and self-help.

==Definitions==
Robert Adams points to the limitations of any single definition of &#x27;empowerment&#x27;, and the danger that academic or specialist definitions might take away the word and the connected practices from the very people they are supposed to belong to. Still, he offers a minimal definition of the term: 
&#x27;Empowerment: the capacity of individuals, groups and/or communities to take control of their circumstances, exercise power and achieve their own goals, and the process by which, individually and collectively, they are able to help themselves and others to maximize the quality of their lives.&#x27;
One definition for the term is &quot;an intentional, ongoing process centered in the local community, involving mutual respect, critical reflection, caring, and group participation, through which people lacking an equal share of resources gain greater access to and control over those resources&quot;.

Rappaport&#x27;s (1984) definition includes: &quot;Empowerment is viewed as a process: the mechanism by which people, organizations, and communities gain mastery over their lives.&quot;

Sociological empowerment often addresses members of groups that social discrimination processes have excluded from decision-making processes through – for example – discrimination based on disability, race, ethnicity, religion, or gender. Empowerment as a methodology is also associated with feminism.

==Process==
Empowerment is the process of obtaining basic opportunities for marginalized people, either directly by those people, or through the help of non-marginalized others who share their own access to these opportunities. It also includes actively thwarting attempts to deny those opportunities. Empowerment also includes encouraging, and developing the skills for, self-sufficiency, with a focus on eliminating the future need for charity or welfare in the individuals of the group. This process can be difficult to start and to implement effectively.

===Strategy===
One empowerment strategy is to assist marginalized people to create their own nonprofit organization, using the rationale that only the marginalized people, themselves, can know what their own people need most, and that control of the organization by outsiders can actually help to further entrench marginalization. Charitable organizations lead from outside of the community, for example, can disempower the community by entrenching a dependence charity or welfare. A nonprofit organization can target strategies that cause structural changes, reducing the need for ongoing dependence. Red Cross, for example, can focus on improving the health of indigenous people, but does not have authority in its charter to install water-delivery and purification systems, even though the lack of such a system profoundly, directly and negatively impacts health. A nonprofit composed of the indigenous people, however, could ensure their own organization does have such authority and could set their own agendas, make their own plans, seek the needed resources, do as much of the work as they can, and take responsibility – and credit – for the success of their projects (or the consequences, should they fail).

The process of which enables individuals/groups to fully access personal or collective power, authority and influence, and to employ that strength when engaging with other people, institutions or society. In other words, &quot;Empowerment is not giving people power, people already have plenty of power, in the wealth of their knowledge and motivation, to do their jobs magnificently. We define empowerment as letting this power out.&quot; It encourages people to gain the skills and knowledge that will allow them to overcome obstacles in life or work environment and ultimately, help them develop within themselves or in the society.

To empower a female &quot;...sounds as though we are dismissing or ignoring males, but the truth is, both genders desperately need to be equally empowered.&quot; Empowerment occurs through improvement of conditions, standards, events, and a global perspective of life.

===Criticism===
Before there can be the finding that a particular group requires empowerment and that therefore their self-esteem needs to be consolidated on the basis of awareness of their strengths, there needs to be a deficit diagnosis usually carried out by experts assessing the problems of this group. The fundamental asymmetry of the relationship between experts and clients is usually not questioned by empowerment processes. It also needs to be regarded critically, in how far the empowerment approach is really applicable to all patients/clients. It is particularly questionable whether [mentally ill] people in acute crisis situations are in a position to make their own decisions. According to Albert Lenz, people behave primarily regressive in acute crisis situations and tend to leave the responsibility to professionals. It must be assumed, therefore, that the implementation of the empowerment concept requires a minimum level of communication and reflectivity of the persons involved.

Another criticism is that empowerment implies that the drive for change comes from an external person. For example, in healthcare, a patient being encouraged by their doctor to track their symptoms and adjust their medication accordingly would be empowerment, where as a patient deciding on their own that they wanted to improve their medication regimen and thus started tracking would be an example of self-empowerment. A recently coined term, self-empowerment &quot;describes patients’ and informal caregivers’ power to perform activities that are not mandated by health care and to take control over their own lives and self-management with increased self-efficacy and confidence&quot;.

== In social work and community psychology ==

In social work, empowerment offers an approach that allows social workers to increase the capacity for self-help of their clients. For example, this allows clients not to be seen as passive, helpless &#x27;victims&#x27; to be rescued but instead as a self-empowered person fighting abuse/ oppression; a fight, in which the social worker takes the position of a facilitator, instead of the position of a &#x27;rescuer&#x27;.

Marginalized people who lack self-sufficiency become, at a minimum, dependent on charity, or welfare. They lose their self-confidence because they cannot be fully self-supporting. The opportunities that denied them also deprive them of the pride of accomplishment which others, who have those opportunities, can develop for themselves. This in turn can lead to psychological, social and even mental health problems. &quot;Marginalized&quot; here refers to the overt or covert trends within societies whereby those perceived as lacking desirable traits or deviating from the group norms tend to be excluded by wider society and ostracized as undesirables.

===In health promotion practice and research===
As a concept, and model of practice, empowerment is also used in health promotion research and practice. The key principle is for individuals to gain increased control over factors that influence their health status.

To empower individuals and to obtain more equity in health, it is also important to address health-related behaviors.

Studies suggest that health promotion interventions aiming at empowering adolescents should enable active learning activities, use visualizing tools to facilitate self-reflection, and allow the adolescents to influence intervention activities.

==In economics==
According to Robert Adams, there is a long tradition in the UK and the USA respectively to advance forms of self-help that have developed and contributed to more recent concepts of empowerment. For example, the free enterprise economic theories of Milton Friedman embraced self-help as a respectable contributor to the economy. Both the Republicans in the US and the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher built on these theories. &#x27;At the same time, the mutual aid aspects of the concept of self-help retained some currency with socialists and democrats.&#x27;

In economic development, the empowerment approach focuses on mobilizing the self-help efforts of the poor, rather than providing them with social welfare. Economic empowerment is also the empowering of previously disadvantaged sections of the population, for example, in many previously colonized African countries.

===Consumer empowerment===
A consumer empowerment strategy was put in place in the United Kingdom by the 2010-2015 coalition government. The strategy, produced by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Behavioural Insights Team at the UK Cabinet Office, sought to introduce voluntary measures and &quot;nudges&quot; which could help consumers &quot;find and adopt the best choices for their circumstances and needs&quot;. Activities promoted by the strategy included the &quot;midata&quot; programme under the direction of Professor Nigel Shadbolt, annual credit card usage statements, collective purchasing schemes, and presentational work on Energy Performance Certificates, motor vehicle sales literature and food hygiene ratings, so that consumers can make better use of the information they contain.

===Customer empowerment===
Companies that empower their customers have the potential to create superior products at reduced costs and risks, provided that customers are willing and able to contribute valuable input in the new product development process. Businesses that involve and empower customers in the process of creating new products can sometimes have a competitive edge over traditional firms that do not give their customers such involvement. This advantage is evident in the fact that consumers generally prefer the former. When customers have the authority to choose which products are brought to market, they exhibit increased demand for the chosen products, even when they are objectively of the same quality. This apparently irrational phenomenon can be explained by the heightened sense of psychological ownership that consumers develop for the selected products. Two conditions limit this effect: (1) it diminishes when the joint decision-making outcome does not align with consumers&#x27; preferences and (2) when consumers lack confidence in their ability to make informed decisions.

===Increasingly engaged corporate directors===
The World Pensions Council (WPC) has argued that large institutional investors such as pension funds and endowments are exercising a greater influence on the process of adding and replacing corporate directors – as they are themselves steered to do so by their own board members (pension trustees).

This could eventually put more pressure on the CEOs of publicly listed companies, as “more than ever before, many [North American], UK and European Union pension trustees speak enthusiastically about flexing their fiduciary muscles for the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals”, and other ESG-centric investment practices 

==Legal==
Legal empowerment happens when marginalised people or groups use the legal mobilisation i.e., law, legal systems and justice mechanisms to improve or transform their social, political or economic situations. Legal empowerment approaches are interested in understanding how they can use the law to advance interests and priorities of the marginalised.

According to &#x27;Open society foundations&#x27; (an NGO) &quot;Legal empowerment is about strengthening the capacity of all people to exercise their rights, either as individuals or as members of a community. Legal empowerment is about grass root justice, about ensuring that law is not confined to books or courtrooms, but rather is available and meaningful to ordinary people.

Lorenzo Cotula in his book &#x27; &quot;Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control&quot; &#x27; outlines the fact that legal tools for securing local resource rights are enshrined in legal system, does not necessarily mean that local resource users are in position to use them and benefit from them. The state legal system is constrained by a range of different factors – from lack of resources to cultural issues. Among these factors economic, geographic, linguistic and other constraints on access to courts, &quot;lack of legal awareness as well as legal assistance &quot; tend to be recurrent problems.

In many context, marginalised groups do not trust the legal system owing to the widespread manipulation that it has historically been subjected to by the more powerful. &#x27;To what extent one knows the law, and make it work for themselves with &#x27;para legal tools&#x27;, is legal empowerment; assisted utilizing innovative approaches like legal literacy and awareness training, broadcasting legal information, conducting participatory legal discourses, supporting local resource user in negotiating with other agencies and stake holders and to strategies combining use of legal processes with advocacy along with media engagement, and socio legal mobilisation.

Sometimes groups are marginalized by society at large, with governments participating in the process of marginalization. Equal opportunity laws which actively oppose such marginalization, are supposed to allow empowerment to occur. These laws made it illegal to restrict access to schools and public places based on race. They can also be seen as a symptom of minorities&#x27; and women&#x27;s empowerment through lobbying.

==Gender==

Gender empowerment conventionally refers to the empowerment of women, which is a significant topic of discussion in regards to development and economics nowadays. It also points to approaches regarding other marginalized genders in a particular political or social context. This approach to empowerment is partly informed by feminism and employed legal empowerment by building on international human rights. Empowerment is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing human rights and development. The Human Development and Capabilities Approach, The Millennium Development Goals, and other credible approaches/goals point to empowerment and participation as a necessary step if a country is to overcome the obstacles associated with poverty and development. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 5) targets gender equality and women&#x27;s empowerment for the global development agenda. 

==In workplace management==
According to Thomas A. Potterfield, many organizational theorists and practitioners regard employee empowerment as one of the most important and popular management concepts of our time.

Ciulla discusses an inverse case: that of bogus empowerment.

===In management===
In the sphere of management and organizational theory, &quot;empowerment&quot; often refers loosely to processes for giving subordinates (or workers generally) greater discretion and resources: distributing control in order to better serve both customers and the interests of employing organizations. It also giving employees the authority to take initiatives, make their own decisions, find and execute solutions. 
Data from survey research using confirmatory factor analysis, empowerment can be captures through four dimensions, namely meaning, competence, self-determination, and impact; whereas some exploratory factor analysis identifies only three dimensions, namely meaning, competence, and influence (a conflation of self-determination and impact).

One account of the history of workplace empowerment in the United States recalls the clash of management styles in railroad construction in the American West in the mid-19th century, where &quot;traditional&quot; hierarchical East-Coast models of control encountered individualistic pioneer workers, strongly supplemented by methods of efficiency-oriented &quot;worker responsibility&quot; brought to the scene by Chinese laborers. In this case, empowerment at the level of work teams or brigades achieved a notable (but short-lived) demonstrated superiority. See the views of Robert L. Webb.

Since the 1980s and 1990s, empowerment has become a point of interest in management concepts and business administration. In this context, empowerment involves approaches that promise greater participation and integration to the employee in order to cope with their tasks as independently as possible and responsibly can. A strength-based approach known as &quot;empowerment circle&quot; has become an instrument of organizational development. Multidisciplinary empowerment teams aim for the development of quality circles to improve the organizational culture, strengthening the motivation and the skills of employees. The target of subjective job satisfaction of employees is pursued through flat hierarchies, participation in decisions, opening of creative effort, a positive, appreciative team culture, self-evaluation, taking responsibility (for results), more self-determination and constant further learning. The optimal use of existing potential and abilities can supposedly be better reached by satisfied and active workers. Here, knowledge management contributes significantly to implement employee participation as a guiding principle, for example through the creation of communities of practice.

However, it is important to ensure that the individual employee has the skills to meet their allocated responsibilities and that the company&#x27;s structure sets up the right incentives for employees to reward their taking responsibilities. Otherwise there is a danger of being overwhelmed or even becoming lethargic.

===Implications for company culture===
Empowerment of employees requires a culture of trust in the organization and an appropriate information and communication system. The aim of these activities is to save control costs, that become redundant when employees act independently and in a self-motivated fashion. 
In the book &quot;Empowerment Takes More Than a Minute&quot;, the authors illustrate three keys that organizations can use to open the knowledge, experience, and motivation power that people already have. The three keys that managers must use to empower their employees are:
# Share information with everyone
# Create autonomy through boundaries
# Replace the old hierarchy with self-directed work teams

According to Stewart, in order to guarantee a successful work environment, managers need to exercise the &quot;right kind of authority&quot; (p. 6). To summarize, &quot;empowerment is simply the effective use of a manager’s authority&quot;, and subsequently, it is a productive way to maximize all-around work efficiency.

These keys are hard to put into place and it is a journey to achieve empowerment in the workplace. It is important to train employees and makes sure they have trust in what empowerment will bring to a company.

The implementation of the concept of empowerment in management has also been criticized for failing to live up to its claims.

==In artificial intelligence==

Empowerment in the study of artificial intelligence is an information-theoretic quantity that measures the perceived capacity of an agent to influence its environment. Empowerment is an approach to modelling intrinsic motivation where advantageous actions are chosen by agent with just knowledge of the structure of the environment, rather than satisfying an externally imposed need as in homeostasis. 

Experiments have shown that artificial agents acting to maximise their empowerment, in the absence of a defined goal, exhibit advantageous exploratory behaviour that, in a range of simulated environments, resembles intelligent behaviour in living things.

==&quot;Age of Popular Empowerment&quot;==

Marshall McLuhan insisted that the development of electronic media would eventually weaken the hierarchical structures that underpin central governments, large corporation, academia and, more generally, rigid, “linear-Cartesian” forms of social organization. 
From that perspective, new, “electronic forms of awareness” driven by information technology would empower citizen, employees and students by disseminating in near-real-time vast amounts of information once reserved to a small number of experts and specialists. Citizens would be bound to ask for substantially more say in the management of government affairs, production, consumption, and education 

World Pensions Council (WPC) economist Nicolas Firzli has argued that rapidly rising cultural tides, notably new forms of online engagement and increased demands for ESG-driven public policies and managerial decisions are transforming the way governments and corporation interact with citizen-consumers in the “Age of Empowerment”

<doc id="167706" wikidata="Q5041066" url="?curid=167706" title="Carla Howell">
<text>Carla Howell (born 1955) is an American politician, small government advocate and activist. She was the Libertarian Party of Massachusetts candidate for Massachusetts State Auditor in 1998, U.S. Senate in 2000, and Governor in 2002. She then served in multiple leadership positions in the U.S. Libertarian Party. She has also organized tax-cut initiative ballot measures in Massachusetts and worked for the Libertarian National Committee.

== Early life and education ==
Howell is the daughter of Carla (Winsor) Howell and Charles Howell, the third of their five children. She is a great-granddaughter of William Eustis Russell, a former Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Her father worked as a business executive and her mother engaged in volunteer work in the community. As a result of her father&#x27;s work, the family moved from Massachusetts, and Howell attended high school in Detroit and Pittsburgh, graduating from Fox Chapel High School in Pittsburgh at age 16. 

Howell attended Bethany College in West Virginia for mathematics and computer science, and after graduating, became a systems engineer at Westinghouse Electric. In 1981, she began work at Computervision and became the head of an engineering division in 1984. After a decade of engineering work, she then became a consultant in the Boston area for the high-tech and health care industry.

Howell earned her MBA from Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts in 1986.

==Political career==
In 1994, Howell joined the Libertarian Party of Massachusetts and she was elected chair of the state party in 1997. In 1998, she ran for Massachusetts State Auditor on the Libertarian Party ticket, and was endorsed by the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;. She received 102,198 votes, 5.3 percent of the total, which according to the &quot;Associated Press&quot;, &quot;guarantee[d] the party&#x27;s official status.&quot;

In 2000, Howell was the Libertarian candidate for U.S. Senate in Massachusetts against Edward M. Kennedy. She ran with a &quot;Small government is beautiful&quot; campaign slogan, and by October, had raised almost $700,000, while the Republican candidate had raised about $20,000. She placed third, with more than 308,000 votes, which was 12 percent of the total and one percent behind the Republican candidate. In 2001, while reporting on the Massachusetts Libertarian Party convention, Rick Klein of the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; wrote the 2000 election &quot;made Howell the state party&#x27;s standard-bearer - and something of a hero to Bay State Libertarians&quot; and reported she received standing ovations before and after her speech to the attendees.

In 2002, Howell was the Libertarian candidate for Massachusetts Governor. At the time of her campaign, she was the chair of the Committee For Small Government. Her campaign platform included a plan to reduce the state budget by half, support for gun rights, and a repeal of the state income tax. She was excluded along with other minor candidates from a gubernatorial candidate debate, and their requests for an injunction were denied. She received 23,044 votes, more than 1 percent of the total.

By 2012, Howell was the executive director of the U.S. Libertarian Party. In 2016, she worked as the political director for the national party.

She was a staff member in the Libertarian National Committee from December 2011 until June 2017.

== Ballot initiatives ==
Howell spearheaded initiatives to repeal the Massachusetts state personal income tax in 2002 and 2008. In 2002, she sponsored 2002 Statewide Ballot Question 1, an initiative petition to end the income tax in Massachusetts. The measure received 45% of the vote, which Peter DeMarco, writing for the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, described as &quot;eye-popping&quot;.

In 2007, Howell and co-chair Michael Cloud, re-established the Committee For Small Government. The Committee obtained enough petition signatures to put the issue on the ballot as Statewide Ballot Question 1. The 2008 initiative differed from the 2002 initiative in that it provided a one-year transition period with a tax rate of 2.65% before the tax rate would drop to zero. This measure received a higher vote total than in 2002, but lost with 30% of the vote.

In 2010, Howell filed four petitions to create ballot measures to reduce sales taxes, and Republican Christy Mihos, who was running for Massachusetts governor at the time, also sponsored the initiatives. Howell headed the Alliance to Roll Back Taxes, sponsor of a ballot initiative to cut the Massachusetts sales tax from 6.25% to 3.0%, which was on November 2, 2010, ballot as Question 3. Her group collected and submitted 74,131 approved voter signatures in the fall of 2009, and another 14,023 signatures in the spring-summer of 2010 to qualify the measure. The measure reached as high as 56% in the polls but was unsuccessful.

<text>Japan were an English new wave band formed in 1974 in Catford, South London by David Sylvian (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Steve Jansen (drums) and Mick Karn (bass guitar), joined the following year by Richard Barbieri (keyboards) and Rob Dean (lead guitar). Initially a glam rock-inspired band, Japan developed their sound and androgynous look to incorporate art rock, electronic music and foreign influences.

Japan achieved success in the late 1970s and early 1980s, releasing nine UK top 40 hits, including the 1982 top 5 hit single &quot;Ghosts&quot;, and scoring a UK top 5 with the live album &quot;Oil on Canvas&quot; (1983). Six of the band&#x27;s albums have achieved Gold status in the UK. The band split in December 1982, just as they were beginning to experience commercial success in the UK and abroad. Its members went on to pursue other musical projects, though they reformed briefly in the early 1990s under the name Rain Tree Crow, releasing an album in 1991.

==History==
The band began as a group of friends in the early 1970s. Brothers (birth surname Batt) David Sylvian (guitar and vocals) and Steve Jansen (drums), and bassist Mick Karn studied at the same school, Catford Boys&#x27;, Brownhill Road, South London. As youngsters they played Sylvian&#x27;s two-chord numbers mainly as a means of escape; initially with Karn on lead vocals and Sylvian on guitar and backing vocals, Sylvian became lead vocalist in 1974. In June 1974, they made their first public performance at Karn&#x27;s brother&#x27;s wedding reception.

The band was initially nameless until the members opted to call themselves Japan. This name was intended by Sylvian to be temporary until they could think of something else, but ultimately became permanent. The following year they were joined by another school friend Richard Barbieri on keyboards and later by lead guitarist Rob Dean, and signed a management deal with Simon Napier-Bell (who also managed the Yardbirds, Marc Bolan, London and Wham!) in 1976. After coming runner up to the Cure in a talent contest staged by Hansa Records the band signed a recording contract with Hansa-Ariola in 1977, becoming an alternative glam rock outfit in the mould of Lou Reed, David Bowie, T. Rex, Roxy Music, and New York Dolls, although their initial material was guitar-based funk.

Shortly after signing the record deal Sylvian, Jansen and Karn adopted their stage names. Initially, the record company was horrified by the apparent similarity of Sylvian&#x27;s and Jansen&#x27;s names to the names of band members of the New York Dolls, but eventually accepted the name changes. In 1977, the band embarked on their first recording session for the record company with producer Ray Singer and performed as support band for Jim Capaldi and the Contenders on a UK tour.

===Early years===
In March 1978, the band released their first single, a cover version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Rain on My Parade&quot; followed a month later by their debut album &quot;Adolescent Sex&quot;. Advertising campaigns that focused on the band&#x27;s androgynous glam rock image failed to attract much interest for the band in the UK but was more successful in Japan where the band attracted a considerable fan following before a record had been released.

The debut album was followed by a UK tour supporting Blue Öyster Cult, intended to promote their album. The album itself sold poorly, and Japan faced negative criticism and hostile audiences. In August 1978 their second single, &quot;The Unconventional,&quot; failed to chart. In November the band made a short US tour, but although they were better accepted by American audiences it proved to be their last and only US tour. The follow-up album &quot;Obscure Alternatives&quot; showed musical progress and particularly the last track &quot;The Tenant&quot; – which has been described as a fusion of &quot;Low&quot;-era David Bowie and the piano works of Erik Satie – was a hint of the band&#x27;s future, but again the album was a commercial and critical flop.

Though influenced by artists such as Lou Reed, T. Rex, New York Dolls, Roxy Music and David Bowie, both albums were widely dismissed by the UK music press as being distinctly outmoded at a time when punk and new wave bands were in ascendance. However, both albums, produced by Ray Singer, sold well in Japan and the Netherlands, where the single version of &quot;Adolescent Sex&quot; was a top 30 hit. They also gained some popularity in Canada. But in their native UK, those albums failed to garner public attention and did not chart.

While unsuccessful in their home country, the band gained a huge popularity in Japan. They were voted the second most popular group in Japan in 1978, and was on top of the list the following year. In March 1979, they made their first visit to the country and sold out the 11,000 seat capacity Budokan Theatre three days in a row.

===Mid-career===
In 1979, the band briefly worked with the successful Euro disco producer Giorgio Moroder, who co-wrote and produced a one-off single, &quot;Life in Tokyo&quot;. The track was unsuccessful as a single but a significant change in musical style from their earlier guitar-laden recordings, moving them away from their glam rock roots and into electronic new wave.

The electronic style continued on their third album, &quot;Quiet Life&quot; (1979), which was produced by the band with John Punter and Simon Napier-Bell. In a retrospective review of the band&#x27;s work, &quot;The Quietus&quot; described &quot;Quiet Life&quot; as defining &quot;a very European form of detached, sexually-ambiguous and thoughtful art-pop, one not too dissimilar to what the ever-prescient David Bowie had delivered two years earlier with &quot;Low&quot;&quot;. It showcased Barbieri&#x27;s synthesizers, Sylvian&#x27;s now baritone style of singing, Karn&#x27;s distinctive fretless bass sound and Jansen&#x27;s odd-timbred and intricate percussion work, with Dean&#x27;s guitar playing becoming somewhat sparser and atmospheric. While largely ignored in their home country, &quot;Quiet Life&quot; was a success in Japan, where it had the distinction of becoming the first foreign rock record to enter the national chart, and went straight in at number 8 in Canada, and also had some success in continental Europe.

In the UK, &quot;Quiet Life&quot; was the first Japan album to reach the UK Albums Chart, but it wasn&#x27;t a success on its initial release. It peaked at a lowly 72 in February 1980 and dropped out of the chart the following week. The band had for long been a financial strain on their record company and management, and after a final attempt to score a hit single that would boost the sales of the album with a cover version of &quot;I Second That Emotion&quot; was unsuccessful, Japan was dropped by Hansa Records.

Hansa-Ariola would later issue a compilation album (&quot;Assemblage&quot;) featuring highlights from the band&#x27;s tenure on the label, followed by a series of remixed and re-released singles.

===Final years===
After leaving Hansa-Ariola, the band signed with Virgin Records who released their last studio albums, &quot;Gentlemen Take Polaroids&quot; (1980) and &quot;Tin Drum&quot; (1981). The albums continued to expand their audience as the band refined its new sound, although the combination of their newer sound and the band&#x27;s stylised visual appearance led to them unintentionally becoming associated with the early-1980s New Romantic scene. The band had always worn make-up since their inception in the mid-1970s at the tail end of the glam rock era, several years before the New Romantic movement had begun. In an October 1981 interview, Sylvian commented &quot;There&#x27;s a period going past at the moment that may make us look as though we&#x27;re in fashion.&quot; In another interview, he stated &quot;I don&#x27;t like to be associated with them [New Romantics]. The attitudes are so very different.&quot; Of Japan&#x27;s fashion sense, Sylvian said &quot;For them [New Romantics], fancy dress is a costume. But ours is a way of life. We look and dress this way every day.&quot; Regardless, it had a positive effect on the band&#x27;s record sales in the UK and they slowly began to gain chart success.

After a couple of lower charting singles, their first UK top 40 hit was a re-release of the &quot;Quiet Life&quot; single, which peaked at No. 19 in October 1981. Three of the singles from the &quot;Tin Drum&quot; album also peaked in the UK top 40, with its unconventional single &quot;Ghosts&quot; reaching No. 5, becoming Japan&#x27;s biggest domestic hit. The &quot;Tin Drum&quot; album itself peaked just outside the UK top 10, and was the band&#x27;s first record to be certified by the BPI, being awarded a silver disc within a month of release, and reaching gold status within four months. The album, produced by Steve Nye, is often regarded as one of the most innovative of the 1980s, with its fusion of occidental and oriental sounds. In 2011, thirty years after its release, &quot;Tin Drum&quot; was awarded BBC Radio 6 Music&#x27;s &#x27;Goldie Award&#x27; posthumously for the Best Album of 1981.

With personality conflicts leading to rising tensions within the band, &quot;Tin Drum&quot; was to be the band&#x27;s final studio album. Long-simmering differences among the band members came to a head when Karn&#x27;s girlfriend, photographer Yuka Fujii, moved in with Sylvian and the individual members proceeded with their own projects. Rob Dean had already departed (in May 1981) after the release of the &quot;Gentlemen Take Polaroids&quot; album, as his electric guitar work became superfluous for the band&#x27;s sound on &quot;Tin Drum&quot;. Dean subsequently formed the band Illustrated Man. Karn released his first solo album, &quot;Titles&quot;, at the same time the band announced their split in late 1982.

The final &quot;Sons of Pioneers&quot; tour in late 1982 included dates in Europe, UK and the Far East. On this tour, guitarist and keyboardist Masami Tsuchiya performed with the band on stage.
The group&#x27;s final UK performances included a final TV appearance playing together on &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; in October and culminating in a six-night sell-out stint at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Odeon in November (which would be recorded and filmed to produce &quot;Oil on Canvas&quot;, a live album and video released in June 1983). Japan&#x27;s last performance was on 16 December 1982 in Nagoya, Japan.

The band decided to split just as they were beginning to achieve major commercial success both in the UK and internationally, with &quot;Oil on Canvas&quot; becoming their highest charting UK album, reaching No. 5 on the UK Albums Chart, a rare feat for a live album. By this time, the band&#x27;s back catalogue had begun to sell steadily and both Hansa-Ariola and Virgin Records continued to release Japan singles into 1983, ultimately earning the band a total of nine top 40 hits in the UK. In summer 1982, a Hansa re-release of &quot;I Second That Emotion&quot; became Japan&#x27;s second top 10 hit, reaching number 9. A remixed version of &quot;Life in Tokyo&quot; and a Virgin Records release of &quot;Nightporter&quot; were subsequently both top 30 hits on the UK Singles Chart.

=== Collaborations ===
During the early 1980s, Japanese multi-instrumentalist and experimental keyboardist Ryuichi Sakamoto, of Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO), briefly collaborated with the band, and worked directly alongside Sylvian on tracks such as &quot;Taking Islands in Africa&quot;. He would continue to work with Sylvian both before and after the band split, and the pair would achieve the hit singles &quot;Bamboo Houses&quot; (1982) and &quot;Forbidden Colours&quot; (1983). Similarly, Steve Jansen was influenced by YMO&#x27;s drummer Yukihiro Takahashi, subsequently joining him on several of Takahashi&#x27;s solo projects and tours of Japan, along with additional full collaborative works between the two.

===Post break-up===
All of the band members went on to work on other projects, with varying degrees of success. After his collaborations with Sakamoto, Sylvian&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Brilliant Trees&quot; reached No. 4 on the UK Albums Chart in 1984, spawning the UK top 20 single &quot;Red Guitar&quot;. Meanwhile, Karn had already become a sought-after session musician and worked with artists such as Gary Numan, Kate Bush, and Joan Armatrading. He also had a top 40 hit (&quot;After a Fashion&quot;) with Midge Ure in 1983, and collaborated with Peter Murphy of Bauhaus as the duo Dalis Car, releasing an album in 1984. Jansen and Barbieri worked together as the Dolphin Brothers and simply as Jansen &amp; Barbieri (&quot;Stories Across Borders&quot;, 1991, Virgin), and Rob Dean went on to work with Gary Numan and Sinéad O&#x27;Connor and also later played guitars in Australian band Geisha from late 1987 to April 1988.

====Rain Tree Crow====
In September 1989, Sylvian, Karn, Jansen and Barbieri reunited under the moniker &#x27;Rain Tree Crow&#x27;. They released an eponymously titled album in April 1991, which was well received by music critics and reached the UK top 25. However, once again, the band dissolved following creative frictions between Sylvian and the other members.

====Other projects====
Medium Productions was a record label created in 1993 primarily to publish the music of Steve Jansen, Richard Barbieri, and Mick Karn. Medium was a means to release their own music with other collaborating artists, without &#x27;major record label&#x27; compromise. Fifteen CDs of largely instrumental music were produced over a ten-year period. Medium Productions folded in 2004 as the founders became more involved in other projects (such as Porcupine Tree, Nine Horses). The entire MP catalog has been re-released on the Voiceprint Music label beginning in 2001.

Richard Barbieri moved on to become the keyboardist for progressive rock band Porcupine Tree, a role he has filled since 1995&#x27;s &quot;The Sky Moves Sideways&quot;. Although band members would work with each other again on various individual projects (including Sylvian and Jansen&#x27;s Nine Horses project), no further full Japan reunions were planned in any form.

Throughout the 1990s Karn, Jansen and Barbieri reunited in instrumental projects with different guitarists such as David Torn and Steven Wilson.

Twenty years after their reunion as Rain Tree Crow, Mick Karn died from cancer in January 2011.

===Remasters===
In 2003, Virgin Records re-issued remastered editions of &quot;Gentlemen Take Polaroids&quot;, &quot;Tin Drum&quot; and &quot;Oil on Canvas&quot;. BMG followed suit next year, and re-issued &quot;Adolescent Sex&quot;, &quot;Obscure Alternatives&quot;, &quot;Quiet Life&quot;, and &quot;Assemblage&quot;. All of these re-releases came in the &#x27;digipak&#x27; format, collecting many bonus tracks. In 2006, all were repackaged in jewel cases to allow sale at a lower price point.

The &quot;Tin Drum&quot; digipak re-issue was of particular interest as it was packaged in a cardboard box and contained the bonus 5-inch single &quot;The Art of Parties&quot;, which comprised &quot;The Art of Parties&quot; (12&quot; single and live versions), &quot;Ghosts&quot; (single version) and &quot;Life Without Buildings&quot; (B-side to &quot;The Art of Parties&quot; single). The package also included a booklet with black-and-white photos of the band members.

Half-speed mastered 45 rpm double vinyl LP editions of &quot;Gentlemen Take Polaroids&quot; and &quot;Tin Drum&quot; were issued in August 2018. Both albums were remastered at Abbey Road Studios by Miles Showell. A single disc 33 rpm edition of both albums was also made available. The albums entered the Official Vinyl Charts at numbers 2 and 3 respectively in the first week of sales.

In March 2021, the &quot;Quiet Life&quot; album was reissued by BMG in several deluxe formats, including a boxset (featuring three CDs with a 180g half-speed mastered vinyl), a couple of separate vinyl editions, and a CD release. The release returned Japan to the UK Top 20 for the first time since 1983, peaking at no.13 on the UK Album Chart and no.2 on the UK Vinyl chart.

<doc id="167710" wikidata="Q5335489" url="?curid=167710" title="Ed Thompson (Wisconsin politician)">
<text>Allan Edward Thompson (December 25, 1944 – October 22, 2011) was an American businessman and politician. He served as Mayor of Tomah, Wisconsin for two non-consecutive terms, and was the Libertarian candidate for Governor of Wisconsin in 2002, receiving nearly 11% of the vote in that race. His older brother, Tommy Thompson, was the 42nd governor of Wisconsin.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Thompson was born in Elroy, Wisconsin. His mother, Julie (née Dutton), was a teacher, and his father, Allan Thompson, owned and ran a gas station and country grocery store. A graduate of Royall High School in 1963, he was active in the drama department and competed in football, basketball, and track. Ed was the younger brother of Tommy Thompson. After high school, Ed briefly attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison before enlisting in the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam War. After being honorably discharged from the Navy, he married Kathy Nelson; the couple settled in Elroy and had four children: Ann Marie, Kristin Beth, Allan Edward “Chip” Thompson, and Joshua Thompson.

Thompson was the owner of the Tee-Pee supper club, a restaurant in Tomah, and was the subject of the documentary &quot;A Remarkable Man&quot;. His older brother, Tommy Thompson, a Republican, was formerly Governor of Wisconsin and United States Secretary of Health and Human Services.

==Political experience==

===Tomah politics===
In 2000, he defeated incumbent mayor Bud Johnson with 57% of the vote. He served only one two-year term.

On April 5, 2005, Thompson won an unexpected victory in the common council election in Tomah. Thompson was not running for the position but was, unknown to him, the subject of a write-in campaign. He received 31 of 34 votes. His &quot;opponent&quot;, John Buick, received one vote from Thompson himself. Thompson initially declined to accept the position, but later reconsidered. He was sworn in on April 15, 2005, and served two years on the Tomah common council.

In 2008, Thompson took the place of outgoing mayor Ludeking, whom he defeated in the mayoral election on April 1 by nearly a 2–1 margin. Thompson was sworn into office for his second (non-consecutive) two-year term as mayor of Tomah on April 15, 2008.

===2002 gubernatorial campaign===

Thompson became the Libertarian party nominee in April and ran against Democrat Jim Doyle, the state Attorney General, and incumbent Republican Governor Scott McCallum, the former Lieutenant Governor who had assumed the office in 2001 after Governor Tommy Thompson left to become U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services.

The 2002 governor&#x27;s race is considered by some to have been the most negative campaign in the state&#x27;s history. In response Thompson, publicly critical of the negative campaigning of both major party candidates, became a more viable option for some voters, and garnered 10% of the vote. Doyle won the election with a plurality of 45% of the vote, becoming the state&#x27;s first Democratic governor since Anthony Earl was defeated in 1986. Doyle was sworn in on January 6, 2003 at the State Capitol in Madison.

===2010 State Senate campaign===
Thompson announced in October 2009 that he would run as a Republican for the 31st district Wisconsin State Senate seat in 2010, against incumbent Kathleen Vinehout. The 31st District included all of Trempealeau, Buffalo, Jackson and Pepin counties, and parts of Monroe, Pierce, Dunn, Eau Claire and Clark counties. On November 2, 2010, Vinehout defeated Thompson, who was still campaigning for the office, despite being recently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in September 2010. On November 9, 2010, he requested a recount with only 352 votes separating Thompson from Vinehout. On November 19, 2010, he conceded the election to Vinehout.

===Death===
Thompson died of pancreatic cancer on October 22, 2011, in Tomah.

<doc id="167717" wikidata="Q1126301" url="?curid=167717" title="The Jesus and Mary Chain">
<text>The Jesus and Mary Chain are a Scottish alternative rock band formed in East Kilbride in 1983. The band revolves around the songwriting partnership of brothers Jim and William Reid, who are the two founders and only consistent members of the band since its formation. They are recognized as key figures in the development of the shoegaze and noise pop subgenres. The band have had twelve top 40 entries and two top 10 hits in the UK Singles Chart in the course of their career.

The Reid brothers recruited Douglas Hart on bass and Murray Dalglish on drums as their initial lineup. After signing to the independent label Creation Records, they released their first single &quot;Upside Down&quot; in 1984. Bobby Gillespie replaced Dalglish on drums, and their debut album &quot;Psychocandy&quot; was released to critical acclaim in 1985 on the major label WEA. After its release, Gillespie left the band to work on his own band Primal Scream. The band&#x27;s biggest commercial success domestically was their second album &quot;Darklands&quot;, which reached No. 5 on the UK Albums Chart in 1987 and spawned the hit single &quot;April Skies&quot;, peaking at No. 8 in the UK. It was the band&#x27;s only top ten album. The band released their third album &quot;Automatic&quot; in 1989, which spawned their first charting singles in the US, &quot;Blues from a Gun&quot; and &quot;Head On&quot;, which were heavily played on alternative rock radio stations. Hart departed from the band two years later.

The Jesus and Mary Chain then released the albums &quot;Honey&#x27;s Dead&quot; in 1992 and &quot;Stoned &amp; Dethroned&quot; in 1994, both of which continued their popularity in the US. &quot;Sometimes Always&quot;, taken from &quot;Stoned &amp; Dethroned&quot;, became the band&#x27;s most commercially successful single in the US as it peaked at No. 94 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The band departed from WEA after ten years, and then signed with Sub Pop Records in the US and re-signed with Creation Records in the UK for the release of the album &quot;Munki&quot; in 1998. The band broke up the following year as a result of an onstage altercation the year prior; William Reid prematurely left a tour after fighting with an intoxicated Jim Reid. They eventually reunited in 2007, and in 2017, they released &quot;Damage and Joy&quot;, their first studio album in 19 years and seventh overall. Their next album, &quot;Glasgow Eyes,&quot; was released in 2024 and became the band&#x27;s first top 10 album in the UK since 1988.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Brothers Jim and William Reid formed a band in the early 1980s in response to their distaste of the music at the time, saying, &quot;It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band&quot;. This worked in their favor, as William said, &quot;It was perfect timing because there weren&#x27;t any guitar bands. Everybody was making this electronic pop music.&quot; Before forming the band, the brothers had spent five years on the dole, during which they wrote and recorded songs at home and worked out the sound and image of the band. Originally called The Poppy Seeds, and then Death of Joey, they initially told journalists that they had taken their eventual name from a line in a Bing Crosby film, although six months later they admitted that this was not true. Other accounts suggest that the name derived from an offer on a breakfast cereal packet, where customers could send off for a gold Jesus &amp; Mary chain. As neither brother wanted to be the singer, they decided on Jim via coin toss.

The brothers started recording and sending demos to record companies in 1983 (using a Portastudio bought with £300 given to them by their father from redundancy pay after he lost his factory job), and by early 1984 they had recruited bass player Douglas Hart and teenage drummer Murray Dalglish. Early influences included the Velvet Underground, the Stooges, New York Dolls, Suicide, and The Shangri-Las. William said in 1985, &quot;We all love The Shangri-Las, and one day we&#x27;re going to make Shangri-Las records.&quot; Jim mentioned his liking for Pink Floyd, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Monkees, Einstürzende Neubauten, and Muddy Waters. Early demos displayed a similarity to the Ramones, prompting the brothers to add another element to their sound; in William&#x27;s words: &quot;That&#x27;s why we started using noise and feedback. We want to make records that sound different.&quot; They began playing live in early 1984. In the early days William Reid&#x27;s guitar would be left out of tune, while Dalglish&#x27;s drum kit was limited to two drums, and Hart&#x27;s bass guitar only had three strings, down to two by 1985; in Hart&#x27;s words, &quot;That&#x27;s the two I use. I mean what&#x27;s the fucking point spending money on another two? Two is enough.&quot;

Struggling to get gigs, the band took to turning up at venues claiming to be the support band, playing their short set and making a quick exit. After failing to generate any interest from concert promoters and record labels in Scotland, the band relocated to Fulham, London, in May 1984, and soon afterwards their demo tape was passed to fellow Scot Alan McGee by Bobby Gillespie. Subsequently, McGee promoted a gig for the band at the Living Room in London in June 1984. On the strength of hearing the band sound check, McGee signed them to his Creation Records label on a one-off deal, and McGee also became the band&#x27;s manager. Their debut single, &quot;Upside Down&quot;, was recorded in October and released in November that year. The sessions were produced by Joe Foster, but McGee, unsatisfied with Foster&#x27;s work, remixed the A-side, although the B-side, a cover version of Syd Barrett&#x27;s &quot;Vegetable Man&quot;, remained credited to Foster. The band were gaining increasing attention from the music press at this time with Neil Taylor of the &quot;NME&quot; describing them as &quot;the best band in the world&quot;.

Dalglish left in November 1984 after a dispute over money and was replaced shortly afterwards by Gillespie who had also formed Primal Scream two years earlier in 1982. &quot;Upside Down&quot; topped the UK Indie Chart in February 1985 and then again in March and stayed on the chart for 76 weeks, selling around 35,000 copies in total, making it one of the biggest-selling indie singles of the 1980s.

Playing in front of small audiences, during early shows the Mary Chain performed very short gigs, typically fueled by amphetamines and lasting around 20 minutes, and played with their backs to the audience, refusing to speak to them. In late December 1984, the band performed as part of the ICA Rock Week. During their performance, bottles were thrown on stage, with press reports exaggerating events and claiming that there had been a riot, and national newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot; running a story on the band concentrating on violence and drugs, the band attracting the tag &quot;The new Sex Pistols&quot;. That led several local councils to ban the band from performing in their area.

===&quot;Psychocandy&quot;===

The success of &quot;Upside Down&quot; led to interest from WEA-subsidiary Blanco y Negro Records which signed the group in early 1985. The group released the single &quot;Never Understand&quot; in February which reached number forty-seven on the UK Singles Chart. The label had initially refused to press the single due to its B-side, &quot;Suck&quot;, but went ahead given the alternative put forward by the band, a song called &quot;Jesus Fuck&quot;. The band were eager to get &quot;Jesus Fuck&quot; released, and McGee got as far as producing test pressings of a re-issue of &quot;Upside Down&quot; with the song on the B-side, before the band insisted that Blanco y Negro include the track on their next single. The follow-up, &quot;You Trip Me Up&quot;, was delayed due to staff at the pressing plant refusing to press it due to the presence of the song, now re-titled &quot;Jesus Suck&quot;; The single was released in June 1985 with a new B-side, &quot;Just Out of Reach&quot;. John Peel got the band to record a second session for his BBC Radio 1 show in February 1985 (the first was only a few months earlier), and the band also made a TV appearance on &quot;Whistle Test&quot; in March and &quot;The Tube&quot; the same year. The third single for Blanco y Negro, &quot;Just Like Honey&quot;, released in October, was their biggest hit to date, reaching No. 45.

Eager to avoid the violence of earlier gigs and to give an opportunity for their songs to be heard without distortion and feedback, the band planned to perform several unannounced acoustic sets supporting Sonic Youth, but this was abandoned when the plans were leaked. Their debut album &quot;Psychocandy&quot; followed in November that year. The album fused together the Reids&#x27; two primary influences: the guitar noise of the Stooges and the Velvet Underground with the pop songwriting and melodies of the Beach Boys, The Shangri-Las and Phil Spector; In fact, the album&#x27;s opening song, &quot;Just Like Honey,&quot; borrows Hal Blaine&#x27;s famous drum intro from The Ronettes 1963 classic, &quot;Be My Baby&quot;, produced and co-written by Spector. The record received unanimously positive reviews and is now considered a landmark recording. Drummer Gillespie announced his departure from the band in October 1985, to concentrate on Primal Scream. He had recorded most of the drums on &quot;Psychocandy&quot;, with John Moore filling in when Gillespie was unavailable, eventually joining the band to replace him. John Loder also acted as a stand-in drummer when Gillespie was unavailable for live performances.

When the band signed to Blanco y Negro in January 1985, there were stories reporting that they had stolen money from managing Director Rob Dickens&#x27;s jacket and destroyed his office, all untrue but seen as good publicity by manager McGee. In a performance on Belgian television in March 1985, the band did smash the set and the audio equipment, but this was at the request of the TV producer. Such behaviour became expected of the band and many shows culminated with the Reids trashing their equipment, which was often followed by the audience throwing projectiles onto the stage and damaging equipment.

On 15 March 1985, the Jesus and Mary Chain played a gig at the North London Polytechnic in front of one of their largest crowds up to that point. The organizers had overbooked the venue, leaving hundreds of fans locked outside. When Gillespie and Hart attempted to break the locks, the police were called. Support band Meat Whiplash had stirred up violence before the Mary Chain set foot onto the stage when singer Paul McDermott threw an empty wine bottle into the audience, prompting four members of the crowd to attack him, leading to their set being abandoned. Second act The Jasmine Minks got through their set without incident, but The Jesus and Mary Chain then kept the audience waiting for over an hour before taking the stage, and then left the stage after playing for less than twenty minutes. Members of the audience began throwing cans at where the band were hiding behind the stage curtains, before mounting the stage to smash the equipment that remained there. The violence continued for some time before police eventually took control. The venue blamed the band&#x27;s late appearance and two equipment breakdowns, while McGee issued a statement saying that &quot;the audience were not smashing up the hall, they were smashing up pop music&quot;, going on to say &quot;This is truly art as terrorism&quot;. The violence soon started to become a hindrance to the band, with people attending concerts simply for the violence rather than the music, William commenting &quot;I hate it, I despise it. It gets in the way in terms of getting more gigs, and it gets in the way of our image&quot;. Many performances were cancelled during the remainder of 1985, with promoters or local councils not prepared to risk a riot. The violence flared up again at a performance at the Electric Ballroom in Camden Town in September, with bottles thrown at the band while they played, and a section of the audience smashing up the amplification equipment and smashing the lights afterwards, with several people injured by flying glass. A major factor in the audience reaction was the length of the band&#x27;s sets at the time, which lasted less than twenty-five minutes, Jim explaining this with &quot;there&#x27;s never been a group good enough to play any longer&quot;. Lack of songs was also a factor, according to Jim: &quot;We&#x27;ve only got enough songs to play for that long&quot;.

After the success of the album in the UK, the band embarked on a tour of the United States in late 1985 and 1986, followed by a tour of Japan. On returning to the UK they toured the UK, this time without the trouble that had marred earlier performances. The band revived their acoustic intentions with a stripped-down session for John Peel in November 1985, which included &quot;Psychocandy&quot;, the original album title track that was omitted from the release, and &quot;Some Candy Talking&quot;, a song which they had been performing for over a year, but had been left off the album. A second version of &quot;Some Candy Talking&quot; was issued on a free EP issued with the &quot;NME&quot; in January 1986, and the song was released as the band&#x27;s next single in July. It reached number thirteen in the UK Singles Chart, but attracted controversy when BBC Radio 1 DJ Mike Smith decided that the song was a paean to illegal drugs (denied by the band at the time, but admitted by William a year later) and convinced the station to ban it from being played.

===&quot;Darklands&quot; and &quot;Automatic&quot;===
In September 1986, the band parted ways with manager Alan McGee, and came close to splitting up later in the year, with Jim Reid suffering from &quot;exhaustion&quot;. John Moore had become an established member, but moved to rhythm guitar, with former Redskins member Martin Hewes joining the band briefly (although he strongly denies ever joining) and former Dead Can Dance percussionist James Pinker taking over on drums. Blanco y Negro manager Geoff Travis took over management duties, and the band returned in December with two gigs at the National Ballroom in Kilburn, London where they premiered new songs including &quot;April Skies&quot; and &quot;Hit&quot;. Early in 1987, they entered the studio to record their second album. The first fruits of these sessions were released on the &quot;April Skies&quot; single in April, which saw the band have their first top ten hit. The Beach Boys influence was evident on the B-side, which included &quot;Kill Surf City&quot;, a reworking of Brian Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Surf City&quot;. The various formats released also included a cover of Bo Diddley&#x27;s &quot;Who Do You Love?&quot;, a tribute to him with &quot;Bo Diddley is Jesus&quot;, and a live version of Can&#x27;s &quot;Mushroom&quot;. &quot;Happy When It Rains&quot; was the second pre-album single, strongly influenced by Smokey Robinson&#x27;s &quot;My Girl&quot;, but it failed to match the success of &quot;April Skies&quot;, only reaching number twenty-five. The band set out on another UK tour, this time with sets stretching to 45 minutes, although to a mixed reaction from the music press. They toured without a drummer, instead using a drum machine.

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Darklands&quot;, was released during the tour, in September, described by writer Steve Taylor as &quot;the definitive blend of light and shade&quot;. Featuring a more melodic sound, the album was recorded almost entirely by the Reids themselves, replacing live drums with a drum machine, and received overwhelmingly positive reviews by the British music press. The album&#x27;s title track was released as a single in October, and the band were thrown off the ITV music show &quot;The Roxy&quot; when they failed to mime well enough to it.

The band&#x27;s dangerous reputation culminated at a gig at the RPM club in Toronto in November 1987, when after being heckled throughout the gig by a group in the audience, Jim Reid thrust his microphone stand towards them, hitting one on the head. Jim was arrested and spent a night in jail, before being bailed to return the following February. He was subsequently given an absolute discharge after agreeing to give around £500 to a Salvation Army charity and apologise to the complainant.

With the court case hanging over the band, they compiled a collection of B-sides and rarities for release in April 1988 as &quot;Barbed Wire Kisses&quot;. They also selected live tracks from a Detroit concert the previous November for release while they planned further studio work. Dave Evans, former Mary Chain soundman and bass player with Biff Bang Pow! (which also featured Alan McGee and Dick Green of Creation Records) was recruited in September 1987 to replace Moore, who formed John Moore and the Expressway. Richard Thomas joined on drums in early 1988. The band had been using drum tapes on tour before Thomas. Their next release was the new recording &quot;Sidewalking&quot;, released in March 1988, and backed by some of the live tracks, followed a month later by &quot;Barbed Wire Kisses&quot;. Later that year, they did a remix for the single &quot;Birthday&quot; by The Sugarcubes.

In September 1989, The band provided backing vocals for the Erasure single &quot;Drama!&quot;.

The band&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Automatic&quot; was released in October 1989, by which time Evans had been replaced by Ben Lurie. Boasting heavy use of synthesized bass and keyboards, the album was not received quite as well as its predecessors. It contained the singles &quot;Head On&quot; and &quot;Blues from a Gun&quot;. By this time, the violence that was originally associated with the band was practically non-existent and the Reid brothers were less antagonistic and aggressive in general. The &quot;Rollercoaster&quot; EP (August 1990) would be their last release for over a year, the band undertaking a tour of the same name with My Bloody Valentine, Dinosaur Jr., and Blur.

===The 1990s===
Douglas Hart had moonlighted with the Acid Angels in 1988, and left the band in 1991, to have a career in film making, before picking up his bass again in 2006, playing with the Sian Alice Group, Le Volume Courbe, and Cristine. Thomas also quit the band to join Renegade Soundwave. The fluid nature of the Mary Chain&#x27;s line up continued throughout their entire career, with a revolving door of drummers, bassists and guitarists being recruited for TV appearances and gigs whenever they were required, the only constants being the Reid brothers. The Reid brothers recruited former Starlings rhythm section Matthew Parkin and Barry Blackler to replace Hart and Thomas.

The brothers bought their own recording studio in 1991 in Elephant &amp; Castle in South London, which they dubbed &quot;The Drugstore&quot;, and they returned in February 1992 with the first fruits of the new studio, their next single, &quot;Reverence&quot;, which gave them their biggest hit single in almost five years, reaching No. 10 in the UK. Spitting feedback and punk rock bile in every direction, the track was banned from being played on BBC Radio 1 and from &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, due to its potentially offensive lyrics (&#x27;I wanna die just like JFK, I wanna die in the USA&#x27;...&#x27;I wanna die just like Jesus Christ, I wanna die on a bed of spikes&#x27;). The single was followed by the release of the album &quot;Honey&#x27;s Dead&quot; (1992), which received mixed reviews. After the Rollercoaster Tour to support the album, the band concentrated on cracking the United States&#x27; market, with an appearance on David Letterman&#x27;s show, and a tour as part of the Lollapalooza line-up, which William later described as &quot;the worst experience of our lives,&quot; followed by their own headlining tour. In December 1992, the Reids again lost their rhythm section, with Ben Lurie returning and Steve Monti joining on drums. Another compilation was released in 1993, &quot;The Sound of Speed&quot;, before they returned to the studio to record their fifth album proper, &quot;Stoned &amp; Dethroned&quot; which would see release in 1994, and featured guest appearances from Shane MacGowan and William&#x27;s then-girlfriend Hope Sandoval. The album was originally planned as an acoustic album, but this idea was abandoned because, in Jim&#x27;s words, &quot;We couldn&#x27;t do enough interesting things with acoustic guitars to make an album&quot;. In the 1995 EP released under American Records, a number of new works and B-sides were published which were later collected in the album &quot;Munki&quot;.

After the release of the 1995 compilation &quot;Hate Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll&quot;, the Mary Chain parted ways with Blanco y Negro, their record label of over a decade, and re-signed to their original label Creation Records, and Sub Pop in America. The band now included former Lush bassist Phil King. They then recorded 1998&#x27;s &quot;Munki&quot; album, which would turn out to be their last before splitting the following year. &quot;Munki&quot; was commercially the least successful album the band released, peaking at number forty-seven in the UK Album Chart. The album featured the Reids&#x27; sister Linda, who sang on the track &quot;Mo Tucker&quot; as well as vocals from Hope Sandoval on &quot;Perfume&quot;.

==== Disbandment ====
Though it was not until October 1999 that the split was made official, on 12 September 1998, William had a falling out in the tour bus with Lurie, the guitarist, before they were to play a sold out performance at the famous Los Angeles House of Blues. Jim appeared onstage apparently drunk and barely able to stand or sing. William walked offstage about 15 minutes into their set, and the show ended. The audience was later refunded the price of their tickets. The band finished up their U.S. and Japanese dates without William, but from that point, it was clear that the band was at its end. Jim Reid said in 2006 of the tension between himself and William: &quot;After each tour we wanted to kill each other, and after the final tour we tried&quot;. On the final night of the tour in Providence, Rhode Island, the band&#x27;s promoter ran off with the money and the band reportedly got in a fight with the cast of the show &quot;Riverdance&quot;.

===Post-split===

Immediately after the split, William Reid went solo as Lazycame—having already released a solo EP in April 1998—and Jim Reid founded Freeheat along with Lurie and ex-Gun Club bassist Romi Mori and Earl Brutus drummer Nick Sanderson, although neither act received much attention or found any success. In October 2005, it was announced that the Reids were reunited; Jim Reid&#x27;s track &quot;Song for a Secret&quot; a duet with his wife Julie Barber, was released as a single, paired up with Sister Vanilla&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop The Rock&quot;, which was written and produced by William and the brothers&#x27; younger sibling, Linda. The single was released by Transistor Records on 17 October. Jim promoted his side of the single with a very rare solo gig at London&#x27;s Sonic Cathedral club on John Peel Day, Thursday 13 October 2005. He finished the appearance with a performance of the early Mary Chain classic &quot;Never Understand&quot;. Jim also performed new material at low-key gigs with a new band comprising Phil King on guitar, Loz Colbert (Ride) on drums and bassist Mark Crozer (International Jetsetters).

In 2006 five albums were reissued through Rhino Records: &quot;Psychocandy&quot;, &quot;Darklands&quot;, &quot;Automatic&quot;, &quot;Honey&#x27;s Dead&quot; and &quot;Stoned &amp; Dethroned&quot; on 11 July 2006. Each album was released with a DVD containing three promo videos from that particular album.

===Reunion: 2007–present===
The Jesus and Mary Chain reunited to perform at Coachella on 27 April 2007. During &quot;Just Like Honey&quot;, Scarlett Johansson, who starred in the film &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; featuring the song, performed with the band on the main stage. The band held a warm-up gig the day before in Pomona, California with Giant Drag&#x27;s Annie Hardy as the guest. The band&#x27;s first UK performance since reforming was at the Meltdown festival in June. 

In June 2007, Jim Reid revealed that the band was working on a new album. In March 2008, the band released &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; for the soundtrack to NBC&#x27;s television series &quot;Heroes&quot;, their first new song since 1998. In September 2008, Rhino Records released the 4-CD compilation &quot;The Power of Negative Thinking: B-Sides &amp; Rarities.&quot; In 2010, a greatest hits album, &quot;Upside Down: The Best of The Jesus and Mary Chain&quot;, was released via Music Club Deluxe. 

The band toured North America in 2012 and also played China for the first time in May. The lineup featured guitarist John Moore and Fountains of Wayne drummer Brian Young replacing Loz Colbert. Mark Crozer replaced Moore beginning with the band&#x27;s Tel Aviv shows in October. In 2013, it was announced that a full-discography vinyl box set, dubbed as &quot;The Complete Vinyl Collection&quot;, would be released for the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary, via Demon Music Group. In 2014, the band became the first to sign to the newly reformed Creation Management, helmed by Alan McGee. The band played &quot;Psychocandy&quot; in full through 2015 to celebrate the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary.

In September 2015, Jim Reid announced that the band were recording their first studio album since 1998. The album titled &quot;Damage and Joy&quot; was produced by Youth and released on 24 March 2017. On 24 August 2017, Bobby Gillespie joined the band on drums for three &quot;Psychocandy&quot; songs during their performance at Vilar de Mouros Festival in Portugal. In autumn 2018, they opened for Nine Inch Nails&#x27; &quot;Cold and Black and Infinite&quot; North American tour. The band announced a &quot;Darklands&quot; tour of Europe in March and April 2020, which was ultimately postponed to November and December 2021. In June 2021, the band sued Warner Music Group for control of their debut album &quot;Psychocandy&quot;, and later albums, and seeking $2.55 million in damages. Under Section 203 of the United States&#x27; Copyright Act of 1976, artists may reclaim the rights to their recordings after 35 years, provided that they serve timely and proper notice upon the current record label. The case was settled out of court in March 2023

On 29 November 2023, the band released &quot;Jamcod&quot;, the lead single from their eighth album &quot;Glasgow Eyes&quot;, which was released on 22 March 2024.

==In popular culture==
They were referenced in season 24, episode 22 of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Dangers on a Train&quot;. The men of Springfield are helping Homer restore a train for Homer and Marge&#x27;s anniversary. Reverend Lovejoy is reading a book called &quot;The Jesus and Mary Train&quot;. The song &quot;Ebin&quot; by Sublime references the Jesus and Mary Chain in the lyrics &quot;Ebin was a cooly that I used to know / Now he&#x27;s down with the PLO / He&#x27;s cold kickin&#x27; it live with the KKK / No JMC, no JFA&quot;.

Their song &quot;Just Like Honey&quot; from &quot;Psychocandy&quot; was featured in the closing scene of the Sofia Coppola film &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;. In the 2000 movie High Fidelity, the album &quot;Psychocandy&quot; is recommended to a record store customer, with The Jesus and Mary Chain cited as picking up where Echo and the Bunnymen left off. The acoustic version of their song &quot;Taste of Cindy&quot; was featured in the 2009 Greg Mottola film &quot;Adventureland&quot;. The song &quot;Reverence&quot; from their &quot;Honey&#x27;s Dead&quot; album was featured in the 1992 film &quot;Pet Sematary II&quot;. &quot;Snakedriver&quot; was featured on &quot;The Crow: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;. “Why’d You Want Me” was featured in the 1992 Pauly Shore film &quot;Encino Man&quot;. A poster for the band is seen in the 1995 &quot;Bottom&quot; episode &quot;Terror&quot; in the scene where Richie (Rik Mayall) and Eddie (Ade Edmondson) fight three boys dressed as devils.

They were referenced by their acronym J.A.M.C. by the band Death Cab for Cutie in the song &quot;We Looked Like Giants&quot; from their fourth studio album &quot;Transatlanticism&quot;. Jimmy Eat World also referred to the band and their third album (&quot;The DJ never has it, J.A.M.C. Automatic&quot;) in the lyrics of &quot;The Authority Song&quot; from their fourth album &quot;Bleed American&quot;. In addition, Jesus and Mary Chain are referenced in the song &quot;Mildenhall&quot; from The Shins&#x27;s fifth full-length studio album, &quot;Heartworms&quot;. James Mercer mentions them as a band he frequently listened to as child in his time abroad in Suffolk, England. The song &quot;April Skies&quot; was featured in the AMC TV series &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; in a scene from the episode entitled &quot;Stradivarius&quot;. &quot;Jesus&quot;, a character on the show, is seen listening to the song on a record player.
Pixies have covered Head On, including the cover on their Trompe Le Monde album. American rock band Nudie Mag covered “About You” as a stand alone single. 

In the episode of &quot;Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too&quot; from the TV series &quot;Black Mirror&quot;, there is a poster of &quot;Damage and Joy&quot; album coming from Jack&#x27;s room. A poster of the artwork of &quot;I Hate Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; appears in the 2006 film &quot;Lake Mungo&quot;.

The band features in the book &quot;Postcards from Scotland&quot; detailing the 1980s and 1990s independent music scene in Scotland.
