<text>The Cars were an American rock band formed in Boston in 1976. Emerging from the new wave scene in the late 1970s, they consisted of Ric Ocasek (rhythm guitar), Benjamin Orr (bass guitar), Elliot Easton (lead guitar), Greg Hawkes (keyboards), and David Robinson (drums). Ocasek and Orr shared lead vocals, and Ocasek was the band&#x27;s principal songwriter and leader. 

The Cars were at the forefront of the merger of 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new synthesizer-oriented pop that became popular in the early 1980s. Music critic Robert Palmer, writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, described the Cars&#x27; musical style: &quot;They have taken some important but disparate contemporary trends—punk minimalism, the labyrinthine synthesizer and guitar textures of art rock, the &#x27;50s rockabilly revival and the melodious terseness of power pop—and mixed them into a personal and appealing blend.&quot;

The Cars were named Best New Artist in the 1978 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Readers&#x27; Poll. The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Cars&quot;, sold six million copies and appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart for 139 weeks. The Cars had four Top 10 hits: &quot;Shake It Up&quot; (1981), &quot;You Might Think&quot; (1984), &quot;Drive&quot; (1984), and &quot;Tonight She Comes&quot; (1985). The band won Video of the Year for &quot;You Might Think&quot; at the first MTV Video Music Awards in 1984.

The Cars disbanded in 1988. Orr died in 2000 from pancreatic cancer, at the age of 53. In 2007, Easton and Hawkes joined Todd Rundgren and others to form the offshoot band The New Cars. The surviving original members of the Cars reunited in 2010 to record the band&#x27;s seventh and final album, &quot;Move Like This&quot;, which was released in May 2011. Following a short tour in support of &quot;Move Like This&quot;, the band once again went on hiatus. In April 2018, the Cars were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and reunited to perform at the induction ceremony. Ocasek died of cardiovascular disease in September 15, 2019, at the age of 75.

==History==
===Early years===

Before forming the Cars, members of the band performed together in several different groups. Ric Ocasek and Benjamin Orr met in Cleveland, Ohio in the 1960s after Ocasek saw Orr performing with his band the Grasshoppers on the &quot;Big 5 Show&quot;, a local musical variety program. The two were members of various bands in Columbus, Ohio and Ann Arbor, Michigan before moving to Boston in the early 1970s. In Boston, Ocasek and Orr, along with lead guitarist Jas Goodkind, formed a Crosby, Stills and Nash-style folk rock band called Milkwood. In 1972, they released an album titled &quot;How&#x27;s the Weather&quot; through Paramount Records that failed to chart.

After Milkwood, Ocasek and Orr formed the group Richard and the Rabbits, a name suggested by Jonathan Richman. The band included Greg Hawkes, who had studied at the Berklee School of Music and had played saxophone on Milkwood&#x27;s album. Hawkes left to tour with Martin Mull and His Fabulous Furniture, a musical comedy act in which Mull played a variety of instruments. Ocasek and Orr then performed as an acoustic duo called Ocasek and Orr at the Idler Coffeehouse in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Some of the songs that they played became early Cars songs.

Ocasek and Orr later teamed with guitarist Elliot Easton (who had also studied at Berklee) in the band Cap&#x27;n Swing. The band also featured drummer Glenn Evans, later followed by Kevin Robichaud, and a jazzy bass player, which clashed with Ocasek&#x27;s preference for a rock-and-roll sound. Orr was the lead vocalist and did not play an instrument. Cap&#x27;n Swing soon came to the attention of WBCN disc jockey Maxanne Sartori, who began playing songs from their demo tape on her show.

After being rejected by several record labels, Ocasek fired the bass player, keyboardist and drummer and resolved to form a band that better fit his style of writing. Orr took bass guitar and Robichaud was replaced by David Robinson, best known for his career with the Modern Lovers and DMZ. Robinson, whose sense of fashion exerted a strong influence on the band&#x27;s image, suggested the band&#x27;s new name, the Cars. The band was formed in 1976.

===Rise in popularity, &quot;The Cars&quot;, and &quot;Candy-O&quot; (1976–1979)===
After a warmup gig in a motel lounge outside of Boston, the Cars played their official first show at Pease Air Force Base in New Hampshire a short time later on December 31, 1976.

Cap&#x27;n Swing&#x27;s keyboardist Danny Schliftman (later to join Gov&#x27;t Mule under the name Danny Louis) played with the Cars for their first several gigs until Greg Hawkes was free to join in February 1977.

The Cars spent early 1977 playing throughout New England, developing the songs that appeared on their debut album. A nine-song demo tape was recorded in early 1977 and soon &quot;Just What I Needed&quot; was receiving heavy airplay on Boston radio stations WBCN and WCOZ. The band was offered record deals by Arista Records and Elektra Records and signed with Elektra, a label with comparatively fewer new-wave acts. The band&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Cars&quot; was released in June 1978, reaching No. 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Just What I Needed&quot; was released as the debut single from the album, followed by &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Girl&quot; and &quot;Good Times Roll&quot;, all three charting on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album featured multiple album tracks that received substantial airplay such as &quot;You&#x27;re All I&#x27;ve Got Tonight&quot;, &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot; and &quot;Moving in Stereo&quot;.

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Candy-O&quot;, was released in June 1979 and eclipsed the success of &quot;The Cars&quot;, peaking at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; album chart, 15 spots higher than the debut album. Featuring a cover created by the famed &quot;Playboy&quot; artist Alberto Vargas, the album featured the band&#x27;s first top-20 single &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot;. Singles &quot;It&#x27;s All I Can Do&quot; and &quot;Double Life&quot; were also released, but with less success.

===Change in sound, &quot;Panorama&quot;, and &quot;Shake It Up&quot; (1980–1983)===
Following the success of &quot;Candy-O&quot;, the band&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Panorama&quot; was released in 1980. The album was considered more experimental than its predecessors and featured only one top-40 hit, &quot;Touch and Go&quot;. Although the album peaked at No. 5 in the U.S., it did not receive the critical praise of &quot;The Cars&quot; and &quot;Candy-O&quot;, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; describing the album as &quot;an out-and-out drag.&quot;

In 1981, the Cars purchased Intermedia Studios in Boston, renaming it Syncro Sound. The only Cars album recorded there was the band&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Shake It Up&quot;, a more commercial album than &quot;Panorama&quot;. It was the band&#x27;s first album to spawn a top-10 single with the title track, and it included another hit in &quot;Since You&#x27;re Gone&quot;. Following their 1982 tour, the Cars took a two-year break and the members worked on solo projects, with Ocasek and Hawkes both releasing debut albums (&quot;Beatitude&quot; and &quot;Niagara Falls&quot;, respectively).

===&quot;Heartbeat City&quot;, &quot;Door to Door&quot;, superstardom, and first hiatus (1984–1988)===

The Cars reunited and released their most successful album, &quot;Heartbeat City&quot;, in 1984. The first single, &quot;You Might Think&quot;, helped the Cars win Video of the Year at the first MTV Video Music Awards. Other hit singles from the album included &quot;Magic&quot;, &quot;Hello Again&quot; and &quot;Why Can&#x27;t I Have You&quot;. &quot;Drive&quot;, with Orr on lead vocals, gained notoriety when it was used in a video about the Ethiopian famine shown at the 1985 Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium in London, although the Cars performed at the Live Aid concert in Philadelphia. The song became the band&#x27;s most successful single, reaching No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Actor/director Timothy Hutton directed the song&#x27;s music video.

The band&#x27;s 1985 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation included another hit single, &quot;Tonight She Comes&quot;, which peaked at No. 7 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Rock Tracks chart. The band members again pursued solo projects. Easton and Orr released their debut albums (&quot;Change No Change&quot; and &quot;The Lace&quot;, respectively), while Ocasek released his second solo album, &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;. In 1987, the Cars released their sixth album, &quot;Door to Door&quot;. It contained their last major international hit &quot;You Are the Girl&quot;, but the album failed to approach the success of their previous albums. The group announced their breakup in February 1988.

===Post breakup, solo careers and death of Orr (1989–2009)===

In the late 1990s, unsubstantiated rumors circulated of a Cars reunion. However, in 1995 Rhino Records released a two-CD set titled &quot;Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology&quot;, containing all the group&#x27;s hits mixed with rarities such as demos and non-album B-sides. The label released &quot;The Cars: Deluxe Edition&quot; in 1999, the band&#x27;s debut album in a two-CD format, and &quot;Complete Greatest Hits&quot;.

In the mid-1990s, Orr recorded tracks with guitarist John Kalishes for an unreleased follow-up to &quot;The Lace&quot; and performed with three bands: his own band ORR, the Voices of Classic Rock and Big People. Orr appeared with his bandmates from the Cars one final time in an interview for a documentary about the group before his death from pancreatic cancer at age 53 on October 3, 2000.

Ocasek continued to perform as a solo artist, having released more than seven studio albums. He established a notable career as a music producer working with bands such as Weezer, Hole and No Doubt. Robinson retired from music and spent most of his time working in his restaurant. In 2005, Easton and Hawkes combined their talents with Todd Rundgren, Prairie Prince (the Tubes, Journey) and Kasim Sulton (Utopia, Meat Loaf) in a revamped lineup, the New Cars, to perform classic Cars songs along with some new original material and selections from Rundgren&#x27;s career.

In 2008, the band&#x27;s first album was released for the video game &quot;Rock Band&quot;.

===Reunion, &quot;Move Like This&quot; and second hiatus (2010–2017)===
In 2010, the surviving founding members of the Cars suggested a reunion when Ocasek, Easton, Hawkes and Robinson placed a photo of the four members together, taken at Millbrook Sound Studios, on their Facebook page. On October 13, they also posted a snippet of a new song titled &quot;Blue Tip&quot;. A picture of Jacknife Lee in the studio was posted, hinting that he would produce the new album.

In October, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that the Cars were recording a new album at veteran engineer Paul Orofino&#x27;s studio in Millbrook, New York. A music clip of the new song &quot;Sad Song&quot; was added to the band&#x27;s Facebook page on December 7, 2010. A clip of a song titled &quot;Free&quot; was shared on January 1, 2011. The official debut video for &quot;Blue Tip&quot; was released on February 17. The video features the members of the band and New York-based street artist Joe Iurato. The surviving Cars agreed to not replace Orr, so Hawkes and Lee handled all of the bass parts.

The new album &quot;Move Like This&quot; was released on May 10 by Hear Music/Concord Music Group, debuting at No. 7 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s album chart. It featured 10 songs in under 40 minutes. &quot;Sad Song&quot; was released to radio stations on March 1 as the album&#x27;s first single. In May 2011, the Cars embarked on a ten-city tour of the United States and Canada and also performed at Lollapalooza in Chicago in August. On the tour, Orr&#x27;s bass parts were performed by Hawkes on keyboard and bass, and the vocals for songs originally sung by Orr (&quot;Just What I Needed&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; and &quot;Moving in Stereo&quot;) were performed by Ocasek. In an interview, Ocasek was asked whether the band would have reunited if Orr had still been alive, responding: &quot;Ben and I had a real cold war going that lasted about 23 years. I could never really figure out exactly why, but I think there was a lot of jealousy because I wrote the songs and I got a lot of attention. And there was all kinds of weird stuff, like he said, &#x27;My girlfriend writes songs, let&#x27;s use one of those or two of those.&#x27; I said, &#x27;No, that&#x27;s not the Cars.&#x27;&quot;

The Cars once again became inactive after the tour&#x27;s conclusion in 2011.

===Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction and death of Ric Ocasek (2018–2019)===

After seven years of inactivity, the group reconvened, along with Weezer&#x27;s Scott Shriner on bass, to play a four-song set at their 2018 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band played &quot;You Might Think&quot; (which Weezer covered for the &quot;Cars 2&quot; soundtrack), &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Girl&quot;, &quot;Moving in Stereo&quot; and &quot;Just What I Needed.&quot; They were introduced by Killers frontman Brandon Flowers.

On September 15, 2019, Ocasek was found dead of natural causes at his New York home at the age of 75.

==Musical style==
The Cars&#x27; music has been described as new wave, pop rock and power pop, and is influenced by proto-punk, garage rock and bubblegum pop. They have also used rockabilly in songs such as &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Girl&quot;. Critic Robert Palmer wrote that the Cars &quot;have taken some important but disparate contemporary trends—punk minimalism, the labyrinthine synthesizer and guitar textures of art rock, the 1950s rockabilly revival and the melodious terseness of power pop—and mixed them into a personal and appealing blend.&quot;

<text>Haircut One Hundred (also Haircut 100) are a British pop group formed in 1980 in Beckenham, London, by Nick Heyward, Les Nemes and Graham Jones. In 1981 and 1982, the band scored four UK top-10 singles: &quot;Favourite Shirts (Boy Meets Girl)&quot;, &quot;Love Plus One&quot;, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot;, and &quot;Fantastic Day&quot;.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;Pelican West&quot;===
Nick Heyward and Les Nemes had been in several bands together since 1977. They gigged under the names Rugby, Boat Party, and Captain Pennyworth, but did not release any music. Their last band together, Moving England, with Sex Gang Children&#x27;s Rob Stroud, released one single. Heyward and Nemes moved to London in 1980 where they recruited friend and guitarist Graham Jones. During a meeting brainstorming band name ideas, Heyward suggested Haircut One Hundred and because it was the one &quot;that made us laugh the most&quot; they kept it. The three were joined by drummer Patrick Hunt. Managed by Karl Adams, the band recorded some demos. Phil Smith played saxophone on the sessions and he joined the group, followed by percussionist Marc Fox. The group played some live dates and were signed by Arista Records in 1981. They entered Chalk Farm&#x27;s Roundhouse studios to record their debut single, &quot;Favourite Shirts (Boy Meets Girl)&quot;, which became their first hit, reaching No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart in late 1981, and resulted in their first appearance on BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

For the recording of their debut album, &quot;Pelican West&quot;, Blair Cunningham replaced Hunt on drums. Their second single, &quot;Love Plus One&quot;, was released in January 1982 and gave the band their second UK top 10 hit. &quot;Pelican West&quot; was released in February, reaching No. 2 in the UK Albums Chart. The band became internationally famous and toured the globe. &quot;Love Plus One&quot; reached the US top 40, and they secured further UK top 10 hits in 1982 with the singles &quot;Fantastic Day&quot; and &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot;.

===Heyward leaves and &quot;Paint and Paint&quot;===
In late 1982, tensions began arising within the band as they struggled to record new material, which was hindered when Heyward refused to attend recording sessions. Eventually, in January 1983, the band&#x27;s forthcoming single, &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot;, was postponed and a statement was issued confirming that the band and Heyward were parting company. At the time, Heyward told &quot;Smash Hits&quot; magazine that he had been contemplating going solo for some time and had already recorded some tracks with session musicians. However, many years later, Heyward stated that he had been struggling with stress and depression at the time after a year of constant work and pressure, which led to him being, in effect, sacked by the other members of the band. With the loss of the band&#x27;s frontman and main songwriter, Fox took over vocal duties and the band continued to write material themselves (several B-sides during Heyward&#x27;s tenure had been credited to the whole band). The band left Arista and signed with Polydor Records, and released a single called &quot;Prime Time&quot; which spent 5 weeks inside the Top 75 but failed to get any higher than number 46.

Further singles by this line-up, such as &quot;So Tired&quot;, failed to reach the UK top 40 and their follow-up album, &quot;Paint and Paint&quot; (1984) failed to chart. The band split up soon after. Heyward, however, had embarked on a successful solo career in 1983, and scored several chart hits (including the aforementioned song &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot;, which was his first solo release in March 1983) and a top 10 album, &quot;North of a Miracle&quot;. Blair Cunningham would join The Pretenders for their &quot;Get Close&quot; album, while Graham Jones would join future Corduroy members Ben and Scott Addison in the proto-Britpop act Boys Wonder.

===Reunions===
In 2004, more than 20 years after their split, Haircut One Hundred (including Heyward) reunited for the VH1 show &quot;Bands Reunited&quot; and performed &quot;Love Plus One&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Day&quot;. There were no further appearances from the band until five years later in 2009, when they rekindled their friendship via Facebook, and Heyward invited the rest of the band to perform at one of his solo gigs. The band (comprising Heyward, Jones, Nemes and Cunningham) then played London&#x27;s Indig02 on 28 January 2011, performing &quot;Pelican West&quot; in its entirety. The performance was recorded and released as a live CD. In 2013, the band&#x27;s official website stated that they had been working on new material together; however, it has not been released.

Though he did not mention new Haircut One Hundred material, Heyward commented in 2017 interviews that he has a &quot;deep love&quot; for the band, and is &quot;ever hopeful&quot; that the band will eventually reform for a reunion show at the Roundhouse.

In November 2022, Heyward announced on his Facebook page that the &quot;Pelican West&quot; album was due for a new Super Deluxe 4CD re-issue in early 2023. To celebrate the forthcoming release, Haircut One Hundred featured in a &quot;BBC Radio 2 Piano Room&quot; session on 16 February 2023, in which they played a cover of Harry Styles&#x27; &quot;As It Was&quot;. They also announced a warm-up show at the O2 Academy Oxford on 6 May 2023, and a one off show at the O2 Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire, London, on 12 May 2023.
In June 2023 the band announced a UK tour in Oct/Nov 2023 at which old and new material will be played. Heyward has confirmed on his Patreon site that a new album&#x27;s worth of material has been written.

In 2024, Haircut 100 toured the United States and Canada as the opening band for ABC and Howard Jones, playing 18 shows in August and September and released the single, &quot;The Unloving Plum&quot; .

<doc id="170479" wikidata="Q2715405" url="?curid=170479" title="UFO conspiracy theories">
<text>Some conspiracy theories argue that various governments and politicians globally, in particular the United States government, are suppressing evidence that unidentified flying objects (UFO) are controlled by an extraterrestrial or &quot;non-human&quot; intelligence, or built using alien technology. Since the 1980s, such conspiracy theories often argue that world governments are in communication or cooperation with extraterrestrials, and some claim that the governments are explicitly allowing cattle mutilation and alien abduction.

According to the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry little or no evidence exists to support them despite significant research on the subject by non-governmental scientific agencies.

==Overview==

Flying saucer conspiracy theories first began in the pages of pulp science-fiction, where they drew upon inspiration from the &quot;lost continent&quot; myths of Atlantis and Lemuria. In 1947, during &#x27;the first summer of the cold war&#x27;, private pilot Kenneth Arnold reported witnessing supersonic &#x27;flying discs&#x27;; historians would later chronicle at least 800 &quot;copycat&quot; reports in subsequent weeks, while other sources estimate the reports may have numbered in the thousands. Press speculated that the flying discs were secret American or Soviet technology.

By December 1949, author Donald Keyhoe promoted the idea that the Air Force was withholding knowledge of interplanetary spaceships, culminating in his 1955 work &quot;The Flying Saucer Conspiracy&quot;. Gulyas argues: &quot;Keyhoe was instrumental in popularizing one of the most lasting memes in the long flying-saucer story: the government cover-up of &#x27;the truth&#x27; about UFOs&quot;. The following year, the book &quot;They Knew Too Much About Flying Saucers&quot; introduced the concept of the Men in Black.

Conspiracy theories became more prevalent after the Kennedy assassination. In 1967, controversial prosecutor Jim Garrison accused UFO hoaxer Fred Crisman of involvement in the assassination; Thereafter, UFO conspiracy theorists began to link Kennedy&#x27;s death to aliens. An official debunking of a UFO sighting as &quot;Swamp Gas&quot; was met with ridicule, and by the 1970s, a supposed cover-up was termed a &quot;Cosmic Watergate&quot;. In 1977, blockbuster film &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; dramatized a government UFO cover-up. By 1974, theories alleged the Air Force stored dead alien bodies at a mythical &quot;Hangar 18&quot;, and in 1980, the book &quot;The Roswell Incident&quot; introduced the story of a UFO crash to a mass audience.

While earlier decades imagined a coverup of benevolent &quot;space brothers&quot;, the 1980s saw the rise of what scholars called &quot;ufology&#x27;s dark side&quot;: theories that a government cabal was secretly involved with a race of malevolent aliens. New theories linked a supposed UFO coverup to alien abductions, cattle mutilations, and even the JFK assassination. At a 1989 Mutual UFO Network conference, author Bill Moore confessed that he had intentionally fed fake evidence of extraterrestrials to UFO researchers.

The 1990s saw the rise of UFO conspiracy theories in popular culture, with TV shows like &quot;The X-Files&quot; and films like &quot;Independence Day&quot; and &quot;Men in Black&quot;.

In 2017, UFO conspiracy theories experienced renewed interest when Leslie Kean published stories of a 21st-century Pentagon UFO program.

==Mainstream views==

While unusual sightings have been reported in the sky throughout history, UFOs became culturally prominent after World War II, escalating during the Space Age. Studies and investigations into UFO reports conducted by governments (such as Project Blue Book in the United States and Project Condign in the United Kingdom), as well as by organisations and individuals have occurred over the years without confirmation of the fantastical claims of small but vocal groups of ufologists who favour unconventional or pseudoscientific hypotheses, often claiming that UFOs are evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence, technologically advanced cryptids, demons, interdimensional contact or future time travelers. After decades of promotion of such ideas by believers and in popular media, the kind of evidence required to solidly support such claims has not been forthcoming. Scientists and skeptic organizations such as the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry have provided prosaic explanations for UFOs, namely that they are caused by natural phenomena, human technology, delusions, and hoaxes. Beliefs surrounding UFOs have inspired parts of new religions even as social scientists have identified the ongoing interest and storytelling surrounding UFOs as a modern example of folklore and mythology understandable with psychosocial explanations.

Benjamin Radford has pointed out how unlikely such suppression of evidence is given that &quot;[t]he UFO coverup conspiracy would have to span decades, cross international borders, and transcend political administrations&quot; and that &quot;all of the world&#x27;s governments, in perpetuity, regardless of which political party is in power and even among enemies, [would] have colluded to continue the coverup.&quot;

==Notable proponents==

Donald Keyhoe was the most prominent proponent of UFO conspiracy theories during the 1950s. In the late 1960s and 1970s, Jacque Vallee and J. Allen Hynek were notable voices alleging a &quot;Cosmic Watergate&quot;. Stanton Friedman was the first proponent to discuss the Roswell incident as a conspiracy.

Richard Shaver, one early proponent, had been hospitalized for psychiatric problems, while another, Paul Bennewitz, was hospitalized for paranoia after being deceived by Richard Doty. Several proponents later confessed responsibility for hoaxes or lies, including Gray Barker, Carl Allen, Richard Doty, Bill Moore, and Ray Santelli. Other proponents met violent ends—Morris Jessup and James E. McDonald died by suicide, while Bill Cooper was killed by police during an attempted arrest.

Individuals who have suggested that UFO evidence is being suppressed include United States Senator Barry Goldwater, British Admiral Lord Hill-Norton (former NATO head and chief of the British Defence Staff), American Vice Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter (first CIA director), astronauts Gordon Cooper and Edgar Mitchell.

21st century proponents include former Canadian Defence Minister Paul Hellyer, Stanford University immunologist Garry Nolan, and Israeli brigadier general Haim Eshed (former director of space programs for the Israel Ministry of Defense), In 2017, To The Stars Inc. was founded by Jim Semivan, Harold E. Puthoff, and Tom DeLonge. Luis Elizondo and David Grusch were notable proponents in the 2020s. Beyond their testimonies and reports they have presented no evidence to substantiate their statements and claims.

==In popular fiction==

Works of popular fiction have included premises and scenes in which a government intentionally prevents disclosure to its populace of the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence.

The 1960s saw conspiracy films like &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (as well as the novel). The 1970s saw the UFO conspiracy discussed briefly in Jack Nicholson vehicle &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, and in-depth in the Steven Spielberg films &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;. The 1980s saw Spielberg return to the topic with &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; while Disney&#x27;s Flight of the Navigator introduced UFO conspiracy theories to a childhood audience. The 1990s saw UFO conspiracy theories in films like &quot;Total Recall&quot;, &quot;Independence Day&quot;, and &quot;Men in Black&quot;. Television series and films including &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Dark Skies&quot;, and &quot;Stargate&quot; have also featured efforts by governments to conceal information about extraterrestrial beings. In March 2001, former astronaut and United States Senator John Glenn appeared on an episode of the TV series &quot;Frasier&quot; playing a fictional version of himself who confesses to a UFO coverup.

The plot of the Sidney Sheldon novel &quot;The Doomsday Conspiracy&quot; involves a UFO conspiracy, as did the plot of the 2021 series American Horror Story: Double Feature.

==In religion==
Scholars of religion have identified some new religious movements among the proponents of UFO conspiracy theories, most notably the Nation of Islam, Scientology, and Heaven&#x27;s Gate.

Mormon cosmology teaches that the Earth is not unique, but that it is one of many inhabited planets, with each planet created for the purpose of bringing about the &quot;immortality and eternal life&quot; (i.e., the exaltation) of humanity.
One author observes &quot;there has long been an association between UFOs and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&quot;.

Theosophists and occultists had long claimed knowledge of extraterrestrial beings. In 1946, Meade Layne achieved national notoriety when the wire service carried his claims to be in telepathic communication with people in a space ship. Other &quot;contactees&quot; like George Adamski and George Hunt Williamson similarly had backgrounds in Theosophy. Guy Warren Ballard, founder of the UFO religion &quot;I AM&quot; Activity, had a background in Theosophist.

In the years following the 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria, Nation of Islam founder W.D. Fard introduced the concept of The Mother Plane: an apocalyptic Japanese weapon of war. During the ensuing decades, the Mother Plane became identified with UFOs.

1950s UFO religions included Unarius and the Aetherius Society. In the 1950s, L. Ron Hubbard, a pulp fiction author in Raymond Palmer&#x27;s magazines and a practitioner of Aleister Crowley&#x27;s Thelema, founded the new religious movement Scientology. In the late 1960s, Hubbard began to secretly teach of Xenu, an extraterrestrial who conspired to turn ancient Earth into a prison for immortal souls. In the 1970s, UFO religion Raëlism formed; In 2002 the group achieved notoriety for its unverified claims to have performed human cloning.

In 1997, rumors spread that a spaceship was trailing the Hale-Bopp comet. On March 26, 1997, law enforcement discovered the bodies of the 39 active members of Heaven&#x27;s Gate religious group. They had participated in a coordinated series of ritual suicides, coinciding with the closest approach of Comet Hale–Bopp. From 1994 to 1997, UFO religion Order of the Solar Temple was responsible for 74 deaths in a series of mass deaths.

==Chronology of UFO conspiracy theories==
===Origin in Raymond Palmer&#x27;s pulp magazine===
UFO conspiracy theories began in 1940s pulp magazine edited by Raymond Palmer, known as &quot;the man who invented flying saucers&quot;. For years prior to the 1947 flying disc craze, Palmer had published reports of strange craft in his pulp sci-fi magazine &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. During the 1947 flying disc craze, Palmer hired original saucer witness Kenneth Arnold to investigate a flying disc report near Maury Island, Washington. By October 1947, Palmer&#x27;s magazine featured claims that the truth behind the discs was being covered up. Palmer would continue to promote UFO conspiracy theories for the rest of his life, eventually linking them to the JFK assassination and Watergate.

====Spaceships of the &quot;The Shaver Mystery&quot;====

Beginning in 1945, Palmer began to print ostensibly-true stories based on the writings of Richard Shaver, a Pennsylvania welder who claimed to be in telepathic communication with a secret underground race. In 1934, Shaver had been hospitalized for psychiatric problems; Barkun argues: &quot;By most accounts Shaver himself believed with absolute conviction in the truthfulness of his stories. This, combined with their appearance in a pulp-fiction venue, served further to blur the already uncertain boundary between fact and fiction.&quot;
Shaver claimed that ancient civilizations has mastered space travel, spread civilization to other planets, and could travel to Earth.

In a July 1946 editorial, Palmer argued that &quot;responsible parties in world governments&quot; were aware &quot;of the fact of spaceships visiting Earth&quot;. Peebles opines: &quot;One would be hard pressed to find a more concise summary of the flying saucer myth. Yet this was a year before the first widely publicized sighting.&quot;

====Kenneth Arnold ignites flying disc craze====

The flying disc craze began on June 24, when media nationwide reported civilian pilot Kenneth Arnold&#x27;s story of witnessing disc-shaped objects which headline writers dubbed &quot;Flying Saucers&quot;. Such reports quickly spread throughout the United States; historians would later chronicle at least 800 &quot;copycat&quot; reports in subsequent weeks, while other sources estimate the reports may have numbered in the thousands.

On July 8, 1947, Roswell Army Air Field issued a press release stating that they had recovered a &quot;flying disc&quot;. The Army quickly retracted the statement and clarified that the crashed object was a conventional weather balloon. The Roswell incident did not surface again until 1978, when ufologist Stanton Friedman interviewed Jesse Marcel.

In late July, Palmer contacted Kenneth Arnold and asked him to investigate a &quot;flying disc&quot; report from Fred Crisman near Maury Island, Washington. In June 1946 and again in May 1947, Palmer had published fantastical letters from Crisman, who claimed to have battled inhuman underground monsters in Burma. Arnold agreed and Palmer wired him $200 to fund the investigation.&quot; Arriving in Tacoma, Arnold interviewed Crisman, who told a tale of a flying disc that emitted rock-like debris and a visitation from mysterious black-clad stranger who gave ominous instructions not to speak of the disc.

Arnold summoned two Air Force investigators who took possession of the supposed debris, described as lava rocks, from Crisman. As the investigators returned to base, their B-25 caught fire and crashed. A local paper ran a story suggesting the plane had been sabotaged or shot down to prevent the shipping of the flying disc fragments. Though Crisman later confessed to a hoax, Peebles argues the story was the &quot;first to give a sinister air&quot; or &quot;conspiratorial atmosphere&quot; to the flying saucer myth.

==== Aftermath====
In the October 1947 issue of Amazing Stories, editor Raymond Palmer argued the flying disc flap was proof of Richard Sharpe Shaver&#x27;s claims. That same issue carried a letter from Shaver in which he argued the truth behind the discs would remain a secret.

Wrote Shaver: &quot;The discs can be a space invasion, a secret new army plane — or a scouting trip by an enemy country...OR, they can be Shaver&#x27;s space ships, taking off and landing regularly on earth for centuries past, and seen today as they have always been — as a mystery. They could be leaving earth with cargos of wonder-mech that to us would mean emancipation from a great many of our worst troubles— and we&#x27;ll never see those cargos...I predict that nothing more will be seen, and the truth of what the strange disc ships really are will never be disclosed to the common people. We just don&#x27;t count to the people who do know about such things. It isn&#x27;t necessary to tell us anything.&quot; During the last decades of his life, Shaver devoted himself to &quot;rock books&quot;—stones that he believed had been created by the advanced ancient races and embedded with legible pictures and texts. After Shaver&#x27;s death in 1975, his editor Raymond Palmer admitted that &quot;Shaver had spent eight years not in the Cavern World, but in a mental institution&quot; being treated for paranoid schizophrenia.
In 1952, Arnold and Palmer would author &quot;Coming of the Saucers&quot;. It detailed his 1947 investigation of Fred Crisman&#x27;s claims, alleged he had been eavesdropped on during his investigation, and other strange behavior.
In 1968, Crisman would be subpoenaed by a New Orleans grand jury in the prosecution of a local man for the assassination of President John F. Kennedy—a prosecution that would later be dramatized in the 1991 Oliver Stone film JFK. 
===National coverage===
The 1950s saw an increase in both governmental and civilian investigative efforts and reports of public disinformation and suppression of evidence.
On December 26, 1949, &quot;True&quot; magazine published an article by Donald Keyhoe titled &quot;The Flying Saucers Are Real&quot;. Keyhoe, a former Major in the US Marines, claimed that elements within the Air Force knew that saucers existed and had concluded they were likely &#x27;inter-planetary&#x27;.

The article examined the Mantell UFO incident and quoted an unnamed pilot who opined that the Air Force&#x27;s explanation &quot;looks like a cover up to me&quot;. The article claimed a &quot;rocket authority at Wright field&quot; had concluded saucers were interplanetary. Concern over a public panic, of the kind that supposedly occurred after the 1938 War of the Worlds broadcast, is cited in the article as a possible motive for the cover up.

The &quot;True&quot; article caused a sensation. When Keyhoe expanded the article into a book, &quot;The Flying Saucers Are Real&quot; (1950), it sold over half a million copies in paperback. The Air Force denied &quot;flying saucers&quot; exist and further denied that they were US technology being covered-up.
In 1954, before Sputnik the first man-made satellite, Keyhoe told press that alien satellites had been detected in Earth orbit. 
In 1955, Donald Keyhoe authored a new book that pointedly accused elements of the United States government of engaging in a conspiracy to cover up knowledge of flying saucers. Keyhoe claims the existence of a &quot;silence group&quot; orchestrating this conspiracy. Historian of Folklore Curtis Peebles argues: &quot;&quot;The Flying Saucer Conspiracy&quot; marked a shift in Keyhoe&#x27;s belief system. No longer were flying saucers the central theme; that now belonged to the silence group and its coverup. For the next two decades Keyhoe&#x27;s beliefs about this would dominate the flying saucer myth.&quot;

On January 22, 1958, Donald Keyhoe appeared on CBS&#x27;s Armstrong Circle Theatre in an episode titled &quot;UFO: Enigma of the Skies&quot;. During the live broadcast, Keyhoe deviated from the pre-approved script, announcing &quot;now I’m going to reveal something that has never been disclosed before&quot;. At this point in the broadcast, Keyhoe&#x27;s microphone was cut. According to Peebles, &quot;Millions of people thought the Air Force had (literally) &quot;silenced&quot; Keyhoe. Keyhoe emerged as the winner of the Armstrong Theater battle. Believers would point to it as an example of &#x27;silencing.&#x27; To the public at large, CBS&#x27;s cutting off of the audio gave Keyhoe&#x27;s appearance an impact much greater than anything he said.&quot;

====Aztec &quot;alien bodies&quot; hoax====
The first &quot;alien bodies&quot; conspiracy theory emerged in October and November 1949, when journalist Frank Scully published two columns in &quot;Variety&quot;. Scully claimed that dead extraterrestrial beings were recovered from a flying saucer crash, based on what he said was reported to him by a scientist involved. His 1950 book &quot;Behind the Flying Saucers&quot; expanded on the theme, adding that there had been two such incidents in Arizona and one in New Mexico, a 1948 incident that involved a saucer that was nearly in diameter. In January 1950, &quot;Time Magazine&quot; skeptically repeated stories of crashed saucers with humanoid occupants.

It was later revealed that Scully had been the victim of &quot;two veteran confidence artists&quot;.
In 1952 and 1956, &quot;True&quot; magazine published articles by &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reporter John Philip Cahn that exposed Newton and &quot;Dr. Gee&quot; (identified as Leo A. GeBauer) as oil con artists who had hoaxed Scully.

In a 1997 Roswell report, Air Force investigator James McAndrew wrote that &quot;even with the exposure of this obvious fraud, the Aztec story is still revered by UFO theorists. Elements of this story occasionally reemerge and are thought to be the catalyst for other crashed flying saucer stories, including the Roswell Incident.&quot;

====Air Force accounts====
On July 29, 1952, General John Samford, the director of Air Force intelligence, held a press conference on the recent UFO sightings over the nation&#x27;s capital; The conference was the largest one held in the seven years since World War II. Samford attributed the recent radar returns to temperature inversion. While most reports were easily explainable, Samford acknowledged having received a number of reports from &quot;credible observers of relatively incredible things.&quot; Samford continued, saying: &quot;our real interest in this project is not one of intellectual curiosity but is in trying to establish and appraise the possibility of a menace to the United States. And we can say, as of now, that there has been no pattern that reveals anything remotely like purpose or remotely like consistency that we can in any way associate with any menace to the United States.&quot;

While most accepted the official explanation, Peebles argues &quot;many in the press and public got the impression that the Air Force was covering up, and this was reflected in some of the press coverage.&quot; In 1952, the Robertson Panel recommended a campaign of public education.

Al Chop, a civilian, had served as the Press Chief for Air Materiel Command in Dayton, Ohio until 1951 when he transferred to the Pentagon to serve as the press spokesman for Project Bluebook. In 1956, a film titled Unidentified Flying Objects: The True Story of Flying Saucers dramatized the events of the early 1950s from the point of view of &quot;Al Chop&quot;, an Air Force press officer played by reporter Tom Towers. The film incorporates interviews with actual eyewitnesses and historic footage of unidentified objects, concluding with a dramatization of the 1952 UFO flap that featured repeated sightings over Washington D.C.

Ruppelt was a captain in the US Air Force who served as director of official investigations into UFOs: Project Grudge and Project Bluebook. In 1956, Ruppelt authored &quot;The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects&quot;, a book that has been called the &quot;most significant&quot; of its era. The book discussed the Twining memo which initiated UFO investigation and the rejected 1948 &quot;Estimate of the Situation&quot;. Ruppelt 
criticized the Air Force&#x27;s handling of UFOs investigations. Historian Curtis Peebles concludes that the book &quot;should have ended the speculation about an Air Force cover-up. In fact, Ruppelt&#x27;s statements were converted into support for the cover-up idea.&quot;

====&quot;Philadelphia Experiment&quot; hoax====

In 1955, Morris K. Jessup achieved some notoriety with his book &quot;The Case for the UFO&quot;, in which he argued that UFOs represented a mysterious subject worthy of further study. 

In January 1956, Jessup began receiving a series of letters from &quot;Carlos Miguel Allende&quot;, later identified as Carl Meredith Allen. &quot;Allende&quot; warned Jessup not to investigate the levitation of UFOs and spun a tale of a dangerous experiment in which a navy ship was made invisible, only to inexplicably teleport from Philadelphia to Norfolk, Virginia, before reappearing back in Philadelphia. The ship&#x27;s crew was supposed to have suffered various side effects, including insanity, intangibility, and being &quot;frozen&quot; in place.

In 1957, Jessup was invited to the Office of Naval Research where he was shown an annotated copy of his book that was filled with handwritten notes in its margins, written with three different shades of blue ink, appearing to detail a debate among three individuals. They discussed ideas about the propulsion for flying saucers, alien races, and express concern that Jessup was too close to discovering their technology. Jessup noticed the handwriting of the annotations resembled the letters he received from Allen. Twelve years later, Allen would say that he authored all of the annotations in order &quot;to scare the hell out of Jessup.&quot;

Jessup died by suicide in 1959. In 1963, Gray Barker authored a book alleging Jessup&#x27;s death was suspicious. By 1975, the Philadelphia Experiment was being promoted by paranormal author Charles Berlitz and in 1984, the legend was adapted into a fictional film. In 1980, Berlitz co-authored &quot;The Roswell Incident&quot;.

====&#x27;Men in Black&#x27; legends====
1956 saw the publication of Gray Barker&#x27;s &quot;They Knew Too Much About Flying Saucers&quot;, the book which publicized the idea of Men in Black who appear to UFO witnesses and warn them to keep quiet. There has been continued speculation that the men in black are government agents who harass and threaten UFO witnesses.

According to the &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; article &quot;Gray Barker: My Friend, the Myth-Maker&quot;, there may have been &quot;a grain of truth&quot; to Barker&#x27;s writings on the Men in Black, in that government agencies did attempt to discourage public interest in UFOs during the 1950s. However, Barker is thought to have greatly embellished the facts of the situation. In the same &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; article, Sherwood revealed that, in the late 1960s, he and Barker collaborated on a brief fictional notice alluding to the Men in Black, which was published as fact first in Raymond A. Palmer&#x27;s &quot;Flying Saucers&quot; magazine and some of Barker&#x27;s own publications. In the story, Sherwood (writing as &quot;Dr. Richard H. Pratt&quot;) claimed he was ordered to silence by the &quot;blackmen&quot; after learning that UFOs were time-travelling vehicles. Barker later wrote to Sherwood, &quot;Evidently the fans swallowed this one with a gulp.&quot;

===Growing distrust in government===

The 1960s began an era of government skepticism. After the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;, and the Watergate scandal, trust in the US government declined and acceptance of conspiracy theories became widespread.

In 1966, amid a wave (or &#x27;flap&#x27;) of UFO reports throughout southern Michigan, there were two mass sightings reported. The first occurred around marshland near Dexter, while the second mass-sighting took place near the campus arboretum of Hillsdale College, about 50 miles away.

After the reports were attributed to swamp gas by Air Force civilian investigator J. Allen Hynek, the explanation was widely derided. The Richmond News Leader accused the Air Force of attempting &quot;to discredit the testimony of witnesses.&quot; and US congressman Gerald Ford called for a formal Congressional investigation into the sightings.
Like &quot;weather balloon&quot; before it, the term any unbelievable debunking.

====Fred Crisman and JFK conspiracy theories====
On March 1, 1967, New Orleans District attorney Jim Garrison arrested and charged New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw with having conspired to assassinate President Kennedy. Fred Crisman was subpoenaed by Garrison and testified before the New Orleans grand jury in the case. Garrison issued a press release accusing Crisman of being an undercover agent with knowledge of the Kennedy Assassination.

The jury took less than an hour to find Shaw not guilty. Garrison&#x27;s prosecution of Shaw was highly criticized as &quot;a fatally flawed case built on flimsy evidence that featured a chorus of dubious and even wacky witnesses&quot; while others more pointedly accuse Garrison of &quot;recklessness, cruelty, abuse of power, publicity mongering and dishonesty&quot;.

Despite the near-universal condemnation of the prosecution, conspiracy theories continued to link Crisman to the Kennedy assassination and a supposed UFO cover-up. Crisman had been involved in the Shaver Mystery and the Maury Island Hoax in the 1940s. In the late 1970s, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations considered the possibility that Crisman may have been one of the &quot;three tramps&quot; detained and photographed in the aftermath of the JFK assassination. Pointing to Crisman&#x27;s supposed involvement, later conspiracy authors like Kenn Thomas, Jim Marrs, and Bill Cooper alleged that Kennedy&#x27;s assassination was tied to a UFO conspiracy.

====&quot;Cosmic Watergate&quot;====
In the novel and film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; by Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick, American discovery of an extraterrestrial artifact prompts a cover up and disinformation campaign with fatal consequence for astronauts sent to investigate. The film was prominent in Moon landing conspiracy theories, which variously argue that humans never went to the Moon, went there with the assistance of aliens, or even that NASA covered up lunar evidence of aliens. One scholar opined that the 1968 film &quot;seems to anticipate the post-Nixonian culture of governmental conspiracy&quot;.

J. Allen Hynek was an American astronomer who served as scientific advisor to UFO studies undertaken by the U.S. Air Force. Hynek had drawn ridicule for his most famous debunking, in which he suggested a mass-sighting over Michigan may have been caused by &quot;swamp gas&quot;. By 1974, the former skeptic was publicly charging that Bluebook was &quot;a Cosmic Watergate&quot;. Hynek claimed 20% of Bluebook cases were unexplained. Fellow Ufologist like Stanton Friedman echoed Hynek&#x27;s &quot;Cosmic Watergate&quot; accusations. In 1976, pulp publisher Ray Palmer argued &quot;there is a definite link between flying saucers, The Shaver Mystery, The Kennedy’s assassinations, Watergate and Fred Crisman.&quot;

During the 1976 US presidential campaign, Jimmy Carter pledged that if elected, he would &quot;make every piece of information this country has about UFOs available to the public and scientists&quot;.

====Alien bodies at &quot;Hangar 18&quot;====
In the mid-1970s, legends of alien bodies re-emerged in the popular lore. The idea of alien corpses from a crashed ship being stored in an Air Force morgue at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base was mentioned in Scully&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Flying Saucers&quot;, expanded in the 1966 book &quot;Incident at Exeter&quot;, and became the basis for a 1968 science-fiction novel &quot;The Fortec Conspiracy&quot;. &quot;Fortec&quot; was about a fictional cover-up by the Air Force unit charged with reverse-engineering other nations&#x27; technical advancements.

In 1974, science-fiction author and conspiracy theorist Robert Spencer Carr alleged that alien bodies recovered from the Aztec crash were stored in &quot;Hangar 18&quot; at Wright-Patterson. Carr claimed that his sources had witnessed the alien autopsy, another idea later incorporated into the Roswell narrative. The Air Force explained that no &quot;Hangar 18&quot; existed at the base, noting a similarity between Carr&#x27;s story and the fictional &quot;Fortec Conspiracy&quot;. In 1977, recurring SNL characters The Coneheads were contacted by an Air Force investigator (Buck Henry) after an extraterrestrial artifact crashes in the Southwestern US. The 1980 film &quot;Hangar 18&quot;, which dramatized Carr&#x27;s claims, was described as &quot;a modern-day dramatization&quot; of Roswell by the film&#x27;s director James L. Conway, and as &quot;nascent Roswell mythology&quot; by folklorist Thomas Bullard.

Decades later, Carr&#x27;s son recalled that he had often &quot;mortified my mother and me by spinning preposterous stories in front of strangers... [tales of] befriending a giant alligator in the Florida swamps, and sharing complex philosophical ideas with porpoises in the Gulf of Mexico.&quot; 

====&quot;Alien Abductions&quot;====
In 1975, millions of Americans watched when NBC aired film The UFO Incident, a dramatization of the Betty and Barney Hill case, the first reported &quot;alien abduction&quot;. In 1961, the Hills reportedly witnessed an unidentified light in the night sky as they were driving from Montreal to Portsmouth. Under hypnosis, Barney told a story of being abducted and drew a picture of an alien with large, wrap-around eyes—the first report of a &quot;gray&quot; alien. Recovered-memory therapy is not based on scientific evidence, and recovered memories are indistinguishable from false memories. Psychologists and skeptics argued that &quot;after viewing this movie, any person with a little imagination could now become an instant celebrity&quot; by claiming an abduction, concluding that &quot;one of those instant celebrities was Travis Walton.&quot;

Two weeks after the film aired, an Arizona crew working on a Forestry contract reported that member Travis Walton had been abducted by a flying saucer. Science writers Philip J. Klass and Michael Shermer highlight a potential motive for the hoax was to provide an &quot;Act of God&quot; that would allow the crew to avoid a steep financial penalty from the Forestry Service for failing to complete their contract by the deadline. The Walton case is widely regarded as a hoax, even by believers of UFOs and alien abductions.

By 1976, artist and amateur UFO researcher Budd Hopkins began focusing on abduction reports; Hopkins popularized the reports in his 1981 book &quot;Missing Time&quot; and its 1987 follow-up &quot;Intruders&quot;. Also in 1987, established horror author Whitley Strieber released &quot;Communion&quot;, an ostensibly non-fiction autobiographical abduction tale; It topped the New York Times bestseller list.
Strieber&#x27;s book popularized the idea of alien &#x27;visitors&#x27; associated with anal probes. In 1989, the book was adapted into a film of the same name, starring Christopher Walken.

====&quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;====

In 1974, the film &quot;&quot; dramatized an ostensibly-historical meeting between humans and aliens who land after being summoned. The filmmakers reported being told by military officials that a UFO had landed at Holloman Air Force Base. The depiction of a landing in the blockbuster &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; has been called a &quot;thinly veiled reference to the Holloman landing&quot; story. The Holloman story would be later promoted by hoaxer Richard Doty.

On December 14, 1977, the Spielberg blockbuster film &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; premiered and brought UFO conspiracy theories to a global market. The film opens with a United Nations recovery of Flight 19, lost in the Bermuda Triangle some 32 years prior, in Mexico&#x27;s Sonora desert; Since Keyhoe&#x27;s 1955 book &quot;The Flying Saucer Conspiracy&quot;, theorists had linked Flight 19&#x27;s disappearance to flying saucers. The film&#x27;s subplot of an &quot;exchange program&quot; of humans visiting aliens would later resurface in conspiracy theory as Project Serpo.

Legendary French filmmaker François Truffaut played a character inspired by French UFO investigator Jacques Vallee, an advisor to the film.Real life debunker-turned-believer J. Allen Hynek made a cameo in the film. In coming years, conspiracy figure John Lear and others would allege that powerful insiders had &quot;subtly promoted&quot; &quot;Close Encounters&quot; and other films to &#x27;educate&#x27; the public.
====Jesse Marcel and Roswell====
In February 1978, UFO researcher Stanton Friedman interviewed Jesse Marcel, the only person known to have accompanied the Roswell debris from where it was recovered to Fort Worth where reporters saw material that was claimed to be part of the recovered object. Marcel&#x27;s statements contradicted those he made to the press in 1947. Marcel revealed that the 1947 &quot;weather balloon&quot; had been a cover story, saying: &quot;They wanted some comments from me, but I wasn&#x27;t at liberty to do that. So, all I could do is keep my mouth shut. And General Ramey is the one who discussed – told the newspapers, I mean the newsman, what it was, and to forget about it. It is nothing more than a weather observation balloon. Of course, we both knew differently.&quot;

Uncertain of the material&#x27;s origin, Marcel would speculate the debris might have been extraterrestrial. In all his statements, Marcel consistently denied the presence of bodies. On February 28, 1980, sensationalist tabloid the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; brought large-scale attention to the Roswell story.

In the 1990s, the US military published two reports disclosing the true nature of the crashed aircraft: a surveillance balloon from Project Mogul. Nevertheless, the Roswell incident continues to be of interest to the media, and conspiracy theories surrounding the event persist. Roswell has been described as &quot;the world&#x27;s most famous, most exhaustively investigated and most thoroughly debunked UFO claim&quot;.
===Doty and Lear promote the &quot;Dark Side&quot;===
In the 1980s, UFO conspiracy theories began to incorporate politics, alleging that the US Government was in league with an evil alien race. By way of contrast with prior UFO conspiracy theories about benevolent &#x27;space brothers&#x27;, author Jerome Clark named this new strain of thinking &quot;ufology&#x27;s dark side&quot;.
Richard Doty, who identified as a special agent with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations at Kirtland AFB, was a source for much of this new &#x27;dark&#x27; mythology.
Another important figure during this era was John Lear, son of Learjet founder William Powell Lear. Pilkington argues that in the second half of the 1980s, Lear was &quot;probably the most influential source&quot; of UFO conspiracy information.

====Cattle mutilations and quiet helicopters====
During the 1970s, the Colorado-New Mexico border region was a hotspot for cattle mutilation reports, especially the small town of Dulce, New Mexico on the Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation. Ranchers reported sightings of unusual lights, UFOs, and &quot;quiet helicopters&quot; associated with the mutilations. Law enforcement recovered radar chaff, syringes, and a gas mask; Some of the corpses had rope marks and broken bones, as if they had been hoisted onto a helicopter and dropped onto he ground. After ranchers took to firing on unidentified helicopters, the US Bureau of Land Management was forced to ground all helicopters in Eastern Colorado. Writing in 2010, Pilkington reflects: &quot;The silent helicopter has now been revealed as not only a reality, but one that was flying as long ago as 1972. This was the Hughes 500P, the P standing for Penetrator, an aircraft known by the few who flew it as ‘The Quiet One’.&quot;

By 1976, some UFO conspiracy theorists argued that supposed cattle mutilations were caused by extra-terrestrial UFOs. In 1979, the idea of aliens causing &quot;mutiliations&quot; was ridiculed when it was reported that a mutilated bull had been drugged with Thorazine; Law enforcement told press: &quot;We know this stuff is made here, and it isn&#x27;t from outer space. Whoever is doing it is highly sophisticated, and they have a lot of resources. They&#x27;re well organized&quot;.

Pilkington suggests the &#x27;mutilations&#x27; may have been a covert epidemiological monitoring program, perhaps of radiation. In 1967, the United States Atomic Energy Commission had detonated an underground nuclear device near Dulce as part of Project Gasbuggy.

====Doty deceives mutiliation researchers====
The late 1970s also saw the beginning of controversy centered on Paul Bennewitz.
On April 20, 1979, U.S. Attorney R. E. Thompson and US Senator Harrison Schmidt held a public meeting about cattle mutilations. The meeting was attended by about 80, one attendee was Paul Bennewitz, an amateur UFO investigator. Bennewitz was befriended by Richard Doty, an Air Force Sergeant, who fed him false stories of a UFO conspiracy, government treaties with extraterrestrials, and alien harvesting of cattle. This material inspired much of the post-1980 UFO mythology. The earliest known reference to &quot;MJ Twelve&quot; comes from a 1981 document used in disinformation targeting Paul Bennewitz.

Paul Bennewitz was ultimately hospitalized for paranoia. Doty would appear in the 2013 documentary &quot;Mirage Men&quot; to discuss his role in deceiving Bennewitz. While Doty claims Bennewitz was targeted for inadvertently recording classified technology at Kirtland Air Force Base, Pilkington argues that government agents likely targeted Bennewitz due to his participation in the 1979 meeting on cattle mutilations around Dulce.
In 1979, Linda Moulton Howe was a documentarian exploring cattle mutilations. In 1980, Moulton Howe&#x27;s documentary &quot;A Strange Harvest&quot; alleged that cattle mutilations were connected to UFOs. In April 1983, Moulton Howe travelled to visit Richard Doty and Kirtland Air Force Base.

At Kirtland, Doty showed Moulton Howe fabricated documents purporting to be presidential briefing papers. The documents told of UFOs crashes at Roswell, surviving aliens, MJ-12, and a UFO coverup. For decades, Doty denied Moulton Howe&#x27;s retelling of these events, but in the late 2000s, he would acknowledge the exchange took place, admitting &quot;We gave Linda [...] some bad information.&quot; Howe became a &quot;staunch advocate&quot; for these &#x27;dark&#x27; conspiracy theories that the U.S. government is working with aliens. She would later be called one of &quot;the gurus of American ufology&quot;.

====Doty and Bill Moore spread bogus MJ-12 docs====

After the publication of &quot;The Roswell Incident&quot;, Richard C. Doty and other individuals presenting themselves as Air Force Intelligence Officers approached Moore. They used the unfulfilled promise of hard evidence of extraterrestrial retrievals to recruit Moore, who kept notes on other ufologists and intentionally spread misinformation within the UFO community.

On December 11, 1984, filmmaker Jaime Shandera received an anonymous parcel containing an undeveloped roll of film; When developed, the film was found to contain a copy of what is now known as the &quot;Majestic 12 documents&quot;. Shandera received the package just after a phone call from Moore. The documents detailed the creation of a group, &quot;Majestic 12&quot;, was formed to handle Roswell debris.

On October 14, 1988, actor Mike Farrell hosted &quot;UFO Cover Up? Live&quot;, a two-hour television special &quot;focusing on the government&#x27;s handling of information regarding UFOs&quot; and &quot;whether there has been any suppression of evidence supporting the existence of UFOs&quot;. The program interviewed shadow-clad informants Falcon (Richard Doty) and Condor about the Majestic 12 documents. The program was noted for its claim of an alien being, held at Area 51, who liked to eat strawberry ice cream.

The Majestic-12 materials have been heavily scrutinized and discredited. Carl Sagan criticized the complete lack of provenance of documents &quot;miraculously dropped on a doorstep like something out of a fairy story, perhaps &#x27;The Elves and the Shoemaker&#x27;.&quot; Researchers noted the idiosyncratic date format not found in government documents from the time they were purported to originate, but widely used in Moore&#x27;s personal notes. Some signatures appear to be photocopied from other documents. For example, a signature from President Harry Truman is identical to one from an October 1, 1947 letter to Vannevar Bush. After researchers noted many style and formatting errors, Moore admitted that he had typed and stamped the document as a facsimile.

At a 1989 Mutual UFO Network conference, Moore confessed that he had intentionally fed fake evidence of extraterrestrials to UFO researchers, including Bennewitz. Roswell conspiracy proponents turned on Moore, but not the broader conspiracy theory. Doty would later admit he had spread fabricated documents to UFO researchers in the 1980s.

====Lear inspires Bill Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Behold a Pale Horse&quot;====
In the Summer of 1988, Bill Cooper made his first public comments on the ParaNet Bulletin Board System, an early UFO message board, claiming that in 1966 he was serving aboard the &quot;USS Tiru&quot; when he and fellow Navy personnel witnessed a metal craft &quot;larger than a football field&quot; repeatedly enter and exit the water. Cooper claimed he was instructed by superiors to never speak about the incident.

Biographer Mark Jacobson argues &quot;the Tiru incident itself would not have done much to make Cooper&#x27;s name in ufology. That opportunity came only a few days later&quot; when he was contacted by fellow ParaNet poster John Lear. Lear, the son of Learjet founder Bill Lear, identified as a pilot who had flown missions for the CIA. On August 25, 1988, Lear authored a post titled &quot;The UFO Coverup&quot; which incorporated elements of mythos from Paul Bennewitz, a ufologist who was later revealed to have been fed disinformation by American counter-intelligence agent Richard C. Doty. Cooper soon visited Lear, and the two spent much time together from 1988 to 1990.

Cooper&#x27;s views were heavily influenced by Lear and his story of alien collusion with secret governmental forces. In 1989, the two released an &quot;indictment&quot; against the US Government for &quot;aiding and abetting and concealing this Alien Nation which exists in our borders&quot;. In 2018, columnist Colin Dickey noted Lear and Cooper&#x27;s influence, writing &quot;in the early years [UFO writers] did not, by and large, embrace strong political positions. They were the tip of a spear asserting that the number one thing we had to fear was not little green men, but the government that colluded with them, appropriating their technology against us.&quot;

Cooper and Lear&#x27;s collaboration lasted until the 1989 MUFON conference where Bill Moore admitted to spreading lies to UFO researchers. In response, Cooper accused Lear of being a CIA plant.

In 1991, Cooper published the influential conspiracy work &quot;Behold a Pale Horse&quot; which claimed that Kennedy was killed after he &quot;informed Majestic 12 that he intended to reveal the presence of aliens to the American people&quot;. &quot;Behold a Pale Horse&quot; became &#x27;wildly popular&#x27; with conspiracy theorists and went on to be one of the most-read books in the US prison system.

Cooper described the &quot;Illuminati&quot; as a secret international organization, controlled by the Bilderberg Group, that conspired with the Knights of Columbus, Masons, Skull and Bones, and other organizations. Its ultimate goal, he said, was the establishment of a New World Order. According to Cooper, the Illuminati conspirators not only invented alien threats for their own gain, but actively conspired with extraterrestrials to take over the world. Cooper produced regular shortwave-radio broadcasts that were popular with conspiracy theorist and anti-government activists. Cooper reportedly met with Timothy McVeigh shortly before the Oklahoma City bombing. In November 2001, Cooper was shot and killed by law enforcement during an attempted arrest.

====Lear introduces Bob Lazar====

Lear introduced journalist George Knapp to UFO whistle-blower Bob Lazar and his tales of Area 51. In November 1989, Bob Lazar appeared in a special interview with Knapp on Las Vegas TV station KLAS to discuss his alleged employment at S-4.

Lazar&#x27;s claims were widely discredited. Lazar never obtained the degrees he claims to hold from MIT and Caltech. In 1990, Lazar was arrested for aiding and abetting a prostitution ring. This was reduced to felony pandering, to which he pleaded guilty. By 1991, Nevada press reported tourists traveling to the Groom Lake region in hopes of glimpsing UFOs.

Lear remained a prominent voice in the UFO conspiracy theory community until his death in 2022, making multiple appearances on TV and online shows, including Coast to Coast AM. Lazar continues to spread tales of Area 51 through media appearance. In 2018, he was featured in producer George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell&#x27;s documentary &quot;Bob Lazar: Area 51 &amp; Flying Saucers&quot; and Joe Rogan&#x27;s podcast.

====Doty spreads &quot;Project Serpo&quot; stories====
In 2005, UFO researcher Victor Martinez received an anonymous email about Project Serpo, a supposed &quot;exchange program&quot; where Americans were sent to live on an alien homeworld. The anonymous informant and three other supposed-corroborating witnesses were revealed to be accounts operated by Rick Doty. He participated in the 2013 documentary &quot;Mirage Men&quot; about his campaign against Bennewitz, Howe, and others.

Doty continues to spread UFO stories, appearing in conferences, films, and the 2021 TV series &quot;UFO&quot;.

===Conspiracies conquer 90s media===

The 1990s saw as proliferation of conspiracy media along with the rise internet culture. Images of a gray alien were called the &quot;smiley face&quot; of the 1990s. The 1991 film &quot;JFK&quot; popularized Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories, specifically the writings of Jim Marrs. By 1997, Marrs was arguing that Kennedy&#x27;s murder was connected to a UFO conspiracy. In the 1992 comedy &quot;Sneakers&quot;, Dan Ackroyd plays a conspiracy theorist convinced that Eisenhower made a treaty with space aliens to permit cattle mutilations. 

In September 1993, &quot;The X-Files&quot; premiered focused on UFO conspiracy theories. Barkun observes that the show&#x27;s oft-repeated mantra &quot;Trust No One&quot; serves to &quot;neatly encapsulate the conspiracist&#x27;s limitless suspicions&quot;, while Gulyas describes the series as &quot;an exemplar of paranoid television, embracing the
mounting paranoia and tensions of the 1990s&quot;.

&quot;The X-Files&quot; incorporated elements of UFO conspiracy theories, including a shadowy cabal of conspirators, a Roswell coverup, Men in Black, and a &#x27;treaty&#x27; allowing alien abduction. In the episode “Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man”, the series antagonist is revealed to have been responsible for assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King. The 1998 X-Files film explicitly homaged Bill Cooper, with on-screen characters talking about &quot;Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars&quot;—an influential chapter title from Cooper&#x27;s book.

The success of &quot;The X-Files&quot; inspired similar works. The 1994 made-for-TV movie &quot;Roswell&quot;, broadcast on the Showtime Network, dramatized tales of a UFO crash and coverup. The 1996 blockbuster &quot;Independence Day&quot; introduced a global audience to the idea of a recovered Roswell craft being secretly studied at Area 51. Episodes of the 1996 show &quot;Dark Skies&quot; featured the tagline &quot;History as we know it is a lie&quot;. The show provided an alternative history that &quot;wove nearly every significant historical event of the past fifty years into a paranoid vision of extraterrestrial infiltration.&quot; The following year, &quot;Men in Black&quot; re-cast the supposed secret agents as comic heroes rather than sinister villains.

====&quot;Alien Autopsy&quot; hoax====

Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction is a 1995 pseudo-documentary containing grainy black and white footage of a hoaxed alien autopsy. In 1995, film purporting to show an alien autopsy conducted shortly after the Roswell incident was released by British entrepreneur Ray Santilli. The footage aired on television networks around the world. The program was an overnight sensation, with &quot;Time&quot; magazine declaring that the film had sparked a debate &quot;with an intensity not lavished on any home movie since the Zapruder film&quot;.

The program was thoroughly debunked. The autopsy footage was filmed on an inexpensive set constructed in a London living room. Its alien bodies were hollow plaster casts filled with offal, sheep brains, and raspberry jam. Multiple participants in &quot;Alien Autopsy&quot; stated that misleading editing had removed their opinions that the footage was a hoax. Santilli admitted in 2006 that the film was a fake.

====David Icke and reptilians====
The Branton Files are a series of documents espousing various conspiracy theories circulated on the internet since at least the mid-1990s. They are most often attributed to Bruce Alan Walton who claims to have been a victim of alien abduction and had contact through &quot;altered states of consciousness&quot; with humans &quot;living in the inner earth&quot;. The files have been characterized as &quot;high fantasy&quot; filled with &quot;complex and convoluted conspiracism&quot;. The content influenced David Icke.

In the 1990s, author David Icke proposed that world elites are actually &quot;reptilian&quot; aliens. Scholars note that the science-fiction franchise &quot;V&quot; had told a similar story from 1983 to 1984.

====Phoenix Lights and Heaven&#x27;s Gate====
On March 13, 1997, there were widespread reports of unidentified lights over Nevada and Arizona. Days later, 39 members of UFO group Heaven&#x27;s Gate were found dead in a mass suicide.

Arizona Governor Fife Symington III held a press conference, joking that &quot;they found who was responsible&quot; and revealing an aide dressed in an alien costume. Later, in 2007, Symington reportedly told a UFO investigator he&#x27;d had a personal close encounter with an alien spacecraft but remained silent &quot;because he didn&#x27;t want to panic the populace&quot;. According to Symington, &quot;I&#x27;m a pilot and I know just about every machine that flies. It was bigger than anything that I&#x27;ve ever seen. It remains a great mystery. Other people saw it, responsible people... I don&#x27;t know why people would ridicule it&quot;.

===21st century===
In the early 2000s, the concept of &quot;disclosure&quot; became increasingly popular in the UFO conspiracy community: that the government had classified and withheld information on alien contact and full disclosure was needed, and was pursued by activist lobbying groups. In 1993, Steven M. Greer founded the Disclosure Project to promote the concept. In May 2001, Greer held a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. that demanded Congress hold hearings on &quot;secret U.S. involvement with UFOs and extraterrestrials&quot;. Disclosure Project&#x27;s claims were met with by derision by skeptics and spokespeople for the United States Air Force. According to religious scholar Joseph Laycock, the idea behind &quot;disclosure&quot; predates modern UFO culture: in 1946, the editor of Amazing Stories magazine wrote, “If you think responsible parties in world governments are ignorant of the fact of space ships visiting Earth, you just don’t think the way we do”.

In December 2017, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a story about the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, a Defense Intelligence Agency program to study &quot;unidentified aerial phenomenon&quot; The program&#x27;s director, Luis Elizondo claimed there is a government conspiracy to suppress evidence that UFOs are of &quot;non-human&quot; origin.

U.S. news media and Congressional leadership were criticized for giving credibility to unverified stories of alien visitations and government cover ups. Some commentators expressed concerns about &quot;UFO cults and cult-like behavior, violence and cyber-stalking by UFO zealots&quot;. Astronomers, science writers and other experts observed that the increase in media publicity and government interest contrasted with &quot;the widely held sentiment among scientists that, for decades, the media has lavished too much attention on sensational claims that vague lights in the sky are actually extraterrestrial spacecraft&quot;. Despite pressure by &quot;disclosure&quot; advocates fueled by anecdotes and hearsay of a government cover up, skeptical investigator Robert Sheaffer said &quot;there is not going to be any &quot;big reveal&quot;.

In June 2020, Donald Trump, when asked if he would consider releasing more information about the Roswell incident, said, &quot;I won&#x27;t talk to you about what I know about it, but it&#x27;s very interesting.&quot; In December 2020, former president Obama joked with Stephen Colbert, &quot;It used to be that UFOs and Roswell was the biggest conspiracy. And now that seems so tame, the idea that the government might have an alien spaceship.&quot;

From 2019 to 2021, David Grusch was the representative of the National Reconnaissance Office to the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force; Beginning in 2023, Grusch publicly claimed elements of the US government and its contractors were covering up evidence of UFOs and their reverse-engineering. Within the UFO community, Grusch&#x27;s claims were seen as an indication that long-awaited &quot;disclosure&quot; was imminent.

Grusch &quot;became a hot new topic in the UFO world&quot; and his claims &quot;ignited a new wave of interest in extraterrestrial life&quot;, but his story was criticized for its lack of verifiable evidence. According to science writer Mick West, &quot;Grusch presented no documents (in public) and relied mostly on what he claimed to have been told by unnamed sources, things he could not share in detail&quot;. Scholars note Grusch&#x27;s claims of a government cover-up of alien visitation are &quot;broadly considered untrue by the majority of the scientific community&quot;.

<doc id="170483" wikidata="Q300409" url="?curid=170483" title="A Flock of Seagulls">
<text>A Flock of Seagulls are an English new wave band formed in Liverpool in 1979. The group, whose best-known line-up comprised Mike Score, Ali Score, Frank Maudsley and Paul Reynolds, hit the peak of their chart success in the early 1980s.

In an Interview with the Worchester Magazine (2017), Mike Score explains where the band name comes from:
&quot;my favorite band was The Stranglers. One of their songs was called &quot;Toiler on the Sea.&quot; We were at one of their concerts (The singer) yells out, &quot;a flock of seagulls.&quot; We were in the front row. He looked like he looked right at us and called out, “a flock of seagulls.” We took it as a sign. Originally, we were called Level 7, but Level 42 has just put their album out. We knew we were going to have to change our name … Strangely enough, from that moment on, everybody noticed us. Everyone was like, &#x27;Wow, what a strange name.&#x27; I think the name made people want to hear what we were about.&quot;

The group had a string of international hit singles including &quot;I Ran (So Far Away)&quot; (1982), &quot;Space Age Love Song&quot; (1982), &quot;Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)&quot; (1982), and &quot;The More You Live, the More You Love&quot; (1984). Their video for &quot;I Ran (So Far Away)&quot; received airplay on MTV during the Second British Invasion. The band won a Grammy Award in 1983 for their instrumental &quot;D.N.A.&quot; (1982).

In 2018, the members of the original lineup assembled to record the album &quot;Ascension&quot; with the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. In 2021, the original lineup again reunited temporarily to record another album with the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, &quot;String Theory&quot;.

==History==
=== 1979–1982: Formation and debut album ===
The band A Flock of Seagulls was formed in Liverpool, England, in 1979 by Mike Score, Frank Maudsley and Ali Score. Mike was a hairdresser when he bought a second-hand Korg MS-10 synthesizer and invited his friends to form the band. Frank played bass and Ali drums, even without prior experience. After testing six guitarists, Willie Woo joined the band and brought in Mark Edmondson to replace Ali on drums. Later, the Score brothers had a falling out, and Mark Edmondson left. Ali returned to the band and shortly afterwards Woo left, being replaced by Paul Reynolds, a 17-year-old friend of Mark Edmondson. Initially, the band did not have a vocalist. Mike, who was the composer of the songs, sang just to show how he thought the song should sound. However, Frank suggested that he be the band&#x27;s official lead singer. Mike was reluctant at first, but ended up accepting the suggestion.

The band began playing local clubs and eventually got a record deal with Jive Records. In 1981, they released their first single, &quot;Talking&quot;, which was produced by Bill Nelson. The single was a moderate success in the United Kingdom. In 1982, the band released their second single, &quot;Telecommunication&quot;, which was also produced by Bill Nelson. The single was an even bigger success than the first and became a club hit. The band&#x27;s third release was the EP &quot;Modern Love is Automatic&quot;. Released in the US, it included the single &quot;Telecommunication&quot; as well as &quot;I Ran (So Far Away)&quot; — which became the band&#x27;s biggest hit and was in heavy rotation on the new cable channel, MTV. The video for &quot;I Ran&quot; was low budget (even for the time), but it provided enormous exposure for the band, and it is well-remembered in part because MTV played it frequently.

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;A Flock of Seagulls&quot;, was released in 1982. The album was a commercial and critical success, reaching number 1 in Australia and the Top 10 in the US and New Zealand. The album was praised for its new wave songs, which were influenced by styles such as synthpop, post-punk and new romantic. The band was also praised for their image, which was characterized by slicked-back hair and colorful clothing. The album was influential in pop music in the 1980s. The band was one of the pioneers of synthpop and helped popularize the style.

=== 1983: &quot;Listen&quot; and the peak of popularity ===
In late 1982, A Flock of Seagulls finally achieved commercial success in their home country with the single &quot;Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)&quot;, which reached the top 10. The song was inspired by a short romance that vocalist Mike Score had with a girl on tour in the United States. The girl had a Polaroid camera, and Score asked her to take a picture with it. She said if he had the photo, he would leave and the romance would be forgotten. They broke up soon after, and Score wrote the song about how he wished he had a photo of her to remember her by.

The band began 1983 at the Palladium in New York playing the MTV New Year&#x27;s Eve Rock n&#x27; Roll Ball with &quot;Space Age Love Song&quot; still climbing the charts in the U.S. following the top ten success of &quot;I Ran&quot;.

&quot;Listen&quot;, the follow-up to band&#x27;s debut album, was released at the end of April 1983 and also received positive reviews. &quot;AllMusic&quot; critic Tom Demalon praises the single &quot;Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)&quot; as &quot;multilayered and hypnotic&quot; and also has written favorably about the songs &quot;Nightmares&quot; and &quot;Transfer Affection&quot;.

The band continued to enjoy commercial and critical success in 1983. They performed at the US Festival (in San Bernardino, California) in May and at Holleder Memorial Stadium (in Rochester, New York) in July. They also began touring with the band The Police.

Three more singles were released for &quot;Listen&quot; in 1983, but they were only moderately successful. The band began to lose popularity in the late 1980s, but they continue to perform and record.

=== 1984: &quot;The Story of a Young Heart&quot; and Reynolds&#x27; departure ===
Following the commercial success of their debut album, A Flock of Seagulls decided to change direction on their third album, &quot;The Story of a Young Heart&quot;. The band ventured into a new style, wanting to make a concept album based on themes such as suicide and heartbreak. The album was produced by Steve Lovell and featured more accentuated guitars and a more polished sound. The song&#x27;s lyrics were written by Mike Score, who had lost a close friend to suicide. The song &quot;Remember David&quot; was written in honour of his deceased friend.

Despite the band&#x27;s efforts, &quot;The Story of a Young Heart&quot; was not as commercially successful as their debut album. The singles &quot;The More You Live, The More You Love&quot; and &quot;Never Again (The Dancer)&quot; reached the top 40 on the US and UK charts, but &quot;Remember David&quot; was not as popular and had moderate success.

During the album&#x27;s tour, the band&#x27;s guitarist Paul Reynolds became involved with drug abuse. His drug problems worsened, resulting in his exit from the band mid-tour. The tour ended early. The band was without a guitarist. Reynolds&#x27; departure was a blow to A Flock of Seagulls. The band never again managed to achieve the same success as their early years.

=== 1985–1986: New lineup, &quot;Dream Come True&quot; and hiatus ===
After Paul Reynolds&#x27; departure, A Flock of Seagulls underwent a revamp. Gary Steadman, former Classix Nouveaux guitarist, was hired to replace Reynolds. Chris Chryssaphis, keyboardist, also joined the band. With the new lineup, the band recorded their fourth album, &quot;Dream Come True&quot;. The album was released in 1985 in the UK and in 1986 in the US.

&quot;Dream Come True&quot; was a commercial failure. Reviews were negative, with some critics calling the songs &quot;lifeless&quot; and &quot;ineffective&quot;. The band dissolved in 1986 after the album&#x27;s failure.

=== 1988–1998: Various formations and &quot;The Light at the End of the World&quot; ===
In 1988, Mike Score formed a new band with local Philadelphia musicians. This lineup released the single &quot;Magic&quot; in 1989.

In 1994, Score formed a new band with Ed Berner, A.J. Mazzetti and Dean Pichette. This lineup recorded the album &quot;The Light at the End of the World&quot;, released only in the US in 1995. The album was a commercial and critical failure. Critics called it &quot;tedious&quot; and &quot;embarrassing&quot;, while fans claimed it was &quot;misinterpreted&quot;. Score said the album was an unsuccessful attempt to bring the band into the grunge era, which dominated popular music at the time.

=== 1998–2018: Touring and &quot;Ascension&quot; years ===
In 1998, Mike Score formed a new band with Joe Rodriguez, Darryl Sons and Rob Wright. The band re-recorded Madonna&#x27;s song &quot;This Used to Be My Playground&quot; in 1999 for Madonna&#x27;s 2000 tribute album, &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest 80s Tribute&quot;.

In November 2003, the band&#x27;s original lineup reunited for a one-off performance on the VH1 series Bands Reunited. In September 2004, they reformed again and went on a brief tour of the United States.

In 2013, Mike Score launched a solo career. He released the singles &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot; and &quot;Somebody Like You&quot;.

In 2016, Kevin Rankin replaced Michael Brahm on drums. In December 2017, Gordon Deppe (from the Canadian band Spoons replaced Joe Rodriguez.In 2018, the band&#x27;s four original members reunited to record a new album, &quot;Ascension&quot;. The album was released in July 2018 and received positive reviews. Since the album&#x27;s release, Mike Score expressed a desire to reunite the original lineup for a tour.

=== 2019—: Inflight and String Theory ===
In 2019, the original members of A Flock of Seagulls reunited to record a new album, &quot;Inflight (The Extended Essentials)&quot;. The album was released on 12 July 2019 and featured extended versions of some of the band&#x27;s biggest hits, such as &quot;I Ran (So Far Away)&quot;, &quot;Space Age Love Song&quot; and &quot;Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)&quot;.

In the same year, Mike Score revealed in an interview with &quot;Classic Pop&quot; magazine that he was working on a new solo album, &quot;Space Boy&quot;. However, the album has yet to be released.

In 2021, the band announced that they would release a new orchestral album, &quot;String Theory&quot;. Scheduled for release on 20 August 2021, the album features orchestral versions of some of the band&#x27;s hits, such as &quot;Messages&quot;, &quot;Remember David&quot; and &quot;Say You Love Me&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Say You Love Me&quot;, was released on 23 July 2021. The single was released in seven different versions and featured a music video released on YouTube.

On 9 August 2024 the band announced their first album of new songs since The Light At The End Of The World, releasing the single titled Some Dreams. The sixth album of new songs will be released in December 2024 and will be called Some Dreams. The band&#x27;s current lineup features Mike Score on vocals, Pando on bass, Gordon Deppe (The Spoons) on guitar and Kevin Rankin on drums.

==Legacy==
Owing to their memorable and unusual style and appearance, A Flock of Seagulls are sometimes referred to with ironic appreciation. The &quot;New Musical Express&quot; wrote: &quot;Of course, everyone remembers this group now for singer Mike Score&#x27;s ridiculous back-combed haircut and the fact that they are mentioned in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. So now they&#x27;re kind of cool, but in the early 1980s it was a different story.&quot;

The band was featured on Viacom&#x27;s VH1 and Sony&#x27;s BMG Legacy Recordings&#x27; 2006 revival CD series and multi-platform marketing campaign, &quot;We Are the 80&#x27;s&quot;. In a 2007 article for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Alfred Hickling described the group as &quot;dreadful&quot;, and unfavourably compared them to new wave peers OMD and other Liverpool acts of the time.

The band is also noted for creating their debut album, a successful concept album which alludes to an alien invasion of earth. &quot;Billboard&quot; writer Robert Christgau applauded their &quot;mechanical lyrics, about a mechanical end of the world,&quot; while noting the &quot;aural pleasure&quot; of both the band&#x27;s debut album and the follow-up.

&quot;Cryptic Rock&quot; writer Alfie Mella praised the band as the &quot;poster band of new wave music&quot; due to the flamboyant hairstyle of its members, particularly the so-described &quot;waterfall bangs&quot; of its frontman. He also noted the band&#x27;s &quot;flanger and reverb-heavy, angular guitar strums; melodic keyboard lines and synth washes; dancey drumbeats; groove-driven bass lines; and icy, low-register vocal styling&quot; as defining the genre.

<doc id="170487" wikidata="Q959796" url="?curid=170487" title="Majestic 12">
<text>Majestic 12, also known as &quot;Majic-12&quot;, and MJ-12 for short, is a purported organization that appeared in fake documents first circulated by ufologists in 1984, and that some UFO conspiracy theories still claim to have existed. The organization is claimed to be the code name of an alleged secret committee of scientists, military leaders, and government officials, formed in 1947 by an executive order by U.S. President Harry S. Truman to facilitate recovery and investigation of alien spacecraft. The conspiracy gained notoriety over the years after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) declared the documents to be &quot;completely bogus&quot;, and many ufologists consider them to be an elaborate hoax. Majestic 12 remains popular among some UFO conspiracy theorists and the concept has appeared in popular culture including television, film, video games, and literature.

==History==
On May 31, 1987, it was widely reported that British ufologist Timothy Good claimed to be in possession of 1950s-era UFO documents. The documents purported to reveal a secret committee of 12, supposedly formed in 1947 by an executive order by U.S. President Harry S. Truman, and explain how the crash of an alien spacecraft at Roswell in July 1947 had been concealed, how the recovered alien technology could be exploited, and how the U.S. should engage with extraterrestrial life in the future.

According to ufologist William L. Moore, his friend, Los Angeles television writer-producer Jamie Shandera, received documents that appeared to be briefing papers describing &quot;Operation Majestic-12&quot; in mid-December 1984. The documents were found on an undeveloped roll of 35 mm film in a brown paper package that had been dropped through Shandera&#x27;s mail slot. The package bore no additional information other than a New Mexico postmark.

When developed, the roll of film revealed the Truman-Forestall memo, a &quot;Top Secret&quot; memorandum from President Truman to Defense Secretary Forrestal, dated September 24, 1947, authorizing him and Dr. [Vannevar] Bush to proceed with Operation Majestic-12 and the Eisenhower Briefing Document, a seven page &quot;Top Secret/Eyes Only&quot; Majestic-12 document used to brief President-Elect Eisenhower, dated November 18, 1952.

The concept of &quot;Majestic 12&quot; emerged during a period in the 1980s when ufologists believed there had been a cover-up of the Roswell incident and speculated some secretive upper tier of the U.S. government was responsible. Shandera and his ufologist colleagues Stanton T. Friedman and Bill Moore say they later received a series of anonymous messages that led them to find what has been called the &quot;Cutler/Twining memo&quot; in 1985 while searching declassified files in the National Archives. Purporting to be written by President Eisenhower&#x27;s assistant Robert Cutler to General Nathan F. Twining and containing a reference to Majestic 12, the memo is widely held to be a forgery, likely planted as part of a hoax. Historian Robert Goldberg wrote that the ufologists came to believe the story despite the documents being &quot;obviously planted to bolster the legitimacy of the briefing papers&quot;.

Claiming to be connected to the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations, a man named Richard Doty told filmmaker Linda Moulton Howe that the MJ-12 story was true, and showed Howe unspecified documents purporting to prove the existence of small, gray humanoid aliens originating from the Zeta Reticuli star system. Doty reportedly promised to supply Howe with film footage of UFOs and an interview with an alien being, although no footage ever materialized.

Soon, distrust and suspicion led to disagreements within the ufology community over the authenticity of the MJ-12 documents, and Moore was accused of taking part in an elaborate hoax, while other ufologists and debunkers such as Philip J. Klass were accused of being &quot;disinformation agents&quot;.

On October 14, 1988, the syndicated television broadcast &quot;UFO Coverup? Live&quot; introduced Americans to the Majestic 12 hoax. It featured the first public mention of Nevada&#x27;s Area 51 as a site associated with aliens.

== Analysis ==

Klass&#x27;s investigation of the MJ-12 documents found that Robert Cutler was actually out of the country on the date he supposedly wrote the &quot;Cutler/Twining memo&quot;, and that the Truman signature was &quot;a pasted-on photocopy of a genuine signature—including accidental scratch marks—from a memo that Truman wrote to Vannevar Bush on October 1, 1947&quot;. Klass dismissed theories that the documents were part of a disinformation campaign as &quot;ridiculous&quot;, saying they contained numerous flaws that could never fool Soviet or Chinese intelligence. Other discrepancies noted by Klass included the use of a distinctive date format that matched one used in Moore&#x27;s personal letters, and a conversation reported by Brad Sparks in which Moore confided that he was contemplating creating and releasing some hoax Top Secret documents in hopes that such bogus documents would encourage former military and intelligence officials who knew about the government&#x27;s (alleged) UFO coverup to break their oaths of secrecy.

As early as the summer of 1987, spokesmen from the White House and National Security Council denied the existence of any organization called Majestic 12, MJ-12 or Majic-12.

On September 15, 1988, a special agent at the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI) contacted the Dallas branch of the FBI after receiving the Majestic 12 document from an individual at an unnamed school who claimed to have received it in the mail. The FBI then began its own investigation of the supposed &quot;secret&quot; document and quickly formed doubts as to its authenticity. After receiving information from the OSI on November 30 of that year that no such committee had ever been authorized or formed, the FBI declared that the document was &quot;completely bogus&quot;. The Director of the FBI subsequently instructed the Dallas office to close their investigation.

MuckRock contributor Emma Best has suggested that the papers were &quot;government sponsored, or at least tolerated, disinformation&quot; because the declassified FBI file on Majestic 12 does not mention any further investigation to find or prosecute the forger responsible for it.

In addition to the Roswell incident, the &quot;Eisenhower Briefing Document&quot; also mentioned a second crash in 1950. This second alleged crash was in Mexico, near the towns of El Indio and Guerrero along the Mexico–US border. Tom Deuley investigated the Guerrero claim for MUFON, but found no evidence for a reported UFO crash.

Later in 1996, a document called the MJ-12 &quot;Special Operations Manual&quot; circulated among ufologists. It is also widely considered to be a fake and &quot;a continuation of the MJ-12 myth&quot;.

Ufologists Linda Moulton Howe and Stanton T. Friedman believed the MJ-12 documents to be authentic. Friedman examined the documents and argued that the United States government has conspired to cover up knowledge of a crashed extraterrestrial spacecraft.

The name &quot;Majestic 12&quot; had been prefigured in the UFO community when Bill Moore asked &quot;National Enquirer&quot; reporter Bob Pratt in 1982 to collaborate on a novel called &quot;MAJIK-12&quot;. Because of this, Pratt had always been inclined to think the Majestic 12 documents are a hoax.

Scientific skeptic author Brian Dunning investigated the history of the subject, and reported his findings in the 2016 Skeptoid podcast episode &quot;The Secret History of Majestic 12&quot;. He cited ufologist Bill Moore&#x27;s suspicion that, rather than a hoax perpetrated by the UFO community, the papers were actually part of a disinformation campaign of the US government meant to deflect attention from secret Air Force projects.

<text>Lionel Brockman Richie Jr. (born June 20, 1949) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and television personality. He rose to fame in the 1970s as a songwriter and the co-lead singer of the Motown group Commodores; writing and recording the hit singles &quot;Easy&quot;, &quot;Sail On&quot;, &quot;Three Times a Lady&quot;, and &quot;Still&quot; with the group before his departure. In 1980, he wrote and produced the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number one single &quot;Lady&quot; for Kenny Rogers.

In 1981, Richie wrote and produced the single &quot;Endless Love&quot;, which he recorded as a duet with Diana Ross; it remains among the top 20 bestselling singles of all time, and the biggest career hit for both artists. In 1982, he officially launched his solo career with the album &quot;Lionel Richie&quot;, which sold over four million copies and spawned the singles &quot;You Are&quot;, &quot;My Love&quot;, and the number one single &quot;Truly&quot;.

Richie&#x27;s second album, &quot;Can&#x27;t Slow Down&quot; (1983), reached number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and sold over 20 million copies worldwide, becoming one of the best-selling albums of all time; and spawned the number one singles &quot;All Night Long (All Night)&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot;. He then co-wrote the 1985 charity single &quot;We Are the World&quot; with Michael Jackson, which sold over 20 million copies. His third album, &quot;Dancing on the Ceiling&quot; (1986), contained the number one single &quot;Say You, Say Me&quot; (from the 1985 film &quot;White Nights&quot;) and the No. 2 hit title track. From 1986 to 1996, Richie took a break from recording; he has since then released seven studio albums. He has joined the singing competition &quot;American Idol&quot; to serve as a judge, starting from its sixteenth season (2018 to present).

During his solo career, Richie became one of the most successful balladeers of the 1980s, and has sold over 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the world&#x27;s best-selling artists of all time. He has won four Grammy Awards, including Song of the Year for &quot;We Are the World&quot;, and Album of the Year for &quot;Can&#x27;t Slow Down&quot;. &quot;Endless Love&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award; while &quot;Say You, Say Me&quot; won both the Academy Award and the Golden Globe award for Best Original Song. In 2016, Richie received the Songwriters Hall of Fame&#x27;s highest honor, the Johnny Mercer Award. In 2022, he received the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song by the Library of Congress; as well as the American Music Awards Icon Award. He was also inducted into Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2022.

==Early life==
Richie was born on June 20, 1949, in Tuskegee, Alabama, the son of Lionel Brockman Richie (1915–1990), a U.S. Army systems analyst, and Alberta R. Foster (1917–2001), a teacher and school principal. His grandmother Adelaide Mary Brown was a pianist who played classical music. On March 4, 2011, he appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, which found out that his maternal great-grandfather, J. Louis Brown, was most likely the biological son of federal judge and slaveowner Morgan Welles Brown. He was also the national leader of an early Black American fraternal organization. Notably, J. Louis Brown was:
Richie grew up on the campus of Tuskegee Institute. Their family home was given to his grandparents as a gift from Booker T. Washington. He graduated from Joliet Township High School, East Campus in Joliet, Illinois. A star tennis player in Joliet, he accepted a tennis scholarship to attend Tuskegee Institute, where he was a member of the marching band, the Marching Crimson Pipers , and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics with a minor in accounting.

Richie considered studying divinity to become a priest in the Episcopal Church, in which he had been baptised, but ultimately decided he was not &quot;priest material&quot; and decided to continue his musical career despite not knowing how to read or write music. He is a member of Kappa Kappa Psi, a national honor fraternity for band members, and an active life member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

==Career==
===Commodores===

As a student in Tuskegee, Richie formed a succession of R&amp;B groups in the mid-1960s. In 1968, he became a singer and saxophonist with the Commodores. They signed a recording contract with Atlantic Records in 1968 for one record before moving on to Motown Records initially as a support act to The Jackson 5. The Commodores then became established as a popular soul group. Their first several albums had a danceable, funky sound, as in such tracks as &quot;Machine Gun&quot; and &quot;Brick House&quot;. Over time, Richie wrote and sang more romantic, easy-listening ballads such as &quot;Easy&quot;, &quot;Three Times a Lady&quot;, &quot;Still&quot;, and the breakup ballad &quot;Sail On&quot;.

In 1974, Richie achieved his first commercial success as a songwriter with &quot;Happy People&quot;, which he co-wrote with Jeffrey Bowen and Donald Baldwin. Originally intended as a Commodores track, it was recorded by The Temptations, who had their No. 1 R&amp;B with the song. By the late 1970s, Richie had begun to accept songwriting commissions from other artists. He wrote &quot;Lady&quot; with Kenny Rogers, which hit No. 1 in 1980, and produced Rogers&#x27; album &quot;Share Your Love&quot; the following year. Richie and Rogers maintained a strong friendship in later years. Latin jazz composer and salsa romantica pioneer La Palabra enjoyed international success with his cover of &quot;Lady&quot;, which was played at Latin dance clubs. Also in 1981, Richie sang the title theme song for the film &quot;Endless Love&quot;, a duet with Diana Ross. Issued as a single, the song topped the Canada, Brazil, Australia, Japan, New Zealand and US pop music charts, and became one of Motown&#x27;s biggest hits.

===Solo career===

Richie&#x27;s 1982 debut solo album, &quot;Lionel Richie&quot;, contained three hit singles: the U.S. number-one song &quot;Truly&quot;, which continued the style of his ballads with the Commodores and launched his career as one of the most successful balladeers of the 1980s, and the top five hits &quot;You Are&quot; and &quot;My Love&quot;. The album hit No. 3 on the music charts and sold over 4 million copies.

His 1983 follow-up album, &quot;Can&#x27;t Slow Down&quot;, sold over twice as many copies and won two Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, propelling him into the first rank of international superstars. The album contained the number-one hit &quot;All Night Long&quot;, a Caribbean-flavored dance number that was promoted by a colorful music video produced by former Monkee Michael Nesmith. In 1984, he performed &quot;All Night Long&quot; at the ending ceremony of the XXIII Olympic Games in Los Angeles.

Several more Top 10 hits followed, the most successful of which was the ballad &quot;Hello&quot; (1984), a sentimental love song that showed how far he had moved from his R&amp;B roots. Richie had three more top ten hits in 1984, &quot;Stuck on You&quot; (No. 3), &quot;Running with the Night&quot; (No. 7) and &quot;Penny Lover&quot; (No. 8), as well as writing and producing &quot;Missing You&quot; for former labelmate and duet partner Diana Ross (No. 10 Pop, No. 1 R&amp;B). In 1985, he wrote and performed &quot;Say You, Say Me&quot; for the film &quot;White Nights&quot;. The song won an Academy Award and reached No. 1 on the U.S. charts, staying there for four weeks, making it the number-two song of 1986 according to &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Year-End Hot 100 chart, behind the charity single &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot; by Dionne and Friends. He also collaborated with Michael Jackson on the charity single &quot;We Are the World&quot; by USA for Africa, another number-one hit.

In 1986, Richie released &quot;Dancing on the Ceiling&quot;, his last widely popular album, which produced a run of five US and UK hits, &quot;Say You, Say Me&quot; (U.S. No. 1), &quot;Dancing on the Ceiling&quot; (U.S. No. 2), &quot;Love Will Conquer All&quot; (U.S. No. 9), &quot;Ballerina Girl&quot; (U.S. No. 7), and &quot;Se La&quot; (U.S. No. 20). He made his return to recording and performing following the release of his first greatest-hits collection, &quot;Back to Front&quot;, in 1992.

Since then, his ever-more-relaxed schedule has kept his recording and live work to a minimum. He broke the silence in 1996 with &quot;Louder Than Words&quot;, on which he resisted any change of style or the musical fashion-hopping of the past decade, sticking instead with his chosen path of well-crafted soul music, which in the intervening years has become known as contemporary R&amp;B.

Richie&#x27;s albums in the late 1990s such as &quot;Louder Than Words&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; failed to match the commercial success of his earlier work. Some of his recent albums, such as &quot;Renaissance&quot; and &quot;Just for You&quot;, have returned to his older style and achieved success in Europe but only modest notice in the United States.

===Later career===

Richie was the headliner at a 2006 Fourth of July tribute concert with Fantasia Barrino at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. On May 7, 2006, Richie performed on the main stage (Acura Stage) at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival, replacing Antoine &quot;Fats&quot; Domino, who had fallen ill. Richie released his eighth studio album titled &quot;Coming Home&quot; on September 12, 2006. The first single of the album was &quot;I Call It Love&quot; and was premiered in July 2006, becoming his biggest hit in the U.S. in ten years. The album was a success for Richie in the United States, peaking at No. 6.

On May 2, 2008, Richie was the 21st recipient of the &quot;George and Ira Gershwin Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; at UCLA&#x27;s annual Spring Sing. In accepting the award, Richie said: &quot;Forget about surviving 30 some odd years in the music business, Lionel Richie survived 27 years of Nicole Richie.&quot;

In May 2009, Richie announced that he would like to get The Commodores back together soon. An album, &quot;Just Go&quot;, was released in 2009. On July 7, 2009, Richie performed &quot;Jesus is Love&quot; at Michael Jackson&#x27;s memorial service.

Richie returned to Australia in 2011 where he and guest artist Guy Sebastian toured the country and New Zealand with concert dates throughout March and April. Richie and Guy Sebastian recorded Richie&#x27;s 1983 number-one single &quot;All Night Long&quot; together to raise money for Australian floods and New Zealand earthquake relief.

On March 26, 2012, Richie released his tenth studio album, &quot;Tuskegee&quot;, which featured 13 of his hit songs performed as duets with country stars. The album returned him to the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, his first number one album there since &quot;Dancing on the Ceiling&quot;, and achieved platinum status within six weeks of release.

On June 28, 2015, Richie played to an audience of between 100,000 and 120,000 people at the Glastonbury Festival, England. His show was described as &quot;triumphant&quot; by the BBC and was followed by his return to the top of the UK albums chart with a reissued compilation album of his work as both a solo artist and with the Commodores. In September 2017, ABC announced that Richie would be a judge for the revival of &quot;American Idol&quot;. Richie has been a judge on the reboot for seven seasons, including 2024.

In May 2017, Richie was honored at Berklee College of Music during its 2017 commencement concert when graduating students performed a medley of his discography. Richie was also awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music. On December 3, 2017, Richie received the Kennedy Center Honors. In October 2017, it was reported that Richie had secured the rights to produce a Curtis Mayfield biopic.

On March 25, 2019, Richie announced a 33-date tour across North America for the summer. His &#x27;Hello Tour&#x27; started in May at Arlington&#x27;s KAABOO Festival and ran through August.

In May 2023, Richie was invited to be a headline act at Windsor Castle for the Coronation Concert, in celebration of the Coronation of Charles III and Camilla. Richie is the First Global Ambassador and First Chairman of the Global Ambassador Group for the Prince&#x27;s Trust.

===Popularity in the Arab world===
Richie is a popular musician in various Arab states, and has performed in Morocco, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Libya. John Berman for &quot;ABC News&quot; reported in 2006 that &quot;Grown Iraqi men get misty-eyed by the mere mention of his name. &#x27;I love Lionel Richie,&#x27; they say. They can sing an entire Lionel Richie song.&quot; Berman wrote that Richie said he was told that Iraqi civilians were playing &quot;All Night Long&quot; the night U.S. tanks invaded Baghdad. Richie was against the war and has said he would like to perform in Baghdad someday.

==Personal life==

On October 18, 1975, Richie married his college sweetheart, Brenda Harvey. In 1983, the couple informally adopted Nicole Camille Escovedo (now Nicole Richie), the two-year-old daughter of a member of Richie&#x27;s band, who is also the niece of drummer Sheila E. The Richies raised Nicole as their daughter and adopted her legally when she was nine years old.

In June 1988, Harvey was arrested and charged with corporal injury to a spouse, resisting arrest, trespassing, vandalism, battery, and disturbing the peace after she found Richie at Diane Alexander&#x27;s Beverly Hills apartment. Richie and Harvey divorced on August 9, 1993, after nearly 18 years of marriage. Richie married Diane Alexander on December 21, 1995. They have a son, Miles Brockman Richie (born May 27, 1994), and a daughter, Sofia Richie (born August 24, 1998). The marriage ended in 2004.

Richie suffered prolonged throat problems and had surgery four times in four years before being told by conventional doctors that he could lose his singing career. He then turned to a holistic doctor who said the problem was simply acid reflux caused by foods Richie was eating before going to bed.

Richie became a grandfather in 2008 when Nicole Richie gave birth to a baby girl with Joel Madden, lead singer of the rock band Good Charlotte. Richie&#x27;s second grandchild was born to the couple in 2009.

Richie is a Freemason.

Richie helped to raise over $3.1 million for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Richie told the crowd that his grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer in her 80s, but that she survived and lived until she was 103 years old. He stated that she was his enduring symbol of hope and his reason for becoming a breast cancer activist.

==Awards and honors==

Richie has won four Grammy Awards including Song of the Year in 1985 for &quot;We Are the World&quot; which he co-wrote with Michael Jackson, Album of the Year in 1984 for &quot;Can&#x27;t Slow Down&quot;, Producer of the Year (Non-Classical) in 1984, and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for Truly in 1982.

Richie was the first person to receive an RIAA diamond album award.

Richie has been nominated for two Golden Globe awards and won one. In 1982, he was nominated for Best Original Song for the film &quot;Endless Love&quot;. In 1986, he was nominated and won the award for Best Original Song for the song &quot;Say You, Say Me&quot;, featured in the film &quot;White Nights&quot;. This song also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song.

<doc id="170491" wikidata="Q467557" url="?curid=170491" title="America's Cup">
<text>The America&#x27;s Cup is a sailing competition and the oldest international competition still operating in any sport. America&#x27;s Cup match races are held between two sailing yachts: one from the yacht club that currently holds the trophy (known as the defender) and the other from the yacht club that is challenging for the cup (the challenger). The winner is awarded the America&#x27;s Cup trophy, informally known as the Auld Mug. Matches are held several years apart on dates agreed between the defender and the challenger. There is no fixed schedule, but the races have generally been held every three to four years.

Any yacht club that meets the requirements specified in the Deed of Gift of the America&#x27;s Cup has the right to challenge the yacht club that currently holds the cup. If the challenging club wins the match, it gains stewardship of the cup. From the first defence of the cup in 1870 until the twentieth defence in 1967, there was always only one challenger. In 1970 multiple challengers applied, so a Challenger Selection Series was held to decide which applicant would become the official challenger and compete in the America&#x27;s Cup match. This approach has been used for each subsequent competition.

The history and prestige associated with the America&#x27;s Cup attract the world&#x27;s top sailors, yacht designers, wealthy entrepreneurs, and sponsors. It is a test of sailing skill, boat and sail design, and fundraising and management skills. Competing for the cup is expensive, with modern teams spending more than US$100 million each; the 2013 winner was estimated to have spent US$300 million on the competition.

The most recent 2024 America&#x27;s Cup was held in October 2024 between the challengers, Royal Yacht Squadron&#x27;s INEOS Britannia, and the defending champions, Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron, who won 7-2.

== History ==
The America&#x27;s Cup is the oldest competition in international sport, and the fourth oldest continuous sporting trophy of any kind. The cup itself was manufactured in 1848 and first called the &quot;RYS £100 Cup&quot;. It was first raced for on 22 August 1851 around the Isle of Wight off Southampton and Portsmouth in Hampshire, England, in a fleet race between the New York Yacht Club&#x27;s &quot;America&quot; and 15 yachts of the Royal Yacht Squadron. The race was witnessed by Queen Victoria and the future Edward VII and won by &quot;America&quot;. This is considered to be the first America&#x27;s Cup race.

On 8 July 1857, the surviving members of the &quot;America&quot; syndicate donated the cup to the New York Yacht Club via the Deed of Gift of the America&#x27;s Cup filed with the New York Supreme Court. The deed is the primary instrument that governs the rules to make a valid challenge for the America&#x27;s Cup and the rules of conduct of the races. It states that the cup &quot;is donated upon the condition that it shall be preserved as a perpetual challenge Cup for friendly competition between foreign countries&quot;. The deed also outlines how a foreign yacht club can make a challenge to the holder of the cup and what happens if the clubs do not agree on the conduct of the match. The deed makes it &quot;distinctly understood that the cup is to be the property of the club [that has most recently won a match for the cup], subject to the provisions of this deed, and not the property of the owner or owners of any vessel winning a match&quot;.

The trophy was held by the NYYC from 1857 until 1983. The NYYC successfully defended the trophy 24 times in a row before being defeated by the Royal Perth Yacht Club, represented by the yacht &quot;Australia II&quot;. Including the original 1851 victory, the NYYC&#x27;s 132-year reign was the longest (in terms of time) winning streak in any sport.

Early matches for the cup were raced between yachts on the waterline owned by wealthy sportsmen. This culminated with the J-Class regattas of the 1930s. After World War II and almost twenty years without a challenge, the NYYC made changes to the deed of gift to allow smaller, less expensive 12-metre class yachts to compete; this class was used from 1958 until 1987. It was replaced in 1990 by the International America&#x27;s Cup Class, which was used until 2007.

After a long legal battle, the 2010 America&#x27;s Cup was raced in waterline multihull yachts in Valencia, Spain. The victorious Golden Gate Yacht Club then elected to race the 2013 America&#x27;s Cup in AC72 foiling, wing-sail catamarans and successfully defended the cup. The 2017 America&#x27;s Cup match was sailed in foiling catamarans, after legal battles and disputes over the rule changes.

== The America&#x27;s Cup trophy ==
The Cup, also known as the Auld Mug, is an ornate sterling silver bottomless ewer crafted in 1848 by Garrard &amp; Co. Henry William Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey, bought one and donated it for the Royal Yacht Squadron&#x27;s 1851 Annual Regatta around the Isle of Wight.

The cup was originally known as the &#x27;R.Y.S. £100 Cup&#x27;, awarded in 1851 by the British Royal Yacht Squadron for a race around the Isle of Wight in the United Kingdom. The winning yacht was a schooner called &quot;America&quot;, owned by a syndicate of members from the New York Yacht Club (NYYC). In 1857, the syndicate permanently donated the trophy to the NYYC, under a Deed of Gift that renamed the trophy as the &#x27;America&#x27;s Cup&#x27; after the first winner and required it be made available for perpetual international competition.

It was originally known as the &quot;R.Y.S. £100 Cup&quot;, standing for a cup of a hundred GB Pounds or &quot;sovereigns&quot; in value. The cup was subsequently mistakenly engraved as the &quot;100 Guinea Cup&quot; by the &quot;America&quot; syndicate, but was also referred to as the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Cup&quot; (a guinea is an old monetary unit of one pound and one shilling, now £1.05). Today, the trophy is officially known as the &quot;America&#x27;s Cup&quot; after the 1851 winning yacht, and is affectionately called the &quot;Auld Mug&quot; by the sailing community. It is inscribed with names of the yachts that competed for it, and has been modified twice by adding matching bases to accommodate more names.

== Rules for issuing challenge ==
All challenges for the America&#x27;s Cup are made under the Deed of Gift of the America&#x27;s Cup, which outlines who can challenge for the cup, and what information a challenge must provide to the defender. The deed then allows for most of the arrangements for the match to be made by negotiation and mutual consent, but provides a backstop in the event agreement is not reached. The first valid challenge that is made must be accepted by the defender or it must forfeit the cup to that valid challenger or negotiate other terms.

To be eligible, a challenging club must be &quot;an organized yacht Club&quot; of a country other than the defender’s, which is &quot;incorporated, patented, or licensed by the legislature, admiralty or other executive department&quot;. The club must hold an &quot;annual regatta [on] an ocean water course on the sea, or on an arm of the sea, or one which combines both&quot;. The New York Supreme Court and the New York Court of Appeals have held that this means the challenging club must in fact &quot;have held at least one qualifying annual regatta before it submits its Notice of Challenge to a Defender and demonstrate that it will continue to have qualifying annual regattas on an ongoing basis&quot; and not merely intend to hold its first annual regatta before the envisaged America&#x27;s Cup match. The New York Supreme Court has also found that the Great Lakes between the United States and Canada are arms of the sea, allowing clubs with regattas on those lakes to be challengers.

The challenge document must give dates for the proposed races, which must be no less than 10 months from the date the challenge is made, and within date ranges specified for both the northern and southern hemispheres. The challenge document must also provide information on the yacht, including length on load water line; beam at load water line, and extreme beam; and draught of water. If the yacht has one mast, it must be between on the load water line. If it has more than one mast, it must be between on the load water line. These dimensions may not be exceeded by either challenger or defender. The yachts must be propelled by sails only and be constructed in the country to which the challenging and defending clubs belong. Centreboard or sliding keel vessels are allowed with no restrictions nor limitations, and neither the centre-board nor sliding keel is considered a part of the vessel for any purposes of measurement. As long as these rules are met, the New York Court of Appeals has ruled that the defender may use a boat of a different category to the challenger, such as meeting a challenge in a monohull with a catamaran.

Under the deed, the defender and challenger &quot;may by mutual consent make any arrangement satisfactory to both as to the dates, courses, number of trials, rules and sailing regulations, and any and all other conditions of the match, in which case also the ten months&#x27; notice may be waived&quot;. Since 1958, the practice has usually been for the defender and challenger to agree that the challenger shall be a Challenger of Record, which then arranges a Challenger Series involving a number of other yacht clubs from countries other than that of the defender. The yacht that wins the Challenger Series wins the Herbert Pell Cup and also an associated sponsored cup such as the Prada Cup in 2021 or the Louis Vuitton Cup from 1983 to 2017, and again in 2024.

However, if the challenger and defender cannot agree, the deed provides a backstop, requiring a first-to-two match on ocean courses defined in the deed, at a venue selected by the defender, under its rules and sailing regulations so far as they do not conflict with the provisions of the deed, on the dates submitted by the challenger and in yachts meeting the terms of the deed and the challenge notice.

== In popular culture ==
In 1928, Goodyear chairman Paul W. Litchfield began a tradition of naming the company&#x27;s blimps after America&#x27;s Cup yachts, including &quot;America&quot;, &quot;Puritan&quot;, &quot;Mayflower&quot;, &quot;Volunteer&quot;, &quot;Vigilant&quot;, &quot;Defender&quot;, &quot;Reliance&quot;, &quot;Resolute&quot;, &quot;Enterprise&quot;, &quot;Rainbow&quot;, &quot;Ranger&quot;, &quot;Columbia&quot; and &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes&quot;.

The 1988 parody film Return of the Killer Tomatoes included background TV coverage of &quot;Full Contact America&#x27;s Cup&quot; yacht racing.

The 1992 film &quot;Wind&quot; is largely about the America&#x27;s Cup racing towards the end of the 12-meter era. Although the names have been changed, it is largely about Dennis Conner&#x27;s 1980s loss and comeback.

The documentary &quot;The Wind Gods: 33rd America&#x27;s Cup&quot; (2011) centres around Oracle Team USA&#x27;s efforts to challenge for the 33rd America&#x27;s Cup. David Ellison collaborated with American journalist Julian Guthrie on the film; Guthrie later authored &quot;The Billionaire and the Mechanic&quot;, a non-fiction book detailing the history of Oracle Team USA.

In 2021, Australian psychedelic rock band Pond released a single titled &quot;America&#x27;s Cup&quot;. The song centres around the gentrification of Western Australia and Fremantle, the host city of the 1987 America&#x27;s Cup, after Australia&#x27;s victory of the 1983 America&#x27;s Cup with the yacht Australia II. The music video prominently features the America&#x27;s Cup trophy being &#x27;auctioned&#x27; off to the highest bidder.

In 2022, Netflix released &quot;Untold: &quot;, a film about the Australian team&#x27;s win in the 1983 race.

<doc id="170501" wikidata="Q2794956" url="?curid=170501" title="Productivism">
<text>Productivism or growthism is the belief that measurable productivity and growth are the purpose of human organization (e.g., work), and that &quot;more production is necessarily good&quot;. Critiques of productivism center primarily on the limits to growth posed by a finite planet and extend into discussions of human procreation, the work ethic, and even alternative energy production.

==Arguments for productivism==

Although productivism is often meant pejoratively as a general problem in politics and economics, most countries and economies are productivist in nature. While critics of productivism and its political-economic variants, notably capitalism and socialism, challenge the notions of conventional political economy and argue for an economic policy more compatible with humanity, these views are often dismissed as utopian by economists and political scientists, who hold that there is no conflict between the roles of the worker and the citizen. That is, that conventional economics, particularly macroeconomics, already accounts for the relationship between productivity and the freedom to enjoy that productivity.

==Criticism of productivism==
Anthony Giddens defines productivism as &quot;an ethos in which &#x27;work&#x27;, as paid employment, has been separated out in a clear-cut way from other domains of life&quot;, and further states that work &quot;defines whether or not individuals feel worthwhile or socially valued&quot;. Although &quot;productivism&quot; may be considered to be derisive, as the idea is unacceptable to many of the individuals and ideologies that the term is intended to characterise, these same individuals and ideologies often use phrases like &quot;productivity&quot;, &quot;growth&quot;, &quot;economic sense&quot;, and &quot;common sense&quot; (interchangeably) without argument, presupposing the primacy of industry.&quot;&quot;

According to those who use the term &quot;productivism&quot;, the difference between themselves and the promoters of conventional neoclassical economics is that a productivist does not believe in the idea of &quot;uneconomic growth&quot;. That is, the productivist believes all growth is good, while the critic of productivism believes it can be more like a disease, measurably growing but interfering with life processes, and that it is up to the electorate, worker, and purchaser to put values on their free time and decide whether to use their time for production or their money for consumption. A key academic critic of productivism is Amartya Sen, winner of the 1999 Nobel Prize in Economics. His theory of &quot;development as freedom&quot; is one of several human development theories that state that the growth of individual capital—that is, &quot;talent&quot;, &quot;creativity&quot;, and &quot;personal ingenuity&quot;—is more significant than the growth of many other measurable quantities, such as the production of products for commodity markets. In his essays from 1975, the British economist E. F. Schumacher remarked: &quot;Infinite growth in consumption in a world of finite resources is an impossibility. ... When my child grows, I am pleased. When I grow, less so!&quot;

In the 1990s, the American public was told that the United States would become a nation of educated managers and specialists, with industrial labor outsourced to less fortunate countries. Those countries refused to accept that role and Americans have been vying for the few elite roles that were available ever since. According to Samuel P. Huntington, Americans spend more time at work and have worse benefits when compared to similar rich countries. Sleep, repose, and slacking are often marginalized and the environment suffers as a result of a throw-away-society that is supposed to keep people working. Depression and anxiety rates are higher than they were in the 1980s, perhaps because people are working harder to find great jobs that just are not there. Even free time is supposed to be &quot;about something&quot;, and compete with everyone else&#x27;s on social media.

In the United States, people of lower classes are conditioned to believe in meritocracy, despite class mobility in the country being among the lowest in industrialized economies. In the United States, 50% of a father&#x27;s income position is inherited by his son. In contrast, the amount in Norway or Canada is less than 20%. Moreover, in the U.S. 8% of children raised in the bottom 20% of the income distribution are able to climb to the top 20% as adults, while the figure in Denmark is nearly double at 15%. According to an academic study on why Americans overestimate class mobility, &quot;research indicates that errors in social perception are driven by both informational factors—such as the lack of awareness of statistical information relevant to actual mobility trends—and motivational factors—the desire to believe that society is meritocratic.&quot; Americans are more inclined to believe in meritocracy out of the prospect that they will one day join the elite or upper class. Scholars have paralleled this belief to John Steinbeck&#x27;s notable quote that &quot;the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.” As academic Tad Delay states, &quot;the fantasy of class mobility, of becoming &quot;bourgeois&quot;, is enough to defend the aristocracy.&quot;

People miss the part where it&#x27;s a zero-sum game for good jobs, good friends, and good partners. For some reason, people&#x27;s contentment hinges more on relative wealth than absolute wealth, sometimes referred to as the Easterlin paradox. Jobs were not created to be a way of life, they are just clumps of tasks that would not be performed for free because they are too difficult or too boring. Depression is a taboo because it denounces what society has to offer. Depression also suggests the idea that in a society of winners and losers, the losers often can&#x27;t cope with it, and are simultaneously incapable of becoming winners. The poor are marginalized as are the unemployed for not being productive enough. It’s said that when chased by a bear, you don’t have to outrun the bear; you just have to outrun your friend. Critics have pointed out that “being productive” necessitates unhindered access to the means of production, which people don&#x27;t have.

=== Public assistance ===
Social stigma is prevalent towards recipients of public assistance programs. This includes programs frequently utilized by families struggling with poverty such as Head Start and AFDC (Aid To Families With Dependent Children). The value of self-reliance is often at the center of feelings of shame and the fewer people value self reliance the less stigma affects them psychologically. Stigma towards welfare recipients has been proven to increase passivity and dependency in poor people and has further solidified their status and feelings of inferiority. Caseworkers frequently treat recipients of welfare disrespectfully and make assumptions about deviant behavior and reluctance to work. Many single mothers cited stigma as the primary reason they wanted to exit welfare as quickly as possible. They often feel the need to conceal food stamps to escape judgement associated with welfare programs. Stigma is a major factor contributing to the duration and breadth of poverty in developed societies which largely affects single mothers. Recipients of public assistance are viewed as objects of the community rather than members allowing for them to be perceived as enemies of the community which is how stigma enters collective thought. Amongst single mothers in poverty, lack of health care benefits is one of their greatest challenges in terms of exiting poverty. Traditional values of self reliance increase feelings of shame amongst welfare recipients making them more susceptible to being stigmatized.

<doc id="170503" wikidata="Q7756198" url="?curid=170503" title="The Partridge Family Album">
<text>The Partridge Family Album is the first of eight studio albums by The Partridge Family. The LP was released in October 1970, a month after the debut of the ABC-TV musical sitcom &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; starring Shirley Jones and featuring David Cassidy, both of whom feature on the album, as do studio backing vocalists and session musicians. The success of the album – which in early January 1971 reached no. 4 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top LP&#x27;s chart – was bolstered not only by the hit TV show but by the album&#x27;s one single release, the massive hit &quot;I Think I Love You&quot;, which for three weeks in November and December 1970 topped &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 and which NARM declared best-selling single of 1970.

The album did not chart in the UK – the TV series did not debut in Great Britain until September 1971 – but reached no. 6 in Canada on the &quot;RPM 100&quot; national album chart.

The album was produced by Wes Farrell and engineered by Bob Kovach, with arrangements by Mike Melvoin, Billy Strange, Wes Farrell and Don Peake. As with all of the Partridge Family&#x27;s studio output, the album features musicians associated with iconic Los Angeles–based session players &quot;the Wrecking Crew&quot;: Dennis Budimir, Louie Shelton, Tommy Tedesco, Joe Osborn, Max Bennett, Larry Knechtel, Mike Melvoin and Hal Blaine.

Members of overlapping studio groups the Ron Hicklin Singers and the Love Generation – brothers John and Tom Bahler (also spelled Bähler), Ron Hicklin and Jackie Ward – feature prominently as backing vocalists throughout the album, as they do on all successive Partridge Family albums. Also, their blended harmonies dominate the album&#x27;s two tracks that do not include David Cassidy: &quot;I&#x27;m on the Road&quot; and &quot;I Really Want to Know You&quot;, both written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil. And on &quot;To Be Lovers&quot; they perform the verse, with Cassidy singing only the bridge. Originally the Bahler brothers, Hicklin and Ward were solely responsible for the Partridge Family sound. But with the revelation that David Cassidy could sing professionally, Wes Farrell promoted Cassidy to lead singer.

The album features songs by Tony Romeo, Wes Farrell, songwriting partners Terry Cashman and Tommy West, and afore-mentioned songwriting duo Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil.

The album&#x27;s cover was designed to look like an old-fashioned photo album. The album&#x27;s back cover features a picture of the whole TV family alongside solo portraits of David Cassidy and Shirley Jones. Certain copies included a label promoting the LP&#x27;s inclusion of &quot;I Think I Love You&quot;; this was embedded in the front cover artwork (and not on the protective plastic). The original release of the album included a framed color photograph of the group.

==Track listing==
All tracks from the album were featured in first-season episodes of the TV show. Curiously, the show&#x27;s theme song is nowhere to be found on this album or any of the other original albums, only later surfacing on their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album.

<doc id="170504" wikidata="Q7898127" url="?curid=170504" title="Up to Date">
<text>Up to Date is the second studio album by The Partridge Family. Released in February 1971, just four months after the group&#x27;s debut LP, the album entered &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top LP&#x27;s chart in early April, having been certified gold on 25 March 1971. In its fourth week on the Top 200, the album improved on its predecessor (a no. 4 peak), reaching no. 3 (behind Janis Joplin&#x27;s &quot;Pearl&quot; and &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;).

&quot;Up to Date&quot; yielded the two big pop hits &quot;Doesn&#x27;t Somebody Want to Be Wanted&quot; (&quot;Billboard&quot; no. 6/&quot;Cash Box&quot; number one) and &quot;I&#x27;ll Meet You Halfway&quot; (&quot;Billboard&quot; no. 9), which respectively reached the Top Ten of &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 in March and June.

In Canada, both &quot;Doesn&#x27;t Somebody Want to Be Wanted&quot; and its parent album reached number one on the &quot;RPM&quot; charts.

As with all Partridge Family albums (with the exception of &quot;Bulletin Board&quot;), &quot;Up to Date&quot; was produced by Wes Farrell at United Western Recorders, Studio 2 in Los Angeles. And as with the group&#x27;s first album, it was engineered by Bob Kovach, with arrangements by Mike Melvoin.

Consistent with all of the Partridge Family&#x27;s studio output, the album features musicians associated with iconic Los Angeles–based session players &quot;the Wrecking Crew&quot;: Hal Blaine (drums), Joe Osborn (bass guitar), Mike Melvoin (keyboard), Dennis Budimir (guitar) and Louie Shelton (guitar). And once again, members of overlapping studio groups the Ron Hicklin Singers and the Love Generation – brothers John and Tom Bahler, Ron Hicklin and Jackie Ward – feature prominently as backing vocalists throughout the album.

The album features three songs written by &quot;I Think I Love You&quot; songwriter Tony Romeo, who contributed material to all eight of the Partridge Family&#x27;s studio albums. The LP also includes five songs co-written by Wes Farrell, including three with prolific lyricist Gerry Goffin (former songwriting partner of Carole King). And two of the songs – including the hit &quot;Doesn&#x27;t Somebody Want to Be Wanted&quot; – were co-written by Wes Farrell, Mike Appel and Jim Cretecos, whose five Partridge Family songs as a songwriting trio include &quot;I Can Feel Your Heartbeat&quot;. Between 1972 and 1975 Appel worked as manager and producer for Bruce Springsteen.

&quot;Up to Date&quot; features David Cassidy&#x27;s first contribution as a songwriter. With Wes Farrell he co-wrote the song &quot;Lay It on the Line&quot;. The recording introduced a distorted guitar sound to the group&#x27;s repertoire.

Cassidy publicly despised one of the LP&#x27;s hits, &quot;Doesn&#x27;t Somebody Want to Be Wanted&quot;, and making it proved to be a very hard task. He didn&#x27;t think it was a good song at all and hated the idea of his having to talk in the middle of it so much so he refused to do it. This caused consternation with the studio and the record company, prompting the involvement of the heads of both Bell Records and Screen Gems, which at the time were the respective record and television divisions of the major Hollywood studio Columbia Pictures. Production shooting of the TV series was halted in order to provide a place in time where his manager and agent could talk to him over the issue. One of the things they were saying was about how many more copies of the record would be sold if it contained a speaking role from him. They put pressure on him until he caved in and did the record as requested. When it was finished, he was unsuccessful in trying to keep the record shelved in Bell&#x27;s vaults. His feelings toward the song remained negative: 

The album&#x27;s distinctive cover (overseen by Bell Records art director Beverly Weinstein) was designed in the form of a calendar indicating the birth dates of the family (including dog Simone), which were the actual birth dates of the cast members. The album also included a book cover. This was the last album to feature Jeremy Gelbwaks as Chris Partridge on the cover, as he left the show soon after the album&#x27;s release.

<text>The Partridge Family Sound Magazine is the third studio album by TV-linked pop project The Partridge Family. Released in August 1971 before the start of the second season of the US TV series, it was their third hit album in ten months. In late September 1971, in its fifth week on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top LP&#x27;s chart, the album reached its no. 9 chart peak. In that same week the album&#x27;s one hit single release, &quot;I Woke Up In Love This Morning&quot;, peaked at no. 13 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100. The LP was certified gold that same month. &quot;Sound Magazine&quot; is nearly universally regarded – by both fans and critics – as the Partridge Family&#x27;s consummate pop album.

&quot;Sound Magazine&quot; was the only Partridge Family album to crack the UK Top 20. It peaked at no. 14 in April 1972, coinciding with the chart climb of David Cassidy&#x27;s smash double A-sided UK solo debut hit &quot;Could It Be Forever&quot;/&quot;Cherish&quot; (UK no. 2). The album dropped out of the UK Top 40 in the same late May 1972 week in which both that single and its parent album &quot;Cherish&quot; peaked at no. 2 in their respective charts.

On &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top LP&#x27;s chart, &quot;Sound Magazine&quot; overlapped with the 6 November 1971 – 22 January 1972 Hot 100 chart run of Cassidy&#x27;s US debut solo hit &quot;Cherish&quot; (US no. 9). The album remained in the Top 30 throughout the single&#x27;s chart run, then slipped following the single&#x27;s disappearance from the Hot 100.

Like all of the Partridges&#x27; eight studio albums, the record was produced by Wes Farrell for Coral Rock Productions, and released on Bell Records. Farrell arranged the rhythm tracks, and Mike Melvoin arranged the strings and horns. The disc was engineered by Bob Kovach. As with all of the group&#x27;s releases, the album features some of the era&#x27;s most highly regarded studio musicians, better known as &quot;the Wrecking Crew&quot;: Hal Blaine (drums), Mike Melvoin (piano), Larry Knechtel (piano), Dennis Budimir (guitar), Louie Shelton (guitar) and Max Bennett (bass). And once again members of the Ron Hicklin Singers – brothers John and Tom Bahler, Ron Hicklin and Jackie Ward – feature prominently as backing vocalists throughout the album, with arrangements by John Bahler.

As with most Partridge Family releases, many well-known songwriters contributed songs to the album, including Paul Anka, Rupert Holmes, Tony Romeo and Bobby Hart. The latter had also contributed songs to The Monkees, a similar project that also combined a prime-time television series about a part-fictional/part-real musical group with a series of music albums.

Wes Farrell co-wrote five of the album&#x27;s songs including the final track, &quot;Love Is All That I Ever Needed&quot;, written with lead vocalist David Cassidy. This was Cassidy&#x27;s second composition to feature on a Partridge Family album.

In the mythos of Partridge Family lore, they also recorded a watered-down version of the relatively racy &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Magician&quot;, penned by Irwin Levine and L. Russell Brown. The track was ultimately discarded and never released, although Danny Bonaduce, who played Danny in the TV series, recorded the song for his 1973 solo album.

Cassidy recorded a reworked version of &quot;Sound Magazine&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Summer Days&quot; for his third solo album, &quot;Dreams Are Nuthin&#x27; More Than Wishes&quot; (UK number one, 1973).

The cover of the album was the first to feature child actor Brian Forster, who had replaced Jeremy Gelbwaks as Chris Partridge in the TV series.

In the posthumously broadcast 2018 TV documentary &quot;David Cassidy: The Last Session&quot;, produced by Left/Right Productions for A&amp;E and documenting the star&#x27;s final recording session alongside his struggle with alcoholism, a copy of the LP is seen propped up in the studio close to where Cassidy is recording his vocals.

<text>A Christmas card is a greeting card sent as part of the traditional celebration of Christmas in order to convey between people a range of sentiments related to Christmastide and the holiday season. Christmas cards are usually exchanged during the weeks preceding Christmas Day by many people (including some non-Christians) in Western society and in Asia. The traditional greeting reads &quot;wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year&quot;. There are innumerable variations on this greeting, many cards expressing more religious sentiment, or containing a poem, prayer, Christmas song lyrics or Biblical verse; others focus on the general holiday season with an all-inclusive &quot;Season&#x27;s greetings&quot;. The first modern Christmas card was by John Calcott Horsley.

A Christmas card is generally commercially designed and purchased for the occasion. The content of the design might relate directly to the Christmas narrative with depictions of the Nativity of Jesus, or have Christian symbols such as the Star of Bethlehem or a white dove representing both the Holy Spirit and Peace. Many Christmas cards show Christmas traditions, such as seasonal figures (e.g., Santa Claus, snowmen, and reindeer), objects associated with Christmas such as candles, holly, baubles, and Christmas trees, and Christmastime activities such as shopping, caroling, and partying, or other aspects of the season such as the snow and wildlife of the northern winter. Some secular cards depict nostalgic scenes of the past such as crinolined shoppers in 19th-century streetscapes; others are humorous, particularly in depicting the antics of Santa and his elves.

==History==

The first known Christmas card was sent by Michael Maier to James I of England and his son Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales in 1611. It was discovered in 1979 by Adam McLean in the Scottish Record Office. It was hand-made and incorporated Rosicrucian imagery, with the words of the greeting – &quot;A greeting on the birthday of the Sacred King, to the most worshipful and energetic lord and most eminent James, King of Great Britain and Ireland, and Defender of the true faith, with a gesture of joyful celebration of the Birthday of the Lord, in most joyand fortune, we enter into the new auspicious year 1612&quot; – being laid out to form a rose.

The first commercially available card was commissioned by Sir Henry Cole and designed by John Callcott Horsley in London 1843. The central picture showed three generations of a family raising a toast to the card&#x27;s recipient: on either side were scenes of charity, with food and clothing being given to the poor. Allegedly the image of the family drinking wine together proved controversial, but the idea was shrewd: Cole had helped introduce the Penny Post three years earlier. Two batches totaling 2,050 cards were printed and sold that year for a shilling each.

Early British cards rarely showed winter or religious themes, instead favoring flowers, fairies and other fanciful designs that reminded the recipient of the approach of spring. Humorous and sentimental images of children and animals were popular, as were increasingly elaborate shapes, decorations and materials. At Christmas 1873, the lithograph firm Prang and Mayer began creating greeting cards for the popular market in Britain. The firm began selling the Christmas card in America in 1874, thus becoming the first printer to offer cards in America. Its owner, Louis Prang, is sometimes called the &quot;father of the American Christmas card.&quot; By the 1880s, Prang was producing over five million cards a year by using the chromolithography process of printmaking. However, the popularity of his cards led to cheap imitations that eventually drove him from the market. The advent of the postcard spelled the end for elaborate Victorian-style cards, but by the 1920s, cards with envelopes had returned. The extensive Laura Seddon Greeting Card Collection from the Manchester Metropolitan University gathers 32,000 Victorian and Edwardian greeting cards, printed by the major publishers of the day, including Britain&#x27;s first commercially produced Christmas card.

The production of Christmas cards was, throughout the 20th century, a profitable business for many stationery manufacturers, with the design of cards continually evolving with changing tastes and printing techniques. The now widely recognized brand Hallmark Cards was established in 1913 by Joyce Hall with the help of brother Rollie Hall to market their self-produced Christmas cards. The Hall brothers capitalized on a growing desire for more personalized greeting cards, and reached critical success when the outbreak of World War I increased demand for cards to send to soldiers. The World Wars brought cards with patriotic themes. Idiosyncratic &quot;studio cards&quot; with cartoon illustrations and sometimes risque humor caught on in the 1950s. Nostalgic, sentimental, and religious images have continued in popularity, and, in the 21st century, reproductions of Victorian and Edwardian cards are easy to obtain. Modern Christmas cards can be bought individually but are also sold in packs of the same or varied designs. In recent decades changes in technology may be responsible for the decline of the Christmas card. The estimated number of cards received by American households dropped from 29 in 1987 to 20 in 2004. Email and telephones allow for more frequent contact and are easier for generations raised without handwritten letters – especially given the availability of websites offering free email Christmas cards. Despite the decline, 1.9 billion cards were sent in the U.S. in 2005 alone. Some card manufacturers now provide E-cards. In the UK, Christmas cards account for almost half of the volume of greeting card sales, with over 668.9 million Christmas cards sold in the 2008 festive period.
In mostly non-religious countries (e.g. Czech Republic), the cards are called New Year Cards; they are sent before Christmas and the emphasis (design, texts) is mostly given to the New Year, omitting religious symbols.

===Official Christmas cards===

&quot;Official&quot; Christmas cards began with Queen Victoria in the 1840s. The British royal family&#x27;s cards are generally portraits reflecting significant personal events of the year.

There is a long-standing custom for the American President and First Lady to send White House Christmas Cards each holiday season. The practice originated with President Calvin Coolidge, who was the first president to issue a written statement of peaceful tidings during the holidays in 1927. President Herbert Hoover was the first to give Christmas notes to the White House staff, and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the first president to utilize the card format (rather than the previously used notes or a written statement) that most closely resembles the Christmas cards of today.

In 1953, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued the first official White House Card. The cards usually depict White House scenes as rendered by prominent American artists. The number of recipients has snowballed over the decades, from just 2,000 in 1961 to 1.4 million in 2005.

===Commercial Christmas cards===
Many businesses, from small local businesses to multi-national enterprises, send Christmas cards to the people on their customer lists, as a way to develop general goodwill, retain brand awareness and reinforce social networks. These cards are almost always discrete and secular in design, and do not attempt to sell a product, limiting themselves to mentioning the name of the business. The practice harkens back to trade cards of the 18th century, an ancestor of the modern Christmas card.

In September 1964, it was reported that, during the previous eight years, British industry had increasingly stopped sending &quot;official&quot; Christmas cards, including Granada, ICI, Schweppes, Shell and Unilver.

===Charity Christmas cards===
Many organizations produce special Christmas cards as a fundraising tool. The most famous of these enterprises is probably the UNICEF Christmas card program, launched in 1949, which selects artwork from internationally known artists for card reproduction. The UK-based Charities Advisory Trust used to give out an annual &quot;Scrooge Award&quot; to the cards that return the smallest percentage to the charities they claim to support although it is not universally well received by the Christmas card producers. The RSPB produced the first ever charity Christmas card in 1898, selling 4,500 that year 

===Christmas stamps and stickers===

Many countries produce official Christmas stamps, which may be brightly coloured and depict some aspect of Christmas tradition or a Nativity scene. Small decorative stickers are also made to seal the back of envelopes, typically showing a trinket or some symbol of Christmas.

In 2004, the German post office gave away 20 million free scented stickers, to make Christmas cards smell of a fir Christmas tree, cinnamon, gingerbread, a honey-wax candle, a baked apple and an orange.

===Collectors items===
From the beginning, Christmas cards have been avidly collected. Queen Mary amassed a large collection that is now housed in the British Museum. The University College London&#x27;s Slade School of Fine Art houses a collection of handmade Christmas Cards from alumni such as Paula Rego and Richard Hamilton and are displayed at events over the Christmas season, when members of the public can make their own Christmas cards in the Strang Print Room. Specimens from the &quot;golden age&quot; of printing (1840s–1890s) are especially prized and bring in large sums at auctions. In December 2005, one of Horsley&#x27;s original cards sold for nearly £9,000. Collectors may focus on particular images like Santa Claus, poets, or printing techniques. The Christmas card that holds the world record as the most expensive ever sold was a card produced in 1843 by J. C. Horsley and commissioned by civil servant Sir Henry Cole. The card, one of the world&#x27;s first, was sold in 2001 by UK auctioneers Henry Aldridge to an anonymous bidder for a record breaking £22,250.

===Home-made cards===

Since the 19th century, many families and individuals have chosen to make their own Christmas cards, either in response to monetary necessity, as an artistic endeavour, or in order to avoid the commercialism associated with Christmas cards. With a higher preference of handmade gifts during the 19th century over purchased or commercial items, homemade cards carried high sentimental value as gifts alone. Many families make the creation of Christmas cards a family endeavour and part of the seasonal festivity, along with stirring the Christmas cake and decorating the tree. Over the years such cards have been produced in every type of paint and crayon, in collage and in simple printing techniques such as potato-cuts. A revival of interest in paper crafts, particularly scrapbooking, has raised the status of the homemade card and made available an array of tools for stamping, punching, and cutting.

Advances in digital photography and printing have provided the technology for many people to design and print their own cards, using their original graphic designs or photos, or those available with many computer programs or online as clip art, as well as a great range of typefaces. Such homemade cards include personal touches such as family photos and holidays snapshots. Crowdsourcing, another trend enabled by the Internet, has allowed thousands of independent and hobbyist graphic designers to produce and distribute holiday cards around the world.

==The Christmas card list==
Many people send cards to both close friends and distant acquaintances, potentially making the sending of cards a multi-hour chore in addressing dozens or even hundreds of envelopes. The greeting in the card can be personalized but brief, or may include a summary of the year&#x27;s news. The extreme of this is the Christmas letter (below). Because cards are usually exchanged year after year, the phrase &quot;to be off someone&#x27;s Christmas card list&quot; is used to indicate a falling out between friends or public figures.

===Christmas letters===

Some people take the annual mass-mailing of cards as an opportunity to update those they know with the year&#x27;s events, and include the so-called &quot;Christmas letter&quot; reporting on the family&#x27;s doings, sometimes running to multiple printed pages. In the UK these are known as round-robin letters. While a practical notion, Christmas letters meet with a mixed reception; recipients may take it as boring minutiae, bragging, or a combination of the two, whereas other people appreciate Christmas letters as more personal than mass-produced cards with a generic missive and an opportunity to &quot;catch up&quot; with the lives of family and friends who are rarely seen or communicated with. Since the letter will be received by both close and distant relatives, there is also the potential for the family members to object to how they are presented to others; an entire episode of &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; was built around conflict over the content of just such a letter.

==Environmental impact and recycling==
During the first 70 years of the 19th century it was common for Christmas and other greeting cards to be recycled by women&#x27;s service organizations who collected them and removed the pictures, to be pasted into scrap books for the entertainment of children in hospitals, orphanages, kindergartens and missions. With children&#x27;s picture books becoming cheaper and more readily available, this form of scrap-booking has almost disappeared.

Recent concern over the environmental impact of printing, mailing and delivering cards has fueled an increase in e-cards.

The U.K. conservation charity Woodland Trust runs an annual campaign to collect and recycle Christmas cards to raise awareness of recycling and collect donations from corporate sponsors and supporters. All recycled cards help raise money to plant more trees. In the 12 years that the Woodland Trust Christmas Card Recycling Scheme has been running, more than 600 million cards have been recycled. This has enabled the Woodland Trust to plant more than 141,000 trees, save over 12,000 tonnes of paper from landfill and stop over 16,000 tonnes of CO2 from going into the atmosphere – the equivalent to taking more than 5,000 cars off the road for a year. The scheme has had celebrity supporters including Jo Brand, Dermot O&#x27; Leary and Sean Bean and is the longest running scheme of its type in the country.

==International Christmas greetings==

<text>Shopping Bag is the fifth studio album by TV-linked pop project The Partridge Family. Released in March 1972, just as the second season of the TV series was finishing in North America, the album entered &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top LP&#x27;s chart in late March, peaking at no. 18 in late April. The album remained in the Top 200 for 17 weeks and was certified gold. The vinyl release of the album contained a novelty plastic shopping bag.

Consistent with all of the Partridges&#x27; eight studio albums, the record was produced by Wes Farrell for Coral Rock Productions, and released on Bell Records. Farrell arranged the rhythm tracks, and Mike Melvoin arranged the strings and horns. The disc was engineered by Bob Kovach, with assistant engineer Winston Wong. As with all of the group&#x27;s releases, the album features some of the era&#x27;s most highly regarded studio musicians, better known as &quot;the Wrecking Crew&quot;: Hal Blaine (drums), Mike Melvoin (keyboards), Dennis Budimir (guitar), Louie Shelton (guitar), Larry Carlton (guitar), Tommy Tedesco (guitar) and Max Bennett (bass). And once again members of the Ron Hicklin Singers – brothers John and Tom Bahler, Ron Hicklin and Jackie Ward – feature prominently as backing vocalists throughout the album, with arrangements by John Bahler.

As with most Partridge Family releases, several known songwriters contributed songs to the album including duo Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart – best known for major hits written for The Monkees, a similar project which also combined a prime-time television series about a part-fictional/part-real musical group with a series of music albums – and two other songwriting duos: Irwin Levine and L. Russell Brown (&quot;Knock Three Times&quot;, &quot;Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree&quot;), and Terry Cashman and Tommy West. Producer Wes Farrell co-wrote four of the album’s songs, and &quot;Shopping Bag &quot;’s one big hit single, It&#x27;s One of Those Nights (Yes Love) (US no. 20/UK no. 11), was written by Tony Romeo, who had written the Partridge Family’s signature hit, the 1970 US number one I Think I Love You&quot;.

The album’s one other US single release, “Am I Losing You”, stalled at no 59, with seven weeks on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100.

Lead singer David Cassidy contributed one song, &quot;There&#x27;ll Come a Time&quot; – his third composition to feature on a Partridge Family album. It was also his last, as Cassidy&#x27;s later songwriting efforts all would be reserved for his solo albums. 1972 was a watershed year for Cassidy in terms of his phenomenal solo career in the UK, where “It’s One of Those Nights (Yes Love)” was the first of four consecutive major Partridge Family hits, coinciding with even bigger UK solo hits for Cassidy during 1972 and 1973.

<text>A notebook (also known as a notepad, writing pad, drawing pad, or legal pad) is a book or stack of paper pages that are often ruled and used for purposes such as note-taking, journaling or other writing, drawing, or scrapbooking and more.
== History ==

=== Early times ===
The earliest form of notebook was the wax tablet, which was used as a reusable and portable writing surface in classical antiquity and throughout the Middle Ages. 

As paper became more readily available in European countries from the 11th century onwards, wax tablets gradually fell out of use, although they remained relatively common in England, which did not possess a commercially successful paper mill until the late 16th century. 

==== As table-books ====
While paper was cheaper than wax, its cost was sufficiently high to ensure the popularity of erasable notebooks, made of specially-treated paper that could be wiped clean and used again. These were commonly known as table-books, and are frequently referenced in Renaissance literature, most famously in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;: &quot;My tables,—meet it is I set it down, That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain.&quot;Despite the apparent ubiquity of such table-books in Shakespeare&#x27;s time, very few examples have survived, and little is known about their exact nature, use, or history of production. The earliest extant edition, bound together with a printed almanac, was made in Antwerp, Belgium, in 1527. 

By the end of this decade, table-books were being imported into England, and they were being printed in London from the 1570s. 

At this time, however, it appears that the concept of an erasable notebook was still something of a novelty to the British public, as the printed instructions included with some books were headed: &quot;To make clean your Tables when they be written on, which to some as yet is unknown.&quot; The leaves of some table-books were made of donkey skin; others had leaves of ivory or simple pasteboard. The coating was made from a mixture of glue and gesso, and modern-day experiments have shown that ink, graphite and silverpoint writing can be easily erased from the treated pages with the application of a wet sponge or fingertip.

Other types of notebook may also have been in circulation during this time; 17th-century writer Samuel Hartlib describes a table-book made of slate, which did &quot;not need such tedious wiping out by or &quot;.

The leaves of a table-book could be written upon with a stylus, which added to their convenience, as it meant that impromptu notes could be taken without the need for an inkwell (graphite pencils were not in common use until the late 17th century). Table-books were owned by all classes of people, from merchants to nobles, and were employed for a variety of purposes:

The use of table-books for trivial purposes was often satirized on the English stage. For example, &quot;Antonio&#x27;s Revenge&quot; by John Marston (c. 1600) contains the following exchange:
Their use in some contexts was seen as pretentious; Joseph Hall, writing in 1608, describes &quot;the hypocrite&quot; as one who, &quot;in the midst of the sermon pulls out his tables in haste, as if he feared to lose that note&quot;. The practice of making notes during sermons was a common subject of ridicule, and led to table-books becoming increasingly associated with Puritanism during the 17th century.

By the early 19th century, there was far less demand for erasable notebooks, due to the mass-production of fountain pens and the development of cheaper methods for manufacturing paper. Ordinary paper notebooks became the norm. During the Enlightenment, British schoolchildren were commonly taught how to make their own notebooks out of loose sheets of paper, a process that involved folding, piercing, gathering, sewing and/or binding the sheets.

=== Legal pad ===

According to a legend, Thomas W. Holley of Holyoke, Massachusetts, invented the legal pad around the year 1888 when he innovated the idea to collect all the sortings, various sorts of sub-standard paper scraps from various factories, and stitch them together in order to sell them as pads at an affordable and fair price. 

In about 1900, the latter then evolved into the modern, traditionally yellow legal pad when a local judge requested for a margin to be drawn on the left side of the paper. This was the first legal pad. 

The only technical requirement for this type of stationery to be considered a true &quot;legal pad&quot; is that it must have margins of 1.25 inches (3.17 centimeters) from the left edge. Here, the margin, also known as down lines, is room used to write notes or comments. 

Legal pads usually have a gum binding at the top instead of a spiral or stitched binding.

In 1902, J.A. Birchall of Birchalls, a stationery shop based in Launceston, Tasmania, Australia, decided that the cumbersome method of selling writing paper in folded stacks of &quot;quires&quot; (four sheets of paper or parchment folded to form eight leaves) was inefficient. 

As a solution, he glued together a stack of halved sheets of paper, supported by a sheet of cardboard, creating what he called the &quot;Silver City Writing Tablet&quot;.

== Structures ==

=== Binding ===
Principal types of binding are padding, perfect, spiral, comb, sewn, clasp, disc, and pressure, some of which can be combined. Binding methods can affect whether a notebook can lie flat when open and whether the pages are likely to remain attached. 

It is frequently cheaper to purchase notebooks that are spiral-bound, meaning that a spiral of wire is looped through large perforations at the top or side of the page. Other bound notebooks are available that use glue to hold the pages together; this process is &quot;padding.&quot; 

=== Covers ===
The cover material is usually distinct from the writing surface material, more durable, more decorative, and more firmly attached. 

It also is stiffer than the pages, even taken together. Cover materials should not contribute to damage or discomfort.

=== Preprinting ===
Notebooks used for drawing and scrapbooking are usually blank. 

Notebooks for writing usually have some kind of printing on the writing material, if only lines to align writing or facilitate certain kinds of drawing. Many notebooks also have graphic decorations. 

Inventor&#x27;s notebooks have page numbers preprinted to support priority claims which may be considered as grey literature. 

Personal organizers can have various kinds of preprinted pages.

=== Variations ===
Today, it is common for pages in such notebooks to include a thin line of perforations that make it easier to tear out the page. 

Spiral-bound pages can be torn out, but frequently leave thin scraggly strips from the small amount of paper that is within the spiral, as well as an uneven rip along the top of the torn-out page. 

Hard-bound notebooks include a sewn spine, and the pages are not easily removed. Some styles of sewn bindings allow pages to open flat, while others cause the pages to drape.

Variations of notebooks that allow pages to be added, removed, and replaced are bound by rings, rods, or discs. In each of these systems, the pages are modified with perforations that facilitate the specific binding mechanism&#x27;s ability to secure them. 

Ring-bound and rod-bound notebooks secure their contents by threading perforated pages around straight or curved prongs. In the open position, the pages can be removed and rearranged. In the closed position, the pages are kept in order. 

Disc-bound notebooks remove the open or closed operation by modifying the pages themselves. A page perforated for a disc-bound binding system contains a row of teeth along the side edge of the page that grip onto the outside raised perimeter of individual discs.

== Uses ==
There are many different types of notebooks which often determines its use. 

Artists often use sketchbooks which include wide spaces of blank paper appropriate for drawing. They may also use thicker paper if painting or using a variety of mediums in their work. Although large, artists&#x27; notebooks also are usually considerably light, because they usually take their notebooks with them everywhere to draw scenery. 

Similarly, composers utilize notebooks for writing their lyrics. Lawyers use rather large notebooks known as legal pads that contain lined paper (often yellow) and are appropriate for use on tables and desks. These horizontal lines or &quot;rules&quot; are sometimes classified according to their space apart with &quot;wide rule&quot; the farthest, &quot;college rule&quot; closer, &quot;legal rule&quot; slightly closer and &quot;narrow rule&quot; closest, allowing more lines of text per page. When sewn into a pasteboard backing, these may be called composition books, or in smaller signatures may be called &quot;blue books&quot; or exam books and used for essay exams.

Various notebooks are popular among students for taking notes. The types of notebooks used for school work are single line, double line, four line, square grid line etc. These notebooks are also used by students for school assignments (homeworks) and writing projects.

In contrast, journalists prefer small, hand-held notebooks for portability (reporters&#x27; notebooks), and sometimes use shorthand when taking notes. Scientists and other researchers use lab notebooks to document their experiments. The pages in lab notebooks are sometimes graph paper to plot data. Police officers are required to write notes on what they observe, using a police notebook. Land surveyors commonly record field notes in durable, hard-bound notebooks called &quot;field books.&quot;

Coloring enthusiasts use coloring notebooks for stress relief. The pages in coloring notebooks contain different adult coloring pages. Students take notes in notebooks, and studies suggest that the act of writing (as opposed to typing) improves learning.

Notebook pages can be recycled via standard paper recycling. Recycled notebooks are available, differing in recycled percentage and paper quality.

== Electronic successors ==
Since the late 20th century, many attempts have been made to integrate the simplicity of a notebook with the editing, searching, and communication capacities of computers through the development of note taking software. 

Laptop computers began to be called &quot;notebooks&quot; when they reached a small size in the mid-1990s. Personal digital assistants (PDAs) came next, integrating small liquid crystal displays with a touch-sensitive layer to input graphics and written text. Later on, this role was taken over by smartphones and tablets.

Digital paper combines the simplicity of a traditional pen and notebook with digital storage and interactivity. By printing an invisible dot pattern on the notebook paper and using a pen with a built in infrared camera the written text can be transferred to a laptop, mobile phone or back office for storage and processing.

<text>Crossword Puzzle is the seventh and penultimate studio album by The Partridge Family. Released in June 1973, it was the last Partridge Family album to chart in the US, entering &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top LP&#x27;s chart in July and peaking at no. 167 in its second of just five weeks in the Top 200. Bell Records, losing faith in the group after oversaturating the market with product, chose not to release a US single from the album, though &quot;Sunshine&quot; was released as a single in Japan.

The LP cover featured a crossword puzzle, with the answers given inside on one side of the dust sleeve. As with previous release &quot;The Partridge Family Notebook&quot;, the American album cover of &quot;Crossword Puzzle&quot; included no group photo, but did feature small black-and-white photos of Shirley Jones (at left) and David Cassidy (at right).

In 2003 the album was released on CD on Arista&#x27;s BMG Heritage Records label.

All tracks, except &quot;It&#x27;s A Long Way To Heaven&quot;, &quot;Now That You Got Me Where You Want Me&quot; and &quot;Let Your Love Go&quot;, were featured on the TV show (mainly from Season 3).

<doc id="170510" wikidata="Q4996828" url="?curid=170510" title="Bulletin Board (album)">
<text>Bulletin Board is the eighth and final studio album by The Partridge Family, released by Bell Records (catalog number 1137) in October 1973. The album was recorded between July and September 1973. &quot;Bulletin Board&quot; was the first Partridge Family album to fail to chart on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top LP&#x27;s chart. &quot;Looking for a Good Time&quot; b/w &quot;Money Money&quot; was released as a single in November 1973 (catalog number Bell 45-414), but failed to chart. This was the last regular U.S. Partridge Family single.

The album cover featured a handwritten track listing pinned to a bulletin board, as well as a &quot;family&quot; photograph and a memo detailing the show&#x27;s new Saturday night time slot. According to the liner notes for the CD release, the album cover was created within only a few hours due to time constraints. While Wes Farrell is credited as producer on the album, in fact it was produced and arranged by John Bahler (also spelled as Bähler), a member of late-1960 pop group the Love Generation and, later, the Ron Hicklin Singers, several members of whom provided backing vocals on all of the Partridge Family albums. &quot;Bulletin Board&quot; is the only Partridge Family album recorded in a studio different from the preceding albums (which had all been recorded at Western Recorders, Studio 2 in Los Angeles).

Reviewer Dave Thompson of AllMusic gave the album a rating of 3½ stars out of 5, claiming it was more representative of David Cassidy&#x27;s solo material than the typical Partridge Family album: &quot;the performances all lean a lot closer towards the Cassidy solo ideal – soft ballads, tight rockers – than the all-for-one harmonies and joy that characterized the Partridges&#x27; earlier releases.&quot; Howard Pattow, a member of the Partridge Family tribute band Sound Magazine, states that &quot;the music here is groovy and funky, a definite reflection of pop music&#x27;s embrace of disco ... overall, the music on &quot;Bulletin Board&quot; is quite different from previous Partridge Family efforts ... [and] features musicians that had previously not appeared on a Partridge record.&quot;

In September 2008 Collectors&#x27; Choice Music reissued the album on CD. Initially the disc was available exclusively through the company&#x27;s website. The disc contains two bonus tracks: both sides of the Bones Howe-produced Shirley Jones single &quot;Ain&#x27;t Love Easy&quot;/&quot;Roses in the Snow&quot;, originally released in October 1972.

<text>The Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN; ; ) composed the ground forces of the South Vietnamese military from its inception in 1955 to the Fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975. Its predecessor was the ground forces of the Vietnamese National Army, established on 8 December 1950, represeting Vietnam to fight in the First Indochina War against the communist Viet Minh rebels. At the ARVN&#x27;s peak, an estimated 1 in 9 citizens of South Vietnam were enlisted, composed of Regular Forces and the more voluntary Regional Forces and the Popular Force militias. It is estimated to have suffered 1,394,000 casualties (killed and wounded) during the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Casualties - US vs NVA/VC&quot;&gt;Casualties – US vs NVA/VC (Archive)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ARVN began as a post-colonial army that was trained by and closely affiliated with the United States and had engaged in conflict since its inception. Several changes occurred throughout its lifetime, initially from a &#x27;blocking-force&#x27; to a more modern conventional force using helicopter deployment in combat. During the American intervention in Vietnam, the ARVN was reduced to playing a defensive role with an incomplete modernisation, and transformed again following Vietnamization, it was upgeared, expanded, and reconstructed to fulfill the role of the departing American forces. By 1974, it had become much more effective with foremost counterinsurgency expert and Nixon adviser Robert Thompson noting that Regular Forces were very well-trained and second only to the American and Israeli forces in the Free World and with General Creighton Abrams remarking that 70% of units were on par with the United States Army.

However, the withdrawal of American forces by Vietnamization meant the armed forces could not effectively fulfill all of the aims of the program and had become completely dependent on U.S. equipment since it was meant to fulfill the departing role of the United States. Unique in serving a dual military-civilian administrative purpose, in direct competition with the Viet Cong, the ARVN had also become a component of political power and suffered from continual issues of political loyalty appointments, corruption in leadership, factional infighting, and occasional open internal conflict.

After the fall of Saigon to North Vietnam&#x27;s People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN), the ARVN was dissolved. While some high-ranking officers had fled the country to the United States or elsewhere, thousands of former ARVN officers were sent to re-education camps by the communist government of the unified Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Five ARVN generals died by suicide to avoid capture.

==History==

===Vietnamese National Army (VNA) 1949–55===


On 8 March 1949, after signing the Élysée Accords, the State of Vietnam was recognized by France as an independent country ruled by the Vietnamese Emperor Bảo Đại, and the Vietnamese National Army (VNA) was soon created on 8 December 1950. The VNA fought in joint operations with the French Union&#x27;s French Far East Expeditionary Corps against the communist Viet Minh forces led by Ho Chi Minh. The VNA fought in a wide range of campaigns including the Battle of Nà Sản (1952), Operation Atlas (1953) and the Battle of Dien Bien Phu (1954).

Benefiting from French assistance, the VNA quickly became a modern army modeled after the Expeditionary Corps. It included infantry, artillery, signals, armored cavalry, airborne, airforce, navy and a national military academy. By 1953, troopers as well as officers were all Vietnamese, the latter having been trained in &quot;Ecoles des Cadres&quot; such as Da Lat, including Chief of Staff General Nguyễn Văn Hinh who was a French Union airforce veteran.

After the 1954 Geneva agreements, French Indochina ceased to exist and by 1956 all French Union troops had withdrawn from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. In 1955, by the order of Prime Minister Diệm, the VNA crushed the armed forces of the Bình Xuyên.

===Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 1955–75===

On 26 October 1955, the military was reorganized by the President Ngô Đình Diệm who declared the republic in the State of Vietnam. The air force was established as a separate service known as the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF). Early on, the focus of the army was the guerrilla fighters of the Viet Cong (VC), formed to oppose the Diệm administration. The United States, under President John F. Kennedy sent advisors and a great deal of financial support to aid the ARVN in combating the insurgents. A major campaign, developed by Ngô Đình Nhu and later resurrected under another name was the &quot;Strategic Hamlet Program&quot; which was regarded as unsuccessful by Western media because it was &quot;inhumane&quot; to move villagers from the countryside to fortified villages. ARVN leaders and Diệm were criticized by the foreign press when the troops were used to crush armed anti-government religious groups like the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo as well as to raid Buddhist temples, which according to Diệm, were harboring VC guerrillas. The most notorious of these attacks occurred on the night of August 21, 1963, during the Xá Lợi Pagoda raids conducted by the ARVN Special Forces, which caused a death toll estimated to range into the hundreds.

In 1963, Diệm was killed in a coup d&#x27;état carried out by ARVN officers and encouraged by American officials such as Henry Lodge. In the confusion that followed, General Dương Văn Minh took control, but he was only the first in a succession of ARVN generals to assume the presidency of South Vietnam. During these years, the United States began taking more control of the war against the VC and the role of the ARVN became less and less significant. They were also plagued by continuing problems of severe corruption amongst the officer corps. Although the United States was highly critical of the ARVN, it continued to be entirely U.S.-armed and funded.

Although the American news media has often portrayed the Vietnam War as a primarily American and North Vietnamese conflict, the ARVN carried the brunt of the fight before and after large-scale American involvement, and participated in many major operations with American troops. ARVN troops pioneered the use of the M113 armored personnel carrier as an infantry fighting vehicle by fighting mounted rather than as a &quot;battle taxi&quot; as originally designed, and the armored cavalry (ACAV) modifications were adopted based on ARVN experience. One notable ARVN unit equipped with M113s, the 3d Armored Cavalry Squadron, used the new tactic so proficiently and with such extraordinary heroism against hostile forces that they earned the United States Presidential Unit Citation. The ARVN suffered 254,256 recorded deaths between 1960 and 1974, with the highest number of recorded deaths being in 1972, with 39,587 combat deaths, while approximately 58,000 U.S. troops died during the war.

United States experience with the ARVN generated a catalog of complaints about its performance, with various officials saying &#x27;it did not pull its weight,&#x27; &#x27;content to let the Americans do the fighting and dying,&#x27; and &#x27;weak in dedication, direction, and discipline.&#x27; The President remained prone to issue instructions directly to field units, cutting across the entire chain of command. Major shortcomings identified by U.S. officers included a general lack of motivation, indicated, for example, by officers having an inclination for rear area jobs rather than combat command, and a continuing desertion problem.

===Final campaigns===
Starting in 1969, President Richard Nixon started the process of &quot;Vietnamization&quot;, pulling out American forces and rendering the ARVN capable of fighting an effective war against the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and VC. Slowly, the ARVN began to expand from its counter-insurgency role to become the primary ground defense against the PAVN/VC. From 1969 to 1971, there were about 22,000 ARVN combat deaths per year. Starting in 1968, South Vietnam began calling up every available man for service in the ARVN, reaching a strength of one million soldiers by 1972. In 1970, they performed well in the Cambodian Incursion and were executing three times as many operations as they had during the American-led war period. However, the ARVN equipment continued to be of lower standards than their American and other allies, even as the U.S. tried to upgrade ARVN technology. The officer corps was still the biggest problem. Leaders were too often inept, being poorly trained, corrupt and lacking morale. Still, Sir Robert Thompson, a British military officer widely regarded as the worlds foremost expert in counterinsurgency warfare during the Vietnam War, thought that by 1972, the ARVN had developed into one of the best fighting forces in the world, comparing them favorably with the Israeli Defence Forces. Forced to carry the burden left by the Americans, the ARVN started to perform well, though with continued American air support.

In 1972, the PAVN launched the Easter Offensive, an all-out attack against South Vietnam across the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone and from its sanctuaries in Laos and Cambodia. The assault combined infantry wave assaults, artillery and the first massive use of armored forces by the PAVN. Although the T-54 tanks proved vulnerable to LAW rockets, the ARVN took heavy losses. The PAVN forces took Quảng Trị Province and some areas along the Laos and Cambodian borders. U.S. general Creighton Abrams fumed at ARVN complaints that they lacked arms and equipment. He said: &quot;“The ARVN haven’t lost their tanks because the enemy tanks knocked them out. The ARVN lost their tanks because goddamn it, they abandoned them. And, shit, if they had the Josef Stalin 3 [tank], it wouldn’t have been any better.”&quot; He likewise harangued President Thieu and Saigon’s chief of staff Cao Van Vien: &quot;“Equipment is not what you need. You need men that will fight... You’ve got all the equipment you need... You lost most of your artillery because it was abandoned.”&quot;

President Nixon dispatched bombers in Operation Linebacker to provide air support for the ARVN when it seemed that South Vietnam was about to be lost. In desperation, President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu fired the incompetent General Hoàng Xuân Lãm and replaced him with General Ngô Quang Trưởng. He gave the order that all deserters would be executed and pulled enough forces together in order to prevent the PAVN from taking Huế. Finally, with considerable US air and naval support, as well as hard fighting by the ARVN soldiers, the Easter Offensive was halted. ARVN forces counter-attacked and succeeded in driving some of the PAVN out of South Vietnam, though they did retain control of northern Quảng Trị Province near the DMZ.

At the end of 1972, Operation Linebacker II helped achieve a negotiated end to the war between the U.S. and the Hanoi government. By March 1973, in accordance with the Paris Peace Accords the United States had completely pulled its troops out of Vietnam. The ARVN was left to fight alone, but with all the weapons and technologies that their allies left behind. With massive technological support they had roughly four times as many heavy weapons as their enemies. The U.S. left the ARVN with over one thousand aircraft, making the RVNAF the fourth largest air force in the world. These figures are deceptive, however, as the U.S. began to curtail military aid. The same situation happened to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, since their allies, the Soviet Union, and China has also cut down military support, forcing them to use obsolete T-34 tanks and SU-100 tank destroyers in battle.

In the summer of 1974, Nixon resigned under the pressure of the Watergate scandal and was succeeded by Gerald Ford. With the war growing incredibly unpopular at home, combined with a severe economic recession and mounting budget deficits, Congress cut funding to South Vietnam for the upcoming fiscal year from 1 billion to 700 million dollars. Historians have attributed the fall of Saigon in 1975 to the cessation of American aid along with the growing disenchantment of the South Vietnamese people and the rampant corruption and incompetence of South Vietnam political leaders and ARVN general staff.

Without the necessary funds and facing a collapse in South Vietnamese troop and civilian morale, it was becoming increasingly difficult for the ARVN to achieve a victory against the PAVN. Moreover, the withdrawal of U.S. aid encouraged North Vietnam to begin a new military offensive against South Vietnam. This resolve was strengthened when the new American administration did not think itself bound to this promise Nixon made to Thieu of a &quot;severe retaliation&quot; if Hanoi broke the 1973 Paris Peace Accords.

The fall of Huế to PAVN forces on 26 March 1975 began an organized rout of the ARVN that culminated in the complete disintegration of the South Vietnamese government. Withdrawing ARVN forces found the roads choked with refugees making troop movement almost impossible. North Vietnamese forces took advantage of the growing instability, and with the abandoned equipment of the routing ARVN, they mounted heavy attacks on all fronts. With collapse all but inevitable, many ARVN generals abandoned their troops to fend for themselves and ARVN soldiers deserted &quot;en masse&quot;. The 18th Division held out at Xuân Lộc from 9 to 21 April before being forced to withdraw. President Thiệu resigned his office on 21 April and left the country. At Bien Hoa, ARVN soldiers made a strong resistance against PAVN forces, however, ARVN defenses at Cu Chi and Hoc Mon start to collapse under the overwhelming PAVN attacks. In the Mekong Delta and Phu Quoc Island, many of ARVN soldiers were aggressive and intact to prevent VC taking over any provincial capitals. Less than a month after Huế, Saigon fell and South Vietnam ceased to exist as a political entity. The sudden and complete destruction of the ARVN shocked the world. Even their opponents were surprised at how quickly South Vietnam collapsed.

Five ARVN generals died by suicide during late April to avoid capture by the PAVN/VC and potential reeducation camps. General Le Nguyen Vy died via suicide in Lai Khe shortly after hearing Duong Van Minh surrender from the radio. Both ARVN generals in Can Tho, Le Van Hung and Nguyen Khoa Nam, took his own life after deciding not to prolong resistance against outnumbered PAVN/VC soldiers in Mekong Region. Brigadier General Tran Van Hai took his own life by poison at Dong Tam Base Camp. General Pham Van Phu died by suicide at a hospital in Saigon.

The U.S. had provided the ARVN with 793,994 M1 carbines, 220,300 M1 Garands and 520 M1C/M1D rifles, 640,000 M-16 rifles, 34,000 M79 grenade launchers, 40,000 radios, 20,000 quarter-ton trucks, 214 M41 Walker Bulldog light tanks, 77 M577 Command tracks (command version of the M113 APC), 930 M113 (APC/ACAVs), 120 V-100s (wheeled armored cars), and 190 M48 tanks. Operations Enhance and Enhance Plus an American effort in November 1972 managed to transfer 59 more M48A3 Patton tanks, 100 additional M-113A1 ACAVs (Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicles), and over 500 extra aircraft to South Vietnam. Despite such impressive figures, the Vietnamese were not as well equipped as the American infantrymen they replaced. The 1972 offensive had been driven back only with a massive American bombing campaign against North Vietnam.

The Case–Church Amendment had effectively nullified the Paris Peace Accords, and as a result the United States had cut aid to South Vietnam drastically in 1974, just months before the final enemy offensive, allowing North Vietnam to invade South Vietnam without fear of U.S. military action. As a result, only a little fuel and ammunition were being sent to South Vietnam. South Vietnamese air and ground vehicles were immobilized by lack of spare parts. Troops went into battle without batteries for their radios, and their medics lacked basic supplies. South Vietnamese rifles and artillery pieces were rationed to three rounds of ammunition per day in the last months of the war. The ARVN forces were quickly thrown into chaos and defeated by the PAVN, no longer having to worry about U.S. bombing.

The victorious Communists sent over 250,000 ARVN soldiers to prison camps. Prisoners were incarcerated for periods ranging from weeks to 18 years. The communists called these prison camps &quot;reeducation camps&quot;. The Americans and South Vietnamese had laid large minefields during the war, and former ARVN soldiers were made to clear them. Thousands died from sickness and starvation and were buried in unmarked graves. The South Vietnamese national military cemetery was vandalized and abandoned, and a mass grave of ARVN soldiers was made nearby. The charity &quot;The Returning Casualty&quot; in the early 2000s attempted to excavate and identify remains from some camp graves and restore the cemetery. Reporter Morley Safer who returned in 1989 and saw the poverty of a former soldier described the ARVN as &quot;that wretched army that was damned by the victors, abandoned by its allies, and royally and continuously screwed by its commanders&quot;.

==Formations and units==
The 1956 army structure of four conventional infantry divisions (8,100 each) and six light divisions (5,800 each) were reorganised according to American advice as seven full infantry divisions (10,450 each) and three corps headquarters by September 1959. The three armed services together numbered around 137,000 in 1960. In face of the communist threat, the army was expanded to 192,000 with four corps, nine divisions, one airborne brigade, one SF group, three separate regiments, one territorial regiment, 86 ranger companies, and 19 separate battalions, as well as support units in 1963, and a force strength of 355,135 in 1970. Meanwhile, the supporting militia forces grew from a combined initial size of 116,000 in 1956, declined to 86,000 in 1959, and then were pushed up to 218,687 RF &amp; 179,015 PF in 1970. The effect of expanding the total land force from about 220,000 in 1960 to around 750,000 in 1970 can be imagined, along with the troop quality issues that resulted.

<text>, literally &quot;brown hair&quot; in the Japanese language, is a style of bleaching (and occasionally dyeing) hair, found among Japanese teens. The style was once banned at Japanese schools and became a widespread topic of the civic right to self-expression, but discussion of the topic died down due to the ubiquity of the style.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;chapatsu&quot; is formed from two morphemes: , meaning &quot;tea or brown, in this case, brown&quot; and , meaning &quot;hair&quot;. &quot;Chapatsu&quot; originally referred to a variety of colors of hair dye, including blonde, red, orange, and blue, it now refers to brown hue. In Japanese the word is also frequently written in hiragana syllabary.

== Style ==
While the style itself began to show up in Tokyo streets during the early to mid-1990s, &quot;chapatsu&quot; was first described in &quot;Imidas&quot;, an annual publication of new words and concepts in the Japanese language, in 1997. &quot;Chapatsu&quot; did not appear in &quot;Kōjien&quot;, an authoritative dictionary of the Japanese language, until 1998. The style first gained popularity among adolescent girls, seeking to accentuate their tanned skin (rebelling against more traditional definitions of beauty), but quickly became mainstream.
By the mid-2000s, however, trends seemed to indicate that the &quot;chapatsu&quot; as a mainstream style was on its way out. Although &quot;chapatsu&quot; died out as youth-centered fashion trend of rebellion, it came to be accepted not only on young people but also in certain business settings, and it was established before long as a Japanese fashion.

<text>Suzanne J. Crough (March 6, 1963 – April 27, 2015) was an American child actress best known for her role as Tracy Partridge on &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;.

==Career==

On &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, a musical sitcom TV show which ran from 1970 to 1974, Crough played Tracy Partridge, the youngest Partridge sibling, who played the tambourine. She also voiced Tracy in the 1974 Saturday morning cartoon Partridge Family 2200 A.D. After &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, she made several TV movies and made guest appearances on television shows, including &quot;Mulligan&#x27;s Stew&quot;. Her last credited on-screen role was as Kate in the 1980 TV movie &quot;Children of Divorce&quot;.

==Post-acting life==
Crough graduated from Los Angeles Pierce College and until 1993 owned and operated a bookstore. She married William Condray in July 1985; the couple had two daughters.

On March 2, 2010, during a reunion interview with several co-stars from &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; on &quot;The Today Show&quot;, she stated she was a manager at an OfficeMax in Bullhead City, Arizona.

==Death==
Crough died while sitting at her dining room table at her home in Laughlin, Nevada, on April 27, 2015, at the age of 52. The cause of death was not immediately reported, but Las Vegas police issued a statement that it was due to a &quot;medical episode&quot; and was &quot;not suspicious&quot;. According to the coroner of Clark County, Nevada, Crough&#x27;s cause of death was arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, a rare form of cardiomyopathy.

Several of Crough&#x27;s &quot;Partridge Family&quot; co-stars paid tribute to her, including Shirley Jones and Danny Bonaduce. Bonaduce lamented, &quot;Everyone thought I&#x27;d be the first Partridge to go. Sadly it was little Tracy. Suzanne was a wonderful lady and a good mom. She will be missed.&quot;

<doc id="170516" wikidata="Q230218" url="?curid=170516" title="Shirley Jones">
<text>Shirley Mae Jones (born March 31, 1934) is an American actress and singer. In her six decades in show business, she has starred as wholesome characters in a number of musical films, such as &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (1955), &quot;Carousel&quot; (1956), and &quot;The Music Man&quot; (1962). She won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for playing a vengeful prostitute in &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot; (1960). She played the lead role of Shirley Partridge, the widowed mother of five children, in the musical situation-comedy television series &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; (1970–1974), which co-starred her real-life stepson, David Cassidy, son of Jack Cassidy.

==Early life==
Jones was born on March 31, 1934, in Charleroi, Pennsylvania, to Methodist parents Marjorie (née Williams), and Paul Jones, owner of the Jones Brewing Company. Jones&#x27; paternal grandfather came from Wales. She was named after child star Shirley Temple.

Jones says that many people have incorrectly assumed that her middle name was named after vaudeville and film legend Mae West, but Jones was actually named after her aunt. Coincidentally, the first star Jones ever met was West, who was performing at the Twin Coaches supper club in Rostraver around 1954.

The family later moved to the small nearby town of Smithton. Jones began singing at the age of six in the Methodist Church choir and took voice lessons from Ralph Lewando. While attending South Huntingdon High School in Ruffs Dale, she participated in school plays.

Jones won the Miss Pittsburgh contest in 1952.

==Career==
===Early stage career===

Her first audition was for an open bi-weekly casting call held by John Fearnley, casting director for Rodgers and Hammerstein and their various musicals. At the time, Jones had never heard of Rodgers and Hammerstein. Fearnley was so impressed, he ran across the street to fetch Richard Rodgers, who was rehearsing with an orchestra for an upcoming musical. Rodgers then called Oscar Hammerstein at home. The two saw great potential in Jones. She became the first and only singer to be put under personal contract with the songwriters. They first cast her in a minor role in &quot;South Pacific&quot;. For her second Broadway show, &quot;Me and Juliet&quot;, she started as a chorus girl, and then an understudy for the lead role, earning rave reviews in Chicago.

===Movie actress===
Jones impressed Rodgers and Hammerstein with her musically trained voice, and was cast as the female lead in the film adaptation &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; in 1955. Other film musicals quickly followed, including &quot;Carousel&quot; (1956), &quot;April Love&quot; (1957), and &quot;The Music Man&quot; (1962), in which she was often typecast as a wholesome, kind character. However, she won a 1960 Academy Award for her performance in &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot; portraying a woman corrupted by the title character played by Burt Lancaster. Her character becomes a prostitute who encounters her seducer years later and reveals his true character. The director, Richard Brooks, had originally fought against her being in the movie, but after seeing her first scene, told her she would win an Oscar for her performance. She was reunited with Ron Howard (who had played her brother in &quot;The Music Man&quot;) in &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot; (1963). With an uncharacteristically brunette hairstyle, Jones played the role of a woman who falls in love with Tony Randall&#x27;s lion-owning professor in &quot;Fluffy&quot; (1965).

In her film career, she has worked with some of Hollywood&#x27;s icons: Jimmy Stewart, Gene Kelly, Marlon Brando, James Cagney, Henry Fonda, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and director John Ford.

===&quot;The Partridge Family&quot;===
In 1970, after turning down the role of Carol Brady on &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, a role that ultimately went to her best friend, Florence Henderson, Jones was the producers&#x27; first choice to audition for the lead role of Shirley Partridge in &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, an ABC musical sitcom based loosely on the real-life musical family The Cowsills. The series focused on a young widowed mother whose five children form a pop-rock group after the entire family painted its signature bus to travel. She was convinced that the combination of music and comedy would be a surefire hit. Jones realized, however, that:

During its first season, it became a hit and was screened in over 70 countries. Within months, Jones and her co-stars were pop culture television icons. Her real-life 20-year-old stepson David Cassidy, who was an unknown actor at the time, played Shirley Partridge&#x27;s eldest son Keith and became a teen idol. The show also spawned a number of albums and singles by The Partridge Family, performed by David Cassidy and Shirley Jones. That same year, &quot;I Think I Love You&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 music chart, making Jones the second person, after Frank Sinatra, and the first woman to win an acting Oscar and also have a number-one hit on that chart, an achievement only matched by Cher and Barbra Streisand. The Partridge Family won a NARM award for the best-selling single of the year in 1970 for their hit &quot;I Think I Love You&quot;. In 1971, The Partridge Family was nominated for a Grammy under the Best New Artist category.

The series&#x27; run ended in 1974.

Shirley Jones&#x27;s friendship with David Cassidy had begun in the mid-to-late 1950s, when David was just six, after he learned about his father&#x27;s divorce from his mother Evelyn Ward. Upon David&#x27;s first meeting with Shirley before co-starring with her on &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, he said, &quot;The day he tells me that they&#x27;re divorced, he tells me, &#x27;We&#x27;re remarried, and let me introduce you to my new wife.&#x27; He was thrilled when her first film, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (1955), had come out; and my dad took me to see it—I just see her, and I go, uh-oh, it doesn&#x27;t really quite register with me, &#x27;cause I&#x27;m in total shock, because I wanted to hate her, but the instant that I met her, I got the essence of her. She&#x27;s a very warm, open, sweet, good human being. She couldn&#x27;t have thawed it for me—the coldness and the ice—any more than she did.&quot; Shirley was shocked to hear her real-life stepson was going to audition for the role of Keith Partridge. David said, &quot;At the auditions, they introduced me to the lead actress [Shirley Jones] &#x27;cause they had no idea, they had no idea. So I said, &#x27;What are you doing here?&#x27; She looked at me and said, &#x27;What are you doing here?&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Well, I&#x27;m reading for the lead guy.&#x27; I said, &#x27;What are you doing here?&#x27; She said, &#x27;I&#x27;m the mother!&#x27;&quot; Cassidy discussed his relationship with his stepmother on the show: &quot;She wasn&#x27;t my mother, and I can be very open, and we can speak, and we became very close friends. She was a very good role model for me, watching the way, you know, she dealt with people on the set, and watching people revere her.&quot;

Cassidy appeared on many shows alongside his stepmother, including &quot;A&amp;E Biography&quot;, &quot;TV Land Confidential&quot;, and &quot;The Today Show&quot;, and he was one of the presenters of his stepmother&#x27;s &quot;Intimate Portrait&quot; on Lifetime Television, and the reality show pilot &quot;In Search of the Partridge Family&quot;, where he served as co-executive producer. The rest of the cast also celebrated the 25th, 30th, and 35th anniversaries of &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; (although Cassidy was unavailable to attend the 25th anniversary in 1995 owing to other commitments). In addition, Jack Cassidy&#x27;s death in 1976 drew Jones and Cassidy closer as Shirley&#x27;s three children and stepson mourned their father.

===&quot;Shirley&quot; and other projects===
In 1979, Jones tried her hand at television for the second time, starring in the NBC show &quot;Shirley&quot;, which, like &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, featured a family headed by a widowed mother, but the show failed to win ratings and was cancelled toward the middle of the season. Jones also played the &quot;older woman&quot; girlfriend of Drew Carey&#x27;s character in several episodes of &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, and reprised Shirley Partridge in a cameo in a 2000 episode of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show.&quot;
She was also in the dramatic project &quot;There Were Times, Dear&quot;, in which she played a loyal wife whose husband is dying of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease; she was nominated for an Emmy Award for this work.

In February 1986, Jones unveiled her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Vine Street just around the corner from Hollywood Boulevard. In 1983, she appeared in a rare revival of Noël Coward&#x27;s operetta, &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot;. In 2004, she returned to Broadway in a revival of &quot;42nd Street&quot;, portraying diva Dorothy Brock opposite Patrick Cassidy, the first time a mother and son were known to star together on Broadway. In July 2005, Jones revisited the musical &quot;Carousel&quot; onstage in Massachusetts, portraying &quot;Cousin Nettie&quot;.

In July 2006, Jones received another Emmy Award nomination for her supporting performance in the television film &quot;Hidden Places&quot;. She was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild award for the same film but lost to Helen Mirren for &quot;Elizabeth I&quot;. She also appeared in &quot;Grandma&#x27;s Boy&quot; (2006) as a nymphomaniac senior citizen. On November 16, 2007, she took the stage at the Ford Center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, during the Oklahoma Centennial Spectacular concert that celebrated the state&#x27;s 100th birthday. Jones sang the songs &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and &quot;People Will Say We&#x27;re In Love&quot; from the musical &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;.
In early 2008, it was announced that Jones would play Colleen Brady on the long-running NBC soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. Jones guest-starred on ABC Family&#x27;s short-lived show &quot;Ruby &amp; The Rockits&quot; as David and Patrick&#x27;s mother.

In 2008, U.K. label Stage Door Records released the retrospective collection &quot;Then &amp; Now&quot; featuring 24 songs from Jones&#x27;s musical career, including songs from the films &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, &quot;Carousel&quot;, and &quot;April Love&quot;. The album featured new recordings of songs including &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;Memory&quot;, and a sentimental tribute to &quot;The Music Man&quot;. She had a recurring role as Burt Chance&#x27;s mother in the Fox TV comedy series &quot;Raising Hope&quot;.

In mid-2012, Jones played Mrs. Paroo, when her son Patrick played Harold Hill, in a California Musical Theatre revival of &quot;The Music Man&quot;.

In 2014, Jones guest-starred on an episode of &quot;General Hospital&quot; as Mrs. McClain.

==Personal life==

On August 5, 1956, Jones married actor and singer Jack Cassidy. They had three sons, Shaun, Patrick, and Ryan. David Cassidy was Jack&#x27;s son from his first marriage to actress Evelyn Ward and became her stepson. Jones divorced Cassidy in 1975. 

On November 13, 1977, Jones married actor and comedian Marty Ingels. Jones and Ingels wrote an autobiography based on their relationship called &quot;Shirley &amp; Marty: An Unlikely Love Story&quot;. Despite being what Ingels called having an “odd-couple relationship” and separations (she filed, then withdrew, a divorce petition in 2002), they remained married until Ingels&#x27; death on October 21, 2015, from a massive stroke. After his death, Jones said: &quot;He often drove me crazy, but there&#x27;s not a day I won&#x27;t miss him and love him to my core.&quot;

On the evening of December 11, 1976, after Jones had refused an offer of reconciliation from Jack Cassidy, she received news that her ex-husband&#x27;s penthouse apartment was on fire. Apparently, the fire started from his lit cigarette when he fell asleep on the couch; the following morning, firefighters found Cassidy&#x27;s body inside the gutted apartment. Jack &quot;wanted to come back (to me) right up to the day he died&quot;, Jones said in a 1983 newspaper interview. &quot;And as I realized later, I wanted him. That&#x27;s the terrible part. Much as I love Marty and have a wonderful relationship—I&#x27;d say this with Marty sitting here—I&#x27;m not sure if Jack were alive I&#x27;d be married to Marty.&quot; Jones was 20 years old when she met Cassidy, who was seven years her senior, and she refers to him as the most influential person in and the love of her life.

Jones is a supporter of PETA.

Jones was devastated when Suzanne Crough died on April 27, 2015; Crough played one of her TV daughters on &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;. She had a very close relationship with the younger actress and remained close friends long after the series was cancelled, and regularly would send cards and birthday presents for Crough and her children. Jones said of Crough&#x27;s death on Hollywood Life:

With regard to David Cassidy&#x27;s alcohol abuse and legal problems, Jones once shared her family&#x27;s related concerns: David Cassidy died on November 21, 2017. The day after his death, Jones commented publicly:

<doc id="170517" wikidata="Q447293" url="?curid=170517" title="Susan Dey">
<text>Susan Hallock Dey (born December 10, 1952) is an American retired actress, known for her television roles as Laurie Partridge on the sitcom &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; from 1970 to 1974, and as Grace Van Owen on the drama series &quot;L.A. Law&quot; from 1986 to 1992. A three-time Emmy Award nominee and six-time Golden Globe Award nominee, she won the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Drama Series for &quot;L.A. Law&quot; in 1988.

==Early life and education==
Dey was born in Pekin, Illinois, to Ruth Pyle (née Doremus) Dey, a nurse, and Robert Smith Dey. Ruth died in 1961, when Susan was eight.

Dey attended Columbus Elementary School in Thornwood, New York. She later moved to Mount Kisco, New York, where she graduated from Fox Lane High School in 1970. 

==Career==
Dey began her professional life as a model. Her first modeling break was the cover photo of a booklet by Pursettes tampons on first facts of menstruation for young girls, &quot;Getting to Know Yourself.&quot; 

She was cast as Laurie Partridge in the television series &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; from 1970 to 1974. She was 17 when she won the part with no previous acting experience. She briefly reprised that role for the Hanna-Barbera animated series, Partridge Family 2200 A.D. for two episodes, before being replaced by Sherry Alberoni. She returned to weekly network television in 1977 as the co-star of the short-lived sitcom &quot;Loves Me, Loves Me Not&quot;.

Dey&#x27;s first film role was as a passenger in the 1972 airline hijack movie &quot;Skyjacked&quot;, starring Charlton Heston. 
In a 1977 made-for-television movie, &quot;Mary Jane Harper Cried Last Night&quot;, she portrayed a disturbed young mother with serious psychological problems who begins to take them out on her toddler daughter. Also in 1977, Dey starred opposite William Katt in &quot;First Love&quot;, directed by Joan Darling and appeared in the &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; episode &quot;Testament of Power&quot; (1977).

Dey co-starred with Albert Finney in the 1981 science-fiction film &quot;Looker&quot;, written and directed by Michael Crichton. She had a leading role in 1986&#x27;s &quot;Echo Park&quot; as a struggling waitress-actress who takes a job as a stripper delivering singing telegrams. She starred on &quot;L.A. Law&quot; from 1986 through 1992 as Los Angeles County deputy district attorney Grace Van Owen, who later became a judge. She won a Golden Globe Award as Actress in a Leading Role – Drama Series for the role in 1988. She was also nominated in each of the following four years. She was also nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 1987, 1988, and 1989.

She hosted a 1992 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Later that year, she co-starred in the sitcom &quot;Love &amp; War&quot;. Although the show ran until 1995, Dey was replaced in 1993 by Annie Potts because producers reportedly felt she had &quot;no chemistry&quot; with co-star Jay Thomas. In 1993, Dey produced and starred in &quot;Lies &amp; Lullabies&quot; (later released on DVD as &quot;Sad Inheritance&quot;), where she played a pregnant cocaine addict.

Dey was mentioned in Shirley Jones&#x27;s memoir as the only cast member who &quot;consistently refused&quot; to take part in &quot;Partridge Family&quot; reunions.

In 1972, Dey was credited as the author of a book titled &quot;Susan Dey&#x27;s Secrets on Boys, Beauty and Popularity&quot;.

==Personal life==

During the production of &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, Dey had romantic feelings for co-star David Cassidy. They eventually pursued a relationship when the show ended, but Cassidy broke it off as he did not share her feelings. In 1994, Cassidy disclosed details of his relationship with Dey in his autobiography &quot;C&#x27;mon, Get Happy ... Fear and Loathing on the Partridge Family Bus;&quot; he presumed this led to her severing contact with him.

Dey was married to Leonard &quot;Lenny&quot; Hirshan from 1976 to 1981. They have one daughter. Dey has been married to television producer Bernard Sofronski since 1988.

She serves as a board member of the Rape Treatment Center at UCLA Medical Center, and co-narrated a documentary on campus rape with former &quot;L.A. Law&quot; co-star Corbin Bernsen. She suffered from anorexia during the run of &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;.

<text>Dante Daniel Bonaduce (; born August 13, 1959) is an American retired radio personality, actor, television personality and professional wrestler. Bonaduce is the son of veteran TV writer and producer Joseph Bonaduce (&quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; and others).

Bonaduce became famous as a child actor of the 1970s on the TV sitcom &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;. He co-starred as Danny Partridge, the wisecracking, redheaded middle son of the singing family band (headed by Shirley Jones) and he portrayed the fictional pop group&#x27;s bass guitar player. Since then, Bonaduce has starred in several other TV series, including the VH1 reality show &quot;Breaking Bonaduce&quot; in 2005, has done radio shows in Los Angeles and Philadelphia and hosted a morning talk/music show at Seattle radio station KZOK-FM from 2011 to 2023.

==Early life==
By his own account, Bonaduce grew up in a dysfunctional family and suffered severe physical and emotional abuse at the hands of his father, TV writer and producer Joseph Bonaduce. Joseph and his mother Betty divorced in 1972.

==Career==
===Acting===
Bonaduce made a small appearance in the &quot;Bewitched&quot; season 5 episode &quot;Going Ape&quot;, which aired on February 27, 1969, as a young boy in the park whose chimpanzee follows Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery) and Tabitha (Erin Murphy) home.

Bonaduce had a substantial role on &quot;The Ghost &amp; Mrs. Muir&quot; on the first-season episode &quot;Jonathan Tells It Like It Was&quot;, aired March 1, 1969. He played competitor Danny Shoemaker in a history essay contest with Mrs. Muir&#x27;s son Jonathan. Danny&#x27;s father Joseph Bonaduce wrote the episode.

In &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; Bonaduce played the role of Danny Partridge, a member of the musical Partridge family. In the show, the Partridges were a family band that toured the country in their hip, Mondrian-inspired, painted school bus. Danny Partridge played bass guitar for the band and his younger siblings, Tracy and Chris, contributed to the band as percussionists. The series ran for four seasons, from 1970 to 1974 and, in 2003, Bonaduce was honored by the Young Artist Foundation with its Former Child Star &quot;Lifetime Achievement&quot; Award for his role on the series. He also voiced Danny in the 1974 Saturday morning cartoon Partridge Family 2200 A.D.

Bonaduce made several movies during and after the run of &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, including &quot;Corvette Summer&quot; (1978) starring Mark Hamill. Hamill and Bonaduce played high school students who went in search of a stolen customized Corvette Stingray. Bonaduce also made guest appearances on several TV shows, including the television action drama &quot;CHiPs&quot;. His career withered in the early 1980s.

Bonaduce and &quot;Partridge Family&quot; co-star Dave Madden made cameo appearances in a 1994 episode of &quot;Married... with Children&quot;. That same year, he appeared on an episode of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;. He has also guest-starred in the first two episodes of the seventh season of &quot;&quot; and as the son of Shirley Jones&#x27;s character in the fourth season of &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;. Bonaduce has appeared as himself on the detective series &quot;Monk&quot; and on the show &quot;Girlfriends&quot;. Bonaduce guest-starred with J. D. Roth (with whom he would later reunite for &quot;Breaking Bonaduce&quot;) on a celebrity episode of &quot;Sex Wars&quot;. In 1999, Bonaduce appeared in the Christmas episode, &quot;Sabrina, Nipping at Your Nose&quot;, of &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot;.

During his radio work, Bonaduce was the host of the segment &quot;Bonaduce&#x27;s Buzz&quot; as part of WMAQ-TV&#x27;s morning newscast &quot;First Thing in The Morning&quot; with Art Norman and Allison Rosati in 1994; but he left the station the following year to concentrate on his syndicated talk show.

During the 1995–96 TV season, Bonaduce was the host of &quot;Danny!&quot;, a syndicated talk show featuring the house band The Critics.

From 2001 to 2003, Bonaduce co-hosted &quot;The Other Half&quot;, a daytime talk show positioned as a complementary show to &quot;The View&quot;, on which he starred with Mario Lopez, Dick Clark and cosmetic surgeon Dr. Jan Adams (who was later replaced by actor Dorian Gregory). During this time, he was also a Hollywood correspondent for the Australian morning show &quot;Today&quot;.

In 2005, Bonaduce starred in &quot;Breaking Bonaduce&quot; a VH1 reality show about his turbulent life with his wife Gretchen.

In 2006, he had a recurring role in the crime scene drama &quot;&quot; as a character known as Izzy Delancy – a once great, but philandering, rock star, the victim of the infamous miniature killer. He also hosted the short-lived tabloid-themed game show &quot;Starface&quot;, on Game Show Network. In 2007, Bonaduce was both host and judge of the show &quot;I Know My Kid&#x27;s a Star&quot;, a reality show on VH1 featuring parents and children trying to break into show business. He also appeared as a judge on the Australian version of the show, &quot;My Kid&#x27;s a Star&quot;.

Bonaduce, admitting his own less-than-stellar track record, was a commentator for TruTV&#x27;s &quot;TruTV Presents: World&#x27;s Dumbest...&quot; from 2008 to 2013.

===Radio and music===
Bonaduce&#x27;s self-titled debut LP was released in 1973 by Lion Records, a subsidiary label of MGM Records. The single from the album, &quot;Dreamland&quot; was a minor hit.

In the late 1980s, Bonaduce had become an on-air radio personality. He worked an overnight shift at Philadelphia&#x27;s WEGX-FM. From 1994 to 1996, Bonaduce hosted his own radio show, &quot;The Danny Bonaduce Show&quot; on The Loop WLUP in Chicago. Between 1996 and 1998, Bonaduce hosted a morning radio show in Detroit on WKQI with comedian and &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot; winner John Heffron. In 1998 Bonaduce was the morning show host for New York City&#x27;s Big 105 WBIX for a brief period.

Bonaduce was part of &quot;The Adam Carolla Show&quot; in 2007. In 2008 he was given a daily one-hour solo spot known as &quot;Broadcasting Bonaduce,&quot; which was broadcast locally on the L.A.-based KLSX station. In February 2009, it was announced that the station had changed its format from talk to Top 40 and the removal of &quot;Broadcasting Bonaduce&quot; from the KLSX schedule was confirmed.

Bonaduce is an ordained minister; he was ordained online to perform a wedding ceremony as part of a 94WYSP radio promotion in early 2011.

Bonaduce co-hosted the morning-drive show for Seattle radio station 102.5 KZOK beginning on November 14, 2011. Bonaduce came to Seattle from a radio stint at 94 WYSP in Philadelphia, following a format change from classic rock to all sports radio in September 2011. On April 29, 2022, Bonaduce announced that he was taking a temporary medical leave from his Seattle radio show to pursue treatment for an undisclosed illness. In December 2023, Bonaduce announced that December 15 would be his last day on the air.

===Altercation with Jonny Fairplay===
On October 2, 2007, Bonaduce was involved in an altercation with &quot;Survivor&quot; show participant Jonny Fairplay during the Fox Reality Awards. Toward the end of the awards show, Fairplay appeared onstage and was booed by the audience. Bonaduce walked on stage and explained that the audience reaction was &quot;because they hate you.&quot; Bonaduce was walking off the stage as Fairplay called him back. Fairplay then jumped on Bonaduce to hug him and Bonaduce stated later that he was uncomfortable with Fairplay&#x27;s hands near his throat. Bonaduce, a black belt in Tang Soo Do, adjusted his balance and grip and threw Fairplay over his head. Fairplay fell to the floor, face first, unable to halt his fall with his hands due to the microphone he was holding. Fairplay stood up after a few moments and staggered before slowly walking off stage, his back to the audience. Bonaduce then smiled and proceeded to make faces and exaggerated shrugging motions at the audience before walking off stage.

Bonaduce later said the two had never had any negative interactions before that incident, but that they had met occasionally in the past. He said he had never liked Fairplay, mostly because Fairplay, true to his form, had lied about his grandmother&#x27;s death during his first run on &quot;Survivor&quot;. While Bonaduce did not believe Fairplay was significantly hurt at the time, TMZ.com confirmed that Fairplay bled significantly, lost some teeth and suffered a broken toe. Fairplay pressed charges and a felony battery investigation was opened by the police. On October 5, 2007, the L.A. District Attorney&#x27;s office concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prove Bonaduce had committed battery, because the contact had been initiated by Fairplay and Bonaduce had acted in self-defense.

===Boxing and wrestling===
As an adult, Bonaduce boxed Donny Osmond and former Brady Barry Williams in separate charity events. Bonaduce won both fights, gaining a decision over Osmond and a TKO over Williams. On June 11, 2007, it was announced that Bonaduce would box attorney Robert Shapiro for a charitable event.

On September 13, 2008, Bonaduce defeated &quot;Reverend&quot; Bob Levy by a TKO in the second one-minute round of a planned three-round fight. Prior to the event, Levy had slapped Bonaduce while visiting Bonaduce&#x27;s dressing room.

It was announced in early January 2009 that Bonaduce would box retired baseball player José Canseco at a charity event in the Philadelphia area. Bonaduce reportedly trained for the fight in Sacramento, California with boxer Angelo Núñez. On January 24, 2009, Bonaduce and Canseco fought to a majority draw.

In April 1994, it was announced that Bonaduce would be making his professional wrestling debut in a &quot;dark match&quot; at the Spring Stampede in Chicago. On April 17, 1994, Bonaduce stepped into the ring at the Rosemont Horizon. His opponent was another 1970s TV star, the Brady Bunch&#x27;s Christopher Knight. Bonaduce won. Bonaduce had his second professional wrestling match at Total Nonstop Action Wrestling&#x27;s pay-per-view event Lockdown 2009 against Eric Young, which he lost. Bonaduce was a key player in the series &quot;Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Celebrity Championship Wrestling&quot;.

===Writing===
In 2002, Bonaduce released an autobiography, &quot;Random Acts of Badness&quot;.

==Personal life==

Bonaduce has a black belt in karate.

Bonaduce married his first wife, Setsuko Hattori in 1985 and they divorced in 1988.

On November 4, 1990, Bonaduce met second wife Gretchen Hillmer on a blind date and, on a whim, they married the same day. Despite the unusual start to the marriage, the two remained married for over sixteen years and had two children together. On April 9, 2007, the two divorced, citing irreconcilable differences.

Bonaduce began dating his current wife, Amy Railsback, in April 2007. They met at a Starbucks in the Los Angeles area. Railsback, who is 23 years his junior, is a former substitute school teacher. She now manages Bonaduce&#x27;s career full-time, runs Gravel Tones Productions Inc and is occasionally seen in sketches on &quot;The Smoking Gun Presents: World&#x27;s Dumbest...&quot; on truTV. He proposed to Amy in March 2009 and the couple married on November 22, 2010, at the Four Seasons on Maui, Hawaii. They maintain homes in both Los Angeles and in Seattle.

Bonaduce and David Cassidy, his &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; costar, remained close friends until Cassidy&#x27;s death on November 21, 2017. On January 20, 2018, Bonaduce attended Cassidy&#x27;s memorial service in Los Angeles. Bonaduce also met actress Shirley Jones on the set of &quot;The Partridge Family.&quot; Jones often allowed Bonaduce to stay at her home to avoid his difficult home life. According to Jones, Bonaduce was &quot;smart&quot; and &quot;talented&quot; but a troublemaker off-camera, who &quot;was still a kid and would do kid things like get a dish of food and throw it across the room or have a pillow fight&quot;. Bonaduce later commented that &quot;Shirley Jones could not have been kinder to me&quot;.

===Arrests===
On March 9, 1990, he was arrested while attempting to buy cocaine in Daytona Beach, Florida. Bonaduce was there to host an event for D.A.R.E., an anti-drug campaign aimed at children. Bonaduce was eventually fired from WEGX. He later became the morning shift DJ at KKFR-FM in Phoenix, Arizona.

On March 31, 1991, Bonaduce was arrested in Phoenix for beating and robbing Darius Barney, a transgender sex worker; &quot;authorities said the victim suffered a broken nose and a cut to his face.&quot; Soon after, he was fired from KKFR. In July of the same year, Bonaduce pleaded guilty to reduced charges. Among his punishments, he was required to pay Barney&#x27;s medical bills. Later that same year, Bonaduce returned to WEGX in Philadelphia.

===Political views===

Bonaduce has expressed his mostly conservative political views during guest appearances. He is a strong supporter of capital punishment and a strong military. Bonaduce has made several controversial statements regarding left-wing or liberal celebrities, such as saying Jane Fonda should have been executed for treason for her support of North Vietnam during the Vietnam War. He also stated on MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Scarborough Country&quot; that &quot;personally, I think at this point, if anyone had a rope thick enough, I think that Rosie should be strung up for treason&quot;, referring to Rosie O&#x27;Donnell.

===Health===
In June 2023, Bonaduce announced that he would be undergoing hydrocephalus-related surgery after experiencing difficulty walking and maintaining his balance.

==Retirement==

In December 2023, Bonaduce announced his retirement from Seattle radio and his planned relocation to Palm Springs, California.

<text>Jeremy Russell Gelbwaks (born May 22, 1961, in Los Angeles) is an American former child actor who starred in the television series &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; (1970–71).

== Career ==

Gelbwaks was the first actor to play the role of Chris Partridge. He left the series after the first season, and was replaced by Brian Forster in the summer of 1971. According to his &quot;Partridge Family&quot; castmate David Cassidy, Gelbwaks &quot;had a personality conflict with every person in the cast, and with the producers&quot;. In a 2005 interview with the Television Academy Foundation, Shirley Jones mentioned that Gelbwaks &quot;was not happy doing [the show] ... his parents wanted him to do it, so we replaced him&quot;.

Gelbwaks retired from acting when his family moved from California to Reston, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C., where they resided for a year-and-a-half before moving again to Connecticut, and later to Potsdam, New York. Gelbwaks graduated from Hermon Dekalb Central School (Hermon, N.Y.) in 1978 and was a member of the National Honor Society. His father Norman taught computer science at the State University of New York at Potsdam.

Gelbwaks graduated from college in 1982, and became a computer analyst while studying chemistry at UC Berkeley. He worked in the computer industry until 1999, studied business at Columbia University, and became a management consultant. He married Patricia Polander and moved to New Orleans, where he works as a business and technology planner.

<doc id="170521" wikidata="Q212952" url="?curid=170521" title="Boogie-woogie">
<text>Boogie-woogie is a genre of blues music that became popular during the late 1920s, developed in African-American communities since the 1870s. It was eventually extended from piano to piano duo and trio, guitar, big band, country and western music, and gospel. While standard blues traditionally expresses a variety of emotions, boogie-woogie is mainly dance music (although not usually played for the competitive dance known as boogie-woogie (dance), a term of convenience in that sport). The genre had a significant influence on rhythm and blues and rock and roll.

Boogie-woogie waned in popularity in the 1930s, but enjoyed a resurgence and its greatest acclaim in the 1940s, reaching audiences around the world. Among its most famous acts was the &quot;Boogie Woogie Trio&quot; of Pete Johnson, Albert Ammons, and Meade &quot;Lux&quot; Lewis. Other famous boogie woogie pianists of this peak era were Maurice Rocco and Freddie Slack. There were also many very notable women boogie woogie pianists during this time, including Hadda Brooks, Winifred Atwell, Martha Davis, and Hazel Scott, as well as in later years, such as Katie Webster.

==Musical features==
Boogie-woogie is characterized by a regular left-hand bass figure, which is transposed following the chord changes.
:

Boogie-woogie is not strictly a solo piano style; it can accompany singers and be featured in orchestras and small combos. It is sometimes called &quot;eight to the bar&quot;, as much of it is written in common time () time using eighth notes (quavers) (see time signature). The chord progressions are typically based on I–IV–V–I (with many formal variations of it, such as I/i–IV/iv–v/I, as well as chords that lead into these ones).

For the most part, boogie-woogie tunes are twelve-bar blues, although the style has been applied to popular songs such as &quot;Swanee River&quot; and hymns such as &quot;Just a Closer Walk with Thee&quot;.

Typical boogie-woogie bassline:

==History==
===1870s–1930s===
Several African terms have been suggested as having some interesting linguistic precursors to &quot;boogie&quot;: Among them are the:

# Hausa word &quot;Boog&quot;, and 
# Mandingo word &quot;Booga&quot; (both of which mean &quot;to beat&quot;, as in beating a drum) 
# West African word &quot;Bogi&quot; (which means &quot;to dance&quot;) 
# Bantu term &quot;Mbuki Mvuki&quot; (Mbuki: &quot;to take off in flight&quot;; Mvuki: &quot;to dance wildly, as if to shake off one&#x27;s clothes&quot;).

The African origin of these terms is consistent with the African-American origin of the music.

In sheet music literature prior to 1900, there are at least three examples of the word &quot;boogie&quot; in music titles in the archives of the Library of Congress. In 1901, &quot;Hoogie Boogie&quot; appeared in the title of published sheet music, the first known instance where a redoubling of the word &quot;Boogie&quot; occurs in the title of published music. (In 1880, &quot;The Boogie Man&quot; had occurred as the title of published music.) The first use of &quot;Boogie&quot; in a recording title appears to be a &quot;blue cylinder&quot; recording made by Edison of the &quot;American Quartet&quot; performing &quot;That Syncopated Boogie Boo&quot; in 1913. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; states that the word is a reduplication of &quot;boogie&quot;, which was used for &quot;rent parties&quot; as early as 1913.

&quot;Boogie&quot; next occurs in the title of Wilbur Sweatman&#x27;s April 1917 recording of &quot;Boogie Rag&quot;. None of these sheet music or audio recording examples contain the musical elements that would identify them as boogie-woogie. The 1919 recordings (two takes) of &quot;Weary Blues&quot; by the Louisiana Five contained the same boogie-woogie bass figure as appears in the 1915 &quot;Weary Blues&quot; sheet music by Artie Matthews. Tennison has recognized these 1919 recordings as the earliest sound recordings which contain a boogie-woogie bass figure.

Blind Lemon Jefferson used the term &quot;Booga Rooga&quot; to refer to a guitar bass figure that he used in &quot;Match Box Blues&quot;. Jefferson may have heard the term from Huddie &quot;Lead Belly&quot; Ledbetter, who played frequently with Jefferson. Lead Belly, who was born in Mooringsport, La., and grew up in Harrison County, Texas, in the community of Leigh, said he first heard boogie-woogie piano in the Caddo Lake area of northeast Texas in 1899. He said it influenced his guitar-playing. Lead Belly also said he heard boogie-woogie piano in the Fannin Street district of Shreveport, Louisiana. Some of the players he heard were Dave Alexander, who recorded for Decca in 1937 as &quot;Black Ivory King&quot;, and a piano player called Pine Top (not Pine Top Smith, who was not born until 1904, but possibly Pine Top Williams or Pine Top Hill). Lead Belly was among the first guitar-players to adapt the rolling bass of boogie-woogie piano.

Texas, as the state of origin, became reinforced by Jelly Roll Morton, who said he heard the boogie piano style there early in the 20th century, as did Leadbelly and Bunk Johnson, according to Rosetta Reitz.

The first time the modern-day spelling of &quot;boogie-woogie&quot; was used in a title of a published audio recording of music appears to be Pine Top Smith&#x27;s December 1928 recording titled &quot;Pine Top&#x27;s Boogie Woogie&quot;, a song whose lyrics contain dance instructions to &quot;boogie-woogie&quot;.

The earliest documented inquiries into the geographical origin of boogie-woogie occurred in the late 1930s when oral histories from the oldest living Americans of both African and European descent revealed a broad consensus that boogie-woogie piano was first played in Texas in the early 1870s. Additional citations place the origins of boogie-woogie in the Piney Woods of northeast Texas.

====&quot;Fast Western&quot; connection to Marshall and Harrison County, Texas====
Max Harrison (in the book &quot;Jazz&quot; edited by Hentoff and McCarthy in 1959) and Mack McCormick (in the liner notes to his Treasury of Field Recordings, Vol. 2) concluded that &quot;Fast Western&quot; was the first term by which boogie-woogie was known. He stated that &quot;in Houston, Dallas, and Galveston—all Negro piano players played that way. This style was often referred to as a &#x27;fast western&#x27; or &#x27;fast blues&#x27; as differentiated from the &#x27;slow blues&#x27; of New Orleans and St. Louis. At these gatherings the ragtime and blues boys could easily tell from what section of the country a man came, even going so far as to name the town, by his interpretation of a piece.&quot;

According to Tennison, when he interviewed Lee Ree Sullivan in Texarkana in 1986, Sullivan told him that he was familiar with &quot;Fast Western&quot; and &quot;Fast Texas&quot; as terms to refer to boogie-woogie in general, but not to denote the use of any specific bass figure used in boogie-woogie. Sullivan said that &quot;Fast Western&quot; and &quot;Fast Texas&quot; were terms that derived from the Texas Western Railroad Company of Harrison County. The company was chartered on February 16, 1852, and changed its name to &quot;Southern Pacific&quot; in 1856. It built its first track from Marshall, Texas Swanson&#x27;s Landing at Caddo Lake in 1857. (This Texas-based &quot;Southern Pacific&quot; was not connected to the more well known Southern Pacific originating in San Francisco, California.) The Southern Pacific of Texas was bought by the newly formed Texas and Pacific Railway on March 21, 1872.

Although the Texas Western Railroad Company changed its name to Southern Pacific, Sullivan said the name &quot;Texas Western&quot; stuck among the slaves who constructed the railroad.

====Railroad connection to Marshall and Harrison County, Texas====
A key to identifying the geographical area in which boogie-woogie originated is understanding the relationship of boogie-woogie music with the steam railroad, both in the sense of how the music might have been influenced by sounds associated with the arrival of steam locomotives as well as the cultural impact the sudden emergence of the railroad might have had.

The railroad did not arrive in northeast Texas as an extension of track from existing lines from the north or the east. Rather, the first railroad locomotives and iron rails were brought to northeast Texas via steamboats from New Orleans via the Mississippi and Red Rivers and Caddo Lake to Swanson&#x27;s Landing, located on the Louisiana–Texas state line. Beginning with the formation of the Texas Western Railroad Company in Marshall, Texas, through the subsequent establishment in 1871 of the Texas and Pacific Railway company, which located its headquarters and shops there, Marshall was the only railroad hub in the Piney Woods of northeast Texas at the time the music developed. The sudden appearance of steam locomotives and the building of mainline tracks and tap lines to serve logging operations was pivotal to the creation of the music in terms of its sound and rhythm. It was also crucial to the rapid migration of the musical style from the rural barrel house camps to the cities and towns served by the Texas and Pacific Railway Company.

Although the neighboring states of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Missouri would also produce boogie-woogie players and their boogie-woogie tunes, and despite the fact that Chicago would become known as the center for this music through such pianists as Jimmy Yancey, Albert Ammons, and Meade &quot;Lux&quot; Lewis, Texas was home to an environment that fostered creation of boogie-style: the lumber, cattle, turpentine, and oil industries, all served by an expanding railway system from the northern corner of East Texas to the Gulf Coast and from the Louisiana border to Dallas and West Texas.

Alan Lomax wrote:

Anonymous black musicians, longing to grab a train and ride away from their troubles, incorporated the rhythms of the steam locomotive and the moan of their whistles into the new dance music they were playing in jukes and dance halls. Boogie-woogie forever changed piano playing, as ham-handed black piano players transformed the instrument into a polyrhythmic railroad train.

In the 1986 television broadcast of Britain&#x27;s &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; about boogie-woogie, music historian Paul Oliver noted:

Now the conductors were used to the logging camp pianists clamoring aboard, telling them a few stories, jumping off the train, getting into another logging camp, and playing again for eight hours, barrel house. In this way the music got around—all through Texas—and eventually, of course, out of Texas. Now when this new form of piano music came from Texas, it moved out towards Louisiana. It was brought by people like George W. Thomas, an early pianist who was already living in New Orleans by about 1910 and writing New Orleans Hop Scop Blues&quot;, which really has some of the characteristics of the music that we came to know as Boogie.

Paul Oliver also wrote that George W. Thomas &quot;composed the theme of the New Orleans Hop Scop Blues—in spite of its title—based on the blues he had heard played by the pianists of East Texas.&quot; On February 12, 2007, Oliver confirmed to John Tennison that it was Sippie Wallace who told Oliver that performances by East Texas pianists had formed the basis for George Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Hop Scop Blues&quot;.

Brothers George Thomas and Hersal Thomas migrated from Texas to Chicago and brought boogie-woogie with them, influencing a number of pianists, including Jimmy Yancey, Meade Lux Lewis, and Albert Ammons. Many elements now recognized as foundational elements of boogie-woogie are present in their 1922 song &quot;The Fives&quot;.

====Texas and Pacific Railway stops associated with names for boogie-woogie left-hand bass lines====
Early generation boogie-woogie players recognized basic boogie-woogie bass lines by geographical locations with which they associated them. Lee Ree Sullivan identified a number of these left hand bass lines for Tennison in 1986. From the primitive to the complex, those identifications indicate that the most primitive form of the music was associated with Marshall, Texas—and that the left-hand bass lines grew more complex as the distance from Marshall increased.

The most primitive of these left hand bass lines is the one that was called &quot;the Marshall&quot;. It is a simple, four-beats-to-the-bar figure. The second-most primitive bass-line, called &quot;the Jefferson&quot;, is also four-beats-to-the-bar, but goes down in pitch on the last note in each four-note cycle. It has been suggested that this downturn in pitch reveals a possible New Orleans influence. Jefferson, Texas, about 17 miles north of Marshall, was the westernmost port of a steamboat route that connected to New Orleans via Caddo Lake, the Red River, and the Mississippi River.

The remaining bass lines rise in complexity with distance from Marshall, Texas as one would expect variations and innovations would occur as the territory in which the music has been introduced expands.

====Marshall and Harrison County, Texas, and the origin of boogie-woogie====
In January 2010, John Tennison summarized his research into the origins of boogie-woogie with the conclusion that Marshall, Texas is &quot;the municipality whose boundaries are most likely to encompass or be closest to the point on the map which is the geographic center of gravity for all instances of Boogie Woogie performance between 1870 and 1880&quot;.

Tennison states:

Given the account of Elliot Paul, and given that Lead Belly witnessed boogie-woogie in 1899 in the Arklatex; and given the North to South migration of the Thomas family; and given the Texas &amp; Pacific headquarters in Marshall in the early 1870s; and given that Harrison County had the largest slave population in the state of Texas; and given the fact that the best-documented and largest-scale turpentine camps in Texas did not occur until after 1900 in Southeast Texas, it is most probable that boogie-woogie spread from Northeast to Southeast Texas, rather than from Southeast to Northeast Texas, or by having developed diffusely with an even density over all of the Piney Woods of East Texas. It would not be surprising if there was as yet undiscovered evidence of the earliest boogie-woogie performances buried (metaphorically or literally) in Northeast Texas.

On May 13, 2010, the Marshall City Commission enacted an official declaration naming Marshall as the &quot;birthplace&quot; of boogie-woogie music, and embarked on a program to encourage additional historical research and to stimulate interest in and appreciation for the early African-American culture in northeast Texas that played a vital role in creating boogie-woogie music. &quot;Birthplace of Boogie Woogie&quot; was registered by the Marshall Convention and Visitors on June 21, 2011.

====Development of modern boogie-woogie====
A song titled &quot;Tin Roof Blues&quot; was published in 1923 by the Clarence Williams Publishing Company. Compositional credit is given to Richard M. Jones. The Jones composition uses a boogie bass in the introduction with some variation throughout. In February 1923, Joseph Samuels&#x27; Tampa Blue Jazz Band recorded the George W. Thomas number &quot;The Fives&quot; for Okeh Records, considered the first example of jazz band boogie-woogie.

Jimmy Blythe&#x27;s recording of &quot;Chicago Stomps&quot; from April 1924 is sometimes called the first complete boogie-woogie piano solo record.

The first boogie-woogie hit was &quot;Pinetop&#x27;s Boogie Woogie&quot; by Pinetop Smith, recorded in 1928 and first released in 1929. Smith&#x27;s record was the first boogie-woogie recording to be a commercial hit, and helped establish &quot;boogie-woogie&quot; as the name of the style. It was closely followed by another example of pure boogie-woogie, &quot;Honky Tonk Train Blues&quot; by Meade Lux Lewis, recorded by Paramount Records(1927), first released in March 1930. The performance emulated a railroad trip, perhaps lending credence to the &quot;train theory&quot;.

===1930s to 1940s: Carnegie Hall and swing===
Boogie-woogie gained further public attention in 1938, thanks to the &quot;From Spirituals to Swing&quot; concert in Carnegie Hall promoted by record producer John Hammond. The concert featured Big Joe Turner and Pete Johnson performing Turner&#x27;s tribute to Johnson, &quot;Roll &#x27;Em Pete&quot;, as well as Meade Lux Lewis performing &quot;Honky Tonk Train Blues&quot; and Albert Ammons playing &quot;Swanee River Boogie&quot;. &quot;Roll &#x27;Em Pete&quot; is now considered to be an early rock and roll song.

These three pianists, with Turner, took up residence in the Café Society night club in New York City where they were popular with the sophisticated set. They often played in combinations of two and even three pianos, creating a richly textured piano performance.

After the Carnegie Hall concert, it was only natural for swing bands to incorporate the boogie-woogie beat into some of their music. Tommy Dorsey&#x27;s band recorded an updated version of &quot;Pine Top&#x27;s Boogie Woogie&quot; in 1938, which (as &quot;Boogie Woogie&quot;) became a hit in 1943 and 1945, and was to become the swing era&#x27;s second best seller, only second to Glenn Miller&#x27;s &quot;In the Mood&quot;. In 1939, at the suggestion of Columbia Records producer John Hammond, Harry James recorded the singles Boo-Woo and Woo-Woo with Pete Johnson and Albert Ammons. Also from 1939, the Will Bradley orchestra had a string of boogie hits such as the original versions of &quot;Beat Me Daddy (Eight To The Bar)&quot; and &quot;Down the Road a Piece&quot;, both 1940, and &quot;Scrub Me Mamma with a Boogie Beat&quot;, in 1941. That same year, The Andrews Sisters had a top 10 hit single with their recording of &quot;Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy&quot;.

The popularity of the Carnegie Hall concert meant work for many of the fellow boogie players and also led to the adaptation of boogie-woogie sounds to many other forms of music. Tommy Dorsey&#x27;s band had a hit with &quot;T.D.&#x27;s Boogie Woogie&quot; as arranged by Sy Oliver, and soon there were boogie-woogie songs, recorded and printed, of many different stripes. These included most famously, in the big-band genre, the ubiquitous &quot;Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy&quot;, which was revamped by Christina Aguilera as her 2006 hit, &quot;Candyman&quot;.

The boogie-woogie fad lasted from the late 1930s into the early 1950s, and made a major contribution to the development of jump blues and ultimately to rock and roll, epitomized by Fats Domino, Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis. Louis Jordan is a famous jump blues musician. Boogie-woogie is still to be heard in clubs and on records throughout Europe and North America. Big Joe Duskin displayed on his 1979 album, &quot;Cincinnati Stomp&quot;, a command of piano blues and boogie-woogie, which he had absorbed at first hand in the 1940s from Albert Ammons and Pete Johnson.

The trickle of what was initially called hillbilly boogie, or Okie boogie (later to be renamed country boogie), became a flood beginning around late 1945. One notable country boogie song from this period was the Delmore Brothers&#x27; &quot;Freight Train Boogie&quot;. More representative examples can be found in some of the songs of Western swing pioneer Bob Wills. The hillbilly boogie period lasted into the 1950s, the last recordings of this era were made by Tennessee Ernie Ford with Cliffie Stone and his orchestra with the guitar duo Jimmy Bryant and Speedy West. Bill Haley and the Saddlemen recorded &quot;Sundown Boogie&quot; in 1952, which once again featured the guitar playing the boogie-woogie rhythm.

Boogie-woogie continued in country music through the end of the 20th century. The Charlie Daniels Band (whose earlier tune &quot;The South&#x27;s Gonna Do It Again&quot; uses boogie-woogie influences) released &quot;Boogie Woogie Fiddle Country Blues&quot; in 1988, and three years later in 1991 Brooks &amp; Dunn had a huge hit with &quot;Boot Scootin&#x27; Boogie&quot;. In addition, some tradition-minded country artists, such as Asleep at the Wheel, Merle Haggard, and George Strait, incorporated boogie-woogie in their recordings.

In the many styles of blues, especially Chicago blues and (more recently) West Coast blues, some pianists and guitarists were influenced by, and employed, the traditional boogie-woogie styles. Some of the earliest and most influential were Big Maceo Merriweather and Sunnyland Slim. Otis Spann and Pinetop Perkins, two of the best-known blues pianists, are heavily boogie-woogie influenced, with the latter taking both his name and signature tune from Pinetop Smith.

In Western classical music, the composer Conlon Nancarrow was also deeply influenced by boogie-woogie, as many of his early works for player piano demonstrate. &quot;A Wonderful Time Up There&quot; is a boogie-woogie gospel song. In 1943, Morton Gould composed &quot;Boogie-Woogie Etude&quot; for classical pianist José Iturbi, who premiered and recorded it that year. Povel Ramel&#x27;s first hit in 1944 was &quot;Johanssons boogie-woogie-vals&quot; where he mixed boogie-woogie with waltz. Twenty-first-century commentators have also noted the characteristics of boogie-woogie in the third variation of the second movement of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 32, written between 1821 and 1822—60 years prior to creation of the genre.

<doc id="170522" wikidata="Q89640" url="?curid=170522" title="Consumerism">
<text>Consumerism is a social and economic order in which the aspirations of many individuals include the acquisition of goods and services beyond those necessary for survival or traditional displays of status. It emerged in Western Europe before the Industrial Revolution and became widespread around 1900. In economics, consumerism refers to policies that emphasize consumption. It is the consideration that the free choice of consumers should strongly inform the choice by manufacturers of what is produced and how, and therefore influence the economic organization of a society.

Consumerism has been criticized by both individuals who choose other ways of participating in the economy (i.e. choosing simple living or slow living) and environmentalists concerned about its impact on the planet. Experts often assert that consumerism has physical limits, such as growth imperative and overconsumption, which have larger impacts on the environment. This includes direct effects like overexploitation of natural resources or large amounts of waste from disposable goods and significant effects like climate change. Similarly, some research and criticism focuses on the sociological effects of consumerism, such as reinforcement of class barriers and creation of inequalities.

== Evolution of the term ==
The term &quot;consumerism&quot; has several definitions. These definitions may not be related to each other and they conflict with each other.

In a 1955 speech, John Bugas, a vice president of the Ford Motor Company, coined the term &quot;consumerism&quot; as a substitute for &quot;capitalism&quot; and better describe the American economy:
Bugas&#x27;s definition aligned with Austrian economics founder Carl Menger&#x27;s conception of &quot;consumer sovereignty&quot;, as laid out in his 1871 book &quot;Principles of Economics&quot;, whereby consumer preferences, valuations, and choices control the economy entirely. This view stood in direct opposition to Karl Marx&#x27;s critique of the capitalist economy as a system of exploitation.

For social critic Vance Packard, however, &quot;consumerism&quot; was not a positive term about consumer practices but rather a negative term, meaning excessive materialism and wastefulness. In the advertisements for his 1960 book &quot;The Waste Makers&quot;, the word &quot;consumerism&quot; was prominently featured in a negative way.

One sense of the term relates to efforts to support consumers&#x27; interests. By the early 1970s it had become the accepted term for the field and began to be used in these ways:

# Consumerism is the concept that consumers should be informed decision makers in the marketplace. In this sense consumerism is the study and practice of matching consumers with trustworthy information, such as product testing reports.
# Consumerism is the concept that the marketplace itself is responsible for ensuring social justice through fair economic practices. Consumer protection policies and laws compel manufacturers to make products safe.
# Consumerism refers to the field of studying, regulating, or interacting with the marketplace. The consumer movement is the social movement which refers to all actions and all entities within the marketplace which give consideration to the consumer.

While the above definitions were becoming established, other people began using the term &quot;consumerism&quot; to mean &quot;high levels of consumption&quot;. This definition has gained popularity since the 1970s and began to be used in these ways:
# Consumerism is the selfish and frivolous collecting of products, or economic materialism. In this sense consumerism is negative and in opposition to positive lifestyles of anti-consumerism and simple living.
# Consumerism is a force from the marketplace which destroys individuality and harms society. It is related to globalization and in protest against this some people promote the &quot;anti-globalization movement&quot;.

==History==

===Origins===

The consumer society developed throughout the late 17th century and the 18th century. Peck addresses the assertion made by consumption scholars about writers such as &quot;Nicholas Barbon and Bernard Mandeville&quot; in &quot;Luxury and War: Reconsidering Luxury Consumption in Seventeenth-Century England&quot; and how their emphasis on the financial worth of luxury changed society&#x27;s perceptions of luxury. They argue that a significant transformation occurred in the eighteenth century when the focus shifted from court-centered luxury spending to consumer-driven luxury consumption, which was fueled by middle-class purchases of new products.

The English economy expanded significantly in the 17th century due to new methods of agriculture that rendered it feasible to cultivate a larger area. A time of heightened demand for luxury goods and increased cultural interaction was reflected in the wide range of luxury products that the aristocracy and affluent merchants imported from nations like Italy and the Low Countries. This expansion of luxury consumption in England was facilitated by state policies that encouraged cultural borrowing and import substitution, hence enabling the purchase of luxury items. Luxury goods included sugar, tobacco, tea, and coffee; these were increasingly grown on vast plantations (historically by slave labor) in the Caribbean as demand steadily rose. In particular, sugar consumption in Britain increased by a factor of 20 during the 18th century. 

Furthermore, the non-importation movement commenced in the 18th century, more precisely from 1764 to 1776, as Witkowski&#x27;s article &quot;Colonial Consumers in Revolt: Buyer Values and Behavior during the Nonimportation Movement, 1764–1776&quot; discusses. He describes the evolving development of consumer culture in the context of &quot;colonial America&quot;. An emphasis on efficiency and economical consumption gave way to a preference for comfort, convenience, and importing products. During this time of transformation, colonial consumers had to choose between rising material desires and conventional values.

===Culture of consumption===

The pattern of intensified consumption became particularly visible in the 17th century in London, where the gentry and prosperous merchants took up residence and promoted a culture of luxury and consumption that slowly extended across socio-economic boundaries. Marketplaces expanded as shopping centres, such as the New Exchange, opened in 1609 by Robert Cecil in the Strand. Shops started to become important as places for Londoners to meet and socialize and became popular destinations alongside the theatre. From 1660, Restoration London also saw the growth of luxury buildings as advertisements for social position, with speculative architects like Nicholas Barbon and Lionel Cranfield operating. This then-scandalous line of thought caused great controversy with the publication of the influential work &quot;Fable of the Bees&quot; in 1714, in which Bernard Mandeville argued that a country&#x27;s prosperity ultimately lay in the self-interest of the consumer.

The pottery entrepreneur and inventor, Josiah Wedgwood, noticed the way that aristocratic fashions, themselves subject to periodic changes in direction, slowly filtered down through different classes of society. He pioneered the use of marketing techniques to influence and manipulate the movement of prevailing tastes and preferences to cause the aristocracy to accept his goods; it was only a matter of time before the middle classes also rapidly bought up his goods. Other producers of a wide range of other products followed his example, and the spread and importance of consumption fashions became steadily more important. Since then, advertising has played a major role in fostering a consumerist society, marketing goods through various platforms in nearly all aspects of human life, and pushing the message that the potential customer&#x27;s personal life requires some product.

===Mass production===

The Industrial Revolution dramatically increased the availability of consumer goods, although it was still primarily focused on the capital goods sector and industrial infrastructure (i.e., mining, steel, oil, transportation networks, communications networks, industrial cities, financial centers, etc.). The advent of the department store represented a paradigm shift in the experience of shopping. Customers could now buy an astonishing variety of goods, all in one place, and shopping became a popular leisure activity. While previously the norm had been the scarcity of resources, the industrial era created an unprecedented economic situation. For the first time in history products were available in outstanding quantities, at outstandingly low prices, therefore available to virtually everyone in the industrialized West.

By the turn of the 20th century, the average worker in Western Europe or the United States still spent approximately 80–90% of their income on food and other necessities. What was needed to propel consumerism, was a system of mass production and consumption, exemplified by Henry Ford, an American car manufacturer. After observing the assembly lines in the meat-packing industry, Frederick Winslow Taylor brought his theory of scientific management to the organization of the assembly line in other industries; this unleashed incredible productivity and reduced the costs of commodities produced on assembly lines around the world.

Consumerism has long had intentional underpinnings, rather than just developing out of capitalism. As an example, Earnest Elmo Calkins noted to fellow advertising executives in 1932 that &quot;consumer engineering must see to it that we use up the kind of goods we now merely use&quot;, while the domestic theorist Christine Frederick observed in 1929 that &quot;the way to break the vicious deadlock of a low standard of living is to spend freely, and even waste creatively&quot;.

The older term and concept of &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot; originated at the turn of the 20th century in the writings of sociologist and economist Thorstein Veblen. The term describes an apparently irrational and confounding form of economic behaviour. Veblen&#x27;s scathing proposal that this unnecessary consumption is a form of status display is made in darkly humorous observations like the following:
The term &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot; spread to describe consumerism in the United States in the 1960s, but was soon linked to debates about media theory, culture jamming, and its corollary productivism.

=== Television and American consumerism ===
The advent of the television in the late 1940s proved to be an attractive opportunity for advertisers, who could reach potential consumers in the home using lifelike images and sound. The introduction of mass commercial television positively impacted retail sales. The television motivated consumers to purchase more products and upgrade whatever they currently had. In the United States, a new consumer culture developed centered around buying products, especially automobiles and other durable goods, to increase their social status. Woojin Kim of the University of California, Berkeley, argues that sitcoms of this era also helped to promote the idea of suburbia.

According to Woojin, the attraction of television advertising has brought an improvement in Americans&#x27; social status. Watching television programs has become an important part of people&#x27;s cultural life. Television advertising can enrich and change the content of advertising from hearing and vision and make people in contact with it. The image of television advertising is realistic, and it is easy to have an interest and desire to buy advertising goods, At the same time, the audience intentionally or unintentionally compares and comments on the advertised goods while appreciating the TV advertisements, arouses the interest of the audience by attracting attention, and forms a buying idea, which is conducive to enhancing the buying confidence. Therefore, TV can be used as a media way to accelerate and affect people&#x27;s desire to buy products.

===In the 21st century===

Madeline Levine criticized what she saw as a large change in American culture – &quot;a shift away from values of community, spirituality, and integrity, and toward competition, materialism and disconnection.&quot;

Businesses have realized that wealthy consumers are the most attractive targets of marketing. The upper class&#x27;s tastes, lifestyles, and preferences trickle down to become the standard for all consumers. The not-so-wealthy consumers can &quot;purchase something new that will speak of their place in the tradition of affluence&quot;. A consumer can have the instant gratification of purchasing an expensive item to improve social status.

Emulation is also a core component of 21st century consumerism. As a general trend, regular consumers seek to emulate those who are above them in the social hierarchy. The poor strive to imitate the wealthy and the wealthy imitate celebrities and other icons. The celebrity endorsement of products can be seen as evidence of the desire of modern consumers to purchase products partly or solely to emulate people of higher social status. This purchasing behavior may co-exist in the mind of a consumer with an image of oneself as being an individualist.

Cultural capital, the intangible social value of goods, is not solely generated by cultural pollution. Subcultures also manipulate the value and prevalence of certain commodities through the process of bricolage. Bricolage is the process by which mainstream products are adopted and transformed by subcultures. These items develop a function and meaning that differs from their corporate producer&#x27;s intent. In many cases, commodities that have undergone bricolage often develop political meanings.

For example, Doc Martens, originally marketed as workers boots, gained popularity with the punk movement and AIDS activism groups and became symbols of an individual&#x27;s place in that social group. When corporate America recognized the growing popularity of Doc Martens they underwent another change in cultural meaning through counter-bricolage. The widespread sale and marketing of Doc Martens brought the boots back into the mainstream. While corporate America reaped the ever-growing profits of the increasingly expensive boot and those modeled after its style, Doc Martens lost their original political association. Mainstream consumers used Doc Martens and similar items to create an &quot;individualized&quot; sense of identity by appropriating statement items from subcultures they admired.

When consumerism is considered as a movement to improve rights and powers of buyers in relation to sellers, there are certain traditional rights and powers of sellers and buyers.

The American Dream has long been associated with consumerism. According to Sierra Club&#x27;s Dave Tilford, &quot;With less than 5 percent of world population, the U.S. uses one-third of the world&#x27;s paper, a quarter of the world&#x27;s oil, 23 percent of the coal, 27 percent of the aluminum, and 19 percent of the copper.&quot;

China is the world&#x27;s fastest-growing consumer market. According to biologist Paul R. Ehrlich, &quot;If everyone consumed resources at the US level, you will need another four or five Earths.&quot;

With the development of the economy, consumers&#x27; awareness of protecting their rights and interests is growing, and consumer demand is growing. Online commerce has expanded the consumer market and enhanced consumer information and market transparency. Digital fields not only bring advantages and convenience but also cause many problems and increase the opportunities for consumers to suffer damage.

Under the virtual network environment, on the one hand, consumers&#x27; privacy protection is vulnerable to infringement, driven by the development of hacker technology and the Internet, on the other hand, consumers&#x27; right to know is the basic right of consumers. When purchasing goods and receiving services, we need the real situation of institutional services. Finally, in the Internet era, consumers&#x27; demand is increasing, and we also need to protect consumers&#x27; rights and interests to improve consumers&#x27; rights and interests and promote the operation of the economic market.

==== Socially mediated political consumerism ====

Today&#x27;s society has entered the era of entertainment and the Internet. Most people spend more time browsing on mobile phones than face-to-face. The convenience of social media has a subtle impact on the public and unconsciously changes people&#x27;s consumption habits. The socialized Internet is gradually developing, such as Twitter, websites, news and social media, with sharing and participation as the core, consumers share product information and opinions through social media. At the same time, by understanding the reputation of the brand on social media, consumers can easily change their original attitude towards the brand. The information provided by social media helps consumers shorten the time of thinking about products and decision-making, so as to improve consumers&#x27; initiative in purchase decision-making and improve consumers&#x27; shopping and decision-making quality to a certain extent.

==Criticism==


Andreas Eisingerich discusses in his article &quot;Vision statement: Behold the extreme consumers...and learn to embrace them&quot; that &quot;In many critical contexts, &quot;consumerism&quot; is used to describe the tendency of people to identify strongly with products or services they consume, especially those with commercial brand-names and perceived status-symbolism appeal, e.g. a luxury car, designer clothing, or expensive jewelry&quot;. A major criticism of consumerism is that it serves the interests of capitalism.

Consumerism can take extreme forms, to the extent that consumers will sacrifice significant time and income not only to make purchases, but also to actively support a certain firm or brand. As stated by Gary Cross in his book &quot;All Consuming Century: Why Consumerism Won in Modern America&quot;, &quot;consumerism succeeded where other ideologies failed because it concretely expressed the cardinal political ideals of the century – liberty and democracy – and with relatively little self-destructive behavior or personal humiliation.&quot; He discusses how consumerism won in its forms of expression.

Tim Kasser, in his book &quot;The High Price of Materialism&quot;, examines how the culture of consumerism and materialism affects our happiness and well-being. The book argues that people who value wealth and possessions more than other things tend to have lower levels of satisfaction, self-esteem, and intimacy, and higher levels of anxiety, depression, and insecurity. The book also explores how materialistic values harm our relationships, our communities, and our environment, and suggests ways to reduce materialism and increase our quality of life.

Opponents of consumerism argue that many luxuries and unnecessary consumer-products may act as a social mechanism allowing people to identify like-minded individuals through the display of similar products, again utilizing aspects of status-symbolism to judge socioeconomic status and social stratification. Some people believe relationships with a product or brand name are substitutes for healthy human relationships lacking in societies, and along with consumerism, create a cultural hegemony, and are part of a general process of social control in modern society.

In 1955, economist Victor Lebow stated:
Figures who arguably do not wholly buy into consumerism include German historian Oswald Spengler (1880–1936), who said: &quot;Life in America is exclusively economic in structure and lacks depth&quot;, and French writer Georges Duhamel (1884–1966), who held American materialism up as &quot;a beacon of mediocrity that threatened to eclipse French civilization&quot;. Francis Fukuyama blames consumerism for moral compromises.

Moreover, some critics have expressed concern about the role commodities play in the definition of one&#x27;s self. In his 1976 book , historian and media theorist Stuart Ewen introduced what he referred to as the &quot;commodification of consciousness&quot;, and coined the term &quot;commodity self&quot; to describe an identity built by the goods we consume.

For example, people often identify as PC or Mac users, or define themselves as a Coke drinker rather than a Pepsi drinker. The ability to choose one product out of a great number of others allows a person to build a sense of &quot;unique&quot; individuality, despite the prevalence of Mac users or the nearly identical tastes of Coke and Pepsi. By owning a product from a certain brand, one&#x27;s ownership becomes a vehicle of presenting an identity that is associated with the attitude of the brand. The idea of individual choice is exploited by corporations that claim to sell &quot;uniqueness&quot; and the building blocks of an identity. The invention of the commodity self is a driving force of consumerist societies, preying upon the deep human need to build a sense of self.

===Environmental impact===
Critics of consumerism point out that consumerist societies are more prone to damage the environment, contribute to global warming and use resources at a higher rate than other societies. Jorge Majfud says that &quot;Trying to reduce environmental pollution without reducing consumerism is like combatting drug trafficking without reducing the drug addiction.&quot;

Pope Francis also critiques consumerism in his encyclical &quot;Laudato Si&#x27;: On Care For Our Common Home&quot;. He critiques the harm consumerism does to the environment and states, &quot;The analysis of environmental problems cannot be separated from the analysis of human, family, work-related and urban contexts, nor from how individuals relate to themselves, which leads in turn to how they relate to others and to the environment.&quot; Pope Francis believes the obsession with consumerism leads individuals further away from their humanity and obscures the interrelated nature between humans and the environment.

Another critic is James Gustave Speth. He argues that the growth imperative represents the main goal of capitalistic consumerism. In his book &quot;The Bridge at the Edge of the World&quot; he notes, &quot;Basically, the economic system does not work when it comes to protecting environmental resources, and the political system does not work when it comes to correcting the economic system&quot;.

In an opinion segment of &quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine published in August 2009, reporter Andy Coghlan cited William Rees of the University of British Columbia and epidemiologist Warren Hern of the University of Colorado at Boulder saying that human beings, despite considering themselves civilized thinkers, are &quot;subconsciously still driven by an impulse for survival, domination and expansion ... an impulse which now finds expression in the idea that inexorable economic growth is the answer to everything, and, given time, will redress all the world&#x27;s existing inequalities.&quot;

According to figures presented by Rees at the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America, human society is in a &quot;global overshoot&quot;, consuming 30% more material than is sustainable from the world&#x27;s resources. Rees went on to state that at present, 85 countries are exceeding their domestic &quot;bio-capacities&quot;, and compensate for their lack of local material by depleting the stocks of other countries, which have a material surplus due to their lower consumption. Not only that, but McCraken indicates that how consumer goods and services are bought, created and used should be taken under consideration when studying consumption.

Not all anti-consumerists oppose consumption in itself, but they argue against increasing the consumption of resources beyond what is environmentally sustainable. Jonathan Porritt writes that consumers are often unaware of the negative environmental impacts of producing many modern goods and services, and that the extensive advertising industry only serves to reinforce increasing consumption.

Conservation scientists Lian Pin Koh and Tien Ming Lee, discuss that in the 21st century, the damage to forests and biodiversity cannot be dealt with only by the shift towards &quot;Green&quot; initiatives such as &quot;sustainable production, green consumerism, and improved production practices&quot;. They argue that consumption in developing and emerging countries needs to be less excessive. Likewise, other ecological economists such as Herman Daly and Tim Jackson recognize the inherent conflict between consumer-driven consumption and planet-wide ecological degradation.

American environmental historian and sociologist Jason W. Moore, in his book &quot;Anthropocene or Capitalocene? Nature, History, and the Crisis of Capitalism&quot; points out that the challenge of addressing both underconsumption and overconsumption of resources lies at the heart of the world’s primary sustainability dilemma. While significant portions of the global population struggle to meet basic needs, the resource-intensive lifestyles of affluent societies — characterized by car dependency, frequent air travel, high meat consumption, and an apparently limitless appetite for consumer goods like clothing and technological devices — are key drivers of the unsustainable practices.

===Consumerism as cultural ideology===
In the 21st century&#x27;s globalized economy, consumerism has become a noticeable part of the culture. Critics of the phenomenon not only criticized it against what is environmentally sustainable, but also the spread of consumerism in cultural aspects. However, several scholars have written about the relationship between environmentalism and consumerism in a market economy society.

Discussions of the environmental implications of consumerist ideologies in works by economists James Gustave Speth and Naomi Klein, and consumer cultural historian Gary Cross. Leslie Sklair proposes the criticism through the idea of culture-ideology of consumerism in his works. He says that,

Today, people are universally and continuously being exposed to mass consumerism and product placement in the media or even in their daily lives. The line between information, entertainment, and promotion of products has been blurred, thus explaining how people have become more reformulated into consumerist behaviours. Shopping centers are a representative example of a place where people are explicitly exposed to an environment that welcomes and encourages consumption. 

For example, in 1993, Goss wrote that the shopping center designers &quot;strive to present an alternative rationale for the shopping center&#x27;s existence, manipulate shoppers&#x27; behavior through the configuration of space, and consciously design a symbolic landscape that provokes associative moods and dispositions in the shopper&quot;. On the prevalence of consumerism in daily life, historian Gary Cross says that &quot;The endless variation of clothing, travel, and entertainment provided opportunity for practically everyone to find a personal niche, no matter their race, age, gender or class.&quot;

Arguably, the success of the consumerist cultural ideology can be witnessed all around the world. People who rush to the mall to buy products and end up spending money with their credit cards can easily become entrenched in the financial system of capitalist globalization.

===Alternatives===

Since consumerism began, various individuals and groups have consciously sought an alternative lifestyle. These movements range on a spectrum from moderate &quot;simple living&quot;, &quot;eco-conscious shopping&quot;, and &quot;localvore&quot;/&quot;buying local&quot;, to Freeganism on the extreme end. Building on these movements, the discipline of ecological economics addresses the macro-economic, social and ecological implications of a primarily consumer-driven economy.

<doc id="170529" wikidata="Q902887" url="?curid=170529" title="Islay single malts">
<text>Islay single malts are the single malt Scotch whiskies made on Islay ( ) or &quot;Ìle&quot; in Gaelic, one of the southernmost of the Inner Hebridean Islands located off the west coast of Scotland. Islay is one of five whisky distilling localities and regions in Scotland whose identity is protected by law.

The region is characterised by whiskies with a peat smoke aroma, such as Laphroaig, Lagavulin and Ardbeg. In total, there are nine active distilleries on this island which measures only , and the industry is Islay&#x27;s second largest employer after agriculture. Islay is a centre of &quot;whisky tourism&quot;, and hosts a &quot;Festival of Malt and Music&quot; known as &quot;Fèis Ìle&quot; each year on the last week of May, with events and tastings celebrating the cultural heritage of the island.

==History==
Some sources indicate that Irish monks may have been the first to distill whisky on the island in the early 1300s. According to &quot;Visit Scotland&quot;, &quot;most of Islay&#x27;s original distilleries [some no longer in business] started as farm distilleries and retreated to secluded glens and caves during the 17th century when the excise man came calling.&quot;

Another source is more specific: &quot;Islay’s past is pervaded by innumerable tales of home distilling, smuggling and illegal whisky production&quot; and adds that the eight older distilleries all began as small, illicit producers. All were built near water since grain was shipped on boats and the finished whisky was transported via water. For centuries, the whisky was usually aged in sherry casks but bourbon casks from the U.S. are now also frequently used.

In 1806, the Right Hon. Allan Maconochie, Lord Meadowbank at the Circuit Court at Inverary heard the case against Donald, Duncan and Neil, sons of Dugald Mackiachan, &quot;all residing in the island of Islay, accused of breaking into a room or cellar possessed by Benjamin Campbell, activing supervisor in said island, and stealing from thence 125 gallons of whisky, and they failing to appear to stand trial, sentence of fugitation was pronounced against them&quot;.

==Styles of whisky==

The whiskies of the distilleries along the southeastern coast of the island, Laphroaig, Lagavulin, and Ardbeg, have a smoky character derived from peat, considered a central characteristic of the Islay malts, and ascribed both to the water from which the whisky is made and to the peating levels of the barley. Many describe this as a &quot;medicinal&quot; flavour. They also possess notes of iodine, seaweed and salt. Caol Ila, on the northern side of the island, across from Jura, also produces a strongly peated whisky. Trees, other than plantations, on these islands are scattered and the peat is free of rotting wood. (Normal peat bogs are invaded by trees and periodic fires kill the encroaching tree line.) Islay peat is reputedly the best flavoured for scotch production.

The other distilleries on the island make whisky in a variety of styles. Bunnahabhain makes much lighter whiskies which are generally lightly peated. Bowmore, which started business in 1779, produces a whisky which is well balanced, using a medium-strong peating level (25 ppm) but also using sherry-cask maturation. The Kilchoman distillery started production in late 2005; in location it is unlike the other distilleries, which are all by the sea. The newest distillery is Ardnahoe, the island&#x27;s ninth, which opened in 2019.

In general however, the whiskies from this island are known for a &quot;pungent peaty, smoky and oily flavours, with just a hint of salty sea air and seaweed&quot; because of the use of peat and the maritime climate. The Island&#x27;s own web site is more specific. Distilleries in the south make whisky which is &quot;medium-bodied ... saturated with peat-smoke, brine and iodine&quot; because they use malt that is heavy with peat as well as peaty water. Whisky from the northern area is milder because it is made using spring water for a &quot;lighter flavoured, mossy (rather than peaty), with some seaweed, some nuts...&quot; characteristic.

In future however, the whisky industry on this island may be moving to a broader range of products, some less peaty than the current majority as well as new types of whisky.

==Distilleries==
===Active distilleries===

===New distilleries===
Hunter Laing&#x27;s Ardnahoe Distillery, located between Port Askaig and Bunnahabhain, opened in April 2019, becoming Islay&#x27;s ninth distillery. 

A new distillery at Gartbreck Farm, just south of Bowmore, was planned in 2014 by Jean Donnay of Glann ar Mor Distillery in Brittany, France, as a joint venture with Hunter Laing of Glasgow but as of December 2018 the project was stalled over a land and management dispute. 

In 2020 Elixir Distillers broke ground on a new distillery, which is to be known as Portintruan, on the road between Port Ellen and Laphroaig.

===Closed distilleries===
The oldest record of a legal distillery on the island of Islay refers to Bowmore in 1779 and at one time there were up to 23 distilleries in operation. For example, Port Charlotte distillery operated from 1829 to 1929 and Port Ellen is also closed although it remains in business as a malthouse that supplies many of the Islay distilleries.

In March 2007 Bruichladdich Distillery announced the reopening of the distillery at Port Charlotte (&quot;Port Sgioba&quot; in Gaelic), which was closed in 1929, and was also known as the Lochindaal distillery.

<doc id="170531" wikidata="Q1136685" url="?curid=170531" title="Star Raiders">
<text>Star Raiders is a space combat simulator video game created by Doug Neubauer and published in 1980 by Atari, Inc. Originally released for the Atari 400/800 computers, &quot;Star Raiders&quot; was later ported to the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, and Atari ST. The player assumes the role of a starship fighter pilot, who must protect starbases from invading forces called Zylons. Piloting and combat are shown in the 3D cockpit view, while a 2D galactic map shows the state of the Zylon invasion. Neubauer made the game in his spare time at Atari, inspired by contemporary media such as &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;, as well as the 1971 mainframe game &quot;Star Trek&quot;. 

&quot;Star Raiders&quot; became one of the most successful games on Atari&#x27;s 400 and 800 computers, and their first killer app. It influenced space combat games such as &quot;Elite&quot; (1984) and &quot;Wing Commander&quot; (1990), 
as well as spawning an official sequel and a 2011 remake. &quot;Star Raiders&quot; was included in a list of ten games that were submitted as a game canon to the Library of Congress in 2007.

==Plot and gameplay==
&quot;Star Raiders&quot; is a space combat simulator set during a galactic war between the Atarian Federation and the Zylon Empire. The player assumes the role of the captain of the Elite Atarian Starship fleet, fighting the Zylons before they eliminate humanity. To win, the player must destroy the Zylon ships before they destroy the Atarian ship and before their own ship runs out of energy. 

&quot;Star Raiders&quot; is controlled using both a keyboard and a joystick. It is primarily experienced from a first-person, 3D cockpit view and larger, 2D map overviews for long-distance travel. The player can control the speed of travel in space, and the angle of display (rear and front-views), and engage a mini-display called the Attack Computer Display that displays the coordinates of enemy ships and other targets. In action sequences, the player will sometimes avoid or destroy asteroids before they damage their starship, while battling enemy ships using photon torpedoes. In this mode, the control panel displays the player&#x27;s velocity, energy, number of kills, and remaining targets; Energy is consumed by traversing space, using shields, and firing photon torpedoes; energy can be restored by matching coordinates with a friendly starbase. 

The player can activate a long-range scanner, which displays a top-down view of their ship and nearby targets. When the long-range scan is damaged, the player will see the objects in the area and false reflections of them. The player can also view a galactic chart, indicating the player&#x27;s location, enemy ships, and friendly star bases. The player engages the hyper-warp to visit new sectors. A subspace radio delivers messages through the galactic chart when star bases are surrounded or destroyed. Six types of equipment can be damaged in action, which is tracked using the acronym PESCLR (for photon torpedoes, engines, shields, computer, long-range scan, and radio). Damaged equipment will affect gameplay, engine damage, for example, slows ship&#x27;s movement. 

&quot;Star Raiders&quot;″ skill levels are Novice, Pilot, Warrior, and Commander. On high-difficulty levels, during hyperwarp moments, players must manually navigate their ship using crosshairs while warping. Zylon ships will move faster and strike more deliberately, with less randomness in their attack algorithm.

==Development==

Doug Neubauer worked as an electrical engineer before creating &quot;Star Raiders&quot;. While working at National Semiconductor, Neubauer programmed scenes with star backgrounds. 

National canceled its home computer projects, leading Neubauer to move to Atari, where design manager Richard Simone hired him. Neubauer became a key figure in the development of the POKEY sound chip, used in the Atari 400 and 800 computers. Using the sound chip he created, Neubauer tried to emulate the sound effects from &quot;Star Trek&quot;, such as explosions, engines, and photon torpedoes.
During a period where Atari had fewer hardware design needs, supervisor Jay Miner allowed Neubauer to work on software that eventually developed into &quot;Star Raiders&quot;. Neubauer said he &quot;just did [Star Raiders] for fun&quot; and that &quot;Atari was pretty laid back...I think &quot;Star Raiders&quot;, along with other early games, helped in finding any bugs in the Atari 400/800 chips&quot;. Development began in early 1979; Neubauer finished the game after eight to ten months.

Neubauer was inspired to make the game after discovering the text-based game &quot;Star Trek&quot; (1971). He said that it &quot;just didn&#x27;t look that interesting to play&quot;, but liked the idea of the galactic chart within the game. Neubauer wanted to create something that resembled 3D space combat for the system, and was inspired by science-fiction films such as &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968), &quot;THX 1138&quot; (1971) and &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977). He also cited the television series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; (1978) as an influence, specifically for the name of the Zylon enemies. Other game visuals such as the 3D cockpit point of view and the hyper warp were influenced by &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

Neubauer asked fellow employees if they had algorithms for 3D motion, with no success. This led him to spend weeks figuring out the equations without using sine and cosine, which he achieved using pen and paper. After figuring out an algorithm for 3D motion, Neubauer quickly developed a star field and explosions for the game. He described his code for it as &quot;crummy 16-bit multiplier code&quot; that slowed down the game during the explosions. Neubauer did not know how to use the graphics capabilities of the Atari 800 computer, and could only make the screen display two enemies at once. 
Neubauer initially designed the hyper warp system to involve calculations inspired by Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;The Stars, Like Dust&quot; (1951), but decided to abandon it as &quot;a dumb idea in terms of gameplay for an action game&quot;. The way enemies attacked star bases was also changed during development because Neubauer&#x27;s algorithm would sometimes make them adhere to the map while approaching star bases. This led him to add random variations to their paths to stop them adhering to the map. Due to the limited memory in the ROM cartridge, Neubauer also abandoned a feature that would allow players to dock at star bases.

At the end of &quot;Star Raiders&quot;, the player is ranked using humorous titles such as &quot;Galactic Cook&quot;, &quot;Garbage Scow Captain&quot; and &quot;Star Commander (Class 1)&quot;. Neubauer did not want a number-score system and instead applied a military ranking with humorous ratings to poorly performing players. One week before the game was to be ported to ROM cartridges, Neubauer was adjusting the difficulty of the game to earn certain rankings; playing at Commander difficulty is necessary for the higher ranks. He stated the game had &quot;a lot of ugly spaghetti code&quot; so &quot;Star Raiders&quot; could run on less-expensive Atari 400 computers and fit on an eight-kilobyte cartridge. 

==Release==

&quot;Star Raiders&quot; was released in March 1980. A port was released for the Atari 2600 in 1982, featuring an eight-button touch pad.
The following year, the game was ported to Atari 5200, becoming the first game to use all 12 buttons on the console&#x27;s gamepad. A 16-bit version of &quot;Star Raiders&quot; was released for the Atari ST computers.

The Atari 2600 version of the game was re-released in various compilations, such as the &quot;Atari 80 in One&quot; for Windows in 2003 and the &quot;Atari Anthology&quot; for PlayStation 2 and Xbox in 2004. The Atari 5200 version was included as part of the &quot;Atari 50&quot; (2022) compilation for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Steam, and Xbox One. This port of the game included additional content such as overlays that show player status and rumble effects when entering hyperspace.

==Reception==
By October 1982, the Atari 2600 port of &quot;Star Raiders&quot; was among the sixth-best-selling console releases and continued to be a top-ten release in November.

===Contemporaneous===
&quot;Star Raiders&quot; received positive reviews from various computer publications such as &quot;InfoWorld&quot;, &quot;Softline&quot;, and &quot;Byte&quot;. Joretta Klepfer of &quot;Compute!&quot; did not find the game intuitive, but noted that it was both exciting to play and watch, praising the 3D gameplay, use of color and sound. Jerry Pournelle reported that at the West Coast Computer Faire and National Computer Conference, &quot;the most popular exhibit was Atari&#x27;s ... boy did they stand in line for &quot;Star Raiders&quot;&quot;.

David C. Cole of &quot;InfoWorld&quot; said the game is &quot;graphically rich&quot; and noted its addictive qualities and challenge. Cole noted difficulty in the game, stating in more-difficult modes if the ship is damaged it is nearly impossible to locate a base for repairs. &quot;InfoWorld&#x27;s Essential Guide to Atari Computers&quot; cited &quot;Star Raiders&quot; as &quot;the most famous in the Atari world&quot;, but &quot;one of the least realistic&quot;. An anonymous reviewer in &quot;Softline&quot; also noted the game&#x27;s replayability and challenge, while describing the game as bigger and better than its peers made for the Atari 2600. The review concluded; &quot;the game stands repeat play well and remains quite difficult&quot;. Henry Allen echoed the praise in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, saying &quot;Star Raiders&quot; is like &quot;the best possible combination of a shooting gallery and a planetarium&quot;.

Greg Williams of &quot;Byte&quot; proclaimed &quot;no one – I repeat, no one – has created either a home-computer game or a coin-operated video game that is better than &quot;Star Raiders&quot;&quot;.&quot; He praised its 3D gameplay, color, sound, and controls while stating &quot;the feature that gives it life is its real-time animation&quot;. Williams concluded, &quot;to all software vendors, this is the game you have to surpass to get our attention&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s Curtis P. Feigel called &quot;Star Raiders&quot; &quot;the first, and so far the best ... &#x27;sit-in-&#x27;em&#x27;&quot; game. The author praised the comprehensiveness of its simulation of a one-man combat spacecraft, with plausible equipment, communications, vehicle damage, and flight.
 In &quot;Electronic Games&quot;, Bill Kunkel and Frank Laney found the game similar to previous Star Trek-styled games but said; &quot;it is far superior to all past efforts in this field&quot; and is the game that &quot;best demonstrates the outstanding videogame and computer capabilities of 6502-based machines&quot;. In the March 1983 issue of &quot;Softline&quot;, readers voted for &quot;Star Raiders&quot; as the best program for Atari computers, with 45% more ballots than the second-place contender &quot;Jawbreaker&quot; (1981).

From contemporaneous reviews of the game&#x27;s ports, &quot;The Video Game Update&quot; called it a &quot;classic space game&quot;, while criticizing the Atari 2600 version&#x27;s relative quality. Tim Onosko of &quot;The Capital Times&quot; wrote that the Atari 2600 version was poorly made with inadequate graphics, stating Activision&#x27;s similar game &quot;Starmaster&quot; was superior. &quot;The Video Game Update&quot; later reviewed the Atari 5200 version of &quot;Star Raiders&quot;, finding it to be essentially the same as the original home-computer game, and calling &quot;unquestionably one of the best space games in existence.&quot; Jack Schofield of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave a negative review to the Atari ST version, stating the improved graphics do not make &quot;Star Raiders&quot; a better game and that the original is &quot;still a brilliant game&quot;.

===Retrospective===
&quot;Star Raiders&quot; was included in GameSpot&#x27;s series &quot;The Great Games of All Time&quot;; writer Jeff Gerstmann stated the game has a level of complexity that is usually only found within text adventures of the era and that it launched the space simulation genre. In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; magazine ranked the original computer version of &quot;Star Raiders&quot; 46th on its list of &quot;Top 100 Video Games&quot;.

From retrospective reviews of the game ports, Mike Bevan of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; referred to the Atari 2600 version as a &quot;rather weak port&quot; with a smaller galactic chart. The game was more expensive than the average Atari 2600 game because it included a touch-screen pad controller. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot stated the Atari 2600 version &quot;was pretty good on its own, but one look at the Atari 400/800 version of the game was all it took to sour someone on the Atari 2600 version forever&quot;. A 16-bit version of &quot;Star Raiders&quot; was released for the Atari ST computers; according to Bevan, the controls feel &quot;floaty&quot;, low-quality graphics, and the game was slower-paced than the original.

==Legacy==
&quot;Star Raiders&quot; prompted several clones following its release. These include &quot;Phaser Patrol&quot;, &quot;Starmaster&quot;, &quot;Space Spartans&quot;, &quot;Sentinel&quot;, and &quot;Codename MAT&quot;. 
Schofield stated in 1986 &quot;Codename Mat&quot; and &quot;Sentinel&quot; were the better attempts. According to Barton and Loguidice, &quot;Star Raiders&quot; established many conventions that would be part of the space simulation genre that would rise with later games such as &quot;Elite&quot; (1984), &quot;Star Control&quot; (1990), and &quot;Wing Commander&quot; (1990).

Barton and Loguidice described &quot;Star Raiders&quot; is one of the best-known games for Atari&#x27;s 400 and 800 computers. The game remained popular throughout the 1980s; in 1987, readers of &quot;The Computer Entertainer&quot; voted for &quot;Star Raiders&quot; as the 14th favorite game of all time.
While &quot;Byte&quot; called it &quot;probably the single greatest contributor to the sales of Atari&#x27;s 400 and 800 series computers&quot;,
 and &quot;Gamasutra&quot; retroactively named it as the first killer app computer game, &quot;Star Raiders&quot;″s popularity contributed to the perception that Atari 8-bit were game machines like the Atari 2600, and not serious computers. When asked about the popularity of the game in 1986, Neubauer said: &quot;It&#x27;s pretty amazing, the way the game caught on. I think it was the first game to combine action with a strategy screen, and, luckily, the concept worked out pretty well.&quot; Neubauer also said the game &quot;looks pretty primitive&quot; by 1986 standards.

In 2007, Henry Lowood, the curator of the History of Science and Technology Collections at Stanford University, created a project to preserve video games. Lolwood submitted a list of games to the Library of Congress through a committee that included himself, game designers Warren Spector and Steve Meretzky, Matteo Bittanti, and &quot;Joystiq&quot; journalist Christopher Grant. &quot;Star Raiders&quot; was included in their initial game canon of ten submitted video games.

===Follow-ups===
Atari did not pay royalties to its developers, including Neubauer. He left the company but later did contract work for it. Atari later released &quot;Star Raiders II&quot; for several home computer systems. Bevan wrote in &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; that fans of &quot;Star Raiders&quot; sometimes considered Neubauer&#x27;s 1986 Atari 2600 game &quot;Solaris&quot; to be the &quot;true successor&quot; to the original game. Neubauer explained that &quot;Solaris&quot; was not a sequel, and that he preferred Star Raiders for its gameplay, cockpit view, and explosion graphics. In 1994, Atari promoted a game called &quot;Star Raiders 2000&quot; for the Atari Jaguar that was later retitled &quot;Space War 2000&quot;. The game was later cancelled.
Years later, Incinerator Studios developed a new version of &quot;Star Raiders&quot;, which was released in 2011. On the game&#x27;s release, it received &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot; according to Metacritic. Carolyn Petit of GameSpot compared the new version of game to the original, stating the original game is complex and ambitious with a sense of humor while the new version &quot;possesses none of the ambition or fun of its namesake&quot;.

<text>tcpdump is a data-network packet analyzer computer program that runs under a command line interface. It allows the user to display TCP/IP and other packets being transmitted or received over a network to which the computer is attached. Distributed under the BSD license, tcpdump is free software.

Tcpdump works on most Unix-like operating systems: Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, DragonFly BSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, OpenWrt, macOS, HP-UX 11i, and AIX. In those systems, tcpdump uses the libpcap library to capture packets. The port of tcpdump for Windows is called WinDump; it uses WinPcap, the Windows version of libpcap.

tcpdump was originally written in 1988 by Van Jacobson, Sally Floyd, Vern Paxson and Steven McCanne who were, at the time, working in the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Network Research Group. By the late 1990s there were numerous versions of tcpdump distributed as part of various operating systems, and numerous patches that were not well coordinated. Michael Richardson (mcr) and Bill Fenner created www.tcpdump.org in 1999.

==Common uses==
tcpdump prints the contents of network packets. It can read packets from a network interface card or from a previously created saved packet file. tcpdump can write packets to standard output or a file.

It is also possible to use tcpdump for the specific purpose of intercepting and displaying the communications of another user or computer. A user with the necessary privileges on a system acting as a router or gateway through which unencrypted traffic such as Telnet or HTTP passes can use tcpdump to view login IDs, passwords, the URLs and content of websites being viewed, or any other unencrypted information.

The user may optionally apply a BPF-based filter to limit the number of packets seen by tcpdump; this renders the output more usable on networks with a high volume of traffic.

Example of available capture interfaces on a Linux system:

$ tcpdump -D
1.eth0 [Up, Running, Connected]
2.any (Pseudo-device that captures on all interfaces) [Up, Running]
3.lo [Up, Running, Loopback]
4.bluetooth-monitor (Bluetooth Linux Monitor) [Wireless]
5.usbmon2 (Raw USB traffic, bus number 2)
6.usbmon1 (Raw USB traffic, bus number 1)
7.usbmon0 (Raw USB traffic, all USB buses) [none]
8.nflog (Linux netfilter log (NFLOG) interface) [none]
9.nfqueue (Linux netfilter queue (NFQUEUE) interface) [none]
10.dbus-system (D-Bus system bus) [none]
11.dbus-session (D-Bus session bus) [none]
12.bluetooth0 (Bluetooth adapter number 0)
13.eth1 [none, Disconnected]
==Privileges required==
In some Unix-like operating systems, a user must have superuser privileges to use tcpdump because the packet capturing mechanisms on those systems require elevated privileges. However, the -Z option may be used to drop privileges to a specific unprivileged user after capturing has been set up. In other Unix-like operating systems, the packet capturing mechanism can be configured to allow non-privileged users to use it; if that is done, superuser privileges are not required.

<text>Starpath was a U.S. company known for creating the Starpath Supercharger in August 1982. The company was founded under the name Arcadia Corporation in 1981 by Alan Bayley, Robert Brown, and Craig Nelson. It changed its name to Starpath shortly after for trademark reasons because Emerson Radio Corporation had released a video game console named the Emerson Arcadia 2001.

The Starpath Supercharger is a peripheral cartridge for the Atari 2600 video game console that expands the machine capabilities by adding more RAM, allowing for higher resolution graphics and larger games, and by providing a connector to which a regular cassette player can be connected, thus permitting larger games, stored on tape, to be loaded.

As the video game console market collapsed Starpath&#x27;s fortunes began to worsen. Sales of their existing titles were in a steep decline as the console market flooded with games. Retailers were also uninterested in stocking new titles as they couldn&#x27;t sell what they already had. Without enough capital to switch to developing for the home computer market Starpath looked for a buyer. Epyx, which shared some board members with Starpath, would purchase the company in 1984. Several development staff continued to work at Epyx after the merger and transitioned to making home computer games. One of the last titles in development at Starpath, &#x27;Sweat! The Decathlon Game&#x27; for a Supercharger equipped Atari 2600, was redeveloped as a Commodore 64 game. Rechristened Summer Games it became a big hit for Epyx and resulting in a long succession of ports, sequels, and spinoffs. Scott Nelson, the developer of Sweat!, worked on both Summer Games and its direct sequel Summer Games II. , rights to Starpath games are owned by Bridgestone Multimedia, a religious multimedia company.

<text>The Starpath Supercharger (originally called the Arcadia Supercharger) is an expansion peripheral cartridge created by Starpath, for playing cassette-based proprietary games on the Atari 2600 video game console.

The device consists of a long cartridge with a handle on the end, and an audio cassette cable. It adds 6 KB to the Atari 2600&#x27;s 128 bytes of RAM for a total of 6,272 bytes of RAM, allowing for the creation of specially compatible games which are larger and have higher resolution graphics than normal cartridges. A cable coming out of the side of the cartridge plugs into the earphone jack of any standard cassette player, for loading all Supercharger games from standard audio cassettes.

==Games==
All Supercharger games were developed by Starpath.

;Initial releases
Listed in order of release:
#&quot;Phaser Patrol&quot;
#&quot;Communist Mutants from Space&quot;
#&quot;Fireball&quot;
#&quot;Suicide Mission&quot;
#&quot;Escape from the Mindmaster&quot; (prototype is called &quot;Labyrinth&quot;)
#&quot;Dragonstomper&quot; (prototype is called &quot;Excalibur&quot;)
#&quot;Killer Satellites&quot;
#&quot;Rabbit Transit&quot;
#&quot;Frogger, The Official&quot;
#&quot;Party Mix&quot;

;Mail order releases
These games were available only via mail order after Starpath declared bankruptcy.
*&quot;Sword of Saros&quot;
*&quot;Survival Island&quot; 

;Prototypes
*&quot;Sweat: The Decathlon Game&quot;
*&quot;Going Up??&quot;

==Compatibility==

The Supercharger is compatible with Atari 2600, Atari 2600 Jr., and the Sears Video Arcade consoles.

Due to the shape of the Supercharger, it does not normally fit into the ColecoVision&#x27;s Expansion Module #1, which is an adapter that allows the ColecoVision to play Atari 2600 games. However, if the cover of the expansion module is removed or an extender is used, the Supercharger will work. Extenders were sent to customers who called Starpath about such issues.

The Supercharger does not work on many Atari 7800 systems (which is typically backward compatible with the Atari 2600), although it does with some early models of the system. After Atari installed a circuit to fix a compatibility issue with the 2600 version of &quot;Dark Chambers&quot;, it subsequently caused incompatibility with the Supercharger and some other games that use the FE bank switching method.

==Reception==
Danny Goodman of &quot;Creative Computing Video &amp; Arcade Games&quot; said that the Supercharger&#x27;s &quot;graphics are something else&quot;, reporting that the diagonal lines in one game under development were among the smoothest he had seen in any console.

==Legacy==
The complete library of games, including the prototype &quot;Sweat&quot;, was also released on audio CD as &quot;Stella Gets A New Brain&quot; by CyberPuNKS (Jim Nitchals, Dan Skelton, Glenn Saunders and Russ Perry Jr.). There are two releases, both sanctioned by Atari and Bridgestone Multimedia, who had obtained the rights to the Starpath library some time ago. The first release is a limited number not-for-profit product, which also includes the previously unreleased Atari prototype, &quot;Polo&quot; by Carol Shaw. The second release includes the Supercharger prototypes &quot;Meteoroid&quot; (an early version of &quot;Suicide Mission&quot;) and Excalibur (an early version of &quot;Dragonstomper&quot;), in addition to a number of homebrew games by permission of their respective authors, and the song &quot;Atari 2600&quot; by Splitsville, fully licensed from the band.

<text>William de Braose (or William de Briouze), First Lord of Bramber (died 1093/1096) was previously lord of Briouze, Normandy. He was granted lands in England by William the Conqueror soon after he and his followers had invaded and controlled Saxon England.

== Norman victor ==

Braose had been given extensive lands in Sussex by 1073. He became feudal baron of the Rape of Bramber where he built Bramber Castle. Braose was also awarded lands around Wareham and Corfe in Dorset, two manors in Surrey, Southcote in Berkshire and Downton in Wiltshire, and became one of the most powerful of the new feudal barons of the early Norman era.

He continued to bear arms alongside King William in campaigns in England, and Normandy and Maine in France.

He was a pious man and made considerable grants to the Abbey of Saint Florent, in Saumur, and endowed the foundation of priories at Sele near Bramber and at Briouze.

He was soon occupying a new Norman castle at Bramber, guarding the strategically important harbour at Steyning, and began a vigorous boundary dispute and power struggle with the monks of Fécamp Abbey in Normandy, to whom William the Conqueror had granted Steyning, brought to a head by the Domesday Book, completed in 1086.

== Land disputes==
Braose built a bridge at Bramber and demanded tolls from ships travelling further along the river to the busy port at Steyning. The monks challenged this, and they also disputed Braose&#x27;s right to bury people in the churchyard of his new church of Saint Nicholas at Bramber, demanding the burial fees for themselves, despite the church&#x27;s having been built to serve the castle and not the town. The monks then produced forged documents to defend their position and were unhappy with the failure of their claim on Hastings, which was very similar. They claimed the same freedoms and land tenure in Hastings as King Edward the Confessor had given them at Steyning. On a technicality, King William was bound to uphold all rights and freedoms held by the abbey before King Edward&#x27;s death, but the monks had already been expelled ten years before that. William wanted to hold Hastings for himself for strategic reasons, and he ignored the problem until 1085, when he confirmed the abbey&#x27;s claims to Steyning but compensated it for its claims at Hastings with land in the manor of Bury, near Pulborough in Sussex. In 1086 King William called his sons, barons and bishops to court (the last time an English king presided personally, with his full court, to decide a matter of law) to settle the Steyning disputes, which took a full day. The result was that the abbey won over William de Braose, forcing him to curtail his bridge tolls, to give up various encroachments onto the abbey&#x27;s lands, including a farmed rabbit warren, a park, 18 burgage tenements, a causeway, and a channel used to fill his moat. Braose also had to organise a mass exhumation of all Bramber&#x27;s dead, the bodies being transferred to the abbey&#x27;s churchyard of Saint Cuthman&#x27;s in Steyning.

==Progeny==
William de Braose was succeeded as Lord of Bramber by his son, Philip de Braose, and started an important Anglo-Norman dynasty (see House of Braose).

==Death==
William de Braose was present in 1093 at the consecration of a church in Briouze, his manor of origin whence originates his family name, thus he was still alive in that year. However, his son Philip was issuing charters as Lord of Bramber in 1096, indicating that William de Braose died sometime between 1093 and 1096.

<text>Wizardry is a series of role-playing video games originally created by American publisher Sir-Tech. The series was influential in the evolution of modern role-playing video games alongside &quot;Ultima&quot; and &quot;Might and Magic&quot;. The original &quot;Wizardry&quot; was a significant influence on early console role-playing games such as &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot;, &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot;, &quot;the Shining series&quot;, &quot;Fire Emblem&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;. Originally made for the Apple II, the games were later ported to other platforms. The last game in the original series by Sir-Tech was &quot;Wizardry 8&quot;, released in 2001. There have since been various spin-off titles developed for the Japanese market.

==Development==
&quot;Wizardry&quot; began as a simple dungeon crawl by Andrew C. Greenberg and Robert Woodhead. It was written when they were students at Cornell University and published by Sir-Tech. The game was influenced by earlier games from the PLATO system, most notably &quot;Oubliette&quot;. The earliest installments of &quot;Wizardry&quot; were very successful, as they were the first graphically-rich incarnations of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;-type gameplay for home computers. The release of the first version coincided with the first wave of Dungeons &amp; Dragons&#x27; popularity in North America.

The first five games in the series were written in Apple Pascal, an implementation of UCSD Pascal. They were ported to many different platforms by writing UCSD Pascal implementations for the target machines (Mac II cross-development). David W. Bradley took over the series after the fourth installment, adding a new level of plot and complexity. In 1998, the rights were transferred to 1259190 Ontario Inc., and in 2006, to Aeria IPM. In 2008, Aeria IPM merged with Gamepot, the developer of &quot;Wizardry Online&quot; and in 2017, Gamepot was shut down and absorbed into its parent company GMO Internet. Drecom announced they had acquired &quot;Wizardry&quot; from GMO Internet on October 29, 2020.

In May 2024, a 3D remake of with the same name as the original was released on modern platforms. Said remake was developed by Digital Eclipse, who wasn&#x27;t previously involved with the &quot;Wizardry series.&quot;

Datamost released the menu-driven &quot;WizPlus&quot;, a utility program that allowed users to make changes to both the characters and also to the playing environment of &quot;Wizardry&quot;; Bob Reams reviewed the utility for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, and said that &quot;&quot;WizPlus&quot; should be used with great caution or the spirit of adventuring will be diluted and, more importantly, you will not be able to continue with this exciting series&quot;.

==Games==
===Main series===
The original &quot;Wizardry&quot; series is composed of eight different titles. All of the titles were first released in North America, and then ported to Japanese computers. Some of the titles were also officially released in Europe. The first three games are a trilogy, with similar settings, plots, and gameplay mechanics. A second trilogy is formed by installments 6 through 8 – &quot;Bane of the Cosmic Forge&quot;, &quot;Crusaders of the Dark Savant&quot; and &quot;Wizardry 8&quot; – with settings and gameplay mechanics that differed greatly from the first trilogy. The fourth game, &quot;The Return of Werdna&quot;, was a significant departure from the rest of the series. In it, the player controls Werdna (&quot;Andrew&quot;, one of the game&#x27;s developers, spelled backwards), the evil wizard slain in the first game, and summons groups of monsters to aid him as he fights his way through the prison in which he had been held captive. Rather than monsters, the player faced typical adventuring parties, some of which were pulled from actual user disks sent to Sir-Tech for recovery. Further, the player had only a limited number of keystrokes to use to complete the game.

In Japan, the &quot;Wizardry&quot; series was translated by ASCII Entertainment, and became very influential during the 1980s, even as its popularity at home declined. When first introduced, the games suffered from the culture barrier compounded by low-quality translation. This meant that the game was taken seriously by players who overlooked the in-game jokes and parodies. For example, &quot;Blade Cusinart&quot; was introduced in early games as &quot;a legendary sword made by the famous blacksmith, Cusinart &quot; but its meaning was misinterpreted because Cuisinart food processors were virtually unknown in Japan. However, this misconception appealed to early computer gamers who were looking for something different and made the &quot;Wizardry&quot; series popular. Conversely, the fourth game, &quot;The Return of Werdna&quot;, was poorly received, as, lacking the knowledge of subcultures necessary to solving the game, Japanese players had no chance of figuring out some puzzles.

The eight main titles in the series are:

=== American spin-off game ===
In 1996, the series received the first (and, so far, only) spin-off developed in North America, titled &quot;Nemesis: The Wizardry Adventure&quot;. Every other Wizardry spin-off has been developed in Japan. 

&quot;Nemesis&quot; is played as a solo adventure: one character only, with no supporting party or monsters. All players use the same character, without the ability to choose class or attributes. In addition, the game contains only 16 spells, compared to 50 in the first four adventures, and more in the subsequent ones. It is also the first &quot;Wizardry&quot; title where the player saw enemies in advance and thus could try to avoid them.

===Japanese spin-off games===
The popularity of &quot;Wizardry&quot; in Japan inspired several original sequels, spin-offs, and ports, with the series long outliving the American original. As of 2022, thirty-nine different spin-offs were released in Japan, with six of them being localized and released worldwide. The latest released in both Japanese and English in 2024.

==== Wizardry Gaiden ====
==== Wizardry Empire ====
All the games in this sub-series were developed by Starfish SD.
==== Busin Wizardry ====
==== Wizardry XTH ====
==== Wizardry Renaissance ====
==== Standalone Japanese games ====
==== Japan-only mobile games ====
Due to the nature of the Japanese mobile system, English localisations of the following games are unlikely.
==Reception==
The original &quot;Wizardry&quot; game was a success, selling 24,000 copies by June 1982, just nine months after its release according to Softalk&#x27;s sales surveys. In the June 1983 issue of &quot;Electronic Games&quot;, &quot;Wizardry&quot; was described as &quot;without a doubt, the most popular fantasy adventure game for the Apple II at the present time&quot;. While noting limitations such as the inability to divide the party, or the emphasis on combat over role-playing, the magazine stated that &quot;no other game comes closer to providing the type of contest favored by most players of non-electronic role-playing games... one outstanding programming achievement, and an absolute &#x27;must buy&#x27; for those fantasy gamers who own an Apple&quot;. In the May–June 1982, issue of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, the reviewer praised &quot;Wizardry&quot; as setting a standard by which all fantasy role playing games should be compared to, and call it an all time classic. The series had sold over 1.5 million copies by 1987, 2 million by 1992, and over 5 million by 1996.

Spin-offs originally released in Japan received generally positive reviews in North America. GameSpot reviewed &quot;Wizardry: Tale of the Forsaken Land&quot; in 2002, and awarded it a score of 8.5 out of 10. In 2011, &quot;Wizardry: Labyrinth of Lost Souls&quot; was also reviewed by GameSpot and received a score of 7.5 out of 10. In Japan, readers of &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine considered the Famicom port of the original &quot;Wizardry I&quot; to be one of the 100 best games of all time. The series was ranked as the 60th top game (collectively) by &quot;Next Generation&quot; in 1996. They cited the huge dungeons with elaborate quests and tons of differing enemies. Fans of the series included Robin Williams, Harry Anderson, and the Crown Prince of Bahrain; the latter even called Sir-Tech on the phone.

==Legacy==
===Innovation in gameplay===
Together with the &quot;Ultima&quot; series, &quot;Wizardry&quot; established the conventions of role-playing video games. The command-driven battle system with a still image of the monster being fought would be emulated in later games, such as &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot;, &quot;Shining Force&quot;, &quot;Fire Emblem&quot;, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, and &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;. The party-based combat in &quot;Wizardry&quot; also inspired Richard Garriott to include a similar party-based system in &quot;Ultima III: Exodus&quot;. Other user interface elements were influential in Japanese role-playing games. The later &quot;Wizardry&quot; games implemented multiple endings, some of which were only accessible to people who imported characters from previous games.

&quot;Wizardry&quot; features what would later be called prestige classes. Aside from the traditional character classes, such as fighter, players could take more advanced ones that combined the abilities of multiple classes if they had the right attributes and alignment. In the early &quot;Wizardry&quot; games, some classes were inaccessible during character creation due to the high requirements; this meant the player needed to first gain levels and then change their class. &quot;Wizardry VI&quot; allowed starting with any class if the player invested enough time during the random character attribute generation.

===Influence on subsequent games===
&quot;Wizardry&quot; inspired many clones and served as a template for role-playing video games. Some notable series that trace their look and feel to &quot;Wizardry&quot; include 1985&#x27;s &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; and the &quot;Might and Magic&quot; series. The specific &quot;Wizardry&quot; formula, that of a turn based RPG taking place primarily in a dungeon via first person exploration, is referred to as a dungeon crawl.

&quot;Wizardry&quot; is the major inspiration to the Nintendo DS title &quot;The Dark Spire&quot;. While the game follows its own story and maps, much of the game uses the same game play mechanics, even going so far as including a &quot;classic&quot; mode that removes all of the game&#x27;s graphics, replacing them with a wireframe environment, 8-bit-style sprites for monsters and characters, and chiptune music. The game&#x27;s publisher, Atlus, also published another Wizardry spin-off, &quot;&quot;.

While designing the popular Japanese role-playing game &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, Yuji Horii drew inspiration from the &quot;Wizardry&quot; series, 1986&#x27;s &quot;Mugen no Shinzou&quot; (&quot;Heart of Phantasm&quot;), and the &quot;Ultima&quot; series of games. Horii&#x27;s obsession with &quot;Wizardry&quot; was manifested as an easter egg in one of his earlier games, &quot;The Portopia Serial Murder Case&quot; in 1983. In a dungeon-crawling portion of that adventure game, a note on the wall reads &quot;MONSTER SURPRISED YOU&quot;. 

Wizardry&#x27;s legacy continued in Japan after the parent company ended, with titles such as &quot;Wizardry Gaiden&quot;, &quot;Wizardry Empire&quot;, and &quot;Wizardry XTH&quot;, being developed after the original games were released and generally keeping the same tropes, themes, and mechanics.

Notably &quot;Wizardry XTH: Academy of Frontier&quot; swapped the original&#x27;s Gothic themes for a modern day military school setting, adding item crafting and party member compatibility to the Wizardry formula. Much like the original Wizardry, XTH spawned a direct storyline sequel, &quot;Wizardry XTH: Unlimited Students&quot;. The second XTH game was used as the basis for and shared code with &quot;Class of Heroes&quot;, which swapped the modern science fiction elements for a combination of High School, High Fantasy, and Anime aesthetics. Class of Heroes would go on to spawn several sequels and spinoffs itself.

Following the shutdown of Michaelsoft, the director of &quot;Wizardry XTH&quot;, Motoya Ataka took a group of programmers he called &quot;Team Muramasa&quot; that had worked on &quot;Empire&quot; and &quot;XTH&quot; and went on to found Experience Inc., creating a series of PC games with Wizardry XTH&#x27;s mechanics called &quot;Generation Xth&quot;. These would later be ported to the PlayStation Vita, their ports localized as &quot;Operation Abyss&quot; and &quot;Operation Babel&quot;. Experience would go on to create several other DRPGs using &quot;Wizardry&quot;″s mechanics as a starting point, including &quot;Students of the Round&quot;, &quot;Stranger of Sword City&quot;, and &quot;Demon Gaze&quot;.

Starfish, the development team behind &quot;Wizardry Empire&quot;, would later go on to create &quot;Elminage&quot;, a series of DRPGs that retained the original Gothic aesthetic (and difficulty) of the western &quot;Wizardry&quot; games. &quot;Elminage&quot; was notable for using the expanded &quot;kemonojin&quot; races from &quot;Wizardry Asterisk&quot;, also by Starfish, as well as the summoner class from &quot;Wizardry: Summoner&quot; —these included &quot;Were-Beast&quot;, &quot;Dragonnewt&quot;, &quot;Fairy&quot;, and &quot;Devilkin&quot; as well as expanded classes such as &quot;Brawler&quot; (a hand to hand melee specialist), &quot;Alchemist&quot; (a combination crafting class and spellcaster), and &quot;Summoner&quot; (a spellcasting class that can tame and summon monsters from the dungeon). These &quot;expanded&quot; Japanese Wizardry mechanics would be reused in future Elminage games as well as notably &quot;Class of Heroes&quot;.

After cancellation of &quot;Wizardry: Stones of Arnhem&quot; in the mid 1990s, one of the developers, Cleveland Mark Blakemore, started work on the game &quot;&quot; which is heavily inspired by &quot;Wizardry&quot;. It was eventually released in August 2017.

===Wizardry Renaissance===
In 2009, several Japanese publishers and development teams started a &quot;Brand Revitalization plan&quot;, which they called the &quot;Wizardry Renaissance&quot;. After Sir-Tech, the original &quot;Wizardry&quot; creator in the US, was dissolved, several semi-official games were created in Japan of varying quality and thematic elements. &quot;Wizardry Renaissance&quot; aimed to &quot;rebuild&quot; the brand by agreeing to a certain &quot;worldview&quot; and quality standards to these semi-official &quot;Wizardry&quot; games.

Wizardry Renaissance titles include:
* &quot;Wizardry Online&quot;, a PC MMORPG, shut down in 2016.
* &quot;Wizardry: Torawareshi Tamashii no Meikyū&quot;, a PlayStation 3, iOS, Vita, and PC RPG (localized in the West as &quot;&quot;).
* &quot;Wizardry: Seimei no Kusabi&quot;, a Nintendo DS title.
* &quot;Wizardry: Bōkyaku no Isan&quot;, a Nintendo DS title, which re-used elements from &quot;Seimei no Kusabi&quot;.
* &quot;Wizardry Online Mobile&quot;, a mobile phone MMORPG, shut down in 2011.
* &quot;Wizardry: Torawareshi Bōrei no Machi&quot;, a PlayStation 3 RPG.
* &quot;Tōkyō Meikyū – Wizardry 0&quot;, a social-networking card-battle RPG using the Mobage service on smartphones, shut down sometime in 2012.
* &quot;Wizardry: Senran no Matō&quot;, a social-networking RPG for smartphones, shut down in 2015.
* &quot;Wizardry Schema&quot;, an incremental game RPG for smartphones, shut down in 2017.
* &quot;Wizrogue: Labyrinth of Wizardry&quot;, an isometric roguelike RPG with &quot;gacha&quot; game elements, originally shut down in 2015, it was re-launched in 2017 with the gacha elements removed.

These titles were released from late 2009 to 2016; the latest activity is the port of &quot;&quot; to the PC in January 2020.

===Related media===
The popularity of &quot;Wizardry&quot; in Japan also inspired various light novels, manga comics, Japanese pen-and-paper role-playing games, and an original video animation, produced by TMS Entertainment. A popular light novel series titled &quot;Sword Art Online&quot; also had a character who stated that his inspiration came from this game. Most have been released only in Japan, but Goblin Slayer is one such light novel series published in English by Yen Press.

<text>Fallout is a media franchise of post-apocalyptic role-playing video games created by Tim Cain and Leonard Boyarsky, at Interplay Entertainment. The series is largely set during the first half of the 3rd millennium, following a devastating nuclear war between China and the United States, with an atompunk retrofuturistic setting and artwork influenced by the post-war culture of the 1950s United States, with its combination of hope for the promises of technology and the lurking fear of nuclear annihilation. &quot;Fallout&quot; is regarded as a spiritual successor to &quot;Wasteland&quot;, a 1988 game developed by Interplay Productions.

The series&#x27; first title, &quot;Fallout&quot;, was developed by Black Isle Studios and released in 1997, and its sequel, &quot;Fallout 2,&quot; the following year. With the tactical role-playing game &quot;Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel&quot;, development was handed to Micro Forté and 14 Degrees East. In 2004, Interplay closed Black Isle Studios, and continued to produce &quot;&quot;, an action game with role-playing elements for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, without Black Isle Studios. &quot;Fallout 3&quot;, the third entry in the main series, was released in 2008 by Bethesda Softworks, and was followed by &quot;&quot;, developed by Obsidian Entertainment released on October 19, 2010. &quot;Fallout 4&quot; was released in 2015, and &quot;Fallout 76&quot; released on November 14, 2018.

Bethesda Softworks owns the rights to the &quot;Fallout&quot; intellectual property. After acquiring it, Bethesda licensed the rights to make a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) version of &quot;Fallout&quot; to Interplay. The MMORPG got as far as beta stage under Interplay, but a prolonged legal battle between Bethesda Softworks and Interplay disrupted the development of the game, eventually resulting in its cancellation. Bethesda argued in court that Interplay had failed to fulfill the terms and conditions of the licensing contract. The case reached a resolution in early 2012.

== Origins ==
The ideas of the &quot;Fallout&quot; series began with Interplay Productions&#x27; &quot;Wasteland&quot;, released in 1988. At that time, Interplay was not a publisher and used Electronic Arts for distribution of the game. According to Interplay&#x27;s founder, Brian Fargo, they wanted to explore a post-apocalyptic setting and created &quot;Wasteland&quot; for that. Sometime after release, Interplay decided to shift focus and become a publisher while still developing games. Fargo wanted to continue to use the &quot;Wasteland&quot; intellectual property but could not negotiate the rights back from Electronic Arts. Still wanting to do something in a post-apocalyptic setting, Fargo and his team decided to make a new setting and game. They determined what aspects of &quot;Wasteland&quot; were positives and wrote and developed a new game around them. The result was the first &quot;Fallout&quot; games, which were released nearly ten years after &quot;Wasteland&quot;.

== Games ==


=== Main series ===
==== &quot;Fallout&quot; (1997) ====
Released in October 1997, &quot;Fallout&quot; takes place in a post-apocalyptic Southern California, beginning in the year 2161. The protagonist, referred to as &quot;the Vault Dweller&quot;, is tasked with recovering a water chip in the Wasteland to replace the broken one in their underground shelter home, Vault 13. Afterwards, the Vault Dweller must thwart the plans of a group of mutants, led by a grotesque entity named &quot;the Master&quot;. &quot;Fallout&quot; was originally intended to run under the &quot;GURPS&quot; role-playing game system. However, a disagreement with the creator of &quot;GURPS&quot;, Steve Jackson, over the game&#x27;s violent content required Black Isle Studios to develop the new SPECIAL system. &quot;Fallout&quot;″s atmosphere and artwork are reminiscent of post–World War II United States during the Cold War era and the fear that the country was headed for nuclear war in the real world.

==== &quot;Fallout 2&quot; (1998) ====
&quot;Fallout 2&quot; was released in October 1998, with several improvements over the first game, including an improved engine, the ability to set attitudes of non-player characters (NPC) party members and the ability to push people who are blocking doors. Additional features included several changes, including significantly more pop culture jokes and parodies, such as multiple special random encounters referencing Monty Python and &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, and self-parodying dialogue that broke the fourth wall to mention game mechanics. &quot;Fallout 2&quot; takes place eighty years after &quot;Fallout&quot;, and centers around a descendant of the Vault Dweller, the protagonist of &quot;Fallout&quot;. The player assumes the role of &quot;the Chosen One&quot; (Vault Dweller&#x27;s actual grandchild) as they try to save their village, Arroyo, from famine and droughts. After saving the village, the Chosen One must fight the Enclave, the remnants of the pre-war United States government (as well as the shadow government in charge of the vault project).

==== &quot;Fallout 3&quot; (2008) ====

&quot;Fallout 3&quot; was developed by Bethesda Game Studios and released on October 28, 2008. The story picks up thirty years after the setting of &quot;Fallout 2&quot; and 200 years after the nuclear war that devastated the game&#x27;s world. The player-character is a Vault dweller in Vault 101 who is forced to flee when the Overseer tries to arrest them in response to their father leaving the Vault. Once out, the player is dubbed the Lone Wanderer and ventures into the Wasteland in and around Washington, D.C., known as the Capital Wasteland, to find their father. It differs from previous games in the series by utilizing 3D graphics, a free-roam gaming world, and real-time combat, in contrast to previous games&#x27; 2D isometric graphics and turn-based combat. It was developed for the PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 using the Gamebryo engine. It received highly positive reviews, garnering 94 out of 100, 92 out of 100, and 93 out of 100 averages scores on Metacritic for the PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game, respectively. It won IGN&#x27;s 2008 Overall Game of the Year Award, Xbox 360 Game of the Year, Best RPG, and Best Use of Sound, as well as E3&#x27;s Best of the Show and Best Role Playing Game.
==== &quot;Fallout 4&quot; (2015) ====

&quot;Fallout 4&quot;, developed by Bethesda Game Studios, was released on November 10, 2015. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and takes place in Boston, Massachusetts, of the in-game New England Commonwealth and features voiced protagonists. The Xbox One version has been confirmed to have mods . Bethesda also confirmed mods for PlayStation 4, after lengthy negotiations with Sony. A virtual reality version of the game was released on December 11, 2017, available on SteamVR. &quot;Fallout 4&quot; takes place in the year 2287, ten years after the events of &quot;Fallout 3&quot;. &quot;Fallout 4&quot;″s story begins on the day the bombs dropped: October 23, 2077. The player&#x27;s character (voiced by either Brian T. Delaney or Courtenay Taylor), dubbed as the Sole Survivor, takes shelter in Vault 111, emerging 210 years later, after being subjected to suspended animation. The Sole Survivor goes on a search for their son who was taken away from the Vault.

==== &quot;Fallout 5&quot; (TBA) ====
In June 2022, Todd Howard stated in an interview that &quot;Fallout 5&quot; would begin development after the completion of &quot;The Elder Scrolls VI&quot;, with an unspecified release window.

=== Spin-offs ===
==== &quot;Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel&quot; (2001) ====
&quot;Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel&quot; is the first &quot;Fallout&quot; game not to require the player to fight in a turn-based mode, and the first to allow the player to customize the skills, perks, and combat actions of the rest of the party. &quot;Fallout Tactics&quot; focuses on tactical combat rather than role-playing; the new combat system included different modes, stances, and modifiers, but the player had no dialogue options. Most of the criticisms of the game came from its incompatibility with the story of the original two games, not from its gameplay. &quot;Fallout Tactics&quot; includes a multiplayer mode that allows players to compete against squads of other characters controlled by other players. Unlike the previous two games, which are based in California, &quot;Fallout Tactics&quot; takes place in the Midwestern United States. The game was released in early 2001 to generally favorable reviews. In 2020, Emil Pagliarulo stated that elements and lore from &quot;Fallout Tactics&quot; have been used in Bethesda Softworks&#x27; subsequent entries in the series.

==== &quot;Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel&quot; (2004) ====
&quot;Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel&quot; became the first &quot;Fallout&quot; game for consoles when it was released in 2004. It follows an initiate in the Brotherhood of Steel who is given a suicidal quest to find several lost Brotherhood Paladins. &quot;Brotherhood of Steel&quot; is an action role-playing game, representing a significant break from previous incarnations of the &quot;Fallout&quot; series in both gameplay and aesthetics. The game does not feature non-player characters that accompany the player in combat and uses heavy metal music, including Slipknot, Devin Townsend, and Killswitch Engage, which stands in contrast to the music of the earlier &quot;Fallout&quot; games, performed by The Ink Spots and Louis Armstrong. It was the last &quot;Fallout&quot; game developed by Interplay.

==== &quot;Fallout: New Vegas&quot; (2010) ====

Fallout: New Vegas is a 2010 action role-playing game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Bethesda Softworks. Set in the post-apocalyptic Mojave Wasteland in the year 2281, the game follows the story of the Courier, a mysterious protagonist left for dead after being ambushed while delivering a valuable package. Unlike previous Fallout entries, introduces multiple factions vying for control over the region, with the New California Republic (NCR), Caesar’s Legion, and the enigmatic Mr. House serving as key power players. The game is renowned for its deep branching narrative, player choice, and freedom in shaping the story. Gameplay is built on the same engine as Fallout 3, featuring first- and third-person combat, open-world exploration, and a robust dialogue system that significantly impacts the game’s progression. The inclusion of Hardcore Mode, which requires players to manage hunger, thirst, and sleep, adds an extra layer of survival realism. The game’s setting, inspired by real-world Las Vegas, features recognizable landmarks such as the New Vegas Strip, Hoover Dam, and the surrounding desert landscape filled with mutated creatures, raiders, and vaults containing hidden secrets. Players can choose to side with one of the major factions, forge their own independent path, or manipulate events to suit their personal goals. The game also features an extensive modding community that has kept it alive for years, with numerous fan-made expansions and graphical enhancements. Despite a rocky launch plagued with bugs, has since become a cult classic, often praised for its writing, dark humor, and deep role-playing mechanics. The game&#x27;s DLC expansions—Dead Money, Honest Hearts, Old World Blues, and Lonesome Road—further expand on the lore, introducing new characters, environments, and moral dilemmas. Over a decade after its release, remains a benchmark for storytelling in open-world RPGs, often considered the pinnacle of the Fallout series due to its player agency and world-building. Its legacy endures, with fans still hoping for a sequel or a modern remaster that could bring the game’s beloved wasteland back to life.

==== &quot;Fallout Shelter&quot; (2015) ====
&quot;Fallout Shelter&quot; is a simulation game for Microsoft Windows, iOS, Android, Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. The player acts as the Overseer, building and managing their Vault and its dwellers, sending them into the Wasteland on scouting missions and defending the Vault from attacks. Unlike the main entries in the franchise, this game has no ending and mostly revolves around attempting to keep the people who live in the vault, an intricate fallout shelter, alive. The game uses microtransactions, a form of in-game purchases, that take the form of Nuka-Cola quantum, the game&#x27;s &quot;premium&quot; currency; lunch boxes, an item that would give a random mixture of in-game items; pet carriers, something that would contain a pet, which can boost a single dweller&#x27;s stats; and &quot;Mister Handys&quot; or &quot;Snip-Snips&quot; (same thing different skin), robots who can harvest the games materials or be assigned to outside the vault to harvest bottle caps, the game&#x27;s currency. &quot;Fallout Shelter&quot; was released for iOS on June 14, 2015, Android on August 13, 2015, and for PC on July 15, 2016. On February 7, 2017, Bethesda launched &quot;Fallout Shelter&quot; on Xbox One. On June 10, 2018, Bethesda announced and launched &quot;Fallout Shelter&quot; on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

==== &quot;Fallout Pinball&quot; (2016) ====
In late 2016, Zen Studios developed a virtual pinball game based on the &quot;Fallout&quot; universe as part of the &quot;Bethesda Pinball&quot; collection, which became available as part of &quot;Zen Pinball 2&quot;, &quot;Pinball FX 2&quot; and &quot;Pinball FX 3&quot;, as well as a separate free-to-play app for iOS and Android mobile devices. The pinball adaptation is based on &quot;Fallout 4&quot; while containing elements from previous installments as well.

==== &quot;Fallout 76&quot; (2018) ====

&quot;Fallout 76&quot; is the first online multiplayer game in the franchise. It is set in West Virginia, with a majority of monsters and enemies based on regional folklore. When the game was originally released, there were no human non-player characters, although it received NPCs and character dialogue with the &quot;Wastelanders&quot; update. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on November 14, 2018.

==== &quot;Fallout Shelter Online&quot; (2019) ====
&quot;Fallout Shelter Online&quot; is a sequel to &quot;Fallout Shelter&quot; developed by Chinese company Gaea Mobile. It expands on the original games&#x27; mechanics while also introducing multiplayer capabilities such as PvP and the ability to play online, as well as gacha mechanics. It was released in June 2019 exclusively in China. On March 18, 2020, pre-registration for Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea, and Japan was opened. On June 1, 2020, it was released in the former territories on iOS and Android devices.

=== Tabletop games ===
==== &quot;Fallout: Warfare&quot; (2001) ====
&quot;Fallout: Warfare&quot; is a tabletop wargame based on the &quot;Fallout Tactics&quot; storyline, using a simplified version of the SPECIAL system. The rulebook was written by Christopher Taylor, and was available on the &quot;Fallout Tactics&quot; bonus CD, together with cut-out miniatures. &quot;Fallout: Warfare&quot; features five distinct factions, vehicles, four game types and 33 different units. The rules only require ten-sided dice. The modifications to the SPECIAL system allow every unit a unique set of stats and give special units certain skills they can use, including piloting, doctor, and repair. A section of the &quot;Fallout: Warfare&quot; manual allows campaigns to be conducted using the &quot;Warfare&quot; rules. It has been chosen for many awards and won game of the year.

==== &quot;Fallout: The Board Game&quot; (2017) ====

&quot;Fallout: The Board Game&quot; was announced by Fantasy Flight Games on August 8, 2017. In &quot;Fallout: The Board Game&quot;, up to one to four players are able to explore the locations of &quot;Fallout 3&quot;, &quot;Fallout 4&quot; and their associated downloadable content. Pre-orders were opened on October 2, 2017. It was released and made available to purchase online and at retailers on November 30, 2017.

An expansion titled &quot;Fallout: New California&quot; was announced on July 13, 2018, which explores the area of New California featured in &quot;Fallout&quot; and &quot;Fallout 2&quot;. Pre-orders were opened on October 2, 2017. It was released and made available to purchase online and at retailers on October 25, 2018.

==== &quot;Fallout: Wasteland Warfare&quot; (2018) ====
The tabletop wargame &quot;Fallout: Wasteland Warfare&quot; was announced by Modiphius Entertainment in April 2017. It was released in March 2018.

A virtual tabletop version was released on Fantasy Grounds April 26, 2022.

==== &quot;Fallout: The Roleplaying Game&quot; (2021) ====
The tabletop role-playing game &quot;Fallout: The Roleplaying Game&quot;, also by Modiphius Entertainment, was released digitally on March 31, 2021. The game features a modified version of the SPECIAL system, including the seven SPECIAL stats, skills, tag skills, and perks. Its core mechanic is Modiphius&#x27;s &quot;2d20&quot; system, a dice pool system in which any given action is resolved by rolling two twenty-sided dice and counting the number of &quot;successes&quot;, which are any result equal to or below the character&#x27;s combined SPECIAL attribute plus their skill rank for a particular action. Players can roll additional dice by spending &quot;Action Points&quot;, a resource shared by all active players in the game, which are generated and spent continuously over the course of a game session.

The game&#x27;s default setting is the Commonwealth, the same as in &quot;Fallout 4&quot;, at the same period in time. Flavor text throughout the rulebook describe characters featured in &quot;Fallout 4&quot; and suggest that events are set to occur the same way they are at the beginning of the videogame, such as the arrival of the &quot;Prydwen&quot; airship. The rulebook contains descriptions of locations, fictional corporations, factions, and events specific to the default greater Boston area. Support for regions that appeared in other Fallout videogames, such as New California, Midwest, Capital Wasteland, Mojave Wasteland or the Appalachia, were not included in the core rulebook.

On May 13, 2020, a supplement-sized questbook expansion titled &quot;Winter of Atom&quot; was announced. The expansion is set within the Commonwealth before the events of &quot;Fallout 4&quot; during a harsh winter, with the conflict involving defending settlements against the Last Son of Atom, the leader of a rogue sect of the Children of Atom. Four new factions are also introduced, as well as additional player character origins for Synth, Protectron and Child of Atom players. Physical pre-orders for &quot;Winter of Atom&quot; were opened in May 2023, which included a digital copy in PDF form upon purchasing. Physical copies were slated to ship in July 2023.

====&quot;Magic: The Gathering: Fallout&quot; (2024)====
A set of four pre-constructed decks for &quot;&quot; based on all previous &quot;Fallout&quot; video games was released by Wizards of the Coast under license from Bethesda on March 8, 2024, as part of the &quot;Universes Beyond&quot; program of cross-over Magic products. These decks were designed for the Commander format of multiplayer Magic and represent different factions: Survivors, Legions, Scientists, and Mutants. The set contains a total of 146 new cards, representing characters, equipment, vaults, and other elements of the Fallout games, along with reprints of older cards all with new art depicting the post-apocalyptic setting.

====&quot;Fallout Factions&quot; (2024)====
The tabletop skirmishing wargame, &quot;Fallout Factions&quot;, was announced by Modiphius Entertainment on September 10, 2022, during their online event, ModCon 2022. The game&#x27;s first release, &quot;Fallout Factions: Nuka World&quot;, is played using miniatures of three Raider gangs: the Operators, the Pack, and the Disciples, which were originally introduced in &quot;Fallout 4&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Nuka-World&quot; add-on. The game&#x27;s miniatures were also announced to be compatible with &quot;Fallout: Wasteland Warfare&quot;. On September 15, 2023, it was announced via newsletter that the game would be released in 2024.

=== Cancelled games ===
==== &quot;Fallout Extreme&quot; ====
&quot;Fallout Extreme&quot; was in development for several months in 2000 but was canceled before leaving the concept stage. It was intended to be a squad-based, first and third-person tactical shooter to be released on Xbox and built on Unreal Engine.

==== &quot;Fallout Tactics 2&quot; ====
&quot;Fallout Tactics 2&quot; was proposed as a sequel to &quot;Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel&quot;, although it was originally conceived as a sequel to &quot;Wasteland&quot;, the video game that inspired the &quot;Fallout&quot; series. It was developed by Micro Forté, but the production was canceled in December 2001 after the poor sales of &quot;Fallout Tactics&quot;.

====&quot;Van Buren&quot;, Black Isle Studios&#x27; &quot;Fallout 3&quot;====

&quot;Van Buren&quot; is the codename for the canceled version of &quot;Fallout 3&quot; developed by Black Isle Studios and to be published by Interplay Entertainment. It featured an improved engine with 3D graphics as opposed to sprites, new locations, vehicles, and a modified version of the SPECIAL system. The story disconnected from the Vault Dweller/Chosen One bloodline in &quot;Fallout&quot; and &quot;Fallout 2&quot;. Plans for the game included the ability to influence the various factions. The game was canceled in December 2003 when budget cuts forced Interplay to dismiss the PC development team. Interplay subsequently sold the &quot;Fallout&quot; intellectual property to Bethesda Softworks, who began development on their own version of &quot;Fallout 3&quot; unrelated to &quot;Van Buren&quot;. Main parts of the game were incorporated into &quot;Fallout 3&quot; and its add-ons as well as &quot;Fallout: New Vegas&quot;.

==== &quot;Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel 2&quot; ====
&quot;Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel 2&quot; is the canceled sequel to &quot;Brotherhood of Steel&quot;. The development of the game started before the completion of the original, and its development caused the cancellation of the &quot;Van Buren&quot; project. Like its predecessor, the game would have used the Dark Alliance Engine. It featured fourteen new weapons and ten new enemies. The game would have used a simplified reputation system based on previous entries; depending on whether the player was good or evil, the game would play out differently. Each of the four characters that were playable had a different fighting style, therefore every new play-through would have been a different experience. It had two player co-op action for players to experience the game with their friends. The Dark Alliance Engine would be fleshed out to refine player experience. A new stealth system would have been added to the game. This system would have allowed players to stalk enemies or stealthily assassinate them with a sniper rifle. For characters that could not use the sniper rifle, Interplay added a turret mode allowing those characters to use turrets.

While the main quest of the game would have been linear, how the player reach the conclusion would have been their choice. The main character would have been a Latino girl named Lilith, who was said to have a short temper with short black hair, green eyes and a sexy body. She would have worn a sports bra and jeans. Three other characters would be Maxus, the son of Cyrus, and Jaffe, a Brotherhood R&amp;D worker who was pulled from duty due to Brotherhood/NCR tensions. Scarlet is a character that is completely albino, was raised by Harold, and inspired by the stories of Dweller, the main character of the original &quot;Fallout&quot;.

==== &quot;Fallout Online&quot; ====
&quot;Fallout Online&quot; (previously known as &quot;Project V13&quot;) is a canceled project by Interplay and Masthead Studios to develop a &quot;Fallout&quot;-themed massively multiplayer online game. It entered production in 2008. In 2009, Bethesda filed a lawsuit against Interplay regarding &quot;Project V13,&quot; claiming that Interplay has violated their agreement as development had not yet begun on the project. On January 2, 2012, Bethesda and Interplay reached a settlement, the terms of which include the cancellation of &quot;Fallout Online&quot; and transfer of all rights in the franchise to Bethesda. Since then, &quot;Project V13&quot; has been revived as a completely different project called Mayan Apocalypse, unrelated to &quot;Fallout&quot;.

== Gameplay ==
=== SPECIAL ===

SPECIAL is a character creation and statistics system developed for use in the &quot;Fallout&quot; series. &quot;SPECIAL&quot; is an acronym, representing the seven attributes used to define characters&#x27;: Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck. SPECIAL is heavily based on GURPS, which was originally intended to be the character system used in the game.

The SPECIAL system involves the following sets of key features:

* Attributes (listed above) represent a character&#x27;s core, innate abilities. Attributes stay largely constant throughout the game, though they can be temporarily affected by drugs, altered indefinitely by conditions such as the usage of Power Armor, the presence of certain NPCs, eye damage received from a critical hit, or permanently changed at certain points in the game through use of certain items or perks.
* Skills represent a character&#x27;s chance of successfully performing a group of specific tasks (such as firing a gun, or picking a lock). They are represented as percentages, though these percentages can extend well beyond the expected maximum of 100%, at increased cost for skills over 100%. The SPECIAL stats continually add bonuses to skills. This is done passively, i.e. if the SPECIAL stats change, the bonuses are automatically and instantly adjusted. Skill Points that are earned each time the character levels up can be used to raise skill percentage. At character creation, the player selects three &quot;tag skills&quot;—skills which can be increased at multiples of the normal rate, starting at one skill point per 2% skill at under 101% skill.

The SPECIAL system was used in &quot;Fallout&quot;, &quot;Fallout 2&quot;, and &quot;Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel&quot;. A modified version of the system was used in &quot;Fallout 3&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Fallout 4&quot;, &quot;Fallout 76&quot; and &quot;Fallout Shelter&quot;.

Aside from &quot;Fallout&quot; games, modified versions of SPECIAL were also used in &quot;&quot; (also referred to as &quot;Fallout Fantasy&quot; early in production), a fantasy role-playing video game that involved spirits and magic in addition to the traditional SPECIAL features, as well as the canceled project &quot;Black Isle&#x27;s Torn&quot;.

=== The Pip-Boy and Vault Boy ===
The Pip-Boy (Personal Information Processor-Boy) is a wrist-computer given to the player early in &quot;Fallout&quot;, &quot;Fallout 2&quot;, &quot;Fallout 3&quot;, &quot;Fallout: New Vegas&quot;, &quot;Fallout 4&quot;, and &quot;Fallout 76&quot; which serves various roles in quest, inventory, and battle management, as well as presenting player statistics. The model present in &quot;Fallout&quot; and &quot;Fallout 2&quot; is identified as a Pip-Boy 2000, and both games feature the same unit, used first by the Vault Dweller and later inherited by the Chosen One. &quot;Fallout Tactics&quot; contains a modified version of the 2000 model, called Pip-Boy 2000BE, while &quot;Fallout 3&quot; and &quot;Fallout: New Vegas&quot; uses a Pip-Boy 3000. &quot;Fallout: New Vegas&quot; has a golden version of it, called the Pimp-Boy 3 Billion that is given to the player as a reward for completing a quest in a certain way. &quot;Fallout 4&quot; contains a modified version of the 3000, called the Pip-Boy 3000 Mark IV. &quot;Fallout 76&quot; contains a modified version of the Pip-Boy, called the Pip-Boy 2000 Mark VI, which is another version of the Pip-Boy 2000.

The Vault Boy character is Vault-Tec&#x27;s mascot, and is a recurring element in Vault-Tec products in the game world. This includes the Pip-Boy, where the Vault Boy illustrates all of the character statistics and selectable attributes. From Bethesda&#x27;s &quot;Fallout 3&quot; onward Vault Boy models all of the clothing and weaponry as well. The character was originally designed by Leonard Boyarsky, based partly on Rich Uncle Pennybags&#x27; aesthetic from the &quot;Monopoly&quot; board game.

=== Power armor ===

Powered combat infantry armor, or power armor, is a type of powered exoskeleton featured in every game in the &quot;Fallout&quot; series. It allows for protection from enemy fire and enables the wearer to carry extremely heavy weapons and other objects with ease. It is considered an iconic part of the &quot;Fallout&quot; universe, an effective marketing tool for a faceless protagonist, and a prominent symbol within the game&#x27;s lore.

The final design of the power armor in the original &quot;Fallout&quot; was created by artist Leonard Boyarsky from a helmet rendering made to showcase &quot;something more detailed to show (on) the cover and in the cinematics&quot; of the game. The design of the helmet and eyepiece was stated by Cain to be partly inspired by the film &quot;The City of Lost Children&quot;, with its &quot;tubing and vents&quot; serving as &quot;very inspirational&quot; to the overall aesthetic of the game. Leonard Boyarsky stated that he was inspired by the &quot;very industrial...very hardcore mechanical&quot; design of the helmet and &quot;loved it so much&quot; that he revised the initial in-game design of the power armor to reflect the concept art that he had made.

The power armor&#x27;s recurring appearances in subsequent titles following the acquisition of the &quot;Fallout&quot; intellectual property by Bethesda Softworks represents a crucial visual motif used to establish continuity with earlier works in the franchise. Lead art director Istvan Pely stated that the power armor was the first asset developed for &quot;Fallout 3&quot; because the &quot;iconic element of the series...seemed like a great place to start&quot; and was a &quot;useful exercise in finding a balance between staying true to the original game&#x27;s vibe and introducing a fresh aesthetic for the new game&quot;.

In &quot;Fallout: New Vegas&quot;, power armor is depicted as an equippable form of clothing, similar to other armors, without any unique animations. &quot;PCGamesN&quot; reported that some noteworthy fan-created mods introduced aesthetic changes to the game&#x27;s power armor design to make it seem more imposing and added animations to reflect their weight and heft. Evan Lafleuriel observed that &quot;New Vegas&quot; is the only game in the series to eschew the use of power armor to advertise the game, which did not leave a lasting impression in his view.

In &quot;Fallout 4&quot;, power armor is notably more heavily integrated into gameplay, with suits becoming customizable, interactable objects in the game world that the player climbs into rather than typical clothing and requiring fusion cores to use. The studio initially began a &quot;reimagining&quot; of the classic design during the development of &quot;Fallout 4&quot; but created a new and revised design that was &quot;bigger, more imposing, more realistic and fully functional&quot; to create the impression of the power armor feeling less like a suit and more like a vehicle that a player would operate, which resonated with some commentators of &quot;Fallout 4&quot;. In addition, players are capable of creating collections of power armor in concert with the game&#x27;s base-building features.

====Lore====
Within series lore, it was developed before the Great War by a group of United States defense contractors called West Tek in response for the need for a &quot;walking tank&quot; for the United States mechanized cavalry. From 2065 to 2067, several failed prototypes were created, though this research led to the creation of a compact fusion cell. The fusion cells worsened relations with China, which was already facing an energy crisis due to over-dependence on fossil fuels. China soon invades Alaska, and the Power Armor is deployed in 2067, proving extremely effective in battle. 2077 represents the pinnacle of Power Armor technology, with units capable of cutting a swath through the Chinese forces. Their success on the battlefield ultimately prompts the Great War, a last-ditch nuclear exchange between America and China later in 2077 that annihilates most of modern civilization, save for irradiated ghouls and those sheltering in the Vault Network.

The 2019 publication &quot;Fallout: A Tale of Mutation&quot; explained that within the context of series lore, the Power Armor represents pre-war North American power, since every battle against the Chinese was fought by soldiers wearing the armor. Additionally, it is a reminder of how powerless the United States was to prevent its destruction at the hands of nuclear weapons.

Post-war, Power Armor is most widely used by the Brotherhood of Steel, a cult-like organization that collects and preserves technology.

====Merchandise====
A Power Armor figurine made by Japanese toymaker ThreeZero was released in 2016 for nearly $400 (~$ in ). A $200 version of &quot;Fallout 76&quot; known as the Power Armor Edition was bundled with a replica Power Armor helmet. While its appearance was praised as &quot;top notch&quot;, aspects such as the paint job and voice box were criticized as &quot;cheap&quot;, and the visor as difficult to see through. While not part of the Power Armor Edition, red &quot;Nuka-Cola&quot; helmets sold at GameStop were recalled due to mold contamination, said to be part of a &quot;comedy of errors&quot; surrounding the game&#x27;s release.

== Series overview ==
=== Setting ===
The series is set in a fictionalized United States in an alternate history scenario that diverges from reality after 1945, following World War II. In this alternative atompunk &quot;golden age&quot;, vacuum tubes and atomic physics serve as the foundations of scientific progress, while transistors are not as scientifically important in this world. As such, a bizarre socio-technological status quo emerges, in which advanced robots, nuclear-powered cars, directed-energy weapons, and other futuristic technologies are seen alongside 1950s-era computers and televisions. The United States divides itself into 13 commonwealths and the aesthetics and Cold War paranoia of the 1950s continue to dominate the American lifestyle well into the 21st century.

More than a hundred years before the start of the series, an energy crisis emerged as a result of oil depletion, leading to a period called the &quot;Resource Wars&quot; starting in April 2052 – a series of events caused by global resource scarcity which included a war between the European Commonwealth and the Middle Eastern states which led to the collapse of both regions, the disbanding of the United Nations, the U.S. invasion of Mexico and hostile annexation of Canada, and a Chinese invasion and subsequent military occupation of Alaska in 2066 leading to the decade-long &quot;Sino-American War&quot; between China and the U.S. coupled with the emergence of a disease known as the &quot;New Plague&quot; that devastated the American mainland. As global situations worsened, the American government became increasingly jingoistic and authoritarian, going as far as having political dissidents and Chinese-American citizens arrested and sent off to re-education camps where they were abused and even experimented on. By 2077 the tension between the United States and China had grown to critical levels as the U.S. retook Alaska and invaded mainland China, eventually culminating in the &quot;Great War&quot; on the morning of October 23, 2077, eastern daylight time, a two-hour long global nuclear exchange on an apocalyptic scale, which subsequently created the post-apocalyptic United States, the setting of the &quot;Fallout&quot; world.

=== Vaults ===

Having foreseen this outcome decades earlier, the U.S. government began a nationwide project in 2054 to build fallout shelters known as &quot;Vaults&quot;. The Vaults were ostensibly designed by the Vault-Tec Corporation as public shelters, each able to support up to a thousand people. Around 400,000 Vaults would have been needed, but only 122 were commissioned and constructed. Each Vault is self-sufficient, so they could theoretically sustain their inhabitants indefinitely. However, the Vault project was not intended as a viable method of repopulating the United States in these deadly events. Instead, most Vaults were secret, unethical social experiments and were designed to determine the effects of different environmental and psychological conditions on their inhabitants. Seventeen control Vaults were made to function as advertised, in contrast with the Vault experiments, but were usually shoddy and unreliable due to most of the funding going towards the experimental ones. Many Vaults remained sealed as part of their respective experiments even after the radiation had reached safe levels.

Experiments were widely varied and included: a Vault filled with clones of an individual; a Vault where its residents were frozen in suspended animation; a Vault where its residents were exposed to psychoactive drugs; a Vault where they are instructed sacrifice one inhabitant each year; a Vault with only one man and puppets; a Vault where its inhabitants were segregated into two hostile factions; two Vaults with disproportionate ratios of men and women; a Vault where the door never fully closed, exposing the inhabitants to the dangerous nuclear fallout; a Vault with limited space where all its dwellers had access to firearms; a deliberately overcrowded Vault and a number of Vaults where the inhabitants were exposed to the mutagenic Forced Evolutionary Virus (F.E.V.), creating posthuman and human/animal hybrid mutants including the monstrous &quot;Super Mutants&quot;. Ultimately, many of the experiments had disastrous results usually leading to their derailment and the Vault&#x27;s collapse. Several Vaults became occupied by raiders, Super Mutants, or other mutated creatures following their abandonment.

=== Postwar conditions ===

In the years after the Great War, the United States has devolved into a post-apocalyptic environment commonly dubbed &quot;the Wasteland&quot;. The Great War and subsequent nuclear Armageddon had severely depopulated the country, leaving large expanses of property decaying from neglect. In addition, virtually all food and water is irradiated and most lifeforms have mutated due to high radiation combined with mutagens of varied origins. Despite the large-scale devastation, some areas were fortunate enough to survive the nuclear apocalypse relatively unscathed, even possessing non-irradiated water, flora, and fauna. However, these areas are exceedingly rare. With a large portion of the country&#x27;s infrastructure in ruins, basic necessities are scarce. Barter is the common method of exchange, with bottle caps providing a more conventional form of currency. Most cities and towns are empty, having been looted or deserted in favor of smaller, makeshift communities scattered around the Wasteland.

Many humans who could not get into the Vaults survived the atomic blasts, but many of these, affected by the radiation, turned into so-called &quot;ghouls&quot;. While their lifespans are greatly extended, their bodies develop widespread necrosis or rot; many lose their hair, their voices take on a raspy tone, and otherwise have permanently deformed physical features. Ghouls often resent normal human beings, either out of jealousy or in response to discrimination. Ghouls typically resent any comparison to zombies, and being called a zombie is viewed as a great insult. If ghouls continue to be exposed to high radiation levels, their brains experience irreversible damage, which can cause them to become &quot;feral&quot; and attack almost anything on sight, having lost their minds.

Creatures known as &quot;Deathclaws&quot; roam the wilderness. They were deliberately created by humans as biological weapons prior to the Great War. Escaping into the wild afterwards, they went on to thrive in the nuclear wasteland, becoming apex predators. Known as one of the &quot;Fallout&quot; series&#x27; most recognizable and iconic elements, Deathclaws were praised by critics for their design and the fear they induce in the player due to their immense power. As a result of their popularity, numerous mods were created for &quot;Fallout&quot; series games with the Deathclaw as a central theme, either to tame the creatures as a pet or use them in combat, concepts which were later added as an official feature.

Various factions of humans would later form in the Wasteland, with three of the most prominent being the Brotherhood of Steel, the New California Republic (NCR), and the Enclave. The Brotherhood came together when a group of soldiers led by U.S. Army Captain Roger Maxson started a mutiny after finding out about the Forced Evolutionary Virus experiments. Declaring themselves independent from the U.S. government, their rebellion never got off the ground due to the Great War beginning. The defectors, safe in the underground confines of the base, survived and came to the surface and reconnected with other survivors, then headed to the Lost Hills bunker to start anew. The NCR was formed by a group of Vault 15 dwellers who would go on to found the town of Shady Sands. Over time under the leadership of their elder Aradesh and his daughter Tandi, Shady Sands became a major economic power in the southwest and united with other major hubs of civilization in the area to found the New California Republic. The Enclave was a secret cabal of wealthy industrialists, members of the military, and influential politicians who operated in the shadows and held a great degree of control over the United States&#x27; government. This enigmatic alliance of private interests eventually subverted and developed from the continuity of government protocol to ensure its survival as the real United States, laying claim to the North American mainland.

=== Influences ===
&quot;Fallout&quot; satirizes the 1950s&#x27; and 1960s&#x27; fantasies of the United States&#x27; &quot;post-nuclear-war-survival&quot;, thus draws from 1950s pulp magazine science fiction and superhero comic books, all rooted in Atomic Age optimism of a nuclear-powered future, though gone terribly awry by the time the events of the game take place. The technology is retro-futuristic, with various Raygun Gothic machines such as laser weaponry and boxy &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;-style robots. Computers use vacuum tubes instead of transistors (of which only a few exist), the architecture of ruined buildings feature Art Deco, Streamline Moderne, and Googie designs, direct-energy weapons resemble those used by Flash Gordon, and what few vehicles remain in the world are all 1950s-styled. &quot;Fallout&quot;″s other production designs, such as menu interfaces, are similarly designed to resemble advertisements and toys of the Atomic Age. Advertising in the game such as billboards and brochures has a distinct 1950s motif and feel. The lack of retro-stylization was a common reason for criticism in spin-off games, as well as modern features on weapons and other models.

A major influence was &quot;A Boy and His Dog&quot;, where the main character Vic and his dog Blood scavenge the desert of the Southwestern United States, stealing for a living and evading bands of marauders, berserk androids, and mutants. It &quot;inspired &quot;Fallout&quot; on many levels, from underground communities of survivors to glowing mutants.&quot; Other film influences include the &quot;Mad Max&quot; series, with its depiction of a post-apocalyptic wasteland. In the first game, one of the first available armors is a one-sleeved leather jacket that resembles the jacket worn in &quot;Mad Max 2&quot;.

==Other media==
===Canceled films===
In 1998, Interplay Entertainment founded the film division Interplay Films to make films based on its properties, and announced that a &quot;Fallout&quot; film was one of their first projects, along adaptations of &quot;Descent&quot; and &quot;Redneck Rampage&quot;. In 2000, Interplay confirmed that a film based on the original &quot;Fallout&quot; game was in production with &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot; screenwriter Brent V. Friedman attached to write a film treatment and with Dark Horse Entertainment attached to produce it. The division was later disbanded without any film produced, but Friedman&#x27;s treatment was leaked on the Internet in 2011.

In 2009, Bethesda Softworks expressed its interest in producing a &quot;Fallout&quot; film. After four extensions of the trademark without any use, Bethesda filed a &quot;Statement of Use&quot; with the USPTO in January 2012. In the next month, instead of a &quot;Fallout&quot; film, a special feature was made, entitled &quot;Making of &quot;Fallout 3&quot; DVD&quot;, which was accepted as a film on March 27 of the same year. This action removed the requirement to continue to re-register that mark indefinitely. In the DVD commentary of &quot;Mutant Chronicles&quot;, voice actor Ron Perlman stated that if a &quot;Fallout&quot; film was made, he would like to reprise his role as the Narrator. In 2016, Todd Howard stated that Bethesda had turned down the offers of making a film based on &quot;Fallout&quot;, but that he did not rule out the possibility.

===Television series===

A &quot;Fallout&quot; television series based on the franchise was announced in July 2020 for Amazon Prime Video. The series was written, created and executive produced by Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan. In January 2022, Amazon officially moved forward with the series, with Nolan directing the pilot episode and Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner joining as showrunners. Filming was completed on March 28, 2023. The show is canonical to the games, with its 2296 setting, making it the furthest along the timeline in the franchise. Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins were cast in lead roles as an inexperienced vault dweller venturing to the surface and a ghoul mercenary, respectively. The series premiered its first season, consisting of eight episodes, on April 10, 2024, and was renewed for a second season later that month.

===The Vault Dweller&#x27;s Official Cookbook===
The Vault Dweller&#x27;s Official Cookbook contains recipes for food items found within the Fallout universe, such as Nuka-Cola, BlamCo Mac N&#x27; Cheese, and various others. It was written by Laurie Ulster and Victoria Rosenthal, and was published on October 23, 2018, to coincide with the release of Fallout 76, and the in-game date of the Great War.

===&quot;Fortnite: Battle Royale&quot;===
The T-60 Power Armor appeared in Fortnite, in the &quot;Battle Royale&quot; gamemode, as a cosmetic outfit in the Chapter 5 Season 3 Battle Pass, alongside a pickaxe tool attaining to the Assaultron, an emote depicting a Mister Handy robot, and many other cosmetic items bearing reference to the series. Nuka Cola also appeared as a consumable, as did the laser rifle as an in-game weapon, in a later update.

===&quot;Super Smash Bros Ultimate&quot;===
During the summer of 2020, the mascot of Vault-Tec, Vault Boy, appeared as a Mii Gunner costume for the Nintendo Switch title &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;.

===&quot;Call of Duty&quot;===
On June 18, 2024, Activision announced a collaboration between the &quot;Call of Duty&quot; franchise and &quot;Fallout&quot;, which saw the addition of a cosmetic bundle for purchase in &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III&quot; and &quot;Call of Duty: Warzone&quot;. The bundle contains &quot;Vault 141&quot; outfits for four operator characters Soap, Price, Ghost, and Gaz, in addition to Vault-themed weapon skins and other items based on &quot;Fallout&quot;. The bundle was released on June 20, 2024, in addition to a free in-game event where players can earn other &quot;Fallout&quot;-themed cosmetic items, including a Nuka-Cola Quantum weapon camouflage.

== Reception and legacy ==
The &quot;Fallout&quot; series has been met with mostly positive reception. The highest rated title is &quot;Fallout 3&quot; and the lowest is &quot;Fallout 76&quot; according to review aggregator Metacritic.

=== Controversy and fandom ===
Some fans have expressed dismay at the direction the &quot;Fallout&quot; series has taken since its acquisition by Bethesda Softworks. Notorious for their vehement support of the series&#x27; first two games, &quot;Fallout&quot; and &quot;Fallout 2&quot;, members centered around one of the oldest &quot;Fallout&quot; fansites, &quot;No Mutants Allowed&quot;, have complained over departures from the original games&#x27; stories, gameplay mechanics and setting. Minor criticisms include the prevalence of unspoiled food after 200 years, the survival of wood-framed dwellings after a nuclear blast, and the ubiquity of Super Mutants at early levels in the game. More serious criticisms involve the quality of the game&#x27;s writing, lack of verisimilitude, the switch to a first-person action game format, and the reactiveness of the surrounding game world to player actions. In response, James Stephanie Sterling of &quot;Destructoid&quot; has called fan groups like &quot;No Mutants Allowed&quot; &quot;selfish&quot; and &quot;arrogant&quot;; stating that a new audience deserves a chance to play a &quot;Fallout&quot; game; and that if the series had stayed the way it was back in 1997, new titles would never have been made and brought to market. Luke Winkie of &quot;Kotaku&quot; tempers these sentiments, saying that it is a matter of ownership; and that in the case of &quot;Fallout 3&quot;, hardcore fans of the original series witnessed their favorite games become transformed into something else and that they are &quot;not wrong&quot; for having grievances.

The redesigned dialogue interface featured in &quot;Fallout 4&quot; received mixed reception by the community. Unsatisfied fans created mods for the game, providing subtitles and allowing the player to know what their character would say before choosing it as it was in previous games in the franchise such as in &quot;Fallout 3&quot; and &quot;Fallout: New Vegas&quot;. Though even taking the mods into account, Patricia Hernandez of Kotaku still criticized the writing of the game in her review, describing it as &quot;thin&quot;, &quot;You never have particularly long or nuanced conversations with the other characters. I like to play a Charisma-focused character, and I was disappointed.&quot;

Upon release, &quot;Fallout 76&quot; became the lowest rated title. It has been the subject of several controversies since its release. &quot;IGN&quot; gave the game a five out of ten rating, criticizing the game for its lackluster graphics, poor use of multiplayer, and bugs, &quot;Fallout 76 fails to do any of it well enough to form an identity. Its multiplayer mindset robs its quests of all the moral decision making that makes the series great, and all that&#x27;s left is a buggy mess of systemic designs that never seems to work (culminating) in an aggravating endgame that&#x27;s more busywork than satisfying heroics. Bethesda missed the mark with Fallout 76...because it seems it could never decide what it was aiming for.&quot; The magazine, &quot;PC Gamer&quot;, rated the game a six out of ten, praising it for its evocative and beautiful setting, large world, and combat but also criticizing the game for its bugs, poor UI, and repetitiveness, &quot;the world retains a lot of what I love about Bethesda&#x27;s previous RPGs with finely crafted environments, enjoyable weapons and crafting, and surprising little scraps of story to uncover and investigate. Like Valley Galleria, though, it doesn&#x27;t take long to for the shine to fade, the once-fascinating areas to lose their wonder among the mobs of identical enemies I&#x27;ve killed there time and time again.&quot;

== Legal action ==
Interplay was threatened with bankruptcy and sold the full &quot;Fallout&quot; franchise to Bethesda, but kept the rights to the &quot;Fallout&quot; MMO through a back license in April 2007 and began work on the MMO later that year. Bethesda Softworks sued Interplay Entertainment for copyright infringement on September 8, 2009, regarding the &quot;Fallout Online&quot; license and selling of &quot;Fallout Trilogy&quot; and sought an injunction to stop development of &quot;Fallout Online&quot; and sales of &quot;Fallout Trilogy&quot;. Key points that Bethesda were trying to argue is that Interplay did not have the right to sell &quot;Fallout Trilogy&quot; on the Internet via Steam, Good Old Games or other online services. Bethesda also said that &quot;full scale&quot; development on &quot;Fallout Online&quot; was not met and that the minimum financing of 30 million of &quot;secured funding&quot; was not met. Interplay launched a counter suit claiming that Bethesda&#x27;s claims were meritless and that it did have the right to sell &quot;Fallout&quot; Trilogy via online stores via its contract with Bethesda. Interplay also claimed secure funding had been met and the game was in full scale development by the cut off date. Interplay argued to have the second contract that sold &quot;Fallout&quot; voided which would result in the first contract that licensed &quot;Fallout&quot; to come back into effect. This would mean that &quot;Fallout&quot; would revert to Interplay. Bethesda would be allowed to make &quot;Fallout 5&quot;. Bethesda would have to pay 12% of royalties on &quot;Fallout 3&quot;, &quot;Fallout: New Vegas&quot;, &quot;Fallout 4&quot; and expansions plus interest on the money owed. On December 10, 2009, Bethesda lost the first injunction.

Bethesda shortly afterward tried a new tactic and fired its first lawyer, replacing him and filing a second injunction, claiming that Interplay had only back-licensed the name &quot;Fallout&quot; but no content. Interplay has countered showing that the contract states that they must make &quot;Fallout Online&quot; that has the look and feel of &quot;Fallout&quot; and that in the event Interplay fails to meet the requirements (30 million minimum secure funding and &quot;full scale&quot; development by X date) that Interplay can still release the MMO but they have to remove all &quot;Fallout&quot; content. The contract then goes on to list all &quot;Fallout&quot; content as locations, monsters, settings and lore. Bethesda has known that Interplay would use &quot;Fallout&quot; elements via internet emails shown in court documents and that the contract was not just for the name. The second injunction by Bethesda was denied on August 4, 2011, by the courts. Bethesda then appealed the denial of their second preliminary injunction. Bethesda then sued Masthead Studios and asked for a restraining order against the company. Bethesda was denied this restraining order before Masthead Studios could call a counter-suit. Bethesda lost its appeal of the second injunction.

Bethesda filed motion in limine against Interplay. Interplay filed a motion in limine against Bethesda the day after. The trial by jury which Bethesda requested on October 26, 2010, was changed to a trial by court because the APA contract stated that all legal matters would be resolved via a trial by court and not a trial by jury. The trial by court began on December 12. In 2012, in a press conference Bethesda revealed that in exchange for 2 million dollars, Interplay gave to them full rights for &quot;Fallout Online&quot;. Interplay&#x27;s rights to sell and merchandise &quot;Fallout&quot;, &quot;Fallout 2&quot; and &quot;Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel&quot; expired on December 31, 2013.

<text>Charles Connell (1810 – June 28, 1873) was a Canadian politician, now remembered mainly for placing his image on a 5-cent postage stamp. Born in Northampton in the then-British colony of New Brunswick to a family of Loyalists who had fled the American Revolution, he entered politics in 1846, serving in the colony&#x27;s Legislative Assembly and House of Assembly.

== Career ==
In 1858, Connell was appointed Postmaster General of the colony, at a time when increasing trade with the United States was forcing the British colonies to reconsider their currencies and institute a decimal system that would be more familiar to their American neighbors. New Brunswick adopted a decimal currency in 1859, and in the following year, Connell issued the first series of postage stamps in the new denomination. While few people had problems with the new currency, they were outraged that Connell chose to depict himself on the 5-cent stamp. In an effort to stem the criticism and charges of extreme arrogance, he offered to buy up all the stamps and burned them publicly on the front lawn of his house. He also resigned his office as postmaster general. It is unknown how many stamps survived, but they number no more than a few dozen and are now extremely rare. Some counterfeits of the stamp exist also.

Despite the episode, Connell continued to serve in the colonial legislature up until 1867. He strongly urged passage of a bill that would have seen the lieutenant governor of N.B. elected, and not appointed by the British monarch. A member of the Executive Council of New Brunswick, he served as Surveyor General from July 10, 1866, to July 17, 1867.

An ardent supporter of Canadian Confederation, Connell was elected as a Member of Parliament representing the New Brunswick electoral district of Carleton in the first two Canadian parliaments.

From 1865 to 1866, he published his own newspaper, &quot;The Union&quot;.

== Family life ==
On August 5, 1835, he married Anne Fisher, daughter of Peter Fisher, and sister of Lewis P. Fisher. They had seven children, one of whom died young. She died on October 5, 1895, and is buried in the Old Methodist Cemetery in Woodstock, New Brunswick. His son George Heber went on to serve in the House of Commons.

== Death and legacy ==
He died at his house on June 28, 1873.

His 1840 house, known as the Charles Connell House is a National Historic Site, located in Woodstock, New Brunswick, and is now a museum run by the Carleton County Historical Society.

<doc id="170551" wikidata="Q3779057" url="?curid=170551" title="William de Braose, 3rd Lord of Bramber">
<text>William de Braose, 3rd Lord of Bramber (fl. 1135–1179) was a 12th-century Marcher lord who secured a foundation for the dominant position later held by the Braose family in the Welsh Marches. In addition to the family&#x27;s English holdings in Sussex and Devon, William had inherited Radnor and Builth, in Wales, from his father Philip. By his marriage he increased the Braose Welsh holdings to include Brecon and Abergavenny.

William remained loyal to King Stephen during the 12th-century period of civil war. He became a trusted royal servant during the subsequent reign of Henry II, accompanying the king on campaigns in France and Ireland. He served as sheriff of Herefordshire from 1173 until 1175. The family&#x27;s power reached its peak under his son William during the reigns of kings Richard I and John.

== Lands and family ==
William was the eldest son of Philip de Braose, lord of Bramber. His mother was Aenor, daughter of Juhel of Totnes. He was the third in the line of the Anglo-Norman Braose family founded by his grandfather, the first William de Braose. After his father died in the 1130s William inherited lordships, land and castles in Sussex, with his &quot;caput&quot; at Bramber. He also held Totnes in Devon, and Radnor and Builth in the Welsh Marches. He confirmed the grants of his father and grandfather to the abbey of St Florent in Anjou and made further grants to the abbey&#x27;s dependent priory at Sele in Sussex. In about 1155, he also inherited through his mother&#x27;s family one half of the honour of Barnstaple in Devon, paying a fee of 1,000 marks for the privilege. William became an internationally recognised figure. When Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury was asked by Pope Adrian IV to inquire into the background of a certain Walter, canon of St Ruf, his reply, dated 1154/9 read:

William had married Bertha, daughter of Miles of Gloucester and Sibyl de Neufmarché, by 1150. When each of Bertha&#x27;s four brothers (Walter de Hereford, Henry FitzMiles (or Henry de Hereford), Mahel de Hereford and William de Hereford) died leaving no issue, William&#x27;s marriage became unexpectedly valuable. He gained control of the lordships of Brecon and Abergavenny after 1166 when the last brother died. These additional land holdings greatly expanded the territorial power and income of the Braose family. They now held a vast block of territory in the Welsh Marches as well as their extensive interests in Sussex and Devon. William&#x27;s daughters were able to make good marriages, notably Sibyl to William de Ferrers, Earl of Derby. Maud was married to John de Brompton of Shropshire. William&#x27;s son and heir, another William de Braose, became a major player in national politics under King John.

== Royal service ==
Empress Maud, the only legitimate living child of Henry I, landed in England in 1139 in an attempt to press her claim to the monarchy. She was soon besieged by King Stephen&#x27;s forces at Arundel Castle. Stephen allowed Maud safe conduct to Bristol and provided her with an escort, which included William de Braose, suggesting that he was an adherent of King Stephen. William was present as a witness when three charters were issued by Stephen at Lewes dated to the years 1148–53, therefore, it appears that he remained loyal to the king until the Treaty of Wallingford ended the hostilities.
William was in Sussex in 1153, but he followed Duke Henry, soon to become King Henry II, to Normandy in 1154. William was frequently with the new king. He was one of the military leaders who supported Henry at Rhuddlan in 1157. He witnessed one of the king&#x27;s charters at Romsey in 1158, and he is recorded at the king&#x27;s court in Wiltshire in 1164 when the Constitutions of Clarendon were enacted. He accompanied the king on an expedition to France, witnessing at Leons in 1161 and Chinon in 1162. William is also documented on the Irish campaign at Dublin in 1171 and Wexford in 1172. William&#x27;s younger brother, Philip, also accompanied the king to Ireland, and remained with the garrison at Wexford. In 1177 Philip was granted the kingdom of Limerick by Henry but failed to take possession after the citizens set fire to the town.

When Henry was facing war with his sons in 1173, William was appointed as sheriff of Herefordshire at Easter. He maintained the king&#x27;s interests in Herefordshire until 1175.

==Later life and death==
King Henry withdrew his favour from the family after William&#x27;s son organised the murder of Seisyll ap Dyfnwal and other Welsh princes at Abergavenny in 1176. There is little subsequent record of William in public life, and it is likely that he retired to his estates in Sussex. William died after 1179 and was succeeded by his son, William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber, who gained the favour of both King Richard I and King John and became a dominant force in the Welsh Marches during their reigns.

<doc id="170557" wikidata="Q3779058" url="?curid=170557" title="William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber">
<text>William de Braose, (or William de Briouze), 4th Lord of Bramber (1144/1153 – 9 August 1211), court favourite of King John of England, at the peak of his power, was also Lord of Gower, Abergavenny, Brecknock, Builth, Radnor, Kington, Limerick, Glamorgan, Skenfrith, Briouze in Normandy, Grosmont and White Castle.

==Lineage==
William was the most notable member of the de Braose dynasty. His steady rise and sudden fall at the hands of King John is often taken as an example of that king&#x27;s arbitrary and capricious behaviour towards his barons.

William was the son of William de Braose, 3rd Lord of Bramber and his wife Bertha of Hereford, also known as Bertha de Pitres (born 1130), daughter of Miles Fitz Walter, Earl of Hereford and his wife, Sibyl, daughter of Bernard de Neufmarché. From his father, he inherited the Rape of Bramber, in Sussex, and through his mother, he inherited a large estate in the Welsh Marches area of modern-day Monmouthshire.

==Abergavenny Massacre ==

In 1175, William de Braose carried out the Abergavenny Massacre, luring three Welsh princes and other Welsh leaders to their deaths. His principal antagonist was a Seisyll ap Dyfnwal, of Castell Arnallt near Llanover in the valley of the River Usk near Abergavenny, whom he blamed for the death of his uncle Henry. 

After having invited the Welsh leaders to a Christmas feast at Abergavenny Castle under the pretence of peace and the start of a new era at the end of the year (a traditional time for settling outstanding differences amongst the Welsh), he had them murdered by his men. This resulted in great hostility against him among the Welsh, who named him the &quot;Ogre of Abergavenny&quot;. 

Gerald of Wales exonerates him and emphasises the religious piety of de Braose and his wife and de Braose generosity to the priories of Abergavenny and Brecon. William de Braose did however reputedly hunt down and kill Seisyll ap Dyfnwal&#x27;s surviving son, Cadwaladr, a boy of seven.

In 1192, William de Braose was made sheriff of Herefordshire, a post he held until 1199. In 1196 he was made Justice Itinerant for Staffordshire. In 1195 he accompanied King Richard I of England to Normandy and in 1199, William de Braose fought beside Richard at Châlus, where the king was mortally wounded. He then supported King John&#x27;s claim to the throne of England, and represented the new king, making various royal grants.

==The disappearance of Arthur I, Duke of Brittany==

In 1203, William de Braose was put in charge of Arthur of Brittany, whom he had personally captured the previous year at the Battle of Mirebeau. William was suspected of involvement in Arthur&#x27;s disappearance and death, although no concrete evidence ever came to light. There is somewhat better evidence that he at least knew the truth of the matter. William was in attendance with John in Normandy at the time of Arthur of Brittany&#x27;s imprisonment and it was alleged that Arthur suffered the same fate as the Welsh princes at William&#x27;s hand, although this has never been proven. Arthur&#x27;s death remains a mystery. After Arthur disappeared, De Braose served in the war of 1204 against King Philip II of France in France.

== Royal favourite ==
He was greatly favoured by King John early in his reign. John granted him all that he might conquer from the Welsh in Radnorshire, gave him lordship over Limerick in Ireland (save for the city itself), possession of Glamorgan castle, and the Lordship of Gower with its several castles.

In early 1200, King John deprived Theobald Walter, 1st Baron Butler of all his offices and lands in Ireland because of his irregularities as sheriff. His lands were not restored until January 1202. A manuscript in the National Library of Ireland points to William as the agent of his restoration:&quot;Grant by William de Braosa (senior), to Theobald Walter (le Botiller) the burgh of Kildelon (Killaloe) ... the cantred of Elykaruel (the baronies of Clonlisk and Ballybritt, County Offaly), Eliogarty, Ormond, Ara and Oioney, etc. 1201.&quot;&quot;Elykaruel&quot; refers to the Gaelic tuath of &quot;Ely O&#x27;Carroll&quot;, which straddled the southern part of County Offaly and the northern part of Tipperary (at Ikerrin). The other cantreds named are probably the modern baronies of Eliogarty, Ormond Upper, Ormond Lower, and Owney and Arra in County Tipperary.

Before 1206 William successfully claimed half of the barony of Totnes from Henry de Nonant, to which family it had been granted after its forfeiture from Juhel de Totnes. 

In 1206, after his service in France, King John gave William de Braose the three great neighbouring trilateral castles of Gwent (Skenfrith Castle, Grosmont Castle and White Castle). These have been interpreted as bribes encouraging silence on the demise of Arthur, seen by many as a rightful heir to the throne occupied by John of England.

At this point, only an earldom separated him from the greatest in England.

== Royal persecution and death in exile==
Soon after this, William de Braose fell out of favour with King John of England. The precise reasons remain obscure. King John cited overdue monies that de Braose owed the Crown from his estates, but the king&#x27;s actions went far beyond what would be necessary to recover the debt. He distrained (seized) de Braose&#x27;s English estates in Sussex and Devon, and sent a force to invade Wales to seize the de Braose domains there. Beyond that, he sought de Braose&#x27;s wife, Maud de St. Valery, who, the story goes, had made no secret of her belief that King John had murdered Arthur of Brittany.

De Braose fled to Ireland, then returned to Wales as King John had him hunted in Ireland. In Wales, William allied himself to the Welsh Prince Llywelyn the Great, and helped him in his rebellion against King John.

In 1210, William de Braose fled Wales disguised as a beggar, to France. His wife and eldest son were captured. William died the following year in August 1211 at Corbeil, France. He was buried in the Abbey of St. Victor in Paris by a fellow exile and vociferous opponent of King John, Stephen Langton, the Archbishop of Canterbury. His hopes to return alive to Wales and for burial in Brecon were to be unfulfilled. William&#x27;s wife, Maud, and eldest son, William, once captured, were allegedly murdered by King John, possibly starved to death while incarcerated at Windsor Castle and Corfe Castle in 1210.

While William had aroused the jealousy of the other barons during his rise, the arbitrary and violent manner of his fall very probably discomfited them and played a role in the Baronial uprisings of the next decade. The historian Sidney Painter, in his biography of King John, called it &quot;the greatest mistake John made during his reign, as the King revealed to his Barons once and for all his capacity for cruelty.&quot;

==The de Braose lineage==
William de Braose&#x27;s eldest son, William, married Maud (Matilda) de Clare (ca. 1184–1213), the daughter of Richard de Clare, 3rd Earl of Hertford. This younger William was captured with his mother and starved to death in 1210. He had fathered four sons, John, Giles, Philip and Walter and although they were also held in prison, they were released in 1218. John, the eldest, was said to have been brought up secretly, in Gower, by a Welsh ally or retainer. On his release, he came under the care of his uncle Giles de Braose. John made a claim to being the rightful heir of the de Braose lands and titles and although the courts did not find for him, his other uncle Reginald de Braose was able to cede by a legal convention the barony of Bramber to him for a fee. This established John&#x27;s branch of the family and positioned it for survival at least or, at best, an opportunity for continued future power and influence.

== Later dynasty ==
The middle son, Giles de Braose, exiled in France until 1213, was Bishop of Hereford from 1200 until his death in 1215. He made peace with King John and agreed terms for regaining de Braose lands in 1215 but had also made alliances with the Welsh leader Llywelyn the Great. He died in 1215 before he could come into the lands.

William&#x27;s third son, Reginald de Braose reacquired his father&#x27;s lands and titles for himself by simply seizing them back by force following the death of Giles. Reginald did not actually come to terms with the Crown until 1217 and the new, young King Henry III of England, after the death of King John. This, in turn, aroused the anger of Llywelyn the Great who had an understanding with Giles de Braose and the seeming duplicity caused the Welsh to attack de Braose lands in Brecon and Abergavenny and Gower. Abergavenny Castle had to be rebuilt as a result. Reginald de Braose died in 1228.

William&#x27;s eldest daughter Matilda/Maud married a prominent Welsh prince, Gruffydd ap Rhys II of Deheubarth. 

Another daughter, Margaret, married Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath in Ireland and himself another powerful Marcher Lord.
[There seems to be some confusion with Matilde about who her father is re Professor Thomas Jones Pierce, M.A., F.S.A., (1905–1964), Aberystwyth. she is the daughter of William Braose and Bertha Hereford, the father of this William].

==Fiction==
The story of the death of Maud de St. Valery and the conflict of her family with John Lackland is covered in several novels, notably &quot;Lady of Hay&quot; by Barbara Erskine. Erskine describes the life of Maud by sending a woman of the 20th century by psychological regression back into the 12th century.

*April 2
**NBC in the US broadcasts a television special in which white British singer Petula Clark appears with black performer Harry Belafonte as her guest. An innocent, affectionate gesture between the two during recording of a song (Clark touches Belafonte on the arm) has prompted an objection from a representative from the show&#x27;s sponsor (Chrysler Corporation) due to the difference in their races, but NBC airs the performance.
**RAI in Italy broadcasts the first episode of the miniseries &quot;La famiglia Benvenuti&quot; (The Benvenuti family), by Alfredo Giannetti, with Enrico Maria Salerno and Valeria Valeri, about the life of the Italian middle class. The show, innovative at this time, is received well by the public and critics alike, and the child actor Giusva Fioravanti (later infamous right-wing terrorist) becomes a star.
*April 4 – Singer James Brown appears on national television in an attempt to calm feelings of anger in the United States following the assassination of Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King Jr.

*May 2 – The Israel Broadcasting Authority commences television broadcasts.
*May 4 – Mary Hopkin performs on the British TV talent show &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot;. Hopkin catches the attention of model Twiggy, who recommends her to Beatle Paul McCartney. McCartney soon signs Hopkin to Apple Records.

*June 2 – The first cricket match to be televised in colour by the BBC in the UK, Surrey v International Cavaliers held at Cheam Cricket Club Ground. The game attracts 8,000 people.
*June 14 – Rosemary Prinz, one of the first big soap opera stars, is written out of &quot;As the World Turns&quot; in a less-than-amicable departure.
*August 20–21 – Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Events are televised live across Europe.
*October 13 – Actress Bea Benaderet of the popular CBS-TV sitcom &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; dies of lung cancer at the age of 62 shortly after the start of the popular program&#x27;s sixth season.

*October 21–25 – Joan Crawford makes a guest appearance for five episodes on the soap opera &quot;The Secret Storm,&quot; filling in for her ailing daughter, Christina. Joan slurs her lines and appears to be intoxicated during the tapings.
*November 17 – &quot;&quot;Heidi&quot; Game&quot;: NBC breaks away from a pro football game to air a TV movie adaptation of &quot;Heidi&quot;, sparking furious protest. After the break away, the Oakland Raiders score two touchdowns to defeat the New York Jets, in the final minute of play.

*December 3 – The 50-minute television special &quot;Elvis&quot; (sponsored by sewing machine manufacturer The Singer Company), taped in June with a live audience in Burbank, California, airs on NBC in the United States marking the comeback of Elvis Presley after 7 years during which the legendary rock and roll musician&#x27;s career has centered on the movie industry. Concluding with the premiere of &quot;If I Can Dream&quot;, it is not only the highest rated television show for the week of broadcast, but the highest rated television special of the year. Its original broadcast is followed by a Brigitte Bardot special. 
*December 24 – Apollo 8 broadcasts to the Earth, relaying a report that there is a Santa Claus and reading a passage from the Book of Genesis.
;Also in 1968

<text>The year 1967 in television involved some significant events. Below is a list of television-related events in 1967.

==Events==
*January 15 
**The inaugural Super Bowl is simulcast on CBS and NBC
**The Rolling Stones appear on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, where, at Sullivan&#x27;s insistence, they perform &quot;Let&#x27;s Spend the Night Together&quot; as &quot;Let&#x27;s Spend Some Time Together.&quot;
*January 29 – The first CBS Playhouse presentation, &quot;The Final War of Olly Winter&quot;, is televised.

*February 25 – Gene Kelly stars in &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;; airing on NBC and produced by Hanna-Barbera, it is the first TV special to combine live action and animation.
*March – &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; is renewed by CBS for the fall 1967 season. Aging (it was completing its 12th season) and declining in the ratings, CBS planned to cancel the western, but protests from viewers, network affiliates and even members of Congress and especially William S. Paley (Gunsmoke was Paley&#x27;s wife&#x27;s favorite show), the head of the network, lead the network to move the series from its longtime late Saturday time slot to early Mondays for the fall—displacing &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, which initially had been renewed for the fall but is cancelled instead. &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; would remain on CBS until 1975.
*March 6 – &quot;Mark Twain Tonight!&quot; starring Hal Holbrook as Mark Twain, premieres on CBS.
*March 11 – This was the last day that French-language TV stations in Canada were required to run &quot;personals&quot; (classified advertising) between 6–7 p.m. Monday through Saturday.
*May 1 – The United Network (initially known as the Overmyer Network) launches broadcasting with the talk/variety show &quot;The Las Vegas Show&quot;—which would be the only show it airs, as both network and show disappear in June due in part to transmission expenses.
*May 13 – TV Bandeirantes São Paulo, a first network television station of Rede Bandeirantes, an officially regular broadcasting service to start in Brazil.
*May 15 – CBS News and BBC host the &quot;Town Meeting of the World&quot; with governor Ronald Reagan and senator Robert F. Kennedy.
*May – David Dortort appoints himself executive producer of &quot;Bonanza&quot;, a move which takes him out of the day-to-day running of the show but allows him to spend his efforts on another NBC western, &quot;The High Chaparral&quot;.
*June 12 – The fourth &quot;Peanuts&quot; special, &quot;You&#x27;re in Love, Charlie Brown&quot;, with a springtime theme, has its premiere on CBS.
*June 15 – ATV0, Melbourne, launches color television in Australia with live coverage of the Pakenham races.
*June 25 – The special &quot;Our World&quot; becomes the first live worldwide &quot;via satellite&quot; TV broadcast, transmitting to 30 countries. Performers include Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, Keith Richards, Keith Moon, Eric Clapton, Pattie Harrison, Jane Asher, Graham Nash, Hunter Davies, and The Beatles (who perform &quot;All You Need Is Love,&quot; a song composed especially for the occasion).
*July 1 – With live coverage from the Wimbledon Championships of tennis, BBC2 becomes Europe&#x27;s first color TV broadcaster, although still in the experimental stage.

*August 21 – ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; and CBS&#x27;s &quot;As the World Turns&quot; are the first daytime soaps on their respective networks to go color.
*August 25 – Color television is officially launched in West Germany (simultaneously by ARD and ZDF) at precisely 9:30 am, with a symbolic launch button pressed by Willy Brandt at the Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin.
*August 29 – &quot;The Fugitive&quot; finale proves to be one of the most-watched episodes of the decade.
*September 2 – At 12:30 pm, Channel 9 in Sioux City, Iowa switches from being KVTV (CBS basic) to KCAU-TV (ABC full-time). Three days later, CBS returns to the area when KMEG-TV signs-on.
*September 9 – NBC airs what will prove to be the pilot of &quot;Rowan and Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;; which would have its actual series premiere on January 22, 1968.
*September 10 – The Who destroy their instruments during a performance on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;
*September 17 – The Doors appear on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and perform &quot;Light My Fire&quot;. Sullivan had requested that the line &quot;Girl we couldn&#x27;t get much higher&quot; be changed for the show, but Jim Morrison performs it the way it was written and the band is banned from the show as a result.
*October 1 
**First colour television broadcasts introduced in France, RSFSR and BSSR using SECAM system.

<text>Toxicity is the second studio album by the American heavy metal band System of a Down, released on September 4, 2001, by American Recordings and Columbia Records. Expanding on their 1998 eponymous debut album, &quot;Toxicity&quot; incorporates more melody, harmonies, and singing than the band&#x27;s first album. Categorized primarily as alternative metal and nu metal, the album features elements of multiple genres, including folk, progressive rock, jazz, and Armenian and Greek music, including prominent use of instruments like the sitar, banjo, keyboards, and piano. It contains a wide array of political and non-political themes, such as mass incarceration, the CIA, the environment, police brutality, drug addiction, scientific reductionism, and groupies.

&quot;Toxicity&quot; was recorded at Cello Studios in Hollywood, California. Over 30 songs were recorded, but the band narrowed the number of songs on the album to 14. The album peaked at number one on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 220,000 copies in its first week of release. It was certified sextuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in July 2022, signifying at least six million copies sold in the United States. All of &quot;Toxicity&quot; singles reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The final single, &quot;Aerials&quot;, went to number one on both the Mainstream Rock Tracks and the Modern Rock Tracks charts. &quot;Toxicity&quot; received highly positive ratings and reviews from critics, among them perfect ratings from AllMusic, &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, and &quot;Blabbermouth.net&quot;. Many critics praised the album&#x27;s sound and innovation, and it ranked on multiple &quot;best albums&quot; lists.

The promotional shows for &quot;Toxicity&quot; resulted in a number of controversial incidents. A six-hour riot ensued at a free concert in Hollywood the day before the album&#x27;s release as a result of the show&#x27;s cancellation due to an overcrowded show; the crowd in attendance was estimated to be at least twice the size that was expected. Another scheduled System of a Down performance was canceled to prevent a similar riot. The band then toured with Slipknot on the Pledge of Allegiance Tour, and bassist Shavo Odadjian was harassed, racially profiled, and physically beaten by guards when he tried to enter backstage at a concert in October 2001.

==Music, writing, and recording==

Primarily considered an alternative metal and nu metal album, &quot;Toxicity&quot; has also been described as thrash metal, art metal, hard rock, progressive metal, and heavy metal. &quot;Toxicity&quot; features elements of multiple genres of music: folk, progressive rock, jazz, hip hop, Middle Eastern music, and Greek music. Guitarist Daron Malakian said that he &quot;wanted to add a bit more harmony for&quot; himself &quot;in the songs and that required tastefully mixing in some softer guitars between the really heavy parts&quot;. Malakian also cited the Beatles as an influence on &quot;Toxicity&quot;. Sounds of instruments other than drums, vocals, electric guitar and bass guitar, such as sitar, banjo, keyboards and piano, are also featured on &quot;Toxicity&quot;. The majority of the album&#x27;s music was written in the tuning of drop C.

System of a Down recorded over thirty songs during the recording of &quot;Toxicity&quot; but narrowed the number of songs on the album to fourteen. Several of these recorded songs that didn&#x27;t make it onto &quot;Toxicity&quot; were re-recorded for System of a Down&#x27;s next studio album &quot;Steal This Album!&quot;, an album released in 2002. &quot;Toxicity&quot; was recorded at Cello Studios in Hollywood, California, mixed at Enterprise Studios in Burbank, California, and mastered at Oasis Mastering in Studio City, California. According to bassist Shavo Odadjian, the song &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; is &quot;about drug addiction, but [System of a Down took] something really serious and made it a little quacky&quot;. Vocalist Serj Tankian compared the song to Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot;. &quot;Prison Song&quot; is about mass incarceration. Serj Tankian said: &quot;It&#x27;s about the unfairness of mandatory minimum sentences and how there are about 2,000,000 Americans in jail, and a lot of them are in there for marijuana possession and things of that sort. [...] Instead of rehabilitating men who have drug problems, they&#x27;re throwing them in prison. That&#x27;s not really solving anything.&quot; Tankian said that &quot;Prison Song&quot; also addresses &quot;how drug money is used to rig elections in other countries by the CIA&quot;. &quot;Needles&quot; is about &quot;pulling a tapeworm out of your ass.&quot; &quot;Bounce&quot; is about group sex. &quot;Psycho&quot; is about groupies. &quot;ATWA&quot; (an acronym for &quot;Air, Trees, Water, Animals&quot;) is about Charles Manson&#x27;s beliefs on the environment. Malakian has said that &quot;[Manson is] in jail for the wrong reasons. I think he had an unfair trial&quot;. &quot;Deer Dance&quot; is about the protests surrounding the 2000 Democratic National Convention.

==Promotion and touring==
On September 3, 2001, System of a Down had planned on launching &quot;Toxicity&quot; at a free concert in Hollywood, California as a &quot;thank you&quot; to fans. The concert, which was to be held in a parking lot, was set up to accommodate 3,500 people; however, an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 fans showed up. Because of the large excess number of fans, the performance was cancelled by police officers just before System of a Down took the stage. No announcement was made that the concert had been cancelled. Fans waited for more than an hour for the band to appear, but when a banner hanging at the back of the stage that read &quot;System of a Down&quot; was removed by security, the audience rushed the stage, destroying all the band&#x27;s touring gear (approximately $30,000 worth of equipment) and began to riot, throwing rocks at police, breaking windows, and knocking over portable toilets. The riot lasted six hours, during which six arrests were made. The band&#x27;s manager, David &quot;Beno&quot; Benveniste, later said that the riot could have been avoided if System of a Down had been permitted to perform or had they been allowed to make a statement at the concert regarding the cancellation. System of a Down&#x27;s scheduled in-store performance the next day was cancelled to prevent a similar riot.

Later that month, System of a Down embarked on tour in the United States and Mexico with Slipknot. During their concert at Grand Rapids, Michigan&#x27;s Van Andel Arena in October 2001, Odadjian was harassed, racially profiled and physically beaten by some guards when he attempted to enter backstage. After the attack, he received medical help from the arena personnel and the police in place. Odadjian then filed a lawsuit against DuHadway Kendall Security, the company the guards were working for. Despite this incident, the tour, as a whole, was a success and System of a Down later co-headlined the Pledge of Allegiance leg of Slipknot&#x27;s Iowa World Tour.

==Reception==
===Critical===
On review aggregator website Metacritic, &quot;Toxicity&quot; holds a score of 73 out of 100, based on reviews from nine critics, which indicates &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. AllMusic writer Eduardo Rivadavia called &quot;Toxicity&quot; &quot;hands down one of 2001&#x27;s top metal releases&quot; and wrote that the album &quot;may well prove to be a lasting heavy metal classic to boot&quot;. &quot;Toxicity&quot; is one of only 21 albums to achieve a perfect rating from &quot;Blabbermouth.net&quot;, with writer Don Kaye praising System of a Down in a contemporary review of the album as &quot;one of the few bands that people may still be talking about ten years from now&quot;. &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; writer Don Kaye praised the band as &quot;probably the most vital band around in the big, wide world of metal right now&quot;. Ben Myers of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; stated that the band had &quot;gone and bettered&quot; their debut album and hailed &quot;Toxicity&quot; as &quot;metal album of the year, hands down&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; wrote that &quot;Toxicity&quot; &quot;matches Slipknot for manic intensity while employing a freeform approach to songcraft which invites comparison to the lunatic-fringe rock of the &#x27;60s&quot;.

Referring to &quot;Toxicity&quot; as &quot;both manic and schizoid&quot;, Keith Harris of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted Tankian&#x27;s ability to veer &quot;easily from sing-rap rhythm to Korn-ish hysterics to demonic baritone growl to doomily ruminative&quot; and that &quot;the music insists on forward motion without trapping itself in a thrashy lock-step rut&quot;. Tom Sinclair of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the album &quot;strange and engaging&quot;, with a wide variety of sounds which &quot;all adds up to bizarro type of metal that has a warped majesty and strength&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; cited &quot;Prison Song&quot; and &quot;Bounce&quot; as highlights and later assigned the album a one-star honorable rating. &quot;Spin&quot;″s Joe Gross wrote that the band &quot;have an undeniable nerd-prog charm&quot;. &quot;Uncut&quot;, on the other hand, panned &quot;Toxicity&quot; as &quot;virtually unlistenable&quot;.

===Commercial===
&quot;Toxicity&quot; peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 220,000 copies in its first week of release. The album also topped the Canadian Albums Chart. &quot;Toxicity&quot; sold at least 2,700,000 copies in the United States, and at least 12,000,000 copies worldwide. On July 19, 2022, the album was certified sextuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.

All of the album&#x27;s singles reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; peaked at number 76, &quot;Toxicity&quot; at number 70, and &quot;Aerials&quot; at number 55. &quot;Aerials&quot; would remain the band&#x27;s biggest domestic hit until &quot;B.Y.O.B.&quot; surpassed it, reaching number 27 in 2005. &quot;Aerials&quot; peaked at number one on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart and number one on the Alternative Songs chart. &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; and &quot;Toxicity&quot; were both top ten hits. In 2005, &quot;Toxicity&quot; went to number one on the Catalog Albums chart. Added to the 2001 Clear Channel memorandum, &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; was temporarily pulled from playlists of most radio stations after the September 11 attacks in 2001, as it featured some lyrics that Clear Channel deemed inappropriate following the attacks. The song returned to the airwaves when things settled down.

===Accolades===

<doc id="170567" wikidata="Q274160" url="?curid=170567" title="Toxicity">
<text>Toxicity is the degree to which a chemical substance or a particular mixture of substances can damage an organism. Toxicity can refer to the effect on a whole organism, such as an animal, bacterium, or plant, as well as the effect on a substructure of the organism, such as a cell (cytotoxicity) or an organ such as the liver (hepatotoxicity). Sometimes the word is more or less synonymous with poisoning in everyday usage.

A central concept of toxicology is that the effects of a toxicant are dose-dependent; even water can lead to water intoxication when taken in too high a dose, whereas for even a very toxic substance such as snake venom there is a dose below which there is no detectable toxic effect. Toxicity is species-specific, making cross-species analysis problematic. Newer paradigms and metrics are evolving to bypass animal testing, while maintaining the concept of toxicity endpoints.

==Etymology==
In Ancient Greek medical literature, the adjective &quot;τοξικόν&quot; (meaning &quot;toxic&quot;) was used to describe substances which had the ability of &quot;causing death or serious debilitation or exhibiting symptoms of infection.&quot; The word draws its origins from the Greek noun τόξον &quot;&quot; (meaning &quot;arc&quot;), in reference to the use of bows and poisoned arrows as weapons.

English-speaking American culture has adopted several figurative usages for &quot;toxicity&quot;, often when describing harmful inter-personal relationships or character traits (e.g. &quot;toxic masculinity&quot;).

==History==
Humans have a deeply rooted history of not only being aware of toxicity, but also taking advantage of it as a tool. Archaeologists studying bone arrows from caves of Southern Africa have noted the likelihood that some aging 72,000 to 80,000 years old were dipped in specially prepared poisons to increase their lethality. Although scientific instrumentation limitations make it difficult to prove concretely, archaeologists hypothesize the practice of making poison arrows was widespread in cultures as early as the paleolithic era. The San people of Southern Africa have managed to preserved this practice into the modern era, with the knowledge base to form complex mixtures from poisonous beetles and plant derived extracts, yielding an arrow-tip product with a shelf life beyond several months to a year.

==Types==

There are generally five types of toxicities: chemical, biological, physical, radioactive and behavioural.

Disease-causing microorganisms and parasites are toxic in a broad sense but are generally called pathogens rather than toxicants. The biological toxicity of pathogens can be difficult to measure because the threshold dose may be a single organism. Theoretically one virus, bacterium or worm can reproduce to cause a serious infection. If a host has an intact immune system, the inherent toxicity of the organism is balanced by the host&#x27;s response; the effective toxicity is then a combination. In some cases, e.g. cholera toxin, the disease is chiefly caused by a nonliving substance secreted by the organism, rather than the organism itself. Such nonliving biological toxicants are generally called toxins if produced by a microorganism, plant, or fungus, and venoms if produced by an animal.

Physical toxicants are substances that, due to their physical nature, interfere with biological processes. Examples include coal dust, asbestos fibres or finely divided silicon dioxide, all of which can ultimately be fatal if inhaled. Corrosive chemicals possess physical toxicity because they destroy tissues, but are not directly poisonous unless they interfere directly with biological activity. Water can act as a physical toxicant if taken in extremely high doses because the concentration of vital ions decreases dramatically with too much water in the body. Asphyxiant gases can be considered physical toxicants because they act by displacing oxygen in the environment but they are inert, not chemically toxic gases.

Radiation can have a toxic effect on organisms.

Behavioral toxicity refers to the undesirable effects of essentially therapeutic levels of medication clinically indicated for a given disorder (DiMascio, Soltys and Shader, 1970). These undesirable effects include anticholinergic effects, alpha-adrenergic blockade, and dopaminergic effects, among others.

==Measuring==
Toxicity can be measured by its effects on the target (organism, organ, tissue or cell). Because individuals typically have different levels of response to the same dose of a toxic substance, a population-level measure of toxicity is often used which relates the probabilities of an outcome for a given individual in a population. One such measure is the . When such data does not exist, estimates are made by comparison to known similar toxic things, or to similar exposures in similar organisms. Then, &quot;safety factors&quot; are added to account for uncertainties in data and evaluation processes. For example, if a dose of a toxic substance is safe for a laboratory rat, one might assume that one-tenth that dose would be safe for a human, allowing a safety factor of 10 to allow for interspecies differences between two mammals; if the data are from fish, one might use a factor of 100 to account for the greater difference between two chordate classes (fish and mammals). Similarly, an extra protection factor may be used for individuals believed to be more susceptible to toxic effects such as in pregnancy or with certain diseases. Or, a newly synthesized and previously unstudied chemical that is believed to be very similar in effect to another compound could be assigned an additional protection factor of 10 to account for possible differences in effects that are probably much smaller. This approach is very approximate, but such protection factors are deliberately very conservative, and the method has been found to be useful in a wide variety of applications.

Assessing all aspects of the toxicity of cancer-causing agents involves additional issues, since it is not certain if there is a minimal effective dose for carcinogens, or whether the risk is just too small to see. In addition, it is possible that a single cell transformed into a cancer cell is all it takes to develop the full effect (the &quot;one hit&quot; theory).

It is more difficult to determine the toxicity of chemical mixtures than a pure chemical because each component displays its own toxicity, and components may interact to produce enhanced or diminished effects. Common mixtures include gasoline, cigarette smoke, and industrial waste. Even more complex are situations with more than one type of toxic entity, such as the discharge from a malfunctioning sewage treatment plant, with both chemical and biological agents.

The preclinical toxicity testing on various biological systems reveals the species-, organ- and dose-specific toxic effects of an investigational product. The toxicity of substances can be observed by (a) studying the accidental exposures to a substance (b) in vitro studies using cells/ cell lines (c) in vivo exposure on experimental animals. Toxicity tests are mostly used to examine specific adverse events or specific endpoints such as cancer, cardiotoxicity, and skin/eye irritation. Toxicity testing also helps calculate the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) dose and is helpful for clinical studies.

==Classification==
For substances to be regulated and handled appropriately they must be properly classified and labelled. Classification is determined by approved testing measures or calculations and has determined cut-off levels set by governments and scientists (for example, no-observed-adverse-effect levels, threshold limit values, and tolerable daily intake levels). Pesticides provide the example of well-established toxicity class systems and toxicity labels. While currently many countries have different regulations regarding the types of tests, numbers of tests and cut-off levels, the implementation of the Globally Harmonized System has begun unifying these countries.

Global classification looks at three areas: Physical Hazards (explosions and pyrotechnics), Health Hazards and environmental hazards.

===Health hazards===
The types of toxicities where substances may cause lethality to the entire body, lethality to specific organs, major/minor damage, or cause cancer. These are globally accepted definitions of what toxicity is. Anything falling outside of the definition cannot be classified as that type of toxicant.

====Acute toxicity====

Acute toxicity looks at lethal effects following oral, dermal or inhalation exposure. It is split into five categories of severity where Category 1 requires the least amount of exposure to be lethal and Category 5 requires the most exposure to be lethal. The table below shows the upper limits for each category.

Note: The undefined values are expected to be roughly equivalent to the category 5 values for oral and dermal administration.

====Other methods of exposure and severity====
Skin corrosion and irritation are determined through a skin patch test analysis, similar to an allergic inflammation patch test. This examines the severity of the damage done; when it is incurred and how long it remains; whether it is reversible and how many test subjects were affected.

Skin corrosion from a substance must penetrate through the epidermis into the dermis within four hours of application and must not reverse the damage within 14 days. Skin irritation shows damage less severe than corrosion if: the damage occurs within 72 hours of application; or for three consecutive days after application within a 14-day period; or causes inflammation which lasts for 14 days in two test subjects. Mild skin irritation is minor damage (less severe than irritation) within 72 hours of application or for three consecutive days after application.

Serious eye damage involves tissue damage or degradation of vision which does not fully reverse in 21 days. Eye irritation involves changes to the eye which do fully reverse within 21 days.

====Other categories====
* Respiratory sensitizers cause breathing hypersensitivity when the substance is inhaled.
* A substance which is a skin sensitizer causes an allergic response from a dermal application.
* Carcinogens induce cancer, or increase the likelihood of cancer occurring.
*Neurotoxicity is a form of toxicity in which a biological, chemical, or physical agent produces an adverse effect on the structure or function of the central or peripheral nervous system. It occurs when exposure to a substance – specifically, a neurotoxin or neurotoxicant– alters the normal activity of the nervous system in such a way as to cause permanent or reversible damage to nervous tissue. 
* Reproductively toxic substances cause adverse effects in either sexual function or fertility to either a parent or the offspring.
* Specific-target organ toxins damage only specific organs.
* Aspiration hazards are solids or liquids which can cause damage through inhalation.

===Environmental hazards===
An Environmental hazard can be defined as any condition, process, or state adversely affecting the environment. These hazards can be physical or chemical, and present in air, water, and/or soil. These conditions can cause extensive harm to humans and other organisms within an ecosystem.

====Common types of environmental hazards====
* Water: detergents, fertilizer, raw sewage, prescription medication, pesticides, herbicides, heavy metals, PCBs
* Soil: heavy metals, herbicides, pesticides, PCBs
* Air: particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, asbestos, ground-level ozone, lead (from aircraft fuel, mining, and industrial processes)
The EPA maintains a list of priority pollutants for testing and regulation.

====Occupational hazards====
Workers in various occupations may be at a greater level of risk for several types of toxicity, including neurotoxicity. The expression &quot;Mad as a hatter&quot; and the &quot;Mad Hatter&quot; of the book Alice in Wonderland derive from the known occupational toxicity of hatters who used a toxic chemical for controlling the shape of hats. Exposure to chemicals in the workplace environment may be required for evaluation by industrial hygiene professionals.

=====Hazards for small businesses=====
=====Hazards from medical waste and prescription disposal=====
=====Hazards in the arts=====
Hazards in the arts have been an issue for artists for centuries, even though the toxicity of their tools, methods, and materials was not always adequately realized. Lead and cadmium, among other toxic elements, were often incorporated into the names of artist&#x27;s oil paints and pigments, for example, &quot;lead white&quot; and &quot;cadmium red&quot;.

20th-century printmakers and other artists began to be aware of the toxic substances, toxic techniques, and toxic fumes in glues, painting mediums, pigments, and solvents, many of which in their labelling gave no indication of their toxicity. An example was the use of xylol for cleaning silk screens. Painters began to notice the dangers of breathing painting mediums and thinners such as turpentine. Aware of toxicants in studios and workshops, in 1998 printmaker Keith Howard published &quot;Non-Toxic Intaglio Printmaking&quot; which detailed twelve innovative Intaglio-type printmaking techniques including photo etching, digital imaging, acrylic-resist hand-etching methods, and introducing a new method of non-toxic lithography.

====Mapping environmental hazards====
There are many environmental health mapping tools. TOXMAP is a Geographic Information System (GIS) from the Division of Specialized Information Services of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) that uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s (EPA) Toxics Release Inventory and Superfund programs. TOXMAP is a resource funded by the US Federal Government. TOXMAP&#x27;s chemical and environmental health information is taken from NLM&#x27;s Toxicology Data Network 
(TOXNET) and PubMed, and from other authoritative sources.

====Aquatic toxicity====
Aquatic toxicity testing subjects key indicator species of fish or crustacea to certain concentrations of a substance in their environment to determine the lethality level. Fish are exposed for 96 hours while crustacea are exposed for 48 hours. While GHS does not define toxicity past 100 mg/L, the EPA currently lists aquatic toxicity as &quot;practically non-toxic&quot; in concentrations greater than 100 ppm.

Note: A category 4 is established for chronic exposure, but simply contains any toxic substance which is mostly insoluble, or has no data for acute toxicity.

==Factors influencing toxicity==
Toxicity of a substance can be affected by many different factors, such as the pathway of administration (whether the toxicant is applied to the skin, ingested, inhaled, injected), the time of exposure (a brief encounter or long term), the number of exposures (a single dose or multiple doses over time), the physical form of the toxicant (solid, liquid, gas), the concentration of the substance, and in the case of gases, the partial pressure (at high ambient pressure, partial pressure will increase for a given concentration as a gas fraction), the genetic makeup of an individual, an individual&#x27;s overall health, and many others. Several of the terms used to describe these factors have been included here.

; Acute exposure: A single exposure to a toxic substance which may result in severe biological harm or death; acute exposures are usually characterized as lasting no longer than a day.
; Chronic exposure: Continuous exposure to a toxicant over an extended period of time, often measured in months or years; it can cause irreversible side effects.

==Alternatives to dose-response framework==
Considering the limitations of the dose-response concept, a novel Abstract Drug Toxicity Index (DTI) has been proposed recently. DTI redefines drug toxicity, identifies hepatotoxic drugs, gives mechanistic insights, predicts clinical outcomes and has potential as a screening tool.

<doc id="170568" wikidata="Q3402278" url="?curid=170568" title="William de Braose (died 1230)">
<text>William de Braose (c. 1197 – 2 May 1230) was the son of Reginald de Braose by his first wife, Grecia Briwere. He was an ill-fated member of the House of Braose, a powerful and long-lived dynasty of Marcher Lords.

==Biography==
William de Braose was born in Brecon, probably between 1197 and 1204. The Welsh, who detested him and his family name, called him &quot;Gwilym Ddu&quot;, Black William. He succeeded his father in his various lordships in 1227, including Abergavenny and Buellt.

William married Eva Marshal, daughter of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke. They had four daughters:
* Isabella de Braose (born c. 1222 – 1248), wife of Prince Dafydd ap Llywelyn
* Maud de Braose (born c. 1224 – 1301), wife of Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Mortimer another very powerful Marcher dynasty.
* Eleanor de Braose (c. 1226 – 1251), wife of Humphrey (son of Humphrey de Bohun) and mother of Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford.
* Eva de Braose (c. 1227 – July 1255), wife of William de Cantilupe (died 1254).

He was captured by the Welsh forces of Prince Llywelyn the Great, in fighting in the commote of Ceri near Montgomery, in 1228. William was ransomed for the sum of £2,000 and then furthermore made an alliance with Llywelyn, arranging to marry his daughter Isabella de Braose to Llywelyn&#x27;s only legitimate son Dafydd ap Llywelyn. However, it became known that William had committed adultery with Llywelyn&#x27;s wife, Joan, Lady of Wales, and Braose was taken at his own home and transported to Wales. The marriage planned between their two children did, however, take place.

The Chronicle of Ystrad Fflur&#x27;s entry for 1230 reads:
:&quot;In this year William de Breos the Younger, lord of Brycheiniog, was hanged by the Lord Llywelyn in Gwynedd, after he had been caught in Llywelyn&#x27;s chamber with the king of England&#x27;s daughter, Llywelyn&#x27;s wife&quot;.

Llywelyn had William publicly hanged on 2 May 1230, possibly at Crogen, near Bala, though others believe the hanging took place near Llywelyn&#x27;s palace at Abergwyngregyn.

After William&#x27;s death, his wife Eva continued to hold de Braose lands and castles in her own right. She was listed as the holder of Totnes in 1230, and was granted 12 marks to strengthen Hay Castle by King Henry III on the Close Rolls (1234–1237).

==Legacy==
With William&#x27;s death by hanging and his having four daughters, who divided the de Braose inheritance between them and no male heir, the titles now passed to the junior branch of the de Braose dynasty, and the only male heir was now John de Braose who had already inherited the titles of Gower and Bramber from his far-sighted uncle Reginald de Braose.

<text>Isla de los Estados is an Argentine island that lies off the eastern extremity of Tierra del Fuego, from which it is separated by the Le Maire Strait. The island is part of the Argentine province of Tierra del Fuego, and of the department and city of Ushuaia. It has been declared an &quot;Ecological, Historic, and Tourist Provincial Reserve&quot; (&quot;Reserva provincial ecológica, histórica y turística&quot;), with access limited to tours from Ushuaia.

==Etymology==
The island was named after the Netherlands States-General, the Dutch parliament (English: Staten Island, from the Dutch &quot;Stateneiland&quot;; Chuainisin in the Yamana language, meaning &quot;land of abundance&quot;; Jaiwesen in the Haush language, meaning &quot;region of cold&quot;; and Kéoin-harri in the Selknam language, meaning &quot;mountain range of the roots&quot;) 

==History==
Prior to European arrival, the island was visited by the Yamana people, who inhabited the islands south of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego.

The first Europeans to encounter the island were the Spanish naval captain Francisco de Hoces and his crew in 1526. His ship, the &quot;San Lesmes&quot;, was part of the Spanish Loaísa expedition to the Pacific Ocean. The ship found the island after it had become separated from the rest of the fleet in a storm.

Almost a century after the Spaniards, the Dutch explorers Jacob le Maire and Willem Schouten passed the island on 25 December 1615, naming it &quot;Staten Landt&quot;. Le Maire and Schouten sailed their ship, &quot;Eendracht&quot;, through a route south of the Straits of Magellan, a route now called the Le Maire Strait. To his left Le Maire noted the land mass which he called &quot;Staten Landt&quot;; he theorized it was perhaps a portion of the great &#x27;Southern Continent.&#x27; (The first European name for New Zealand was Staten Landt, the name given to it by the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, who in 1642 became the first European to see the islands. Tasman also assumed it was part of the &#x27;Southern Continent&#x27; later known as Antarctica.)

The Dutch expedition to Valdivia of 1643 intended to sail through Le Maire Strait but strong winds made it instead drift south and east. The small fleet led by Hendrik Brouwer managed to enter the Pacific Ocean sailing south of the island disproving earlier beliefs that it was part of Terra Australis.

On New Year&#x27;s Day, 1775, Captain James Cook named what is now &quot;Puerto Año Nuevo&quot;, &quot;New Year&#x27;s Port&quot;. Seal hunters established a short-lived factory there (1786-1787), but abandoned it after &quot;Duke of York&quot; wrecked there on 11 September 1787 while bringing supplies.

No Europeans are known to have settled on the island for more than 200 years. In 1862 Argentine pilot Luis Piedrabuena established a shelter near Port Cook, and built a small seal oil extraction facility on the island.

The island is also referenced in Richard Henry Dana Jr.&#x27;s book &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; as the first land they see after leaving San Diego. He describes the land as &quot;. . . bare, broken, and girt with rocks and ice, with here and there, between rocks and broken hillocks, a little stunted vegetation of shrubs. . .&quot;

More than twenty years later, the San Juan del Salvamento Lighthouse was inaugurated on 25 May 1884, by Comodoro Augusto Lasserre. It operated until September 1900. The lighthouse, better known as &quot;Faro del fin del mundo&quot; (&quot;Lighthouse at the end of the world&quot;), is said to have inspired Jules Verne&#x27;s novel &quot;The Lighthouse at the End of the World&quot; (1905). A military prison was based on the island from 1896 to 1902. It had to be moved to Tierra del Fuego after being compromised by the strong winds.

==Geography==
The island is approximately long east-west, and wide, with an area of . The island is deeply indented by bays. Its highest point is , and is considered to be the last prominence of the Andes mountain range. It receives around of rain per year.

The island is surrounded by minor islands and rocks, the largest being &quot;Observatorio&quot; island north, with an area of . At the eastern end of the island is Cape Saint John, a landmark for ships sailing around the island in order to avoid the currents and tides of the Le Maire Strait to the west.

The only settlement is the Puerto Parry Naval Station, located in a deep and narrow fjord on the northern coast of the island. The naval station, established in 1978, is staffed by a team of four marines on a 45-day rotation. They monitor environmental conservation and ship movements, and provide emergency assistance.

===Geology===
The island is mainly composed of the Jurassic Lemaire Formation, composed of tuffs and lavas. The &quot;Islas Año Nuevo&quot;, &quot;Isla Observatoria&quot;, and the &quot;Caleta Lacroix&quot; region on the west coast, however, have exposures of the Jurassic-Cretaceous Beauvoir Formation, mainly composed of shales, mudstones, limestones, and graywacke, plus silt, clay, sand and gravel glacial fluvial deposits. There are at least 18 fjords, with associated glacial sediments such as moraines and till, especially prevalent at Cape San Antonio and Cape Colnett on the north coast. Key fjords on the north coast include Port Hoppner, Port Parry, Port Basil Hall, Port Año Nuevo, Port Cook, and Port San Juan Del Salvamento going east to west. Key fjords on the south coast include &quot;Bahía Capitan Cánepa&quot;, Port Lobo, Port Vancouver, and &quot;Bahía Blossom&quot;, going east to west. Cape Kempe on the south coast lies opposite Cape San Antonio. 

===Climate===
The island has a cold and humid climate and is characterized by rapid and unpredictable changes in the weather from day to day. Under the Köppen climate classification, despite the vegetation, it would be classified as a mild tundra climate (&quot;ET&quot;), a cold climate with a mean temperature in the warmest month below with abundant precipitation year-round.

The climate of the island is strongly influenced by the subpolar low pressure system which develops around the Antarctic Circle and the surrounding oceans. Being located between the semi–permanent high pressure cell and the subpolar low (which does not change in intensity through the year and have little seasonal variation), the island is exposed to westerlies throughout the year.

Temperatures are low year round but without extreme minimum temperatures. The mean temperature in summer is with mean extremes of and while in winter, the mean temperature is with mean extremes of and . Mean temperatures are lower than in Tierra del Fuego but due to the moderating influence of the ocean, extreme minimum temperatures are higher than in Tierra del Fuego. Coastal areas have average temperatures above in the coldest month while higher altitude locations may average below .

Though no reliable records are available, it is estimated that the island averages around of precipitation per year. However, owing to its relief, precipitation is highly variable across the island. In the eastern parts of the island, it averages based on 4 years of data. Precipitation occurs frequently on the island, averaging 252 days with precipitation. June is the wettest month while October is the driest. Thunderstorms are very rare. Snow frequently falls during the winter months, averaging 33 days although snow can fall during Autumn and Spring. The island receives high cloud cover throughout the year, with 74% of the days being cloudy. June is the cloudiest month while October is the least cloudy month. Fog is uncommon, averaging only 16 days per year. Similar to the rest of Patagonia, the island is exposed to strong westerly winds. These winds often carry moisture with them, leading to frequent storms. Average wind speeds range from a high of in August to a low of in December.

===Flora and fauna===
Isla de los Estados is covered with dense low forests of &quot;Nothofagus&quot; southern beech. The animal life is composed mainly of penguins, orcas, seals, seagulls and cormorants, as well as the human-introduced deer and goats. The island is the location of one of the more southerly Atlantic breeding colonies of the Magellanic penguin. As early as the last part of the 18th century, Isla de los Estados was used as a seal harvesting location. The island and surrounding waters, including the Burdwood ocean bank to its east, has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of southern rockhopper and Magellanic penguins, imperial shags and striated caracaras.

<doc id="170570" wikidata="Q1141571" url="?curid=170570" title="Macalester College">
<text>Macalester College ( ) is a private liberal arts college in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States. Founded in 1874, Macalester is exclusively an undergraduate four-year institution with an enrollment of 2,142 students in the fall of 2023. The college has Scottish roots and emphasizes internationalism and multiculturalism.

The college offers 39 majors, 40 minors, and 11 concentrations. Students also have the option to design their own major. Macalester&#x27;s sports teams compete in the NCAA Division III-level Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. The college&#x27;s 60-acre main campus is bordered by Summit Avenue to the north and St. Clair Avenue to the south. The 300-acre Ordway Field Station, a nature reserve and research station, is on the outskirts of the Twin Cities, along the Mississippi River.

==History==
Macalester College was founded by Edward Duffield Neill in 1874 with help from the Presbyterian Church in Minnesota. Neill had served as a chaplain in the American Civil War and traveled to Minnesota Territory in 1849. He became connected politically and socially. He went on to found two local churches, was appointed the first Chancellor of the University of Minnesota, and became the state&#x27;s first superintendent of public education. In leaving the University of Minnesota Board of Regents he desired to build a religious college affiliated with the Presbyterian Church that would also be open to members of other Christian churches.

The college&#x27;s original name was Baldwin College; it was affiliated with the Baldwin School, a Presbyterian secondary school. After a large donation from Charles Macalester, a prominent businessman and philanthropist from Philadelphia, the institution was renamed Macalester College. Macalester donated a hotel, the Winslow House, as the first permanent classroom building. With additional funding from the Presbyterian Church and its trustees, Macalester College opened for courses in 1885 with five teachers, six freshmen, and 52 preparatory students.

James Wallace joined the faculty in 1887 and later became president. He helped stabilize the college&#x27;s finances and advance the institution. During his tenure, Macalester created a focus on a liberal arts curriculum. In 1897, Nellie A. Hope was the first woman appointed to the institution&#x27;s newly organized music department.

In 2008 Macalester publicly launched a $150 million campaign. In 2009, construction was completed on Markim Hall, a new home for the Institute for Global Citizenship. Plans called for the building to qualify for Platinum certification under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) system, a building rating system devised by the U.S. Green Building Council that evaluates structures&#x27; sustainability and environmental impact. In 2012, Macalester opened its renovated and expanded Janet Wallace Fine Arts Center.

In 2020, Suzanne Rivera became the college&#x27;s 17th president; she is the first woman and first Hispanic person to serve in the role.

==Campus==
===Sustainability===
In the Sustainable Endowments Institute&#x27;s 2011 College Sustainability Report Card, Macalester received an overall grade of A−, earning it recognition as an &quot;Overall Campus Sustainability Leader&quot;. In 2011, The Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) awarded Macalester a Sustainability Tracking, Assessment &amp; Rating System (STARS) Silver Rating in recognition of its sustainability achievements.

Many student organizations focus on sustainability, including Macalester Conservation and Renewable Energy Society (MacCARES), Minnesota Public Interest Research Group (MPIRG), Mac Bike, Macalester Urban Land and Community Health (MULCH), and Outing Club.

In April 2003, Macalester installed a 10 kW Urban Wind Turbine on campus thanks to that year&#x27;s senior class gift donating the installation cost and Xcel Energy donating the tower and turbine. MacCARES is developing a proposal for Macalester to invest in a Utility-Scale Wind Turbine in the range of 2MW. Other projects include the Eco-House, a student residence with a range of green features and research opportunities; a rain garden that prevents stormwater from running off into groundwater, a bike share program, and a veggie co-op. The Class of 2008 designated its senior class gift to a Sustainability Fund to support initiatives to improve environmental sustainability on campus and in the greater community. On January 1, 2013, Macalester started campus composting.

In September 2009, Macalester set a goal to become carbon-neutral by 2025 and Zero-Waste by 2020. The school is a signatory to the Talloires Declaration and the American College and University President&#x27;s Climate Commitment, the latter obligating the college to work toward carbon neutrality. On April 18, 2012, President Brian Rosenberg signed the &quot;Commitment to Sustainable Practices of Higher Education Institutions on the Occasion of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development&quot;.

In 2009, Macalester opened Markim Hall, a LEED Platinum building that houses the school&#x27;s Institute for Global Citizenship. The building uses 45% less water and 75% less energy than a typical Minnesota building. Macalester is planning to remodel its Music, Theater, and Art buildings and is designing them to Minnesota B3 Guidelines.

Recent sustainability efforts have highlighted the intersection of social justice and climate change at Macalester as well as the potential conflict between its on-campus sustainability and its investments. Since 2012, students have criticized the college for making significant endowment investments in fossil fuel companies, including direct investments in oil and gas private partnerships. The student organization Fossil Free Mac has led a campaign urging the college to divest from fossil fuel companies. The campaign initially proposed full endowment divestment from the top 200 publicly traded fossil fuel companies, which Macalester&#x27;s Social Responsibility Committee rejected in 2015. In 2018, the Social Responsibility Committee unanimously approved a revised Fossil Free Mac proposal advocating a moratorium on the college&#x27;s direct investment partnerships with oil and gas companies, which the board of trustees is considering. The divestment campaign has received significant support from the student body, student government, faculty, staff, and alumni.

Macalester maintains a high international enrollment for its institutional type as a percentage of its student body. As of fall 2023, international students constituted approximately 12% of the student body. Its 2,142 students come from 49 U.S. states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, the Mariana Islands and 102 countries; 31% of the U.S. student body are students of color. Macalester&#x27;s student body is 40% male and 60% female.

===Civic engagement===
Macalester is one of 360 institutions that have been awarded the Carnegie Community Engagement Classification for excellence in civic engagement. The college encourages student dialogue by bringing in speakers, hosting an International Roundtable to bring distinguished international scholars to discuss emerging global issues, and hosting collective meetings such as Women of Color.

Macalester links academic learning to community involvement. In 2011–12, 16 departments offered 59 courses with civic engagement components. Each year approximately 200 students complete internships, 65% of which are in the nonprofit sector, schools, government, or the arts. Macalester also allows students to earn their work-study financial aid award while working at a local nonprofit or elementary school.

Almost all students (96%) volunteer in the Twin Cities while at Macalester. Many student organizations encourage active civic engagement, including MPIRG, Maction, Queer Union (QU), Macalester Habitat for Humanity.

Macalester is the primary financial contributor and sponsor of the Minnesota Institute for Talented Youth, which was founded in 1967 and has its main facilities in the Lampert Building. MITY provides two different gifted education programs during the summer and one on weekends during the academic year. Macalester also participates in Project Pericles, a commitment to further encourage civic engagement at the college. In 2000, Macalester signed the Talloires Declaration, making a commitment to environmental sustainability, as well as a sweatshop pledge, making a commitment to fair-labor practices in the purchase of college apparel.

===LGBTQ community===
The Campus Pride Index awarded Macalester a full five out of five stars for LGBTQ-friendly campuses. In 2007, &quot;The Princeton Review &quot;named Macalester the most gay-friendly college in the nation. Macalester has started an initiative to ensure access to single-stall and all-gender bathrooms across campus.

Macalester has a student-powered Gender and Sexuality Resource Center that aims to build a culture of resistance against all forms of oppression. It also has active LGBTQ student organizations and groups, including Queer Union, the Trans Identity Collective, Allies Project Training, and the Macalester Out and Proud Community.

===Pipe band===
The college has a pipe band consisting of around 20 students, alumni, and community members. Bagpipes are performed at significant college events and are heard when applicants open their acceptance letters. Macalester offers students free bagpipes and lessons and has an official tartan plaid. In the 1930s, students jokingly brought bagpipes to campus as a reference to the college&#x27;s Scottish name, which started the tradition.

==Athletics==
Macalester&#x27;s athletic teams are nicknamed the Scots. Macalester is a member of the NCAA Division III Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC) in all sports. The Scots&#x27; football team set an NCAA Division III record by losing 50 straight games from 1974 to 1980. Earlham College broke that record in 2018, losing 51 straight games. In 1977, Macalester set a Division III record by allowing 59.1 points per game. The losing streak ended in dramatic fashion: Kicker Bob Kaye put a 23-yarder through the uprights with 11 seconds remaining in a September 1980 game as the Scots beat Mount Senario College. The Scots left the MIAC after the 2001 season and competed as independents until 2014, when they joined the Midwest Conference. Under head coach Tony Jennison, Macalester won the Midwest Conference title, the Scots&#x27; first conference football title since 1947. Macalester also won nine games in 2014, the most ever in a Scots season in their 121 years of intercollegiate football.

Both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer teams remain competitive, appearing in multiple NCAA playoffs since 1995. The women&#x27;s team won the NCAA championship in 1998. The 2010 men&#x27;s team won the MIAC regular-season championship and both the men and women&#x27;s teams received at-large bids for the 2010 NCAA Division III tournament. Both teams are well-supported by students, parents and alumni. Mental Floss cited one of Macalester sports fans&#x27; most (in)famous cheers—&quot;Drink blood, smoke crack, worship Satan, go Mac!&quot;—as one of &quot;7 Memorable Sports Chants&quot;.

Macalester Athletics compete in the Leonard Center, which opened in August 2008. The $45 million facility encompasses 175,000 square feet and includes a 200-meter track, a natatorium, a fitness center, several multipurpose rooms, and a health and wellness center. Materials from the former facility were disposed of in environmentally friendly ways, with some incorporated into the new structure.

Every year in early May, Macalester hosts the Al Storm Games, a competition between various athletes at Macalester consisting of various events such as a Hunger Games simulation.

While working at the University of Oulu in August 1988, he wrote the first IRC server and client programs, which he produced to replace the MUT (MultiUser Talk) program on the Finnish BBS OuluBox. Using the Bitnet Relay chat system as inspiration, Oikarinen continued to develop IRC over the next four years, receiving assistance from Darren Reed in co-authoring the IRC Protocol. In 1997, his development of IRC earned Oikarinen a Dvorak Award for Personal Achievement—Outstanding Global Interactive Personal Communications System; in 2005, the Millennium Technology Prize Foundation, a Finnish public-private partnership, honored him with one of three Special Recognition Awards.

He started working for medical image processing in 1990 in Oulu University Hospital, developing research software for a neurosurgical workstation, and between 1993 and 1996 he worked for Elekta in Stockholm, Sweden and Grenoble, France putting the research into commercial products marketed by Elekta. In 1997 he returned to Oulu University Hospital to finish his PhD as Joint Assistant Professor / Research Engineer, receiving the PhD from the University of Oulu in 1999, in areas of computer graphics and medical imaging. During these years he focused on telemedicine, volume rendering, signal processing and computed axial tomography. Once finishing his PhD, he has held the positions of Chief Software Architect of Add2Phone Oy (Helsinki, Finland), Head of R&amp;D in Capricode (Oulu, Finland) and General Manager in Nokia.

He is also partner and chief software architect at an electronic games developer called Numeric Garden (Espoo, Finland). 

Oikarinen and his wife, Kaija-Leena, were married in 1996 and have three children: Kasper, Matleena, and Marjaana.

Oikarinen has been working for Google since 2011, initially in Stockholm, Sweden, to work on the Google Hangouts project, and later on to develop its successor, Google Meet. In 2016 he moved to Kirkland, Washington and since 2021 he has again been working in Stockholm, Sweden.
