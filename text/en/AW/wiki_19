<text>Steppenwolf was an american-Canadian rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1967. The group was founded by singer/rhythm guitarist John Kay, keyboardist Goldy McJohn and drummer Jerry Edmonton, all formerly of the Canadian band the Sparrows. Guitarist Michael Monarch and bassist Rushton Moreve were recruited via notices placed in Los Angeles-area record and musical instrument stores.

Steppenwolf sold over 25 million records worldwide, released seven gold albums and one platinum album, and had 13 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles, of which seven were Top 40 hits, including three top 10 successes: &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot;, &quot;Magic Carpet Ride&quot; and &quot;Rock Me&quot;. Steppenwolf enjoyed worldwide success from 1968 to 1972, but clashing personalities led to the end of the core lineup. From 1980 to 2018, John Kay was the only original member involved, having been the lead singer since 1967. The band was called John Kay &amp; Steppenwolf from 1980 to 2018. In Canada, they had four top 10 songs, 12 top 40 and 14 in the top 100.

In 2016 the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominated them for induction in 2017. Although they fell short of enough votes to qualify for induction that year, in 2018 the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame selected one of their biggest singles – 1968&#x27;s &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot; – as an inaugural selection in their singles category.

==History==
===The Sparrows===
In 1965 John Kay joined the Sparrows and was followed by Goldy McJohn. The group eventually broke up. 

===Breakthrough, success, and decline (1967–1972)===
In late 1967, Gabriel Mekler urged Kay to re-form the Sparrows and suggested the name change to Steppenwolf, inspired by Hermann Hesse&#x27;s novel of the same name. Steppenwolf&#x27;s first two singles were &quot;A Girl I Knew&quot; and &quot;Sookie Sookie&quot;. The band finally rocketed to worldwide fame after their third single, &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot;, was released in 1968, as well as their version of Hoyt Axton&#x27;s &quot;The Pusher&quot;. Both of these tunes were used prominently in the 1969 counterculture cult film &quot;Easy Rider&quot; (both titles originally had been released on the band&#x27;s debut album). In the movie, &quot;Easy Rider&quot; the song &quot;The Pusher&quot; accompanies a drug deal, and Peter Fonda stuffing dollar bills into his Stars and Stripes-clad fuel tank, after which &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot; is heard in the opening credits, with Fonda and Dennis Hopper riding their Harley choppers through the America of the late 1960s. The song, which has been closely associated with motorcycles ever since, introduced to rock lyrics the signature term &quot;heavy metal&quot; (though not about a kind of music, but about a motorcycle: &quot;I like smoke and lightning, heavy metal thunder, racin&#x27; with the wind...&quot;). Written by Sparrow guitarist Dennis Edmonton, who had begun using the pen name Mars Bonfire and inspired by a billboard roadside advertisement Bonfire liked which depicted a motorcycle tearing through the billboard artwork, the song had already reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in August 1968. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.

In 1968 Steppenwolf played one of their biggest shows up to that time at the Fillmore East to rave reviews, sharing the bill with Buddy Rich and Children of God. On November 27, 1968, they played a concert with Iron Butterfly at the Baltimore Civic Center.

The group&#x27;s following albums had several more hit singles, including &quot;Magic Carpet Ride&quot; (which reached number three) from &quot;The Second&quot; and &quot;Rock Me&quot; (with its bridge lasting 1:06, which reached number 10) from &quot;At Your Birthday Party&quot;. It also sold in excess of a million units. &quot;Monster&quot;, which questioned US Vietnam War policy, was the band&#x27;s most political album. Following the &quot;Monster&quot; album from 1969, the following year, the band released &quot;Steppenwolf 7&quot;, which included the song &quot;Snowblind Friend&quot;, another Hoyt Axton-penned song about the era and attitudes of drugs and associated problems.

Several changes in the group&#x27;s personnel were made after the first few years. Bassist Rushton Moreve was fired from the group in 1968 for missing gigs after he became afraid to return to Los Angeles, convinced by his girlfriend that it was going to be leveled by an earthquake and fall into the sea. Rob Black briefly filled in for Moreve until former Sparrow bandmate Nick St. Nicholas came aboard in the latter months of 1968. Michael Monarch quit the group in August 1969 as his relationship with Kay deteriorated. Larry Byrom, who had been in TIME with Nick St. Nicholas, ably replaced Monarch on guitar.But Nick St. Nicholas was let go in mid-1970. He had supposedly appeared in nothing but rabbit ears and a jock strap at the Fillmore East in April 1970 – and his habit of wearing muumuus and kaftans on stage began to wear on Kay, whose penchant for leather vests and pants was more in line with the image he wanted for the band. George Biondo was then recruited, and the band lineup for their live performances in the middle of 1970 was John Kay, Jerry Edmonton, Goldy McJohn, Larry Byrom and George Biondo. However this lineup was also unable to remain together, as Byrom became upset with McJohn over personal issues and quit the band in the early part of 1971. Guitarist Kent Henry then replaced Byrom. 

In November 1971 the band released &quot;For Ladies Only&quot;, with the lineup consisting of Kay, Henry, Biondo, McJohn and Edmonton. The album was notable for several reasons, most notably the controversial LP inside cover art, the romantic, political, social lyrical content and the fact that it featured several of the group members on lead vocals.

===Breakup (1972–1973)===
The band broke up after a farewell concert in Los Angeles on Valentine&#x27;s Day, 1972. Kay went on to a brief solo career, scoring a minor solo hit in 1972 with &quot;I&#x27;m Movin&#x27; On&quot; from his album &quot;Forgotten Songs and Unsung Heroes&quot;. Although it received generally high marks from most critics, the album sales were disappointing in the US. Kay released a second solo album in 1973 on the Dunhill label titled &quot;My Sportin&#x27; Life&quot;. This album sold less than his first solo album and was less gritty and more LA studio-polish in sound.

Following the first official breakup of Steppenwolf, and after the release of Kay&#x27;s first solo album, a late summer and autumn 1972 tour in the US and Europe occurred, which featured Kay heading both the John Kay Band and Steppenwolf, at the top of the bill. Dunhill had released an album of a collection of Steppenwolf songs titled &quot;Rest in Peace&quot;. Thus, the tour was known as the RIP tour.

===Reunion (1974–1976)===
Steppenwolf reformed in 1974 with its core lineup of Kay, Edmonton and McJohn, along with longtime bassist Biondo and newcomer Bobby Cochran, Eddie Cochran&#x27;s nephew, on lead guitar. The band signed with Mums Records in retaliation for what Kay perceived as a lack of support by Dunhill Records for his solo albums. Their first reunion album was &quot;Slow Flux&quot;, which included their last top 40 hit, &quot;Straight Shootin&#x27; Woman&quot;.

In February 1975 McJohn was dismissed for what Kay described as a decline in the quality of his performances, as well as erratic behavior. McJohn was replaced by Andy Chapin on &quot;Hour of the Wolf&quot; in 1975, though McJohn appeared in artwork for the single to &quot;Caroline&quot;. After the album peaked at number 155, Kay attempted to dissolve the band again, but the label, now having been absorbed by Epic Records, insisted Steppenwolf record one more album to satisfy their contractual obligations. The ensuing album, &quot;Skullduggery&quot; (1976), featuring Wayne Cook on keyboards, was released without a tour to support it, and by the early fall of 1976, Steppenwolf disbanded a second time. Kay appeared in a segment of the popular music TV show &quot;The Midnight Special&quot; to announce the end of Steppenwolf and also played a solo version of the song &quot;Hey I&#x27;m Alright&quot;. This song appeared on Kay&#x27;s third solo album &quot;All In Good Time&quot;, released on Mercury Records in 1978.

===&quot;New Steppenwolf&quot; revival act (1976–1980)===
After Kay disbanded Steppenwolf, former members Goldy McJohn and Nick St. Nicholas formed a &quot;revival act&quot; called &quot;New Steppenwolf&quot;. McJohn did not last long, but St. Nicholas continued with the venture for several years. Various incarnations included, according to author Dave Thompson, a &quot;revolving door of musicians&quot; consisting of &quot;jobbing players&quot;. Among those players were vocalist Tom Holland (who would go on to form the B&#x27;zz and later Holland) and drummer Steve Riley of future W.A.S.P. and L.A. Guns fame. Yet another musician involved, guitarist Glen Bui, went on to work with Goldy McJohn until he died in 2017. &quot;The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll&quot; described these bands as &quot;unprofessional, bogus versions&quot; of Steppenwolf. Although Kay and Edmonton had originally licensed the use of the &quot;New Steppenwolf&quot; name, they later sued for breach of contract. St. Nicholas agreed in 1980 to cease use of the name, but legal disputes about promotional use of the Steppenwolf name continued until 2000.

===John Kay and Steppenwolf (1980–2018)===

Kay had a few meetings with David Pesnell about management, concert promotions and producing a new album for the band. Pesnell wanted to produce an album featuring new songs on side A, by the reformed band Three Dog Night and with side B of the album featuring songs by Steppenwolf. The album&#x27;s working name was &quot;Back to Back&quot;, a play on each band having a side of the album and the fact the bands were back together again. Pesnell&#x27;s concept was simple: each band should record four new songs, with a fifth song on each side featuring a medley of the band&#x27;s past songs. This would give the Pesnell-produced album a double release of singles to support a concert tour featuring the two bands. Though both bands liked the concept of the album and tour, the arguments included who would be side A and side B and which of the two would headline the upcoming concert tour.

The reformed John Kay and Steppenwolf line-up featured John Kay, Michael Palmer (guitars, backing vocals), Steve Palmer (drums, backing vocals), Danny Ironstone (keyboards, backing vocals) and Kurtis Teel on bass. The Palmer brothers had played in a group called Tall Water and had also been involved with Kay in his solo career playing live gigs in the late 1970s. Teel was replaced by Chad Peery and Ironstone by Brett Tuggle by 1981, and the new grouping released &quot;Live in London&quot; overseas. Tuggle was then displaced by Michael Wilk and a new studio album, &quot;Wolftracks&quot;, was released in 1982. &quot;Wolftracks&quot; was one of the earliest digitally recorded albums in the industry. It was recorded live on a two-track Sony digital recording system. Bassist Welton Gite, who appeared on this album, left shortly after its completion and was replaced by Gary Link, formerly with Dokken. Another album, &quot;Paradox&quot;, followed in 1984.

In December 1984 the band as it was disbanded and Kay and Wilk decided to continue in early 1985 with a pared-down quartet composed of Kay, Wilk, Wilk&#x27;s friend Ron Hurst (drums, backing vocals) and Rocket Ritchotte (guitars, backing vocals). Wilk also handled bass duties from his sequencing computer keyboards from then on. This line-up released &quot;Rock N&#x27; Roll Rebels&quot; (1987) and &quot;Rise &amp; Shine&quot; (1990); these were on the Qwil and I.R.S. Records imprints, respectively. Ritchotte had departed temporarily in 1989 to be replaced by Les Dudek and then Steve Fister, but then returned in 1990 for three more years. Fister (ex–Iron Butterfly) then came back in late 1993, but turned guitar duties over to Danny Johnson (formerly of Derringer, Rod Stewart and others) in 1996.

As the band was named after the novel &quot;Der Steppenwolf&quot; by German author Hermann Hesse, who was born in the Black Forest town of Calw, the city invited them to come over and play in the International Hermann-Hesse-Festival 2002, along with other bands inspired by Hesse, such as Anyone&#x27;s Daughter. 

The band performed what they then labeled their &quot;Farewell Concert&quot; on October 6, 2007, at Ripken Stadium in Aberdeen, Maryland, featuring Kay, keyboardist and programmer Michael Wilk, drummer Ron Hurst and guitarist Danny Johnson. However, the band, rejoined by bassist Gary Link, began touring again in June 2009.

Steppenwolf were nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017, but were not inducted.

On November 22, 2019 John Kay announced that the band&#x27;s October 14, 2018 show was their last.

<text>Beta Tauri is the second-brightest star in the constellation of Taurus. It has the official name Elnath; &quot;Beta Tauri&quot; is the current Bayer designation, which is Latinised from β Tauri and abbreviated Beta Tau or β Tau. The original designation of Gamma Aurigae is now rarely used. It is a chemically peculiar B7 giant star, 134 light years away from the Sun with an apparent magnitude of 1.65.

==Nomenclature==
This star has two Bayer designations: β Tauri (Latinised to Beta Tauri) and γ Aurigae (Latinised to Gamma Aurigae). Ptolemy considered the star to be shared by Auriga, and Johann Bayer assigned it a designation in both constellations. When the modern constellation boundaries were fixed in 1930, the designation γ Aurigae largely dropped from use.

The traditional name &quot;Elnath&quot;, variously &quot;El Nath&quot; or &quot;Alnath&quot;, comes from the Arabic word النطح &quot;an-naţħ&quot;, meaning &quot;the butting&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot; the bull&#x27;s horns). As in many other Arabic star names, the article ال is transliterated literally as &quot;el&quot;, yet overwhelmingly in Arabic pronunciation it is assimilated to the &quot;n&quot;, meaning it is omitted. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Elnath&quot; for this star.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Five Chariots&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of β Tauri, ι Aurigae, Capella, β Aurigae and θ Aurigae. Consequently, the Chinese name for β Tauri itself is (; .)

== Physical properties ==
The absolute magnitude of Beta Tauri is −1.34, similar to another star in Taurus, Maia in the Pleiades star cluster. Like Maia, β Tauri is a B-class giant with a luminosity 700 times solar (). It has evolved to become a giant star, larger and cooler than when it was on the main sequence.
However, being approximately 130 light-years distant compared to Maia&#x27;s estimated 360 light-years, β Tauri ranks as the second-brightest star in the constellation.

It is a mercury-manganese star, a type of non-magnetic chemically peculiar star with unusually large signatures of some heavy elements in its spectrum. Relative to the Sun, β Tauri is notable for a high abundance of manganese, but little calcium and magnesium. However, the lack of strong mercury signatures, together with notably high levels of silicon and chromium, have led some authors to give other classifications, including as a &quot;SrCrEu star&quot; or even an Ap star. Its limb-darkened angular diameter has been measured at . At a distance of , this corresponds to a linear radius of .

At the southern edge of the narrow plane of the Milky Way Galaxy a few degrees west of the galactic anticenter, β Tauri figures (appears) as a foreground object south of many nebulae and star clusters such as M36, M37, and M38. It is 5.39 degrees north of the ecliptic, still few enough to be occultable by the Moon. Such occultations occur when the Moon&#x27;s ascending node is near the March equinox, as in 2007. Most are visible only in the Southern Hemisphere, because the star is at the northern edge of the lunar occultation zone – but rarely as far north as southern California.

== Companions ==
A faint star is, angularly from our viewpoint, close enough for astronomers to consider, and guides to mention, the pair as a double star. This visual companion, BD+28°795B, has a position angle of 239 degrees and is separated from the main star by 33.4 arcseconds (″). Six angularly closer, even fainter stars have been found in a search for brown dwarf and planetary companionsall considered background objects.

A very close companion was reported from lunar occultation measurements at a distance of , but not confirmed by other observers. Radial velocity measurements indicate that Beta Tauri is a single-lined spectroscopic binary, but there is no published information about the companion or orbit.

<text>Isocrates (; ; 436–338 BC) was an ancient Greek rhetorician, one of the ten Attic orators. Among the most influential Greek rhetoricians of his time, Isocrates made many contributions to rhetoric and education through his teaching and written works.

Greek rhetoric is commonly traced to Corax of Syracuse, who first formulated a set of rhetorical rules in the fifth century BC. His pupil Tisias was influential in the development of the rhetoric of the courtroom, and by some accounts was the teacher of Isocrates. Within two generations, rhetoric had become an important art, its growth driven by social and political changes such as democracy and courts of law. Isocrates starved himself to death, two years before his 100th birthday.

== Early life and influences ==
Isocrates was born into a prosperous family in Athens at the height of Athens&#x27; power shortly before the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC). Suda writes that Isocrates was the son of Theodorus who owned a workshop that manufactured aulos. His mother&#x27;s name was Heduto. He had a sister and three brothers; two of the brothers were Tisippos (Ancient Greek: Τίσιππος) and Theomnestos (Ancient Greek: Θεόμνηστος).

Isocrates received a first-rate education. &quot;He is reported to have studied with several prominent teachers, including Tisias (one of the traditional founders of rhetoric), the sophists Prodicus and Gorgias, and the moderate oligarch Theramenes, and to have associated with Socrates, but these reports may reflect later views of his intellectual roots more than historical fact&quot;.

He passed his youth in a period following the death of Pericles, a time in which &quot;wealth – both public and private – was dissipated&quot;, and &quot;political decision were ill-conceived and violent&quot; according to the 2020 Encyclopedia Britannica. Isocrates would have been 14 years old when the democracy voted to kill all the male citizens of the small Thracian city of Scione. There are accounts, including that of Isocrates himself, stating that the Peloponnesian War wiped out his father&#x27;s estate, and Isocrates was forced to earn a living.

Late in his life, he married a woman named Plathane (daughter of the sophist Hippias) and adopted Aphareus (writer), one of her sons by a previous marriage.

==Career==
There is no evidence for Isocrates&#x27; participation in public life during Peloponnesian War (431–404).

His professional career is said to have begun with logography: he was a hired courtroom speechwriter. Athenian citizens did not hire lawyers; legal procedure required self-representation. Instead, they would hire people like Isocrates to write speeches for them. Isocrates had a great talent for this and he amassed a considerable fortune. According to Pliny the Elder (&quot;NH&quot; VII.30) he could sell a single oration for twenty talents. However, his weak voice meant that he was not himself a good public speaker. He played no direct part in state affairs, but he published many pamphlets which influenced the public and provide significant insight into major political issues of the day. 

===Pedagogy===
Around 392 BC Isocrates set up his own school of rhetoric at the Lyceum. Prior to Isocrates, teaching consisted of first-generation Sophists, such as Gorgias and Protagoras, walking from town to town as itinerants, who taught any individuals interested in political occupations how to be effective in public speaking. Isocrates encouraged his students to wander and observe public behavior in the city (Athens) to learn through imitation. His students aimed to learn how to serve the city. &quot;At the core of his teaching was an aristocratic notion of arete (&quot;virtue, excellence&quot;), which could be attained by pursuing philosophia – not so much the dialectical study of abstract subjects like epistemology and metaphysics that Plato marked as &quot;philosophy&quot; as the study and practical application of ethics, politics and public speaking&quot;. The philosopher Plato (a rival of Isocrates) founded his own academy in response to Isocrates&#x27; foundation.

Isocrates accepted no more than nine pupils at a time. Many of them went on to be prominent philosophers, legislators, historians, orators, writers, and military and political leaders. The first students in Isocrates&#x27; school were Athenians. However, after he published the &quot;Panegyricus&quot; in 380 BC, his reputation spread to many other parts of Greece. Some of his students included Isaeus, Lycurgus, Hypereides, Ephorus, Theopompus, Speusippus, and Timotheus. Many of these students remained under the instruction of Isocrates for three to four years. Timotheus had such a great appreciation for Isocrates that he erected a statue at Eleusis and dedicated it to him.

==Philosophy of rhetoric==

According to George Norlin, Isocrates defined rhetoric as outward feeling and inward thought of not merely expression, but reason, feeling, and imagination. Like most who studied rhetoric before and after him, Isocrates believed it was used to persuade ourselves and others, but also used in directing public affairs. Isocrates described rhetoric as &quot;that endowment of our human nature which raises us above mere animality and enables us to live the civilized life.&quot; Isocrates unambiguously defined his approach in the speech &quot;Against the Sophists&quot;. This polemic was written to explain and advertise the reasoning and educational principles behind his new school. He promoted broad-based education by speaking against two types of teachers: the Eristics, who disputed about theoretical and ethical matters, and the Sophists, who taught political debate techniques. Also, while Isocrates is viewed by many as being a rhetor and practicing rhetoric, he refers to his study as &quot;philosophia&quot;—which he claims as his own. &quot;Against the Sophists&quot; is Isocrates&#x27; first published work where he gives an account of philosophy. His principal method is to contrast his ways of teaching with Sophism. While Isocrates does not go against the Sophist method of teaching as a whole, he emphasizes his disagreement with bad Sophistic practices.

Isocrates&#x27; program of rhetorical education stressed the ability to use language to address practical problems, and he referred to his teachings as more of a philosophy than a school of rhetoric. He emphasized that students needed three things to learn: a natural aptitude which was inborn, knowledge training granted by teachers and textbooks, and applied practices designed by educators. He also stressed civic education, training students to serve the state. Students would practice composing and delivering speeches on various subjects. He considered natural ability and practice to be more important than rules or principles of rhetoric. Rather than delineating static rules, Isocrates stressed &quot;fitness for the occasion,&quot; or &quot;kairos&quot; (the rhetor&#x27;s ability to adapt to changing circumstances and situations). His school lasted for over fifty years, in many ways establishing the core of liberal arts education as we know it today, including oratory, composition, history, citizenship, culture, and morality.

==Publications==
Of the 60 orations in his name available in Roman times, 21 remained in transmission by the end of the medieval period. The earliest manuscripts dated from the ninth or tenth century, until fourth century copies of Isocrates&#x27; first three orations were found in a single codex during a 1990&#x27;s excavation at Kellis, a site in the Dakhla Oasis of Egypt. We have nine letters in his name, but the authenticity of four of those has been questioned. He is said to have compiled a treatise, the &quot;Art of Rhetoric,&quot; but there is no known copy. Other surviving works include his autobiographical &quot;Antidosis&quot;, and educational texts such as &quot;Against the Sophists&quot;.

Isocrates wrote a collection of ten known orations, three of which were directed to the rulers of Salamis on Cyprus. In &quot;To Nicocles&quot;, Isocrates suggests first how the new king might rule best. For the extent of the rest of the oration, Isocrates advises Nicocles of ways to improve his nature, such as the use of education and studying the best poets and sages. Isocrates concludes with the notion that, in finding the happy mean, it is better to fall short than to go to excess. His second oration concerning Nicocles was related to the rulers of Salamis on Cyprus; this was written for the king and his subjects. Isocrates again stresses that the surest sign of good understanding is education and the ability to speak well. The king uses this speech to communicate to the people what exactly he expects of them. Isocrates makes a point in stating that courage and cleverness are not always good, but moderation and justice are. The third oration about Cyprus is an encomium to Euagoras who is the father of Nicocles. Isocrates uncritically applauds Euagoras for forcibly taking the throne of Salamis and continuing rule until his assassination in 374 BC.

Two years after his completion of the three orations, Isocrates wrote an oration for Archidamus, the prince of Sparta. Isocrates considered the settling of the Thebans colonists in Messene a violation of the Peace of Antalcidas. He was bothered most by the fact that this ordeal would not restore the true Messenians but rather the Helots, in turn making these slaves masters. Isocrates believed justice was most important, which secured the Spartan laws but he did not seem to recognize the rights of the Helots. Ten years later Isocrates wrote a letter to Archidamus, now the king of Sparta, urging him to reconcile the Greeks, stopping their wars with each other so that they could end the insolence of the Persians.

At the end of the Social War in 355 BC, 80-year-old Isocrates wrote an oration addressed to the Athenian assembly entitled &quot;On the Peace;&quot; Aristotle called it &quot;On the Confederacy&quot;. Isocrates wrote this speech for the reading public, asking that both sides be given an unbiased hearing. Those in favour of peace have never caused misfortune, while those embracing war lurched into many disasters. Isocrates criticized the flatterers who had brought ruin to their public affairs.
===Antidosis===
===Panathenaicus===
In &quot;Panathenaicus,&quot; Isocrates argues with a student about the literacy of the Spartans. In section 250, the student claims that the most intelligent of the Spartans admired and owned copies of some of Isocrates&#x27; speeches. The implication is that some Spartans had books, were able to read them, and were eager to do so. The Spartans, however, needed an interpreter to clear up any misunderstandings of double meanings which might lie concealed beneath the surface of complicated words. This text indicates that some Spartans were not illiterate. This text is important to scholars&#x27; understanding of literacy in Sparta because it indicates that Spartans were able to read and that they often put written documents to use in their public affairs.

==Legacy==

Because of Plato&#x27;s attacks on the sophists, Isocrates&#x27; school – having its roots, if not the entirety of its mission, in rhetoric, the domain of the sophists – came to be viewed as unethical and deceitful. Yet many of Plato&#x27;s criticisms are hard to substantiate in the actual work of Isocrates; at the end of &quot;Phaedrus&quot;, Plato even shows Socrates praising Isocrates (though some scholars have taken this to be sarcasm). Isocrates saw the ideal orator as someone who must possess not only rhetorical gifts, but also a wide knowledge of philosophy, science, and the arts. He promoted the Greek ideals of freedom, self-control, and virtue; in this, he influenced several Roman rhetoricians, such as Cicero and Quintilian, and influenced the core concepts of liberal arts education.

Although Isocrates has been largely marginalized in the history of philosophy, his contributions to the study and practice of rhetoric have received more attention. Thomas M. Conley argues that through Isocrates&#x27; influence on Cicero, whose writings on rhetoric were the most widely and continuously studied until the modern era, &quot;it might be said that Isocrates, of all the Greeks, was the greatest.&quot; With the neo-Aristotelian turn in rhetoric, Isocrates&#x27; work sometimes gets cast as a mere precursor to Aristotle&#x27;s systematic account in &quot;On Rhetoric.&quot; However, Ekaterina Haskins reads Isocrates as an enduring and worthwhile counter to Aristotelian rhetoric. Rather than the Aristotelian position on rhetoric as a neutral tool, Isocrates understands rhetoric as an identity-shaping performance that activates and sustains civic identity. The Isocratean position on rhetoric can be thought of as ancient antecedent to the twentieth century theorist Kenneth Burke&#x27;s conception that rhetoric is rooted in identification. Isocrates&#x27; work has also been described as proto-Pragmatist, owing to his assertion that rhetoric makes use of probable knowledge with the aim resolving real problems in the world.

Isocrates&#x27; innovations in the art of rhetoric paid closer attention to expression and rhythm than any other Greek writer, though because his sentences were so complex and artistic, he often sacrificed clarity.

<doc id="168262" wikidata="Q1048439" url="?curid=168262" title="Traffic (band)">
<text>Traffic were an English rock band formed in Birmingham in April 1967 by Steve Winwood, Jim Capaldi, Chris Wood and Dave Mason. They began as a psychedelic rock group and diversified their sound through the use of instruments such as keyboards (such as the Mellotron and harpsichord), sitar, and various reed instruments, and by incorporating jazz and improvisational techniques in their music. 

The band had early success in the UK with their debut album &quot;Mr. Fantasy&quot; and non-album singles &quot;Paper Sun&quot;, &quot;Hole in My Shoe&quot;, and &quot;Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush&quot;. Their follow-up self-titled 1968 album was their most successful in Britain and featured one of their most popular songs, the widely covered &quot;Feelin&#x27; Alright?&quot;. Dave Mason left the band shortly after the album&#x27;s release, moving on to a solo career that produced a few minor hit songs in the 1970s. Traffic disbanded at the beginning of 1969, when Steve Winwood co-formed the supergroup Blind Faith. An album compiled from studio and live recordings, &quot;Last Exit&quot;, was released in 1969.

By 1970, Blind Faith had also broken up and Winwood, Jim Capaldi and Chris Wood reformed Traffic, with &quot;John Barleycorn Must Die&quot; being the band&#x27;s comeback album. It became the band&#x27;s biggest success in the United States to that point, reaching number 5. Their next LP, &quot;The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys&quot; (1971), went platinum in the US and became popular on FM radio, establishing Traffic as a leading progressive rock band. 1973&#x27;s &quot;Shoot Out at the Fantasy Factory&quot; and 1974&#x27;s &quot;When the Eagle Flies&quot; were further top 10 successes for the band in the US, and were both certified gold, though neither sold well in the UK. In 1974, the band broke up again. Steve Winwood went on to a successful solo career, with several hit singles and albums during the 1980s. Jim Capaldi also had some minor solo hits in the 1970s in his native UK but was less successful abroad. Chris Wood did sporadic session work until his death in 1983.

Winwood and Capaldi reformed as Traffic for a final album and tour in 1994. Traffic were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. Jim Capaldi died the following year.

==History==
===1960s: 1967–69===
Traffic&#x27;s singer, keyboardist, and guitarist Steve Winwood was the lead singer for the Spencer Davis Group at age 14. The Spencer Davis Group released four Top Ten singles and three Top Ten albums in the United Kingdom, as well as two Top Ten singles in the United States. Drummer/vocalist/lyricist Jim Capaldi and guitarist Dave Mason had both been in the Hellions and Deep Feeling, while woodwinds player Chris Wood came out of Locomotive.

Winwood, Capaldi, Mason, and Wood met when they jammed together at The Elbow Room, a club in Aston, Birmingham. After Winwood left the Spencer Davis Group in April 1967, the quartet formed Traffic. Capaldi came up with the name of the group while the four of them were waiting to cross the street in Dorchester, and was not referring to drug trafficking. Soon thereafter, they rented a cottage near the rural village of Aston Tirrold, Berkshire to write and rehearse new music.

Traffic signed to Chris Blackwell&#x27;s Island Records label (where Winwood&#x27;s elder brother Muff, also a member of the Spencer Davis Group, later became a record producer and executive), and their debut single &quot;Paper Sun&quot; became a UK hit in mid-1967 (#4 Canada). Their second single, Mason&#x27;s psych-pop &quot;Hole in My Shoe&quot;, was an even bigger hit (#4 Canada), and it became one of their best-known tracks. The band&#x27;s third single, &quot;Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush&quot;, was made for the soundtrack of the 1967 British feature film of the same name. Their debut album was &quot;Mr. Fantasy&quot;, produced by Jimmy Miller, and like the singles, was a hit in the UK but not as big elsewhere, although it did reach number 88 in the US.
Mason left the group due to artistic differences just after &quot;Mr. Fantasy&quot; was released, but rejoined for a few months of 1968, long enough to contribute to seven of ten songs on their second album, &quot;Traffic&quot;. Released in 1968, it included the original version of Mason&#x27;s &quot;Feelin&#x27; Alright&quot;, which was later recorded with great success by Joe Cocker and Three Dog Night. Winwood, Wood, and Capaldi wanted to take the group in a different direction, opting for a folk/blues style rather than their earlier psychedelic/eclectic rock sound, while Mason was oriented towards psychedelic pop. Mason also cited discomfort with the Traffic lifestyle. The band toured the US as a trio in late 1968, which led to the following year&#x27;s release of Traffic&#x27;s next album, &quot;Last Exit&quot;, one side of which was recorded live. During 1968 Winwood and Wood often played with Jimi Hendrix, and they both appear on The Jimi Hendrix Experience&#x27;s 1968 double album &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot;, as did an uncredited Mason.

The band was dissolved by Winwood&#x27;s leaving in early 1969. His departure went unexplained at the time, even to Capaldi and Wood, but he later said &quot;Because of the way I ended the Spencer Davis Group, I saw no reason why I shouldn&#x27;t leave Traffic and move on. It seemed to me a normal thing to do.&quot; Winwood&#x27;s comments clash with the fact that the Davis group continued after he left.

Winwood then formed the supergroup Blind Faith, which lasted less than a year, recording one album and undertaking one US tour. The remaining members of Traffic began a project with Mick Weaver (a.k.a. Wynder K. Frog), the short-lived Mason, Capaldi, Wood and Frog (later shortened to Wooden Frog), they played a few live dates and recorded some BBC sessions, but broke up before releasing any formal recordings.

===1970s: 1970–74===
After the break-up of Blind Faith in 1969, Winwood began working on a solo recording, bringing in Wood and Capaldi to contribute, and the project eventually turned into a new Traffic album — &quot;John Barleycorn Must Die&quot; — their most successful album yet. Traffic expanded its lineup in 1970, adding Winwood&#x27;s former Blind Faith bandmate Ric Grech on bass. Capaldi stopped drumming and nearly left the band after his infant son died from cot death. Drummer Jim Gordon of Derek and the Dominos and percussionist Rebop Kwaku Baah were added in 1971 to replace Capaldi, who moved to a role as percussionist, co-vocalist, and master of ceremonies. Dave Mason returned at that time for a third and final stint with the band, which lasted only six performances. The band released the live album &quot;Welcome to the Canteen&quot; in September 1971. Marking the band&#x27;s break with United Artists Records, the album did not bear the &quot;Traffic&quot; name on the cover or the record label, although the band&#x27;s logo appeared on the back cover. Instead, the album was credited to the band&#x27;s seven individual members (Winwood, Capaldi, Mason, Wood, Grech, Kwaku Baah, and Gordon). The album ended with a version of The Spencer Davis Group song &quot;Gimme Some Loving&quot;, which became a minor hit.

Following the departure of Mason, Traffic released &quot;The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys&quot; (1971), which was a Top 10 American album but did not chart in the UK. It sold over half a million copies in 1972 when it received a gold disc, and was awarded a R.I.A.A. platinum disc in March 1976 for over a million total sales. Once again, however, personnel problems wracked the band as Grech and Gordon were fired in December 1971 due to excessive drug use, and the month after, Winwood&#x27;s struggles with peritonitis brought Traffic to a standstill. Jim Capaldi used this hiatus to record a solo album, &quot;Oh How We Danced&quot;, which proved to be the beginning of a long and successful solo career. The album included a surplus recording from &quot;The Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys&quot;, &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;, and the new tracks featured drummer Roger Hawkins and bassist David Hood, from the Muscle Shoals Sound Studio house band. Capaldi soon brought them on board to replace Grech and Gordon.

The new lineup (Winwood, Capaldi, Wood, Kwaku Baah, Hawkins, Hood) toured America in early 1972 to promote the LP, and their concert at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on 21 February was recorded in multitrack audio and captured on colour videotape with multiple cameras. The 64-minute performance is thought to be the only extended live footage of the group. It was evidently not broadcast on television at the time, but was later released on home video and DVD.

Following Winwood&#x27;s recovery from peritonitis, Traffic&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Shoot Out at the Fantasy Factory&quot;, released in 1973, met with a cold critical reception, but in sales it was another major hit. It was shortly followed by a major world tour, for which Muscle Shoals keyboardist Barry Beckett was added to the lineup. The double live album &quot;On the Road&quot; was drawn from this tour. It broke the band&#x27;s string of British flops by reaching number 40 in the UK Albums Chart. However, after the tour Winwood informed the Muscle Shoals trio that he was returning to a smaller lineup more like their original one, and their services were no longer needed. Meanwhile, Chris Wood&#x27;s problems with drug use and depression were increasing.

Rosko Gee was recruited on bass, while Capaldi switched back to drums. The resulting quintet began to record a new album in late 1973, but Kwaku Baah was fired partway through the sessions, leaving most of the album to be recorded by the quartet of Winwood, Capaldi, Wood, and Gee. &quot;When the Eagle Flies&quot;, released in 1974, was yet another Top Ten album in the US, and moderately successful in the UK. However, a subsequent tour of the US, while successful in terms of ticket sales, was emotionally exhausting for the band. Capaldi later recalled &quot;Rosko Gee and I were the only ones in anything like normal shape. Steve was having recurrent problems with the peritonitis, and Chris&#x27;s body was suffering from chemical warfare.&quot; Winwood ultimately passed his boiling point, walking off the stage in the middle of what turned out to be the band&#x27;s final show, in Chicago. The following day he left the tour without a word to anyone, leaving the rest of the band waiting for him at the venue for that night&#x27;s scheduled performance. Feeling Winwood had been integral to Traffic&#x27;s music, the remaining members opted not to continue the band without him.

Traffic&#x27;s break-up was followed by two compilations from United Artists (&quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; and &quot;More Heavy Traffic&quot;), both of which only drew from the first half of their output.

Steve Winwood embarked on a solo career, while Rosko Gee and Rebop Kwaku Baah joined German band Can. Kwaku Baah died on stage from a cerebral hemorrhage in Stockholm, Sweden in 1983, and Capaldi dedicated his solo album &quot;Fierce Heart&quot; to his memory. Chris Wood also died that year from pneumonia.

===Reunion===

All the still living members of Traffic&#x27;s most recent lineup reunited in 1994 for a one-off tour, after a fan left a voice mail message at Bob Weir&#x27;s (of the Grateful Dead) hotel in Chicago during the 1992 &quot;Scaring the Children&quot; tour, and suggested it would be cool if Traffic toured with the (then Grateful) Dead. Traffic opened for the Grateful Dead during their summer tour. The flute/sax role on the tour was played by Randall Bramblett, who had worked extensively with Steve Winwood. Mike McEvoy joined the line up playing keyboards, guitar and viola, and Walfredo Reyes, Jr. played drums and percussion. Winwood and Capaldi recorded and released a new Traffic album, &quot;Far from Home&quot;, with no involvement from the other four members. It broke the top 40 in both the UK and USA. &quot;The Last Great Traffic Jam&quot;, a double live album and DVD released in 2005, documents the band&#x27;s 1994 reunion tour.

The four original members of Traffic were inducted for their contributions in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 15 March 2004. Winwood, Capaldi, Mason, and Stephanie Wood (standing in for her late brother Chris) all attended the ceremony. Winwood and Capaldi took part in the induction performance, but were joined by Dave Mason performing his song &#x27;Feelin&#x27; Alright&#x27; for the grand finale which also featured Keith Richards, Tom Petty, and the Temptations. The induction lineup was completed by Bramblett on organ and bass pedals, even though he was not one of the members inducted.

Tentative plans for another Traffic project were cut short by Jim Capaldi&#x27;s death from stomach cancer at age 60 in January 2005, ending the songwriting partnership with Winwood that had fueled Traffic from its beginning. Winwood subsequently dedicated &quot;The Last Great Traffic Jam&quot; &quot;to the man without whom Traffic could never be: my lifelong friend and partner, Jim Capaldi.&quot;

&quot;Dear Mr. Fantasy&quot; was a celebration for Capaldi that took place at The Roundhouse in Camden Town, London on 21 January 2007. Guests included Steve Winwood, Paul Weller, Pete Townshend, and many more. &quot;Dear Mr. Fantasy&quot; featured the music of Jim Capaldi and Traffic, and all profits went to The Jubilee Action Street Children Appeal.

<text>Artis Leon Ivey Jr. (August 1, 1963 – September 28, 2022), known by his stage name Coolio, was an American rapper. He was best known for his single &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot; (1995), which won a Grammy Award, and was credited for changing the course of hip hop by bringing it to a wider audience. Other singles included &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; (1994), &quot;1, 2, 3, 4 (Sumpin&#x27; New)&quot; (1996), and &quot;C U When U Get There&quot; (1997). He released nine albums, the first three of which achieved mainstream success: &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot; (1994), &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot; (1995), and &quot;My Soul&quot; (1997). Coolio first achieved recognition as a member of the gangsta rap group WC and the Maad Circle. Coolio sold 4.8 million albums in the U.S. 

He also created the six episode reality television show &quot;Coolio&#x27;s Rules&quot; (2008), the web series &quot;Cookin&#x27; with Coolio&quot;, and published a cookbook.

Coolio died on September 28, 2022, at 59 years old, from an accidental overdose of fentanyl, heroin, and methamphetamine.

==Early life==
Artis Leon Ivey Jr. was born on August 1, 1963, in Monessen, Pennsylvania. His mother was a factory worker who divorced his father, who was a carpenter, and they moved to Compton, California when Ivey was eight years old. Ivey was severely asthmatic and, as a child, he was taken to the hospital several times due to asthma complications. He was a regular visitor to his local library as a boy. He often played board games with his mother. He started rapping as a teenager, earning the nickname Coolio Iglesias due to his slick performances, a takeoff of Spanish singer Julio Iglesias; the nickname was later shortened to Coolio. He was arrested for taking a weapon to school and served prison time for larceny. As Compton went into decline in the 1980s, he became addicted to crack cocaine, but quit drugs after spending time living with his father in San Jose, crediting Christianity for helping him get over his addiction. There, he worked for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Coolio attended Compton Community College then worked in a volunteer fire department and security at Los Angeles International Airport, before becoming a rapper.

==Music career==
Coolio recorded his first single in 1987, titled &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do?&quot;. In 1988, he recorded &quot;What Makes You Dance (Force Groove)&quot; with Nu-Skool. Coolio made connections in the L.A. rap scene, and in 1991, joined the group WC and the Maad Circle, led by rapper WC. He is a credited co-contributor on the group&#x27;s debut album &quot;Ain&#x27;t a Damn Thang Changed&quot;, including on the single &quot;Dress Code&quot;.

===Tommy Boy Records and &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot;===
In 1994, Coolio signed a recording contract with Tommy Boy Records and released his debut solo album &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot;. The lead single &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; received heavy rotation on MTV and peaked at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming one of the biggest rap singles of the year. Other minor hits from the album include &quot;County Line&quot; and &quot;I Remember&quot;. &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot; peaked at No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming certified Platinum. The album received praise for bringing a humorous and lighthearted perspective to the often violent and profane themes of typical gangsta rap.

===&quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot;===
In 1995, for the film &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot;, Coolio released &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot;, featuring R&amp;B singer L.V.. It became one of the most successful rap songs of all time, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for three weeks. It was the No. 1 single of 1995 in the United States for all genres and was a global hit topping the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Austria, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Australia, and New Zealand charts. &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot; was the second-best-selling single of 1995 in the U.K. The song also created a controversy when Coolio claimed that comedy musician &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic had not asked for permission to make his parody of &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot;, titled &quot;Amish Paradise&quot;. At the 1996 Grammy Awards, the song won Coolio a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance.

Originally &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot; was not meant to be included in one of Coolio&#x27;s studio albums, but due to its success, Coolio included it on the album, making it the title track. It interpolates the chorus and music of the song &quot;Pastime Paradise&quot; by Stevie Wonder, which was recorded nearly 20 years earlier on Wonder&#x27;s album &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot;. The album &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot; was released in 1995 and was certified two-times Platinum by the RIAA, selling more than two million copies in the US alone.

The album contains two other major hits in &quot;1, 2, 3, 4 (Sumpin&#x27; New)&quot; and &quot;Too Hot&quot; with J. T. Taylor of Kool &amp; the Gang doing the chorus. Despite no longer being an official member of the group, Coolio appears on the second WC and the Maad Circle album &quot;Curb Servin&#x27;&quot; on the song &quot;In a Twist&quot;. In 1996, Coolio had another top 40 hit with the song &quot;It&#x27;s All the Way Live (Now)&quot; from the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Eddie&quot;. He is also featured on the song &quot;Hit &#x27;em High&quot; from the soundtrack to the 1996 film &quot;Space Jam&quot; with B-Real, Method Man, LL Cool J, and Busta Rhymes.

In 2014, the band Falling in Reverse did a cover of &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot; for &quot;Punk Goes 90s Vol. 2&quot;, with Coolio making a cameo in the music video.

===Red Hot Organization and Tommy Boy Records dismissal===
In 1996, Coolio appeared on the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation CD &quot;America Is Dying Slowly&quot;, alongside Biz Markie, Wu-Tang Clan, and Fat Joe, among many other prominent hip-hop artists. The CD meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African-American men. That same year, he recorded the music video &quot;Aw, Here It Goes!&quot; for the opening sequence of the Nickelodeon television series &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot;, which ran for four seasons.
Coolio&#x27;s third solo album, &quot;My Soul&quot;, came out in 1997. Although it contains the major hit &quot;C U When U Get There&quot; and the album went gold, it failed to reach the success of his previous two albums. Coolio was subsequently dropped from the Tommy Boy Records label. Since then, 2001&#x27;s &quot;Coolio.com&quot;, 2003&#x27;s &quot;El Cool Magnifico&quot;, 2006&#x27;s &quot;The Return of the Gangsta&quot;, and 2008&#x27;s &quot;Steal Hear&quot;, 2009&#x27;s From the Bottom 2 the Top, and 2017&#x27;s &quot;Long Live the Thief&quot; have not charted on any &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. He did have a minor hit in the UK in 2006 with &quot;Gangsta Walk&quot; (featuring Snoop Dogg).

While touring with hip-hop duo Insane Clown Posse, Coolio received a tattoo as a homage to the group&#x27;s fanbase, reading &quot;Jugalo Cool&quot; . He stated that the misspelling was intentional. Coolio performed at the Gathering of the Juggalos.

Coolio is featured on an international collaboration track called &quot;Fuck the DJ&quot; by UK rapper Blacklisted MC, also featuring Bizarre of D12, Adil Omar (from Pakistan), and Uzimon (from Bermuda). The song premiered on music website Noisey from &quot;Vice&quot; in October 2014.

===Television appearances===
In 1996, Coolio made a guest appearance as himself on &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot;.

Coolio appeared in a 1998 episode of &quot;The Nanny,&quot; &quot;Homie-Work&quot;, in which he portrays the nerdy Erwin, a &quot;gift wrapper&quot;, and is transformed by the Jewish nanny into a &quot;Rapper&quot; for Maxwell Sheffield&#x27;s new rap musical.

Coolio appeared in the 15th episode of the fourth season of Charmed, which aired the 14th of march, 2002. He plays the role of a Lazarus Demon.

In 2004, Coolio appeared as a contestant on &quot;Comeback – Die große Chance&quot; (&quot;Comeback: The Big Chance&quot;), a German talent show featuring artists looking for a comeback.

In the television series &quot;Futurama&quot;, Coolio voiced Kwanzaa-bot, a rapping robot who spreads awareness about Kwanzaa. His first appearance was in the 2001 episode &quot;Tale of Two Santas&quot; and his third and final appearance was in the 2023 episode &quot;I Know What You Did Next Xmas&quot;. The latter episode was dedicated to him, as he had recorded his lines for the episode just weeks prior to his death.

In 2009, Coolio appeared as a housemate on &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 6&quot;, which he placed 3rd. He later went to appear on the UK&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate Big Brother&quot; in 2010, where he decided it was best to leave the house after numerous confrontations with Nadia Almada and others there. 

In January 2012, he was one of eight celebrities participating in the Food Network reality television series &quot;Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off&quot;, where he represented the Music Saves Lives Organization. In June of the same year, Coolio voiced a wax figure of himself on &quot;Gravity Falls&quot;. 
par
Coolio was featured on the March 5, 2013, episode of the ABC reality program &quot;Wife Swap&quot;, but his then-girlfriend left him after the program was taped. On June 30, 2013, he appeared alongside comedian Jenny Eclair and &quot;Emmerdale&quot; actor Matthew Wolfenden on the UK game show &quot;Tipping Point: Lucky Stars&quot;, where he came in second. 

Coolio guest starred on a 2014 episode of the Adult Swim show &quot;Black Jesus&quot; titled &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot;. 

In July 2016, Coolio performed on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;.

===Other appearances===
In 2019, Coolio appeared on the Irish rap group Versatile&#x27;s track &quot;Escape Wagon&quot;. He later featured on their 2021 album, &quot;Fuck Versatile&quot;, on the track &quot;Coolio Interlude&quot;.

==Personal life==
Ivey had ten children, one of whom was born to his wife, Josefa Salinas, whom he married in 1996 and divorced in 2000. In March 2022, he told Australia&#x27;s &quot;Today Extra&quot; that he had five grandchildren.

In July 2008, Ivey and jazz saxophonist Jarez were enlisted as spokespersons by the group Environmental Justice and Climate Change to educate students at historically black colleges and universities about climate change. Ivey was a spokesperson for the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, as his children are asthmatic.

He hosted the online cooking show &quot;Cookin&#x27; with Coolio&quot;, an offshoot of his reality show, &quot;Coolio&#x27;s Rules&quot; that ran for six episodes in 2008.

Ivey was the running mate for pornographic film actress Cherie DeVille&#x27;s Democratic presidential run in the 2020 United States presidential election; they ended their campaign in January 2019.

===Legal issues===
In 1998, a court in Böblingen, near Stuttgart, sentenced Ivey to six months probation and fined him $17,000 after convicting him of being an accessory to robbery and causing bodily injury after Ivey and his band members allegedly attempted shoplifting clothing worth $940 and then punched the store owner when he was caught. Ivey alleged that he was promised the clothing for free in exchange for signing autographs.

In 2016, Ivey and members of his crew were arrested for having a loaded firearm inside a bag at Los Angeles International Airport. The bag was flagged by the Transportation Security Administration as the group attempted to pass through a security checkpoint. One of his bodyguards claimed ownership of the bag, but Ivey later admitted that he was the owner and was subsequently sentenced to three years of probation and 45 days of community service.

In 2017, Ivey missed a performance after he was denied entry into Singapore upon landing at Changi International Airport. Singapore&#x27;s Immigration and Checkpoints Authority declined to comment on the reason for the denial, citing reasons of confidentiality. Coolio had been traveling from Beijing to Singapore to perform at a Formula One concert event.

=== The Evolution of Hip-Hop ===
In 2020, just before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ivey was working on a new chapter of his life, creating a big budget Las Vegas show entitled &#x27;The Evolution of Hip-Hop&#x27;. Ivey brought in his former reputation manager and entrepreneur William Moseley of Kingmaker to partner with in this venture. During the pandemic Ivey brought in a team of the top show writers, choreographers, and others to bring his dream to life while Moseley composed, raised awareness, and secured top talent for residency in Vegas. Moseley and Ivey completed the project in 2022. Ivey died soon after the project was completed. The script, choreography, compositions, outline, and behind the scenes video are to be sent to the Moon in 2026 by Quantum Aerospace and SpaceX, aboard the new SpaceX Starship, as a tribute to Ivey.

==Death==
On September 28, 2022, Ivey was discovered unresponsive on the bathroom floor at a friend&#x27;s house in Los Angeles, and was pronounced dead at the scene by first responders. He was 59 years old. The Los Angeles County Coroner&#x27;s office announced that Ivey died from an accidental overdose of fentanyl, heroin, and methamphetamine, with cardiomyopathy, chronic asthma, and cigarette smoking having played a role in his death. He was cremated in a private ceremony, with a portion of his ashes encased in jewelry for his family and the rest put into an urn.

<text>The Sknyliv air show disaster occurred on 27 July 2002, when a Ukrainian Air Force Sukhoi Su-27UB aircraft, piloted by Volodymyr Toponar (of the Ukrainian Falcons) and co-piloted by Yuriy Yegorov, crashed into spectators during an aerobatics presentation at Sknyliv airfield near Lviv, Ukraine. The accident killed 77 people and injured 543. It is the deadliest air show accident in history.

== Crash ==
More than 10,000 spectators attended the air show, staged to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Ukrainian Air Force&#x27;s 14th Air Corps. The Su-27 aircraft was flown by two experienced pilots; it entered a rolling maneuver at 12:52 p.m. with a downward trajectory at low altitude. It rolled upright once more and was still descending rapidly when the left wing dropped shortly before it hit the ground, at which point the crew initiated ejection. The aircraft flattened out initially, before skidding over the ground towards stationary aircraft and striking a glancing blow against the nose of an Ilyushin Il-76, at which point the jet exploded and cartwheeled into the crowd of spectators.

Both pilots survived with minor injuries, while 77 spectators were killed, including 28 children. Another 100 were hospitalized for head injuries, burns, and bone fractures. Other injuries were less severe and did not require hospitalization. A total of 543 people were injured in the accident. Some bystanders suffered serious mental disorders from what they saw.

Following the disaster, the pilots stated that the flight map which they had received differed from the actual layout. On the cockpit voice recorder, one pilot asks, &quot;And where are our spectators?&quot;. Others have suggested that the pilots were slow to react to automated warnings issued by the flight computer.

== Aftermath ==
On August 7, an investigation conducted by Yevhen Marchuk, the National Security and Defense Secretary, concluded with the pilots receiving a majority of the blame. In a statement, Marchuk accused Toponar and Yegorov of failing &quot;to respect the flight plan and aerial maneuvers&quot;. Marchuk also attributed some blame toward the event organizers and scrutinized them for allowing dangerous stunts to be performed in close proximity to spectators. Toponar rejected Marchuk&#x27;s findings and claimed that technical issues and a faulty flight plan was what led to the crash. Prior to the incident, he had requested an additional training flight at the airfield where the display was to be performed, but the request was denied.

Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma publicly blamed the military for the disaster and dismissed the head of the air force, General Viktor Strelnykov. Minister of Defense Volodymyr Shkidchenko offered his resignation, but Kuchma rejected it.

=== Prosecution ===
On 24 June 2005, a military court sentenced pilot Volodymyr Toponar and co-pilot Yuriy Yegorov to fourteen and eight years in prison, respectively. The court found the two pilots and three other military officials guilty of failing to follow orders, negligence, and violating flight rules. Two of the three officials were sentenced to up to six years in prison; the third received up to four years. Toponar was ordered to pay ₴7.2 million (US$1.42 million; €1.18 million) in compensation to the families, and Yegorov ₴2.5 million. The crew&#x27;s main flight trainer was acquitted for lack of evidence. 

After the verdict was announced, Toponar said that he planned to appeal, insisting that the crash was due to technical problems and a faulty flight plan. Yegorov was released in 2008 after President Viktor Yushchenko issued a decree reducing his sentence to three and a half years.

Near the end of his prison term, Toponar reasserted his innocence in a phone interview. &quot;From the mission briefing it is obvious that the flight area parameters we were given significantly exceeded the safe margin of separation from spectators. What happened is the fault of organizers. Planes must not fly over spectators. During the show, I had to make several advanced maneuvers in a few minutes. During the half-barrel, I noticed decreased thrust of both engines and the airspeed fell. But the cause remains unknown! Ground control ordered us to continue the flight. During the last maneuver—an oblique loop with a turn—the plane became uncontrollable. During the trial they said it was caused by pilot error due to inexperience. I have 27 years in the cockpit with 2,000 hours flying time. I was a member of the Ukrainian Falcons… To the last I struggled to lift the plane, [but] copilot Yuriy Yegorov hit the catapult [triggering ejection] and we two ejected with our seats.&quot;

== In popular culture ==
* The disaster forms the backdrop of an episode in Victoria Amelina&#x27;s &quot;Дім для Дома&quot;. The main characters of the novel (one of whom is a retired Soviet military pilot) attend the air show and witness the disaster, but none of them is injured.

<doc id="168267" wikidata="Q711892" url="?curid=168267" title="David Allan Coe">
<text>David Allan Coe (born September 6, 1939) is an American singer and songwriter. Coe took up music after spending much of his early life in reform schools and prisons, and first became notable for busking in Nashville. He initially played mostly in the blues style, before transitioning to country music, becoming a major part of the 1970s outlaw country scene. His biggest hits include &quot;You Never Even Called Me by My Name&quot;, &quot;Longhaired Redneck&quot;, &quot;The Ride&quot;, &quot;Mona Lisa Lost Her Smile&quot;, and &quot;She Used to Love Me a Lot&quot;.

His most popular songs performed by others are the number-one hits &quot;Would You Lay With Me (In a Field of Stone)&quot; sung by Tanya Tucker and Johnny Paycheck&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Take This Job and Shove It&quot;. The latter inspired the movie of the same name. Coe&#x27;s rebellious attitude, wild image, and unconventional lifestyle set him apart from other country performers, both winning him legions of fans and hindering his mainstream success by alienating the music industry establishment. Coe continues to be a popular performer on the country music circuit.

== Biography ==
Coe was born in Akron, Ohio, on September 6, 1939. His favorite singer as a child was Johnny Ace. After being sent to the Starr Commonwealth For Boys reform school at the age of nine, he spent much of the next two decades in correctional facilities, including three years at the Ohio Penitentiary. Coe said he received encouragement to begin writing songs from Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins, with whom he had spent time in prison.

After concluding another prison term in 1967, Coe embarked on a music career in Nashville, living in a hearse which he parked in front of the Ryman Auditorium while he performed on the street. He caught the attention of Shelby Singleton, owner of the independent record label Plantation Records and signed a contract with his label. Coe is a retired member of the Louisville, Kentucky, chapter of the Outlaws Motorcycle Club.

He is the father of Tyler Mahan Coe, the creator of the &quot;Cocaine &amp; Rhinestones&quot; podcast, which chronicles the history of country music. He has four children (Tyler, Tanya, Shyanne and Carson) with Jody Lynn Coe. 

According to news sources, in 2007 he owed over $300,000 in child support.

== Music career ==

=== Early career (1970–1975) ===

Early in 1970, Coe released his debut album, &quot;Penitentiary Blues&quot;, followed by a tour with Grand Funk Railroad. In October 1971, he signed as an exclusive writer with Pete and Rose Drake&#x27;s publishing company Windows Publishing Company, Inc. in Nashville, Tennessee, where he remained until 1977. Although he developed a cult following with his performances, he was not able to develop any mainstream success, but other performers achieved charting success by recording songs Coe had written, including Billie Jo Spears&#x27; 1972 recordings &quot;Souvenirs &amp; California Mem&#x27;rys&quot; and Tanya Tucker&#x27;s 1973 single &quot;Would You Lay With Me (In a Field of Stone)&quot;, which was a No. 1 hit and responsible for Coe becoming one of Nashville&#x27;s hottest songwriters and Coe himself being signed by Columbia Records. Coe recorded his own version of the song for his second Columbia album, &quot;Once Upon a Rhyme&quot;, released in 1975. AllMusic writer Thom Jurek said of the song, &quot;The amazing thing is that both versions are definitive.&quot;

Unlike Coe&#x27;s first two albums, his third showed full commitment to country music, and Coe would play a part in the evolution of what would become known as outlaw country. The title of Coe&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy&quot;, refers to the gimmick Coe adopted several years before Glen Campbell had a hit with the song &quot;Rhinestone Cowboy&quot;: dressing up in a rhinestone suit and wearing a Lone Ranger mask. The singer later recalled to Michael Buffalo Smith in 2004, &quot;I guess I have to blame it on Mel Tillis. I met him when I first went to Nashville and he had an office down on Music Row. I was over there talking to him in his office, and he opened up the closet to get something and he had a whole closet full of rhinestone suits. I just freaked out on that. He looked at me and said &#x27;You like that shit, I don&#x27;t even wear those, if you want &#x27;em take &#x27;em!&#x27; He gave me those rhinestone suits and I wore them everywhere.&quot; Coe maintained the idea for the mask came from his father:

Coe&#x27;s second album &quot;Once Upon a Rhyme&quot; contains one of his biggest hits, &quot;You Never Even Called Me by My Name&quot;, written by Steve Goodman and John Prine and which first appeared on Goodman&#x27;s 1971 debut release. Coe&#x27;s version became his first country Top 10 hit single, peaking at No. 8 in 1975, and includes a spoken epilogue where Coe relates a correspondence he had with Goodman, who stated the song he had written was the &#x27;perfect country and western song&#x27;. Coe wrote back stating that no song could fit that description without mentioning a laundry list of clichés: &quot;mama, or trains, or trucks, or prison, or getting drunk&quot;. Goodman&#x27;s equally facetious response was an additional verse that incorporated all five of Coe&#x27;s requirements, and upon receiving it, Coe acknowledged that the finished product was indeed the &#x27;perfect country and western song&#x27; and included the last verse on the record:

Well, I was drunk the day my mom got out of prisonAnd I went to pick &#x27;er up in the rainBut before I could get to the station in my pickup truckShe got runned over by a damned ol&#x27; train

Coe was a featured performer in &quot;Heartworn Highways&quot;, a 1975 documentary film by James Szalapski. Other performers featured included Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt, Rodney Crowell, Steve Young, Steve Earle, and the Charlie Daniels Band. Coe also wrote &quot;Cocaine Carolina&quot; for Johnny Cash and sang background vocals on the recording that appeared on Cash&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;John R. Cash&quot;.

=== Outlaw years (1976–1982) ===

By 1976, the outlaw country movement was in full swing as artists such as Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson were finally enjoying massive commercial success after years of fighting to record their music their own way. Coe, however, was still somewhat an outsider, almost too outlaw for the outlaws, a predicament summed up well by AllMusic:

&quot;Longhaired Redneck&quot; was Coe&#x27;s third album for Columbia in three years, and the first where he wrote or co-wrote all the songs; the outlaw country zeitgeist was summed up well in the title track, which recounts playing in a dive &quot;where bikers stare at cowboys who are laughing at the hippies who are praying they&#x27;ll get out of here alive&quot;. The song features Coe impersonating the vocal styles of Ernest Tubb, Bill Anderson, and Merle Haggard. About the term &quot;Longhaired Redneck&quot;, Coe later said, &quot;It was terminology that I&#x27;d made up at the time. I was trying to tell people that not everybody with long hair was a hippie. Not everyone was the kind of person that thought you could punch them out, take their money and that they&#x27;d say, &#x27;I won&#x27;t do nothin&#x27; about it&#x27;.&quot;

By 1977, the outlaw movement was nearing its apex, having seen the release of Willie Nelson&#x27;s blockbuster album &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot; and country music&#x27;s first platinum selling album, &quot;Wanted! The Outlaws&quot;. Coe considered himself as integral as anyone in the evolution of the outlaw country genre, and began saying so in his music. As noted in AllMusic&#x27;s review of the album, &quot;On &quot;Rides Again&quot;, by trying to make a conscious outlaw record and aligning himself with the movement&#x27;s two progenitors on the opening track, &quot;Willie, Waylon, and Me&quot;...Coe already set up self-parody unintentionally – something that continued to curse him.&quot; The songs on &quot;Rides Again&quot; cross-fade without the usual silences between tracks, which was unusual for country music, and feature Coe&#x27;s heavily phased guitar. Coe was also permitted to use his own band on several tracks, a major concession for Columbia at the time. However, some of his peers resented Coe placing himself in such exalted company, and felt he was exploiting his relationship with his fellow outlaws. Jennings&#x27; drummer Richie Albright called Coe &quot;a great, great songwriter. A great singer. But he could not tell the truth if it was better than a lie he&#x27;d made up. Waylon didn&#x27;t make him comfortable enough to hang around. But Willie did. I was around Willie quite a bit and David Allan was with him eighty percent of the time. Willie allowed him to hang around.&quot; Coe managed to maintain friendships with both Jennings and Nelson, despite the former&#x27;s cool treatment of him at times. In his autobiography, Jennings mentions Coe once (in a chapter titled &quot;The Outlaw Shit&quot;), calling him &quot;the most sincere of the bunch&quot; of bandwagon jumpers, but contends &quot;when it came to being an Outlaw, the worst thing he ever did was double-parking on Music Row&quot;, adding:

Throughout the rest of the decade, Coe released a string of strong recordings, some of which, such as &quot;Human Emotions&quot; (1978) and &quot;Spectrum VII&quot; (1979), were concept albums with each side of the discs given their own theme. 1978&#x27;s &quot;Family Album&quot; contains Coe&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Take This Job and Shove It&quot;, a song he composed and which had been released by Johnny Paycheck in October 1977, becoming a monumental success. The song is a first person account of a man who has worked for fifteen years with no apparent reward, and it struck a chord with the public, even inspiring a 1981 film of the same name. Although Coe&#x27;s name was credited, the assumption by many was that Paycheck, an acclaimed songwriter himself, composed the tune; this would feed into Coe&#x27;s growing bitterness with the industry as another one of his peers exploded in popularity. Coe was further disenchanted when pop star Jimmy Buffett accused him of plagiarising his hit &quot;Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes&quot; for Coe&#x27;s &quot;Divers Do It Deeper&quot;. (Coe had been incorporating Caribbean sounds into his music, as is evident on his 1979 album &quot;Compass Point&quot;.) By 1980, Coe and producer Billy Sherrill set out to reach a wider audience and bring Coe back to the charts by inviting other singers and musicians to take part in the sessions for what would become &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Something to Say&quot;, which would boast contributions from Guy Clark, Bill Anderson, Dickey Betts (from The Allman Brothers Band), Kris Kristofferson, Larry Jon Wilson, and George Jones. This process was continued the following year on &quot;Invictus (Means) Unconquered&quot;, with Sherrill couching the songs in tasteful instrumentation that put the spotlight squarely on Coe&#x27;s voice. (In his AllMusic review, Thom Jurek labelled it &#x27;arguably the finest album of his career&#x27;)

By 1981, the outlaw country movement waned as the slicker &#x27;urban cowboy&#x27; era took hold in country music, typified by the Johnny Lee hit &quot;Lookin&#x27; for Love&quot;, which critic Kurt Wolff panned as an example of &#x27;watered-down cowboy music&#x27;. Coe was an important figure in the outlaw country genre, but judging by the sound of his recordings from this period, he had no interest in the trendy urban cowboy phase. Refusing to give into the flavor-of-the-month generic country &#x27;talent&#x27;, Coe stuck to what he knew and sharpened the edges. However, while scoring some moderate hits, mainstream success remained elusive. Coe&#x27;s highest- charting single during this period was &quot;Get a Little Dirt on Your Hands&quot;, a duet with Bill Anderson, which peaked at No. 45. As if aware of the compromises he had been making, Coe chose to close out his 1982 album &quot;D.A.C.&quot; with a suite of three songs that contained a short prologue:

=== Commercial success (1983–1989) ===
&quot;Castles in the Sand&quot; would be a huge comeback for Coe, peaking at No. 8 on the country albums chart, his highest showing since &quot;Once Upon a Rhyme&quot; hit the same mark eight years earlier. Its success was spurred on by &quot;The Ride&quot;, which was released in February 1983 as the lead single from the album and reached No. 1 on the June 4 &quot;Cashbox&quot; Country Singles Chart. It spent 19 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles charts, reaching a peak of No. 4 and hitting No. 2 on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; Country Tracks chart. The ballad tells the first-person story of a hitchhiker&#x27;s encounter with the ghost of Hank Williams, Sr. in a ride from Montgomery, Alabama, to Nashville, Tennessee. The mysterious driver, &#x27;dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow-eyed&#x27;, questions the narrator whether he has the musical talent and dedication to become a star in the country music industry. The song&#x27;s lyrics place the events on U.S. Route 31 or the largely parallel Interstate 65. Buoyed by the single, &quot;Castles in the Sand&quot; became the mainstream breakthrough that Coe and producer Billy Sherrill had been trying for since the decade began. 1984&#x27;s &quot;Just Divorced&quot; contains Coe&#x27;s second biggest chart hit, &quot;Mona Lisa Lost Her Smile&quot;, which rose to No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles chart and No. 3 on &quot;Cashbox&quot;. In Canada, it reached No. 1 on the &quot;RPM&quot; Country Tracks charts dated for June 30, 1984. The song is a mid-tempo ballad about a young blonde girl, featuring allusions to the iconic Da Vinci painting. The song features one of producer Billy Sherrill&#x27;s most elaborate productions, with one critic commenting, &#x27;The layered strings and organ work are slick, but they add such warmth and depth in contrast to Coe&#x27;s voice that it works to devastating effect.&#x27; Another track, &quot;Missin&#x27; the Kid&quot;, finds a father lamenting the loss of his daughter, who now lives with his estranged ex-wife. Over a languid beat and using simple language, Coe delivers a stunning vocal that expresses with weary resignation the bitterness, guilt, and extreme sadness that comes with a broken family. Beginning with the line, &quot;I still can&#x27;t believe after all of these years I still miss you,&#x27; the narrator wonders what his wife will tell their daughter when she asks about him, and finally declares:

:I tell myself that it&#x27;s best if I don&#x27;t try to see her
:Seeing her now could not make up for all she&#x27;s been through
:Watching two people she once called her mother and father
:Acting like strangers, that&#x27;s something I just could not do

In his AllMusic review of the album, writer Thom Jurek writes:

&quot;She Used to Love Me a Lot&quot;, was released in December 1984 and peaked at No. 11 on both the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles chart and the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; Country Tracks chart. (A version of the song by Johnny Cash was recorded in the early 1980s, but remained unreleased until 2014.) The song tells of a chance meeting between two ex-lovers at &#x27;the Silver Spoon Café&#x27;, but when the man tries to rekindle the romance, she dismisses him in the same cavalier way he did her years earlier. It was written by Dennis Morgan, Charles Quillen, and Kye Fleming, as Coe - who continued to write songs of high quality - nonetheless relied on outside writers to get him in the charts. The 1986 album &quot;Son of the South&quot; would include contributions from fellow outlaw legends Nelson, Jennings, and Jessi Colter. His final recording for Columbia, the concept album &quot;A Matter of Life…and Death&quot;, was released in 1987.

=== Later career (1990–present) ===
In 1990, Coe reissued his independent albums &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot; and &quot;Underground Album&quot; on compact disc, as well as the compilation &quot;18 X-Rated Hits&quot;. Throughout the 1990s, Coe had a successful career as a concert performer in the United States and Europe. In 1999, Coe met Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell in Fort Worth, Texas, and the two musicians, struck by the similarity of the approaches between country and heavy metal, agreed to work together, and began production on an album. 

In 2000, Coe toured as the opening act for Kid Rock. That same year, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article by journalist Neil Strauss, who described the material on &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot; and &quot;Underground Album&quot; as &quot;among the most racist, misogynist, homophobic, and obscene songs recorded by a popular songwriter&quot;. Coe maintains that he wrote to Strauss during the writing of the article, but the journalist did not acknowledge any interaction between the two, only stating that Coe&#x27;s manager refused to speak on the record. Coe denied accusations of racism, stating that the songs in question were intended as ribald satire inspired by his friendship with Shel Silverstein, and furthermore noting that the drummer in his band in 2000 was a black man.

In 2003, Coe wrote a song for Kid Rock, &quot;Single Father&quot;, which appeared on Kid Rock&#x27;s self-titled album, and was released as a single, which peaked at number 50 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Singles chart. &quot;Rebel Meets Rebel&quot;, with Dimebag Darrell, Vinnie Paul, and Rex Brown, recorded sporadically between 1999 and 2003, was released in 2006, two years after Darrell&#x27;s murder. AllMusic described it as a &quot;groundbreaking&quot; country metal album.

In the 2006 video &quot;God&#x27;s Gonna Cut You Down&quot;, Coe introduces Johnny Cash as the Man in Black. The video, directed by Tony Kaye, was released in connection with Cash&#x27;s cover of the song in &quot;American V: A Hundred Highways&quot;.

In 2017, he was featured singing &quot;Take This Job&quot; on the album &quot;Baptized in Bourbon&quot; by the Moonshine Bandits. He also sings in the video.

=== Outlaw origins ===

Coe&#x27;s integrity was called into question after his previous claim that he had spent time on death row for killing an inmate who tried to rape him was debunked when a Texas documentarian discovered Coe had done time for possessing burglary tools and indecent materials – but never murder. Criticisms such as these notwithstanding, Coe always maintained he was integral to the outlaw country movement getting its name, stating in 2003:

 Coe was uncompromising when it came to his lifestyle and language, even though it kept him off country playlists and award shows. For example, &quot;The House We&#x27;ve Been Calling Home&quot;, from the 1977 album &quot;Rides Again&quot;, explores the theme of polygamy (&#x27;me and my wives have been spending our lives in a house we&#x27;ve been calling a home...&#x27;), while on the final cut on the album, &quot;If That Ain&#x27;t Country (I&#x27;ll Kiss Your Ass)&quot;, Coe utters a racial slur on record for the first time, singing the line &#x27;workin&#x27; like a nigger for my room and board&#x27;. The song paints a picture of a Texas family that verges on caricature, with the narrator describing his tattooed father as &#x27;veteran proud&#x27; and deeming his oldest sister &#x27;a first-rate whore&#x27;. The song further alienated Coe from the country mainstream and kick-started accusations that he was a racist, a charge he always vehemently denied. In 2004 he remarked:

The cover of the 1986 release &quot;Son of the South&quot;, which displayed Coe holding a baby with a Confederate flag draped over his shoulders, galled many industry insiders, although Coe did print a message on the back of the album to defuse any potential backlash:

In another interview, Coe said, &quot;Anyone that would look at me and say I was a racist, would have to be out of their mind. I have dreadlocks down to my waist with earrings in both ears and my beard is down to my waist and it is in braids...I was in prison with 87% black people, I hung around with black people, and I learned to sing music with black people. It was ironic that in prison the white guys called me a &#x27;nigger lover&#x27; and now I write the word &#x27;nigger&#x27; in a song and I am all of a sudden a racist. It is pretty ironic.&quot;

=== Underground albums ===

While Coe lived in Key West, Shel Silverstein played his comedy album &quot;Freakin&#x27; at the Freakers Ball&quot; for Coe, spurring him to perform his own comedic songs for Silverstein, who encouraged Coe to record them, leading to the production of the independently released &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot;. Jimmy Buffett accused Coe of plagiarizing the melody of &quot;Divers Do It Deeper&quot; from Buffett&#x27;s &quot;Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes&quot;, stating, &quot;I would have sued him, but I didn&#x27;t want to give Coe the pleasure of having his name in the paper.&quot; In response to the success of Buffett&#x27;s song, Coe wrote a song insulting Buffett, and it appeared on &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot;. The album was released by mail order in 1978, through the back pages of the biker magazine &quot;Easyriders&quot;.

Coe&#x27;s 1979 Columbia album &quot;Spectrum VII&quot; contained a note stating &quot;Jimmy Buffett does not live in Key West anymore&quot;, a lyric from a song from &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot;. The album&#x27;s songs are profane, often sexually explicit, and describe an orgy in Nashville&#x27;s Centennial Park and sex with pornographic film star Linda Lovelace. The album also contains a song targeting Anita Bryant, a musician notable for her strong opposition to LGBT rights, specifically her fight to repeal an LGBT anti-discrimination ordinance in Miami-Dade County. In the song, bluntly titled &quot;Fuck Aneta Briant&quot; , Coe calls out Bryant as being hypocritical for her opposition to the lifestyles of gay people, stating that &quot;In fact Anita Bryant, some act just like you&quot;.

In 1982, Coe released another independent album, &quot;Underground Album&quot;, which contained his most controversial song, &quot;Nigger Fucker&quot;. Written from the perspective of a man whose lover left him for an African American man, the sexually explicit song resulted in Coe being accused of racism. Primarily because of this song, the material recorded by singer and white supremacist Johnny Rebel has also been mistakenly attributed to Coe. AllMusic, which did not review &quot;Underground Album&quot;, gave it three out of five stars. Coe responded to the accusations by saying &quot;Anyone that hears this album and says I&#x27;m a racist, is full of shit.&quot; Coe&#x27;s drummer, Kerry Brown, is black and married to a white woman. Brown is the son of legendary blues musician Clarence &quot;Gatemouth&quot; Brown. When asked about Coe&#x27;s X-rated albums, Brown stated &quot;David Allan Coe was controversial. Some of the songs are really out there. But it&#x27;s my life. When you live in the David Allan Coe world, you learn to be controversial.&quot;

=== Bankruptcy ===

Like Willie Nelson and Jerry Lee Lewis, Coe has battled the IRS costing him the publishing rights to his compositions, including &quot;Take This Job and Shove It&quot;. He stated in 2003:

In another interview, Coe added, &quot;All the songs on the X-rated albums were sold. I don&#x27;t own that stuff anymore. I have nothing to do with that stuff. They have to give me credit as the songwriter, but I don&#x27;t make one cent.&quot;

==Musical style==

Coe&#x27;s musical style derives from blues, rock, and country music traditions. His vocal style is described as a &#x27;throaty baritone&#x27;. His lyrical content is often humorous or comedic, with William Ruhlmann describing him as a &#x27;near-parody of a country singer&#x27;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes Coe as &quot;a great, unashamed country singer, singing the purest honky-tonk and hardest country of his era […] he may not be the most original outlaw, but there is none more outlaw than him&quot;.

Coe&#x27;s lyrics frequently include references to alcohol and drug use, and are often boisterous and cocky. Coe&#x27;s debut album &quot;Penitentiary Blues&quot; was described as &quot;voodoo blues&quot; and &quot;redneck music&quot; by Allmusic&#x27;s Thom Jurek. It focused on themes such as working for the first time, blood tests from veins used to inject heroin, prison time, hoodoo imagery, and death. The album&#x27;s influences included Charlie Rich, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bo Diddley, Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins, and Tony Joe White. Coe later explained to Kristofer Engelhardt of &quot;Review&quot;: &quot;I didn&#x27;t really care for some of the country music until people like Kris Kristofferson and some of those people started writing songs. They had a little more to say than just, &#x27;Oh baby I miss you&#x27;, or whatever. I don&#x27;t do anything halfway. Once I got into country music, I went back and researched it, and learned everything there was to know about it. I could do impersonations of Roy Acuff, Ernest Tubb, Hank Snow, Marty Robbins, just about anybody. I knew just about all there was to know about country music.&quot;

Coe&#x27;s first country album, &quot;The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy&quot;, has been described as alt-country, &#x27;pre-punk&#x27; and &quot;a hillbilly version of Marc Bolan&#x27;s glitz and glitter&quot;. Credited influences on the album include Merle Haggard. In his early career, Coe was known for his unpredictable live performances, in which he would ride a Harley-Davidson motorcycle onto the stage and curse at his audience. Coe has also performed in a rhinestone suit and a mask which resembled that of the Lone Ranger, calling himself the &#x27;Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy&#x27;.

Despite accusations of racism for the content of some of his song lyrics, Coe&#x27;s psychedelic concept album &quot;Requiem for a Harlequin&quot; (1970), saw Coe &quot;honoring the birth of soul music, ranting against the KKK, and commiserating with other children of the &#x27;concrete jungle&#x27;&quot; in what &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot; described as &quot;Coe&#x27;s Black Panther audition tape&quot; and a &quot;stab at radical chic&quot;, and his later album &quot;Rebel Meets Rebel&quot; featured a song, &quot;Cherokee Cry&quot;, which criticizes the United States government&#x27;s treatment of Native Americans. When asked why he did not write more political songs, Coe replied, &quot;I live in my own world, not &quot;thee&quot; world. I just write songs about what affects me in everyday life. At one point I wrote a song that was sort of a protest about when they were talking about drafting women into the military. It was about my son making it past the draft, but my daughter didn&#x27;t. And I&#x27;ve done Farm Aid.&quot;

In his review of Coe&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;A Matter of Life...and Death&quot;, Allmusic&#x27;s Thom Jurek wrote, &quot;Coe may have had some hits, but it is records like this that make one wonder if there was not a conspiracy to marginalize him and make him fail. Coe is a brilliant songwriter well into the 21st century, and deserves to be lauded along with the likes of [Willie] Nelson and [Waylon] Jennings and Kristofferson and Newbury – and even Cash.&quot;

<text>The General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, also known as the Dayton Agreement or the Dayton Accords (), and colloquially known as the Dayton (, , ) in ex-Yugoslav parlance, is the peace agreement reached at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, United States, finalised on 21 November 1995, and formally signed in Paris, on 14 December 1995. These accords put an end to the three-and-a-half-year-long Bosnian War, which was part of the much larger Yugoslav Wars. 

The warring parties agreed to peace and to a single sovereign state known as Bosnia and Herzegovina composed of two parts, the largely Serb-populated Republika Srpska and mainly Croat-Bosniak-populated Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The agreement has been criticized for creating ineffective and unwieldy political structures and entrenching the ethnic cleansing of the previous war.

==Negotiation and signature ==

Though basic elements of the Dayton Agreement were proposed in international talks as early as 1992, these negotiations were initiated following the unsuccessful previous peace efforts and arrangements, the August 1995 Croatian military Operation Storm and its aftermath, the government military offensive against the Republika Srpska, conducted in parallel with NATO&#x27;s Operation Deliberate Force. During September and October 1995, world powers (especially the United States and Russia), gathered in the Contact Group, pressured the leaders of the three sides to attend settlement negotiations; Dayton, Ohio was eventually chosen as the venue.

Talks began with an outline of key points presented by the US in a team led by National Security Adviser Anthony Lake in visits to London, Bonn, Paris and other European stops 10 – 14 August 1995. These included Sochi, to consult Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev. Lake&#x27;s team handed off to a separate US inter-agency group led by Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke, who went on to negotiate with Balkan leaders in their capitals. The Holbrooke crew conducted five rounds of intense shuttle diplomacy from August to October, including short conferences in Geneva and New York that resulted in the parties&#x27; adoption of principles for a settlement on 8 and 26 September respectively.

The Dayton conference took place from 1–21 November 1995. The main participants from the region were the President of the Republic of Serbia Slobodan Milošević (whom the Bosnian Serbs had previously empowered to represent their interests), President of Croatia Franjo Tuđman, and President of Bosnia and Herzegovina Alija Izetbegović with his Foreign Minister Muhamed Šaćirbeg.

The peace conference was led by US Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and negotiator Richard Holbrooke with two co-chairmen in the form of EU Special Representative Carl Bildt and the First Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Igor Ivanov. A key participant in the US delegation was General Wesley Clark. The head of the UK&#x27;s team was Pauline Neville-Jones, political director of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The UK military representative was Col Arundell David Leakey. Paul Williams, through the Public International Law &amp; Policy Group (PILPG) served as legal counsel to the Bosnian Government delegation during the negotiations.

Holbrooke spoke of the &quot;immense difficulty of engaging the Bosnian government in a serious negotiation&quot;.

The secure site was chosen in order to remove all the parties from their comfort zone, without which they would have little incentive to negotiate; to reduce their ability to negotiate through the media; and to securely house over 800 staff and attendants. Curbing the participants&#x27; ability to negotiate via the media was a particularly important consideration. Holbrooke wanted to prevent posturing through early leaks to the press.

After having been initialed in Dayton, Ohio, on 21 November 1995, the full and formal agreement was signed in Paris on 14 December 1995 and witnessed by Spanish Prime Minister Felipe González, French President Jacques Chirac, US President Bill Clinton, UK Prime Minister John Major, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.

==Content==
The agreement&#x27;s main purpose is to promote peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to endorse regional balance in and around the former Yugoslavia (Article V, annex 1-B).

The present political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its structure of government were agreed upon (Annex 4). A key component of this was the delineation of the Inter-Entity Boundary Line to which many of the tasks listed in the Annexes referred.

The State of Bosnia Herzegovina is composed of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and of the Republika Srpska. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a complete state, as opposed to a confederation; no entity or entities could ever be separated from Bosnia and Herzegovina unless by due legal process. Although highly decentralised in its entities, it would still retain a central government, with a rotating State Presidency, a central bank and a constitutional court.

The agreement mandated a wide range of international organizations to monitor, oversee and implement components of the agreement. The NATO-led IFOR (Implementation Force) was responsible for implementing military aspects of the agreement and deployed on 20 December 1995, taking over the forces of the UNPROFOR. The Office of the High Representative was charged with the task of civil implementation. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe was charged with organising the first free elections in 1996.

===Constitutional Court decision===

On 13 October 1997, the Croatian 1861 Law Party and the Bosnia-Herzegovina 1861 Law Party requested the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina to annul several decisions and to confirm one decision of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and, more importantly, to review the constitutionality of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina since it was alleged that the agreement violated the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina in a way that it undermined the integrity of the state and could cause the dissolution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Court reached the conclusion that it is not competent to decide the dispute in regards to the mentioned decisions since the applicants were not subjects that were identified in Article VI.3 (a) of the Constitution on those who can refer disputes to the Court. The Court also rejected the other request:

It was one of the early cases in which the Court had to deal with the question of the legal nature of the Constitution. By making the remark in the manner of &quot;obiter dictum&quot; concerning the Annex IV (the Constitution) and the rest of the peace agreement, the Court actually &quot;established the ground for &quot;legal unity&quot;&quot; of the entire peace agreement, which further implied that all of the annexes are in the hierarchical equality. In later decisions the Court confirmed that by using other annexes of the peace agreement as a direct base for the analysis, not only in the context of systematic interpretation of the Annex IV. However, since the Court rejected the presented request of the appellants, it did not go into details concerning the controversial questions of the legality of the process in which the new Constitution (Annex IV) came to power and replaced the former Constitution of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Court used the same reasoning to dismiss the similar claim in a later case.

==Territorial changes==


Before the agreement, Bosnian Serbs controlled about 46% of Bosnia and Herzegovina (23,687 km2), Bosniaks 28% (14,505 km2) and Bosnian Croats 25% (12,937 km2).

Bosnian Serbs got large tracts of mountainous territories back (4% from Bosnian Croats and some small amounts from Bosniaks), but they had to surrender Sarajevo and some vital Eastern Bosnian/Herzegovian positions. Their percentage grew to 49% (48% by excluding the Brčko District, 24,526 km2).

Bosniaks got most of Sarajevo and some important positions in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina while they lost only a few locations on Mount Ozren and in western Bosnia. Their percentage grew to 30%, and they greatly improved the quality of the land. Large tracts of prewar Bosniak (and Bosnian Croat) inhabited lands remained under Bosnian Serb control.

Bosnian Croats gave most (4% of BiH territories) back to the Bosnian Serbs (9% of today&#x27;s RS) and also retreated from Una-Sana Donji Vakuf (in Central Bosnia) afterward. A small enlargement of Posavina (Odžak and parts of Domaljevac) did not change the fact that after Dayton Bosnian Croats controlled just 21% of Bosnia and Herzegovina (10,640 km2), compared to more than 25% prior to Dayton. One of the most important Bosnian Croat territories (Posavina with Bosanski Brod, Bosanski Šamac, Derventa) was left out of Bosnian Croat control.

===Control of Republika Srpska===
*About 89.5% (22,059 km2) was under control of Bosnian Serbs
*About 9% (2,117 km2) of today&#x27;s territories of Republika Srpska was controlled by Bosnian Croat forces; mainly in municipalities of Šipovo, Petrovac, Istočni Drvar, Jezero, Kupres (RS) and part of Banja Luka municipality
*About 1.5% (350 km2) of today&#x27;s territories of Republika Srpska was controlled by Bosniak forces, mainly some villages in Ozren (Doboj and Petrovo), western Bosnia (Krupa na Uni and parts of Novi Grad and Oštra Luka).

===Control of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina===
*About 53% (13,955 km2) of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was under Bosniak control.
*About 41% (10,720 km2) of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was under the control of Bosnian Croats.
*About 6% (1,435 km2) was under control of Bosnian Serbs.

==Appraisals==
The immediate purpose of the agreement was to freeze the military confrontation and prevent it from resuming. It was therefore defined as a &quot;construction of necessity&quot;.

The Dayton Agreement was aimed at allowing Bosnia and Herzegovina to move from an early post-conflict phase through reconstruction and consolidation, adopting a consociational power-sharing approach. Scholars such as Canadian professor Charles-Philippe David calls Dayton &quot;the most impressive example of conflict resolution&quot;. American scholar Howard M. Hensel states that &quot;Dayton represents an example of a conflict resolution negotiation that was successful. However, Patrice C. McMahon and Jon Western write that &quot;As successful as Dayton was at ending the violence, it also sowed the seeds of instability by creating a decentralized political system that undermined the state&#x27;s authority&quot;.

High Representative Wolfgang Petritsch argued in 2006 that the Dayton framework has allowed the international community to move &quot;from statebuilding via institutions and capacity-building to identity building&quot;, putting Bosnia and Herzegovina &quot;on the road to Brussels&quot;.

The Dayton Agreement has been the subject of criticism since its inception, including:

* &quot;A complicated government system&quot; – As part of the Dayton agreement, Bosnia was divided regionally between two &quot;Entities&quot; within a consociational democracy, which was established to ensure the political representation and power of all sides. This can lead to an unproductive government in that every important issue is deadlocked within the central government as each party is championing opposing priorities that are based on ethnic policies and not shared ideals.

* &quot;Dependency and control of international actors&quot; – Dayton was very much an international vision, led by the United States who supported an end to the war, but that did not allow Bosnian leaders to negotiate an ending to the war, therefore leaving no incentive in the afterward peacebuilding process and no area for leaders to discuss the underlying root causes of the conflict. International actors also played an extensive role in shaping the postwar agenda in Bosnia. The international community invests millions of dollars in BiH yearly through NGOs. However, this stifles the impact of local actors and the development of civil society. Instead, the international community should invest in local actors, youth activists, and democratization projects. The influx of NGOs and international actors to kick start investment in the country post war also failed to kick start the economy, with Bosnia suffering from poor economic growth (2% in 2015). The lack of economic development has been attributed to poor coordination between international actors and lack of consideration for local capacity.

* &quot;Ending the war but not promoting peace&quot; – The primary aim of Dayton was to stop the war, but the agreement was only meant to be a temporary measure while a long-term plan was developed. The Dayton Agreement was the 35th attempt at a ceasefire following 34 other failed attempts. While Dayton has halted the conflict and there has not been a resurgence of violence, the stability in the conflict does not give an accurate assessment of peace. There is negative peace in BiH, meaning there is no open conflict or violence. However, there is no positive peace, as conditions that eliminate the causes of violence have not been reached. There is still currently an international military presence, EUFOR Althea, responsible for overseeing compliance with aspects of the Dayton Agreement. The Dayton Agreement provided peace by re-establishing and codifying division. Enforcing such peace can be seen as highlighting the still deep rooted tensions in the country, with Dayton covering the cracks of a fractured society that could be plunged back into conflict as soon as military forces left.

*&quot;Consociational Democracy&quot; – The Dayton Agreement established a consociational democracy in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This means that each group is ensured representation and power. This incentivized the end of the Bosnian War, but first requires collaboration or reconciliation for the government to function. Bosnia and Herzegovina operates with a three-member president role. There is a Croat, Bosniak, and Serb president. Similar quotas and rules apply for the two legislative bodies.

*&quot;Entrenching territorialized ethnicity&quot; - The Agreement was underpinned by a territorialized definition of ethnicity that divided Bosnia and Herzegovina into three constitutive nations and two distinct entities based on ethno-nationalist identities.

According to survey results from a 2020 study, &quot;in each of the three main ethnic groups of Bosnia, more people would have voted for Dayton than against it.&quot;

==Disappearance of the Bosnian copy==
On 13 February 2008, the head of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina Željko Komšić said that the 1995 Bosnian copy Dayton Agreement was lost from the Presidency&#x27;s archive. High Representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina Miroslav Lajčák said: &quot;I don&#x27;t know whether the news is sad or funny&quot;. On 16 November 2009 the French Foreign Ministry delivered a new certified copy of the Dayton agreement to the French embassy in Sarajevo. The copy was later transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The stolen 1995 copy was found in 2017 in a private residence in Pale, resulting in the arrest of the person who was trying to sell it.

<text>Antiochus XI Epiphanes Philadelphus (; died 93 BC) was a Seleucid monarch who reigned as King of Syria between 94 and 93 BC, during the Hellenistic period. He was the son of AntiochusVIII and his wife Tryphaena. AntiochusXI&#x27;s early life was a time of constant civil war between his father and his uncle AntiochusIX. The conflict ended with the assassination of AntiochusVIII, followed by the establishment of AntiochusIX in Antioch, the capital of Syria. AntiochusVIII&#x27;s eldest son SeleucusVI, in control of western Cilicia, marched against his uncle and had him killed, taking Antioch for himself, only to be expelled from it and driven to his death in 94 BC by AntiochusIX&#x27;s son AntiochusX.

Following the murder of SeleucusVI, AntiochusXI declared himself king jointly with his twin brother PhilipI. Dubious ancient accounts, which may be contradicted by archaeological evidence, report that AntiochusXI&#x27;s first act was to avenge his late brother by destroying Mopsuestia in Cilicia, the city responsible for the death of SeleucusVI. In 93 BC, AntiochusXI took Antioch, an event not mentioned by ancient historians but confirmed through numismatic evidence. AntiochusXI appears to have been the senior king, minting coinage as a sole king and reigning alone in the capital, while PhilipI remained in Cilicia, but kept his royal title. AntiochusXI may have restored the temple of Apollo and Artemis in Daphne, but his reign did not last long. In the autumn of the same year, AntiochusX regrouped and counter-attacked; AntiochusXI was defeated and drowned in the Orontes River as he tried to flee.

==Name, family and early life==

The name Antiochus is of Greek etymology and means &quot;resolute in contention&quot;. The capital of Syria, Antioch, was named after Antiochus, father of the city&#x27;s founder, King SeleucusI (reigned 305–281 BC); this name became dynastic and many Seleucid kings bore it. In AntiochusVIII married the Ptolemaic princess Tryphaena, who died in 109 BC. The couple had many children, including SeleucusVI, the eldest; AntiochusXI and PhilipI; their younger brother DemetriusIII; and the youngest AntiochusXII. The mother of PhilipI was mentioned explicitly as Tryphaena by the fourth-century historian Eusebius, who also mentioned that AntiochusXI and PhilipI were twins (&quot;didymoi&quot;). AntiochusXI&#x27;s date of birth is unknown, but by the time he came to power he was at least in his twenties.

In 113 BC, Antiochus IX declared himself king and started a civil war against his half-brother AntiochusVIII. The conflict between the brothers would last a decade and a half; it claimed the life of Tryphaena and ended with the assassination of AntiochusVIII at the hands of his minister Herakleon of Beroia in 96 BC. In the aftermath of AntiochusVIII&#x27;s death, AntiochusIX took the capital Antioch and married AntiochusVIII&#x27;s second wife and widow, Cleopatra Selene. The sons of AntiochusVIII responded; DemetriusIII took Damascus and ruled it, while SeleucusVI killed AntiochusIX in 95 BC and took Antioch. The new king was defeated by AntiochusIX&#x27;s son AntiochusX ( BC), who took the capital. SeleucusVI escaped to Mopsuestia in Cilicia where he was killed by rebels in 94 BC.

==Reign==

The reigns of the late Seleucid kings are poorly attested in ancient literature through brief passages and summaries, often riddled with conflations and contradictions; the numismatic evidence is therefore the primary source when reconstructing the reigns of late Seleucid monarchs. During SeleucusVI&#x27;s reign, AntiochusXI and his twin probably resided in Cilicia. In the aftermath of SeleucusVI&#x27;s death, AntiochusXI and PhilipI declared themselves kings in 94 BC; the historian Alfred Bellinger suggested that their base was a coastal city north of Antioch, while Arthur Houghton believed it was Beroea, because the city&#x27;s rulers were PhilipI&#x27;s allies.

It is more likely that Tarsus was the main base of operations; both AntiochusXI and PhilipI&#x27;s portraits appeared on the obverses of jugate coins they struck, and all the jugate coins were minted in Cilicia. Three series of jugate coins are known; as of 2008, one series has six known surviving specimens, depicting both kings with beards. The excellent craftsmanship of the portraits depicted on the coins of the six specimen series indicates that the minting facility was located in a city that was a center of culture, making Tarsus the likely site of the mint and so the probable base of operations.

The other two coin series have fewer surviving specimens and depict AntiochusXI with a sideburn. Those coins were not minted in Tarsus, and the sideburn indicates that those issues were produced by cities west of the main base, as the king passed them on his way to Tarsus; by the time AntiochusXI arrived at his headquarters, he was depicted with a full beard. On all jugate coins, AntiochusXI was portrayed in front of PhilipI, his name taking precedence, showing that he was the senior monarch. According to Josephus, AntiochusXI became king before PhilipI, but the numismatic evidence suggests otherwise, as the earliest coins show both brothers ruling jointly.

===Epithets and royal image===

Hellenistic monarchs did not use regnal numbers but usually employed epithets to distinguish themselves from other kings with similar names; the numbering of kings is mostly a modern practice. On his coins, AntiochusXI appeared with the epithets &quot;Epiphanes&quot; (God Manifest) and &quot;Philadelphus&quot; (Brother-Loving). Epiphanes served to emphasize AntiochusXI&#x27;s paternity as a son of AntiochusVIII, who bore the same epithet; while &quot;Philadelphus&quot; was probably a sign of respect to SeleucusVI and PhilipI. The beard sported by AntiochusXI on his jugate coins from Tarsus is probably a sign of mourning and the intention to avenge SeleucusVI&#x27;s death. The last issue of AntiochusXI from Antioch depicts him beardless, highlighting that the vow was fulfilled.
Drawing his legitimacy from his father, Antiochus XI appeared on his coinage with an exaggerated hawked nose, in the likeness of AntiochusVIII. The iconography of AntiochusXI&#x27;s portrait was part of the &quot;tryphé&quot;-king tradition, heavily used by AntiochusVIII. The ruler&#x27;s portrait express &quot;tryphé&quot; (luxury and magnificence), where his unattractive features and stoutness are emphasized. The tradition of &quot;tryphé&quot; images started in Egypt, and was later adopted in Syria. The Romans considered the &quot;tryphé&quot; portraits as evidence of the degeneracy and decadence of Hellenistic kings; the softness depicted in the portraits was seen as a sign of the rulers&#x27; incompetence, a way to explain the decline of the Hellenistic dynasties. However, the Roman view is not factual; those images were an intentional policy in a kingdom ravaged by civil war. Most late Seleucid monarchs, including AntiochusXI, spent their reigns fighting, causing havoc in their lands. The image of a warrior king on coins, as was customary for Hellenistic Bactrian kings for example, would have alienated the already impoverished population suffering the consequences of war. The people needed peace and copiousness, and the &quot;tryphé&quot; portrait was an attempt to imply that the king and his people were living a pleasurable life. By employing the &quot;tryphé&quot; image, AntiochusXI suggested that he would be a successful and popular king like his father.

===Avenging Seleucus VI and taking the capital===

According to Eusebius, the brothers sacked Mopsuestia and destroyed it to avenge SeleucusVI. Eusebius&#x27;s statement is doubtful because in 86 BC, Rome conferred inviolability upon the cult of Isis and Sarapis in Mopsuestia, which is proven by an inscription from the city. After Mopsuestia, AntiochusXI left PhilipI in Cilicia and advanced on Antioch, driving AntiochusX from the city at the beginning of 93 BC. Ancient historians do not note AntiochusXI&#x27;s reign in the capital, stating that he fought against AntiochusX and was defeated. The 6th-century Byzantine monk and historian John Malalas, whose work is considered generally unreliable by scholars, mentions the reign of AntiochusXI in his account of the Roman period in Antioch. The material evidence for AntiochusXI&#x27;s success in taking the capital was provided in 1912, when an account of a coin struck by him in Antioch was published.
Philip I did not take residence in the capital and AntiochusXI minted coinage as a sole king. PhilipI kept the royal title while remaining in the city which was his base during the preparations to avenge SeleucusVI. The numismatist Edward Theodore Newell assigned AntiochusXI a reign of a few weeks in the capital, but according to the numismatist Oliver Hoover, estimating the average annual die usage rate of the King suggests a reign of several months. According to Malalas, King Antiochus Philadelphus, i.e. AntiochusXI, built a temple for Apollo and Artemis in Daphne, and set up two golden statues representing the gods, as well as conferring the right of asylum to anyone who took refuge in the temple; this statement cannot be correct since the temple was attested during the time of AntiochusIII ( BC). The historian Glanville Downey, observing Malalas&#x27;s writing style in Greek, suggested that by &quot;building&quot;, Malalas meant renovating or restoring, which indicates that a predecessor of AntiochusXI may have desecrated the temple and melted down the golden statues.

==End and succession==

By autumn 93 BC, Antiochus X counter-attacked, defeating AntiochusXI, who drowned in the Orontes River as he tried to flee. Ancient accounts dealing with the last battle differ: according to the first-century historian Josephus, AntiochusXI fought alone, while Eusebius has both AntiochusXI and PhilipI in the battle. Eusebius failed to note the reign of AntiochusXI in Antioch, stating that the final battle took place immediately after the destruction of Mopsuestia; a statement contradicted by numismatic evidence. In the view of Bellinger, the brothers&#x27; combined armies must have been deployed, but since only AntiochusXI perished, it is probable that PhilipI stayed behind at his capital with AntiochusXI leading the armies in the field.

Nothing is known regarding Antiochus XI&#x27;s marriages or children. According to the first century biographer Plutarch, the first-century BC Roman general Lucullus said that the Armenian king, TigranesII, who conquered Syria in 83BC, &quot;put to death the successors of Seleucus, and [carried] off their wives and daughters into captivity&quot;. Ancient sources regarding the late Seleucid period are fragmentary and do not mention many details. Therefore, the statement of Lucullus makes it possible that a wife or daughters of AntiochusXI existed, and that they were taken by the Armenian king. Following his victory, AntiochusX regained the capital and ruled it until his death.

<doc id="168271" wikidata="Q299007" url="?curid=168271" title="Seleucus VI Epiphanes">
<text>Seleucus VI Epiphanes Nicator (; between 124 and 109 BC – 94 BC) was a Hellenistic Seleucid monarch who ruled Syria between 96 and 94 BC. He was the son of Antiochus VIII and his Ptolemaic Egyptian wife Tryphaena. Seleucus VI lived during a period of civil war between his father and his uncle Antiochus IX, which ended in 96 BC when Antiochus VIII was assassinated. Antiochus IX then occupied the capital Antioch while Seleucus VI established his power-base in western Cilicia and himself prepared for war. In 95 BC, Antiochus IX marched against his nephew, but lost the battle and was killed. Seleucus VI became the master of the capital but had to share Syria with his brother Demetrius III, based in Damascus, and his cousin, Antiochus IX&#x27;s son Antiochus X.

According to the ancient historian Appian, Seleucus VI was a violent ruler. He taxed his dominions extensively to support his wars, and resisted allowing the cities a measure of autonomy, as had been the practice of former kings. His reign did not last long; in 94 BC, he was expelled from Antioch by Antiochus X, who followed him to the Cilician city of Mopsuestia. Seleucus took shelter in the city where his attempts to raise money led to riots that eventually claimed his life in 94 BC. Ancient traditions have different versions of his death, but he was most probably burned alive by the rioters. Following his demise, his brothers Antiochus XI and Philip I destroyed Mopsuestia as an act of revenge and their armies fought those of Antiochus X.

==Name, family and early life==

&quot;Seleucus&quot; was a dynastic name in the Seleucid dynasty, and it is the Macedonian variant of the Greek (), meaning &#x27;the shining white&#x27;. Antiochus VIII married the Ptolemaic Egyptian princess Tryphaena in 124BC, shortly after his ascension to the throne; Seleucus VI was the couple&#x27;s eldest son. From 113BC, Antiochus VIII had to contend with his half-brother Antiochus IX for the throne. The civil war continued for more than a decade; it claimed the life of Tryphaena in 109 BC, and ended when Antiochus VIII was assassinated in 96BC. In the aftermath of his brother&#x27;s murder, Antiochus IX advanced on the capital Antioch and took it; he also married the second wife and widow of Antiochus VIII, Cleopatra Selene. According to an inscription, the city of Priene sent honors to &quot;Seleucus son of King Antiochus son of King Demetrius&quot;; the embassy probably took place before Seleucus VI ascended the throne as the inscription does not mention him as a king. The embassy of Priene probably met Seleucus VI in Cilicia; Antiochus VIII might have sent his son to that region as a strategos.

==Reign==


Following his father&#x27;s death, Seleucus VI declared himself king and took the city of Seleucia on the Calycadnus in western Cilicia as his base, while his brother Demetrius III took Damascus. The volume of coins minted by the new king in Seleucia on the Calycadnus surpassed any other mint known from the late Seleucid period, and most of the coins were produced during his preparations for war against Antiochus IX, a conflict that would end in the year 96/95 BC (217 SE (Seleucid year)). This led the numismatist Arthur Houghton to suggest an earlier death for Antiochus VIII and a longer reign for Seleucus VI beginning in 98 or 97BC instead of 96BC. The numismatist Oliver D. Hoover contested Houghton&#x27;s hypothesis, as it was not rare for a king to double his production in a single year at times of need, and the academic consensus prefers the year 96BC for the death of Antiochus VIII.

===Titles and royal image===
Ancient Hellenistic kings did not use regnal numbers. Instead, they employed epithets to distinguish themselves from other kings with similar names; the numbering of kings is a modern practice. Seleucus VI appeared on his coins with the epithets &quot;Epiphanes&quot; (God Manifest) and &quot;Nicator&quot; (Victorious). As being the son of Antiochus VIII was the source of his legitimacy as king, Seleucus VI sought to emphasize his descent by depicting himself on the coinage with an exaggerated hawk-nose in the likeness of his father.

Another iconographic element of Seleucus VI&#x27;s coinage is the short vertical stubby horns above the temple area; the meaning of this motif has been debated among scholars. It is likely an allusion to Seleucus VI&#x27;s descent from his grandfather Demetrius II, who utilized the same motif. The specific meaning of the horns is not clear, but it could have been an indication that the king was a manifestation of a god; the stubby horns sported by Seleucus VI probably carried the same meaning as those of his grandfather. In the Seleucid dynasty, currency struck during campaigns against a rival (or usurper) showed the king with a beard. Seleucus VI was depicted with a beard, which was later removed from coins, indicating the fulfilment of a vengeance vow to avenge his father.

===Struggle against Antiochus IX===
In Seleucia on the Calycadnus, Seleucus VI prepared for war against his uncle, whose forces probably occupied central Cilicia and confined his nephew to the western parts of the region. The king needed a harbor for Seleucia on the Calycadnus and probably founded the city of Elaiussa to serve that purpose. Seleucus VI gathered funds for his coming war from the cities of Cilicia, including Mopsuestia, which seems to have been taxed on several occasions. During his reign, it is estimated that Seleucus VI produced 1,200 talents of coins to support his war effort, enough to pay ten thousand soldiers for two years. On the reverse of bronze coins produced in a mint whose location is not known, coded uncertain mint 125, a motif depicting a chelys formed in the shape of a Macedonian shield appeared on the reverse. This motif was probably meant to rally the support of military Macedonian colonists in the region. Those coins were probably produced in Syria, in a city half the way between Tarsus in Cilicia and Antioch; therefore, they were probably minted in the course of Seleucus VI&#x27;s campaign against Antiochus IX.
Antiochus IX took note of Seleucus VI&#x27;s preparations; after the latter started his march on Antioch in 95BC, Antiochus IX left the capital and moved against his nephew. Seleucus VI emerged victorious while his uncle lost his life, either by committing suicide according to the 3rd-century historian Eusebius, or by being executed according to the 1st-century historian Josephus. Soon afterwards, Seleucus VI entered the capital; Cleopatra Selene probably fled before his arrival.

===Policy and the war against Antiochus X===
In 144 SE (169/168 BC), King Antiochus IV allowed nineteen cities to mint municipal bronze coinage in their own names, indicating his awareness of the mutual dependency of cities and the monarchy on each other. This movement towards greater autonomy continued as the cities sought to emancipate themselves from the central power, adding the phrase &quot;sacred and autonomous&quot; to their coinage. Seleucus VI did not follow the policy of his forebears. In Cilicia, as long as he reigned, autonomy was not granted; a change in the political status of Cilician cities was apparently not acceptable for Seleucus VI.

Seleucus VI controlled Cilicia and Syria Seleucis (Northern Syria). Antiochus IX had a son, Antiochus X; according to Josephus, he fled to the city of Aradus where he declared himself king. Seleucus VI attempted to kill his cousin and rival but the plot failed, and Antiochus X married Cleopatra Selene to enhance his position. The archaeologist Alfred Bellinger believed that Seleucus VI prepared for his coming war against Antiochus X in Elaiussa. In 94BC, Antiochus X advanced on the capital Antioch and drove Seleucus VI out of northern Syria into Cilicia. According to Eusebius, the final battle took place near Mopsuestia, and ended with the defeat of Seleucus VI.

==Death and legacy==

Described by the 2nd-century historian Appian as &quot;violent and extremely tyrannical&quot;, Seleucus VI took shelter in Mopsuestia, and attempted to tax the residents again, which led to his death during riots. The year of his demise is not clear; Eusebius placed it in 216 SE (97/96 BC), which is impossible considering that a market weight of Seleucus VI from Antioch dated to 218 SE (95/94 BC) has been discovered. The 4th-century historian Jerome has 219 SE (94/93 BC) as the year of Seleucus VI&#x27;s demise, which is more plausible. The year 94BC is the academically accepted date for the death of Seleucus VI. No spouse or children were recorded for Seleucus VI. According to the 1st-century biographer Plutarch, the 1st-century BC Roman general Lucullus said that the Armenian king, Tigranes II, who conquered Syria in 83BC, &quot;put to death the successors of Seleucus, and [carried] off their wives and daughters into captivity&quot;. Given the fragmentary nature of ancient sources regarding the late Seleucid period, the statement of Lucullus leaves open the existence of a wife or daughter of Seleucus VI.

Ancient traditions preserve three accounts regarding Seleucus VI&#x27;s death: the oldest, by Josephus, has a mob burning the king and his courtiers in the royal palace. Appian shares the burning account but has the city&#x27;s gymnasium as the scene. According to Eusebius, Seleucus VI discovered the intention of the residents to burn him, and took his own life. Bellinger considered the account of Josephus to be the most probable; he noted that Eusebius presented suicide accounts for other Seleucid kings who were recorded as having been killed by other historians, such as Alexander I and Antiochus IX. Bellinger believed that the 3rd-century historian Porphyry, the source of Eusebius&#x27; stories about the Seleucids, was attempting to &quot;tone down somewhat the horrors of the Seleucid house&quot;.

The city of Athens shared a close relation with the Seleucid kings, and statues of Syrian monarchs set up by Athenian citizens on the island of Delos testify to this; a citizen named Dionysius dedicated a statue for Seleucus VI between 96 and 94BC. In deference to his late brother, King Antiochus XI adopted the epithet &quot;Philadelphus&quot; (brother loving). Along with his twin Philip I, Antiochus XI proceeded to avenge Seleucus VI; the brothers sacked and destroyed Mopsuestia. Antiochus XI then headed to Antioch in 93BC and expelled Antiochus X.

<text>Antiochus XIII Philadelphus, (Greek: Ἀντίοχος ΙΓ&#x27; Φιλάδελφος) known as Asiaticus, (Ἀσιατικός) was the penultimate ruler of the Seleucid kingdom.

==Biography==

Antiochus took the throne after the death of his father, king Antiochus X Eusebes, sometime between 92 and 88 BC. The new king was underage, and his mother, the Ptolemaic princess Cleopatra Selene of Syria, acted as his regent. Some time after Tigranes had conquered Syria (83 or 74 BC), Antiochus and his brother traveled to Rome to have recognized as kings of Egypt, but to no avail. However, between 75 BC and 73 BC, they were recognized as &quot;Kings of Syria&quot;, and &quot;maintained a royal state&quot;. Selene was eventually captured and killed by Tigranes. However, after the latter&#x27;s defeat by Lucius Licinius Lucullus at the Battle of Tigranocerta, the residents of Antioch hailed Antiochus XIII as king, and Lucullus approved his appointment as client ruler of Syria (69 BC).

In 64 BC, Pompey had Antiochus XIII deposed and killed by a Syrian chieftain, Sampsiceramus I. Antiochus&#x27; death is traditionally said to have ended the Seleucid dynasty, but he was survived by Philip II Philoromaeus for a short time and by Seleucus VII Philometor until 58 BC, if the latter is identified with same prince who briefly married Berenice IV of Egypt.

<doc id="168273" wikidata="Q2037692" url="?curid=168273" title="Shivta">
<text>Shivta (), originally Sobata () or Subeita (), is an ancient city in the Negev Desert of Israel located 43 kilometers southwest of Beersheba. Shivta was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in June 2005, as part of the Incense Route and the Desert Cities of the Negev, together with Haluza/Elusa, Avdat and Mamshit/Mampsis.

The name Shivta is a modern Hebraization, given by the Negev Naming Committee in the early 1950s. The Greek name Sobata was mentioned in the Nessana papyri.

==History==

Long considered a classical Nabataean town on the ancient spice route, archaeologists are now considering the possibility that Shivta was a Byzantine agricultural colony and a way station for pilgrims en route to the Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula.

A few Roman-period ruins have been discovered, but most of the archaeological findings date to the Byzantine period. Shivta&#x27;s water supply was based on surface runoff collected in large reservoirs.

===Roman period===
Roman ruins from the first century BCE have been unearthed in the southern part of the town.

===Byzantine period===
Three Byzantine churches (a main church and two smaller ones), two wine-presses, residential areas and administrative buildings have been excavated.

====Churches====
Traces of a mural of Christ&#x27;s transfiguration were discovered in the apse of the southern church, as well as remains of a colourful 6th-century mosaic and a beardless depiction of Jesus in the northern church.

====Agriculture (wine)====

The wine presses at Shivta give an insight into the scale of wine production at the time. According to the calculations of archaeologists, the Nabatean/Byzantine village of Shivta produced about two million liters of wine.

Adjacent to the site is a large farm that uses Nabatean agricultural techniques of irrigation, sowing and reaping.

In the early 6th century, grape production in the Negev for the so-called &quot;vinum Gazentum&quot; (&#x27;Gaza wine&#x27; in Latin) experienced a major boom due to the high demand for this product throughout Europe and the Middle East. This has been documented by studying ancient trash mounds at Shivta, Elusa, and Nessana, which showed a sharp peak in the presence of grape pips and broken &quot;Gaza jars&quot; (a type of amphorae used in this period to export Levantine goods from the port of Gaza), following a slower rise during the fourth and fifth centuries. However, mid-century two major calamities struck the Byzantine Empire and large parts of the world: a short period of climate change known as the Late Antique Little Ice Age (536-545), caused by huge volcanic eruptions in faraway places, which lead to extreme weather events; and in the 540s the first outbreak of bubonic plague in the Old World, known as the Justinianic Plague. Probably as a result of these two events, international trade with luxury goods such as Gaza wine almost grounded to a halt, and in Shivta and other Negev settlements grape production again gave way to subsistence farming, focused on barley and wheat. The previously widely accepted theory that the Muslim conquest, which came a century later, and the Muslim ban on alcoholic beverages were the cause for the decline of the wine industry in the Negev has been now proven wrong. In nearby Nessana, the number of grape pips is even on the rise again during the Early Islamic period, probably due to the needs of a local Christian monastery. This seems to indicate that the wine industry of the Negev could well be sustained over centuries through appropriate agricultural techniques and in spite of the arid climate, but that the grape monoculture was economically unsustainable in the long run.

===Early Muslim period===
After the Arab conquest in the 7th century CE, the population dwindled. Shivta was finally abandoned in the 8th or 9th century CE.

== The Armenian Graffito from the Southern Church of Shivta ==
The Armenian Graffito from the Southern Church of Shivta is a significant archaeological find. It is believed to have been created by an Armenian pilgrim during the Byzantine and Early Islamic periods. This graffito is one of many such inscriptions found along pilgrimage routes, particularly in the Sinai Peninsula, where large groups of Armenian pilgrims traveled in the sixth and seventh centuries.
The Armenian graffito inscription is carved into a hewn stone measuring 0.25 by 0.5 meters. It is located on the eastern side of the apse, specifically on the eighth row of stones, at a height of 2.8 meters above the church floor. The graffito is 0.24 meters wide, with letters standing at a height of 0.17 meters. The inscription consists of only two uncial letters: Բ (B) and Ա (A).

Armenian graffiti have also been found in other holy sites, including the Nativity Church in Bethlehem, the Holy Sepulchre Church, and the sanctuaries of the Armenian Quarter in Jerusalem. These inscriptions are dated to the Crusader period and later, indicating the continued pilgrimage of Armenians to the Holy Land.

The presence of Armenian graffiti at Shivta is intriguing, as the site had lost its significance as a pilgrimage station by the time the graffito was created. This suggests that the tradition of veneration at Shivta may have persisted among Armenians, and that they may have preferred less-traveled routes for their pilgrimage journeys.

Overall, the Armenian Graffito from Shivta provides valuable insight into the pilgrimage routes and practices of Armenians in the Holy Land, connecting major holy sites in central and northern Palestine with the Sinai Peninsula.

==Excavation history==
Ulrich Jasper Seetzen was the first Westerner to visit the site when he arrived in 1805, but he misidentified it as Abde (Avdat). Edward Henry Palmer came in 1870 and the following year he published the first official description, while Alois Musil&#x27;s 1901 visit resulted in the publication of the first photos of the ruins. A team from the École Biblique in Jerusalem including famed researchers Antonin Jaussen, Raphaël Savignac and Louis-Hugues Vincent studied a few aspects of the site in 1904, Theodor Kühtreiber added a few observations in 1912. The first scientific study covering agricultural and social aspects came as a result of a survey by C. L. Woolley and T. E. Lawrence (the future &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;), taken on behalf of the Palestine Exploration Fund (PEF) in 1914. During the Great War, a German team of researchers (Theodor Wiegand, Carl Watzinger and Walter Bachmann), part of the (&quot;German-Turkish Command for Cultural Heritage Protection&quot;), studied the site in 1916. The École Biblique returned in 1926 with a team under Raphaël Tonneau, and in 1929 with Alexis Mallon.

In 1933–38, American archaeologist Harris Dunscombe Colt conducted a dig at Shivta. The house he lived in bears an inscription in ancient Greek that reads: &quot;With good luck. Colt built (this house) with his own money.&quot; Colt never published the result of his excavations, which also represent the only large-scale archaeological campaigns executed at the site. Much of the archaeological information is lost for good, not least due to a fire on 7 October 1938 at the expedition house that consumed all the collected architectural decoration and dig notes.

Updates from 2018:
:In January 1938, a suitcase, which contained artifacts, documents, and photographs from the archaeological excavations at Shivta, was forgotten at the Haifa port. The suitcase belonged to Harris Dunscombe Colt (1901—1973), the excavator of Shivta. Colt never came to claim the forgotten suitcase, nor was it ever sent to him. The suitcase was eventually shipped to Jerusalem and its contents were never studied or published. 
:The artifacts, which consist of small items like jewelry, door hinges, nails, pieces of glass, objects made from bone, ivory and wood, and shards of pottery inscribed with Arabic and Greek writing, are now on display at the Hecht Museum at the University of Haifa.

In the late 1940s, Bellarmino Bagatti continued work at the northern church, and in the 1950s Nelson Glueck researched Shivta&#x27;s ecology. Between 1958-1960, Michael Avi-Yonah and made the site accessible, in the process also clearing the central church of debris.

In the 1960s, botanist Michael Evenari studied the economy of Shivta and water collection in its arid environment, his methods of experimental archaeology offering important insights into subsistence farming in the Negev desert.

Between 1970-1976, Avraham Negev led various surveys, others following with a number of small digs, theoretical studies and mapping efforts. A 2000-2001 in-depth study of Shivta&#x27;s water systems, based on surveys and analysis, was the work of Tsvika Tsuk.

<doc id="168274" wikidata="Q648828" url="?curid=168274" title="CAC 40">
<text>The CAC 40 () () is a benchmark French stock market index. The index represents a capitalization-weighted measure of the 40 most significant stocks among the 100 largest market caps on the Euronext Paris (formerly the Paris Bourse). It is a price return index. It is one of the main national indices of the pan-European stock exchange group Euronext alongside Euronext Amsterdam&#x27;s AEX, Euronext Brussels&#x27; BEL20, Euronext Dublin&#x27;s ISEQ 20, Euronext Lisbon&#x27;s PSI-20 and the Oslo Bors OBX Index.
It is an index without dividends.
Cotation operates every working day from 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. It is updated every 15 seconds.

==History==
The CAC 5 and the CAC 40 take their name from the Paris Bourse&#x27;s early automation system Cotation Assistée en Continu (Continuous Assisted Quotation). CAC 5, inaugurated on 23 June 1986, was a version of the Toronto Computer Assisted Trading System, the first fully automated trading system. CAC 5 consisted of Leroy-Somer, LVMH, Synthélabo, Eurocom and UCB. CAC 40&#x27;s base value of 1,000 was set on 31 December 1987, equivalent to a market capitalisation of 370,437,433,957.70 French francs. On 1 December 2003, the index&#x27;s weighting system switched from being dependent on total market capitalisation to free float market cap only, in line with other leading indices.

==Rules==

===Selection===
The CAC 40 index composition is reviewed quarterly by an independent Index Steering Committee (). If any changes are made, they are
effected a minimum of two weeks after the review meeting. At each review date, the companies listed on Euronext Paris are ranked according to free float market capitalisation and share turnover over the prior 12 months. From the top 100 companies in this ranking, forty are chosen to enter the CAC 40 such that it is &quot;a relevant benchmark for portfolio management&quot; and &quot;a suitable underlying asset for derivatives products&quot;. If a company has more than one class of shares traded on the exchange, only the most actively traded of these will be accepted into the index (generally this will be the ordinary share).

===Weighting===
The CAC 40 is a capitalization-weighted index. The number of shares issued (used to calculate the market cap and hence the index weight) of a company is reviewed quarterly, on the third Friday of March, June, September and December. Since December 2003, the index weightings of companies in the index have been capped at 15% at each quarterly index review, but these range freely with share price subsequently. A capping factor is used to limit the weights to 15% (if necessary), and is reviewed annually by the Index Steering Committee on the third Friday of September.

===Calculation===
The index value I of the CAC 40 index is calculated using the following formula:
formula_1
with &quot;t&quot; the day of calculation; &quot;N&quot; the number of constituent shares in the index (usually 40); &quot;Qi,t&quot; the number of shares of company &quot;i&quot; on day &quot;t&quot;; &quot;Fi,t&quot; the free float factor of share &quot;i&quot;; &quot;fi,t&quot; the capping factor of share &quot;i&quot; (exactly 1 for all companies not subject to the 15% cap); &quot;Ci,t&quot; the price of share &quot;i&quot; on day &quot;t&quot;; &quot;Qi,0&quot; the number of shares of company &quot;i&quot; on the index base date; &quot;Ci,0&quot; the price of equity &quot;i&quot; on the index base date; and &quot;Kt&quot; the &quot;adjustment coefficient for base capitalization&quot; on day &quot;t&quot; (reflecting the switch from the French franc to the Euro in 1999).

=== Contract specifications ===
The CAC 40 index is traded as a future on the Euronext Equities &amp; Index Derivatives (EUREID) exchange under the ticker symbol PIL.
==Holders==
Although the CAC 40 is almost exclusively composed of French-domiciled companies, about 45% of its listed shares are owned by foreign investors, more than any other main European index. German, Japanese, American and British investors are amongst the most significant holders of CAC 40 shares. This large percentage is due to the fact that CAC 40 companies are more international, or multinational, than any other European market. CAC 40 companies conduct over two-thirds of their business and employ over two-thirds of their workforce outside France.

==Annual returns==
The following table shows the annual development of the CAC 40, which was calculated back to 1969.
==Composition==

The index consists of the following companies as of the quarterly update effective September 2024.

The most recent composition can be found on the Euronext website.

<text>Philip II Philoromaeus (, &quot;Friend of the Romans&quot;) or Barypous (Βαρύπους, &quot;Heavy-foot&quot;), a ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire, was the son of the Seleucid king Philip I Philadelphus, and the last Seleucid king.

==Biography==
Philip II himself briefly ruled parts of Syria in the 60s BC, as a client king under Pompey. He competed with his second cousin Antiochus XIII Asiaticus for the favours of the great Roman general, but Pompey would have none of them and had Antiochus murdered. No coins of Philip II are known, which is unusual for Seleucid rulers (the ephemeral Seleucus V Philometor is the only other king for whom this is the case). This may indicate that Philip did not rule in any of the mint cities.

Philip may have survived his deposition: a Seleucid prince Philip is mentioned as a prospective bridegroom to queen Berenice IV of Egypt, sister of Cleopatra VII in 56 BC. The union was, however, blocked by the Roman governor of Syria Aulus Gabinius who forbade Philip II to accept the offer and probably had him killed soon after that; Berenice eventually married Philip&#x27;s cousin Seleucus VII Philometor, only to later have him killed for his lack of manners.

Philip himself was indeed an insignificant pawn, but with him ended eleven generations of Seleucid kings, arguably some of the most influential rulers of the Hellenistic world.

<text>Seleucus VII Philometor () or Kybiosactes (), was a possible ruler of the Seleucid kingdom based in Syria, but his existence is disputed.

==Biography==
===King of Syria===
The last members of the once mighty Seleucid dynasty are shadowy figures; local dynasts with complicated family ties whose identities are hard to ascertain: many of them also bore the same names. Seleucus was unknown until recently. From coins issued by him and his mother, Ptolemaic princess Cleopatra Selene, it is presumed that he was her son by king Antiochus X Eusebes, and a brother of later king Antiochus XIII Asiaticus. He appears to have &quot;reigned&quot; during the occupation of Syria by Armenian king Tigranes (83-69 BC). In reality, only a few cities were loyal to the Seleucids during this period.

Some time after Tigranes had conquered Syria (83 BC), his mother travelled to Rome to have her sons recognized as kings of Egypt, but to no avail. They were there between at least 75 BC and 73 BC; recognized as &quot;Kings of Syria&quot;, and &quot;maintained a royal state&quot;.

===Co-regent of Egypt===
The young boy-king is probably the same Seleucus who later went to marry a Ptolemaic princess called Berenice IV on an unknown date (a sister of the famous Cleopatra VII of Egypt) to become co-regent of Egypt, but allegedly was murdered by the discontented bride for his lack of manners. He bore the derogatory name &quot;Kybiosaktes&quot;, the term for the foul-smelling work of cutting tuna fish.

==Controversy==
In 2002, the numismatist Brian Kritt announced the discovery and decipherment of a coin bearing the portrait of Cleopatra Selene and a co-ruler. Kritt read the name of the ruler as Seleucus Philometor and, based on the epithet, identified him with Cleopatra Selene&#x27;s son, unnamed by Cicero. Kritt gave the newly discovered ruler the regnal name Seleucus VII, and considered it very likely that he is identical with Kybiosaktes. But Hoover rejected Kritt&#x27;s reading, noting that the coin was badly damaged and some letters were unreadable. Hoover read the king&#x27;s name as Antiochus and identified him with Antiochus XIII.

<doc id="168280" wikidata="Q234224" url="?curid=168280" title="Dian Fossey">
<text>Dian Fossey ( ; January 16, 1932 – ) was an American primatologist and conservationist known for undertaking an extensive study of mountain gorilla groups from 1966 until her murder in 1985. She studied them daily in the mountain forests of Rwanda, initially encouraged to work there by paleoanthropologist Louis Leakey. &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot;, a book published two years before her death, is Fossey&#x27;s account of her scientific study of the gorillas at the Karisoke Research Center and prior career. It was adapted into a 1988 film of the same name.

Fossey was a leading primatologist, and a member of the &quot;Trimates&quot;, a group of female scientists recruited by Leakey to study great apes in their natural environments, along with Jane Goodall who studies chimpanzees, and Birutė Galdikas, who studies orangutans.

Fossey spent 20 years in Rwanda, where she supported conservation efforts, strongly opposed poaching and tourism in wildlife habitats, and made more people acknowledge the sapience of gorillas. Following the killing of a gorilla and subsequent tensions, she was murdered in her cabin at a remote camp in Rwanda in December 1985. Although Fossey&#x27;s American research assistant was convicted &quot;in absentia&quot;, there is no consensus as to who killed her.

Her research and conservation work helped reduce the downward population trend in mountain gorillas.

==Early life==
Fossey was born in San Francisco, California, the daughter of Hazel (née Kidd), a fashion model, and George Edward Fossey III, a real estate agent and business owner. Her parents divorced when she was six. Her mother remarried the following year, to businessman Richard Price. Her father tried to keep in contact, but her mother discouraged it, and all contact was subsequently lost. Fossey&#x27;s stepfather, Richard Price, never treated her as his own child. He would not allow Fossey to sit at the dining room table with him or her mother during dinner. A man adhering to strict discipline, Richard Price offered Fossey little to no emotional support. Although, by 1950, Richard and Hazel would relocate with Dian to Marin County, the same county where her father George Fossey, now married to Mrs. Gladys Bove (née Kohler), resided. (George and Gladys would divorce by 1960. His third and final marriage would be to Kathryn Smith around 1959. Kathryn has mistakenly been cited as Dian&#x27;s mother over the years.)

Struggling with personal insecurity, Fossey turned to animals as a way to gain acceptance. Her love for animals began with her first pet goldfish and continued throughout her life. At age six, she began riding horses, earning a letter from her school; by her college graduation in 1954, Fossey had established herself as an equestrienne.

===Education and medical career===
Fossey attended Lowell High School. Following the guidance of her stepfather, she enrolled in a business course at the College of Marin in San Francisco. However, spending her summer on a ranch in Montana at age 19 rekindled her love of animals, and she enrolled in a pre-veterinary course in biology at the University of California, Davis. In defiance of her stepfather&#x27;s wishes for her to attend a business school, Fossey decided to spend her professional life working with animals. Consequently, Fossey&#x27;s parents failed to give her any substantial financial support in her adult life. She supported herself by working as a clerk at a White Front department store, doing other clerking and laboratory work, and laboring as a machinist in a factory.

Although Fossey had always been an exemplary student, she had difficulty with chemistry and physics, and failed her second year of the program. She transferred to San Jose State College where she became a member of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority and studied occupational therapy, receiving her bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1954. Fossey began her career in occupational therapy. She interned at hospitals in California and worked with tuberculosis patients. Fossey had become a prizewinning equestrian, which drew her to Kentucky in 1955, and a year later took a job as an occupational therapist at the Kosair Crippled Children&#x27;s Hospital in Louisville.

Her shy and reserved personality helped her to work well with the children at the hospital. Fossey became close to her coworker Mary White &quot;Gaynee&quot; Henry, secretary to the hospital&#x27;s chief administrator and the wife of one of the doctors, Michael J. Henry. The Henrys invited Fossey to join them on their family farm, where she worked with livestock daily and experienced the inclusive family atmosphere that had been missing for most of her life. During her free time she pursued her love of horses.

==The Leakeys and the Congo==
===Journey to Africa===

Fossey turned down an offer to join the Henrys on an African tour due to lack of finances, but in 1963 she borrowed $8,000 (one year&#x27;s salary), took out her life savings and went on a seven-week visit to Africa. In September 1963, she arrived in Nairobi, Kenya. While there, she was introduced to safari guide John Alexander, who became her guide for the next seven weeks through Kenya, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. Their route included visits to Tsavo, East Africa&#x27;s largest national park; the saline lake of Manyara, famous for attracting giant flocks of flamingos; and the Ngorongoro Crater, well known for its abundant wildlife. The final two sites for her visit were Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania (the archeological site of Louis and Mary Leakey); and Mt. Mikeno in Congo, where, in 1959, American zoologist George Schaller had carried out a yearlong pioneering study of the mountain gorilla. At Olduvai Gorge, Fossey met the Leakeys while they were examining the area for hominid fossils. Leakey talked to Fossey about the work of English primatologist Jane Goodall and the importance of long-term research on the great apes.

Although Fossey had broken her ankle while visiting the Leakeys, by October 16, she was staying in Walter Baumgartel&#x27;s small hotel in Uganda, the Travellers Rest. Baumgartel, an advocate of gorilla conservation, was among the first to see the benefits that tourism could bring to the area, and he introduced Fossey to Kenyan wildlife photographers Joan and Alan Root. The couple agreed to allow Fossey and Alexander to camp behind their own camp, and it was during these few days that Fossey first encountered wild mountain gorillas. After staying with friends in Rhodesia, Fossey returned home to Louisville to repay her loans. She published three articles in &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; newspaper, detailing her visit to Africa.

===Research in the Congo===
When Leakey made an appearance in Louisville while on a nationwide lecture tour, Fossey took the color supplements that had appeared about her African trip in &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; to show to Leakey, who remembered her and her interest in mountain gorillas. Three years after the original safari, Leakey suggested that Fossey could undertake a long-term study of the gorillas in the same manner as Jane Goodall had with chimpanzees in Tanzania. Leakey lined up funding for Fossey to research mountain gorillas, and Fossey left her job to relocate to Africa.

After studying Swahili and auditing a class on primatology during the eight months it took to get funding and her visas, Fossey arrived in Nairobi in December 1966. With the help of Joan Root and Leakey, Fossey acquired the necessary provisions and an old canvas-topped Land Rover which she named &quot;Lily&quot;. On the way to the Congo, Fossey visited the Gombe Stream Research Centre to meet Goodall and observe her research methods with chimpanzees. Accompanied by photographer Alan Root, who helped her obtain work permits for the Virunga Mountains, Fossey began her field study at Kabara, in the Congo in early 1967, in the same meadow where Schaller had made his camp seven years earlier. Root taught her basic gorilla tracking, and his tracker Sanwekwe later helped in Fossey&#x27;s camp. Living in tents on mainly tinned produce, once a month Fossey would hike down the mountain to &quot;Lily&quot; and make the two-hour drive to the village of Kikumba to restock.

Fossey identified three distinct groups in her study area, but could not get close to them. She eventually found that mimicking their actions and making grunting sounds reassured them, together with submissive behavior and eating of the local celery plant. She later attributed her success with habituating gorillas to her experience working as an occupational therapist with children with autism. Like George Schaller, Fossey relied greatly on individual &quot;noseprints&quot; for identification, initially via sketching and later by camera.

Fossey had arrived in the Congo in locally turbulent times. Known as the Belgian Congo until its independence in June 1960, unrest and rebellion plagued the new government until 1965, when Lieutenant General Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, by then commander-in-chief of the national army, seized control of the country and declared himself president for five years during what is now called the Congo Crisis. During the political upheaval, a rebellion and battles took place in the Kivu Province. On July 9, 1967, soldiers arrived at the camp to escort Fossey and her research workers down, and she was detained at Rumangabo for two weeks. Fossey eventually escaped through bribery to Walter Baumgärtel&#x27;s Travellers Rest Hotel in Kisoro, where her escort was arrested by the Ugandan military.
Advised by the Ugandan authorities not to return to Congo, after meeting Leakey in Nairobi, Fossey agreed with him against US Embassy advice to restart her study on the Rwandan side of the Virungas. In Rwanda, Fossey had met local American expatriate Rosamond Carr, who introduced her to Belgian local Alyette DeMunck; DeMunck had a local&#x27;s knowledge of Rwanda and offered to find Fossey a suitable site for study.

==Conservation work in Rwanda==
On September 24, 1967, Fossey founded the Karisoke Research Center, a remote rainforest camp nestled in Ruhengeri province in the saddle of two volcanoes. For the research center&#x27;s name, Fossey used &quot;Kari&quot; for the first four letters of Mount Karisimbi that overlooked her camp from the south, and &quot;soke&quot; for the last four letters of Mount Bisoke, the slopes of which rose to the north, directly behind the camp. Established up Mount Bisoke, the defined study area covered . She became known by locals as Nyirmachabelli, or Nyiramacibiri, roughly translated as &quot;The woman who lives alone on the mountain.&quot;

Unlike the gorillas from the Congo side of the Virungas, the Karisoke area gorillas had never been partially habituated by Schaller&#x27;s study; they knew humans only as poachers, and it took longer for Fossey to be able to study the Karisoke gorillas at a close distance. Fossey attempted to habituate the gorillas by copying their actions. Over time the gorillas became accustomed to Fossey. As she explained to the BBC in 1984: &quot;I&#x27;m an inhibited persona and I felt that the gorillas were somewhat inhibited as well, so I imitated their natural, normal behaviour like feeding, munching on celery stalks or scratching myself.&quot;
Fossey made discoveries about gorillas including how females transfer from group to group over the decades, gorilla vocalization, hierarchies and social relationships among groups, rare infanticide, gorilla diet, and how gorillas recycle nutrients. Fossey&#x27;s research was funded by the Wilkie Foundation and the Leakey Home, with primary funding from the National Geographic Society.

In 1970, she appeared on the cover of National Geographic Magazine, which brought tremendous attention to her work.

Fossey was often hostile to Africans who entered into the protected area, even shooting roaming cattle.

By 1980, Fossey, who had obtained her PhD at Cambridge University in the UK, was recognized as the world&#x27;s leading authority on the physiology and behavior of mountain gorillas, defining gorillas as being &quot;dignified, highly social, gentle giants, with individual personalities, and strong family relationships.&quot; Fossey lectured as professor at Cornell University in 1981–83. Her bestselling book &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot; was praised by Nikolaas Tinbergen, the Dutch ethologist and ornithologist who won the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Her book remains the best-selling book about gorillas.

Many research students left after not being able to cope with the cold, dark, and extremely muddy conditions around Karisoke on the slopes of the Virunga Volcanoes, where paths usually had to be cut through six-foot-tall grass with a machete.

===Opposition to poaching===
While hunting had been illegal in the national park of the Virunga Volcanoes in Rwanda since the 1920s, the law was rarely enforced by park conservators, who were often bribed by poachers and paid a salary less than Fossey&#x27;s own African staff. On three occasions, Fossey wrote that she witnessed the aftermath of the capture of infant gorillas at the behest of the park conservators for zoos; since gorillas will fight to the death to protect their young, the kidnappings would often result in up to 10 adult gorillas&#x27; deaths. Through the Digit Fund, Fossey financed patrols to destroy poachers&#x27; traps in the Karisoke study area. In four months in 1979, the Fossey patrol, consisting of four African staffers, destroyed 987 poachers&#x27; traps in the research area&#x27;s vicinity. The official Rwandan national park guards, consisting of 24 staffers, did not eradicate any poachers&#x27; traps during the same period. In the eastern portion of the park not patrolled by Fossey, poachers virtually eradicated all the park&#x27;s elephants for ivory and killed more than a dozen gorillas.

Fossey helped in the arrest of several poachers, some of whom served prison sentences.

In 1978, Fossey attempted to prevent the export of two young gorillas, Coco and Pucker, from Rwanda to the zoo in Cologne, Germany. During the capture of the infants at the behest of the Cologne Zoo and Rwandan park conservator, 20 adult gorillas had been killed. The infant gorillas were given to Fossey by the park conservator of the Virunga Volcanoes for treatment of injuries suffered during their capture and captivity. With considerable effort, she restored them to a semblance of health. Over Fossey&#x27;s objections, the gorillas were shipped to Cologne, where they lived nine years in captivity, both dying in the same month. She viewed the holding of animals in &quot;prison&quot; (zoos) for the entertainment of people as unethical.

While gorillas from rival groups on the mountains that were not part of Fossey&#x27;s study had often been found poached five to ten at a time, and had spurred Fossey to conduct her own anti-poaching patrols, Fossey&#x27;s study groups had not been direct victims of poaching until Fossey&#x27;s favorite gorilla, Digit, was killed in 1978. Later that year, the silverback of Digit&#x27;s Group 4, named for Fossey&#x27;s Uncle Bert, was shot in the heart while trying to save his son, Kweli, from being seized by poachers cooperating with the Rwandan park conservator. Kweli&#x27;s mother, Macho, was also killed in the raid, but, as a result of Uncle Bert&#x27;s intervention, Kweli was not captured; however, three-year-old Kweli died, slowly and painfully, of gangrene, from being brushed by a poacher&#x27;s bullet.

According to Fossey&#x27;s letters, ORTPN (the Rwandan national park system), the World Wildlife Fund, African Wildlife Foundation, Fauna Preservation Society, the Mountain Gorilla Project and some of her former students tried to wrest control of the Karisoke research center from her for the purpose of tourism, by portraying her as unstable. In her last two years, Fossey claimed not to have lost any gorillas to poachers; however, the Mountain Gorilla Project, which was supposed to patrol the Mount Sabyinyo area, tried to cover up gorilla deaths caused by poaching and diseases transmitted through tourists. Nevertheless, these organizations received most of the public donations directed toward gorilla conservation. The public often believed their money would go to Fossey, who was struggling to finance her anti-poaching and anti-bushmeat hunting patrols, while organizations collecting in her name put it into tourism projects and, as she put it, &quot;to pay the airfare of so-called conservationists who will never go on anti-poaching patrols in their life.&quot; Fossey described the two philosophies as her own &quot;active conservation&quot; or the international conservation groups&#x27; &quot;theoretical conservation.&quot;

===Killing of Digit and escalating tensions===
Sometime during the day on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1977, Fossey&#x27;s favorite gorilla, Digit, was killed by poachers. As the sentry of study group 4, he defended the group against six poachers and their dogs, who ran across the gorilla study group while checking antelope traplines. Digit took five spear wounds in ferocious self-defense and managed to kill one of the poachers&#x27; dogs, allowing the other 13 members of his group to escape. Digit was decapitated, and his hands cut off for ashtrays. He was twelve years old. After his mutilated body was discovered by research assistant Ian Redmond, Fossey&#x27;s group captured one of the killers. He revealed the names of his five accomplices, three of whom were later imprisoned. Fossey later described Digit&#x27;s killing as the &quot;saddest event in all my years of sharing the daily lives of mountain gorilla.&quot;

The event plunged Fossey into depression. She isolated herself in her cabin, consuming large amounts of alcohol and cigarettes.

Fossey subsequently created the Digit Fund (now the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International in the US) to raise money for anti-poaching patrols. In addition, a consortium of international gorilla funds arose to accept donations in light of Digit&#x27;s death and increased attention on poaching. Fossey mostly opposed the efforts of the international organizations, which she felt inefficiently directed their funds towards more equipment for Rwandan park officials, some of whom were alleged to have ordered some of the gorilla poachings in the first place.

The deaths of some of her most studied gorillas caused Fossey to devote more of her attention to preventing poaching and less on scientific publishing and research. Fossey became more intense in protecting the gorillas and began to employ more direct tactics: she and her staff cut animal traps almost as soon as they were set; frightened, captured and humiliated the poachers; held their cattle for ransom; burnt their hunting camps and even burnt the mats from their houses.

Fossey was reported to have captured and held Rwandans she suspected of poaching. She allegedly beat a poacher&#x27;s testicles with stinging nettles. In a letter to a friend, she wrote, &quot;We stripped him and spread eagled him and lashed the holy blue sweat out of him with nettle stalks and leaves...&quot; She even reportedly kidnapped and held for ransom the child of a suspected poacher. After her murder, Fossey&#x27;s &quot;National Geographic&quot; editor, Mary Smith, told Shlachter that on visits to the United States, Fossey would &quot;load up on firecrackers, cheap toys and magic tricks as part of her method to mystify the (Africans) in order to hold them at bay.&quot; She wore face-masks and pretended to practice black magic to scare away poachers.

Writing in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 2002, the journalist Tunku Varadarajan described Fossey at the end of her life as colorful, controversial, and &quot;a racist alcoholic who regarded her gorillas as better than the African people who lived around them&quot;.

==Murder and burial==

In the early morning of December 27, 1985, Fossey was discovered murdered in the bedroom of her cabin located at the far edge of the camp in the Virunga Mountains, Rwanda. Her body was found face-up near the two beds where she slept, roughly away from a hole that her assailant(s) had apparently cut in the wall of the cabin. Wayne Richard McGuire, Fossey&#x27;s last research assistant at Karisoke, was summoned to the scene by Fossey&#x27;s house servant and found her bludgeoned to death, reporting that &quot;when I reached down to check her vital signs, I saw her face had been split, diagonally, with one machete blow.&quot; The cabin was littered with broken glass and overturned furniture, with a 9mm handgun and ammunition beside her on the floor. Her cabin had been ransacked. However, robbery was evidently not the motive for the crime, as Fossey&#x27;s valuables were still in the cabin, including her passport, handguns, and thousands of dollars in U.S. bills and traveler&#x27;s checks.

The last entry in her diary read:
Fossey is buried at Karisoke, in a site that she herself had constructed for her deceased gorilla friends. She was buried in the gorilla graveyard next to Digit, and near many gorillas killed by poachers. Memorial services were also held in New York City, Washington, D.C., and California.

===Aftermath===
After Fossey&#x27;s murder, her entire staff were arrested. This included Rwandan Emmanuel Rwelekana, a tracker who had been fired from his job after he allegedly tried to kill Fossey with a machete, according to the government&#x27;s account of McGuire&#x27;s trial. All were later released, except Rwelekana, who was later found dead in prison, allegedly having hanged himself.

Rwandan courts later tried and convicted Wayne McGuire &quot;in absentia&quot; for her murder. The alleged motive was that McGuire murdered Fossey in order to steal the manuscript of the sequel to her 1983 book, &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot;. At the trial, investigators said McGuire was not happy with his own research and wanted to use &quot;any dishonest means possible&quot; to complete his work. McGuire had returned to the United States in July 1987, and because no extradition treaty existed between the U.S. and Rwanda at that time, McGuire did not return to Rwanda. His penalty was death by shooting.

Following his return to the U.S., McGuire gave a brief statement at a news conference in Century City, Los Angeles, saying Fossey had been his &quot;friend and mentor&quot;, calling her death &quot;tragic&quot; and the charges &quot;outrageous&quot;. Thereafter, McGuire was largely absent from public notice until 2005, when news broke that he had been accepted for a job with the Health and Human Services division of the State of Nebraska. The job offer was revoked upon discovery of his relation to the Fossey case.

Other theories about her murder persist: that the perpetrators were poachers taking revenge, that Zaïrois hit men were hired to kill her for her presumed-valuable research notes, that there were political motives, that she was killed by a panicked burglar who was hired to steal a protective talisman that Fossey had taken from a poacher, that her killer was hired by a person or group whose interests would be negatively affected by Fossey&#x27;s campaign to prevent exploitation of the Parc National de Volcans, or that Fossey had potentially damning evidence of gold-smugglers.

A will purporting to be Fossey&#x27;s bequeathed all of her estate (including the proceeds from the film &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot;) to the Digit Fund to underwrite anti-poaching patrols. Fossey did not mention her family in the will, which was unsigned. Her mother, Hazel Fossey Price, successfully challenged the will. New York State Supreme Court Justice Swartwood threw out the will and awarded the estate to her mother, including about $4.9 million in royalties from a recent book and upcoming movie, stating that the document &quot;was simply a draft of her purported will and not a will at all.&quot; Price said she was working on a project to preserve the work her daughter had done for the mountain gorillas in Rwanda.

In 2001, Protais Zigiranyirazo, who was suspected of ordering Fossey&#x27;s murder, was arrested in Belgium for his alleged role in the planning of the 1994 Rwandan genocide. 

==Personal life and views==

During her African safari, Fossey met Alexie Forrester, the brother of a Rhodesian she had been dating in Louisville; Fossey and Forrester later became engaged. In her later years, Fossey became involved with &quot;National Geographic&quot; photographer Bob Campbell after a year of working together at Karisoke, with Campbell promising to leave his wife. Eventually the pair grew apart through her dedication to the gorillas and Karisoke, along with his need to work further afield and on his marriage.

In 1970, studying for her Ph.D. at Darwin College, University of Cambridge, she discovered she was pregnant and had an abortion, later commenting that &quot;you can&#x27;t be a cover girl for &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine and be pregnant.&quot; She graduated with a Doctor of Philosophy in Zoology in 1976. Fossey had other relationships throughout the years and always had a love for children.

Since Fossey would rescue any abused or abandoned animal she saw in Africa or near Karisoke, she acquired a menagerie in the camp, including a monkey who lived in her cabin, Kima, and a dog, Cindy.

Fossey held Christmas parties every year for her researchers, staffers, and their families, and she developed a friendship with Jane Goodall.

===Health===
Fossey had been troubled by lung problems from an early age and, later in her life, developed advanced emphysema brought on by years of heavy cigarette smoking. As the debilitating disease progressed—further aggravated by the high mountain elevation and damp climate—Fossey found it increasingly difficult to conduct field research, frequently experiencing shortness of breath and requiring the help of an oxygen tank when climbing or hiking long distances.

===Opposition to tourism===
Fossey strongly opposed wildlife tourism, as gorillas are susceptible to human anthroponotic diseases like influenza from which they have limited immunity. Fossey reported several cases in which gorillas died because of diseases spread by tourists. She also viewed tourism as an interference into their natural wild behavior. Fossey also criticized tourist programs, often paid for by international conservation organizations, for interfering with both her research and the peace of the mountain gorillas&#x27; habitat, and was concerned that Jane Goodall was inappropriately changing her study of chimpanzees&#x27; behavior.

, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International promotes tourism, which they say helps to create a stable and sustainable local community dedicated to protecting the gorillas and their habitat. In addition to scientific research, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund&#x27;s Ellen DeGeneres Campus also supports Rwanda&#x27;s ecotourism sector.

==Legacy==
After her death, Fossey&#x27;s Digit Fund in the US was renamed the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International. The Karisoke Research Center is operated by the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International, and continues the daily gorilla monitoring and protection that she started.

Fossey is generally credited with reversing the downward trend in the mountain gorilla population. Due to poaching, gorilla populations declined from 450 in 1960 to just 250 in 1981. However, Fossey&#x27;s &quot;war on poaching&quot; saw the final confirmed killing of a gorilla in 1983. By the late 1980s, the population had risen to 280. It continues to rise, as of 1987. Fossey&#x27;s research, and the following publicity, spawned &quot;gorilla tourism&quot;.

Between Fossey&#x27;s death and the 1994 Rwandan genocide, Karisoke was directed by former students, some of whom had opposed her. During the genocide and subsequent period of insecurity, the camp was completely looted and destroyed. Today only remnants are left of her cabin. During the civil war, the Virunga National Park was filled with refugees, and illegal logging destroyed vast areas.

In 2014, the 82nd anniversary of Fossey&#x27;s birth was commemorated by a Google Doodle.

===In media and books===
Universal Studios bought the film rights to &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot; from Fossey in 1985, and Warner Bros. Studios bought the rights to &quot;the Dark Romance of Dian Fossey&quot;, a work by Harold T. P. Hayes, despite its having been severely criticized by Rosamond Carr. As a result of a legal battle between the two studios, a co-production was arranged. Portions of the story and the Hayes article were adapted for the film &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot;, starring Sigourney Weaver, who played Fossey, along with Bryan Brown, and John Omirah Miluwi. The book covers Fossey&#x27;s scientific career in great detail and omits material on her personal life, such as her affair with photographer Bob Campbell, played by Bryan Brown. In the film, the affair with Campbell forms a major subplot. The Hayes article preceding the movie portrayed Fossey as a woman obsessed with gorillas, who would stop at nothing to protect them. The film includes scenes of Fossey&#x27;s ruthless dealings with poachers, including a scene in which she sets fire to a poacher&#x27;s home. Weaver won a Golden Globe Award and earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actress for her performance in the film.

Fossey is considered a saint by the God&#x27;s Gardeners, a fictional religious sect that is the focus of Margaret Atwood&#x27;s 2009 novel &quot;The Year of the Flood&quot;.

In December 2017, &quot;Dian Fossey: Secrets in the Mist&quot;, a three-hour series, aired on the National Geographic Channel. The series tells the story of Fossey&#x27;s life, work, murder and legacy, using archive footage and still images, interviews with people who knew and worked with her, specially shot footage, and reconstruction.

In &quot;A Forest in the Clouds: My Year Among the Mountain Gorillas in the Remote Enclave of Dian Fossey&quot; (Pegasus Books, 2018) John Fowler describes Fossey&#x27;s remote mountain gorilla camp, Karisoke Research Center, a few years prior to her murder, telling the story of the unraveling of Fossey&#x27;s Rwandan facility as pressures mount in an effort to extricate Fossey from her domain. Fowler represents Fossey as a chain-smoking, hard-drinking woman who bullied her staff and students in her efforts to hold on to her reputation as scientist and savior of the mountain gorillas.

<doc id="168285" wikidata="Q552819" url="?curid=168285" title="Hank Williams Jr.">
<text>Randall Hank Williams (born May 26, 1949), known professionally as Hank Williams Jr. or Bocephus, is an American singer-songwriter and musician. His musical style has been described as a blend of rock, blues, and country. He is the son of country musician Hank Williams and the father of musicians Holly Williams and Hank Williams III, and the grandfather of Coleman Williams. He is also the half-brother of Jett Williams.

Williams began his career following in his famed father&#x27;s footsteps, covering his father&#x27;s songs and imitating his father&#x27;s style. Williams&#x27; first television appearance was in a December 1963 episode of &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, in which at age fourteen he sang several songs associated with his father. Later that year, he was a guest star on &quot;Shindig!&quot;

As Williams struggled to define his own voice and place within the country music genre, his style began slowly to evolve. His career was interrupted by a near-fatal fall while Williams was climbing Ajax Peak in Montana on August 8, 1975. After an extended recovery, he rebuilt his career in both the country rock and outlaw country scenes. As a multi-instrumentalist, Williams&#x27; repertoire of musical instrument skills includes guitar, bass guitar, upright bass, steel guitar, banjo, dobro, piano, keyboards, saxophone, harmonica, fiddle, and drums. In 2020, Williams Jr. was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Williams was born Randall Hank Williams on May 26, 1949, in Shreveport, Louisiana. His father nicknamed him Bocephus (after Grand Ole Opry comedian Rod Brasfield&#x27;s ventriloquist dummy). After his father&#x27;s death in 1953, he was raised by his mother, Audrey Williams.

While he was a child, Williams was influenced by a number of contemporary musicians who visited his family and taught him various musical instruments and styles. Among these figures of influence were Merle Haggard, Johnny Cash, Fats Domino, Earl Scruggs, Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Williams first stepped onto the stage and sang his father&#x27;s songs when he was eight years old.

He attended John Overton High School in Nashville, Tennessee, where he would bring his guitar to music class and play for pep rallies and performances with the choir.

== Career ==
In 1964, Williams made his recording debut with &quot;Long Gone Lonesome Blues&quot;, one of his father&#x27;s many classic songs.

He provided the singing voice of his father in the 1964 film &quot;Your Cheatin&#x27; Heart.&quot; He also recorded an album of duets with recordings of his father.

===A change in appearance and musical direction===
Although Williams&#x27; recordings earned him numerous country hits throughout the 1960s and early 1970s with his role as a &quot;Hank Williams impersonator&quot;, he became disillusioned and severed ties with his mother.

By the mid-1970s Williams began to pursue a musical direction that would eventually make him a superstar. While recording a series of moderately successful songs, Williams began a pattern of heavy drug and alcohol abuse. Upon moving to Alabama, in an attempt to refocus both his creative energy and his troubled personal life, Williams began playing music with Southern rock and Outlaw country musicians including Waylon Jennings, Toy Caldwell, and Charlie Daniels. &quot;Hank Williams Jr. and Friends&quot; (1975), often considered his watershed album, was the product of these then-groundbreaking collaborations.

On August 8, 1975, Williams was nearly killed while mountain climbing in southwestern Montana. While climbing Ajax Peak on the continental divide (Idaho border) west of Jackson, the snow beneath Williams collapsed and he fell almost onto rock, causing multiple severe skull and facial fractures. Williams spent two years recovering, re-learning how to talk and sing, and undergoing 17 surgeries to repair his skull and reconstruct his face. The accident was chronicled in the semi-autobiographical, made-for-television film &quot;Living Proof: The Hank Williams Jr. Story&quot;. To hide his scars and disfigurement from the accident, Williams grew a beard and began wearing sunglasses and a cowboy hat. The beard, hat, and sunglasses have since become Williams&#x27; signature look.

In 1977, Williams recorded and released &quot;One Night Stands&quot; and &quot;The New South&quot;, and worked closely with his old friend Waylon Jennings on the song &quot;Once and For All&quot;. In 1980, he appeared on the PBS show &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; during Season 5, along with the Shake Russell-Dana Cooper Band.

===Country music career===

In 1976, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that Williams&#x27; &quot;mainstream country material has always been among Nashville″s best&quot;.

He was prolific throughout the 1980s, sometimes recording and releasing two albums a year. &quot;Family Tradition&quot;, &quot;Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound&quot;, &quot;Habits Old and New&quot;, &quot;Rowdy&quot;, &quot;The Pressure Is On&quot;, &quot;High Notes&quot;, &quot;Strong Stuff&quot;, &quot;Man of Steel&quot;, &quot;Major Moves&quot;, &quot;Five-O&quot;, &quot;Montana Cafe&quot;, and many others resulted in a long string of hits.

Between 1979 and 1992, Williams released 21 albums—18 studio albums and three compilations—that were all certified at least gold by the RIAA. Between 1979 and 1990, he enjoyed a string of 30 Top Ten singles on the Billboard Country charts, including eight No. 1 singles, for a total of 44 Top Ten singles, including a total of 10 No. 1 singles, during his career.

In 1982, he had nine albums simultaneously on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, all of which were original works and not compilations. In 1987–88, Williams was named Entertainer of the Year by the Country Music Association. In 1987, 1988, and 1989, he won the same award from the Academy of Country Music. The pinnacle album of his acceptance and popularity was &quot;Born to Boogie&quot;.

During the 1980s, Williams Jr. became a country music superstar known for catchy anthems and hard-edged, rock-influenced country. During the late 1970s and into the mid-1980s, Williams&#x27; songs constantly flew into the number one or number two spots, with songs such as &quot;Family Tradition&quot;, &quot;Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound&quot;, &quot;Old Habits&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin, &quot;Born to Boogie&quot;, and &quot;My Name Is Bocephus&quot;.

The hit single &quot;Wild Streak&quot; (1987) was co-written by Houston native Terri Sharp, for which Williams and Sharp both earned gold records. In 1988, he released a Southern pride song, &quot;If the South Woulda Won&quot;. The reference is to a notional Southern victory in the Civil War.

His 1989 hit &quot;There&#x27;s a Tear in My Beer&quot; was a duet with his father created using electronic merging technology. The song was written by his father, and had been previously recorded with Hank Williams playing the guitar as the sole instrument. The music video for the song combined existing television footage of Hank Williams performing, onto which electronic merging technology impressed the recordings of Williams, which then made it appear as if he were actually playing with his father. The video was both a critical and commercial success. It was named &quot;Video of the Year&quot; by both the Country Music Association and the Academy of Country Music. Williams would go on to win a Grammy Award in 1990 for Best Country Vocal Collaboration.

He is well known for his hit &quot;A Country Boy Can Survive&quot; and as the performer of the theme song for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, based on his 1984 hit &quot;All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight&quot;. In 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994, Williams&#x27; opening themes for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; earned him four Emmy Awards. 

In 2000, he provided the voice of Injun Joe in &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;. In 2001, Williams Jr. co-wrote his classic hit &quot;A Country Boy Can Survive&quot; after 9/11, renaming it &quot;America Can Survive&quot;. In 2004, Williams was featured prominently on &quot;CMT Outlaws&quot;. In 2006, he starred at the Summerfest concert.

He has also made a cameo appearance along with Larry the Cable Guy, Kid Rock, and Charlie Daniels in Gretchen Wilson&#x27;s music video for the song &quot;All Jacked Up&quot;. He and Kid Rock also appeared in Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Redneck Woman&quot; video. Hank also had a small part of Kid Rock&#x27;s video &quot;Only God Knows Why&quot;, and &quot;Redneck Paradise&quot;.

In April 2009, Williams released a new single, &quot;Red, White &amp; Pink-Slip Blues&quot;, which peaked at number 43 on the country charts. The song was the lead-off single to Williams&#x27; album &quot;127 Rose Avenue&quot;. The album debuted and peaked at number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart. Also in July 2009, &quot;127 Rose Avenue&quot; was announced as his last album for Curb Records.

== Musical style ==
As a multi-instrumentalist, Williams&#x27; repertoire of skills includes guitar, bass guitar, upright bass, steel guitar, banjo, Resonator guitar, piano, keyboards, saxophone, harmonica, fiddle, and drums. Williams began his recording career performing covers of his father&#x27;s songs. Despite catering to the country music market, Williams preferred to listen to rhythm and blues. Williams also recorded singles under the name Luke the Drifter Jr. (a reference to his father&#x27;s alias &quot;Luke the Drifter&quot;), rock and roll singles under the aliases Rockin&#x27; Randall and Bocephus (a nickname given to him by his father), and blues under the name Thunderhead Hawkins. Williams&#x27; music has been categorized as country rock, blues rock, southern rock, outlaw country, rockabilly and rock and roll.

== Legacy ==
Artists who have cited Hank Williams Jr. as an influence include Delta Generators, Walker Hayes, Sam Hunt, Davin James, Shooter Jennings, Wayne Mills, The Sickstring Outlaws and Gretchen Wilson.

On April 10, 2006, CMT honored Williams with the Johnny Cash Visionary Award, presenting it to him at the 2006 CMT Music Awards. On November 11, 2008, Williams was honored as a BMI Icon at the 56th annual BMI Country Awards. The artists and songwriters named BMI Icons have had &quot;a unique and indelible influence on generations of music makers&quot;.

In 2015, Williams was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame. On August 12, 2020, Williams was selected to be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
His daughter Katherine Williams-Dunning, the only one of his five children to not pursue a music career, died in a car crash on June 13, 2020, at age 27. His son Shelton performs as Hank Williams III; his other children include Holly Williams who is also a musician, Sam Williams, also a musician, as is his grandson Coleman Williams (Hank III&#x27;s son), who performs under the sobriquet &quot;IV&quot;. His wife Mary Jane Thomas died on March 22, 2022, aged 58, after complications from a medical procedure. On September 9, 2023, Williams married his long-time friend since 2003, Brandi. The couple became engaged on Mother&#x27;s Day of that same year.

==Politics==
Williams is a registered Republican and been politically involved with the party for decades. In the 2000 U.S. presidential election, he rerecorded his song &quot;We Are Young Country&quot; to &quot;This is Bush-Cheney Country&quot;. On October 15, 2008, at a rally in Virginia Beach for Republican presidential nominee John McCain, he performed &quot;McCain-Palin Tradition&quot;, a song in support of McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin. He has contributed to federal election campaigns, mostly to Republicans, including Michele Bachmann&#x27;s 2012 presidential campaign. However, he has donated to some Democrats in the past, most notably Jim Cooper and John S. Tanner.

In November 2008, Williams considered a run for the 2012 Republican nomination as a U.S. Senator from Tennessee for the seat held by GOP incumbent Bob Corker, although his publicist said regarding Williams &quot;no announcement has been made&quot;. Williams ultimately did not run.

===2011 &quot;Fox and Friends&quot; controversy===
In an October 3, 2011, interview with Fox News Channel&#x27;s &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot;, Williams discussed a June golf game where President Barack Obama and Republican House Speaker John Boehner had teamed against Vice President Joe Biden and Ohio Governor John Kasich, saying the match was &quot;one of the biggest political mistakes ever&quot;. When asked why the golf game troubled him, Williams stated, &quot;Come on. That&#x27;d be like Hitler playing golf with Netanyahu ... in the shape this country is in?&quot; He also said that the President and Vice President were &quot;the enemy&quot; and compared them to &quot;the Three Stooges&quot;. Later, anchor Gretchen Carlson said to him, &quot;You used the name of one of the most hated people in all of the world to describe, &quot;I think&quot;, the president.&quot; Williams replied, &quot;Well, that is true. But I&#x27;m telling you like it is.&quot; As a result of his statements, ESPN dropped Williams&#x27; opening song from its &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; broadcast of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers versus the Indianapolis Colts and replaced it with Ken Block and Andrew Copeland of Sister Hazel singing the national anthem.

Williams later said his analogy was &quot;extreme – but it was to make a point&quot;, and &quot;some of us have strong opinions and are often misunderstood ... I was simply trying to explain how stupid it seemed to me – how ludicrous that pairing was. They&#x27;re polar opposites, and it made no sense. They don&#x27;t see eye to eye and never will&quot;. Additionally, Williams said he has &quot;always respected the office of the president ... Working-class people are hurting – and it doesn&#x27;t seem like anybody cares. When both sides are high-fiving it on the ninth hole when everybody else is without a job – it makes a whole lot of us angry. Something has to change. The policies have to change&quot;. ESPN later said it was &quot;extremely disappointed&quot; in Williams&#x27; comments, and pulled his opening from that night&#x27;s broadcast.

Three days later, ESPN announced Williams and his song would not return to &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, ending the use of the song that had been part of the broadcast on both ABC and ESPN since 1989. Williams expressed defiance and indifference on his website, and said he was the one who had made the decision. &quot;After reading hundreds of e-mails, I have made MY decision,&quot; he wrote. &quot;By pulling my opening Oct 3rd, You (ESPN) stepped on the Toes of The First Amendment Freedom of Speech, so therefore Me, My Song, and All My Rowdy Friends are OUT OF HERE. It&#x27;s been a great run.&quot; Williams&#x27; son, Hank Williams III, stayed neutral in the debate, telling TMZ.com that most musicians, including his father, are &quot;not worthy&quot; of a political discussion.

After his song was pulled from &quot;Monday Night Football,&quot; Williams recorded a song criticizing Obama, ESPN and &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot;, titled &quot;Keep the Change&quot;. He released the track on iTunes and via free download at his website. The song garnered over 180,000 downloads in two days.

Williams continued to make his opinions of Obama known and during a performance at the Iowa State Fair in August 2012, he called Obama a Muslim telling the crowd, &quot;We&#x27;ve got a Muslim president who hates farming, hates the military, hates the U.S. and we hate him!&quot;

<doc id="168290" wikidata="Q747687" url="?curid=168290" title="Homer's Odyssey (The Simpsons)">
<text>&quot;Homer&#x27;s Odyssey&quot; is the third episode of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on January 21, 1990. In this episode, Homer becomes a crusader for safety in Springfield and is promoted to safety inspector at Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. The episode was written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky and was the first &quot;Simpsons&quot; script to be completed, although it was the third episode produced.

==Plot==
Mrs. Krabappel takes Bart&#x27;s class on a field trip to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Distracted when Bart waves at him, Homer crashes an electric cart into a cooling vent and is fired. Homer searches for a new job without success. Feeling like a failure, he writes a note to his family and decides to commit suicide by tying a boulder to himself and jumping off a bridge.

His family hurries to the bridge to save him, but they are almost run over by a speeding truck. Homer pulls them to safety just in time, and he is suddenly filled with a new reason to live: to place a stop sign at the dangerous intersection. After successfully petitioning the city council, Homer embarks on a public safety crusade that involves placing speed bumps and warning signs throughout the town.

Inspired to use his new safety efforts in order to not give up on finding a new job, Homer takes on the biggest danger in Springfield, the nuclear power plant. After Homer rallies people to his cause, Mr. Burns decides to end the furor he is creating by offering him a new position as the plant safety inspector, along with a higher salary. Homer, torn between his principles and his livelihood, tearfully tells his followers that they must fight their battles on their own from this point on, and takes the job.

==Production==
Waylon Smithers makes his first appearance in this episode, although he can be heard over a speaker in the series premiere. In his first visual appearance, he was mistakenly animated with the wrong color and was made an African American by Györgyi Peluce, the color stylist. David Silverman has claimed that Smithers was always intended to be Mr. Burns&#x27;s &quot;white sycophant&quot;, and the staff thought it &quot;would be a bad idea to have a black subservient character&quot; and so switched him to his intended color for his next episode. Smithers&#x27;s skin tone was later explained as an &quot;extreme tan&quot;.

Blinky the Three-Eyed Fish makes a brief cameo in this episode; he later becomes of importance in episode four of the second season, &quot;Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish&quot;. Also notable is that Marge was originally called Juliette in this script as a homage to &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.
Homer&#x27;s middle initial, J, is mentioned for the first time in this episode. According to Matt Groening, it was a reference to Bullwinkle J. Moose. Additionally, the following characters made their first appearances in this episode: Otto Mann, Chief Wiggum, Jasper Beardley, Sam &amp; Larry, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Winfield and Sherri and Terri.

The episode&#x27;s title comes from the Greek epic poem &quot;Odyssey&quot;, traditionally attributed to the legendary poet Homer. On the bus, Bart sings &quot;John Henry was a Steel Driving Man&quot;, an American folk-song about a 19th-century hero of the working-class, building railroads across the West Virginia mountains.

==Reception==
In its original broadcast, &quot;Homer&#x27;s Odyssey&quot; finished twenty-eight in ratings for the week of January 15–21, 1990, with a Nielsen rating of 14.9, equivalent to approximately 13.7 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, beating &quot;Married... with Children&quot;.

Since airing, the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, authors of the book &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide&quot;, said that &quot;the story rather fizzles out at the end, but there are many good moments, especially in the power plant&quot;.

Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that the episode is &quot;possibly the best of the [first six] shows&quot; and that it &quot;suffers a little from an odd tone, as the characters hadn&#x27;t become settled. Still, it seems surprisingly clever and witty.&quot;

In September 2001, in a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck rated the episode (of 5) and called it &quot;the first season at its worst&quot;, continuing that it was &quot;notable for introducing Mr. Burns and (a strangely African-American) Smithers, but otherwise boring and preachy&quot;.

==Home media==
The episode was released first on home video in the United Kingdom, as part of a VHS release titled &quot;The Simpsons Collection&quot;, in which it was paired with the sixth episode of the season, &quot;Moaning Lisa&quot;. In the United Kingdom, it was once re-released as part of a VHS boxed set of the complete first season, released in November 1999.

In the United States, the episode would finally see the home video release as a part of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; Season One DVD set, which was released on September 25, 2001. Groening, Archer, Kogen, and Wolodarsky participated in the DVD&#x27;s audio commentary. A digital edition of the series&#x27; first season was published December 20, 2010, in the United States containing the episode, through Amazon Video and iTunes.

<doc id="168292" wikidata="Q772035" url="?curid=168292" title="Indigo Girls">
<text>Indigo Girls are an American folk rock music duo from Atlanta, Georgia, United States, consisting of Amy Ray and Emily Saliers. The two met in elementary school and began performing together as high school students in Decatur, Georgia, part of the Atlanta metropolitan area. They started performing with the name Indigo Girls as students at Emory University, performing weekly at The Dugout, a bar in Emory Village.

They released a full-length record album entitled &quot;Strange Fire&quot; in 1987, and contracted with a major record company in 1988. After releasing nine albums with major record labels from 1987 through 2007, they formed the IG Recordings company in 2009 and resumed self-producing albums.

Outside of working on Indigo Girls–related projects, Ray has released solo albums and founded a non-profit recording label that promotes independent musicians. Saliers is an entrepreneur in the restaurant industry as well as a professional author; she also collaborates with her father, Don Saliers, in performing for special groups and causes. Saliers and Ray are both lesbians, though not a romantic couple, and are active in political and environmental causes. They are regarded as queer icons.

== Recording and touring ==
=== Early years ===
Amy Ray and Emily Saliers first met and got to know each other as students at Laurel Ridge Elementary School in DeKalb County, Georgia, just outside Decatur, Georgia, but were not close friends because Saliers was a grade older than Ray. While attending Shamrock High School (now Druid Hills Middle School), they became better acquainted, and started performing together, first as &quot;The B-Band&quot; and then as &quot;Saliers and Ray&quot;.

Saliers graduated and began attending Tulane University in Louisiana. A year later, Ray graduated high school and began attending Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. Homesick, both returned to Georgia and transferred to Emory University in Atlanta (where Saliers&#x27; father was a professor). 

By 1985, they had begun performing together again, this time as Indigo Girls. Saliers stated in a March 2007 National Public Radio &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot; interview, &quot;we needed a name and we went through the dictionary looking for words that struck us and was one.&quot;

Their first release in 1985 was a seven-inch single named &quot;Crazy Game&quot;, with the B-side &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Waiting (for Someone to Come Home)&quot;.
That same year, the Indigo Girls released a six-track extended play album named &quot;Indigo Girls&quot;, and in 1987 released their first full-length album, &quot;Strange Fire&quot;, recorded at John Keane Studio in Athens, Georgia, and including &quot;Crazy Game&quot;. With this release, they secured the services of Russell Carter, who remains their manager to the present; they had first approached him when the EP album was released, but he told them their songs were &quot;immature&quot; and they were not likely to get a record deal. &quot;Strange Fire&quot; apparently changed his opinion.

===Epic Records (1988–2006)===
The success of 10,000 Maniacs, Tracy Chapman, and Suzanne Vega encouraged Epic Records to enlist other folk-based female singer-songwriters; Epic signed the duo in 1988. Their first major-label release, also named &quot;Indigo Girls&quot;, which scored No. 22 on the album chart, included a new version of &quot;Land of Canaan&quot;, which was also on their 1985 EP album and on &quot;Strange Fire&quot;. Also on the self-titled release was their first hit &quot;Closer to Fine&quot; (a collaboration with Irish band Hothouse Flowers), which scored No. 52 on the popular music chart and No. 26 on the modern rock chart. They even managed one week on the mainstream rock album-oriented rock music chart at No. 48. In 1990, they won a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album.

Their second album, &quot;Nomads Indians Saints&quot;, went gold in December 1991 and included the hit song &quot;Hammer and a Nail&quot;, a No. 12 modern rock music track; it was not as successful as their first, which was certified platinum at about the same time. The Indigo Girls followed it with the live &quot;Back on the Bus, Y&#x27;all&quot; and 1992&#x27;s album &quot;Rites of Passage&quot;, featuring the song &quot;Galileo&quot;, the duo&#x27;s first top 10 modern rock music track (#10). During the accompanying tour in December, they invited on a few dates Siouxsie Sioux of Siouxsie and the Banshees as special guest to sing a couple of songs with them. They then recorded &quot;Swamp Ophelia&quot; in 1994, which went platinum in September 1996, and charted at No. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart.

In 1995, the Indigo Girls released a live, double CD, &quot;1200 Curfews&quot;. &quot;Shaming of the Sun&quot; was released in 1997 followed by &quot;Come on Now Social&quot; in 1999. &quot;Shaming of the Sun&quot; debuted at number seven on the Billboard charts, driven by the duo&#x27;s contribution to the Lilith Fair music festival tour. The track &quot;Shame on You&quot; received more airplay on adult alternative, top 40 and adult top 40 radio stations than any of their previous singles, although this seemed to be a peak in their crossover success.

&quot;Retrospective&quot;, a compilation album with two new tracks, was released in 2000 and &quot;Become You&quot; followed two years later. Their last Epic studio album was &quot;All That We Let In&quot;, released in 2004 with an accompanying tour. On June 14, 2005, they released &quot;Rarities&quot;, a collection of B-sides and rare tracks partially decided by fans&#x27; input, which fulfilled the album count obligation for their contract with Epic.

=== Hollywood Records (2006–07) ===

After departing Epic, the Indigo Girls signed a five-record deal with Hollywood Records. Their first (and only) Hollywood album, &quot;Despite Our Differences&quot;, produced by Mitchell Froom, was released on September 19, 2006. John Metzger from &quot;MusicBox Online&quot; described &quot;Despite our Differences&quot; as &quot;the most infectious, pop-infused set that the duo ever has managed to concoct. In fact, its melodies, harmonies, and arrangements are so ingratiating that the album carries the weight of an instant classic.&quot; Thom Jurek from &quot;AllMusic&quot; wrote: &quot;part of an emotional journey as complete as can be. More relevant than anyone dared expect. It&#x27;s accessible and moving and true. It&#x27;s their own brand of rock &amp; roll, hewn from over the years, that bears a signature that is now indelible. A moving, and utterly poetic offering.&quot;

After releasing &quot;Despite Our Differences&quot;, the Indigo Girls&#x27; contract was terminated by Hollywood Records during their 2007 tour.

=== Independent work (2007–present) ===

Following their break with Hollywood Records, the Indigo Girls announced their next record would be released independently. &quot;Poseidon and the Bitter Bug&quot; was released on March 24, 2009, from IG Recordings, the Indigo Girls&#x27; label, and distributed through Vanguard Records. This album is their first fully independent release since 1987&#x27;s &quot;Strange Fire&quot;, and their first two-CD set since 1995&#x27;s live album &quot;1200 Curfews&quot;; the first disc has the 10 tracks accompanied by a backing band, and the second includes the same 10 songs with only Ray and Saliers on vocals and acoustic guitars, and an additional track. On June 29, 2010 Indigo Girls&#x27; second full-length live album, &quot;Staring Down the Brilliant Dream&quot;, was released on IG Recordings/Vanguard Records. This was followed on October 12, 2010 with their first holiday album &quot;Holly Happy Days&quot;. Indigo Girls&#x27; thirteenth studio album, &quot;Beauty Queen Sister&quot;, was released on October 4, 2011, and their fourteenth studio album, &quot;One Lost Day&quot;, was released on June 2, 2015 (both on IG Recordings/Vanguard Records).

Beginning in 2017, the Indigo Girls have toured the United States performing their music arranged for symphony orchestra. After more than 50 performances, in 2018 they released a live double album entitled &quot;Indigo Girls Live with the University of Colorado Symphony Orchestra&quot;. In 2020, they followed this with the studio album &quot;Look Long&quot;.

== Songwriting and influences ==
Ray and Saliers do not ordinarily collaborate in writing songs. Saliers described herself as &quot;a lyric person. [...] I’ve always respected Joni Mitchell and Bob Dylan&quot;. Saliers said: &quot;Amy is much more a combination of music and lyrics. She really likes alternative rock a lot, and she likes the feel of certain kinds music as well as the lyrics. Amy is more stream-of-consciousness. She doesn’t censor herself at all; she just channels it through herself, so in her lyrics, she has tons of different kinds of images, sensual images, things of the earth, that connection to nature. Mine is a much more singer-songwriter intellectual narrative style. I take an idea and try to really pinpoint it, make it as clear as possible&quot;.

They write separately and work out the arrangements together. There are a few exceptions, mostly unreleased songs from their early, pre-Epic days: &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know Your Name&quot; and &quot;If You Live Like That.&quot; &quot;Blood Quantum&quot;, which appears on &quot;Honor: A Benefit for the Honor the Earth Campaign&quot; featured Ray&#x27;s verses and chorus and Saliers&#x27;s bridge. Finally, &quot;I&#x27;ll Give You My Skin&quot;, which appears both on &quot;Tame Yourself&quot; (a benefit album for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) and on the Indigo Girls release &quot;Rarities,&quot; is a collaborative work by Ray, Saliers, and Michael Stipe, which is doubly rare because Saliers and Ray usually write their songs without outside collaborators. For their 2002 release, &#x27;Become You,&#x27; Ray reported that they handed instruments back and forth to compose leads collaboratively, something they had never done before. In September 2020, the Indigo Girls released &quot;Long Ride&quot;, the first song Ray and Saliers had written together in 30 years.

== Touring band ==
The Indigo Girls have toured as a duo and with a band. In 1990, they toured with Atlanta band the Ellen James Society backing them; they have also toured with side players, with one distinct group from 1991 to 1998, a second from 1999 to 2009, members of which appeared on all of the Girls&#x27; subsequent albums and which re-formed as a live band in 2023, and a third from 2012 to 2016.

Saliers was a founding co-owner of Watershed Restaurant in Decatur, Georgia. She sold Watershed in 2018. Saliers was an initial investor in the Flying Biscuit Cafe in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2005, Saliers and her father, Don Saliers, a theology professor at Candler School of Theology at Emory University, released the book &quot;A Song to Sing, a Life to Live: Reflections on Music as Spiritual Practice&quot;. They promoted the release of the book together including several days of speaking and performing together at the Washington National Cathedral College in Washington D.C.

Ray has put out six solo albums, entitled &quot;Stag&quot;, &quot;Prom&quot;, &quot;Live from Knoxville&quot;, &quot;Didn&#x27;t It Feel Kinder&quot;, &quot;Amy Ray: Live MVP&quot;, &quot;Lung of Love&quot;, &quot;Goodnight Tender&quot; and &quot;Holler&quot; through Daemon. She has toured with both The Butchies and her bands The Volunteers and the Amy Ray Band. Saliers also released a solo album, &quot;Murmuration Nation&quot;, in 2017.

== Appearances in other media ==
Ray and Saliers appeared in the 1995 film &quot;Boys on the Side&quot;, playing short excerpts from their songs &quot;Joking&quot; and &quot;Southland in the Springtime&quot;, as well as singing &quot;Feliz Cumpleaños&quot; (&quot;Happy Birthday&quot; in Spanish) with the gathered group of friends during the birthday cake scene, and standing on the far side of several shots over the next few scenes. Neither had spoken lines. The duo also appear in the 2006 documentary &quot;Wordplay&quot;, where they discuss their reaction to appearing in a &quot;New York Times&quot; crossword puzzle and then begin to solve one together.

They performed onstage in the 1994 revival of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; in Atlanta, titled &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar: A Resurrection&quot;. Ray starred as Jesus with Saliers as Mary Magdalene. They later reprised their roles in stagings in Austin, at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival, and in Seattle.

Ray and Saliers made several cameo appearances on the sitcom &quot;Ellen&quot;; in the episode &quot;Womyn Fest&quot;, Ellen and her friends attend a feminist music festival and catch the end of a performance by the Indigo Girls.

The girls are mentioned multiple times in Stephen King&#x27;s 1995 novel &quot;Rose Madder&quot;, and Curtis Sittenfeld&#x27;s 2023 novel &quot;Romantic Comedy&quot;, as well as being name-dropped in various TV shows &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;Will and Grace&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot;, &quot;30 Rock&quot;, &quot;The Office&quot;, &quot;Squidbillies&quot;, &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;Harley Quinn&quot; and &quot;Nip\Tuck&quot;.

Their posters are seen on the British soap &quot;Brookside&quot; and the 1996 slasher film &quot;Scream&quot;.

The duo appeared onstage alongside standup comedian Tig Notaro during Notaro&#x27;s 2018 show &quot;Happy to be Here&quot; at The Heights in Houston, Texas, as a closing bit, performing one song.

In the 2023 film &quot;Barbie&quot;, Barbie sings along to &quot;Closer to Fine.&quot; The song appears three times in the film, as well as in its trailer.

A collection of Indigo Girls&#x27; songs is used in the jukebox musical movie &quot;Glitter and Doom&quot;, which has been touring movie festivals across North America. The film has no confirmed release date.

Indigo Girls are featured in &quot;Foreword: A Conversation with the Indigo Girls, Kathy Mattea, and Lyle Lovett&quot; in Brian T. Atkinson&#x27;s &quot;Love at the Five and Dime: The Songwriting Legacy of Nanci Griffith&quot; (Texas A&amp;M University Press, 2024).

== Personal lives ==
Both Ray and Saliers use she/her pronouns. They long identified themselves as lesbians, but more recently, Ray and Saliers have publicly commented that they are or previously have been sexually attracted to men in their lives, and that they identify as queer. More specifically, Ray has openly talked about her gender dysphoria and identifying as gender fluid, and the challenges she has felt in her own body. “I definitely still feel like a guy a lot of the time, but I guess I’ve just gotten to a place where like, ‘Well, I have fought really hard to be in this body and I’m just gonna stay here,’ and also felt somewhat evenly split between male and female to the point where I was like, ‘I don’t know if I can choose, like I think I’m gonna have to just live in the center,’” Ray said. Both Saliers and Ray have spoken openly about having internalized homophobia. Because of their engagements for LGBT rights, they are regarded as icons of the movement.

Amy Ray has long lived in the foothills of the North Georgia Mountains with her longtime partner, filmmaker Carrie Schrader from Seattle, whom she’s been with since 2001. In November 2013, Schrader gave birth to the couple’s child, Ozilline “Ozie” Graydon. Ozie is named after Ray’s grandmother, who was also the inspiration for the 1999 Indigo Girls song “Ozilline,” penned by Ray.

Saliers married her longtime girlfriend, former Indigo Girls tour manager Tristin Chipman, at New York City Hall in 2013. Chipman, a Canadian, is from Calgary, &quot;but she spent most of her adult life in Toronto,&quot; according to Saliers between songs when performing onstage in Vancouver in 2013. The couple have a daughter, Cleo, born in November 2012.

=== Political activism ===
The Indigo Girls have been politically active, championing the causes of and held benefit concerts for the environment, gay rights, the rights of Native Americans, and the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty. For many years they incorporated a recycling and public outreach program into their road tours by including Greenpeace representative Stephanie Fairbanks in their road crew. They helped Winona LaDuke establish Honor the Earth, an organization dedicated to creating support and education for native environmental issues. After performing on the activist-oriented Spitfire Tour in 1999, Ray and Saliers joined forces with The Spitfire Agency to develop the Honor The Earth Tour, which visits colleges and Native communities, and raises money for their non-profit of the same name. Ray and Saliers have also appeared at the annual SOA Watch rallies, the March for Women&#x27;s Lives, and several other rallies and protests.

In 2006 the Indigo Girls were featured in artist Pink&#x27;s album &quot;I&#x27;m Not Dead&quot; in the song &quot;Dear Mr. President&quot;, which Pink says is a political confrontation with George W. Bush about war, poverty, LGBT rights, abortion rights, and the No Child Left Behind Act. Returning the favor, Pink performed on the Indigo Girls&#x27; &quot;Rock and Roll Heaven&#x27;s Gate,&quot; which is about, among other things, sexism and heterosexism in the music industry.

In June 2007 the Indigo Girls were part of the multi-artist True Colors Tour 2007, on the tour&#x27;s Las Vegas stop which benefited the Human Rights Campaign and other organizations that provide support to the LGBT community. The Indigo Girls performed again on the True Colors Tour 2008.

In April 2013, in response to criticism from transgender activists, the Indigo Girls issued a statement that they would play at the Michigan Womyn&#x27;s Music Festival, but would protest the festival&#x27;s &quot;womyn-born womyn&quot; policy from the stage, would donate any money received to trans activism, and would not return to the festival without &quot;visible and concrete signs&quot; that the policy would be changed.

In November 2017, the Indigo Girls were nominated to &quot;Out&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;OUT100&quot; for 2017 in recognition of their work and their visibility.

The Indigo Girls are also members of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism and have worked with them on awareness campaigns.

<text>Blues Traveler is an American rock band that formed in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1987. They are known for their extensive use of segues in live performances, and could be considered a key part of the re-emerging jam band scene of the 1990s, spearheading the H.O.R.D.E. touring music festival.

The group comprises singer and harmonica player John Popper, guitarist Chan Kinchla, drummer Brendan Hill, bassist Tad Kinchla, and keyboardist Ben Wilson. Tad Kinchla and Ben Wilson joined the band following the death of original bassist Bobby Sheehan in 1999.

Their hit singles include &quot;But Anyway&quot;, &quot;Run-Around&quot;, and &quot;Hook&quot;, the latter two from their 1994 album &quot;four&quot; which sold several million copies. Fans are allowed to record the band&#x27;s concerts.

Sheehan&#x27;s death and Popper&#x27;s struggle with obesity put a damper on the group&#x27;s mainstream success, and A&amp;M dropped the band in 2002. In the years following, the band has attempted to work with a number of independent labels and record producers. 

Blues Traveler&#x27;s latest album, &quot;Traveler&#x27;s Blues&quot;, was released in July 2021, and was nominated by The Recording Academy for Best Traditional Blues album at the 2022 Grammy Awards.

==History==
===Formation===
The genesis of Blues Traveler was as a high school garage band formed in Princeton, New Jersey in the mid-1980s. Harmonicist, singer and guitarist John Popper and drummer Brendan Hill formed a group they called The Establishment (later renamed Blues Band) with Hill&#x27;s brother on bass and a rotating roster of guitarists. The band produced a few cassette tape demos. In addition to some original songs, their repertoire included upbeat covers of &quot;Gloria&quot; and &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;.

The group added guitarist and football player Chan Kinchla. Although he was a promising athlete, Kinchla decided to commit to playing music instead after a knee injury. Popper met bassist Bobby Sheehan and the two became good friends, with Sheehan becoming the new bass player for Blues Band in 1987.

The quartet held a basement jam session (later christened The Black Cat Jam) which spawned the core grooves for several songs on their first album. A black cat happened to be nearby, and the group took this as a sign and adopted the Black Cat as their mascot figure.

The group changed their name to Blues Traveler, taking the latter part from the name of the primary demon in the film &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, Gozer the Traveler.

===Early years===
After graduating from Princeton High School and moving to New York City, Popper, Hill, and Sheehan enrolled in the music program at The New School while Kinchla attended New York University. Blues Traveler began playing gigs along the New York-area club circuit, sometimes nightly; the most prominent contract was playing Wednesday nights at a club called the Wetlands. Another bar, The Nightingale, was a regular gig, and later became the setting for the song &quot;Defense and Desire&quot;.

The group shared an apartment on Bergen Street in Brooklyn, New York, along with their high school friend, singer Chris Barron. A second band that Popper and Hill founded, called The Trucking Company, soon became The Spin Doctors with Barron as their frontman. The two groups would often share the stage, playing non-stop concerts of multiple sets. Their first show together was at a Columbia University fraternity party. During this time, Blues Traveler acquired a devout follower, Gina-Z (subject of the band&#x27;s song &quot;Gina&quot;) who first became an unofficial &quot;band mom&quot; and later a tour manager, and is involved with the group&#x27;s business to the present day.

At one New York show they were discovered by an A&amp;M Records talent scout, Patrick Clifford, and the band signed their first recording contract. By 1990 all members had dropped out of college classes. The group also attracted the attention of David Graham, son of the world-famous concert promoter Bill Graham, and David Graham became the group&#x27;s manager. Blues Traveler then started a relentless touring schedule, expanding their reach up and down the east coast.

===First albums===
Blues Traveler released their self-titled debut album in 1990, with the song &quot;But Anyway&quot; getting airplay on college radio stations. The album included Joan Osborne on backing vocals on two tracks.

A second album, &quot;Travelers and Thieves&quot;, followed in 1991. Upon Bill Graham&#x27;s death that year, they released a live EP, &quot;On Tour Forever&quot;, as a tribute to Graham, which featured guitarist Carlos Santana.

Around this time, the mainstream national audience was exposed to Blues Traveler by television host David Letterman, who has introduced them as &quot;[his] favorite band&quot;. The band has since made more appearances on &quot;The Late Show&quot; than any musical artist. Letterman&#x27;s band leader Paul Shaffer has played on a number of Blues Traveler recordings.

In 1992, the group founded the H.O.R.D.E. festival as an alternative to others such as Lollapalooza, along with other bands such as Phish and Spin Doctors. Blues Traveler began recording their third album, &quot;Save His Soul&quot;. Recording was temporarily interrupted by John Popper&#x27;s motorcycle accident, although the band resumed touring shortly thereafter with Popper in a wheelchair. Two singles were released from the album, &quot;Defense &amp; Desire&quot; and &quot;Conquer Me&quot;, which reached No. 34 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

===Mainstream breakthrough===
The band&#x27;s fourth album, titled &quot;four&quot;, was produced by the team of Michael Barbiero and Steve Thompson and released in late 1994. The upbeat pop single &quot;Run-Around&quot; became the group&#x27;s first chart hit followed by &quot;Hook&quot;. &quot;Run-Around&quot; won a Grammy Award and broke a record for most weeks on the chart.

Blues Traveler appeared at Woodstock &#x27;94 and later became an opening act for The Rolling Stones. The band played on the 1995 season premiere of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as a last-minute replacement for Prince. They were featured in an episode of the sitcom &quot;Roseanne&quot;, and later recorded the show&#x27;s theme song for its final season. The 1996 comedy film &quot;Kingpin&quot; featured the group playing their song &quot;But Anyway&quot; during the closing credits.

The group recorded the Johnny Rivers song &quot;Secret Agent Man&quot; for the film &quot;Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls&quot; at Icon Recording Studios in St. Louis, Missouri and the Bob Seger song &quot;Get Out of Denver&quot; for the film &quot;Things to Do in Denver When You&#x27;re Dead&quot;, as well as Fats Domino&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Walkin for &quot;Rebel Highway: Cool and the Crazy&quot;. Several previously recorded Blues Traveler songs were included on film soundtracks, including &quot;The Last Seduction&quot;, &quot;Speed&quot;, &quot;Very Bad Things&quot;, &quot;White Man&#x27;s Burden&quot;, and &quot;The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs&quot;. The band also appeared in the film &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot; and on its soundtrack, playing &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m Wrong&quot;, an original composition with a classic blues-rock sound. Blues Traveler recorded the Sly &amp; the Family Stone song &quot;I Want to Take You Higher&quot; for the NORML compilation album &quot;Hempilation&quot; and the John Lennon song &quot;Imagine&quot; for the Lennon tribute album &quot;Working Class Hero&quot;. The original song &quot;Christmas&quot; was included on the benefit album &quot;A Very Special Christmas 3&quot;.

The double live album &quot;Live from the Fall&quot; was released in 1996. It featured recordings from the band&#x27;s autumn 1995 concerts and showcased the strength of the band&#x27;s live performances.

The next studio album, &quot;Straight On till Morning&quot;, also produced by Barbiero/Thompson, was released in 1997. It achieved platinum status, reaching number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, but did not perform as well as &quot;four&quot;. The single &quot;Carolina Blues&quot; peaked at number four on the Mainstream Rock Tracks.

By the end of 1998, the band had prepared a concept album called &quot;The Sun, The Storm and The Traveler&quot;, based on Aesop&#x27;s fable of &quot;The North Wind and the Sun&quot;, and they planned to record it after a recess in the fall of 1999. That summer, John Popper had emergency heart surgery due to artery blockage, forcing the band to cancel their annual July 4 Red Rocks shows at the last minute.

During the hiatus, Popper released a solo album with a backing band consisting of drummer Carter Beauford and members of the group Cycomotogoat.

The band made an appearance performing as themselves in the 1998 movie &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot; and the 1999 independent film &quot;Wildflowers&quot;, which had been filmed a couple of years earlier.

===Sheehan&#x27;s death and new lineup===
On August 20, 1999, Bobby Sheehan was found dead in his New Orleans, Louisiana, home, where he had been recording music with some friends the night before. Sheehan&#x27;s death was ruled an accidental drug overdose, with cocaine, Valium, and heroin found in his system.

The remaining members of Blues Traveler convened and agreed that Sheehan would have wanted them to continue as a band. Auditions for a new bassist were held in concert, and included Chan Kinchla&#x27;s younger brother Tad, who was unanimously determined to be the best choice for the role. Additionally, the band also auditioned for a permanent keyboardist—an action Sheehan had often urged. In January 2000, Ben Wilson of the jump blues band Big Dave &amp; the Ultrasonics was chosen, and has since become a central contributor to the band&#x27;s songwriting.

The band discarded their concept album material, instead releasing a smaller online EP, &quot;Decisions of the Sky: A Traveler&#x27;s Tale of Sun and Storm&quot;, and went to work collectively composing a new set of songs with the new lineup. The resulting album was &quot;Bridge&quot;, which had the working title &quot;Bridge Outta Brooklyn&quot; as a tribute to Sheehan (with both the acronym B.O.B. and his nickname &quot;Brooklyn Bobby&quot;). The songs &quot;Girl Inside My Head&quot; and &quot;Just for Me&quot; received airplay, but the album&#x27;s sales fell somewhat short of expectations.

The live album &quot;What You and I Have Been Through&quot; and the compilation &quot;&quot; were both released in 2002.

===Independent years===
Blues Traveler were one of dozens of artists who were jettisoned as part of A&amp;M&#x27;s corporate restructuring. The band signed with Sanctuary Records for their next album, &quot;Truth Be Told&quot;, which achieved number 147 on The Top 200 chart. The band&#x27;s 2003 Independence Day concerts at Red Rocks Amphitheatre were released on the CD &quot;Live on the Rocks&quot; and the DVD &quot;Thinnest of Air&quot;, and include Ziggy Marley singing on his father&#x27;s song &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot;.

The band left Sanctuary for Vanguard Records and released &quot;¡Bastardos!&quot;, which was produced by Wilco&#x27;s Jay Bennett and was touted as the band&#x27;s return to music that they wanted to play. The album charted at 49 on the Independent Albums, and a live EP of songs from the album was released to independent record stores. The group recorded &quot;Rag Mama Rag&quot; for the 2007 tribute album &quot;Endless Highway: The Music of The Band&quot;, as well as &quot;Free Bird&quot; for &quot;Under the Influence: A Jam Band Tribute to Lynyrd Skynyrd&quot;.

Blues Traveler have been featured on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot;, A&amp;E&#x27;s &quot;Private Sessions&quot;, and &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;. The group recorded the title track to the Sandra Boynton children&#x27;s album &quot;Dog Train&quot;, which was also used as the promotional music for the American Kennel Club&#x27;s National Championship event. The band&#x27;s music has been used in video games (&quot;NASCAR 2000&quot;) and commercials (Busch Beer). The songs &quot;Business as Usual&quot; and &quot;Money Back Guarantee&quot; are used as transitional music on the public radio finance program &quot;Marketplace&quot; and its sister show &quot;Marketplace Money&quot;.

In 2007, Blues Traveler released the album &quot;Cover Yourself&quot;, a &quot;best-of&quot; album of previously released songs re-recorded and reinterpreted with acoustic instrumentation. It was released October 30, 2007, through Columbia/Red Ink Records. They did a national tour, with New Jersey–based singer-songwriter Lisa Bouchelle as opening act. After the tour John Popper and Lisa Bouchelle recorded the song &quot;Only The Tequila Talking&quot;, which was released on her album &quot;Bleu Room with a Red Vase&quot; in 2010.

Blues Traveler appeared at the Lollapalooza 2008 festival. At their June 2008 shows, the band debuted new songs from their new album &quot;North Hollywood Shootout&quot; . The album, which features a guest appearance by Bruce Willis in the track &quot;Free Willis (Ruminations From Behind Uncle Bob&#x27;s Machine Shop)&quot;, released in August 2008.

====2010s====
In March 2012, Blues Traveler released a double-disc compilation titled &quot;25&quot; on Hip-O Records; the album commemorates the band&#x27;s silver anniversary and includes their hit singles, new covers, and previously unreleased B-side material. It peaked at No. 49 in Canada. The following studio album, &quot;Suzie Cracks the Whip&quot;, was released on June 26 of that year.

In September 2013, Blues Traveler signed with Las Vegas–based management firm, UD Factory.

On April 7, 2015, the band released their twelfth studio album, &quot;Blow Up the Moon&quot; which peaked at No. 29 on Independent Albums and No. 47 on Top Rock Albums Billboard charts. As part of the album&#x27;s promotion album, Blues Traveler released a music video using Rockstar editor in &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; on September 14, 2015. The music video features JC Chasez and 3OH!3. In 2016, Blues Traveler made a cameo appearance in the film &quot;The Meddler&quot;. On December 7 the group released a cover version of &quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot;.

In April 2017, the band announced a five-week U.S. tour to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the group&#x27;s formation. In May of the same year, social posts, and a video piece on &quot;Keyboard Magazine&quot; confirmed the band was in the studio in Nashville recording with record producer Matt Rollings. The album &quot;Hurry Up &amp; Hang Around&quot; was released on October 12, 2018, through BMG.

====2020s====
On June 7, 2021, Blues Traveler announced a new album to be titled &quot;Traveler&#x27;s Blues&quot; and released a two–sided EP with the songs that would be featured on the new album. The EP contained songs &quot;Funky B*tch&quot; and &quot;Ball and Chain&quot; which Features Christone &quot;Kingfish&quot; Ingram. The full album would be released the forthcoming month.

&quot;Traveler&#x27;s Blues&quot; was Released on July 30, 2021. The album features covers of classic blues songs and features Crystal Bowersox, Wendy Moten, Christone &quot;Kingfish&quot; Ingram, Rita Wilson, John Scofield, Warren Haynes, The War and Treaty, Mickey Raphael, and Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27;. The album was nominated for &quot;Best Traditional Blues Album / Best Traditional Blues Recording&quot; at the 64th annual Grammy Awards.

==Concert recordings==
Blues Traveler allows and encourages fans to record and trade live performances, provided that no money changes hands and no profit is made. The band has also given permission for live fan-made recordings to be hosted on websites such as Live Music Archive and eTree.org. Recordings available there span from 1986 through the present day. On more recent tours, they sell recordings of that night&#x27;s performance. Attendees can pre-purchase a copy of the show until 30 minutes into the performance and then pick up the CD after the show.

== Independence Day shows at Red Rocks ==
Every year since 1994, with the exception of 1999 (due to Sheehan&#x27;s health) and 2020 (due to COVID-19), Blues Traveler has headlined a show at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado, on the American Independence Day, July 4. The band sometimes plays two consecutive nights, starting on July 3.

This tradition started in 1994, when Blues Traveler was opening for The Allman Brothers Band at the venue for two nights, July 3 and 4. The next year, the band booked the HORDE festival to play there on Independence Day, and in 1994 the current tradition began in earnest.

These shows attract fans from all over the United States. The band frequently debuts new songs and brings back older songs which have fallen out of rotation.

The 2003 Independence Day concerts were recorded for a home video and a live album release.

The band have been described as blues rock, folk rock, alternative rock, and southern rock.

<text>Franjo Tuđman (14 May 1922 – 10 December 1999) was a Croatian politician and historian who became the first president of Croatia, from 1990 until his death. He served following the country&#x27;s independence from Yugoslavia. Tuđman also was the ninth and last president of the Presidency of SR Croatia from May to July 1990.

Tuđman was born in Veliko Trgovišće. In his youth, he fought during World War II as a member of the Yugoslav Partisans. After the war, he took a post in the Ministry of Defence, later attaining the rank of major general of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army in 1960. After his military career, he dedicated himself to the study of geopolitics. In 1963, he became a professor at the Zagreb Faculty of Political Sciences. He received a doctorate in history in 1965 and worked as a historian until coming into conflict with the regime. Tuđman participated in the Croatian Spring movement that called for reforms in the country and was imprisoned for his activities in 1972. He lived relatively anonymously in the following years until the end of communism, whereupon he began his political career by founding the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) in 1989.

HDZ won the first Croatian parliamentary elections in 1990 and Tuđman became the President of the Presidency of SR Croatia. As president, Tuđman introduced a new constitution and pressed for the creation of an independent Croatia. On 19 May 1991, an independence referendum was held, which was approved by 93 percent of voters. Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991. Areas with a Serb majority revolted, backed by the Yugoslav Army, and Tuđman led Croatia during its War of Independence. A ceasefire was signed in 1992, but the war had spread into Bosnia and Herzegovina, where Croats fought in an alliance with Bosniaks. Their cooperation fell apart in late 1992 and Tuđman&#x27;s government sided with Herzeg-Bosnia during the Croat-Bosniak War, a move that brought criticism from the international community. In a final verdict of war crimes trial of former high-ranking officials of Herceg-Bosnia, the ICTY stated that Tuđman shared in their joint criminal enterprise goal of establishing an entity to reunite the Croatian people which was to be implemented through the ethnic cleansing of Bosnian Muslims. However, it did not find him guilty of any specific crimes.
In March 1994, he signed the Washington Agreement with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegović that re-allied Croats and Bosniaks. In August 1995, he authorized a major offensive known as Operation Storm which effectively ended the war in Croatia. In the same year, he was one of the signatories of the Dayton Agreement that put an end to the Bosnian War. He was re-elected president in 1992 and 1997 and remained in power until his death in 1999. While supporters point out his role in achieving Croatian independence, critics have described his presidency as authoritarian. Surveys after Tuđman&#x27;s death have generally shown a high favorability rating among the Croatian public.

==Early life and education==
Franjo Tuđman was born on 14 May 1922 in Veliko Trgovišće, a village in the northern Croatian region of Hrvatsko Zagorje, at the time part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The family moved to the house marked as his birthplace soon after he was born. His father Stjepan ran a local tavern and was a politically active member of the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS). He had been president of the HSS committee in Veliko Trgovišće for 16 years (1925–1941 and had been elected as mayor of Veliko Trgovišće in 1936 and 1938). Mato, Andraš and Juraj, brothers of Stjepan Tuđman, emigrated to the United States. Another brother, Valentin, also tried to emigrate, but a travelling accident prevented him and kept him in Veliko Trgovišće, where he worked as an (uneducated) veterinarian.

Besides Franjo, Stjepan Tuđman had an elder daughter Danica Ana (who died as a baby), Ivica (born in 1924) and Stjepan &quot;Štefek&quot; (born in 1926). When Franjo Tuđman was seven, his mother Justina () died while bearing her fifth child. Tuđman&#x27;s mother was a devout Catholic, unlike his father and stepmother. His father, like Stjepan Radić, had anticlerical attitudes and young Franjo adopted his views. As a child, Franjo Tuđman served as an altar boy in the local parish. Tuđman attended elementary school in his native village from 15 September 1929 to 30 June 1933 and was an excellent student.

He attended secondary school for eight years, starting in the autumn 1935. The reasons for the interruption are not clear, but it is assumed that the primary cause was an economic crisis in that period. According to some sources, the local parish helped young Franjo to continue his education and his teacher even proposed him to be educated to become a priest. When he was 15, his father brought him to Zagreb, where he met Vladko Maček, the president of the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS). At first young, Franjo liked the HSS, but later he turned towards communism. On 5 November 1940, he was arrested during student demonstrations celebrating the anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution.

==World War II==
On 10 April 1941, when Slavko Kvaternik proclaimed the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), the puppet state of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, Tuđman left school and started publishing secret newspapers with his friend Vlado Stopar. He was recruited into the Yugoslav Partisans at the beginning of 1942 by Marko Belinić. His father also joined the Partisans and became a founder of the State Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Croatia (ZAVNOH). According to Tuđman, his father was arrested by the Ustashas, the fascist and ultranationalist organization that governed the NDH, and one of his brothers was taken to a concentration camp. They both managed to survive, unlike the youngest brother Stjepan who was killed by the Gestapo fighting for the Partisans in 1943.

Tuđman was traveling between Zagreb and Zagorje using false documents which identified him as a member of the Croatian Home Guard. There, he was helping to activate a partisan division in Zagorje. On 11 May 1942, while carrying Belinić&#x27;s letter, he was arrested by the Ustashas, but managed to escape from the police station.

==Military career==
Franjo Tuđman and Ankica Žumbar were married on 25 May 1945 at the Belgrade City Council. In this way, they wanted to confirm their faith in the Communist movement and the importance of civil rituals over religious ones. (In May 1945, the government created the law which allowed civil weddings, taking weddings, among other things, out of Church jurisdiction.) They returned to work that same day.

On 26 April 1946, his father Stjepan and stepmother were found dead. Tuđman never clarified the circumstances of their death. According to the police, his father Stjepan killed his wife and then himself. Other theories accuse Ustasha guerrillas (Crusaders) and members of the Yugoslav secret police (OZNA).

Franjo and Ankica did not qualify as secondary school graduates until after the war, in Belgrade. He graduated from the Partisan High School in 1945 and she finished five semesters of English language in the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry.
In 1953, Tuđman was promoted to the position of colonel and moved to position head of office of the Chief of staff of the Federal Secretary of People&#x27;s Defence. On that position in 1959, he became a major general. At the age of 38, he had become the youngest general in the Yugoslav Army. His promotion was not extreme, but it was atypical for a Croat because senior officers were increasingly likely to be Serbs and Montenegrins. In 1962, Serbs and Montenegrins composed 70% of army generals.

On 23 May 1954, he became secretary of JSD Partizan Belgrade and, in May 1958, its president, becoming the first colonel to occupy that position (all previous holders were generals). He was placed in that position in order to solve administration problems inside of the club, especially the football section. When he arrived, JSD Partizan Belgrade was a kind of intelligence battlefield where leaders of UDBA and KOS struggled for influence. That caused clubs (despite having notable and good players) to have bad results, especially its football section. During his club presidency, the club adopted the black-white striped kit which is used to this day. According to Tuđman, he wanted to create a club that would have a pan-Yugoslav image and oppose SD Crvena Zvezda that had an exclusive Serbian image. Tuđman was inspired by Juventus FC uniforms. However, Stjepan Bobek (former player of FK Partizan) claimed that uniform colors idea was, in fact, his, which he passed on to Tuđman.

Tuđman attended the military academy in Belgrade, like many officers who did not have formal military education. He graduated from the tactical school on 18 July 1957 as an excellent student. One of his teachers was Dušan Bilandžić, who would be a future advisor. Before he turned 40 years old, he had risen to become the youngest general in the Yugoslav Army. He was prominent in attending to communist indoctrination while based in Belgrade, where his three children were born.

==Institute==
In 1963, he became professor at the Faculty of Political Science, University of Zagreb where he taught a course called &quot;Socialist Revolution and Contemporary National History&quot;. He left active army service in 1961 at his own request and began working at the Institute for the History of the Workers&#x27; Movement in Croatia, and remained its director until 1967.

Tuđman&#x27;s increasing insistence on a Croatian interpretation of history turned many professors from University of Zagreb like Mirjana Gross and Ljubo Boban against him. In April 1964, Boban denounced Tuđman as a nationalist. During Tuđman&#x27;s leadership the institute became a source of alternative interpretations of Yugoslav history which caused his conflict with official Yugoslav historiography. He did not have an appropriate academic degree to qualify him as a historian. He began to realize that he would need to obtain a doctorate in order to keep his position. His dissertation was entitled &quot;The Causes of the Crisis of the Yugoslav Monarchy from Unification in 1918 until Its Breakdown in 1941&quot;, and was a compilation of some of his previously published works. The University of Zagreb&#x27;s Faculty of Philosophy rejected his dissertation, on the grounds that some parts of it had already been published. The Faculty of Arts in Zadar (then part of University of Zagreb, today University of Zadar) accepted it and he graduated on 28 December 1965.

In his thesis, he stated that the primary cause of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia&#x27;s breakdown was the repressive and corrupted regime which was at odds with the contemporary mainstream Yugoslav historiography which considered Croatian nationalism to be its primary cause. Bogdanov and Milutinović (both ethnic Serbs) did not object to this. However, the Zagreb-based publisher &quot;Naprijed&quot; cancelled the contract following his refusal to change some controversial statements in the book. He publicly supported the goals of the Declaration on the Name and Status of the Croatian Literary Language. The Croatian Parliament and League of Communists of Croatia from Zagreb, however, attacked it and the board of the institute requested Tuđman&#x27;s resignation.
In December 1966, Ljubo Boban accused Tuđman of plagiarism, stating that Tuđman had compiled four-fifths of his doctoral thesis, &quot;The Creation of the Socialist Yugoslavia&quot;, from Boban&#x27;s work. Boban offered conclusive proofs to his claim from articles published previously in the magazine &quot;Forum&quot; and the rest from Boban&#x27;s own thesis. Tuđman was then expelled from the institute and forced to retire in 1967.

Between 1962 and 1967, he was the president of the Main Committee for International Relations of the Croatian League of Communists Main Board and deputy in the Croatian Parliament between 1965 and 1969.

==Dissident politics==
Apart from his book on guerrilla warfare, Tuđman wrote a series of articles criticizing the Yugoslav Socialist establishment. His most important book from that period was &quot;Velike ideje i mali narodi&quot; (&quot;Great ideas and small nations&quot;), a monograph on political history that brought him into conflict with the central dogmas of the Yugoslav Communist elite with regard to the interconnectedness of the national and social elements in the Yugoslav revolutionary war (during World War II).

In 1970, he became a member of the Croatian Writers&#x27; Society. In 1972 he was sentenced to two years in prison for &quot;subversive activities&quot; during the Croatian Spring. According to Tuđman&#x27;s own testimony, the Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito personally intervened to recommend the court to be lenient in his case, sparing him a longer prison sentence. The authorities of SR Croatia additionally intended to prosecute Tuđman on charges of espionage, which carried a sentence of 15–20 years in prison with hard labour, but the charge was commuted by Tito. Other sources mention that Miroslav Krleža, a writer, lobbied on Tuđman&#x27;s behalf. According to Tuđman, he and Tito were close friends. However, Tuđman later described Tito&#x27;s crackdown as an &quot;autocratic coup d&#x27;état&quot;.
The Croatian Spring was a national movement set in motion by Tito and the Croatian communist party chairman Vladimir Bakarić amid the climate of growing liberalism in the late 1960s. It was initially a tepid and ideologically controlled party liberalism, but it soon grew into a mass nationalist-based manifestation of dissatisfaction with the position of Croatia within Yugoslavia. As a result, the movement was suppressed by Tito, who used the military and the police to put a stop to what he saw as separatism and a threat to the party&#x27;s influence. Bakarić quickly distanced himself from the Croatian communist leadership that he himself had helped to gain power earlier and sided with the Yugoslav president. However, Tito took the protesters&#x27; demands into consideration and in 1974 the new Yugoslav constitution granted the majority of the demands sought by the Croatian Spring. On other topics like Communism and one-party political monopoly Tuđman remained mostly within the framework of the communist ideology of the day. His sentence was eventually commuted by Tito&#x27;s government and Tuđman was released after spending nine months in prison.

In 1977, he traveled to Sweden using a forged Swedish passport to meet members of the Croatian diaspora. His trip apparently went unnoticed by Yugoslav police. However, on that trip he gave an interview to Swedish TV about the position of Croats in Yugoslavia that was later broadcast. Upon returning to Yugoslavia, Tuđman was put on trial again in 1981 because of this interview, and was accused for having spread &quot;enemy propaganda&quot;. On 20 February 1981 he was found guilty and sentenced to three years of prison and 5 years in house arrest. However, he served only eleven months of the sentence. In June 1987, he became a member of the Croatian PEN centre. On 6 June 1987, he travelled to Canada with his wife to meet Croatian Canadians. They were trying not to discuss sensitive issues with emigrants abroad fearing that some might be agents of the Yugoslav secret police (UDBA), which was a common practice at the time.

During his trips to Canada he met many Croatian emigrants who were natives of Herzegovina or were of Herzegovinian ancestry. Some of these later became Croatian government officials after the country&#x27;s independence, the most prominent of whom was Gojko Šušak, whose father and elder brother had been members of the Ustaše. These meetings abroad in the late 1980s later gave rise to many conspiracy theories. According to these rumours the Croats of Herzegovina had somehow used the meetings to earn a huge amount of influence inside the HDZ, as well as the post-independence Croatian establishment.

==Formation of the national programme==
In the latter part of the 1980s, when Yugoslavia was nearing its demise, torn by conflicting national aspirations, Tuđman formulated a Croatian national programme that can be summarized in the following way:
* The primary goal is the establishment of the Croatian nation-state; therefore all ideological disputes from the past should be thrown away. In practice, this meant strong support from the anti-Communist Croatian diaspora, especially financial.
* Even though Tuđman&#x27;s final goal was an independent Croatia, he was well aware of the realities of internal and foreign policy. His chief initial proposal was not a fully independent Croatia, but a confederate Yugoslavia with growing decentralization and democratization.
* Tuđman envisaged Croatia&#x27;s future as a welfare capitalist state that will inevitably move towards central Europe and away from the Balkans.
* With regard to the burning issues of national conflicts, his vision was the following (at least initially): he asserted that Serbian nationalism, controlled by the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA), could wreak havoc on Croatian and Bosnian soil. The JNA, according to some estimates the fourth European military force in terms of firepower, was being rapidly Serbianized, both ideologically and ethnically, in less than four years. Tuđman&#x27;s proposal was that Serbs in Croatia, who made up 12% of Croatia&#x27;s population, should gain cultural freedom with elements of territorial autonomy.
* As far as Bosnia and Herzegovina was concerned, Tuđman was more ambivalent: Tuđman did not take a separate Bosnia seriously as shown by his comments to a television crew &quot;Bosnia was a creation of the Ottoman invasion ... Until then it was part of Croatia, or it was a kingdom of Bosnia, but a Catholic kingdom, linked to Croatia&quot;.

On 17 June 1989, Tuđman founded the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). Essentially, this was a nationalist Croatian movement that affirmed Croatian values based on Catholicism blended with historical and cultural traditions which had been generally suppressed in communist Yugoslavia. The aim was to gain national independence and to establish a Croatian nation-state.

==1990 election campaign==

Internal tensions that had broken up the League of Communists of Yugoslavia prompted the governments of the federal republics to schedule free multiparty elections in spring 1990. These were the first free multi-party elections for the Croatian Parliament since 1913. The HDZ held its first convention on 24–25 February 1990, when Tuđman was elected its president. The election campaign took place from late March until 20 April 1990. Tuđman recruited several supporters from members of the diaspora who returned home, most importantly Gojko Šušak.

Tuđman based his campaign mostly on the national question. He stated that the dinar earned in Croatia should stay in Croatia, thus objecting to the subsidies for less developed parts of Yugoslavia, or for the Yugoslav army. He addressed the economic crisis, called for the renewal of a market economy and a parliamentary democracy, and expressed his support for the accession to the European Community. He maintained that Yugoslavia could survive only as a confederation. Although Tuđman had ties with the right-wing anti-Communist diaspora, he also had important colleagues from the Partisan Communist establishment, including Josip Boljkovac and Josip Manolić. His main opponent in the election was Ivica Račan from the League of Communists of Croatia (SKH), who became the SKH Chairman in December 1989.

Tuđman&#x27;s talk of Croatia&#x27;s past glories and independence was not received well among Croatian Serbs. The HDZ was heavily criticized by Serbian media, portraying their possible victory as a revival of NDH. Veljko Kadijević, general of the JNA, said at meeting of the army and SR Croatia leaderships that the elections would bring the Ustaše to power in Croatia. A few weeks before the elections, the army removed the weapons of the Territorial Defence from stores all over Croatia. During a HDZ campaign rally in Benkovac, an ethnically mixed town, a 62-year-old Serbian man, Boško Čubrilović, pulled out a gas pistol near the podium. Croatian media described the incident as an assassination attempt on Tuđman, but Čubrilović was in late 1990 charged and convicted only of threatening the security staff. The incident further worsened ethnic tensions.

During his campaign, on 16 April 1990 Tuđman had a conversation with news reporters where he said: 

The part of the statement about his wife was later widely criticized, including by officials of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. Croatian historian Ante Nazor cited claims by Tuđman&#x27;s son, Miroslav and Stijepo Mijović Kočan about the statement being directed against the former Yugoslav communist system rather than against Jews or Serbs; instead about mixed marriages being used by Croats as a means to promotion in the system. On 19 April, at a rally in Zadar, Tuđman said:

The elections were scheduled for all 356 seats in the parliament. Tuđman&#x27;s party triumphed and got an absolute majority of around 60% or 205 seats in the Croatian Parliament. Tuđman was elected to the position of president of Croatia on . After the victory of HDZ the nationalistic Serb Democratic Party (SDS) spread its influence quickly in places where Serbs formed a high percentage of the population. Since the split among communists in Yugoslavia along ethnic lines was already a fact at that time, it seemed inevitable that the conflicts would continue following the multi-party elections which brought to power new political establishments in Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, while at the same time the same communist officials kept their posts in Serbia and Montenegro.

==President of Croatia (1990–1999)==

In the weeks following the election, the new government introduced the traditional Croatian flag and coat of arms, without Communist symbols. The term &quot;Socialist&quot; in the title of the republic was removed. Constitutional changes were proposed with a multitude of political, economic, and social changes. Tuđman offered the vice-presidency to Jovan Rašković, president of the SDS, but Rašković declined the offer and called the elected deputies from his party to boycott the parliament. Local Serb police in Knin began operating as an independent force, often not responding to orders from Zagreb. Many government employees, mostly in police where commanding positions were mainly held by Serbs and Communists, lost their jobs. This was based on a decision that the civil service ethnic structure should correspond to their percentage in the entire population.

On 25 July 1990, a Serbian Assembly was established in Srb, north of Knin. Jovan Rašković announced a referendum on &quot;Serb sovereignty and autonomy&quot; in Croatia in August 1990, which Tuđman labeled as illegal. A series of incidents followed in areas populated by ethnic Serbs, mostly around Knin, known as the Log Revolution. The revolt in Knin concentrated the Croatian government on the problem of the lack of weapons. The effects of the JNA&#x27;s confiscation of the Territorial Defence supplies was partly undone by the new Defence Minister, Martin Špegelj, who bought weapons from Hungary. As it had no regular army, the government had focused on building up the police force. By January 1991 there were 18,500 policemen and by April 1991 around 39,000. On 22 December 1990, the Parliament of Croatia ratified the new constitution. The Serbs in Knin proclaimed the Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina in municipalities of the regions of Northern Dalmatia and Lika.

In December 1990 Tuđman and Slovenian President Milan Kučan presented their proposal on the restructuring of Yugoslavia on confederal grounds. Tuđman believed that a confederation of sovereign republics could accelerate the Croatian accession to the European Community. The leaders of the Yugoslav republics held many meetings in early 1991 to resolve the growing crisis. On 25 March 1991, Tuđman and Slobodan Milošević met at Karađorđevo, a meeting which became controversial due to claims that the two presidents discussed the partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina between Serbia and Croatia. However, the claims came from persons that were not present at the meeting and there is no record of this meeting that proves an existence of such an agreement, while Milošević did not behave subsequently as if he had an agreement with Tuđman. On 12 July 1991, Tuđman met with Alija Izetbegović and Milošević in Split.

===War years===
On 1 March the Pakrac clash occurred when local Serb police seized the town&#x27;s police station and declared Pakrac a part of SAO Krajina. It was one of the first larger clashes between Croat forces and the rebel SAO Krajina, supported by the JNA. It ended without casualties and with the restoration of Croatian control. On 31 March a Croatian police convoy was ambushed at the Plitvice Lakes. Until the spring of 1991 Tuđman, together with the Slovenian leadership, was ready to accept a compromise solution of a confederation or alliance of sovereign states within Yugoslavia. After the Serbian leadership rejected their proposals and armed provocations became more frequent, Tuđman decided to realize the idea of a complete Croatian independence. On 25 April 1991, the Croatian Parliament decided to hold an independence referendum on 19 May. Croatian Serbs largely boycotted the referendum. The turnout was 83.56%, of which 93.24% or 2,845,521 voted in favour of the independence of Croatia. Both Slovenia and Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991. The Yugoslav side accused the two of secession. The federal government ordered the JNA to take control of border crossings in Slovenia, which led to the Ten-Day War in which the JNA was routed. The Ten-Day War ended with the signing of the Brioni Agreement, when a three-month moratorium was placed on the implementation of the decision.

The armed incidents of early 1991 escalated into an all-out war over the summer. Tuđman&#x27;s first plan was to win support from the European Community, avoiding the direct confrontation with the JNA that had been proposed by Martin Špegelj, the Minister of Defence, since the beginning of the conflict. Tuđman rejected Špegelj&#x27;s proposal as it would be damaging on Croatia&#x27;s international position and there were doubts that the Croatian Army was ready for such an action. The emerging Croatian Army had only four brigades in September 1991. As the war escalated, Tuđman formed the National Unity Government which brought in members of most of the minor parties in the parliament, including Račan&#x27;s Social Democratic Party (SDP).

Fierce fighting took place in Vukovar, where around 1,800 Croat fighters were blocking JNA&#x27;s advance into Slavonia. Vukovar assumed enormous symbolic importance to both sides. Without it, Serbian territorial gains in eastern Slavonia were threatened. The unexpectedly fierce defence of the town against a much larger army inspired talk of a &quot;Croatian Stalingrad&quot;. Increasing losses and complaints from the Croatian public for failing to hit back compelled Tuđman to act. He ordered the Croatian National Guard to surround JNA army bases, thus starting the Battle of the Barracks. Tuđman named Gojko Šušak the new Minister of Defence in September 1991.
In early October 1991, the JNA intensified its campaign in Croatia. On 5 October, Tuđman made a speech in which he called upon the whole population to mobilize and defend against &quot;Greater Serbian imperialism&quot; pursued by the Serb-led JNA, Serbian paramilitary formations, and rebel Serb forces. Two days later the Yugoslav Air Force bombed Banski Dvori, the seat of the Croatian Government in Zagreb, at the time when Tuđman had a meeting with Yugoslav president Stjepan Mesić and prime minister Ante Marković, none of whom were injured in the attack. On 8 October the Croatian Parliament cut all remaining ties with Yugoslavia and declared independence. Tuđman asked the Kosovo leadership to open a second front there against the JNA and offered help in weapons. The leadership decided against armed conflict, but gave support to the independence of Croatia and called on ethnic Albanians to desert the Yugoslav army.

In November 1991 the Battle of Vukovar ended that left the city devastated. The JNA and Serbian irregulars seized control of about a quarter of Croatia&#x27;s territory by the end of 1991. In December 1991, the SAO Krajina proclaimed itself the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK). Until the end of 1991 sixteen ceasefires were signed, none of which lasted longer than a day.

On 19 December 1991, Iceland and Germany recognized Croatia&#x27;s sovereignty. Many observers believe Tuđman&#x27;s good relationship with Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Germany&#x27;s foreign minister at the time, had much to do with this decision. Hostilities in Croatia ended for a time in January 1992 when the Vance plan was signed. Tuđman hoped that the deployment of UN peacekeepers would consolidate Croatia&#x27;s international borders, but the military situation in Croatia itself remained unsettled.

====Bosnian War====

As the war in Croatia reached a stalemate, the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina worsened. The JNA used its territory for offensives against Croatia, but avoided the Croat majority part of Herzegovina. Tuđman doubted that Bosnia and Herzegovina could survive the dissolution of Yugoslavia, but supported its integrity if it remained outside a Yugoslav federation and Serbian influence. The first Croat casualties in the country fell in October 1991 when the village of Ravno was attacked and destroyed by the JNA. Several days later Bosnian president Alija Izetbegović gave a televised proclamation of neutrality, stating that &quot;this is not our war&quot;.

The Bosniak leadership initially showed willingness to remain in a rump Yugoslavia, but later changed their policy and opted for independence. The Croat leadership started organizing themselves in Croat-majority areas and on 18 November 1991 established the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia as an autonomous Croat territorial unit. At a meeting in December 1991 with the HDZ BiH leadership Tuđman discussed the possibility of joining Herzeg-Bosnia to Croatia as he thought that Bosnian representatives were working to remain in Yugoslavia. There he criticized HDZ BiH president Stjepan Kljujić for siding with Izetbegović. However, in February 1992 he encouraged Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina to support the upcoming Bosnian independence referendum. Izetbegović declared the country&#x27;s independence on 6 April that was immediately recognised by Croatia. At the beginning of the Bosnian war a Croat-Bosniak alliance was formed, though it was often not harmonious. The Croatian government helped arm both Croat and Bosniak forces. On 21 July 1992, the Agreement on Friendship and Cooperation was signed by Tuđman and Izetbegović, establishing a military cooperation between the two armies. In September 1992 they signed two more agreements on cooperation and further negotiations regarding the internal organization of Bosnia and Herzegovina, though Izetbegović rejected a military pact. In January 1993 Tuđman said that Bosnia and Herzegovina could survive only as a confederal union of three nations.

Over time, the relations between Croats and Bosniaks worsened, resulting in the Croat–Bosniak War. The Bosniak side claimed that Tuđman wanted to partition Bosnia and Herzegovina, a view that was increasingly accepted by the international community. This made it difficult for Tuđman to protect Croatia&#x27;s interests and support Herzeg-Bosnia. As the conflict escalated, Croatia&#x27;s foreign policy reached a low point. Throughout 1993 several peace plans were proposed by the international community. Tuđman and the Herzeg-Bosnia leadership accepted all of them, including the Vance-Owen Plan in January 1993 and the Owen-Stoltenberg in July 1993. However, no lasting ceasefire was agreed. In early 1994 the United States became increasingly involved in resolving the wars. They were concerned with the way the Croat-Bosniak war helped the Serbs and put pressure on the two sides to sign a final truce. The war ended in March 1994 with the signing of the Washington Agreement. In June 1994 Tuđman visited Sarajevo to open the Croatian embassy there. He met with Izetbegović and discussed the creation of the Croat-Muslim Federation and its possible confederation with Croatia.

====Ceasefire in Croatia====
Despite considerable difficulties, Croatian diplomacy managed to achieve recognition in the following months. Croatia was recognised by the European Community on 15 January 1992 and became a member of the United Nations on 22 May. In April 1992, Washington recognised Croatia, Slovenia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina simultaneously. Since the new Clinton administration came to power it had lobbied consistently for a hard line against Milošević, a political position often largely attributed to the policies of then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. In May 1992 Croatia established diplomatic relations with China. A year later Tuđman was the first president from the former Yugoslavia to visit China.

The war caused great destruction and indirect damage in tourism, transit traffic, investment, etc. President Tuđman estimated the cost of direct material damage at over $20 billion and that Croatia was spending $3 million daily on care for hundreds of thousands of refugees. When the ceasefire of January 1992 came into effect Croatia slowly recovered. As economic activity picked up steadily and negotiations with the leaders of RSK got nowhere, the Defence Minister, Gojko Šušak, started amassing weapons in preparation for a military solution.

Tuđman won the presidential elections in August 1992 in the first round with 57.8% of the vote. Simultaneously, the parliamentary elections were held that were also won by HDZ. During the campaign, Dobroslav Paraga, the extreme right-wing leader of the Croatian Party of Rights, accused Tuđman of betraying Croatian interests by not engaging in an all-out war with Serbian forces. Tuđman tried to marginalize his party due to their use of Ustaše symbols, that brought criticism in the foreign press towards Croatia. Paraga won only 5 seats in the parliament and 5,4% of the vote in the presidential election.

In January 1993 the Croatian Army launched Operation Maslenica and recaptured the vital Maslenica bridge linking Dalmatia with northern Croatia. Although the UN Security Council condemned the operation, there were no incurring sanctions. This victory enabled Tuđman to counter domestic accusations that he was weak in his dealings with RSK and the UN.

Despite clashes with the RSK forces, during 1993 and 1994 the overall condition of the economy improved substantially and unemployment was gradually falling. On 4 April 1993 Tuđman appointed Nikica Valentić as prime minister. The anti-inflationary stabilization steps in 1993 successfully lowered inflation. The Croatian dinar, that was introduced as a transitional currency, was replaced with the kuna in 1994. GDP growth reached 5.9% in 1994.

====End of the war====
In May 1995, the Croatian army launched Operation Flash, its third operation against RSK since the January 1992 ceasefire, and quickly recaptured western Slavonia. International diplomats drafted the Z-4 Plan, proposing the reintegration of the RSK into Croatia. RSK would keep its flag and have its own president, parliament, police and a separate currency. Although Tuđman was displeased with the proposal, RSK authorities rejected it outright.

On 22 July 1995, Tuđman and Izetbegović signed the Split Agreement, binding both sides to a &quot;joint defence against Serb aggression&quot;. Tuđman soon put his words into action and initiated Operation Summer &#x27;95, carried out by joint forces of HV and HVO. These forces overran the towns of Glamoč and Bosansko Grahovo in western Bosnia, virtually isolating Knin from Republika Srpska and FR Yugoslavia.
At 5:00 a.m. on Friday, 4 August 1995, Tuđman publicly authorized the attack on RSK, codenamed Operation Storm. He called on the Serb army and their leadership in Knin to surrender, and at the same time called Serb civilians to remain in their homes, guaranteeing them their rights. The decision to head straight for Knin, the centre of RSK, paid off and by 10am on 5 August, on the second day of the operation, Croatian forces entered the city with minimal casualties. By the morning of 8 August the operation was effectively over, resulting in the restoration of Croatian control of 10,400 square kilometres (4,000 square miles) of territory. Around 150,000–200,000 Serbs fled and a variety of crimes were committed against the remaining civilians. United States President Bill Clinton said he was &quot;hopeful that Croatia&#x27;s offensive will turn out to be something that will give us an avenue to a quick diplomatic solution.&quot;
A joint offensive of Croatian and Bosniak forces followed in western and northern Bosnia. Bosnian Serb forces quickly lost territory and were forced to negotiate. Talks regarding a peace treaty were held in Dayton, Ohio. Tuđman insisted on solving the question of RSK-held eastern Slavonia and its peaceful return to Croatia at the Dayton peace talks. On 1 November he had a heated debate with Milošević, who denied control over the region&#x27;s leadership. Tuđman was ready to hinder the Dayton agreement and continue the war if Slavonia was not peacefully reintegrated. The military situation gave him an upper hand and Milošević agreed on his request. The Dayton Agreement was drafted in November 1995. Tuđman was one of the signatories of it, along with the leaderships of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, that ended the Bosnian War. On 12 November the Erdut Agreement was signed with local Serb authorities regarding the return of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia to Croatia, with a two-year transitional period. This ended the war in Croatia. Official figures on wartime damage published in Croatia in 1996 specify 180,000 destroyed housing units, 25% of the Croatian economy destroyed, and US$27 billion of material damage. Regarding the exodus of some 150,000 Krajina Serbs from Croatia, Tudjman remarked that the refugees left so fast that they &quot;didn&#x27;t even have time to collect their dirty currency and their dirty underwear&quot;. He later boasted to his generals: &quot;We have resolved the Serbian question... [t]here will never be 12 percent of Serbs&quot; in Croatia. &quot;If there are three or five per cent of them, that isn&#x27;t a threat to the Croatian state&quot;.

===Post-war policy===


In 1995 parliamentary elections were held that resulted in a victory of HDZ with 75 out of 127 seats in the parliament. Tuđman named Zlatko Mateša the 6th prime minister, who formed the first peacetime government of independent Croatia. The elections were held in conjunction with local elections in Zagreb, which were won by the opposition parties. Tuđman refused to provide a formal confirmation to the proposed mayor of Zagreb, which led to the Zagreb crisis. In 1996 a large demonstration was held in Zagreb in response to revoking broadcasting license to Radio 101, a radio station that was critical towards the ruling party.

Treatment of the media brought criticism from some international organizations. Notably, the &quot;Feral Tribune&quot;, a weekly Croatian political and satirical newspaper magazine, was subjected to several lawsuits and criminal charges from government officials as well as being forced to pay a tax usually reserved for pornographic magazines.
Some opposition parties in Croatia advocated the view that, far from Europeanising Croatia, Tuđman was responsible for its &quot;Balkanisation&quot; and that during his presidency, he acted like a despot. Other parties, for instance the Croatian Party of Rights, argued that Tuđman was not radical enough in his defence of the Croatian state.

Croatia became a member of the Council of Europe on 6 November 1996. On 15 June 1997 Tuđman won the presidential elections with 61.4% of the votes, ahead of Zdravko Tomac and Vlado Gotovac, and was re-elected to a second five-year term. Marina Matulović-Dropulić became the Mayor of Zagreb having won the 1997 local elections, which formally ended the Zagreb crisis.

In January 1998 Eastern Slavonia was officially reintegrated into Croatia. In February 1998 Tuđman was re-elected as president of HDZ. The beginning of the year was marked by a large syndical protest in Zagreb, due to which the government adopted legislation regulating public gatherings and demonstrations in April.

After the war, Tuđman controversially suggested that the remains of those killed during the Yugoslav death march of Nazi collaborators be brought and laid to rest at Jasenovac, an idea he later abandoned. This idea included burying Ustaša troops, anti-fascist Partisans and all civilians together and was inspired by General Francisco Franco&#x27;s Valle de los Caídos. Previously he had appointed Ustaše official Vinko Nikolic to the Croatian Parliament and his administration named multiple streets after Ustaše politician Mile Budak. He also appointed former Ustaše official Ivo Rojnica as Ambassador to Argentina but after some controversy he was replaced.

In 1998 Tuđman claimed that his program of national reconciliation had prevented a civil war in Croatia during the collapse of Yugoslavia.

====Economy====
As a result of the macro-stabilization programs, the negative growth of GDP during the early 1990s stopped and turned into a positive trend. Post-war reconstruction activity provided another impetus to growth. Consumer spending and private sector investments, both of which were postponed during the war, contributed to improved economic conditions and growth in 1995–97. Real GDP growth in 1995 was 6.8%, in 1996 5.9% and in 1997 6.6%.

In 1995 a Ministry of Privatization was established with Ivan Penić as its first minister. Privatization in Croatia had barely begun when war broke out in 1991. Infrastructure sustained massive damage from the war, especially the revenue-rich tourism industry, and its transformation from a market socialist economy to a free-market economy was thus slow and unsteady. Public mistrust rose when many state-owned companies were sold to politically well-connected at below-market prices. The ruling party was criticised for transferring enterprises to a group of privileged owners connected to the party.

The method of privatization contributed to the increase of state ownership because the unsold shares were transferred to state funds. In 1999 the private sector share in GDP reached 60%, which was significantly lower than in other former socialist countries. The privatization of large government-owned companies was practically halted during the war and in the years immediately following the conclusion of peace. At the end of Tuđman&#x27;s rule, roughly 70% of Croatia&#x27;s major companies were still state-owned, including water, electricity, oil, transportation, telecommunications, and tourism.

Value-added tax was introduced in 1998 and the central government budget was in surplus that year. The consumer boom was disrupted when the economy went into recession at the end of 1998, as a result of the bank crisis when 14 banks went bankrupt, and GDP growth slowed down to 1.9%. The recession continued throughout 1999 when GDP fell by 0.9%. Unemployment increased from around 10% in 1996 and 1997 to 11.4% in 1998. By the end of 1999 it reached 13.6%. The country emerged from the recession in the 4th quarter of 1999. After several years of successful macroeconomic stabilization policies, low inflation and a stable currency, economists warned that the lack of fiscal changes and the expanding role of the state in economy caused the decline in the late 1990s and were preventing a sustainable economic growth.

====Foreign policy====
Mate Granić was the Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1993 until the end of the Tuđman administration. In 1996 he signed an agreement on normalization of relations with FR Yugoslavia. On 9 September 1996 Croatia established diplomatic relations with FR Yugoslavia.

The US was the main mediator in reaching a peace treaty in the region and continued to have most influence after 1995. The Croatian offensives in 1995 did not receive unambiguous supports from the US, but they supported Croatian demands for territorial integrity. However, the Croatian-American relations after the war did not develop as Tuđman expected. Serb minority rights and cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia were asserted as the main issues and they led to a deterioration of relations at the end of 1996 and during 1997. Tuđman tried to counter the pressure with closer relations with Russia and China. In November 1996 he received the Medal of Zhukov, awarded for contribution to the antifascist struggle, from Russian president Boris Yeltsin.

A confederation between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, adopted under the Washington Agreement, was not accomplished, while the Croat-Bosniak Federation acted only on paper. In August 1996 Tuđman and Izetbegović agreed to fully implement the Dayton agreement. Herzeg-Bosnia was to be formally abolished by the end of the month.

In 1999 the NATO intervention in Kosovo began. Tuđman expressed his concerns regarding the potential damage to Croatian economy and tourism, which was estimated at $1 billion. Still, the government expressed their support to NATO and granted permission to NATO planes to use Croatia&#x27;s airspace. In May, Tuđman said that a possible solution is to deploy UN peacekeepers in Kosovo that would enable the return of Albanian refugees, while Yugoslav forces would retreat to Serb-majority northern Kosovo.

====Relation to the Catholic Church====
Živko Kustić, a Croatian Eastern Catholic priest and journalist for &quot;Jutarnji list&quot;, wrote that Tuđman&#x27;s perception of the church&#x27;s role in Croatia was contradictory to the goals of Pope John Paul II. Moreover, Kustić expressed doubt that Tuđman had ever been truly religious except when he was very young. Tuđman considered the Catholic religion to be important for the modern Croatian nation. When taking the oath in 1992 he added sentence &quot;Tako mi Bog pomogao!&quot; () which was not then part of the official text. In 1997, he officially included the sentence in the oath. Tuđman&#x27;s era was the era of the Catholic revival in Croatia. Church attendance rose; even former communists massively participated in church sacraments. The state was funding the building and renewal of churches and monasteries. Between 1996 and 1998 Croatia signed various treaties with the Holy See, by which the Catholic Church in Croatia was granted some financial rights, among others. 

====Health problems and death====
Tuđman was diagnosed with cancer in 1993. His general health had deteriorated by the late 1990s. On 1 November 1999 he appeared in public for the last time. While being hospitalized opposition parties accused the ruling HDZ of hiding the fact that Tuđman was already dead and that the authorities were keeping his death secret in order to win more seats in the upcoming January 2000 general election. Tuđman&#x27;s death was officially declared on 10 December 1999. He had a funeral Mass in Zagreb Cathedral and was buried in Mirogoj Cemetery.

===Vrhovnik===

Tuđman was conferred by the Croatian Parliament the military rank of Supreme commander of Croatia, or &#x27;Vrhovnik&#x27; on 22 March 1995. It was the highest honorific title in the Croatian Armed Forces and equivalent to Marshal. Tuđman was the only person to ever hold this rank. He held it until his death. The uniform for this position allegedly was modeled on the uniform of Josip Broz Tito as Tuđman was a dedicated Major General of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army. The title was eventually abolished in 2002.

==ICTY==
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was established by the United Nations in 1993. Although the Croatian government passed a law on cooperation with the ICTY, since 1997 relations between ICTY and Croatia worsened. Tuđman criticized the work of ICTY in 1999, while ICTY&#x27;s chief prosecutor Louise Arbour expressed her dissatisfaction with Croatia&#x27;s cooperation with the tribunal.

During Tuđman&#x27;s life, neither Richard Goldstone nor Arbour, ICTY&#x27;s first chief prosecutors, reportedly considered indicting him. In 2002 the new ICTY prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, said in an interview that she would have indicted Tuđman had he not died in 1999. Graham Blewitt, a senior Tribunal prosecutor, told the AFP wire service that &quot;There would have been sufficient evidence to indict president Tuđman had he still been alive&quot;.

In 2000, British Channel 4 television broadcast a report about the tape recordings of Franjo Tuđman in which he allegedly spoke about the partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the Serbs after the Dayton Agreement. They claimed that the then Croatian President Stjepan Mesić gave them access to 17,000 transcripts. Mesić, who succeeded Tuđman as president of Croatia, and his office denied giving any transcripts to British journalists and called the report a &quot;sensationalistic story that has nothing to do with the truth&quot;.

At the trial of Gotovina, in a first-degree verdict, the Trial Chamber found Tuđman to have been a key participant in a joint criminal enterprise, the purpose of which was to permanently remove the Serb civilian population from the territory of Republic of Serbian Krajina and repopulate it with Croats. In November 2012, an ICTY appeal court overturned the convictions of Mladen Markač and Ante Gotovina, acquitted the two former generals and concluded that there was no planned deportation of the Serbian minority and no joint criminal enterprise by the Croatian leadership.

In May 2013, the ICTY, in a first-instance verdict in the trial of Prlić et al., found that Tuđman, Bobetko and Šušak took part in the joint criminal enterprise against the non-Croat population of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It ruled, by a majority, that the purpose of it was to de facto join Herzeg-Bosnia to Croatia. Judge Jean-Claude Antoanetti, the presiding judge in the trial, issued a separate opinion in which he contested the notion of a joint criminal enterprise and said that Tuđman&#x27;s plans regarding Bosnia and Herzegovina were not in contradiction with the stance of the international community.

On 19 July 2016 the Appeals Chamber in the case announced that the &quot;Trial Chamber made no explicit findings concerning [Tudjman&#x27;s, Šušak&#x27;s and Bobetko&#x27;s] participation in the JCE and did not find [them] guilty of any crimes.&quot; On 29 November 2017, without attributing any crimes to Tuđman, the Appeals Chamber in the case upheld the convictions of six Herzeg-Bosnia and HVO leaders and concluded that he shared their joint criminal enterprise of &quot;setting up a Croatian entity that reconstituted earlier borders and that facilitated the reunification of the Croatian people&quot; which would be done through the ethnic cleansing of Bosnian Muslims.

==Tuđman as historian==
Tuđman did not have a formal academic education as historian. He approached history as a Marxist scholar and Croatian attorney. He always regarded history as a means of forming society. His voluminous, more than 2,000 pages long, &quot;Hrvatska u monarhističkoj Jugoslaviji&quot; (), has come to be assigned as reading material concerning this period of Croatian history at some Croatian universities. His shorter treatises on national question, &quot;Nacionalno pitanje u suvremenoj Europi&quot; () and &quot;Usudbene povijestice&quot; () are still well-regarded essays on unresolved national and ethnic disputes, self-determination and creation of nation-states in the European milieu.

===&quot;Horrors of War&quot;===
In 1989 Tuđman published &quot;Bespuća povijesne zbiljnosti&quot; (Literal English translation:&quot;Wastelands of historical reality&quot;) which was published in English in 1996 as &quot;Horrors of War: Historical Reality and Philosophy&quot;. The book questioned the different claimed numbers of victims killed during World War II in Yugoslavia, particularly regarding the Jasenovac concentration camp, something Tuđman had previously done in an earlier work published in 1982. The Yugoslav government&#x27;s estimates put the number of Jasenovac victims between 600,000 and 700,000 while some Serbian historians even suggested up to one million victims; both sets of numbers which were exaggerated. Tuđman felt that Jasenovac was being used to impose a collective guilt on Croats and to prove &quot;the genocidal nature&quot; of Croatian nationalism.

The last serious research of victim numbers before the Yugoslav wars was conducted by Croatian economist Vladimir Žerjavić and Serbian researcher Bogoljub Kočović. Both Žerjavić and Kočović arrived at a figure of 83,000 deaths in Jasenovac, each using different statistical methods. 59,589 victims (of all nationalities) were identified by name in a Yugoslav name list that was made in 1964. In his book Tuđman had estimated, relying on some earlier investigations, that the total number of victims in the Jasenovac camp (Serbs, Jews, Gypsies, Croats, and others) was somewhere between 30,000 and 40,000. He listed the victims as &quot;Gypsies, Jews and Serbs, and even Croatians&quot;, reversing the conventional order of deaths to imply that more Gypsies and Jews were killed than Serbs. Tuđman emphasized that the camp was organised as a &quot;work camp&quot;. He estimated that a total of 50,000 were killed in all Ustashe camps throughout the NDH. While he rightfully challenged the inflated numbers, he wound up downplaying Ustaše crimes by providing figures that were too low.

In &quot;Horrors of War&quot;, Tuđman asserted that 900,000 Jews perished in the Holocaust instead of six million. Aside from the war statistics issue, Tuđman&#x27;s book contained views on the Jewish role in history that many readers found simplistic and profoundly biased. Some have described it as anti-semitic. Tuđman based his views on the Jewish condition on the memoirs of a Croatian former Communist Ante Ciliga, who described his experiences at Jasenovac during a year and a half of his incarceration. These are recorded in his book, &quot;Sam kroz Europu u ratu (1939–1945)&quot;, paint an unfavorable picture of his Jewish inmates&#x27; behavior, emphasizing their alleged clannishness and ethnocentrism. Ciliga claimed Jews had held a privileged position in Jasenovac and actually, as Tuđman concludes, &quot;held in their hands the inmates management of the camp up to 1944 [because] in its origins Pavelić&#x27;s party was philo-Semitic&quot;. Tuđman added that most prisoners at Jasenovac perished at the hands of Jews, who controlled the liquidation process, and not the Ustaše. Ciliga theorized that the behavior of the Jews had been determined by the more-than-2000-year-old tradition of extreme ethnic egoism and unscrupulousness that he claims is expressed in the Old Testament.

Tuđman summarized, among other things, that &quot;The Jews provoke envy and hatred but actually they are &#x27;the unhappiest nation in the world&#x27;, always victims of &#x27;their own and others&#x27; ambitions&#x27;, and whoever tries to show that they are themselves their own source of tragedy is ranked among the anti-Semites and the object of hatred by the Jews&quot;. In another part of the book, he expressed the belief that these traits weren&#x27;t unique to the Jews; while criticizing what he alleges to be aggression and atrocities in the Middle East on the part of Israel, he claimed that they arose &quot;from historical unreasonableness and narrowness in which Jewry certainly is no exception&quot;.

In 1994, Tuđman apologized for the remarks made about Jews, stating that in the years since the publication of the book his views on world Jewry had changed. The problematic passages were subsequently edited out in the English version published in 1996, but kept in the Croatian, French and German versions.

On 22 April 1998, Tuđman received the credentials of the first Israeli ambassador to Croatia, Natan Meron. In his speech Tuđman said, among other things: 

==Legacy==



Tuđman is credited by his supporters with creating the basis for an independent Croatia, and helping the country move away from communism. He is sometimes given the title &quot;father of the country&quot; for his role in achieving the country&#x27;s independence. His legacy is still strong in many parts of Croatia as well as in parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina with Croatian majorities; there are schools, squares and streets in some cities named after him, and statues have been erected. In December 2006, a large square near Ilica Street in the Črnomerec section of Zagreb was named after him. In June 2015 Siniša Hajdaš Dončić, Minister of Maritime Affairs Transport and Infrastructure, said that the reconstructed and upgraded Zagreb International Airport will be named after Tuđman.

His tenure as president was criticized as authoritarian by some observers. Goldstein views Tudjman&#x27;s post-war policies negatively, remarking that &quot;between healthy nationalism and chauvinism, he chose chauvinism; between free-market economy and clientelism, he chose the latter. Instead of the cult of freedom, he chose the cult of the state. Between modernity and openness to the world, he chose traditionalism; a fatal choice for a small state like Croatia that needs to open for the sake of development&quot;.

===Public opinion===
Tuđman&#x27;s approval ratings remained largely positive throughout his presidency and were generally evaluated higher than the rest of the government. They increased significantly following the admission of Croatia to membership in the United Nations in May 1992, the successful military operations in January 1993 and August 1995, and the peaceful reintegration of eastern Slavonia in January 1998. Polls showed a drop in support in the second half of 1993, throughout 1994 and in 1996. From early 1998 his approval gradually declined, before increasing slightly in November 1999.

In a December 2002 poll by HRT, 69% voters expressed a positive opinion about Tuđman.

In a June 2011 poll by , 62% voters gave the most credit to Tuđman for the creation of independent Croatia. In December 2014, an Ipsos Puls survey on 600 people showed that 56% see him as a positive figure, 27% said he had both positive and negative aspects, while 14% regard him as a negative figure.

In a survey by Promocija Plus in July 2015, regarding the renaming of Zagreb Airport after Tuđman, a majority of 65.5% showed support for the initiative, 25.8% were opposed to the idea, while 8.6% had no opinion about it.

<text>Germaine Williams (born December 9, 1974), better known by his stage name Canibus, is a Jamaican-American rapper. First having gained recognition for his freestyling abilities, he signed with Universal Records to release his debut studio album, &quot;Can-I-Bus&quot; (1998). He has since released 13 solo studio albums, and several collaborative projects with other rappers as a member of the Four Horsemen, Refugee Camp All-Stars, Sharpshooterz, Cloak N Dagga, the Undergods and one-half of T.H.E.M.

About.com placed him at number 32 on their list of the &quot;Top 50 MCs of Our Time (1987–2007)&quot;, while in 2012 &quot;The Source&quot; placed him number 44 on their list of the Top 50 Lyricists of All Time.

== Early life ==
Williams was born on December 9, 1974, in Kingston, Jamaica. He is of Jamaican descent. His father, Basil Williams, was a Jamaican and West Indian cricketer. The family moved frequently, living in The Bronx; Newark, New Jersey; Washington, D.C.; Atlanta; Miami; Buffalo; and London due to his mother&#x27;s career requiring constant relocation. Canibus stated that he was an introverted child growing up.

After completing high school in 1992, he spent a year working for AT&amp;T Corporation and another year as a data analyst for the U.S. Department of Justice. He studied computer science at DeKalb College in Atlanta.

== Career ==

=== Early career (1992–1996) ===
He began rhyming in the early 1990s and by 1992 under the name &quot;Canibus Sativa&quot;, and formed a duo called T.H.E.M. (The Heralds of Extreme Metaphors) with Atlanta rapper Webb (now called C.I., also known as Central Intelligence). In 1996, T.H.E.M. split and Canibus teamed with businessman Charles Suitt. That same year Charles Suitt introduced Canibus to platinum producer Frankie Cutlass and the two collaborated on a song. Canibus also appeared on the Music Makes Me High remix by the Lost Boyz featuring Tha Dogg Pound making it Canibus&#x27; first official appearance on a record.

In December 1997, Canibus first publicly discussed a verbal confrontation with LL Cool J in an interview with Tourè for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. Also attending the interview were John Forté, DMX, Big Pun, Mos Def and Mic Geronimo. The roundtable discussion was recorded by Kurt Nice and featured in Shades of Hip Hop compilation &quot;Hot 2 Def&quot; in 1998 and re-released in 2004 on &quot;Shades of Hip Hop: The Cypher&quot;.

=== Debut album (1997–1998) ===
Canibus&#x27; debut album &quot;Can-I-Bus&quot; was released on September 8, 1998. The song &quot;Second Round K.O.&quot;, produced by Wyclef Jean, was a success, with the video featuring Wyclef and a cameo appearance by boxer Mike Tyson. This song formed part of Canibus&#x27; famous beef with LL Cool J.

The album contained a lot of socially-conscious material, such as corruption within the U.S. government, AIDS, and violence in modern America.

Canibus had a feud with LL Cool J over a verse that Canibus gave on LL&#x27;s track &quot;4,3,2,1&quot; from his album &quot;Phenomenon&quot;. The track featured Canibus, Method Man, Redman, and DMX. Canibus&#x27;s verse began with the line &quot;Yo LL, is that a mic on your arm? Let me borrow that,&quot; referring to the microphone tattoo on LL Cool J&#x27;s arm which LL Cool J interpreted as Canibus insulting him. When the final cut of the song came out it featured LL Cool J&#x27;s verse after Canibus&#x27;s, mocking an unspecified person believed to be Canibus. 

=== Wyclef feud, second album (1999–2000) ===
Because Wyclef produced the majority of the tracks on &quot;Can-I-Bus&quot;, Williams blamed him for the general dissatisfaction with &quot;Can-I-Bus&quot; and cut ties with him, going as far as to diss Wyclef on the title track of his second album &quot;2000 B.C.&quot; (&quot;You mad at the last album? I apologize for it / Yo, I can&#x27;t call it, motherfucking Wyclef spoiled it!&quot;). 

&quot;2000 B.C.&quot; featured the first collaboration between Canibus and Kurupt, Ras Kass and Killah Priest, a rap supergroup collectively known as The Hrsmn (referring to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse), on the track &quot;Horsementality&quot;. Though following &quot;2000 B.C.&quot;&#x27;s release it had been announced that the group would be releasing an album, these plans never materialized, with only an EP of outtakes from 2001 entitled &quot;The Horsemen Project&quot; released by Killah Priest&#x27;s management in 2003. Since 2000, however, the members of the group have worked together on various songs and rumors of a full-length HRSMN album have persisted and include speculation about collaborations with Pharoahe Monch, Common and Rakim, among others.

Wyclef Jean would respond to Canibus&#x27;s earlier remark on the track &quot;However You Want It&quot; from his album, &quot;The Ecleftic: 2 Sides II a Book&quot;.

Though much bitterness between Canibus and Wyclef Jean remained for a period of time, the two artists finally settled their differences at the end of 2004; they have since worked together on two remixes of the Machel Montano song &quot;Carnival Survivors&quot;. In an interview with HipHopsite.com conducted in November 2005, Williams claimed that he had recorded five songs with Wyclef and Jerry &#x27;Wonder&#x27; Duplessis at Platinum Studios in New York for an upcoming Fugees reunion album.

=== &quot;C True Hollywood Stories&quot; (2001) ===
In 2001, Canibus released his third album, &quot;C True Hollywood Stories&quot;. It was released on Archives Music, an independent label owned by Williams&#x27; future business partner, Louis Lombard III.

In an interview conducted in 2005, Williams&#x27; former promoter, Pak-Man, who worked on over half of the album with the rapper, spoke on the record, with his explanation leaning toward the album being intended as satire: &quot;At that time Canibus was in the studio recording a lot of songs and [I] mean a lot, but he didn&#x27;t want to make the fans wait no more so he did&quot; C True Hollywood Stories &quot;and he wanted to have fun wit, so thats what we did we had fun wit&quot;. In an interview on AllHipHop.com posted on April 8, 2005, Williams was asked what direction he was trying to take with that album; in his response, he stated &quot;That album depicts the state of affairs in my life at the time – nothing more, nothing less&quot;.

=== &quot;Mic Club: The Curriculum&quot; and &quot;Rip the Jacker&quot; (2002–2003) ===
His fourth full-length album &quot;Mic Club: The Curriculum&quot; was released in 2002. Although the production was handled almost entirely by little-known producers, some of them from Europe, the record proved to be a greater critical success than the previous year&#x27;s release. &quot;Mic Club&quot; also saw Canibus return to a more complex rapping style, with a number of concept tracks and few songs with a chorus. The album was released on Mic Club Music, Canibus&#x27; own label, but failed to chart, selling relatively few copies.

Following the release of &quot;Mic Club: The Curriculum&quot;, it was announced that Williams decided to join the United States Army. Before commencing his work with the military, however, he recorded a number of tracks which he intended to be released on his next album, entitled &quot;Rip the Jacker&quot;. Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind was given the task of producing the entire record, equipped solely with Canibus&#x27; pre-recorded vocals. Due to his military obligations, Canibus himself only managed to review the album after having acquired a copy.

Upon release, &quot;Rip the Jacker&quot; received rave reviews from the majority of critics, who noted that Williams&#x27; largely scientific lyrics and distinctive, rough delivery was finally matched by equally fine production, as Canibus had a history of working with badly selected producers. Unlike &quot;Mic Club&quot;, &quot;Rip the Jacker&quot; charted on both &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s R&amp;B/hip-hop charts and the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at #34 and #197.

Critics highlighted various aspects of &quot;Rip the Jacker&quot;&#x27;s originality, both in terms of beats and lyrics; Stoupe had employed a large number of samples from often obscure compositions, while Canibus himself undertook a variety of topics from various perspectives. Of note was the inclusion of &quot;Poet Laureate II&quot;, a song exceeding seven minutes in length and lacking a chorus, with several changes of beat throughout; the track was frequently singled out as one of the strongest in Canibus&#x27; career and the album as a whole convinced listeners and the industry alike that the rapper had not lost his potential.

=== &quot;Mind Control&quot;, Cloak n Dagga and &quot;Hip-Hop for Sale&quot; (2005–2006) ===
Following &quot;Rip the Jacker&quot; and Canibus&#x27; subsequent discharge from the army, an album entitled &quot;Mind Control&quot; (2005) was released to negative reviews. Canibus had never planned for it to be compiled as a separate record, but agreed to release it through the independent Gladiator Music label as part of a contractual agreement; most of the vocals for &quot;Mind Control&quot; had been recorded prior to the release of &quot;C True Hollywood Stories&quot;. A collection of previously recorded material (with only three of the songs being unreleased) produced entirely by Mark Sparks, the album failed to chart and is rarely considered an official Canibus release by the rapper&#x27;s fans.

Also in 2005, a collaboration between Williams and underground rapper Phoenix Orion, who had also been known for scientific lyrics, yielded the album &quot;Def Con Zero&quot;, released on the independent Head Trauma Records label, owned by K-1 kickboxer Dewey Cooper. The record featured guest appearances from Kool G Rap, K-Solo, and former 106 &amp; Park host Free, among others. As Cloak N Dagga, the duo briefly toured the United States promoting the release.

The following month, after numerous delays, Canibus&#x27; seventh solo album, &quot;Hip-Hop for Sale&quot;, was released, but was panned by critics, who dismissed it as yet another failed attempt to gain mainstream recognition. Additionally, due to the earlier release of &quot;Mind Control&quot; and the leaking of most of the material in the form of a mixtape entitled &quot;The Vitruvian Man&quot;, the release date had been pushed back to November, the original date having been May. The production on &quot;Hip-Hop for Sale&quot; was handled in part by Virginia-based producer Nottz, with several relatively unknown producers handling the remaining tracks after Nottz had cut ties with Canibus due to the appearance of &quot;The Vitruvian Man&quot;. The day of &quot;Hip-Hop for Sale&quot;&#x27;s release, &quot;Mic Club Master Volume One&quot;, a separate mixtape, appeared in stores, many of the songs receiving more praise than those present on the full-length album.

=== &quot;For Whom the Beat Tolls&quot; (2007) ===

In January 2007, it was announced that Canibus would release new material in 2007 exclusively on his own imprint, Mic Club Music, in a joint venture with Legion Entertainment and distributed via his former major label, Universal Music Group. A pair of mixtapes, titled &quot;Nothing to Prove&quot; and &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot;, were slated for release in March 2007, but were eventually scrapped; instead, Canibus decided to use the best material from each mixtape to create a new full-length album entitled &quot;For Whom the Beat Tolls&quot;.

When the record was originally announced in March, there was only one confirmed track – the third installment in Canibus&#x27; &quot;Poet Laureate&quot; series, &quot;Poet Laureate Infinity&quot;. The track has 1,000 bars, in the form of five 200 bar verses, and is layered in such a way that &quot;when you mix it and spread it throughout five channels, [you have the ability] to mix the track differently every time&quot;.

&quot;For Whom the Beat Tolls&quot; was originally set for release in May 2007, but was pushed back one month, and a released on June 12, 2007 (though it was not distributed by Universal as previously reported). The album has 16 tracks and includes contributions from Killah Priest and Vinnie Paz, among others, and featured two personally made mixes of the &quot;Poet Laureate Infinity&quot; track (&quot;Poet Laureate Infinity v003&quot; and &quot;Poet Laureate Infinity v004&quot;).

Following the release of &quot;For Whom the Beat Tolls&quot;, Canibus went on a sporadic tour in the U.S. to promote the record. In August 2007, Canibus made an announcement on his Myspace page that he had cut ties with his business partner Louis Lombard: &quot;&quot;To my friends, family and fans, Just wanted everybody to know I no longer do business with Louis Lombard, III &amp; Mic Club Music&quot;.

=== &quot;Melatonin Magik&quot; (2010) ===
In December 2009, it was announced that Canibus was in the process of releasing his 9th studio album &quot;Melatonin Magik&quot;. &quot;Melatonin Magik&quot; was released on February 9, 2010, to relatively positive reviews, being regarded as one of his most focused efforts yet. The album included several guest appearances (DZK~PR~ &amp; Warbux), a marked contrast to many of his previous albums in which he kept features at a minimum.

=== &quot;C of Tranquility&quot; (2010) ===
&quot;C of Tranquility&quot; was released on October 5, 2010. Producers include DJ Premier, Jake One, Scram Jones, Tha Bizness and J-Zone. Originally recorded in 2008, it was sent to Interdependent Media for track mastery and release. Many of the beats were changed, and a few of the tracks were shortened.

=== &quot;Lyrical Law&quot; (2011) ===
Originally intended to be a Melatonin Magik remix album, as more and more guests were invited to feature, Canibus decided to also record new material for the album, and it quickly evolved into an official solo album. In April 2011, it was announced that he would be selling the album through his new website, canibuscatalogue.com in order to have more control over promotion and sale.

A track entitled &quot;Spring Training&quot; was released by Joe Budden two days after &quot;Lyrical Law VS Joey Cupcakes&quot; containing lines directed towards Canibus. To many, the track appears to be a response. This is untrue however, as the track was recorded prior to having a conflict with Canibus. As of June 2011, an official response from either Royce or Budden (aside from brief messages on Twitter) has yet to surface.

=== Canibus vs Dizaster (2012) ===
Canibus completed his first rap battle for King of the Dot on June 9, 2012. Canibus participated in the first two rounds before pulling out a notepad to read his bars during the third round, after admitting defeat and wishing to recite what he said were &quot;30 pages of rhymes&quot; that he had failed to memorize. The battle was part of King of the Dot&#x27;s Fresh Coast division in L.A.

A fake open letter, attributed to Canibus appeared on Tumblr, though it was later debunked by his manager. Canibus later released an official statement on his Facebook page. About the battle itself, Canibus commented that &quot;Sometimes people need laughter and entertainment at the expense of others embarrassment but hip hop means so much to me I don&#x27;t care.&quot;

== Army service ==
In 2002, Canibus signed up for the United States Army. In a 2005 interview, Canibus stated &quot;I enlisted because I wanted to get away from the music... I wanted to do something that gave me a separate definition from what I had done all through my teens and twenties. I was 28 when I enlisted.&quot; In 2004, he was caught smoking cannabis and was subsequently discharged.

<text>Clint Patrick Black (born February 4, 1962) is an American country music singer, songwriter, musician, actor, and record producer. Signed to RCA Nashville in 1989, Black&#x27;s debut album &quot;Killin&#x27; Time&quot; produced four straight number one singles on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks charts. Although his momentum gradually slowed throughout the 1990s, Black consistently charted hit songs into the 2000s. He has had more than 30 singles on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts, twenty-two of which have reached number one, in addition to having released twelve studio albums and several compilation albums. In 2003, Black founded his own record label, Equity Music Group. Black has also ventured into acting, having made appearances in a 1993 episode of the TV series &quot;Wings&quot; and in the 1994 film &quot;Maverick&quot;, as well as a starring role in 1998&#x27;s &quot;Still Holding On: The Legend of Cadillac Jack&quot;.

Black has been nominated for four Grammy Awards for best Country Male Vocal Performance (1990 – &quot;Killin&#x27; Time&quot;, 1997 – &quot;Like the Rain&quot;, 1998 – &quot;Something That We Do&quot;, 1999 – &quot;Nothin&#x27; but the Taillights&quot;), he was also nominated for six Grammy Awards with one win in the category of Best Country Collaboration with Vocals – &quot;Hold On Partner&quot; in 1991 (w/ Roy Rogers), &quot;A Bad Goodbye&quot; in 1993 (w/ Wynonna), &quot;Still Holding On&quot; in 1997 (w/ Martina McBride), &quot;Same Old Train&quot; in 1998 which got the Grammy Award (with Joe Diffie, Merle Haggard, Emmylou Harris, Alison Krauss, Patty Loveless, Earl Scruggs, Ricky Skaggs, Marty Stuart, Pam Tillis, Randy Travis, Travis Tritt and Dwight Yoakam), &quot;When I Said I Do&quot; in 1999 (w/ wife Lisa Hartman Black), and &quot;Hey Good Lookin&#x27;&quot; in 2004 (Jimmy Buffett, Kenny Chesney, Alan Jackson, Toby Keith, and George Strait).

==Early life==
Black was born in Long Branch, New Jersey, the youngest of four children of Ann (Scherma) and Gwin Augusta &quot;G.A.&quot; Black, Jr., and lived in nearby Red Bank. His maternal great-grandfather was of Italian descent, with roots in Palermo, Sicily. The family moved back to Texas, where G.A. Black had been born and raised, before Clint was one year old. He was raised in Katy, Texas. Music was always present in the house. Black taught himself to play harmonica before he was 13, and at 14 wrote his first song. His father remarked that it was at that age that the parents &quot;first noticed that he had a great voice&quot;. By 15, Black had learned to play guitar. As a teenager Black joined his elder brothers, Mark, Kevin and Brian, in their small band. On Saturday afternoons, the family would host backyard barbecues and invite the neighborhood to listen to the boys sing. Some weekends would attract up to 70 people. Black eventually dropped out of high school to play with his brothers, before becoming a solo act.

==Music career==
===1983–1988: Early career===
Black was initially drawn to a variety of musical genres. According to his father, he chose to focus on country music in the early 1980s, after singers George Strait and Reba McEntire moved the genre back toward the more traditional; in the style kept alive by George Jones and Merle Haggard. For six years, Black supported himself as a construction worker, bait cutter, and fishing guide, while singing at various lounges as a solo singer and guitarist. In 1987, at one of the gigs he met another guitarist, Hayden Nicholas. The two men connected musically and began a song writing partnership that would last decades. In the late 1980s, Black delivered a demo of their collaboration &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Home&quot; to record promoter Sammy Alfano. Within two days of that delivery, Black was invited to a meeting with Bill Ham, who managed ZZ Top.

===1989–1991: Breakthrough===
Black soon signed with RCA in October of 1987, and at the time, RCA was considered one of the &quot;most aggressive&quot; labels in country music. His first album, &quot;Killin&#x27; Time&quot;, was released in 1989. Each song on the album was penned at least in part by Black; four of them were attributed solely to him, while the rest were collaborations with Nicholas. In a departure from most other country albums, Black used his road band instead of session musicians to record &quot;Killin&#x27; Time&quot;. The album was a critical and commercial success, reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Albums chart and certified platinum in 1990. He made his debut in 1989 with the single, &quot;A Better Man&quot;, which reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs in early June. This marked the first time in 14 years that a debut single by a male artist had peaked at the top of the chart. In total, five singles off of his debut album reached number one, the first time any country artist had accomplished this feat. Black won the Country Music Association&#x27;s Horizon Award for best newcomer in 1989. At the end of the year, his singles, &quot;A Better Man&quot; and &quot;Killin&#x27; Time&quot; place number one and number two on the year-end country singles charts. It had been 36 years since another artist had claimed both top spots in a single year. Looking back at the early stages of his career, Black recalled: &quot;&#x27;At one point, I knew I crossed this line out of obscurity and I felt like no matter what happened from that point on I would always be remembered for &quot;Killin&#x27; Time&quot;. There was this kind of mixed feeling of remorse and excitement.&#x27;&quot;

In late 1990, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; surveyed country music industry insiders to determine which acts could be expected to sell the most records over the next seven years. Black placed second in the poll, two votes behind Garth Brooks. The survey results were surprising in that 10 of the top 20 artists named were relative newcomers to the industry; in the past, country music had been dominated by artists with several decades experience. The plethora of new acts confused some reviewers, however. Many reviewers lumped many of the new acts together; as &quot;Newsweek&quot;s David Gates wrote: &quot;Good song, good voice, hot band: who cares which one it is this time?&quot; Black soon became known as one of Nashville&#x27;s &quot;hat acts&quot;; like other country artists such as Tracy Lawrence, Alan Jackson, and John Michael Montgomery, Black was a relative newcomer who wore a hat, and had &quot;clean, neotraditional sound with pop appeal&quot;.

&quot;Killin&#x27; Time&quot; was certified platinum in 1990. Black&#x27;s second album, &quot;Put Yourself in My Shoes&quot;, was released in November 1990. It reached number two on the country chart and was in the top 20 on the pop album charts. This success on the pop charts resulted from a change in the way Billboard calculated album sales; a new reliance on Nielsen SoundScan instead of information from selected record stores showed that sales of country albums had previously been under counted. The album did not meet with as much critical acclaim as his debut, but nonetheless still included several hit singles. He began touring with Alabama.

Black has been a member of the Grand Ole Opry since 1991.

===1992: Lawsuits and &quot;The Hard Way&quot;===
In March 1992, Black sued his manager, Bill Ham, for breach of contract; Black sought $2 million in damages and requested that Ham return $4 million in royalties. Under the terms of their initial contract, Ham controlled all publishing royalties for any song that Black wrote or co-wrote for his first eight albums. Because Black wrote all of his own music, this amounted to a fee of 20 to 30 cents per album sold. Industry standards generally counseled songwriters to form their own publication companies, so they would be able to retain more of the royalties.

Ham promptly countersued, blaming the initial lawsuit on poor advice Black received from his new personal assistant, his mother-in-law Jonni Hartman. His lawyer told the press that &quot;Mr. Ham invested $1 million of his own money in Clint Black&#x27;s career at a time when nobody else would do so. For that commitment, Mr. Black should show a little gratitude and honor his contracts&quot;.

By mid-1992, Black&#x27;s first two albums had sold a combined 5 million copies. The difficulties with Ham caused a delay in the release of Black&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Hard Way&quot;, which was released on July 14. The album had been expected the year previously, and during the delay the country music scene changed. Both Alan Jackson and Travis Tritt achieved greater success, and Billy Ray Cyrus became a teen idol. The competition that Black faced was now much stiffer than with his earlier albums.

According to Black, he and producer James Stroud spent more time putting this album together than either of those preceding and were &quot;a lot more aggressive in the way we cut and mixed the album&quot;. Black was also more satisfied with the vocals on this album. Several of the songs on &quot;The Hard Way&quot;, including &quot;Burn One Down&quot;, were initially reported to be Black&#x27;s responses to his situation with Ham. Co writer Nicholas refuted the rumors, maintaining that most of those songs were written in the late 1980s.

To promote the album, Black launched The Hard Way Tour on June 26, 1992. The tour ran for 11 months. Reviewers noticed that with this album Black presented a &quot;new, sexier image&quot;, wearing tighter clothing and in many cases leaving behind his trademark hat. Black commented simply that he was bored wearing the hat all the time.

===1993–1999: Continued success===

Black&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;No Time to Kill&quot; was released almost a year after &quot;The Hard Way&quot;. The album received mixed reviews. The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; noted that Black&#x27;s duet with Wynonna Judd, &quot;A Bad Goodbye&quot;, was &quot;precisely the kind of radio-ready, big-production ballad that record companies tend to force on their artists when they sense that their careers are in trouble...[I]t sticks out like a sore thumb in his body of work.&quot; On the other hand, a review in &quot;Time&quot; magazine thought the duet helped Black show his emotions more intensely. Some reviewers also noted that in some of the more serious songs on the album, Black&#x27;s voice sounded strained. On January 30, 1994, Black performed as part of the &quot;Rockin&#x27; Country Sunday&quot; halftime show at Super Bowl XXVII, along with Judd, Tanya Tucker, Travis Tritt, and Naomi Judd.

&quot;One Emotion&quot; followed in late 1994. Also a platinum certified album in the US, this album accounted for five straight top five hits. First was the number four &quot;Untanglin&#x27; My Mind&quot;, a Merle Haggard co-write. After it came the number three &quot;Wherever You Go&quot;, three-week number one &quot;Summer&#x27;s Comin&#x27;&quot;, the number two title track and finally the number four &quot;Life Gets Away.&quot; The latter two were also number one country hits in Canada.

In 1996, Black became the fourth country music singer to earn a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Later that year, he released his first greatest-hits package. This was led off by the chart-topper &quot;Like the Rain&quot;, which spent three weeks at number one. After it came the number six &quot;Half Way Up&quot;, his first single since &quot;One More Payment&quot; to miss the top five.

Black&#x27;s next album, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Nothin&#x27; but the Taillights&quot;, was released to mediocre reviews. Thom Owens of AllMusic said that the album made no attempt to change his sound, and was &quot;sturdy&quot; but less country than his previous efforts. Lead-off single &quot;Still Holding On&quot;, a duet with labelmate Martina McBride, became his first single to land outside the top 10, with a number 11 peak that year. He soon recovered his chart momentum with the number two &quot;Something That We Do&quot; followed by two straight chart-toppers in the album&#x27;s Steve Wariner-penned title track and &quot;The Shoes You&#x27;re Wearing&quot;. The next two singles – the number 12 &quot;Loosen Up My Strings&quot; and number 29 &quot;You Don&#x27;t Need Me Now&quot; – were less successful.

In 1998, he made a brief foray into big band jazz when he recorded a cover of the Christmas song &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; for the soundtrack of the animated movie of the same name.

In 1999, Black released &quot;D&#x27;lectrified&quot;, which relied completely on acoustic instruments. Nevertheless, &quot;USA Today&quot; thought the &quot;album sounds as full and brash as an electric album since he used creative arrangements and horn sections&quot;. Three of the songs on the albums were remakes of previous Black singles. Several others featured guest appearances by some of Black&#x27;s idols, including Waylon Jennings, Kenny Loggins, and Eric Idle. The songs tended to be longer than most of those played on country radio, with many stretching more than five minutes.

===1999–2013: Later career===
Black and Hartman welcomed their first child, Lily Pearl Black, in May 2001. Black took a three-year break from the music industry to stay home with his daughter. He explained that &quot;it ended up not being a smart career move, but it was a real smart dad move. … I wouldn&#x27;t go back and try to do anything for my career in exchange for that.&quot;

During his sabbatical, Black spent time reassessing his career. After deciding he was unwilling to work within the current recording industry system, he formed his own record label, Equity Music Group. Black admitted that it was difficult to leave RCA. In his 14 years with the label, he had sold over 20 million records.

The new label operated under very different rules than those Black had begun his own career under. Artists were guaranteed ownership of their songs and were granted an equity stake in the label. The first release from the new label was Black&#x27;s next album, &quot;Spend My Time&quot;; his eighth studio album was Black&#x27;s first release in five years. The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; called it &quot;arguably the most adventurous of his career&quot;.

In 2005, Black released &quot;Drinkin&#x27; Songs and Other Logic&quot;. Black chose the title of the album to limit himself to simple topics in his past. He explained: &quot;I went out and bought all the music I grew up on that I didn&#x27;t already have and spent three months listening to only that. Only stuff from before I started making records, so it was pre-1989—Waylon, Willie, Buck Owens, Haggard, Don Williams, Jim Croce. And what I discovered was a simplicity in song that I had moved away from. It was quite an emotional journey because these were all the songs that moved me and inspired me to do what I&#x27;ve been doing ever since.&quot;
Black has continued to record new material, however. In 2007, he released the single &quot;The Strong One&quot; the first original song he has recorded that he did not write. The song was included on his first digital EP, released on March 11, 2008. Titled &quot;The Long Cool EP,&quot; the collection features Black&#x27;s single, &quot;Long Cool Woman&quot;, &quot;The Strong One&quot; and a duet with his wife titled &quot;You Still Get to Me&quot;. Equity Music Group closed its doors in December 2008 due to economic difficulties.

Black was also a judge for the 8th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists.

===2013–present: Return to music===
Since the closure of his label in 2008, Black had intermittently hinted at a new album that never materialized. In 2013, he issued a Cracker Barrel-exclusive album which featured re-recorded versions of some of his biggest hits as well as three new songs. Black stated that he hired the same musicians that had played on the original versions to perform the new ones, and that some songs were approached from a &quot;fresh angle&quot; while others were made to be as close to the originals as possible.

In early 2015, Black appeared with Joe Nichols on the &quot;ACM Superstar Duets&quot; special, which featured modern artists teaming up with older icons that had influenced their music. In July 2015, it was reported that Black had signed a new record deal with independent label Thirty Tigers to release an album of new studio material in the Fall. The record title was revealed shortly thereafter as &quot;On Purpose,&quot; with a release date of September 25. Black&#x27;s next album, &quot;Out of Sane&quot;, was released in 2020.

==Songwriting==
Few country singers fill their albums primarily with their own material, and although RCA Records often pushed Black to record the material of other artists, he refused. Black recorded only his own songs until 2007, when he released the single &quot;The Strong One&quot;. Many of his songs were the result of a collaboration with Hayden Nicholas. Their first collaboration, &quot;Straight From the Factory&quot;, took them only 20 minutes to write, although Nicholas would later comment that &quot;most of &#x27;em weren&#x27;t that easy&quot;.

Many listeners were incredulous that such a young man (27 at the release of his first album) could have such &quot;a remarkably mature perspective&quot;. According to Black, &quot;To me, a song is more than just something to sing. It&#x27;s something to learn from. It&#x27;s somebody else&#x27;s true feeling. I&#x27;m always trying to get at the meaning. ... When I write a line, I&#x27;m doing the same thing. I&#x27;m looking at it from the perspective of if I was driving down the road listening to it, what am I gonna get out of it?&quot;

Many of his songs make clever use of puns and other creative turns of phrase. While the wordplay in many of the songs on his earlier albums was widely appreciated, by the fourth album reviewers felt that the songs were not as high in quality. Rick Mitchell of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; stated his opinion that &quot;The Hard Way&quot; &quot;clever wordplay is no substitute for heartfelt emotion&quot;.

==Film and television==
Shortly after his music career took off, he began receiving offers for acting roles. He turned down every request until 1994, when he was offered a bit part in the star-studded comedy film &quot;Maverick&quot;. Although the part required very little actual acting, after the movie&#x27;s release Black received an increasing number of calls from directors who thought he would be perfect for a particular role. Black has appeared in several television shows, including &quot;Wings&quot; and &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;. He has since starred in the 1998 television film, &quot;Still Holding On: The Legend of Cadillac Jack&quot;, based on the rodeo star Jack Favor, who was falsely accused of double murders in Haughton, Louisiana, in 1967. Lisa Hartman Black portrayed Ponder I. Favor, Jack&#x27;s wife. Black had a major role in another television movie &quot;Going Home&quot;, and appeared briefly in the 2003 film &quot;Anger Management&quot;. In 2000, Black and Hartman guest starred on an episode of &quot;King of the Hill&quot;.

He has also had a presence on various reality television shows. In 2003, Black appeared on &quot;Nashville Star&quot;, where he acted as a mentor to the contestants. Later that year, Clint also appeared on the ABC sitcom Hope &amp; Faith in the episode &quot;Hope and Faith Get Randy&quot;. He later produced the debut album of series winner Buddy Jewell. In 2004, Clint appeared as himself in the TV show &quot;Las Vegas&quot;. In 2008, Black was a contestant on a short-lived CBS reality show, &quot;Secret Talents of the Stars&quot;, in which he practiced stand-up comedy. The following year, he competed on the second season of &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot;. He was fired after the eleventh task, placing himself in fifth place, although he returned as a member of Joan Rivers&#x27;s victorious team in the season finale. In 2009, Black appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot;.

Black has enjoyed his television experiences, describing acting as &quot;another way for me to expand my creative canvas. ... I love to challenge myself.&quot; He believes that most of his fans &quot;just see me as a musician who is stepping into [television and film] temporarily and either doing it alright or not&quot;. More recently, he appeared in the movies &quot;Flicka 2&quot; in 2010 and &quot;&quot; in 2012.

On July 4, 2012, Black appeared on an episode of Lifetime&#x27;s reality series, &quot;Coming Home&quot;, which documents servicemen and women returning to their loved ones in surprise reunions. In the episode, he is featured helping two children write a song about their Army captain father, who is returning from Afghanistan to surprise his family.

On July 24, 2012, Black is surprised by &quot;History Detectives&quot; on PBS. In the episode, the show pays a visit to his Nashville residence, to uncover the story behind an artifact given to him by his wife decades ago.

In 2020, Black and Lisa appeared in season four of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Snow Owls&quot;, notably competing as the series&#x27; first duet competitors while riding in an egg-shaped vehicle.

Clint Black participated in the seventh season of &quot;Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates, Jr.&quot; His episode aired in 2021.

==Musical styles and legacy==
Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, George Strait, and Willie Nelson are Black&#x27;s biggest musical influences. His musical style encompasses traditional country, honky-tonk and Western swing. His voice is described as a smooth baritone and was initially compared to Merle Haggard&#x27;s. Black was self-taught on harmonica, guitar and bass at an early age. On his studio albums he plays acoustic and electric guitars as well as harmonica. In concert he plays primarily guitar, but does play drums and harmonica.

==Personal life==
Black began dating actress Lisa Hartman in 1990. The couple kept their relationship very quiet. The first picture of the two of them together was not published until the week they were engaged. The couple married in Katy, Texas, in October 1991.

Black and Lisa Hartman Black have a daughter, Lily Pearl Black, born in 2001. As of 2002, he and his wife reside in Nashville, Tennessee, after living in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, California.

<text>Denholm Mitchell Elliott (31 May 1922 – 6 October 1992) was an English actor. He appeared in numerous productions on stage and screen, receiving BAFTA awards for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for &quot;Trading Places&quot; (1983), &quot;A Private Function&quot; (1984) and &quot;Defence of the Realm&quot; (1986), and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Mr. Emerson in &quot;A Room with a View&quot; (1985). He is also known for his performances in &quot;Alfie&quot; (1966), &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; (1973), &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977), &quot;Maurice&quot; (1987), &quot;September&quot; (1987), and &quot;Noises Off&quot; (1992). He portrayed Marcus Brody in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981) and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; (1989). On television, Elliott won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in 1981 and was nominated for a second for &quot;Hotel du Lac&quot; (1986).

The American film critic Roger Ebert described Elliott as &quot;the most dependable of all British character actors.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; called him &quot;a star among supporting players&quot; and &quot;an accomplished scene-stealer&quot;. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in 1988.

==Early life==
Elliott was born 31 May 1922, in Kensington, London, the son of Nina (&quot;née&quot; Mitchell; 1893–1966) and Myles Layman Farr Elliott, MBE (1890–1933), a barrister who had read law and Arabic at Cambridge before fighting with the Gloucestershire Regiment at Gallipoli and in Mesopotamia. In 1930, Myles Elliott was appointed solicitor-general to the Mandatory Government in Palestine. Three years later, following a series of controversial government prosecutions, he was assassinated outside the King David Hotel and buried in the Protestant Cemetery on Mount Zion.
Elliott&#x27;s elder brother Neil Emerson Elliott (1920–2003) was a land agent to Lady Anne Cavendish-Bentinck.

Elliott attended Malvern College and joined the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. He was asked to leave after one term. As Elliott later recalled, &quot;They wrote to my mother and said, &#x27;Much as we like the little fellow, he&#x27;s wasting your money and our time. Take him away!&#x27;&quot;

In the Second World War, he joined the Royal Air Force, training as a wireless operator/air gunner and serving with No. 76 Squadron RAF under the command of Leonard Cheshire. On the night of 23/24 September 1942, his Handley Page Halifax DT508 bomber took part in an air raid on the U-boat pens at Flensburg, Germany. The aircraft was hit by flak and subsequently ditched in the North Sea near Sylt, Germany. Elliott and four of his crewmen survived, and he spent the rest of the war in Stalag Luft VIIIb, a prisoner-of-war camp in Lamsdorf (now Łambinowice), Silesia. While imprisoned, he became involved in amateur dramatics. He formed a theatre group that was so successful it toured other POW camps playing &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;.

==Career==
After making his film debut in &quot;Dear Mr. Prohack&quot; (1949) Elliott went on to play a wide range of parts, including an officer in &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; (1953), and often ineffectual and occasionally seedy characters, including the criminal abortionist in &quot;Alfie&quot; (1966) and the washed-up film director in &quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot; (1974). Elliott and Natasha Parry played the main roles in the 1955 television play &quot;The Apollo of Bellac&quot;. He took over for an ill Michael Aldridge for one season of &quot;The Man in Room 17&quot; (1966).

Elliott made many television appearances, which included plays by Dennis Potter such as &quot;Follow the Yellow Brick Road&quot; (1972), &quot;Brimstone and Treacle&quot;, (1976) and &quot;Blade on the Feather&quot; (1980). He starred in the BBC&#x27;s adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27;s short story &quot;The Signalman&quot; (1976). He also co-starred with Jack Palance in the Canadian-American television film &quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1968).

In the 1980s Elliott won three consecutive British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Awards for Best Supporting Actor, for playing the butler to Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy in the American comedy film &quot;Trading Places&quot; (1983), Dr. Swaby in the British comedy film &quot;A Private Function&quot; (1984), and the drunken journalist Vernon Bayliss in the British political thriller film &quot;Defence of the Realm&quot; (1986). He received an Academy Award nomination for playing Mr. Emerson in &quot;A Room with a View&quot; (1985). He also played Dr. Marcus Brody, an academic and friend of Indiana Jones, in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981) and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; (1989). A photograph of his character appears in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; (2008), and a reference is made to Brody&#x27;s death. A statue was also dedicated to Brody outside Marshall College, the school where Indiana Jones teaches. In 1988 Elliott played the Russian mole Povin, around whom the entire plot revolves, in the television miniseries &quot;&quot;.

Having filmed Michael Winner&#x27;s &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot; (1983), Elliott was quoted in a BBC Radio interview as saying that Marc Sinden and he &quot;are the only two British actors I am aware of who have ever worked with Winner more than once, and it certainly wasn&#x27;t for love. But curiously, I never, ever saw any of the same crew twice.&quot; (Elliott in &quot;You Must Be Joking!&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot; and Sinden in &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot; and &quot;Decadence&quot;). Elliott had worked with Sinden&#x27;s father, Donald Sinden, in &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot;. He co-starred with Katharine Hepburn and Harold Gould in the television film &quot;Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry&quot; (1986) and with Nicole Kidman in &quot;Bangkok Hilton&quot; (1989).

In 1988 Elliott was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his services to acting. His career included many stage performances, including with the Royal Shakespeare Company, and an acclaimed turn as the twin brothers in Jean Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;Ring Round the Moon&quot;. His scene-stealing abilities led Gabriel Byrne, his co-star in &quot;Defence of the Realm&quot;, to say, &quot;Never act with children, dogs, or Denholm Elliott.&quot;

Described by the British Film Institute&#x27;s Screenonline as an actor of &quot;versatile understanding and immaculate technique,&quot; Elliott described himself as an instinctive actor and was a critic of Stanislavski&#x27;s system of acting, saying, &quot;I mistrust and am rather bored with actors who are of the Stanislavski school who think about detail.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Secretly bisexual, Elliott was married twice: first to actress Virginia McKenna for a few months in 1954, and later in an open marriage to American actress Susan Robinson, with whom he had two children, Mark and Jennifer (b. Manhattan, New York, USA 8 June 1964), the latter of whom committed suicide at her father&#x27;s home in Santa Eulària des Riu on Ibiza, Spain, in May 2003, after being exposed by the &quot;News of the World&quot; as a drug-addicted prostitute.

Elliott was diagnosed with HIV in 1987 and died of AIDS-related tuberculosis at his home in Santa Eulària des Riu on Ibiza, on 6 October 1992 at the age of 70. Tributes were paid by actors Donald Sinden and Peter Ustinov, the dramatist Dennis Potter, and Virginia McKenna. Sinden said: &quot;He was one of the finest screen actors and a very special actor at that. He was one of the last stars who was a real gentleman. It is a very sad loss.&quot; Ustinov said: &quot;He was a wonderful actor and a very good friend on the occasions that life brought us together.&quot; Potter commented: &quot;He was a complicated, sensitive, and slightly disturbing actor. Not only was he a very accomplished actor, he was a dry, witty, and slightly menacing individual. As a man, I always found him very open, very straightforward and very much to the point.&quot; McKenna added, &quot;It is absolutely dreadful, but the person I am thinking of at the moment more than anybody is his wife. It must be terrible for her.&quot; Ismail Merchant described Elliott as &quot;an all-giving person, full of life ... He had an affection and feeling for other actors, which is very unusual in our business.&quot;

Elliott&#x27;s widow set up a charity, the Denholm Elliott Project, and collaborated on his biography. She worked closely with the UK Coalition of People Living with HIV and AIDS. She died on 12 April 2007, aged 65, in a fire in her flat in Hornsey, London.

<doc id="168308" wikidata="Q933598" url="?curid=168308" title="D'Angelo">
<text>Michael Eugene Archer (born February 11, 1974), better known by his stage name D&#x27;Angelo (), is an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and record producer. He first garnered attention after co-producing the single &quot;U Will Know&quot; for R&amp;B supergroup Black Men United. His debut studio album, &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; (1995), was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and received widespread acclaim from music critics, who have credited the album for ushering in the neo soul movement. His third single, &quot;Lady&quot;, reached the top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

D&#x27;Angelo would then collaborate with artists such as Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and then-girlfriend Angie Stone. His next album, &quot;Voodoo&quot; (2000), debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and continued to receive critical acclaim. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Untitled (How Does It Feel)&quot;, earned him the Grammy Award for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance; likewise, &quot;Voodoo&quot; won Best R&amp;B Album. Following this period, D&#x27;Angelo became increasingly uncomfortable with his growing status as a sex symbol. This was followed by numerous personal struggles, including alcoholism, which resulted in limited musical output for several years.

After over a decade spent mostly out of the public eye, he then released his third studio album, &quot;Black Messiah&quot;, in 2014. The album was met with critical acclaim and peaked at number five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The same year, D&#x27;Angelo was hailed as the next Marvin Gaye by &quot;GQ&quot;. D&#x27;Angelo also contributed to the soundtrack for the 2018 video game &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot;, performing the song &quot;Unshaken&quot;.

== Early life ==
D&#x27;Angelo was born Michael Eugene Archer in South Richmond, Virginia. His father was a Pentecostal preacher and D&#x27;Angelo was raised in an entirely Pentecostal family. Archer&#x27;s musical talents were discovered very early as a child. He was 3 when he was spotted by his 10-year-old brother playing the house piano. After the formation of his native-Richmond, Virginia musical group, he and Precise found success performing in the Amateur Night competition at Harlem, New York&#x27;s Apollo Theater in 1991. The 18-year-old dropped out of school and moved to New York City as an attempt to develop his music career. The group previously enjoyed some notice in Richmond, evenly dividing their repertoire between soul covers and originals while D&#x27;Angelo accumulated compositions of his own and developed his songwriting skills. The group&#x27;s turnout on Amateur Night resulted in three consecutive wins and cash prize, and upon returning home to Richmond, D&#x27;Angelo was inspired to produce an album and began composing material. This took place after a brief tenure as a member of the hip hop group I.D.U. (Intelligent, Deadly but Unique).

== Career ==
=== 1991–1995: &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; ===
At the age of 17, D&#x27;Angelo met Afropunk Festival partner Jocelyn Cooper, who signed him to Midnight Songs LLC, her joint venture publishing company administered by Universal Music Publishing Group after hearing a demo of the hip hop group I.D.U. (Intelligent, Deadly but Unique), which D&#x27;Angelo produced and rapped in. After signing, Cooper introduced D&#x27;Angelo to musicians Raphael Saadiq, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, and Angie Stone to collaborate as songwriters. Cooper then introduced D&#x27;Angelo to Fred Davis, Head of A&amp;R and Gary Harris at EMI Music. After an impressive audition D&#x27;Angelo was signed to a recording contract in 1993. Cooper also introduced D&#x27;Angelo to attorney Kedar Massenburg who helped negotiate his contract. Massenburg later became D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s manager.

In 1994, his first significant success came in the form of the hit single &quot;U Will Know&quot;. D&#x27;Angelo co-wrote and co-produced the song for the all-male R&amp;B supergroup Black Men United, which featured R&amp;B singers such as Brian McKnight, Usher, R. Kelly, Boyz II Men, Raphael Saadiq, and Gerald Levert. D&#x27;Angelo composed the music for &quot;U Will Know&quot;, while his brother, Luther Archer, Midnight Songs LLC writer, wrote the lyrics. Originally featured on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Jason&#x27;s Lyric&quot; (1994), the single peaked at number 5 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks and at number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The music video for &quot;U Will Know&quot; featured D&#x27;Angelo as the group&#x27;s choir director; he reprised the role for the live performance of the song at the Soul Train Music Awards. That same year, he wrote and produced the song &quot;Overjoyed&quot; for the Boys Choir of Harlem, which appeared on their studio album &quot;The Sound of Hope&quot; (1994). The success of &quot;U Will Know&quot; helped build the buzz surrounding D&#x27;Angelo, which was followed by a number of highly promoted showcases, and added to the buzz among music industry insiders.

&quot;Brown Sugar&quot; was released in July 1995. Although sales were sluggish at first, the album was eventually a hit. The album debuted at number six on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B Albums chart in the week of July 22, 1995. It ultimately peaked at number four in the week of February 24, 1996, and spent a total of 54 weeks on the chart. &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; also spent 65 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and peaked at number 22 on the chart. It sold 300,000 copies within its two months of release. The album had been selling 35,000 to 40,000 copies a week through to November 1995, and by January 1996, it had sold 400,000 copies. With the help of its four singles, including the gold-selling &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hit &quot;Lady&quot; and R&amp;B top-ten singles &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and &quot;Cruisin&quot;, the album reached sales of 500,000 copies in the United States by October 1995. On February 7, 1996, it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, following shipments in excess of one million copies in the U.S. The album was certified gold in Canada on May 9, 2000. Its total sales have been estimated within the range of 1.5 million to over two million copies.

=== 1996–2000: Reduced activity and &quot;Voodoo&quot; ===
Following the success of his debut album &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; in 1995, D&#x27;Angelo became less active in the music scene and released limited solo work. After touring for two years to promote the album &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;, D&#x27;Angelo suffered from writer&#x27;s block. Of the setback, D&#x27;Angelo later stated &quot;The thing about writer&#x27;s block is that you want to write so fucking bad, [but] the songs don&#x27;t come out that way. They come from life. So you&#x27;ve got to live to write.&quot; During this period, he generally released cover versions and remakes, such as a cover of the Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell duet song &quot;Your Precious Love&quot; with Erykah Badu for the soundtrack to &quot;High School High&quot; (1996). D&#x27;Angelo also covered Prince&#x27;s &quot;She&#x27;s Always in My Hair&quot; for the &quot;Scream 2&quot; soundtrack (1997), as well as the Ohio Players&#x27; &quot;Heaven Must Be Like This&quot; for the &quot;Down in the Delta&quot; soundtrack (1998). He also appeared on a duet, &quot;Nothing Even Matters&quot;, with Lauryn Hill for her debut solo album &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; (1998).

The much-delayed follow-up to &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;, &quot;Voodoo&quot;, was released in 2000 on Virgin Records after EMI Records Group was absorbed by the label. &quot;Voodoo&quot; received rave reviews from contemporary music critics, who dubbed it a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s greatest work. The album debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 320,000 copies in its first week. It entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 on February 12, 2000, and remained on the chart for 33 consecutive weeks. As of 2005, the album has sold over 1.7 million copies in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan. In 2001, &quot;Voodoo&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Album at the 43rd Grammy Awards which was awarded to D&#x27;Angelo and recording engineer Russell Elevado. The album was executive produced by then manager and creative collaborator, Dominique Trenier.

Its first two singles, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Pie&quot; and &quot;Left &amp; Right&quot;, peaked at number 69 and number 70 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The latter was commercially aimed at R&amp;B and hip hop-oriented radio stations due to the prominence of rappers Redman and Method Man on the track. According to Rich Ford, Jr., producer of the &quot;Left &amp; Right&quot; music video, both the single and the video went commercially unnoticed due to MTV&#x27;s refusal to place the song&#x27;s video in rotation, serving as punishment for missing the deadline for its initial premiere. The fifth single &quot;Feel Like Makin&#x27; Love&quot; was less successful, reaching number 109 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks. &quot;Send It On&quot;, the album&#x27;s fourth single, achieved moderate chart success, peaking at number 33 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Pop Singles chart. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Untitled (How Does It Feel)&quot;, became its greatest chart success, peaking at number 25 on the Hot 100 Singles and at number two on the R&amp;B Singles chart. Its infamous music video helped in boosting the song&#x27;s appeal, as well as D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s. &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote of the video, &quot;It&#x27;s pure sexuality. D&#x27;Angelo, muscularly cut and glistening, is shot from the hips up, naked, with just enough shown to prompt a slow burning desire in most any woman who sees it. The video alone could make the song one of the biggest of the coming year&quot;. It earned three nominations for the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year, Best R&amp;B Video, and Best Male Video.

=== 2001–2013: Personal struggles and delayed album ===
Towards the end of his worldwide tour in support of the album that same year, D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s personal issues had worsened, affecting performances. He became more conscious of and uncomfortable with his status as a sex symbol, and after the tour D&#x27;Angelo returned to his home in Richmond, Virginia, disappearing from the public eye. Several of D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s peers and affiliates have noted the commercial impact of the &quot;Untitled (How Does It Feel)&quot; music video and &quot;The Voodoo Tour&quot; as contributing factors to D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s period of absence from the music scene. His former music manager, Dominique Trenier, explained his disappointment in the music video&#x27;s impact in a 2008 interview for &quot;Spin&quot; magazine. Trenier was quoted as saying that &quot;to this day, in the general populace&#x27;s memory, he&#x27;s the naked dude&quot;.

According to tour manager Alan Leeds, the experience &quot;took away his confidence, because he&#x27;s not convinced why any given fan is supporting him.&quot;
Following the suicide of his close friend, MTV-affiliate Fred Jordan, in April 2001, he started to develop a drinking problem. As his alcoholism escalated, plans for a live album and a Soultronics studio effort, both originally set for after the tour, were scrapped, and impatient Virgin executives cut off funding for the expected 2004 solo album.

By 2005, D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s girlfriend had left him, his attorney had become displeased with him, and most of his family was not in touch with him. He also parted ways with manager Dominique Trenier and tour manager Alan Leeds. After a car accident and an arrest on DUI and marijuana possession charges, D&#x27;Angelo left Virgin Records in 2005 and checked into the Crossroads Centre rehabilitation clinic in Antigua. In 2005, his recording contract was acquired by J Records, following rumors of D&#x27;Angelo signing to Bad Boy Records. Despite no solo output, D&#x27;Angelo collaborated with some R&amp;B and hip hop artists during this period between albums, appearing on albums such as J Dilla&#x27;s &quot;The Shining&quot; (2006), Snoop Dogg&#x27;s &quot;Tha Blue Carpet Treatment&quot; (2006), Common&#x27;s &quot;Finding Forever&quot; (2007), and Q-Tip&#x27;s &quot;The Renaissance&quot; (2008).

D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s subsequent solo work was extensively delayed. Production for a full-length follow-up to &quot;Voodoo&quot; was stagnant, as he was working on and off mostly by himself during 2002. D&#x27;Angelo attempted to play every instrument for the project, striving for complete creative control similar to that of Prince. Russell Elevado described the resulting material as &quot;Parliament/Funkadelic meets the Beatles meets Prince, and the whole time there&#x27;s this Jimi Hendrix energy&quot;. However, those who previewed its songs found it to be unfinished. In the years that followed, D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s personal problems worsened, descending to drug and alcohol addiction. In January 2005 he was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine. Various mugshots began circulating around the time, showing the singer looking overweight and unhealthy, in stark contrast to the muscular D&#x27;Angelo seen in promotion for &quot;Voodoo&quot;. In September 2005, a week after being sentenced on the drug charges, he was involved in a car accident, and was rumoured to be critically injured. However, a week after the crash a statement was issued by D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s attorney stating that he was fine continuing to say &quot;He is anxious to finish the recording of his soul masterpiece that the world has patiently awaited.

No more was revealed on the new album until 2007, when Questlove leaked an unfinished track on Triple J Radio in Australia. Entitled &quot;Really Love&quot;, the track was an acoustic flavored jam with a laid back swing feel. The leak apparently soured relations between the two. D&#x27;Angelo released a CD/DVD compilation album entitled &quot;The Best So Far…&quot;, first released on June 24, 2008 on Virgin Records. The compilation features songs from his two previous studio albums, &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and &quot;Voodoo&quot;, as well as rarities and a second disc, a DVD of previously unreleased videos. Around the same time, the compilation was released digitally without the Erykah Badu and Raphael Saadiq featured songs, under the title &quot;Ultimate D&#x27;Angelo.&quot;

In late November 2011, D&#x27;Angelo announced a series of 2012 European tour dates. The tour kicked off January 26 in Stockholm, Sweden with its final show on February 10. The tour featured a selection of hits from his two previous albums and songs from his upcoming album, which was close to completion. He premiered 4 new songs: &quot;Sugah Daddy&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Easy&quot;, &quot;Another Life&quot; and &quot;The Charade&quot; which were well received. On June 9, 2012, he joined Questlove for the annual Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival&#x27;s Superjam. He didn&#x27;t play any of his original material and this marked the first time in nearly 12 years that he performed on stage in the US. On September 1, 2012, D&#x27;Angelo performed at Jay-Z&#x27;s Made in America festival where he again performed the new songs, &quot;The Charade&quot; and &quot;Sugah Daddy&quot;. On October 7, RCA Music Group announced that it was closing J Records, Arista Records, and Jive Records. With the shutdown, D&#x27;Angelo (and all other artists previously signed to those labels) would release his future material on RCA Records.

===2014–2020: &quot;Black Messiah&quot; and &quot;Unshaken&quot;===
D&#x27;Angelo released his third studio album, &quot;Black Messiah&quot; in December 2014. D&#x27;Angelo originally wanted to release &quot;Black Messiah&quot; in 2015, but the controversial decisions in the Ferguson and Eric Garner cases inspired him to release it earlier. On December 12, 2014, Kevin Liles, D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s manager, shared a 15-second teaser of the album on YouTube. Two days later, the track &quot;Sugah Daddy&quot;, which had been part of D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s set list since 2012, premiered at 3am EST and 1,000 downloads were available on Red Bull&#x27;s 20 Before 15 website. After an exclusive listening party in New York produced by Afropunk festival founder Matthew Morgan and Jocelyn Cooper, &quot;Black Messiah&quot; was released digitally on December 15 through iTunes, Google Play Music, and Spotify. The album&#x27;s unexpected release was compared to Beyoncé&#x27;s self-titled release in 2013. On January 13, 2015, &quot;Really Love&quot; was released to urban adult contemporary radio in the US.

The album was met with universal acclaim from critics and it currently has a 95/100 mean score on review aggregator Metacritic. In its first week of release, &quot;Black Messiah&quot; debuted at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold 117,000 copies in the United States. In its second week, the album dropped to number twenty five on the chart and sold another 40,254 copies. In the United Kingdom, it debuted at number 47 on the UK Albums Chart with first-week sales of 7,423 copies.
D&#x27;Angelo supported &quot;Black Messiah&quot; with a tour called &quot;The Second Coming&quot;. His band, once called &quot;The Testimony&quot; and later renamed &quot;The Vanguard&quot;, includes drummer Chris Dave, bassist Pino Palladino, guitarists Jesse Johnson (The Time) and Isaiah Sharkey, vocalists Kendra Foster (sometimes replaced by Joi Gilliam), Jermaine Holmes, and Charles &quot;Redd&quot; Middleton, keyboardist Cleo &quot;Pookie&quot; Sample, jazz trumpeter Keyon Harrold, saxophonist Kenneth Whalum manning the horn section, and D&#x27;Angelo as the lead vocalist, playing the electric grand piano, electric guitar, and even the band&#x27;s conductor at certain moments. D&#x27;Angelo and The Vanguard&#x27;s &quot;Second Coming Tour&quot; commenced in New York on February 7, 2015, and concluded in Austin on November 6, 2015, with a total of 57 shows in Europe, Asia and North America. At the 58th Annual Grammy Awards, &quot;Black Messiah&quot; won Best R&amp;B Album while &quot;Really Love&quot; won Best R&amp;B Song and was nominated for Record of the Year. &quot;Black Messiah&quot;, Beyoncé&#x27;s self-titled album (2013), Run the Jewels&#x27; &quot;Run the Jewels 2&quot; (2014), and Kendrick Lamar&#x27;s &quot;To Pimp a Butterfly&quot; (2015) were noted as laying the groundwork down for the politically charged releases that happened in 2016, which included Rihanna&#x27;s &quot;Anti&quot;, Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;The Life of Pablo&quot;, and Beyonce&#x27;s &quot;Formation&quot;.

In June 2015, D&#x27;Angelo confirmed to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he was working on more material for a new album, calling it &quot;a companion piece&quot; to &quot;Black Messiah&quot;. D&#x27;Angelo performed Prince&#x27;s &quot;Sometimes it Snows in April&quot; on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; in April 2016 accompanied by Maya Rudolph and Gretchen Lieberum as a tribute to the musician, appearing &#x27;overcome with emotion&#x27; at the passing of a major influence. D&#x27;Angelo contributed to the soundtrack for the 2018 video game &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot;. He sang on the song &quot;Unshaken&quot; which was produced by Daniel Lanois. He had previously served as a playtester for the game itself due to his love for the series. The game&#x27;s music team eventually invited him to perform on a song, which was finished in a week. &quot;Unshaken&quot; was later released as a digital single on January 4, 2019.

=== 2021–present: &quot;Verzuz&quot; and upcoming fourth album===
On February 14, 2021, D&#x27;Angelo appeared on Instagram Live to announce that he would be performing at the Apollo Theater on February 27, 2021, in cooperation with the American webcast &quot;Verzuz&quot;. The event was billed as &quot;D&#x27;Angelo VS Friends&quot; and featured no opponents; instead, D&#x27;Angelo performed a solo set with shared performances with his peers and collaborators, Keyon Harrold, Method Man &amp; Redman, and H.E.R..

On June 10, 2021, D&#x27;Angelo performed at the 2021 Tribeca Film Festival in New York City for &quot;The Songs of Red Dead Redemption 2&quot;. He performed his 2019 single &quot;Unshaken&quot;, which was his contribution to the game&#x27;s soundtrack. D&#x27;Angelo performed as a guitarist and the lead vocalist, with soundtrack producer Daniel Lanois, singer Rhiannon Giddens, and members of his band &quot;D&#x27;Angelo and The Vanguard&quot;, including guitarist Jesse Johnson and vocalists Jermaine Holmes and Charles Middleton by his side.

In 2024, he featured alongside Jay-Z on the song &quot;I Want You Forever&quot; from the soundtrack to the film The Book of Clarence. In September 2024, Raphael Saadiq said &quot;D&#x27;s in a good space,&quot; and that D&#x27;Angelo was working on a new album.

==Artistry and influences==
In a 1995 interview, he discussed the influence that musician Prince had on his approach to recording his debut album, stating &quot;I was one of those guys who read the album credits and I realized that Prince was a true artist. He wrote, produced, and performed, and that&#x27;s the way I wanted to do it.&quot; According to D&#x27;Angelo, the hip hop influence present on the album &quot;came from the Native Tongues movement – Tribe Called Quest, Gang Starr and Main Source.&quot; In a February 1999 interview with music journalist Touré, D&#x27;Angelo discussed his original inspirations to produce music, stating &quot;The sound and feel of my music are going to be affected by what motivates me to do it&quot;. On his visit to South Carolina, D&#x27;Angelo stated that he &quot;went through this tunnel, through gospel, blues, and a lot of old soul, old James Brown, early, early Sly and the Family Stone, and a lot of Jimi Hendrix&quot;, and &quot;I learned a lot about music, myself, and where I want to go musically&quot;. In the same interview, he cited the deaths of rappers Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. as having a great effect on him during the period. During the production of his second studio album D&#x27;Angelo recorded numerous hours of unreleased, original material, as well as covers of his influencers&#x27; material. Collectively referred to by D&#x27;Angelo as &quot;yoda&quot;, these influencers included soul artist Al Green, funk artist George Clinton, and Afrobeat artist Fela Kuti.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked D&#x27;Angelo at number 75 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

==Personal life==
D&#x27;Angelo has never married. In the 1990s, he dated soul singer Angie Stone. She was his muse for his &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; album and he helped her produce her debut album &quot;Black Diamond&quot;, released in 1999. Angie Stone and D&#x27;Angelo have a son together, born in 1998. D&#x27;Angelo also has two other children: a daughter, born in 1999; and a son, born in 2010.

<doc id="168309" wikidata="Q213374" url="?curid=168309" title="James Connolly">
<text>James Connolly (; 5 June 1868 – 12 May 1916) was a Scottish-born Irish republican, socialist, and trade union leader, executed for his part in the 1916 Easter Rising against British rule in Ireland. He remains an important figure both for the Irish labour movement and for Irish republicanism.

He became an active socialist in Scotland, where he had been born in 1868 to Irish parents. On moving to Ireland in 1896, he established the country&#x27;s first socialist party, the Irish Socialist Republican Party. It called for an Ireland independent not only of Britain&#x27;s Crown and Parliament, but also of British &quot;capitalists, landlords and financiers&quot;.

From 1905 to 1910, he was a full-time organiser in the United States for the Industrial Workers of the World, choosing its syndicalism over the doctrinaire Marxism of Daniel DeLeon&#x27;s Socialist Labor Party of America, to which he had been initially drawn. Returning to Ireland, he deputised for James Larkin in organising for the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, first in Belfast and then in Dublin.

In Belfast, he was frustrated in his efforts to draw Protestant workers into an all-Ireland labour and socialist movement but, in the wake of the industrial unrest of 1913, acquired in Dublin what he saw as a new means of striking toward the goal of a Workers&#x27; Republic. At the beginning of 1916, he committed the union&#x27;s militia, the Irish Citizen Army (ICA), to the plans of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and the Irish Volunteers, for war-time insurrection.

Alongside Patrick Pearse, Connolly commanded the insurrection in Easter of that year from rebel garrison holding Dublin&#x27;s General Post Office. He was wounded in the fighting and, following the rebel surrender at the end of Easter week, was executed along with the six other signatories to the Proclamation of the Irish Republic.

==Early life==
Connolly was born in the Cowgate or &quot;Little Ireland&quot; district of Edinburgh in 1868, the third son of Mary McGinn and John Connolly, a labourer, both Irish immigrants his mother from Ballymena, County Antrim and his father from County Monaghan. Throughout his life he was to speak with a Scottish accent.

Relying on his biographer Desmond Greaves, most accounts of his life suggest that it was with the British Army that Connolly first came to Ireland. Greaves reports that Connolly reminisced about being on military guard duty in Cork Harbour on the night in December 1882 when Maolra Seoighe was hanged for the Maamtrasna massacre (the killing of a landlord and his family). This might suggest that, having been listed in the census of the previous year as a 12-year old baker&#x27;s apprentice, Connolly had falsified his age and name to enlist in the 1st Battalion, King’s Liverpool Regiment (recruited heavily from the Irish in Britain). If so, it is possible the Connolly also saw service in County Meath during the Land War and in Belfast during the town&#x27;s deadly sectarian riots in 1886. But absent documentation of his military service, this is a matter of speculation. According to Nora, her father left the army in February 1889 and returned to Scotland. 

In Dublin, Connolly had met Lillie Reynolds, and in the New Year, 1890, she followed him to Scotland where, with special dispensation (Reynolds was Protestant) they married in a Catholic church.

==Socialist republican ==
=== Scottish Socialist Federation ===
Again following in the example of his brother John, in 1890 Connolly joined the Scottish Socialist Federation, succeeding his brother as its secretary in 1893. Largely a propaganda organisation, the Federation supported Keir Hardie and his Independent Labour Party in the campaign for labour representation in Parliament.

Within the SSF, Connolly was greatly influenced by John Leslie, 12 years his senior, but like him born to poor Irish immigrants. While Leslie did not envisage Ireland breaking the English connection before the advent of a socialist Britain, he was to encourage Connolly in the creation of a separate socialist party in Ireland.

In 1896, after the birth of his third daughter, and having lost, while standing for election to the city-council, his municipal carter&#x27;s job, and then failed as a cobbler, Connolly considered a future for his family in Chile. But thanks to an appeal by John Leslie, he had the offer of employment in Dublin as a full-time secretary for the Dublin Socialist Club, at £1 per week.

=== Irish Socialist Republican Party ===
In Dublin, where he first became a navvy and then a proof reader, Connolly soon split the Socialist Club, forming in its stead the Irish Socialist Republican Party (ISRP). In what was then, if briefly, the &quot;literary centre of advanced nationalism&quot;, Alice Milligan&#x27;s Belfast monthly, &quot;The Shan Van Vocht&quot;, he published a first statement of the party credo, &quot;Socialism and Nationalism&quot;&quot;, This suggested that, even if a step toward formal independence, the legislature that the Irish Parliamentary Party wished to see restored in Dublin would be a mockery of Irish national aspirations.If you remove the English army tomorrow and hoist the green flag over Dublin Castle, unless you set about the organisation of the Socialist Republic your efforts would be in vain. England would still rule you. She would rule you through her capitalists, through her landlords, through her financiers, through the whole array of commercial and individualist institutions she has planted in this country and watered with the tears of our mothers and the blood of our martyrs.By the same token, Connolly implied that there was little to be expected from the &quot;Irish Language movements, Literary Societies or 1798] Commemoration Committees&quot; of Milligan and of their mutual friends in Dublin (Arthur Griffith, Maud Gonne, and Constance Markievicz whom Connolly was to join in &quot;to-hell-with-the-British-empire&quot; protests against Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee and the Boer War). There could be no lasting progress toward an Irish Ireland without acknowledging that, as a force that &quot;irresistibly destroys all national or racial characteristics&quot;, capitalism was the Celtic Revival&#x27;s &quot;chief enemy&quot;.

Milligan, who deferred to the Irish Republican Brotherhood (in 1899 they had her pass her subscription list to Griffith and his new weekly, the &quot;United Irishman&quot;, the forerunner of &quot;Sinn Féin&quot;), confined her response to Connolly&#x27;s ambition to contest Westminster elections. Were the ISRP successful, she predicted &quot;an alliance with the English Labour&quot; no less debilitating than the courtship of English Liberals had proved for the Irish Parliamentary Party. In the event, Ireland&#x27;s first socialist party, garnering only a few hundred votes, failed to elect Connolly to Dublin City Council and never exceeded more than 80 active members.

Connolly was dispirited and at odds with the ISRP&#x27;s other leading light, E. W. Stewart, manager of the party&#x27;s paper, &quot;The Worker&#x27;s Republic&quot; and also sometime candidate for the city council. He accused Stewart of &quot;reformism&quot;, of failing to appreciate that &quot;the election of a socialist to any public body is only valuable insofar as it is the return of a disturber of the public peace”. In 1900, Connolly had supported the American Marxist Daniel De Leon in condemning the decision by the French socialist Alexander Millerand, at the height of the Dreyfus Affair, to accept a post in Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau’s government of “Republican Defence”.

== Union and party organiser ==
=== America: Industrial Workers of the World ===

In September 1902, at the invitation of De Leon&#x27;s Socialist Labor Party, Connolly departed for a four-month lecture tour of the United States. Addressing largely Irish-American audiences, he emphasised that he spoke for class, not country:I represent only the class to which I belong…I could not represent the entire Irish people on account of the antagonistic interests of these classes, no more than the wolf could represent the lambs or the fisherman the fish.On his return, Connolly had his resignation from the IRSP accepted without demur. He returned to Scotland for the Social Democratic Federation, where, after witnessing the organisation&#x27;s expulsion of &quot;De Leonists&quot;, he decided on a future in America.

On arrival in the United States, and before he could call on his family to join him, Connolly lived with cousins in Troy, New York, and found work as a salesman for insurance companies. But by 1905, and after being elected to the national executive of the Socialist Labor Party, he had returned to political work. With De Leon&#x27;s endorsement, he was an organiser for the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), the &quot;One Big Union&quot;.

Finding employment with the Singer Sewing Machine in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and living in The Bronx, he befriended the young Elizabeth Gurley Flynn (daughter of a neighbouring couple from Galway), who was to become the &quot;Wobblies&quot; chief agitator among the largely immigrant women of the east-coast textile industry. Together they were supported by Mother Jones, &quot;America’s Most Dangerous Woman”, the Wobblies&#x27; co-founder and a veteran organiser for the United Mine Workers whom Connolly had learnt to admire from Ireland.

With Flynn, and with ex-ILP member Patrick L. Quinlan, in 1907 Connolly formed the Irish Socialist Federation (ISF) to promote the SLP&#x27;s message among Irish immigrants. It had branches in New York City and Chicago, and Connolly edited its weekly the &quot;Harp&quot;.

Under the influence of the IWW, a &quot;mass movement, whose militancy was unequalled&quot;, Connolly began to turn away from what was an &quot;unashamedly vanguard party&quot;. In April 1908, and after a bitter dispute in which De Leon accused him of being a police spy, Connolly left the SLP, and at its Chicago conference, the IWW expelled the party. In the new year, together with Mother Jones, Connolly and the ISF affiliated with the Socialist Party of America, a broader coalition more tolerant of their revolutionary syndicalism.

=== ITGWU leader in Belfast ===

Through the ISF Connolly re-established links with socialists in Ireland, and in 1909 he transferred the production of the &quot;Harp&quot; to Dublin. The following year, James Larkin persuaded the Socialist Party of Ireland (SPI) to raise the funds that would enable Connolly and his family to return. In January 1909, Larkin had established the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, his own model of the One Big Union. The same year, 1911, in which Connolly&#x27;s occupation was listed on the census return as &quot;National Organiser Socialist Party, Larkin sent him north to Belfast to organise for the ITGWU in Ulster.

In a city in which the Protestant-dominated apprenticed trades were organised in British-aligned craft unions, troops had been deployed in 1907 to break strikes Larkin had called among dock labourers, carters and other casual and general workers. Four years later, Connolly succeeded in bringing dockers out in sympathy with striking cross-channel seamen, and in the process to secure a pay increase. ITGWU membership grew, and Connolly was approached by women toiling in Belfast&#x27;s largest industry, linen.

The sweated trade engaged thousands of women and girls both in mills and, unprotected by the Factory Acts, as outworkers. A Belfast Trades Council sponsored Textile Operatives Society, led by Mary Galway, concentrated only on the better-paid Protestant women in the making-up sections. In response to the speeding up of production in the mills and, relatedly, the fining of workers for such new offences as laughing, whispering and bringing in sweets (the creation, in Connolly words, of &quot;an atmosphere of slavery&quot;), thousands of spinners went out on strike.

As they did not yet have the union organisation and the strike funds to sustain the action, Connolly persuaded the women to return to work and apply tactics he had learned as an organiser for the IWW. They should collectively defy the rules, so that &quot;if a girl is checked for singing, let the whole room start singing at once; if you are checked for laughing, let the whole room laugh at once&quot;. He then sought to capitalise on the relative success of the tactic by building up, first with Marie Johnson and then Winifred Carney as its secretary, a neweffectively women&#x27;ssection of the ITGWU, the Irish Textile Workers&#x27; Union (ITWU).

In June 1913, while claiming that &quot;the ranks of the Irish Textile Workers’ Union are being recruited by hundreds&quot;, with Carney, Connolly produced a &quot;Manifesto to the Linen Slaves of Belfast (&quot;1913). It revealed their frustration as organisers: if the world deplored their conditions, the women were told that it also deplored their &quot;slavish and servile nature in submitting to them&quot;.&#x27; The Textile Workers&#x27; membership may not have greatly exceeded the 300 subscribed under Johnson in Catholic west Belfast.&#x27; To Carney, Connolly conceded that the union&#x27;s survival was largely a matter of &quot;keeping the Falls Road crowd together&quot;.

Sectarian division within the labour movement in Belfast had been heightened by the return of Home Rule to the political agenda (from 1910, a Liberal government was again dependent on Irish votes). When, in the summer of 1912, a Home Rule Bill was introduced, loyalists forced some 3,000 workers out of the shipyards and engineering plants: in addition to Catholics, 600 Protestants targeted for their non-sectarian labour politics. In this environment, Connolly found himself increasingly confined to organising, and to addressing meetings, in the Catholic districts of the city.&quot;&quot; Even here he was pursued by what he described as &quot;social and religious terrorism&quot;.

Connolly had to find some &quot;corner of the Catholic ghetto outside the political preserve of Joseph Devlin MP&quot;. Although a sometime ally (Devlin initiated Home Office inquiry into conditions in the linen mills), the Belfast West MP was leader both of those Connolly viewed as &quot;the conservatives of a belated Irish capitalism&quot;, the United Irish League, and those who he dismissed as &quot;Green&quot; Orangemen, the Ancient Order of Hibernians. Together, Connolly found them capable of bringing &quot;every species of intimidation and bribery . . . to bear upon Catholics who refused to bow to the dictates of the official Home Rule gang&quot;.

=== Dublin lock-out ===

On 29 August 1913, Larkin recalled Connolly to Dublin. The success of the ITGWU in signing up thousands of unskilled men and women had elicited a particularly aggressive reaction from employers. Beginning with, and led by, the owner of the tramway company, William Murphy, they dismissed those who refused to renounce the union and replaced them with scab labour brought in from elsewhere in the country or from Britain. By the end of September, the combination of the &quot;lock out&quot;, the sympathetic strikes Larkin called for in response, and their knock-on effects, had placed upwards of 100,000 people (workers and their families, a third of the city&#x27;s residents) in need of assistance.

Early in the conflict Connolly freed himself from police detention through a week-long hunger strike, a tactic borrowed from the British suffragettes. However, from October Larkin was held on charges of sedition. This left Connolly to respond to an intercession by the Catholic Church.

In the hope of replicating a tactic that for Elizabeth Gurley Flynn had turned the tide in the recent, and celebrated, textile strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts, Dora Montefiore had devised a children&#x27;s &quot;holiday scheme&quot;. The poorly nourished children of the locked-out and striking workers were to be billeted with sympathetic families in England. On the grounds that their hosts were not guaranteed to be Catholic, the Church objected and Hibernian crowds gathered at the docks to prevent the children&#x27;s &quot;deportation&quot;. Connolly, who had been wary from the first, cancelled the scheme, but nonetheless sought to score a point against the clericalist opposition by telling his people to ask the archbishop and priests for food and clothing.

Connolly and Larkin had shown a willingness to negotiate on the basis of an inquiry into the dispute by the Board of Trade. While critical of the ITGWU&#x27;s employment of the &quot;sympathetic&quot; strike, it concluded that employers were insisting on an anti-union pledge that was &quot;contrary to individual liberty&quot;, and that &quot;no workman or body of workmen could reasonably be expected to accept”. The employers were unmoved.

After the ITGWU-controlled Dublin Socialist Party failed in the January 1914 municipal elections to register support for the strike, and the Trade Union Congress in England had declined Larkin and Connolly&#x27;s plea for additional support and funding, the workers began to drift back, submitting to their employers. Exhausted, and falling into bouts of depression, Larkin took a declining interest in the beleaguered union, and eventually in October accepted an invitation from &quot;Big Bill&quot; Haywood of the IWW to speak in the United States. He did not return to Ireland until 1923. His departure left Connolly, in charge not only of the ITGWU with its headquarters at Liberty Hall, but also of a workers&#x27; militia.

==Easter Rising==
=== Irish Citizen Army ===
First floated as an idea by George Bernard Shaw, the training of union men as a force to protect picket lines and rallies was taken up in Dublin by &quot;Citizens Committee&quot; chair, Jack White, himself the victim of a police baton charge. In accepting White&#x27;s services, Connolly made reference to the national question: &quot;why&quot;, he asked &quot;should we not train our men in Dublin as they are doing in Ulster&quot;. In the north, the Unionists, labour men among them, were forming the ranks of the Ulster Volunteers. The Irish Citizen Army (ICA) began drilling in November 1913, but then, after it had dwindled like the strike to almost nothing, in March 1914 the militia was reborn, its ranks supplemented by Constance Markievicz&#x27;s Fianna Éireann nationalist youth.

After the return to work, the command of the ICA divided on the militia&#x27;s future, and in particular on policy toward the Irish Volunteers, the much larger nationalist response to the arming of Ulster Unionism (and of which Markievicz was also a member). Secretary to the ICA Council, Seán O&#x27;Casey, described the formation of the Irish Volunteers as &quot;one of the most effective blows&quot; that the ICA had received. Men who might have joined the ICA were now drillingwith the blessing of the IRBunder a command that included employers who had locked out men trying to exercise &quot;the first principles of Trade Unionism&quot;. When it became apparent that Connolly was gravitating towards an IRB strategy of cooperation with the Volunteers, O&#x27;Casey and Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, the Vice President, resigned, leaving Connolly in undisputed command.

On 4 August 1914, Britain declared war on Germany. The Home Rule Bill received royal assent, but with a suspensory act delaying implementation for duration (and with the reservation that the question of Ulster&#x27;s inclusion had still to be resolved). Leader of the IPP, John Redmond, then split the Irish Volunteers by urging them (in the hope of securing Britain&#x27;s good faith) to rally to the British Army&#x27;s colours. The vast majority heeding his callsome 175,000 menreformed themselves as the National Volunteers. This left 13,500 to reorganise under the nominal command of Eoin MacNeill of Gaelic League but, in key staff positions, directed by undercover members of the IRB&#x27;s Military Council: Patrick Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh and Joseph Plunkett.

=== Urges &quot;revolutionary action&quot; ===
In October 1914, Connolly assumed the presidency of the Irish Neutrality League (chairing a committee that included Arthur Griffith, Constance Markievicz and Francis Sheehy-Skeffington), but not as a pacifist. He was urging active opposition to the war, and acknowledged that this amounted to &quot;more than a transport strike&quot;. Stopping the export of foodstuffs from Ireland, for example, might involve &quot;armed battling in the streets&quot;. In the &quot;Irish Worker&quot; he had already declared that if, in the course of Britain&#x27;s &quot;pirate war upon the German nation&quot;, the Kaiser landed an army in Ireland &quot;we should be perfectly justified in joining it&quot;. A further editorial in the ITGWU paper betrayed his exasperation with the &quot;jingoism&quot; of the British labour movement. It suggested that insurrection in Ireland and throughout the British dominions might be required “to teach the English working class they cannot hope to prosper permanently by arresting the industrial development of others”.

In December, the &quot;Irish Worker&quot; was suppressed and in May 1915 Connolly revived his old ISRP title, &quot;Workers&#x27; Republic&quot;. Accompanied by the martial-patriotic poetry of Maeve Cavanagh, Connolly&#x27;s editorials continued to urge Irish resistance, and on the express understanding that this could not &quot;be conducted on the lines of dodging the police, or any such high jinks of constitutional agitation&quot;. He cautioned that those who oppose conscription (the prospect that was drawing crowds to the meetings, the marches and parades of the Irish Citizen Army and of the Volunteers) &quot;take their lives in their hands&quot; (and, by implication, that they should organise accordingly). In December 1915, Connolly wrote: “We believe in constitutional action in normal times, we believe in revolutionary action in exceptional times. These are exceptional times&quot;.

In February 1916, Connolly proposed, that with &quot;thousands of Irish workers&quot; volunteering to fight for British Crown and Empire, only the &quot;red tide of war on Irish soil&quot; would enable the nation to &quot;recover its self-respect&quot;.

=== Relations with the IRB ===

Connolly was aware of, but not privy to, discussions within the IRB on prospects for a national rising. Patrick Pearse cautioned his colleagues on treating with Connolly: &quot;Connolly is most dishonest in his methods. He will never be satisfied until he goads us into action, and then he will think most of us too moderate and want to guillotine half of us&quot;.

By the New Year, believing the Irish Volunteers were dithering, Connolly was threatening to rush Dublin Castle, around which he had already deployed his ICA on nightly manoeuvres. Determined to safeguard their plans for an insurrection at Easter, Seán Ó Faoláin claims that the IRB had Connolly &quot;kidnapped&quot;.A unit of Volunteers had been mobilised to arrest Connolly had he refused to meet with the IRB Council, but Patrick Pearse, Tom Clarke and the other IRB leaders resolved matters by finally taking Connolly into their confidence.

Connolly was conscious that his new allies had, for the most part, been silent during the lock-out in 1913. Labour was not their cause, so that when he himself had proposed a programme for the Irish Volunteers in October 1914, he had confined it to political demands: &quot;repeal of all clauses of the Home Rule Act denying Ireland powers of self-government now enjoyed by South Africa, Australia or Canada&quot;.According to Desmond Greaves, a week before the Rising Connolly advised his 200 ICA volunteers that, as they were &quot;out for economic as well as political liberty&quot;, in the event of victory they should &quot;hold on to&quot; their rifles.

=== Easter week 1916 ===

On 14 April 1916, Connolly summoned Winifred Carney to Dublin where she prepared his mobilisation orders for the Irish Citizen Army (ICA). Ten days later, on Easter Monday, with Connolly commissioned by the IRB Military Council as Commandant of the Dublin Districts, they set out for the General Post Office (GPO) with an initial garrison party from Liberty Hall. Carney (armed with a typewriter and a Webley revolver) served as Connolly&#x27;s aide de camp with the rank of adjutant She was seconded in that role, for the first two days, by Connolly&#x27;s 15 year-old son Roddy.

From the steps of the GPO, Patrick Pearse (President and Commander-in-Chief) read the &quot;Proclamation of the Irish Republic&quot;. Connolly had contributed to the final draft, which declared &quot;the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland&quot; and, in a phrase that he had often been used, a &quot;resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and of all its parts&quot;. In a further symbolic gesture of labour&#x27;s stake in the rebellion, Connolly sent the Starry Plough flag, the symbol of Irish labour, to be hoisted by his men over the Imperial Hotel, owned by the man who had organised their defeat in 1913, William Murphy.

By some accounts the rebel strategy of occupying the GPO and other public buildings in the city centre, had been informed by Connolly&#x27;s belief that the British were unlikely to rely on artillery, that a regular bombardment of the city would have been possible only if, abandoning their businesses and property, the section of the population loyal to the government was outside insurgent lines. Connolly&#x27;s biographer, Samuel Levenson records an exchange between Volunteers after a British gunboat began shelling their positions from the Liffey: &quot;General Connolly told us the British would never use artillery against us&quot;. &quot;He did, did he? Wouldn&#x27;t it be great now if General Connolly was making the decisions for the British&quot;.

Leading men on the street and supervising the construction of barricades, he was twice wounded on the Thursday. Carney refused to leave his side, and was with him the following day, Friday 29 April, when, carried on a stretcher, he was among the last to evacuate from the GPO, its upper floors burning, to Moore Street. There, with Seán Mac Diarmada and Joseph Plunket, Connolly persuaded Pearse, over Tom Clarke&#x27;s objection, to ask the British for terms. Satisfied that &quot;the glorious stand which has been made by the soldiers of Irish freedom&quot; was &quot;sufficient to gain recognition of Ireland&#x27;s national claim at an international peace conference&quot;, and &quot;desirous of preventing further slaughter of the civilian population&quot;, Pearse recorded the &quot;majority&quot; decision. Elizabeth O&#x27;Farrell, sent under a white flag to the British commander, Brigadier-General Lowe, came back with a demand for unconditional surrender which, within the 30 minute time limit imposed, Pearse conceded.

As he was being returned to a stretcher to be carried toward the British lines, Connolly told those around him not to worry: &quot;Those of us that signed the proclamation will be shot. But the rest of you will be set free.&quot;

== Court martial and execution ==

Connolly was among 16 republican prisoners executed for their role in the Rising. Executions in Kilmainham Gaol began on 3 May 1916 with Connolly&#x27;s co-signatories to the Proclamation, Patrick Pearse, Tom Clarke and Thomas McDonagh, and ended with his death and that of Seán Mac Diarmada on 12 May. Roger Casement, who had run German guns for the Rising, was hanged at Pentonville Prison, in London, on August 3. Unable to stand because of his wounds (his foot had turned gangrenous), Connolly had been placed before a firing squad tied to a chair. His body was placed, without rite or coffin, with those of his comrades in a common grave at the Arbour Hill military cemetery.

In a statement to the court martial held in Dublin Castle on 9 May, he proposed offering no defence, save against &quot;charges of wanton cruelty to prisoners”, and he declared:We went out to break the connection between this country and the British Empire, and to establish an Irish Republic. We believed that the call we then issued to the people of Ireland, was a nobler call, in a holier cause, than any call issued to them during this war, having any connection with the war. We succeeded in proving that Irishmen are ready to die endeavouring to win for Ireland those national rights which the British Government has been asking them to die to win for Belgium. As long as that remains the case, the cause of Irish freedom is safe.The night before his execution, he was permitted a visit by his wife Lillie and their 8 year old daughter, Fiona (whose abiding memory of her father was to be his laughter). He is said to have returned to the Catholic Church in the few days before his execution. A Capuchin, Father Aloysius Travers administered absolution and last rites. Asked to pray for the soldiers about to shoot him, Connolly said: &quot;I will say a prayer for all men who do their duty according to their lights.&quot;

There was disquiet at Connolly&#x27;s execution. In Parliament the government was pressed as to whether there was &quot;precedent for the summary execution of a military prisoner dying of his wounds&quot;. But at the time, the greater outrage was over the executions of William Pearse, put to death, it was thought, simply because he was the brother of the rebel leader, and Major John MacBride who played no part in planning the Rising but had fought against Britain in the Boer War.

Despite the initial public hostility toward the rebels and the destruction they had brought upon Dublin, after the first executions of Pearse, Clarke and MacDonagh, John Redmond warned the Prime Minister, Herbert Asquith, that any further executions would make his position, and that of any other constitutional party or leader in Ireland, &quot;impossible”.

==Political thought==

=== Socialism and nationalism===
The nature of Connolly&#x27;s socialism, and its role in his decision to join the IRB in the Easter Rising, was disputed by his Socialist contemporaries in both Europe and the United States. It is the central point of contention in the extensive literature that has developed since on his political life and thought.

Writing in 1934, Seán Ó Faoláin described Connolly&#x27;s political ideas as:an amalgamation of everything he had read that could, according to his viewpoint, be applied to Irish ills, a synthesis of Marx, Davitt, Lalor, Robert Owen, Tone, Mitchel and the rest, all welded together in his Socialist-Separatist ideal. He favoured Industrial unionism as the method of approach to what he called variously, the Workers&#x27; Republic, the Irish Socialist Republic, the Co-operative State, the Democratic Co-operative Commonwealth... [The unions] would be he means of popular representation in the Workers&#x27; Parliament; and they would be the power controlling the national wealth ... In a word he believed in vocational representation combined with &quot;all power to the Unions&quot;.While he never had the opportunity to apply and test his principles even on a small scale, Connolly &quot;at least [had] a point of view&quot; and a &quot;definite idea of what he meant by such terms as &#x27;a Republic&#x27;, &#x27;Freedom&#x27;, &#x27;Emancipation&#x27; [and] &#x27;Autonomy&#x27;&quot;. But Ó Faoláin argues that in the end Connolly&#x27;s social-emancipatory ideas proved to be secondary to his nationalism. The night before he was shot, Connolly said to his daughter Nora: &quot;The Socialists will not understand why I am here; they forget I am an Irishman&quot;. For Ó Faoláin this was an admission that &quot;he had, in point of fact, gone over to nationalism and away from socialism&quot;.

Some of Connolly&#x27;s contemporaries suggested that there was no inconsistency: Connolly&#x27;s socialism was itself merely a form of militant nationalism. Invoking Connolly at the inaugural meeting of Fianna Fáil in 1926, in support of his protectionist programme for national development, Éamon de Valera implied that Connolly&#x27;s principal purpose in calling for a worker&#x27;s republic was to complete the break with England. Constance Markievicz was also to interpret Connolly&#x27;s socialism in purely national, purely Irish, terms. Seizing on Connolly&#x27;s portrait of Gaelic society in &quot;The Reconquest of Ireland&quot;, she summarised his doctrine as the &quot;application of the social principle which underlay the Brehon laws of our ancestors&quot;.

At the same time, there were writers who, convinced that &quot;Connolly&#x27;s Irish Catholicism had not been irrevocably blemished by atheistic Marxism&quot;, found parallels between his commitment to industrial unionism and the corporatist doctrines Pope Leo XIII enunciated in his encyclical &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; (1891).

Beginning in 1961, with the publication a major new biography by Desmond Greaves, there was a concerted effort to rehabilitate Connolly as a revolutionary socialist. Greaves proposed that with the onset of the European war, Connolly&#x27;s thought had run &quot;parallel with Lenin&#x27;s&quot;; and reached the same conclusion: &quot;Whoever wishes a durable and democratic peace must be for civil war against the governments and the bourgeoisie&quot; (Lenin, &quot;Turn Imperialist War into Civil War&quot;, 1915). Greaves is the source for Connolly&#x27;s oft-quoted &quot;hold on to your rifles&quot; admonition to his ICA volunteers, which might suggest that Connolly did see the Easter Rising as the prelude to this larger revolutionary struggle.

While &quot;The Life and Times of James Connolly&quot; remains a standard reference, there have been objections to pressing Connolly into a Leninist mold. Connolly&#x27;s revolutionary outlook remained that of the syndicalism he had acquired in America, although in 1916 he entertained no suggestion of Irish workers being organised to seize control of their workplaces. He was concerned, rather, with their quiescence in the war against Germany. This was viewed by Connolly, not as a contest of rival imperialisms with no democratic principle at stake, but as a war in which, as the primary aggressor, Britain had presented an Ireland willing to strike for its freedom with a legitimate continental ally. 

Connolly&#x27;s understanding of the agrarian nature of nationalist Ireland, and of Ulster unionism, which deprived it of Belfast and its industrial hinterland, has also been subject to comment and revision.

=== Revolutionary syndicalism ===

Greaves concedes that there are formulations in Connolly&#x27;s thinking that &quot;smack of syndicalism&quot;—that is, of faith in the ability of the working class to secure a socialist future on the strength, not of a revolutionary party, but of their own labour-union democracy. Lenin had praise for De Leon&#x27;s contribution to socialist thought, but Connolly broke with De Leon precisely on the issue of industrial unionism.

In 1908, Connolly accused De Leon of knocking &quot;the feet from under&quot; his party&#x27;s alliance with the IWW by arguing that, as prices rise with wages, the gains the union secures for labour are only nominal. The implication was that the One Big Union was merely a &quot;ward-heeling club&quot; for the SLP, a place from which militants could be recruited to the real task: building a party to take state power.

Since it suggests that within capitalism there is no prospect of the working class improving its position, Connolly allowed that the &quot;theory that a rise in prices always destroys the value of a rise in wages&quot; sounds &quot;revolutionary&quot;. But it was not Marxist and not true. The value of labour is not fixed, but is the subject of a continuous struggle. It is in this struggle that workers acquire the organisational strength and the confidence to bring capital to heel, and to extend their own control of production and distribution.

In a last statement of his credo, &quot;The Re-conquest of Ireland&quot; (1915), Connolly affirmed that the outcome of this struggle, the worker&#x27;s republic, is not an overweening state. Rather it is an industrial commonwealth in which &quot;the workshops, factories, docks, railways, shipyards, &amp;c., shall be owned by the nation, but administered by the Industrial Unions of the respective industries&quot;. 

An early compiler of his ideas, notes that Connolly &quot;nowhere attempts to explain how the general interests of the State, as distinguished from specific interests of the Industrial Unions, are to be provided for&quot;. It was only certain that Connolly was not a &quot;state socialist&quot;. Connolly was, himself, confident that his: :... conception of Socialism destroys at one blow all the fears of a bureaucratic state, ruling and ordering the lives of every individual from above, and thus gives assurance that the social order of the future will be an extension of the freedom of the individual, and not a suppression of it.In his last six years, Connolly had devoted his energies almost entirely to the ITGWU and to the Irish Citizen Army. A &quot;pairing of union and militia&quot; is central to syndicalist scenarios for social revolution. But Connolly knew that &quot;his union, the ITGWU . . ., weakened by the industrial struggles of 1913-14, was not up to the effort of seizing docks, railways, shipping etc.&quot;. He made no attempt, prior to or during the Rising, to appeal to workers to join the insurgency. In an address published just one week before the Rising on the forthcoming congress of the Irish TUC, there is no intimation of the impending action. In reference to the war, Connolly&#x27;s only advice was that the congress should proceed in August as planned.

=== A two-stage struggle ===

At the beginning of 1916, Connolly drew &quot;a crucial distinction between the struggle for socialism and for national liberation&quot;. In the &quot;Irish Worker&quot; (23 January) he wrote:Our programme in time of peace was to gather in the hands in Irish trade unions the control of all the forces of production and distribution in Ireland . . . [but] in times of war we should act as in war. . . . While the war lasts and Ireland still is a subject nation we shall continue to urge her to fight for her freedom. . . . The time for Ireland&#x27;s battle is NOW.His calculation was not based alone on the strategic opportunity presented by Britain&#x27;s engagement with Germany. Connolly had described John Redmond&#x27;s pact with the government as &quot;the most gigantic, deep-laid and loathsome attempt in history to betray the soul of a people&quot;. At the beginning of February 1916, he acknowledged that the pact was delivering the working class, and not least by means of simple bribery:We have said that the Working Class was the only class to whom the word &quot;Empire&quot; and the things for which it was the symbol did not appeal . . . [and] therefore, from the intelligent working class could alone come the revolutionary impulse. . . . But if the Militant Labour Leaders of Ireland have not apostatised the same cannot be said of the working class as a whole . . . . For the sake of a few paltry shillings per week thousands of Irish workers have sold their country in the hour of their country&#x27;s greatest need and hope. For the sake of a few paltry shillings Separation Allowance thousands of Irish women have made life miserable for their husbands with entreaties to join the British Army.In &quot;Erin&#x27;s Hope&quot; (1897), Connolly had claimed that socialists would succeed where the Fenians, and the Young Irelanders before them, had failed, in preparing &quot;the public mind for revolution&quot;. For this, they would rely on the militant organisation of labour, neither seeking nor accepting the cooperation of men whose ideals were not their own, and with whom they might therefore &quot;be compelled to fight at some future critical stage of the journey to freedom&quot;. To this category, Connolly assigned &quot;every section of the propertied class&quot;. John Newsinger argues that such talk was now put aside. Connolly embraced &quot;the conception of revolution that prevailed in the inner circles of the IRB: that a small minority must be prepared to sacrifice itself in order to save the soul of the nation&quot;. It was, he suggests, the &quot;politics of despair&quot;. Austen Morgan similarly concludes Connolly &quot;collapsed politically as a socialist. Unable to sustain his faith in proletarian action, that he died &quot;unapologetic Fenian&quot;.

Noting that, two weeks before the Rising, Connolly, was still affirming that &quot;the cause of labour is the cause of Ireland, the cause of Ireland is the cause of labour&quot; and that the two &quot;cannot be dissevered&quot;, Greaves continued to insist that little had changed in Connolly&#x27;s fundamental thinking. R.M. Fox considers the view that Connolly &quot;allowed himself to be dragged away from his labour convictions&quot; to be &quot;foolish&quot; and &quot;superficial&quot;, arguing that under the unique conditions of the Great War he was compelled to &quot;force the independence issue to the point of armed struggle&quot;. But, for Richard English, while this may have been so, it is Connolly&#x27;s failure &quot;to persuade any but a tiny number of the Irish people&quot; of his argument that accounts for his &quot;gesture&quot; in 1916. Acceding to the IRB&#x27;s &quot;inclusive, cross-class approach to the nation&quot;, his hope was only of an &quot;eventual&quot; vindication of his belief that, once national rebellion had secured &quot;the national powers needed by our class&quot;, social revolution would follow.

=== Farm-labour cooperation ===
Apart from what he may have witnessed as a soldier, Connolly&#x27;s only sustained experience of rural Ireland was three weeks spent in County Kerry in 1898 reporting on famine conditions for De Leon&#x27;s &quot;Weekly People&quot;. Connolly concluded that &quot;the root cause&quot; of the distress was not landlordism per se or an &quot;alien government&quot;, but rather a &quot;system of small farming and small industry&quot; in which the Irish peasant &quot;reaps none of the benefits of the progress . . . [and] organisation of industry&quot;.

This was the seemingly orthodox Marxist view to which Connolly was already committed. In &quot;Erin&#x27;s Hope (&quot;1897) he had proposed that &quot;the day of the small farmers, as of small capitalists, is gone&quot; and that salvation lay in &quot;the nationalisation of land in the hands of the Irish state&quot;. From Kerry, he wrote more loosely of the Socialist Republic organising greater &quot;co-operative effort&quot;, but in either case it was an analysis that suggested that &quot;the most important struggles for the Irish peasantry would occur not in the countryside, but between labour and capital in the cities&quot;. There is no discussion of the role the rural population itself might play in the creation of the new republic.

By the time of his return from America in 1910, the combined effects of continued emigration and land reform was effecting a profound social transformation. In &quot;Labour in Irish History&quot; (1910), Connolly recalls the words of Wolfe Tone: “Our freedom must be had at all hazards. If the men of property will not help us they must fall; we will free ourselves by the aid of that large and respectable class of the community – the men of no property.” But after the Wyndham Act (1903), the peasant &quot;was, or else was well on the way to becoming, a freehold farmer--a man of property&quot;. Unmoved by what Connolly supposed was their &quot;memory of the common ownership and common control of land by their ancestors&quot;, it was a status they would defend it with tenacity.

A &quot;large self-confident class of farmer owners&quot; was shifting the balance of class forces in Catholic Ireland against Connolly&#x27;s identification of the national cause with labour. Their emancipation from taxation imposed in the working-class interest would be &quot;the main economic achievement of independence&quot;. This was not a prospect admitted by Connolly. He suggested rather a farm-labour alliance. A feature of the transition from tenancy to ownership in countryside was the establishment of creameries and other agricultural co-operatives. Participation was often reluctant, and generally failed to support broader networks, but the image was created abroad of Irish farmers as &quot;co-operative trailblazers&quot;. In &quot;The Reconquest of Ireland&quot; (1915), Connolly celebrates the development and, recalling the co-operative stores his union had opened in Dublin after the Lock-out, &quot;confidently&quot; predicts that, &quot;in the very near future&quot;, the labour movement will create its own &quot;crop of co-operative enterprises&quot;. The stage would then be set for town and country to heal their &quot;latent antagonism&quot; and converge on a common ideal — the &quot;Co-operative Commonwealth&quot;.

=== Ulster unionism ===
In 1898 Connolly had cited &quot;the Protestant workmen of Belfast, so often out on strike against their Protestant employers, and the role their Protestant ancestors had played a 100 years previously in the rebellion against the British Crown, as a demonstration of what &quot;precious little bearing&quot; the question of religious faith has in the struggle for freedom. Later, when in Belfast for the Socialist Party and the ITGWU, he identified &quot;religious bigotry&quot; as the one obstacle remaining to the acceptance of Irish self-government and thus to the achievement of socialist unity on a separate all-Ireland basis. But he understood this as a political force arising, not from confessional differences, but from the deliberate recall and accentuation of ancient native-planter divisions.

As the new Home Rule bill safely progressed through Westminster, Connolly appeared to concede the objection of William Walker, the Protestant leader of the Independent Labour Party in Belfast, who argued for British Labour and British social legislation. He suggested that having &quot;voted against the Right to Work Bill, the Minimum Wage for Miners, and the Minimum Wage for Railwaymen, [and] intrigued against the application to Ireland of the Feeding of Necessitous School Children and the Medical Benefits of the Insurance Act, in a parliament of their own Home Rulers would likely set a bad example to &quot;reactionists everywhere&quot;. He also allowed religious bigotry was not alone the mark of Empire loyalists: Connolly had applauded the even-handedness of the Grand-Master of the Independent Orange Order, Lindsay Crawford, in castigating sectarian influences — both &quot;Orange and Green&quot;. But in an &quot;ill-tempered and discursive&quot; exchange with Walker, Connolly admitted no case for labour sticking with the Imperial Parliament.

Labour unionism was still unionism and, no matter how reactionary nationalism might appear under its current leadership, unionism was more reactionary still. It represented an Orange-inflected Protestantism that had become &quot;synonymous&quot; with what Catholicism represented in much of the rest of Europe; that is, with &quot;Toryism, lickspittle loyalty, servile worship of aristocracy and hatred of all that savours of genuine political independence on the part of the lower classes&quot;. Thus it was that he had encountered in Ireland&#x27;s industrial capital, not what socialist theory would have predicted, its most politically-advanced working class, but rather those he despairingly characterised as &quot;least rebellious slaves in the industrial world&quot;.

Walker maintained that it was as an internationalist that he supported the union with Great Britain. Connolly replied that the only true socialist internationalism lay in a &quot;free federation of free peoples&quot;. That the Protestant working people of Ulster could regard themselves as a free people within the United Kingdom, he dismissed, effectively, as &quot;false consciousness&quot;. But as it served only the interest of their landlords and employers, it could not be long sustained.Already, in 1913, in series strikes in Belfast and Larne, Connolly saw evidence of Protestant workers returning to the class struggle. He confidently predicted that suspicion of their Catholic fellow workers would &quot;melt and dissolve&quot;, and that their children would come to laugh at the Ulster Covenant.

In April 1912, four of the five Belfast branches of the ILP attended a unity conference called by the SPI in Dublin and agreed to form an Independent Labour Party of Ireland. But sensitive to the unpopularity of Home Rule they did not carry their commitment over, when in May, Connolly secured a resolution at the Irish Trades Union Congress in favour of an Irish Labour Party without ties to the ILP or other British groups. Instead (joined in time by Winifred Carney) they adhered to what in Belfast became, after partition, the Northern Ireland Labour Party.

=== Socialism and religion ===
In 1907, Connolly confessed that while he &quot;usually posed as a Catholic&quot;, he had not done his &quot;duty&quot; for fifteen years, and had &quot;not the slightest tincture of faith left&quot;. Yet he could not accept De Leon&#x27;s insistence that a socialist party be as &quot;intolerant as science&quot; of deviations from strict materialism. Connolly opposed clericalism. He argued that Irish Catholics could in all conscience reject their bishops&#x27; dealings with the British authorities, and proposed that Irish schools be free of church control. But claiming &quot;conformity with the practice of the chief Socialist parties of the World&quot;, he declared religion a private matter outside the scope of socialist action.Socialism, is a bread and butter question. It is a question of the stomach; it is going to be settled in the factories, mines and ballot boxes of this country and is not going to be settled at the altar or in the church.In 1910, he published &quot;Labour, Nationality and Religion&quot; in which he defended socialists against the clerical charge that they are &quot;beasts of immorality&quot;. He noted, for example, that the &quot;enormous increase of divorces [in the United States] was almost entirely among the classes least affected by Socialist teaching&quot;. But, at the same time, he argued that there was an egalitarian and humanitarian impulse in Christianity that provided a moral bridge to socialism, and could positively contribute to its advance.

In either case, Connolly believed it was an unnecessary and strategic mistake for socialists to risk popular support by deliberately outraging religious opinion. He had refused to join De Leon in entertaining August Bebel&#x27;s ideas on polyamorous marriage. Doing so, he argued, was simply putting &quot;a weapon&quot; into the hands of their enemies &quot;without obtaining any corresponding advantage&quot;.

=== Emancipation of women ===

In a campaign to raise funds for the Dublin strikers in 1913, Connolly shared a platform at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall with Sylvia Pankhurst. He took the occasion to declare that he stood for &quot;opposition to the domination of nation over nation, of class over class, or of sex over sex&quot;. He had supported the Suffragette movement, and worked alongside women in the labour movement. His Irish Citizen Army had the distinction of giving women officer rank and duty Francis Sheehy-Skeffington was convinced that, of &quot;all the Irish labour men&quot;, Connolly was &quot;the soundest and most thorough-going feminist&quot;.

In &quot;The Reconquest of Ireland&quot; (1915), Connolly traced oppression of women, like the oppression of the worker, to “a social and political order based upon the private ownership of property”. If the &quot;worker is the slave of capitalist society, the female worker is the slave of that slave&quot;. He would have little use for any form of Irish state that did not not &quot;embody the emancipation of womanhood?&quot;. However, socialism would solve only &quot;the economic side of the Woman Question&quot;: &quot;the question of marriage, of divorce, of paternity, of the equality of woman with man are physical and sexual questions, or questions of temperamental affiliation as in marriage,&quot; would &quot;still be hotly contested&quot;. There was still a private sphere in which women themselves would complete the struggle for their own emancipation. &quot;None&quot;, he remarked, is &quot;so fit to break the chains as they who wear them, none so well equipped to decide what a fetter is”.

=== Rejection of antisemitism ===
During his 1902 election campaign in the Wood Quay ward in Dublin, in which many streets were occupied by Jewish immigrants from Russia, Connolly&#x27;s campaign became the first in Irish history to distribute leaflets in Yiddish. The leaflet condemned antisemitism as a tool of the capitalist class.

Connolly sharply criticised the overtly anti-semitic tone of the British Social Democratic Federation&#x27;s publications during the Boer War, arguing that they had attempted to &quot;divert the wrath of the advanced workers from the capitalists to the Jews&quot;. His own editorship, however, did not exclude the possibility of anti-Jewish tropes. In the &quot;Workers Republic&quot; readers were asked to place themselves in the position of the Boers: &quot;Supposing your country was invaded by a mob of Jews and foreign exploiters ... What would you do?&quot;.During the Cork lock-out of 1909, Connolly&#x27;s &quot;Harp&quot; (the journal of the Irish Socialist Federation) featured an article denouncing &quot;patriotic Irish capitalists&quot; for importing &quot;wholesale scab Jews to break the strike of Irish workers&quot;.

In 1898, &quot;Workers Republic&quot; published an article &quot;The Ideal Government of the Jew&quot;, advocating &quot;the establishment of an Isrealitish [sic] nation in Palestine&quot;. But two years later, Connolly himself was to write positively about the &quot;remarkable&quot; development in the Russian Empire of the Jewish Labour Bund. Part of Russian Social Democracy, the Bund was anti-Zionist.

==Family==
James Connolly and his wife Lillie had seven children. The eldest, Mona, died on the eve of the family&#x27;s departure to join Connolly in America in 1904 at the age of 13, the result of an accident with scalding laundry water.

In Belfast, Nora and Ina (1896–1980) were active, with Winifred Carney, in Cumann na mBan and carried reports from the north to Pearse and their father the week before the rising in Dublin. Later, Nora was involved with her younger brother Roddy in efforts to promote a republican-socialist movement, but after the splintering of the Republican Congress in 1934 they went their separate ways. Roddy ended his political life as chairman of the Irish Labour Party and, the year before her death, Nora made an appearance at the Ardfheis of (Provisional) Sinn Féin.

In Belfast, Aideen (1895–1966) was also in Cumann na mBan. She married a Hugh Ward in Naas and had five children. Moira (1899–1958) became a doctor and married Richard Beech (an English syndicalist who, like Roddy, in 1920 attended the World Congress of the Comintern). Connolly&#x27;s youngest daughter, Fiona Connolly Edwards (1907–1976) also married in England, was active in the trade-union, and anti-partition, movements and assisted Desmond Greaves in his biographies both of her father and of the executed anti-Treaty republican, Liam Mellowes.

Brian Samuel Connolly Heron (Brian o h-Eachtuigheirn), the son of Ina Connolly and Archie Heron, Connolly&#x27;s grandson, was an organiser for the United Farm Workers in California. He was also a founding member in the United States of the National Association for Irish Justice which, in 1969, gained recognition as the U.S. support group for the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. Connolly&#x27;s great grandson, James Connolly Heron, has edited a compilation of his papers, and is active in the campaign to preserve the historical integrity of Moore Street, where Connolly and Pearse took their final stand in 1916.

In their last interview, Connolly urged his wife to return with the younger children to the United States, but she failed to secure the necessary passport. This was despite the assurance of General Sir John Maxwell that she was &quot;a decent humble woman who would be incapable of platform oratory in America&quot;.

Remaining in Dublin, in August 1916 Lillie Connolly was received into the Catholic Church, Fiona her sole witness. She did not make public appearances but when she died in 1938 she was accorded a state funeral.

== Memorials ==
=== Ireland ===
In 1966, to mark 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising, Connolly Station, one of the two main railway stations in Dublin, and Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, were named in his honour.

In 1996, a bronze statue of Connolly, backed by the symbol of the Starry Plough, was erected outside the Liberty Hall offices of the SIPTU trade union, in Dublin.

In 2019, Irish President Michael D. Higgins opened the Áras Uí Chonghaile | James Connolly Visitor Centre on the Falls Road in Belfast, close to where the labour leader had lived in the city. Developed with funding from Belfast City Council and from North American labour unions, the centre offers an interactive exhibit dedicated to Connolly&#x27;s life and work. Before it stands a life-size bronze of Connolly, originally unveiled in front of the Falls Community Council offices in 2016 by the Northern Ireland Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure minister Carál Ní Chuilín, and by his great-grandson, James Connolly Heron. 

In July 2023, a plaque was unveiled by the Dublin City Council at Connolly&#x27;s former residence on South Lotts Road in Ringsend.

=== Scotland ===
In the Cowgate area of Edinburgh where Connolly grew up there is a likeness of Connolly and a gold-coloured plaque dedicated to him under the George IV bridge.

=== United States ===
In 1986, a bust of Connolly was erected in Riverfront Park in Troy, New York, where he had lived on first emigrating to the United States in 1904.

In 2008, a full-figure bronze of Connolly was installed in Union Park, Chicago near the offices of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers.

<text>Daft Punk were a French electronic music duo formed in 1993 in Paris by Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo. They achieved early popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house movement, combining elements of house music with funk, disco, techno, rock and synth-pop. They are regarded as one of the most influential acts in dance music.

Daft Punk formed after Bangalter and de Homem-Christo&#x27;s indie rock band, Darlin&#x27;, disbanded. Their debut album, &quot;Homework&quot;, was released by Virgin Records in 1997 to positive reviews, backed by the singles &quot;Around the World&quot; and &quot;Da Funk&quot;.

From 1999, Daft Punk assumed robot personas for public appearances, with helmets, outfits and gloves to disguise their identities. They made few media appearances. They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter, the head of Ed Banger Records. Daft Punk&#x27;s second album, &quot;Discovery&quot; (2001), earned acclaim and further success, with the hit singles &quot;One More Time&quot;, &quot;Digital Love&quot; and &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot;. It became the basis for an animated film, &quot;Interstella 5555,&quot; supervised by the Japanese artist Leiji Matsumoto.

Daft Punk&#x27;s third album, &quot;Human After All&quot; (2005), received mixed reviews, though the singles &quot;Robot Rock&quot; and &quot;Technologic&quot; were successful in the UK. Daft Punk directed an avant-garde science-fiction film, &quot;Electroma&quot;, released in 2006. They toured throughout 2006 and 2007 and released the live album &quot;Alive 2007&quot;, which won a Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album; the tour is credited for broadening the appeal of dance music in North America. Daft Punk composed for the 2010 film &quot;&quot;.

In 2013, Daft Punk left Virgin for Columbia Records and released their fourth and final album, &quot;Random Access Memories&quot;, to acclaim. The lead single, &quot;Get Lucky&quot;, reached the top 10 in the charts of 27 countries. &quot;Random Access Memories&quot; won five Grammy Awards in 2014, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year for &quot;Get Lucky&quot;. In 2016, Daft Punk gained their only number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with &quot;Starboy&quot;, a collaboration with the Weeknd. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked them the 12th-greatest musical duo of all time in 2015, and included &quot;Discovery&quot; and &quot;Random Access Memories&quot; on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Daft Punk announced their split in 2021.

==History==
===1987–1992: Early career and Darlin&#x27;===

Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter met in 1987 while attending the Lycée Carnot secondary school in Paris. The two became friends and recorded demos with others from the school. In 1992, they formed a band, Darlin&#x27;, with Bangalter on bass, Homem-Christo on guitar, and Laurent Brancowitz on guitar and drums. The trio named themselves after the Beach Boys song &quot;Darlin&quot;, which they covered along with an original composition. Both tracks were released on a multi-artist EP under Duophonic Records, a label owned by the London-based band Stereolab, who invited Darlin&#x27; to open for shows in the United Kingdom.

Darlin&#x27; disbanded after around six months, having played two gigs and produced four songs. Bangalter described the project as &quot;pretty average&quot;. Brancowitz formed another band, Phoenix. Bangalter and Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk, using electronic instruments purchased with money Bangalter received for his 18th birthday. Their name was taken from a negative review of Darlin&#x27; in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; by Dave Jennings, who dubbed their music &quot;a daft punky thrash&quot;. The band found the review amusing. Homem-Christo said, &quot;We struggled so long to find [the name] Darlin&#x27;, and [this name] happened so quickly.&quot;

===1993–1996: First performances and singles===

In September 1993, Daft Punk attended a rave at EuroDisney organised by the DJ Nicky Holloway, where they met Stuart Macmillan of Slam, the co-founder of the Scottish label Soma Quality Recordings. They gave him a demo tape, which formed the basis for Daft Punk&#x27;s debut single, &quot;The New Wave&quot;, a limited release in 1994. The single also contained the final mix of &quot;The New Wave&quot; called &quot;Alive&quot;, which appeared on Daft Punk&#x27;s first album.

Daft Punk returned to the studio in May 1995 to record &quot;Da Funk&quot;. After it became their first commercially successful single, they hired a manager, Pedro Winter, who regularly promoted them and other artists at his Hype nightclubs. They signed with Virgin Records in September 1996 and made a deal to license tracks through their production company, Daft Trax. Bangalter said that while they received numerous offers from record labels, they wanted to wait and ensure that they did not lose creative control. He considered the deal with Virgin more akin to a partnership.

In the mid-to-late nineties, Daft Punk performed live at various events, without the costumes they later became known for. In 1996, they made their first performance in the United States, at an Even Furthur event in Wisconsin. In addition to live original performances, they performed in clubs using vinyl records from their collection. They were known for incorporating numerous styles of music into their DJ sets.

=== 1997–1999: &quot;Homework&quot; ===
Daft Punk released their debut album, &quot;Homework&quot;, in 1997. That February, the UK dance magazine &quot;Muzik&quot; published a Daft Punk cover feature and described &quot;Homework&quot; as &quot;one of the most hyped debut albums in a long long time&quot;. According to &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, the album revived house music and departed from the Eurodance formula. The critic Alex Rayner wrote that it combined established club styles and the &quot;burgeoning eclecticism&quot; of big beat. In 1997, Daft Punk embarked on an international concert tour, Daftendirektour, using their home equipment for the live stage. On 25 May, they headlined the Tribal Gathering festival at Luton Hoo, England, with Orbital and Kraftwerk.

The most successful single from &quot;Homework&quot; was &quot;Around the World&quot;. &quot;Da Funk&quot; was also included on &quot;The Saint&quot; film soundtrack. Daft Punk produced a series of music videos for &quot;Homework&quot; directed by Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, Roman Coppola and Seb Janiak. The videos were collected in 1999 as &quot;D.A.F.T.: A Story About Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes&quot;.

Bangalter and Homem-Christo created their own record labels, Roulé and Crydamoure, after the release of &quot;Homework&quot;, and released solo projects by themselves and their friends. Homem-Christo released music as a member of Le Knight Club with Eric Chedeville, and Bangalter released music as a member of Together with DJ Falcon and founded the group Stardust with Alan Braxe and Benjamin Diamond. In 1998, Stardust released their only song, the chart hit &quot;Music Sounds Better With You&quot;.

===1999–2003: &quot;Discovery&quot;===
Daft Punk&#x27;s second album, &quot;Discovery&quot;, was released in 2001. They said it was an attempt to reconnect with the playful, open-minded attitude associated with the discovery phase of childhood. The album reached No. 2 in the UK, and its lead single, &quot;One More Time&quot;, was a hit. The singles &quot;Digital Love&quot; and &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot; were also successful in the UK and on the US Dance Chart, and &quot;Face to Face&quot; hit number one on the US club play charts.

&quot;Discovery&quot; created a new generation of Daft Punk fans. It also saw Daft Punk debut their distinctive robot costumes; they had previously worn Halloween masks or bags for promotional appearances. &quot;Discovery&quot; was later named one of the best albums of the decade by publications including &quot;Pitchfork&quot; and &quot;Resident Advisor&quot;. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included it at number 236 in its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2021, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; cited &quot;Discovery&quot; as the centrepiece of Daft Punk&#x27;s career, &quot;an album that transcended the robots&#x27; club roots and rippled through the decades that followed&quot;.

Daft Punk partnered with the Japanese manga artist Leiji Matsumoto to create &quot;Interstella 5555&quot;, a feature-length animation set to &quot;Discovery&quot;. The first four episodes were shown on Toonami in 2001, and the finished film was released on DVD in 2003. That December, Daft Punk released &quot;Daft Club&quot;, a compilation of &quot;Discovery&quot; remixes. In 2001, Daft Punk released a 45-minute excerpt from a Daftendirektour performance as &quot;Alive 1997&quot;.

===2004–2007: &quot;Human After All&quot; and &quot;Alive 2007&quot;===

In March 2005, Daft Punk released their third album, &quot;Human After All&quot;, the result of six weeks of writing and recording. Reviews were mixed, with criticism for its repetitiveness and darker mood. &quot;Robot Rock&quot;, &quot;Technologic&quot;, &quot;Human After All&quot; and &quot;The Prime Time of Your Life&quot; were released as singles. A Daft Punk anthology CD/DVD, &quot;Musique Vol. 1 1993–2005&quot;, was released on 4 April 2006. Daft Punk also released a remix album, &quot;Human After All: Remixes&quot;.

On 21 May 2006, Daft Punk premiered a film, &quot;Daft Punk&#x27;s Electroma&quot;, at the Cannes Film Festival sidebar Director&#x27;s Fortnight. The film does not include Daft Punk&#x27;s music. Midnight screenings were held in Paris theaters from March 2007.

For 48 dates across 2006 and 2007, Daft Punk performed the Alive 2006/2007 world tour, performing a &quot;megamix&quot; of their music from a large LED-fronted pyramid. The tour was acclaimed and is credited for bringing dance music to a wider audience, especially in North America. The &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist Gabriel Szatan likened it to how the Beatles&#x27; 1964 performance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; had brought British rock and roll to the American mainstream.

Daft Punk&#x27;s performance in Paris was released as their second live album, &quot;Alive 2007&quot;, on 19 November 2007. The live version of &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot; was released as a single, with a video by Olivier Gondry comprising audience footage of their performance in Brooklyn. In 2009, Daft Punk won Grammy Awards for &quot;Alive 2007&quot; and its single &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot;.

===2008–2011: &quot;Tron: Legacy&quot;===

In 2007, Kanye West sampled &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot; in his single &quot;Stronger&quot;. Daft Punk made a surprise appearance at the 50th Grammy Awards on 10 February 2008, and performed a reworked version of &quot;Stronger&quot; with West at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. It was the first televised Daft Punk live performance.

In 2008, Daft Punk returned to Paris to work on new material. Winter also stepped down as their manager to focus attention on his Ed Banger Records label and his work as Busy P. He said later that Daft Punk were working with an unspecified management company in Los Angeles. Daft Punk held their Daft Arts production office at the Jim Henson Studios complex in Hollywood. Daft Punk provided new mixes for the 2009 video game &quot;DJ Hero,&quot; and appeared as playable characters.

At the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con, it was announced that Daft Punk had composed 24 tracks for the film &quot;&quot;. Daft Punk&#x27;s score was arranged and orchestrated by Joseph Trapanese. The band collaborated with him for two years on the score, from pre-production to completion. The score features an 85-piece orchestra, recorded at AIR Lyndhurst Studios in London. Joseph Kosinski, director of the film, referred to the score as a mixture of orchestral and electronic elements. Daft Punk also make a cameo as disc jockey programs wearing their trademark robot helmets within the film&#x27;s virtual world. The was released on 6 December 2010. A music video for &quot;Derezzed&quot; premiered on the MTV Networks on the same day the album was released. The video, which features Olivia Wilde as the character Quorra in specially shot footage, along with images of Daft Punk in Flynn&#x27;s Arcade, was later made available for purchase from the iTunes Store and included in the DVD and Blu-ray releases of the film. Walt Disney Records released a remix album, &quot;&quot;, on 5 April 2011.

In 2010, Daft Punk were admitted into the , an order of merit of France. Bangalter and Homem-Christo were individually awarded the rank of &quot;Chevalier&quot; (knight). On October of that year, Daft Punk made a surprise guest appearance during the encore of Phoenix&#x27;s show at Madison Square Garden in New York City. They played a medley of &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot; and &quot;Around the World&quot; before the song segued into Phoenix&#x27;s song &quot;1901&quot;. They also included elements of their tracks &quot;Rock&#x27;n Roll&quot;, &quot;Human After All&quot;, and &quot;Together&quot;, one of Bangalter&#x27;s releases as a member of Together. They produced N.E.R.D.&#x27;s 2010 song &quot;Hypnotize U&quot;.

===2011–2015: &quot;Random Access Memories&quot;===
 In 2011, Soma Records released a previously unpublished Daft Punk track, &quot;Drive&quot;, recorded while they were signed to Soma in the 1990s. It was included in a 20th-anniversary compilation of the Soma label. In October 2012, Daft Punk provided a 15-minute mix of songs by blues musician Junior Kimbrough for Hedi Slimane&#x27;s Yves Saint Laurent fashion show. Daft Punk recorded their fourth studio album, &quot;Random Access Memories&quot;, with musicians including Julian Casablancas, Todd Edwards, DJ Falcon, Panda Bear, Chilly Gonzales, Paul Williams, Pharrell Williams, Chic frontman Nile Rodgers and Giorgio Moroder. Daft Punk left Virgin for Sony Music Entertainment through the Columbia Records label.

&quot;Random Access Memories&quot; was released on 17 May 2013. The lead single, &quot;Get Lucky&quot;, became Daft Punk&#x27;s first UK number-one single and the most-streamed new song in the history of Spotify. At the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, Daft Punk debuted a trailer for their single &quot;Lose Yourself to Dance&quot; and presented the award for &quot;Best Female Video&quot; alongside Rodgers and Pharrell. In December, they revealed a music video for the song &quot;Instant Crush&quot;, directed by Warren Fu and featuring Casablancas.

At the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, &quot;Random Access Memories&quot; won the Grammy for Best Dance/Electronica Album, Album of the Year and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical, while &quot;Get Lucky&quot; received the Grammy for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Record of the Year. Daft Punk performed at the ceremony with Stevie Wonder, Rodgers, Pharrell, and the &quot;Random Access Memories&quot; rhythm players Nathan East, Omar Hakim, Paul Jackson, Jr. and Chris Caswell. That night, Daft Punk hosted a large Grammys afterparty at the Park Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles, with many celebrities and no photography allowed.

Daft Punk co-produced Kanye West&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Yeezus&quot; (2013), creating the tracks &quot;On Sight&quot;, &quot;Black Skinhead&quot;, &quot;I Am a God&quot; and &quot;Send It Up&quot; with West. They provided additional vocals for Pharrell&#x27;s 2014 single &quot;Gust of Wind&quot;. On 10 March 2014, an unreleased Daft Punk song, &quot;Computerized&quot;, leaked online. It features Jay-Z and contains &quot;The Son of Flynn&quot; from the &quot;Tron: Legacy&quot; soundtrack; it was once intended to be a single promoting &quot;Tron: Legacy&quot;. In April 2015, Daft Punk appeared in a short tribute to Rodgers as part of a documentary on his life, &quot;Nile Rodgers: From Disco to Daft Punk&quot;. In June, a documentary, &quot;Daft Punk Unchained&quot;, was released.

===2016–2020: Final projects and appearances===
Daft Punk appeared on the 2016 singles &quot;Starboy&quot; and &quot;I Feel It Coming&quot; by Canadian R&amp;B singer the Weeknd; &quot;Starboy&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming Daft Punk&#x27;s only US number-one song, and &quot;I Feel It Coming&quot; reached number four. In 2017, Soma Records released a remix of &quot;Drive&quot; by Slam as part of a compilation featuring various artists. In February 2017, Daft Punk launched a pop-up shop in Hollywood, California, featuring memorabilia, artwork, and a display of their costumes. They also performed with the Weeknd at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards on 12 February 2017.

In the years following the &quot;Starboy&quot; collaborations, Bangalter and Homem-Christo worked solo as producers appearing on several projects. On 21 June 2017, the Australian band Parcels released the song &quot;Overnight&quot;, produced and co-written by Daft Punk. It was written after Daft Punk saw Parcels perform and invited the members to their studio. This became Daft Punk&#x27;s final production together. 

Between 9 April and 11 August 2019, an electronic exhibition based on Daft Punk&#x27;s song &quot;Technologic&quot; was displayed at the Philharmonie de Paris, featuring costumes, guitars and other elements. In early 2024, W. F. Quinn Smith, who played percussion on &quot;Random Access Memories&quot;, said he had participated in experimental recording sessions for a new Daft Punk album in early 2018, but that the project was in limbo.

=== 2021–present: Disbandment===
On 22 February 2021, Daft Punk released a video on their YouTube channel titled &quot;Epilogue&quot;. The video features a scene from their 2006 film &quot;Electroma&quot;, in which one robot explodes and the other walks away into the sunset; a title card created with Warren Fu reads &quot;1993–2021&quot; while an excerpt of Daft Punk&#x27;s song &quot;Touch&quot; plays. Later that day, Daft Punk&#x27;s longtime publicist, Kathryn Frazier, confirmed that they had split, but did not give a reason. The news led to a surge in Daft Punk sales, with digital album purchases rising by 2,650%. Their friend and collaborator Todd Edwards confirmed that Bangalter and Homem-Christo remained active separately. He later said they were &quot;going in different directions&quot;, and that Homem-Christo was more drawn to hip-hop and Bangalter was interested in film. As of 2023, Bangalter and Homem-Christo still shared a studio and equipment.

On 22 February 2022, one year after their disbandment, Daft Punk announced a 25th-anniversary edition of &quot;Homework&quot;. It included a remix album, &quot;Homework (Remixes)&quot;, which was also released separately. Daft Punk also broadcast a Twitch stream of their performance at the Mayan Theater in Los Angeles from their 1997 Daftendirektour. The video featured previously unreleased footage of the duo without costumes. Daft Punk released behind-the-scenes &quot;archives&quot; from the &quot;D.A.F.T.&quot; DVD and album reissues throughout 2022.

On 12 May 2023, Daft Punk released a 10th-anniversary edition of &quot;Random Access Memories&quot;, with 35 minutes of previously unreleased outtakes and demos. &quot;Infinity Repeating (2013 Demo)&quot;, featuring Casablancas and the Voidz, was released as a single. It was released alongside a music video and was called Daft Punk&#x27;s &quot;last song ever&quot; in press releases. On 17 November, Daft Punk released a version of &quot;Random Access Memories&quot; with no drums or percussion.

In April 2023, Bangalter released a solo work, the orchestral ballet score &quot;Mythologies&quot;. He gave interviews about the project and allowed himself to be photographed without a mask. He cited concerns about the progress of artificial intelligence and other technology as to why Daft Punk split, saying: &quot;As much as I love this character, the last thing I would want to be, in the world we live in, in 2023, is a robot.&quot; Bangalter said Daft Punk had wanted to not &quot;spoil the narrative&quot; while they were active, but now felt more comfortable revealing parts of their creative process. Reflecting on the split, Bangalter said he was &quot;relieved and happy to look back and say: &#x27;Okay, we didn&#x27;t mess it up too much.

On 22 February 2024, the third anniversary of their split, Daft Punk announced a Twitch broadcast of &quot;Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem&quot;. A vinyl repress of the &quot;Discovery&quot; single &quot;Something About Us&quot; was released on Record Store Day in April 2024. A 4K remaster of &quot;Interstella 5555&quot; premiered in June at Tribeca Festival. The remaster was shown in global theaters for one weekend only in December.

On 22 February 2025, the fourth anniversary of their split, Daft Punk premiered their new music video for “Television Rules the Nation”

==Artistry==

===Musical style===
Daft Punk&#x27;s musical style has been described as house, French house, electronic, dance, and disco. Sean Cooper of AllMusic described it as a blend of acid house, techno, pop, indie rock, hip hop, progressive house, funk, and electro. 

The &quot;Guardian&quot; critic Alexis Petridis described their approach as magpie-like, with extensive sampling. Homem-Christo described it as bricolage, the art of using found sounds to create new work. Bangalter said in 2008: &quot;I think that sampling is always something that we&#x27;ve completely legitimately done. It&#x27;s not something we&#x27;ve hidden, it&#x27;s almost a partisan or ideological way of making music, sampling things and being sampled ... It&#x27;s always been a way to reinterpret things—sometimes it&#x27;s using [an] element from the past, or sometimes recreating them and fooling the eyes or the ears, which is just a fun thing to do.&quot; 

According to &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, some fans were disappointed to discover that Daft Punk used samples. In 2007, Rapster released &quot;Discovered: A Collection of Daft Funk Samples&quot;, a compilation of tracks sampled by Daft Punk. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote: &quot;If [the compilation] proves anything, it isn&#x27;t that Daft Punk are surreptitious thieves—it&#x27;s that they&#x27;re transformative reinterpreters, and in more than a few cases, flat-out miracle workers.&quot; Daft Punk also used vintage equipment to recreate sounds by older artists, such as the use of a Wurlitzer piano to evoke Supertramp on &quot;Digital Love&quot;. They saw their style as retrofuturist, incorporating genres from earlier decades into what the &quot;New York Times&quot; described as &quot;an increasingly grand vision of joyful populism&quot;.

In the early 1990s, Daft Punk drew inspiration from rock and acid house in the UK. Homem-Christo referred to &quot;Screamadelica&quot; by Primal Scream as the record that &quot;put everything together&quot; in terms of genre. In 2009, Bangalter named Andy Warhol as one of Daft Punk&#x27;s early influences. On the &quot;Homework&quot; track &quot;Teachers&quot;, Daft Punk list musicians who influenced them, including the funk musician George Clinton, the rapper and producer Dr Dre, and Chicago house and Detroit techno artists including Paul Johnson, Romanthony and Todd Edwards. Homem-Christo said: &quot;Their music had a big effect on us. The sound of their productions—the compression, the sound of the kick drum and Romanthony&#x27;s voice, the emotion and soul—is part of how we sound today.&quot;

&quot;Discovery&quot; integrates influences from 70s disco and 80s crooners, and featured collaborations with Romanthony and Edwards. A major inspiration was the 1999 Aphex Twin single &quot;Windowlicker&quot;, which Bangalter said was &quot;neither a purely club track nor a very chilled-out, down-tempo relaxation track&quot;. For the &quot;&quot; soundtrack, Daft Punk drew inspiration from Wendy Carlos, the composer of the original &quot;Tron&quot; film, as well as Max Steiner, Bernard Herrmann, John Carpenter, Vangelis, Philip Glass and Maurice Jarre. For &quot;Random Access Memories,&quot; Daft Punk sought a &quot;west coast vibe&quot;, referencing acts such as Fleetwood Mac, the Doobie Brothers and the Eagles, and the French electronic musician Jean Michel Jarre.

Many Daft Punk songs feature vocals processed with effects and vocoders including Auto-Tune, a Roland SVC-350 and the Digitech Vocalist. Bangalter said: &quot;A lot of people complain about musicians using Auto-Tune. It reminds me of the late &#x27;70s when musicians in France tried to ban the synthesiser. They said it was taking jobs away from musicians. What they didn&#x27;t see was that you could use those tools in a new way instead of just for replacing the instruments that came before. People are often afraid of things that sound new.&quot;

For most public and media appearances, Daft Punk wore costumes that concealed their faces. Bangalter said they wanted the focus to be on their music, and that masks allowed them to control their image while retaining their anonymity and protecting their personal lives. He said that the 1974 film &quot;Phantom of the Paradise&quot;, in which the main character prominently wears a mask, was &quot;the foundation for a lot of what we&#x27;re about artistically&quot;. Daft Punk were also fans of the 1970s band Space, who wore space suits with helmets that hid their appearance. The mystery of Daft Punk&#x27;s identity and their elaborate disguises added to their popularity. 

Daft Punk wore masks during promotional appearances in the 1990s. Although they allowed a camera crew to film them for a French arts program at the time, Daft Punk did not speak on screen. According to Orla Lee-Fisher, the head of marketing at Virgin Records UK, in their early career Daft Punk would only consent to photographs without masks while they were DJing. In 1997, Bangalter said they had a rule to not appear in videos.

In 2001, Daft Punk began wearing robot costumes for promotional appearances and performances for &quot;Discovery,&quot; debuted in a special presentation during Cartoon Network&#x27;s Toonami block. The helmets were produced by Paul Hahn of Daft Arts and the French directors Alex and Martin, with engineering by Tony Gardner and Alterian, Inc. They were capable of various LED effects. Wigs were originally attached to both helmets, but Daft Punk removed them moments before unveiling them. Bangalter said the helmets were hot but that he became used to this. Later helmets were fitted with ventilators to prevent overheating. The costumes were compared to the makeup of Kiss and the leather jacket worn by Iggy Pop. 

With the release of &quot;Human After All&quot;, Daft Punk wore simplified helmets and black leather jackets and trousers designed by Hedi Slimane. Bangalter said Daft Punk did not want to repeat themselves and were interested in &quot;developing a persona that merges fiction and reality&quot;. On the set of &quot;Electroma&quot;, Daft Punk were interviewed with their backs turned, and in 2006 they wore cloth bags over their heads during a televised interview. They said the use of cloth bags had been a spontaneous decision, reflecting their willingness to experiment with their image. Daft Punk wore their robot costumes in their performances at the 2008, 2014, and 2017 Grammy Awards. During the 2014 ceremony, they accepted their awards on stage in the outfits, with Pharrell and Paul Williams speaking on their behalf.

Daft Punk used the robot outfits to merge the characteristics of humans and machines. Bangalter said that the personas were initially the result of shyness, but that they became exciting for the audience, &quot;the idea of being an average guy with some kind of superpower&quot;. He described it as an advanced version of glam, &quot;where it&#x27;s definitely not you&quot;. After Daft Punk&#x27;s split, Bangalter likened the robot personas to a &quot;like a Marina Abramović performance art installation that lasted for 20 years&quot;. He denied that the robots represented &quot;an unquestioning embrace of digital culture&quot;, and said: &quot;We tried to use these machines to express something extremely moving that a machine cannot feel, but a human can. We were always on the side of humanity and not on the side of technology.&quot;

===Media appearances===

Daft Punk&#x27;s popularity has been partially attributed to their appearances in mainstream media. They appeared with Juliette Lewis in an advertisement for Gap, featuring the single &quot;Digital Love&quot;, and were contractually obliged to appear only in Gap clothing. In 2001, Daft Punk appeared in an advertisement on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Toonami timeslot, promoting the official Toonami website and the animated music videos for their album &quot;Discovery&quot;. The music videos later appeared as scenes in the feature-length film &quot;Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem&quot;, in which Daft Punk make a cameo appearance as their robot alter-egos. They appeared in a television advertisement wearing their &quot;Discovery&quot;-era headgear to promote Sony Ericsson&#x27;s Premini mobile phone. In 2010, Daft Punk appeared in Adidas advertisements promoting a &quot;Star Wars&quot; clothing line. Daft Punk made a cameo in &quot;Tron: Legacy&quot; as nightclub DJs.

In 2011, Coca-Cola distributed limited edition bottles designed by Daft Punk. Daft Punk and Courtney Love were photographed for the &quot;Music Project&quot; of the fashion house Yves Saint Laurent. They appeared in their new sequined suits custom-made by Hedi Slimane, holding and playing instruments with bodies made of lucite. In 2013, Bandai released Daft Punk action figures coinciding with the release of &quot;Random Access Memories&quot; in Japan. Daft Punk made a rare public appearance at the 2013 Monaco Grand Prix in May on behalf of the Lotus F1 Team, who raced in cars emblazoned with the Daft Punk logo.

Footage of Daft Punk&#x27;s 2006 performance at the Coachella Festival was featured in the documentary film &quot;Coachella: 20 Years in the Desert&quot;, released on YouTube in April 2020. Daft Punk were scheduled to appear on 6 August 2013 episode of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; to promote &quot;Random Access Memories&quot;, but this was canceled because of contractual obligations regarding their appearance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. According to Stephen Colbert, Daft Punk were unaware of the agreement and were halted by MTV executives the morning prior to the taping. In 2015, Daft Punk appeared alongside several other musicians to announce their co-ownership of the music service Tidal at its relaunch.

&quot;Eden&quot;, a 2014 French drama film, has as its protagonist a techno fan-turned-DJ-turned recovering addict. It features Daft Punk (portrayed by actors) during different stages of their careers. Daft Punk also appear in Pharrell Williams&#x27;s 2024 biographical film &quot;Piece by Piece&quot;.

==Legacy==
Daft Punk are regarded as one of the most influential dance acts. The chief &quot;Guardian&quot; music critic Alexis Petridis named them the most influential pop artists of the 21st century. Their collaborator Pharrell Williams said they were responsible for the rise of contemporary EDM, though Bangalter was noncommittal about this, saying only that other acts were using &quot;gimmicks that at the time [Daft Punk used them] were not really gimmicks&quot;. The &quot;New York Times&quot; credited Daft Punk with helping make dance music mainstream. In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Daft Punk the 12th-greatest musical duo. In 2008, Daft Punk were voted the 38th-greatest DJs in a worldwide poll by &quot;DJ Mag&quot;.

In &quot;Losing My Edge&quot;, the first single by LCD Soundsystem, the singer James Murphy jokingly bragged about being the first to &quot;play Daft Punk to the rock kids&quot;. LCD Soundsystem also recorded the song &quot;Daft Punk Is Playing at My House&quot;, which reached No. 29 in the UK and was nominated for Best Dance Recording at the 2006 Grammy Awards.

Daft Punk tracks have been sampled or covered by other artists. &quot;Technologic&quot; was sampled by Swizz Beatz for the Busta Rhymes song &quot;Touch It&quot;. In a later remix of &quot;Touch It&quot; the line &quot;touch it, bring it, pay it, watch it, turn it, leave it, start, format it&quot; from &quot;Technologic&quot; was sung by the rapper Missy Elliott. Kanye West&#x27;s 2007 song &quot;Stronger&quot; from the album &quot;Graduation&quot; borrows the melody and features a vocal sample of Daft Punk&#x27;s &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot;. Daft Punk&#x27;s robotic costumes appeared in the music video for &quot;Stronger&quot;. The track &quot;Daftendirekt&quot; from Daft Punk&#x27;s album &quot;Homework&quot; was sampled for the Janet Jackson song &quot;So Much Betta&quot; from her 2008 album &quot;Discipline&quot;.

The track &quot;Aerodynamic&quot; was sampled for Wiley&#x27;s 2008 single &quot;Summertime&quot;. &quot;Veridis Quo&quot; from &quot;Discovery&quot; was sampled for the Jazmine Sullivan song &quot;Dream Big&quot; from her 2008 album &quot;Fearless&quot;. Daft Punk&#x27;s &quot;Around the World&quot; was sampled for JoJo&#x27;s 2009 song &quot;You Take Me (Around the World)&quot;. The song &quot;Cowboy George&quot; by the Fall contains a clip of &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot;. The a cappella group Pentatonix performed a medley of Daft Punk songs. As of November 2021, the video had been viewed over 355 million times. The medley won for Best Arrangement, Instrumental or a Cappella of the 57th Grammy Awards.

A Daft Punk medley was played at the 2017 Bastille Day parade by a French military band, in front of French President Emmanuel Macron and his many guests, which included United States President Donald Trump. &quot;Baicalellia daftpunka&quot;, a species of flatworm, was named after Daft Punk in 2018 because part of the organism resembles a helmet. In February 2024, Madame Tussauds New York unveiled their wax figures of Daft Punk.

<doc id="168312" wikidata="Q208297" url="?curid=168312" title="Irish War of Independence">
<text>The Irish War of Independence (), also known as the Anglo-Irish War, was a guerrilla war fought in Ireland from 1919 to 1921 between the Irish Republican Army (IRA, the army of the Irish Republic) and British forces: the British Army, along with the quasi-military Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and its paramilitary forces the Auxiliaries and Ulster Special Constabulary (USC). It was part of the Irish revolutionary period.

In April 1916, Irish republicans launched the Easter Rising against British rule and proclaimed an Irish Republic. Although it was defeated after a week of fighting, the Rising and the British response led to greater popular support for Irish independence. In the December 1918 election, republican party Sinn Féin won a landslide victory in Ireland. On 21 January 1919 they formed a breakaway government (Dáil Éireann) and declared Irish independence. That day, two RIC officers were killed in the Soloheadbeg ambush by IRA volunteers acting on their own initiative. The conflict developed gradually. For most of 1919, IRA activity involved capturing weaponry and freeing republican prisoners, while the Dáil set about building a state. In September, the British government outlawed the Dáil throughout Ireland, Sinn Féin was proclaimed (outlawed) in County Cork and the conflict intensified. The IRA began ambushing RIC and British Army patrols, attacking their barracks and forcing isolated barracks to be abandoned. The British government bolstered the RIC with recruits from Britain—the Black and Tans and Auxiliaries—who became notorious for ill-discipline and reprisal attacks on civilians, some of which were authorised by the British government. Thus the conflict is sometimes called the &quot;Black and Tan War&quot;. The conflict also involved civil disobedience, notably the refusal of Irish railwaymen to transport British forces or military supplies.

In mid-1920, republicans won control of most county councils, and British authority collapsed in most of the south and west, forcing the British government to introduce emergency powers. About 300 people had been killed by late 1920, but the conflict escalated in November. On Bloody Sunday in Dublin, 21 November 1920, fourteen British intelligence operatives were assassinated; then the RIC fired on the crowd at a Gaelic football match, killing fourteen civilians and wounding sixty-five. A week later, the IRA killed seventeen Auxiliaries in the Kilmichael Ambush in County Cork. In December, the British authorities declared martial law in much of southern Ireland, and the centre of Cork city was burnt out by British forces in reprisal for an ambush. Violence continued to escalate over the next seven months; 1,000 people were killed and 4,500 republicans were interned. Much of the fighting took place in Munster (particularly County Cork), Dublin and Belfast, which together saw over 75 percent of the conflict deaths.

The conflict in north-east Ulster had a sectarian aspect (see The Troubles in Ulster (1920–1922)). While the Catholic minority there mostly backed Irish independence, the Protestant majority were mostly unionist/loyalist. A mainly Protestant special constabulary was formed, and loyalist paramilitaries were active. They attacked Catholics in reprisal for IRA actions, and in Belfast a sectarian conflict raged in which almost 500 were killed, most of them Catholics. In May 1921, Ireland was partitioned under British law by the Government of Ireland Act, which created Northern Ireland.

A ceasefire began on 11 July 1921. The post-ceasefire talks led to the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty on 6 December 1921. This ended British rule in most of Ireland and, after a ten-month transitional period overseen by the Provisional Government, the Irish Free State was created as a self-governing Dominion on 6 December 1922. Northern Ireland remained within the United Kingdom. After the ceasefire, violence in Belfast and fighting in border areas of Northern Ireland continued, and the IRA launched the failed Northern Offensive in May 1922. In June 1922, disagreement among republicans over the Anglo-Irish Treaty led to the eleven-month Irish Civil War. The Irish Free State awarded 62,868 medals for service during the War of Independence, of which 15,224 were issued to IRA fighters of the flying columns.

==Origins of the conflict==
===Home Rule Crisis===

Since the 1870s, Irish nationalists in the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) had been demanding home rule, or self-government, from Britain, while not ruling out eventual complete independence. Fringe organisations, such as Arthur Griffith&#x27;s Sinn Féin, instead argued for some form of immediate Irish independence, but they were in a small minority.

The demand for home rule was eventually granted by the British government in 1912, immediately prompting a prolonged crisis within the United Kingdom as Ulster unionists formed an armed organisation the Ulster Volunteers (UVF) to resist this measure of devolution, at least in territory they could control. In turn, nationalists formed their own paramilitary organisation, the Irish Volunteers.

The British parliament passed the Government of Ireland Act 1914, known as the Home Rule Act, on 18 September 1914 with an amending bill for the partition of Ireland introduced by Ulster Unionist MPs, but the act&#x27;s implementation was immediately postponed by the Suspensory Act 1914 due to the outbreak of the First World War in the previous month. The majority of nationalists followed their IPP leaders and John Redmond&#x27;s call to support Britain and the Allied war effort in Irish regiments of the New British Army, the intention being to ensure the commencement of home rule after the war. However, a significant minority of the Irish Volunteers opposed Ireland&#x27;s involvement in the war. The Volunteer movement split, a majority leaving to form the National Volunteers under Redmond. The remaining Irish Volunteers, under Eoin MacNeill, held that they would maintain their organisation until home rule had been granted. Within this Volunteer movement, another faction, led by the separatist Irish Republican Brotherhood, began to prepare for a revolt against British rule in Ireland.

===Easter Rising===

The plan for revolt was realised in the Easter Rising of 1916, in which the Volunteers launched an insurrection whose aim was to end British rule. The insurgents issued the Proclamation of the Irish Republic, proclaiming Ireland&#x27;s independence as a republic. The Rising, in which over four hundred people died, was almost exclusively confined to Dublin and was put down within a week, but the British response, executing the leaders of the insurrection and arresting thousands of nationalist activists, galvanised support for the separatist Sinn Féin  the party which the republicans first adopted and then took over as well as followers from Countess Markievicz, who was second-in-command of the Irish Citizen Army during the Easter Rising. The British execution of the Rising&#x27;s leaders also increased support in Ireland for both a violent uprising to achieve independence from British rule and an independent Irish republic. This support was further bolstered by the British government&#x27;s decision to maintain martial law in Ireland until November 1916, the arrest of Irish critics of government policies and the possibility of conscription being extended to Ireland.

===First Dáil===

In April 1918, the British cabinet, in the face of the crisis caused by the German spring offensive, attempted with a dual policy to simultaneously link the enactment of conscription into Ireland with the implementation of home rule, as outlined in the report of the Irish Convention of 8 April 1918. This further alienated Irish nationalists and produced mass demonstrations during the Conscription Crisis of 1918. In the 1918 general election Irish voters showed their disapproval of British policy by giving Sinn Féin 70% (73 seats out of 105,) of Irish seats, 25 of those being uncontested. Sinn Féin won 91% of the seats outside of Ulster on 46.9% of votes cast but was in a minority in Ulster, where unionists were in a majority. Sinn Féin pledged not to sit in the UK Parliament at Westminster, but rather to set up an Irish parliament. This parliament, known as the First Dáil, and its ministry, called the Aireacht, consisting only of Sinn Féin members, met at the Mansion House on 21 January 1919. The Dáil reaffirmed the 1916 proclamation with the Irish Declaration of Independence, and issued a Message to the Free Nations of the World, which stated that there was an &quot;existing state of war, between Ireland and England&quot;. The Irish Volunteers were reconstituted as the &quot;Irish Republican Army&quot; or IRA. The IRA was perceived by some members of Dáil Éireann to have a mandate to wage war on the British Dublin Castle administration.

==Forces==

===British===
The heart of British power in Ireland was the Dublin Castle administration, often known to the Irish as &quot;the Castle&quot;. The head of the Castle administration was the lord lieutenant, to whom a chief secretary was responsible, leading—in the words of the British historian Peter Cottrell—to an &quot;administration renowned for its incompetence and inefficiency&quot;. Ireland was divided into three military districts. During the war, two British Army divisions, the 5th and the 6th divisions, were based in Ireland with their respective headquarters in the Curragh and Cork. By July 1921 there were 50,000 British troops based in Ireland; by contrast there were 14,000 soldiers in metropolitan Britain. While the British Army had historically been heavily dependent on Irish recruitment, concern over divided loyalties led to the redeployment from 1919 of all regular Irish regiments to garrisons outside Ireland itself.

The two main police forces in Ireland were the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and the Dublin Metropolitan Police. Of the 17,000 policemen in Ireland, 513 were killed by the IRA between 1919 and 1921 while 682 were wounded. Of the RIC&#x27;s senior officers, 60% were Irish Protestants and the rest Catholic, while 70% of the rank and file of the RIC were Irish Catholic with the rest Protestant. The RIC was trained for police work, not war, and was woefully ill-prepared to take on counter-insurgency duties. Until March 1920, London regarded the unrest in Ireland as primarily an issue for the police and did not regard it as a war. The purpose of the Army was to back up the police. In the course of the war, about a quarter of Ireland was put under martial law, mostly in Munster; in the rest of the country British authority was not deemed sufficiently threatened to warrant it. The British created two paramilitary police forces to supplement the work of the RIC, recruited mostly from World War I veterans, namely the Temporary Constables (better known as the &quot;Black and Tans&quot;) and the Temporary Cadets or Auxiliary Division (known as the &quot;Auxies&quot;).

===Irish republican===

On 25 November 1913, the Irish Volunteers were formed by Eoin MacNeill in response to the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) that had been founded earlier in the year to fight against home rule. Also in 1913, the Irish Citizen Army was founded by the trade unionists and socialists James Larkin and James Connolly following a series of violent incidents between trade unionists and the Dublin police in the Dublin lock-out. In June 1914, Nationalist leader John Redmond forced the Volunteers to give his nominees a majority on the ruling committee. When, in September 1914, Redmond encouraged the Volunteers to enlist in the British Army, a faction led by Eoin MacNeill broke with the Redmondites, who became known as the National Volunteers, rather than fight for Britain in the war. Many of the National Volunteers did enlist, and the majority of the men in the 16th (Irish) Division of the British Army had formerly served in the National Volunteers. The Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army launched the Easter Rising against British rule in 1916, when an Irish Republic was proclaimed. Thereafter they became known as the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Between 1919 and 1921 the IRA claimed to have a total strength of 70,000, but only about 3,000 were actively engaged in fighting against the Crown. The IRA distrusted those Irishmen who had fought in the British Army during the First World War, but there were exceptions, such as Emmet Dalton, Tom Barry and Martin Doyle. The basic structure of the IRA was the flying column which could number between 20 and 100 men. Finally, Michael Collins created the &quot;Squad&quot;—gunmen responsible to himself who were assigned special duties such as the assassination of policemen and suspected informers within the IRA.

==Course of the war==
===Pre-war violence===
The years between the Easter Rising of 1916 and the beginning of the War of Independence in 1919 were not bloodless. Thomas Ashe, one of the Volunteer leaders imprisoned for his role in the 1916 rebellion, died on hunger strike, after attempted force-feeding in 1917. In 1918, during disturbances arising out of the anti-conscription campaign, six civilians died in confrontations with the police and British Army and more than 1,000 people were arrested. There were raids for arms by the Volunteers, and two Kerry Volunteers (John Brown and Robert Laide) were shot and killed on 16 April 1918 during a raid on the police barracks at Gortalea. Those men were the first Volunteers to be killed during a raid for arms. At this time at least one shooting of a Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) policeman and the burning of an RIC barracks in Kerry. The attacks brought a British military presence from the summer of 1918, which only briefly quelled the violence, and an increase in police raids. However, there was as yet no co-ordinated armed campaign against British forces or RIC. In County Cork, four rifles were seized from the Eyeries barracks in March 1918 and men from the barracks were beaten that August. In early July 1918, Volunteers ambushed two RIC men who had been stationed to stop a feis being held on the road between Ballingeary and Ballyvourney in the first armed attack on the RIC since the Easter Rising—one was shot in the neck, the other beaten, and police carbines and ammunition were seized. Patrols in Bantry and Ballyvourney were badly beaten in September and October. In November 1918, Armistice Day was marked by severe rioting in Dublin that left over 100 British soldiers injured.

===Initial hostilities===

While it was not clear in the beginning of 1919 that the Dáil ever intended to gain independence by military means, and war was not explicitly threatened in Sinn Féin&#x27;s 1918 manifesto, an incident occurred on 21 January 1919, the same day as the First Dáil convened. The Soloheadbeg Ambush, in County Tipperary, was led by Seán Treacy, Séumas Robinson, Seán Hogan and Dan Breen acting on their own initiative. The IRA attacked and shot two RIC officers, Constables James McDonnell and Patrick O&#x27;Connell, who were escorting explosives. Breen later recalled:

This is widely regarded as the beginning of the War of Independence. The British government declared South Tipperary a Special Military Area under the Defence of the Realm Act two days later. The war was not formally declared by the Dáil, and it ran its course parallel to the Dáil&#x27;s political life. On 10 April 1919 the Dáil was told:

In January 1921, two years after the war had started, the Dáil debated &quot;whether it was feasible to accept formally a state of war that was being thrust on them, or not&quot;, and decided not to declare war. Then on 11 March, Dáil Éireann President Éamon de Valera called for acceptance of a &quot;state of war with England&quot;. The Dail voted unanimously to empower him to declare war whenever he saw fit, but he did not formally do so.

===Violence spreads===

Volunteers began to attack British government property, carry out raids for arms and funds and target and kill prominent members of the British administration. The first was Resident Magistrate John C. Milling, who was shot dead in Westport, County Mayo, for having sent Volunteers to prison for unlawful assembly and drilling. They mimicked the successful tactics of the Boers&#x27; fast violent raids without uniform. Although some republican leaders, notably Éamon de Valera, favoured classic conventional warfare to legitimise the new republic in the eyes of the world, the more practically experienced Collins and the broader IRA leadership opposed these tactics as they had led to the military débacle of 1916. Others, notably Arthur Griffith, preferred a campaign of civil disobedience rather than armed struggle.

During the early part of the conflict, roughly from 1919 to the middle of 1920, there was a relatively limited amount of violence. Much of the nationalist campaign involved popular mobilisation and the creation of a republican &quot;state within a state&quot; in opposition to British rule. British journalist Robert Lynd wrote in &quot;The Daily News&quot; in July 1920 that:

===Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) as special target===

The IRA&#x27;s main target throughout the conflict was the mainly Irish Catholic Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC), the British government&#x27;s armed police force in Ireland, outside Dublin. Its members and barracks (especially the more isolated ones) were vulnerable, and they were a source of much-needed arms. The RIC numbered 9,700 men stationed in 1,500 barracks throughout Ireland.

A policy of ostracism of RIC men was announced by the Dáil on 11 April 1919. This proved successful in demoralising the force as the war went on, as people turned their faces from a force increasingly compromised by association with British government repression. The rate of resignation went up and recruitment in Ireland dropped off dramatically. Often, the RIC were reduced to buying food at gunpoint, as shops and other businesses refused to deal with them. Some RIC men co-operated with the IRA through fear or sympathy, supplying the organisation with valuable information. By contrast with the effectiveness of the widespread public boycott of the police, the military actions carried out by the IRA against the RIC at this time were relatively limited. In 1919, 11 RIC men and 4 Dublin Metropolitan Police G Division detectives were killed and another 20 RIC wounded.

Other aspects of mass participation in the conflict included strikes by organised workers, in opposition to the British presence in Ireland. In Limerick in April 1919, a general strike was called by the Limerick Trades and Labour Council, as a protest against the declaration of a &quot;Special Military Area&quot; under the Defence of the Realm Act, which covered most of Limerick city and a part of the county. Special permits, to be issued by the RIC, would now be required to enter the city. The Trades Council&#x27;s special Strike Committee controlled the city for fourteen days in an episode that is known as the Limerick Soviet.

Similarly, in May 1920, Dublin dockers refused to handle any war matériel and were soon joined by the Irish Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union, who banned railway drivers from carrying members of the British forces. Blackleg train drivers were brought over from England, after drivers refused to carry British troops. The strike badly hampered British troop movements until December 1920, when it was called off. The British government managed to bring the situation to an end, when they threatened to withhold grants from the railway companies, which would have meant that workers would no longer have been paid. Attacks by the IRA also steadily increased, and by early 1920, they were attacking isolated RIC stations in rural areas, causing them to be abandoned as the police retreated to the larger towns.

===Collapse of the British administration===
In early April 1920, 400 abandoned RIC barracks were burned to the ground to prevent them being used again, along with almost one hundred income tax offices. The RIC withdrew from much of the countryside, leaving it in the hands of the IRA. In June–July 1920, assizes failed all across the south and west of Ireland; trials by jury could not be held because jurors would not attend. The collapse of the court system demoralised the RIC and many police resigned or retired. In August 1920 the Chief Secretary for Ireland Hamar Greenwood reported that 556 Constables and 313 Magistrates had resigned within two-month period. The Irish Republican Police (IRP) was founded between April and June 1920, under the authority of Dáil Éireann and the former IRA Chief of Staff Cathal Brugha to replace the RIC and to enforce the ruling of the Dáil Courts, set up under the Irish Republic. By 1920, the IRP had a presence in 21 of Ireland&#x27;s 32 counties. The Dáil Courts were generally socially conservative, despite their revolutionary origins, and halted the attempts of some landless farmers at redistribution of land from wealthier landowners to poorer farmers.

The Inland Revenue ceased to operate in most of Ireland. People were instead encouraged to subscribe to Collins&#x27; &quot;National Loan&quot;, set up to raise funds for the young government and its army. By the end of the year the loan had reached £358,000. It eventually reached £380,000. An even larger amount, totalling over $5 million, was raised in the United States by Irish Americans and sent to Ireland to finance the Republic. Rates were still paid to local councils but nine out of eleven of these were controlled by Sinn Féin, who naturally refused to pass them on to the British government. By mid-1920, the Irish Republic was a reality in the lives of many people, enforcing its own law, maintaining its own armed forces and collecting its own taxes. The British Liberal journal, &quot;The Nation&quot;, wrote in August 1920 that &quot;the central fact of the present situation in Ireland is that the Irish Republic exists&quot;.

The British forces, in trying to re-assert their control over the country, often resorted to arbitrary reprisals against republican activists and the civilian population. An unofficial government policy of reprisals began in 1919 in Fermoy, County Cork, when 200 soldiers of the King&#x27;s Shropshire Light Infantry looted and burned the main businesses of the town on 8 September, after a member of their regiment—who was the first British Army soldier to die in the war—was killed in an armed raid by local IRA volunteers on a church parade the day before (7 September). The ambushers were members of a unit of the No. 2 Cork Brigade under the command of Liam Lynch, who also wounded four British soldiers and disarmed the rest before fleeing in their cars. The local coroner&#x27;s inquest refused to return a murder verdict over the soldier and local businessmen who had sat on the jury were targeted in the reprisal.

Arthur Griffith estimated that in the first 18 months of the conflict, British forces carried out 38,720 raids on private homes, arrested 4,982 suspects, committed 1,604 armed assaults, carried out 102 indiscriminate shootings and burnings in towns and villages, and killed 77 people including women and children. In March 1920, Tomás Mac Curtain, the Sinn Féin Lord Mayor of Cork, was shot dead in front of his wife at his home, by men with blackened faces who were seen returning to the local police barracks. The jury at the inquest into his death returned a verdict of wilful murder against David Lloyd George (the British Prime Minister) and District Inspector Swanzy, among others. Swanzy was later tracked down and killed in Lisburn, County Antrim. This pattern of killings and reprisals escalated in the second half of 1920 and in 1921.

===IRA organisation and operations===
Collins was a driving force behind the independence movement. Nominally the Minister of Finance in the Republic&#x27;s government and IRA Director of Intelligence, he was involved in providing funds and arms to the IRA units and in the selection of officers. Collins&#x27; charisma and organisational capability galvanised many who came in contact with him. He established what proved an effective network of spies among sympathetic members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police&#x27;s G Division and other important branches of the British administration. The G Division men were a relatively small political division active in subverting the republican movement. They were detested by the IRA as often they were used to identify volunteers, who would have been unknown to British soldiers or the later Black and Tans. Collins set up the &quot;Squad&quot;, a group of men whose sole duty was to seek out and kill &quot;G-men&quot; and other British spies and agents. Collins&#x27; Squad began killing RIC intelligence officers in July 1919. Many G-men were offered a chance to resign or leave Ireland by the IRA. One spy who escaped with his life was F. Digby Hardy, who was exposed by Arthur Griffith before an &quot;IRA&quot; meeting, which in fact consisted of Irish and foreign journalists, and then advised to take the next boat out of Dublin.

The Chief of Staff of the IRA was Richard Mulcahy, who was responsible for organising and directing IRA units around the country. In theory, both Collins and Mulcahy were responsible to Cathal Brugha, the Dáil&#x27;s Minister of Defence, but, in practice, Brugha had only a supervisory role, recommending or objecting to specific actions. A great deal also depended on IRA leaders in local areas (such as Liam Lynch, Tom Barry, Seán Moylan, Seán Mac Eoin and Ernie O&#x27;Malley) who organised guerrilla activity, largely on their own initiative. For most of the conflict, IRA activity was concentrated in Munster and Dublin, with only isolated active IRA units elsewhere, such as in County Roscommon, north County Longford and western County Mayo.

While the paper membership of the IRA, carried over from the Irish Volunteers, was over 100,000 men, Collins estimated that only 15,000 were active in the IRA during the war, with about 3,000 on active service at any time. There were also support organisations Cumann na mBan (the IRA women&#x27;s group) and Fianna Éireann (youth movement), who carried weapons and intelligence for IRA men and secured food and lodgings for them. The IRA benefitted from the widespread help given to them by the general Irish population, who generally refused to pass information to the RIC and the British military and who often provided &quot;safe houses&quot; and provisions to IRA units &quot;on the run&quot;.

Much of the IRA&#x27;s popularity arose from the excessive reaction of the British forces to IRA activity. When Éamon de Valera returned from the United States, he demanded in the Dáil that the IRA desist from the ambushes and assassinations, which were allowing the British to portray it as a terrorist group and to take on the British forces with conventional military methods. The proposal was immediately dismissed.

===Martial law===
The British increased the use of force; reluctant to deploy the regular British Army into the country in greater numbers, they set up two auxiliary police units to reinforce the RIC. The first of these, quickly nicknamed as the Black and Tans, were seven thousand strong and mainly ex-British soldiers demobilised after World War I. Deployed to Ireland in March 1920, most came from English and Scottish cities. While officially they were part of the RIC, in reality they were a paramilitary force. After their deployment in March 1920, they rapidly gained a reputation for drunkenness and poor discipline. The wartime experience of most Black and Tans did not suit them for police duties and their violent behavior antagonised many previously neutral civilians.

In response to and retaliation for IRA actions, in the summer of 1920, the Tans burned and sacked numerous small towns throughout Ireland, including Balbriggan, Trim, Templemore and others. In other acts of reprisal, between April and August 1920 over 100 mills, creameries and other economic targets were destroyed or burned. 

In July 1920, another quasi-military police body, the Auxiliaries, consisting of 2,215 former British army officers, arrived in Ireland. The Auxiliaries had a reputation just as bad as the Tans for their mistreatment of the civilian population but tended to be more effective and more willing to take on the IRA. The policy of reprisals, which involved public denunciation or denial and private approval, was famously satirised by Lord Hugh Cecil when he said: &quot;It seems to be agreed that there is no such thing as reprisals but they are having a good effect.&quot;

On 9 August 1920, the British Parliament passed the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act. It replaced the trial by jury by courts-martial by regulation for those areas where IRA activity was prevalent.

On 10 December 1920, martial law was proclaimed in Counties Cork, Kerry, Limerick and Tipperary in Munster; in January 1921 martial law was extended to the rest of Munster in Counties Clare and Waterford, as well as counties Kilkenny and Wexford in Leinster.

It also suspended all coroners&#x27; courts because of the large number of warrants served on members of the British forces and replaced them with &quot;military courts of enquiry&quot;. The powers of military courts-martial were extended to cover the whole population and were empowered to use the death penalty and internment without trial; Government payments to local governments in Sinn Féin hands were suspended. This act has been interpreted by historians as a choice by Prime Minister David Lloyd George to put down the rebellion in Ireland rather than negotiate with the republican leadership. As a result, violence escalated steadily from that summer and sharply after November 1920 until July 1921. It was in this period that a mutiny broke out among the Connaught Rangers, stationed in India. Two were killed whilst trying to storm an armoury and one was later executed.

===Escalation: October–December 1920===
A number of events dramatically escalated the conflict in late 1920. First the Lord Mayor of Cork, Terence MacSwiney, died on hunger strike in Brixton Prison in London in October, while two other IRA prisoners on hunger strike, Joe Murphy and Michael Fitzgerald, died in Cork Jail.

Sunday, 21 November 1920, was a day of dramatic bloodshed in Dublin that became known as Bloody Sunday. In the early morning, Collins&#x27; Squad attempted to wipe out leading British intelligence operatives in the capital, in particular the Cairo Gang, killing 16 men (including two cadets, one alleged informer, and one possible case of mistaken identity) and wounding five others. The attacks took place at different places (hotels and lodgings) in Dublin.

In response, RIC men drove in trucks into Croke Park (Dublin&#x27;s GAA football and hurling ground) during a football match, shooting into the crowd. Fourteen civilians were killed, including one of the players, Michael Hogan, and a further 65 people were wounded. Later that day two republican prisoners, Dick McKee, Peadar Clancy and an unassociated friend, Conor Clune who had been arrested with them, were killed in Dublin Castle. The official account was that the three men were shot &quot;while trying to escape&quot;, which was rejected by Irish nationalists, who were certain the men had been tortured and then murdered.

On 28 November 1920, one week later, the West Cork unit of the IRA, under Tom Barry, ambushed a patrol of Auxiliaries at Kilmichael, County Cork, killing all but one of the 18-man patrol.

These actions marked a significant escalation of the conflict. In response, the counties of Cork, Kerry, Limerick, and Tipperary—all in the province of Munster—were put under martial law on 10 December under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act; this was followed on 5 January in the rest of Munster and in counties Kilkenny and Wexford in the province of Leinster. Shortly afterwards, in January 1921, &quot;official reprisals&quot; were sanctioned by the British and they began with the burning of seven houses in Midleton, County Cork. Questioned in the House of Commons in June 1921, Attorney-General for Ireland Denis Henry stated that he was informed by Commander-in-Chief Nevil Macready that 191 houses were destroyed in official reprisals in the area under martial law since January of that year. In December 1920 Macready informed the Cabinet of the British Government that Military Governors in the martial law areas had been authorized to conduct reprisals.
On 11 December, the centre of Cork City was burnt out by the Black and Tans, who then shot at firefighters trying to tackle the blaze, in reprisal for an IRA ambush in the city on 11 December 1920 which killed one Auxiliary and wounded eleven. In May of that year, the IRA began a campaign of big house burnings which totaled 26 in Cork alone.

Attempts at a truce in December 1920 were scuppered by Hamar Greenwood, who insisted on a surrender of IRA weapons first.

===Peak of violence: December 1920 – July 1921===
During the following eight months until the Truce of July 1921, there was a spiralling of the death toll in the conflict, with 1,000 people including the RIC police, army, IRA volunteers and civilians, being killed in the months between January and July 1921 alone. This represents about 70% of the total casualties for the entire three-year conflict. In addition, 4,500 IRA personnel (or suspected sympathisers) were interned in this time. In the middle of this violence, de Valera (as President of Dáil Éireann) acknowledged the state of war with Britain in March 1921.

Between 1 November 1920 and 7 June 1921 twenty-four men were executed by the British. The first IRA volunteer to be executed was Kevin Barry, one of The Forgotten Ten who were buried in unmarked graves in unconsecrated ground inside Mountjoy Prison until 2001. On 1 February, the first execution under martial law of an IRA man took place: Cornelius Murphy, of Millstreet in County Cork, was shot in Cork City. On 28 February, six more were executed, again in Cork.

On 19 March 1921, Tom Barry&#x27;s 100-strong West Cork IRA unit fought an action against 1,200 British troops—the Crossbarry Ambush. Barry&#x27;s men narrowly avoided being trapped by converging British columns and inflicted between ten and thirty killed on the British side. Just two days later, on 21 March, the Kerry IRA attacked a train at the Headford junction near Killarney. Twenty British soldiers were killed or injured, as well as two IRA men and three civilians. Most of the actions in the war were on a smaller scale than this, but the IRA did have other significant victories in ambushes, for example at Millstreet in Cork and at Scramogue in Roscommon, also in March 1921 and at Tourmakeady and Carrowkennedy in Mayo in May and June. Equally common, however, were failed ambushes, the worst of which, for example at Mourneabbey, Upton and Clonmult in Cork in February 1921, saw six, three, and twelve IRA men killed respectively and more captured. The IRA in Mayo suffered a comparable reverse at Kilmeena, while the Leitrim flying column was almost wiped out at Selton Hill. Fears of informers after such failed ambushes often led to a spate of IRA shootings of informers, real and imagined.

The biggest single loss for the IRA, however, came in Dublin. On 25 May 1921, several hundred IRA men from the Dublin Brigade occupied and burned the Custom House (the centre of local government in Ireland) in Dublin city centre. Symbolically, this was intended to show that British rule in Ireland was untenable. However, from a military point of view, it was a heavy defeat in which five IRA men were killed and over eighty captured. This showed the IRA was not well enough equipped or trained to take on British forces in a conventional manner. However, it did not, as is sometimes claimed, cripple the IRA in Dublin. The Dublin Brigade carried out 107 attacks in the city in May and 93 in June, showing a falloff in activity, but not a dramatic one. However, by July 1921, most IRA units were chronically short of both weapons and ammunition, with over 3,000 prisoners interned. Also, for all their effectiveness at guerrilla warfare, they had, as Richard Mulcahy recalled, &quot;as yet not been able to drive the enemy out of anything but a fairly good sized police barracks&quot;.

Still, many military historians have concluded that the IRA fought a largely successful and lethal guerrilla war, which forced the British government to conclude that the IRA could not be defeated militarily. The failure of the British efforts to put down the guerrillas was illustrated by the events of &quot;Black Whitsun&quot; on 13–15 May 1921. A general election for the Parliament of Southern Ireland was held on 13 May. Sinn Féin won 124 of the new parliament&#x27;s 128 seats unopposed, but its elected members refused to take their seats. Under the terms of the Government of Ireland Act 1920, the Parliament of Southern Ireland was therefore dissolved, and executive and legislative authority over Southern Ireland was effectively transferred to the Lord Lieutenant (assisted by Crown appointees). Over the next two days (14–15 May), the IRA killed fifteen policemen. These events marked the complete failure of the British Coalition Government&#x27;s Irish policy—both the failure to enforce a settlement without negotiating with Sinn Féin and a failure to defeat the IRA.

By the time of the truce, however, many republican leaders, including Collins, were convinced that if the war went on for much longer, there was a chance that the IRA campaign as it was then organised could be brought to a standstill. Because of this, plans were drawn up to &quot;bring the war to England&quot;. The IRA did take the campaign to the streets of Glasgow. It was decided that key economic targets, such as the Liverpool docks, would be bombed. The units charged with these missions would more easily evade capture because England was not under, and British public opinion was unlikely to accept, martial law. These plans were abandoned because of the truce.

== Aftermath ==

===Truce: July–December 1921===

The war of independence in Ireland ended with a truce on 11 July 1921. The conflict had reached a stalemate. Talks that had looked promising the previous year had petered out in December when Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Lloyd George insisted that the IRA first surrender their arms. Fresh talks, after the Prime Minister had come under pressure from H. H. Asquith and the Liberal opposition, the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress, resumed in the spring and resulted in the truce. From the point of view of the British government, it appeared as if the IRA&#x27;s guerrilla campaign would continue indefinitely, with spiralling costs in British casualties and in money. More importantly, the British government was facing severe criticism at home and abroad for the actions of British forces in Ireland. On 6 June 1921, the British made their first conciliatory gesture, calling off the policy of house burnings as reprisals. On the other side, IRA leaders, and in particular Collins, felt that the IRA as it was then organised could not continue indefinitely. It had been hard pressed by the deployment of more regular British soldiers to Ireland and by the lack of arms and ammunition.

The initial breakthrough that led to the truce was credited to three people: King George V, Prime Minister of South Africa General Jan Smuts and David Lloyd George. The King, who had made his unhappiness at the behaviour of the Black and Tans in Ireland well known to his government, was dissatisfied with the official speech prepared for him for the opening of the new Parliament of Northern Ireland, created as a result of the partition of Ireland. Smuts, a close friend of the King, suggested to him that the opportunity should be used to make an appeal for conciliation in Ireland. The King asked him to draft his ideas on paper. Smuts prepared this draft and gave copies to the King and to Lloyd George. Lloyd George then invited Smuts to attend a British cabinet meeting consultations on the &quot;interesting&quot; proposals Lloyd George had received, without either man informing the Cabinet that Smuts had been their author. Faced with the endorsement of them by Smuts, the King and Lloyd George, the ministers reluctantly agreed to the King&#x27;s planned &quot;reconciliation in Ireland&quot; speech.

The speech, when delivered in Belfast on 22 June, was universally well received. It called on &quot;all Irishmen to pause, to stretch out the hand of forbearance and conciliation, to forgive and to forget, and to join in making for the land they love a new era of peace, contentment, and good will&quot;.

On 24 June 1921, the British coalition government&#x27;s cabinet decided to propose talks with the leader of Sinn Féin. Coalition Liberals and Unionists agreed that an offer to negotiate would strengthen the government&#x27;s position if Sinn Féin refused. Austen Chamberlain, the new leader of the Unionist Party, said that &quot;the King&#x27;s Speech ought to be followed up as a last attempt at peace before we go the full lengths of martial law&quot;. Seizing the momentum, Lloyd George wrote to Éamon de Valera as &quot;the chosen leader of the great majority in Southern Ireland&quot; on 24 June, suggesting a conference. Sinn Féin responded by agreeing to talks. De Valera and Lloyd George ultimately agreed to a truce that was intended to end the fighting and lay the ground for detailed negotiations. Its terms were signed on 9 July and came into effect on 11 July. Negotiations on a settlement, however, were delayed for some months as the British government insisted that the IRA first decommission its weapons, but this demand was eventually dropped. It was agreed that British troops would remain confined to their barracks.

Most IRA officers on the ground interpreted the truce merely as a temporary respite and continued recruiting and training volunteers. Nor did attacks on the RIC or British Army cease altogether. Between December 1921 and February of the next year, there were 80 recorded attacks by the IRA on the soon-to-be disbanded RIC, leaving 12 dead. On 18 February 1922, Ernie O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s IRA unit raided the RIC barracks at Clonmel, taking 40 policemen prisoner and seizing over 600 weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition. In April 1922, in the Dunmanway killings, an IRA party in Cork killed 10 local suspected Protestant informers in retaliation for the shooting of one of their men. Those killed were named in captured British files as informers before the truce signed the previous July. Over 100 Protestant families fled the area after the killings.
===Treaty===

Ultimately, the peace talks led to the negotiation of the Anglo-Irish Treaty (6 December 1921), which was then ratified in triplicate: by Dáil Éireann on 7 January 1922 (so giving it legal legitimacy under the governmental system of the Irish Republic), by the House of Commons of Southern Ireland in January 1922 (so giving it constitutional legitimacy according to British theory of who was the legal government in Ireland), and by both Houses of the British parliament.

The Treaty allowed Northern Ireland, which had been created by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, to opt out of the Free State if it wished, which it duly did on 8 December 1922 under the procedures laid down. As agreed, an Irish Boundary Commission was then created to decide on the precise location of the border of the Free State and Northern Ireland. The republican negotiators understood that the commission would redraw the border according to local nationalist or unionist majorities. Since the 1920 local elections in Ireland had resulted in outright nationalist majorities in County Fermanagh, County Tyrone, the City of Derry and in many district electoral divisions of County Armagh and County Londonderry (all north and west of the &quot;interim&quot; border), this might well have left Northern Ireland unviable. However, the Commission chose to leave the border unchanged; as a trade-off, the money owed to Britain by the Free State under the Treaty was cancelled (see Partition of Ireland).

A new system of government was created for the new Irish Free State, though for the first year two governments co-existed; an Dáil Ministry headed by President Griffith, and a Provisional Government nominally answerable to the House of Commons of Southern Ireland and appointed by the Lord Lieutenant.

===Irish Civil War===

Most of the Irish independence movement&#x27;s leaders were willing to accept this compromise, at least for the time being, though many militant republicans were not. A majority of the pre-Truce IRA who had fought in the War of Independence, led by Liam Lynch, refused to accept the Treaty and in March 1922 repudiated the authority of the Dáil and the new Free State government, which it accused of betraying the ideal of the Irish Republic. It also broke the Oath of Allegiance to the Irish Republic which the Dáil had instated on 20 August 1919. The anti-Treaty IRA were supported by the former president of the Republic, Éamon de Valera, and ministers Cathal Brugha and Austin Stack.
While the violence in the North was still raging, the South of Ireland was preoccupied with the split in the Dáil and in the IRA over the Treaty. In April 1922, an executive of IRA officers repudiated the Treaty and the authority of the Provisional Government which had been set up to administer it. These republicans held that the Dáil did not have the right to disestablish the Irish Republic. A hardline group of anti-Treaty IRA men occupied several public buildings in Dublin in an effort to bring down the Treaty and restart the war with the British. There were a number of armed confrontations between pro and anti-Treaty troops before matters came to a head in late June 1922. Desperate to get the new Irish Free State off the ground and under British pressure, Collins attacked the anti-Treaty militants in Dublin, causing fighting to break out around the country.

The subsequent civil war lasted until mid-1923 and cost the lives of many of the leaders of the independence movement, notably the head of the Provisional Government Michael Collins, ex-minister Cathal Brugha, and anti-Treaty republicans Harry Boland, Rory O&#x27;Connor, Liam Mellows, Liam Lynch and many others: total casualties have never been determined but were perhaps higher than those in the earlier fighting against the British. President Arthur Griffith also died of a cerebral haemorrhage during the conflict.

Following the deaths of Griffith and Collins, W. T. Cosgrave became head of government. On 6 December 1922, following the coming into legal existence of the Irish Free State, W. T. Cosgrave became President of the Executive Council, the first internationally recognised head of an independent Irish government.

The civil war ended in mid-1923 in defeat for the anti-Treaty side.

==North-east==

The conflict in the north-east had a sectarian aspect. While Ireland as a whole had an Irish nationalist and Catholic majority, Unionists and Protestants were a majority in the north-east, largely due to 17th century British colonization. These Ulster Unionists wanted to maintain ties to Britain and did not want to be part of an independent Ireland. They had threatened to oppose Irish home rule with violence. The British government proposed to solve this by partitioning Ireland on roughly political and religious lines, creating two self-governing territories of the UK: Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. Irish nationalists opposed this, most of them supporting the all-island Irish Republic.

The IRA carried out attacks on British forces in the north-east, but was less active than in the south. Protestant loyalists attacked the Catholic community in reprisal. There were outbreaks of sectarian violence from June 1920 to June 1922, influenced by political and military events. Most of it was in the city of Belfast, which saw &quot;savage and unprecedented&quot; communal violence between Protestants and Catholics. In the Belfast violence, Hibernians were more involved on the Catholic/nationalist side than the IRA, while groups such as the Ulster Volunteers were involved on the Protestant/loyalist side. There was rioting, gun battles and bombings. Almost 1,000 homes and businesses were destroyed and people were expelled from workplaces and mixed neighbourhoods. More than 500 were killed and more than 10,000 became refugees, most of them Catholics. The British Army was deployed and the Ulster Special Constabulary (USC) was formed to help the regular police. The USC was almost wholly Protestant and some of its members carried out reprisal attacks on Catholics. Conflict continued in Northern Ireland after the July 1921 truce; both communal violence in Belfast and guerrilla conflict in rural border areas.

Irish nationalists argued that the violence around Belfast was a pogrom against Catholics/nationalists, as Catholics were a quarter of the city&#x27;s population but made up two-thirds of those killed, suffered 80% of the property destruction and made up 80% of refugees. Historian Alan Parkinson says the term &#x27;pogrom&#x27; is misleading, as the violence was not all one-sided nor co-ordinated. The Irish government estimated that 50,000 left Northern Ireland permanently due to violence and intimidation.

===Summer 1920===

While the IRA was less active in the north-east than in the south, Ulster unionists saw themselves as besieged by Irish republicans. The January and June 1920 local elections saw Irish nationalists and republicans win control of many northern urban councils, as well as Tyrone and Fermanagh county councils. Derry City had its first Irish nationalist and Catholic mayor.

Fighting broke out in Derry on 18 June 1920 and lasted a week. Catholic homes were attacked in the mainly Protestant Waterside, and Catholics fled by boat across the Foyle while coming under fire. In the Cityside, Loyalists fired from the Fountain neighbourhood into Catholic streets, while the IRA occupied St Columb&#x27;s College and returned fire. At least fourteen Catholics and five Protestants were killed in the violence. Eventually, 1,500 British troops were deployed in Derry and imposed a curfew.

On 17 July, British Colonel Gerald Smyth was assassinated by the IRA in Cork. He had allegedly told police officers to shoot civilians who did not immediately obey orders. Smyth came from Banbridge, County Down. Loyalists retaliated by attacking many Catholic homes and businesses in Banbridge and expelling Catholics from their jobs, forcing many to flee the town. There were similar attacks in nearby Dromore.

On 21 July, loyalists drove 8,000 &quot;disloyal&quot; co-workers from their jobs in the Belfast shipyards, all of them either Catholics or Protestant labour activists. Some were viciously attacked. This was partly in response to recent IRA actions and partly because of competition over jobs due to high unemployment. It was fuelled by rhetoric from Unionist politicians. In his Twelfth of July speech, Edward Carson had called for loyalists to take matters into their own hands, and had linked republicanism with socialism and the Catholic Church. The expulsions sparked fierce sectarian rioting in Belfast, and British troops used machine-guns to disperse rioters. By the end of the day, eleven Catholics and eight Protestants were killed and hundreds wounded. Catholic workers were soon driven out of all major Belfast factories. In response, the Dáil approved the &#x27;Belfast Boycott&#x27; of Unionist-owned businesses and banks in the city. It was enforced by the IRA, who halted trains and lorries and destroyed goods.

On 22 August, the IRA assassinated RIC Inspector Oswald Swanzy as he left church in Lisburn. Swanzy had been implicated in the killing of Cork Mayor Tomás Mac Curtain. In revenge, loyalists burned and looted hundreds of Catholic businesses and homes in Lisburn, forcing many Catholics to flee (see the Burnings in Lisburn). As a result, Lisburn was the first town to recruit special constables. After some of them were charged with rioting, their colleagues threatened to resign, and they were not prosecuted.
In September, Unionist leader James Craig wrote to the British government demanding that a special constabulary be recruited from the ranks of the Ulster Volunteers. He warned, &quot;Loyalist leaders now feel the situation is so desperate that unless the Government will take immediate action, it may be advisable for them to see what steps can be taken towards a system of organised reprisals against the rebels&quot;. The USC was formed in October and, in the words of historian Michael Hopkinson, &quot;amounted to an officially approved UVF&quot;.

===Spring–summer 1921===

After a lull in violence in the North, the conflict there intensified again in spring 1921. In February, as reprisal for the shooting of a Special Constable, USC and UVF men burned ten Catholic homes and a priest&#x27;s house in Rosslea, County Fermanagh. The following month, the IRA attacked the homes of sixteen Special Constables in the Rosslea district, killing three and wounding others.

The Act of Partition came into force on 3 May 1921. That month, James Craig secretly met Éamon de Valera in Dublin. They discussed the possibility of a truce in Ulster and an amnesty for prisoners. Craig proposed a compromise of limited independence for the South and autonomy for the North within the UK. The talks came to nothing and violence in the North continued. Elections to the Northern parliament were held on 24 May, in which Unionists won most seats. Its parliament first met on 7 June and formed a devolved government, headed by Craig. Republican and nationalist members refused to attend. King George V addressed the ceremonial opening of the Northern parliament on 22 June. The next day, a train carrying the king&#x27;s armed escort, the 10th Royal Hussars, was derailed by an IRA bomb at Adavoyle, County Armagh. Five soldiers and a train guard were killed, as were fifty horses. A civilian bystander was also shot dead by British soldiers.

Loyalists condemned the truce as a &#x27;sell-out&#x27; to republicans. On 10 July, a day before the ceasefire was to begin, police launched a raid against republicans in west Belfast. The IRA ambushed them on Raglan Street, killing an officer. This sparked a day of violence known as Belfast&#x27;s Bloody Sunday. Protestant loyalists attacked Catholic enclaves in west Belfast, burning homes and businesses. This led to sectarian clashes between Protestants and Catholics, and gun battles between police and nationalists. The USC allegedly drove through Catholic enclaves firing indiscriminately. Twenty people were killed or fatally wounded (including twelve Catholics and six Protestants) before the truce began at noon on 11 July. After the truce came into effect on 11 July, the USC was demobilized (July–November 1921). The void left by the demobilized USC was filled by loyalist vigilante groups and a revived UVF.

There were further outbreaks of violence in Belfast after the truce. Twenty people were killed in street fighting and assassinations from 29 August to 1 September 1921 and another thirty were killed from 21 to 25 November. Loyalists had by this time taken to throwing bombs randomly into Catholic streets and the IRA responded by bombing trams carrying Protestant workmen.

===Early 1922===
Despite the Dáil&#x27;s acceptance of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in January 1922, which confirmed the future existence of Northern Ireland, there were clashes between the IRA and British forces along the new border from early 1922. In part, this reflected Collins&#x27; view that the Treaty was a &quot;stepping stone&quot;, rather than a final settlement. That month, Collins became head of the new Irish Provisional Government and the Irish National Army was founded, though the IRA continued to exist.

In January 1922, members of the Monaghan Gaelic football team were arrested by Northern police on their way to a match in Derry. Among them were IRA volunteers with plans to free IRA prisoners from Derry prison. In response, on the night of 7–8 February, IRA units crossed the border and captured almost fifty Special Constables and prominent loyalists in Fermanagh and Tyrone. They were to be held as hostages for the Monaghan prisoners. Several IRA volunteers were also captured during the raids. This operation had been approved by Michael Collins, Richard Mulcahy, Frank Aiken and Eoin O&#x27;Duffy. The Northern Ireland authorities responded by sealing-off many cross-border roads.

In February and March 1922, violence in the North reached levels that had not been seen before. Between 11 February and 31 March, 51 Catholics were killed with 115 wounded, with 32 Protestants killed and 86 wounded. On 11 February, IRA volunteers stopped a group of armed Special Constables at Clones railway station, County Monaghan. The USC unit was travelling by train from Belfast to Enniskillen (both in Northern Ireland), but the Provisional Government was unaware that British forces would be crossing through its territory. The IRA called on the Specials to surrender for questioning, but one of them shot dead an IRA sergeant. This sparked a firefight in which four Specials were killed and several wounded. Five others were captured. The incident threatened to set off a major confrontation between North and South, and the British government temporarily suspended the withdrawal of British troops from the South. The Border Commission was set up to mediate in any future border disputes, but achieved very little.

These incidents provoked retaliation attacks by loyalists against Catholics in Belfast, sparking further sectarian clashes. In the three days after the Clones incident, more than 30 people were killed in the city, including four Catholic children and two women who were killed by a loyalist grenade on Weaver Street.

On 18 March, Northern police raided IRA headquarters in Belfast, seizing weapons and lists of IRA volunteers. The Provisional Government condemned this as a breach of the truce. Over the next two weeks, the IRA raided several police barracks in the North, killed several officers and captured fifteen.

On 24 March, six Catholics were shot dead by Special Constables who broke into the home of the McMahon family. This was in revenge for the IRA killing of two policemen. A week later, six more Catholics were killed by Specials in another revenge attack, known as the Arnon Street massacre.

Winston Churchill had arranged a meeting between Collins and James Craig on 21 January and the southern boycott of Belfast goods was lifted but then re-imposed after several weeks. The two leaders had further meetings, but despite a joint declaration that &quot;peace is declared&quot; on 30 March, violence continued.

===Summer 1922: Northern Offensive===

In May 1922 the IRA launched a Northern Offensive, secretly backed by Collins, head of the Irish Provisional Government. By this time, the IRA was split over the Anglo-Irish Treaty, but both pro and anti-Treaty units were involved. Some weaponry sent by the British to arm the National Army were in fact given to IRA units and their weapons sent to the North. However, the offensive was a failure. An IRA Belfast Brigade report in late May concluded that continuing the offensive was &quot;futile and foolish&quot; and would &quot;place the Catholic population at the mercy of the Specials&quot;.

On 22 May, after the assassination of West Belfast Unionist MP William Twaddell, the Northern government introduced internment and 350 IRA men were arrested in Belfast, crippling its organisation there. The biggest clash of the IRA offensive was the Battle of Pettigo and Belleek, which ended with British troops using artillery to dislodge around 100 IRA volunteers from the border villages of Pettigo and Belleek, killing three volunteers. This was the last major confrontation between the IRA and British forces during the revolutionary period. The cycle of sectarian violence in Belfast continued. In May, 75 people were killed in Belfast and another 30 in June. Several thousand Catholics fled the violence and sought refuge in Glasgow and Dublin. On 17 June, in revenge for the killing of two Catholics by Specials, Frank Aiken&#x27;s IRA unit shot dead six Protestant civilians in Altnaveigh, south Armagh. Three Specials were also ambushed and killed.

Collins held Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson, MP for North Down, responsible for the attacks on Catholics in the North and may have been behind his assassination in June 1922, though who ordered the shooting is unproven. The event helped to trigger the Irish Civil War. Winston Churchill insisted after the killing that Collins take action against the Anti-Treaty IRA, whom he assumed to be responsible. The outbreak of civil war in the south ended the violence in the North, as the war demoralised the northern IRA and diverted the organisation from the issue of partition. The Irish Free State quietly ended Collins&#x27; policy of covert armed action in Northern Ireland.

The violence in the North was over by late 1922.

==Detention==

Ballykinlar internment camp was the first mass internment camp in Ireland during the Irish War of Independence holding almost 2,000 men. Ballykinlar gained a reputation for brutality: three prisoners were shot dead and five died from maltreatment.
At HM Prison Crumlin Road in Belfast, Cork County Gaol (see 1920 Cork hunger strike) and Mountjoy jail in Dublin some of the political prisoners went on hunger strike. In 1920 two Irish republicans died as a result of hunger strikes—Michael Fitzgerald d. 17 October 1920 and Joe Murphy d. 25 October 1920.
Conditions during internment were not always good—during the 1920s, the vessel was moored in Belfast Lough and used as a prison ship for the holding of Irish republicans by the British government after Bloody Sunday. Cloistered below decks in cages which held 50 internees, the prisoners were forced to use broken toilets which overflowed frequently into their communal area. Deprived of tables, the already weakened men ate off the floor, frequently succumbing to disease and illness as a result. There were several hunger strikes on the Argenta, including a major strike involving upwards of 150 men in the winter of 1923.

==Killing of alleged spies==
In recent decades, attention has been drawn to the IRA&#x27;s killing of civilians in the south, who they alleged were informers. Several historians, notably Peter Hart have alleged that those killed in this manner were often simply considered &quot;enemies&quot; rather than being proven informers. Especially vulnerable, it is argued, were Protestants, ex-soldiers and tramps. &quot;It was not merely (or even mainly) a matter of espionage, spies and spy hunters, it was a civil war between and within communities&quot;. The notion that sectarianism was a factor in a majority of killings has been criticised, with opposing historians contending that Protestant victims were killed for their resistance to republican goals rather than their religious beliefs.

Victims&#x27; bodies were often disfigured and left with notes that alleged espionage, claimed responsibility and/or discouraged similar deception. Their hair forcefully removed, women were more often disfigured than killed, instead marked as supposed traitors.

==Propaganda war==
Another feature of the war was the use of propaganda by both sides.

The British government also collected material on the liaison between Sinn Féin and Soviet Russia, in an unsuccessful attempt to portray Sinn Féin as a crypto-communist movement.

The Catholic Church hierarchy was critical of the violence of both sides, but especially that of the IRA, continuing a long tradition of condemning militant republicanism. The Bishop of Kilmore, Patrick Finegan, said: &quot;Any war... to be just and lawful must be backed by a well grounded hope of success. What hope of success have you against the mighty forces of the British Empire? None... none whatever and if it unlawful as it is, every life taken in pursuance of it is murder.&quot; Thomas Gilmartin, the Archbishop of Tuam, issued a letter saying that IRA men who took part in ambushes &quot;have broken the truce of God, they have incurred the guilt of murder&quot;. However, in May 1921, Pope Benedict XV dismayed the British government when he issued a letter that exhorted the &quot;English as well as Irish to calmly consider . . . some means of mutual agreement&quot;, as they had been pushing for a condemnation of the rebellion. They declared that his comments &quot;put HMG (His Majesty&#x27;s Government) and the Irish murder gang on a footing of equality&quot;.

Desmond FitzGerald and Erskine Childers were active in producing the &quot;Irish Bulletin&quot;, which detailed government atrocities which Irish and British newspapers were unwilling or unable to cover. It was printed secretly and distributed throughout Ireland, and to international press agencies and US, European and sympathetic British politicians.

While the military war made most of Ireland ungovernable from early 1920, it did not actually remove British forces from any part. But the success of Sinn Féin&#x27;s propaganda campaign reduced the option of the British government to deepen the conflict; it worried in particular about the effect on British relations with the US, where groups like the American Committee for Relief in Ireland had so many eminent members. The British cabinet had not sought the war that had developed since 1919. By 1921 one of its members, Winston Churchill, reflected:

==Casualties==

According to &quot;The Dead of the Irish Revolution&quot;, 2,346 people were killed or died as a result of the conflict. This counts a small number of deaths before and after the war, from 1917 until the signing of the Treaty at the end of 1921. Of those killed, 919 were civilians, 523 were police personnel, 413 were British military personnel, and 491 were IRA volunteers (although another source gives 550 IRA dead). About 44% of these British military deaths were by misadventure (such as accidental shooting) and suicide while on active service, as were 10% of police losses and 14% of IRA losses. About 36% of police personnel who died were born outside Ireland.

At least 557 people were killed in political violence in what became Northern Ireland between July 1920 and July 1922. Many of these deaths took place after the truce that ended fighting in the rest of Ireland. Of these deaths, between 303 and 340 were Catholic civilians, between 172 and 196 were Protestant civilians, 82 were police personnel (38 RIC and 44 USC), and 35 were IRA volunteers. Most of the violence took place in Belfast: at least 452 people were killed there – 267 Catholics and 185 Protestants.

==Post-war evacuation of British forces==
By October 1921 the British Army in Ireland numbered 57,000 men, along with 14,200 RIC police and some 2,600 auxiliaries and Black and Tans. The long-planned evacuation from dozens of barracks in what the army called &quot;Southern Ireland&quot; started on 12 January 1922, following the ratification of the Treaty and took nearly a year, organised by General Nevil Macready. It was a huge logistical operation, but within the month Dublin Castle and Beggars Bush Barracks were transferred to the Provisional Government. The RIC last paraded on 4 April and was formally disbanded on 31 August. By the end of May the remaining forces were concentrated in Dublin, Cork and Kildare. Tensions that led to the Irish Civil War were evident by then and evacuation was suspended. By November about 6,600 soldiers remained in Dublin at 17 locations. Finally on 17 December 1922 The Royal Barracks (now housing collections of the National Museum of Ireland) was transferred to General Richard Mulcahy and the garrison embarked at Dublin Port that evening.

==Compensation==
In May 1922 the British Government with the agreement of the Irish Provisional Government established a commission chaired by Lord Shaw of Dunfermline to examine compensation claims for material damage caused between 21 January 1919 and 11 July 1921. The Irish Free State&#x27;s Damage To Property (Compensation) Act, 1923 provided that only the Shaw Commission, and not the Criminal Injury Acts, could be used to claim compensation. Originally, the British government paid claims from unionists and the Irish government those from nationalists; claims from &quot;neutral&quot; parties were shared. After the 1925 collapse of the Irish Boundary Commission, the UK, Free State and Northern Ireland governments negotiated revisions to the 1921 Treaty; the Free State stopped contributing to the servicing of the UK national debt, but took over full responsibility for compensation for war damage, with the fund increased by 10% in 1926. The Compensation (Ireland) Commission worked until March 1926, processing thousands of claims.

==Role of women in the war==

Although most of the fighting was carried out by men, women played a substantial supporting role in the Irish War of Independence. Before the Easter Rising of 1916, many Irish nationalist women were brought together through organisations fighting for women&#x27;s suffrage, such as the Irish Women&#x27;s Franchise League. The republican socialist Irish Citizen Army promoted gender equality and many of these women—including Constance Markiewicz, Madeleine ffrench-Mullen, and Kathleen Lynn—joined the group. In 1914, the all-female paramilitary group Cumann na mBan was launched as an auxiliary of the Irish Volunteers. During the Easter Rising, some women participated in fighting and carried messages between Irish Volunteer posts while under fire from British troops. After the rebel defeat, Éamon de Valera opposed the participation of women in combat and they were limited to supporting roles.

During the conflict, women hid IRA volunteers being sought by the British, nursed wounded volunteers, and gathered money to help republican prisoners and their families. Cumann na mBan engaged in undercover work to set back the British war effort. They smuggled guns, ammunition, and money to the IRA; Kathleen Clarke smuggled gold worth £2,000 from Limerick to Dublin for Collins. Because they sheltered wanted men, many women were subject to raids on their homes by British forces, with acts of sexual violence sometimes being reported but not confirmed. Intimidation was more commonly applied to women than physical violence. It is estimated that there were between 3,000 and 9,000 members of Cumann na mBan during the war, and in 1921 there were 800 branches throughout the island. It is estimated that fewer than 50 women were imprisoned by the British during the war.

==Memorial==
A memorial called the Garden of Remembrance was erected in Dublin in 1966, on the fiftieth anniversary of the Easter Rising. The date of signing of the truce is commemorated by the National Day of Commemoration, when all those Irish men and women who fought in wars in specific armies (e.g., the Irish unit(s) fighting in the British Army in 1916 at the Battle of the Somme) are commemorated.

The last survivor of the conflict, Dan Keating (of the IRA), died in October 2007 at the age of 105.

<text>A pictogram (also pictogramme, pictograph, or simply picto) is a graphical symbol that conveys meaning through its visual resemblance to a physical object. Pictograms are used in systems of writing and visual communication. A pictography is a writing system which uses pictograms. Some pictograms, such as hazard pictograms, may be elements of formal languages.

In the field of prehistoric art, the term &quot;pictograph&quot; has a different definition, and specifically refers to art painted on rock surfaces. Pictographs are contrasted with petroglyphs, which are carved or incised.

==Historical==
Early written symbols were based on pictograms (pictures which resemble what they signify) and ideograms (symbols which represent ideas). Ancient Sumerian, Egyptian, and Chinese civilizations began to adapt such symbols to represent concepts, developing them into logographic writing systems. Pictograms are still in use as the main medium of written communication in some non-literate cultures in Africa, the Americas, and Oceania. Pictograms are often used as simple, pictorial, representational symbols by most contemporary cultures.

Pictograms can be considered an art form, or can be considered a written language and are designated as such in Pre-Columbian art, Native American art, Ancient Mesopotamia and Painting in the Americas before Colonization. One example of many is the Rock art of the Chumash people, part of the Native American history of California.
In 2011, UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage List added &quot;Petroglyph Complexes of the Mongolian Altai, Mongolia&quot; to celebrate the importance of the pictograms engraved in rocks.

Some scientists in the field of neuropsychiatry and neuropsychology, such as Mario Christian Meyer, are studying the symbolic meaning of indigenous pictographs and petroglyphs, aiming to create new ways of communication between native people and modern scientists to safeguard and valorize their cultural diversity.

== Modern uses ==
An early modern example of the extensive use of pictograms may be seen in the map in the London suburban timetables of the London and North Eastern Railway, 1936–1947, designed by George Dow, in which a variety of pictograms was used to indicate facilities available at or near each station. Pictograms remain in common use today, serving as pictorial, representational signs, instructions, or statistical diagrams. Because of their graphical nature and fairly realistic style, they are widely used to indicate public toilets, or places such as airports and train stations. Because they are a concise way to communicate a concept to people who speak many different languages, pictograms have also been used extensively at the Olympics since the 1964 summer games in Tokyo featured designs by Masaru Katsumi. Later Olympic pictograms have been redesigned for each set of games.

Pictographic writing as a modernist poetic technique is credited to Ezra Pound, though French surrealists credit the Pacific Northwest American Indians of Alaska who introduced writing, via totem poles, to North America.

Contemporary artist Xu Bing created Book from the Ground, a universal language made up of pictograms collected from around the world. A Book from the Ground chat program has been exhibited in museums and galleries internationally.

==In mathematics==
In statistics, pictograms are charts in which icons represent numbers to make it more interesting and easier to understand. A key is often included to indicate what each icon represents. All icons must be of the same size, but a fraction of an icon can be used to show the respective fraction of that amount.

For example, the following table:

can be graphed as follows:

Key: = 10 letters

As the values are rounded to the nearest 5 letters, the second icon on Tuesday is the left half of the original.

==Standardization==
Pictograms can often transcend languages in that they can communicate to speakers of a number of tongues and language families equally effectively, even if the languages and cultures are completely different. This is why road signs and similar pictographic material are often applied as global standards expected to be understood by nearly all.

A standard set of pictograms was defined in the international standard &quot;ISO 7001: Public Information Symbols&quot;. Other common sets of pictographs are the laundry symbols used on clothing tags and the chemical hazard symbols as standardized by the GHS system.

Pictograms have been popularized in use on the Internet and in software, better known as &quot;icons&quot; displayed on a computer screen in order to help user navigate a computer system or mobile device.
