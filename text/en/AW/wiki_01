<text>Aladdin ( ; , , ATU 561, &#x27;Aladdin&#x27;) is a Middle-Eastern folk tale. It is one of the best-known tales associated with &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; (often known in English as &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot;), despite not being part of the original text; it was added by the Frenchman Antoine Galland, based on a folk tale that he heard from the Syrian storyteller Hanna Diyab.

==Sources==
Known along with Ali Baba as one of the &quot;orphan tales&quot;, the story was not part of the original &quot;Nights&quot; collection and has no authentic Arabic textual source, but was incorporated into the book &quot;Les mille et une nuits&quot; by its French translator, Antoine Galland.

John Payne quotes passages from Galland&#x27;s unpublished diary recording Galland&#x27;s encounter with a Maronite storyteller from Aleppo, Hanna Diyab. According to Galland&#x27;s diary, he met with Hanna, who had travelled from Aleppo to Paris with celebrated French traveller Paul Lucas, on March 25, 1709. Galland&#x27;s diary further reports that his transcription of &quot;Aladdin&quot; for publication occurred in the winter of 1709–10. It was included in his volumes ix and x of the &quot;Nights&quot;, published in 1710, without any mention or published acknowledgment of Hanna&#x27;s contribution.

Payne also records the discovery in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris of two Arabic manuscripts containing &quot;Aladdin&quot; (with two more of the &quot;interpolated&quot; tales). One was written by a Syrian Christian priest living in Paris, named Dionysios Shawish, alias Dom Denis Chavis. The other is supposed to be a copy Mikhail Sabbagh made of a manuscript written in Baghdad in 1703. It was purchased by the Bibliothèque Nationale at the end of the nineteenth century. As part of his work on the first critical edition of the &quot;Nights&quot;, Iraq&#x27;s Muhsin Mahdi has shown that both these manuscripts are &quot;back-translations&quot; of Galland&#x27;s text into Arabic.

Ruth B. Bottigheimer and Paulo Lemos Horta have argued that Hanna Diyab should be understood as the original author of some of the stories he supplied, and even that several of Diyab&#x27;s stories (including &quot;Aladdin&quot;) were partly inspired by Diyab&#x27;s own life, as there are parallels with his autobiography.

==Plot==

The story is often retold with variations. The following is a précis of the Burton translation of 1885.

Aladdin is an impoverished young ne&#x27;er-do-well, dwelling in &quot;one of the cities of Ancient China.&quot; He is recruited by a sorcerer from the Maghreb, who passes himself off as the brother of Aladdin&#x27;s late father, Mustapha the tailor, convincing Aladdin and his mother of his good will by pretending to set up the lad as a wealthy merchant. The sorcerer&#x27;s real motive is to persuade young Aladdin to retrieve a wonderful oil lamp (chirag) from a booby-trapped magic cave. After the sorcerer attempts to double-cross him, Aladdin finds himself trapped in the cave. Aladdin is still wearing a magic ring the sorcerer has lent him. When he rubs his hands in despair, he inadvertently rubs the ring and a genie appears and releases him from the cave, allowing him to return to his mother while in possession of the lamp. When his mother tries to clean the lamp, so they can sell it to buy food for their supper, a second, far more powerful genie appears; this one is bound to do the bidding of the person holding the lamp.

With the aid of the genie of the lamp, Aladdin becomes rich and powerful and marries Princess Badroulbadour, the sultan&#x27;s daughter (after magically foiling her marriage to the vizier&#x27;s son). The genie builds Aladdin and his bride a wonderful palace, far more magnificent than the sultan&#x27;s.

The sorcerer hears of Aladdin&#x27;s good fortune, and returns; he gets his hands on the lamp by tricking Aladdin&#x27;s wife (who is unaware of the lamp&#x27;s importance) by offering to exchange &quot;new lamps for old&quot;. He orders the genie of the lamp to take the palace, along with all its contents, to his home in the Maghreb. Aladdin still has the magic ring and is able to summon the lesser genie. The genie of the ring is too weak to directly undo any of the magic of the genie of the lamp, but he is able to transport Aladdin to the Maghreb where, with the help of the &quot;woman&#x27;s wiles&quot; of the princess, he recovers the lamp and slays the sorcerer, returning the palace to its proper place.

The sorcerer&#x27;s more powerful and evil brother plots to destroy Aladdin for killing his brother by disguising himself as an old woman known for her healing powers. Badroulbadour falls for his disguise and commands the &quot;woman&quot; to stay in her palace in case of any illnesses. Aladdin is warned of this danger by the genie of the lamp and slays the impostor.

Aladdin eventually succeeds to his father-in-law&#x27;s throne.

==Setting==
The opening sentences of the story, in both the Galland and the Burton versions, set it in &quot;one of the cities of China&quot;. On the other hand, there is practically nothing in the rest of the story that is inconsistent with a Middle Eastern setting. For instance, the ruler is referred to as &quot;Sultan&quot; rather than &quot;Emperor&quot;, as in some retellings, and the people in the story are Muslims and their conversation is filled with Muslim platitudes. A Jewish merchant buys Aladdin&#x27;s wares, but there is no mention of Buddhists, Daoists or Confucians.

Notably, ethnic groups in Chinese history have long included Muslim groups, including large populations of Uyghurs, and the Hui people as well as the Tajiks whose origins go back to Silk Road travelers. Islamic communities have been known to exist in the region since the Tang dynasty (which rose to power simultaneously with the prophet Muhammad&#x27;s career.) Some have suggested that the intended setting may be Turkestan (encompassing Central Asia and the modern-day Chinese autonomous region of Xinjiang in Western China). The Arabicized Turkic Kara-Khanid Khanate, which was located in this region and had a strong identification with China, bears a strong resemblance to the setting, their rulers even adopting the Arab title of Sultan, even going so far as to adopt the title of &quot;Sultan of the East and China&quot;, which was used alongside Turkic titles such as Khan (title) and Khagan; however, chancellors were referred to as Hajib rather than Vizier.

For all this, speculation about a &quot;real&quot; Chinese setting depends on a knowledge of China that the teller of a folk tale (as opposed to a geographic expert) might well not possess. In early Arabic usage, China is known to have been used in an abstract sense to designate an exotic, faraway land.

==Motifs and variants==
===Tale type===
The story of Aladdin is classified in the Aarne–Thompson–Uther Index as tale type ATU 561, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, after the character. In the Index, the &quot;Aladdin&quot; story is situated next to two similar tale types: ATU 560, &quot;The Magic Ring&quot;, and ATU 562, &quot;The Spirit in the Blue Light&quot;. All of these stories deal with a down-on-his-luck and impoverished boy or soldier, who finds a magical item (ring, lamp, tinderbox) that grants his wishes. In this regard, German folklorist Hans-Jörg Uther, in his revision of the international index, published in 2004, remarked that the similarities between the three tale types make it hard to differentiate them. On the other hand, per Stith Thompson&#x27;s &quot;The Folktale&quot;, in type 561, the magical item is stolen, but eventually recovered thanks to the use of another magical object. Similarly, Czech scholar distinguishes the three types in that, in type 560, the hero is helped by animals (the snake gives the ring and the dog and the cat retrieve the stolen object); type 561 does away with the animals, leaving the hero to recover the stolen lamp with the second object, and, finally, type 562 inserts another person that helps the hero. The ultimate source of the &quot;genie in a container&quot; tales is Homer&#x27;s Iliad, where the god Ares is trapped in a bronze urn and offers to grant Hermes whatever he wants if he is set free.

===Distribution===
Since its appearance in &quot;The One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, the tale has integrated into oral tradition. Scholars Ton Deker and Theo Meder located variants across Europe and the Middle East. In addition, according to scholar Kurt Ranke, in &quot;Enzyklopädie des Märchens&quot;, the &quot;greatest distribution density&quot; occurs in Europe and in the Mediterranean region, with variants also collected in the Middle East (Turkey, Palestine, Iraq, Yemen, Iran), Central Asia (in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan), India (among the Santal people), and in Southeast Asia (Indonesia and the Philippines).

=== Three wishes ===
The version with three wishes have become a popular variant of the tale, popularized in the 20th century in the West.

==Adaptations==
Adaptations vary in their faithfulness to the original story. In particular, difficulties with the Chinese setting are quite often resolved by giving the story a more typical &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; background.

===Books===
* One of the many literary retellings of the tale appears in &quot;A Book of Wizards&quot; (1966) and &quot;A Choice of Magic&quot; (1971), by Ruth Manning-Sanders. Another is the early Penguin version for children, &quot;Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp&quot;, illustrated by John Harwood with many Chinese details; the translator or re-teller is not acknowledged. This was a &quot;Porpoise&quot; imprint printed in 1947 and released in 1948.
* &quot;Aladdin: Master of the Lamp&quot; (1992), edited by Mike Resnick and Martin H. Greenberg, is an anthology containing 43 original short stories inspired by the tale.
* &quot;The Nobility of Faith&quot; by Jonathan Clements, in the anthology &quot;Doctor Who Short Trips: The Ghosts of Christmas&quot; (2007), is a retelling of the Aladdin story in the style of the Arabian Nights, but featuring the Doctor in the role of the genie.

===Comics===
====Western comics====
* In 1962, the Italian branch of Walt Disney Productions published the story &quot;Paperino e la grotta di Aladino&quot; (&quot;Donald and Aladdin&#x27;s Cave&quot;), written by Osvaldo Pavese and drawn by Pier Lorenzo De Vita. As in many pantomimes, the plot is combined with elements of the Ali Baba story: Uncle Scrooge leads Donald Duck and their nephews on an expedition to find the treasure of Aladdin and they encounter the Middle Eastern counterparts of the Beagle Boys. Scrooge describes Aladdin as a brigand who used the legend of the lamp to cover the origins of his ill-gotten gains. They find the cave holding the treasure—blocked by a huge rock requiring a magic password (&quot;open sesame&quot;) to open.
* The original version of the comic book character Green Lantern was partly inspired by the Aladdin myth; the protagonist discovers a &quot;lantern-shaped power source and a &#x27;power ring which gives him the power to create and control matter.
** In the &quot;Elseworlds&quot; series, there was even a story that combined the Green Lantern mythos with that of Aladdin called &quot;Green Lantern: 1001 Emerald Nights&quot;.

====Manga====
* The Japanese manga series &quot;&quot; is not a direct adaptation, but features Aladdin as the main character of the story and includes many characters from other &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; stories. An adaptation of this comic to an anime television series was made in October 2012 in which Aladdin is voiced by Kaori Ishihara in Japanese and Erica Mendez in English.

===Pantomimes===
* In the United Kingdom, the story of Aladdin was dramatised in 1788 by John O&#x27;Keefe for the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden. It has been a popular subject for pantomime for over 200 years.
* The traditional Aladdin pantomime is the source of the well-known pantomime character Widow Twankey (Aladdin&#x27;s mother). In pantomime versions, changes in the setting and story are often made to fit it better into &quot;China&quot; (albeit a China situated in the East End of London rather than medieval Baghdad), and elements of other Arabian Nights tales (in particular Ali Baba) are often introduced into the plot. One version of the &quot;pantomime Aladdin&quot; is Sandy Wilson&#x27;s musical &quot;Aladdin&quot;, from 1979.
* Since the early 1990s, Aladdin pantomimes have tended to be influenced by the Disney animation. For instance, the 2007/8 production at the Birmingham Hippodrome starring John Barrowman featured songs from the Disney movies &quot;Aladdin&quot; and &quot;Mulan&quot;.

* In 1958, a musical comedy version of Aladdin was written especially for U.S. television, with a book by S. J. Perelman and music and lyrics by Cole Porter. A London stage production followed in 1959, in which a 30-year-old Bob Monkhouse played the part of Aladdin at the Coliseum Theatre.

* The 1926 animated film &quot;The Adventures of Prince Achmed&quot; (the earliest surviving animated feature film) combined the story of Aladdin with that of the prince. In this version the princess Aladdin pursues is Achmed&#x27;s sister and the sorcerer is his rival for her hand. The sorcerer steals the castle and the princess through his own magic and then sets a monster to attack Aladdin, from which Achmed rescues him. Achmed then informs Aladdin he requires the lamp to rescue his own intended wife, Princess Pari Banou, from the demons of the Island of Wak Wak. They convince the Witch of the Fiery Mountain to defeat the sorcerer, and then all three heroes join forces to battle the demons.
* &quot;A Thousand and One Nights&quot; is a 1969 Japanese adult anime feature film directed by Eiichi Yamamoto, conceived by Osamu Tezuka. The film is a first part of Mushi Production&#x27;s &quot;Animerama&quot;, a series of films aimed at an adult audience.

* &quot;Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp&quot; (1917), directed by Chester M. Franklin and Sidney A. Franklin and released by the Fox Film Corporation, told the story using child actors. It is the earliest known filmed adaptation of the story.
* The 1940 British movie &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; borrows elements of the Aladdin story, although it also departs from the original story fairly freely: for instance the genie grants only three wishes and the minor character of the Emperor&#x27;s vizier is renamed Jaffar and becomes the main villain, replacing the sorcerer from the original plot.
*&quot;Arabian Nights&quot; is a 1942 adventure film directed by John Rawlins and starring Sabu, Maria Montez, Jon Hall and Leif Erickson. The film is derived from &quot;The Book of One Thousand and One Nights&quot; but owes more to the imagination of Universal Pictures than the original Arabian stories. Unlike other films in the genre (&quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot;), it features no monsters or supernatural elements.

The genie (Vittorio De Sica) can grant only three wishes (although what constitutes as a single wish is quite malleable, probably due to his sympathies with Aladdin) and shrinks with each one, which is leading to his eternal rest after 12,000 years.
* &quot;1001 Nights&quot; (&quot;Les 1001 nuits&quot;), a 1990 French-Italian film with Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stéphane Freiss and Vittorio Gassman, loosely based on Sherazade&#x27;s and Aladdin&#x27;s stories.

<text>Hippolyte Léon Denizard Rivail (; 3 October 1804 – 31 March 1869), known by the pen name of Allan Kardec (), was a French educator, translator, and author. He is the author of the five books known as the Spiritist Codification, and the founder of Spiritism.

==Early life==
Rivail was born in Lyon in 1804 and raised as a Roman Catholic. He pursued interests in philosophy and the sciences, and became an acolyte and colleague of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. Rivail completed a Bachelor of Arts and a doctorate in medicine. He was also fluent in German, English, Italian, and Spanish, in addition to his native French. Kardec became interested in Protestantism after his education in Switzerland. He was also trained in positivist ideas, although he ended up not being an orthodox positivist.

==Career==
He was a member of several scholarly societies, including the Historic Institute of Paris (Institut Historique), Society of Natural Sciences of France (Société des Sciences Naturelles de France), Society for the Encouragement of National Industry (Société d&#x27;Encouragement pour l&#x27;Industrie Nationale), and The Royal Academy of Arras (Académie d&#x27;Arras, Société Royale des Sciences, des Lettres et des Arts). He organized and taught free courses for the underprivileged. He was also involved, from the age of 19, with the controversial hypothesis of animal magnetism, being a practitioner of mesmerism.

===Educator===
Rivail&#x27;s work with Pestalozzi helped lay the foundations for the teaching model in schools in France and Germany. For several decades he helped advance Pestalozzi&#x27;s pedagogy in France, founding schools and working as a teacher, educational writer and translator.

===Banker===

In 1839, with a new partner, Mr. Maurice Delachatre, a merchant, he created a so-called &quot;exchange&quot; bank, which aimed to facilitate commercial transactions and thus create new opportunities for trade and industry, in order to support in default of pecuniary resources for the natural products. The duration of the trading bank was fixed by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry at ten years.

===Spiritualism===

According to “My predictions concerning spiritualism” as he himself described in his manuscript written between 1855 and 1856, &quot;in May 1855, he met a certain Mr. Fortier, a magnetizer, who took him to Madame de Plainemaison, a medium who lived in the Rue de la Grange Bateliere in Paris, just a step away from the Opera House. In the presence of other guests for the session, he entered into communication with a spirit named Zephyr, who gave him the mission of being the spokesman of the Dead. For him, it was a revelation. He was there, for the first time, witnessing the phenomenon of turntables jumping and running&quot;.

==Spiritism==

Rivail was in his early 50s when he became interested in séances, which were a popular entertainment at the time. Strange phenomena attributed to the action of spirits were considered a novelty, featuring objects that moved or &quot;tapped&quot;, purportedly under the control of &quot;spirits&quot;. In some cases, this was alleged to be a type of communication: the supposed spirits answered questions by controlling the movements of objects so as to pick out letters to form words, or simply indicate &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. At the time, Franz Mesmer&#x27;s theory of animal magnetism had become popular. When confronted with the phenomena described, some researchers, including Rivail, pointed out that animal magnetism might explain them. Rivail, however, after seeing a demonstration, dismissed animal magnetism as insufficient to explain his observations.

As a result of these influences, Rivail began his own investigation of psychic phenomena, mainly mediumship. During his initial investigation, he stated that before accepting a spiritual or paranormal cause for some phenomena, it would be necessary first to test if ordinary material causes could explain them. He proposed that fraud, hallucination and unconscious mental activity might explain many phenomena regarded as mediumistic, and also proposed that telepathy and clairvoyance may be responsible.

He compiled over one thousand questions concerning the nature and mechanisms of spirit communications, the reasons for human life on earth, and aspects of the spiritual realm. He asked those questions to ten mediums, all purportedly unknown to each other, and documented their responses. From these, he concluded that the best explanation was that personalities that had survived death were the source of at least some mediumistic communications. He became convinced that the mediums:

* provided accurate information unknown to themselves or others present (e.g. personal information about deceased individuals);
* demonstrated unlearned skills such as writing by illiterate mediums, handwriting similar to the alleged communicating personality, and speaking or writing in a language unknown to the medium (xenoglossy and xenography);
* accurately portrayed a range of personality characteristics of deceased individuals.

He compiled the mediums&#x27; responses that were consistent and adapted them into a philosophy that he called Spiritism, which he initially defined as &quot;a science that deals with the nature, origin, and destiny of spirits, and their relation with the corporeal world.&quot;

Rivail wrote under the name &quot;Allan Kardec&quot;, allegedly following the suggestion of a spirit identified as &quot;Truth&quot;. On 18 April 1857, as Allan Kardec, Rivail published his first book on Spiritism, &quot;The Spirits Book&quot;, comprising a series of answered questions (502 in the first edition and 1,019 in later editions) exploring matters concerning the nature of spirits, the spirit world, and the relationship between the spirit world and the material world. This was followed by a series of other books, including &quot;The Medium&#x27;s Book&quot;, &quot;The Gospel According to Spiritism&quot;, &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; and &quot;The Genesis According to Spiritism&quot;, and by a periodical, the &quot;Revue Spirite&quot;, which Kardec published until his death. Collectively, the books became known as the Spiritist Codification.

Kardec&#x27;s research influenced the psychical research of Charles Richet, Camille Flammarion and Gabriel Delanne.

==Personal life==
===Family===
On 6 February 1832 he married Amélie Gabrielle Boudet.

===Death===

After his death caused by aneurysm in 1869, Kardec was buried at the &quot;Cimetière du Père Lachaise&quot;.

<doc id="166609" wikidata="Q211779" url="?curid=166609" title="Saronic Gulf">
<text>The Saronic Gulf (Greek: Σαρωνικός κόλπος, &quot;Saronikós kólpos&quot;) or Gulf of [[Aegina]] in Greece is formed between the peninsulas of Attica and Argolis and forms part of the Aegean Sea. It defines the eastern side of the isthmus of Corinth, being the eastern terminus of the Corinth Canal, which cuts across the isthmus. The Saronic Islands in the gulf have played a pivotal role in the history of Greece, with the largest, Salamis being the location of a significant naval battle in the Greco-Persian wars. The Megara Gulf makes up the northern end of the Saronic Gulf.

The Athens urban area lies on the north coast of the Saronic Gulf.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the gulf&#x27;s name comes from the mythological king Saron who drowned at the Psifaei lake (modern Psifta). The Saronic Gulf was a string of six entrances to the Underworld, each guarded by a chthonic enemy in the shape of a thief or bandit.

== History ==
The Battle of Salamis, just to the west of modern-day Piraeus, took place in the Saronic Gulf. This naval battle off Salamis Island saw the Athenians defeat Xerxes, assuring Athens its place as the cradle of modern European culture.

The ancient port of Cenchreae used to be situated here.

==Geography==
The gulf includes the islands of Aegina, Salamis, and Poros along with smaller islands of Patroklos and Fleves. The port of Piraeus, Athens&#x27; port, lies on the northeastern edge of the gulf. The site of the former Ellinikon International Airport is also in the northeast.

Beaches line much of the gulf coast from Poros to Epidaurus, Galataki to Kineta and from Megara to Eleusis and from Piraeus down to Anavyssos. Athens&#x27; urban area surrounds the northern and the eastern coasts of this gulf.

Bays in the gulf include Phaleron Bay, Elefsina Bay to the north, Kechries Bay in the northwest and Sofiko Bay in the east.

The volcano of Methana is located to the southwest along with Kromyonia at the Isthmus of Corinth, Aegina and Poros. Methana is also the youngest most active volcano center and forms the northwestern end of the cycladic arch of active volcanoes that includes Milos island, Santorini island and Nisyros island. A hydropathic institute at Methana makes use of the hot sulphurous water that still surfaces in the area. The most recent eruption was of a submarine volcano north of Methana in the 17th century.

The gulf has refineries around the northern part of the gulf including east of Corinth and west of Agioi Theodoroi, Eleusis, Aspropyrgos, Skaramangas and Keratsini. These refineries produce most of Greece&#x27;s refined petroleum products, a large proportion of which are then exported. Commercial shipping to the refineries, Piraeus, and to and from the canal make the gulf quite a busy area with commercial shipping.

Fault lines dominate especially in the northwestern part.

==Sailing==

Sailing is popular in the Saronic Gulf which, like the neighbouring Argolic Gulf, benefits from the Attic mainland&#x27;s partial shelter from the summer Meltemi wind that can reach Force 7 and above further to the east in the Aegean islands.

The Gulf boasts two particularly notable archaeological sites: the ancient theatre at Epidaurus and nearby asclepieion and the Temple of Aphaia on Aegina.

==Other==
The Saronic Gulf is one of congregating areas for short-beaked common dolphins in Aegean Sea. On recent occasions, more of large whales such as fin whales have been sighted in the gulf due to improving environmental conditions.

<text>Micronations, sometimes also referred to as &quot;model countries&quot; and &quot;new country projects&quot;, are small, self-proclaimed entities that assert their sovereignty as independent states but which are not acknowledged as such by any of the recognised sovereign states, or by any supranational organization. They should not be confused with microstates, which are recognised independent states of a small size, nor should they be confused with unrecognised states, which are of more geopolitical significance because they exercise clear control of actual territory to the exclusion of widely recognized countries.

Motivations for the creation of micronations include theoretical experimentation, political protest, artistic expression, personal entertainment and the conduct of criminal activity.

The following is a list of notable micronations.

<text>Ludwig I or Louis I (; 25 August 1786 – 29 February 1868) was King of Bavaria from 1825 until the 1848 revolutions in the German states. When he was crown prince, he was involved in the Napoleonic Wars. As king, he encouraged Bavaria&#x27;s industrialization, initiating the Ludwig Canal between the rivers Main and the Danube. In 1835, the first German railway was constructed in his domain, between the cities of Fürth and Nuremberg, with his Bavaria joining the Zollverein economic union in 1834. After the July Revolution of 1830 in France, Ludwig&#x27;s previous liberal policy became increasingly repressive; in 1844, Ludwig was confronted during the Beer riots in Bavaria. During the revolutions of 1848 the king faced increasing protests and demonstrations by students and the middle classes. On 20 March 1848, he abdicated in favour of his eldest son, Maximilian.

Ludwig lived for another twenty years after his abdication and remained influential. An admirer of ancient Greece and the Italian Renaissance, Ludwig patronized the arts and commissioned several neoclassical buildings, especially in Munich. He was an avid collector of arts, amassing paintings from the Early German and Early Dutch periods as well as Graeco-Roman sculptures.

All living legitimate agnatic members of the House of Wittelsbach descend from him.

==Crown prince==
Born in the Zweibrücker Hof in Straßburg as &quot;Ludwig Karl August von Pfalz-Birkenfeld-Zweibrücken&quot;, he was the son of Count Palatine Maximilian Joseph of Zweibrücken (later Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria) by his first wife Princess Augusta Wilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt. At the time of his birth, his father was an officer in the French Army stationed at Strasbourg. Ludwig was the godson and namesake of Louis XVI of France. 

On 1 April 1795 his father succeeded Ludwig&#x27;s uncle, Charles II, as duke of Zweibrücken, and on 16 February 1799 became Elector of Bavaria and Count Palatine of the Rhine, the Arch-Steward of the Empire, and Duke of Berg on the extinction of the Sulzbach line with the death of the elector Charles Theodore. His father assumed the title of King of Bavaria on 1 January 1806.

Starting in 1803 Ludwig studied in Landshut where he was taught by Johann Michael Sailer and in Göttingen. On 12 October 1810 he married Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen (1792–1854), the daughter of Frederick, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen. The wedding was the occasion of the first-ever Oktoberfest.

Ludwig strongly rejected the alliance of his father with Napoleon I of France but in spite of his anti-French politics the crown prince had to join the emperor&#x27;s wars with allied Bavarian troops in 1806. As commander of the 1st Bavarian Division in VII Corps, he served under Marshal François Joseph Lefebvre in 1809. He led his division in action at the Battle of Abensberg on 20 April.

With the Treaty of Ried of 8 October 1813 Bavaria left the Confederation of the Rhine and agreed to join the Sixth Coalition against Napoleon in exchange for a guarantee of her continued sovereign and independent status. On 14 October, Bavaria made a formal declaration of war against Napoleonic France. The treaty was passionately backed by Crown Prince Ludwig and by Marshal von Wrede.

Already at the 1815 Congress of Vienna, Ludwig advocated a German national policy. Until 1816 the crown prince served as governor-general of the Duchy of Salzburg, whose cession to Austria he strongly opposed. His second son Otto, the later King of Greece, was born there. Between 1816 and 1825, he spent his years in Würzburg. He also made numerous trips to Italy and stayed often in the in Rome, which he later also bought (1827). Ludwig supported generously as a Philhellene the Greek War of Independence, in which he provided a loan of 1.5 million florins from his private funds.

In 1817 Ludwig was also involved in the fall of Prime Minister Count Max Josef von Montgelas whose policies he had opposed. He succeeded his father on the throne in 1825.

==Reign==

Ludwig&#x27;s rule was strongly affected by his enthusiasm for the arts and women and by his overreaching royal assertiveness.

An enthusiast for the German Middle Ages, Ludwig ordered the re-erection of several monasteries in Bavaria which had been closed during the German mediatisation. He reorganized the administrative regions of Bavaria in 1837 and re-introduced the old names Upper Bavaria, Lower Bavaria, Franconia, Swabia, Upper Palatinate and Palatinate. He changed his royal titles to &quot;Ludwig, King of Bavaria, Duke of Franconia, Duke in Swabia and Count Palatine of the Rhine&quot;. His successors kept these titles.

Ludwig&#x27;s plan to reunite the eastern part of the Palatinate with Bavaria could not be realized. The Electoral Palatinate, a former dominion of the Wittelsbach, had disappeared under Napoleon when France first annexed the left bank of the Rhine, including about half of the Palatinate, and then gave what remained on the right bank including, Mannheim and Heidelberg, to Baden during the German Mediatization of 1803. In 1815, Baden&#x27;s possession of Manheim and Heidelberg was confirmed and only the left bank territories were given back to Bavaria. Ludwig founded the city of Ludwigshafen there as a Bavarian rival to Mannheim.

Ludwig moved the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität from Landshut to Munich in 1826. The king also encouraged Bavaria&#x27;s industrialization. He initiated the Ludwig Canal between the rivers Main and the Danube. In 1835 the first German railway was constructed in his domain, between the cities of Fürth and Nuremberg. Bavaria joined the Zollverein in 1834.

As Ludwig had supported the Greek fight of independence his second son Otto was elected king of Greece in 1832. Otto&#x27;s government was initially run by a three-man regency council made up of Bavarian court officials.

After the July Revolution of 1830 in France, Ludwig&#x27;s previous liberal policy became more and more repressive. The Hambacher Fest in 1832 revealed the discontent of the population caused by high taxes and censorship. In connection with the unrest of May 1832, some 142 political trials were initiated. The seven death sentences that were pronounced were commuted to long-term imprisonment by the king. About 1,000 political trials were to take place during Ludwig&#x27;s reign. The strict censorship, which he had reinstated after having abolished it in 1825, was opposed by large sectors of the population.

In 1837 the Ultramontanes backed by the Roman Catholic Church gained control of the Bavarian parliament and began a campaign of changes to the constitution, such as removing civil rights that had earlier been granted to Protestants, as well as enforcing political censorship. On 14 August 1838, the King issued an order for all members of the military to kneel in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament at Corpus Christi processions and church services. The policy, which had been in place when Bavaria was still almost purely Catholic before 1803, had been discontinued after the inclusion of large Protestant areas. Catholic disturbances during the funeral of the Protestant Queen Caroline of Baden in 1841 caused a scandal. This treatment of his beloved stepmother permanently softened the attitude of Caroline&#x27;s stepson Ludwig I, who had been a strong opponent of Protestantism in spite of his marriage to a Protestant princess, Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen. The Ultramontanes&#x27; regime only ended due to their demands against the naturalization of Ludwig I&#x27;s Irish-born mistress Eliza Gilbert (better known by her stage name Lola Montez). Ludwig resented that move, and the Ultramontanes under Karl von Abel were pushed out.
Already in 1844, Ludwig was confronted with the Beer riots in Bavaria. During the revolutions of 1848 the king faced increasing protests and demonstrations by the students and the middle classes. The king had ordered to close the university in February, and on 4 March, a large crowd assaulted the Armory to storm the Munich Residenz. Ludwig&#x27;s brother Prince Karl managed to appease the protesters, but the royal family and the Cabinet now turned against Ludwig. He had to sign the so-called &quot;March Proclamation&quot; with substantial concessions. On 16 March 1848 it was followed by renewed unrest because Lola Montez had returned to Munich after a short exile. Ludwig had to let her be searched by the police on 17 March, which was the worst humiliation for him. Not willing to rule as a constitutional monarch, Ludwig abdicated on 20 March 1848 in favour of his eldest son, Maximilian.

Ludwig lived for another 20 years after his abdication and remained influential, especially as he continued several of his cultural projects. For most of his time in Munich his residence was the neo-Gothic Wittelsbacher Palais, once built for his successor and unloved by Ludwig. He died at Nice in 1868 and was buried in St. Boniface&#x27;s Abbey, Munich, which he had ordered to be built.
==Cultural legacy==

As admirer of ancient Greece and the Italian Renaissance, Ludwig patronized the arts as principal of many neoclassical buildings, especially in Munich, and as fanatic collector. Among others he commissioned the Walhalla temple, the Befreiungshalle, the Villa Ludwigshöhe, the Pompejanum, the Ludwigstraße, the Bavaria statue, the Ruhmeshalle, the Glyptothek, the Old and the New Pinakothek. His architects Leo von Klenze and Friedrich von Gärtner also strongly influenced the cityscape of modern Athens.

Already as crown prince Ludwig collected Early German and Early Dutch paintings, masterpieces of the Italian renaissance, and contemporary art for his museums and galleries. He also placed special emphasis on collecting Greek and Roman sculpture. Through his agents, he managed to acquire such pieces as the Medusa Rondanini, the Barberini Faun, and, in 1813, the figures from the Temple of Aphaea on Aegina. One of his most famous conceptions is the celebrated &quot;Schönheitengalerie&quot; (Gallery of Beauties), in the south pavilion of his Nymphenburg Palace in Munich. A collection of 36 portraits of the beautiful women painted between 1827 and 1850 mostly by Joseph Karl Stieler.

Also after his abdication, Ludwig remained an important and lavish sponsor for the arts. This caused several conflicts with his son and successor Maximilian. Finally, Ludwig financed his projects from his own resources.
Because of King Ludwig&#x27;s philhellenism, the German name for Bavaria today is spelled &quot;Bayern&quot; instead of &quot;Baiern&quot;, while the German dialect spoken there has retained its original spelling &quot;Bairisch&quot;—note the &quot;I&quot; versus the Greek-derived &quot;Y.&quot;

Ludwig was an eccentric and notoriously bad poet. He would write about anything, no matter how trivial, with strings of rhyming couplets. For this, the king was teased by Heinrich Heine who wrote several mocking poems in Ludwig&#x27;s style. Ironically, Ludwig&#x27;s Walhalla temple added Heine&#x27;s bust to its collection in 2009.

==Private life and issue==
In private life Ludwig was, in spite of his royal assertiveness, modest and companionable and was even known for his often shabby attire. Ludwig was hard of hearing and had a birthmark on his forehead which was often concealed in portraits.

Ludwig had several extramarital affairs and was one of the lovers of Jane Digby, an aristocratic English adventuress. Another affair was the Italian noblewoman Marianna Florenzi. His affair with Lola Montez also caused some scandal. 

In 1866, when Queen Emma of Hawaii was visiting Nice, Ludwig proposed marriage to the recently widowed dowager queen who was 49 years his junior. She refused the marriage proposal, writing to her mother: “I met with the King of Bavaria today. He is old and feeble. And he asked me to marry him. I refused saying I will not be marrying.”

<doc id="166613" wikidata="Q356804" url="?curid=166613" title="George Crumb">
<text>George Henry Crumb Jr. (24 October 1929 – 6 February 2022) was an American composer of avant-garde contemporary classical music. Early in his life he rejected the widespread modernist usage of serialism, developing a highly personal musical language which &quot;range[s] in mood from peaceful to nightmarish&quot;. Crumb&#x27;s compositions are known for pushing the limits of technical prowess by way of frequent use of extended techniques. The unusual timbres he employs evoke a surrealist atmosphere which portray emotions of considerable intensity with vast and sometimes haunting soundscapes. His few large-scale works include &quot;Echoes of Time and the River&quot; (1967), which won the 1968 Pulitzer Prize for Music, and &quot;Star-Child&quot; (1977), which won the 2001 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Classical Composition; however, his output consists of mostly music for chamber ensembles or solo instrumentalists. Among his best known compositions are &quot;Black Angels&quot; (1970), a striking commentary on the Vietnam War for electric string quartet; &quot;Ancient Voices of Children&quot; (1970) for a mixed chamber ensemble; and &quot;Vox Balaenae&quot; (1971), a musical evocation of the humpback whale, for electric flute, electric cello, and amplified piano.

Born to a musical family, Crumb was acquainted with classical music at an early age and his affinity for Classical and Romantic composers in particular would stay throughout his life. He was especially influenced by composers such as Mahler, Debussy and Bartók; Crumb wrote his four-volume piano set &quot;Makrokosmos&quot; (1972–1979) in response to Bartók&#x27;s earlier piano set &quot;Mikrokosmos&quot;. His compositions often contain musical quotations from wide range of composers including Bach, Chopin, Schubert, Strauss, and the jazz pianist and composer Thelonious Monk. The use of pastiche is also found in his music, as is text by Federico García Lorca, whose poetry Crumb set eleven times. Elements of theatricality appear in numerous compositions, inspiring choreographies from contemporary dance groups. To convey his unorthodox and complex musical style, Crumb&#x27;s musical scores are facsimile manuscripts, using special notation &quot;distinguished by astonishing clarity, precision and elegance, and by arresting graphic symbols in which staves are bent into arches, circles and other pictorial devices.&quot; Among his students were the composers Osvaldo Golijov, Jennifer Higdon, Christopher Rouse and Melinda Wagner.
==Life and career==
===Upbringing and education (1929–1959)===
George Henry Crumb Jr. was born in Charleston, West Virginia on 24 October 1929 to a musical family and he grew up playing chamber music with them. Both of Crumb&#x27;s parents played in the Charleston Symphony Orchestra (CSO); his father George Henry Crumb Sr. was a clarinetist while his mother Vivian (née Reed) was a cellist. The elder Crumb was a multifaceted musician, with activities that included conducting theatre orchestra for the music of silent film, teaching clarinet privately and at the Mason College, and working as both a music copyist and arranger. George, Jr. began to compose at an early age and had two of his orchestral works performed by the Charleston Symphony Orchestra while he was still in his teens. In 1947 he studied at the National Music Camp in Interlochen, Michigan. He majored in music at the Mason College of Music and Fine Arts (subsequently subsumed into the University of Charleston), where he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1950. He obtained his M.Mus. at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 1952 and then briefly studied as a Fulbright fellow at the Hochschule für Musik in Berlin before returning to the United States to study at the University of Michigan, from which he received a D.M.A. in 1959.

===Teaching and early works (1960s – early 1970s) ===
He earned his living primarily from teaching. His first teaching job was at a college in Virginia, before he became professor of piano and composition at the University of Colorado in 1958. It was here that he met the pianist David Burge, who asked Crumb to compose a piece for him. While creating this, Crumb woke up in a cold sweat one night, realising that thus far he had simply been rewriting the works of other composers. From here on he began experimenting with new, avant-garde techniques.

In 1965 he began a long association with the University of Pennsylvania, becoming Annenberg Professor of the Humanities in 1983.

From the 1960s on, Crumb&#x27;s music filled a niche for sophisticated—though still conservative—concertgoers. His music fell between neoclassicism, which was perceived as outmoded, and the more radical music of the avant garde. Although his music from this period exhibits some novel features, it owes more to traditional techniques than to the more experimental areas of the avant-garde.

In this period, Crumb shared with a number of other young composers regarded as being under the umbrella of &quot;new accessibility&quot; a desire to reach out to alienated audiences. In works like &quot;Ancient Voices of Children&quot; (1970), Crumb employed theatrical ritual, using evocative masks, costumes, and sonorities. In other pieces he asks players to leave and enter the stage during the piece, and has also used unusual layouts of musical notation in a number of his scores. In several pieces, the music is symbolically laid out in a circular or spiral fashion.

Several of Crumb&#x27;s works, including the four books of madrigals he wrote in the late 1960s and &quot;Ancient Voices of Children&quot;, a song cycle for two singers and small instrumental ensemble—including a toy piano (1970), are settings of texts by Federico García Lorca. Many of his vocal works were written for the virtuoso mezzo-soprano singer Jan DeGaetani.

&quot;Black Angels (Thirteen Images from the Darkland)&quot; was written in 1970, and published in 1971, in protest against the Vietnam War, using spoken word, bowed water glasses and electronics. It also explores a wide range of timbres, such as an electric string quartet, with its players required to play various percussion instruments and to bow small goblets as well as to play their instruments in both conventional and unconventional ways. It is one of Crumb&#x27;s best known pieces, and has been recorded by several groups, including the Kronos Quartet, whose formation was inspired when violinist David Harrington first heard &quot;Black Angels&quot;.

=== &quot;Makrokosmos&quot; (1972–1979) ===
Crumb&#x27;s most ambitious work, and among his more famous, is the 24-piece collection &quot;Makrokosmos&quot;, published in four books. The first two books (1972, 1973), for solo piano, make extensive use of string piano techniques and require amplification, as dynamics range from to . The third book, known as &quot;Music for a Summer Evening&quot; (1974), is for two pianos and percussion. The fourth book, &quot;Celestial Mechanics&quot; (1979), is for piano four-hands.

The title &quot;Makrokosmos&quot; alludes to &quot;Mikrokosmos&quot;, the six books of piano pieces by Béla Bartók. Like Bartók&#x27;s work, &quot;Makrokosmos&quot; is a series of short character pieces. Apart from Bartók, Claude Debussy is another composer Crumb acknowledged as an influence here: Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Préludes&quot; comprise two books of 12 character pieces. Crumb&#x27;s first two books of &quot;Makrokosmos&quot; for solo piano contain 12 pieces, each bearing a dedication (a friend&#x27;s initials, however he also wittily dedicates a piece to himself) at the end. On several occasions, the pianist is required to sing, shout, whistle, whisper, and moan, as well as play the instrument unconventionally. &quot;Makrokosmos&quot; was premiered by David Burge, who later recorded the work.

=== 1980s – early 2000s ===
During the 1980s and 1990s, Crumb&#x27;s musical output was less prolific. Beginning in 2000 Crumb wrote a number of works subtitled &quot;American Songbook&quot;. Each of these works is a set of arrangements of American hymns, spirituals, and popular tunes: Crumb originally planned to produce four such volumes, but in fact he continued to produce additional sets after the fourth (&quot;The Winds of Destiny&quot;) was written, with the seventh volume of the series (&quot;Voices from the Heartland&quot;) completed in 2010. Typically these settings preserve the familiar tunes more-or-less intact, but the accompaniments for amplified piano and percussionists use a very wide range of musical techniques and exotic sounds. As of 2017, &quot;American Songbook&quot; totalled 65 movements, 62 texts, 150 percussion instruments, more than five hours of music.

Crumb retired from teaching in 1995, though in early 2002 he was appointed with David Burge to a joint residency at Arizona State University. He continued to compose.

===Personal life and death===
Crumb&#x27;s son David is also a composer and, since 1997, assistant professor at the University of Oregon. George Crumb&#x27;s daughter, Ann, was an actress and singer. She recorded his &quot;Three Early Songs&quot; for the CD &quot;George Crumb 70th Birthday Album&quot; (1999), and had also performed his &quot;Unto the Hills&quot; (2001). She died at her parents&#x27; home on 31 October 2019.

In his later compositions, which have the subtitle &quot;Spanish Songbook&quot;, Crumb returned to settings of Lorca. Crumb died in his home in Media, Pennsylvania, on 6 February 2022, at the age of 92.

==Music==
===Overview===
After initially being influenced by Anton Webern, Crumb became interested in exploring unusual timbres, something he considered as important as rhythm, harmony, and counterpoint. He often asks for instruments to be played in unusual ways and several of his pieces, although written for standard chamber music ensembles, such as &quot;Black Angels&quot; (string quartet) or &quot;Ancient Voices of Children&quot; (mixed ensemble), call for electronic amplification. Crumb defines music as &quot;a system of proportions in the service of spiritual impulse.&quot; Musicologist Richard Taruskin said of Crumb&#x27;s music: &quot;The ingredients in Crumb’s collages were chosen not as representatives of styles but as expressive symbols of timeless content.&quot;

In 1980, Crumb wrote an essay for &quot;The Kenyon Review&quot; titled, &quot;Music: Does It Have a Future?&quot; In it, he codified his worldview of unified culture and music, arguing that, &quot;the total musical culture of Planet Earth is ‘coming together,’ as it were. An American or European composer, for example, now has access to the music of various Asian, African, and South American cultures. […] This awareness of music in its largest sense—as a worldwide phenomenon—will inevitably have enormous consequences for the music of the future.” Of this worldview, which Crumb noted he still followed 37 years later in a 2017 interview for &quot;VAN Magazine,&quot; William Dougherty wrote: &quot;Wherever one stands on the ethics of appropriation, it’s undeniable that Crumb, by incorporating in his work sounds from other cultures, succeeded in finding a timbrally rich sound world unlike any of his contemporaries.&quot; Of his legacy, Michael Schell said &quot;on the morning of his death Crumb was arguably the most important living composer of piano music, and the last giant in a distinctively American line of innovative percussion writers.&quot;. Mark Swed said &quot;Crumb may not have been well known outside of new-music circles, but he mattered beyond those perimeters.&quot;

Crumb&#x27;s works were published by the Edition Peters. Recordings of Crumb&#x27;s music have appeared on many labels, including several LPs issued by Nonesuch Records in the 1970s. More recently, Bridge Records has issued a series of CDs, the Complete Crumb Edition.

<doc id="166614" wikidata="Q2236203" url="?curid=166614" title="Military history of Japan">
<text>The military history of Japan covers a vast time-period of over three millennia - from the Jōmon ( 1000 BC) to the present day. After a long period of clan warfare until the 12th century, there followed feudal wars that culminated in military governments known as the Shogunate. History of Japan records that a military class and the Shōgun ruled Japan for 676 years - from 1192 until 1868. The Shōgun and the samurai warriors stood near the apex of the Japanese social structure - only the aristocratic nobility nominally outranked them. The sakoku policy effectively closed Japan from foreign influences for 212 years - from 1641 to 1853. Feudal militarism transitioned to imperialism in the 19th century after the arrival of U.S. Admiral Matthew C. Perry in 1853 and the elevation of Emperor Meiji in 1868. Western colonial powers and their imperialist policies impacted on Japan&#x27;s outlook and led to Japanese colonialism and rampant imperialism ( 1895 - 1945) until Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II. The 1947 Japanese Constitution prohibits Japan from offensively using war against other nations. This led to the establishment of the Japan Self-Defense Forces in 1954. The U.S.–Japan Alliance (1951 onwards) requires the United States to protect Japan and to conduct offensive duties. In 2015, the Japanese government voted to reinterpret the constitution to allow collective self-defense of Japan&#x27;s allies.

As of 1954 the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) consist of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF), Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) and Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF). The Prime Minister is the commander-in-chief of the Japan Self-Defense Forces. Military authority runs from the Prime Minister to the cabinet-level Minister of Defense of the Japanese Ministry of Defense. The Prime Minister and Minister of Defense are advised by the Chief of Staff, Joint Staff, who heads the . The Chief of Staff, Joint Staff, is the highest-ranking military officer in the Japan Self-Defense Forces, and is the head of the Operational Authority over the JSDF, executing orders of the Minister of Defense with directions from the Prime Minister.

==Prehistoric and Ancient Japan==
===Jōmon period (14,000–1000 BC)===
The Jōmon period is the time in Japanese prehistory between  14,000 and 1000 BC during which the Japanese archipelago was inhabited by the Jōmon, a hunter-gatherer culture that reached a considerable degree of sedentism and cultural complexity. The name &quot;cord-marked&quot; was first applied by the American scholar Edward S. Morse, who discovered sherds of pottery in 1877 and subsequently translated it into Japanese as &quot;jōmon&quot;. The pottery style characteristic of the first phases of Jōmon culture was decorated by impressing cords into the surface of wet clay and is generally accepted to be among the oldest in East Asia and the world.

Near the end of the Jōmon period (), villages and towns became surrounded by moats and wooden fences due to increasing violence within or between communities. Battles were fought with weapons like the sword, sling, spear, bow and arrow. Some human remains were found with arrow wounds.

===Yayoi period (1000 BC – 300 AD)===
The Yayoi period is the Iron Age era of Japan from 1000 BC to 300 AD. Japan transitioned to a settled agricultural society. There was a big influx of farmers from the Asian continent to Japan. The Yayoi culture flourished from southern Kyūshū to northern Honshū. The rapid increase of roughly four million people in Japan between the Jōmon and Yayoi periods are partially due to migration and due to a shift from a hunter-gatherer to an agricultural diet with the introduction of rice cultivation.

Bronze goods and bronze-making techniques from the Asian mainland reached the Japanese archipelago as early as the 3rd century BC. It is believed that bronze and, later, iron implements and weapons were introduced to Japan near the end of this time (and well into the early Yamato period). Archaeological findings suggest that bronze and iron weapons were not used for war until later, starting at the beginning of the Yamato period, as the metal weapons found with human remains do not show wear consistent with use as weapons. The transition from the Jōmon to Yayoi, and later to the Yamato period, is likely to have been characterized by violent struggle as the natives were displaced and assimilated by the invaders with their vastly superior military technology. The most well-regarded theory is that present-day Yamato Japanese are descendants of both the Indigenous Jōmon people and the immigrant Yayoi people.

Around this time, San Guo Zhi first referred to the nation of &quot;Wa&quot;. According to this work, Wa was &quot;divided into more than 100 tribes&quot;, and for some 70 or 80 years there were many disturbances and wars. About 30 communities had been united by a sorceress-queen named Himiko. She sent an emissary named Nashime (, Nashonmi in Chinese) with a tribute of slaves and cloth to Daifang in China, establishing diplomatic relations with Cao Wei (the Chinese kingdom of Wei).

==Classical Japan==

By the end of the 4th century, the Yamato clan was well established on the Nara plain with considerable control over the surrounding areas. The Five kings of Wa sent envoys to China to recognize their dominion of the Japanese Islands. The Nihon Shoki states that the Yamato were strong enough to have sent an army against the powerful northern Korean state of Goguryeo (of the Three Kingdoms of Korea). Yamato Japan had close relations with the southwestern Korean kingdom of Baekje. In 663, Japan, supporting Baekje, was defeated by the allied forces of Tang China and the southeastern Korean kingdom of Silla, at the Battle of Hakusonko in the Korean peninsula. As a result, the Japanese were banished from the peninsula. To defend the Japanese archipelago, a military base was constructed in Dazaifu, Fukuoka, on Kyushu.

===Yamato period (250–710 AD)===
This period is divided into the Kofun and Asuka period. Ancient Japan had close ties with the Gaya confederacy and Baekje on the Korean Peninsula. Gaya, where there was an abundance of naturally occurring iron, exported abundant quantities of iron armor and weapons to Wa, and there may have even been a Japanese military post there with Gaya and Baekje cooperation..

In 552, the ruler of Baekje appealed to Yamato for help against its enemies, the neighboring Silla. Along with his emissaries to the Yamato court, the Baekje king sent bronze images of Buddha, some Buddhist scriptures, and a letter praising Buddhism. These gifts triggered a powerful burst of interest in Buddhism.

In 663, near the end of the Korean Three Kingdoms period, the Battle of Baekgang (白村江) took place. The &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; records that Yamato sent 32,000 troops and 1,000 ships to support Baekje against the Silla-Tang force. However, these ships were intercepted and defeated by a Silla-Tang fleet. Baekje, without aid and surrounded by Silla and Tang forces on land, collapsed. Silla, now viewing Wa Japan as a hostile rival, prevented Japan from having any further meaningful contact with the Korean Peninsula until a far later time. The Japanese then turned directly to China.

===Nara period (710–794 AD)===
In many ways, the Nara period was the beginning of Japanese culture as we know it today. It was in this period that Buddhism, the Chinese writing system, and a codified system of laws made their appearance. The country was unified and centralized, with basic features of the later feudal system. Succession disputes were widespread during this period, just as in most of the later periods.

Much of the discipline, weapons, and armor of the samurai came to be during this period, as techniques of mounted archery, swordsmanship, and spear fighting were adopted and developed.

The Nara period saw the appointment of the first &quot;Sei-i Tai-shōgun&quot;, Ōtomo no Otomaro by the Emperor in 794 CE. The shōgun was the military dictator of Japan with near absolute power over territories via the military. Ōtomo was declared &quot;Sei-i Taishōgun&quot; which means &quot;Barbarian-subduing Great General&quot;. Emperor Kanmu granted the second title of Sei-i Tai-shōgun to Sakanoue no Tamuramaro for subduing the Emishi in northern Honshu.

===Heian period (794–1185 AD)===


The Heian Period marks a crucial shift, away from a state that was united in relative peace against outside threats to one that did not fear invasion and, instead, focused on internal division and clashes between ruling factions of samurai clans, over political power and control of the line of succession to the Chrysanthemum Throne.

With the exception of the Mongol invasions of the 13th century, Japan did not face a considerable outside threat until the arrival of Europeans in the 16th century. Thus, pre-modern Japanese military history is largely defined not by wars with other states, but by internal conflicts. The tactics of the samurai of this period involved archery and swordsmanship. Nearly all duels and battles began with an exchange of arrow fire and then hand-to-hand combat with swords and daggers.

The Imperial family struggled against the control of the Fujiwara clan, which almost exclusively monopolized the post of regent (Sesshō and Kampaku). Feudal conflicts over land, political power, and influence eventually reached its apex in the Genpei War (1180–1185). This was a national civil war between the two most powerful clans: the Taira and Minamoto clans. They fought for control over the declining Imperial Court in Kyoto. Each side had a large number of smaller allied clans. The Battle of Dan-no-Ura was a major naval battle between these clans on April 25, 1185. Minamoto had a fleet of 300 ships and Taira had 400 to 500 ships. It resulted in a decisive victory for the Minamoto clan and the destruction of the Taira clan. The end of the Genpei War brought the end of the Heian period and the beginning of the Kamakura period.


==Feudal Japan==
This period is marked by the departure from relatively small or medium-sized clan-like battles, to massive clashes of clans over the control of Japan. The establishment of the Kamakura shogunate coincided with the ascendancy of the samurai class over the aristocratic nobility of the Imperial Court. The Shogunates were military governments and de facto rulers of Japan. They dominated Japanese politics for nearly seven hundred years (1185–1868), subverting the power of the Emperor as a figurehead and the Imperial Court in Kyoto.

In the Kamakura period, Japan successfully repulsed the Mongol invasions, and this saw a large growth in the size of military forces, with samurai as an elite force and as commanders. Following roughly fifty years of bitter fighting over control of the Imperial succession, the Muromachi period, under the Ashikaga shogunate, saw a brief period of peace as the power of the traditional systems of administration by the Imperial Court gradually declined. Later, the position of the provincial governors and other officials under the shogunate slowly gave way into a new class of &quot;daimyōs&quot; (feudal lords) in the early 11th century. The Daimyō were protected by samurai and they dominated Japan&#x27;s internal politics. This brought the Japanese archipelago into a period of 150 years of fractious disunity and war.

===Kamakura period (1185–1333)===

Before the establishment of the Kamakura shogunate, civil power in Japan was primarily held by the ruling emperors and their regents. The regents were typically appointed from the ranks of the imperial court and the aristocratic clans that vied there. Military affairs were handled under the auspices of the civil government. After defeating their main rival the Taira clan, and the Northern Fujiwara, the Minamoto clan established the Kamakura shogunate. Minamoto no Yoritomo seized power from the central government and the aristocracy and established a feudal system based in Kamakura. The samurai gained political power over the aristocratic nobility (&quot;kuge&quot;) of the Imperial Court in Kyoto. Emperor Go-Toba and the aristocracy remained the &quot;de jure&quot; rulers. In 1192, Yoritomo was awarded the title of &quot;Sei-i Taishōgun&quot; by Emperor Go-Toba. The political system that Yoritomo developed with a succession of &quot;shōguns&quot; as the heads of the shogunate became known. This brought a period of peace. The battles fought during this period mainly consisted of agents of the Minamoto suppressing rebellions. Yoritomo&#x27;s wife&#x27;s family, the Hōjō, seized power from the Kamakura &quot;shōguns&quot;. When Yoritomo&#x27;s sons and heirs were assassinated, the &quot;shōgun&quot; himself became a hereditary figurehead. Real power rested with the Hōjō regents. The Kamakura shogunate lasted for almost 150 years, from 1192 to 1333. The Mongol invasions of Japan (1274 and 1281) were the most important wars of the Kamakura period and defining events in Japanese history.

Japan&#x27;s remote location makes it secure against invaders from the Asian continent. The Japanese archipelago is surrounded by vast seas and has rugged, mountainous terrain with steep rivers. Kyushu is closest to the southernmost point of the Korean peninsula with a distance of . That&#x27;s almost 6 times farther away than from England to France . Throughout history, Japan was never fully invaded nor colonized by foreigners. Japan only surrendered once after World War II.

, is recognized as Japan&#x27;s greatest swordsmith. He created the finest swords and daggers (called tachi and tantō), in the &quot;Soshu&quot; tradition.

====First Mongol Invasion (1274)====
In the 13th century, the Mongols conquered and controlled China under the Yuan dynasty. Subsequently, they attempted to invade Japan twice. In early October 1274, the Battle of Bun&#x27;ei began with a combined force of Mongols and Koreans. They arrived on ships and seized the Japanese islands Tsushima, Iki island, Hirato island, Taka and Nokono. The Mongols slaughtered the inhabitants of Tsushima and about 1000 Japanese soldiers were killed on Iki island. When the Mongols arrived on Japan&#x27;s mainland of Kyushu they encountered the first real Japanese army. During the Battle of Akasaka the Japanese won with a surprise attack by the forces of Kikuchi Takefusa. The second victory was at the Battle of Torikai-Gata where the samurai of Takezaki Suenaga and Shiraishi Michiyasu killed 3,500 Mongols. The Mongol army and Hong Dagu withdrew to their ships towards the Yuan Dynasty. The Japanese army conducted night attacks and killed as many soldiers as they could. On the night of October 19, a typhoon caused one-third of their returning ships to sink and many Mongol soldiers drowned. This typhoon was called the Kamikaze which means &quot;divinely conjured wind&quot;.

====Second Mongol Invasion (1281)====

The Kamakura shogunate anticipated a second invasion so they constructed walls and fortresses along the shore and gathered forces to defend it. In the spring of 1281, Kublai Khan sent two separate forces. An impressive 900 ships containing 40,000 Yuan troops set out from Masan, Korea, while an even larger force of 100,000 sailed from southern China in 3,500 ships. The Mongols planned an overwhelming coordinated attack by the combined imperial Yuan fleets. The Chinese fleet of the Yuan was delayed by difficulties in provisioning and manning their large number of ships.

This culminated in the Battle of Kōan. The Eastern Route Army arrived at Hakata Bay in Kyushu on June 21, 1281. They proceeded without the larger southern force. Waves of samurai responded and prevented the Mongols from forming a beachhead. The samurai used a harassment tactic by boarding the Yuan ships with small boats at night. They killed many of the Yuan forces in the bay and the samurai left before dawn. This caused the Yuan to retreat to Tsushima. During the next few weeks up to 3000 Yuan were killed in close quarters. On July 16, the first of the Southern force ships arrived. By August 12, the two fleets were ready to attack Japan. However, on August 15 a major typhoon (kamikaze) struck the Tsushima Strait. It lasted two full days and destroyed most of the Yuan fleet. Over 4,000 ships were destroyed in the storm; 80 percent of the Yuan soldiers drowned or were killed by samurai on the beaches. The loss of ships was so great that &quot;a person could walk across from one point of land to another on a mass of wreckage&quot;.

The equipment, tactics, and military attitudes of the samurai and their Mongol opponents differed greatly, and while both invasions failed miserably, their impact on developments and changes in samurai battle were quite significant. The samurai remained attached to ideas of single combat, that of honorable battle between individual warriors, and to certain ritual elements of battle, such as a series of archery exchanges conducted before entering into hand-to-hand fighting. The Mongols, of course, knew nothing of Japanese conventions, and were arguably much more organized in their strike tactics. They did not select individual opponents with whom to conduct honorable duels, but rode forth on horseback, with various forms of gunpowder weapons and the famous Mongol bow, charging into enemy lines and killing as many as they could without regard to Japanese conceptions of protocol. Though archery and mounted combat were central to Japanese warfare at this time as well, the Mongols remain famous even today for their prowess in these matters. The ways that samurai tactics and attitudes were affected by these experiences are difficult to ascertain, but they were certainly significant.

====Kusunoki Masashige====
One of the greatest samurai was Kusunoki Masashige. He lived during the Kamakura period and represents the ideal of samurai loyalty. Kusunoki fought against the Kamakura shogunate in the Genkō War (1331–1333) to restore power to Emperor Go-Daigo. Kusunoki was also a brilliant tactician and strategist. The defense of two key Loyalist fortresses at Akasaka, the Siege of Akasaka, and Chihaya, the Siege of Chihaya, helped enable Emperor Go-Daigo to briefly regain power. In 1333, Go-Daigo rewarded Kusunoki with governorship of Settsu Province and Kawachi Province. The Meiji government posthumously gave Kusunoki the highest decoration of Senior First Rank in 1880. Kusunoki &quot;stands in the history of his country as the ideal figure of a warrior, compact of civil and military virtues in a high degree&quot;.

===Muromachi period (1336–1467)===
The shogunate fell in the wake of the 1331 Genkō War, an uprising against the shogunate organized by the Emperor Go-Daigo. After a brief period under true Imperial rule, the Ashikaga shogunate was established in 1336, and a series of conflicts known as the Nanboku-chō wars began. For over fifty years, the archipelago became embroiled in disputes over control of Imperial succession, and thus over the country.

Battles grew larger in this period, and were less ritualized. Though single combats and other elements of ritual and honorable battle remained, organized strategies and tactics under military commanders began to emerge, along with a greater degree of organization of formations and divisions within armies. It was in this period, as well, that weaponsmithing techniques emerged, creating so-called &quot;Japanese steel&quot; blades, prone to breaking yet extremely precise and sharp. The katana, and myriad similar or related blade weapons, appeared at this time and would dominate Japanese arms, relatively unchanged, through the mid-20th century. As a result, it was also during this period that the shift of samurai from being archers to swordsmen began in a significant way .

===Sengoku period (1467–1603)===


The Sengoku Period is marked by social upheaval, political intrigue and near-constant military conflict. Less than a century after the end of the Nanboku-chō Wars, peace under the relatively weak Ashikaga shogunate was disrupted by the outbreak of the Ōnin War (1467–1477). This was a civil war between the Ashikaga shogunate and numerous daimyō. The ancient capital of Kyoto was converted into a battlefield and a heavily fortified city that suffered severe destruction.

The authority of both the shogunate and the Imperial Court had weakened, and provincial Governors (&quot;shugo&quot;) and other local samurai leaders emerged as the &quot;daimyōs&quot;, who battled each other, religious factions (e.g. the Ikkō-ikki), and others for land and power for the next 150 years or so. The period has come to be called the Sengoku period, after the Warring States period in ancient Chinese history. Over one hundred domains clashed and warred throughout the archipelago, as clans rose and fell, boundaries shifted, and some of the largest battles in all of global pre-modern history were fought.

A great many developments and significant events took place during this period, ranging from advances in castle design to the advent of the cavalry charge, the further development of campaign strategies on a grand scale, and the significant changes brought on by the introduction of firearms. The composition of the army changed, with masses of &quot;ashigaru&quot;, footsoldiers armed with long lances (&quot;yari&quot;), archers, and, later, gunners serving alongside mounted samurai. Naval battles likewise consisted of little more than using boats to move troops within range of bow or arquebus, and then into hand-to-hand fighting.

The long-standing rivalry between the daimyo Takeda Shingen of Kai Province and Uesugi Kenshin of Echigo Province are legendary. The Battles of Kawanakajima between the armies of Shingen and Kenshin (1553–1564) are one of the most cherished tales in Japanese military history and the epitome of Japanese chivalry and romance. They&#x27;re mentioned in epic literature, woodblock printing and movies.

In the first conflict between Shingen and Kenshin they were very cautious, only committing themselves to indecisive skirmishes. There were a total of five engagements at Kawanakajima. Only the fourth battle was a serious, all-out battle between the two. During the fourth battle, Kenshin&#x27;s forces cleared a path through the Takeda troops and Kenshin engaged Shingen in single combat. Kenshin attacked Shingen with his sword while Shingen defended with his Japanese war fan (tessen). Both lords lost many men in this fight, and Shingen in particular lost two of his main generals, Yamamoto Kansuke and his younger brother Takeda Nobushige. After the death of Shingen, Tokugawa Ieyasu borrowed heavily from Shingen&#x27;s governmental and military innovations after he had taken leadership of Kai Province during Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s rise to power. Many of these designs were used by the Tokugawa shogunate.

The Hōjō clan, in and around the Kantō region, were among the first to establish networks of satellite castles, and the complex use of these castles both for mutual defense and coordinated attacks. The Takeda, under Takeda Shingen, developed the Japanese equivalent of the cavalry charge. Though debate continues today as to the force of his charges, and the appropriateness of comparing them to Western cavalry charges, it is evident from contemporary sources that it was a revolutionary development, and powerful against defenders unused to it. The Battles of the Sengoku period of particular interest or significance are too numerous to list here. Suffice to say this period saw a myriad of strategic and tactical developments, and some of the longest sieges and largest battles in the history of the early modern world.

====Azuchi–Momoyama period (1568–1600)====

This was the final phase of the Sengoku period. It&#x27;s named for the increasingly important castle-cities, is marked by the introduction of firearms, after contact with the Portuguese, and a further push towards all-out battle, away from individual combats and concepts of personal honor and bravery.

The arquebus was introduced to Japan in 1543, by Portuguese on board a Chinese ship that crashed upon the tiny island of Tanegashima in the southernmost parts of the Japanese archipelago. Though the weapon&#x27;s introduction was not seen to have particularly dramatic effects for several decades, by the 1560s thousands of gunpowder weapons were in use in Japan, and began to have revolutionary effects upon Japanese tactics, strategy, army compositions, and castle architecture.

The 1575 Battle of Nagashino, in which about 3,000 arquebusiers led by Oda Nobunaga cut down charging ranks of thousands of samurai, remains one of the chief examples of the effect of these weapons. Highly inaccurate, and taking a long time to reload, arquebusses, or &quot;hinawa-jū&quot; () as they are called in Japanese, did not win battles on their own. Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and other commanders developed tactics that honed arquebus use to the greatest advantage. At Nagashino, Nobunaga&#x27;s gunners hid behind wooden barricades, embedded with large wooden spikes to ward off cavalry, and took turns firing volleys and reloading.


As in Europe, the debilitating effects of wet (and therefore largely useless) gunpowder were decisive in a number of battles. But, one of the key advantages of the weapon was that unlike bows, which required years of training largely available only to the samurai class, guns could be used by relatively untrained footmen. Samurai stuck to their swords and their bows, engaging in cavalry or infantry tactics, while the &quot;ashigaru&quot; wielded the guns. Some militant Buddhist factions began to produce firearms in foundries normally employed to make bronze temple bells. In this manner, the Ikkō-ikki, a group of monks and lay religious zealots, turned their Ishiyama Honganji cathedral-fortress into some of the most well-defended fortresses in the country. The &quot;ikki&quot; and a handful of other militant religious factions thus became powers unto themselves, and fought fierce battles against some of the chief generals and samurai clans of the archipelago.

Though civil strife continued to rage as it had for the previous century, the battles growing larger and more tactically complex, it was at this time that the many &quot;warring states&quot; began to be united. There were 3 powerful daimyō who unified the Japanese archipelago. In the second half of the 16th century, Japan was first fully unified by daimyō Oda Nobunaga and then by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The third daimyō who unified Japan was Tokugawa Ieyasu after the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. This resulted in 268 years of uninterrupted rule by the Tokugawa clan.

With an ambition to conquer China&#x27;s Ming Dynasty, Toyotomi Hideyoshi requested passage through the Korean peninsula from the King of Joseon. Upon being refused, Hideyoshi launched invasions of Korea with an army of 158,800 soldiers between 1592 and 1598. The Japanese army quickly captured several major cities from the unprepared Joseon kingdom including the capital, causing the king to retreat and request military aid from China. With the arrival of the Chinese army, the joint Chinese-Korean troops pushed the Japanese army down to the southeast of the Korean peninsula where a military stalemate was established by 1594. Concurrently, the &quot;Righteous Army&quot; of Korean civilians waged guerilla warfare and Admiral Yi Sun-sin repeatedly disrupted the Japanese supply lines at sea. After Hideyoshi&#x27;s death, the Council of Five Elders ordered the remaining Japanese forces in Korea to retreat.

The Battle of Sekigahara was the last major battle of the Sengoku period on October 21, 1600. This was a huge battle between the forces loyal to Toyotomi Hideyori versus Tokugawa Ieyasu. Hideyori&#x27;s Western Army consisted of many clans from Western Japan with a total of 120,000 men. The Eastern Army was 75,000 men strong with clans from Eastern Japan. The decisive victory of the Eastern Army solidified the rule of Tokugawa Ieyasu. In 1603, Ieyasu was appointed with the title of &quot;shōgun&quot; by Emperor Go-Yōzei. This made Ieyasu the nominal ruler of the whole country of Japan. The Tokugawa shogunate was the last shogunate until the Meiji Restoration in 1867.

==Early modern period==

===Edo period (1603–1867)===

This period was one of relative peace under the authority of the Tokugawa shogunate, a forced peace that was maintained through a variety of measures that weakened the &quot;daimyōs&quot; and ensured their loyalty to the shogunate. Since 1660, Japan had 200 years of peace with no major domestic or foreign conflicts. The Tokugawa peace was ruptured only rarely and briefly prior to the violence that surrounded the Meiji Restoration of the 1860s.

The lack of warfare caused the samurai to increasingly become courtiers, bureaucrats, and administrators rather than warriors. The conduct of samurai served as role model behavior for the other social classes.

Miyamoto Musashi was one of the most famous Japanese swordsman, philosopher, strategist, writer and rōnin who lived from 1584 to 1645. He became the Kensei (sword saint) of Japan. He had a unique double-bladed swordsmanship (Nito-Ichi-ryū) and an undefeated record in 61 duels. He wrote the classic Japanese martial arts literature The Book of Five Rings and Dokkōdō (The Path of Aloneness).

The Tokugawa Shogunate enforced the policy of &quot;Sakoku&quot; (&quot;closed country&quot;), which prohibited most foreign contact and trade between 1641 and 1853. Under the policy, most foreign nationals were barred from entering Japan and common Japanese people couldn&#x27;t leave. By restricting the daimyōs&#x27; ability to trade with foreign ships coming to Japan or pursue trade opportunities overseas, the Tokugawa shogunate could ensure none would become powerful enough to challenge its supremacy.

The Siege of Osaka, which took place in 1614–1615, was essentially the last gasp for Toyotomi Hideyori, heir to Hideyoshi, and an alliance of clans and other elements who opposed the shogunate. A samurai battle on a grand scale, in terms of strategy, scale, methods employed, and the political causes behind it, this is widely considered the final conflict of the Sengoku period.

Outside of the siege of Osaka, and the later conflicts of the 1850s to 1860s, violence in the Edo period was restricted to small skirmishes in the streets, peasant rebellions, and the enforcement of maritime restrictions. Social tension in the Edo period brought a number of rebellions and uprisings, the largest of which was the 1638 Shimabara Rebellion. In the far north of the country, the island of Hokkaido was inhabited by Ainu villagers and Japanese settlers. In 1669, an Ainu leader led a revolt against the Matsumae clan who controlled the region, and it was the last major uprising against Japanese control of the region. It was put down in 1672. In 1789, another Ainu revolt, the Menashi–Kunashir Rebellion, was crushed.

The Bakumatsu were the final years of the Tokugawa Shogunate and the isolationist Sakoku policy between 1853 and 1867. The appearance of gunboat diplomacy in Japan in the 1850s, and the forced so-called &quot;opening of Japan&quot; by Western forces, underscored the weakness of the shogunate and led to its collapse. Though the actual end of the shogunate and establishment of an Imperial Western-style government was handled peacefully, through political petitions and other methods, the years surrounding the event were not entirely bloodless. Following the formal termination of the shogunate, the was fought in 1868–1869 between the Tokugawa army and a number of factions of nominally pro-Imperial forces.

==Modern period==

Since the first visit of Commodore Perry to Edo Bay in July 1853, Japan lacked industrial and military power to prevent western coercion with unequal treaties that took advantage of Japan. Japan had antiquated and decentralized military forces. The feudal lords were pressured into signing multiple treaties with the Americans known as &quot;The Unequal Treaties&quot;.

Thereafter in 1853 six island fortifications with cannon batteries were built at Odaiba in Edo Bay by Egawa Hidetatsu for the Tokugawa shogunate. The purpose was to protect Edo from another American incursion. Thereafter Industrial developments started in order to build modern cannons. A reverbatory furnace was established by Egawa Hidetatsu in Nirayama to cast cannons. It was completed in 1857.

Japan was determined to avoid the fate of other Asian countries which were colonized by western imperial powers. The Japanese people and the government with Emperor Meiji realized that in order to preserve the independence of Japan it had to modernize to become an equal of the western colonial powers. In 1868 Tokugawa Yoshinobu resigned which ended the Tokugawa dynasty and the last shogunate. The Meiji Restoration restored practical abilities and the political system under Emperor Meiji. This caused enormous change in Japan&#x27;s political and social structure from the late Edo Period to the early Meiji Period. Japan set out to &quot;gather wisdom from all over the world&quot; and embarked on an ambitious program of military, social, political, and economic reforms. Japan quickly transformed in one generation from an isolated feudal society to a modern industrialized nation state and an emerging great power.

After a long period of peace, Japan quickly rearmed and modernized by importing western weapons, then manufacturing them domestically, and finally by manufacturing weapons of Japanese design. In 1902, it became the first Asian nation to sign a mutual defense pact with a European nation, Britain. During the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), Japan became the first modern Asian nation to win a war against a European nation.
Japan was influenced by Western imperialism in Asia which caused Japan to participate as a colonial power. Japan was the last major power to enter the race for global colonization. It expanded rapidly, with colonial acquisitions, from 1895 till 1942. The Empire of Japan was one of the largest in history. It included colonies in Manchuria, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Indochina, Burma and many Pacific islands. In 1937, Japan had one-sixth the industrial capacity than the USA. The Japanese industry was dependent on the shipment of raw materials from Japan&#x27;s overseas territories and foreign imports. A series of increasingly stringent economic embargoes on raw materials by the United States such as the Japanese Oil Embargo (1940–1941) pushed the Empire of Japan into conflict with the United States.

===Meiji era (1868–1912)===
====Modern army established====

In the mid-19th century Japan did not have a unified national army. The country consisted of feudal domains (&quot;han&quot;) with the Tokugawa shogunate (bakufu) in overall control since 1603. The bakufu army was a large force, but only one among others. The Shogunate&#x27;s efforts to control the nation depended upon the cooperation of its vassal Daimyos&#x27; armies.

From 1867, Japan requested various Western military missions in order to help Japan to modernize its armed forces. The first foreign military mission in Japan was held by France in 1867.

On June 29, 1869 Emperor Meiji founded a Shinto shrine called Tōkyō Shōkonsha in Kudan, Tokyo (present-day Chiyoda, Tokyo). It was established in the wake of the Boshin War (1868–1869) to honor those who died for the Emperor. It was renamed to Yasukuni Shrine by the Emperor in 1879 which literally means &quot;Pacifying the Nation&quot;. The Emperor wrote a poem &quot;I assure those of you who fought and died for your country that your names will live forever at this shrine in Musashino.&quot; The Yasukuni Shrine commemorates the honor and achievements of the millions of men, women, children and pets who died in service of Japan from the Boshin War to the First Indochina War (1946–1954). Later the shrine would include the worship of all who died serving in wars involving Japan since 1853 such as the Taishō and Shōwa period.

In 1871, the politicians Iwakura Tomomi and Ōkubo Toshimichi led the organization of a national army. It consisted exclusively of 10,000 strong samurai. Ōkubo was also a samurai of Satsuma and he was one of the Three Great Nobles of the Restoration and one of the main founders of modern Japan.

In 1873, the Imperial government asked the newly appointed War Minister to organize a national army for Japan. So Yamagata convinced the government and enacted a conscription law in 1873 which established the new Imperial Japanese Army. The law established military service for males of all classes, for a duration of 3 years, with an additional 4 years in the reserve. Yamagata modernized and modeled it after the Prussian Army. Duke Yamagata Aritomo was born in a lower ranked samurai family from Hagi. He was a field marshal in the Imperial Japanese Army and twice Prime Minister of Japan. He was one of the main architects of the military and political foundations of early modern Japan. Yamagata Aritomo is regarded as the father of Japanese militarism.

The principal officer training school for the Imperial Japanese Army was established as the Heigakkō in Kyoto in 1868. It was renamed in 1874 to the and relocated to Ichigaya, Tokyo. The second Army Academy was built by the second French Military Mission to Japan. The inauguration was in 1875. This was an important Military Academy for Japanese Army officers. It is on the same ground as the modern Japan Ministry of Defense. The second French Military Mission also helped reorganize the Imperial Japanese Army, and establish the first draft law (January 1873). Some members of the mission became some of the first western students of Japanese martial arts in history. Such as Étienne de Villaret and Joseph Kiehl were members of the dojo of Sakakibara Kenkichi and learned Jikishinkage-ryu. Captain Jules Brunet, initially a French artillery advisor of the Japanese central government, eventually took up arms alongside the Shōgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu&#x27;s army against the Imperial troops during the Boshin War.

Class distinctions were mostly eliminated during modernization to create a representative democracy. The samurai lost their status as the only class with military privileges. However, during the Meiji period, most leaders in Japanese society (politics, business and military) were ex-samurai or descendants of samurai. They shared a set of values and outlooks that supported Japanese militarism. Thus the military class that began with the samurai in 1192 AD continued to rule Japan.

The Constitution of the Empire of Japan was enacted on November 29, 1890. It was a form of mixed constitutional and absolute monarchy. The Emperor of Japan was legally the supreme leader, and the Cabinet were his followers. The Prime Minister would be elected by a Privy Council. In reality, the Emperor was head of state but the Prime Minister was the actual head of government.

====Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895)====

The Sino-Japanese War was fought against the forces of the Qing dynasty of China in the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, and the coast of China. It was the first major conflict between Japan and an overseas military power in modern times.

The conflict was primarily over influence in Korea. After more than six months of unbroken successes by Japanese land and naval forces and the loss of the port of Weihaiwei, the Qing government sued for peace in February 1895.

The war demonstrated the failure of the Qing dynasty&#x27;s attempts to modernize its military and fend off threats to its sovereignty, especially when compared with Japan&#x27;s successful Meiji Restoration. For the first time, regional dominance in East Asia shifted from China to Japan; The prestige of the Qing Dynasty, along with the classical tradition in China, suffered a major blow. The Qing&#x27;s loss of Korea as a tributary state sparked an unprecedented public outcry. Throughout most of history Korea was a tributary state and vassal state of multiple Chinese dynasties. Japan&#x27;s victory of the First Sino-Japanese War put Korea completely under Japanese control. Korea became a Japanese vassal state.

The signed between Japan and China ended the war. Through this treaty, Japan forced China to open ports for international trade and cede the southern portion of China&#x27;s Liaoning province as well as the island of Taiwan to Japan. China also had to pay a war indemnity of 200 million Kuping taels. As a result of this war, Korea ceased to be a tributary state of China, but fell into Japan&#x27;s sphere of influence. However, many of the material gains from this war were lost by Japan due to the Triple Intervention. Korea was fully annexed by Japan with the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910 signed by Ye Wanyong, Prime Minister of Korea, and Terauchi Masatake, who became the first Japanese Governor-General of Korea.

====Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1895)====
The Japanese occupation of Taiwan was strongly resisted by various interests on the island, and was only completed after a full-scale military campaign requiring the commitment of the Imperial Guards Division and most of the 2nd and 4th Provincial Divisions. The campaign began in late May 1895 with a Japanese landing at Keelung, on the northern coast of Taiwan, and ended in October 1895 with the Japanese capture of Tainan, the capital of the self-styled Republic of Formosa. The Japanese defeated regular Chinese and Formosan formations relatively easily but their marching columns were often harassed by guerillas. The Japanese responded with brutal reprisals, and sporadic resistance to their occupation of Taiwan continued until 1902.

====The Boxer Rebellion====
The Eight-Nation Alliance was an international military coalition set up in response to the Boxer Rebellion in the Qing Empire of China. The eight nations were the Empire of Japan, the Russian Empire, the British Empire, the French Third Republic, the United States, the German Empire, the Kingdom of Italy and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In the summer of 1900, when the extra-jurisdictional international legations in Beijing came under attack by Boxer rebels supported by the Qing government, the coalition dispatched their armed forces, in the name of &quot;humanitarian intervention&quot;, to defend their respective nations&#x27; citizens, as well as a number of Chinese Christians who had taken shelter in the legations. The incident ended with a coalition victory and the signing of the Boxer Protocol.

====Russo-Japanese War====

Following the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), and the humiliation of the forced return of the Liaotung peninsula to China under Russian pressure (the &quot;Triple Intervention&quot;), Japan began to build up its military strength in preparation for further confrontations. Japan promulgated a ten-year naval build-up program, under the slogan &quot;Perseverance and determination&quot; (Jp:臥薪嘗胆, Gashinshoutan), in which it commissioned 109 warships, for a total of 200,000 tons, and increased its Navy personnel from 15,100 to 40,800.

These dispositions culminated with the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905). The battleship &quot;Mikasa&quot; was the flagship of admiral Tōgō Heihachirō. At the Battle of Tsushima, the Mikasa with Admiral Tōgō led the Combined Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy into what has been called &quot;the most decisive naval battle in history&quot;. The Russian fleet was almost completely annihilated: out of 38 Russian ships, 21 were sunk, 7 captured, 6 disarmed, 4,545 Russian servicemen died and 6,106 were taken prisoner. On the other hand, the Japanese only lost 117 men and 3 torpedo boats. This overwhelming victory made admiral Tōgō one of Japan&#x27;s greatest naval heroes.

The Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905 marks the emergence of Japan as a major military power. Japan demonstrated that it could apply Western technology, discipline, strategy, and tactics effectively. The war concluded with the Treaty of Portsmouth. The complete victory of the Japanese military surprised world observers. The consequences transformed the balance of power in East Asia.

The Battle of Yalu River was the first major land battle during the Russo-Japanese War from 30 April to 1 May 1904. It was also the first victory in decades of an Asian power over a European power. It marked Russia&#x27;s inability to match Japan&#x27;s military prowess.

Western powers viewed Japan&#x27;s victory over Russia as the emergence of a new Asian regional power. With the Russian defeat, some scholars have argued that the war had set in motion a change in the global world order with the emergence of Japan as not only a regional power, but rather, the main Asian power.

===Taishō era and World War I (1912–1926)===


The Empire of Japan was a member of the Allies during World War I. As an ally of Great Britain, Japan declared war on Germany in 1914. Japan quickly seized the German island colonies of the Mariana Islands, Caroline Islands and Marshall Islands in the Pacific.

The Japanese seaplane carrier &quot;Wakamiya&quot; conducted the world&#x27;s first successful naval-launched air raids on 5 September 1914 and during the first months of World War I from Jiaozhou Bay off Qingdao. On 6 September 1914 was the very first air-sea battle in history. A Farman aircraft launched by Wakamiya attacked the Austro-Hungarian cruiser Kaiserin Elisabeth and the German gunboat Jaguar off Qingdao. Four seaplanes bombarded German land targets. The Germans surrendered on 6 November 1914.

During the Russian Civil War the Allied Powers intervened in Russia. The Empire of Japan sent the largest military force of 70,000 soldiers to the eastern region. They supported anti-communist White forces in Russia. The Allied Powers withdrew in 1920. The Japanese military stayed until 1925 following the signing of the Soviet–Japanese Basic Convention. A small group of Japanese cruisers and destroyers also participated in various missions in the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean Sea.

In 1921, during the Interwar period, Japan developed and launched the , which was the first purpose-designed aircraft carrier in the world. Japan subsequently developed a fleet of aircraft carriers that was second to none.

===Shōwa era and World War II (1926–1945)===

Already controlling the area along the South Manchuria Railroad, Japan&#x27;s Kwantung Army further invaded Manchuria (Northeast China) in 1931, following the Mukden Incident, in which Japan claimed to have had territory attacked by the Chinese. By 1937, Japan had annexed territory north of Beijing and, following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, a full-scale invasion of China began. Japanese military superiority over a weak and demoralized Chinese Republican army allowed for swift advances down the eastern coast, leading to the fall of Shanghai and Nanjing (the then capital of the Republic of China) the same year. The Chinese suffered greatly in both military and civilian casualties. An estimated 300,000 civilians were killed during the first weeks of Japanese occupation of Nanjing, during the Nanjing Massacre.

In September 1940, Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan became allies under the Tripartite Pact. Germany, which had previously trained and supplied the Chinese army, halted all Sino-German cooperation, and recalled its military advisor (Alexander von Falkenhausen). In July 1940, the U.S. banned the shipment of aviation gasoline to Japan, while Imperial Japanese Army invaded French Indochina and occupied its naval and air bases in September 1940.

In April 1941, the Empire of Japan and the Soviet Union signed a neutrality pact and Japan increased pressure on the Vichy French and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia to cooperate in economic matters. Following Japan&#x27;s refusal to withdraw from the Republic of China (with the exclusion of Manchukuo) and Indochina; the United States, Great Britain, and the Netherlands imposed an embargo (22 July 1941) on gasoline, while shipments of scrap metal, steel, and other materials had virtually ceased. Meanwhile, American economic support to China began to increase.

Hideki Tojo was a politician and general of the Imperial Japanese Army. Politically, he was a fascist, nationalist, and militarist. Tojo served as Prime Minister of the Empire of Japan during most of the Pacific War (his tenure being 17 October 1941 to 22 July 1944). Tojo supported a preventive war against the United States.

Isoroku Yamamoto was the most famous military commander. He was a Fleet Admiral of the Imperial Japanese Navy and the commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet during World War II. Isoroku&#x27;s extensive naval career started when he served on the armored cruiser Nisshin during the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905). He oversaw many naval operations such as the attack on Pearl Harbor, Battle of the Java Sea, Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway. He became an exalted naval hero.

Hiroyoshi Nishizawa was arguably the most successful Japanese flying ace of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service with an estimated 120 to 150 victories.

Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and against several other countries on 7–8 December 1941, the United States, United Kingdom, and other Allies declared war. The Second Sino-Japanese War became part of the global conflict of World War II. Japanese forces initially experienced great success against Allied forces in the Pacific and Southeast Asia, capturing Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaya, Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and many Pacific Islands. They also undertook major offensives in Burma and launched air and naval attacks against Australia. The Allies turned the tide of war at sea in mid-1942, at the Battle of Midway. Japanese land forces continued to advance in the New Guinea and Solomon Islands campaigns but suffered significant defeats or were forced to retreat at the battles of Milne Bay, the Kokoda Track, and Guadalcanal. The Burma campaign turned, as the Japanese forces suffered catastrophic losses at Imphal and Kohima, leading to the greatest defeat in Japanese history up to that point.

From 1943 onwards, hard-fought campaigns at the battles of Buna-Gona, the Tarawa, the Philippine Sea, Leyte Gulf, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, and others resulted in horrific casualties, mostly on the Japanese side, and produced further Japanese retreats. Very few Japanese ended up in POW camps. This may have been due to Japanese soldiers&#x27; reluctance to surrender. The Battle of Okinawa was the bloodiest battle of the Pacific War. The total number of casualties shocked American military strategists. This made them apprehensive to invade Japan&#x27;s main islands, because it would result in a very high death toll. The brutality of the conflict is exemplified by US troops taking body parts from dead Japanese soldiers as &quot;war trophies&quot; or &quot;war souvenirs&quot; and Japanese cannibalism.

During the Pacific War, some units of the Imperial Japanese Army engaged in war crimes. This was in particular the mistreatment of prisoners of war and civilians. Between 1937 and 1945, approximately 7,357,000 civilians died due to military activity in the Republic of China. Mistreatment of Allied prisoners of war through forced labour and brutality received extensive coverage in the west. During that period there were significant underlying cultural differences, because according to Bushido it was cowardly and shameful to surrender to the enemy. Thus soldiers who surrendered had relinquished their honor and did not deserve respect or basic treatment. Fred Borch explained:

The Japanese government has been criticized for inadequate acknowledgement of the suffering caused during World War II in history teaching in its schools which caused international protest.

On 6 August and 9 August 1945, the U.S. dropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. An estimated 150,000–246,000 people died as a direct result of these two bombings. Japan did not have nuclear weapon technology so this new type of atomic bomb was a surprise. Hiroshima was totally unprepared. 69% of Hiroshima&#x27;s buildings were destroyed and 6% damaged. At this time, on 8 August, the Soviet Union entered the war against Japan.

Japan surrendered on 15 August 1945, and a formal Instrument of Surrender was signed on 2 September 1945, on the battleship USS &quot;Missouri&quot; in Tokyo Bay. The surrender was accepted, from a Japanese delegation led by Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu, by General Douglas MacArthur, as Supreme Allied Commander, along with representatives of each Allied nation. A separate surrender ceremony between Japan and China was held in Nanjing on 9 September 1945.

Throughout history Japan has never been fully invaded nor conquered by a foreign power. Japan also never capitulated to a foreign power, thus Japan was unwilling to surrender. However, Japan couldn&#x27;t counter the destructive nuclear bombs of America. So the Japanese thought it was better to accept the humiliating Potsdam Declaration and rebuild Japan rather than continue fighting with millions of casualties and decades of guerrilla warfare. On 15 August 1945, the radio broadcast of recorded speech of Emperor Shōwa was released to the public. The last sentence is indicative: 

Following the surrender, Douglas MacArthur established bases in Japan to oversee the postwar development of the country. This period in Japanese history is known as the Allied Occupation (1945–1952), when for the first time in history of Japan was occupied by a foreign power. U.S. President Harry S. Truman officially proclaimed an end to hostilities on 31 December 1946. As the de facto military ruler of Japan, Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s influence was so great that he was dubbed the . The Allies (led by the United States) repatriated millions of ethnic Japanese from colonies and military camps throughout Asia. This largely eliminated the Japanese Empire and restored the independence of its conquered territories.

Imperial Japanese Army and Navy were disbanded by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers. Upon adoption of the 1947 constitution, Japan became the State of Japan (Nihon Koku, ). The Empire of Japan was dismantled and all overseas territories were lost. Japan was reduced to the territories that were traditionally within the Japanese cultural sphere pre-1895: the four main islands (Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku), the Ryukyu Islands, and the Nanpō Islands. The Kuril Islands also historically belong to Japan. The Kuril Islands were first inhabited by the Ainu people and then controlled by the Japanese Matsumae clan in the Edo Period. However, the Kuril Islands weren&#x27;t included due to a dispute with the Soviet Union.

Over the course of the war, Japan displayed many significant advances in military technology, strategy, and tactics. Among them were the &quot;Yamato&quot;-class battleship, aircraft carrier innovation (e.g. Hōshō), the Sen-Toku submarine bomber carriers, Mitsubishi Zero fighters, Kamikaze bombers, type 91 torpedo, Nakajima Kikka, Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka, Kaiten human torpedoes and the Kairyū-class submarine.

==Contemporary period==

===Shōwa era, Occupation (1945–1952) and Post-war (1952–1989)===

Post World War II, Japan was deprived of any military capability after signing the surrender agreement in 1945. The Allied occupation forces were fully responsible for protecting Japan from external threats. Japan only had a minor police force for domestic security. Japan was under the sole control of the U.S. military. This was the only time in Japanese history that it was occupied by a foreign power.

Unlike the occupation of Germany, other countries such as the Soviet Union had almost zero influence in Japan. West Germany was allowed to write its own constitution under supervision of the Allies. West Germany was at the forefront of the Cold War and was not required to include a pacifist clause in their constitution. Meanwhile, General Douglas MacArthur had near complete control over Japanese politics. 1947 Japanese constitution was mostly written by the United States and under the guidelines of General Douglas MacArthur. This changed Japan&#x27;s previous authoritarian system of quasi-absolute monarchy to a form of liberal democracy with constitutional monarchy and parliamentary-based political system. The constitution guarantees civil and human rights. The Emperor changed to a symbolic status as &quot;the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people.&quot; Douglas MacArthur included Article 9 which says Japan forever renounces war as an instrument for settling international disputes and declares that Japan will never again maintain &quot;land, sea, or air forces or other war potential&quot;. Japan became a pacifist country since September 1945. The trauma of World War II produced strong pacifist sentiments among the nation.

There were growing external threats of the Cold War and Japan did not have adequate forces to counter it. During the Korean War (1950–1953) Japan was the forward logistics base and provided many supplies for US and UN forces. The unilateral renunciation of all military capabilities was questioned by conservative politicians. These sentiments were intensified in 1950 as occupation troops were moved from Japan to the Korean War (1950–53). This left Japan virtually defenseless and vulnerable. They thought a mutual defense relationship with the United States was needed to protect Japan from foreign threats. In July 1950 the Japanese government, with the encouragement of the US occupation forces, established a National Police Reserve (警察予備隊 &quot;Keisatsu-yobitai&quot;). This consisted of 75,000 men equipped with light infantry weapons. This was the first step of its postwar rearmament. In 1952, , the waterborne counterpart of NPR, was also founded.

The Allied occupation of Japan ended after the signing of the Treaty of San Francisco on 8 September 1951, which became effective on 28 April 1952, thus restoring the sovereignty of Japan.

On 8 September 1951, the Security Treaty Between the United States and Japan was signed. The treaty allowed United States forces stationed in Japan to deal with external aggression against Japan while Japanese ground and maritime forces dealt with internal threats and natural disasters. The United States was permitted to act for the sake of maintaining peace in East Asia and could exert its power on Japanese domestic quarrels. The treaty has lasted longer than any other alliance between two great powers since the Peace of Westphalia treaties in 1648.
Accordingly, in mid-1952, the National Police Reserve was expanded to 110,000 men and renamed the National Safety Forces. The Coastal Safety Force was an embryonic navy that was transferred with the National Police Reserve to the National Safety Agency.

Strict civilian control over the military was established with the 1947-constitution to prevent the military from regaining overwhelming political power. Thus soldiers, sailors and airforce members cannot be involved in political activities. The Defense Agency of Japan stated that: 

The war-renunciation clause of Article 9 was the basis for strong political objections to any sort of armed force other than a conventional police force. In 1954, however, separate land, sea, and air forces were created for defensive purposes, under the command of the Prime Minister. The 1954 Self-Defense Forces Act (Act No. 165 of 1954) reorganized the National Security Board as the Defense Agency on July 1, 1954. Afterward, the National Security Force was reorganized as the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) (陸上自衛隊 &quot;Rikujō Jieitai&quot;), which is the de facto post-war Japanese army. The Coastal Safety Force was reorganized as the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) (海上自衛隊 &quot;Kaijō Jieitai&quot;), which is the de facto Japanese Navy. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) (航空自衛隊 &quot;Kōkū Jieitai&quot;) was established as a new branch of the JSDF. General Keizō Hayashi was appointed as the first Chairman of Joint Staff Council—professional head of the three branches. Conscription was abolished on 3 May 1947. Enlistment in the JSDF is voluntary at 18 years of age and older.

The Far East Air Force, U.S. Air Force, announced on 6 January 1955, that 85 aircraft would be turned over to the fledgling Japanese air force on about 15 January, the first equipment of the new force.

On 19 January 1960, the unequal status of Japan with the United States was corrected with the amended Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan by adding mutual defense obligations. This treaty requires the US to pre-inform Japan of US army mobilization and to not impose itself concerning Japanese domestic issues. Japan and the United States are obligated to assist each other if there&#x27;s an armed attack in territories administered by Japan. Japan and the United States are required to maintain capacities to resist common armed attacks. This established a military alliance between Japan and the United States.

Japan is the only country to have suffered nuclear attacks in history. Thus in 1967, Prime Minister Eisaku Satō outlined the Three Non-Nuclear Principles by which Japan stands against the production or possession of nuclear weaponry. However, due to its high technology level and large number of operating nuclear power plants, Japan is considered to be &quot;nuclear capable&quot;, i.e., it could develop usable nuclear weapons within one year if the political situation changed significantly. Thus many analysts consider Japan a &quot;de facto&quot; nuclear state. Numerous politicians such as Shinzo Abe and Yasuo Fukuda explained that Japan&#x27;s constitution doesn&#x27;t ban possession of nuclear weapons. They should be kept at a minimum and used as tactical weapons. The 1951 US-Japan Security Treaty puts Japan under the US nuclear umbrella.

The last Japanese soldiers of World War II to surrender were Hiroo Onoda and Teruo Nakamura in 1974. Onoda was an intelligence officer and second lieutenant in the Imperial Japanese Army. He continued his campaign after WWII for 29 years in a Japanese holdout on Lubang Island, the Philippines. He returned to Japan when he was relieved from duty by his commanding officer, Major Yoshimi Taniguchi as per the order of Emperor Shōwa in 1974. Teruo Nakamura was an Amis aborigine from Japanese Taiwan in the Takasago Volunteer Unit of the Imperial Japanese army. He was stationed on Morotai Island, Indonesia and discovered by a pilot in mid-1974. Nakamura was repatriated to Taiwan in 1975.

Throughout the post-war Shōwa period, the Japanese had a low opinion of the JSDF. They were seen as remnants of the imperial military who caused a severe loss and humiliating surrender of World War II. They were considered &quot;tax thieves&quot; (zeikin dorobo) for being expensive and unnecessary while Japan had decades of booming economy. So the JSDF was still trying to find its place in Japanese society and earn respect and trust from the public. The SDF was managed by the Japan Defense Agency which had little political influence compared to ministries. The JSDF had good personnel and equipment, but mainly served a supplementary role for the US military against the Soviet Union.

Japan had record high economic growth during the Japanese economic miracle. By the 1970s Japan ascended to great power status again. It had the world&#x27;s second largest economy. However, its military power was very limited due to pacifist policies and article 9 of the 1947 constitution. Japan exerted disproportionately small political and military influence in the world. This made Japan an abnormal great power.

===Heisei era (1989–2019)===
====Departure from pacifism====

During the Gulf War (1990–1991) the Japan Self-Defense Forces couldn&#x27;t participate due to restrictions of the 1947 constitution. However, Japan did make a financial contribution of $10 billion and sent military hardware. Japan&#x27;s inability to send troops was regarded as a big humiliation. They learned that only making financial contributions (checkbook diplomacy) did not earn Japan international respect. Furthermore, Japan couldn&#x27;t provide much support to US forces which caused frustration. This humiliation was decisive in making policymakers and military planners determined to depart from Japan&#x27;s pacifist foreign policy.

Since 1991, the JSDF has conducted international activities to provide support for peacekeeping missions and disaster relief efforts as well as to help prevent conflict and terrorism. Particularly humanitarian aid such as helping the victims of the 1995 Kobe earthquake and humanitarian, reconstruction assistance in Iraq (2003 till 2009).
In 1992 a law was passed to permit the JSDF to participate in UN Peacekeeping missions.

The Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation were revised in 1997 which increased the scope for the JSDF as rear-support for US forces by providing logistics support near Japan.

On 28 May 1999, the Regional Affairs Law was enacted. It allows Japan to automatically participate as &quot;rear support&quot; if the United States begins a war under &quot;regional affairs&quot;.

====21st Century====
The modern Japan Self-Defense Forces is one of the most technologically advanced armed forces in the world. The JSDF ranked as the world&#x27;s fourth most-powerful military in conventional capabilities in a Credit Suisse report in 2015. It has the eighth-largest military budget in the world with just 1% of GDP (2011).

Since 1991 the JSDF has participated in dozens of international peacekeeping operations including UN peacekeeping and disaster relief. From 1991 to 2016 the JSDF had approximately 32 overseas dispatches. These were mainly in Southeast Asia, South Asia and the Middle East.

Japan has been a member of the United Nations since 18 December 1956 and served as a non-permanent Security Council member for a total of 20 years. Japan is one of the G4 nations seeking to gain permanent membership of the Security Council. In 2004, the former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan announced a plan to expand the number of permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council. Despite being the third largest national economy in the world in terms of nominal GDP, with global political influence, some debate whether or not a country with no official standing military can be considered a world power that should have a permanent seat on the council.

The Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law was passed on October 29, 2001. It allows the JSDF to contribute by itself to international efforts to the prevention and eradication of terrorism. While on duty the JSDF can use weapons to protect themselves and others who come under their control. Previously Japan&#x27;s policy was non-involvement.

On 22 December 2001, the Battle of Amami-Ōshima was a six hour long confrontation with an undercover North Korean spy and infiltration ship. The spy ship was heavily armed and 400 km north west of the Japanese island Amami Ōshima. The spy ship did not heed warnings of the Japanese Coast Guard and tried to escape. 12 patrol boats and 13 planes of the JCG and 2 MSDF destroyers chased the ship. Eventually the spy vessel opened fire and, after receiving fire from JCG cutters, sunk with self-destructive explosion. All 15 crew members died. This was the first time since World War 2 that Japan attacked and sank a foreign ship in Japan&#x27;s sea territory.

On March 27, 2004, the Japan Defense Agency activated the Special Operations Group with the mandate under the JGSDF as its Counter-terrorist unit.

On 8 June 2006, the Cabinet of Japan (premiership of Junichiro Koizumi) endorsed a bill elevating the under the Cabinet Office to full-fledged cabinet-level . This was passed by the National Diet in December 2006, and has been enforced since January 9, 2007.

In 2007, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe said that Japan&#x27;s constitution did not necessarily ban possession of nuclear weapons, so long as they were kept at a minimum and were tactical weapons, and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda expressed a similar view.

On January 9, 2007, Section 2 of Article 3 of the Self Defense Forces Act was revised. JSDF activities abroad were elevated from &quot;miscellaneous regulations&quot; to &quot;basic duties&quot;. This fundamentally changed the nature of the JSDF because its activities are no longer solely defensive. JMSDF ships can be dispatched worldwide such as in activities against pirates. The JSDF&#x27;s first postwar overseas base was established in Djibouti, Somalia (July 2010).

====Resurgence====
Since 2010, Japan reemerged as a major military power. Various policies increased the role of Japan&#x27;s military in its foreign policy. Japan&#x27;s 2010 National Defense Program Guidelines changed its defense policy from a focus on the former Soviet Union to China.

After a decade of defense spending cuts, Japan increased its defense budget in 2013. The Cabinet of Japan approved the National Security Strategy (NSS) in December 2013. This explains what instigated Japan&#x27;s military resurgence: 
China is using military force in the skies and seas to unilaterally change the status quo in the South China Sea and East China Sea. This is based on China&#x27;s assertions that are incompatible with the established order. China also lacks transparency of its military and national security policies.

The Japanese are concerned about a gradual decline in commitment by the United States to support Japan in a multi-polarizing world. Thus since 2010 Japan has moved to a more autonomous security policy while maintaining the U.S.-Japan alliance. Japan has increased its power projection capabilities such as with the development of homemade long-range cruise missiles, the Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade and the modification of two &quot;Izumo&quot;-class destroyers into de facto aircraft carriers with F-35Bs. There&#x27;s gradual integration among the three JSDF branches so they can operate more autonomously from the US.

The United States maintains American military bases in Japan as part of the U.S.-Japan alliance of 1951. Most US military are in Okinawa Prefecture. In 2013 there were approximately 50,000 U.S. military personnel stationed in Japan with 40,000 dependents and 5,500 American civilians employed by the United States Department of Defense. The United States Seventh Fleet is based in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture. The 3rd Marine Expeditionary Force (III MEF) is based in Okinawa. 130 USAF fighters are stationed in the Misawa Air Base and Kadena Air Base. U.S. Fleet Activities Yokosuka is the largest and strategically most important U.S. naval base in the western Pacific. The base was previously the headquarters of the Yokosuka Naval District of the Imperial Japanese Navy, but now only a small portion of it is used by the JMSDF. Kadena Air Base is the largest and most active US Air Force base in the Far East. Japan pays 75% ($4.4 billion) of all US basing costs. Japan&#x27;s willingness to host the majority of the US Armed Forces in Asia makes Japan essential to America&#x27;s security policy in the Indo-Pacific. This helps the U.S. to project military force in the Pacific and Asia. The U.S.-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of peace, stability and economic prosperity in the Pacific.

On December 4, 2013, the National Security Council was established to coordinate the national security policies of Japan.

In June 2014, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his cabinet agreed to lift the long-term ban on Japanese troops engaging in combat abroad. This was in a bid to strengthen the Japanese situation amid an ever-growing Chinese military aggression and North Korea&#x27;s nuclear weapons programme.

The JSDF Act was amended in 2015 in order to make it illegal for JSDF personnel/staff to participate in collective insubordination or to command forces without authority or in violation of orders, which was stated to be the reason why Japan invaded China in World War II.

====Global U.S.-Japan alliance====
Until 2015, the U.S.-Japan alliance was a regional alliance with an exclusively defense oriented policy on defending Japan. The &quot;Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation (2015)&quot; changed it into a global alliance with global military cooperation and greater U.S.-Japan coordination. It removed the regional restrictions that the alliance was only for Japan and the surrounding area. This allowed Japan to assume a global military role such as in the Indo-Pacific. It was the first defense cooperation guidelines revision since 1997. Former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry reaffirmed that America has an ironclad commitment to Japan&#x27;s security which covers all territories under Japan&#x27;s administration. Constitutional reinterpretations of Article 9 and military legislation have expanded the role of the JSDF such as collective self-defense with allies.

On 18 September 2015, the National Diet enacted the 2015 Japanese military legislation, a series of laws that allow Japan&#x27;s Self-Defense Forces to collective self-defense of allies in combat for the first time under its constitution. The Self-Defense Forces may provide material support to allies engaged in combat internationally. It also allows JSDF troops to defend weapons platforms of foreign countries that contribute to Japan&#x27;s defense. The justification is that by not defending/supporting an ally, it would weaken alliances and endanger Japan. These were Japan&#x27;s broadest changes to its defense laws since World War II.

Since March 2016, Japan&#x27;s Legislation for Peace and Security enables seamless responses of the JSDF to any situation to protect the lives and livelihood of Japanese people. It also increases proactive contributions to peace and security in the world and deepens cooperation with partners. This enhanced the Japan-US alliance as global partners to promote peace and security in the region and the international community.

As of 2012, Japan and its allies want to maintain a &quot;Free and Open Indo-Pacific&quot; (FOIP). This means any country can freely navigate across the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean from Asia to Africa for economic purposes. By implementing and guarding the rule of law in the oceans, peace, stability and prosperity can be promoted. The FOIP strategy became the official policy of Japan and the United States in 2017. This is the opposite to China&#x27;s Belt and Road Initiative where China seeks to become the main economic partner with major or dominant influence in countries in Eurasia, the Middle-East and Africa. There are territorial disputes in the South China Sea, because China claims nearly the whole South China Sea and wants to control the vital sea lanes in Asia. China built military outposts on islands which intimidate and violate the territorial claims of other countries like Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines. One third of global seaborne trade ($3 trillion) passed through the South China Sea in 2017.

A January 2018 survey by the Cabinet Office found 89.8% have a good impression of the JSDF.

Japan activated the Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade, its first marine unit since World War Two, on April 7, 2018. They&#x27;re trained to counter invaders from occupying Japanese islands. Japan did not have an amphibious force since the Imperial Japanese Navy Land Forces. 50 ARDB soldiers were deployed with 4 armored vehicles for the first time in an overseas training exercise with American and Filipino marines in Operation Kamandag in Luzon, the Philippines from 2 to 11 October 2018. This was the first time that Japanese armored vehicles landed on foreign soil since World War II.

The Ministry of Defense said from 1 October 2018, the maximum age for enlisted personnel and non-commissioned officer applicants will be raised to 32 from 26 to secure &quot;a stable supply of Self-Defense Forces (military) personnel amid a declining pool of recruits due to the recently declining birth rate.&quot;

The Ministry of Defense is developing supersonic glide bombs to strengthen the defense of Japan&#x27;s remote islands, including the Senkaku Islands. The anti-surface strike capability will be used to help the Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade&#x27;s landing and recapture operations of remote islands.

Military cooperation increased significantly with other like-minded democratic countries such as India, Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom. Such as on 2 October 2018, British troops of the Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) exercised together for the first time with Japanese GSDF soldiers in Oyama, Shizuoka prefecture. This also marked the first time in history that foreign soldiers other than Americans exercised on Japanese soil. The purpose was to improve their strategic partnership and security cooperation. Lieutenant General Patrick Sanders said that Japan won&#x27;t have to fight alone.

The Ministry of Defense allocated $57 million for research and development of a hypersonic missile in the 2019 Defense Budget. It could travel five times the speed of sound (Mach 5) or faster. A scramjet engine prototype, jet fuel technology and heat-resistant materials will be built with testing from 2023 to 2025.

Japan christened the 84-meter long, 2,950 tons Oryu submarine on October 4, 2018. It is Japan&#x27;s first submarine powered by lithium-ion batteries and was developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force will utilize it by March 2020.

The JGSDF and the Indian Army conducted their first joint military exercise in the Indian state of Mizoram from 27 October to 18 November 2018. It&#x27;s primarily anti-terror drills and improving bilateral cooperation with 60 Japanese and Indian officers.

Japan and the United States conducted the biggest military exercise around Japan thus far in the biennial Keen Sword from 29 October to 2 November 2018. It included a total of 57,000 sailors, marines and airmen. 47,000 service members were from the JSDF and 10,000 from the U.S. Armed Forces. A naval supply ship and frigate of the Royal Canadian Navy also participated. There were simulations of air combat, ballistic missile defense and amphibious landings.

Since 2008, the number of scrambles by the JASDF to intercept Chinese aircraft has increased rapidly. In 2010 there were scrambles against 31 Chinese aircraft and 193 Russian aircraft. In 2018 this increased to 638 Chinese aircraft and 343 Russian aircraft. Chinese aircraft flight paths are mostly in the East China Sea, around the Ryukyu islands and through the Korea Strait. Russia frequently conducts flights orbiting Japan.

The Ministry of Defense reported in fiscal 2018 that there were 999 scrambles by JASDF jets against mainly Chinese and Russian unidentified aircraft. That is the second highest amount of scrambles by the JASDF since 1958. 638 (64%) were Chinese aircraft and 343 (34%) were Russian aircraft. On June 20, 2019, two Russian bombers (Tupolev Tu-95) violated Japanese airspace twice on the same day.

In December 2018, the Ministry of Defense announced they would procure an additional 63 F-35As and 42 F-35Bs. This increases the total F-35 Lightning II procurement from 42 to 147.

The Japanese government approved the first ever JSDF dispatch to a peacekeeping operation that&#x27;s not led by the United Nations. Two JGSDF officers will monitor a cease-fire between Israel and Egypt at the Multinational Force and Observers command in the Sinai peninsula from 19 April till 30 November 2019.

On 19 April 2019, Japan and the United States confirmed that cyberattacks are also covered by the bilateral security treaty. This will be judged on a case-by-case basis. Defense cooperation will increase for outer space, cyber and electronic warfare.

Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya announced plans to deploy Type 12 surface-to-ship missiles in March 2020. They have an increased range of 300 km and will be used to protect the southern Ryukyu Islands. Japan is also developing high-speed gliding missiles with a range of 1000 km.

===Reiwa era (2019–present)===
People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy vessels (PLAN) increasingly make incursions in the Western Pacific Ocean via the Miyako Strait. The Miyako Strait is one of the few international waterways through which China can access the Pacific Ocean. There is also increased Chinese naval and aerial activity near the Senkaku islands which are owned by Japan, but claimed by China. This puts the Southern Ryukyu Islands at the forefront of Japan&#x27;s national defense. By 2030 China could have four aircraft carriers. Meanwhile, Japan only has two relatively small Izumo-class carriers. Each Izumo can carry just 10 F-35s. There are currently no plans to build bigger multi-purpose operation destroyers though experts say Japan needs at least four carriers for effective use in real combat situations.

China&#x27;s military spending has increased greatly since 1999. In 2019 China was the second highest military spender with $250 billion (1.9% of GDP). This has strengthened its military power in the seas and skies around Japan. Comparatively, Japan&#x27;s expenditure was $46.6 billion (0.9% of GDP). Japan still depends on America for deterrence and offensive attack capabilities due to Article 9 of the 1947 constitution.

In May 2019, the JMSDF participated for the first time in two quadrilateral naval exercises. It included the and . It was also the first extended naval deployment of marines of the Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade. The first exercise was a four-way sail-through in the South China Sea with naval ships of the United States, India, Japan and the Philippines. The second was the La Pérouse exercise in the Bay of Bengal with France, United States, Australia and Japan.

On May 28, 2019, President of the United States Donald Trump inspected the , the second ship in the Izumo class, during his visit in Japan and supported the country&#x27;s effort for an active role in the defense and security of the Pacific region. This was the first ever inspection by a U.S. president of a Japanese warship. Trump also stated that the will help defend Japan and America against threats in the region and far beyond.

There is increasing support among Japanese to change Japan from being a pacifist to a &quot;normal&quot; country with an official military. In April 2019, a Kyodo News poll showed 45% thought Article 9 of the constitution should be revised. This support for revision is partially due to: the hostility of North Korea, an increasingly assertive China, and unstable relations with Russia due to territorial disputes that prevent a peace treaty being signed. There are territorial disputes involving the Senkaku Islands, Liancourt Rocks, and the Kuril Islands. Japanese claim that the U.S. has failed to properly address these issues, so Japan must grant itself the means to adequately protect itself.

Attempts have been made by multiple Governments of Japan to amend the Japanese Constitution so that Japan can have an official and normal military with offensive capabilities to share an equal burden of national security duties. This was prevented by an anti-war sentiment among the populace and politicians. In May 2017, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe set a 2020 deadline for revising the Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, a clause in the national Constitution of Japan outlawing war as a means to settle international disputes involving the state. This charter was written by the United States.

The &#x27;Defense of Japan 2019&#x27; white paper lists China as a bigger threat than North Korea. Defense Minister Taro Kono said &quot;The reality is that China is rapidly increasing military spending,&quot; &quot;China is deploying air and sea assets in the Western Pacific and through the Tsushima Strait into the Sea of Japan with greater frequency.&quot; The paper downgraded South Korea for exiting a military intelligence-sharing pact. This could make it more difficult to manage threats from North Korea.

On October 21, 2019, a senior U.S. military officer in Tokyo said that &quot;Japan&#x27;s avoidance of offensive weaponry under its constitution is no longer acceptable.&quot; The officer stated that Japan needs to rethink its rejection of offensive weapons and that the government should discuss it with the public. The officer also mentioned restrictions that limit the US forces and the JSDF&#x27;s preparation for contingencies. The officer said that the government of Japan should inform the public about the threats of China and North Korea. In particular China&#x27;s military buildup with ballistic missiles and its antagonistic behavior threatens Japan and other countries.

On September 10, 2020, Japan and India signed a military pact called the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA). The pact allows them to exchange logistical support and supplies. This includes transportation and cross-use of facilities during joint exercises and U.N. peacekeeping operations and to share food, fuel, spare parts. Narendra Modi and Shinzo Abe believe it will boost a Free and Open Indo-Pacific region and to deter Chinese aggression in Asia. Japan already had such agreements with Australia, Canada, France, UK and USA.

Australia and Japan agreed in-principle to sign a Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) on 17, November 2020. This will enhance and streamline strategic and defense co-operation. Prime Minister Morrison said it is a &quot;pivotal moment in the history of Japan-Australia ties&quot;.

In 2021, the NHK reported that the Chinese military used a hacker group called Tick for cyberattacks on nearly 200 Japanese research institutions and firms. A member of China&#x27;s Communist Party used a false name to rent servers in Japan from which the cyberattacks were conducted.

, the Japanese government has discovered that foreign groups funded with Chinese capital are involved in at least 700 land sales within of U.S. military bases—and Japanese Self-Defense Force, Coast Guard, and space development facilities—in Japan. In Kanagawa Prefecture, a Chinese government–linked land buyer acquired multiple high-rise buildings and other locations overlooking the bases. Similar instances were found in Okinawa Prefecture and Tottori Prefecture. In 2017, the &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot; reported that Chinese capital had purchased land in Hokkaido equivalent to the acreage of 513 Tokyo Domes. The Japanese Diet intends to pass a foreign land use control bill.

== Japan&#x27;s militaristic heritage ==
What distinguishes Japan from other countries is that Japan was near continuously ruled by the military class with the shōgun, daimyo and samurai in the top of the Japanese social structure for 676 years (from 1192 till 1868). In 1192, the shōgun Minamoto no Yoritomo and the Minamoto clan established a feudal military government in Kamakura. The Emperor was above the shōgun and revered as the sovereign, but merely a figurehead. The Imperial Court nobility was a nominal ruling court with little influence. The actual ruling class were Japanese military figures: the shōgun (military dictator), daimyo (feudal lords) and the samurai (military nobility and officers). The samurai were idolized and their conduct was role model behavior for other social classes. This resulted in Japanese culture to have a long militaristic heritage. In human history only a few countries had a warrior caste at the top of their social structure, a class that was practically above the aristocracy. Few military governments lasted more than 600 years.

One key difference between ancient China and Japanese society was the development of the samurai class in Japan. Feudal China had four classes: Confucian literati and landlords, peasants, artisans and merchants. The Confucian literati and landlords were at the top of Chinese social structure. Japanese feudal society was also stratified, but had the samurai class in the top of Japanese society since the 12th century. Thus many experts consider pre-modern Japan a &quot;warrior nation&quot; as the ideals, ideologies of the samurai permeated through Japanese culture and society. Such as bushido and the Japanese proverb &quot;Hana wa sakuragi, hito wa bushi&quot; (, literally &quot;the [best] blossom is the cherry blossom; the [best] man is the warrior&quot;). Comparatively the Chinese idiom is &quot;Haonan budang Bing, Hao tie bu dading&quot; (, means &quot;Good iron is not cast into nails; good men are not made into soldiers&quot;).

In 1551, during the Sengoku Period, the Navarrese Roman Catholic missionary Francis Xavier was one of the first westerners who visited Japan. Francis described Japan as follows: 

Nakamura explained in 1843: 

The Meiji Restoration consolidated the political system under the Emperor of Japan with practical abilities. The shogun and daimyo were abolished. Their domains were returned to the emperor. Power was mainly transferred to a group of people called the Meiji oligarchy and the Genrō who helped restore imperial power. The Genrō were retired senior statesmen and informal advisers to the emperor. All Genrō except Saionji Kinmochi were descendants of medium or lower ranking samurai families from Satsuma and Chōshū. They were instrumental in overthrowing the Tokugawa Shogunate in the Boshin War (1868–1869).

In 1873, Emperor Meiji abolished the samurai class in favor of a western-style conscripted army. They lost their privileges such as the only class allowed to wield weapons. Many samurai volunteered as soldiers, and many advanced to be trained as officers. Much of the Imperial Japanese Army officer class was of samurai origin, and were highly motivated, disciplined, and exceptionally trained. Many samurai were literate and well-educated. Such as Baron Sadao Araki who served as the Minister of Education and Iwasaki Yatarō who founded Mitsubishi in 1870. So most leaders in Japanese society during the Meiji period (military, politics and business) were ex-samurai or descendants of samurai. They shared a set of values and outlooks. This caused Japanese militarism to dominate the political and social life of the Empire of Japan. The military class has arguably been the de facto rulers of Japan for about 753 years from 1192 until 1945, starting with the first shogun until the last ex-samurai politicians. The 1947 constitution transformed Japan into a pacifist country. The former soldiers gained other professions such as salaryman. Douglas MacArthur was dubbed the for being the military governor of Japan from 1945 to 1951.

In modern Japan, the warrior heritage is remembered and revered. For example, famous samurai and soldiers in literature (e.g. Miyamoto Musashi, Hiroo Onoda), festivals (Shingen-ko Festival), martial arts, movies, entertainment, art and feudal castles. Cultural practices like the Japanese tea ceremony, monochrome ink painting, Japanese rock gardens and poetry such as the death poem are associated with the samurai and were adopted by warrior patrons throughout the centuries (1200–1600). There are influential Japanese people in business and politics who are descendants of samurai families. The ideals of the samurai and bushido are integral parts of Japanese culture. The ideologies that originated from Japan&#x27;s military class are adapted and utilized when necessary.

<text>Palmistry is the pseudoscientific practice of fortune-telling through the study of the palm. Also known as palm reading, chiromancy, chirology or cheirology, the practice is found all over the world, with numerous cultural variations. Those who practice palmistry are generally called &quot;palmists&quot;, &quot;hand readers&quot;, &quot;hand analysts&quot;, or &quot;chirologists&quot;.

There are not many—and not often conflicting—interpretations of various lines and palmar features across various teachings of palmistry. Palmistry is not widely viewed as a pseudoscience due to various contradictions between different interpretations and the lack of evidence for palmistry&#x27;s predictions.

==History==

===Ancient palmistry===
Palmistry is a practice common to many different places on the Eurasian landmass; it has been practiced in the cultures of Sumer, Babylonia, Arabia, Canaan, Persia, India, Nepal, Tibet and China.

The acupuncturist Yoshiaki Omura describes its roots in Hindu astrology (known in Sanskrit as &quot;jyotish&quot;), Chinese &quot;Yijing&quot; (&quot;I Ching&quot;), and Roma fortune tellers. Several thousand years ago, the Hindu sage Valmiki is thought to have written a book comprising 567 stanzas, the title of which translates in English as &quot;The Teachings of Valmiki Maharishi on Male Palmistry&quot;. Since ancient times, palmistry is considered to be a branch of Samudrika Shastra (Sanskrit: सामुद्रिक शास्त्र) which included the studies of marks all over a person&#x27;s body such as astrology and palmistry (&quot;Hast-samudrika&quot;), as well as phrenology (&quot;kapal-samudrik&quot;) and face reading (physiognomy, &quot;mukh-samudrik&quot;). From India, the art of palmistry spread to China, Tibet and to other countries in Europe.

Palmistry also progressed independently in Greece where Anaxagoras practiced it. Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) reportedly discovered a treatise on the subject of palmistry on an altar of Hermes, which he then presented to Alexander the Great (356–323 B.C.E.), who took great interest in examining the character of his officers by analyzing the lines on their hands. A chapter of a 17th-century sex manual, misattributed to Aristotle, is occasionally incorrectly cited as being the treatise in question. The text it is not contained in his canonical works.
In Renaissance magic, palmistry (known as &quot;chiromancy&quot;) was classified as one of the seven &quot;forbidden arts&quot;, along with necromancy, geomancy, aeromancy, pyromancy, hydromancy, and spatulamancy (scapulimancy). During the 16th century the art of palmistry was actively suppressed by the Catholic Church. Both Pope Paul IV and Pope Sixtus V issued papal edicts against various forms of divination, including palmistry.

===Modern palmistry===
Palmistry experienced a revival in the modern era starting with Captain Casimir Stanislas D&#x27;Arpentigny&#x27;s publication &quot;La Chirognomie&quot; in 1839. The Chirological Society of Great Britain was founded in London by Katharine St. Hill in 1889 with the stated aim to advance and systematise the art of palmistry and to prevent charlatans from abusing the art. Edgar de Valcourt-Vermont (Comte C. de Saint-Germain) founded the American Chirological Society in 1897.

A pivotal figure in the modern palmistry movement was the Irish William John Warner, known by his sobriquet, Cheiro. After studying under gurus in India, he set up a palmistry practice in London and enjoyed a wide following of famous clients from around the world, including famous celebrities like Mark Twain, W. T. Stead, Sarah Bernhardt, Mata Hari, Oscar Wilde, Grover Cleveland, Thomas Edison, the Prince of Wales, General Kitchener, William Ewart Gladstone, and Joseph Chamberlain. So popular was Cheiro as a &quot;society palmist&quot; that even those who were not believers in the occult had their hands read by him. The skeptical Mark Twain wrote in Cheiro&#x27;s visitor&#x27;s book that he had &quot;exposed my character to me with humiliating accuracy&quot;.

Edward Heron-Allen, an English polymath, published various works including the 1883 book, &quot;Palmistry: A Manual of Cheirosophy&quot;, which is still in print. There were attempts at formulating some sort of scientific basis for the art, most notably in the 1900 publication &quot;The Laws of Scientific Hand Reading&quot; by William Gurney Benham.

In 1970, Parker Brothers published a game designed by Maxine Lucille Fiel called &quot;Touch-Game of Palmistry&quot; which allowed players to do &quot;palm reading and analysis&quot; through selecting cards that matched designated palm features.

== Relationship between Palmistry and Dermatoglyphics ==
Dermatoglyphics and palmistry both study the intricate features of the human palm, like fingerprints, creases, shapes, and mounts, but their purposes differ greatly. Dermatoglyphics is a scientific field examining these patterns for genetic and medical insights, while palmistry interprets them to reveal personality traits and predict future events. The former relies on empirical data, whereas the latter is based on the 12th-century text Samudrika Shastra. Further research is needed to explore any potential links between these two approaches.

==Criticism==
Scientific literature regards palmistry as a pseudoscientific or superstitious belief. Psychologist and noted skeptic Ray Hyman has written:

I started reading palms in my teens as a way to supplement my income from doing magic and mental shows. When I started I did not believe in palmistry. But I knew that to &quot;sell&quot; it I had to act as if I did. After a few years I became a firm believer in palmistry. One day the late Stanley Jaks, who was a professional mentalist and a man I respected, tactfully suggested that it would make an interesting experiment if I deliberately gave readings opposite to what the lines indicated. I tried this out with a few clients. To my surprise and horror my readings were just as successful as ever. Ever since then I have been interested in the powerful forces that convince us, reader and client alike, that something is so when it really isn&#x27;t.

Skeptics often include palmists on lists of alleged psychics who practice cold reading. Cold reading is the practice that allows readers of all kinds, including palmists, to appear psychic by using high-probability guessing and inferring details based on signals or cues from the other person. Although some Christians condemn palmistry as a form of divination, Jewish and Christian traditions are largely ambivalent about divination in general. During the 16th century the Catholic Church condemned the practice of palmistry. However, there is a long tradition of practicing palmistry within both Jewish and Christian mysticism, and some practitioners, such as Comte C. de Saint-Germain, have argued that the Bible does not oppose it.

<doc id="166619" wikidata="Q702397" url="?curid=166619" title="Imperial General Headquarters">
<text>The was part of the Supreme War Council and was established in 1893 to coordinate efforts between the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy during wartime. In terms of function, it was approximately equivalent to the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff and the British Chiefs of Staff Committee.

==History==
The Imperial General Headquarters was established by Imperial Decree 52 on 22 May 1893 under the auspices of creating a central command for both the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office and the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff. The Emperor of Japan who was defined as both Head of State and the Generalissimo of the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces according to the Meiji Constitution of 1889 to 1945, was the head of the Imperial General Headquarters, and was assisted by staff appointed from the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy.

The Imperial General Staff Headquarters was completely independent of the civilian government of the Empire of Japan, including the Cabinet and even the Prime Minister of Japan. Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi was allowed to attend meetings by the express order of Emperor Meiji during the First Sino-Japanese War. However, Prime Minister Katsura Taro, despite his military background, was denied entry to meetings during the subsequent Russo-Japanese War.

After the Lugouqiao Incident in July 1937, Imperial Decree 658 of 18 November 1937 abolished the original Imperial General Headquarters, which was then immediately re-constituted under Military Decree 1, which gave the new Imperial General Headquarters command authority over all military operations during peacetime situations as well as wartime situations.

In November 1937, to bring the chiefs of Army and Navy into closer consultation with his government, Emperor Hirohito established a body known as the Imperial General Headquarters-Government Liaison Conference within Imperial General Headquarters. The Liaison Conferences were intended to assist in integrating the decisions and needs of the two military sections of Imperial General Headquarters with the resources and policies of the rest of the government. Reaching agreement between the Army and Navy on strategic planning was often difficult. When agreement was finally reached on an important strategic issue, the agreement was reduced to writing in a document called a Central Agreement and signed by both Chiefs of Army and Navy General Staffs.

The final decisions of Liaison Conferences were formally disclosed and approved at Imperial Conferences over which Emperor Hirohito presided in person at the Tokyo Imperial Palace.

During the Pacific War, and after the firebombing of Tokyo, the Imperial General Headquarters relocated to an underground facility in the mountains outside Nagano.

With the surrender of Japan, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers ordered the Imperial General Headquarters abolished on 13 September 1945.

==Organization of the Imperial General Headquarters==
Imperial General Headquarters comprised Army and Navy Sections. The Army Section comprised the Chief of Army General Staff and his chief of Army Operations, and the Army Minister. The Navy Section comprised Chief of Navy General Staff, his chief of Navy Operations, and the Navy Minister. In addition, the Inspector-General of Military Training, whose rank was almost on-par with that of the Chiefs of the General Staff, and the Aide-de-camp to the Emperor of Japan were also members.

Middle-ranking officers of Army and Navy General Staff, and Army and Navy Ministry, met from time to time at middle-level liaison or study conferences to discuss Japan&#x27;s strategic war plans, and especially, plans requiring cooperation between the two armed services, outside of the formal meeting in the presence of the Emperor.

Relations between the Japanese Army and Navy were never cordial, and often marked by deep hostility. The Army saw the Soviet Union as Japan&#x27;s greatest threat and for the most part supported the &quot;Hokushin-ron&quot; (Strike North concept) that Japan&#x27;s strategic interests were on the Asian continent. The Navy looked across the Pacific Ocean and saw the United States as the greatest threat, and for the most part supported the &quot;Nanshin-ron&quot; (Strike South concept) that Japan&#x27;s strategic interests were in Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands.

===Organization during World War II===

===Organization of the Imperial Japanese Army – December 8, 1941===
The majority of these troops were stationed in China, Indochina, Japan, Taiwan, and Korea. This includes some 61 divisions, 59 brigades, and 51 air squadrons. Only a fraction of Japan&#x27;s military, 11 to 14 divisions and the South Seas Detachment, were available for the December 1941 operations in South-East Asia and the Pacific.

==&quot;Daihon&#x27;ei Happyou&quot;==
In November 1937, the headquarters started radioing news on the war to the public. They were fairly accurate at first, but their accuracy quickly deteriorated after the severe defeat at Midway and became worse and worse toward the end of the war. As a result, after the war, the phrase &quot;daihon&#x27;ei happyou&quot; (大本営発表, the General Headquarters&#x27; announcement) came to mean &quot;dubious official announcements by authorities&quot; in general to this day.

<text>A doll is a model typically of a human or humanoid character, often used as a toy for children. Dolls have also been used in traditional religious rituals throughout the world. Traditional dolls made of materials such as clay and wood are found in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Europe. The earliest documented dolls go back to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome. They have been made as crude, rudimentary playthings as well as elaborate art. Modern doll manufacturing has its roots in Germany, from the 15th century. With industrialization and new materials such as porcelain and plastic, dolls were increasingly mass-produced. During the 20th century, dolls became increasingly popular as collectibles.

==History, types and materials==

===Early history and traditional dolls ===
The earliest dolls were made from available materials such as clay, stone, wood, bone, ivory, leather, or wax. Archaeological evidence places dolls as the foremost candidate for the oldest known toy. Wooden paddle dolls have been found in Egyptian tombs dating to as early as the 21st century BC. Dolls with movable limbs and removable clothing date back to at least 200 BC. Archaeologists have discovered Greek dolls made of clay and articulated at the hips and shoulders. Rag dolls and stuffed animals were probably also popular, but no known examples of these have survived to the present day. Stories from ancient Greece around 100 AD show that dolls were used by little girls as playthings. Greeks called a doll κόρη, literally meaning &quot;little girl&quot;, and a wax-doll was called δάγυνον, δαγύς and πλαγγών. Often dolls had movable limbs and were called νευρόσπαστα, they were worked by strings or wires.
In ancient Rome, dolls were made of clay, wood or ivory. Dolls have been found in the graves of Roman children. Like children today, the younger members of Roman civilization would have dressed their dolls according to the latest fashions. In Greece and Rome, it was customary for boys to dedicate their toys to the gods when they reached puberty and for girls to dedicate their toys to the goddesses when they married. At marriage the Greek girls dedicated their dolls to Artemis and the Roman girls to Venus, but if they died before marriage their dolls were buried with them.
Rag dolls are traditionally home-made from spare scraps of cloth material. Roman rag dolls have been found dating back to 300 BC.
Traditional dolls are sometimes used as children&#x27;s playthings, but they may also have spiritual, magical and ritual value. There is no defined line between spiritual dolls and toys. In some cultures dolls that had been used in rituals were given to children. They were also used in children&#x27;s education and as carriers of cultural heritage. In other cultures dolls were considered too laden with magical powers to allow children to play with them.

African dolls are used to teach and entertain; they are supernatural intermediaries, and they are manipulated for ritual purposes. Their shape and costume vary according to region and custom. Dolls are frequently handed down from mother to daughter. &quot;Akuaba&quot; are wooden ritual fertility dolls from Ghana and nearby areas. The best known &quot;akuaba&quot; are those of the Ashanti people, whose &quot;akuaba&quot; have large, disc-like heads. Other tribes in the region have their own distinctive style of &quot;akuaba&quot;.

There is a rich history of Japanese dolls dating back to the Dogū figures (8000–200 BCE). and Haniwa funerary figures (300–600 AD). By the eleventh century, dolls were used as playthings as well as for protection and in religious ceremonies. During Hinamatsuri, the doll festival, are displayed. These are made of straw and wood, painted, and dressed in elaborate, many-layered textiles. Daruma dolls are spherical dolls with red bodies and white faces without pupils. They represent Bodhidharma, the East Indian who founded Zen, and are used as good luck charms. Wooden Kokeshi dolls have no arms or legs, but a large head and cylindrical body, representing little girls.

The use of an effigy to perform a spell on someone is documented in African, Native American, and European cultures. Examples of such magical devices include the European poppet and the &quot;nkisi&quot; or &quot;bocio&quot; of West and Central Africa. In European folk magic and witchcraft, poppet dolls are used to represent a person for casting spells on that person. The intention is that whatever actions are performed upon the effigy will be transferred to the subject through sympathetic magic. The practice of sticking pins in &quot;voodoo dolls&quot; have been associated with African-American Hoodoo folk magic. Voodoo dolls are not a feature of Haitian Vodou religion, but have been portrayed as such in popular culture, and stereotypical voodoo dolls are sold to tourists in Haiti. Likely the voodoo doll concept in popular culture is influenced by the European poppet. A kitchen witch is a poppet originating in Northern Europe. It resembles a stereotypical witch or crone and is displayed in residential kitchens as a means to provide good luck and ward off bad spirits.

Hopi Kachina dolls are effigies made of cottonwood that embody the characteristics of the ceremonial Kachina, the masked spirits of the Hopi Native American tribe. Kachina dolls are objects meant to be treasured and studied in order to learn the characteristics of each Kachina. Inuit dolls are made out of soapstone and bone, materials common to the Inuit. Many are clothed with animal fur or skin. Their clothing articulates the traditional style of dress necessary to survive cold winters, wind, and snow. The tea dolls of the Innu people were filled with tea for young girls to carry on long journeys. Apple dolls are traditional North American dolls with a head made from dried apples. In Inca mythology, Sara Mama was the goddess of grain. She was associated with maize that grew in multiples or was similarly strange. These strange plants were sometimes dressed as dolls of Sara Mama. Corn husk dolls are traditional Native American dolls made out of the dried leaves or husk of a corncob. Traditionally, they do not have a face. The making of corn husk dolls was adopted by early European settlers in the United States. Early settlers also made rag dolls and carved wooden dolls, called &quot;Pennywoods&quot;. La última muñeca, or &quot;the last doll&quot;, is a tradition of the &quot;Quinceañera&quot;, the celebration of a girl&#x27;s fifteenth birthday in parts of Latin America. During this ritual the &quot;quinceañera&quot; relinquishes a doll from her childhood to signify that she is no longer in need of such a toy. In the United States, dollmaking became an industry in the 1860s, after the Civil War.

Matryoshka dolls are traditional Russian dolls, consisting of a set of hollow wooden figures that open up and nest inside each other. They typically portray traditional peasants and the first set was carved and painted in 1890. In Germany, clay dolls have been documented as far back as the 13th century, and wooden doll making from the 15th century. Beginning about the 15th century, increasingly elaborate dolls were made for Nativity scene displays, chiefly in Italy. Dolls with detailed, fashionable clothes were sold in France in the 16th century, though their bodies were often crudely constructed. The German and Dutch peg wooden dolls were cheap and simply made and were popular toys for poorer children in Europe from the 16th century. Wood continued to be the dominant material for dolls in Europe until the 19th century. Through the 18th and 19th centuries, wood was increasingly combined with other materials, such as leather, wax and porcelain and the bodies made more articulate. It is unknown when dolls&#x27; glass eyes first appeared, but brown was the dominant eye color for dolls up until the Victorian era when blue eyes became more popular, inspired by Queen Victoria.
Dolls, puppets and masks allow ordinary people to state what is impossible in the real situation; In Iran for example during Qajar era, people criticised the politics and social conditions of Ahmad-Shah&#x27;s reign via puppetry without any fear of punishment. According to the Islamic rules, the act of dancing in public especially for women, is a taboo. But dolls or puppets have free and independent identities and are able to do what is not feasible for the real person. Layli is a hinged dancing doll, which is popular among the Lur people of Iran. The name Layli is originated from the Middle East folklore and love story, Layla and Majnun. Layli is the symbol of the beloved who is spiritually beautiful. Layli also represents and maintains a cultural tradition, which is gradually vanishing in urban life.

===Industrial era===
During the 19th century, dolls&#x27; heads were often made of porcelain and combined with a body of leather, cloth, wood, or composite materials, such as papier-mâché or composition, a mix of pulp, sawdust, glue and similar materials. With the advent of polymer and plastic materials in the 20th century, doll making largely shifted to these materials. The low cost, ease of manufacture, and durability of plastic materials meant new types of dolls could be mass-produced at a lower price. The earliest materials were rubber and celluloid. From the mid-20th century, soft vinyl became the dominant material, in particular for children&#x27;s dolls. Beginning in the 20th century, both porcelain and plastic dolls are made directly for the adult collectors market. Synthetic resins such as polyurethane resemble porcelain in texture and are used for collectible dolls.

Colloquially the terms &quot;porcelain doll&quot;, &quot;bisque doll&quot; and &quot;china doll&quot; are sometimes used interchangeably. But collectors make a distinction between china dolls, made of glazed porcelain, and bisque dolls, made of unglazed bisque or biscuit porcelain. A typical antique china doll has a white glazed porcelain head with painted molded hair and a body made of cloth or leather. The name comes from &quot;china&quot; being used to refer to the material porcelain. They were mass-produced in Germany, peaking in popularity between 1840 and 1890 and selling in the millions. Parian dolls were also made in Germany, from around 1860 to 1880. They are made of white porcelain similar to china dolls but the head is not dipped in glaze and has a matte finish. Bisque dolls are characterized by their realistic, skin-like matte finish. They had their peak of popularity between 1860 and 1900 with French and German dolls. Antique German and French bisque dolls from the 19th century were often made as children&#x27;s playthings, but contemporary bisque dolls are predominantly made directly for the collectors market. Realistic, lifelike wax dolls were popular in Victorian England.

Up through the middle of the 19th century, European dolls were predominantly made to represent grown-ups. Childlike dolls and the later ubiquitous baby doll did not appear until around 1850. But, by the late 19th century, baby and childlike dolls had overtaken the market. By about 1920, baby dolls typically were made of composition with a cloth body. The hair, eyes, and mouth were painted. A voice box was sewn into the body that cried ma-ma when the doll was tilted, giving them the name Mama dolls. During 1923, 80% of all dolls sold to children in the United States were Mama dolls.
Paper dolls are cut out of paper, with separate clothes that are usually held onto the dolls by folding tabs. They often reflect contemporary styles, and 19th century ballerina paper dolls were among the earliest celebrity dolls. The 1930s Shirley Temple doll sold millions and was one of the most successful celebrity dolls. Small celluloid Kewpie dolls, based on illustrations by Rose O&#x27;Neill, were popular in the early 20th century. Madame Alexander created the first collectible doll based on a licensed character – Scarlett O&#x27;Hara from &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.

Contemporary dollhouses have their roots in European &quot;baby house&quot; display cases from the 17th century. Early dollhouses were all handmade, but, following the Industrial Revolution and World War II, they were increasingly mass-produced and became more affordable. Children&#x27;s dollhouses during the 20th century have been made of tin litho, plastic, and wood. Contemporary houses for adult collectors are typically made of wood.

The earliest modern stuffed toys were made in 1880. They differ from earlier rag dolls in that they are made of plush fur-like fabric and commonly portray animals rather than humans. Teddy bears first appeared in 1902–1903.

Black dolls have been designed to resemble dark-skinned persons varying from stereotypical to more accurate portrayals. Rag dolls made by American slaves served as playthings for slave children. Golliwogg was a children&#x27;s book rag doll character in the late 19th century that was widely reproduced as a toy. The doll has very black skin, eyes rimmed in white, clown lips, and frizzy hair, and has been described as an anti-black caricature. Early mass-produced black dolls were typically dark versions of their white counterparts. The earliest American black dolls with realistic African facial features were made in the 1960s.
Fashion dolls are primarily designed to be dressed to reflect fashion trends and are usually modeled after teen girls or adult women. The earliest fashion dolls were French bisque dolls from the mid-19th century. Contemporary fashion dolls are typically made of vinyl. Barbie, from the American toy company Mattel, dominated the market from her inception in 1959. Bratz was the first doll to challenge Barbie&#x27;s dominance, reaching forty percent of the market in 2006.

Plastic action figures, often representing superheroes, are primarily marketed to boys. Fashion dolls and action figures are often part of a media franchise that may include films, TV, video games and other related merchandise. Bobblehead dolls are collectible plastic dolls with heads connected to the body by a spring or hook in such a way that the head bobbles. They often portray baseball players or other athletes.
===Modern era===

With the introduction of computers and the Internet, virtual and online dolls appeared. These are often similar to traditional paper dolls and enable users to design virtual dolls and drag and drop clothes onto dolls or images of actual people to play dress up. These include KiSS, Stardoll and Dollz.

Also with the advent of the Internet, collectible dolls are customized and sold or displayed online. Reborn dolls are vinyl dolls that have been customized to resemble a human baby with as much realism as possible. They are often sold online through sites such as eBay. Asian ball-jointed dolls (BJDs) are cast in polyurethane synthetic resin in a style that has been described as both realistic and influenced by anime. Asian BJDs and Asian fashion dolls such as Pullip and Blythe are often customized and photographed. The photos are shared in online communities.
==Uses, appearances and issues==
Since ancient times, dolls have played a central role in magic and religious rituals and have been used as representations of deities. Dolls have also traditionally been toys for children. Dolls are also collected by adults, for their nostalgic value, beauty, historical importance or financial value. Antique dolls originally made as children&#x27;s playthings have become collector&#x27;s items. Nineteenth-century bisque dolls made by French manufacturers such as Bru and Jumeau may be worth almost $22,000 today.

Dolls have traditionally been made as crude, rudimentary playthings as well as with elaborate, artful design. They have been created as folk art in cultures around the globe, and, in the 20th century, art dolls began to be seen as high art. Artist Hans Bellmer made surrealistic dolls that had interchangeable limbs in 1930s and 1940s Germany as opposition to the Nazi party&#x27;s idolization of a perfect Aryan body. East Village artist Greer Lankton became famous in the 1980s for her theatrical window displays of drug addicted, anorexic and mutant dolls.

Lifelike or anatomically correct dolls are used by health professionals, medical schools and social workers to train doctors and nurses in various health procedures or investigate cases of all sexual abuse of children. Artists sometimes use jointed wooden mannequins in drawing the human figure. Many ordinary doll brands are also anatomically correct, although most types of dolls are degenitalized.
Egli-Figuren are a type of doll that originated in Switzerland in 1964 for telling Bible stories.

In Western society, a gender difference in the selection of toys has been observed and studied. Action figures that represent traditional masculine traits are popular with boys, who are more likely to choose toys that have some link to tools, transportation, garages, machines and military equipment. Dolls for girls tend to represent feminine traits and come with such accessories as clothing, kitchen appliances, utensils, furniture and jewelry.

Pediophobia is a fear of dolls or similar objects. Psychologist Ernst Jentsch theorized that uncanny feelings arise when there is an intellectual uncertainty about whether an object is alive or not. Sigmund Freud further developed on these theories. Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori expanded on these theories to develop the uncanny valley hypothesis: if an object is obviously enough non-human, its human characteristics will stand out and be endearing; however, if that object reaches a certain threshold of human-like appearance, its non-human characteristics will stand out, and be disturbing.

===Doll hospitals===
A doll hospital is a workshop that specializes in the restoration or repair of dolls. Doll hospitals can be found in countries around the world. One of the oldest doll hospitals was established in Lisbon, Portugal in 1830, and another in Melbourne, reputedly the first such establishment in Australia, was founded in 1888. There is a Doll Doctors Association in the United States. Henri Launay, who has been repairing dolls at his shop in northeast Paris for 43 years, says he has restored over 30,000 dolls in the course of his career. Most of the clients are not children, but adults in their 50s and 60s. Some doll brands, such as American Girl and Madame Alexander, also offer doll hospital services for their own dolls.

===Dolls and children&#x27;s tales===
Many books deal with dolls tales, including &quot;Wilhelmina. The Adventures of a Dutch Doll&quot;, by Nora Pitt-Taylor, pictured by Gladys Hall. Rag dolls have featured in a number of children&#x27;s stories, such as the 19th century character Golliwogg in &quot;The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls and a Golliwogg&quot; by Bertha Upton and Florence K. Upton and Raggedy Ann in the books by Johnny Gruelle, first published in 1918. &quot;The Lonely Doll&quot; is a 1957 children&#x27;s book by Canadian author Dare Wright. The story, told through text and photographs, is about a doll named Edith and two teddy bears.

<text>David Russell Burge (March 25, 1930 – April 1, 2013) was an American pianist, conductor and composer. As a performer, he was noted for championing contemporary pieces. The &quot;New York Times&quot; called him &quot;one of America&#x27;s important pianists,&quot; and his concerts were described as &quot;an overwhelming experience&quot; (&quot;Washington Post&quot;) presenting &quot;masterful artistry&quot; (&quot;Baltimore Sun&quot;).

==Biography==

Burge was born in Evanston, Illinois. He studied at Northwestern University for his bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees. Later he attained the Doctor of Musical Arts degree and an artist&#x27;s diploma from the Eastman School of Music, and he studied at the Cherubini Conservatory, Florence as a Fulbright scholar.

While on the faculty at the University of Colorado in Boulder during the 1960s and 1970s, Burge founded and directed the Colorado Festival of Contemporary Music, and he was also Musical Director and Conductor of the Boulder Philharmonic Orchestra.

During that period, George Crumb collaborated with Burge while writing &quot;Makrokosmos&quot;, a series of four volumes of pieces for piano. &quot;Makrokosmos, Volume I&quot; was composed in 1972 for Burge, who had previously commissioned and premiered Crumb&#x27;s Five Pieces for Piano (1962). The Nonesuch recording of &quot;Makrokosmos, Vol. I&quot; was nominated for a Grammy. Burge also worked with composers such as Ernst Krenek, Luciano Berio, and Karlheinz Stockhausen, and singers including Cathy Berberian and Bethany Beardslee.

After leaving the University of Colorado, he chaired the Piano Department at the Eastman School of Music for many years. Over his career, he gave more than 1,000 concerts in the United States, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, composed more than 100 works, authored the book &quot;Twentieth-Century Piano Music&quot; (Shirmer Books, 1990), wrote prize-winning columns for &quot;Keyboard Magazine&quot;, &quot;Clavier&quot; and &quot;The Piano Quarterly.&quot;

In 1993, Burge moved to San Diego with his wife, Liliane Choney, and served as composer-in-residence for the San Diego Ballet. His ballet scores became increasingly well known outside the San Diego area, with over thirty performances in the United States and abroad.

In early 2002, Burge and Crumb were appointed to a joint residency at Arizona State University. He accepted visiting professorships not only at many universities and conservatories in the United States but also in Denmark, Turkey, New Zealand, Canada, Australia, Sweden, and Korea.

Burge died from a heart attack on April 1, 2013 in Warwick, Rhode Island.

<doc id="166628" wikidata="Q453956" url="?curid=166628" title="Alan Freed">
<text>Albert James &quot;Alan&quot; Freed (December 15, 1921 – January 20, 1965) was an American disc jockey. He also produced and promoted large traveling concerts with various acts, helping to spread the importance of rock and roll music throughout North America, including popularizing the term &quot;rock and roll&quot;.

In 1986, Freed was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. His &quot;role in breaking down racial barriers in U.S. pop culture in the 1950s, by leading white and black kids to listen to the same music, put the radio personality &#x27;at the vanguard&#x27; and made him &#x27;a really important figure&#x27;&quot;, according to the executive director.
==Early years==
Freed was born to a Welsh-American mother, Maude Palmer, and a Russian Jewish immigrant father, Charles S. Freed, in Windber, Pennsylvania. In 1933, Freed&#x27;s family moved to Salem, Ohio, where Freed attended Salem High School, graduating in 1940. While Freed was in high school, he formed a band called the Sultans of Swing in which he played the trombone. Freed&#x27;s initial ambition was to be a bandleader; however, an ear infection put an end to that dream.

While attending Ohio State University, Freed became interested in radio. Freed served in the US Army during World War II and worked as a DJ on Armed Forces Radio. Soon after World War II, Freed landed broadcasting jobs at smaller radio stations, including WKST (New Castle, Pennsylvania); WKBN (Youngstown, Ohio); and WAKR (Akron, Ohio), where, in 1945, he became a local favorite for playing hot jazz and pop recordings.

==Career==
Freed was the first radio disc jockey and concert producer who frequently played and promoted rock and roll; he popularized the phrase &quot;rock and roll&quot; on mainstream radio in the early 1950s. The term &quot;rock and roll&quot; already existed in the early 1940s, but it remained obscure. For example, one of the term&#x27;s earliest uses was by a music critic and record reviewer for Billboard named Maurie Orodenker (1908-1993). In the May 30, 1942 issue (page 25) of &quot;Billboard&quot;, in his review of the song &quot;Rock Me&quot; by Thomas A. Dorsey (1899-1993) (which song appeared on a record released in May 1942 by Lucky Millinder and His Orchestra with Rosetta Tharpe), Orodenker described the vocals of Sister Rosetta Tharpe as &quot;rock-and-roll spiritual singing.&quot;

Several sources suggest that he first discovered the term (as a euphemism for sexual intercourse) on the record &quot;Sixty Minute Man&quot; by Billy Ward and his Dominoes. The lyrics include the line, &quot;I rock &#x27;em, roll &#x27;em all night long&quot;, however, Freed did not accept that inspiration (or that meaning of the expression) in interviews, and explained his view of the term as follows: &quot;Rock &#x27;n roll is really swing with a modern name. It began on the levees and plantations, took in folk songs, and features blues and rhythm&quot;.

He helped bridge the gap of segregation among young teenage Americans, presenting music by black artists (rather than cover versions by white artists) on his radio program, and arranging live concerts attended by racially mixed audiences. Freed appeared in several motion pictures as himself. In the 1956 film &quot;Rock, Rock, Rock&quot;, Freed tells the audience that &quot;rock and roll is a river of music which has absorbed many streams: rhythm and blues, jazz, ragtime, cowboy songs, country songs, folk songs. All have contributed greatly to the big beat.&quot;

===WAKR Akron===
In June 1945, Alan Freed joined WAKR (1590 AM) in Akron, Ohio, and quickly became a star announcer. Dubbed &quot;The Old Knucklehead&quot;, Freed had up to five hours of airtime every day on the station by June 1948: the daytime &quot;Jukebox Serenade&quot;, the early-evening &quot;Wax Works&quot; and the nightly &quot;Request Review&quot;. Freed also had brief run-ins with management and was at one point temporarily fired for violating studio rules and failing to show up for work for several days in a row.

At the height of his popularity in 1948, Freed signed a contract extension with WAKR that included a non-compete clause inserted by owner S. Bernard Berk, preventing Freed from working at any station within a radius of of Akron for a full year. Freed left WAKR on February 12, 1950, and after one program on competing station WADC (1350 AM) several days later, Berk and WAKR sued Freed to enforce the clause. Freed repeatedly lost in court, even after appealing his case to the Supreme Court of Ohio; Berk&#x27;s successful implementation of the non-compete is now recognized within the industry as a model for broadcasters regarding on-air talent contracts.

===WJW Cleveland===
In the late 1940s, while working at WAKR, Freed met Cleveland record store owner Leo Mintz. Record Rendezvous, one of Cleveland&#x27;s largest record stores, had begun selling rhythm and blues records. Mintz told Freed that he had noticed increased interest in the records at his store, and encouraged him to play them on the radio.
In 1951, having already joined television station WXEL (channel 9, now WJW channel 8) in the middle of 1950 as an announcer, Freed moved to Cleveland, which at from Akron was within the range of the still in force non-compete clause. However, in April, through the help of William Shipley, RCA&#x27;s Northern Ohio distributor, he was released from the non-compete clause. He was then hired by WJW radio for a midnight program sponsored by Main Line, the RCA Distributor, and Record Rendezvous. Freed peppered his speech with hipster language, and, with a rhythm and blues record called &quot;Moondog&quot; as his theme song, broadcast R&amp;B hits into the night.

Mintz proposed buying airtime on Cleveland radio station WJW (850 AM), which would be devoted entirely to R&amp;B recordings, with Freed as host. On July 11, 1951, Freed began playing rhythm and blues records on WJW. While R&amp;B records were played for many years on lower-powered, inner city radio stations aimed at African-Americans, this is arguably the first time that authentic R&amp;B was featured regularly on a major, mass audience station. Freed called his show &quot;The Moondog House&quot; and billed himself as &quot;The King of the Moondoggers&quot;. He had been inspired by an instrumental piece called &quot;Moondog Symphony&quot; that had been recorded by New York-based composer and street musician Louis T. Hardin, known professionally as Moondog. Freed adopted the record as his show&#x27;s theme music. His on-air manner was energetic, in contrast to many contemporary radio presenters of traditional pop music, who tended to sound more subdued and low-key in manner. He addressed his listeners as if they were all part of a make-believe kingdom of hipsters, united in their love for black music. He also began popularizing the phrase &quot;rock and roll&quot; to describe the music he played.

Later that year, Freed promoted dances and concerts featuring the music he was playing on the radio. He was one of the organizers of a five-act show called &quot;The Moondog Coronation Ball&quot; on March 21, 1952, at the Cleveland Arena. This event is now considered to have been the first major rock and roll concert. Crowds attended in numbers far beyond the arena&#x27;s capacity, and the concert was shut down early due to overcrowding and a near-riot. Freed gained notoriety from the incident. WJW immediately increased the airtime allotted to Freed&#x27;s program, and his popularity soared.

In those days, Cleveland was considered by the music industry to be a &quot;breakout&quot; city, where national trends first appeared in a regional market. Freed&#x27;s popularity made the pop music business take notice. Soon, tapes of Freed&#x27;s program, &quot;Moondog&quot;, began to air in the New York City area over station WNJR 1430 (now WNSW), in Newark, New Jersey.

===New York stations===
In July 1954, following his success on the air in Cleveland, Freed moved to WINS (1010 AM) in New York City. Hardin, the original Moondog, later took a court action suit against WINS for damages against Freed for infringement in 1956, arguing prior claim to the name &quot;Moondog&quot;, under which he had been composing since 1947. Hardin collected a $6,000 judgment from Freed, as well as an agreement to give up further usage of the name Moondog. Freed left the station in May 1958 &quot;after a riot at a dance in Boston featuring Jerry Lee Lewis&quot;. WINS eventually became an around-the-clock Top 40 rock and roll radio station, and would remain so until April 19, 1965, long after Freed left and three months after he had died—when it became an all-news outlet.

Earlier, in 1956, Freed had hosted &quot;The Camel Rock and Roll Dance Party&quot;, so named for the sponsor Camel cigarettes. The half hour program headlined Count Basie and his Orchestra and later Sam The Man Taylor and His Orchestra, and featured weekly rock n roll guests such as LaVern Baker, Clyde McPhatter and Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers. The radio program was also referred to as &quot;Alan Freed&#x27;s Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Dance Party&quot; on CBS Radio from New York.

Freed also worked at WABC (AM) starting in May 1958 but was fired from that station on November 21, 1959, after refusing to sign a statement for the FCC that he had never accepted payola bribes.

He subsequently arrived at a small Los Angeles station, KDAY (1580 AM) and worked there for about one year.

===Film and television===
Freed also appeared in a number of pioneering rock and roll motion pictures during this period. These jukebox musicals were often welcomed with tremendous enthusiasm by teenagers because they brought visual depictions of their favorite American acts to the big screen, years before music videos would present the same sort of image on the small television screen.

Freed appeared in several motion pictures that presented many of the big musical acts of his day, including:
* 1956: &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; featuring Freed, Bill Haley &amp; His Comets, The Platters, Freddie Bell and the Bellboys, Lisa Gaye.
* 1956: &quot;Rock, Rock, Rock&quot; featuring Freed, Teddy Randazzo, Tuesday Weld, Chuck Berry, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, Johnny Burnette, LaVern Baker, The Flamingos, The Moonglows.
* 1957: &quot;Mister Rock and Roll&quot; featuring Freed, Rocky Graziano and Teddy Randazzo, Lionel Hampton, Ferlin Husky, Frankie Lymon, Little Richard, Brook Benton, Chuck Berry, Clyde McPhatter, LaVern Baker, Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins.
* 1957: &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock the Rock&quot; featuring Freed, Bill Haley and His Comets, Alan Dale, Little Richard and the Upsetters, The Treniers, Dave Appell and His Applejacks.
* 1959: &quot;Go, Johnny Go!&quot; featuring Freed, Jimmy Clanton, Chuck Berry, Ritchie Valens, Eddie Cochran, The Flamingos, Jackie Wilson, The Cadillacs, Sandy Stewart, Jo Ann Campbell, Harvey Fuqua and The Moonglows. Chuck Berry also played Freed&#x27;s pal and sidekick, a groundbreaking role in those days.

Freed was given a weekly primetime TV series, &quot;The Big Beat&quot;, which premiered on ABC on July 12, 1957. The show was scheduled for a summer run, with the understanding that if there were enough viewers, it would continue into the 1957–58 television season. Although the ratings for the show were strong, it was suddenly terminated. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; summarized the end of the program as follows. &quot;Four episodes into &quot;The Big Beat&quot;, Freed&#x27;s prime-time TV music series on ABC, an uproar was caused when African-American artist Frankie Lymon was seen on TV dancing with a white audience member&quot;. Two more episodes were aired but the show was suddenly cancelled. Some sources indicate that the cancellation was triggered by an uproar among ABC&#x27;s local affiliates in the South.

During this period, Freed was seen on other popular programs of the day, including &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, where he is seen defending the new &quot;rock and roll&quot; sound to the panelists, who were all clearly more comfortable with swing music: Polly Bergen, Ralph Bellamy, Hy Gardner and Kitty Carlisle.

===Legal trouble, payola scandal===

In 1958, Freed faced controversy in Boston when he told the audience, &quot;It looks like the Boston police don&#x27;t want you to have a good time.&quot; As a result, Freed was arrested and charged with inciting to riot, and was fired from his job at WINS.

Freed&#x27;s career was significantly affected when it was shown that he had accepted payola (payments from record companies to play specific records), a practice that was highly controversial at the time. He initially denied taking payola but later admitted to his fans that he had accepted bribes. Freed refused to sign a statement for the FCC while working at WABC (AM) to state that he never received bribes. That led to his termination.

In 1960, payola was made illegal. In December 1962, after being charged on multiple counts of commercial bribery, Freed pleaded guilty to two counts of commercial bribery and was fined three hundred dollars and given a suspended sentence.

There was also a series of conflict of interest allegations, that he had taken songwriting co-credits that he did not deserve. The most notable example was Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Maybellene&quot;. Taking partial credit allowed him to receive part of a song&#x27;s royalties, which he could help increase by heavily promoting the record on his own program. Berry was eventually able to regain the writing credit. 

The Flamingos also claimed that Freed had wrongly taken writing credit for some of their songs. In another example, however, Harvey Fuqua of The Moonglows insisted Freed&#x27;s name was not merely a credit on the song &quot;Sincerely&quot; and that he did actually co-write it, although other band members disagreed. 

In 1964 Freed was indicted by a federal grand jury for tax evasion and ordered to pay $37,920 in taxes on income he had allegedly not reported. Most of that income was said to be from payola sources.

==Later years and death==
Because of the negative publicity from the payola scandal, no prestigious station would employ Freed, and he moved to the West Coast in 1960, where he worked at KDAY/1580 in Santa Monica, California. In 1962, after KDAY refused to allow him to promote &quot;rock and roll&quot; stage shows, Freed moved to WQAM in Miami, Florida, arriving in August 1962. Recognizing that his career in major markets might be over, he drank heavily and the job lasted only two months.

During 1964, he returned to the Los Angeles area for a short stint at the Long Beach station KNOB/97.9.

Living in the Racquet Club Estates neighborhood of Palm Springs, California, Freed died on January 20, 1965, from uremia and cirrhosis brought on by alcoholism, at the age of 43. Prior to his death, the Internal Revenue Service had continued to maintain that he owed $38,000 for tax evasion, but Freed did not have the financial means to pay that amount.

He was initially interred in the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York. In March 2002, Judith Fisher Freed, his daughter-in-law, carried his ashes to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. On August 1, 2014, the Hall of Fame asked Alan Freed&#x27;s son, Lance Freed, to remove the ashes permanently, which he did. The Freed family later interred his ashes at Cleveland&#x27;s Lake View Cemetery beneath a jukebox-shaped memorial featuring Freed&#x27;s image.

==Personal life==
On August 22, 1943, Freed married his first wife Betty Lou Bean. They had two children, daughter Alana and son Lance, and divorced on December 2, 1949. On August 12, 1950, Freed married Marjorie J. Hess, with whom he had two children, daughter Sieglinde and son Alan Freed, Jr. They divorced on July 25, 1958. On August 8, 1958, Freed married Inga Lil Boling. They remained together until his death.

==In popular culture==
An archived sample of Freed&#x27;s introduction on the Moondog Show was used by Ian Hunter in the opening of the song &quot;Cleveland Rocks&quot;, from Hunter&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;You&#x27;re Never Alone with a Schizophrenic&quot;.

The 1978 motion picture &quot;American Hot Wax&quot; was inspired by Freed&#x27;s contribution to the rock and roll scene. Although director Floyd Mutrux created a fictionalized account of Freed&#x27;s last days in New York radio by using real-life elements outside of their actual chronology, the film does accurately convey the fond relationship between Freed, the musicians he promoted, and the audiences who listened to them. The film starred Tim McIntire as Freed and included cameo appearances by Chuck Berry, Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins, Frankie Ford and Jerry Lee Lewis, performing in the recording studio and concert sequences.
Freed was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1991. The organization&#x27;s website posted this note: &quot;He became internationally known for promoting African-American rhythm and blues music on the radio in the United States and Europe under the name of rock and roll&quot;.

In the early 1960s, Freed&#x27;s career was destroyed by the payola scandal that hit the broadcasting industry, as well as by allegations of taking credit for songs he did not write and by his chronic alcoholism.

On January 23, 1986, Freed was part of the first group inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland. In 1988, he was also posthumously inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame. On December 10, 1991, Freed was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The VH1 series &quot;Behind The Music&quot; produced an episode on Freed featuring Roger Steffens. In 1998, The Official Website of Alan Freed went online with the jumpstart from Brian Levant and Michael Ochs archives as well as a home page biography written by Ben Fong-Torres. On February 26, 2002, Freed was honored at the Grammy Awards with the Trustees Award. In 2017 he was inducted into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame in Detroit, Michigan.

Freed was used as a character in Stephen King&#x27;s short story &quot;You Know They Got a Hell of a Band&quot;, and was portrayed by Mitchell Butel in its television adaptation for the &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes&quot; mini-series. He was the subject of a 1999 television movie, &quot;Mr. Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll: The Alan Freed Story&quot;, starring Judd Nelson and directed by Andy Wolk. The 1997 film &quot;Telling Lies in America&quot; stars Kevin Bacon as a disc jockey with a loose resemblance to Freed. Jack McBrayer portrayed Freed on the Comedy Central show Drunk History in a segment on Freed&#x27;s legacy. The Cleveland Cavaliers&#x27; mascot Moondog is named in honor of Freed.

Freed is mentioned in The Ramones&#x27; song &quot;Do You Remember Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Radio?&quot; as one of the band&#x27;s idols. Other songs that reference Freed include &quot;The King of Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; by Terry Cashman and Tommy West, &quot;Ballrooms of Mars&quot; by Marc Bolan, &quot;They Used to Call it Dope&quot; by Public Enemy, &quot;Payola Blues&quot; by Neil Young, &quot;Done Too Soon&quot; by Neil Diamond, &quot;The Ballad of Dick Clark&quot; by Skip Battin, a member of the Byrds, and &quot;This Is Not Goodbye, Just Goodnight&quot; by Kill Your Idols.

The 2023 off-Broadway musical &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Man&quot; follows Freed&#x27;s rise and influence in radio using various songs that he played on the radio. Constantine Maroulis played Freed.

In 2024, RiffTrax produced and published a humorous commentary for the 1956 musical drama film &quot;Rock, Rock, Rock!&quot;, in which Freed appeared on as a show presenter. 

==Legacy==
Freed&#x27;s importance to the musical genre is confirmed by his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and his 1991 star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The DJ was also inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 1988. The organization&#x27;s Web page states that &quot;despite his personal tragedies, Freed&#x27;s innovations helped make rock and roll and the Top-40 format permanent fixtures of radio&quot;.

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 2015 recalled &quot;Freed&#x27;s sizable contributions to rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and to teenagers&#x27; more tolerant view of integration in the 1950s&quot;. The publication praised the help he gave to &quot;hundreds of black and white artists&quot; and said that &quot;his tireless efforts helped create thousands of jobs for studio musicians, engineers, record producers, concert promoters and instrument manufacturers&quot;.

One source said that &quot;No man had as much influence on the coming culture of our society in such a short period of time as Alan Freed, the real King of Rock n Roll&quot;. Another source summarized his contribution as follows:

Alan Freed has secured a place in American music history as the first important rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll disc jockey. His ability to tap into and promote the emerging black musical styles of the 1950s to a white mainstream audience is seen as a vital step in rock&#x27;s increasing dominance over American culture.

The board of directors of the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame inducted Alan Freed into the class of 2017.

<text>Patria Plc (, ) is a Finnish provider of defence, security and aviation life-cycle support services. Patria is owned 50.1% by the Finnish government and 49.9% by Norwegian defense group Kongsberg Defense &amp; Aerospace AS.

==Operating model==
In accordance with the new growth strategy Patria&#x27;s operating model and organisation have been renewed in the beginning of 2022. In the new operating model Patria&#x27;s target is to utilise all Patria people&#x27;s competences comprehensively. The operating model with business units (excl. Millog) is dissolved and a unified model consisting of strong core functions – Finland, Global, Portfolio and Operations – were created instead:

Finland Division is responsible for the Finnish accounts with focus on the Finnish Defence Forces. Finland consists of four business areas: Air force, Army, Navy and Joint &amp; Security.

Global Division is responsible for accounts outside Finland. Global consists of market areas Nordics, Europe, and World.

Portfolio is responsible for products and services as well as their development and sales support, consisting of six product and service lines: Fleet Availability, Life cycle management, Training &amp; User Support, C5ISTAR, Mission Capability as well as New Products and Services.

Operations is responsible for production and supply chain consisting of four production lines: Airframe &amp; Structure Operations, Engine, Component &amp; Training Operations, Land Operations and System &amp; Integration Operations.

==Highlights==
In June 2023, Patria and Lockheed Martin signed the first Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) for direct work within Finland&#x27;s F-35 industrial participation programme. This MoA covers the contractual framework for F-35 forward fuselage assemblies in Finland by Patria.

Patria launched in the beginning of 2022 its new growth strategy which aims at ambitious growth by the end of 2025. Also a new operating model to support the growth strategy was also prepared and was taken into use at the beginning of 2022. Cooperation negotiations covering the whole Patria were conducted in good cooperation between all personnel groups and the company.

Patria celebrated its 100-year anniversary in 2021. The theme of the anniversary was &quot;The foundation for a secure future&quot;. History provides a strong foundation for a safe future, growth, working together and success.

The decision on Finland&#x27;s future F-35 fighter jets in 2021 is a significant opportunity for Patria, and the company has been actively involved in the preparations supporting the Finnish Defence Administration and the HX programme. The main task has been ensuring national security of supply, maintenance of the equipment and meeting industrial cooperation requirements. The fighter procurement decision will also open Patria access to the global F-35 supply chain.

In 2021, Finland and Latvia signed a frame agreement with Patria for a production phase management of the joint 6x6 armoured vehicle system. In addition, Latvia and Patria signed a delivery contract for over 200 6x6 armoured personnel carriers developed in the joint development programme including also support and training systems. The vehicle deliveries will take place between 2021 and 2029. Finland and Patria also signed a letter of intent for Finland&#x27;s future serial deliveries.

As part of the European Defence Industrial Development Programme (EDIDP), Patria was selected to lead a defence industry consortium developing future armoured platforms and upgrading existing ground combat capabilities in 2021. The consortium comprises 19 leading defence companies from different EU countries.

==History==
Patria&#x27;s history begins in 1921 with the establishment of the Finnish Air Force Aircraft Factory at Suomenlinna. The operations begin with licensed manufacturing of the German Hansa-Brandenburg aircraft, with the total production volume between 1922 and 1926 amounting to 120 aircraft. Patria&#x27;s centenary issue describes the company&#x27;s history.

During March 2016, it was announced that Norwegian defense group Kongsberg Defense &amp; Aerospace AS had agreed terms to purchase a 49.9% stake in Patria; Walter Qvam, Kongsberg chief executive, stated that the company was keen to leverage new advantages from the deal, including Patria&#x27;s 50 per cent ownership in Norwegian ammunition manufacturer Nammo. The transaction placed a total value of 283.5 million euros on Patria.

During 2001, Patria had secured contracts to build several elements of the NHIndustries NH90 helicopter, such as the rear fuselage, rear ramp, sponsons and sliding doors; the firm also signed Memorandum of understanding to perform final assembly of both the helicopter and its engines. In March 2008, deliveries of Finland&#x27;s NH90 commenced; deliveries had been delayed from an initial 2004 date thus, to minimize further delay, helicopters were first delivered to an Initial Operational Configuration (IOC-) and Nearly Operational Configuration (IOC+), to be later modified by Patria into a Final Operational Configuration (FOC). In September 2011, the Finnish Defence Forces and Patria signed an agreement to provide ballistic protection for onboard personnel across the NH90 fleet. On 18 June 2015, delivery of the final Finnish NH90 took place.

Patria has produced components for numerous aircraft manufacturers; it has manufactured elements of the Airbus A380, the world&#x27;s largest passenger airliner, as well as being a long-term supplier to the Airbus A320 family and the Embraer ERJ-145. Patria has also produced components for multiple programmes headed by the European Space Agency. During late 2004, the company was actively perusing work on Airbus&#x27; A350 XWB and A400M Atlas, as well as Boeing&#x27;s 787.

Patria also provides support and maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) services for various aircraft. During 2009, it won a contract to modernise the Finnish Air Force&#x27;s 49 BAE Systems Hawk 51/51As with CMC Electronics&#x27;s Cockpit 4000 avionics suite; months later, Patria was awarded a second contract to upgrade the avionics of 18 Finnish Hawk 66s. Furthermore, it has made offers to supply and support Hawks for foreign operators, including a bid for the Polish Air Force in 2011. In March 2014, the company partnered with Swiss aerospace company RUAG to offer MRO services to McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet operators worldwide.

<doc id="166636" wikidata="Q1818980" url="?curid=166636" title="Leonard Chess">
<text>Leonard Samuel Chess (born Lejzor Szmuel Czyż; March 12, 1917 – October 16, 1969) was a Polish-American record company executive and the founder of Chess Records alongside his brother Phil. He was influential in the development of the recording industry, and electric blues, Chicago blues, and rock and roll.

== Early life ==
Chess was born to Polish-Jewish parents in Motal, now in Belarus. He and his brother, Fiszel, sister, Malka, and mother arrived in New York in 1928 from Poland. They quickly went to Chicago to join their father, Joseph, who was already engaged in the liquor business, which was illegal at the height of Prohibition and controlled in Chicago by Al Capone. The family name was changed to Chess, with Lejzor becoming Leonard and Fiszel becoming Philip.

== Chess Records ==
Leonard and his brother Phil became involved in the black nightclub scene on the South Side of Chicago in 1938 running a series of jazz clubs, culminating in the Macomba Lounge. In 1947, Leonard became associated with Aristocrat Records, increasing his share in the company over time; eventually he and Phil would acquire complete control. The Chess brothers moved the company away from black pop and jazz and other genres into down home blues music with artists such as Muddy Waters. In 1950, the Chess brothers renamed the company Chess Records. &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot; (Gene Ammons), &quot;Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot; (Muddy Waters), and &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; (Jimmy Rogers) were among the first releases on the new label. Leonard Chess played bass drum on one of Muddy Waters&#x27; sessions in 1951, specifically on the tracks &quot;She Moves Me&quot; and &quot;Still A Fool&quot;.

Chess contacted Sam Phillips (of Sun Records) to help find and record new artists from the South. Phillips supplied Chess with recordings by Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Rufus Thomas, and Doctor Ross among others. Of these, Howlin&#x27; Wolf in particular became very popular, and Chess Records had to vie for him with other companies which had also been supplied with Wolf recordings by Phillips. In time, other important artists signed with Chess Records, including Bo Diddley and Sonny Boy Williamson, while Willie Dixon and Robert Lockwood Jr. took on a significant role behind the scenes. In the 1950s, Chess Records&#x27; commercial success grew with artists such as Little Walter, The Moonglows, The Flamingos, and Chuck Berry, and in the &#x27;60s with Etta James, Fontella Bass, Koko Taylor, Little Milton, Laura Lee, and Tommy Tucker, as well as with the subsidiary labels Checker, Argo, and Cadet. As the 1960s progressed, Chess&#x27;s recording enterprise branched out into other genres including gospel, traditional jazz, spoken word, comedy, and more. In the early 1960s, Chess became involved in the broadcasting business as part owner of WVON-AM radio and later acquired WSDM-FM, both in Chicago.

==Personal life and legacy==
In 1941, he married Revetta Sloan, who was also Jewish; they had three children: son Marshall and two daughters, Elaine and Susie. On October 16, 1969, six months after selling his namesake label to General Recorded Tape, Leonard Chess died of a heart attack. He was buried at Westlawn Cemetery in Norridge, Illinois.

Music industry historian John Broven has written that &quot;Leonard Chess was the dynamo behind Chess Records, the label that, along with Atlantic and Sun, has come to epitomize the independent record business. ... Leonard Chess set new standards for the industry in artist development, deal making, networking, and marketing and promotion…&quot; He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, posthumously, in the non-performer category.

== Film and TV adaptations ==
Chess was the focus of 2008 movies &quot;Cadillac Records&quot; (portrayed by Adrien Brody) and &quot;Who Do You Love?&quot; (portrayed by Alessandro Nivola) which are also fictional accounts of the ascent (and descent) of the label itself and the personnel who were involved or recorded at Chess Records.

He is portrayed by Rob Morrow on CMT&#x27;s drama series titled &quot;Sun Records&quot;.

<text>Steve Beresford (born 6 March 1950) is a British musician who graduated from the University of York He has played a variety of instruments, including piano, electronics, trumpet, euphonium, bass guitar and a wide variety of toy instruments, such as the toy piano. He has also played a wide range of music. He is probably best known for free improvisation, but has also written music for film and television and has been involved with a number of pop music groups.

== Career ==
Beresford played in Derek Bailey&#x27;s Company events and in the groups Alterations with David Toop, Terry Day and Peter Cusack, and the &quot;Three Pullovers&quot; with Nigel Coombes and Roger Smith. He was also a member with Gavin Bryars and Brian Eno of the Portsmouth Sinfonia.

Beresford has continued to play free improvisation with a number of prominent musicians, including Evan Parker, Lol Coxhill, John Zorn, and Han Bennink. He has collaborated extensively with Swiss-American artist/musician Christian Marclay and is member of the London Improvisers Orchestra.

From 2010 he performed various pieces by John Cage, including Indeterminacy with Tania Chen and comedian Stewart Lee, and a performance with Ilan Volkov at The BBC Proms 2012 at The Royal Albert Hall in London.

He has also worked with a number of popular musicians, including Ray Davis, The Slits, Frank Chickens, Ted Milton and The Flying Lizards. In 2015 he performed a duoproject with the upcoming Norwegian singer Natalie Sandtorv at the Blow Out! festival in Oslo, Norway.

He was awarded a Paul Hamlyn Award for Artists in 2012. He is a senior lecturer on the Commercial Music course at University of Westminster.

Beresford&#x27;s music and his teachings have inspired the musical community in the UK for over a decade. British songwriter and performer Katy Carr cites Steve Beresford&#x27;s lectures on musical themes associated with Free improvisation, Experimental music, John Cage, musique concrète, Diamanda Galás and The Slits as a source of initial inspiration with regards to the creation of her debut album, &quot;Screwing Lies&quot; released in 2001.

The authors of the &quot;Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings&quot; called Beresford &quot;one of the unsung geniuses of modern European music, a constant presence whose contribution is usually unremarked.&quot;

<text>The Plasmatics were an American punk rock, hardcore punk and heavy metal band formed by Rod Swenson and Wendy O. Williams in New York City in 1977. They were a controversial group known for chaotic, destructive live shows and outrageous theatrics. These included chainsawing guitars, destroying speaker cabinets, sledgehammering television sets and blowing up automobiles live on stage. Williams was arrested in Milwaukee by the Milwaukee Police before being charged with public indecency.

The Plasmatics&#x27; career spanned five studio albums and multiple EPs. The band was composed of lead vocalist Wendy O. Williams and various other musicians rotating behind her over time. Aside from Williams and manager Rod Swenson, guitarist Wes Beech was the only other permanent member of the group. Guitarist Richie Stotts was a co-founder of the band and a mainstay of the pre-breakup core group (1978–1983).
After the full breakup of the band following the release of &quot;Coup d&#x27;etat&quot;, Stotts was edited out of band videos and was not referred to by name in a 2006 compilation DVD released by Plasmatics Media LLC (via plasmatics.com).

== History ==
=== Formation and early years (1977–1979) ===
In 1977, Rod Swenson, who received his Master of Fine Arts in 1969 from Yale University where he specialized in conceptual art, performance art, and neo-dada art, holding the view that the measure of true or high art is how confrontational it is. He began a series of counter-culture projects which, by the mid-&#x27;70s, found him in the heart of Times Square producing experimental counterculture theater as well as video and shows with the likes of the then-little-known bands The Dead Boys, The Ramones, Patti Smith, and others. It was there that he met Wendy O. Williams after Williams found a copy of &quot;Show Business Weekly&quot; someone had discarded on the bus station floor. The issue lay open to a page with an ad in the casting calls section for Swenson&#x27;s theater show &quot;Captain Kink&#x27;s Sex Fantasy Theater&quot;. She answered the ad and applied for a job.

Williams and Swenson began auditioning potential band members in 1977 and, in July 1978, the Plasmatics gave their first public performance at what had become the rock shrine CBGB on New York City&#x27;s Bowery. The earliest version of the band was a three-piece put together with a strong emphasis on visuals. The band quickly realized they needed another guitarist to hold them together musically. Guitarist Wes Beech joined the group and he would become, after Williams, the only permanent member of the band playing or touring behind or involved in the production of every Plasmatics and Wendy O. Williams record ever recorded.

From their initial gig at CBGB, the Plasmatics quickly rose in the New York City punk underground scene of the time. From playing a single weekday night, they moved quickly to playing repeated stands of four nights straight with two sold-out shows each night. They had lines stretching around the block and brought more fans into CBGB during this time than any other band. The group quickly outgrew CBGB. The band&#x27;s stage show soon became notorious with acts such as chainsawing guitars in half part of their performance. Jim Farber of &quot;Sounds&quot; described the show: &quot;Lead singer/ex-porn star/current weightlifter Wendy Orleans Williams (W.O.W. for short) spends most of the Plasmatics&#x27; show fondling her family size breasts, scratching her sweaty snatch and eating the drum kit, among other playful events&quot;.

Rod Swenson soon made a deal to book what was then a little-known polka hall called Irving Plaza from the Polish War Veterans who ran it at the time. The band repeatedly sold out the venue, with the Plasmatics helping to give Irving Plaza national recognition and launch it on the path to becoming an established rock venue in New York City. Having then caught the attention of important people in the entertainment world of New York City, the Plasmatics headlined the Palladium on November 16, 1979, the first group in history to do so at full ticket prices and without a major label recording contract.

=== &quot;New Hope for the Wretched&quot;, &quot;Beyond the Valley of 1984&quot; and &quot;Metal Priestess&quot; (1980–1981) ===
The Plasmatics were soon selling out shows in Philadelphia, Boston, venues in New Jersey, and elsewhere in the Northeast. Chris Knowles of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine wrote: the Plasmatics &quot;were the biggest live attraction in New York... and the media was on them like white on rice... It&#x27;s one thing to play at subversiveness, but The Plasmatics, unlike other Punk bands... put their Punk philosophy into action.&quot; Many U.S. record labels were reluctant to sign the band; The band was signed by Stiff Records, a British label, in March 1980, and appeared on the cover of &quot;Sounds&quot; in June of that year. Artists and Repertoire (A&amp;R) from Stiff Records flew to New York City to see a show in person to determine if what they had been reading and hearing could possibly be real. The day after seeing the performance, Stiff put in an offer and a deal was inked within a month. A few months later, The Plasmatics began to record songs in New York City for what would become the album &quot;New Hope for the Wretched&quot;. As creative decisions go, Stiff&#x27;s choice to ask long-time Rolling Stones producer Jimmy Miller to be behind the console for these recordings was not the best.

In addition to songs like &quot;Corruption&quot; and &quot;Living Dead&quot; – linked to TV smashing and automobile destruction – &quot;Butcher Baby&quot; featured a chainsaw sawing through a guitar, in place of a guitar solo, which was replicated during live shows. The Plasmatics visited the UK for a tour, which met with opposition from some quarters including the Greater London Council (GLC), particularly for their intention to blow up a car on stage and Williams&#x27; semi-nudity. The GLC canceled the band&#x27;s show at the Hammersmith Odeon after fire inspectors decided the show would not meet safety requirements, although police had already arrived to disperse the gathering crowd before the decision had officially been taken. (Williams, recalled Debbie Harry in 2014, &quot;was such a big deal back then. She showed her tits and she blew up cars on stage and broke TVs – and now it would just be normal.&quot;) Released as a single by Stiff Records, &quot;Butcher Baby&quot; reached No. 55 on the UK Singles Chart.

Stiff America had scheduled a release and a US tour. To capitalize on the band&#x27;s popularity, the US edition of the album was packaged with a poster for the canceled Hammersmith Odeon show and an insert for the Plasmatics Secret Service, the official fan club. The album reached No. 55 on the UK Albums Chart. The band was set to tour the West Coast for the first time after the London cancellation and get their momentum back. To kick off the tour, Williams drove a Cadillac towards a stage at a free concert on New York City&#x27;s Pier 62 loaded with explosives, jumping out moments before the car would hit the stage, blowing up all the equipment. The permits needed for this were hard to get and only allowed for an estimated 5–6,000 people. The day of the performance, 10,000 showed up, jamming the downtown streets and lining the rooftops. Even though it cost virtually the entire advance for the US release of &quot;New Hope for the Wretched&quot; to do it, Williams was quoted by a reporter from the Associated Press as saying, &quot;It was worth it because it showed that these are just things and... people shouldn&#x27;t worship them,&quot; a point she&#x27;d repeat more than once.

The Plasmatics&#x27; debut in Los Angeles was at the famed Whisky a Go Go. The show was originally planned for only two nights but was later expanded to four due to large sold-out crowds.

The ABC show &quot;Fridays&quot;, which was looking to be a more cutting-edge version of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, booked Williams and the Plasmatics to appear in late December to go live on national TV.

In January 1981, Williams&#x27; stage performance in Milwaukee led to her arrest on charges of indecency after she reportedly &quot;simulated masturbation with a sledge hammer in front of an audience&quot;. After objecting to being searched she was thrown to the ground and reportedly kicked in the face (later requiring a dozen stitches), with manager Rod Swenson also beaten unconscious when he tried to intervene. Williams was charged with battery of a police officer, resisting arrest, and &quot;conduct in violation of a Milwaukee city ordinance pertaining to establishments that sell liquor&quot;, with Swenson also charged, but both were later cleared of all charges. A subsequent performance at The Palms nightclub sold out, and passed without incident, although the venue was raided after the show by the vice squad, with more than 30 police officers in attendance in case of trouble. Williams was also arrested on obscenity charges in Cleveland, but she was again acquitted.

A second album was long overdue but due to the ongoing legal battles and the Miller debacle with the first album, which was costly both in terms of time and money, it was agreed that this one had to be lean and mean. Bruce Kirkland at Stiff agreed to put up the funds as long as Swenson produced and the album was done in less than three weeks at a quarter of the cost of the first.

Given the recent turn of events, Swenson proposed the name &quot;Beyond the Valley of 1984&quot;. The tour, in 1981, became &quot;The 1984 World Tour&quot;. In between touring drummers, Alice Cooper&#x27;s Neal Smith was brought in to drum on the record. The album, with its Orwellian and apocalyptic theme, and songs such as &quot;Masterplan&quot;, &quot;Pig is a Pig&quot; and &quot;Sex Junkie&quot;, was released a few months later. During the album&#x27;s recording, the Plasmatics were booked on Tom Snyder&#x27;s late night TV show, on which the host introduced them as possibly &quot;the greatest punk rock band in the entire world.&quot; Recording engineer Eddie Ciletti mixed the record at the Ranch recording studio in New York as well as the TV sound for the Snyder performance.

The album cover for &quot;Beyond the Valley&quot; was photographed in the Arizona desert where Williams appears on horseback with the band (without a drummer) as the &quot;Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot;.

The 1984 World Tour continued with the bold slogan &quot;Down On Your Knees and Pledge Allegiance!&quot;.

During the last part of the tour, Swenson was contacted by American singer, songwriter and record producer Dan Hartman&#x27;s office, asking for a meeting with Williams and Swenson. Hartman, who produced 38 Special, James Brown, and others, had been working on a session in LA when he picked up &quot;Beyond the Valley of 1984&quot; and could not stop playing it. He felt it was &quot;groundbreaking&quot;. He said, &quot;I knew I wanted to meet these people and do something with them.&quot; Hartman came down to the Tribeca loft, met Williams and Swenson, and a month later he and Swenson were working on the production of the &quot;Metal Priestess&quot; mini-LP. The band needed more product but another album was premature, partly because Capitol Records was now making overtures for the next one. Bruce Kirkland at Stiff was ready to release it and that summer &quot;Metal Priestess&quot; was recorded at Hartman&#x27;s private studio off his schoolhouse-turned-home in Connecticut. Released early that fall, &quot;Metal Priestess&quot; saw the band move closer to heavy metal, and included new members Chris &quot;Junior&quot; Romanelli (replacing Jean Beauvoir) and Joey Reese.

In October 1981, the band made an appearance on the &quot;Fishin&#x27; Musician&quot; segment of &quot;SCTV&quot; on NBC, shortly after the release of &quot;Metal Priestess&quot;.

=== &quot;Coup d&#x27;Etat&quot; (1982–1983) ===
By the spring of 1982, a worldwide deal was signed with Capitol Records, and Dan Hartman offered to produce a demo of the album for Capitol with Swenson at Electric Lady Studios, Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s old studio, in New York. The whole album was arranged, recorded and mixed within a week. Dieter Dierks, who had just come off a number one album with Scorpions, also expressed interest in producing.

&quot;Coup d&#x27;Etat&quot; was a breakthrough album that began to blend the punk and metal genres, something that would later be done by bands such as S.O.D., Anthrax, and the Cro-Mags by the end of the 1980s. Williams also broke ground for her unique singing style. She pushed her voice so hard she had to make trips into Cologne, Germany, where the album was being recorded, each day for treatments to avoid permanent damage to her vocal cords.

The Hartman demo was released 20 years later under the name &quot;Coup de Grace&quot;. The rawer version of &quot;Coup d&#x27;Etat&quot;, which took less than a tenth of the time and a fraction of the budget, is hailed by many fans as the true version of the album.

The video Swenson produced and directed of &quot;The Damned&quot; featured Williams driving a school bus through a wall of TVs, climbing onto the roof of a moving bus which had been loaded with explosives, and then singing from the roof and jumping off a few moments before the bus goes through the second wall of TVs and then blows sky high.

As touring began, it became clear that Capitol was beginning to turn away from the group in favor of groups such as Duran Duran, who could generate ten times the sales with none of the political liability and fallout. Soon after the album was released, Capitol Records dropped the Plasmatics.

In 1982, Lemmy of Motörhead was approached by his label to do a follow-up to his successful Motörhead/Girlschool collaboration, &quot;St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre&quot; EP and Motörhead&#x27;s manager Doug Smith got in touch with Rod Swenson in the States and proposed a duet of the country classic &quot;Stand by Your Man&quot; by Williams and Lemmy. The B-side would have two tracks, the Plasmatics&#x27; &quot;Masterplan&quot; sung by Lemmy and Motörhead&#x27;s &quot;No Class&quot; sung by Williams. The A-side would have Williams and Lemmy in a duet of the title track of the EP.

Tracked at a Canadian recording studio, the &quot;Stand by Your Man&quot; sessions proved to be tumultuous as guitarist Eddie Clarke (who was producing the tracks, but not playing on them) quit Motörhead in the middle of the project. Rod Swenson and Dan Hartman, who had finished demoing the Plasmatics &quot;Coup d&#x27;Etat&quot; album together, were called upon to finish the rough and raw project in the mix which they did at Electric Lady Studios in New York. Swenson then shot the cover with Lemmy and Williams on it and the raw project was put out by Bronze records.

=== Hiatus and Wendy O. Williams&#x27; solo career (1984–1986) ===
In 1982, Kiss asked for Williams and the Plasmatics to appear as a special guest on their tour. Kiss wanted the controversial street edge that Williams would bring as part of their tour and for the Plasmatics it was a chance to play in front of different audiences in different markets than they would ordinarily play. By the end of the tour with Kiss it was clear that, although the formal notice that Capitol would not pick up their option for a second album did not come in for six months, the relationship with Capitol was done. It had taken months for the deal to be done, months to record and release the album and now months to get out of the deal. Gene Simmons approached Williams and Swenson about producing the next Wendy O. Williams album. To avoid any wasted time in legal issues with Capitol Records, it was decided not to use the Plasmatics name on the record at all and was simply called &quot;WOW&quot;, the initials of Wendy O. Williams. Gene Simmons felt it would give him the freedom he wanted to add more new players to the album.

Wes Beech remained to play rhythm and lead and T.C. Tolliver, the drummer on &quot;Coup d&#x27;Etat&quot;, remained to play on the new album. Gene Simmons played bass under the pseudonym of &quot;Reginald Van Helsing&quot;. The only other new player on the album was lead guitarist Michael Ray, brought in to solve the technical challenges that had been a problem for several albums and had come to a head with the more complex music of &quot;Coup D&#x27;Etat&quot;. Simmons also pulled in the talents of Ace Frehley, who had not played with Kiss since leaving the band years before, Paul Stanley, and then-current Kiss drummer Eric Carr and guitarist Vinnie Vincent each did one song as guests. The record was released on Passport (international and U.S. distribution by JEM).

Review copies were sent out to the various media outlets. Malcolm Dome, a reviewer for &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine, had picked the &quot;WOW&quot; album as his album of the year. Williams received a Grammy nomination for &#x27;Best Female Rock Vocal&#x27; in 1985.

With Mohawks now starting to become common, Williams decided to let her hair grow in, and the cover Swenson shot for what would be called the &quot;album of the year&quot; in the pages of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; was the opposite of the earlier covers; total simplicity.

Wes Beech took a sabbatical for personal reasons and would not accompany the band on the next tour. The band decided to return to being a three-piece. Beech came in as associate producer with Swenson on the album and worked on writing, arranging and recording, but the recording would be Ray, Tolliver, and Greg Smith (who would go on to play with Alice Cooper, Ritchie Blackmore and others and who had been brought in as the touring bassist for the &quot;WOW&quot; album). There was tremendous excitement in tackling the project as a kind of minimalist, stripped down concept, or rite of purification. The songs, including the lyrics, would also be minimalistic or archetypal, again giving Williams a chance to take her vocals a step further. The tempo of the WOW album had been slower than previous albums in an effort to open it up, but the new album &quot;Kommander of Kaos&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;KOK&quot;) was to bring back the speed and then some. Songs would be played at breakneck speeds, with screaming leads and vocals. The recording was done in Fairfield, New Jersey at the giant Broccoli Rabe Recording complex which would be home to several Wendy O./Plasmatics Projects including three studio albums with what the group fondly called &quot;The Fairfield Sound&quot;.

=== &quot;Maggots: The Record&quot; (1987–1988) ===
Beech had rejoined the band to both tour and play on the next album where the re-formed four-piece band became a centerpiece for perhaps the most complex arrangements in the band&#x27;s career. After the archetypal minimalism, both lyrically and musically of &quot;Kommander&quot;, the new album, which would again carry the Plasmatics name, was filled with complexity and returned to the social and political themes previously found most strongly in &quot;Coup&quot; but also in &quot;1984&quot; before it: environmental decay and a world where excess and abuse led directly to a doomsday scenario.

&quot;&quot; was recorded in 1987 and set 25 years in a future where environmental abuse and the burning of fossil fuels have created a greenhouse effect leading to an end of the world scenario. Called by many the first &quot;thrash metal opera&quot;, the central theme of the album is an end of the world scenario that follows from genetic engineering and global warming, something that was not at all part of the general public awareness of the time. A group of scientists trying to eliminate pollution in the rivers and oceans develop an RNA retrovirus designed to eat it all up and then die once the pollution has been consumed. But global warming leading to the flooding of land areas instead puts the virus in contact with the &quot;common maggot&quot; leading to a mutated form of maggot that doubles in size with each generation looking for more and more things to consume. In the &quot;end of the world&quot; finale, cities are being destroyed and humans consumed by giant maggots a horrific metaphorical end to a world blind to human consumption and environmental destruction.

The album features various scenes of The White Family over the course of three days. The family is devoured while watching a TV game show. Valerie, the girlfriend of hot-shot television reporter Bruce is devoured by three massive maggots while lying in her boyfriend&#x27;s bed. The final scene has Cindy White trying to fight off the attacking maggots and running out onto a fire escape where she sees the crowded streets below as the record shows the entire human population is headed for imminent annihilation. The album was on the WOW label; distributed by Profile Records in the U.S. and overseas by GWR Records, which had been started by Motörhead&#x27;s longtime manager Doug Smith.

Williams did a performance piece to inaugurate the album at New York City&#x27;s Palladium, which had been transformed from a proscenium theater into a huge multi-level club where she sledgehammered and chainsawed to smithereens a facsimile all-American living room. &quot;Maggots: The Tour&quot; began a week later using the Plasmatics name for the first time in two albums with slogans such as &quot;Those Now Eating Will Soon Be Eaten,&quot; &quot;The Day of the Humans is Gone,&quot; and lyrics such as &quot;soldiers for the DNA dissidents are put away, dragged off in the dead of night, disappear without a sight&quot;. Rear screen projectors ran film of human disasters, fascists and other historical horrors, environmental carnage and human rights violations on huge screens behind the band during all the songs from the &quot;Maggots&quot; album.

A review in &quot;Kerrang!&quot; came out shortly thereafter: A 5 out of 5 Ks, &quot;Quite simply a masterpiece... a work of genius.&quot; Williams&#x27; vocal work &quot;reduces Celtic Frost&#x27;s Tom G. Warrior&#x27;s &#x27;death grunts&#x27; to mere whimpers&quot; it went on coupled with &quot;a mixture of hedonistic operatic melodies..gut forged to some of the heaviest armadillo beats you&#x27;re ever like to hear committed to vinyl.&quot;

<doc id="166643" wikidata="Q550602" url="?curid=166643" title="Poison (band)">
<text>Poison is an American rock band formed in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania in 1983. The most successful incarnation of the band consists of lead singer and rhythm guitarist Bret Michaels, drummer Rikki Rockett, bassist Bobby Dall and lead guitarist C.C. DeVille. The band achieved huge commercial success in the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s and sold over 50 million records and DVDs worldwide.

The band had a &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number one hit single with &quot;Every Rose Has Its Thorn&quot; and other top 40 hit singles in the 1980s and 1990s, including &quot;Talk Dirty to Me&quot;, &quot;I Won&#x27;t Forget You&quot;, &quot;Nothin&#x27; But a Good Time&quot;, &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;, &quot;Your Mama Don&#x27;t Dance&quot;, &quot;Unskinny Bop&quot;, &quot;Something to Believe In&quot;, &quot;Ride the Wind&quot;, and &quot;Life Goes On.&quot; The band&#x27;s breakthrough debut album, the multi-platinum &quot;Look What the Cat Dragged In&quot;, was released in 1986, followed by &quot;Open Up and Say... Ahh!&quot;, which was certified 5× platinum in the US. Their third consecutive multi-platinum album was &quot;Flesh &amp; Blood&quot;, which became their best-selling release. In the 1990s, following the release of the band&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Swallow This Live&quot;, the band experienced some line up changes and the fall of glam metal with the grunge movement, but the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Native Tongue&quot;, still achieved Gold status and the band&#x27;s first compilation album, &quot;Poison&#x27;s Greatest Hits: 1986–1996&quot;, went double platinum.

The original line up reformed for a greatest hits reunion tour in 1999. The band began the 2000s with the release of &quot;Crack a Smile... and More!&quot;, followed by the &quot;Power to the People&quot; album. They released the album, &quot;Hollyweird&quot;, in 2002 and in 2006 the band celebrated their 20-year anniversary with &quot;The Best of Poison: 20 Years of Rock&quot; tour and album, which was certified Gold and marked Poison&#x27;s return to the &quot;Billboard&quot; top 20 charts for the first time since 1993. Band members have released several solo albums and starred in reality TV shows. Since their debut in 1986, they have released seven studio albums, four live albums, five compilation albums, and have issued 28 singles to radio. In 2012 VH1 ranked them at No. 1 on their list of the &quot;Top 5 Hair Bands of the &#x27;80s&quot;.

==History==
===Early years (1983–1985)===
Poison, initially named Paris, was formed in 1983, in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania and consisted of lead vocalist Bret Michaels, bassist Bobby Dall, drummer Rikki Rockett and lead guitarist Matt Smith.

Michaels began his performing career with a basement band called Laser and, then, in 1979, joined longtime childhood friend Rockett to form a band called the Spectres. In 1980, Michaels and Rockett teamed up with Smith and Dall to form the band Paris and the group started playing the club circuit, performing mostly rock cover songs in local bars. According to Vicky Hamilton, Poison&#x27;s first manager, the band&#x27;s sound at this time revolved around guitarist Smith, who was by far the best musician in the group. While Smith was responsible for music, Rockett and Michaels focused on the band&#x27;s stage show and image.

Paris formed a strong local following in Pennsylvania but saw little opportunity of larger success there, and the decision was made to move to Los Angeles. In March 1983, Paris changed their name to Poison and headed west to California.

===Arrival of DeVille===
Now based in Los Angeles, Poison&#x27;s stage show began earning them considerable attention in the West Hollywood Sunset Strip club circuit. The band lived together in a small apartment on Orange St. in Hollywood, and many local female fans began bringing them bags of groceries and cleaning the apartment in exchange for the opportunity to spend time with the band members. The Pennsylvania natives endured culture shock upon settling in Hollywood; &quot;The first week we&#x27;re seeing people get their asses kicked out front. I remember this pimp was literally smacking the hell out of his ho across the street&quot;, Rockett recalled of Poison&#x27;s early days on the Sunset Strip. That same pimp would later pull a large knife on the band when they decided to intervene, and they learned quickly not to get involved in such matters. Hamilton, who had previously represented Stryper and who would go on to discover Guns N&#x27; Roses, negotiated a deal with influential club The Troubadour which would provide the band with a regular gig and allow them to further develop their image and stage show. They recorded demos for Atlantic Records but ultimately the label passed on the band. By 1985, guitarist Smith was rapidly becoming disillusioned with Poison, as he was about to become a father and was growing doubtful of the band&#x27;s chances of success. He subsequently left the band and returned home to Pennsylvania, leaving Poison&#x27;s future very much in doubt.

The band auditioned several guitarists in Los Angeles and eventually narrowed the field down to two candidates, Slash and C.C. DeVille. The band knew Slash from the band Hollywood Rose, which he was a member of before joining Guns N&#x27; Roses, but the band was hoping to find an east coast guitarist. DeVille recently turned down an offer to join Christian rockers Stryper, and although the rest of Poison were duly impressed with his playing and image, they did not care for his brash New York personality. DeVille reportedly dismissed the material written by the band which he had been asked to learn for the audition, and clashed with Poison over which songs would encompass the audition. Michaels and Dall, in particular, disliked the guitarist on a personal level and had strong misgivings about hiring him. Ultimately, in spite of their apprehension, the band decided that DeVille&#x27;s talent and drive to succeed made him the best choice. The band&#x27;s desire to replace Smith with another east coast guitarist fueled the move to hire DeVille over Slash. The band also saw hit single potential in the song DeVille brought with him to the audition, &quot;Talk Dirty to Me&quot;, a song from his previous group The Screaming Mimis.

===&quot;Look What the Cat Dragged In&quot; and &quot;Open Up and Say... Ahh!&quot; (1986–1989)===
Unable to secure a major label recording contract, Poison was signed by Steev Riccardo with the smaller Enigma Records in 1986 (see 1986 in music) for approximately $30,000, a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of dollars many similar acts were receiving from major labels at the time. Their debut album, &quot;Look What the Cat Dragged In&quot;, was released on May 23, 1986, with the band members themselves partially funding the recording. The album was initially expected to produce only one single, &quot;Cry Tough&quot;; however, &quot;Look What the Cat Dragged In&quot; became a surprise success and subsequently spawned three charting hits: &quot;Talk Dirty to Me&quot;, &quot;I Want Action&quot;, and &quot;I Won&#x27;t Forget You&quot;, The record became the biggest-selling-album in Enigma&#x27;s history. With heavy rotation on MTV, their debut earned the band tours with fellow glam rockers Ratt, Cinderella, and Quiet Riot, as well as a coveted slot in the Texxas Jam in Dallas. In 1987 the band recorded a cover of the Kiss song &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot; for soundtrack to &quot;Less than Zero&quot;.

Poison&#x27;s second album, &quot;Open Up and Say... Ahh!&quot;, was released May 21, 1988. It peaked at No. 2 on the American charts. The album included the band&#x27;s biggest hit, the No. 1 single &quot;Every Rose Has Its Thorn&quot;, along with other hits &quot;Nothin&#x27; but a Good Time&quot;, &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;, and the Loggins and Messina cover &quot;Your Mama Don&#x27;t Dance&quot;. The album&#x27;s initial cover art was controversial, as it depicted a demonic female figure with an obscenely long tongue. A censored version of the cover followed, focusing on the figure&#x27;s eyes. In 1989, the band released their first video album titled &quot;Sight for Sore Ears&quot; which featured all their music videos from the first two albums.

Conflict pursued the band persistently. Michaels&#x27; frequent brawling garnered him further lawsuits in Atlanta, Los Angeles and Tallahassee. Bryn Bridenthal, head of publicity at Geffen Records, filed a $1.1 million lawsuit against the band for drenching her with drinks and a bucket of ice at a music industry party. Then, Sanctuary Music, Poison&#x27;s former management company, filed a $45.5 million breach of contract suit against the band. Poison retaliated with charges of mismanagement of funds. Easy Action filed a lawsuit, claiming that Poison stole the chorus of their song &quot;We Go Rocking&quot; for their single &quot;I Want Action&quot;. As recalled by Easy Action&#x27;s lead vocalist Tommy Nilsson in an interview with Rock United, they received an unspecified financial settlement for the alleged plagiarism in 1989. DeVille put the amount at $25,000 in a 1994 radio interview with Lonn Friend.

===&quot;Flesh &amp; Blood&quot; and &quot;Swallow This Live&quot; (1990–1992)===
Poison continued their adherence to the &quot;work hard, play hard&quot; motto, following up with their third album, &quot;Flesh &amp; Blood&quot;, which was released June 21, 1990. It also was highly successful, being certified 3× Platinum in the U.S. and 4× Platinum in Canada. The album&#x27;s success prompted the impetus for a further world tour. The album also features an alternative cover, as the original featured what appeared to be running ink or possibly blood from a tattoo. The record went multi-platinum, spawning two gold singles: &quot;Unskinny Bop&quot; and the ballad &quot;Something To Believe In&quot; which was dedicated to the band&#x27;s security guard and close friend James Kimo Maano who had died. &quot;Ride the Wind&quot; and &quot;Life Goes On&quot; were the other single releases that charted, the last single released was the title cut, &quot;Flesh &amp; Blood (Sacrifice)&quot;.

Poison received a letter from Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney thanking the band for contributing 20,000 CDs of the album &quot;Flesh &amp; Blood&quot; to lift the morale of U.S. Troops during Desert Storm, and their continued support of the Armed Forces.

One of the band&#x27;s few appearances in the UK was on August 18, 1990, at Donington&#x27;s Monsters of Rock festival in the summer of 1990. Whitesnake and Aerosmith headlined with Poison, Quireboys and Thunder supporting them. This event was broadcast on BBC Radio 1.

After two consecutive years on the road, band members were at each other&#x27;s throats with personal differences and drug addictions. Poison recorded several performances during its 1990/1991 Flesh &amp; Blood world tour, which were released in November 1991 as the band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Swallow This Live&quot;. The double album features live tracks from Poison&#x27;s first three studio albums and four new studio tracks including the single &quot;So Tell Me Why&quot;, which were the last recorded before C.C. DeVille&#x27;s departure from the band later that year.

===&quot;Native Tongue&quot;, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and &quot;Crack a Smile&quot; (1993–2000)===
DeVille was fired and replaced by guitarist Richie Kotzen. Poison&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Native Tongue&quot;, was released February 8, 1993. It was strongly influenced by Kotzen&#x27;s fresh songwriting contributions and guitar performance. It marked a change for the band as they abandoned their anthemic party tunes to focus on more serious subjects, and was far more blues-rock oriented than glam metal. Containing the singles &quot;Stand&quot; which featured the Los Angeles First A.M.E. Church Choir on backing vocals, &quot;Until You Suffer Some (Fire And Ice)&quot; and &quot;Body Talk&quot;, the album received generally positive reviews and did go Gold, but following the arrival of grunge sales were sluggish compared with the first three albums. The band toured in support of the album, but tensions mounted between Kotzen and the rest of the band. Kotzen&#x27;s future in the band was doomed when it was discovered that he had become romantically involved with Rockett&#x27;s then-fiancée Deanna Eve. Kotzen was promptly fired, and replaced by Blues Saraceno in November 1993, who completed the world tour with the band including the famous &quot;Hollywood Rock&quot; concerts in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, Brazil, where they played to over 165,000 people.

Poison began recording its sixth album, &quot;Crack a Smile&quot;, in early 1994. Recording was brought to an abrupt halt in May 1994, when Michaels was involved in a car accident where he lost control of his Ferrari. Michaels suffered a broken nose, ribs, jaw, and fingers and lost four teeth. After his recovery in 1995, the band continued recording the album. The album became shelved shortly after this, with no release date anywhere in sight. Instead, the label opted for a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation, which featured two new tracks with Saraceno on guitar, &quot;Sexual Thing&quot; and &quot;Lay Your Body Down&quot;. The first Greatest Hits album was released on November 26, 1996, and sold extremely well, going on to reach double platinum status.

After several years apart, Michaels and DeVille were able to patch up their differences; and Michaels welcomed DeVille back into Poison in 1996 to replace Saraceno.

Michaels was involved with Pamela Anderson. After Poison&#x27;s and Michaels&#x27; longtime attorney, Ed McPherson, obtained a Federal injunction prohibiting the distribution of an explicit sex tape that the couple made, an abridged version of the tape appeared on the internet in 1998.

Michaels and actor friend Charlie Sheen co-founded a production company called Sheen Michaels Entertainment. In 1998, Michaels made his acting debut alongside Charlie and Martin Sheen in the movie &quot;A Letter from Death Row&quot;, which was also written and directed by Michaels.

The &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; reunion tour took place in the summer of 1999, with the original lineup. The show at Pine Knob Amphitheater in metro Detroit drew a sell-out crowd of 18,000, and other shows averaged crowds of 12,000. In addition, the band appeared on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot;. On March 14, 2000, &quot;Crack a Smile...and More!&quot; was finally released, with the single &quot;Shut Up, Make Love&quot; and power ballad &quot;Be the One&quot;. In addition to the outtakes, live recordings from the 1990 installment of the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; series were included.

===&quot;Power to the People&quot; and &quot;Hollyweird&quot; (2001–2002)===
After the Poison reunion DeVille soon released his solo album, &quot;Samantha 7&quot;, and Michaels released the solo/Poison album &quot;Show Me Your Hits&quot; which featured re-recorded Poison classics. The album featured Michaels performing Poison hits in a new way and also featured other artists with Michaels on selected tracks. Poison also released &quot;Power to the People&quot;, their first album with DeVille in nine years. The record contained five new studio songs: &quot;Power to the People&quot; which features a music video, &quot;Can&#x27;t Bring Me Down&quot;, &quot;The Last Song&quot;, &quot;Strange&quot;, and &quot;I Hate Every Bone In Your Body But Mine&quot;, the latter with DeVille on lead vocals for the first time.

In May 2001 Poison released the web single &quot;Rockstar&quot; as a preview of the upcoming new album and went on tour with Warrant.

Poison&#x27;s sixth full studio album, &quot;Hollyweird&quot;, was released on May 21, 2002. It was Poison&#x27;s first full album of new material with DeVille back in the band. The album was heavily criticized by both critics and fans, feeling it had poor production quality and an unimpressive new sound. One popular site said &quot;It&#x27;s muddy, under-produced, badly mixed and features crappy drum and guitar sounds&quot;. Other reviewers were more impressed, such as AllMusic, who declared it &quot;one of Poison&#x27;s best records, if not their best&quot;. A cover of &quot;The Who&quot; song &quot;Squeeze Box&quot; was released as the second single from the album on April 2, 2002. The album&#x27;s third and final single &quot;Shooting Star&quot; was released on November 5, 2002. As of 2025 is the band&#x27;s most recent original song that has been released as a single.

===&quot;Best of Ballads &amp; Blues&quot; and &quot;The Best of Poison&quot; (2003–2006)===
Following the Hollyweird world tour Poison released their second compilation album, &quot;Best of Ballads &amp; Blues&quot;, in 2003. It contains a new acoustic version with new lyrics of &quot;Something to Believe In&quot; and a new acoustic version of &quot;Stand&quot;. Michaels also released his second solo album, &quot;Songs of Life&quot;, which featured singles &quot;Bittersweet&quot; and &quot;Raine&quot; which featured a music video and was dedicated to his daughter. On January 7 that year, after almost 20 years with Poison, Rockett released his first solo album, &quot;Glitter 4 Your Soul&quot;, which was distributed online.

During the summer of 2004, Poison was invited to serve as the opening band on Kiss&#x27;s &quot;Rock the Nation&quot; tour. Poison were largely inactive in 2005 which is when Michaels released his third solo album, the country-rock-influenced &quot;Freedom Of Sound&quot;, which included the single &quot;All I Ever Needed&quot; featuring Jessica Andrews, which also featured a music video and appeared on Billboard&#x27;s &quot;Hot Country Songs&quot; chart, with its best position being number 45.

After a year off, Poison returned to the music scene. They celebrated their 20th anniversary with a &quot;20 Years Of Rock&quot; world tour in the summer of 2006, with fellow rockers Cinderella and Endeverafter opening. The tour swiftly became one of the most successful tours of 2006 in the U.S., averaging about 10,000 people per night. To complement it, the band had released an anniversary compilation album &quot;The Best Of Poison: 20 Years Of Rock&quot;, in April that year. The album also features a new single, a cover of Grand Funk Railroad&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;re An American Band&quot;, produced by Don Was and also features a music video. The compilation debuted at No. 17 with a first week sales total of 39,721, which marked Poison&#x27;s return to the top 20 charts for the first time since 1993.

On August 1, 2006, Capitol Records released remastered versions of the first three Poison albums: &quot;Look What the Cat Dragged In&quot;, &quot;Open Up and Say... Ahh!&quot; and &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot;, in honor of Poison&#x27;s 20th anniversary. All three include bonus tracks.

===&quot;Poison&#x27;d!&quot; and &quot;Live, Raw &amp; Uncut&quot; (2007–2009)===
On January 3, 2007, Poison announced on their official MySpace page that they would like their fans to help pick favorite classic rock songs for the new studio album that they are to record. The fans replied with suggestions like Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s &quot;Freebird&quot;, Sweet&#x27;s &quot;The Ballroom Blitz&quot;, and AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot;, along with Alice Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Poison&quot;.

During 2007, Poison went on a summer tour with Ratt. They released their covers album, now named &quot;Poison&#x27;d!&quot;, on June 5, 2007, through Capitol Records. The album entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at No. 32 and charted at No. 12 on the Top Rock Albums, selling 21,000 copies in its first week. The first single, &quot;What I Like About You&quot;, featured a music video from the band. White Lion was removed from the tour due to legal issues, and Vains of Jenna took their place. The August 2 sold-out show in at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre St. Louis, Missouri was taped for a live concert DVD and for a HDNet Concert special called: &quot;Poison: Live, Raw &amp; Uncut&quot; that aired on October 26, 2007, as part of Heavy Metal Halloween. The band also appeared that night on the channel&#x27;s Sound Off with Matt Pinfield.

The band played at the Rock2Wgtn rock festival in Wellington, New Zealand, on the weekend of March 22–23, 2008. The festival also included fellow legendary rockers Kiss, Ozzy Osbourne, Alice Cooper, Whitesnake, and Finnish hard rock act Lordi.

Poison played at the Sweden Rock Festival 2008. The band then went on tour in the summer of 2008 with Sebastian Bach and Dokken.

Poison live in concert DVD titled &quot;Live, Raw &amp; Uncut&quot; was released on July 15, 2008, which was filmed in St. Louis, during the Poison&#x27;d tour in 2007. This DVD/CD set was initially exclusive to Best Buy stores and includes behind-the-scenes footage as a bonus feature and as a live audio CD with selections from the concert. It sold around 2,400 copies in its first week of release to debut at position No. 8 on Billboard&#x27;s Top Music Videos chart. Also in 2008 a live CD version of the Poison DVD Seven Days Live was released.

On June 7, 2009, Poison made a special appearance at the 63rd Tony Awards, performing &quot;Nothin&#x27; But a Good Time&quot; with the cast of &quot;Rock of Ages&quot;, which features &quot;Nothin&#x27; But a Good Time&quot; as a song in the show. As Michaels was exiting the stage, he was struck in the head by a descending set piece and knocked to the ground. He suffered a fractured nose and a split lip requiring three stitches.

===Solo success, health issues and touring (2010–present)===
In 2010, an unauthorized biography was released titled &quot;A Shot of Poison&quot; featuring a collection of tales from over twenty years with the band, based on the personal encounters of author, rock journalist and music industry insider Christopher Long.

On April 12, 2010, Michaels was rushed to the hospital after suffering intense stomach pains, and an emergency appendectomy was performed. On April 22, 2010, Michaels was again rushed to the hospital, this time with an &quot;excruciating&quot; headache. Doctors discovered that he had suffered a massive subarachnoid hemorrhage. He was in critical condition, and while some reports suggested that his condition had stabilized, others later stated that this was premature. On April 28, Michaels&#x27; representatives reported that he was conscious and speaking, albeit slowly, for the first time since he was hospitalized. In a news conference on May 5, 2010, Dr. Joseph Zabramski said Michaels has been released from the hospital and that &quot;He&#x27;s just one of those lucky people&quot; and that &quot;he&#x27;ll make a complete recovery&quot;.

In the same year, Michaels released Custom Built. Half of the new album was enriched with previously released solo material. The lead-off single Nothing to Lose features pop singer Miley Cyrus and was the most added song to radio in the week of its release. Custom Built received mixed to negative reviews and it peaked at number 14 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, topping both the Independent Albums and Hard Rock Albums. This marks the highest US chart entries by a member of Poison since Flesh &amp; Blood in 1990.

On March 1, Poison announced a 2011 Summer tour with Mötley Crüe and New York Dolls to celebrate their band anniversaries named the Glam-A-Geddon 25/30/40. Also for Poison&#x27;s 25th anniversary, a double CD named &quot;Double Dose: Ultimate Hits&quot; consisting exclusively of songs distributed by Capitol/EMI was released May 3, 2011. The compilation charted at No. 17 in Canada.

In 2012, Poison and Def Leppard performed at the &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; tour named after their 1983 song and after the 2012 motion picture of the same name, where the songs of both bands played a central role. Michaels also resumed his &quot;Get Your Rock On&quot; solo tour, named after his then latest single.

After completing the &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; tour, the bandmembers went their separate ways. Joint projects did not go beyond their announcements. Michaels continued touring and played almost exclusively Poison&#x27;s single releases with his solo band. He released &quot;Jammin&#x27; with Friends&quot; featuring re-recorded alternate versions of Poison and Michaels solo tracks on June 25, 2013, peaking at #80 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In June 2014, Rockett co-founded the band Devil City Angels. DeVille, Dall and Rockett performed together without Michaels as a live band dubbed The Special Guests in the summer of 2015. Brandon Gibbs accompanied them on vocals. At the end of 2015, drummer Rockett was diagnosed with oral cavity cancer, and joint projects had to be put on hold because of the necessary treatment.

In 2017, Poison went on a co-headlining a tour with Def Leppard and special guest Tesla throughout the spring and summer and coincided with limited headline acts throughout the US and Canada celebrating their recent 30-year anniversary. The Nothing But a Good Time Tour with opening acts Cheap Trick and Pop Evil started May 18 and ended July 1 of the following year.

In 2019 Michaels announced his autobiography to be released in 2020 titled &quot;Unbroken: My life in Pictures &amp; Stories&quot; to coincide with his single release &quot;Unbroken&quot;. It was initially set to be titled &quot;Roses &amp; Thorns&quot; when Michaels first started working on the project and was set to be released in 2010, but kept being pushed back to include more content. In May 2020 &quot;Bret Michaels: Auto-Scrap-ography Volume 1: My Life in Pictures &amp; Stories&quot; has been released as the first in a series of trilogies.

Poison toured North America as an opening act for Mötley Crüe and Def Leppard with Joan Jett for The Stadium Tour from June 16 to September 9, 2022. The tour was originally scheduled for the summer of 2020 but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the tour, Michaels expressed doubt that the band would record another album, but hoped that they would write and record another song that evoked their hits from their heyday.

<text>Richard Lewis Springthorpe (born 23 August 1949), known professionally as Rick Springfield, is an Australian-American musician and actor. He was a member of the pop rock group Zoot from 1969 to 1971, then started his solo career with his debut single, &quot;Speak to the Sky&quot;, which reached the top 10 in Australia in mid-1972. When he moved to the United States, he had a No. 1 hit with &quot;Jessie&#x27;s Girl&quot; in 1981 in both Australia and the US, for which he received the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance. He followed with four more top 10 US hits: &quot;I&#x27;ve Done Everything for You&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Talk to Strangers&quot;, &quot;Affair of the Heart&quot; and &quot;Love Somebody&quot;. Springfield&#x27;s two US top 10 albums are &quot;Working Class Dog&quot; (1981) and &quot;Success Hasn&#x27;t Spoiled Me Yet&quot; (1982).

As an actor, Springfield starred in the film &quot;Hard to Hold&quot; in 1984 and the television series &quot;High Tide&quot; from 1994 to 1997. He appeared in supporting roles in &quot;Ricki and the Flash&quot; and &quot;True Detective&quot; (both 2015). He portrayed Noah Drake on the daytime drama &quot;General Hospital&quot; (1981–83, 2005–08, 2012), returning in 2013 for the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary with his son, actor Liam Springthorpe. He played a depraved version of himself in &quot;Californication&quot; (2009). He has also appeared in episodes of &quot;Supernatural&quot;, &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;, and &quot;American Horror Story&quot;. In 2010, Springfield published his autobiography, &quot;Late, Late at Night: A Memoir&quot;.

==Early life==
Rick Springfield was born Richard Lewis Springthorpe on 23 August 1949 in Guildford, a western suburb of Sydney. He is the son of Eileen Louise (Evennett) and Norman James Springthorpe, an Australian Army career officer. His maternal grandparents were English. When he was young, he lived at the army camp with his family in Broadmeadows, Victoria, Australia. At 14, he saw the Beatles perform at Festival Hall in Melbourne.

==Career==
===Music===

Springfield was 13 when he learned guitar. He joined various bands in England, where his father was stationed from 1958 to 1963, and several more after returning to Australia. In 1968, he was approached by bass guitarist Pete Watson to join his group Rockhouse. Later that year, Watson changed the band&#x27;s name to MPD Ltd and, in October when Springfield was 19 years old, they toured South Vietnam to entertain Australian troops. Another member of MPD Ltd was Danny Finley (drummer). Upon returning to Australia, they formed Wickedy Wak. They were joined by Phil Blackmore on keyboards and Dick Howard. &quot;Go-Set&quot; journalist Molly Meldrum produced Wickedy Wak&#x27;s single, &quot;Billie&#x27;s Bikie Boys&quot;, with Beeb Birtles of pop rock group Zoot as a backing vocalist.

In September 1969, Springfield replaced Roger Hicks as lead guitarist and vocalist in Zoot, with Birtles on bass guitar and vocals, Darryl Cotton on lead vocals and guitar, and Rick Brewer on drums. Upon joining Zoot, Springfield adopted the &quot;Think PinkThink Zoot&quot; theme that had the band members dressed head to toe in pink satin. The publicity gimmick brought attention to the group and attracted numerous teenage girl fans, but caused problems in establishing their credibility as serious rock musicians. Zoot&#x27;s fifth single, &quot;Hey Pinky&quot;, was written by Springfield. The group attempted to shake off their teeny-bopper image. They followed with a hard rock cover version of The Beatles&#x27; hit &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, which peaked at No. 4 on &quot;Go-Set&quot;&#x27;s Top 40 in March 1971. Despite another hit single with &quot;Freak&quot; in April, which was written by Springfield, the band broke up in May.

Springfield signed with Sparmac Records and issued his debut solo single, &quot;Speak to the Sky&quot;, in October, which peaked at No. 5 on the &quot;Go-Set&quot; singles chart. Sparmac label owner, Robie Porter, was also producer and manager for Springfield. After recording his debut album, &quot;Beginnings&quot;, in London, Springfield moved to the United States in mid-1972. Springfield provided all the songwriting, lead vocals, guitar, keyboard and banjo for the album. In August 1972, &quot;Speak to the Sky&quot; was issued in the U.S. by Capitol Records and peaked at No. 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in September. &quot;Beginnings&quot; was the first of seven top 40 Springfield albums on the related &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. However, follow-up success was hampered by rumours that Capitol Records paid people to purchase Springfield&#x27;s albums, which led to some radio stations boycotting his music.
In 1973, Springfield signed to Columbia Records and recorded his second album, &quot;Comic Book Heroes&quot;, which was also produced by Porter. In Australia, released on Porter&#x27;s new label, Wizard Records, the album and its two singles failed to chart. Springfield was promoted as a teen pop idol similar to David Cassidy and Donny Osmond. Springfield spoke of the teenybopper image in &quot;Circus Magazine&quot; in 1973. He said he was not sure how it happened. &quot;Someone saw my photo and that was it.&quot; He went on to say that someone asked to take a photo of him in a white suit and thought that it was &quot;a bit dull&quot;, so he took some crayons and &quot;scrawled an R with a lightning bolt going through it ... which became my emblem.&quot; From September to December 1973, Springfield starred as &quot;himself&quot; in the ABC-TV Saturday morning cartoon series &quot;&quot;, for which he usually wrote and performed an original song in each episode. In 1974, he issued an Australia-only album, &quot;Mission: Magic!&quot;, which was &quot;full of infectious bubblegum pop songs&quot;. His single, &quot;Take a Hand&quot;, reached the U.S. top 50 in 1976. The single was taken from the album &quot;Wait for Night&quot;, which was issued by his new label, Chelsea Records. Soon after its release, the record company folded. During the late 1970s, he concentrated more on his acting career, guest-starring in several primetime TV dramas.

Springfield continued to write and record and, in 1981, released his next album, &quot;Working Class Dog&quot;. The album spawned the single &quot;Jessie&#x27;s Girl&quot;, a worldwide hit which peaked at No. 1 for two weeks in the U.S. on the Hot 100 and the Australian Kent Music Report singles chart. Springfield won the 1981 Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance. &quot;Working Class Dog&quot; reached No.7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Another top 10 single from the album was the Sammy Hagar-penned &quot;I&#x27;ve Done Everything for You&quot;. He had further success with the follow-up albums &quot;Success Hasn&#x27;t Spoiled Me Yet&quot; (1982) and &quot;Living in Oz&quot; (1983). Springfield was frustrated with people in interviews mistaking him for Bruce Springsteen, expressed in the track &quot;Bruce&quot; on the album &quot;Beautiful Feelings&quot; (1984). In 1984, Springfield starred in his own film, &quot;Hard to Hold&quot;, and recorded the majority of the material on the accompanying soundtrack. The soundtrack included a top-ten hit, &quot;Love Somebody&quot;, as well as several moderately successful follow-up singles. However, the film itself was not successful, and the soundtrack&#x27;s success, though higher than that of the film, paled in comparison to Springfield&#x27;s previous albums. Nonetheless, Springfield released his next album &quot;Tao&quot; in 1985, scoring several modest hits from this release, including &quot;State of the Heart&quot; and &quot;Celebrate Youth&quot;. That same year, Springfield was one of several performers who participated in the Live Aid charity concert. Around this time, he took a brief hiatus from recording.

Between 1985 (After TAO) &amp; 2020, Springfield still recorded and released nine studio albums.

Springfield returned in 2020 via a one-off featured performance in the Coheed and Cambria single &quot;Jessie&#x27;s Girl 2&quot;, a sequel to the 1981 Springfield single &quot;Jessie&#x27;s Girl&quot;.

In 2021, Springfield started hosting a weekly radio show on Sirius XM&#x27;s &quot;80s on 8&quot; Channel called &#x27;Working Class DJ with Rick Springfield&#x27;, the musician spins eight songs around a theme.

In 2021, Springfield joined Russell Morris and formed The Morris Springfield Project. The Morris Springfield Project released &quot;Jack Chrome and the Darkness Waltz&quot; in October 2021 which debuted at number 34 on the ARIA Charts.

===Acting===

Springfield made his acting debut on &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; on 30 October 1977, in an episode entitled &quot;Rollback&quot;. In December, he appeared on &quot;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot;, portraying Ned Nickerson. On 20 January 1978, Springfield guest-starred on an episode of &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; titled &quot;Screaming Javelin&quot;. The character he portrayed was Tom, the concerned fiancé of an Olympic gymnast who had been kidnapped by a megalomaniac. Later in 1978, Springfield played the character of Zac in &quot;Saga of a Star World&quot;, which was, with some differences, the pilot episode of the original &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; TV series. He also co-starred as Keith Stewart in episode 17 of season 4 (&quot;Dwarf in a Helium Hat&quot;) on &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; and as Tommy Archer in episode 4 (&quot;Murder on the Flip Side&quot;) of &quot;The Eddie Capra Mysteries&quot; in 1978. In 1979, he guest-starred on an episode of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; entitled &quot;The Disciple&quot; as Michael Roark, a San Francisco police officer who must decide whether to avenge the death of his father who was also a police officer, or simply provide justice and capture the alleged criminal. In 1981, he became a soap opera star on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. He had signed a contract with RCA Records and already recorded the album &quot;Working Class Dog&quot;, which neither he nor his agent had expected would do very well, which is why Springfield took the soap role. But the song &quot;Jessie&#x27;s Girl&quot; went to No. 1 and Springfield ended up both playing the role of Dr. Noah Drake from 1981 to 1983, while simultaneously going on tour with his band. The success of the song boosted the ratings of the show which, according to Springfield, &quot;became the biggest show on TV for that summer&quot;. The fame from the show also boosted the sale of the song.
In 1984, Springfield made a full-length feature film titled &quot;Hard to Hold&quot;. In 1998, he played in the film &quot;Legion&quot;. He also wrote the soundtrack for &quot;Hard to Hold&quot;. In 1992, he played the title role in the short-lived ABC series &quot;Human Target&quot;, based on the DC Comics character of the same name. In 1989, he starred in the film &quot;Nick Knight&quot;, in which he played an 800-year-old vampire seeking a cure for his condition. The film was later remade as the first two episodes of the series &quot;Forever Knight&quot;. In 1991, he appeared in the television film &quot;Dying to Dance&quot;. In 1994, he starred in the series &quot;Robin&#x27;s Hoods&quot;. From 1994 to 1997, he starred in the television series &quot;High Tide&quot; that ran for 69 episodes.

In addition to the roles on television and in film, Springfield also acted in musical theatre. In 1995, he was a member of the original Broadway cast of the musical &quot;Smokey Joe&#x27;s Cafe&quot;. This Tony Award-nominated musical featured the songs of rock &amp; roll songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. From February 2000 to December 2002, Springfield performed in &quot;EFX Alive!&quot; at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada. Springfield starred in several episodes of the third season of Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Californication&quot;. His first appearance was in episode 3 on 11 October 2009, in which he plays a &quot;twisted version of himself&quot;; a &quot;hedonistic Rick Springfield&quot; from the past. Springfield starred in &quot;Ho&#x27;ohuli Na&#x27;au&quot;, an episode of &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;. He played the role of photographer Renny Sinclair.

In December 2005, Springfield was asked by the &quot;General Hospital&quot; producers to return to the show in his role as Dr. Noah Drake after a 23-year absence. His run was subsequently extended as a recurring guest star and not a full contract cast member until 2008. Springfield returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot; as Dr. Noah Drake in April 2013. Springfield also starred in &quot;Everything Goes Better With Vampires&quot;, an episode of &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;. He played the role of a toll booth worker who pretended to be the famous singer/musician Rick Springfield in an attempt to impress women. Springfield had a recurring role on &quot;True Detective&quot; as Dr. Irving Pitlor, a psychiatrist. In 2015, Springfield appeared as Greg alongside Meryl Streep in the film &quot;Ricki and the Flash.&quot; In 2016, Springfield was cast in the twelfth season of The CW series &quot;Supernatural&quot; where he played rocker Vince Vincente and Lucifer. In July 2016, Springfield appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. In October 2017, Springfield appeared as Pastor Charles on FX&#x27;s &quot;American Horror Story: Cult&quot;. In July 2018, Rick played himself on Episode 4 of the YouTube original series &quot;Sideswiped&quot;.

==Personal life==
When Springfield was 17, he attempted suicide by hanging himself. &quot;I hang suspended for fifteen or twenty seconds and am just sliding into unconsciousness when the knot tying the rope to the beam somehow unravels. I&#x27;m slammed hard to the concrete floor, rather the worse for wear.&quot; Springfield has been dealing with depression for several decades. &quot;I want them to have hope ... and know that the moment will pass,&quot; Springfield said in an exclusive interview with ABC News&#x27; Paula Faris. &quot;I&#x27;m an example of the moment passing, because I&#x27;ve been there a couple of times, and haven&#x27;t ... for want of a better phrase, pulled the trigger.&quot;

From late 1974 to early 1976, Springfield was in a romantic relationship with actress Linda Blair, beginning when she was 15 and he was 25.

On 24 April 1981, his father, Norman James Springthorpe, died.

In October 1984, Springfield married his girlfriend, Barbara Porter, at his family&#x27;s church in Australia. They had met several years earlier when Springfield was recording &quot;Working Class Dog&quot; and she was working as the recording studio receptionist. They have two sons, Liam (born 1985) and Joshua (born 1989). In 1985, when his first son was born and after the release of his &quot;Tao&quot; album, Springfield took a break from his musical career to spend more time with his family and to deal with the depression that had affected him since his adolescence.

At a concert at the House of Blues in Orlando, Florida, on 2 March 2006, Springfield announced he had become a US citizen.

In January 2018, Springfield stated in an interview that he contemplated suicide in 2017. &quot;Last year I was close to it, really close to it,&quot; explained Springfield on how he considered killing himself. &quot;When Robin Williams and Chester (Bennington) and Chris Cornell and those guys... I didn&#x27;t go, &#x27;Oh that&#x27;s terrible.&#x27; I went, &#x27;I get it.&#x27; I get being that lost and dark.&quot;

He practices Transcendental Meditation. Springfield is a pescetarian.

===Memoir===
Springfield&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Late, Late at Night: A Memoir&quot; () was released in 2010. In October, it peaked at No. 13 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. In May 2014, Springfield published &quot;Magnificent Vibration&quot;: a novel, which also made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

In August 2012, &quot;Late, Late at Night&quot; was named No. 23 of &quot;The 25 Great Rock Memoirs of All Time&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

==Songs referencing Springfield==
In 1985, Jimmy Hart recorded the song &quot;Eat Your Heart Out Rick Springfield&quot;, featured on &quot;The Wrestling Album&quot;. The premise of the song is that the object of Hart&#x27;s affection seems to idolise Springfield to the point that Hart feels rivalled by him, prompting Hart to pick up singing as well in order to compete for his girl&#x27;s affection. The song makes references to &quot;Dr Noah Drake&quot; as well as to &quot;Jessie&#x27;s Girl&quot;. In a 2014 interview, Springfield said that although he had heard the title and was aware of the song&#x27;s existence and had met with Jimmy Hart in person, he had never actually heard the song.

Jonathan Coulton recorded the song &quot;Je Suis Rick Springfield&quot; about an American man trying to impress a French girl he just met in France by pretending to be Springfield. It was recorded in 2011 and appeared on the album &quot;Artificial Heart&quot;.

<text>A regiment is a military unit. Its role and size varies markedly, depending on the country, service, or specialisation.

In Medieval Europe, the term &quot;regiment&quot; denoted any large body of front-line soldiers, recruited or conscripted in one geographical area, by a leader who was often also the feudal lord &quot;in capite&quot; of the soldiers. Lesser barons of knightly rank could be expected to muster or hire a company or battalion from their manorial estate.

By the end of the 17th century, infantry regiments in most European armies were permanent units, with approximately 800 men and commanded by a colonel.

==Definitions==
During the modern era, the word &quot;regiment&quot; – much like &quot;corps&quot; – may have two somewhat divergent meanings, which refer to two distinct roles: 
# a front-line military formation; or
# an administrative or ceremonial unit.
In many armies, the first role has been assumed by independent battalions, battlegroups, task forces, brigades and other, similarly sized operational units. However, these non-regimental units tend to be short-lived; and regiments have tended to retain their traditional responsibilities for ceremonial duties, the recruitment of volunteers, induction of new recruits, individual morale and &quot;esprit de corps&quot;, and administrative roles (such as pay).

A regiment may consequently be a variety of sizes:
* smaller than a standard battalion, e.g. Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment;
* a battalion equivalent, e.g. 3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment;
* a brigade equivalent, e.g. 8th Marine Regiment (United States);
* several battalions, e.g. 
** 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard) and
** Royal Regiment of Scotland; or
* an entire arm of service, e.g.
** the Royal Australian Regiment includes all of the Australian Army&#x27;s regular infantry (other than reserve and special forces units), and
** the artillery units of the British Army are known collectively as the Royal Regiment of Artillery, which is sub-divided for operation purposes into field regiments.

== Historical origin ==
The French term &quot;régiment&quot; is considered to have entered military usage in Europe at the end of the 16th century, when armies evolved from collections of retinues who followed knights, to formally organised, permanent military forces. At that time, regiments were usually named after their commanding colonels, and disbanded at the end of the campaign or war; the colonel and his regiment might recruit from and serve several monarchs or countries. Later, it was customary to name the regiment by its precedence in the line of battle, and to recruit from specific places, called cantons. The oldest regiments which still exist, and their dates of establishment, include the French 1st Infantry Regiment (1479), the Spanish 9th Infantry Regiment “Soria” (1505; originally called &quot;Tercio de Nápoles&quot;), the Swedish Life Guards (1521), the British Honourable Artillery Company (1537) and the King&#x27;s Own Immemorial Regiment of Spain, first established in 1248 during the conquest of Seville by King Ferdinand the Saint.

In the 17th century, brigades were formed as units combining infantry, cavalry, and artillery that were more effective than the older, single-arms regiments; in many armies, brigades replaced regiments. Organisation and numbers did not follow any standardised pattern between or within armies during this period, with the only common factor being that each regiment had a single commander.

By the beginning of the 18th century, regiments in most European continental armies had evolved into permanent units with distinctive titles and uniforms, each under the command of a colonel. When at full strength, an infantry regiment normally comprised two field battalions of about 800 men each or 8–10 companies. In some armies, an independent regiment with fewer companies was labelled a demi-regiment. A cavalry regiment numbered 600 to 900 troopers, making up a single entity. On campaign, these numbers were soon reduced by casualties and detachments and it was sometimes necessary to amalgamate regiments or to withdraw them to a depot while recruits were obtained and trained.

With the widespread adoption of conscription in European armies during the nineteenth century, the regimental system underwent modification. Prior to World War I, an infantry regiment in the French, German, Russian, and other smaller armies would comprise four battalions, each with a full strength on mobilization of about 1,000 men. As far as possible, the separate battalions would be garrisoned in the same military district, so that the regiment could be mobilized and campaign as a 4,000 strong linked group of sub-units. A cavalry regiment by contrast made up a single entity of up to 1,000 troopers. A notable exception to this practice was the British line infantry system where the two regular battalions constituting a regiment alternated between &quot;home&quot; and &quot;foreign&quot; service and seldom came together as a single unit.

== Regimental system ==
In the regimental system, each regiment is responsible for recruiting, training, and administration; each regiment is permanently maintained and therefore the regiment will develop its unique because of its unitary history, traditions, recruitment, and function. Usually, the regiment is responsible for recruiting and administering all of a soldier&#x27;s military career. Depending upon the country, regiments can be either combat units or administrative units or both.

This is often contrasted to the &quot;continental system&quot; adopted by many armies. In the continental system, the division is the functional army unit, and its commander is the administrator of every aspect of the formation: his staff train and administer the soldiers, officers, and commanders of the division&#x27;s subordinate units. Generally, divisions are garrisoned together and share the same installations: thus, in divisional administration, a battalion commanding officer is just another officer in a chain of command. Soldiers and officers are transferred in and out of divisions as required.

Some regiments recruited from specific geographical areas, and usually incorporated the place name into the regimental name (e.g. Bangladesh Infantry Regiment). In other cases, regiments would recruit from a given age group within a nation (e.g. Zulu Impis), an ethnic group (e.g. the Gurkhas), or foreigners (e.g. the French Foreign Legion). In other cases, new regiments were raised for new functions within an army; e.g. the Fusiliers, the Parachute Regiment (British Army), U.S. Army 75th Ranger Regiment, and the Light Reaction Regiment (Philippine Army) .

Disadvantages of the regimental system are hazardous regimental competition, a lack of interchangeability between units of different regiments, and more pronounced &quot;old boy networks&quot; within the military that may hamper efficiency and fairness.

A key aspect of the regimental system is that the regiment or battalion is the fundamental tactical building block. This flows historically from the colonial period, when battalions were widely dispersed and virtually autonomous, but is easily adapted to a number of different purposes. For example, a regiment might include different types of battalions (e.g. infantry or artillery) of different origins (e.g. regular or reserve).

Within the regimental system, soldiers, and usually officers, are always posted to a tactical unit of their own regiment whenever posted to field duty. In addition to combat units, other organizations are very much part of the regimental family: regimental training schools, serving members on &quot;extra-regimental employment&quot;, regimental associations (retirees), bands and associated cadet groups. The aspects that an administrative regiment might have in common include a symbolic colonel-in-chief (often a member of the royal family), a colonel of the regiment or &quot;honorary colonel&quot; who protects the traditions and interests of the regimental family and insists on the maintenance of high standards, battle honours (honours earned by one unit of an administrative regiment are credited to the regiment), ceremonial uniforms, cap badges, peculiarities of insignia, stable belts, and regimental marches and songs. The regiment usually has a traditional &quot;home station&quot; or regimental depot, which is often a historic garrison that houses the regimental museum and regimental headquarters. The latter has a modest staff to support regimental committees and administer both the regular members and the association(s) of retired members.

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===

The regimental system is generally admired for the &quot;esprit de corps&quot; it engenders in its units&#x27; members, but efforts to implement it in countries with a previously existing continental system usually do not succeed. The system presents difficulties for military planners, who must deal with the problems of trying to keep soldiers of a regiment together throughout their careers and of administering separate garrisons, training and mess facilities. The regimental community of serving and retired members often makes it very difficult for planners to restructure forces by moving, merging or re-purposing units.

In those armies where the continental system exists, the regimental system is criticised as parochial and as creating unnecessary rivalry between different regiments. The question is also raised as to whether it is healthy to develop soldiers more loyal to their regiment than to the military in general. Regiments recruited from areas of political ferment (such as Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Quebec, India, etc.), tend to perform particularly well because of the loyalty their members exhibit to the regiments. Generally, the regimental system is found to function best in countries with small-to medium-sized military forces where the problems of administering vast numbers of personnel are not as prevalent. The regimental system works particularly well in an environment in which the prime role of the army consists of small-scale police actions and counterinsurgency operations, requiring prolonged deployment away from home. In such a situation, co-ordination between regiments is rarely necessary, and the esprit de corps of the regiment provides an emotional substitute for the sense of public approval that an army receives at home. This is particularly relevant to British experience during the days of the empire, where the army was virtually continuously engaged in low-intensity conflict with insurgents, and full-scale warfare was the exception rather than the rule.

A regimental system, since it is decentralized and the regiments are independent from each other, prevents the army from staging a coup d&#x27;état. This is best exemplified by the British Army: since the formation of the United Kingdom, there have been no military takeovers.

A regimental system can also foster close links between the regiment and the community from which it is recruited. This sense of community &#x27;ownership&#x27; over local regiments can be seen in the public outcry over recent regimental amalgamations in the United Kingdom. On the other hand, recruitment from a single community can lead to a concentrated and potentially devastating local impact if the regiment takes heavy casualties.

Further, the regimental system offers the advantage of grouping like units together for centralized administrative, training, and logistical purposes, thereby creating an &quot;economies of scale&quot; effect and its ensuing increased efficiency.

An illustrative example of this is the modular integration employed by the United States Marine Corps, which can take elements from its regimentally grouped forces and specifically tailor combined arms task forces for a particular mission or the deployed Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU). This is achievable partially because of the Marines mission adaptability, flexibility, philosophy, shared culture, history and overall esprit de corps, which allows for near seamless interoperability.

==Commonwealth armies==
In the British Army and armies modelled on it (such as the Australian, the New Zealand, the Canadian, the Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Myanmar and the Indian armies), the term &quot;regiment&quot; is used in two different ways: it can mean an administrative identity and grouping, or a tactical unit. In the former Dominion of Newfoundland, &quot;Regiment&quot; was used to describe the entirety of the fighting armed forces, the Royal Newfoundland Regiment.

In the Commonwealth countries listed above, the large administrative regiment has been the normal practice for many years. In the case of India, &quot;large regiments&quot; of four to five battalions date from 1923 and, since the 1950s, many of these have expanded even further. As an example, the Punjab Regiment of the Indian Army has expanded from four battalions in 1956 to its present strength of 20, while, in the Pakistan Army, several regiments have over 50 battalions.

In Canada, the regiment is a formation of one or more units; existing almost exclusively for reasons of heritage, the continuance of battle honors and &quot;esprit de corps&quot;. The three regular force infantry regiments each consist of three regular force battalions of approximately 600 soldiers, in addition to one or more reserve battalions. Canadian battalions are employed tactically and administratively within brigade groups.

In Australia, there is but one administrative infantry regiment in the regular army: the Royal Australian Regiment, consisting of all seven regular infantry battalions in the Army. The Australian Army Reserve also has state-based infantry regiments which administer the reserve infantry battalions.

In Pakistan, the word regiment is an administrative grouping. While individual battalions may have different roles (for example different battalions of the Frontier Force Regiment may be mechanized infantry, paratroop infantry, or mountain troops), the regiment is considered to encompass all of them.

===British Army===

The modern British regimental system came about as a result of the 19th century Cardwell Reforms.

In the British Army, for most purposes, the regiment is the largest &quot;permanent&quot; organisational unit. Above regimental level, the organisation is changed to meet the tasks at hand. Because of their permanent nature, many regiments have long histories, often going back for centuries: the oldest British regiment still in existence is the Royal Jersey Militia, established in 1337 although historically the Jersey Militia are referred to as a regiment it is disputed that they are in fact a corps. The Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment), formed in 1572, was the oldest infantry regiment. It now forms part of the Princess of Wales Royal Regiment.

In the United Kingdom, there existed until recently a number of administrative &quot;divisions&quot; in the infantry that encompassed several regiments, such as the Guards Division, the former Scottish Division (now a single regiment), or the Light Division (now also compressed into a multi-battalion single regiment). The reduction and consolidation of British infantry regiments that began in the late 1950s and concluded in 2006 has resulted in a system of administrative regiments each with several battalions, a band, a common badge and uniform etc.

In the British regimental system, the tactical regiment or battalion is the basic functional unit and its commanding officer more autonomous than in continental systems. Divisional and brigade commanders generally do not immerse themselves in the day-to-day functioning of a battalion – they can replace the commanding officer but will not micro-manage the unit. The regimental sergeant major is another key figure, responsible to the CO for unit discipline and the behaviour of the NCOs.

It should, however, be noted that amalgamations beginning in the late 1950s and ending in 2006 have diluted the British regimental system through the now almost universal adoption of &quot;large regiments&quot; for the infantry of the Army. As of 2014, only thirteen line infantry regiments survive, each comprising up to six of the former battalions that previously had separate regimental status. Only the five Guards regiments retain their historic separate identities. Similarly, as of 2015, only eight of the regiments of the Royal Armoured Corps (cavalry plus Royal Tank Regiments) survive.

====Armour====
Armoured regiments in Canada since the end of the Second World War have usually consisted of a single tactical regiment. During the 1960s, three Canadian regiments had both regular and militia components, which were disbanded shortly after unification in 1968. Currently, one regiment is organised with two tactical regiments, 12e Régiment blindé du Canada and 12e Régiment blindé du Canada (Milice) are both part of the administrative regiment 12e Régiment blindé du Canada.

One administrative armoured regiment of the British Army consisted of more than one tactical regiment. The Royal Tank Regiment until 2014 had two (1 and 2 RTR), and once had many more. They were all amalgamated into a single regiment.

====Artillery====
All of a nation&#x27;s artillery units are considered part of a single administrative regiment, but there are typically several tactical artillery regiments. They are designated by numbers, names or both. For example, the tactical regiments 1st Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, 7th Toronto Regiment, RCA and many others are part of the single administrative regiment The Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery. In Britain, the Royal Regiment of Artillery works in the same way.

====Infantry====
Administrative infantry regiments are composed of one or more battalions. When a regiment has only one battalion, the battalion may have exactly the same name as the regiment. For example, The North Saskatchewan Regiment is the only battalion in the administrative regiment of the same name. When there is more than one battalion, they are distinguished by numbers, subsidiary titles or both. In Britain, every infantry battalion bears a number, even if it is the only remaining battalion in the regiment (in that case it is the 1st Battalion, with the exception of The Irish Regiment of Canada, which has a 2nd Battalion only). Until after the Second World War, every regiment had at least two battalions. Traditionally, the regular battalions were the 1st and 2nd Battalions, the militia (later Special Reserve) battalion was the 3rd Battalion, and the Army Reserve battalions were the 4th Battalion, the 5th Battalion and up. A few regiments had up to four regular battalions and more than one militia battalion, which disrupted the numbering, but this was rare. For this reason, although the regular battalion today (if there is only one) will always be the 1st Battalion, the TA battalions may have non-consecutive numbers.

In practice, it is impossible to exercise all the administrative functions of a true regiment when the regiment consists of a single unit. Soldiers, and particularly officers, cannot spend a full career in one battalion. Thus in the Armoured Corps, the traditional administrative &quot;regiment&quot; tends to play more of a ceremonial role, while in practice, its members are administered by their corps or &quot;branch&quot; as in the Artillery. Thus soldiers and officers can serve in many different &quot;regiments&quot;, changing hat badges without too much concern during their career. Indeed, in the artillery, all regiments wear the same badge.

====Corps====
The British Army also has battalion-sized tactical regiments of the Royal Engineers, Royal Corps of Signals, Army Air Corps, Royal Logistic Corps, and Royal Military Police.

=== Indian Army ===
Upon its inception, the Indian Army inherited the British Army&#x27;s organisational structure, which is still maintained today. Therefore, like its predecessor, an Indian infantry regiment&#x27;s responsibility is not to undertake field operations but to provide battalions and well-trained personnel to the field formations. As such, it is common to find battalions of the same regiment spread across several brigades, divisions, corps, commands, and even theatres. Like its British and Commonwealth counterparts, troops enlisted within the regiment are immensely loyal, take great pride in the regiment to which they are assigned, and generally spend their entire career within the regiment.

Most Indian Army infantry regiments recruit based on certain selection criteria, such as region (for example, the Assam Regiment), caste/community (Jat Regiment), or religion (Sikh Regiment). Most regiments continue the heritage of regiments raised under the British Raj, but some have been raised after independence, some of which have specialised in border defence, in particular the Ladakh Scouts, the Arunachal Scouts, and the Sikkim Scouts.

Over the years there have been fears that troops&#x27; allegiance lay more with their regiments and the regions/castes/communities/religions from which they were recruited, as opposed to the Indian union as a whole. Thus some &quot;all India&quot; or &quot;all class&quot; regiments have been created, which recruit troops from all over India, regardless of region, caste, community, or religion: such as the Brigade of the Guards (which later converted to the mechanised infantry profile) and the Parachute Regiment.

The Indian Army has many regiments, majority of them infantry, with single-battalion cavalry and artillery regiments. These are a legacy of the British Indian army during the years when the British ruled India before 15 August 1947. Each infantry regiment may have one or more battalions, while cavalry, armour and artillery regiments are single-battalion formations. There are regimental headquarters (called as a centre) for each regiment.

Each regiment of infantry is commanded by a colonel and assisted by a lieutenant colonel.

=== Irish Army ===
The Irish Army field artillery units are called regiments. They are divided into batteries and together the regiments form the Artillery Corps. Air Defence units are organised as a single regiment with individual batteries stationed around the country.

==Philippine Army== 
The Philippine Army currently has 3 regiments dedicated to special operations under the AFP Special Operations Command. They specialized in direct action, jungle warfare, urban warfare, special reconnaissance, unconventional warfare, psychological warfare, counter-terrorism, mass base and sniping operations against hostile positions depending on the situation of a certain place.

===Scout Rangers=== 
 
The Scout Rangers, known officially as the First Scout Ranger Regiment, specializes in anti-guerrilla jungle warfare, raids, ambushes, close quarters combat, urban warfare and sabotage. It was formed on November 25, 1950, under the command of former AFP Vice Chief of Staff and Defense Secretary Rafael M. Ileto. It was modelled after two legendary fighting groups, the intelligence gathering American Alamo Scouts and the combat ready US Army Rangers. It was also formed to combat insurgencies such as the Communist and Moro Rebellions. It currently have more than 2500 Members.

===Special Forces=== 

The Special Forces Regiment (Airborne) is a special forces unit of the Philippine Army. It is based on and continually trains with its American counterpart, the U.S. Army Special Forces (Green Berets). It was established in 1962 by then Captain Fidel V. Ramos PA (INF) (first commanding officer of the SFR-A), primarily trained in both unconventional warfare operations and psychological warfare operations. 
Like the Scout Rangers, members of the Special Forces Regiment of the Philippine Army are also highly trained in counter-insurgency operations. Upon assignment to the Special Forces, soldiers are made to undergo the Basic Airborne Course. They, later-on, undergo the Special Forces Operations Course - an eight-month course that equips each SF soldier in the basics of Special Forces and unconventional warfare operations. Each member of the SF Regiment may opt to undergo specialty courses as well after finishing the Special Forces basic course. These include, but is not limited to, training in demolitions and bomb disposal (EOD), psychological warfare operations (PSYOPS), riverine operations including combat diving, intelligence operations, weapons, medics, as well as VIP security training in preparation for reassignment with the Presidential Security Group. 
The basic combat organization of the Special Forces is the 12-man Special Forces Team. An SF Team will have at least one of each SF MOS present in the team.

===Light Reaction Regiment=== 
 
The Light Reaction Regiment is the premier counter-terrorist unit of the Philippine Army. It was formerly known as the Light Reaction Battalion and Light Reaction Company. Due to its specialization in counter-terrorism operations and its formation with the assistance of American advisers, the Light Reaction Regiment has been sometimes referred to as the Philippines&#x27; Delta Force. It traces its origins back to the year 2000 when non-commissioned officers from the Scout Rangers and 1st Special Forces Regiment (Airborne) were trained by American military advisers from the 1st Battalion, 1st Special Forces Group.

==Russian/Soviet Armed Forces==

The regiments () of the Russian Army and armed forces influenced by Russia consist of battalions (), in the infantry or tank troops, () in the artillery troops, and squadrons () in aviation troops. Land forces regiments are subdivided into companies () (or batteries in the artillery) and platoons (). These also include many support units of either company or platoon size.

On the march, a regiment normally travels in column along one or two routes, averaging 20–30 km/h when moving on roads or 15 km/h going cross-country. The main force is preceded by reconnaissance and advanced guards and protected on the flanks and the rear by security elements. When offensive operations begin, a regiment normally assumes attack formation about 1,000 metres from the enemy&#x27;s position and attacks along a front typically 4 to 5 kilometres wide, but can vary between 3 and 8 kilometres. During the attack the average speed of advance is 200 metres per minute with BTRs or BMPs normally following 100 to 400 metres behind tanks and 50 to 100 metres of spacing between vehicles.

===Motor Rifle Regiment===
The Motor Rifle Regiment was one of the basic tactical units within the Soviet Ground Forces, totaling around 2,500 officers and other ranks. While normally operating as part of a Motor Rifle Division or Tank Division, it was capable of short-term independent operations. By the late 1980s, it consisted of a regimental headquarters in command of three Motor Rifle Battalions, each numbering around five hundred personnel and equipped with either BMP infantry fighting vehicles or BTR armoured personnel carriers, and one Tank Battalion, typically consisting of thirty-one T-64, T-72 or T-80 tanks, although older models were present in units outside the European theater. These were supported by a battalion of eighteen 122mm artillery pieces, either the self-propelled 2S1 Gvozdika in BMP regiments or towed D-30 howitzers in BTR regiments, though some BTR regiments also used the 2S1, with additional fire support from the organic mortar battery in each infantry battalion. Additional combat support came in the form of an air defence missile and artillery company with four SA-9 or SA-13s and four ZSU-23-4 or 2S6 Tunguskas, an antitank missile battery with nine BRDM-mounted AT-3 Sagger or AT-5 Spandrel launchers, a reconnaissance company mounted on BMPs, BRDMs and motorbikes and an engineer company. Other non-combat formations included a signals company, chemical protection platoon, material support company, maintenance company, and regimental medical point.

===Tank Regiment===
The Tank Regiment was found in both Motorised Rifle Divisions and Tank Divisions, with slight organisational differences depending between the two. By the late 1980s, Tank Regiments operating as part of Motorised Rifle Divisions contained slightly over 1,100 officers and other ranks while those operating within Tank Divisions contained over 1,600. A regimental headquarters oversaw command of three Tank Battalions of thirty-one tanks each, typically T-64, T-72, or T-80 tanks although some units used older models, and an artillery battalion of eighteen 2S1 Gvozdika self-propelled howitzers, with some using the older towed D-30 howitzer. Tank Regiments operating as part of a Tank Division included a fifth combat battalion of motorised infantry, identical to those in BMP-equipped Motorised Rifle Regiments. Combat support and combat service support subunits were the same as in Motorised Rifle Regiments with the exception of the antitank missile battery.

===Artillery Regiment===
The Artillery Regiment was used to provide fire support, but differed depending on whether it was part of a Motorised Rifle Division or Tank Division. The artillery regiment of an MRD consisted of three battalions of eighteen 2S3 Akatsiyas each and a battalion of eighteen BM-21 Grads, numbering just under 1,300 personnel total, while a TD artillery regiment had one less battalion of 2S3s and a little over one thousand personnel total. This was the standard model by the late 1980s, however not all artillery regiments had yet to conformed to it and one or more of the battalions might have used older weapon systems like the D-30 howitzer. Each regiment was led by a command control battery and included an artillery reconnaissance battery, motor transport company, maintenance company, regimental medical point, chemical protection platoon and supply and service platoon.

=== Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment ===
An Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment was an important part of a motor rifle division or Tank Division&#x27;s effort to envelop the battlefield in an extensive air defence network. Numbering a little over five hundred personnel total, the SAM regiment consisted of a regimental headquarters in charge of twenty SA-6 Gainfuls organised into five missile firing batteries; most were SA-6a platforms although since 1979 a limited number of SA-6bs were also deployed and some regiments used the SA-8 Gecko as an alternative. Each missile battery, along with the regimental headquarter and missile technical battery, were also equipped with three MANPADs, either the SA-7 Grail, SA-14 Gremlin or SA-16 Gimlet. Besides the missile technical battery, other support subunits included an artillery reconnaissance battery, motor transport company, maintenance company and chemical protection platoon.

=== Antiaircraft Artillery Regiment ===
Antiaircraft artillery (AAA) regiments in the late 1980s took the place of SAM regiments in divisions which were assigned to rear areas. These were equipped with twenty-four S-60 57mm Anti Aircraft Guns organised into four firing batteries. Each firing battery along with the regimental headquarters were also equipped with three MANPADs, either the SA-7 Grail, SA-14 Gremlin or SA-16 Gimlet. Additional subunits include a command and control battery and service battery.

== United States ==

Historically, the United States Army was organized into regiments, except from 1792 to 1796 during the existence of the Legion of the United States. During this period the Army, or &quot;Legion&quot;, was organized into four &quot;sub-legions&quot;, 18th century forerunners of the modern combined arms brigade that combined infantry, riflemen, artillery, and cavalry. When combined with other regiments during wartime, for active field operations, regiments were further formed into brigades and divisions.

From colonial times, the regiment consisted of a small regimental headquarters (regimental headquarters companies not existing before 1915) and in 1775 ten &quot;line&quot; companies, based on the British Army model, without any permanent intermediate level of organization, viz., battalion headquarters organic to the regiment. From 1776 through 1783 American infantry regiments contained from as few as seven companies (e.g. South Carolina Rifles) to as many as twelve (Pennsylvania Rifles and Maryland State troops) with Continental Army infantry regiments having eight companies (increased to nine in 1781). (Briefly, from 1790 to 1792, regiments were organized into three battalions of four companies each.) Traditionally, the regiment and battalion were one and the same, with the &quot;battalion&quot; simply being the regiment organized for battle.

During the Civil War, there were nine new United States regular army infantry regiments (11th though the 19th) added to the ten already existing. The old regiments (1st through 10th) were single-battalion, ten-company regiments, but the new regiments were authorized three battalions of eight companies each. However, only three of these nine regiments ever reached full strength of three battalions, with four others only achieving a manning level of two full battalions. Regiments were usually commanded by a colonel, assisted by a lieutenant colonel and a major, as well as additional staff officers and enlisted men in the regimental headquarters. Occasionally, a regimental commander would organize several companies into one, or rarely two, temporary organizations, called battalions, under command of the regiment&#x27;s lieutenant colonel, major, or a senior captain. (A historic example of this arrangement is the 7th Cavalry Regiment during the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876.)

Many more additional regiments of the United States Volunteers were recruited from each state during the American Civil War according to General Orders No. 15., War Department, Adjutant General&#x27;s Office, Washington, May 4, 1861:

In 1890, the number of companies in a regiment was reduced from the traditional ten to only eight, as the end of the Indian Wars became evident and troop reductions became in order. However, in 1898 as the war with Spain began, a three-battalion, 12-company structure was effected. This expanded regimental structure produced units, proportionally roughly the same approximate size as the single battalion, ten-company regiments of the Civil War. (For example: 101 officers and enlisted men per company, and a 36-member regimental headquarters, with 1,046 per typical Union Army infantry regiment in 1861, vs. 112 officers and enlisted men per company, and the same 36-member regimental headquarters, with 1,380 per regiment in a typical U.S. Army infantry regiment in 1898.) After the short war the Army reduced the size of companies, battalions, and regiments by about 30% under demobilization. However, the number of companies and battalions per regiment remained at 12 and three, respectively.

Until 1917, under its traditional triangular organizational plan, infantry regiments were organized into brigades of three regiments, with three infantry brigades (for a total of nine infantry regiments), along with one brigade each of cavalry and field artillery constituting a division. In 1917 the Army adopted the square division organizational plan, which massively increased the size of units from the company through corps, more than tripling, or nearly quadrupling, the number of troops per unit. (From 1915 to 1917, the authorized strength of rifle companies increased from 76 officers and enlisted men to 256, and infantry regiments grew from 959 to 3,720.)

The &quot;square division&quot; consisted of two infantry brigades of two infantry regiments each, with each regiment containing a regimental headquarters company, a machinegun company, a supply company, and 12 rifle companies organized into three battalions of four rifle companies each. (The single machine gun company reported directly to regimental headquarters.) The division also contained an artillery brigade of three regiments and three separate combat service support regiments: engineer, quartermaster, and medical.

The Army reorganized in preparation for the Second World War by effecting its triangular division organizational structure in 1939. Under this plan, divisional brigades were eliminated and the division consisted of three infantry regiments and one artillery regiment, styled as &quot;Division Artillery&quot;, but usually consisting of battalions of the same regiment. The infantry regiments still contained three battalions; there were now &quot;headquarters and headquarters&quot; companies (HHCs) not only at the regimental-level but in each battalion as well. The battalions still contained four &quot;line&quot; companies, but instead of four rifle companies, now had three rifle companies and a heavy weapons company (containing machine guns and mortars). The regiment&#x27;s machine gun company became an anti-tank company, the supply company became the service company, and a cannon company and a medical detachment were added to the regiment. In 1942 the Army began organizing armored divisions into combat commands, which grouped armor, armored infantry, and armored field artillery battalions into three tactical groups within the division without regard to regimental affiliation. However, armored regiment designations were retained for lineage and heraldic purposes.

As the United States Army transformed after the Korean War for potential combat against a nuclear-armed Warsaw Pact, changes began in 1956 to transform infantry regiments into battle groups under its new Pentomic organization. Under this plan, battalions were eliminated and the infantry battle groups consisted of an Headquarters and Headquarters Company, five rifle companies, and a combat support company. This scheme retained the regimental designation for lineage and heraldry purposes, but the regiment ceased to exist as an intact organization for both infantry and field artillery units. The Divisional Artillery were now composed of several unrelated artillery battalions.

By 1965, the Army had eliminated the regiment (replaced by the brigade) under the Reorganization Objective Army Divisions (ROAD) plan as a tactical and administrative organization in all combat arms, save for a few armored cavalry regiments. However the battalion was restored as a tactical echelon, now organized into an HHC, three rifle companies, and a combat support company. The ROAD structure sealed the fate of the regiment in the U.S. Army, confirming its elimination as a level of command that had begun in 1942 with the &quot;combat command&quot; organization of the armored divisions and furthered by the Pentomic experiment in the 1950s. By 2015, the only Army unit still organized as a traditional regiment was the 75th Ranger Regiment.

In the 20th century, by using modern industrial management techniques, the Army was able to draft, assemble, equip, train and then employ huge masses of conscripted civilians in very short order, starting with minimal resources. Beginning with the First World War, as units became increasingly larger, and weapon systems and equipment became more complex, the regiment, while still filling a role as the immediate headquarters for its organic battalions, began to be replaced by the brigade as the intermediate tactical and operational headquarters for battalions, with the division becoming the senior administrative and logistical headquarters for the battalions, regiments, and brigades under its command.

A new system, the Combat Arms Regimental System, or CARS, was adopted in 1957 to replace the old regimental system. CARS uses the Army&#x27;s traditional regiments as parent organizations for historical purposes, but the primary building blocks are divisions, brigades, and battalions. Each battalion carries an association with a parent regiment, even though the regimental organization no longer exists. In some brigades several numbered battalions carrying the same regimental association may still serve together, and tend to consider themselves part of the traditional regiment when in fact they are independent battalions serving a brigade, rather than a regimental, headquarters.

The United States Army Regimental System (USARS) was established in 1981 to replace the Combat Arms Regimental System, to provide each soldier with continuous identification with a single regiment, and to support that concept with a personnel system that would increase a soldier&#x27;s probability of serving recurring assignments with his or her regiment. The USARS was developed with the intention that it would enhance combat effectiveness by providing the opportunity for a regimental affiliation, thus obtaining some of the benefits of the traditional regimental system.

Exceptions exist to USARS regimental titles, including the armored cavalry regiments (now defunct) and the 75th Ranger Regiment created in 1986. On 1 October 2005, the word &quot;regiment&quot; was formally appended to the name of all active and inactive CARS and USARS regiments. So, for example, the 1st Cavalry officially became titled the 1st Cavalry Regiment.

=== United States Marine Corps ===
The historical background of the use of regiments in the United States Marine Corps (USMC) is contained within &quot;USMC: A Complete History&quot; and a summary of that information follows:

From the American Revolution until 1913 it was common practice for USMC detachments (both ship-based, and shore-based) to be combined to form provisional units. Most often these formations took the form of provisional battalions, but on occasion became provisional regiments, provisional brigades, or rarely (especially when combined with Navy personnel) naval infantry brigades. These organizations were intentionally temporary as the USMC did not usually maintain standing forces larger than company size, but rather created &quot;task units&quot; on an &quot;as needed&quot; basis.

While provisional regiments, designated variously as the 1st through 4th Regiments, had been formed for expeditionary operations in Panama (1895) and Philippines (1899), the lineage of modern USMC regiments began in 1913 with the creation of the 1st and 2nd Advanced Base Force Regiments. These two regiments, (currently the 2nd and 1st Marines, respectively), along with the numerical forebears of the 3rd and 4th Marines, (formed in 1914 for the short-lived Tampico Affair with Mexico, involving the occupation of Veracruz), are the pre-World War I antecedents to the several regiments of the modern USMC.

Beginning in World War I, with the USMC&#x27;s participation with the U.S. Army in the American Expeditionary Force, in which the 5th and 6th Marines (along with the 6th Machine Gun Battalion) formed the 4th Marine Brigade of the U.S. Army 2nd Division, the USMC began organizing larger standing forces. World War I–era USMC units mirrored equivalent U.S. Army units by employing the &quot;square division&quot; organizational plan in forming its regiments and brigades.

During the Second World War, the USMC organized its regiments and divisions under the &quot;triangular division&quot; model developed by the Army in 1939. Modern USMC regiments and divisions continue to be organized using a triangular model very similar to the WWII version, with slight variations to adapt to modern weapons, equipment, and enlisted rank structure.

Current Marine infantry, field artillery, and combat logistics battalions are organized into regiments, commanded by a colonel. Marine infantry and field artillery regiments are sequentially numbered and are referred to generically as &quot;&quot;n&quot;th Marines&quot; or &quot;&quot;n&quot;th Marine Regiment&quot;, as in 1st Marines (an infantry regiment) or 12th Marine Regiment (a field artillery regiment). Marine infantry regiments consist of a regimental headquarters and service company (H&amp;S Co) and three identical infantry battalions. Marine field artillery regiments consist of a regimental headquarters and service battery (H&amp;S Bttry), a target acquisition battery, and from two to four field artillery battalions.

Marine logistics groups (MLG) contain two types of regiments; one headquarters (HQ) regiment (except in the Reserve 4th MLG) and two combat logistics regiments (CLR). Each of these two types of regiments contain a headquarters company and varying numbers and types of logistics battalions and separate logistics companies, depending upon whether the regiment&#x27;s primary mission is to provide direct support to (1) a regimental combat team (RCT) or a Marine amphibious unit (MEU), or (2) provide general support across the Marine expeditionary force (MEF), including intermediate ground logistics support to Marine aviation units. These varying types of battalions and separate companies include: combat logistics, maintenance, and supply battalions, and combat logistics, communications, food service, and service companies (the latter three types in 3rd MLG only).

The HQ regiments (whose primary mission includes providing support to the MEUs) are not numbered; however, the CLRs are numbered according to their primary mission. CLRs that support RCTs have the same number as the parent Marine division of its supported RCT. Therefore, CLR 2 supports the RCTs of the 2nd Marine Division. CLRs that provide general maintenance and supply support to the MEF are designated by a two-digit number: the first digit is the Hindu-Arabic numeral equivalent of the MEF&#x27;s roman numeral designation, and the second digit is always an arbitrarily assigned numeral &quot;5&quot;. Therefore, the CLR that provides general maintenance and supply support to III MEF is CLR 35.

The USMC deploys battalions from its infantry regiments to form the nucleus of a battalion landing team (BLT) as the ground combat element (GCE) of a Marine expeditionary unit (MEU). However, a USMC infantry regiment may deploy en masse to form the nucleus of an RCT or regimental landing team (RLT) as the GCE of a Marine expeditionary brigade (MEB). In both cases the infantry component is reinforced with ground combat support forces including field artillery, reconnaissance, assault amphibian vehicle, light armored reconnaissance vehicle, tank, and combat engineer units. The resulting GCE is then combined with an aviation combat element (ACE), a logistics combat element (LCE), and a command element (CE) to form a Marine air-ground task force (MAGTF).

<doc id="166654" wikidata="Q304673" url="?curid=166654" title="Platoon">
<text>A platoon is a military unit typically composed of two to four squads, sections, or patrols. Platoon organization varies depending on the country and the branch, but a platoon can be composed of 20–50 troops, although specific platoons may range from 10 to 100 people. A platoon is typically the smallest military unit led by a commissioned officer. The platoon leader is usually a junior officer—a second or first lieutenant or an equivalent rank. The officer is usually assisted by a platoon sergeant.

Rifle platoons normally consist of a small platoon headquarters and three or four sections (Commonwealth) or squads (United States). In some armies, platoon is used throughout the branches of the army. In a few armies, such as the French Army, a platoon is specifically a cavalry unit, and the infantry use &quot;section&quot; as the equivalent unit. A unit consisting of several platoons is called a company or a battery.

== Etymology ==

According to Merriam-Webster, the word came into the English language via the French &quot;peloton&quot; (&quot;small detachment&quot;), from the Middle French &quot;pelote&quot; (&quot;little ball&quot;) and derived from the Low Latin &quot;pilotta&quot;, itself derived from the Classical Latin &quot;pila&quot;. The use of the word is first attested in c. 1547, referring to &quot;a subdivision of a company-sized military unit normally consisting of two or more squads or sections&quot;.&quot; The meaning was a group of soldiers firing a volley together, while a different platoon reloaded. This suggests an augmentative intention. Since soldiers were often organized in two or three lines, each firing its volley together, this would have normally meant platoons organized so that half or a third of the company is firing at once.

The platoon was originally a firing unit rather than an organization. While the system is claimed in the 1829 London Encyclopaedia to have been introduced by Gustavus Adolphus the Great of Sweden in 1618, the &quot;peloton&quot; appears to predate his birth. In the French Army in the 1670s, a battalion was divided into 18 platoons who were grouped into three &quot;firings&quot; with each platoon either firing or reloading at any given time during a fusillade. This system was also used in the British, Austrian, Russian and Dutch armies.

==NATO==

NATO defines a platoon, or detachment, as an organization larger than a section but smaller than a company. The standard NATO symbol for a platoon consists of three dots (●●●) placed above a framed unit icon. Member nations have stipulated the different names they use for organizations of this size.

==Australia==
In the Australian Army, an infantry platoon has thirty-six soldiers organized into three eight-man sections and a twelve-man maneuver support section, with a lieutenant as platoon commander and a sergeant as platoon sergeant, accompanied by a platoon signaller and sometimes a platoon medic (full strength of forty men). A section comprises eight soldiers led by a corporal with a lance corporal as second in command. Each section has two fireteams (sometimes three) of four men, one led by the corporal and the other by the lance corporal. Each fireteam (also called a &quot;brick&quot; by Australian soldiers) has one soldier with an F89 Minimi LSW and the other three armed with F88 Steyr assault rifles. One rifle per fireteam has an attached 40 mm grenade launcher; one of the grenadiers is the lance corporal. Fireteam bravo has a HK417 7.62mm for the designated marksman role. More recently, the designated marksman of each Australian fireteam has been issued the HK417 in Afghanistan and possibly afterwards. The platoon may also have three MAG 58 general-purpose machine guns, one M2 Browning heavy machine gun or a Mk 19 grenade launcher at its disposal.

==Bangladesh==
In the Bangladesh Army, infantry regiments have platoons commanded by a warrant officer, assisted by a sergeant. The platoon strength is typically 32 soldiers. The platoon headquarter consists of 5 men; the platoon commander, sergeant, a radio operator and 2 soldiers carrying a rocket launcher. The platoon HQ commands 3 rifle section of 9 men each. A section led by a corporal, who&#x27;s assisted by a lance corporal. Each section also has 2 light machine gunners.

==Canada==
In the Canadian Army, the infantry platoon commander is a second lieutenant, lieutenant or a junior captain assisted by a platoon warrant (who holds the rank of warrant officer, but can be a sergeant). It is usually divided into three eight to ten person sections and a heavy weapons detachment that deploys a GPMG, and a Carl Gustav rifle, depending on mission requirements. Sections are commanded by a sergeant or master corporal with a master corporal or corporal in the second in command position; two members of a section carry C9 LMGs and the remainder carry C7 or C8 assault rifles fitted with either optics or a grenade launcher. A section is broken into two assault groups, similar to the British and Australian organization.

Three infantry platoons make up a typical infantry company, sometimes with a heavy weapons or support platoon in addition. Specialist platoons, like reconnaissance, or &quot;recce&quot; platoons, that may be attached to a battalion may be led by a captain and assisted by a warrant officer. Some large specialist platoons may have a lieutenant as the second-in-command. In many corps, platoon-sized units are called troops instead. Prior to 1940, a platoon might be commanded by either a warrant officer or a lieutenant. An officer was referred to as &quot;platoon commander&quot;, while a warrant officer in the same position was called a platoon sergeant major.

==Colombia==
Within the Colombian Army, a training platoon (in Spanish &quot;pelotón&quot;) is often commanded by a higher-ranking soldier known as a &quot;dragoneante&quot;, who is selected for his excellence in discipline and soldiering skills. However, a &quot;dragoneante&quot; is still a soldier and can be removed from his position if his commander sees fit. For combatant platoons (platoons engaged in combat with guerrilla rebels), a corporal or sergeant would be the most likely commander.

==France==
Under the 1971 regulations a peloton in the French Army was used in the equivalent manner to a company, with the first section led by the sous-lieutenant and the second section led by the lieutenant, a captain commanding the entire group. In the French military, a peloton is a mainly a term designating a mobile infantry unit. An escadron is a unit of battle tank in cavalry or armor, but in some mechanized infantry regiments (&quot;groupe de chasseurs mécanisés&quot;), the tank platoon is also called &quot;peloton de char de combat.&quot; The peloton or escadron corresponds to the platoon, equivalent in size to an infantry section and commanded by a lieutenant or sergeant. It may also mean a body of officers in training to become noncommissioned officers, &quot;sous-officiers&quot; or officers (&quot;peloton de caporal, peloton des sous-officiers&quot;).

==Georgia==
The Georgian Armed Forces equivalent of the platoon is the ozeuli. Translated, it means &quot;Group of 20&quot; but has no connection with the number. It has been transferred into modern usage from medieval army reforms of the Georgian King David the Builder. Originally, it was meant to be a small detachment of 20 men to be led by a leader of corresponding rank. Almost all smaller formations are based on the designations of those reforms, which originally suggested tactical flexibility by keeping the size of small units in round numbers (10, 20, 100). Battalions and brigades were not affected by that system. It is unknown whether that usage was abandoned in the 1820s or earlier, but in present days a Georgian platoon still called &quot;Ozeuili&quot; has a similar size to that of other armies. Normally for infantry it has 32 men but can vary depending on the type of unit.

==Germany==

The German Army equivalent of the platoon is the Zug (same word as for &quot;train&quot;, &quot;draught&quot;, &quot;move&quot; or &quot;streak&quot;), consisting of a &quot;Zugtrupp&quot; (&quot;platoon troop&quot; or platoon headquarters squad), of four to six men, and three squads (&quot;Gruppen&quot;) of eight to eleven men each. An &quot;Oberfeldwebel&quot; (&quot;sergeant first class&quot;) is in charge of the &quot;Zugtrupp&quot;. The &quot;Zugtrupp&quot; provides support for the platoon leader and acts as a reserve force (such as two additional snipers or an anti-tank weapon crew).

Three &quot;Züge&quot; make up a &quot;Kompanie&quot; (&quot;company&quot;). The first platoon, until 2013, used to be commanded by an &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; (&quot;first lieutenant&quot;) or a &quot;Leutnant&quot; (&quot;second lieutenant&quot;), nowadays it is usually a &quot;Hauptmann&quot; (&quot;captain&quot;), who is also the &quot;Kompanie&quot;&#x27;s second-in-command. The second &quot;Zug&quot; is led by an &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; or a &quot;Leutnant&quot;, the third &quot;Zug&quot; is led by experienced NCOs, usually a &quot;Hauptfeldwebel&quot; (&quot;master sergeant&quot;). In the first platoon, the platoon leader&#x27;s assistant is a &quot;Hauptfeldwebel&quot;; in the second and third platoons, the assistant is an &quot;Oberfeldwebel&quot;. Each squad is led by an &quot;Oberfeldwebel&quot;, and its size corresponds to the typical passenger capacity of its squad vehicle (either wheeled or armored). Another of these vehicles is used for the &quot;Zugtrupp&quot;. Sergeants of inferior rank act as assistant squad leaders in the other squads.

A &quot;Fallschirmjägerzug&quot; (&quot;airborne infantry platoon&quot;) has special operations responsibilities and has command positions one rank higher than corresponding positions in a standard infantry platoon. A captain (&quot;Hauptmann&quot;) is the platoon leader, assisted by a first lieutenant and each squad has a second lieutenant or a master sergeant in charge, often supported by a long-service sergeant or skilled senior corporal.

==Hungary==
In the Hungarian Armed Forces, a rifle platoon is commanded by either a second lieutenant or a first lieutenant, with a platoon sergeant (with the rank of sergeant major), a platoon signaller, an armored personnel carrier (APC) driver and an APC gunner composing the platoon headquarters. There is also in the HQ&#x27;s TO&amp;E a designated marksman rifle—either an SVD or a Szép sniper rifle. The platoon is sub-divided into three squads, each with eight soldiers. Each squad is commanded by a sergeant. His/her deputy has an RPG, there are also two soldiers with PKM machine guns, two with AK-63 assault rifles—one is an RPG grenadier, the other is the medic—the APC driver and the APC gunner. Each squad and the platoon headquarters is equipped with an BTR-80 armored personnel carrier. In total, the platoon comprises 29 soldiers, of whom eight are vehicle crew.

==India==
In the Indian army, a platoon consists of three sections. Platoons are commanded by junior commissioned officers (JCOs). Sections are the smallest components in the Indian army consisting of ten men and commanded by a havildar. In the Corps of Engineers, a platoon in an engineer company (referred to as a &quot;field company&quot;) differs from an infantry platoon, in that it has four sections of ten man, comprising nine sappers and an NCO, and is referred to as a &quot;field platoon&quot;.

==Israel==
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) uses platoons (Hebrew: , literally &quot;divisions&quot;) as the basic unit composing the company and usually consists of 20 to 40 soldiers (or 3–4 tanks in the Armored Corps). Those soldiers are divided into 2–4 &quot;classes&quot; () or teams (), each composing of 6–21 soldiers. The platoon is the smallest military unit commanded by a commissioned officer—and all officers graduating from the IDF&#x27;s Officer&#x27;s Academy receive a &quot;platoon commander&quot; pin, even if they are not intended to command a platoon. The platoon commander is usually the equivalent of first or second lieutenant and is assisted and advised by a platoon sergeant, acting as his replacement. In some elite units, such as Maglan, Egoz or Duvdevan, the teams are usually smaller and commanded by officers, with the platoon commanded by a higher-ranking officer, while in special forces units like Shayetet 13 and Sayeret Matkal all combatants are officers.

== Myanmar ==
In Myanmar, a Platoon is called တပ်စု (Tat Su). A Rifle Platoon has an authorised strength of 1 Officer and 34 Other Ranks. A total of 35 soldiers. The platoon is commanded by either a Lieutenant (ဗိုလ်) or a Captain (ဗိုလ်ကြီး) who is assisted by a Sergeant (တပ်ကြပ်ကြီး) as of the structure. A Platoon has 3 Sections all of which are commanded by a Corporal (တပ်ကြပ်) with a Lance Corporal (ဒုတပ်ကြပ်) as 2IC. A Section is called တပ်စိတ် (Tat Sate). A Platoon HQ consist of Platoon Commander (Lieutenant/Captain), Platoon Second in Command (Sergeant), Mortar Crew 1 (Private), Mortar Crew 2 (Private) and a Signaller (Private). As of the authorised structure, the mortar is a MA 9 60mm Commando Mortar. The Platoon is structured as below:

Platoon HQ (1 Officer, 4 Other Ranks):

Platoon Officer Commanding (Platoon Commander): Lieutenant/Captain: MA 3 Carbine, MA 5 Pistol

Platoon Second in Command (Platoon Sergeant): Sergeant: MA 3 Carbine

Mortar Crew 1: Private: MA 9 60mm Commando Mortar

Mortar Crew 2: Private: MA 3 Carbine

Signaller: Private: MA 3 Carbine

No. (1) Rifle Section (10 Other Ranks): Corporal

No. (2) Rifle Section (10 Other Ranks): Corporal

No. (3) Rifle Section (10 Other Ranks): Corporal

Each Section, consisting of 10 Other Ranks, is structured with:

Section HQ and MG Team: 4 Other Ranks

Section Commander: Corporal: MA 3 Carbine

Section Second in Command/MG Team Commander: Lance Corporal: MA 3 Carbine

Gunner: Private: MA 2 Light Machine Gun

Gunner; Private: MA 2 Light Machine Gun

Team 1: 3 Other Ranks

Team Commander: Lance Corporal: MA 1 Assault Rifle

Grenadier: Private: MA 4 Assault Rifle (MA 1 with UBGL)

Rifleman: Private: MA 1 Assault Rifle

Team 2: 3 Other Ranks

Team Commander: Lance Corporal: MA 1 Assault Rifle

Grenadier: Private: MA 4 Assault Rifle (MA 1 with UBGL)

Rifleman: Private: MA 1 Assault Rifle 

==New Zealand==
In the New Zealand Army, an infantry platoon is commanded by a 2nd lieutenant or a lieutenant, with a platoon sergeant, a platoon signaller and a medic (where relevant) composing the platoon headquarters. The platoon is sub-divided into three section of between 7-10 soldiers, each commanded by a corporal with a lance-corporal as the section second in command. Each section can be sub-divided into two fire-teams, commanded by the section commander and second in command respectively, as well as normal two man scout, rifle and gun teams. There are three platoons in a rifle company, which is commanded by a major, and three rifle companies in an infantry battalion, which is commanded by a lieutenant-colonel. An infantry battalion contains an organic support company (mortars, machine guns, etc.) and a logistics company (transport and stores).

==Philippines==
Philippine Army rifle platoons consists of three squads, each with nine men. The nine men of a squad are grouped into two smaller &quot;fire teams&quot;, each comprising four troops: a team leader (corporal armed with a R4 assault rifle and a M203 grenade launcher), an automatic rifleman (armed with a K3 squad automatic weapon), a rifleman (armed with a R4; also brings extra ammunition for the K3), and a designated marksman who used to be armed by a M-14 before the Army shifted to the R4 for this role. The squad leader is typically a sergeant while the platoon leader is typically a 2nd lieutenant on his first assignment. The lieutenant is supported by a platoon sergeant. A radioman and a medic is usually supplied by the battalion. Philippine Marine Corps rifle platoons are similar in organization and concept to Philippine Army rifle platoons.

==Russia==
A motorized rifle platoon in the Soviet Armed Forces was mounted in either BTR armored personnel carriers or BMP infantry fighting vehicles, with the former being more numerous into the late 1980s. Both were led by a platoon leader and assistant platoon leader and consisted of three 9-man rifle squads mounted in three vehicles. In both BMP and BTR squads, the driver and vehicle gunner stayed with the vehicle when the rest of the squad dismounted, and one squad in the platoon would have one of their rifleman armed with an SVD sniper rifle. There was either one empty seat in each BTR or two empty seats in each BMP to accommodate the platoon leader and assistant platoon leader.

Tank platoons prior to the late 1980s consisted of a platoon headquarters squad and three tank squads, each consisting of one T-64, T-72 or T-80 tank for 12 personnel and 4 tanks total; platoons that used the older T-54, T-55 or T-62s added another crewmember for a total of 16. However, tank units operating in Eastern Europe began to standardize their platoons to just two tank squads, for a total of 3 tanks and 9 personnel.

==Singapore==
In the Singapore Army, a platoon is a lieutenant&#x27;s billet. However, in practice, a second lieutenant is usually appointed and then eventually promoted. A typical infantry platoon consists of three seven-man sections of riflemen and a machine gun team, both commanded by third sergeants, a platoon sergeant, a signaler/runner and a platoon medic for a total of 28 soldiers. Beginning in 1992, the Singapore Armed Forces has allowed warrant officers to be appointed as platoon commanders.

==South Africa==
In the South African Army, a platoon usually consists of 27 soldiers and 1 officer organized into three sections 10 soldiers each plus an HQ which contains 8 men. A lieutenant as platoon commander and a sergeant as platoon sergeant, accompanied by a signaller and a patmor group of two men. 
A section comprises 10 soldiers led by a corporal who&#x27;s assisted by a lance corporal as second in command. The corporal is in charge of all the soldiers except the light machine gun (LMG) group which is led by the lance corporal. The LMG group is armed with the SS77 while rest of the platoon is armed with R4 assault rifles, with rifle grenades if available. There&#x27;s also the grenade launcher within each section.

==Sweden==
In the Swedish Army, a platoon is organized in the following way, according to &quot;Markstridsreglemente 4 Pluton&quot; (Ground combat regulation 4 Platoon):

* &quot;Chefsgrupp&quot; (Leadership squad)
** &quot;Plutonschef&quot;—Platoon leader.
** &quot;Ställföreträdande plutonschef&quot;—Deputy platoon leader.
** &quot;Plutonsbefäl&quot;—Platoon NCO.
** &quot;Signalist&quot;—Radio operator.
** &quot;Fordonsförare&quot;—Vehicle driver.
** &quot;Tolk&quot;—Interpreter (only present for deployments abroad).
* 3-4 &quot;Skyttegrupp&quot; (Rifle squad)
** &quot;Gruppchef --&quot; Squad Leader
** &quot;Ställföreträdande gruppchef --&quot; Deputy squad leader.
** &quot;2 soldater tillika kulspruteskyttar --&quot; 2 machine-gunners.
** &quot;2 soldater tillika pansarskotts-/granatgevärsskyttar/fordonsförare --&quot; 2 riflemen armed with AT4/Carl Gustav gunner and loader/vehicle driver.
** &quot;1 soldat tillika skarpskytt --&quot; 1 marksman.
** &quot;1 soldat tillika stridssjukvårdare --&quot; 1 combat medic.

==Thailand==
In the Royal Thai Army, a platoon is commanded by either a lieutenant or second lieutenant, assisted by a platoon sergeant, usually of the rank of sergeant major. In infantry units, rifle platoons are generally made up of five squads. These are three 11-man rifle squads, one 8-man command squad (consisting of platoon commander, sergeant, radio operator, 2 assistants and a 3-man weapons team) and one 9-man machine gun squad. Totaling at 50 soldiers

==United Kingdom==
Platoons have been used by England (and subsequently the United Kingdom) since the 16th century. On 1 October 1913, General Sir Ivor Maxse introduced a scheme to reorganize the army. The regular battalions of the British Army were reorganized from the previous eight companies to a four-company structure, with each company having four platoons as separate units, each commanded by a lieutenant or second lieutenant with a platoon sergeant as his deputy. Each platoon was divided into four sections, each commanded by a corporal. Because of a shortage of officers, the rank of warrant officer class III (platoon sergeant major) was introduced in 1938 for experienced non-commissioned officers who were given command of platoons. This was abolished in 1940, with most existing PSMs being commissioned.

In the modern British Army, an infantry platoon consists of three sections of eight men, plus a signaller (radio operator), a platoon sergeant (sergeant) and the platoon commander (second lieutenant or lieutenant). This may also include a mortar man operating a light mortar (full strength of 27 men and one officer); this may not be the case for all British infantry units, however, since the 51 mm mortars are not always part of a platoon&#x27;s &quot;Table of Organization and Equipment&quot;, post-Afghanistan. Under Army 2020, a platoon in the Heavy Protected Mobility Regiments consist of around 30 soldiers in four Mastiff PPV/FRES UV vehicles.

Each section is commanded by a corporal (lance sergeant in the Foot Guards), with a lance corporal as second-in-command and six riflemen, divided into two four-man fireteams. Support weapons platoons (such as mortar or anti-tank platoons) are generally larger and are commanded by a captain with a colour sergeant or warrant officer class 2 as second-in-command.

==United States==
A platoon in the United States Army is generally the smallest unit to be commanded by a commissioned officer, known as the platoon leader, currently a first or second lieutenant. The senior-most non-commissioned officer assists the platoon leader as platoon sergeant, currently a sergeant first class.

The exact size and composition of platoons in the US Army depends on the time period and their intended mission. Among the Combat arms a platoon consists of several squads or a similar number of armored fighting vehicles, while combat service support platoons are organized based on their function. Several platoons are combined into a company, with each platoon receiving a letter designation for identification.

===Historical background===
From the 16th century until the late 17th century in what would become the United States, an infantry platoon was a &quot;half company&quot; commanded by a lieutenant, assisted by two sergeants and two corporals (increased in 1861 to four corporals). The sergeants, assisted by the corporals, led the two sections (half-platoons) and the squads (the terms were often used interchangeably until 1891) of the platoon.

In the American Civil War, drill manuals used to train both sides described how a company could be divided into two platoons, which could be further subdivided into two sections of two squads. However, few references are made regarding the use of platoons in combat. One exception was when a company was deployed as skirmishers: one platoon formed a skirmish line while the other took up position 150 paces behind as support.

When new drill manuals were published in 1891, they retained the organization of a company divided into two platoons commanded by lieutenants. There was now though greater emphasis on the use of platoons and squads advancing and providing fire support for each other. During the Spanish–American War an infantry company making a frontal assault would advance in rushes: one platoon running forward about fifty yards before going prone, whereupon the other platoon would rise up and rush past it, until close enough to assault the enemy&#x27;s positions.

====World War I====
By the end of World War I in 1918, the rifle platoon had expanded to its largest size in U.S. Army history into a unit of 59 soldiers. This platoon organization included one lieutenant, three sergeants, eight corporals, 15 privates first class, and 32 privates. The platoon was organized into a six-man platoon headquarters (including the platoon commander, a sergeant as &quot;assistant to platoon commander&quot;, and four privates as &quot;runners&quot; or messengers) and four sections. The sections were specialized by primary weapon, and each contained a different number of men. The &quot;Riflemen&quot; and &quot;Automatic Riflemen&quot; sections were each led by a sergeant and divided into two squads of eight and seven men each, respectively, including a corporal to lead each squad. The &quot;Hand Bombers&quot; (i.e., hand grenade throwers) and &quot;Rifle Grenadiers&quot; sections had a total of twelve and nine men each, respectively, including two corporals each, but no sergeant.

=====World War II=====
======Infantry======
The doctrinal role of American infantry during World War II was to seize and hold territory. This was primarily done as part of an overall doctrine of combined arms, but the infantry was capable of acting on their own to accomplish their mission. When facing against another combined force or organized defensive position, however, infantry acting independently was at a disadvantage.

The rifle platoon was the principal subunit of a rifle company with three per company; in turn each platoon was composed of three rifle squads. This mirrored the &quot;triangular&quot; format of larger units, allowing for two subunits to engage in combat while the third remained in reserve as support.
*When marching, a rifle platoon would be deployed as the vanguard or rearguard for its parent company, or deployed as an outpost when the march came to a halt. Individual squads would be sent out to scout ahead, patrol the surrounding area or stand guard as sentinels.
*On the defensive, a rifle platoon placed on the front line could occupy an area 250–500 yards in length and no more than 200 yards in depth, depending on the terrain. Individual squads were placed so as to cover a given sector of the defensive line and provide supporting fire for adjacent platoons. The support platoon was situated behind the front line platoons so as to provide supporting fire, protect the flanks and rear, and if necessary counterattack in case of enemy penetration.
*When attacking, the rifle platoon&#x27;s squads would conduct a frontal assault using fire and movement to close with and overrun the enemy&#x27;s position. While a large flanking maneuver was rarely possible, depending on the terrain and other factors using one or two squads to assault the enemy while the third maneuvered to attack their flank could also be carried out. Likewise the support platoon would provide supporting fire to the attacking platoons, moving up to replace one of them or help secure the objective if necessary, or repel an enemy counterattack.
Within the platoon&#x27;s headquarters, the platoon guide was responsible for preserving platoon cohesion and maintaining proper cover, concealment, and discipline among the soldiers; of the two messengers one remained with the platoon while the other was assigned to the company commander. Additionally, one of the platoon&#x27;s riflemen would be designated its sharpshooter and armed with a M1903A4 Springfield (replaced with a M1C rifle starting Jan 1945) Lastly, the rifle platoon had a combat medic assigned to it from the parent battalion&#x27;s medical detachment.
The weapons platoon provided the rifle company with heavy weapon support which was still mobile enough to maneuver along with the rest of the company. The platoon was normally under company command and its constituent parts rarely attached to rifle platoons as it placed additional burden on the platoon commanders. In instances where it was necessary to provide additional firepower to a rifle platoon, a mortar squad could be attached to a rifle platoon, particular for hitting targets that could not be hit by direct fire. Attaching a light machine gun squad to a rifle platoon was only done in exceptional circumstances.
The machine gun platoon was part of the heavy weapons company, which provided heavy weapons support for an infantry battalion. The platoon could be assigned to provide general fire support for the battalion as a whole, during which one of the messengers would be assigned to the battalion command post, or be attached to a rifle company to provide additional firepower, during which the messenger would be assigned to the rifle company&#x27;s commander. Within the platoon headquarters, the instrument corporal assisted the platoon leader with reconnoitering where to set up the platoon and the platoon&#x27;s observation post and computing fire data. The transportation corporal oversaw the movement of weapons prior to combat, their use of concealment and camouflage, and ammunition resupply during combat. The platoon also had a combat medic assigned to it from the parent battalion&#x27;s medical detachment.
The mortar platoon was part of the heavy weapons company, which provided heavy weapons support for an infantry battalion. Unlike with the machine gun platoons, the mortar platoon was never attached to rifle companies and so always remained under battalion control, with one of the messengers assigned to the battalion command post. The instrument and transportation corporals functioned the same within the mortar platoon as they did within the machine gun platoons. The platoon also had a combat medic assigned to it from the parent battalion&#x27;s medical detachment.

======Engineers======
Combat engineers in the US Army during World War II played an important role in supporting other units via their special engineering knowledge and equipment, with a secondary role as a combat unit in their own right. This included engineer reconnaissance, building bridges, laying minefields, and breeching obstacles. Each infantry division was assigned an Engineer Combat Battalion, from which an engineer combat company would form part of a regimental combat team.
===Modern===
In the United States Army, rifle platoons are normally composed of 42 soldiers. They consist of three rifle squads, one weapons squad, and a six-man headquarters. The headquarters consists of a platoon leader (PL; usually a first lieutenant, 1LT), a platoon sergeant (PSG, usually a sergeant first class, SFC, E-7), a radio-telephone operator (RTO), a platoon forward observer (FO), the FO&#x27;s RTO, and the platoon medic. Each squad is led by a sergeant, who is usually a staff sergeant (SSG, E-6). The rifle squads each consist of two fire teams and a squad leader, while the weapons squad consists of two medium machine gun teams, two close combat missile teams, and a squad leader. A typical infantry company consists of 3 rifle platoons and a 4th platoon known as a weapons platoon. The weapons platoon typically provides heavy weapons support to the company and includes mortar, anti-armor and heavy machine guns organically.

====Marine Corps====
In the United States Marine Corps, infantry rifle platoons nominally (per TO&amp;E) consist of 43 Marines and are led by a platoon commander, usually a second lieutenant (O-1), assisted by a platoon sergeant, a staff sergeant (E-6). The platoon headquarters also includes a platoon guide, a sergeant (E-5), who serves as the assistant platoon sergeant, and a messenger (private or private first class). Rifle platoons consist of three rifle squads of 13 men each, led by a sergeant (E-5). In the attack (especially if part of the assault echelon) or in a deliberate defense, rifle platoons are usually augmented with a two-man mortar forward observer team and are often reinforced with a seven-man machinegun squad and/or a four-man assault weapons squad from the infantry company&#x27;s weapons platoon.

An infantry rifle company (3 per infantry battalion) has a weapons platoon. The infantry battalion consists of a headquarters and support company (H&amp;S), three rifle companies, and one weapons company. The weapons company platoon is usually led by a first lieutenant (O-2) and a gunnery sergeant (E-7) because of the generally larger number of Marines (up to 69 in the 81mm mortar platoon) in these platoons (the heavy machine gun platoon being the exception with only 28 members) and the more complex weapon systems employed. A rifle company weapons platoon has a 60mm mortar section of 13 Marines with three M224 LWCMS 60mm mortar squads, an assault section of 13 Marines and six SMAW rocket launchers divided into three squads of two teams each, and a medium machine gun section of 22 Marines and six M240G general-purpose machine guns divided into three squads of two teams each. The infantry battalion weapons company consists of three heavy weapons platoons: 81mm mortar platoon (referred to as &quot;81s platoon or 81s&quot;), heavy machine gun platoon (.50cal HMG and 40mm AGL), and anti armor platoon (Javelin missile and antitank TOW missile launchers). Each of these three platoons is divided into sections. Three sections of two squads each in the heavy machine gun platoon, two sections of four squads each in the 81mm mortar platoon, one section of two squads with four teams each in the Javelin missile section, and one section of four squads with two teams each in the antitank TOW missile section. Marine rifle or weapons platoons would also have from one to four Navy hospital corpsmen assigned along with the Marines.

Platoons are also used in reconnaissance, light armored reconnaissance (scout dismounts), combat engineer, law enforcement (i.e., military police), Marine Security Force Regiment (MSFR), and Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team (FAST) companies. In armored vehicle units, platoons consist of sections containing two or three vehicles and their crews:
* tank and light armored reconnaissance platoons consist of two sections, each containing two tanks/light armored vehicles and crews
* assault amphibian vehicle (AAV) platoons consist of four sections, each containing three AAVs and crews (Per T/O 4652M.)
* combat engineer assault breacher sections consist of two CEV assault breacher vehicles and crews

In low altitude air defense (LAAD) batteries, the firing platoons consist of three sections, each consisting of a section leader and five two-man Stinger missile teams. In artillery batteries, the firing platoon consists of six artillery sections, each containing one gun with its crew and prime mover (i.e., a truck to tow the artillery piece and transport the gun crew and baggage).

====Air Force====
The United States Air Force has a similarly sized and configured unit called a flight. A flight usually ranges from a dozen people to over a hundred, or typically four aircraft. The typical flight commander is a captain. The typical flight chief is a master sergeant. Letter designations can be used, such as Alpha Flight, Bravo Flight, etc.

<text>In military terminology, a squad is among the smallest of military organizations and is led by a non-commissioned officer. NATO and U.S. doctrine define a squad as an organization &quot;larger than a team, but smaller than a section.&quot; while U.S. Army doctrine further defines a squad as a &quot;small military unit typically containing two or more fire teams.&quot; In American usage, a squad consists of eight to fourteen soldiers, and may be further subdivided into fireteams.

==Organization==
===NATO===
The standard NATO symbol for a &quot;squad&quot; consists of one single dot (●) placed above a framed unit icon.

===United States===

====United States Army====
Historically, a &quot;squad&quot; in the US Army was a sub-unit of a section, consisting of from as few as two soldiers to as many as 9–10 soldiers and was originally used primarily for drill and administrative purposes (e.g., billeting, messing, working parties, etc.). The smallest tactical sub-unit being the section, which was also known as a half-platoon (the platoon itself being a half company).

Depending upon the time period, the squad &quot;leader&quot; (not an official position title until 1891) could be a sergeant (the sergeant, in sections with only one corporal, led the section&#x27;s first squad, while the lone corporal served as assistant section leader and led the section&#x27;s second squad), a corporal (in sections with two corporals), a lance corporal (a rank the Army had in varying numbers and conditions from at least 1821 until 1920), a private first class (PFC) (the rank existing since 1846 but not earning its one chevron – taken from the abolished lance corporal rank – until 1920). or even a &quot;senior&quot; private (there being many long-service, or &quot;professional,&quot; privates until the post-WWII era).

In 1891, the US Army officially defined a rifle &quot;squad&quot; as consisting of &quot;seven privates and one corporal.&quot; The US Army employed the eight-man rifle squad through WWI and until the late 1930s under the Square Division organizational plan, in which sergeants continued to lead sections consisting of two squads.

Under the Triangular Division organization plan in 1939 rifle squads were no longer organized into sections. Instead, the squads were reorganized into a 12-man unit of three elements, or teams, Able, Baker, and Charlie, reporting directly to the platoon commander (an officer, usually a second lieutenant), assisted by a sergeant assigned as the &quot;assistant to platoon commander&quot; (re-designated as &quot;platoon leader&quot; in 1940 and as &quot;platoon sergeant&quot; in 1943 with the officer then re-designated as &quot;platoon leader&quot;.) The squad leader was still only a corporal but the squad was also assigned a PFC (one of the scout riflemen) as the assistant to the squad leader. This soldier could serve as either the squad leader&#x27;s messenger to the platoon commander or could be used to relay orders to other squad elements, as needed. While not a noncommissioned officer (NCO) the PFC was an experienced soldier, as prior to WWII the majority of enlisted men remained privates for the entire term of their enlistment since promotion opportunity was scarce. However, the obvious command (viz., leadership and supervision) weakness of so large a squad under one NCO rapidly became obvious in light of the pre-war mobilization and was corrected in 1940 when a second NCO was added to the squad.

This adjustment raised the squad leader to a sergeant (grade 4) and the assistant squad leader to a corporal (grade 5). The &quot;platoon leader&quot; (with the officer still being the &quot;platoon commander&quot;) now became a staff sergeant, (grade 3). (In 1920 the enlisted rank structure was simplified and seven grades were established ranging from master sergeant as grade 1 to private as grade 7; staff sergeant being one of the new rank titles then established by combining several intermediate sergeant grades ranking above section leaders but below the company first sergeant.) This squad organization included two men serving as “scout (rifleman),” who along with the squad leader, formed the security element (i.e., reconnaissance and overwatch actions), designated as “Able.” The second element was a three-man Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) team consisting of an automatic rifleman, an assistant automatic rifleman and an ammunition bearer. This element formed the “base of fire” (viz., fire support in providing suppressive fires in the attack and protective fires in the defense) and was designated as “Baker.” Lastly, there were five riflemen and the assistant squad leader, who formed the “maneuver element” (e.g., flanking and assault movements in the attack and repelling and reinforcing actions in the defense), designated as “Charlie.”

In 1942, the Army had a massive restructuring of its Tables of Organization &amp; Equipment (TO&amp;Es) and increased the rank of the squad leader and assistant squad leader to staff sergeant and sergeant, respectively. (Platoon leaders now became technical sergeants, as grade 2, and first sergeants became equal in pay grade to master sergeants as grade 1.) The BAR man (automatic rifleman) and the senior rifleman of the Charlie element became corporals (grade 5) and de facto team leaders, even though not officially designated as such. (In 1943 NCO platoon leaders were re-designated as platoon sergeants and officer platoon commanders became platoon leaders.)

After WWII, in 1948, the Army decided to &quot;downsize” the rifle squad to a nine-man organization (as well as realign its enlisted grade structure), as post-war analysis had shown that the 12-man squad was too large and unwieldy in combat. The squad leader was again called a sergeant (but retained the grade 3 pay grade and insignia of the rank of a staff sergeant, which was then eliminated.) The two scouts of the Able element were eliminated with the idea that all of the riflemen should be able to perform the scouting duties and would therefore all share in the associated inherent risk of that position. The Baker element&#x27;s ammunition bearer was also eliminated, leaving the two-man BAR team as the base of fire, supervised by the assistant squad leader (again called a corporal), but remaining as a grade 4, since the rank of sergeant (three chevrons) was then eliminated. (PFC became grade 5, private was grade 6, and recruit was grade 7; PFCs wore one chevron and privates and recruits both wore none.) The five riflemen of the “Charlie” team, now led by the squad leader, remained as the maneuver element.

Also, in 1948, the rank title of the platoon sergeant changed from technical sergeant (which was eliminated) to sergeant first class (SFC) (grade 2) and the rank title of first sergeant was again eliminated, being retained only as an occupational title for the senior NCO of a company. In 1951 the pay grades were reversed, with master sergeant becoming E-7 (vice the previous grade 1) and sergeant first class becoming E-6, so that the squad leader became a sergeant (E-5) and the assistant squad leader, a corporal (E-4). (With PFC, PVT, and RCT being E-3, E-2, and E-1, respectively.)
In the 1956 the Army began reorganizing into its &quot;Pentomic” plan under the ROCID (Reorganization of Current Infantry Divisions) TO&amp;Es. The rifle squad was reorganized into an eleven-man organization with a sergeant (E-5) as squad leader and two five-man fire teams. Each fire team consisted of a corporal (E-4) team leader, an automatic rifleman, an assistant automatic rifleman, a grenadier, and a scout-rifleman. The assistant squad leader position was eliminated, with the senior fire team leader now filling this role as needed.

In 1958, with the addition of the E-8 and E-9 pay grades, the ranks of the squad and fire team leaders changed again, now to staff sergeant (E-6) and sergeant (E-5), respectively. The 1958 restructuring restored the traditional sergeant and staff sergeant rank insignia of three chevrons and three chevrons over an inverted arc, respectively. (Platoon sergeant became a separate rank title, and along with SFC, became E-7; first sergeants and master sergeants became pay grade E-8. Also, the rank of sergeant major was revived as E-9, with a new distinctive rank insignia consisting of the three chevrons and three inverted arcs of a master sergeant/first sergeant but replacing the first sergeant&#x27;s lozenge with a star.)

Under the ROAD (Reorganization Objective Army Divisions) structure in 1963, the rifle squad was reduced to a ten-man organization. This iteration of the rifle squad retained the two fire teams but eliminated the two scouts (one in each fire team), instead providing the squad leader with one extra rifleman, who could be used to reinforce either fire team or assist the squad leader as required. An exception was in mechanized infantry units, where an additional rifleman (increasing the squad to eleven members) was assigned as the driver of the squad&#x27;s M113 armored personnel carrier. (Also, in 1968, the separate rank title of platoon sergeant was eliminated, leaving SFC as the only E-7 rank.)

Currently, US Army rifle squads consist of nine soldiers, organized under a squad leader into two four-man fire teams. The squad leader is a staff sergeant (E-6) and the two fire team leaders are sergeants (E-5). Mechanized infantry and Stryker infantry units are equipped with M2A3 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles and M1126 Stryker infantry carrier vehicles, respectively. Unlike the ROAD era mechanized infantry units, none of the vehicle crewman (M2A3 – three, M1126 – two) are counted as part of the nine-man rifle squad transported by the vehicles. The term squad is also used in infantry crew-served weapons sections (number of members varies by weapon), military police (twelve soldiers including a squad leader divided into four three-man teams, with three team leaders), and combat engineer units. Cavalry scout squads consist of six men divided into two teams (each with a team leader and two scouts) while infantry scout squads consist of eight men divided into two three-man teams (each with two scouts and one radio operator) plus a team leader and assistant team leader.

====United States Marine Corps====
In the United States Marine Corps, a rifle squad is usually composed of three fireteams of four Marines each and a squad leader who is typically a sergeant or corporal, Other types of USMC infantry squads include: machinegun (7.62 mm), heavy machinegun (12.7 mm (.50 cal.) and 40 mm), LWCMS mortar (60 mm), 81 mm mortar, assault weapon (SMAW), antiarmor (Javelin missile), and anti-tank (TOW missile). These squads range from as few as three Marines (60 mm LWCM squad) to as many as eight (Javelin missile squad), depending upon the weapon system with which the squad is equipped. Squads are also used in reconnaissance, light armored reconnaissance (scout dismounts), combat engineer, law enforcement (i.e., military police), Marine Security Force Regiment (MSFR), and Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team (FAST) companies. On 9 May 2018, it was announced that a USMC squad would be reduced to 12 Marines, with three fire teams of three Marines each with two new positions: an assistant squad leader and a squad systems operator. As of 2020, the structure has been changed to 15 men; assistant automatic riflemen are replaced with grenadiers and a new addition to Marine fireteams, anti mechanized infantry. All M16A4 rifles and M4A1 carbines are to be replaced with the M27 infantry automatic rifle. Depending on the mission, automatic rifleman may use the M249 light machine gun instead of the M27 IAR.

====United States Air Force====
In the U.S. Air Force Security Forces, a squad is made up of three fire teams of four members, each led by a senior airman, staff sergeant, or tech sergeant.

====Fire service in the United States====
A squad is a term used in the US Fire and EMS services to describe several types of units and emergency apparatus. Oftentimes, the names &quot;squad&quot; and &quot;rescue squad&quot; are used interchangeably, however the function of the squad is different from department to department. In some departments, a &quot;squad&quot; and a &quot;rescue&quot; are two distinct units. This is the case in New York City, where the FDNY operates eight squad companies. These special &quot;enhanced&quot; engine companies perform both &quot;truck&quot; and &quot;engine&quot; company tasks, as well as hazardous materials (Hazmat) mitigation and other specialty rescue functions. FDNY&#x27;s five &quot;rescue&quot; companies primarily mitigate technical and heavy rescue incidents, and operate as a pure special rescue unit. Squads and rescues within the FDNY are part of the departments specialty operations command (SOC).

In other departments, a squad is a name given to a type of apparatus that delivers EMS and rescue services, and is staffed by firefighter/EMTs or firefighter/paramedics. This type of service delivery is common in the greater Los Angeles area of California, and was made famous in the 1970s show &quot;Emergency!&quot;, where the fictional Squad 51 highlighted the lives of two firefighter/paramedics of the LACoFD.

===Soviet Union===
In the Soviet Armed Forces a motorised rifle squad was mounted in either a BTR armoured personnel carrier or BMP infantry fighting vehicle, with the former being more numerous by the late 1980s. BTR rifle squads consisted of a squad leader/BTR commander, senior rifleman/assistant squad leader, a machine gunner armed with an RPK-74, a grenadier armed with an RPG-7, a rifleman/assistant grenadier, a rifleman/medic, a rifleman, a BTR driver/mechanic and a BTR machine gunner.

BMP rifle squads consisted of a squad leader/BMP commander, assistant squad leader/BMP gunner, a BMP driver/mechanic, a machine gunner armed with an RPK-74, a grenadier armed with an RPG-7, a rifleman/assistant grenadier, a rifleman/medic, a senior rifleman and a rifleman all armed with AKMs or AK-74s. Within a platoon the rifleman in one of the squads was armed with an SVD sniper rifle. In both BTR and BMP squads the vehicle&#x27;s gunner and driver stayed with the vehicle while the rest of the squad dismounted.

===Chinese National Revolutionary Army===
The squad (班), or section was the basic unit of the National Revolutionary Army (of the National Government of the Republic of China), and would usually be 14 men strong. An infantry squad from an elite German-trained division would ideally have one light machine gun and 10 rifles, but only one of the three squads in a non-elite Central Army division would have a light machine gun. Furthermore, the regular provincial army divisions often had no machine guns at all.

=== Swedish Army ===
The squad, &quot;grupp&quot;, in the Swedish army is organized as follows during offensive missions, according to &quot;Markstridsreglemente 3 Grupp&quot; (Ground combat regulation 3 Squad):

* &quot;Gruppchef&quot; – squad leader.
* &quot;Ställföreträdande gruppchef –&quot; deputy squad leader.
* 2 &quot;soldater tillika kulspruteskyttar –&quot; two machine-gunners.
* 2 &quot;soldater tillika pansarskottsskyttar –&quot; two riflemen with anti-tank launcher. (Typically a &quot;Pansarskott m/86&quot;).
* 1 &quot;soldat tillika skarpskytt. –&quot; one marksman.
* 1 &quot;soldat tillika stridssjukvårdare –&quot; one combat medic.

During defensive missions, the two soldiers with anti-tank launchers are armed with a &quot;Granatgevär m/48&quot; or &quot;m/86&quot; instead, where one is gunner and the second loader.

==== Mechanized infantry (Strf 9040A) ====
In accordance with &quot;Brigadreglemente Armén Pansar-/Mekskyttepluton/-grupp 90&quot; (Army Brigade Regulation Armor-/Mechanized Rifle Platoon/Squad 90) from 2002:

* &quot;Vagnschef&quot; – vehicle commander
* &quot;Skytt&quot; – vehicle gunner
* &quot;Förare&quot; – vehicle driver
* &quot;Gruppchef&quot; – squad leader
* &quot;Ställföreträdande gruppchef&quot; – deputy squad leader
* 2 &quot;Kulspruteskyttar&quot; – two machine-gunners
* 1 &quot;Granatgevärsskytt&quot; – one recoilless rifle gunner
* 1 &quot;Granatgevärsladd&quot; – one recoilless rifle loader

The squad has access to six &quot;Pansarskott m/86s&quot;, two &quot;Kulspruta 58Bs&quot;, and one &quot;Granatgevär m/48&quot;.

=== Denmark ===
A Danish mechanized or armoured infantry squad (gruppe) consists of 4-5 privates, a sergeant, and sometimes a corporal - 6 members in total. The squad consists of two teams each containing three members.

When marching in single file, the squad members, from front to rear consist of:

* Team 2 (Hold 2)
** Let maskingeværskytte 2 (LMG2). Pointman. Armed with an M/60.
** Gevær 2 (GV2). Rifleman and primary AT gunner. Armed with an M/10 and an AT4. Can be outfitted with a grenade launcher.
** Gruppefører (GF). Squad leader, sergeant. Armed with an M/10.
* Team 1 (Hold 1)
** Gevær 1 (GV1). Rifleman and squad second-in-command, either a private or corporal. Also known as Bravo. Armed with an M/10 and a grenade launcher.
** Gevær 3 (GV3). Rifleman, combat life saver and secondary AT gunner. Armed with an M/10 and occasionally an AT4.
** Let maskingeværskytte 1 (LMG1). Last man. Armed with an M/60.

==Leadership==
A squad is led by a non-commissioned officer known as a &quot;squad leader&quot;. His or her second in command is known as an &quot;assistant squad leader&quot;. In Britain and in the Commonwealth, these appointments are known as &quot;section commander&quot; and &quot;section 2IC&quot; (second in command), respectively. In the US military, a squad leader is a non-commissioned officer who leads a squad of typically nine soldiers (US Army: squad leader and two fireteams of four men each) or 13 marines (US Marine Corps: squad leader and three fireteams of four men each) in a rifle squad, or three to eight men in a crew-served weapons squad. In the United States Army the TO&amp;E rank of a rifle squad leader is staff sergeant (E-6, or OR-6) and in the United States Marine Corps the TO rank is sergeant (E-5, or OR-5), though a corporal may also act as a squad leader in the absence of sufficient numbers of sergeants. Squad leaders of crew-served weapons squads range from corporal through staff sergeant, depending upon the branch of service and type of squad. In some armies, notably those of the British Commonwealth, in which the term &quot;section&quot; is used for units of this size, the NCO in charge, which in the British Army and Royal Marines is normally a corporal (OR-4), is termed a &quot;section commander&quot;.

==Other military uses==
A squad can also be an ad hoc group of soldiers assigned to a task, for example, a firing squad.

The Canadian Forces Manual of Drill and Ceremonial defines a squad as &quot;a small military formation of less than platoon size which is adopted to teach drill movements. (escouade)&quot;.

<text>A fireteam or fire team is a small modern military subordinated element of infantry designed to optimize &quot;NCO initiative&quot;, &quot;combined arms&quot;, &quot;bounding overwatch&quot; and &quot;fire and movement&quot; tactical doctrine in combat. Depending on mission requirements, a typical &quot;standard&quot; fireteam consists of four or fewer members: an automatic rifleman, a grenadier, a rifleman, and a designated fireteam leader. The role of each fireteam leader is to ensure that the fireteam operates as a cohesive unit. Two or three fireteams are organized into a section or squad in co-ordinated operations, which is led by a squad leader.

Historically, militaries with strong reliance and emphasis on decentralized NCO-corp institutions and effective &quot;bottom-up&quot; fireteam organization command structures have had significantly better combat performance from their infantry units in comparison to militaries limited to officer-reliant operations, traditionally larger units lacking NCO-leadership and &quot;top-down&quot; centralized-command structures. Fireteam organization addresses the realities of 21st-century warfare where combat is getting exponentially faster and more lethal as it identifies and removes anything which slows down the reaction time between first detection of an enemy and rounds impacted.

U.S. Army doctrine recognizes the fire team, or crew, as the smallest military organization while NATO doctrine refers to this level of organization simply as team. Fireteams are the most basic organization upon which modern infantry units are built in the British Army, Royal Air Force Regiment, Royal Marines, United States Army, United States Marine Corps, United States Air Force Security Forces, Canadian Forces, and Australian Army.
==Concept==
The concept of the fireteam is based on the need for tactical flexibility in infantry operations. A fireteam is capable of autonomous operations as part of a larger unit. Successful fireteam employment relies on quality small unit training for soldiers, experience of fireteam members operating together, sufficient communications infrastructure, and a quality non-commissioned officer corps to provide tactical leadership for the team.

These requirements have led to successful use of the fireteam concept by more professional militaries. It is less useful for armies employing massed infantry formations, or with significant conscription. Conscription makes fireteam development difficult, as team members are more effective as they build experience over time working together and building personal bonds.

In combat, while attacking or maneuvering, a fireteam generally spreads over a distance of , while in defensive positions the team can cover up to the range of its weapons or the limits of visibility, whichever is less. In open terrain, up to can be covered by an effective team, although detection range limits effectiveness beyond or so without special equipment. A team is effective so long as its primary weapon remains operational.

==National variations==

===Canada===
In the Canadian Army, &quot;fireteam&quot; refers to two soldiers paired for fire and movement. Two fireteams form an &quot;assault group&quot;, which is analogous to most other militaries&#x27; understanding of a fireteam; two assault groups and a vehicle group of one driver and one gunner form a section of ten soldiers.
*Team leader: An NCO (sergeant if assault group one master corporal if assault group two), carries a C7 rifle.
*Rifleman: One corporal or private, carries a C7 rifle.
*Grenadier: One corporal or private, carries a C7 rifle with an M203 grenade launcher.
*Gunner: One corporal or private, carries a C9 light machine gun.

===China===
People&#x27;s Liberation Army forces traditionally used three-man &quot;cells&quot; (equivalent to fireteams) as the smallest military formation and such organization was widely employed throughout the Second Sino-Japanese War, Chinese Civil War, Korean War, Sino-Indian War, Vietnam War as well as Sino-Vietnamese War. It is unofficially named the &quot;three-three organization&quot;. （）

In Chinese sources, this tactic is referred to as &quot;three-three fireteams&quot;, after the composition of the attack: three men would form one fireteam, and three fireteams one squad. A Chinese platoon, consisting of 50 men, would form three ranks of such fireteams, which would be employed to attack &quot;one point&quot; from &quot;two sides.&quot; Each cell carries at least one automatic weapon (In the Korean War, it was submachine guns or light machine guns. In the early to mid-cold war, it was assault rifles or squad automatic weapons), while the rest carried a bolt-action rifle or a semiautomatic rifle so that each &quot;cell&quot; could independently fire and maneuver.

An example of a People&#x27;s Volunteer Army fireteam in the late Korean War,
*&quot;Squad leader/second in command/party member&quot;: Carried a Type 50 SMG, acted as the team leader
*&quot;Rifleman/machine gunner&quot;: Carried a Mosin–Nagant rifle or a DP-27 machinegun
*&quot;Rifleman/assistant machine gunner&quot;: Carried a Mosin–Nagant rifle

===French===
The French section (&quot;groupe de combat&quot; – &quot;combat group&quot;) is divided into two teams. The &quot;fire team&quot; (&quot;équipe de feu&quot;) is based around the section-level automatic rifle or light machine gun. The &quot;shock team&quot; (&quot;équipe de choc&quot;), made up of riflemen armed with rifle grenades or disposable rocket launchers, is the reconnaissance and maneuver unit. The teams employ bounding overwatch, with one element covering as the other moves. The team leaders have handheld radios so the elements can stay in contact with each other, as well as with the section leader&#x27;s backpack radio set. The most common symbol of the modern French junior NCO (&quot;chef d&#x27;équipe&quot;) has been a radio hanging around their neck.

===United Kingdom===

Infantry units of the British Army, Royal Marines and RAF Regiment introduced the fireteam concept following the adoption of the SA80 rifle and light support weapon. An infantry section of eight men contains two fireteams, Charlie and Delta, each comprising an NCO (corporal or lance corporal) and three privates.
*Team leader: This NCO carries an L85 rifle with an L123 underslung grenade launcher. Some units vary with one of the privates carrying the grenade launcher rather than the NCO.
*Rifleman: Two privates carry L85 rifles. Under earlier fireteam organization there also were two riflemen, but the second of these was later substituted with a designated marksman, leaving the section with one rifleman per fireteam. From 2019, the earlier organization was restored and the section commander was given discretion to re-role the section gunner as a third rifleman if needed.
*Gunner: One private per section carries an L7A2 GPMG. Earlier section organizations had one private per fireteam carrying an L86 light support weapon (intended to replace the L7A2) and then an L110 light machine gun; the L110A3 was removed from service in 2019, with the earlier L7A2 being reinstated as the section machine gun.
*Designated marksman: One private per section carries an L129A1 sharpshooter rifle. Earlier fireteam organizations had one private per fireteam carrying either an L86A2 light support weapon or an L129A1 depending on availability; the L86A2 was removed from service in 2019, with the L129A1 officially becoming the standard section DMR.
The fireteam is generally used as a subdivision of the section for fire and maneuver rather than as a separate unit in its own right, although fireteams or fireteam-sized units are often used for reconnaissance tasks, special operations, and urban patrols (usually being to referred to as a &quot;brick&quot; in the latter scenario).

===United States===
====Army====
The U.S. Army particularly emphasizes the fireteam concept.
Per U.S. Army doctrine a typical fire team consists of four soldiers.

*Team Leader (TL): Usually either a sergeant or corporal (although occasionally a team is led by a specialist or private first class when the platoon has a shortage of junior NCOs). Provides tactical leadership for the team at all times; standard equipped with backpack GPS/radio set, and either an M16 rifle or M4 carbine.
*Rifleman (R): Is &#x27;the baseline standard for all infantrymen&#x27;. They are equipped with the M16 rifle or M4 carbine. The rifleman is usually assigned with the grenadier to help balance the firepower capabilities of the automatic rifleman.
*Grenadier rifleman (GR): Provides limited high-angle fire over &quot;dead zones&quot;. A grenadier is equipped with an M4 or M16 with an M203 grenade launcher (or the newer M320 grenade launcher) mounted to the weapon.
*Automatic rifleman (AR): Provides overwatch and suppressive fire through force multiplication. The most casualty-producing person in a fireteam, in terms of firepower and maneuverability when compared to the standard nine-man rifle squad. An automatic rifleman is equipped with an M249 light machine gun. The automatic rifleman is usually assigned with the team leader to maximize directed fields of fire and to help balance the firepower capabilities of the grenadier.

In a stryker brigade combat team&#x27;s (SBCT) infantry rifle companies, one man in each rifle squad fireteam is either the squad anti-armour specialist (RMAT) armed with an FGM-148 Javelin, or the squad designated marksman (DM) who carries an M4 carbine and M14 rifle. In both cases, these two positions replace the basic rifleman of the standard rifle squad.

====Marine Corps====

The United States Marine Corps doctrine dictates that any active fireteam will include at least one 2-man gunnery-team and summarizes its fireteam organization with the mnemonic &quot;ready-team-fire-assist&quot;, the following being the arrangement of the fireteam when in a column:
* Rifleman: acts as a scout for the fireteam; &quot;ready&quot;.
* Team leader: uses an M203 and works as the designated grenadier; &quot;team&quot;.
* Designated automatic rifleman: uses an M249 light machine gun or M27 IAR and serves as second in command for the fireteam; &quot;fire&quot;.
* Assistant automatic rifleman: standard rifleman tasked with providing spotting support, range-finding, carries extra LMG ammunition, and offers close-protection should the fireteam fall under attack; &quot;assist&quot;.

====Navy====
Navy construction force, &quot;Seabee&quot; construction battalions, utilize fireteams (as well as companies, platoons, and squads), similar in size to those employed by the USMC, in their organizational structure. Seabee units may be attached to Marine Corps units.

===Other===
Many other armed forces see the squad as the smallest military unit; some countries&#x27; armies have a pair consisting of two soldiers as the smallest military unit. In others a fireteam is composed of two pairs of soldiers (fire and maneuver team) forming a fireteam. Vietnamese communist forces, who received extensive advisory support from Chinese communists, also adopted a fireteam concept similar to that of Chinese, known as &quot;tam tam chế&quot;, and such organization is still in use.

==History==
Fireteams have their origins in the early 20th century. From the Napoleonic Wars until World War I, military tactics involved central control of large numbers of soldiers in mass formation where small units were given little initiative.

Groups of four soldiers were mainly employed for guard duty, or as bodyguards for VIPs. In the Roman Army they were referred to as &quot;quaternio&quot; (Greek τετράδιον).

Skirmishers in the Napoleonic War would often work in teams of two, ranging ahead of the main group and providing covering fire for each other.

===World War I===
During World War I, trench warfare resulted in a stalemate on the Western Front. In order to combat this stalemate, the Germans developed a doctrinal innovation known as infiltration tactics (based on the Russian tactics used in the Brusilov Offensive), in which a brief intensive artillery preparation would be followed by small, autonomous teams of stormtroopers, who would covertly penetrate defensive lines. The Germans used their stormtroopers organized into squads at the lowest levels to provide a cohesive strike force in breaking through Allied lines. The British and Canadian troops on the Western Front started dividing platoons into sections after the Battle of the Somme in 1916. (This idea was later further developed in World War II). French Chasseur units in WWI were organized into fireteams, equipped with a light machine gun (Chauchat) team and grenades, to destroy German fire positions by fire (not assault) at up to 200 meters using rifle grenades. The light machine gun team would put suppressive fire on the enemy position, while the grenadier team moved to a position where the enemy embrasure could be attacked with grenades. The Chasseur tactics were proven during the Petain Offensive of 1917. Survivors of these French Chasseur units taught these tactics to American infantry, who used them with effectiveness at St. Mihiel and the Argonne. It was typical of a fireteam in this era to consist of four infantrymen: two assaulters with carbines, one grenadier, and one sapper.

===Interwar period===
In the inter-war years, United States Marine Corps Captain Evans F. Carlson and Merritt A. Edson are believed to have developed the fireteam concept during the United States occupation of Nicaragua (1912–1933). At that time the US Marine squad consisted of a Corporal and seven Marines all armed with a bolt-action M1903 Springfield rifle and an automatic rifleman armed with a Browning Automatic Rifle. The introduction of the Thompson submachine gun and Winchester Model 1912 shotgun was popular with the Marines as a point-defense weapon for countering ambush by Nicaraguan guerrillas within the thick vegetation that could provide cover for a quick overrun of a patrol. A team of four men armed with these weapons had proven more effective in terms of firepower and maneuverability than the standard nine-man rifle squad.

Carlson, who later went to China in 1937 and observed Communist 8th Route Army units of the National Revolutionary Army in action against the Imperial Japanese Army, brought these ideas back to the US when the country entered World War II. Under his command, the 2nd Marine Raider battalion were issued with the semi-automatic M1 Garand rifle and were organized in the standard 4-man fireteam (although it was called firegroup) concept, 3 firegroups to a squad with a squad leader. A firegroup was composed of an M1 Garand rifleman, a BAR gunner and a submachine gunner. After sustaining severe wounds, Carlson was replaced and his battalion later disbanded and reorganized under conventional Marine doctrine of ten-man squads. Later, Carlson&#x27;s fireteam concept was re-adopted.

===World War II===
WWII US Army rifle squads consisted of twelve soldiers divided into three teams: The A &quot;Able&quot; (contemporary spelling alphabet) team consisted of the squad leader and two scouts, the support B &quot;Baker&quot; team of the BAR gunner, assistant gunner, and ammunition bearer, and C &quot;Charlie&quot; team of the assistant squad leader, also serving as the anti-tank grenadier, and five riflemen, one of whom served as the alternate anti-tank grenadier). In an assault the A team would provide overwatch and security or assist the C team in the assault, as the squad leader directed, while the B team provided suppressive fire. Suppressive fire from the BAR would be supplemented by fire from the rifles of his team as he reloaded, and could be further supplemented by platoon medium machine guns.

The US Army Rangers and Special Service Force adopted an early fireteam concept when on campaign in Italy and France. Each squad sub-unit of four or five men was heavily armed, composed of a two-man BAR automatic rifleman and assistant, a scout (marksman/grenadier) armed with an M1903 Springfield with a rifle grenade discharger, and a team leader armed with an M1 carbine or M1 Thompson submachine gun. Their later misuse as conventional infantry negated their special training and fighting skill and their use as &quot;fire brigades&quot; against larger enemy forces negated their advantages in aggressiveness and firepower.

Meanwhile, the communist Chinese established the three-man fireteam concept as the three-man cell when they organized a regular army, and its organization seemed to have been disseminated throughout all of Asia&#x27;s communist forces, perhaps the most famous of which are the PAVN/NVA (People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam/North Vietnamese Army) and the Viet Cong.

==Battle pair==
A &quot;battle pair&quot; is the smallest unit above the individual soldier, in the modern era chiefly employed by Baltic militaries and special forces like the Special Air Service. It consists of two soldiers with one soldier acting as senior of the two fighters (decided amongst the two or by their superior). A fireteam in turn consists of at least two fire and maneuver teams, and a squad of two or more fireteams.

It may be known in the United States as a &quot;fire and maneuver team&quot;. This concept has not been widely utilized. The United States and most Commonwealth armies mainly rely on the concept of fire teams forming a squad.

===Estonia===
A battle pair (&quot;Lahingpaar&quot;) is the smallest unit in the Estonian Defence Forces and Estonian Defence League. Two to three battle pairs make up a &quot;pooljagu&quot; (half-squad), the Estonian equivalent of a fire team.

===Finland===
Until 2015 in the Finnish Defence Forces, three &quot;taistelupari&quot; (combat pairs) formed a squad along with a squad leader. A three-man fireteam is now the smallest standard unit in Finnish infantry doctrine.

===France===
The French Army has the concept of a &quot;binôme&quot; (&#x27;pair&#x27;). In the regular forces it is the pairing of an experienced soldier with a recruit or replacement. The new soldier learns from the experienced soldier how to properly perform the everyday tasks and responsibilities of his assignment.

In the old colonial forces (like the French Foreign Legion) it was a means of imposing order. The pair were responsible for each other – if one member broke the rules or deserted, the other would be punished for not preventing it.

===Sweden===
According to the Swedish Armed Forces field manual, a &quot;Stridspar&quot; working in unison is as effective as four soldiers of same quality acting individually.

<text>The original position (OP), often referred to as the veil of ignorance, is a thought experiment often associated with the works of American philosopher John Rawls. In the original position, one is asked to consider which principles they would select for the basic structure of society, but they must select as if they had no knowledge ahead of time what position they would end up having in that society. This choice is made from behind a &quot;veil of ignorance&quot;, which prevents them from knowing their ethnicity, social status, gender, and (crucially in Rawls&#x27;s formulation) their or anyone else&#x27;s ideas of how to lead a good life. Ideally, this would force participants to select principles impartially and rationally.

In Rawls&#x27;s theory the original position plays the same role that the &quot;state of nature&quot; does in the social contract tradition of Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. The original position figures prominently in Rawls&#x27;s 1971 book, &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;. It has influenced a variety of thinkers from a broad spectrum of philosophical orientations.

Rawls coined the phrases &quot;original position&quot; and &quot;veil of ignorance&quot;. However, the same thought experiment had already been described earlier in social choice by William Vickrey and John Harsanyi, who independently derived proofs showing a rational observer in the original position would adopt a utilitarian framework.

== History ==
The concept of the veil of ignorance has been in use by other names for centuries by philosophers such as John Stuart Mill and Immanuel Kant whose work discussed the concept of the social contract, Adam Smith with his &quot;impartial spectator&quot;, or the ideal observer theory. John Harsanyi was the first to mathematically formalize the concept, using it to an argument in favor of utilitarianism rather than an argument for a social contract (as rational agents consider expected outcomes, not worst-case outcomes). The usage of the term by John Rawls was developed in his 1971 book &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;.

Modern work tends to focus on the different decision theories that might describe the choice of the decision-maker &quot;behind the veil&quot;. In addition, Michael Moehler has shown that, from a moral point of view, decision theory is not necessarily central to veil of ignorance arguments, but the precise moral ideals that are assumed to model the veil. From a moral point of view, there is not one veil of ignorance but many different versions of it.

== Nature of the concept ==
Rawls specifies that the parties in the original position are concerned only with citizens&#x27; share of what he calls &quot;primary social goods&quot;, which include basic rights as well as economic and social advantages. Rawls also argues that the representatives in the original position would adopt the &quot;maximin rule&quot; as their principle for evaluating the choices before them. Borrowed from game theory, maximin stands for maximizing the minimum, i.e., making the choice that produces the highest payoff for the least advantaged position. Thus, maximin in the original position represents a formulation of &quot;social equality&quot;.

In social contract theory, citizens in a state of nature contract with each other to establish a state of civil society. For example, in the Lockean state of nature, the parties agree to establish a civil society in which the government has limited powers and the duty to protect the persons and property of citizens. In the original position, the representative parties select principles of justice that are to govern the basic structure of society. Rawls argues that the representative parties in the original position would select two principles of justice:

# Each citizen is guaranteed a fully adequate scheme of basic liberties, which is compatible with the same scheme of liberties for all others;
# Social and economic inequalities must satisfy two conditions:
#* to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged (the difference principle);
#* attached to positions and offices open to all.

The reason that the least well off member gets benefited is that it is argued that under the veil of ignorance people will act as if they were risk-averse. The original position is a unique and irrevocable choice about all the most important social goods, and they do not know the probability they will become any particular member of society. As insurance against the worst possible outcome, they will pick rules that maximize the benefits given to the minimum outcome (maximin).

Recently, Thomas Nagel has elaborated on the concept of original position, arguing that social ethics should be built taking into account the tension between original and actual positions.

Recently, the original position has been modeled mathematically along Wright-Fisher&#x27;s diffusion, classical in population genetics. The original position has also been used as an argument for negative eugenics, though Rawls&#x27;s argument was limited to its use as a preventative measure.

==Criticisms==
In &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot; (1974), Robert Nozick argues that, while the original position may be the just starting point, any inequalities derived from that distribution by means of free exchange are equally just, and that any re-distributive tax is an infringement on people&#x27;s liberty. He also argues that Rawls&#x27;s application of the maximin rule to the original position is risk aversion taken to its extreme, and is therefore unsuitable even to those behind the veil of ignorance.

In &quot;Liberalism and the Limits of Justice&quot; (1982), Michael Sandel has criticized Rawls&#x27;s notion of a veil of ignorance, pointing out that it is impossible, for an individual, to completely prescind from beliefs and convictions (from the Me ultimately), as is required by Rawls&#x27;s thought experiment.

In a 1987 empirical research study, Frohlich, Oppenheimer and Eavey showed that, in a simulated original position, undergraduates at American universities agreed upon a distributive principle that maximizes the average with a specified floor constraint (a minimum for the worst-off in any given distribution) over maximizing the floor or the average alone. The finding that a much less demanding distributive principle of justice is agreed upon in a (simulated) original position than Rawls&#x27;s specification of the &quot;difference principle&quot;, implies that the (rational) resistance to a cosmopolitan application of justice as fairness could be less forceful than its critics imagine.

In &quot;How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time&quot; (2008), Iain King argues that people in the original position should not be risk-averse, leading them to adopt the &quot;Help Principle&quot; (help someone if your help is worth more to them than it is to you) rather than maximin.

Philosopher and Law Professor Harold Anthony Lloyd argues that Rawls&#x27;s veil of ignorance is hardly hypothetical but instead dangerously real since individuals cannot know at any point in time the future either for themselves or for others (or in fact know all aspects of either their relevant past or present). Faced with the high stakes of such ignorance, careful egoism effectively becomes altruism by minimizing/sharing risk through social safety nets and other means such as insurance.

<text>The Beak of the Finch: A Story of Evolution in Our Time () is a 1994 nonfiction book about evolutionary biology, written by Jonathan Weiner. It won the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction. In 2014, a substantially unchanged 20th-anniversary edition e-book was issued with a preface by the author.

== Content ==
In a 1995 review of the book states &quot;In The Beak of the Finch, Jonathan Weiner vividly describes the excitement of modern evolutionary biology through the eyes and activities of two of its most important students, Peter and Rosemary Grant. &quot;

The finches of the title are the Galapagos or &#x27;Darwin&#x27;s Finches,&#x27; passerine songbirds in the Galapagos Islands. The species are so distinct that when Charles Darwin collected them in the islands he thought they were completely different birds, and it was only when he was back in London in 1837 that the ornithologist John Gould revealed that they were closely allied, reinforcing Darwin&#x27;s growing view that “species are not immutable.” The adaptations of their numerous species, in three genera, show diverging evolution to exploit several ecological niches in the rugged and dry Galápagos Islands.

Weiner follows the careers of two biologists, Peter and Rosemary Grant, and several of their graduate students, including Dolph Schluter, Trevor Price, James (Jamie) Smith, and Peter Boag. The Grants spent more than thirty years (twenty of which are covered in the book) studying the morphology (especially bill shape), reproduction, survival, and behaviour of entire populations of Galapagos finches. Their work revolutionized scientists understanding of the pace of evolution, proving that evolution can be observed in &#x27;real time&#x27;. Weiner describes years of painstaking field work on a desert island among the Galapagos, Daphne Major. Following years of intense drought or flooding, the Grants and their students were able to demonstrate all the necessary requirements for natural selection: traits have fitness consequences, respond to selection, and are heritable. Kim Sterelny (2007) cites this rapid natural selection as illustrating an important point about periods of relative stasis in the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis of Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould: &quot;In claiming that species typically undergo no further evolutionary change once speciation is complete, they are not claiming that there is no change at all between one generation and the next. Lineages do change. But the change between generations does not &quot;accumulate&quot;. Instead, over time, the species wobbles about its phenotypic mean. Jonathan Weiner&#x27;s &quot;The Beak of the Finch&quot; describes this very process&quot;.

While the book focuses on the Grant&#x27;s and Darwin&#x27;s finches, it also covers work on fruit flies by Dobzhansky (Chaper 12) and Trinidadian guppies led by John Endler (Chapter 6). 

In the conclusion the author relates the speed of evolution to the growing resistance of insects to insecticides and of bacteria to penicillin and related anti-bacterial drugs.

== Reception ==
The book is well received by biologists, and has been praised for its description of the ups and downs of fieldwork, the excitement of unexpected results, and the growing emphasis on critical statistical analysis to uncover patterns. It received some criticism for over-emphasizing the research by the Grants, e.g. Weiner&#x27;s claim that they discovered species pairs of sticklebacks in freshwater lakes that were already well-known. But reviews agree that the book is compelling, well written, and an excellent primer on how evolution works.

<text>Feng-hsiung Hsu (; born January 1, 1959) (nicknamed Crazy Bird) is a Taiwanese-American computer scientist and the author of the book &quot;Behind Deep Blue: Building the Computer that Defeated the World Chess Champion&quot;. His work led to the creation of the Deep Thought chess computer, which led to the first chess playing computer to defeat grandmasters in tournament play and the first to achieve a certified grandmaster-level rating.

Hsu was the architect and the principal designer of the IBM Deep Blue chess computer. He was awarded the 1991 ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award for his contributions in architecture and algorithms for chess machines.

==Career==
Hsu was born in Keelung, Taiwan, and came to the United States after graduating from National Taiwan University with a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in electrical engineering. He started his graduate work at Carnegie Mellon University in the field of computer chess in the year 1985. In 1988 he was part of the &quot;Deep Thought&quot; team that won the Fredkin Intermediate Prize for Deep Thought&#x27;s grandmaster-level performance. In 1989 he joined IBM to design a chess-playing computer and received a Ph.D. in computer science with honors from Carnegie Mellon University. He was the recipient of the 1990 Mephisto Best-Publication Award for his doctoral dissertation. 

In 1991, the Association for Computing Machinery awarded Hsu a Grace Murray Hopper Award for his work on Deep Blue. In 1996, the supercomputer lost to world chess champion Garry Kasparov. After the loss, Hsu&#x27;s team prepared for a re-match. During the re-match with Kasparov, the supercomputer had doubled the processing power it had during the previous match. On May 11, 1997, Kasparov lost the sixth and final game, and, with it, the match (2½–3½).

Prior to building the supercomputer Deep Blue that defeated Kasparov, Hsu worked on many other chess computers. He started with ChipTest, a simple chess-playing chip, based on a design from Unix-inventor Ken Thompson&#x27;s Belle, and very different from the other chess-playing computer being developed at Carnegie Mellon, HiTech, which was developed by Hans Berliner and included 64 different chess chips for the move generator instead of the one in Hsu&#x27;s series. Hsu went on to build the successively better chess-playing computers Deep Thought, Deep Thought II, and Deep Blue Prototype.

In 2003, Hsu joined Microsoft Research Asia, in Beijing. In 2007, he stated the view that brute-force computation has eclipsed humans in chess, and it could soon do the same in the ancient Asian game of Go. This came to pass nine years later in 2016.

The chess computer HiTech was donated to the Computer History Museum by Hsu.

<text>The World Chess Championship is played to determine the world champion in chess. The current world champion is Gukesh Dommaraju, who defeated the previous champion Ding Liren in the 2024 World Chess Championship.

The first event recognized as a world championship was the 1886 match between Wilhelm Steinitz and Johannes Zukertort. Steinitz won, making him the first world champion. From 1886 to 1946, the champion set the terms, requiring any challenger to raise a sizable stake and defeat the champion in a match in order to become the new world champion. Following the death of reigning world champion Alexander Alekhine in 1946, the International Chess Federation (FIDE) took over administration of the World Championship, beginning with the 1948 tournament. From 1948 to 1993, FIDE organized a set of tournaments and matches to choose a new challenger for the world championship match, which was held every three years. 

Before the 1993 match, then reigning champion Garry Kasparov and his championship rival Nigel Short broke away from FIDE, and conducted the match under the umbrella of the newly formed Professional Chess Association. FIDE conducted its own tournament, which was won by Anatoly Karpov, and led to a rival claimant to the title of World Champion for the next thirteen years until 2006. The titles were unified at the World Chess Championship 2006, and all the subsequent tournaments and matches have once again been administered by FIDE. Since 2014, the championship has settled on a two-year cycle, with championship matches conducted every even year. The 2020 and 2022 matches were postponed to 2021 and 2023 respectively because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The next match returned to the normal schedule and was held in 2024.

Emanuel Lasker was the longest serving World Champion, having held the title for 27 years, and holds the record for the most Championship wins with six along with Kasparov and Karpov. Though the world championship is open to all players, there are separate championships for women, under-20s and lower age groups, and seniors. There are also chess world championships in rapid, blitz, correspondence, problem solving, Fischer random chess, and computer chess.

==History==
===Early champions (pre-1886)===
====Before 1851====
The game of chess in its modern form emerged in Spain in the 15th century, though rule variations persisted until the late 19th century. Before Wilhelm Steinitz and Johannes Zukertort in the late 19th century, no chess player seriously claimed to be champion of the world. The phrase was used by some chess writers to describe other players of their day, and the status of being the best at the time has sometimes been awarded in retrospect, going back to the early 17th-century Italian player Gioachino Greco (the first player where complete games survive). Richard Lambe, in his 1764 book &quot;The History of Chess&quot;, wrote that the 18th-century French player François-André Danican Philidor was &quot;supposed to be the best Chess-player in the world&quot;. Philidor wrote an extremely successful chess book (&quot;Analyse du jeu des Échecs&quot;) and gave public demonstrations of his blindfold chess skills. However, some of Philidor&#x27;s contemporaries were not convinced by the analysis Philidor gave in his book (e.g. the Modenese Masters), and some more recent authors have echoed these doubts.
In the early 19th century, it was generally considered that the French player Alexandre Deschapelles was the strongest player of the time, though three games between him and the English player William Lewis in 1821 suggests that they were on par. After Deschapelles and Lewis withdrew from play, the strongest players from France and England respectively were recognised as Louis de la Bourdonnais and Alexander McDonnell. La Bourdonnais visited England in 1825, where he played many games against Lewis and won most of them, and defeated all the other English masters despite offering handicaps. He and McDonnell contested a long series of matches in 1834. These were the first to be adequately reported, and they somewhat resemble the later world championship matches. Approximately 85 games (the true number is up for historical debate) were played, with La Bourdonnais winning a majority of the games.

In 1839, George Walker wrote &quot;The sceptre of chess, in Europe, has been for the last century, at least, wielded by a Gallic dynasty. It has passed from Legalle [Philidor&#x27;s teacher, whom Philidor regarded as being a player equal to himself, according to Deschapelles] to La Bourdonnais, through the grasp, successively, of Philidor, Bernard, Carlier [two members of &quot;La Société des Amateurs&quot;], and Deschapelles&quot;. In 1840, a columnist in &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (who was probably Walker) wrote, &quot;Will Gaul continue the dynasty by placing a fourth Frenchman on the throne of the world? the three last chess chiefs having been successively Philidor, Deschapelles, and De La Bourdonnais.&quot;

After La Bourdonnais&#x27; death in December 1840, Englishman Howard Staunton&#x27;s match victory over another Frenchman, Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant, in 1843 is considered to have established Staunton as the world&#x27;s strongest player, at least in England and France. By the 1830s, players from Germany and more generally Central Europe were beginning to appear on the scene: the strongest of the Berlin players around 1840 was probably Ludwig Bledow, co-founder of the Berlin Pleiades. The earliest recorded use of the term &quot;World Champion&quot; was in 1845, when Staunton was described as &quot;the Chess Champion of England, or ... the Champion of the World&quot;.

==== From 1851 to 1886 ====
An important milestone was the London 1851 chess tournament, which was the first international chess tournament, organized by Staunton. It was played as a series of matches, and was won convincingly by the German Adolf Anderssen, including a 4–1 semi-final win over Staunton. This established Anderssen as the world&#x27;s leading player. In 1893, Henry Bird retrospectively awarded the title of first world chess champion to Anderssen for his victory, but there is no evidence that he was widely acclaimed as such at the time, and no mention of such a status afterwards in the tournament book by Staunton. Indeed, Staunton&#x27;s tournament book calls Anderssen &quot;after Heydebrand der Laza [Tassilo von der Lasa, another of the Berlin Pleiades], the best player of Germany&quot;: von der Lasa was unable to attend the 1851 tournament, though he was invited. In 1851, Anderssen lost a match to von der Lasa; in 1856, George Walker wrote that &quot;[von der Lasa] and Anderssen are decidedly the two best in the known world&quot;. Von der Lasa did not compete in tournaments or formal matches because of the demands of his diplomatic career, but his games show that he was one of the world&#x27;s best then: he won series of games against Staunton in 1844 and 1853.

Anderssen was himself decisively beaten in an 1858 match against the American Paul Morphy (7–2, 2 draws). In 1858–59 Morphy played matches against several leading players, beating them all. This prompted some commentators at the time to call him the world champion: Gabriel-Éloy Doazan, who knew Morphy, wrote that &quot;one can and...must place [him] in the same bracket&quot; as Deschapelles and La Bourdonnais, who he had played years before, and that &quot;his superiority is as obvious as theirs&quot;. But when Morphy returned to America in 1859, he abruptly retired from chess, though many considered him the world champion until his death in 1884. His sudden withdrawal from chess at his peak led to his being known as &quot;the pride and sorrow of chess&quot;.

After Morphy&#x27;s retirement from chess, Anderssen was again regarded as the world&#x27;s strongest active player, a reputation he reinforced by winning the strong London 1862 chess tournament. Louis Paulsen and Ignatz Kolisch were also playing at a comparable standard to Anderssen in the 1860s: Anderssen narrowly won a match against Kolisch in 1861, and drew against Paulsen in 1862.

In 1866, Wilhelm Steinitz narrowly defeated Anderssen in a match (8–6, 0 draws). However, he was not immediately able to conclusively demonstrate his superiority. Steinitz placed third at the Paris 1867 chess tournament, behind Kolisch and Szymon Winawer; he placed second at the Dundee 1867 tournament, behind Gustav Neumann; and he again placed second at the Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament, which was the strongest that had been held to date (Anderssen came first, and won twice against Steinitz). Steinitz confirmed his standing as the world&#x27;s leading player by winning the London 1872 tournament, winning a match against Johannes Zukertort in 1872 (7–1, 4 draws), winning the Vienna 1873 chess tournament, and decisively winning a match over Joseph Henry Blackburne 7–0 (0 draws) in 1876.

Apart from the Blackburne match, Steinitz played no competitive chess between the Vienna tournaments of 1873 and 1882. During that time, Zukertort emerged as the world&#x27;s leading active player, winning the Paris 1878 chess tournament. Zukertort then won the London 1883 chess tournament by a convincing 3-point margin, ahead of nearly every leading player in the world, with Steinitz finishing second. This tournament established Steinitz and Zukertort as the best two players in the world, and led to a match between these two, the World Chess Championship 1886, won by Steinitz.

There is some debate over whether to date Steinitz&#x27;s reign as world champion from his win over Anderssen in 1866, or from his win over Zukertort in 1886. The 1886 match was clearly agreed to be for the world championship, but there is no indication that Steinitz was regarded as the defending champion. There is also no known evidence of Steinitz being called the world champion after defeating Anderssen in 1866. It has been suggested that Steinitz could not make such a claim while Morphy was alive (Morphy died in 1884). There are a number of references to Steinitz as world champion in the 1870s, the earliest being after the first Zukertort match in 1872. Later, in 1879, it was argued that Zukertort was world champion, since Morphy and Steinitz were not active. However, later in his career, at least from 1887, Steinitz dated his reign from this 1866 match, and early sources such as the New York Times in 1894, Emanuel Lasker in 1908, and Reuben Fine in 1952 all do the same.

Many modern commentators divide Steinitz&#x27;s reign into an &quot;unofficial&quot; one from 1866 to 1886, and an &quot;official&quot; one after 1886. By this reckoning, the first World Championship match was in 1886, and Steinitz was the first official World Chess Champion.

===Champions before FIDE (1886–1946)===
====Reign of Wilhelm Steinitz (1886–1894)====

Following the Steinitz–Zukertort match, a tradition continued of the world championship being decided by a match between the reigning champion, and a challenger: if a player thought he was strong enough, he (or his friends) would find financial backing for a match purse and challenge the reigning world champion. If he won, he would become the new champion.

Steinitz successfully defended his world title against Mikhail Chigorin in 1889, Isidor Gunsberg in 1891, and Chigorin again in 1892.

In 1887, the American Chess Congress started work on drawing up regulations for the future conduct of world championship contests. Steinitz supported this endeavor, as he thought he was becoming too old to remain world champion. The proposal evolved through many forms (as Steinitz pointed out, such a project had never been undertaken before), and resulted in the 1889 tournament in New York to select a challenger for Steinitz, rather like the more recent Candidates Tournaments. The tournament was duly played, but the outcome was not quite as planned: Chigorin and Max Weiss tied for first place; their play-off resulted in four draws; and neither wanted to play a match against Steinitz – Chigorin had just lost to him, and Weiss wanted to get back to his work for the Rothschild Bank. The third prizewinner, Isidor Gunsberg, was prepared to play Steinitz for the title in New York, so this match was played in 1890–1891 and was won by Steinitz. The experiment was not repeated, and Steinitz&#x27;s later matches were private arrangements between the players.

Two young strong players emerged in late 1880s and early 1890s: Siegbert Tarrasch and Emanuel Lasker. Tarrasch had the better tournament results at the time, but it was Lasker who was able to raise the money to challenge Steinitz. Lasker won the 1894 match and succeeded Steinitz as world champion.

====Emanuel Lasker (1894–1921)====

Lasker held the title from 1894 to 1921, the longest reign (27 years) of any champion. He won a return match against Steinitz in 1897, and then did not defend his title for ten years, before playing four title defences in four years. He comfortably defeated Frank Marshall in 1907 and Siegbert Tarrasch in 1908. In 1910, he almost lost his title in a short tied match against Carl Schlechter, although the exact conditions of this match are a mystery. He then defeated Dawid Janowski in the most one-sided title match in history later in 1910.

Lasker&#x27;s negotiations for title matches from 1911 onwards were extremely controversial. In 1911, he received a challenge for a world title match against José Raúl Capablanca and, in addition to making severe financial demands, proposed some novel conditions: the match should be considered drawn if neither player finished with a two-game lead; and it should have a maximum of 30 games, but finish if either player won six games and had a two-game lead (previous matches had been won by the first to win a certain number of games, usually 10; in theory, such a match might go on for ever). Capablanca objected to the two-game lead clause; Lasker took offence at the terms in which Capablanca criticized the two-game lead condition and broke off negotiations.

Further controversy arose when, in 1912, Lasker&#x27;s terms for a proposed match with Akiba Rubinstein included a clause that, if Lasker should resign the title after a date had been set for the match, Rubinstein should become world champion. When he resumed negotiations with Capablanca after World War I, Lasker insisted on a similar clause that if Lasker should resign the title after a date had been set for the match, Capablanca should become world champion. On 27 June 1920 Lasker abdicated in favor of Capablanca because of public criticism of the terms of the match, naming Capablanca as his successor. Some commentators questioned Lasker&#x27;s right to name his successor; Amos Burn raised the same objection but welcomed Lasker&#x27;s resignation of the title. Capablanca argued that, if the champion abdicated, the title must go to the challenger, as any other arrangement would be unfair to the challenger. Lasker later agreed to play a match against Capablanca in 1921, announcing that, if he won, he would resign the title so that younger masters could compete for it. Capablanca won their 1921 match by four wins, ten draws and no losses.

====Capablanca, Alekhine and Euwe (1921–1946)====

After the breakdown of his first attempt to negotiate a title match against Lasker (1911), Capablanca drafted rules for the conduct of future challenges, which were agreed to by the other top players at the 1914 Saint Petersburg tournament, including Lasker, and approved at the Mannheim Congress later that year. The main points were: the champion must be prepared to defend his title once a year; the match should be won by the first player to win six or eight games (the champion had the right to choose); and the stake should be at least £1,000 (about £ in current terms).

Following the controversies surrounding his 1921 match against Lasker, in 1922 world champion Capablanca proposed the &quot;London Rules&quot;: the first player to win six games would win the match; playing sessions would be limited to 5 hours; the time limit would be 40 moves in 2½ hours; the champion must defend his title within one year of receiving a challenge from a recognized master; the champion would decide the date of the match; the champion was not obliged to accept a challenge for a purse of less than US$10,000 (about $ in current terms); 20% of the purse was to be paid to the title holder, and the remainder being divided, 60% going to the winner of the match, and 40% to the loser; the highest purse bid must be accepted. Alekhine, Bogoljubow, Maróczy, Réti, Rubinstein, Tartakower and Vidmar promptly signed them. The only match played under those rules was Capablanca vs Alekhine in 1927, although there has been speculation that the actual contract might have included a &quot;two-game lead&quot; clause. 

Alekhine, Rubinstein and Nimzowitsch had all challenged Capablanca in the early 1920s but only Alekhine could raise the US$10,000 Capablanca demanded and only in 1927. Capablanca was shockingly upset by the new challenger. Before the match, almost nobody gave Alekhine a chance against the dominant Cuban, but Alekhine overcame Capablanca&#x27;s natural skill with his unmatched drive and extensive preparation (especially deep opening analysis, which became a hallmark of most future grandmasters). The aggressive Alekhine was helped by his tactical skill, which complicated the game. Immediately after winning, Alekhine announced that he was willing to grant Capablanca a return match provided Capablanca met the requirements of the &quot;London Rules&quot;. Negotiations dragged on for several years, often breaking down when agreement seemed in sight. Alekhine easily won two title matches against Efim Bogoljubov in 1929 and 1934. In 1935, Alekhine was unexpectedly defeated by the Dutch Max Euwe, an amateur player who worked as a mathematics teacher. Alekhine convincingly won a rematch in 1937. World War II temporarily prevented any further world title matches, and Alekhine remained world champion until his death in 1946.

====Financing====
Before 1948 world championship matches were financed by arrangements similar to those Emanuel Lasker described for his 1894 match with Wilhelm Steinitz: either the challenger or both players, with the assistance of financial backers, would contribute to a purse; about half would be distributed to the winner&#x27;s backers, and the winner would receive the larger share of the remainder (the loser&#x27;s backers got nothing). The players had to meet their own travel, accommodation, food and other expenses out of their shares of the purse. This system evolved out of the wagering of small stakes on club games in the early 19th century.

Up to and including the 1894 Steinitz–Lasker match, both players, with their backers, generally contributed equally to the purse, following the custom of important matches in the 19th century before there was a generally recognized world champion. For example: the stakes were £100 a side in both the second Staunton vs Saint-Amant match (Paris, 1843) and the Anderssen vs Steinitz match (London, 1866); Steinitz and Zukertort played their 1886 match for £400 a side. Lasker introduced the practice of demanding that the challenger should provide the whole of the purse, and his successors followed his example up to World War II. This requirement made arranging world championship matches more difficult, for example: Marshall challenged Lasker in 1904 but could not raise the money until 1907; in 1911 Lasker and Rubinstein agreed in principle to a world championship match, but this was never played as Rubinstein could not raise the money. In the early 1920s, Alekhine, Rubinstein and Nimzowitsch all challenged Capablanca, but only Alekhine was able to raise the US$10,000 that Capablanca demanded, and not until 1927.

===FIDE title (1948–1993)===
====FIDE, Euwe and AVRO====
Attempts to form an international chess federation were made at the time of the 1914 St. Petersburg, 1914 Mannheim and 1920 Gothenburg Tournaments. On 20 July 1924 the participants at the Paris tournament founded FIDE as a kind of players&#x27; union. FIDE&#x27;s congresses in 1925 and 1926 expressed a desire to become involved in managing the world championship. FIDE was largely happy with the &quot;London Rules&quot;, but claimed that the requirement for a purse of $10,000 was impracticable and called upon Capablanca to come to an agreement with the leading masters to revise the Rules. In 1926 FIDE decided in principle to create a title of &quot;Champion of FIDE&quot; and, in 1928, adopted the forthcoming 1928 Bogoljubow–Euwe match (won by Bogoljubow) as being for the &quot;FIDE championship&quot;. Alekhine agreed to place future matches for the world title under the auspices of FIDE, except that he would only play Capablanca under the same conditions that governed their match in 1927. Although FIDE wished to set up a match between Alekhine and Bogoljubow, it made little progress and the title &quot;Champion of FIDE&quot; quietly vanished after Alekhine won the 1929 world championship match that he and Bogoljubow themselves arranged.

While negotiating his 1937 World Championship rematch with Alekhine, Euwe proposed that if he retained the title, FIDE should manage the nomination of future challengers and the conduct of championship matches. FIDE had been trying since 1935 to introduce rules on how to select challengers, and its various proposals favored selection by some sort of committee. While they were debating procedures in 1937 and Alekhine and Euwe were preparing for their rematch later that year, the Royal Dutch Chess Federation proposed that a super-tournament (AVRO) of ex-champions and rising stars should be held to select the next challenger. FIDE rejected this proposal and at their second attempt nominated Salo Flohr as the official challenger. Euwe then declared that: if he retained his title against Alekhine he was prepared to meet Flohr in 1940 but he reserved the right to arrange a title match either in 1938 or 1939 with José Raúl Capablanca, who had lost the title to Alekhine in 1927; if Euwe lost his title to Capablanca then FIDE&#x27;s decision should be followed and Capablanca would have to play Flohr in 1940. Most chess writers and players strongly supported the Dutch super-tournament proposal and opposed the committee processes favored by FIDE. While this confusion went unresolved: Euwe lost his title to Alekhine; the AVRO tournament in 1938 was won by Paul Keres under a tie-breaking rule, with Reuben Fine placed second and Capablanca and Flohr in the bottom places; and the outbreak of World War II in 1939 cut short the controversy.

====Birth of FIDE&#x27;s World Championship cycle (1946–1948)====

Alexander Alekhine died in 1946 before anyone else could win against him in match for the World Champion title. This resulted in an &quot;interregnum&quot; that made the normal procedure impossible. The situation was very confused, with many respected players and commentators offering different solutions. FIDE found it very difficult to organize the early discussions on how to resolve the &quot;interregnum&quot; because problems with money and travel so soon after the end of World War II prevented many countries from sending representatives. The shortage of clear information resulted in otherwise responsible magazines publishing rumors and speculation, which only made the situation more confusing.
It did not help that the Soviet Union had long refused to join FIDE, and by this time it was clear that about half the credible contenders were Soviet citizens. But, realizing that it could not afford to be excluded from discussions about the vacant world championship, the Soviet Union sent a telegram in 1947 apologizing for the absence of Soviet representatives and requesting that the USSR be represented on future FIDE Committees.

The eventual solution was very similar to FIDE&#x27;s initial proposal and to a proposal put forward by the Soviet Union (authored by Mikhail Botvinnik). The 1938 AVRO tournament was used as the basis for the 1948 Championship Tournament. The AVRO tournament had brought together the eight players who were, by general acclamation, the best players in the world at the time. Two of the participants at AVRO – Alekhine and former world champion José Raúl Capablanca – had died; but FIDE decided that the championship should be awarded to the winner of a round-robin tournament in which the other six participants at AVRO would play four games against each other. These players were: Max Euwe, from the Netherlands; Botvinnik, Paul Keres and Salo Flohr from the Soviet Union; and Reuben Fine and Samuel Reshevsky from the United States. However, FIDE soon accepted a Soviet request to substitute Vasily Smyslov for Flohr, and Fine dropped out in order to continue his degree studies in psychology, so only five players competed. Botvinnik won convincingly and thus became world champion, ending the &quot;interregnum&quot;.

The proposals which led to the 1948 Championship Tournament also specified the procedure by which challengers for the World Championship would be selected in a three-year cycle: countries affiliated to FIDE would send players to Zonal Tournaments (the number varied depending on how many good enough players each country had); the players who gained the top places in these would compete in an Interzonal Tournament (later split into two and then three tournaments as the number of countries and eligible players increased); the highest-placed players from the Interzonal would compete in the Candidates Tournament, along with whoever lost the previous title match and the second-placed competitor in the previous Candidates Tournament three years earlier; and the winner of the Candidates played a title match against the champion. Until 1962 inclusive the Candidates Tournament was a multi-cycle round-robin tournament – how and why it was changed are described below.

====FIDE system (1949–1963)====
The FIDE system followed its 1948 design through five cycles: 1948–1951, 1951–1954, 1954–1957, 1957–1960 and 1960–1963. The first two world championships under this system were drawn 12–12 – Botvinnik-Bronstein in 1951 and Botvinnik-Smyslov in 1954 – so Botvinnik retained the title both times. In 1956 FIDE introduced two apparently minor changes which Soviet grandmaster and chess official Yuri Averbakh alleged were instigated by the two Soviet representatives in FIDE, who were personal friends of reigning champion Mikhail Botvinnik. A defeated champion would have the right to a return match. FIDE also limited the number of players from the same country that could compete in the Candidates Tournament, on the grounds that it would reduce Soviet dominance of the tournament. Averbakh claimed that this was to Botvinnik&#x27;s advantage as it reduced the number of Soviet players he might have to meet in the title match. Botvinnik lost to Vasily Smyslov in 1957 but won the return match in 1958, and lost to Mikhail Tal in 1960 but won the return match in 1961. Thus Smyslov and Tal each held the world title for a year, but Botvinnik was world champion for rest of the time from 1948 to 1963. The return match clause was not in place for the 1963 cycle. Tigran Petrosian won the 1962 Candidates and then defeated Botvinnik in 1963 to become world champion.

====FIDE system (1963–1975)====

After the 1962 Candidates, Bobby Fischer publicly alleged that the Soviets had colluded to prevent any non-Soviet – specifically him – from winning. He claimed that Petrosian, Efim Geller and Paul Keres had prearranged to draw all their games, and that Viktor Korchnoi had been instructed to lose to them. Yuri Averbakh, who was head of the Soviet team, confirmed in 2002 that Petrosian, Geller and Keres arranged to draw all their games in order to save their energy for games against non-Soviet players. Korchnoi, who defected from the USSR in 1976, never confirmed that he was forced to throw games. FIDE responded by changing the format of future Candidates Tournaments to eliminate the possibility of collusion. Beginning in the next cycle, 1963–1966, the round-robin tournament was replaced by a series of elimination matches. Initially the quarter-finals and semi-finals were best of 10 games, and the final was best of 12. Fischer, however, refused to take part in the 1966 cycle, and dropped out of the 1969 cycle after a controversy at 1967 Interzonal in Sousse. Both these Candidates cycles were won by Boris Spassky, who lost the title match to Petrosian in 1966, but won and became world champion in 1969.

In the 1969–1972 cycle Fischer caused two more crises. He refused to play in the 1969 US Championship, which was a Zonal Tournament. This would have eliminated him from the 1969–1972 cycle, but Pal Benko was persuaded to concede his place in the Interzonal to Fischer. FIDE President Max Euwe accepted this maneuver and interpreted the rules very flexibly to enable Fischer to play, as he thought it important for the health and reputation of the game that Fischer should have the opportunity to challenge for the title as soon as possible. Fischer crushed all opposition and won the right to challenge reigning champion Boris Spassky. After agreeing to play in Yugoslavia, Fischer raised a series of objections and Iceland was the final venue. Even then Fischer raised difficulties, mainly over money. It took a phone call from United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and a doubling of the prize money by financier Jim Slater to persuade him to play. After a few more traumatic moments Fischer won the match 12½–8½.

An unbroken line of FIDE champions had thus been established from 1948 to 1972, with each champion gaining his title by beating the previous incumbent. This came to an end when Anatoly Karpov won the right to challenge Fischer in 1975. Fischer objected to the &quot;best of 24 games&quot; championship match format that had been used from 1951 onwards, claiming that it would encourage whoever got an early lead to play for draws. Instead he demanded that the match should be won by whoever first won 10 games, except that if the score reached 9–9 he should remain champion. He argued that this was more advantageous to the challenger than the champion&#x27;s advantage under the existing system, where the champion retained the title if the match was tied at 12–12 including draws. Eventually FIDE deposed Fischer and crowned Karpov as the new champion. Fischer privately maintained that he was still World Champion. He went into seclusion and did not play chess in public again until 1992, when Spassky agreed to participate in an unofficial rematch for the World Championship. Fischer won the 1992 Fischer–Spassky rematch decisively with a score of 10–5.

====Karpov and Kasparov (1975–1993)====

After becoming world champion by default, Karpov confirmed his worthiness for the title with a string of tournament successes from the mid 70s to the early 80s. He defended his title twice against ex-Soviet Viktor Korchnoi, first in Baguio in 1978 (6–5 with 21 draws) and in Merano in 1981 (6–2, with 10 draws). In the 1984 World Chess Championship, Karpov fought against Garry Kasparov. Karpov retained the title after the tournament went for more than five months and was terminated with Karpov leading with five wins to Kasparov&#x27;s three and 40 draws after 48 matches.

Karpov eventually lost his title in 1985 to Kasparov, who won the title by a scoreline of 13–11. The two played three more subsequent championships in World Chess Championship 1986 (won by Kasparov, 12½–11½), World Chess Championship 1987 (drawn 12–12, Kasparov retained the title), and World Chess Championship 1990 (won by Kasparov, 12½–11½). In the five tournaments, Kasparov and Karpov played a total of 144 World Championship games with 104 draws, 21 wins by Kasparov and 19 wins by Karpov.

===Split title (1993–2006)===
In 1993, Nigel Short broke the domination of Kasparov and Karpov by defeating Karpov in the candidates semi-finals followed by Jan Timman in the finals, thereby earning the right to challenge Kasparov for the title. However, before the match took place, both Kasparov and Short complained of FIDE&#x27;s mishandling of the prize pool in organizing the match, corruption in the leadership, and FIDE&#x27;s failure to abide by their own rules, and split from FIDE to set up the Professional Chess Association (PCA), under whose auspices they held their match. In response, FIDE stripped Kasparov of his title and held a championship match between Karpov and Timman. For the first time in history, there were two World Chess Champions: Kasparov defeated Short and Karpov beat Timman.

FIDE and the PCA each held a championship cycle in 1993–1996, with many of the same challengers playing in both. Kasparov and Karpov both won their respective cycles. In the PCA cycle, Kasparov defeated Viswanathan Anand in the PCA World Chess Championship 1995. Karpov defeated Gata Kamsky in the final of the FIDE World Chess Championship 1996. Negotiations were held for a reunification match between Kasparov and Karpov in 1996–97, but nothing came of them.

Soon after the 1995 championship, the PCA folded, and Kasparov had no organisation to choose his next challenger. In 1998 he formed the World Chess Council, which organised a candidates match between Alexei Shirov and Vladimir Kramnik. Shirov won the match, but negotiations for a Kasparov–Shirov match broke down, and Shirov was subsequently omitted from negotiations, much to his disgust. Plans for a 1999 or 2000 Kasparov–Anand match also broke down, and Kasparov organised a match with Kramnik in late 2000. In a major upset, Kramnik won the match with two wins, thirteen draws, and no losses. At the time the championship was called the Braingames World Chess Championship, but Kramnik later referred to himself as the Classical World Chess Champion.

Meanwhile, FIDE had decided to scrap the Interzonal and Candidates system, instead having a large knockout event in which a large number of players contested short matches against each other over just a few weeks (see FIDE World Chess Championship 1998). Rapid and blitz games were used to resolve ties at the end of each round, a format which some felt did not necessarily recognize the highest-quality play: Kasparov refused to participate in these events, as did Kramnik after he won the Classical title in 2000. In the first of these events, in 1998, champion Karpov was seeded directly into the final, but he later had to qualify alongside the other players. Karpov defended his title in the first of these championships in 1998, but resigned his title in protest at the new rules in 1999. Alexander Khalifman won the FIDE World Championship in 1999, Anand in 2000, Ruslan Ponomariov in 2002, and Rustam Kasimdzhanov in 2004.

By 2002, not only were there two rival champions, but Kasparov&#x27;s strong results – he had the top Elo rating in the world and had won a string of major tournaments after losing his title in 2000 – ensured even more confusion over who was World Champion. In May 2002, American grandmaster Yasser Seirawan led the organisation of the so-called &quot;Prague Agreement&quot; to reunite the world championship. Kramnik had organised a candidates tournament (won later in 2002 by Peter Leko) to choose his challenger. It was agreed that Kasparov would play the FIDE champion (Ponomariov) for the FIDE title, and the winner of that match would face the winner of the Kramnik–Leko match for the unified title. However, the matches proved difficult to finance and organise. The Kramnik–Leko match did not take place until late 2004 (it was drawn, so Kramnik retained his title). 

Meanwhile, FIDE never managed to organise a Kasparov match, either with 2002 FIDE champion Ponomariov, or 2004 FIDE champion Kasimdzhanov. Kasparov&#x27;s frustration at the situation played a part in his decision to retire from chess in 2005, still ranked No. 1 in the world. Soon after, FIDE dropped the short knockout format for a World Championship and announced the FIDE World Chess Championship 2005, a double round robin tournament to be held in San Luis, Argentina between eight of the leading players in the world. However Kramnik insisted that his title be decided in a match, and declined to participate. The tournament was convincingly won by the Bulgarian Veselin Topalov, and negotiations began for a Kramnik–Topalov match to unify the title.

===Reunified title (since 2006)===
====Kramnik (2006–2007)====

The World Chess Championship 2006 reunification match between Topalov and Kramnik was held in late 2006. After much controversy, it was won by Kramnik. Kramnik thus became the first unified and undisputed World Chess Champion since Kasparov split from FIDE to form the PCA in 1993. This match, along with all subsequent world championships, was administered by FIDE.

====Anand (2007–2013)====
Kramnik played to defend his title at the World Chess Championship 2007 in Mexico. This was an 8-player double round robin tournament, the same format as was used for the FIDE World Chess Championship 2005. This tournament was won by Viswanathan Anand, thus making him the World Chess Champion. Because Anand&#x27;s World Chess Champion title was won in a tournament rather than a match, a minority of commentators questioned the validity of his title. Kramnik also made ambiguous comments about the value of Anand&#x27;s title, but did not claim the title himself then. (In a 2015 interview Kramnik dated the loss of his world championship title to his 2008 match against Anand rather than the 2007 tournament, and he likewise did not contradict an interviewer who dated it thus in a 2019 interview.) Subsequent world championship matches returned to the format of a match between the champion and a challenger.

The following two championships had special clauses arising from the 2006 unification. Kramnik was given the right to challenge for the title he lost in a tournament in the World Chess Championship 2008, which Anand won. Then Topalov, who as the loser of the 2006 match was excluded from the 2007 championship, was seeded directly into the Candidates final of the World Chess Championship 2010. He won the Candidates (against Gata Kamsky) to set up a match against Anand, who again won the championship match. The next championship, the World Chess Championship 2012, had short knock-out matches for the Candidates Tournament. This format was not popular with everyone, and world No. 1 Magnus Carlsen withdrew in protest. Boris Gelfand won the Candidates. Anand won the championship match again, in tie breaking rapid games, for his fourth consecutive world championship win.

====Carlsen (2013–2023)====
Since 2013, the Candidates Tournament has been an eight-player double round robin tournament, with the winner playing a match against the champion for the title. Norwegian Magnus Carlsen won the 2013 Candidates and then convincingly defeated Anand in the World Chess Championship 2013.

Beginning with the 2014 Championship cycle, the World Championship has followed a 2-year cycle: qualification for the Candidates in the odd year, the Candidates tournament early in the even year, and the World Championship match later in the even year. This and the next two cycles resulted in Carlsen successfully defending his title: against Anand in 2014; against Sergey Karjakin in 2016; and against Fabiano Caruana in 2018. Both the 2016 and 2018 defences were decided by tie-break in rapid games.

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the 2020 Candidates Tournament, and caused the next match to be postponed from 2020 to 2021. Carlsen again successfully defended his title, defeating Ian Nepomniachtchi in the World Chess Championship 2021.

====Ding (2023–2024)====

Soon after the 2021 match, Carlsen indicated that he would not defend the title again. This was confirmed in an announcement by FIDE on 20 July 2022. As a consequence, the top two finishers of the Candidates Tournament, Ian Nepomniachtchi and Ding Liren, played in the 2023 championship in Astana, Kazakhstan, from 7 April to 30 April 2023. Ding won in rapid tiebreaks, making him the first World Chess Champion from China. FIDE referred to Ding as the &quot;17th World Champion&quot;; thus the &quot;Classical&quot; line of Champions during the split has been &quot;de facto&quot; legitimised over the FIDE line by FIDE itself.

====Gukesh (2024–present)====

The next world championship was held in 2024, from 25 November to 12 December in Singapore. Ding Liren lost his title to Gukesh Dommaraju, by 7½ to 6½. The match saw five wins (three by Gukesh and two by Ding) and nine draws in its 14 games; the players were tied going into the final game. At 18 years old, Gukesh became the youngest undisputed World Chess Champion.

==Format==
Until 1948, world championship contests were arranged privately between the players. As a result, the players also had to arrange the funding, in the form of stakes provided by enthusiasts who wished to bet on one of the players. In the early 20th century this was sometimes an obstacle that prevented or delayed challenges for the title. Between 1888 and 1948 various difficulties that arose in match negotiations led players to try to define agreed rules for matches, including the frequency of matches, how much or how little say the champion had in the conditions for a title match and what the stakes and division of the purse should be. However these attempts were unsuccessful in practice, as the same issues continued to delay or prevent challenges. There was an attempt by an external organization to manage the world championship from 1887 to 1889, but this experiment was not repeated until 1948.

After the death of world champion Alexander Alekhine in 1946, the World Chess Championship 1948 was a one-off tournament to decide a new world champion.

Since 1948, the world championship has mainly operated on a two or three-year cycle, with four stages:

# Zonal tournaments: different regional tournaments to qualify for the following stage. Qualifiers from zonals play in the Interzonal (up to 1993), knockout world championship (1998 to 2004) or Chess World Cup (since 2005).
# Candidates qualification tournaments. From 1948 to 1993, the only such tournament was the Interzonal. Since 2005, the Interzonal has mainly been replaced by the Chess World Cup. However extra qualification events have also been added: the FIDE Grand Prix, a series of tournaments restricted to the top 20 or so players in the world; and the Grand Swiss tournament. Since 2023, the Grand Prix has been replaced by the FIDE Circuit, making many more tournaments (besides those organised by FIDE) contribute towards Candidates qualification. In addition, a small number of players sometimes qualify directly for the Candidates either by finishing highly in the previous cycle, on rating, or as a wild card.
# The Candidates Tournament is a tournament to choose the challenger. Over the years it has varied in size (between 8 and 16 players) and in format (a tournament, a set of matches, or a combination of the two). Since the 2013 cycle it has always been an eight-player, double round-robin tournament.
# The championship match between the champion and the challenger.

There have been a few exceptions to this system:
* In the 1957 and 1960 cycles, a rule existed which allowed the champion a rematch if he lost the championship match, leading to the 1958 and 1961 matches. There were also one-off rematches in 1986 and 2008.
* The 1975 world championship was not held, as the champion (Fischer) refused to defend his title; his challenger (Karpov) became champion by default.
* There were many variations during the world title split between 1993 and 2006. FIDE determined the championship by a single knockout tournament between 1998 and 2004, and by an eight-player tournament in 2005; meanwhile, the Classical world championship had no qualifying stages in 2000, and only a Candidates tournament in its 2004 cycle.
* A one-off match to reunite the world championship was held in 2006.
* The 2007 world championship was determined by an eight-player tournament instead of a match.
* The 2023 world championship was played between the top two finishers of the Candidates, as the champion (Carlsen) refused to defend his title

==World champions==
===Pre-FIDE world champions (1886–1946)===
===FIDE world champions (1948–1993)===
===Classical (PCA/Braingames) world champions (1993–2006)===
===FIDE world champions (1993–2006)===
===FIDE (reunified) world champions (2006–present)===
===World Champions by number of title match victories===
The table below organises the world champions in order of championship wins. A successful defense counts as a win for the purposes of this table, even if the match is drawn. The table is made more complicated by the split between the &quot;Classical&quot; and FIDE world titles between 1993 and 2006. If total number of championship wins is identical, the number of wins at undisputed championships, the number of years as undisputed champion, the number of years as champion are used as tie-breakers (in that order). If all numbers are the same, the players are listed by year of first victory at world championships (in chronological order).

<doc id="166668" wikidata="Q4832563" url="?curid=166668" title="Heavy weapons platoon">
<text>Heavy weapons platoon (HWP) is a term from military science which refers to an infantry platoon equipped with machine guns, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades, flamethrowers, grenade launchers, anti-tank weapons, or any other weapons that are portable but heavier than a single infantryman can reasonably transport and operate by themselves for combat, generally a crew-served weapon. Heavy weapons platoons are grouped into a weapons company or maneuver support company, which focuses on moving and using heavy weapons to support light infantry rifle companies armed with standard-issue small arms.

==British Army==
In the British Army, the manoeuvre support company possesses an Anti-Tank platoon armed with 8 Javelin missile launchers, a reconnaissance platoon, a mortar platoon (with eight 81 mm mortars), an assault pioneer platoon, and, in the case of Light Role battalions, a machine gun platoon (with nine FN MAG general purpose machine guns).

==U.S. Army regulations==
According to U.S. Army regulations 320-5 (AR 320-5) &quot;heavy weapons&quot; are all &quot;weapons such as mortars, howitzers, guns, heavy machineguns and recoilless rifles which are usually part of infantry equipment.&quot;

==Size==
As with most support units in any army, the size of a weapons platoon is generally smaller than that of its light infantry equivalent. For example, a typical light infantry platoon consists of 30 to 40 men divided in three or four squads (or sections) of 9–13 men, whereas a weapons platoon substitutes the squads with smaller groups for mortar teams, machine gun crews, anti-tank teams etc. Some platoons also include the assault element of a company. A company&#x27;s weapons platoon will carry portable support weapons by sections, but also include a fast-attack light-infantry specialist squad of soldiers trained for breaching, raiding, and close combat.

A heavy weapon platoon is generally used as a support group to a number of other platoons in the immediate command area/zone in question. A ratio of one heavy platoon to three basic infantry platoons is the accepted number, anything above or below this may result in a specialised &quot;company&quot; such as a rifle company, or a long-range support company. The addition of a HWP can greatly increase the chances of victory in a combat zone, due to the unique specialist abilities the soldiers in that group can offer to the company.

In more modern times, the application of heavy weapon support groups has increased. The ability to provide covering fire, and the suppression tactics of the heavy platoon mean that it is better equipped to give cover, and forms a vital component to the overall success, supporting the bulk of the company as they advance. The advancement in troop transportation has lessened the problems of re-locating heavy weaponry and large quantities of ammunition.

==Example: US Army Weapons Platoon in WW2==

A February 1944 Table of organization and equipment show the following details about a US Army WW2 weapons platoon:

* A Rifle Company was made up of 3 Rifle Platoons and 1 Weapons Platoon.
* A Weapons Platoon was made up of a six-man Headquarters, a Mortar Section and a Light Machine Gun Section.
* The Platoon Headquarters was armed with a single .50 caliber M2 Browning heavy machine gun
* The Mortar Section was made up of a two-man HQ and three five-man squads, each squad armed with a single 60mm M2 mortar - a total of 17 men and 3 Mortars.
* The Light Machine Gun Section was made up of a two-man HQ and two five-man squads, each squad armed with a single .30 caliber M1919 Browning machine gun - a total of 12 men and 2 machine guns.
* A full-strength Weapons platoon had 35 men in total with one officer. Apart from the special weapons, 16 of these men were issued with the light M1 carbine and 9 being issued the heavier M1 Garand rifle. 5 of those armed with the M1 rifle were also issued with the M7 grenade launcher. The remaining 10 men were armed with the M1911 pistol as their sidearm.

<text>A brigade is a major tactical military formation that typically comprises three to six battalions plus supporting elements. It is roughly equivalent to an enlarged or reinforced regiment. Two or more brigades may constitute a division.

Brigades formed into divisions are usually infantry or armored (sometimes referred to as combined arms brigades). In addition to combat units, they may include combat support units or sub-units, such as artillery and engineers, and logistic units. Historically, such brigades have been called brigade-groups. On operations, a brigade may comprise both organic elements and attached elements, including some temporarily attached for a specific task.

Brigades may also be specialized and comprise battalions of a single branch, for example cavalry, mechanized, armored, artillery, air defence, aviation, engineers, signals or logistic. Some brigades are classified as independent or separate and operate independently from the traditional division structure. The typical NATO standard brigade consists of approximately 5,000 troops. However, in Switzerland and Austria, the numbers could start as high as 10,000 troops. The Soviet Union as well as its forerunners and successors have mostly used &quot;regiment&quot; instead of brigade, and this was common in much of Europe until after World War II.

A brigade&#x27;s commander is commonly a major general, brigadier general, brigadier or colonel. In some armies, the commander is rated as a general officer. The brigade commander has a self-contained headquarters and staff. The principal staff officer, usually a lieutenant colonel or colonel, may be designated chief of staff. Until the late 20th century British and similar armies called the position &#x27;brigade-major&#x27; and most British brigades have a major as the chief of staff. Some brigades may also have a deputy commander. The headquarters has a nucleus of staff officers and support (clerks, assistants and drivers) that can vary in size depending on the type of brigade. On operations, additional specialist elements may be attached. The headquarters will usually have its own communications unit.

In some gendarmerie forces, brigades are the basic-level organizational unit.

==Origin==
Borrowed from the French cognate word &quot;brigade&quot;, the term originates from the Italian noun , itself derived from the Italian verb , to contend or fight. The word is first attested in England in the 17th century as a term for a larger military unit than the squadron or regiment. It was first adopted when armies began to consist of formations larger than a single regiment. Previously each regiment, battalion, cavalry squadron, or artillery battery operated somewhat independently, with its own field officer (i.e., colonel, lieutenant colonel, or major) or battery commander (usually a captain) reporting directly to the field force or &quot;army&quot; commander. As such a &quot;field army&quot; became larger, the number of subordinate commanders became unmanageable for the officer in general command of said army, usually a major general, to effectively command. In order to streamline command relationships, as well as effect some modicum of tactical control, especially in regard to combined arms operations (i.e., those involving a coordination of infantry with cavalry and/or artillery forces), an intermediate level of command came into existence.

The Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus improved the brigade as a tactical unit, introducing it in 1631 during a reorganization of the Swedish Army in the course of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The invention of the brigade overcame the lack of coordination inherent in the traditional army structure consisting of independent regiments of infantry and units of supporting arms (viz., cavalry and artillery) acting separately under their individual commanding officers. Gustavus Adolphus accomplished this battlefield coordination by combining battalions of infantry with cavalry troops and artillery batteries into a &quot;battle group&quot;, viz., or &quot;brigade&quot; commanded by a senior colonel, or lieutenant colonel, appointed as a &quot;brigadier-general&quot;.

In France, Marshal Turenne (1611–1675) copied the brigade organization; he made it a permanent standing unit, requiring the creation in 1667 of a permanent rank of (literally translating to &quot;brigadier of the armies of the king&quot;). Unlike the Swedish brigades, French brigades at that time comprised two to five regiments of the same branch ( etc.). The rank, intermediate between colonel and , disappeared in 1788 and should not be confused with that of , which is equivalent to a brigadier general. (A modern is referred to occasionally as .)

==By country==
===Argentina===
In the Argentinian Army, the typical brigade comprises an HQ company, two or three battalions (called &quot;regiments&quot; for historical reasons) of the brigade&#x27;s main branch (infantry or armoured cavalry), which give the brigade its denomination (mechanized, armoured, airborne, mountain or jungle), plus one battalion of the other branch, plus one or two artillery groups, an engineers battalion or company, a signals company, and intelligence company, an army aviation section and a logistics battalion. Mountain brigades have also a special forces (called &quot;Mountain rangers&quot;) company. The brigade is usually commanded by a brigadier general or a senior colonel, who may be promoted to general during his tenure as brigade commander.

===Australia===
In the Australian Army, the brigade has always been the smallest tactical formation, since regiments are either administrative groupings of battalions (in the infantry) or battalion-sized units (in the cavalry). A typical brigade may consist of approximately 5,500 personnel between two mechanised infantry battalions, an armoured regiment, an armoured artillery regiment, and other logistic and engineering units. The brigade is usually commanded by an officer holding the rank of brigadier, who is referred to as the &quot;Brigade Commander&quot;.

===Canada===
, the Canadian Army has three Regular Force brigade groups, designated as Canadian mechanized brigade groups (CMBG): 1 CMBG, 2 CMBG, which contain the regular army&#x27;s Anglophone units, and 5 CMBG, the regular Francophone formation. These CMBGs each comprise
* One headquarters and signal regiment
* Two mechanized infantry battalions
* One light infantry battalion
* One armoured regiment
* One mechanized artillery regiment
* One engineer regiment
* One combat service support (CSS) battalion.

Co-located with each CMBG is a field ambulance, a tactical helicopter squadron, and a military police platoon. Regular Force CMBG&#x27;s strengths are 5,000 personnel. Canada also has ten Primary Reserve brigades (Canadian brigade group, CBG), 31 CBG through 39 CBG, and 41 CBG. The CBG formations are for administrative purposes.

===France===
On 1 January 1791, France replaced the word &quot;Regiment&quot; that had been associated with the former Royal regime with the term &quot;demi-brigade&quot;.

France replaced its divisions with brigades in 1999 (so for example the 2nd Armored Division became the 2nd Armored Brigade). It was decided in 2016 to again form two divisions (1st and 3rd) made up of four and three brigades for a total of seven brigades: two armored, two &quot;intermediate&quot;, two light brigades (alpine and parachute) and the Franco-German Brigade. There is also an airmobile brigade subordinated to the army aviation command.

In peacetime, brigades serve primarily as force providers. The units deployed (battlegroups and task-forces) are battalion-size units provided by the regiments composing the brigades.

===India===
In Indian army, a brigade consists of a HQ, three battalions along with supporting troops. It is commanded by an army officer of the rank of Brigadier (Single star commander).

===Japan===

Brigades in the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) are combined arms and are similar to divisions. There are eight brigades in the JGSDF, with some of them formed from former divisions. A brigade in the JGSDF consists of 3,000–4,000 soldiers and is led by a major general.

* 1st Airborne Brigade, at Camp Narashino in Funabashi, Chiba Prefecture
* 5th Brigade, at Camp Obihiro in Obihiro, responsible for the defense of North Eastern Hokkaidō
* 11th Brigade, at Camp Makomanai in Sapporo, responsible for the defense of South Western Hokkaidō
* 12th Brigade (Air Assault), at Camp Soumagahara in Shintō, responsible for the defense of Gunma, Nagano, Niigata and Tochigi prefectures.
* 13th Brigade, in Kaita, responsible for the defense of the Chūgoku region.
* 14th Brigade, in Zentsūji, responsible for the defense of Shikoku.
* 15th Brigade, in Naha, responsible for the defense of Okinawa Prefecture
* Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade, at Camp Ainoura in Sasebo, Nagasaki; amphibious force equipped to deploy from ships, where needed.

===Norway===
The main core of the Norwegian Army is the Brigade Nord, consisting of eight battalions of which four are combat battalions (one infantry, one mechanized infantry, one artillery and one armored) and the rest are various types of support battalions.

The brigade is intended to be combat ready at all times. The combat battalions have a significant portion of professional soldiers (specialists). The fairly large size of the combat ready support contingent is also intended to complement the Heimevernet (translates as &quot;Home Defense&quot;) which is a large reserve infantry force, as well as act in a support capacity for an international cooperation force (e.g. NATO) in case of an invasion.

===Pakistan===
A brigade is under the command of a brigadier and comprises three or more battalions of different units depending on its functionality. An independent brigade would be one that primarily consists of an artillery unit, an infantry unit, an armour unit and logistics to support its actions. Such a brigade is not part of any division and is under direct command of a corps.

There are 7 independent armoured brigades, seven engineering brigades and eight air defense brigades. Independent armoured and infantry brigades are capable of extended operations without necessarily being reliant on a higher HQ for short-term logistic or intimate support. They can be used in counter-attack, exploitation of an advance, or rapid movement to reinforce formations under pressure.

=== People&#x27;s Republic of China ===
Prior to major restructures of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Ground Force (PLAGF), forces were designed around the division as the basic operational unit in a similar fashion to Soviet divisions, from which much of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) is designed. In 2003, the United States Army pivoted from division-centric warfare to combined-arms-centric warfare in response to the U.S. War in Iraq creating the brigade combat team (BCT). The Russian Federation followed suit reorganizing their forces and doctrine to switch from division-centric warfare to the use of battalion tactical groups (BTGs). Finally, the PLAGF, as part of a larger restructuring, underwent the so-called &quot;brigade-ization&quot; making PLAGF divisions a largely administrative echelon and moving forces into combined arms brigades (CA-BDE).

Structured very similarly to U.S. Army BCTs, the PLAGF combined arms brigade places maneuver, artillery, air defense, reconnaissance, engineer and protection, and logistics and sustainment under a single brigade-level command. The PLAGF distinguishes three distinct types of combined arms brigades: light (motorized), medium (mechanized), and heavy (armoured). These distinctive types are more indicative of the role of the organization within its parent unit than the composition and equipment which vary and overlap between types. A light combined arms brigade may be designed as an airborne, mountain, or amphibious combined arms brigade.

A combined arms brigade typically comprises the following organic units wherein the maneuver battalions vary between motorized, mechanized, or armoured depending on the type of CA-BDE.

* 1 headquarters unit
* 4 maneuver battalions (CA-BNs)
* 1 reconnaissance battalion
* 1 artillery battalion
* 1 air defense battalion
* 1 operational support battalion
* 1 service support (sustainment) battalion

===Republic of China===
An NRA Brigade, (), was a military formation of the Chinese Republic&#x27;s National Revolutionary Army. Infantry and cavalry brigades comprised two infantry regiments. After the 1938 reforms, the brigade was dispensed with within the infantry division in favour of the regiment to simplify the command structure.

===United Kingdom===
Brigades, with a field not a regional administrative role, have usually been of a named type and numbered since the 19th century (e.g. cavalry brigade or infantry brigade). Since the end of World War II, brigade numbers have been unique and not by type. Brigades in divisions do not usually command their combat support and combat service support units. These remain under divisional command, although they may be permanently affiliated with a particular brigade (as a &quot;brigade group&quot;). Historically, infantry or cavalry/armoured brigades have usually comprised three or four combat-arm battalions, but currently larger brigades are normal, made larger still when their affiliated artillery and engineer regiments are added.

Until 1918, the chief of staff of a brigade was known as a brigade major. Before 1922, British Army brigades were normally commanded by general officers holding the rank of brigadier-general (equivalent to a &quot;one-star&quot; rank in the US Army); after that date, the brigade commander was an appointment for officers with the rank of brigadier, which were then classified as field officers not general officers. This is universally the case today.

From 1859 to 1938, &quot;brigade&quot; (&quot;brigade-division&quot; 1885–1903) was also the term used for a battalion-sized unit of the Royal Artillery. This was because, unlike infantry battalions and cavalry regiments, which were organic, artillery units consisted of individually numbered batteries that were &quot;brigaded&quot; together. The commanding officer of such a brigade was a lieutenant colonel. In 1938, the Royal Artillery adopted the term &quot;regiment&quot; for this size of unit, and &quot;brigade&quot; became used in its normal sense, particularly for groups of anti-aircraft artillery regiments commanded by a brigadier.

In the Second World War, a tank brigade comprised three tank regiments and was equipped with infantry tanks for supporting the infantry divisions. Armoured brigades were equipped with cruiser tanks or (US Lend-Lease) medium tanks and a motorised infantry battalion. The armoured divisions included one or more armored brigades.

===United States===
====Army====

In the United States Army, a brigade is smaller than a division and roughly equal to or a little larger than a regiment. During the American Civil War infantry brigades contained two to five regiments with the idea being to maintain a unit with a strength of 2,000 soldiers and were usually commanded by a brigadier general or a senior colonel. During World War I the division consisted of two brigades of two regiments each.

More recently, the U.S. Army has moved to a new generic brigade combat team (BCT) in which each brigade contains combat elements and their support units. After the 2013 reform, BCT personnel strength typically ranges from 4,400 personnel for infantry BCTs, to 4,500 personnel for Stryker BCTs, to 4,700 personnel for armoured BCTs. This formation is standard across the active U.S. Army, U.S. Army Reserve, and the Army National Guard.

The brigade commander is usually a colonel, although a lieutenant colonel can be selected for brigade command in lieu of an available colonel. A typical tour of duty for this assignment is 24 to 36 months. &quot;Separate&quot; brigades, viz., brigades not permanently assigned to a division, were commanded by brigadier generals.

A brigade commander has a headquarters and staff to assist them in commanding the brigade and its subordinate units. The typical staff includes:

* a brigade executive officer, usually a major
* a brigade command sergeant major
* a personnel officer (S1), usually a major
* an intelligence officer (S2), usually a major
* an operations officer (S3), usually a major
* a logistics officer (S4), usually a major
* a plans officer (S5), usually a major
* a communications officer (S6), usually a major
* a medical officer, usually a major
* a legal officer (JAG), usually a major
* a brigade chaplain, usually a major

In addition, the headquarters includes additional junior staff officers, non-commissioned officers, and enlisted support personnel in the occupational specialities of the staff sections; these personnel are ordinarily assigned to the brigade&#x27;s headquarters and headquarters company.

Functional brigades are those from the combat support or combat service support arms.

====Marine Corps====
In the United States Marine Corps, brigades are designated as marine expeditionary brigades (MEB) and are usually commanded by a brigadier general. The MEB is a mid-level marine air-ground task force (MAGTF) essentially forming a &quot;demi-division&quot;. The MEB organizational structure consists of a minimum of three regimental-equivalent-sized units and a command element (a regimental combat team, a composite marine aircraft group, a marine logistics regiment, and a MEB headquarters group). Each marine expeditionary force (MEF) contains a MEB, available for deployment on expeditionary duty. The MEB is the intermediate MAGTF between the MEF and the marine expeditionary unit (MEU). Along with the marine infantry regiments, the MEU, (while smaller than an army brigade), are the USMC organizational equivalents of army brigades. The MEU consists of three battalion-equivalent-sized units and a command element (a battalion landing team, a marine medium tilt-rotor squadron (reinforced), a combat logistics battalion, and a MEU headquarters group). The marine infantry regiments, combined with the marine artillery regiments, comprise the bulk of the marine divisions. An example of a MEB is Task Force Tarawa (2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade) during the Operation Iraqi Freedom campaign.

=== Myanmar ===
In Myanmar, a rough equivalent of a Brigade is called a Tactical Operation Command. It&#x27;s just a rough equivalent as a Tactical Operation Command has 3 Infantry Battalions under its command, there&#x27;re no such Brigade troops or anything, instead those units such as Military Engineer, Signal, Medical etc. are supposed to be organic to the battalions (sometimes called Regiments). A Tactical Operation Command HQ only consist of 4 Officers and 4 Other Ranks. Theoritically, a Tactical Operation Command of either a Light Infantry Division or a Military Operation Command should have 97 Officers (4+31+31+31) and 2478 (4+826+826+826) Other Ranks but this as of recent events, is far from reality 

Tactical Operation Command Headquarters (နည်းဗျူဟာကွပ်ကဲမှူအဖွဲ့): 4 Officers, 4 Other Ranks

Tactical Operation Commander (ဗျူဟာမှူး): Colonel

Chief of Staff (rough equivalent of Brigade Major) (ညှိနှိုင်းကွပ်ကဲရေးမှူး): Major (GSO II)

GS (စစ်ဦးစီးအရာရှိ): Captain (GSO III)

AQ (စစ်ရေး/စစ်ထောက်အရာရှိ): Captain (GSO III)

Sergeant (Clerk) (တပ်ကြပ်ကြီး (စာရေး) (4x) 

GSO II and GSO III are called G2 and G3 in daily usages.
