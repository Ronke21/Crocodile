<text>Colby College is a private liberal arts college in Waterville, Maine, United States. Founded in 1813 as the Maine Literary and Theological Institution, it was renamed Waterville College in 1821. The donations of Christian philanthropist Gardner Colby saw the institution renamed again to Colby University before settling on its current title, reflecting its liberal arts college curriculum, in 1899. Approximately 2,000 students from more than 60 countries are enrolled annually. The college offers 54 major fields of study and 30 minors.

Located in central Maine, the 714-acre Neo-Georgian campus sits atop Mayflower Hill and overlooks downtown Waterville and the Kennebec River Valley. Along with fellow Maine institutions Bates College and Bowdoin College, Colby competes in the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC) and the Colby-Bates-Bowdoin Consortium.

==History==

=== 19th century ===
On February 27, 1813, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, led by Baptists, adopted a petition to establish the Maine Literary and Theological Institution. It was moved to Waterville, Maine, and used 179 acres of land donated by citizens. In 1818, trustees assigned the institution to Jeremiah Chaplin and classes began in a vacant Waterville home. After Maine separated from Massachusetts in 1820, the first Maine legislature affirmed the Massachusetts charter for the institution, but made significant changes. Students could no longer be denied admission based on religion, the institution was prohibited from applying a religious test when selecting board members, and the trustees now had the authority to grant degrees. The Maine Literary and Theological Institution was renamed Waterville College on February 5, 1821, and four years later, the theological department was discontinued. In 1828 the trustees decided to turn the somewhat informal preparatory department of the college into a separate school named Waterville Academy (most recently called the Coburn Classical Institute).

In 1833, Rufus Babcock became Colby&#x27;s second president. That same year, students formed the nation&#x27;s first college-based anti-slavery society. In 1845, the college&#x27;s first Greek Society was formed, a chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon, which was followed by chapters of Zeta Psi in 1850 and Delta Upsilon in 1852.

During the Civil War, many young men were called away from school to join the fight; from Waterville College, Richard C. Shannon, Henry C. Merriam, and Benjamin Butler. Twenty-seven Waterville College students perished in the war, and more than 100 men from the town. In the years following the war, as was the case at many American colleges, Waterville College was left with few students remaining to pay the bills and a depleted endowment. The college was on the verge of closing.

On August 9, 1865, prominent Baptist philanthropist Gardner Colby attended Waterville College&#x27;s commencement dinner, and unbeknownst to anyone in attendance except college president James Tift Champlin, announced a matching $50,000 donation to the college; two years later the college was named after him. Trustees of the college voted to construct a library and chapel to honor the Colby men who died in the war, called the Memorial Hall; it was dedicated at the commencement of 1869. The college remained isolated from neighboring Bates College, and Bowdoin College due to its location in Waterville, coupled with socio-economic and political differences. At the 1871 commencement, a Martin Milmore sculpture based on the &quot;Lion of Lucerne&quot; was added as the centerpiece of the building.

In the fall of 1871, Colby University was the first all-male college in New England to accept female students. The national Sigma Kappa sorority was founded at Colby in 1874 by the college&#x27;s first five female students. However the college resegregated them in 1890. One of the buildings is named after the first woman to attend, Mary Caffrey Low, who was the valedictorian of the class of 1875. In 1874, based on the success of its partnership with the Coburn Classical Institute, Colby created relationships with Hebron Academy and Houlton Academy (most recently known as Ricker College). In 1893, the Higgins Classical Institute was also deeded to Colby – the last preparatory school that the university would acquire. Students published the first issue of &quot;The Colby Echo&quot; in 1877. On January 25, 1899, Colby president Nathaniel Butler Jr. &#x27;73, renamed the &quot;university&quot; Colby College.

=== 20th century ===
In 1920, Colby celebrated its centennial, marking not the date of the original charter (1813), but the date of its charter from the new State of Maine in 1820.

In June 1929, Franklin W. Johnson was appointed president of the college. That same year saw the public release of the Maine Higher Education Survey Report, which gave Colby&#x27;s campus a less than desirable review. Criticisms included a cramped location on just 28 acres located between the Kennebec River and the Maine Central Railroad Company tracks through Waterville, an aging physical plant, proximity to the unpleasant odors of a pulp mill, and the soot of the railroad. Using the report as justification, President Johnson presented a proposal to the Trustees on June 14, 1929, to move the college to a more adequate location . The campaign to raise funds for the move was immediately complicated by the Wall Street crash of 1929 and the Great Depression, and competing offers for the college&#x27;s contemplated location emerged. Most notably, William H. Gannett offered a site in Augusta, a financially attractive option for the college, but a troublesome prospect for the town of Waterville. Ultimately, a joint effort between Waterville citizens and the college raised more than $100,000 to purchase near the outskirts of the city on Mayflower Hill, and the deed was presented to the college on April 12, 1931.

====Mayflower Hill====
In 1937, according to master plans drawn up by Jens Fredrick Larson, construction broke ground on Lorimer Chapel, the first building on the new Mayflower Hill campus. In 1956, the Maine State Highway Commission diverted the proposed path of Interstate 95 to swing clear of the new campus to the west, and in 1961, &quot;Parade&quot; magazine called the 24-mile section of I-95 from Augusta to Waterville &quot;America&#x27;s finest example of a &#x27;driver&#x27;s road&#x27; for scenery, speed, and safety.&quot; The college began competing athletically with Bowdoin and Bates in the 1940s, and officially joined the two colleges in the Colby-Bates-Bowdoin Consortium in 1965, after the University of Maine increased enrollment and moved to another athletic conference. The consortium became an athletic rivalry and academic exchange program.

=== 21st century ===
William D. Adams was the President of Colby from 2000 to 2014. Major accomplishments included conducting the largest capital campaign in the history of Maine, which raised $376 million; a new strategic plan for the college; accepting a major gift for the Colby College Museum of Art – the Lunder Collection of American Art – and the construction of a new wing for the museum to house it in 2013; expansion onto the &quot;Colby Green&quot; with the construction of the Diamond Building in 2007 and the Davis Science Building in 2014. In 2014, a documentary was created depicting a wide range of student experiences, including academic climate, social gatherings, athletics, and graduate outlooks, called &quot;Colby Life&quot;. On July 1, 2014, David Greene took office as the new president of the college.

==Academics==
Students choose from courses in 54 major fields and have flexibility in designing independent study programs, electing special majors, and participating in internships and study-abroad programs. Colby emphasizes project-based learning. Colby&#x27;s most popular majors, by 2021 graduates, were econometrics and quantitative economics (62); political science and government (62); computer science (34); psychology (32); environmental science (30); biology and biological sciences (29); and neuroscience (29). Volunteer programs and service learning take many students into the surrounding community. Colby employs 216 instructional faculty members, approximately 90% of whom hold a doctorate or other terminal degree.

More than two-thirds of Colby&#x27;s students spend time studying off-campus before they graduate. The college recognizes credits earned at over 200 off-campus programs in more than 60 countries. Additionally, studies at four programs locations are recognized for inclusion in students calculated grade-point averages: the International Center for French Studies at the University of Burgundy in Dijon, France; the St. Petersburg Classical Gymnasium in Saint Petersburg, Russia; the University of Salamanca in Salamanca, Spain; and the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Boothbay Harbor, Maine.

Colby also participates in engineering dual-degree programs with the Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science at Columbia University, and the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College. The programs vary in length and requirements. The Dartmouth College program, which is on a 2–1–1–1 schedule, is the more popular one. 
For the class of 2027, Colby College admitted 6% of applicants, accepting 1,142 out of nearly 17,800 applicants. This represents a 12.3 percentage point decrease from the acceptance rate for the class of 2020, which was 18.7%, due in part to the college&#x27;s decision to waive certain admissions requirements, such as the supplemental essay, and by increasing financial aid commitments.

===Rankings===
The 2024 annual ranking of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rates it the 25th best liberal arts college (tied with the University of Richmond overall in the U.S.), 8th for &quot;Best Value,&quot; tied at 7th for &quot;Most Innovative&quot; and tied at 36th for &quot;Best Undergraduate Teaching&quot; among liberal arts colleges. &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; ranked the college 37th in 2019 among 214 liberal arts colleges in the U.S. based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service. &quot;Forbes&quot; in 2019 rated Colby 75th overall in its America&#x27;s Top Colleges ranking of 650 military academies, national universities, and liberal arts colleges, and 32nd among liberal arts colleges. &quot;Kiplinger&#x27;s Personal Finance&quot; places Colby at 46th in its 2019 ranking of 149 best value liberal arts colleges in the United States. Colby College is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

In 2016, Niche gave the college an &quot;A+&quot; for academics, administration, food, campus quality and diversity, a &quot;B&quot; for campus housing, health &amp; safety, and athletics, and a &quot;C+&quot; for local city, and off-campus housing. In Niche&#x27;s official rankings, the college placed 16th for liberal arts and 46th overall. Colby was ranked 29th in the country by &quot;Parchment&quot;. Colby was also named one of &quot;25 New Ivies&quot; by Newsweek, named to the list of the top ten environmental programs by the 2010 Fiske Guide, and ranked 13th by the 2011 Sierra Club rankings of &quot;America&#x27;s coolest schools.&quot;

==Campus==

Colby&#x27;s 714-acre campus is situated on Mayflower Hill overlooking Waterville, Maine, located along the Kennebec River Valley in Central Maine. Most of Colby&#x27;s buildings are designed in the Georgian Revival style. The Goldfarb Center for Public Affairs and Civic Engagement organizes Colby&#x27;s engagement in the local community. The center also organizes Colby&#x27;s civic engagement programs. The college earned a top-25 listing on the Peace Corps&#x27; &quot;ranking of colleges that produce the most volunteers.&quot;

Colby is a residential college and almost all students live on campus. 

In February 2022, the college announced the acquisition of Allen and Benner islands, adjacent private islands four miles southwest of Port Clyde in the Gulf of Maine, from the Up East Foundation and the Wyeth Foundation for American Art.

===Libraries===

Colby&#x27;s three libraries—Miller Library, the Bixler Art and Music Library, and the Olin Science Library—have a collection of more than 900,000 books, journals, microfilms, music scores, sound recordings, videos/DVDs, and manuscripts. In 2022 the Olin Science Library was repurposed into offices for President Greene&#x27;s Artificial Intelligence and Entrepreneurship initiatives as well study spaces.

===Colby College Museum of Art===


The college&#x27;s Museum of Art was founded in 1959 with the building of the Mayflower Hill Campus. Admission is free to the museum, which serves both as a teaching resource for Colby College and as an active cultural institution for the residents of Maine and visitors to the state. It is notable for an entire wing dedicated to works by American painter Alex Katz, a particularly strong collection of American art, and its major outdoor sculptures by Richard Serra and Sol LeWitt. The museum is part of the Bixler Art and Music Center, a building named in honor of President J. Seelye Bixler (1942–1960) in recognition of his visionary support for the arts at Colby. The most recent addition to the museum was the Alfond-Lunder wing, opened in 2013 to display the recently donated Lunder Collection of American Art. The gallery space in the museum now exceeds 38,000 square feet, surpassing the Portland Museum of Art and making it the largest art museum in Maine.

===Sustainability===
In the fall of 2009, Colby launched &quot;Green Colby&quot; to highlight Colby&#x27;s environmental policies, including its carbon footprint, conservation, student-led initiatives. The school has signed a number of official agreements to reduce its environmental impact, including the Maine Governor&#x27;s Carbon Challenge and the American College and University President&#x27;s Climate Commitment (ACUPCC). As of April 2013, Colby became the fourth institution of higher education to achieve campus carbon neutrality.

All of the school&#x27;s electricity comes from renewable sources, including hydro and biomass, with 10 percent of campus electricity provided by an on-campus cogeneration turbine. The college has stated that all new buildings will comply with a minimum LEED silver standard, and renovated buildings will also include green features. The dining halls make an effort to purchase local and organic foods, and the elimination of trays has saved 79,000 gallons of water and 50 tons of food waste annually. Colby also has a composting program which processes more than 100 tons of food and yard waste annually. On the College Sustainability Report Card 2009 Colby earned a B; Colby&#x27;s grade was brought down by its lack of endowment transparency and shareholder engagement.

==Student life==
Colby&#x27;s 2,000 students, evenly divided between men and women, come from every state and more than 60 countries. Colby students are listed as 67.2% white, 10.2% unknown race, 24% of its students being ALANA (Asian, Latino, African American, etc.) and 7% being international.

Colby&#x27;s was one of the five original schools to partner with the Shelby Davis Scholarship program for graduates from the United World Colleges, dramatically increasing the international student population. Colby also participates in the Posse Foundation for multicultural scholars.

The college hosts myriad student-run organizations. The Student Government Association (SGA) advises and interacts with the college administration on issues ranging from policies and procedures to class presidents and dorm heads; it is also responsible for allocating funding to other student-run organizations.

===Athletics===

The Colby Mules compete in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III, the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC), and the Colby-Bates-Bowdoin Consortium. The three schools compete vigorously in athletics, most notably in football and the Chase Regatta.
There are 16 varsity teams for women, 15 for men, and one co-ed team. The official school colors are blue and gray. Approximately one-third of the student population participates in one or more of 32 intercollegiate varsity sports. Colby also offers club sports and an intramural sports program called I-Play. As of 2013, five graduates have qualified for the Olympic Games. Colby holds nine national titles in the NESCAC.

The Harold Alfond Athletic Center is the center of athletic life at Colby, and home to the Colby Mules. It contains the Wadsworth Gymnasium, with a capacity of 2,600 people, the Alfond Rink with 1,750 seats, the Colby swimming pool, The Dunaway Squash Courts, the Boulos Family Fitness Center, and a field house with a four-lane, 220-yard track, and athletic offices.

=== Fraternities ===

In 1984, following an investigation of campus life commissioned by the Board of Trustees, a decision was made to withdraw recognition from Colby&#x27;s Greek system as it was seen to be &quot;exclusionary by nature.&quot;

==Notable alumni==

Alumni, now numbering more than 25,000, are represented in all 50 states and 75 foreign countries. Alumni remain engaged with the college through alumni programs, affinity groups, and a directory and related services online, all offered by the Office of Alumni Relations.

Roberts, class of 1890, President from 1908 to 1927; and Franklin W. Johnson, class of 1891, President from 1929 to 1942. David Greene currently serves in the role since 2014.

==Insignia and other representations==

=== Seal and motto ===
&quot;Lux Mentis Scientia,&quot; meaning &quot;knowledge is the light of the mind,&quot; is the college&#x27;s motto. The college was originally authorized to have a seal by its founding charter, granted by the Massachusetts General Court in 1813. Presently, the seal figures prominently on college diplomas as well as other official communications and merchandise.
==== History and Revisions ====
The history of the seal tracks both the history of the school, which began under the name Maine Literary and Theological Institution, and sigillography generally. The earliest known seal came while the school was called Colby University. It featured a sun in splendour with eight straight rays above the school&#x27;s Latin motto. Surrounding the center are the words &quot;Sigillum Universitatis Colbianae,&quot; meaning &quot;the seal of Colby College,&quot; and two crossed olive branch with five leaves each. In 1899 the &quot;university&quot; was renamed Colby College, and a new seal was created with minor artistic changes to reflect the school&#x27;s new name.

In 1936, President Franklin W. Johnson commissioned William Addison Dwiggins to design a seal to replace the one then existing, specifying only that it used the same motto as the first and retain the sun as the central theme. The cost of the design was $50. The face on the sun was removed and the lettering and its positioning was changed.

In 2002, the college contracted with design firm Corey McPherson Nash for updates to its entire visual identity system, including the seal. The current seal is set in Perpetua typeface around a sunburst. The seal is registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office as a trademark under registration number 2773337. A special seal was developed for the college&#x27;s bicentennial celebration in 2013.

===Alma mater===
Colby&#x27;s alma mater is &quot;Hail, Colby, Hail.&quot; The lyrics to the song were written by Karl R. Kennison of the class of 1906. It is sung to the tune of &quot;O Canada.&quot; In 1979, the second line was changed from &quot;thy sons from far and near&quot; to &quot;thy people far and near.&quot;

<text>The bobcat (Lynx rufus), also known as the wildcat, bay lynx, or red lynx, is one of the four species within the medium-sized wild cat genus &quot;Lynx&quot;. Native to North America, it ranges from southern Canada through most of the contiguous United States to Oaxaca in Mexico. It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2002, due to its wide distribution and large population. Although it has been hunted extensively both for sport and fur, populations have proven stable, though declining in some areas.

It has distinctive black bars on its forelegs and a black-tipped, stubby (or &quot;bobbed&quot;) tail, from which it derives its name. It reaches a total length (including the tail) of up to . It is an adaptable predator inhabiting wooded areas, semidesert, urban edge, forest edge, and swampland environments. It remains in some of its original range, but populations are vulnerable to extirpation by coyotes and domestic animals. Though the bobcat prefers rabbits and hares, it hunts insects, chickens, geese and other birds, small rodents, and deer. Prey selection depends on location and habitat, season, and abundance. Like most cats, the bobcat is territorial and largely solitary, although with some overlap in home ranges. It uses several methods to mark its territorial boundaries, including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces. The bobcat breeds from winter into spring and has a gestation period of about two months.

Two subspecies are recognized: one east of the Great Plains, and the other west of the Great Plains. It is featured in some stories of the indigenous peoples of North and Central America, and in the folklore of European-descended inhabitants of the Americas.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
&quot;Felis rufa&quot; was the scientific name proposed by Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1777. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the following zoological specimens were described:

*&quot;Lynx floridanus&quot; proposed by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1817 was a greyish lynx with yellowish brown spots from Florida.
*&quot;Lynx fasciatus&quot; also proposed by Rafinesque in 1817 was a reddish brown lynx with a thick fur from the northwest coast.
* &quot;Lynx baileyi&quot; proposed by Clinton Hart Merriam in 1890 was a female lynx that was shot in the San Francisco Mountains.
* &quot;Lynx texensis&quot; proposed by Joel Asaph Allen in 1895 to replace the earlier name &quot;Lynx rufus var. maculatus&quot;.
* &quot;Lynx gigas&quot; proposed by Outram Bangs in 1897 was a skin of an adult male lynx shot near Bear River, Nova Scotia.
* &quot;Lynx rufus eremicus&quot; and &quot;Lynx rufus californicus&quot; proposed by Edgar Alexander Mearns in 1898 were skins and skulls of two adult lynxes killed in San Diego County, California.
* &quot;Lynx rufus peninsularis&quot; proposed by Oldfield Thomas in 1898 was a skull and a pale rufous skin of a male lynx from Baja California Peninsula.
* &quot;Lynx fasciatus pallescens&quot; proposed by Merriam in 1899, was a skin of a gray lynx that was killed near Trout Lake, Washington.
* &quot;Lynx ruffus escuinapae&quot; proposed by Allen in 1903 was a skull and a pale rufous skin of an adult female from Escuinapa Municipality in Mexico.

* &quot;Lynx rufus superiorensis&quot; by Randolph Lee Peterson and Stuart C. Downing in 1952 was a skeleton and skin of a male lynx killed near Port Arthur, Ontario.
* &quot;Lynx rufus oaxacensis&quot; proposed by George Goodwin in 1963 was based on three skulls and six skins of lynxes killed in the Mexican Tehuantepec District.

The validity of these subspecies was challenged in 1981 because of the minor differences between specimens from the various geographic regions in North America.

Since the revision of cat taxonomy in 2017, only two subspecies are recognized as valid taxa:
* &quot;L. r. rufus&quot; – east of the Great Plains 
* &quot;L. r. fasciatus&quot; – west of the Great Plains

=== Phylogeny ===
The genus &quot;Lynx&quot; shares a clade with the genera &quot;Puma&quot;, &quot;Prionailurus&quot; and &quot;Felis&quot; dated to ; &quot;Lynx&quot; diverged approximately .

The bobcat is thought to have evolved from the Eurasian lynx (&quot;L. lynx&quot;), which crossed into North America by way of the Bering Land Bridge during the Pleistocene, with progenitors arriving as early as 2.6 million years ago. It first appeared during the Irvingtonian stage around . The first bobcat wave moved into the southern portion of North America, which was soon cut off from the north by glaciers; the population evolved into the modern bobcat around 20,000 years ago. A second population arrived from Asia and settled in the north, developing into the modern Canada lynx (&quot;L. canadensis&quot;). Hybridization between the bobcat and the Canada lynx may sometimes occur.
The populations east and west of the Great Plains were probably separated during Pleistocene interglacial periods due to the aridification of the region.

==Description==
The bobcat resembles other species of the midsize genus &quot;Lynx&quot;, but is on average the smallest of the four. Its coat is variable, though generally tan to grayish-brown, with black streaks on the body and dark bars on the forelegs and tail. Its spotted patterning acts as camouflage. The ears are black-tipped and pointed, with short, black tufts. Generally, an off-white color is seen on the lips, chin, and underparts. Bobcats in the desert regions of the southwest have the lightest-colored coats, while those in the northern, forested regions are darkest. Kittens are born well-furred and already have their spots. A few melanistic bobcats have been sighted and captured in Florida, USA and New Brunswick, Canada. They appear black, but may still exhibit a spot pattern.

The face appears wide due to ruffs of extended hair beneath the ears. Bobcat eyes are yellow with round, black pupils. The nose of the bobcat is pinkish-red, and it has a base color of gray or yellowish- or brownish-red on its face, sides, and back. The pupils widen during nocturnal activity to maximize light reception. The bobcat has sharp hearing and vision, and a good sense of smell. It is an excellent climber and swims when it needs to, but normally avoids water.

The adult bobcat is long from the head to the base of its distinctive stubby tail, averaging ; the tail is long.
Its &quot;&quot; appearance gives the species its name.
An adult stands about at the shoulders.

Adult males can range in weight from , with an average of ; females at , with an average of . The largest bobcat accurately measured on record weighed , although unverified reports have them reaching . Furthermore, a June 20, 2012, report of a New Hampshire roadkill specimen listed the animal&#x27;s weight at . The largest-bodied bobcats were recorded in eastern Canada and northern New England, and the smallest in the southern Appalachian Mountains.
Consistent with Bergmann&#x27;s rule, the bobcat is larger in its northern range and in open habitats. A morphological size comparison study in the eastern United States found a divergence in the location of the largest male and female specimens, suggesting differing selection constraints for the sexes.
Skeletal muscles make up 58.5 % of the bobcat&#x27;s body weight. At birth, it weighs and is about in length. At the age of one year, it weighs about .

===Tracks===
Bobcat tracks show four toes without claw marks, due to their retractile claws. The tracks range in size from ; the average is about . When walking or trotting, the tracks are spaced roughly apart. The bobcat can make great strides when running, often from .

Like all cats, the bobcat &#x27;directly registers&#x27;, meaning its hind prints usually fall exactly on top of its fore prints. Bobcat tracks can be generally distinguished from feral or house cat tracks by their larger size: about versus .

==Distribution and habitat==
The bobcat is an adaptable species. It prefers woodlands—deciduous, coniferous, or mixed—but does not depend exclusively on the deep forest. It ranges from the humid swamps of Florida to desert lands of Texas or rugged mountain areas. It makes its home near agricultural areas, if rocky ledges, swamps, or forested tracts are present; its spotted coat serves as camouflage. The population of the bobcat depends primarily on the population of its prey; other principal factors in the selection of habitat type include protection from severe weather, availability of resting and den sites, dense cover for hunting and escape, and freedom from disturbance.

The bobcat&#x27;s range does not seem to be limited by human populations, but by availability of suitable habitat; only large, intensively cultivated tracts are unsuitable for the species. The animal may appear in back yards in &quot;urban edge&quot; environments, where human development intersects with natural habitats. If chased by a dog, it usually climbs up a tree.

The historical range of the bobcat was from southern Canada, throughout the United States, and as far south as the Mexican state of Oaxaca, and it still persists across much of this area. In the 20th century, it was thought to have lost territory in the US Midwest and parts of the Northeast, including southern Minnesota, eastern South Dakota, and much of Missouri, mostly due to habitat changes from modern agricultural practices. While thought to no longer exist in western New York and Pennsylvania, multiple confirmed sightings of bobcats (including dead specimens) have been recently reported in New York&#x27;s Southern Tier and in central New York, and a bobcat was captured in 2018 on a tourist boat in Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In addition, bobcat sightings have been confirmed in northern Indiana, and one was killed near Albion, Michigan, in 2008. In early March 2010, a bobcat was sighted (and later captured by animal control authorities) in a parking garage in downtown Houston. By 2010, bobcats appear to have recolonized many states, occurring in every state in the contiguous 48 except Delaware.

The bobcat population in Canada is limited due to both snow depth and the presence of the Canada lynx. The bobcat does not tolerate deep snow, and waits out heavy storms in sheltered areas; it lacks the large, padded feet of the Canada lynx and cannot support its weight on snow as efficiently. The bobcat is not entirely at a disadvantage where its range meets that of the larger felid: displacement of the Canada lynx by the aggressive bobcat has been observed where they interact in Nova Scotia, while the clearing of coniferous forests for agriculture has led to a northward retreat of the Canada lynx&#x27;s range to the advantage of the bobcat. In northern and central Mexico, the cat is found in dry scrubland and forests of pine and oak; its range ends at the tropical southern portion of the country.

==Behavior and ecology==
The bobcat is crepuscular, and is active mostly during twilight. It keeps on the move from three hours before sunset until about midnight, and then again from before dawn until three hours after sunrise. Each night, it moves from along its habitual route. This behavior may vary seasonally, as bobcats become more diurnal during fall and winter in response to the activity of their prey, which are more active during the day in colder weather.

===Social structure and home range===
Bobcat activities are confined to well-defined territories, which vary in size depending on the sex and the distribution of prey. The home range is marked with feces, urine scent, and by clawing prominent trees in the area. In its territory, the bobcat has numerous places of shelter, usually a main den, and several auxiliary shelters on the outer extent of its range, such as hollow logs, brush piles, thickets, or under rock ledges. Its den smells strongly of the bobcat.
The sizes of bobcats&#x27; home ranges vary significantly from . One study in Kansas found resident males to have ranges of roughly , and females less than half that area. Transient bobcats were found to have home ranges of and less well-defined home ranges. Kittens had the smallest range at about . Dispersal from the natal range is most pronounced with males.

Reports on seasonal variation in range size have been equivocal. One study found a large variation in male range sizes, from in summer up to in winter. Another found that female bobcats, especially those which were reproductively active, expanded their home range in winter, but that males merely shifted their range without expanding it, which was consistent with numerous earlier studies. Other research in various American states has shown little or no seasonal variation.

Like most felines, the bobcat is largely solitary, but ranges often overlap. Unusual for cats, males are more tolerant of overlap, while females rarely wander into others&#x27; ranges. Given their smaller range sizes, two or more females may reside within a male&#x27;s home range. When multiple territories overlap, a dominance hierarchy is often established, resulting in the exclusion of some transients from favored areas.

In line with widely differing estimates of home range size, population density figures diverge from one to 38 bobcats per in one survey. The average is estimated at one bobcat per . A link has been observed between population density and sex ratio. An unhunted population in California had a sex ratio of 2.1 males per female. When the density decreased, the sex ratio skewed to 0.86 males per female. Another study observed a similar ratio, and suggested the males may be better able to cope with the increased competition, and this helped limit reproduction until various factors lowered the density.

=== Hunting and diet ===

The bobcat is able to survive for long periods without food, but eats heavily when prey is abundant. During lean periods, it often preys on larger animals, which it can kill and return to feed on later. The bobcat hunts by stalking its prey and then ambushing with a short chase or pounce. Its preference is for mammals weighing about . Its main prey varies by region: in the eastern United States, it is the eastern cottontail and New England cottontail, and in the north, it is the snowshoe hare. When these prey species exist together, as in New England, they are the primary food sources of the bobcat. In the far south, the rabbits and hares are sometimes replaced by cotton rats as the primary food source. Birds up to the size of an adult trumpeter swan are also taken in ambushes while nesting, along with their fledglings and eggs. The bobcat is an opportunistic predator that, unlike the more specialized Canada lynx, readily varies its prey selection. Diet diversification positively correlates to a decline in numbers of the bobcat&#x27;s principal prey; the abundance of its main prey species is the main determinant of overall diet.

The bobcat hunts animals of different sizes, and adjusts its hunting techniques accordingly. It hunts in areas abundant in prey and waits lying or crouching for victims to wander close. It then pounces and grabs the prey with its sharp, retractable claws. For slightly larger animals, such as geese, ducks, rabbits and hares, it stalks from cover and waits until prey comes within before rushing in to attack. Less commonly, it feeds on larger animals, such as young ungulates, and other carnivores, such as primarily female fishers, gray foxes, American minks, American martens, skunks, raccoons, small dogs and domestic cats. It also hunts rodents such as squirrels, moles, muskrats, mice, but also birds, small sharks, and insects. Bobcats occasional hunt livestock and poultry. While larger species, such as cattle and horses, are not known to be attacked, bobcats do present a threat to smaller ruminants such as pigs, sheep and goats. According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service, bobcats killed 11,100 sheep in 2004, comprising 4.9% of all sheep predator deaths. However, some amount of bobcat predation may be misidentified, as bobcats have been known to scavenge on the remains of livestock kills by other animals.

It has been known to kill deer or pronghorn, and sometimes to hunt elk in western North America, especially in winter when smaller prey is scarce, or when deer populations become more abundant. One study in the Everglades showed a large majority of kills (33 of 39) were fawns. In Yellowstone a large number of kills (15 of 20) were elk calves, but prey up to eight times the bobcat&#x27;s weight could be successfully taken. It stalks the deer, often when the deer is lying down, then rushes in and grabs it by the neck before biting the throat, base of the skull, or chest. On the rare occasions a bobcat kills a deer, it eats its fill and then buries the carcass under snow or leaves, often returning to it several times to feed.

The bobcat prey base overlaps with that of other midsized predators of a similar ecological niche. Research in Maine has shown little evidence of competitive relationships between the bobcat and coyote or red fox; separation distances and territory overlap appeared random among simultaneously monitored animals. However, other studies have found bobcat populations may decrease in areas with high coyote populations, with the more social inclination of the canid giving them a possible competitive advantage. With the Canada lynx, however, the interspecific relationship affects distribution patterns; competitive exclusion by the bobcat is likely to have prevented any further southward expansion of the range of its felid relative.

===Reproduction and life cycle===

The average lifespan of the bobcat is seven years but rarely exceeds 10 years. The oldest wild bobcat on record was 16 years old, and the oldest captive bobcat lived to be 32.

Bobcats generally begin breeding by their second summer, though females may start as early as their first year. Sperm production begins each year by September or October, and the male is fertile into the summer. A dominant male travels with a female and mates with her several times, generally from winter until early spring; this varies by location, but most mating takes place during February and March. The pair may undertake a number of different behaviors, including bumping, chasing, and ambushing. Other males may be in attendance, but remain uninvolved. Once the male recognizes the female is receptive, he grasps her in the typical felid neck grip and mates with her. The female may later go on to mate with other males, and males generally mate with several females. During courtship, the bobcat&#x27;s vocalizations include screaming and hissing. Research in Texas revealed that establishing a home range is necessary for breeding; studied animals without a home range had no identified offspring. The female has an estrous cycle of 44 days, with the estrus lasting five to ten days. Bobcats remain reproductively active throughout their lives.

The female raises the young alone. One to six, but usually two to four, kittens are born in April or May, after roughly 60 to 70 days of gestation. Sometimes, a second litter is born as late as September. The female generally gives birth in an enclosed space, usually a small cave or hollow log. The young open their eyes by the ninth or tenth day. They start exploring their surroundings at four weeks and are weaned at about two months. Within three to five months, they begin to travel with their mother. They hunt by themselves by fall of their first year, and usually disperse shortly thereafter. In Michigan, however, they have been observed staying with their mother as late as the next spring.

===Predators===
The adult bobcat has relatively few predators. Rarely, however, it may be killed in interspecific conflict by several larger predators or fall prey to them. Cougars and gray wolves can kill adult bobcats, a behavior repeatedly observed in Yellowstone National Park. Coyotes have killed adult bobcats and kittens. At least one confirmed observation of a bobcat and an American black bear &quot;(Ursus americanus)&quot; fighting over a carcass is confirmed. Like other &quot;Lynx&quot; species, bobcats probably avoid encounters with bears, in part because they are likely to lose kills to them or may rarely be attacked by them. Bobcat remains have occasionally been found in the resting sites of male fishers. American alligators (&quot;Alligator mississippensis&quot;) have been filmed opportunistically preying on adult bobcats in the southeast United States. Golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;) have been reportedly observed preying on bobcats.
Kittens may be taken by several predators, including great horned owls, eagles, foxes, and bears, and other adult male bobcats. When prey populations are not abundant, fewer kittens are likely to reach adulthood. 

Diseases, accidents, hunters, automobiles, and starvation are the other leading causes of death. Juveniles show high mortality shortly after leaving their mothers, while still perfecting their hunting techniques. One study of 15 bobcats showed yearly survival rates for both sexes averaged 0.62, in line with other research suggesting rates of 0.56 to 0.67. Cannibalism has been reported; kittens may be taken when prey levels are low, but this is very rare and does not much influence the population.

The bobcat may have external parasites, mostly ticks and fleas, and often carries the parasites of its prey, especially those of rabbits and squirrels. Internal parasites (endoparasites) are especially common in bobcats. One study found an average infection rate of 52% from &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;, but with great regional variation. One mite in particular, &quot;Lynxacarus morlani&quot;, has to date been found only on the bobcat. Parasites&#x27; and diseases&#x27; role in the mortality of the bobcat is still unclear, but they may account for greater mortality than starvation, accidents, and predation.

==Conservation==
It is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which means it is not considered threatened with extinction, but that international trade must be closely monitored. The animal is regulated in all three of its range countries, and is found in a number of protected areas of the United States, its principal territory. Estimates from the US Fish and Wildlife Service placed bobcat numbers between 700,000 and 1,500,000 in the US in 1988, with increased range and population density suggesting even greater numbers in subsequent years; for these reasons, the U.S. has petitioned CITES to remove the cat from Appendix II. Populations in Canada and Mexico remain stable and healthy. It is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List, noting it is relatively widespread and abundant, but information from southern Mexico is poor.

The species is considered endangered in Ohio, Indiana, and New Jersey. It was removed from the threatened list of Illinois in 1999 and of Iowa in 2003. In Pennsylvania, limited hunting and trapping are once again allowed, after having been banned from 1970 to 1999. The bobcat also suffered population decline in New Jersey at the turn of the 19th century, mainly because of commercial and agricultural developments causing habitat fragmentation; by 1972, the bobcat was given full legal protection, and was listed as endangered in the state in 1991. The Mexican bobcat &quot;L. r. escuinipae&quot; was for a time considered endangered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, but was delisted in 2005. Between 2003 and 2011, a reduction in bobcat sightings in the Everglades by 87.5% has been attributed to predation by the invasive Burmese python.

The bobcat has long been valued both for fur and sport; it has been hunted and trapped by humans, but has maintained a high population, even in the southern United States, where it is extensively hunted. In the 1970s and 1980s, an unprecedented rise in price for bobcat fur caused further interest in hunting, but by the early 1990s, prices had dropped significantly. Regulated hunting still continues, with half of mortality of some populations being attributed to this cause. As a result, the rate of bobcat deaths is skewed in winter, when hunting season is generally open.

Urbanization can result in the fragmentation of contiguous natural landscapes into patchy habitat within an urban area. Animals that live in these fragmented areas often have reduced movement between the habitat patches, which can lead to reduced gene flow and pathogen transmission between patches. Animals such as the bobcat are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because of their large home ranges. A study in coastal Southern California has shown bobcat populations are affected by urbanization, creation of roads, and other developments. The populations may not be declining as much as predicted, but instead the connectivity of different populations is affected. This leads to a decrease in natural genetic diversity among bobcat populations. For bobcats, preserving open space in sufficient quantities and quality is necessary for population viability. Educating local residents about the animals is critical, as well, for conservation in urban areas.

In bobcats using urban habitats in California, the use of rodenticides has been linked to both secondary poisoning by consuming poisoned rats and mice, and to increased rates of severe mite infestation (known as notoedric mange), as an animal with a poison-weakened immune system is less capable of fighting off mange. Liver autopsies in California bobcats that have succumbed to notoedric mange have revealed chronic rodenticide exposure. Alternative rodent control measures such as vegetation control and use of traps have been suggested to alleviate this issue.

==Importance in human culture==
Stories featuring the bobcat, in many variations, are found in some Indigenous cultures of North America, with parallels in South America. A story from the Nez Perce, for instance, depicts the bobcat and coyote as opposed, antithetical beings. However, another version represents them with equality and identicality. Claude Lévi-Strauss argues that the former concept, that of twins representing opposites, is an inherent theme in New World mythologies, but that they are not equally balanced figures, representing an open-ended dualism rather than the symmetric duality of Old World cultures. The latter notion then, Lévi-Strauss suggests, is the result of regular contact between Europeans and native cultures. Additionally, the version found in the Nez Perce story is of much greater complexity, while the version of equality seems to have lost the tale&#x27;s original meaning.

In a Shawnee tale, the bobcat is outwitted by a rabbit, which gives rise to its spots. After trapping the rabbit in a tree, the bobcat is persuaded to build a fire, only to have the embers scattered on its fur, leaving it singed with dark brown spots. The Mohave people believed dreaming habitually of beings or objects would afford them their characteristics as supernatural powers. Dreaming of two deities, cougar and lynx, they thought, would grant them the superior hunting skills of other tribes. European-descended inhabitants of the Americas also admired the cat, both for its ferocity and its grace, and in the United States, it &quot;rests prominently in the anthology of ... national folklore.&quot;

Grave artifacts from dirt domes excavated in the 1980s along the Illinois River revealed a complete skeleton of a young bobcat along with a collar made of bone pendants and shell beads that had been buried by the Hopewell culture. The type and place of burial indicate a tamed and cherished pet or possible spiritual significance. The Hopewell normally buried their dogs, so the bones were initially identified as remains of a puppy, but dogs were usually buried close to the village and not in the mounds themselves. This is the only wild cat decorated burial on the archaeological record.

An inhabitant of Appalachia, &quot;Lynx rufus&quot; is immortalized (along with university founder Rufus Putnam) at Ohio University through its popular college mascot, Rufus the Bobcat.

<text>An umpire is an official in a variety of sports and competition, responsible for enforcing the rules of the sport, including sportsmanship decisions such as ejection.

The term derives from the Old French , , and , : (as evidenced in cricket, where dismissal decisions can only be made on appeal). shows up around 1350 before undergoing a linguistic shift known as false splitting. It was written in 1426–1427 as ; the &quot;n&quot; was lost with the &quot;a&quot; indefinite article becoming &quot;an&quot;. The earliest version without the &quot;n&quot; shows up as , a variant spelling in Middle English, circa 1440. The leading &quot;n&quot; became permanently attached to the article, changing it to around 1475.

The word was applied to the officials of many sports including baseball, association football (where it has been superseded by &quot;assistant-referee&quot;) and cricket (which still uses it).

== Field hockey ==

An umpire in field hockey is a person with the authority to make decisions on a hockey field in accordance with the laws of the game. Each match is controlled by two such umpires, where it is ty

== Cricket ==
In cricket, dismissal decisions can only be made on appeal by the players. Otherwise, on-field decisions, relevant to the rules and scoring and of the game, are handled by two on-field umpires, although an off-field third umpire may help with certain decisions. At the international level, the match referee is an off-field official who makes judgements concerning the reputable conduct of the game and hands out penalties for breaches of the ICC Cricket Code of Conduct.

== Baseball and softball ==
In baseball and softball, there is commonly a head umpire (also known as a plate umpire) who is in charge of calling balls and strikes from behind the plate, who is assisted by one, two, three, or five field umpires who make calls on their specific bases (or with five umpires the bases and the outfield). On any question, all umpires are equal.

== Football (Australian rules) ==
An umpire is an official in the sport of Australian rules football. Games are overseen by one to four field umpires, two to four boundary umpires, and two goal umpires.
== Lawn bowls ==
A lawn bowls match is presided over by a bowls umpire or technical official. In games where single players compete, a marker is required to direct play and assist players with questions relating to the position of their bowls.
== Netball ==
In the game of netball, the match at hand is presided over by two umpires, typically female, with a comprehensive knowledge of the rules. There are also two timekeepers and two scorekeepers who inform the umpires and players of time remaining and scores.
== Rowing ==
In a regatta an umpire is the on-the-water official appointed to enforce the rules of racing and to ensure safety. In some cases an umpire may be designated specifically as starter, or otherwise the umpire starts the race from a launch and follows it to its end, ensuring that crews follow their proper course. If no infringements occur, the result is decided by a judge or judges on the waterside who determine the finish order of the crews.
== Sailing ==
In match race and team racing, an umpire is an on-the-water referee appointed to directly enforce the Racing Rules of Sailing. An umpire is also used in fleet racing to enforce Racing Rule 42 which limits the use of kinetics to drive the boat rather than the wind. Umpires are rarely present during sailing races as decisions are normally referred to a jury-style protest committee after the race.
== Tennis ==
In tennis an umpire is an on-court official, while a referee is an off-court official.

== Badminton ==

In badminton, the umpire has set authority to call faults and lets. Umpires also keep score and respond to challenges requested by badminton players.

<doc id="171811" wikidata="Q2107009" url="?curid=171811" title="Planned Parenthood v. Casey">
<text>Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), was a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court upheld the right to have an abortion as established by the &quot;essential holding&quot; of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; (1973) and issued as its &quot;key judgment&quot; the restoration of the undue burden standard when evaluating state-imposed restrictions on that right. Both the essential holding of &quot;Roe&quot; and the key judgment of &quot;Casey&quot; were overturned by the Supreme Court in 2022, with its landmark decision in &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;.

The case arose from a challenge to five provisions of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982; among the provisions were requirements for a waiting period, spousal notice, and (for minors) parental consent prior to undergoing an abortion procedure. In a plurality opinion jointly written by associate justices Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter, the Supreme Court upheld the &quot;essential holding&quot; of &quot;Roe&quot;, which was that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution protected a woman&#x27;s right to have an abortion prior to fetal viability.

The Court overturned the &quot;Roe&quot; trimester framework in favor of a viability analysis, thereby allowing states to implement abortion restrictions that apply during the first trimester of pregnancy. In its &quot;key judgment,&quot; the Court overturned &quot;Roe&quot; strict scrutiny standard of review of a state&#x27;s abortion restrictions with the undue burden standard, under which abortion restrictions would be unconstitutional when they were enacted for &quot;the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.&quot; Applying this new standard of review, the Court upheld four provisions of the Pennsylvania law, but invalidated the requirement of spousal notification. Four justices wrote or joined opinions arguing that &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; should have been struck down, while two justices wrote opinions favoring the preservation of the higher standard of review for abortion restrictions.

==Background==
In &quot;Casey&quot;, the plaintiffs challenged five provisions of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982 authored by state Rep. Stephen F. Freind, arguing that the provisions were unconstitutional under &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. The Court in &quot;Roe&quot; was the first to establish abortion as a fundamental right protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The majority in &quot;Roe&quot; further held that women have a privacy interest protecting their right to abortion embedded in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The five provisions at issue in &quot;Casey&quot; are summarized below.
* § 3205&#x27;s informed consent — a woman seeking abortion had to give her informed consent prior to the procedure. The doctor had to provide her with specific information at least 24 hours before the procedure was to take place, including information about how the abortion could be detrimental to her health and about the availability of information about the fetus.
* § 3209&#x27;s spousal notice — a married woman seeking abortion had to sign a statement declaring that she had notified her husband prior to undergoing the procedure, unless certain exceptions applied.
* § 3206&#x27;s parental consent — minors had to get the informed consent of at least one parent or guardian prior to the abortion procedure. Alternatively, minors could seek judicial bypass in lieu of consent.
* § 3203&#x27;s medical emergency definition — defining a medical emergency as &quot;[t]hat condition, which, on the basis of the physician&#x27;s good faith clinical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.&quot;
* §§ 3207(b), 3214(a), and 3214(f)&#x27;s reporting requirements — certain reporting and record keeping mandates were imposed on facilities providing abortion services.

The case was a seminal one in the history of abortion decisions in the United States. It was the first case to provide an opportunity to overturn &quot;Roe&quot; since two liberal U.S. Associate Justices, William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall, had been replaced with the George H. W. Bush-appointed Justices David Souter and Clarence Thomas. Both were viewed, in comparison to their predecessors, as ostensible conservatives. This left the Court with eight Republican-appointed justices, five of whom had been appointed by Presidents Ronald Reagan or Bush, both of whom were well known for their opposition to &quot;Roe&quot;. Finally, the only remaining Democratic appointee was Justice Byron White, who had been one of the two dissenters from the original &quot;Roe&quot; decision and had stood by his dissent in his subsequent dissenting opinion in Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists saying, &quot;I continue to believe that this venture [the substantive due process right to abortion] has been fundamentally misguided since its inception&quot;. At this point, only two of the Justices were obvious supporters of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;: Harry Blackmun, the author of &quot;Roe&quot;, and John Paul Stevens, who had joined opinions specifically reaffirming &quot;Roe&quot; in &quot;City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health&quot; and &quot;Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists&quot;.

The case was argued by American Civil Liberties Union attorney Kathryn Kolbert for Planned Parenthood, with Linda J. Wharton serving as Co-Lead Counsel. Pennsylvania Attorney General, Ernie Preate, argued the case for the state, focusing mainly on how the law could be upheld without overturning Roe, though suggesting Roe be overturned as an alternative means of upholding the law. Upon reaching the Supreme Court, the United States joined the case as an &quot;amicus curiae&quot;, and U.S. Solicitor General, Ken Starr of the Bush Administration, defended the Act in part by urging the Court to overturn &quot;Roe&quot; as having been wrongly decided.

===District Court&#x27;s ruling===
The plaintiffs were five abortion clinics, a class of physicians who provided abortion services, and one physician representing himself independently. They filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to enjoin the state from enforcing the five provisions and have them declared facially unconstitutional. The District Court, after a three-day bench trial, held that all the provisions were unconstitutional and entered a permanent injunction against Pennsylvania&#x27;s enforcement of them.

===Third Circuit Court of Appeals decision===
The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, upholding all of the regulations except for the husband notification requirement. The Third Circuit concluded that the husband notification was unduly burdensome because it potentially exposed married women to spousal abuse, violence, and economic duress at the hands of their husbands. Then-Circuit Judge Samuel Alito sat on that three-judge appellate panel and dissented from the court&#x27;s invalidation of that requirement. Thirty-one years later, as a Supreme Court Justice, Alito wrote the opinion in &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;, which overturned &quot;Roe&quot; and &quot;Casey&quot;.

===Supreme Court&#x27;s consideration===
At the conference of the Justices two days after oral argument, Souter defied expectations, joining Justices Stevens, Blackmun, and Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, who had all dissented three years earlier in &quot;Webster v. Reproductive Health Services&quot; with regard to that plurality&#x27;s suggested reconsideration and narrowing of &quot;Roe&quot;. This resulted in a precarious five-Justice majority consisting of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Byron White, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas that favored upholding all five contested abortion restrictions and overturning &quot;Roe&quot;; however, Kennedy changed his mind shortly thereafter, and joined with fellow Reagan-Bush justices O&#x27;Connor and Souter to write a plurality opinion that would reaffirm &quot;Roe&quot;.

==Supreme Court&#x27;s opinions==
Except for the three opening sections of the O&#x27;Connor–Kennedy–Souter opinion, &quot;Casey&quot; was a divided judgment, as no other sections of any opinion were joined by a majority of justices. The plurality opinion jointly written by Justices O&#x27;Connor, Kennedy, and Souter was recognized as the principal opinion.

===O&#x27;Connor, Kennedy, and Souter plurality opinion===
In the 1992 case of &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot;, the authors of the plurality opinion abandoned &quot;Roe&#x27;s&quot; strict trimester framework but maintained its central holding that women have a right to have an abortion before viability. &quot;Roe&quot; had held that statutes regulating abortion must be subject to &quot;strict scrutiny&quot;—the traditional Supreme Court test for impositions upon fundamental Constitutional rights. &quot;Casey&quot; instead re-adopted the lower, undue burden standard for evaluating state abortion restrictions, but re-emphasized the right to abortion as grounded in the general sense of liberty and privacy protected under the constitution. The authors of the plurality opinion likewise noted the U.S. government&#x27;s previous challenges to &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and expounded on the concept of &quot;liberty.&quot;

====Upholding the &quot;essential holding&quot; in &quot;Roe&quot;====

The plurality opinion stated that it was upholding what it called the &quot;essential holding&quot; of &quot;Roe&quot;. The essential holding consisted of three parts: (1) Women had the right to have an abortion prior to viability and to do so without undue interference from the State; (2) the State could restrict the abortion procedure post-viability, so long as the law contained exceptions for pregnancies which endangered the woman&#x27;s life or health; and (3) the State had legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child. The plurality asserted that the fundamental right to abortion was grounded in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the plurality reiterated what the Court said in &quot;Eisenstadt v. Baird&quot;: &quot;If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.&quot;

====&quot;Stare decisis&quot; analysis====
The plurality&#x27;s opinion included a thorough discussion on the doctrine of &quot;stare decisis&quot; (respect of precedent), and provided a clear explanation for why the doctrine had to be applied in &quot;Casey&quot; with regards to &quot;Roe&quot;. The authors of the plurality opinion emphasized that &quot;stare decisis&quot; had to apply in &quot;Casey&quot; because the &quot;Roe&quot; rule had not been proven intolerable; the rule had become subject &quot;to a kind of reliance that would lend a special hardship to the consequences of overruling and add inequity to the cost of repudiation&quot;; the law had not developed in such a way around the rule that left the rule &quot;no more than a remnant of abandoned doctrine&quot;; and the facts had not changed, nor viewed differently, to &quot;rob the old rule of significant application or justification.&quot; The plurality acknowledged that it was important for the Court to stand by prior decisions, even those decisions some found unpopular, unless there was a change in the fundamental reasoning underpinning the previous decision. The authors of the plurality opinion, making a special note of the precedential value of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, and specifically how women&#x27;s lives were changed by that decision, stated,
The sum of the precedential enquiry to this point shows Roe&#x27;s underpinnings unweakened in any way affecting its central holding. While it has engendered disapproval, it has not been unworkable. An entire generation has come of age free to assume Roe&#x27;s concept of liberty in defining the capacity of women to act in society, and to make reproductive decisions; no erosion of principle going to liberty or personal autonomy has left Roe&#x27;s central holding a doctrinal remnant.
The authors of the plurality opinion also acknowledged the need for predictability and consistency in judicial decision making. For example,Where, in the performance of its judicial duties, the Court decides a case in such a way as to resolve the sort of intensely divisive controversy reflected in Roe and those rare, comparable cases, its decision has a dimension that the resolution of the normal case does not carry. It is the dimension present whenever the Court&#x27;s interpretation of the Constitution calls the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution.&quot;
The plurality went on to analyze past judgments refusing to apply the doctrine of stare decisis, such as &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. There, the authors of the plurality opinion explained, society&#x27;s rejection of the &quot;Separate but Equal&quot; concept was a legitimate reason for the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; court&#x27;s rejection of the &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; doctrine. Emphasizing the lack of need to overrule the essential holding of &quot;Roe&quot;, and the Court&#x27;s need to not be seen as overruling a prior decision merely because the individual members of the Court had changed, the authors of the plurality opinion stated,
Because neither the factual underpinnings of Roe&#x27;s central holding nor our understanding of it has changed (and because no other indication of weakened precedent has been shown), the Court could not pretend to be reexamining the prior law with any justification beyond a present doctrinal disposition to come out differently from the Court of 1973.
The plurality further emphasized that the Court would lack legitimacy if it frequently changed its Constitutional decisions, stating,
The Court must take care to speak and act in ways that allow people to accept its decisions on the terms the Court claims for them, as grounded truly in principle, not as compromises with social and political pressures having, as such, no bearing on the principled choices that the Court is obliged to make.
Since the O&#x27;Connor-Kennedy-Souter plurality overruled some portions of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; despite its emphasis on &quot;stare decisis&quot;, Chief Justice Rehnquist in dissent argued that this section was entirely &quot;obiter dicta&quot;. All these opening sections were joined by Justices Blackmun and Stevens for the majority. The remainder of the decision did not command a majority, but at least two other Justices concurred in judgment on each of the remaining points.

====Viability of the fetus====
Although it upheld the &quot;essential holding&quot; in &quot;Roe&quot;, and recognized that women had some constitutional liberty to terminate their pregnancies, the O&#x27;Connor–Kennedy–Souter plurality overturned the &quot;Roe&quot; trimester framework in favor of a viability analysis. The &quot;Roe&quot; trimester framework completely forbade states from regulating abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy, permitted regulations designed to protect a woman&#x27;s health in the second trimester, and permitted prohibitions on abortion during the third trimester (when the fetus becomes viable) under the justification of fetal protection, and so long as the life or health of the mother was not at risk. The plurality found that continuing advancements in medical technology had proven that a fetus could be considered viable at 23 or 24 weeks rather than at the 28 weeks previously understood by the Court in &quot;Roe&quot;. The plurality thus redrew the line of increasing state interest at viability because of increasing medical accuracy about when fetus viability takes place. Likewise, the authors of the plurality opinion felt that fetus viability was &quot;more workable&quot; than the trimester framework.
Under this new fetus viability framework, the plurality held that at the point of viability and subsequent to viability, the state could promote its interest in the &quot;potentiality of human life&quot; by regulating, or possibly proscribing, abortion &quot;except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.&quot; Prior to fetus viability, the plurality held, the State can show concern for fetal development, but it cannot pose an undue burden on a woman&#x27;s fundamental right to abortion. The plurality reasoned that the new pre- and post-viability line would still uphold the essential holding of &quot;Roe&quot;, which recognized both the woman&#x27;s constitutionally protected liberty, and the State&#x27;s &quot;important and legitimate interest in potential life.&quot;

====Undue burden standard====
In replacing the trimester framework with the viability framework, the plurality also replaced the strict scrutiny analysis under &quot;Roe&quot;, with the &quot;undue burden&quot; standard previously developed by O&#x27;Connor in her dissent in &quot;Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health&quot;. According to the dissenters in &quot;Akron&quot;, the undue burden standard had been the governing rule in Roe&#x27;s first decade. A legal restriction posing an undue burden is one that has &quot;the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.&quot; An undue burden is found even where a statute purports to further the interest of potential life or another valid state interest, if it places a substantial obstacle in the path of access to abortion. The Supreme Court in the 2016 case &quot;Whole Woman&#x27;s Health v. Hellerstedt&quot; clarified what the &#x27;undue burden&#x27; test requires: &quot;&quot;Casey&quot; requires courts to consider the burdens a law imposes on abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer.&quot; The Supreme Court further clarified in the 2020 &quot;June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo&quot; opinion written by Justice Stephen Breyer with respect to the undue burden standard: &quot;[T]his standard requires courts independently to review the legislative findings upon which an abortion-related statute rests and to weigh the law&#x27;s &quot;asserted benefits against the burdens&quot; it imposes on abortion access. 579 U.S., at ___(slip op., at 21) (citing &quot;Gonzales v. Carhart&quot;, 550 U. S. 124, 165 (2007)).&quot; In &quot;Whole Woman&#x27;s Health v. Hellerstedt&quot; the court described the undue burden standard in its overall context with these words:

In applying the new undue burden standard, the plurality overruled &quot;City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health&quot;, 462 U.S. 416 (1983) and &quot;Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&quot;, 476 U.S. 747 (1986), each of which applied &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; to abortion restrictions.

Applying this new standard to the challenged Pennsylvania Act, the plurality struck down the spousal notice requirement, finding that for many women, the statutory provision would impose a substantial obstacle in their path to receive an abortion. The plurality recognized that the provision gave too much power to husbands over their wives (&quot;a spousal notice requirement enables the husband to wield an effective veto over his wife&#x27;s decision&quot;), and could worsen situations of spousal and child abuse. In finding the provision unconstitutional, the authors of the plurality opinion clarified that the focus of the undue burden test is on the group &quot;for whom the law is a restriction, not the group for whom the law is irrelevant.&quot; Otherwise stated, courts should not focus on what portion of the population is affected by the legislation, but rather on the population the law would restrict. The plurality upheld the remaining contested regulations – the State&#x27;s informed consent and 24-hour waiting period, parental consent requirements, reporting requirements, and the &quot;medical emergencies&quot; definition – holding that none constituted an undue burden.

Notably, when the authors of the plurality discuss the right to privacy in the joint opinion, it is all within the context of a quotation or paraphrase from &quot;Roe&quot; or other previous cases. The authors of the plurality opinion do not, however, explicitly or implicitly state that they do not believe in a right to privacy, or that they do not support the use of privacy in &quot;Roe&quot; to justify the fundamental right to abortion. Justice Blackmun would not agree with an implication asserting otherwise, stating &quot;[t]he Court today reaffirms the long recognized rights of privacy and bodily integrity.&quot;

====Key judgment ====

Chief Justice John Roberts&#x27;s concurrence in the 2020 &quot;June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo&quot; case noted the key outcomes in &quot;Casey&quot;: &quot;The several restrictions that did not impose a substantial obstacle were constitutional, while the restriction that did impose a substantial obstacle was unconstitutional.&quot; Before an abortion regulation can be struck down as unconstitutional there must be a determination that this regulation imposes a substantial obstacle in light of the undue burden standard explained in the section above. In &quot;Casey&quot; &quot;the justices imposed a new standard to determine the validity of laws restricting abortions. The new standard asks whether a state abortion regulation has the purpose or effect of imposing an &quot;undue burden&quot;, which is defined as a &quot;substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.&quot; The key judgment of &quot;Casey&quot; can be summed up as follows: &quot;Under &quot;Casey&quot;, abortion regulations are valid so long as they do not pose a substantial obstacle and meet the threshold requirement of being &quot;reasonably related&quot; to a &quot;legitimate purpose.&quot; &quot;Id.&quot;, at 878; &quot;id.&quot;, at 882 (joint opinion).&quot;

===Concurrence/dissents===
Justices Harry Blackmun and John Paul Stevens, who both joined the plurality in part, also each filed opinions concurring in the Court&#x27;s judgment in part and dissenting in part. Chief Justice William Rehnquist filed an opinion concurring in the Court&#x27;s judgment in part and dissenting in part, which was joined by Justices Byron White, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas, none of whom joined any part of the plurality. Justice Scalia also filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part, which was also joined by Rehnquist, White, and Thomas.

====Rehnquist and Scalia, joined by White and Thomas====

Rehnquist and Scalia each joined the plurality in upholding the parental consent, informed consent, and waiting period laws. However, they dissented from the plurality&#x27;s decision to uphold &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and strike down the spousal notification law, contending that &quot;Roe&quot; was incorrectly decided. In his opinion, Chief Justice Rehnquist questioned the fundamental right to an abortion, the &quot;right to privacy&quot;, and the strict scrutiny application in &quot;Roe&quot;. He also questioned the new &quot;undue burden&quot; analysis under the plurality opinion, instead deciding that the proper analysis for the regulation of abortions was rational-basis.

In his opinion, Justice Scalia also argued for a rational-basis approach, finding that the Pennsylvania statute in its entirety was constitutional. He argued that abortion was not a &quot;protected&quot; liberty, and as such, the abortion liberty could be intruded upon by the State. To this end, Justice Scalia concluded this was so because an abortion right was not in the Constitution, and &quot;longstanding traditions of American society&quot; have allowed abortion to be legally proscribed. Rehnquist and Scalia joined each other&#x27;s concurrence/dissents. White and Thomas, who did not write their own opinions, joined in both.

====Stevens and Blackmun====

Justices Blackmun and Stevens wrote opinions in which they approved of the plurality&#x27;s preservation of &quot;Roe&quot; and rejection of the spousal notification law. They did not agree with the plurality&#x27;s decision to uphold the other three laws at issue.

Justice Stevens concurred in part and dissented in part. Justice Stevens joined the plurality&#x27;s preservation of &quot;Roe&quot; and rejection of the spousal notification law, but under his interpretation of the undue burden standard (&quot;[a] burden may be &#x27;undue&#x27; either because the burden is too severe or because it lacks a legitimate rational justification&quot;), he would have found the information requirements in §§ 3205(a)(2)(i)–(iii) and § 3205(a)(1)(ii), and the 24-hour waiting period in §§ 3205(a)(1)–(2) unconstitutional. Instead of applying an undue burden analysis, Justice Stevens would have preferred to apply the analyses in &quot;Akron&quot; and &quot;Thornburgh,&quot; two cases that had applied a strict scrutiny analysis, to reach the same conclusions. Justice Stevens also placed great emphasis on the fact that women had a right to bodily integrity, and a constitutionally protected liberty interest to decide matters of the &quot;highest privacy and the most personal nature.&quot; As such, Justice Stevens felt that a State should not be permitted to attempt to &quot;persuade the woman to choose childbirth over abortion&quot;; he felt this was too coercive and violated the woman&#x27;s decisional autonomy.

Justice Blackmun concurred in part, concurred in the judgment in part, and dissented in part. He joined the plurality&#x27;s preservation of &quot;Roe&quot; – of which he wrote the majority – and he, too, rejected the spousal notification law. Justice Blackmun, however, argued for a woman&#x27;s right to privacy and insisted, as he did in &quot;Roe&quot;, that all non-&quot;de-minimis&quot; abortion regulations were subject to strict scrutiny. Using such an analysis, Justice Blackmun argued that the content-based counseling, the 24-hour waiting period, informed parental consent, and the reporting regulations were unconstitutional. He also dissented from the plurality&#x27;s undue burden test, and instead found his trimester framework &quot;administrable&quot; and &quot;far less manipulable&quot;. Blackmun even went further in his opinion than Stevens, sharply attacking and criticizing the anti-&quot;Roe&quot; bloc of the Court.

==Supreme Court&#x27;s holdings overturned==

In May 2022, &quot;Politico&quot; obtained a leaked initial draft majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito suggesting that the Supreme Court was poised to overturn &quot;Casey&quot; along with &quot;Roe&quot; in a pending final decision on &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization.&quot; On June 24, 2022, the final opinion was issued, with the Court overturning the &quot;essential opinion&quot; in &quot;Roe&quot;, criticizing the &quot;Casey&quot; Court&#x27;s failure to address the deficiencies of the &quot;Roe&quot; decision and overturning the &quot;key judgment&quot; in &quot;Casey&quot;.

The dissenting opinion disputed the majority&#x27;s opinion that the &quot;undue burden&quot; standard was not workable, and criticized the majority for overturning precedent, holding that their reasoning was not sufficient to overrule &quot;Roe&quot; and &quot;Casey&quot;, which they described as a precedent about precedent, and warned that by the same reasoning many other rights would be under threat.

<text>Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that the Constitution of the United States protects the liberty of married couples to use contraceptives without government restriction. The case involved a Connecticut &quot;Little Comstock Act&quot; that prohibited any person from using &quot;any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception&quot;. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional, and that its effect was &quot;to deny disadvantaged citizens ... access to medical assistance and up-to-date information in respect to proper methods of birth control.&quot; By a vote of 7–2, the Supreme Court invalidated the law on the grounds that it violated the &quot;right to marital privacy&quot;, establishing the basis for the right to privacy with respect to intimate practices. This and other cases view the right to privacy as &quot;protected from governmental intrusion&quot;.

Although the U.S. Bill of Rights does not explicitly mention &quot;privacy&quot;, Justice William O. Douglas wrote for the majority, &quot;Would we allow the police to search the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives? The very idea is repulsive to the notions of privacy surrounding the marriage relationship.&quot; Justice Arthur Goldberg wrote a concurring opinion to clarify that the Ninth Amendment shows the framers&#x27; view that fundamental rights are protected outside of those listed in the first eight amendments, and that similarly, for purposes of what is incorporated by the 14th Amendment, there are fundamental rights outside those specified in those amendments, Justice John Marshall Harlan II wrote a concurring opinion arguing that privacy is protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, while Justice Byron White argued that Connecticut&#x27;s law failed the rational basis standard.

== Background ==
&quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; originated as a prosecution under the Connecticut Comstock Act of 1873. The law made it illegal to use &quot;any drug, medicinal article, or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception...&quot;. Violators could be &quot;... fined not less than fifty dollars or imprisoned not less than sixty days nor more than one year or be both fined and imprisoned&quot;.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, physicians in the United States largely avoided the publication of any material related to birth control, even when they often recommended or at least gave advice regarding it to their married patients. Then in 1914, Margaret Sanger openly challenged the public consensus against contraception. She influenced the Connecticut Birth Control League (CBCL) and helped to develop the eventual concept of the Planned Parenthood clinics.

The first Planned Parenthood clinic in Connecticut opened in 1935 in Hartford. It provided services to women who had no access to a gynecologist, including information about artificial contraception and other methods to plan the growth of their families. Several clinics were opened in Connecticut over the following years, including the Waterbury clinic that led to the legal dispute. In 1939, this clinic was compelled to enforce the 1879 anti-contraception law. This caught the attention of the CBCL leaders, who remarked on the importance of birth control for cases in which the lives of the patients depended upon it.

During the 1940s, two cases arose from the provision of contraception by the Waterbury clinic, leading to legal challenges to the constitutionality of the Comstock law, but these failed on technical grounds. In &quot;Tileston v. Ullman&quot; (1943), a doctor and mother challenged the law on the grounds that a ban on contraception could, in certain sexual situations, threaten the lives and well-being of patients. The U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the appeal on the grounds that the plaintiff lacked standing to sue on behalf of his patients. Yale School of Medicine gynecologist C. Lee Buxton and his patients brought a second challenge to the law in &quot;Poe v. Ullman&quot; (1961). The Supreme Court again dismissed the appeal, on the grounds that the case was not &quot;ripe&quot;: the plaintiffs had not been charged or threatened with prosecution, so there was no actual controversy for the Court to resolve.

The polemic around &quot;Poe&quot; led to the appeal in &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot;, primarily based on the dissent of Justice John Marshall Harlan II in &quot;Poe&quot;, one of the most cited dissents in Supreme Court history.

He argued, foremost, that the Supreme Court should have heard the case rather than dismissing it. Thereafter, he indicated his support for a broad interpretation of the due process clause. On the basis of this interpretation, Harlan concluded that the Connecticut statute violated the Constitution.

After &quot;Poe&quot; was handed down in June 1961, the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut (PPLC) decided to challenge the law again. Estelle Griswold served on the PPLC as executive director from 1954 to 1965. Struggling through legal battles against birth control restrictions in Connecticut, Griswold and PPLC made an initial effort to financially support women who wanted contraceptives to bus to cities in New York and Rhode Island. Griswold and Dr. Buxton (PPLC medical volunteer), opened a birth control clinic in New Haven, Connecticut, &quot;thus directly challeng[ing] the state law&quot;. The clinic opened on November 1, 1961, and that same day received its first ten patients and dozens of appointment requests from married women who wanted birth control advice and prescriptions. Less than two days after the fact, police officers arrived, to which Griswold explained in detail both the operations of the clinic and openly admitted to breaking state law. A week later, the detectives arrived with arrest warrants. Griswold and Buxton were arrested, tried in a one-day bench trial, found guilty, and fined $100 each. The conviction was upheld by the Appellate Division of the Circuit Court, and by the Connecticut Supreme Court.

== Supreme Court decision ==
On June 7, 1965, the Supreme Court issued a 7–2 decision in favor of Griswold that struck down Connecticut&#x27;s state law against contraceptives.

===Opinion of the Court===

Seven justices formed the majority and joined an opinion written by justice William O. Douglas. The Court held that the U.S. Constitution protects &quot;marital privacy&quot; as a fundamental constitutional right, but it rejected the notion it needed to identify only a singular source for the right in the Constitution&#x27;s text. The Court rejected the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution as the source of the marital privacy right, because at the time the Court still formally rejected the doctrine of substantive due process due to its association with the 1905 decision &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot;, and with economic problems, business affairs and social conditions rather than the intimate relationships of married persons and their physicians.

Instead of trying to justify the right to marital privacy under substantive due process, the Court said that the marital relationship is one &quot;lying within the zone of privacy governed by several fundamental constitutional guarantees&quot; and the opinion discusses various landmark cases where specific parts of the bill of rights have been held to cover areas that are not necessary included in the text of their own specific provisions within the Bill of Rights, such as how the right of association is deemed covered by the First, and other examples noted involved the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments. It referenced earlier cases where the Court had found personal liberties that were constitutionally protected despite not being specifically enumerated in the Constitution, such as the constitutional right to parental control over childrearing found in the early 20th century cases &quot;Meyer v. Nebraska&quot; (1923) and &quot;Pierce v. Society of Sisters&quot; (1925). The Court viewed marital privacy right&#x27;s implicit nature to be similar, and in a now well-known line Douglas used the metaphor of shined light and its shadows to describe it.

Reasoning that the provisions of the Bill of Rights created &quot;emanations&quot; of protection that created &quot;penumbras&quot; within which rights could still be covered even if not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution, Douglas wrote that the right to marital privacy fell within this protection. The Court concluded that Connecticut&#x27;s Comstock Law violated this right to privacy, and therefore was unconstitutional. Douglas reasoned that the right to marital privacy was &quot;older than the Bill of Rights&quot;, and ended the opinion with an impassioned appeal to the sanctity of marriage in the Anglo-American culture and common law tradition.
===Concurrences===
Justice Arthur Goldberg concurred with the Court and wrote a separate opinion to emphasize his view that the Ninth Amendmentwhich states that if the Constitution enumerates certain rights but does not enumerate others it does not mean that the other rights do not existwas sufficient authority on its own to support the Court&#x27;s finding of a fundamental constitutional right to marital privacy. Justice John Marshall Harlan II also concurred with the Court, and wrote a concurring opinion arguing that the right to privacy should be protected under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Byron White concurred only in the judgment, and wrote an opinion describing how he thought Connecticut&#x27;s law failed rational basis scrutiny, saying: &quot;I wholly fail to see how the ban on the use of contraceptives by married couples in any way reinforces the State&#x27;s ban on illicit sexual relationships.&quot;

===Dissents===
Justices Hugo Black and Potter Stewart dissented from the Court&#x27;s decision. Both justices&#x27; dissents argued that because the U.S. Constitution does not expressly mention privacy in any of its provisions, the Court had no basis to strike down Connecticut&#x27;s Comstock Law. Black&#x27;s dissent concluded: &quot;I get nowhere in this case by talk about a constitutional &#x27;right of privacy&#x27; as an emanation from one or more constitutional provisions. I like my privacy as well as the next one, but I am nevertheless compelled to admit that government has a right to invade it unless prohibited by some specific constitutional provision.&quot;

== Precedent for later cases ==
Later decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court extended the principles of &quot;Griswold&quot; beyond its particular facts.

===Right to birth control for unmarried couples, 1972===
&quot;Eisenstadt v. Baird&quot; (1972) extended Griswold&#x27;s holding to unmarried couples. The argument in &quot;Eisenstadt&quot; was that it was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to deny unmarried couples the right to use contraception when married couples did have that right (under &quot;Griswold&quot;). Writing for the majority, Justice Brennan wrote that Massachusetts could not enforce the law against married couples because of &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot;, so the law worked &quot;irrational discrimination&quot; if not extended to unmarried couples as well.

===Right to abortion for any woman, 1973===
The reasoning and language of both &quot;Griswold&quot; and &quot;Eisenstadt&quot; were cited in the concurring opinion by Associate Justice Potter Stewart in support of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, 410 U.S. 113 (1973). The decision in &quot;Roe&quot; struck down a Texas law that criminalized aiding a woman in getting an abortion. The Court ruled that this law was a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Abortion became legalized for any woman for any reason, up through the first trimester, with possible restrictions for maternal health in the second trimester (the midpoint of which is the approximate time of fetal viability). In the third trimester of pregnancy, abortion is potentially illegal with exception for the mother&#x27;s health, which the court defined broadly in &quot;Doe v. Bolton&quot;. On June 24, 2022, &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson&quot; overturned &quot;Roe&quot;, reversing the application of the Due Process Clause in the case of abortion and returning its regulation to state control under the Tenth Amendment.

===Right to contraception for juveniles at least 14 years of age, 1977===

In &quot;Carey v. Population Services International&quot; (1977) the U.S. Supreme Court held that it was unconstitutional to prohibit anyone other than a licensed pharmacist to distribute nonprescription contraceptives to persons 16 years of age or over, to prohibit the distribution of nonprescription contraceptives by any adult to minors under 16 years of age, and to prohibit anyone, including licensed pharmacists, to advertise or display contraceptives. The Court also held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not allow a state to intrude on an individual&#x27;s decisions on matters of procreation which is protected as privacy rights.

===Right to privacy in private sexual activity, 2003===
&quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; (2003) struck down a Texas sodomy law that prohibited certain forms of intimate sexual contact between members of the same sex. Without stating a standard of review in the majority opinion, the court overruled &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot; (1986), declaring that the &quot;Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual.&quot; Justice O&#x27;Connor, who wrote a concurring opinion, framed it as an issue of rational basis review. Justice Kennedy&#x27;s majority opinion, based on the liberty interest protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, stated that the Texas anti-sodomy statute touched &quot;upon the most private human conduct, sexual behavior, and in the most private of places, the home&quot;, and attempted to &quot;control a personal relationship that ... is within the liberty of persons to choose without being punished&quot;. Thus, the Court held that adults are entitled to participate in private, consensual sexual conduct. While the opinion in &quot;Lawrence&quot; was framed in terms of the right to liberty, Kennedy described the &quot;right to privacy&quot; found in &quot;Griswold&quot; as the &quot;most pertinent beginning point&quot; in the evolution of the concepts embodied in &quot;Lawrence.&quot;

===Right to same-sex marriage, 2015===
&quot;Griswold&quot; was also cited in a chain of cases that led the Supreme Court to legalize same-sex marriage in another landmark case, &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;.

===Right to abortion overturned, 2022===
On June 24, 2022, the majority opinion in &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; written by Justice Samuel Alito limited the right to privacy to exclude the right to an abortion. In Justice Clarence Thomas&#x27; concurrence, he argued, &quot;In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court&#x27;s substantive due process precedents, including &quot;Griswold&quot;, &quot;Lawrence&quot;, and &quot;Obergefell&quot;, ... Because any substantive due process decision is &#x27;demonstrably erroneous&#x27; ... we have a duty to &#x27;correct the error&#x27; established in those precedents,&quot; referring to decisions on contraception, sodomy, and same-sex marriage as future cases for the Supreme Court to reverse. Broadly, Associate Justice Thomas does not believe in substantive due process and has referred to it as &#x27;legal fiction&#x27;. In regards to unenumerated rights, the majority opinion also said, &quot;The abortion right is also critically different from any other right that this Court has held to fall within the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s protection of &#x27;liberty&#x27;.&quot;

The dissenting opinion criticized the majority for overturning precedents dating back to &quot;Griswold&quot;, and argued, &quot;And no one should be confident that this majority is done with its work. The right &quot;Roe&quot; and &quot;Casey&quot; recognized does not stand alone. To the contrary, the Court has linked it for decades to other settled freedoms involving bodily integrity, familial relationships, and procreation. Most obviously, the right to terminate a pregnancy arose straight out of the right to purchase and use contraception. In turn, those rights led, more recently, to rights of same-sex intimacy and marriage. They are all part of the same constitutional fabric, protecting autonomous decisionmaking over the most personal of life decisions ... So one of two things must be true. Either the majority does not really believe in its own reasoning. Or if it does, all rights that have no history stretching back to the mid-19th century are insecure. Either the mass of the majority&#x27;s opinion is hypocrisy, or additional constitutional rights are under threat. It is one or the other.&quot;

<doc id="171816" wikidata="Q1634176" url="?curid=171816" title="The Extended Phenotype">
<text>The Extended Phenotype is a 1982 book by the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, in which the author introduced a biological concept of the same name. The book&#x27;s main idea is that phenotype should not be &quot;limited&quot; to biological processes such as protein biosynthesis or tissue growth, but &quot;extended&quot; to include all effects that a gene has on its environment, inside or outside the body of the individual organism.

Dawkins considers &quot;The Extended Phenotype&quot; to be a sequel to &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; (1976) aimed at professional biologists, and as his principal contribution to evolutionary theory.

==Summary==

=== Genes as the unit of selection in evolution ===
The central thesis of &quot;The Extended Phenotype,&quot; and of its predecessor by the same author, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Selfish Gene&quot;, is that individual organisms are not the true units of natural selection. Instead, the gene — or the &#x27;active, germ-line replicator&#x27; — is the unit upon which the forces of evolutionary selection and adaptation act. It is genes that succeed or fail in evolution, meaning that they either succeed or fail in replicating themselves across multiple generations.

These replicators are not subject to natural selection directly, but indirectly through their &quot;phenotypical effects&quot;. These effects are all the effects that the gene (or replicator) has on the world at large, not just in the body of the organism in which it is contained. In taking as its starting point the gene as the unit of selection, &quot;The Extended Phenotype&quot; is a direct extension of Dawkins&#x27; first book, &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;.

=== Genes synthesise only proteins ===

Dawkins argues that the only thing that genes control directly is the synthesis of proteins; restricting the idea of the phenotype to apply only to the phenotypic expression of an organism&#x27;s genes &quot;in its own body&quot; is an arbitrary limitation that ignores the effect a gene may have on an organism&#x27;s environment through that organism&#x27;s behaviour.

=== Genes may affect more than the organism&#x27;s body ===

Dawkins proposes there are three forms of &quot;extended phenotype.&quot; The first is the capacity of animals to modify their environment using &quot;architectural constructions&quot;, for which Dawkins provides as examples caddis houses and beaver dams.

The second form is &quot;manipulation of other organisms:&quot; The morphology of a living organism, and possibly of that organism&#x27;s behaviour, may influence not just the fitness of the organism itself, but that of other living organisms as well. One example of this is &quot;parasite manipulation&quot;. This refers to the capacity, found in some parasite-host interactions, for the parasite to modify the behaviour of the host in a way that enhances the parasite&#x27;s own fitness. One well-known example of this second type of extended phenotype is the &quot;suicidal drowning of crickets&quot; infected by hairworm, a behaviour that is essential to the parasite&#x27;s reproductive cycle. Another example is seen in female mosquitoes carrying malaria parasites. The mosquitoes infected with the parasites whose preferred hosts are humans have been shown in a field experiment to be significantly more attracted to human breath and odours than uninfected mosquitoes when the parasites are at a point in their life cycle where they can infect a human target.

The third form of extended phenotype is &quot;action at a distance of the parasite on its host.&quot; A common example is the manipulation of host behaviour by cuckoo chicks, which elicit intensive feeding by the host birds. Here the cuckoo does not interact directly with the host (which could be meadow pipits, dunnocks or reed warblers). The relevant adaptation lies in the cuckoo producing eggs and chicks that resemble sufficiently those of the host species so that they are not immediately ejected from the nest. These behavioural modifications are not physically associated with individuals of the host species but influence the expression of its behavioural phenotype.

Dawkins summarizes these ideas in what he terms the &quot;Central Theorem of the Extended Phenotype:&quot;

===Gene-centred view of life===

In developing this argument, Dawkins aims to strengthen the case for a &quot;gene-centric &quot; view of the evolution of life forms, to the point where it is recognized that the organism itself needs to be explained. This is the challenge which he takes up in the final chapter entitled &quot;Rediscovering the Organism&quot;. The concept of extended phenotype has been generalized in an &quot;organism-centered&quot; view of evolution with the concept of niche construction, in the case where natural selection pressures can be modified by the organisms during the evolutionary process.

== Reception ==
A technical review of &quot;The Extended Phenotype&quot; in the &quot;Quarterly Review of Biology&quot; states that, it is an &quot;interesting and thought provoking book, once one gets to the last five chapters.&quot; In the reviewer&#x27;s opinion, the book poses interesting questions, such as &quot;What is the survival value of packaging life into discrete units called &#x27;organisms&#x27; even though the units of selection appear to be individual &#x27;replicators&#x27;?&quot; The reviewer states that no &quot;satisfactory answer is given&quot; to this question in the book, though Dawkins suggests that replicators that &quot;interact favorably to create &#x27;vehicles&#x27; (organisms) may be at an advantage over those that do not (Chapter 14).&quot; The reviewer takes issue with the first nine chapters as being essentially a defense of Dawkin&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;.

Another review in &quot;American Scientist&quot; praises the book for convincingly promoting the idea of replication as being central to the evolutionary process. However, in the reviewer&#x27;s opinion, &quot;its main theme - that the gene is the only unit of selection - results from incorrectly interpreting the constraints on organismal adaptation and from too narrow an interpretation of replication, a process of more general relevance than the author is willing to allow.&quot;

==Uses and limitations==
The concept of extended phenotype has provided a useful frame for subsequent scientific work. For example, research into the relationship between &quot;the bacterial flora of the gut and their mammalian hosts&quot; which &quot;has become a hot topic of late&quot; makes use of this concept.

Subsequent proponents expand the theory and posit that many organisms within an ecosystem can alter the selective pressures on all of them by modifying their environment in various ways. Dawkins himself asserted, &quot;Extended phenotypes are worthy of the name only if they are candidate adaptations for the benefit of alleles responsible for variations in them&quot;. As an illustration, one might ask: could an architect&#x27;s buildings be considered part of his or her extended phenotype, much as a beaver&#x27;s dam is part of its extended phenotype? Dawkins&#x27; answer is No: in humans, an &quot;architect&#x27;s specific alleles are neither more nor less likely to be selected based on the design of his or her latest building.&quot;

<text>Bobcat Company is an American-based manufacturer of farm and construction equipment. Its American headquarters is in West Fargo, North Dakota, formerly in Gwinner, North Dakota. Its European headquarters moved in 2017 from Waterloo, Belgium, to Dobříš, Czech Republic (where Bobcat operates one of its European manufacturing plants). It was a subsidiary of the Ingersoll Rand Company from 1995 until July 2007, when it was sold for US$4.9 billion to South Korean company Doosan Infracore.

The company sells skid steer loaders, compact excavators, side-by-sides, compact tractors, mowers, and other small hydraulic equipment under the Bobcat brand name. It is one of the few major manufacturing companies operating in North Dakota.

==History==
In the 1950s, Louis and Cyril Keller operated Keller Welding and Repair near Rothsay, Minnesota. In 1956, Eddie Velo, a turkey farmer in the area, described to the Kellers a need for a machine small enough to maneuver inside a pole barn and light enough to operate on its upper level. The brothers developed a small, three-wheeled design with a belt-driven transmission, and delivered it to Velo on February 4, 1957. Velo gave the Kellers full access to his operations, and after the Kellers learned of drawbacks with the belt-driven transmission, they developed and patented a more robust clutch-based transmission system in 1958. The new transmission became the basis of the Melroe M60 loader.

The Kellers&#x27; uncle, an equipment dealer for the Melroe Manufacturing Company based in Gwinner, North Dakota, suggested that Melroe market the machines, resulting in Melroe inviting the Kellers to exhibit at the 1958 Minnesota State Fair. Melroe introduced the four-wheeled M400 model &quot;Skid-Steer Loader&quot; in 1960, and began using &quot;Bobcat&quot; as a trade name for such products in 1962 on the 440-model loader. Les Melroe and advertising agent Lynn Bickett settled on the &quot;Bobcat&quot; name while exchanging name ideas during a drive between Minneapolis and Gwinner. Bickett and Sylvan Melroe developed the &quot;tough, quick, and agile&quot; slogan used in advertising the early loaders.

In 1969, Melroe Manufacturing Company was purchased by Clark Equipment Company which was then purchased by Ingersoll-Rand in 1995. In 2007, Ingersoll-Rand sold Clark Equipment Company to the Doosan Group of South Korea, along with the rest of its construction equipment group for US$4.9 billion. The Clark Equipment Company now does business as Bobcat Company. Bobcat Company owns worldwide trademark registrations for its &quot;Bobcat&quot; name.

On January 1, 2018, Doosan Infracore and Doosan Bobcat were separated into independent companies, ending a seven-year relationship. In July 2021, Doosan Infracore was acquired by Hyundai Heavy Industries, which paid approximately $722.45 million for a 30% controlling stake in the company. Doosan Infracore will become a subsidiary of the newly created Hyundai Genuine group. However, Bobcat remained a part of Doosan Group, as its majority shareholder has changed to Doosan Heavy Industries on July 1, 2021, before the sale of Doosan Infracore.

<doc id="171825" wikidata="Q6694973" url="?curid=171825" title="Luaka Bop">
<text>Luaka Bop is a New York–based record label founded by musician David Byrne, former lead singer and guitarist for the art rock–new wave band Talking Heads. What began with Byrne making cassettes of his favorite Tropicália tracks for his friends became a full-fledged record label in 1988 after Byrne received a solo artist deal from Warner Bros.

Since then, Luaka Bop has developed into a label known for bringing eclectic music to new audiences. Though initially affiliated with Warner Bros, Luaka Bop has been wholly independent since 2006. Often categorized as a “world music” label, Luaka Bop considers its own music to be mostly contemporary pop.

Luaka Bop has released full-length albums, EPs, and singles from artists such as Alice Coltrane, William Onyeabor, and Floating Points, as well as compilations covering a wide range of musical movements and styles. The label’s maiden release eventually became the seven-album Brazil Classics series, which surveys genres from samba to Tropicália, as well as individual artists. This was the first of a number of region- or genre-specific compilation series released by Luaka Bop.

Luaka Bop’s releases have frequently been well received by critics, with both compilations and releases of individual artists regularly featuring in best-of-year lists. The label has been highlighted for its “singular ability to (re)discover, celebrate, and legitimize the otherwise low-profile work of some of the world’s more eccentric musical figures.”

== Name and logo ==

Byrne took the phrase &quot;Luaka Bop&quot; from the inner packaging of a specialty tea which is sold in England. Luaka is the name of a tea importer. Their &quot;Broken Orange Pekoe&quot; is packaged in a silver foil block; when the sleeve is removed, it reveals a white label that reads &quot;Luaka BOP&quot;. Byrne found the phrase to be “strange, but musical”, a combination he liked.

The Luaka Bop logo design was conceived by David Byrne and illustrated by Tibor Kalman. According to Byrne:

== Musical philosophy ==
While often described as a “world music” label, Luaka Bop has no explicit musical focus. Asked about the original concept for the label, Byrne says “the initial concept was no concept”, going on to say “I’ve never had an artistic plan with this label—there are no guidelines as far as what we’re going to do or what kind of music it might be”.

In fact, the label has often tried to avoid the “world music” moniker and the changed perceptions that come with it. On Luaka Bop’s website, Byrne details this tension through the example of Zap Mama, who debuted on Luaka Bop as part of the Adventures in Afropea series:

Tibor Kalman designed the first two Brazil Classics albums, and several other designers from Kalman&#x27;s M&amp;Co. design firm have provided the label with distinctive album art.

== Compilation series ==

=== &quot;Brazil Classics&quot; ===
The Brazil Classics series began with Luaka Bop’s first-ever release, and has garnered both critical acclaim and commercial success. The series has grown to consist of the following records:

* Brazil Classics 1: Beleza Tropical (1989)
* Brazil Classics 2: O Samba (1989)
* Brazil Classics 3: Forro etc.: Music of the Brazilian Northeast (1991)
* Brazil Classics 4: The Best of Tom Zé (1990)
* Brazil Classics 5: The Return of Tom Zé: The Hips of Tradition (1992)
* Brazil Classics 6: Beleza Tropical 2: Novo! Mais! Melhor! (1998)
* Brazil Classics 7: In Pernambuco: New Sounds of the Brazilian Northeast (2008)

Luaka Bop has also released music by Brazilian artists outside of the Brazil Classics series, such as Tim Maia, Os Mutantes and Moreno Veloso.

=== &quot;Cuba Classics&quot; ===

* Cuba Classics 1: The Best of Silvio Rodriguez (1991)
* Cuba Classics 2: Dancing with the Enemy (1991)
* ¡Cuba Classics 3: Diablo al Infierno! (1992)

=== &quot;Asia Classics&quot; ===

* Asia Classics 1: The South Indian Film Music of Vijaya Anand: Dance Raja Dance (1992)
* Asia Classics 2: The Best of Shoukichi Kina: Peppermint Tea House (1994)

=== &quot;Adventures in Afropea&quot; ===
The Adventures in Afropea series signaled a slight shift, as the music here is grouped by a broad stylistic criterion (a fusion of African and European influences) as opposed to a purely geographic one.

* Adventures in Afropea 1: Zap Mama (1993)
* Adventures in Afropea 2: The Best of Djur Djura: Voice of Silence (1993)
* Adventures in Afropea 3: Telling Stories to the Sea (1995)

=== &quot;Afro-Peruvian Classics&quot; ===
The Afro-Peruvian Classics series continued the label’s shift towards more stylistically specific compilation albums, focusing on a single subgroup of Peruvian music.

* Afro-Peruvian Classics 1: The Soul of Black Peru (1995)

While the series still has only one entry, that record saw Luaka Bop begin its work with Susana Baca, who has since released six albums with the label.

=== &quot;World Psychedelic Classics&quot; ===
The World Psychedelic Classics series was the first from Luaka Bop to have no geographic aspect to it. The five entries in the series span decades and continents.

* World Psychedelic Classics 1: Everything Is Possible: The Best of Os Mutantes (1999)

World Psychedelic Classics 3 helped “inspire an industrious coterie of crate diggers and lead to an explosion of ‘70s funk from Nigeria and Ghana”, with other labels crediting it with influencing the look and sound of their later releases. It also featured the song “Better Change Your Mind” by William Onyeabor, which eventually led to the release of &quot;World Psychedelic Classics 5: Who Is William Onyeabor?&quot;

The popularity of Onyeabor’s music in these compilations led to an eventual Luaka Bop reissue of Onyeabor’s entire discography and the formation of the Atomic Bomb! Band, a “supergroup” dedicated to performing his music live. This was the first time Onyeabor’s music was played live, as he never performed himself.

<text>A skid loader, skid-steer loader (SSL), or skidsteer is any of a class of compact heavy equipment with lift arms that can attach to a wide variety of buckets and other labor-saving tools or attachments.

The wheels typically have no separate steering mechanism and hold a fixed straight alignment on the body of the machine. Turning is accomplished by differential steering, in which the left and right wheel pairs are operated at different speeds, and the machine turns by skidding or dragging its fixed-orientation wheels across the ground. Skid-steer loaders are capable of zero-radius turning, by driving one set of wheels forward while simultaneously driving the opposite set of wheels in reverse. This &quot;zero-turn&quot; capability (the machine can turn around within its own length) makes them extremely maneuverable and valuable for applications that require a compact, powerful and agile loader or tool carrier in confined-space work areas.

Like other front loaders, they can push material from one location to another, carry material in the bucket, load material into a truck or trailer and perform a variety of digging and grading operations.

==History==
The first three-wheeled, front-end loader was invented by brothers Cyril and Louis Keller in Rothsay, Minnesota, in 1957. The Kellers built the loader to help a farmer, Eddie Velo, mechanize the process of cleaning turkey manure from his barn. The light and compact machine, with its rear caster wheel, was able to turn around within its own length while performing the same tasks as a conventional front-end loader, hence its name.

The Melroe brothers, of Melroe Manufacturing Company in Gwinner, North Dakota, purchased the rights to the Keller loader in 1958 and hired the Kellers to continue refining their invention. As a result of this partnership, the M-200 Melroe self-propelled loader was introduced at the end of 1958. It featured two independent front-drive wheels and a rear caster wheel, a engine and a lift capacity. Two years later they replaced the caster wheel with a rear axle and introduced the M-400, the first four-wheel, true skid-steer loader. The M-440 was powered by a engine and had an rated operating capacity. Skid-steer development continued into the mid-1960s with the M600 loader. Melroe adopted the well-known Bobcat trademark in 1962.

By the late 1960s, competing heavy equipment manufacturers were selling machines of this form factor.

==Operation==

Skid-steer loaders are typically four-wheeled or tracked vehicles with the front and back wheels on each side mechanically linked together to turn at the same speed, and where the left-side drive wheels can be driven independently of the right-side drive wheels. This is accomplished by having two separate and independent transmissions; one for the left side wheels and one for the right side wheels. Earliest versions of skid steer loaders used forward and reverse clutch drives. Virtually all modern skid steers designed and built since the mid-1970s use two separate hydrostatic transmissions (one for the left side and one for the right side).

The differential steering, zero-turn capabilities and lack of visibility often exacerbated by carrying loads with these machines means that their safe operation requires the operator have a good field of vision, good hand eye coordination, manual dexterity and the ability to remember and perform multiple actions at once. Before allowing anyone, including adults, to operate a skid steer, they should be assessed on their ability to safely operate the machine and trained in its safe operation. In the US, it is illegal for youth under age 18 employed in non-agricultural jobs to operate a skid steer. For youth hired to work in agriculture, it is recommended they be at least 16 years old and have an adult assess their abilities using the Agricultural Youth Work Guidelines  before being allowed to operate a skid steer.

Another thing to consider are beacon lights and reverse signal alarms that offer a warning to co-workers about the skid steer’s movements. These alarms are not always standard equipment on all farm or landscape skid steer machines, depending on factors like the age of the machine. Use and continued maintenance of these alarms greatly reduce the risk of incidents involving running over and/or pinning co-workers between the machine and an obstacle.  Construction sites and their business contract requirements often call for landscapers to have operational skid steer reverse signal alarms and beacon lights. 

The extremely rigid frame and strong wheel bearings prevent the torsional forces caused by this dragging motion from damaging the machine. As with tracked treads, the high ground friction produced by skid steers can rip up soft or fragile road surfaces. They can be converted to low ground friction by using specially designed wheels such as the Mecanum wheel.

Skid-steer loaders are sometimes equipped with tracks instead of the wheels, and such a vehicle is known as a compact track loader.

Skid steer loaders, both wheel and track models, operate most efficiently when they are imbalanced – either the front wheels or the back wheels are more heavily loaded. When equipped with an empty bucket, skid steer loaders are all heavier in the rear and the rear wheels pivot in place while the front wheels slide around. When a bucket is fully loaded, the weight distribution reverses and the front wheels become significantly heavier than the rear wheels. When making a zero-turn while loaded, the front wheels pivot and the rear wheels slide.

Imbalanced operation reduces the amount of power required to turn the machine and minimizes tire wear. Skilled operators always try to keep the machine more heavily loaded on either the front or the rear of the machine. When the weight distribution is 50/50 (or close to it) neither the front set of wheels nor the rear set of wheels wants to pivot or slide and the machine starts to &quot;buck&quot; due to high friction, evenly divided between front and rear axles. Tire wear increases significantly in this condition.

Unlike in a conventional front loader, the lift arms in these machines are alongside the driver with the pivot points behind the driver&#x27;s shoulders. Because of the operator&#x27;s proximity to moving booms, early skid loaders were not as safe as conventional front loaders, particularly due to the lack of a rollover protection structure. Modern skid loaders have cabs, open or fully enclosed which can serve as rollover protective structures (ROPS) and falling object protective structures (FOPS). The ROPS, FOPS, side screens and operator restraints make up the “zone of protection” in a skid steer, and are designed to reduce the possibility of operator injury or death. The FOPS shields the operator&#x27;s cab from falling debris, and the ROPS shields the operator in the case of an overturn. The side screens prevent the operator from becoming wedged between the lift arms and the skid steer frame as well as from being struck by protrusions (such as limbs). The operator is secured in the operator seat when the seat belt or seat-bar restraint is utilized, keeping them within the zone of protection. Safety features and safe operation are important because skid steer loaders are hazardous when safety practices are not observed. Rollover incidents and being crushed by moving parts are the most common causes of serious injuries and death associated with skid steer loaders.

==Attachments==

The conventional bucket of many skid loaders can be replaced with a variety of specialized buckets or attachments, many powered by the loader&#x27;s hydraulic system. The list of attachments available is virtually endless. Some examples include Dura Graders, backhoe, hydraulic breaker, pallet forks, angle broom, sweeper, auger, mower, snow blower, stump grinder, tree spade, trencher, dumping hopper, pavement miller, ripper, tillers, grapple, tilt, roller, snow blade, wheel saw, cement mixer, and wood chipper machine.

Some models of skid steer now also have an automatic attachment changer mechanism. This allows a driver to change between a variety of terrain handling, shaping, and leveling tools without having to leave the machine, by using a hydraulic control mechanism to latch onto the attachments. Traditionally hydraulic supply lines to powered attachments may be routed so that the couplings are located near the cab, and the driver does not need to leave the machine to connect or disconnect those supply lines. Recently, manufacturers have also created automatic hydraulic connection systems that allow changing attachments without having to manually disconnect/connect hydraulic lines
== Loader-arm design ==

===Radial lift===

The original skid-steer loader arms were designed using a hinge near the top of the loader frame towers at the rear of the machine. When the loader arms were raised the mechanism would pivot the loader arm up into the air in an arc that would swing up over the top of the operator. This is known as a radial lift loader. This design is simple to manufacture and lower cost. Radial lift loaders start with the bucket close to the machine when the arms are fully down and start moving up and forward away from the machine as the arms are raised. This provides greater forward reach at mid-point in the lift for dumping at around four to five feet, but less stability at the middle of their lift arc (because the bucket is so much further forward). As the loader arms continue to raise past mid-height the bucket begins to move back closer to the machine and becomes more stable at full lift height, but also has far less forward reach at full height.

Radial lift machines are lower cost and tend to be preferred for users who do a lot of work at lower height of lift arms, such as digging and spreading materials at low heights. Radial lift designs have very good lift capacity/stability when the loader arms are all the way down and become less stable (lower lift capacity) as the arms reach mid-point and the bucket is furthest forward. Static stability increases as the arms continue to rise, but raised loads are inherently less stable and safe for all machine types. One downside of radial lift design is that when fully-raised the bucket is back closer to the machine, so it has relatively poor reach when trying to load trucks or hoppers or spreaders. In addition, the bucket is almost over the operator&#x27;s head and spillage over the back of the bucket can end up on top of the machine or in the operator&#x27;s lap. Another downside of radial lift machines is that the large frame towers to which the loader arms are attached tend to restrict an operator&#x27;s visibility to the rear and back corners of the machine. The radial arm is still the most common design and preferred by many users, but almost all manufacturers that started with radial lift designs began also producing &quot;vertical lift&quot; designs as well.

===Vertical lift===

&quot;Vertical lift&quot; designs use additional links and hinges on the loader arm, with the main pivot points towards the center or front of the machine. This allows the loader arm to have greater operating height and reach while retaining a compact design. There are no truly &quot;vertical lift&quot; designs in production. All loaders use multiple links (that all move in radial arcs) which aim to straighten the lift path of the bucket as it is raised. This allows close to vertical movement at points of the lift range, to keep the bucket forward of the operator&#x27;s cab, allowing safe dumping into tall containers or vehicles. Some designs have more arc in the lowest part of the lift arc while other designs have more arc near the top of the lift arc.

One downside of vertical lift designs is somewhat higher cost and complexity of manufacturing. Some vertical lift designs may also have reduced rear or side visibility when the arms are down low, but superior visibility as the arms are raised (especially if the design does not require a large rear frame tower). Most Vertical lift machines provide more constant stability as the arms are raised from fully-lowered to fully-raised position since the bucket (load) has a similar distance from the machine from bottom to top of the lift path. As a side benefit to constant stability, most vertical lift machines have larger bucket capacities and longer, flatter low-profile buckets that can carry more material per cycle and tend to provide smoother excavating and grading than short-lip buckets. Vertical lift designs have grown rapidly in popularity in the past thirty years and now make up a significant proportion of new skid loader sales.

====Loader arm safety precautions==== 
When controls are activated, the loader or lift arm attachments can move and crush individuals who are within the range of the machinery. To prevent injuries, it is strongly advisable for operators to not start or operate controls from outside of the cab. When in the operator’s seat, the operator should always fasten the seatbelt and lower the safety bar to stay securely in the cab and avoid being crushed. Operators should also ensure that any helpers or bystanders are clear of the machine before starting it.

==Applications==

A skid-steer loader can sometimes be used in place of a large excavator by digging a hole from the inside. This is especially true for digging swimming pools in a back yard where a large excavator cannot fit. The skid loader first digs a ramp leading to the edge of the desired excavation. It then uses the ramp to carry material out of the hole. The skid loader reshapes the ramp making it steeper and longer as the excavation deepens. This method is also useful for digging under a structure where overhead clearance does not allow for the boom of a large excavator, such as digging a basement under an existing house. Several companies make backhoe attachments for skid-steers. These are more effective for digging in a small area than the method above and can work in the same environments.

Other applications may consist of transporting raw material around a job site, either in buckets or using pallet forks. Rough terrain forklifts have very poor maneuverability; and smaller &quot;material handling&quot; forklifts have good maneuverability but poor traction. Skid steer loaders have very good maneuverability and traction but typically lower lift capacity than forklifts.

Skid steer loaders excel at snow removal, especially in smaller parking lots where maneuverability around existing cars, light poles, and curbs is an issue with larger snow plows. Skid steers also have the ability to actually remove the snow rather than just plowing it and pushing snow into a pile.

<text>Hornbeams are hardwood trees in the plant genus Carpinus in the family Betulaceae. Its species occur across much of the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.

== Common names ==
The common English name &quot;hornbeam&quot; derives from the hardness of the woods (likened to horn) and the Old English &quot;beam&quot;, &quot;tree&quot; (cognate with Dutch &quot;Boom&quot; and German &quot;Baum&quot;).

The American hornbeam is also occasionally known as blue-beech, ironwood, or musclewood, the first from the resemblance of the bark to that of the American beech &quot;Fagus grandifolia&quot;, the other two from the hardness of the wood and the muscled appearance of the trunk and limbs.

The botanical name for the genus, &quot;Carpinus&quot;, is the original Latin name for the European species, although some etymologists derive it from the Celtic for a yoke.

== Description ==
Hornbeams are small, slow-growing, understory trees with a natural, rounded form growing tall and wide; the exemplar species—the European hornbeam—reaches a maximum height of .

Leaves are deciduous, dark-green, alternate and simple with a coarsely-serrated margin, varying from in length. In autumn, leaves turn various shades of yellow, orange and red. Hornbeam saplings, stressed trees, and the lower branches of mature trees may exhibit marcescence—where leaves wither with autumn but abscission (leafdrop) is delayed until spring.

The smooth, gray trunk and larger branches of a mature tree exhibit a distinctive muscle-like fluting.

As with other members of the birch family, hornbeam flowers are wind-pollinated pendulous catkins, produced in spring. Male and female flowers are on separate catkins, but on the same tree (monoecious). Female flowers give way to distinctive clusters of winged seeds that somewhat resemble the hops-like seeds of ironwood.

The fruit is a small nut about long, held in a leafy bract; the bract may be either trilobed or simple oval, and is slightly asymmetrical. The asymmetry of the seedwing makes it spin as it falls, improving wind dispersal. The shape of the wing is important in the identification of different hornbeam species. Typically, 10–30 seeds are on each seed catkin.

== Taxonomy ==
Formerly some taxonomists segregated them with the genera &quot;Corylus&quot; (hazels) and &quot;Ostrya&quot; (hop-hornbeams) in a separate family, Corylaceae. Modern botanists place &quot;Carpinus&quot; in the subfamily Coryloideae of the family Betulaceae. Species of &quot;Carpinus&quot; are often grouped into two subgenera &quot;Carpinus&quot; subgenus &quot;Carpinus&quot; and &quot;Carpinus&quot; subgenus &quot; Distegicarpus&quot;.

Phylogentic analyses have shown that &quot;Ostrya&quot; likely evolved from a &quot;Carpinus&quot; ancestor somewhere in &quot;C.&quot; subg. &quot; Distegicarpus&quot; making &quot;Carpinus&quot; paraphyletic. The fossil record of the genus extends back to the Early Eocene, Ypresian of northwestern North America, with the species &quot;Carpinus perryae&quot; described from fossil fruits found in the Klondike Mountain Formation of Republic, Washington.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The 43 species occur across much of the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, with the greatest number of species in east Asia, particularly China. Only three species occur in Europe, only one in eastern North America, and one in Mesoamerica. &quot;Carpinus betulus&quot; can be found in Europe, Turkey and Ukraine.

== Ecology ==
Hornbeams are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including autumnal moth, common emerald, feathered thorn, walnut sphinx, Svensson&#x27;s copper underwing, and winter moth (recorded on European hornbeam) as well as the &quot;Coleophora&quot; case-bearers &quot;C. currucipennella&quot; and &quot;C. ostryae&quot;.

== Uses ==
Hornbeams yield a very hard timber, giving rise to the name &quot;ironwood&quot;. Dried heartwood billets are nearly white and are suitable for decorative use. For general carpentry, hornbeam is rarely used, partly due to the difficulty of working it.

The wood is used to construct carving boards, tool handles, handplane soles, coach wheels, piano actions, shoe lasts, and other products where a very tough, hard wood is required.

The wood can also be used as gear pegs in simple machines, including traditional windmills. It is sometimes coppiced to provide hardwood poles. It is also used in parquet flooring and for making chess pieces.

The style was popular in vaudeville and medicine shows and was associated with Beale Street, the main entertainment area in Memphis. 

W. C. Handy, the &quot;Father of the Blues&quot;, published the song &quot;The Memphis Blues&quot; in 1909 and this was the first blues to be written down. In lyrics, the phrase has been used to describe a depressed mood.

==History==
In addition to guitar-based blues, jug bands, such as Gus Cannon&#x27;s Jug Stompers and the Memphis Jug Band, were extremely popular practitioners of Memphis blues. The jug band style emphasized the danceable, syncopated rhythms of early jazz and a range of other folk styles. It was played on simple, sometimes homemade, instruments such as harmonicas, violins, mandolins, banjos, and guitars, backed by washboards, kazoo, guimbarde and jugs blown to supply the bass.

After World War II, as African Americans left the Mississippi Delta and other impoverished areas of the South for urban areas, many musicians gravitated to the blues scene in Memphis, changing the classic Memphis blues sound. Musicians such as Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Willie Nix, Ike Turner, and B. B. King performed on Beale Street and in West Memphis and recorded some of the classic electric blues, rhythm-and-blues and rock-and-roll records for labels such as Sam Phillips&#x27;s Sun Records. Sun recorded Howlin&#x27; Wolf (before he moved to Chicago), Willie Nix, Ike Turner, B. B. King and others. Electric Memphis blues featured &quot;explosive, distorted electric guitar work, thunderous drumming, and fierce, declamatory vocals.&quot; Musicians associated with Sun Records included Joe Hill Louis, Willie Johnson and Pat Hare.

<text>Thuja ( ) is a genus of coniferous tree or shrub in the Cupressaceae (cypress family). There are five species in the genus, two native to North America and three native to eastern Asia. The genus is monophyletic and sister to &quot;Thujopsis&quot;. Members are commonly known as arborvitaes (from the Latin term for &#x27;tree of life&#x27;), thujas or cedars.

==Description==

&quot;Thuja&quot; are evergreen trees growing from tall, with stringy-textured reddish-brown bark. The shoots are flat, with side shoots only in a single plane. The leaves are scale-like and long, except young seedlings in their first year, which have needle-like leaves. The scale leaves are arranged in alternating decussate pairs in four rows along the twigs. The male cones are small, inconspicuous, and are located at the tips of the twigs. The female cones start out similarly inconspicuous, but grow to about long at maturity when 6–8 months old; they have 6-12 overlapping, thin, leathery scales, each scale bearing 1–2 small seeds with a pair of narrow lateral wings.

The five species in the genus &quot;Thuja&quot; are small to large evergreen trees with flattened branchlets. The leaves are arranged in flattened fan shaped groupings with resin-glands, and oppositely grouped in 4 ranks. The mature leaves are different from younger leaves, with those on larger branchlets having sharp, erect, free apices. The leaves on flattened lateral branchlets are crowded into appressed groups and scale-like and the lateral pairs are keeled. With the exception of &quot;T. plicata&quot;, the lateral leaves are shorter than the facial leaves (Li &quot;et al.&quot; 2005). The solitary flowers are produced terminally. Pollen cones with 2-6 pairs of 2-4 pollen sacked sporophylls. Seed cones are ellipsoid, typically long, and mature and open the first year. The thin woody cone scales number from 4-6 pairs and are persistent and overlapping, with an oblong shape, they are also basifixed. The central 2-3 pairs of cone scales are fertile. The seed cones produce 1 to 3 seeds per scale, the seeds are lenticular in shape and equally 2 winged. Seedlings produce 2 cotyledons.


A hybrid between &quot;T. standishi&quot; and &quot;T. plicata&quot; has been named as the cultivar &quot;Thuja&quot; &#x27;Green Giant&#x27;.

Another very distinct and only distantly related species, formerly treated as &quot;Thuja orientalis&quot;, is now treated in a genus of its own, as &quot;Platycladus orientalis&quot;. The closest relatives of &quot;Thuja&quot; are &quot;Thujopsis dolabrata&quot;, distinct in its thicker foliage and stouter cones, and &quot;Tetraclinis articulata&quot; (Ancient Greek or , formerly classed in the genus and after which &quot;Thuja&quot; is named), distinct in its quadrangular foliage (not flattened) and cones with four thick, woody scales.

The genus &quot;Thuja&quot;, like many other forms of conifers, is represented by ancestral forms in Cretaceous rocks of northern Europe, and with the advance of time is found to migrate from northerly to more southerly regions, until during the Pliocene period, when it disappeared from Europe. &quot;Thuja&quot; is also known in the Miocene beds of the Dakotas.

==Taxonomy==
===Phylogeny===
===Species===
The five extant species are:

Species formerly placed in &quot;Thuja&quot; include:
* &quot;Austrocedrus chilensis&quot; (as &quot;T. chilensis&quot; )
* &quot;Callitris rhomboidea&quot; (as &quot;T. australis&quot; )
* &quot;Cupressus nootkatensis&quot; (as &quot;T. excelsa&quot; )
* &quot;Dacrycarpus imbricatus&quot; (as &quot;T. javanica&quot; )
* &quot;Glyptostrobus pensilis&quot; (as &quot;T. pensilis&quot; )
* &quot;Libocedrus plumosa&quot; (as &quot;T. doniana&quot; )
* &quot;Platycladus orientalis&quot; (as &quot;T. orientalis&quot; )
* &quot;Tamarix aphylla&quot; (as &quot;T. aphylla&quot; )
* &quot;Tetraclinis articulata&quot; (as &quot;T. articulata&quot; )
* &quot;Thujopsis dolabrata&quot; (as &quot;T. dolabrata&quot; )
* &quot;Widdringtonia nodiflora&quot; (as &quot;T. cupressoides&quot; )
and many more

The extant species &quot;Thuja sutchuenensis&quot; was believed to be extinct until 1999, when a small population was discovered in southeast China.

==Ecology==
&quot;Thuja&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including autumnal moth, the engrailed and juniper pug. The foliage is also readily eaten by deer, and where deer population density is high, can adversely affect the growth of young trees and the establishment of seedlings.

== Distribution ==
The genus &quot;Thuja&quot; has current populations in both North America and East Asia. &quot;T. plicata&quot; has wide distribution in the Pacific Northwest from Northern California to Alaska, reaching East into Idaho and central British Columbia. &quot;T. occidentalis&quot; has populations in the Northeastern United States, reaching north into Ontario and Quebec, with some distribution as far south as Tennessee.

&quot;T. standishii&quot; has populations in mountainous regions of Honshu and Shikoku islands in Japan, with no recorded population in the north of the country. &quot;T. koraiensis&quot; is native to both North and South Korea and has a small population in the Northern Chinese province of Jilin. The newly rediscovered species &quot;T. sutchuenensis&quot; has extremely limited distribution in the mountains of Chengkou county in southeastern China.

== Evolution and paleobiogeography ==
Current research suggests that &quot;Thuja&quot; originated in the Americas and migrated to East Asia via the Bering land bridge in the Miocene. Fossil records show that Thuja was significantly more widely distributed during the late Cretaceous and early Tertiary than we see today. The oldest known &quot;Thuja&quot; fossil is of &quot;T. polaris&quot; (an extinct species) from the Paleocene of Ellesmere Island in present-day Nunavut, Canada.

Other hypotheses of &quot;Thuja&quot; origin involved an East Asian origin, with the genus migrating twice; once east into North-western America and then west to the North-eastern America, but since no reliable fossil records of &quot;Thuja&quot; exist in either Western Asia or Europe, the possibility can be eliminated.

== Systematics ==
Thuja is a monophyletic genus that sits within the order Pinales in the Cupressaceae. &quot;Thuja&quot; is in the Cupressoid clade and is sister to the genus &quot;Thujopsis&quot;. The sister relationship between &quot;Thuja&quot; and &quot;Thujopsis&quot; is supported with 100% bootstrap support and 1.0 posterior probability.

Within the genus the taxonomy is in flux, but most recent research based on molecular analysis of plastomes in the genus &quot;Thuja&quot; showed evidence for a new grouping, with two sister clades: &quot;T. standishii&quot; and &quot;T. koraiensis&quot; together and &quot;T. occidentalis&quot; and &quot;T. sutchuenensis&quot; together, with &quot;T. plicata&quot; sister to &quot;T. occidentails&quot; and &quot;T. sutchuenensis.&quot; This newest grouping is hypothesized to be the result of reticulate evolution and hybridization within the genus.

==Uses of thuja==
They are widely grown as ornamental trees, and extensively used for hedges. A number of cultivars are grown and used in landscapes. Homeowners will sometimes plant them as privacy trees. The cultivar &#x27;Green Giant&#x27; is popular as a very vigorous hedging plant, growing up to 80 cm/year when young.

The wood is light, soft and aromatic. It can be easily split and resists decay. The wood has been used for many applications from making chests that repel moths to shingles. &quot;Thuja&quot; poles are also often used to make fence posts and rails. The wood of &quot;Thuja plicata&quot; is commonly used for guitar sound boards. Its combination of light weight and resistance to decay has also led to &quot;T. plicata&quot; being widely used for the construction of bee hives.

&quot;T. plicata&quot; is an important tree to the First Nations people of the Pacific Northwest and is sometimes called &quot;Canoe Tree&quot; because of its use as a material for Native American canoes.

Oil of &quot;Thuja&quot; contains the terpene thujone which has been studied for its GABA receptor antagonizing effects, with potentially lethal properties. Cedarwood oil and cedar leaf oil, which are derived from &quot;Thuja occidentalis&quot;, have different properties and uses.

The natives of Canada used the scaled leaves of &quot;Thuja occidentalis&quot; to make a tea that has been shown to contain 50 mg of vitamin C per 100 grams; this helped prevent and treat scurvy.

In the 19th century, &quot;Thuja&quot; was commonly used as an externally applied tincture or ointment for the treatment of warts, ringworm and thrush, and a local injection of the tincture was used for treating venereal warts.

A 2017 trial showed that its extract effectively killed both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

As with many Cupressaceae, &quot;Thuja&quot; can induce allergic reactions, including skin, eye and breathing problems.

<text>The Samoan Government is generally conservative and pro-Western, with a strong interest in regional political and economic issues. Samoa participated in a first round of negotiations with its Pacific Island neighbors for a regional trade agreement in August 2000. In January 2009, Samoa opened embassies in the Republic of Korea, China and Japan.

==Diplomatic relations==

==Samoa and the Commonwealth of Nations==

Western Samoa joined the Commonwealth of Nations in 1970.

==Regional integration==

Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi has pushed through a variety of legislation to increase links between Samoa and the Pacific regional powers of Australia and New Zealand. Under his leadership the country switched to driving on the left, decided to shift westwards across the International Date Line and adopted daylight saving time, and proposed the introduction of a common Pacific currency.

In late 2011, Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi initiated a meeting of Polynesian leaders which led, in November, to the formal launching of the Polynesian Leaders Group, a regional grouping intended to cooperate on a variety of issues including culture and language, education, responses to climate change, and trade and investment. The Group was in part a response to the Melanesian Spearhead Group.

== Explanation ==
As globalization integrates the economies of neighboring and of trading states, they are typically forced to trade off such rules as part of a common tax, tariff and trade regime, e.g. as defined by a free trade pact. Investment policy favoring local investors over global ones is typically discouraged in such pacts, and the idea of a separate investment policy rapidly becomes a fiction or fantasy, as real decisions reflect the real need for nations to compete for investment, even from their own local investors.

A strong and centralized system of the new global rules, made by many in the anti-globalization movement, is that guarantees are often available to foreign investors that are not available to local small investors, and that capital flight is encouraged by such free trade pacts.

== Policy drivers ==
Investment policy in many nations is tied to immigration policy, either due to a desire to prevent human capital flight by forcing investors to keep local assets in local investments, or by a desire to attract immigrants by offering passports in a safe haven nation, e.g. Canada, in exchange for a substantial investment in a business that will create jobs there. A frequent criticism of such joint immigration-investment policy is that they encourage organized crime by providing incentive for money-laundering and safe places for &quot;bosses&quot; to move to when the heat rises in their home country.

<text>Xenocrates (; ; c. 396/5314/3 BC) of Chalcedon was a Greek philosopher, mathematician, and leader (scholarch) of the Platonic Academy from 339/8 to 314/3 BC. His teachings followed those of Plato, which he attempted to define more closely, often with mathematical elements. He distinguished three forms of being: the sensible, the intelligible, and a third compounded of the two, to which correspond respectively, sense, intellect and opinion. He considered unity and duality to be gods which rule the universe, and the soul a self-moving number. God pervades all things, and there are daemonical powers, intermediate between the divine and the mortal, which consist in conditions of the soul. He held that mathematical objects and the Platonic Ideas are identical, unlike Plato who distinguished them. In ethics, he taught that virtue produces happiness, but external goods can minister to it and enable it to effect its purpose.

==Life==
Xenocrates was a native of Chalcedon. By the most probable calculation he was born 396/5 BC, and died 314/3 BC at the age of 82. His father was named Agathon () or Agathanor ().

Moving to Athens in early youth, he became the pupil of Aeschines Socraticus, but subsequently joined himself to Plato, whom he accompanied to Sicily in 361. Upon his master&#x27;s death, he paid a visit with Aristotle to Hermias of Atarneus. In 339/8 BC, Xenocrates succeeded Speusippus in the presidency of the school, defeating his competitors Menedemus of Pyrrha and Heraclides Ponticus by a few votes. On three occasions he was member of an Athenian legation, once to Philip, twice to Antipater.

Xenocrates resented the Macedonian influence then dominant at Athens. Soon after the death of Demosthenes (c. 322 BC), he declined the citizenship offered to him at the insistence of Phocion as a reward for his services in negotiating peace with Antipater after Athens&#x27; unsuccessful rebellion. The settlement was reached &quot;at the price of a constitutional change: thousands of poor Athenians were disenfranchised,&quot; and Xenocrates said &quot;that he did not want to become a citizen within a constitution he had struggled to prevent&quot;. Being unable to pay the tax levied upon resident aliens, he is said to have been saved only by the courage of the orator Lycurgus, or even to have been bought by Demetrius Phalereus, and then emancipated. In 314/3, he died from hitting his head, after tripping over a bronze pot in his house.

Xenocrates was succeeded as scholarch by Polemon, whom he had reclaimed from a life of profligacy. Besides Polemon, the statesman Phocion, Chaeron (tyrant of Pellene), the academic Crantor, the Stoic Zeno and Epicurus are said to have frequented his lectures.

Wanting in quickness of apprehension and natural grace he compensated by persevering and thorough-going industry, pure benevolence, purity of morals, unselfishness, and a moral earnestness, which compelled esteem and trust even from the Athenians of his own age.

Xenocrates adhered closely to the Platonist doctrine, and he is accounted the typical representative of the Old Academy. In his writings, which were numerous, he seems to have covered nearly the whole of the Academic program; but metaphysics and ethics were the subjects which principally engaged his thoughts. He is said to have made more explicit the division of philosophy into the three parts of Physics, Dialectic and Ethics.

==Writings==
With a comprehensive work on Dialectic () there were also separate treatises &quot;On Knowledge&quot;, &quot;On Knowledgibility&quot; (), &quot;On Divisions&quot; (), &quot;On Genera and Species&quot; (), &quot;On Ideas&quot; (), &quot;On the Opposite&quot; (), and others, to which probably the work &quot;On Mediate Thought&quot; () also belonged. Two works by Xenocrates on Physics are mentioned (), as are also books &quot;On the Gods&quot; (), &quot;On the Existent&quot; (), &quot;On the One&quot; (), &quot;On the Indefinite&quot; (), &quot;On the Soul&quot; (), &quot;On the Emotions&quot; () &quot;On Memory&quot; (), etc. In like manner, with the more general Ethical treatises &quot;On Happiness&quot; (), and &quot;On Virtue&quot; () there were connected separate books on individual Virtues, on the Voluntary, etc. His four books on Royalty he had addressed to Alexander (). Besides these he had written treatises &quot;On the State&quot; (), &quot;On the Power of Law&quot; (), etc., as well as upon Geometry, Arithmetic, and Astrology. Besides philosophical treatises, he wrote poetry () and paraenesis.

==Philosophy==

===Epistemology===
Xenocrates made a more definite division between the three departments of philosophy, than Speusippus, but at the same time abandoned Plato&#x27;s heuristic method of conducting through doubts (), and adopted instead a mode of bringing forward his doctrines in which they were developed dogmatically.

Xenocrates recognized three grades of cognition, each appropriated to a region of its own: knowledge, sensation, and opinion. He referred knowledge () to that essence which is the object of pure thought, and is not included in the phenomenal world; sensation () to that which passes into the world of phenomena; opinion () to that essence which is at once the object of sensuous perception, and, mathematically, of pure reason - the essence of heaven or the stars; so that he conceived of in a higher sense, and endeavored, more definitely than Plato, to exhibit mathematics as mediating between knowledge and sensuous perception. 

All three modes of apprehension partake of truth; but in what manner scientific perception () did so, we unfortunately do not learn. Even here Xenocrates&#x27;s preference for symbolic modes of sensualising or denoting appears: he connected the above three stages of knowledge with the three Fates: Atropos, Clotho, and Lachesis. We know nothing further about the mode in which Xenocrates carried out his dialectic, as it is probable that what was peculiar to Aristotelian logic did not remain unnoticed in it, for it can hardly be doubted that the division of the existent into the absolutely existent, and the relatively existent, attributed to Xenocrates, was opposed to the Aristotelian table of categories.

===Metaphysics===
We know from Plutarch that Xenocrates, if he did not explain the Platonic construction of the world-soul as Crantor after him did, nevertheless drew heavily on the &quot;Timaeus&quot;; and further that he was at the head of those who, regarding the universe as unoriginated and imperishable, looked upon the chronological succession in the Platonic theory as a form in which to denote the relations of conceptual succession. Plutarch unfortunately, does not give us any further details, and contented himself with describing the well-known assumption of Xenocrates, that the soul is a self-moving number. Probably we should connect with this the statement that Xenocrates called unity and duality (&quot;monas&quot; and &quot;duas&quot;) deities, and characterised the former as the first male existence, ruling in heaven, as father and Zeus, as uneven number and spirit; the latter as female, as the mother of the gods, and as the soul of the universe which reigns over the mutable world under heaven, or, as others have it, that he named the Zeus who ever remains like himself, governing in the sphere of the immutable, the highest; the one who rules over the mutable, sublunary world, the last, or outermost.

If, like other Platonists, he designated the material principle as undefined duality, the world-soul was probably described by him as the first defined duality, the conditioning or defining principle of every separate definitude in the sphere of the material and changeable, but not extending beyond it. He appears to have called it in the highest sense the individual soul, in a derivative sense a self-moving number, that is, the first number endowed with motion. To this world-soul Zeus, or the world-spirit, has entrusted - in what degree and in what extent, we do not learn - dominion over that which is liable to motion and change. The divine power of the world-soul is then again represented, in the different spheres of the universe, as infusing soul into the planets, Sun and Moon, - in a purer form, in the shape of Olympic gods. As a sublunary daemonical power (as Hera, Poseidon, Demeter), it dwells in the elements, and these daemonical natures, midway between gods and men, are related to them as the isosceles triangle is to the equilateral and the scalene. The divine world-soul which reigns over the whole domain of sublunary changes he appears to have designated as the last Zeus, the last divine activity.

It is not until we get to the sphere of the separate daemonical powers of nature that the opposition between good and evil begins, and the daemonical power is appeased by means of a stubbornness which it finds there congenial to it; the good daemonical power makes happy those in whom it takes up its abode, the bad ruins them; for eudaimonia is the indwelling of a good daemon, the opposite the indwelling of a bad one.

How Xenocrates tried to establish and connect scientifically these assumptions, which appear to be taken chiefly from his books on the nature of the gods, we do not learn, and can only discover the one fundamental idea at the basis of them, that all grades of existence are penetrated by divine power, and that this grows less and less energetic in proportion as it descends to the perishable and individual. Hence he also appears to have maintained that as far as consciousness extends, so far also extends an intuition of that all-ruling divine power, of which he represented even irrational animals as partaking. But neither the thick nor the thin, to the different combinations of which he appears to have tried to refer the various grades of material existence, were regarded by him as in themselves partaking of soul; doubtless because he referred them immediately to the divine activity, and was far from attempting to reconcile the duality of the &quot;principia&quot;, or to resolve them into an original unity. Hence too he was for proving the incorporeality of the soul by the fact that it is not nourished as the body is.

It is probable, that, after the example of Plato, he designated the divine &quot;principium&quot; as alone indivisible, and remaining like itself; the material, as the divisible, partaking of multiformity, and different, and that from the union of the two, or from the limitation of the unlimited by the absolute unity, he deduced number, and for that reason called the soul of the universe, like that of individual beings, a self-moving number, which, by virtue of its twofold root in the same and the different, shares equally in permanence and motion, and attains to consciousness by means of the reconciliation of this opposition.

Aristotle, in his &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, recognized amongst contemporary Platonists three principal views concerning the &quot;ideal&quot; numbers, and their relation to the ideas and to &quot;mathematical&quot; numbers:

#those who, like Plato, distinguished &quot;ideal&quot; and &quot;mathematical&quot; numbers;
#those who, like Xenocrates, identified &quot;ideal&quot; numbers with &quot;mathematical&quot; numbers
#those who, like Speusippus, postulated &quot;mathematical&quot; numbers only

Aristotle has much to say against the Xenocratean interpretation of the theory, and in particular points out that, if the ideal numbers are made up of arithmetical units, they not only cease to be principles, but also become subject to arithmetical operations.

In the derivation of things according to the series of the numbers he seems to have gone further than any of his predecessors. He approximated to the Pythagoreans in this, that (as is clear from his explanation of the soul) he regarded number as the conditioning principle of consciousness, and consequently of knowledge also; he thought it necessary, however, to supply what was wanting in the Pythagorean assumption by the more accurate definition, borrowed from Plato, that it is only insofar as number reconciles the opposition between the same and the different, and has raised itself to self-motion, that it is soul. We find a similar attempt at the supplementation of the Platonic doctrine in Xenocrates&#x27;s assumption of indivisible lines. In them he thought he had discovered what, according to Plato, God alone knows, and he among men who is loved by him, namely, the elements or principia of the Platonic triangles. He seems to have described them as first, original lines, and in a similar sense to have spoken of original plain figures and bodies, convinced that the &quot;principia&quot; of the existent should be sought not in the material, not in the divisible which attains to the condition of a phenomenon, but merely in the ideal definitude of form. He may very well, in accordance with this, have regarded the point as a merely subjectively admissible presupposition, and a passage of Aristotle respecting this assumption should perhaps be referred to him.

===Ethics===
The information on his Ethics is scanty. He tried to supplement the Platonic doctrine at various points, and at the same time to give it a more direct applicability to life. He distinguished from the good and the bad something which is neither good nor bad. Following the ideas of his Academic predecessors, he viewed the good as that which should be striven after for itself, that is, which has value in itself, while the bad is the opposite of this. Consequently, that which is neither good nor bad is what in itself is neither to be striven after nor to be avoided, but derives value or the opposite according as it serves as means for what is good or bad, or rather, is used by us for that purpose.
While, however, Xenocrates (and with him Speusippus and the other philosophers of the older Academy) would not accept that these intermediate things, such as health, beauty, fame, good fortune, etc. were valuable in themselves, he did not accept that they were absolutely worthless or indifferent. According, therefore, as what belongs to the intermediate region is adapted to bring about or to hinder the good, Xenocrates appears to have designated it as good or evil, probably with the proviso, that by misuse what is good might become evil, and vice versa, that by virtue, what is evil might become good.

Still he maintained that virtue alone is valuable in itself, and that the value of every thing else is conditional. According to this, happiness should coincide with the consciousness of virtue, though its reference to the relations of human life requires the additional condition, that it is only in the enjoyment of the good things and circumstances originally designed for it by nature that it attains to completion; to these good things, however, sensuous gratification does not belong. In this sense he on the one hand denoted (perfect) happiness as the possession of personal virtue, and the capabilities adapted to it, and therefore reckoned among its constituent elements, besides moral actions conditions and facilities, those movements and relations also without which external good things cannot be attained, and on the other hand did not allow that wisdom, understood as the science of first causes or intelligible essence, or as theoretical understanding, is by itself the true wisdom which should be striven after by people, and therefore seems to have regarded this human wisdom as at the same time exerted in investigating, defining, and applying. How decidedly he insisted not only on the recognition of the unconditional nature of moral excellence, but on morality of thought, is shown by his declaration, that it comes to the same thing whether one casts longing eyes, or sets one&#x27;s feet upon the property of others. His moral earnestness is also expressed in the warning that the ears of children should be guarded against the poison of immoral speeches.

===Mathematics===
Xenocrates is known to have written a book &quot;On Numbers&quot;, and a &quot;Theory of Numbers&quot;, besides books on geometry. Plutarch writes that Xenocrates once attempted to find the total number of syllables that could be made from the letters of the alphabet. According to Plutarch, Xenocrates result was 1,002,000,000,000 (a &quot;myriad-and-twenty times a myriad-myriad&quot;). This possibly represents the first instance that a combinatorial problem involving permutations was attempted. Xenocrates also supported the idea of &quot;indivisible lines&quot; (and magnitudes) in order to counter Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes.

<doc id="171851" wikidata="Q186170" url="?curid=171851" title="Doom metal">
<text>Doom metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much &quot;thicker&quot; or &quot;heavier&quot; sound than other heavy metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics are intended to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal. During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands such as Witchfinder General and Pagan Altar from England, American bands Pentagram, Saint Vitus, the Obsessed, Trouble, and Cirith Ungol, and Swedish band Candlemass defined doom metal as a distinct genre. Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble and Candlemass have been referred to as &quot;the Big Four of Doom Metal&quot;.

== Characteristics ==

=== Instrumentation ===
The electric guitar, bass guitar, and drum kit are the most common instruments used to play doom metal (although keyboards are sometimes used), but its structures are rooted in the same scales as in blues. Guitarists and bassists often down tune their instruments to very low notes and make use of large amounts of distortion, thus producing a very &quot;thick&quot; or &quot;heavy&quot; guitar tone, which is one of the defining characteristics of the genre. Along with the usual heavy metal compositional technique of guitars and bass playing the same riff in unison, this creates a loud and bass-heavy wall of sound. Another defining characteristic is the consistent focus on slow tempos, and minor tonality with much use of dissonance (especially in the form of the tritone), employing the usage of repetitive rhythms with little regard to harmonic progression and musical structure.

=== Vocals ===
Traditional doom metal vocalists favor clean vocals, which are often performed with a sense of despair, desperation, or pain; imitating the high-tone wails of Ozzy Osbourne (Black Sabbath), Frank Ferrara (Bang), Bobby Liebling (Pentagram), and Zeeb Parkes (Witchfinder General). So-called &quot;epic doom&quot; vocalists often take it a step further, singing in an operatic style. Doom metal bands influenced by other extreme metal genres often use growled or screamed vocals, as is the case of death-doom, black-doom, and funeral doom.

=== Lyrical themes ===
Lyrics in doom metal play a key role. Influenced by notable blues musicians like Robert Johnson and Son House, normally they are gloomy and pessimistic, including themes such as suffering, depression, fear, grief, dread, death, and anger. While some bands write lyrics in introspective and personal ways, others convey their themes using symbolism – which may be inspired by occult arts and literature.

Some doom metal bands use religious themes in their music. Trouble, one of the genre&#x27;s pioneers, were among the first to incorporate Christian imagery. Others have incorporated occult and pagan imagery. For many bands, the use of religious themes is for aesthetic and symbolic purposes only. Examples include lyrics/imagery about the Last Judgment to invoke dread, or the use of crucifixes and cross-shaped headstones to symbolize death.

Furthermore, some doom metal bands write lyrics about drugs or drug addiction. This is most common among stoner doom bands, who often describe hallucinogenic or psychedelic experiences.

== History ==
=== Origins (late 1960s–1970s) ===
The first traces of doom in rock music could be heard as far back as the Beatles&#x27; 1969 track &quot;I Want You (She&#x27;s So Heavy)&quot;. Black Sabbath are generally regarded as the progenitors of doom metal. Black Sabbath&#x27;s music is (in and of) itself stylistically rooted in blues, but with the deliberately doomy and loud guitar playing of Tony Iommi, and the then-uncommon dark and pessimistic lyrics and atmosphere, they set the standards of early heavy metal and inspired various doom metal bands. In the early 1970s, both Black Sabbath and Pentagram (also as side band &quot;Bedemon&quot;) composed and performed this heavy and dark music, which would in the 1980s begin to be known and referred to as &quot;doom metal&quot; by subsequent musicians, critics and fans. Joe Hasselvander, Pentagram&#x27;s drummer also cited bands like Black Widow, Toe Fat, Iron Claw, Night Sun, and Zior as pioneers of the doom metal sound.

Aside from Pentagram and Black Sabbath, other groups from the 1970s would heavily influence the genre&#x27;s development. Blue Cheer is often hailed as one of the first stoner metal bands. Through the use of loud amplifiers and guitar feedback, their debut &quot;Vincebus Eruptum&quot; created a template for other artists to follow. Uriah Heep released &quot;Demons and Wizards&quot; album include &quot;Easy Living&quot; in 1972. Though lacking the pessimistic lyrical content of their contemporaries, Welsh heavy metal band Budgie would also produce heavy songs which were amongst the loudest of their day, stylistically influencing various doom metal acts. Led Zeppelin&#x27;s No Quarter is considered as one of the earliest examples of a doom metal song made by a rock band. Early doom metal was also influenced by Japanese psychedelic rock albums, such as Kuni Kawachi &amp; Friends&#x27; &quot;Kirikyogen&quot; and Flower Travellin&#x27; Band&#x27;s &quot;Satori&quot;. Bang&#x27;s 1971 self-titled debut is considered an important forerunner to doom metal. Other notable groups include Sir Lord Baltimore, Buffalo, Necromandus, Lucifer&#x27;s Friend, and Leaf Hound.

=== Development (1980s) ===
During the early-mid-1980s, bands from England and the United States contributed much to the formation of doom metal as a distinct genre. In 1982, English pioneers Witchfinder General released their debut album &quot;Death Penalty&quot;. During 1984, two American pioneers also released their debuts—Saint Vitus released their eponymous album and Trouble released &quot;Psalm 9&quot;. That same year, American band Cirith Ungol (formed in 1971) released their second studio album, &quot;King of the Dead&quot;—regarded by many as an early influence on doom. The following year, American band Pentagram would go on to release their debut, &quot;Relentless&quot;. The Swedish Candlemass would also prove influential with their first record &quot;Epicus Doomicus Metallicus&quot; in 1986, from which epic doom metal takes its name.

Some doom metal bands were also influenced by the underground gothic rock and post-punk scene of the 1980s, showing similarities with the dark themes addressed through lyrics and the atmosphere both music styles deal with. A doom metal band like Mindrot was often described as a cross-over between death metal and gothic rock.

== Regional scenes ==
Like other extreme metal genres, doom metal also has regionally based scenes, with their own particular characteristics:

=== Finnish doom metal ===
In one of the greatest doom metal outputs, Finnish groups focus more on the depressive mood of the genre, evoking an intense grieving feeling. The bands play with very slow tempos and melodic tones, creating an atmosphere of darkness and melancholia. This scene was kick-started by the band Rigor Mortis (which, due to an older US band with the same name, changed their name to Spiritus Mortis), which originated in 1987. Notable bands include Reverend Bizarre, Minotauri, Dolorian, Shape of Despair, Thergothon, Skepticism, and Unholy.

=== Louisiana doom metal ===

Regarded as sludge metal&#x27;s birthplace by &quot;AllMusic&quot;, this scene originated in New Orleans in the late 1980s. The bands of this scene employ some punk influences, like harsh vocals, guitar distortion and downtuned sound. This scene was pioneered by Exhorder, who was the first band to combine doom metal with a punk-influenced metal sound. In the 90s, several sludge and stoner metal bands arose in the state, mainly influenced by bands like Black Sabbath and Melvins, also mixing their sound with genres like hardcore punk and Southern rock. Notable bands include Eyehategod, Down Exhorder, Crowbar, and Acid Bath.

=== Washington D.C. doom metal ===

This scene formed in the early 1970s and was kickstarted by Pentagram and the Obsessed. Various doom/stoner bands, mostly from Washington, D.C. and its metropolitan area on Maryland and Virginia (thus also being labelled &quot;Maryland doom sound&quot;), formed in this region being heavily influenced by early hard rock and heavy metal bands, like UFO, Blue Cheer, Black Sabbath, Uriah Heep and Sir Lord Baltimore. This scene is also known as &quot;Hellhound sound&quot; for being closely related to the late Hellhound Records, who signed with many important bands of the scene like Saint Vitus, Internal Void, Iron Man, Revelation, Wretched and Unorthodox. Other notable bands include Evoken, Spirit Caravan, Earthride, and the Hidden Hand.

=== Pacific Northwest doom metal ===
The Pacific Northwest region – primarily Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia – has been host to a growing scene of doom, sludge, and stoner metal since the 1990s. It is influenced by the geographical origin of grunge music and a sound pioneered in part by the Washington band Melvins. Common visual themes include the region&#x27;s cold, rainy, forested climate, and many bands utilize psychedelic imagery influenced by bands like Sleep, Karp and Harkonen. Musical styles often share crossover features with atmospheric/ambient black metal, drone metal, and post-metal as seen in Oregon&#x27;s YOB, Agalloch, Witch Mountain, and Red Fang; Washington&#x27;s Earth, and Sunn O))); and Vancouver&#x27;s Anciients, Astrakhan, and Aaron Turner project Sumac, among various others.

=== Palm Desert Scene===
Palm Desert, California, hosts a thriving desert rock and stoner metal scene, drawing heavy influences from psychedelia, blues and hardcore punk, often featuring distinctive repetitive drum beats, a propensity for free-form jamming, and &quot;trance-like&quot; or &quot;sludgy&quot; grooves. Because of their integration, the term &quot;stoner rock&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with the term &quot;desert rock&quot;. Notable bands include Kyuss, Queens of the Stone Age, Dali&#x27;s Llama, Slo Burn, and Brant Bjork.

== Stylistic divisions ==

=== Black-doom ===
Black-doom, also known as blackened doom, is a style that combines the slowness and thicker, bassier sound of doom metal with the shrieking vocals and heavily distorted guitar sound of black metal. Black-doom bands maintain the Satanic ideology associated with black metal, while melding it with moodier themes more related to doom metal, like depression, nihilism, and nature. They also use the slower pace of doom metal in order to emphasize the harsh atmosphere present in black metal. Examples of black-doom bands include Barathrum, Forgotten Tomb, Woods of Ypres, Deinonychus, Shining, Nortt, Bethlehem, early Katatonia, Tiamat, Dolorian, October Tide, and In the Woods...

==== Depressive suicidal black metal ====
Pioneered by black-doom bands like Ophthalamia, Katatonia, Bethlehem, Forgotten Tomb, and Shining, depressive suicidal black metal, also known as suicidal black metal, depressive black metal, or DSBM, is a style that melds the second wave-style of black metal with doom metal, with lyrics revolving around themes such as depression, self-harm, misanthrophy, suicide, and death. DSBM bands draw the lo-fi recording and highly distorted guitars of black metal, while employing the usage of acoustic instruments and non-distorted electric guitar&#x27;s timbres present in doom metal, interchanging the slower, doom-like, sections with faster tremolo picking. Vocals are usually high-pitched like in black metal, but lacking of energy, simulating feelings like hopelessness, desperation, and plea. The presence of one-man bands is more prominent in this genre compared to others. Examples of bands include Xasthur, Leviathan, Strid, Silencer, Make a Change... Kill Yourself, and I Shalt Become.

=== Blackened death-doom ===
Blackened death-doom is a genre that combines the slow tempos and monolithic drumming of doom metal, the complex and loud riffage of death metal and the shrieking vocals of black metal. Examples of blackened death-doom bands include Morast, Faustcoven, the Ruins of Beverast, Bolzer, Necros Christos, Harvest Gulgaltha, Dragged into Sunlight, Hands of Thieves, and Soulburn. Kim Kelly, journalist from Vice, has called Faustcoven as &quot;one of the finest bands to ever successfully meld black, death, and doom metal into a cohesive, legible whole.&quot;

=== Death-doom ===
Death-doom is a style that combines the slow tempos and pessimistic atmosphere of doom metal with the deep growling vocals and double-kick drumming of death metal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doom Metal Special: Doom/Death Terrorizer #142&quot;&gt;&quot;Doom Metal Special: Doom/Death&quot;, &quot;Terrorizer #142&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced mostly by the early work of Hellhammer and Celtic Frost, the style emerged during the late 1980s and gained a certain amount of popularity during the 1990s. Death-doom was pioneered by bands such as Winter, Disembowelment, Paradise Lost, Autopsy, Anathema, My Dying Bride and Novembers Doom.

==== Funeral doom ====

Funeral doom is a genre that crosses death-doom with funeral dirge music. It is played at an extremely slow tempo, and places an emphasis on evoking a sense of emptiness and despair. Typically, electric guitars are heavily distorted and dark ambient aspects such as keyboards or synthesizers are often used to create a &quot;dreamlike&quot; atmosphere. Vocals consist of mournful chants or growls and are often in the background. Funeral doom was pioneered by Mournful Congregation, Esoteric, Evoken, Funeral, Thergothon, and Skepticism.

=== Drone metal ===
Drone metal (also known as drone doom) is a style of doom metal that is largely defined by drones; notes or chords that are sustained and repeated throughout a piece of music. Typically, the electric guitar is performed with large amounts of reverb and feedback while lacking the presence of drums and vocals. Songs are often very long and lack beat or rhythm in the traditional sense. Drone metal is generally influenced by drone music, noise music, and minimalist music. The style emerged in the early 1990s and was pioneered by Earth, Boris, and Sunn O))).

=== Epic doom ===
Epic doom has a heavy classical influence. One of the main characteristics are the vocals; vocalists typically employ clean, operatic, and choral singing, accompanied by keyboarding and drumming performed in a bombastic fashion in order to evoke an &quot;epic&quot; sensation. Lyrics and imagery are typically inspired by fantasy or mythology. Examples of prominent epic doom bands include Candlemass, Solitude Aeturnus, Solstice, While Heaven Wept, and Doomsword.

=== Gothic-doom ===
Gothic-doom, also known as doom-gothic, is a style that combines more traditional elements of doom metal with gothic rock. Gothic-doom bands usually play at slow and mid-tempos and employ the usage of instruments that are more related to classical music, alongside traditional doom metal instruments, in order to create darker and meditative atmospheres. Doom-gothic lyrics combines the dramatic and romantic elements of gothic rock with the sorrowness and melancholy present in doom metal, while being more introspective and focused on personal experiences such as love, grief, irreparable loss, loss of faith, etc. Unlike in gothic metal and death-doom, gothic-doom bands prefer the use of cleaner vocals instead of employing death growls, although some of them employ harsher vocals occasionally, and avoid the usage of death metal-like riffage. Bands labelled as gothic-doom include Weeping Silence, the Foreshadowing, Grave Lines, Artrosis, Ava Inferi, Draconian, and Type O Negative.

=== Progressive doom ===
Progressive doom is a fusion genre that combines elements of progressive metal and doom metal. Notable bands include King Goat, Below the Sun, Sierra, Oceans of Slumber, and Green Carnation.

=== Sludge metal ===

Sludge metal (also known as sludge doom) is a style that combines doom metal and hardcore punk. Many sludge bands compose slow and heavy songs that contain brief hardcore passages. However, some bands emphasise fast tempos throughout their music. The string instruments are heavily distorted and are often played with large amounts of feedback to produce an abrasive, sludgy sound. Drumming is often performed in typical doom metal fashion, but drummers may employ hardcore d-beat or double-kick drumming during faster passages. Vocals are usually shouted or screamed, and lyrics often focus on suffering, drug abuse, politics and anger towards society. The style was pioneered in the late 1980s by the Melvins, and in the 1990s by bands such as Eyehategod, Crowbar, Buzzov*en, Acid Bath, and Grief.

==== Sludgecore ====
Sludgecore further combines sludge metal with hardcore punk, and possesses a slow pace, a low and dark pitch, and a grinding dirge-like feel. Bands regarded as sludgecore include Acid Bath, Eyehategod, Soilent Green, Black Sheep Wall, Admiral Angry, and The Abominable Iron Sloth. Crowbar mixed &quot;detuned, lethargic sludged-out metal with hardcore and southern elements&quot;.

=== Stoner metal ===
Stoner metal or stoner doom describes doom metal that incorporates psychedelic rock and acid rock elements. Stoner metal is often heavily distorted, groove-laden bass-heavy sound, making much use of guitar effects such as fuzz, phaser, or flanger. Stoner bands typically play in slow-to-mid tempo, employing the usage of melodic vocals and &quot;retro&quot; production. It was pioneered in the early–mid-1990s by bands such as Kyuss, Sleep, Acid King, Electric Wizard, Orange Goblin, and Sons of Otis.

==== Desert rock ====
Desert rock combines the psychedelic elements of stoner metal with hard rock characteristics. Bands of this style include Kyuss, Fu Manchu, Queens of the Stone Age, Earthlings? and Yawning Man.

=== Traditional doom ===
Influenced by 1970s and 1980s heavy metal, traditional doom metal bands more commonly use higher guitar tunings, and do not play as slowly as many other doom bands. Traditional doom bands typically play slow to mid-tempo songs with a thick and heavy sound with the electric bass following the melody line, and sometimes employ the usage of keyboards, although assuming a secondary role on traditional doom metal songs. Vocals are usually clean with the occasional growl or scream. The lyrics in traditional doom usually are eerie and dark like other doom metal divisions. Some bands who play traditional doom metal are Orodruin, Reverend Bizarre, Witchcraft, Saint Vitus, and Count Raven.

<text>Industrial policy is proactive government-led encouragement and development of specific strategic industries for the growth of all or part of the economy, especially in absence of sufficient private sector investments and participation. Historically, it has often focused on the manufacturing sector, militarily important sectors, or on fostering an advantage in new technologies. In industrial policy, the government takes measures &quot;aimed at improving the competitiveness and capabilities of domestic firms and promoting structural transformation&quot;. A country&#x27;s infrastructure (including transportation, telecommunications and energy industry) is a major enabler of industrial policy.

Industrial policies are interventionist measures typical of mixed economy countries. Many types of industrial policies contain common elements with other types of interventionist practices such as trade policy. Industrial policy is usually seen as separate from broader macroeconomic policies, such as tightening credit and taxing capital gains. Traditional examples of industrial policy include subsidizing export industries and import-substitution-industrialization (ISI), where trade barriers are temporarily imposed on some key sectors, such as manufacturing. By selectively protecting certain industries, these industries are given time to learn (learning by doing) and upgrade. Once competitive enough, these restrictions are lifted to expose the selected industries to the international market. More contemporary industrial policies include measures such as support for linkages between firms and support for upstream technologies.

Economists have debated the role of industrial policy in fostering industrialization and economic development. They have also debated concerns that industrial policy threatens free trade and international cooperation.

== History ==
The traditional arguments for industrial policies go back as far as the 18th century. Prominent early arguments in favor of selective protection of industries were contained in the 1791 &quot;Report on the Subject of Manufactures&quot; of US statesman Alexander Hamilton, as well as the work of German economist Friedrich List. List&#x27;s views on free trade were in explicit contradiction to those of Adam Smith, who, in &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;, said that &quot;the most advantageous method in which a landed nation can raise up artificers, manufacturers, and merchants of its own is to grant the most perfect freedom of trade to the artificers, manufacturers, and merchants of all other nations.&quot;

According to NYU historians Prince &amp; Taylor, &quot;The relationship between government and industry in the United States has never been a simple one, and the labels used in categorizing these relationships at different times are often misleading if not false. In the early nineteenth century, for example, it is quite clear that the laissez faire label is an inappropriate one.&quot; In the US, an industrial policy was explicitly presented for the first time by the Jimmy Carter administration in August 1980, but it was subsequently dismantled with the election of Ronald Reagan the following year.

Historically, there is a growing consensus that most developed countries, including United Kingdom, United States, Germany, and France, have intervened actively in their domestic economy through industrial policies. These early examples are followed by interventionist ISI strategies pursued in Latin American countries such as Brazil, Mexico or Argentina. More recently, the rapid growth of East Asian economies, or the newly industrialized countries (NICs), has also been associated with active industrial policies that selectively promoted manufacturing and facilitated technology transfer and industrial upgrading. The success of these state-directed industrialization strategies are often attributed to developmental states and strong bureaucracies such as the Japanese MITI. According to Princeton&#x27;s Atul Kohli, the reason Japanese colonies such as South Korea developed so rapidly and successfully was down to Japan exporting to its colonies the same centralised state development that it had used to develop itself. Precisely speaking, South Korea&#x27;s development can be explained by the fact that it followed the similar industrial policies that UK, US and Germany implemented, and South Korea adopted Export-Oriented Industrialization (EOI) policy from 1964 based on its own decision contrary to the Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) policy touted by international aid organizations and experts at that time. Many of these domestic policy choices, however, are now seen as detrimental to free trade and are hence limited by various international agreements such as WTO TRIMs or TRIPS. Instead, the recent focus for industrial policy has shifted towards the promotion of local business clusters and the integration into global value chains.

During the Reagan administration, an economic development initiative called Project Socrates was initiated to address US decline in ability to compete in world markets. Project Socrates, directed by Michael Sekora, resulted in a computer-based competitive strategy system that was made available to private industry and all other public and private institutions that impact economic growth, competitiveness and trade policy. A key objective of Socrates was to utilize advanced technology to enable US private institutions and public agencies to cooperate in the development and execution of competitive strategies without violating existing laws or compromising the spirit of &quot;free market&quot;. President Reagan was satisfied that this objective was fulfilled in the Socrates system. Through the advances of innovation age technology, Socrates would provide &quot;voluntary&quot; but &quot;systematic&quot; coordination of resources across multiple &quot;economic system&quot; institutions including industry clusters, financial service organizations, university research facilities and government economic planning agencies. While the view of one US President and the Socrates team was that technology made it virtually possible for both to exist simultaneously, the industrial policy vs. free market debate continued as later under the George H. W. Bush administration, Socrates was labeled as industrial policy and de-funded.

Following the Financial Crisis of 2007–08, many countries around the world – including the US, UK, Australia, Japan and most countries of the European Union – have adopted industry policies. However contemporary industry policy generally accepts globalization as a given, and focuses less on the decline of older industries, and more on the growth of emergent industries. It often involves the government working collaboratively with industry to respond to challenges and opportunities. China is a prominent case where the central and subnational governments participate in nearly all economic sectors and processes. Even though market mechanisms have gained importance, state guidance through state-directed investment and indicative planning plays a substantial role in the economy. In order to catch-up and even overtake industrialized countries technologically, China&#x27;s &quot;state activities even extend to efforts to prevent the dominance of foreign investors and technologies in areas considered to be of key significance such as the strategic industries and the new technologies&quot; including robotics and new energy vehicles.

== Criticism ==
Some criticize industrial policy based on the concept of government failure. Industrial policy is seen as harmful as governments lack the required information, capabilities, and incentives to successfully determine whether the benefits of promoting certain sectors above others exceeds the costs and in turn implement the policies. While the East Asian Tigers provided successful examples of heterodox interventions and protectionist industrial policies, industrial policies such as import-substitution-industrialization (ISI) have failed in many other regions such as Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa. Governments, in making decisions with regard to electoral or personal incentives, can be captured by vested interests, leading to industrial policies supporting local rent-seeking political elites while distorting the efficient allocation of resources by market forces.

== Debates on process ==
Despite criticism, there is a consensus in recent development theory that says state interventions may be necessary when market failures occur. Market failures often exist in the form of externalities and natural monopolies. Some economists argue that public action can boost certain development factors &quot;beyond what market forces on their own would generate.&quot; In practice, these interventions are often aimed at regulating networks, public infrastructure, R&amp;D or correcting information asymmetries. Many countries are now seeing a revival of industrial policy.

One question is which kinds of industrial policy are most effective in promoting economic development. For example, economists debate whether developing countries should focus on their comparative advantage by promoting mostly resource- and labor-intensive products and services, or invest in higher-productivity industries, which may only become competitive in the longer term.

Debate also surrounds the issue of whether government failures are more pervasive and severe than market failures. Some argue that the lower the government accountability and capabilities, the higher the risk of political capture of industrial policies, which may be economically more harmful than existing market failures.

Of particular relevance for developing countries are the conditions under which industrial policies may also contribute to poverty reduction, such as a focus on specific industries or the promotion of linkages between larger companies and smaller local enterprises.

== Effects ==
A study conducted by Réka Juhász investigated the economic effect of the Continental Blockade on the French empire. It concluded that the regions of the French empire which were more protected from trade with the United Kingdom had an higher increase in mechanized cotton spinning than other regions.

During the 2000s, China had implemented an industrial policy targeting its shipbuilding industry. The policy consisted in subsidizing entry, investment and production. It increased sectoral investment and entry rate by 270% and 200% respectively. It led to the entry of small and less productive firms and created excess capacity. The gain in producer or consumer surplus was lower than the cost of the subsidies. The policy was therefore welfare-reducing.

<text>Albert Hirschfeld (June 21, 1903 – January 20, 2003) was an American caricaturist best known for his black and white portraits of celebrities and Broadway stars.

==Early life and career==
Al Hirschfeld was born in 1903 in a two-story duplex apartment at 1313 Carr Street in St. Louis, Missouri. His father, Isaac, was a German Jewish traveling salesman, while his mother Rebecca was from a family of strict, Russian Orthodox Jews; his maternal grandparents refused to eat in his parents&#x27; non-kosher home. Hirschfeld described how the family would not permit bread in the house during Passover, and during this time the family would eat matzah and ham sandwiches.

He moved with his family to New York City in 1915, where he received art training at the Art Students League and the National Academy of Design.

In 1924, Hirschfeld traveled to Paris and London, where he studied painting, drawing and sculpture. When he returned to the United States, a friend, fabled Broadway press agent Richard Maney, showed one of Hirschfeld&#x27;s drawings to an editor at the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, which got Hirschfeld commissions for that newspaper before he moved to &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Hirschfeld&#x27;s style was unique, and he was considered to be one of the most important figures in contemporary drawing and caricature, having influenced countless artists, illustrators, and cartoonists. His caricatures were regularly drawings of pure line in black ink, for which he used a genuine crow quill.

Readers of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and other newspapers prior to the time they printed in color will be most familiar with the Hirschfeld drawings that are black ink on white illustration board. However, there is a whole body of Hirschfeld&#x27;s work in color. Hirschfeld&#x27;s full-color paintings were commissioned by many magazines, often as the cover. Examples are &quot;TV Guide&quot;, &quot;Life Magazine&quot;, &quot;American Mercury&quot;, &quot;Look Magazine&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, &quot;The New Masses&quot;, and &quot;Seventeen Magazine&quot;. He also illustrated many books in color, most notably among them &quot;Harlem As Seen By Hirschfeld&quot;, with text by William Saroyan. 

He was commissioned by CBS to illustrate a preview magazine featuring the network&#x27;s new TV programming in fall 1963. One of the programs was &quot;Candid Camera&quot;, and Hirschfeld&#x27;s caricature of the show&#x27;s host Allen Funt outraged Funt so much he threatened to leave the network if the magazine were issued. Hirschfeld prepared a slightly different likeness, perhaps more flattering, but he and the network pointed out to Funt that the artwork prepared for newspapers and some other print media had been long in preparation and it was too late to withdraw it. Funt relented but insisted that what could be changed would have to be. &quot;Newsweek&quot; ran a squib on the controversy.

===Broadway, film, and more===

Hirschfeld started young and continued drawing to the end of his life, thus chronicling nearly all of the major entertainment figures of the 20th century. During his eight-decade career, he gained fame by illustrating the actors, singers, and dancers of various Broadway plays, which would appear in advance in &quot;The New York Times&quot; to herald the play&#x27;s opening. Though the theater was his best-known field of interest, according to Hirschfeld&#x27;s art dealer Margo Feiden, he actually drew more for the movies than he did for live plays. &quot;By the ripe old age of 17, while his contemporaries were learning how to sharpen pencils, Hirschfeld became an art director at Selznick Pictures. He held the position for about four years, and then in 1924 Hirschfeld moved to Paris to work and lead the Bohemian life. Hirschfeld also grew a beard, necessitated by the exigencies of living in a cold water flat. This he retained for the next 75 years, presumably because &quot;you never know when your oil burner will go on the fritz.&quot;

In addition to Broadway and film, Hirschfeld also drew politicians, TV stars, and celebrities of all stripes from Cole Porter and the Nicholas Brothers to the cast of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. He also caricatured jazz musicians——Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Tommy Dorsey, Fats Waller, Lionel Hampton, Harry James, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Billie Holiday, and Ella Fitzgerald—and rockers The Beatles, Elvis Presley, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Jerry Garcia, and Mick Jagger. In 1977, he drew the cover of Aerosmith&#x27;s &quot;Draw the Line&quot; album.

Hirschfeld drew many original movie posters, including for Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s films, as well as &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939). The &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; segment in the Disney film &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; was inspired by his designs, and Hirschfeld became an artistic consultant for the segment; the segment&#x27;s director, Eric Goldberg, is a longtime fan of his work. Further evidence of Goldberg&#x27;s admiration for Hirschfeld can be found in Goldberg&#x27;s character design and animation of the genie in &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992). He was the subject of the Oscar-nominated documentary film &quot;The Line King: The Al Hirschfeld Story&quot; (1996).

===Nina===

In 1943, Hirschfeld married German actress Dolly Haas. They were married for more than 50 years and had a daughter, Nina.

Hirschfeld is known for hiding Nina&#x27;s name, written in capital letters (&quot;NINA&quot;), in most of the drawings he produced after her birth. The name would appear in a sleeve, in a hairdo, or somewhere in the background. As Margo Feiden described it, Hirschfeld engaged in the “harmless insanity,” as he called it, of hiding her name at least once in each of his drawings. The number of NINAs concealed is shown by the number written to the right of his signature. Generally, if no number is to be found, either NINA appears once or the drawing was completed before she was born.

For the first few months after Nina&#x27;s birth, Hirschfeld intended the hidden NINAs to appeal to his circle of friends. But what he hadn&#x27;t realized was that the population at large was beginning to spot them, too. When Hirschfeld thought that the gag was wearing thin among his friends and stopped concealing NINAs in his drawings, letters to &quot;The New York Times&quot; ranging from &quot;curious&quot; to &quot;furious&quot; pressured him to begin hiding them again. He said it was easier to hide the NINAs than it was to answer all the mail. From time to time he lamented that the gimmick had overshadowed his art.

In Hirschfeld&#x27;s book &quot;Show Business is No Business&quot;, Feiden recounts the following story to illustrate what Hirschfeld meant when he referred to the NINA counting as a harmless insanity: &quot;The NINA-counting mania was well illuminated when in 1973 an NYU student kept coming back to my Gallery to stare at the same drawing each day for more than a week. The drawing was Hirschfeld&#x27;s whimsical portrayal of New York&#x27;s Central Park. When curiosity finally got the best of me, I asked, &quot;″What is so riveting about that one drawing that keeps you here for hours, day after day?″&quot; She answered that she had found only 11 of 39 NINAs and would not give up until all were located. I replied that the &#x27;39&#x27; next to Hirschfeld&#x27;s signature was the year. Nina was born in 1945.&quot;

In his 1966 anthology &quot;The World of Hirschfeld&quot;, he included a drawing of Nina that he titled &quot;Nina&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. That drawing contained no NINAs. There were, however, two ALs and two DOLLYs (&quot;the names of her wayward parents&quot;).

In the &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; segment, the crimp of Duke the Builder&#x27;s toothpaste tube contained a NINA in tribute to Hirschfeld.

===Publications===

Al Hirschfeld famously contributed to &quot;The New York Times&quot; for more than seven decades. His work also appeared in &quot;The New York Herald Tribune&quot;, &quot;The Old World&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker Magazine&quot;, &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The American Mercury&quot;, &quot;TV Guide&quot;, &quot;Playbill&quot;, &quot;New York&quot; magazine, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

In 1941, Hyperion Books published &quot;Harlem As Seen By Hirschfeld&quot;, with text by William Saroyan.

Hirschfeld&#x27;s illustrations for the theater were gathered and published yearly in the books, &quot;The Best Plays of ...&quot; (for example, &quot;The Best Plays of 1958-1959&quot;).

Additional collections of Hirschfeld&#x27;s illustrations include: &quot;Manhattan Oasis&quot;, &quot;Show Business Is No Business&quot; (1951), &quot;American Theater&quot;, &quot;The American Theater as Seen by Al Hirschfeld&quot;, &quot;The World of Al Hirschfeld&quot; (1970), &quot;The Lively Years, 1920-1973&quot; with text by Brooks Atkinson (1973), &quot;The Entertainers&quot; (1977), &quot;Hirschfeld by Hirschfeld&quot; (1979), &quot;Hirschfeld’s World&quot; (1981), &quot;Show Business is No Business&quot; with preface and endnotes by Margo Feiden (1983), &quot;A Selection of Limited Edition Etchings and Lithographs&quot; with text by Margo Feiden (1983), &quot;Art and Recollections From Eight Decades&quot; (1991), &quot;Hirschfeld On Line&quot; (2000), &quot;Hirschfeld’s Hollywood&quot; (2001), &quot;Hirschfeld’s New York&quot; (2001), &quot;Hirschfeld’s Speakeasies of 1932&quot; with Introduction by Pete Hamill (2003), and &quot;Hirschfeld’s British Isles&quot; (2005).

Hirschfeld collaborated with humorist S. J. Perelman on several publications, including &quot;Westward Ha! Or, Around the World in 80 Clichés&quot;, a satirical look at the duo&#x27;s travels on assignment for &quot;Holiday&quot; magazine. In 1987, the United States Postal Service commissioned him to draw a series of postage stamps commemorating famous American comedians. The 1991 collection included drawings of Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, Edgar Bergen (with Charlie McCarthy), Jack Benny, Fanny Brice, Bud Abbott, and Lou Costello. He followed that with a collection of silent film stars including Rudolph Valentino, ZaSu Pitts and Buster Keaton. The Postal Service allowed him to include Nina&#x27;s name in his drawings, waiving its own rule forbidding hidden messages in United States stamp designs.

Hirschfeld expanded his audience by contributing to Patrick F. McManus&#x27; humor column in &quot;Outdoor Life&quot; magazine for a number of years.

===Collections and tributes===

Permanent collections of Hirschfeld&#x27;s work can be found at a variety of institutions including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, and the New York Public Library in New York, Harvard University in Cambridge, and the Harry Ransom Center in Austin, Texas.

Hirschfeld was the recipient of two lifetime achievement Tony Awards. On June 21, 2003, the Martin Beck Theatre on Broadway was renamed the Al Hirschfeld Theatre. Hirschfeld was also honored with a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

In 2002, Al Hirschfeld was awarded the National Medal of Arts. He was an Honorary Member of the Salmagundi Club. In 2012, Hirschfeld was added to the Jewish American Hall of Fame.

==Personal life and death==
He married chorus girl Florence Ruth Hobby in 1927; the couple separated in 1932 and divorced in 1943, the year he married Dolly Haas. Haas died in 1994, aged 84. They had one child, Nina.

In 1996, he married Louise Kerz, a theatre historian (b. 1936).

On January 20, 2003, Hirschfeld died of natural causes in his home at 122 East 95th Street in Manhattan. He was survived by Kerz and Nina.

<doc id="171860" wikidata="Q990589" url="?curid=171860" title="Menedemus">
<text>Menedemus of Eretria (; 345/44 – 261/60 BC) was a Greek philosopher and founder of the Eretrian school. He learned philosophy first in Athens, and then, with his friend Asclepiades, he subsequently studied under Stilpo and Phaedo of Elis. Nothing survives of his philosophical views apart from a few scattered remarks recorded by later writers.

==Life==
Menedemus was born at Eretria. He was a member of the noble Theopropidai family, which held significant religious authority but had become impoverished by Menedemus&#x27;s time. Like his father, Cleisthenes, he worked as a builder and tent maker. 

In the course of military conflicts (probably 323/322 BC, during the Lamian War) he was sent with a military expedition to Megara, from where he traveled to the Platonic Academy in Athens and resolved to devote himself to philosophy. At Megara he formed a lifelong friendship with Asclepiades of Phlius, with whom he toiled in the night that he might study philosophy by day. Later, Asclepiades and Menedemus went to Elis and became students of the philosophical descendants of Phaedo of Elis, namely Anchipylus and Moschus. He was subsequently a pupil first of Stilpo and then of, whose school he transferred to Eretria, by which name it was afterward known. Around 310 BC, Asclepiades and Menedemus visited Salamis in Cyprus, where they stayed at the court of King Nikocreon.

In addition to his philosophical work, he took a leading part in the political affairs of his city from the time of the Diadochi until his death. By about 300 BC, Menedemus began to assume a prominent position in the political life of his hometown on the island of Euboea. He is said to have campaigned for the independence of Eretria, which had lost much of its former importance at that time, and accompanied numerous embassies to other Greek cities. During this time, Menedemus grew close to Antigonus II Gonatas, the king of Macedonia who dominated Euboea. His friendship with Antigonus II Gonatas seems to have roused suspicion as to his loyalty, and he sought safety first in the temple of Amphiaraus at Oropus, and later with Antigonus, at whose court he is said to have died of grief. Other accounts say that he starved himself to death on failing to induce Antigonus to free his native city. 

==Relationships==
According to Diogenes Laertius, Menedemus married the mother of his older friend Asclepiades&#x27;s wife. When Asclepiades&#x27;s wife died, he is said to have left his wife to him and married someone richer with whom he had three daughters. His first wife continued to run the household. Menedemus was friends with the poets Aratos of Soloi, Lycophron of Chalcis, and Antagoras of Rhodes. Diogenes Laertius names Dionysius of Heraclea and Antigonus II Gonatas as possible students of Menedemus.

==Philosophy==
His philosophical views are known only in part. Athenaeus quotes Epicrates as stating that he was a Platonist, but other accounts credit him with having preferred Stilpo to Plato. Diogenes Laërtius says that he declined to identify the Good with the Useful and that he denied the value of the negative proposition on the ground that affirmation alone can express truth. In ethics we learn from Plutarch and from Cicero that he regarded Virtue as one, by whatever name it be called, and maintained that it is intellectual. Cicero&#x27;s evidence is less valuable because he always assumed that Menedemus was a follower of the Megarian school. Diogenes says that he left no writings, and the Eretrian school disappeared after a short and unobtrusive existence.

<text>Jean Rey (; c. 1583 – c. 1645) or (&quot;in English&quot;) John Rey was a French physician and chemist.

Born in Le Bugue, in the Périgord (Dordogne &quot;département&quot;), he studied medicine at the University of Montpellier. He practised medicine in his native town and corresponded with René Descartes and Marin Mersenne.

He discovered that the weight of lead and tin increases when they are calcinated, and attributed this phenomenon to the weight of air, which he believed to become denser when heated (&quot;Essays&quot;, 1630). He explained the greater weight of calcinated lead and tin by supposing that calcination involves the incorporation of air in the metal. This hypothesis would later be confirmed by Antoine Lavoisier, over a century later in 1789.

His discovery of the weight of air also made possible the invention of the barometer by Evangelista Torricelli in 1643. He also developed a device called a &quot;Thermoscope&quot;, a precursor of the thermometer.

Jean Rey died in Le Bugue, where he had lived all his life. The exact date of his death is disputed.

<doc id="171865" wikidata="Q396198" url="?curid=171865" title="Agricultural policy">
<text>Agricultural policy describes a set of laws relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products. Governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. Well designed agricultural policies use predetermined goals, objectives and pathways set by an individual or government for the purpose of achieving a specified outcome, for the benefit of the individual(s), society and the nations&#x27; economy at large. The goals could include issues such as biosecurity, food security, rural poverty reduction or increasing economic value through cash crop or improved food distribution or food processing.

Agricultural policies take into consideration the primary (production), secondary (such as food processing, and distribution) and tertiary processes (such as consumption and supply in agricultural products and supplies). Outcomes can involve, for example, a guaranteed supply level, price stability, product quality, product selection, land use or employment. Governments can use tools like rural development practices, agricultural extension, economic protections, agricultural subsidies or price controls to change the dynamics of agricultural production, or improve the consumer impacts of the production.

Agricultural policy has wide reaching primary and secondary effects. Agriculture has large impacts on climate change, estimated to be contributing 20–25% of global annual emissions as of 2010. Moreover, agricultural policy needs to account for a lot of shocks to the system: for example, agriculture is highly vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change, such as decreases in water access, geophysical processes such as ocean level rise and changing weather, and socioeconomic processes that affect farmers, many of whom are in subsistence economic conditions. In order for global climate change mitigation and adaptation to be effective a wide range of policies need to be implemented to reduce the risk of negative climate change impacts on agriculture and greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector.

==Agriculture policy concerns==
An example of the breadth and types of agriculture policy concerns can be found in the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics article &quot;Agricultural Economies of Australia and New Zealand&quot; which says that the major challenges and issues faced by their industrial agriculture industry are:
* marketing challenges and consumer tastes
* international trading environment (world market conditions, barriers to trade, quarantine and technical barriers, maintenance of global competitiveness and market image, and management of biosecurity issues affecting imports and the disease status of exports)
* biosecurity (pests and diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), avian influenza, foot and mouth disease, citrus canker, and sugarcane smut)
* infrastructure (such as transport, ports, telecommunications, energy and irrigation facilities)
* management skills and labor supply (With increasing requirements for business planning, enhanced market awareness, the use of modern technology such as computers and global positioning systems and better agronomic management, modern farm managers will need to become increasingly skilled. Examples: training of skilled workers, the development of labor hire systems that provide continuity of work in industries with strong seasonal peaks, modern communication tools, investigating market opportunities, researching customer requirements, business planning including financial management, researching the latest farming techniques, risk management skills)
* coordination (a more consistent national strategic agenda for agricultural research and development; more active involvement of research investors in collaboration with research providers developing programs of work; greater coordination of research activities across industries, research organisations and issues; and investment in human capital to ensure a skilled pool of research personnel in the future.)
* technology (research, adoption, productivity, genetically modified (GM) crops, investments)
* water (access rights, water trade, providing water for environmental outcomes, assignment of risk in response to the reallocation of water from consumptive to environmental use, accounting for the sourcing and allocation of water)
* resource access issues (management of native vegetation, the protection and enhancement of biodiversity, sustainability of productive agricultural resources, and landholder responsibilities)

=== Poverty reduction ===

Policymakers working in poverty reduction in the agriculture sector assess, plan, or enact policies aimed to address the needs of persons living in poverty. Agriculture has been a critical driver of poverty reduction in most developing countries, particularly in rural areas. Approximately 80% of the world&#x27;s impoverished population, who primarily reside in rural areas and earn their livelihood through farming, can benefit from agriculture in terms of poverty reduction, income generation, and food security. Fostering agricultural development is therefore a crucial element of agricultural policy in a developing country. In addition, a recent Natural Resource Perspective paper by the Overseas Development Institute found that good infrastructure, education and effective information services in rural areas were necessary to improve the chances of making agriculture work for the poor.

During the 1980s and 1990s, there was a disregard for the agriculture sector among policymakers and investors, only regaining interest when the prices of staple food crops experienced a significant increase in the mid-2000s. As a result of agricultural policy neglect, there has been a scarcity of investment in infrastructure, which has hindered agricultural development and public goods, such as education, research and development and technology. Rural productive sectors and small agricultural enterprises suffer from market failures due to policies favouring urban areas and lending policies biased against small-scale agricultural firms. Neglect in implementing agriculture policy has been detected in several developing countries. In Indonesia, since the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 to 1998, the government&#x27;s agricultural policy has been closely concentrated on achieving price stability and self-sufficiency for import-competing commodities, such as palm oil, sugar and rice.

International agencies such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Bank, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), espouse the prioritisation of agricultural endeavours to support poverty reduction. The impact of agricultural policy on reducing poverty differs across countries and is influenced by a variety of factors, such as the level of government policy support, the degree of public and private investment in agriculture, the different types of agriculture, and the growth rates of agriculture parallel to non-agriculture sectors. In particular, investment in agricultural research and development has been shown to be highly influential on agricultural GDP growth and poverty reduction. Government policies play a key role in promoting agricultural activities, such as irrigation systems, roads and telecommunication systems, land reform, power in rural areas, fiscal support for research and development, pricing policies, assistance for new technologies, and markets for agricultural produce. Agricultural policies have contributed to meeting the goals related to increasing, diversifying, and improving agricultural production.

Agricultural policies aimed at reducing poverty include India&#x27;s Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, which offers crop insurance to farmers to protect them from weather-related uncertainties and potential crop failures. This initiative provides farmers with financial aid for crop loss, reducing the risk of falling into poverty. Rwanda&#x27;s Crop Intensification Program is another example of such policy, which provides farmers with inputs like fertilisers, improved seeds, and pesticides, as well as training and technical support to help them adopt more efficient farming practices. However, for agricultural policies to contribute to poverty reduction, it is essential that they collaborate effectively and cohesively with other sectors, such as tourism, sustainable economy, and industry.

===Biosecurity===

The biosecurity concerns facing industrial agriculture can be illustrated by:
* the threat to poultry and humans from H5N1; possibly caused by the use of animal vaccines
* the threat to cattle and humans from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE); possibly caused by the unnatural feeding of cattle to cattle to minimize costs

The use of animal vaccines can create new viruses that kill people and cause flu pandemic threats. H5N1 is an example of where this might have already occurred. According to the CDC article &quot;H5N1 Outbreaks and Enzootic Influenza&quot; by Robert G. Webster et al.: &quot;Transmission of highly pathogenic H5N1 from domestic poultry back to migratory waterfowl in western China has increased the geographic spread. The spread of H5N1 and its likely reintroduction to domestic poultry increase the need for good agricultural vaccines. In fact, the root cause of the continuing H5N1 pandemic threat may be the way the pathogenicity of H5N1 viruses is masked by co-circulating influenza viruses or bad agricultural vaccines.&quot; Robert Webster explains: &quot;If you use a good vaccine you can prevent the transmission within poultry and to humans. But if they have been using vaccines now [in China] for several years, why is there so much bird flu? There is bad vaccine that stops the disease in the bird but the bird goes on pooping out the virus and maintaining it and changing it. And I think this is what is going on in China. It has to be. Either there is not enough vaccine being used or there is substandard vaccine being used. Probably both. It&#x27;s not just China. We can&#x27;t blame China for substandard vaccines. I think there are substandard vaccines for influenza in poultry all over the world.&quot;

In response to the same concerns, Reuters reports Hong Kong infectious disease expert Lo Wing-lok indicating that vaccines have to take top priority. Julie Hall, who is in charge of the WHO&#x27;s outbreak response in China, claimed that China&#x27;s vaccinations might be masking the virus. The BBC reported that Wendy Barclay, a virologist at the University of Reading, UK said: &quot;The Chinese have made a vaccine based on reverse genetics made with H5N1 antigens, and they have been using it. There has been a lot of criticism of what they have done because they have protected their chickens against death from this virus but the chickens still get infected, and then you get the drift - the virus mutates in response to the antibodies - and now we have a situation where we have five or six &#x27;flavours&#x27; of H5N1 out there.&quot;

====Bovine spongiform encephalopathy====
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as &quot;mad cow disease&quot;, is a fatal, neurodegenerative disease of cattle, which infects by a mechanism that surprised biologists upon its discovery in the late 20th century. In the UK, the country worst affected, 179,000 cattle were infected and 4.4 million were killed as a precaution. The disease can be transmitted to human beings who eat or inhale material from infected carcasses. In humans, it is known as new variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD or nvCJD), and by June 2007, it had killed 165 people in Britain, and six elsewhere with the number expected to rise because of the disease&#x27;s long incubation period. Between 460,000 and 482,000 BSE-infected animals had entered the human food chain before controls on high-risk offal were introduced in 1989.

A British inquiry into BSE concluded that the epidemic was caused by feeding cattle, who are normally herbivores, the remains of other cattle in the form of meat and bone meal (MBM), which caused the infectious agent to spread.&lt;ref name=&quot;DEFRA/BSE&quot;&gt;&quot;BSE: Disease control &amp; eradication - Causes of BSE&quot; , Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs, March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the disease itself remains unknown. The current scientific view is that infectious proteins called prions developed through spontaneous mutation, probably in the 1970s, and there is a possibility that the use of organophosphorus pesticides increased the susceptibility of cattle to the disease. The infectious agent is distinctive for the high temperatures it is able to survive; this contributed to the spread of the disease in Britain, which had reduced the temperatures used during its rendering process. Another contributory factor was the feeding of infected protein supplements to very young calves instead of milk from their mothers.

====Foot-and-mouth disease====

Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious and sometimes fatal viral disease of cattle and pigs. It can also infect deer, goats, sheep, and other bovids with cloven hooves, as well as elephants, rats, and hedgehogs. Humans are affected only very rarely. FMD occurs throughout much of the world, and while some countries have been free of FMD for some time, its wide host range and rapid spread represent cause for international concern. In 1996, endemic areas included Asia, Africa, and parts of South America. North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan have been free of FMD for many years. Most European countries have been recognized as free, and countries belonging to the European Union have stopped FMD vaccination.

Infection with foot-and-mouth disease tends to occur locally, that is, the virus is passed on to susceptible animals through direct contact with infected animals or with contaminated pens or vehicles used to transport livestock. The clothes and skin of animal handlers such as farmers, standing water, and uncooked food scraps and feed supplements containing infected animal products can harbor the virus as well. Cows can also catch FMD from the semen of infected bulls. Control measures include quarantine and destruction of infected livestock, and export bans for meat and other animal products to countries not infected with the disease.

Because FMD rarely infects humans but spreads rapidly among animals, it is a much greater threat to the agriculture industry than to human health. Farmers around the world can lose huge amounts of money during a foot-and-mouth epidemic, when large numbers of animals are destroyed and revenues from milk and meat production go down. One of the difficulties in vaccinating against FMD is the huge variation between and even within serotypes. There is no cross-protection between serotypes (meaning that a vaccine for one serotype won&#x27;t protect against any others) and in addition, two strains within a given serotype may have nucleotide sequences that differ by as much as 30% for a given gene. This means that FMD vaccines must be highly specific to the strain involved. Vaccination only provides temporary immunity that lasts from months to years. Therefore, rich countries maintain a policy of banning imports from all countries, not proven FMD-free by US or EU standards. This is a point of contention.

Although this disease is not dangerous to humans and rarely fatal to otherwise healthy animals, it reduces milk and meat production. Outbreaks can be stopped quickly if farmers and transporters are forced to abide by existing rules. Therefore, (besides temporary discomfort to the animals), any outbreak in the rich world should not be much more as a localized, cyclical economic problem. For countries with free roaming wildlife it is nearly impossible to prove that they are entirely free of this disease. If they try they are forced to erect nationwide fences, which destroys wildlife migration. Because detecting and reporting of FMD have enormously improved and sped up, almost all poor countries could now safely create FMD-free export zones. But rich countries refuse to change the rules. In effect, many poor tropical countries have no chance to meet current rules, so they are still today banned from exporting meat, even if many of them are FMD-free.

The result is that if drought hits, the poor try to cope by selling their few animals. This quickly saturates regional demand. The export ban then destroys the value of these animals, in effect destroying the most important coping mechanism of several hundreds of millions extremely poor households. The rules around meat exports have been changed many times, always to accommodate changing circumstances in rich countries, usually further reducing meat export chances for poor countries. For that reason, Kanya and many other countries find the rules very unjust. They are however discouraged to file a formal complaint with WTO by diplomats from rich countries.

====Citrus canker====

Citrus canker is a disease affecting citrus species that is caused by the bacterium &quot;Xanthomonas axonopodis&quot;. The infection causes lesions on the leaves, stems, and fruit of citrus trees, including lime, oranges, and grapefruit. While not harmful to humans, canker significantly affects the vitality of citrus trees, causing leaves and fruit to drop prematurely; a fruit infected with canker is safe to eat but too unsightly to be sold. The disease, which is believed to have originated in South East Asia, is extremely persistent when it becomes established in an area, making it necessary for all citrus orchards to be destroyed for the successful eradication of the disease. Australia, Brazil and the United States are currently experiencing canker outbreaks.

The disease can be detected in orchards and on fruit by the appearance of lesions. Early detection is critical in quarantine situations. Bacteria are tested for pathogenicity by inoculating multiple citrus species with the bacterium. Simultaneously, other diagnostic tests (antibody detection, fatty-acid profiling, and genetic procedures using PCR) are conducted to identify the particular canker strain. Citrus canker outbreaks are prevented and managed in a number of ways. In countries that do not have canker, the disease is prevented from entering the country by quarantine measures. In countries with new outbreaks, eradication programs that are started soon after the disease has been discovered have been successful; such programs rely on the destruction of affected orchards. When eradication has been unsuccessful and the disease has become established, management options include replacing susceptible citrus cultivars with resistant cultivars, applying preventive sprays of copper-based bactericides, and destroying infected trees and all surrounding trees within an appropriate radius.

The citrus industry is the largest fresh-fruit exporting industry in Australia. Australia has had three outbreaks of citrus canker; all three were successfully eradicated. The disease was found twice during the 1900s in the Northern Territory and was eradicated each time. During the first outbreak in 1912, every citrus tree north of latitude 19° south was destroyed, taking 11 years to eradicate the disease. In 2004, Asiatic citrus canker was detected in an orchard in Emerald, Queensland, and was thought to have occurred from the illegal import of infected citrus plants. The state and federal governments have ordered that all commercial orchards, all non-commercial citrus trees, and all native lime trees (&quot;C. glauca&quot;) in the vicinity of Emerald be destroyed rather than trying to isolate infected trees.

===Food security===
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) defines food security as existing when &quot;all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life&quot;. The four qualifications that must be met for a food secure system include physical availability, economic and physical access, appropriate utilization, and stability of the prior three elements over time.

Of the 6.7 billion people on the planet, about 2 billion are food insecure. As the global population grows to 9 billion by 2050, and as diets shift to emphasize higher energy products and greater overall consumption, food systems will be subjected to even greater pressure. Climate change presents additional threats to food security, affecting crop yields, distribution of pests and diseases, weather patterns, and growing seasons around the world.

Food security has thus become an increasingly important topic in agricultural policy as decision makers attempt to reduce poverty and malnutrition while augmenting adaptive capacity to climate change. The Commission on Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change listed high-priority policy actions to address food security, including integrating food security and sustainable agriculture into global and national policies, significantly raising the level of global investment in food systems, and developing specific programs and policies to support the most vulnerable populations (namely, those that are already subject to food insecurity).

===Food sovereignty===
&#x27;Food sovereignty&#x27;, a term coined by members of Via Campesina in 1996, is about the right of peoples to define their own food systems. Advocates of food sovereignty put the people who produce, distribute, and consume food at the centre of decisions on food systems and policies, rather than the demands of markets and corporations that they believe have come to dominate the global food system. This movement is advocated by a number of farmers, peasants, pastoralists, fisherfolk, indigenous peoples, women, rural youth, and environmental organizations.

== Policy tools ==
An agricultural subsidy is a governmental subsidy paid to farmers and agribusinesses to manage the agricultural industry as one part of the various methods a government uses in a mixed economy. The conditions for payment and the reasons for the individual specific subsidies vary with farm product, size of the farm, nature of ownership, and country among other factors. Enriching peanut farmers for political purposes, keeping the price of a staple low to keep the poor from rebelling, stabilizing the production of a crop to avoid famine years, encouraging diversification and many other purposes have been suggested as the reason for specific subsidies.

Price floors or price ceilings set a minimum or maximum price for a product. Price controls encourage more production by a price floor or less production by a price ceiling.
A government can erect trade barriers to limit the number of goods imported (in the case of a Quota Share) or enact tariffs to raise the domestic price of imported products. These barriers give preference to domestic producers.

== Objectives of market intervention ==
=== National security ===
Some argue that nations have an interest in assuring there is sufficient domestic production capability to meet domestic needs in the event of a global supply disruption. Significant dependence on foreign food producers makes a country strategically vulnerable in the event of war, blockade or embargo. Maintaining adequate domestic capability allows for food self-sufficiency that lessens the risk of supply shocks due to geopolitical events. Agricultural policies may be used to support domestic producers as they gain domestic and international market share. This may be a short term way of encouraging an industry until it is large enough to thrive without aid. Or it may be an ongoing subsidy designed to allow a product to compete with or undercut the foreign competition. This may produce a net gain for a government despite the cost of interventions because it allows a country to build up an export industry or reduce imports. It also helps to form the nation&#x27;s supply and demand market.

=== Environmental protection and land management ===
Farm or undeveloped land composes the majority of land in most countries. Policies may encourage some land uses rather than others in the interest of protecting the environment. For instance, subsidies may be given for particular farming methods, forestation, land clearance, or pollution abatement.

=== Rural poverty and poverty relief ===
Subsidising farming may encourage people to remain on the land and obtain some income. This might be relevant to an agrarian country with many peasant farmers, but it may also be a consideration to more developed countries such as Poland. It has a very high unemployment rate, much farmland and retains a large rural population growing food for their own use.

Price controls may also be used to assist poor citizens. Many countries have used this method of welfare support as it delivers cheap food to the poorest in urban areas without the need to assess people to give them financial aid. This often goes at the cost of the rural poor, who then earn less from what is often their only realistic or potential source of income: agriculture. Because in almost all countries the rural poor are poorer than the urban poor, cheap food policies through price controls often increase overall poverty.

The same often counts for poverty relief in the form of food aid, which (unless while during severe drought) drives small producers in poor countries out of production. It tends to benefit lower middle class groups (sub-urban and urban poor) at the expense of the poorest 20 percent, who as a result remain deprived of customers.

=== Organic farming assistance ===
Welfare economics theory holds that sometimes private activities can impose social costs upon others. Industrial agriculture is widely considered to impose social costs through pesticide pollution and nitrate pollution. Further, agriculture uses large amounts of water, a scarce resource. Some economists argue that taxes should be levied on agriculture, or that organic agriculture, which uses little pesticides and experiences relatively little nitrate runoff, should be encouraged with subsidies. In the United States, 65% of the approximately $16.5 billion in annual subsidies went to the top 10% of farmers in 2002 because subsidies are linked to certain commodities. On the other hand, organic farming received $5 million for help in certification and $15 million for research over a 5-year time period.

=== Fair trade ===

Some advocate Fair Trade rules to ensure that poor farmers in developing nations that produce crops primarily for export are not exploited or negatively impacted by trade policies, practices, tariffs, and agreements which benefit one competitor at the expense of another - which advocates consider a dangerous &quot;race to the bottom&quot; in agricultural labor and safety standards. Opponents point out that most agriculture in developed nations is produced by industrial corporations (agribusiness) which are hardly deserving of sympathy, and that the alternative to exploitation is poverty.

Fair trade steak? Much of what developing countries export to the rich world, also comes from industrial corporations. The reason for that is, that rich countries have put up elaborate quality demands, most of whom make no factual health contribution. Small farmers often in effect meet these demands, but are rarely able to prove that in western standards. Therefore, the biggest impediment to the growth of small farming and therefore of fair trade in sectors beyond coffee and bananas, is these quality demands from the rich world.

== Arguments against market intervention ==
=== Dumping of agricultural surpluses===
In international trade parlance, when a company from country A sells a commodity below the cost of production into country B, this is called &quot;dumping&quot;. A number of countries that are signatories to multilateral trade agreements have provisions that prohibit this practice.
When rich countries subsidize domestic production, the excess output is often given to the developing world as foreign aid. This process eliminates the domestic market for agricultural products in the developing world because the products can be obtained for free from western aid agencies. In developing nations where these effects are most severe, small farmers could no longer afford basic inputs and were forced to sell their land.

&quot;Consider a farmer in Ghana who used to be able to make a living growing rice. Several years ago, Ghana was able to feed and export their surplus. Now, it imports rice. From where? Developed countries. Why? Because it&#x27;s cheaper. Even if it costs the rice producer in the developed world much more to produce the rice, he doesn&#x27;t have to make a profit from his crop. The government pays him to grow it, so he can sell it more cheaply to Ghana than the farmer in Ghana can. And that farmer in Ghana? He can&#x27;t feed his family anymore.&quot; (Lyle Vanclief, former Canadian Minister of Agriculture [1997-2003])

According to the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, corn, soybeans, cotton, wheat and rice are sold below the cost of production, or dumped. Dumping rates are approximately forty percent for wheat, between twenty-five and thirty percent for corn (maize), approximately thirty percent for soybeans, fifty-seven percent for cotton, and approximately twenty percent for rice. For example, wheat is sold for forty percent below cost.

According to Oxfam, &quot;If developed nations eliminated subsidy programs, the export value of agriculture in lesser developed nations would increase by 24 %, plus a further 5.5 % from tariff equilibrium. ... exporters can offer US surpluses for sale at prices around half the cost of production; destroying local agriculture and creating a captive market in the process.&quot; Free trade advocates desire the elimination of all market distorting mechanisms (subsidies, tariffs, regulations) and argue that, as with free trade in all areas, this will result in aggregate benefit for all. This position is particularly popular in competitive agricultural exporting nations in both the developed and developing world, some of whom have banded together in the Cairns Group lobby. Canada&#x27;s Department of Agriculture estimates that developing nations would benefit by about $4 billion annually if subsidies in the developed world were halved.

=== Agricultural independence ===
Many developing countries do not grow enough food to feed their own populations. These nations must buy food from other countries. Lower prices and free food save the lives of millions of starving people, despite the drop in food sales of the local farmers. A developing nation could use new improved farming methods to grow more food, with the ultimate goal of feeding their nation without outside help. New greenhouse methods, hydroponics, fertilizers, R/O water processors, hybrid crops, fast-growing hybrid trees for quick shade, interior temperature control, greenhouse or tent insulation, autonomous building gardens, sun lamps, mylar, fans, and other cheap tech can be used to grow crops on previously unarable land, such as rocky, mountainous, desert, and even Arctic lands. More food can be grown, reducing dependency on other countries for food.

Replacement crops can also make nations agriculturally independent. Sugar, for example, comes from sugar cane imported from Polynesia. Instead of buying the sugar from Polynesia, a nation can make sugar from sugar beets, maple sap, or sweetener from stevia plant, keeping the profits circulating within the nation&#x27;s economy. Paper and clothes can be made of hemp instead of trees and cotton. Tropical foods won&#x27;t grow in many places in Europe, but they will grow in insulated greenhouses or tents in Europe. Soybean plant cellulose can replace plastic (made from oil). Ethanol from farm waste or hempseed oil can replace gasoline. Rainforest medicine plants grown locally can replace many imported medicines. Alternates of cash crops, like sugar and oil replacements, can reduce farmers&#x27; dependency on subsidies in both developed and developing nations.

Market interventions may increase the cost to consumers for agricultural products, either via hidden wealth-transfers via the government, or increased prices at the consumer level, such as for sugar and peanuts in the US. This has led to market distortions, such as food processors using high fructose corn syrup as a replacement for sugar. High fructose corn syrup may be an unhealthy food additive, and, were sugar prices not inflated by government fiat, sugar might be preferred over high fructose corn syrup in the marketplace.

=== Agriculture policy design strategy and examples ===
The concerns of agricultural policies are extensive, and includes ensuring the hygiene of salads, globalization management, and other emerging issues. The majority of the concerns fall into three categories: food supply for a growing population, livelihood insurance for farmers, and environmental protection. The theme of all approaches aiming to address these 3 types of concerns is to have a holistic view of their effects and externalities (a by-product of an action that affects others without their consent), because some policies intended to address one aspect of the concerns may have unintended harmful consequences that worsen other aspects while some have zero or negative beneficial effects. For example, subsidizing agricultural companies allows them to expand their industry and offer their products at lower prices to customers, but increases the firm&#x27;s water and land usage which are at the cost of natural habitats. From an opposite perspective, if we protect the natural habitats and tax the agricultural firm for turning natural lands into factories, the prices of their products increase, making the firm&#x27;s products too expensive for some customers. These externalities and trade-offs put the policymakers in a dilemma because our current global agriculture system is vulnerable to many disruptions such as weather changes, locality, manpower shifts, etc. Consequently, before we resolve this primary fragility of our agriculture system. It&#x27;s of high cruciality for policymakers to weigh the trade-offs and adopt the most appropriate policies.

There are examples of the agricultural policy design mentioned above that are made by worldwide unions, countries, and states. While every specific situation requires its own specific agricultural policy design, these examples can provide useful models, insights, and lessons for future policymakers&#x27; reference and inspiration. The Common Agricultural Policy, published by E.U., uses government subsidies to encourage food production and farming industrialization in its early stage. In some areas, food production boomed so much that enormous food waste became a new problem. With food waste, the market was thrown into imbalance. Consequently, the price drop cost the farmers&#x27; utility and has led to a future reform known as the Marsholt Plan. Marsholt Plan and following reforms generally adjusted the agriculture market back to balance. Later reforms managed to spread the fund to farmers and increase each individual farmers&#x27; welfare instead of merely expanding croplands and industries. Starting from 2003, the Common Agricultural Policy fund is further detailed into individuals and environmental protection is finally put into consideration.

=== Overview: Europe and America ===

The farmer population is approximately five percent of the total population in the E.U. and 1.7% in the U.S. The total value of agricultural production in the E.U. amounted to 128 billion euros (1998). About forty-nine percent of this amount was accounted for by political measures: 37 billion euros due to direct payments and 43 billion euros from consumers due to the artificially high price. Eighty percent of European farmers receive a direct payment of 5,000 euros or less, while 2.2% receive a direct payment above 50,000 euros, totaling forty percent of all direct subsidies.

The average U.S. farmer receives $16,000 in annual subsidies. Two-thirds of farmers receive no direct payments. Of those that do, the average amount amongst the lowest paid eighty percent was $7000 from 1995 to 2003. Subsidies are a mix of tax reductions, direct cash payments and below-market prices on water and other inputs. Some claim that these aggregate figures are misleading because large agribusinesses, rather than individual farmers, receive a significant share of total subsidy spending. The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 reduced farm subsidies, providing fixed payments over a period and replacing price supports and subsidies. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 contains direct and countercyclical payments designed to limit the effects of low prices and yields.

In the EU, €54 billion of subsidies are paid every year. An increasing share of the subsidies is being decoupled from production and lumped into the Single Farm Payment. While this has diminished the distortions created by the Common Agricultural Policy, many critics argue that a greater focus on the provision of public goods, such as biodiversity and clean water, is needed. The next major reform is expected for 2014 when a new long-term EU budget is coming into effect.

=== Environmental programs ===
The U.S. Conservation Reserve Program leases land from producers that take marginal land out of production and convert it back to a near-natural state by planting native grasses and other plants. The U.S. Environmental Quality Incentives Program subsidizes improvements which promote water conservation and other measures. This program is conducted under a bidding process using a formula where farmers request a certain percentage of cost share for improvement such as drip irrigation. Producers that offer the most environmental improvement based on a point system for the least cost are funded first. The process continues until that year&#x27;s allocated funds are expended.

== World Trade Organization actions ==

In April 2004 the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled that 3 billion dollars in US cotton subsidies violate trade agreements and that almost 50% of EU sugar exports are illegal. In 1997–2003, US cotton exports were subsidized by an average of 48%. The WTO has extracted commitments from the Philippines government, making it lower import barriers to half their present levels over a span of six years, and allowing in drastically increased competition from the industrialised and heavily subsidised farming systems of North America and Europe. A recent Oxfam report estimated that average household incomes of maize farmers will be reduced by as much as 30% over the six years as cheap imports from the US drive down prices in the local markets. The report estimates that in the absence of trade restrictions, US subsidised maize could be marketed at less than half the price of maize grown on the Philippine island of Mindanao; and that the livelihoods of up to half a million Filipino maize farmers (out of the total 1.2 million) are under immediate threat.

<text>An agricultural subsidy (also called an agricultural incentive) is a government incentive paid to agribusinesses, agricultural organizations and farms to supplement their income, manage the supply of agricultural products, and influence the cost and supply of such commodities.

Examples of such commodities include: wheat, feed grains (grain used as fodder, such as maize or corn, sorghum, barley and oats), cotton, milk, rice, peanuts, sugar, tobacco, oilseeds such as soybeans and meat products such as beef, pork, and lamb and mutton.

A 2021 study by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization found $540 billion was given to farmers every year between 2013 and 2018 in global subsidies. The study found these subsidies are harmful in numerous ways. In wealthy countries, they damage health by promoting the overconsumption of meat.

In under-developed countries they encourage overconsumption of low-nutrition staples, such as rice. Subsidies also contribute to the climate crisis, by encouraging deforestation; and they also drive inequality because smallholder farmers, many of whom are women, are excluded. According to UNDP head, Achim Steiner, redirecting subsidies would boost the livelihoods of 500 million smallholder farmers worldwide by creating a more level playing field with large-scale agricultural enterprises. A separate report, by the World Resources Institute in August 2021, said without reform, farm subsidies &quot;will render vast expanses of healthy land useless&quot;.

== History ==
On the earliest known interventions in farming markets was the English Corn Laws, which regulated the import and export of grain in Great Britain and Ireland for centuries. The laws were repealed in 1846. Agricultural subsidies in the twentieth century were originally designed to stabilize markets, help low-income farmers, and aid rural development. In the United States, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as part of the New Deal in 1933. At the time the economy was in a severe depression and farmers were experiencing the lowest agricultural prices since the 1890s. The plan was to increase prices for a range of agricultural products by paying farmers to destroy some of their livestock or not use some of their land - known as land idling. This led to a reduction in supply and smaller agricultural surpluses. Initially seven products were controlled: (corn, wheat, cotton, rice, peanuts, tobacco and milk). Unlike traditional subsidies that promote the growth of products, this process boosted agricultural prices by limiting the growth of these crops.

In Europe, Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was launched in 1962 to improve agricultural productivity. According to the European Commission, the act aims to

* Support farmers and improve agricultural productivity, so that consumers have a stable supply of affordable food
* Ensure that European Union (EU) farmers can make a reasonable living
* Help tackling climate change and the sustainable management of natural resources
* Maintain rural areas and landscapes across the EU
* Keep the rural economy alive by promoting jobs in farming, agri-foods industries and associated sectors

== By region ==

=== Canada ===
Canadian agricultural subsidies are currently controlled by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. Financial subsidies are offered through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership Programs. The Canadian Agricultural Partnership began in April 2018 and is planned to take place over five years with a combined federal, provincial and territorial investment of three billion dollars. Some programs offered surround issues including AgriAssurance, agricultural leveraging programs, promoting diversity in agriculture, crop and livestock insurance, marketing activities, risk mitigation, and more. Before the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, agricultural subsidies were organized under the Growing Forward 2 partnership from 2013 to 2018.

=== European Union ===

In 2010, the EU spent €57 billion on agricultural development, of which €39 billion was spent on direct subsidies. Agricultural and fisheries subsidies form over 40% of the EU budget. Since 1992 (and especially since 2005), the EU&#x27;s Common Agricultural Policy has undergone significant change as subsidies have mostly been decoupled from production. The largest subsidy is the &quot;Single Farm Payment&quot;.

=== Malawi ===
Increases in food and fertilizer prices have underlined the vulnerability of poor urban and rural households in many developing countries, especially in Africa, renewing policymakers&#x27; focus on the need to increase staple food crop productivity.

A study by the Overseas Development Institute evaluates the benefits of the Malawi Government Agricultural Inputs Subsidy Programme, which was implemented in 2006–2007 to promote access to and use of fertilizers in both maize and tobacco production to increase agricultural productivity and food security. The subsidy was implemented by means of a coupon system which could be redeemed by the recipients for fertilizer types at approximately one-third of the normal cash price. According to policy conclusions of the Overseas Development Institute the voucher for coupon system can be an effective way of rationing and targeting subsidy access to maximize production and economic and social gains. Many practical and political challenges remain in the program design and implementation required to increase efficiency, control costs, and limit patronage and fraud.

=== New Zealand ===
New Zealand is reputed to have the most open agricultural markets in the world after radical reforms started in 1984 by the Fourth Labour Government stopped all subsidies.

In 1984 New Zealand&#x27;s Labor government took the dramatic step of ending all farm subsidies, which then consisted of 30 separate production payments and export incentives. This was a truly striking policy action, because New Zealand&#x27;s economy is roughly five times more dependent on farming than is the U.S. economy, measured by either output or employment. Subsidies in New Zealand accounted for more than 30 percent of the value of production before reform, somewhat higher than U.S. subsidies today. And New Zealand farming was marred by the same problems caused by U.S. subsidies, including overproduction, environmental degradation and inflated land prices.

As the country is a large agricultural exporter, continued subsidies by other countries are a long-standing bone of contention, with New Zealand being a founding member of the 20-member Cairns Group fighting to improve market access for exported agricultural goods.

=== Turkey ===
=== United States ===

The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, also known as the 2002 Farm Bill, addressed a great variety of issues related to agriculture, ecology, energy, trade, and nutrition. Signed after the September 11th attacks of 2001, the act directs approximately $16.5 billion of government funding toward agricultural subsidies each year. This funding has had a great effect on the production of grains, oilseeds, and upland cotton. The United States paid allegedly around $20 billion in 2005 to farmers in direct subsidies as &quot;farm income stabilization&quot; via farm bills. Overall agricultural subsidies in 2010 were estimated at $172 billion by a European agricultural industry association; however, the majority of this estimate consists of food stamps and other consumer subsidies, so it is not comparable to the 2005 estimate.

Agricultural policies of the United States are changed, incrementally or more radically, by Farm Bills that are passed every five years or so. Statements about how the program works might be right at one point in time, at best, but are probably not sufficient for assessing agricultural policies at other points in time. For example, a large part of the support to program crops has not been linked directly to current output since the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (P.L. 104–127). Instead, these payments were tied to historical entitlement, not current planting. For example, it is incorrect to attribute a payment associated with the wheat base area to wheat production now because that land might be allocated to any of a number of permitted uses, including held idle. Over time, successive Farm Bills have linked these direct payments to market prices or revenue, but not to production. In contrast, some programs, like the Marketing Loan Program that can create something of a floor price that producers receive per unit sold, are tied to production. That is, if the price of wheat in 2002 was $3.80, farmers would get an extra 58¢ per bushel (52¢ plus the 6¢ price difference). Fruit and vegetable crops are not eligible for subsidies.

Corn was the top crop for subsidy payments prior to 2011. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandated that billions of gallons of ethanol be blended into vehicle fuel each year, guaranteeing demand, but US corn ethanol subsidies were between $5.5 billion and $7.3 billion per year. Producers also benefited from a federal subsidy of 51 cents per gallon, additional state subsidies, and federal crop subsidies that had brought the total to 85 cents per gallon or more. However, the federal ethanol subsidy expired 31 December 2011. 

=== Asia ===

Farm subsidies in Asia remain a point of contention in global trade talks.

==== China ====
In 2016, China provided $212 billion in agricultural subsidies. In 2018, China increased their subsidies for soybean farmers in their northeastern provinces. Corn farmers, however, received reduced subsidies due to Beijing&#x27;s 2017 policy that set out to reduce its huge stockpile. Soybean farmers in Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Inner Mongolia provinces will receive more subsidies from Beijing than corn farmers. The cutting of corn acreage and the lifting of soybean acreage came in 2016 as a push from China to re-balance grain stocks. Subsidies for agriculture machinery and equipment will also be provided by Beijing to farmers.

==== Indonesia ====
In 1971, as a method of expanding the rice supply in Indonesia, the government began subsidizing fertilizer to farmers after the discovery and introduction of new, high-yielding rice varieties. In 2012, Indonesia provided $28 billion in agricultural subsidies.

==== Japan ====
Over the 2000s, Japan has been reforming its generous agricultural subsidy regime to support more business-oriented farmers. Yet, subsidies remain high in international comparison. In 2009, Japan paid US$46.5 billion in subsidies to its farmers, and continued state support of farmers in Japan remains a controversial topic. In 2012, Japan provided $65 billion in agricultural subsidies.

==== South Korea ====
South Korea has made attempts to reform its agricultural sector, despite resistance from vested interests. In 2012, South Korea provided approximately $20 billion in agricultural subsidies.

====India====
Agricultural subsidy in India primarily consists of subsidies like, fertilizer, irrigation, equipment, credit subsidy, seed subsidy, export subsidy etc. Subsidy on fertilizers is provided by the Central government whereas subsidy on water and irrigation is provided by the local State governments. Drawing on the most recent estimates, annual central government subsidies to farmers would be of the order of as the sum of fertilizer subsidies (, 2017/18), credit subsidies (, 2017/18), crop insurance subsidies (, 2018/19) and expenditures towards price support ( estimated for 2016/17). Total subsidies to farmers in India is in the range of $45 billion to 50 billion, to the tune of 2%-2.5% of GDP. But per farmer the subsidy just about touches $48 in India, compared to over $7,000 in the U.S.

==== Armenia ====
Direct subsidies, of the Ministry of Agriculture, include subsidies for fertilizers, improved seed, agricultural chemicals, and fuel. The purpose of subsidies is to aid the smallest farmers in the sector. In particular, the maximum loan size for interest subsidies is minimal, and only farms with less than 3 ha are eligible for fuel, fertilizer, chemical, and seed subsidies. For loans of up to 3 million drams (about US$6,185 at current exchange rates), subsidies decrease interest rates from 10%–12% to 4%–6% in an effort to support Armenia&#x27;s smaller farms.

== Impact of subsidies ==

=== Global food prices and international trade ===
Although some critics and proponents of the World Trade Organization have noted that export subsidies, by driving down the price of commodities, can provide cheap food for consumers in developing countries, low prices are harmful to farmers not receiving the subsidy. Because it is usually wealthy countries that can afford domestic subsidies, critics argue that they promote poverty in developing countries by artificially driving down world crop prices.

Generally, developing countries have a comparative advantage in producing agricultural goods, but low crop prices encourage developing countries to be dependent buyers of food from wealthy countries. So local farmers, instead of improving the agricultural and economic self-sufficiency of their home country, are forced out of the market and perhaps even off their land. This occurs as a result of a process known as &quot;international dumping&quot; in which subsidized farmers are able to &quot;dump&quot; low-cost agricultural goods on foreign markets at costs that un-subsidized farmers cannot compete with. Agricultural subsidies often are a common stumbling block in trade negotiations. In 2006, talks at the Doha round of WTO trade negotiations stalled because the US refused to cut subsidies to a level where other countries&#x27; non-subsidized exports would have been competitive.

Others argue that a world market with farm subsidies and other market distortions (as happens today) results in higher food prices, rather than lower food prices, as compared to a free market.

In 2002 Mark Malloch Brown, former head of the United Nations Development Programme, estimated that farm subsidies cost poor countries about US$50 billion a year in lost agricultural exports:

It is the extraordinary distortion of global trade, where the West spends $360 billion a year on protecting its agriculture with a network of subsidies and tariffs that costs developing countries about US$50 billion in potential lost agricultural exports. Fifty billion dollars is the equivalent of today&#x27;s level of development assistance.

=== Poverty in developing countries ===
The impact of agricultural subsidies in developed countries upon developing-country farmers and international development is well documented. Agricultural subsidies can help drive prices down to benefit consumers, but also mean that unsubsidised developing-country farmers have a more difficult time competing in the world market; and the effects on poverty are particularly negative when subsidies are provided for crops that are also grown in developing countries since developing-country farmers must then compete directly with subsidised developed-country farmers, for example in cotton and sugar. The IFPRI has estimated in 2003 that the impact of subsidies costs developing countries $24 billion in lost incomes going to agricultural and agro-industrial production; and more than $40 billion is displaced from net agricultural exports. Moreover, the same study found that the least developed countries have a higher proportion of GDP dependent upon agriculture, at around 36.7%, thus may be even more vulnerable to the effects of subsidies. It has been argued that subsidised agriculture in the developed world is one of the greatest obstacles to economic growth in the developing world; which has an indirect impact on reducing the income available to invest in rural infrastructure such as health, safe water supplies and electricity for the rural poor. The total amount of subsidies that go towards agriculture in OECD countries far exceeds the amount that countries provide in development aid. In the case of Africa, it is estimated that a 1% increase in its total agricultural exports could lift its GDP by $70 billion, nearly five times what the region is provided in total foreign aid.

==== Haiti and US rice imports ====
Haiti is an excellent example of a developing country negatively affected by agricultural subsidies in the developed world. Haiti is a nation with the capacity to produce rice and was at one time self-sufficient in meeting its own needs. At present, Haiti does not produce enough to feed its people; 60 percent of the food consumed in the country is imported. Following advice to liberalize its economy by lowering tariffs, domestically produced rice was displaced by cheaper subsidized rice from the United States. The Food and Agriculture Organization describes this liberalization process as being the removal of barriers to trade and a simplification of tariffs, which lowers costs to consumers and promotes efficiency among producers.

Opening up Haiti&#x27;s economy granted consumers access to food at a lower cost; allowing foreign producers to compete for the Haitian market drove down the price of rice. However, for Haitian rice farmers without access to subsidies, the downward pressure on prices led to a decline in profits. Subsidies received by American rice farmers, plus increased efficiencies, made it impossible for their Haitian counterparts to compete. According to Oxfam and the International Monetary Fund, tariffs on imports fell from 50 percent to three percent in 1995 and the nation is currently importing 80 percent of the rice it consumes.

The United States Department of Agriculture notes that since 1980, rice production in Haiti has been largely unchanged, while consumption on the other hand, is roughly eight times what it was in that same year. Haiti is among the top three consumers of long grain milled rice produced in the United States.

As rice farmers struggled to compete, many migrated from rural to urban areas in search of alternative economic opportunities.

=== Impact on nutrition ===
One peer-reviewed research suggests that any effects of US farm policies on US obesity patterns must have been negligible. However, some critics argue that the artificially low prices resulting from subsidies create unhealthy incentives for consumers. For example, in the US, cane sugar was replaced with cheap corn syrup, making high-sugar food cheaper; beet and cane sugar are subject to subsidies, price controls, and import tariffs that distort the prices of these products as well.

The lower price of energy-dense foods such as grains and sugars could be one reason why low-income people and food insecure people in industrialized countries are more vulnerable to being overweight and obese. According to the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, meat and dairy production receive 63% of subsidies in the United States, as well as sugar subsidies for unhealthy foods, which contribute to heart disease, obesity and diabetes, with enormous costs for the health sector.

Market distortions due to subsidies have led to an increase in corn fed cattle rather than grass fed. Corn fed cattle require more antibiotics and their beef has a higher fat content.

=== Cross-border movement of businesses ===
Tariffs on sugar have also caused large candy makers in the US to relocate to Canada and Mexico, where sugar is often half to a third the price.
The Dominican Republic Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), though, has had little impact in this area. The sugar issue causing alarm had reasoning due to what plausible effects could come through the tariffs as well as the undetermined future of these types of negotiations considering sugar importation in the United States. Due to various continuing disputes in trade, Mexico began to have fewer exports of sugar into the United States, where the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) allowed. Those who left and sought out other companies for sugar have leaned marginally more towards Canada than Mexico. The tariffs are what keeps the large pressure from competition from south of the Rio Grande at bay.

=== Non-farming companies ===
Subsidies are also given to companies and individuals with little connection to traditional farming. It has been reported that the largest part of the sum given to these companies flow to multinational companies like food conglomerates, sugar manufacturers and liquor distillers. For example, in France, the single largest beneficiary was the chicken processor Groupe Doux, at €62.8m, and was followed by about a dozen sugar manufacturers which together reaped more than €103m.

=== Public economics implications ===
Government intervention, through agricultural subsidies, interferes with the price mechanism which would normally determine commodity prices, often creating crop overproduction and market discrimination. 

Journalist Michael Pollan argues that corn became a prime crop for over-production (and thus subsidies) due to it having a wide genetic variability and flexibility; historical uses of corn as food and as a commodity fueled its growth with capitalism. As a result of overproduction and falling prices, farmers were subsidized with direct payments from the government. The pressure to produce massive swaths of corn, however, resulted in farmers tending to monocrop agriculture. As Pollan argues, this not only pushed many small farms out of business, but also resulted in paradoxical &quot;food deserts&quot;.

Subsidies are also an inefficient use of taxpayer&#x27;s money. For instance, in 2006, the Department of Agriculture estimated that the average farm household income was $77,654 or about 17% higher than the average US household income. From a public economics perspective, subsidies of any kind work to create a socially and politically acceptable equilibrium that is not necessarily Pareto efficient.

=== Environmental implications ===

A study by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization found 87% of the $540bn farmers given every year between 2013 and 2018 in global subsidies are harmful to both people and environment. The monoculture system associated with subsidized large-scale production has been implicated as a contributory factor in Colony Collapse Disorder which has affected bee populations. Bee pollination is an essential ecosystem service essential for the production of many varieties of fruits and vegetables. Subsidies often go towards subsidising meat production which has other nutritional and environmental implications; and it has been found that out of the $200Bn subsidies to subsidise crops from 1995 to 2010 around two-thirds of this went to animal feed, tobacco and cotton production. On the other hand, farmers producing fruits and vegetables received no direct subsidies. The environmental impact of meat production is high due to the resource and energy requirements that go into production of feed for livestock throughout their lifespan, for example, a kilogram of beef uses about 60 times as much water as an equivalent amount of potato. The subsidies contribute to meat consumption by allowing for an artificially low cost of meat products.

== Alternatives ==
Liberals argue that subsidies distort incentives for the global trade of agricultural commodities in which other countries may have a comparative advantage. Allowing countries to specialize in commodities in which they have a comparative advantage in and then freely trade across borders would therefore increase global welfare and reduce food prices. Ending direct payments to farmers and deregulating the farm industry would eliminate inefficiencies and deadweight loss created by government intervention.

However, others disagree, arguing that a more radical transformation of agriculture is needed, one guided by the notion that ecological change in agriculture cannot be promoted without comparable changes in the social, political, cultural and economic arenas that conform and determine agriculture. The organized peasant and indigenous based agrarian movements, e.g. Via Campesina, take action by arguing that only by changing the export-led, free-trade based, industrial agriculture model of large farms can halt what they call the downward spiral of poverty, low wages, rural-urban migration, hunger and environmental degradation.

<doc id="171867" wikidata="Q316334" url="?curid=171867" title="Heraclides Ponticus">
<text>Heraclides Ponticus ( &quot;Herakleides&quot;; c. 390 BC – c. 310 BC) was a Greek philosopher and astronomer who was born in Heraclea Pontica, now Karadeniz Ereğli, Turkey, and migrated to Athens. He is best remembered for proposing that the Earth rotates on its axis, from west to east, once every 24 hours. He is also hailed as the originator of the heliocentric theory; although this is disputed. 

==Life==
Heraclides&#x27; father was Euthyphron, a wealthy nobleman who sent his son to study at the Platonic Academy in Athens under its founder Plato and under his successor Speusippus. According to the &quot;Suda&quot;, Plato, on his departure for Sicily in 361/360 BC, left the Academy in the charge of Heraclides. Heraclides was nearly elected successor to Speusippus as head of the academy in 339/338 BC, but narrowly lost to Xenocrates.

All of Heraclides&#x27; writings have been lost; only a few fragments remain. Like the Pythagoreans Hicetas and Ecphantus, Heraclides proposed that the apparent daily motion of the stars was created by the rotation of the Earth on its axis once a day. This view contradicted the accepted Aristotelian model of the universe, which said that the Earth was fixed and that the stars and planets in their respective spheres might also be fixed. Simplicius says that Heraclides proposed that the irregular movements of the planets can be explained if the Earth moves while the Sun stays still.

Although some historians have proposed that Heraclides taught that Venus and Mercury revolve around the Sun, a detailed investigation of the sources has shown that &quot;nowhere in the ancient literature mentioning Heraclides of Pontus is there a clear reference for his support for any kind of heliocentrical planetary position.&quot;

A punning on his name, dubbing him Heraclides &quot;Pompicus,&quot; suggests he may have been a rather vain and pompous man and the target of much ridicule. Diogenes Laërtius, citing Aristoxenus as his source, states that Heraclides forged plays under the name of Thespis, and further states that Camaeleon claimed that Heraclides had plagiarised commentaries on Hesiod and Homer from him. Laërtius also conveys a story in which Dionysius the Deserter fooled Heraclides by forging a play, &quot;Parthenopaeus&quot;, under the name of Sophocles. Heraclides was deceived by this easily and cited it as the work of Sophocles. However, Heraclides seems to have been a versatile and prolific writer on philosophy, mathematics, music, grammar, physics, history and rhetoric, notwithstanding doubts about attribution of many of the works. It appears that he composed various works in dialogue form.

Heraclides also seems to have had an interest in the occult. In particular he focused on explaining trances, visions and prophecies in terms of the retribution of the gods, and reincarnation.

A quote of Heraclides, of particular significance to historians, is his statement that fourth century B.C. Rome was a Greek city.

Heraclides Ponticus refers with much admiration that Pythagoras would remember having been Pirro and before Euphorbus and before some other mortal.

<text>Joseph Russel Robinson (July 8, 1892 – September 30, 1963) was an American ragtime, dixieland, and blues pianist and composer. He was a member of the Original Dixieland Jass Band.

==Career==
Robinson was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. In his teens he worked as a pianist in theaters to provide music for silent movies. With a right arm that was damaged by polio, he formed unusual techniques with his left hand. 
With his brother John, a drummer, he toured the southern United States in the early 1910s with an extended stay in New Orleans.

He started publishing compositions in his teens; his early hits included &quot;Sapho Rag&quot; and &quot;Eccentric&quot;. His compositions were published as piano rolls by Imperial, the United Music Company, and QRS. He signed a contract with QRS to record blues songs from 1918 to 1921. He worked as a manager for the publishing company owned by W.C. Handy.

Robinson became a member of the Original Dixieland Jass Band in 1919, replacing on piano Henry Ragas, who died on February 18, 1919, in the flu epidemic. Aside from the band, in the early to middle 1920s he played piano for vocalists such as Lizzie Miles and Lucille Hegamin. In the 1930s he became the head of NBC Radio&#x27;s music department and was a major factor in reuniting the now scattered band. The reunion in 1936 yielded six RCA Victor recordings as &quot;The Original Dixieland Five,&quot; several network radio appearances (one with Benny Goodman), and an appearance in a &quot;March of Time&quot; movie short, with J. Russel Robinson speaking on-camera.

At the end of the decade Robinson moved to California and continued to write songs. He was the composer of the title song, &quot;Portrait of Jennie,&quot; for the 1948 film of the same name. The song subsequently became a hit for Nat King Cole.

<doc id="171878" wikidata="Q3284444" url="?curid=171878" title="Tautochrone curve">
<text>A tautochrone curve or isochrone curve () is the curve for which the time taken by an object sliding without friction in uniform gravity to its lowest point is independent of its starting point on the curve. The curve is a cycloid, and the time is equal to π times the square root of the radius of the circle which generates the cycloid, over the acceleration of gravity. The tautochrone curve is related to the brachistochrone curve, which is also a cycloid.

== The tautochrone problem ==
The tautochrone problem, the attempt to identify this curve, was solved by Christiaan Huygens in 1659. He proved geometrically in his &quot;Horologium Oscillatorium&quot;, originally published in 1673, that the curve is a cycloid.

The cycloid is given by a point on a circle of radius formula_1 tracing a curve as the circle rolls along the formula_2 axis, as:
formula_3

Huygens also proved that the time of descent is equal to the time a body takes to fall vertically the same distance as diameter of the circle that generates the cycloid, multiplied by formula_4. In modern terms, this means that the time of descent is formula_5, where formula_1 is the radius of the circle which generates the cycloid, and formula_7 is the gravity of Earth, or more accurately, the earth&#x27;s gravitational acceleration.
This solution was later used to solve the problem of the brachistochrone curve. Johann Bernoulli solved the problem in a paper (&quot;Acta Eruditorum&quot;, 1697).
The tautochrone problem was studied by Huygens more closely when it was realized that a pendulum, which follows a circular path, was not isochronous and thus his pendulum clock would keep different time depending on how far the pendulum swung. After determining the correct path, Christiaan Huygens attempted to create pendulum clocks that used a string to suspend the bob and curb cheeks near the top of the string to change the path to the tautochrone curve. These attempts proved unhelpful for a number of reasons. First, the bending of the string causes friction, changing the timing. Second, there were much more significant sources of timing errors that overwhelmed any theoretical improvements that traveling on the tautochrone curve helps. Finally, the &quot;circular error&quot; of a pendulum decreases as length of the swing decreases, so better clock escapements could greatly reduce this source of inaccuracy.

Later, the mathematicians Joseph Louis Lagrange and Leonhard Euler provided an analytical solution to the problem.

== Lagrangian solution ==
For a simple harmonic oscillator released from rest, regardless of its initial displacement, the time it takes to reach the lowest potential energy point is always a quarter of its period, which is independent of its amplitude. Therefore, the Lagrangian of a simple harmonic oscillator is isochronous.

In the tautochrone problem, if the particle&#x27;s position is parametrized by the arclength from the lowest point, the kinetic energy is then proportional to formula_8, and the potential energy is proportional to the height . One way the curve in the tautochrone problem can be an isochrone is if the Lagrangian is mathematically equivalent to a simple harmonic oscillator; that is, the height of the curve must be proportional to the arclength squared:

where the constant of proportionality is formula_9. Compared to the simple harmonic oscillator&#x27;s Lagrangian, the equivalent spring constant is formula_10, and the time of descent is formula_11 However, the physical meaning of the constant formula_1 is not clear until we determine the exact analytical equation of the curve.

To solve for the analytical equation of the curve, note that the differential form of the above relation is

which eliminates , and leaves a differential equation for and . This is the differential equation for a cycloid when the vertical coordinate is counted from its vertex (the point with a horizontal tangent) instead of the cusp.

To find the solution, integrate for in terms of :

{\sqrt{h}}, \\
x &amp;= -4r\int \sqrt{1-u^2} \, du,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;}}

where formula_13, and the height decreases as the particle moves forward formula_14. This integral is the area under a circle, which can be done with another substitution formula_15 and yield:

This is the standard parameterization of a cycloid with formula_16. It&#x27;s interesting to note that the arc length squared is equal to the height difference multiplied by the full arch length formula_17.

== &quot;Virtual gravity&quot; solution ==
The simplest solution to the tautochrone problem is to note a direct relation between the angle of an incline and the gravity felt by a particle on the incline. A particle on a 90° vertical incline undergoes full gravitational acceleration formula_7, while a particle on a horizontal plane undergoes zero gravitational acceleration. At intermediate angles, the acceleration due to &quot;virtual gravity&quot; by the particle is formula_19. Note that formula_20 is measured between the tangent to the curve and the horizontal, with angles above the horizontal being treated as positive angles. Thus, formula_20 varies from formula_22 to formula_23.

The position of a mass measured along a tautochrone curve, formula_24, must obey the following differential equation:

(Based loosely on &quot;Proctor&quot;, pp. 135–139)

== Abel&#x27;s solution ==
Niels Henrik Abel attacked a generalized version of the tautochrone problem (&quot;Abel&#x27;s mechanical problem&quot;), namely, given a function formula_25 that specifies the total time of descent for a given starting height, find an equation of the curve that yields this result. The tautochrone problem is a special case of Abel&#x27;s mechanical problem when formula_25 is a constant.

Abel&#x27;s solution begins with the principle of conservation of energy – since the particle is frictionless, and thus loses no energy to heat, its kinetic energy at any point is exactly equal to the difference in gravitational potential energy from its starting point. The kinetic energy is formula_27, and since the particle is constrained to move along a curve, its velocity is simply formula_28, where formula_29 is the distance measured along the curve. Likewise, the gravitational potential energy gained in falling from an initial height formula_30 to a height formula_31 is formula_32, thus:
dt &amp; = - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2g(y_0-y)}} \frac{d\ell}{dy} \,dy
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;}}

In the last equation, we have anticipated writing the distance remaining along the curve as a function of height (formula_33, recognized that the distance remaining must decrease as time increases (thus the minus sign), and used the chain rule in the form formula_34.

Now we integrate from formula_35 to formula_36 to get the total time required for the particle to fall:

 \int_0^{y_0} \frac{1}{\sqrt{y_0-y}} \frac{d\ell}{dy} \, dy
&lt;/math&gt;}}

This is called Abel&#x27;s integral equation and allows us to compute the total time required for a particle to fall along a given curve (for which formula_37 would be easy to calculate). But Abel&#x27;s mechanical problem requires the converse – given formula_38, we wish to find formula_39, from which an equation for the curve would follow in a straightforward manner. To proceed, we note that the integral on the right is the convolution of formula_37 with formula_41 and thus take the Laplace transform of both sides with respect to variable formula_31:

 \mathcal{L} \left [ \frac{1}{\sqrt{y}} \right ]F(s)
&lt;/math&gt;}}

where formula_43. Since formula_44, we now have an expression for the Laplace transform of formula_37 in terms of the Laplace transform of formula_46:

 s^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathcal{L}[T(y_0)]
&lt;/math&gt;}}

This is as far as we can go without specifying formula_46. Once formula_46 is known, we can compute its Laplace transform, calculate the Laplace transform of formula_37 and then take the inverse transform (or try to) to find formula_37.

For the tautochrone problem, formula_51 is constant. Since the Laplace transform of 1 is formula_52, i.e., formula_53, we find the shape function formula_54:

 s^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathcal{L}[T_0] \\
&amp; = \sqrt{\frac{2g}{\pi}} T_0 s^{-\frac{1}{2}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;}}

Making use again of the Laplace transform above, we invert the transform and conclude:

{\pi}\frac{1}{\sqrt{y}}&lt;/math&gt;}}

It can be shown that the cycloid obeys this equation. It needs one step further to do the integral with respect to formula_31 to obtain the expression of the path shape.

<doc id="171879" wikidata="Q529985" url="?curid=171879" title="Brachistochrone curve">
<text>In physics and mathematics, a brachistochrone curve (), or curve of fastest descent, is the one lying on the plane between a point &quot;A&quot; and a lower point &quot;B&quot;, where &quot;B&quot; is not directly below &quot;A&quot;, on which a bead slides frictionlessly under the influence of a uniform gravitational field to a given end point in the shortest time. The problem was posed by Johann Bernoulli in 1696 and solved by Isaac Newton in 1697.

The brachistochrone curve is the same shape as the tautochrone curve; both are cycloids. However, the portion of the cycloid used for each of the two varies. More specifically, the brachistochrone can use up to a complete rotation of the cycloid (at the limit when A and B are at the same level), but always starts at a cusp. In contrast, the tautochrone problem can use only up to the first half rotation, and always ends at the horizontal. The problem can be solved using tools from the calculus of variations and optimal control.

The curve is independent of both the mass of the test body and the local strength of gravity. Only a parameter is chosen so that the curve fits the starting point &quot;A&quot; and the ending point &quot;B&quot;. If the body is given an initial velocity at &quot;A&quot;, or if friction is taken into account, then the curve that minimizes time differs from the tautochrone curve.

==History==

=== Galileo&#x27;s problem ===
Earlier, in 1638, Galileo Galilei had tried to solve a similar problem for the path of the fastest descent from a point to a wall in his &quot;Two New Sciences&quot;. He draws the conclusion that the arc of a circle is faster than any number of its chords,From the preceding it is possible to infer that the quickest path of all [lationem omnium velocissimam], from one point to another, is not the shortest path, namely, a straight line, but the arc of a circle.
...

Consequently the nearer the inscribed polygon approaches a circle the shorter the time required for descent from A to C. What has been proven for the quadrant holds true also for smaller arcs; the reasoning is the same.

Just after Theorem 6 of &quot;Two New Sciences&quot;, Galileo warns of possible fallacies and the need for a &quot;higher science&quot;. In this dialogue Galileo reviews his own work. Galileo studied the cycloid and gave it its name, but the connection between it and his problem had to wait for advances in mathematics.

Galileo’s conjecture is that “The shortest time of all [for a movable body] will be that of its fall along the arc ADB [of a quarter circle] and similar properties are to be understood as holding for all lesser arcs taken upward from the lowest limit B.”

In Fig.1, from the “Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems”, Galileo claims that the body sliding along the circular arc of a quarter circle, from A to B will reach B in less time than if it took any other path from A to B. Similarly, in Fig. 2, from any point D on the arc AB, he claims that the time along the lesser arc DB will be less than for any other path from D to B. In fact, the quickest path from A to B or from D to B, the brachistochrone, is a cycloidal arc, which is shown in Fig. 3 for the path from A to B, and Fig.4 for the path from D to B, superposed on the respective circular arc.
=== Introduction of the problem ===
Johann Bernoulli posed the problem of the brachistochrone to the readers of &quot;Acta Eruditorum&quot; in June, 1696. He said:

Bernoulli wrote the problem statement as:

Johann and his brother Jakob Bernoulli derived the same solution, but Johann&#x27;s derivation was incorrect, and he tried to pass off Jakob&#x27;s solution as his own. Johann published the solution in the journal in May of the following year, and noted that the solution is the same curve as Huygens&#x27; tautochrone curve. After deriving the differential equation for the curve by the method given below, he went on to show that it does yield a cycloid. However, his proof is marred by his use of a single constant instead of the three constants, &quot;vm&quot;, &quot;2g&quot; and &quot;D&quot;, below.

Bernoulli allowed six months for the solutions but none were received during this period. At the request of Leibniz, the time was publicly extended for a year and a half. At 4 p.m. on 29 January 1697 when he arrived home from the Royal Mint, Isaac Newton found the challenge in a letter from Johann Bernoulli. Newton stayed up all night to solve it and mailed the solution anonymously by the next post. Upon reading the solution, Bernoulli immediately recognized its author, exclaiming that he &quot;recognizes a lion from his claw mark&quot;. This story gives some idea of Newton&#x27;s power, since Johann Bernoulli took two weeks to solve it. Newton also wrote, &quot;I do not love to be dunned [pestered] and teased by foreigners about mathematical things...&quot;, and Newton had already solved Newton&#x27;s minimal resistance problem, which is considered the first of the kind in calculus of variations. Bernoulli had used the principle of least time in his solution but not calculus of variations, whereas Newton did to solve the problem, and as a result, pioneered the field with his work on the two problems.

In the end, five mathematicians responded with solutions: Newton, Jakob Bernoulli, Gottfried Leibniz, Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus and Guillaume de l&#x27;Hôpital. Four of the solutions (excluding l&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s) were published in the same edition of the journal as Johann Bernoulli&#x27;s. In his paper, Jakob Bernoulli gave a proof of the condition for least time similar to that below before showing that its solution is a cycloid. According to Newtonian scholar Tom Whiteside, in an attempt to outdo his brother, Jakob Bernoulli created a harder version of the brachistochrone problem. In solving it, he developed new methods that were refined by Leonhard Euler into what the latter called (in 1766) the &quot;calculus of variations&quot;. Joseph-Louis Lagrange did further work that resulted in modern infinitesimal calculus.

==Johann Bernoulli&#x27;s solution==

=== Introduction ===

In a letter to L’Hôpital, (21/12/1696), Bernoulli stated that when considering the problem of the curve of quickest descent, after only 2 days he noticed a curious affinity or connection with another no less remarkable problem leading to an ‘indirect method’ of solution. Then shortly afterwards he discovered a ‘direct method’. 

=== Direct method ===

In a letter to Henri Basnage, held at the University of Basel Public Library, dated 30 March 1697, Johann Bernoulli stated that he had found two methods (always referred to as &quot;direct&quot; and &quot;indirect&quot;) to show that the Brachistochrone was the &quot;common cycloid&quot;, also called the &quot;roulette&quot;. Following advice from Leibniz, he included only the indirect method in the &quot;Acta Eruditorum Lipsidae&quot; of May 1697. He wrote that this was partly because he believed it was sufficient to convince anyone who doubted the conclusion, partly because it also resolved two famous problems in optics that &quot;the late Mr. Huygens&quot; had raised in his treatise on light. In the same letter he criticised Newton for concealing his method.

In addition to his indirect method he also published the five other replies to the problem that he received.

Johann Bernoulli&#x27;s direct method is historically important as a proof that the brachistochrone is the cycloid. The method is to determine the curvature of the curve at each point. All the other proofs, including Newton&#x27;s (which was not revealed at the time) are based on finding the gradient at each point.

In 1718, Bernoulli explained how he solved the brachistochrone problem by his direct method.

He explained that he had not published it in 1697, for reasons that no longer applied in 1718. This paper was largely ignored until 1904 when the depth of the method was first appreciated by Constantin Carathéodory, who stated that it shows that the cycloid is the only possible curve of quickest descent. According to him, the other solutions simply implied that the time of descent is stationary for the cycloid, but not necessarily the minimum possible.

==== Analytic solution ====
A body is regarded as sliding along any small circular arc Ce between the radii KC and Ke, with centre K fixed. The first stage of the proof involves finding the particular circular arc, Mm, which the body traverses in the minimum time.

The line KNC intersects AL at N, and line Kne intersects it at n, and they make a small angle CKe at K. Let NK = a, and define a variable point, C on KN extended. Of all the possible circular arcs Ce, it is required to find the arc Mm, which requires the minimum time to slide between the 2 radii, KM and Km. To find Mm Bernoulli argues as follows.

Let MN = x. He defines m so that MD = mx, and n so that Mm = nx + na and notes that x is the only variable and that m is finite and n is infinitely small. The small time to travel along arc Mm is formula_1, which has to be a minimum (‘un plus petit’). He does not explain that because Mm is so small the speed along it can be assumed to be the speed at M, which is as the square root of MD, the vertical distance of M below the horizontal line AL.

It follows that, when differentiated this must give 
:formula_2 so that x = a.

This condition defines the curve that the body slides along in the shortest time possible. For each point, M on the curve, the radius of curvature, MK is cut in 2 equal parts by its axis AL. This property, which Bernoulli says had been known for a long time, is unique to the cycloid.

Finally, he considers the more general case where the speed is an arbitrary function X(x), so the time to be minimised is formula_3.
The minimum condition then becomes 
formula_4
which he writes as :formula_5
and which gives MN (=x) as a function of NK (= a). From this the equation of the curve could be obtained from the integral calculus, though he does not demonstrate this.

==== Synthetic solution ====
He then proceeds with what he called his Synthetic Solution, which was a classical, geometrical proof, that there is only a single curve that a body can slide down in the minimum time, and that curve is the cycloid.

&quot;The reason for the synthetic demonstration, in the manner of the ancients, is to convince Mr. de la Hire. He has little time for our new analysis, describing it as false (He claims he has found 3 ways to prove that the curve is a cubic parabola)&quot; – Letter from Johan Bernoulli to Pierre Varignon dated 27 Jul 1697. 

Assume AMmB is the part of the cycloid joining A to B, which the body slides down in the minimum time. Let ICcJ be part of a different curve joining A to B, which can be closer to AL than AMmB. If the arc Mm subtends the angle MKm at its centre of curvature, K, let the arc on IJ that subtends the same angle be Cc. The circular arc through C with centre K is Ce. Point D on AL is vertically above M. Join K to D and point H is where CG intersects KD, extended if necessary.

Let formula_6 and t be the times the body takes to fall along Mm and Ce respectively.

:formula_7, formula_8, 
Extend CG to point F where, formula_9 and since formula_10, it follows that
:formula_11
Since MN = NK, for the cycloid:
:formula_12, formula_13, and formula_14

If Ce is closer to K than Mm then 
:formula_15 and formula_16
In either case, 
:formula_17, and it follows that formula_18
If the arc, Cc subtended by the angle infinitesimal angle MKm on IJ is not circular, it must be greater than Ce, since Cec becomes a right-triangle in the limit as angle MKm approaches zero.

Note, Bernoulli proves that CF &gt; CG by a similar but different argument.

From this he concludes that a body traverses the cycloid AMB in less time than any other curve ACB.

=== Indirect method ===
According to Fermat’s principle, the actual path between two points taken by a beam of light (which obeys Snell&#x27;s law of refraction) is one that takes the least time. In 1697 Johann Bernoulli used this principle to derive the brachistochrone curve by considering the trajectory of a beam of light in a medium where the speed of light increases following a constant vertical acceleration (that of gravity &quot;g&quot;).

By the conservation of energy, the instantaneous speed of a body &quot;v&quot; after falling a height &quot;y&quot; in a uniform gravitational field is given by:
:formula_19,
The speed of motion of the body along an arbitrary curve does not depend on the horizontal displacement.

Bernoulli noted that Snell&#x27;s law of refraction gives a constant of the motion for a beam of light in a medium of variable density:
:formula_20,
where &quot;vm&quot; is the constant and &quot;formula_21&quot; represents the angle of the trajectory with respect to the vertical.

The equations above lead to two conclusions:
# At the onset, the angle must be zero when the particle speed is zero. Hence, the brachistochrone curve is tangent to the vertical at the origin.
# The speed reaches a maximum value when the trajectory becomes horizontal and the angle θ = 90°.

Assuming for simplicity that the particle (or the beam) with coordinates (x,y) departs from the point (0,0) and reaches maximum speed after falling a vertical distance &quot;D&quot;:
:formula_22.
Rearranging terms in the law of refraction and squaring gives:
:formula_23
which can be solved for &quot;dx&quot; in terms of &quot;dy&quot;:
:formula_24.
Substituting from the expressions for &quot;v&quot; and &quot;vm&quot; above gives:
:formula_25
which is the differential equation of an inverted cycloid generated by a circle of diameter &quot;D=2r&quot;, whose parametric equation is:
:formula_26
where φ is a real parameter, corresponding to the angle through which the rolling circle has rotated. For given φ, the circle&#x27;s centre lies at .

In the brachistochrone problem, the motion of the body is given by the time evolution of the parameter:
:formula_27
where &quot;t&quot; is the time since the release of the body from the point (0,0).

==Jakob Bernoulli&#x27;s solution==

Johann&#x27;s brother Jakob showed how 2nd differentials can be used to obtain the condition for least time. A modernized version of the proof is as follows. If we make a negligible deviation from the path of least time, then, for the differential triangle formed by the displacement along the path and the horizontal and vertical displacements,

:formula_28.

On differentiation with &quot;dy&quot; fixed we get,

:formula_29.

And finally rearranging terms gives,

:formula_30

where the last part is the displacement for given change in time for 2nd differentials. Now consider the changes along the two neighboring paths in the figure below for which the horizontal separation between paths along the central line is &quot;d2x&quot; (the same for both the upper and lower differential triangles). Along the old and new paths, the parts that differ are,
:formula_31
:formula_32

For the path of least times these times are equal so for their difference we get,
:formula_33

And the condition for least time is,
:formula_34
which agrees with Johann&#x27;s assumption based on the law of refraction.

== Newton&#x27;s solution ==
=== Introduction ===

In June 1696, Johann Bernoulli had used the pages of the &quot;Acta Eruditorum Lipsidae&quot; to pose a challenge to the international mathematical community: to find the form of the curve joining two fixed points so that a mass will slide down along it, under the influence of gravity alone, in the minimum amount of time. The solution was originally to be submitted within six months. At the suggestion of Leibniz, Bernoulli extended the challenge until Easter 1697, by means of a printed text called &quot;Programma&quot;, published in Groningen, in the Netherlands.

The &quot;Programma&quot; is dated 1 January 1697, in the Gregorian Calendar. This was 22 December 1696 in the Julian Calendar, in use in Britain.
According to Newton&#x27;s niece, Catherine Conduitt, Newton learned of the challenge at 4 pm on 29 January and had solved it by 4 am the following morning. His solution, communicated to the Royal Society, is dated 30 January. This solution, later published anonymously in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;, is correct but does not indicate the method by which Newton arrived at his conclusion. Bernoulli, writing to Henri Basnage in March 1697, indicated that even though its author, &quot;by an excess of modesty&quot;, had not revealed his name, yet even from the scant details supplied it could be recognised as Newton&#x27;s work, &quot;as the lion by its claw&quot; (in Latin, &quot;ex ungue Leonem&quot;).

D. T. Whiteside notes that the letter in French has &quot;ex ungue Leonem&quot; preceded by the French word &quot;comme&quot;. The much quoted version &quot;tanquam ex ungue Leonem&quot; is due to David Brewster&#x27;s 1855 book on the life and works of Newton. Bernoulli&#x27;s intention was, Whiteside argues, simply to indicate he could tell the anonymous solution was Newton&#x27;s, just as it was possible to tell that an animal was a lion given its claw; it was not meant to suggest that Bernoulli considered Newton to be the lion among mathematicians, as it has since come to be interpreted.

John Wallis, who was 80 years old at the time, had learned of the problem in September 1696 from Johann Bernoulli&#x27;s youngest brother Hieronymus, and had spent three months attempting a solution before passing it in December to David Gregory, who also failed to solve it. After Newton had submitted his solution, Gregory asked him for the details and made notes from their conversation. These can be found in the University of Edinburgh Library, manuscript A formula_35, dated 7 March 1697. Either Gregory did not understand Newton&#x27;s argument, or Newton&#x27;s explanation was very brief. However, it is possible, with a high degree of confidence, to construct Newton&#x27;s proof from Gregory&#x27;s notes, by analogy with his method to determine the solid of minimum resistance (Principia, Book 2, Proposition 34, Scholium 2). A detailed description of his solution of this latter problem is included in the draft of a letter in 1694, also to David Gregory. In addition to the minimum time curve problem, there was a second problem that Newton also solved at the same time. Both solutions appeared anonymously in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, for January 1697.

=== The Brachistochrone problem ===
Fig. 1, shows Gregory’s diagram (except the additional line IF is absent from it, and Z, the start point has been added). The curve ZVA is a cycloid and CHV is its generating circle. Since it appears that the body is moving upward from e to E, it must be assumed that a small body is released from Z and slides along the curve to A, without friction, under the action of gravity.

Consider a small arc eE, which the body is ascending. Assume that it traverses the straight line eL to point L, horizontally displaced from E by a small distance, o, instead of the arc eE. Note, that eL is not the tangent at e, and that o is negative when L is between B and E. Draw the line through E parallel to CH, cutting eL at n. From a property of the cycloid, En is the normal to the tangent at E, and similarly the tangent at E is parallel to VH.

Since the displacement EL is small, it differs little in direction from the tangent at E so that the angle EnL is close to a right-angle. In the limit as the arc eE approaches zero, eL becomes parallel to VH, provided o is small compared to eE making the triangles EnL and CHV similar.

Also en approaches the length of chord eE, and the increase in length, formula_36, ignoring terms in formula_37 and higher, which represent the error due to the approximation that eL and VH are parallel.

The speed along eE or eL can be taken as that at E, proportional to formula_38, which is as CH, since formula_39

This appears to be all that Gregory’s note contains.

Let t be the additional time to reach L,

formula_40

Therefore, the increase in time to traverse a small arc displaced at one endpoint depends only on the displacement at the endpoint and is independent of the position of the arc. However, by Newton’s method, this is just the condition required for the curve to be traversed in the minimum time possible. Therefore, he concludes that the minimum curve must be the cycloid.

He argues as follows.

Assuming now that Fig. 1 is the minimum curve not yet determined, with vertical axis CV, and the circle CHV removed, and Fig. 2 shows part of the curve between the infinitesimal arc eE and a further infinitesimal arc Ff a finite distance along the curve. The extra time, t, to traverse eL (rather than eE) is nL divided by the speed at E (proportional to formula_38), ignoring terms in formula_37 and higher:

formula_43,

At L the particle continues along a path LM, parallel to the original EF, to some arbitrary point M. As it has the same speed at L as at E, the time to traverse LM is the same as it would have been along the original curve EF. At M it returns to the original path at point f. By the same reasoning, the reduction in time, T, to reach f from M rather than from F is

formula_44

The difference (t – T) is the extra time it takes along the path compared to the original :

formula_45 plus terms in formula_37 and higher (1)

Because is the minimum curve, (t – T) is must be greater than zero, whether o is positive or negative. It follows that the coefficient of o in (1) must be zero:

formula_47 (2) in the limit as eE and fF approach zero. Note since is the minimum curve it has to be assumed that the coefficient of formula_37 is greater than zero.

Clearly there has to be 2 equal and opposite displacements, or the body would not return to the endpoint, A, of the curve.

If e is fixed, and if f is considered a variable point higher up the curve, then for all such points, f, formula_49 is constant (equal to formula_50). By keeping f fixed and making e variable it is clear that formula_50 is also constant.

But, since points, e and f are arbitrary, equation (2) can be true only if formula_52, everywhere, and this condition characterises the curve that is sought. This is the same technique he uses to find the form of the Solid of Least Resistance.

For the cycloid, formula_53 , so that formula_54, which was shown above to be constant, and the Brachistochrone is the cycloid.

Newton gives no indication of how he discovered that the cycloid satisfied this last relation. It may have been by trial and error, or he may have recognised immediately that it implied the curve was the cycloid.

<text>The calculus of variations (or variational calculus) is a field of mathematical analysis that uses variations, which are small changes in functions
and functionals, to find maxima and minima of functionals: mappings from a set of functions to the real numbers. Functionals are often expressed as definite integrals involving functions and their derivatives. Functions that maximize or minimize functionals may be found using the Euler–Lagrange equation of the calculus of variations.

A simple example of such a problem is to find the curve of shortest length connecting two points. If there are no constraints, the solution is a straight line between the points. However, if the curve is constrained to lie on a surface in space, then the solution is less obvious, and possibly many solutions may exist. Such solutions are known as &quot;geodesics&quot;. A related problem is posed by Fermat&#x27;s principle: light follows the path of shortest optical length connecting two points, which depends upon the material of the medium. One corresponding concept in mechanics is the principle of least/stationary action.

Many important problems involve functions of several variables. Solutions of boundary value problems for the Laplace equation satisfy the Dirichlet&#x27;s principle. Plateau&#x27;s problem requires finding a surface of minimal area that spans a given contour in space: a solution can often be found by dipping a frame in soapy water. Although such experiments are relatively easy to perform, their mathematical formulation is far from simple: there may be more than one locally minimizing surface, and they may have non-trivial topology.

== History ==

The calculus of variations began with the work of Isaac Newton, such as with Newton&#x27;s minimal resistance problem, which he formulated and solved in 1685, and later published in his &quot;Principia&quot; in 1687, which was the first problem in the field to be formulated and correctly solved, and was also one of the most difficult problems tackled by variational methods prior to the twentieth century. This problem was followed by the brachistochrone curve problem raised by Johann Bernoulli (1696), which was similar to one raised by Galileo Galilei in 1638, but he did not solve the problem explicity nor did he use the methods based on calculus. Bernoulli had solved the problem, using the principle of least time in the process, but not calculus of variations, whereas Newton did to solve the problem in 1697, and as a result, he pioneered the field with his work on the two problems. The problem would immediately occupy the attention of Jacob Bernoulli and the Marquis de l&#x27;Hôpital, but Leonhard Euler first elaborated the subject, beginning in 1733. Joseph-Louis Lagrange was influenced by Euler&#x27;s work to contribute greatly to the theory. After Euler saw the 1755 work of the 19-year-old Lagrange, Euler dropped his own partly geometric approach in favor of Lagrange&#x27;s purely analytic approach and renamed the subject the &quot;calculus of variations&quot; in his 1756 lecture &quot;Elementa Calculi Variationum&quot;.

Adrien-Marie Legendre (1786) laid down a method, not entirely satisfactory, for the discrimination of maxima and minima. Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz also gave some early attention to the subject. To this discrimination Vincenzo Brunacci (1810), Carl Friedrich Gauss (1829), Siméon Poisson (1831), Mikhail Ostrogradsky (1834), and Carl Jacobi (1837) have been among the contributors. An important general work is that of Pierre Frédéric Sarrus (1842) which was condensed and improved by Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1844). Other valuable treatises and memoirs have been written by Strauch (1849), John Hewitt Jellett (1850), Otto Hesse (1857), Alfred Clebsch (1858), and Lewis Buffett Carll (1885), but perhaps the most important work of the century is that of Karl Weierstrass. His celebrated course on the theory is epoch-making, and it may be asserted that he was the first to place it on a firm and unquestionable foundation. The 20th and the 23rd Hilbert problem published in 1900 encouraged further development.

In the 20th century David Hilbert, Oskar Bolza, Gilbert Ames Bliss, Emmy Noether, Leonida Tonelli, Henri Lebesgue and Jacques Hadamard among others made significant contributions. Marston Morse applied calculus of variations in what is now called Morse theory. Lev Pontryagin, Ralph Rockafellar and F. H. Clarke developed new mathematical tools for the calculus of variations in optimal control theory. The dynamic programming of Richard Bellman is an alternative to the calculus of variations.

== Extrema ==

The calculus of variations is concerned with the maxima or minima (collectively called extrema) of functionals. A functional maps functions to scalars, so functionals have been described as &quot;functions of functions.&quot; Functionals have extrema with respect to the elements formula_1 of a given function space defined over a given domain. A functional formula_2 is said to have an extremum at the function formula_3 if formula_4 has the same sign for all formula_1 in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of formula_6 The function formula_3 is called an extremal function or extremal. The extremum formula_8 is called a local maximum if formula_9 everywhere in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of formula_10 and a local minimum if formula_11 there. For a function space of continuous functions, extrema of corresponding functionals are called strong extrema or weak extrema, depending on whether the first derivatives of the continuous functions are respectively all continuous or not.

Both strong and weak extrema of functionals are for a space of continuous functions but strong extrema have the additional requirement that the first derivatives of the functions in the space be continuous. Thus a strong extremum is also a weak extremum, but the converse may not hold. Finding strong extrema is more difficult than finding weak extrema. An example of a necessary condition that is used for finding weak extrema is the Euler–Lagrange equation.

== Euler–Lagrange equation ==

Finding the extrema of functionals is similar to finding the maxima and minima of functions. The maxima and minima of a function may be located by finding the points where its derivative vanishes (i.e., is equal to zero). The extrema of functionals may be obtained by finding functions for which the functional derivative is equal to zero. This leads to solving the associated Euler–Lagrange equation.

Consider the functional
formula_12
where
*formula_13 are constants,
*formula_14 is twice continuously differentiable,
*formula_15
*formula_16 is twice continuously differentiable with respect to its arguments formula_17 and formula_18

If the functional formula_2 attains a local minimum at formula_10 and formula_21 is an arbitrary function that has at least one derivative and vanishes at the endpoints formula_22 and formula_23 then for any number formula_24 close to 0,
formula_25

The term formula_26 is called the variation of the function formula_3 and is denoted by formula_28

Substituting formula_29 for formula_1 in the functional formula_31 the result is a function of formula_32

formula_33
Since the functional formula_2 has a minimum for formula_35 the function formula_36 has a minimum at formula_37 and thus,
formula_38

Taking the total derivative of formula_39 where formula_40 and formula_41 are considered as functions of formula_24 rather than formula_43 yields
formula_44
and because formula_45 and formula_46
formula_47

Therefore,
formula_48
where formula_49 when formula_37 and we have used integration by parts on the second term. The second term on the second line vanishes because formula_51 at formula_22 and formula_53 by definition. Also, as previously mentioned the left side of the equation is zero so that
formula_54

According to the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations, the part of the integrand in parentheses is zero, i.e.
formula_55
which is called the Euler–Lagrange equation. The left hand side of this equation is called the functional derivative of formula_8 and is denoted formula_57 or formula_58

In general this gives a second-order ordinary differential equation which can be solved to obtain the extremal function formula_59 The Euler–Lagrange equation is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for an extremum formula_60 A sufficient condition for a minimum is given in the section Variations and sufficient condition for a minimum.

=== Example ===
In order to illustrate this process, consider the problem of finding the extremal function formula_61 which is the shortest curve that connects two points formula_62 and formula_63 The arc length of the curve is given by
formula_64
with
formula_65
Note that assuming is a function of loses generality; ideally both should be a function of some other parameter. This approach is good solely for instructive purposes.

The Euler–Lagrange equation will now be used to find the extremal function formula_66 that minimizes the functional formula_67
formula_55
with
formula_69

Since formula_3 does not appear explicitly in formula_71 the first term in the Euler–Lagrange equation vanishes for all formula_66 and thus,
formula_73
Substituting for formula_74 and taking the derivative,
formula_75

Thus
formula_76
for some constant formula_77 Then
formula_78
where
formula_79
Solving, we get
formula_80
which implies that
formula_81
is a constant and therefore that the shortest curve that connects two points formula_62 and formula_83 is
formula_84
and we have thus found the extremal function formula_66 that minimizes the functional formula_86 so that formula_87 is a minimum. The equation for a straight line is formula_88 In other words, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.

== Beltrami&#x27;s identity ==
In physics problems it may be the case that formula_89 meaning the integrand is a function of formula_66 and formula_91 but formula_92 does not appear separately. In that case, the Euler–Lagrange equation can be simplified to the Beltrami identity
formula_93
where formula_94 is a constant. The left hand side is the Legendre transformation of formula_74 with respect to formula_96

The intuition behind this result is that, if the variable formula_92 is actually time, then the statement formula_98 implies that the Lagrangian is time-independent. By Noether&#x27;s theorem, there is an associated conserved quantity. In this case, this quantity is the Hamiltonian, the Legendre transform of the Lagrangian, which (often) coincides with the energy of the system. This is (minus) the constant in Beltrami&#x27;s identity.

== Euler–Poisson equation ==
If formula_99 depends on higher-derivatives of formula_100 that is, if formula_101 then formula_1 must satisfy the Euler–Poisson equation, formula_103

== Du Bois-Reymond&#x27;s theorem ==

The discussion thus far has assumed that extremal functions possess two continuous derivatives, although the existence of the integral formula_104 requires only first derivatives of trial functions. The condition that the first variation vanishes at an extremal may be regarded as a weak form of the Euler–Lagrange equation. The theorem of Du Bois-Reymond asserts that this weak form implies the strong form. If formula_74 has continuous first and second derivatives with respect to all of its arguments, and if
formula_106
then formula_3 has two continuous derivatives, and it satisfies the Euler–Lagrange equation.

== Lavrentiev phenomenon ==

Hilbert was the first to give good conditions for the Euler–Lagrange equations to give a stationary solution. Within a convex area and a positive thrice differentiable Lagrangian the solutions are composed of a countable collection of sections that either go along the boundary or satisfy the Euler–Lagrange equations in the interior.

However Lavrentiev in 1926 showed that there are circumstances where there is no optimum solution but one can be approached arbitrarily closely by increasing numbers of sections. The Lavrentiev Phenomenon identifies a difference in the infimum of a minimization problem across different classes of admissible functions. For instance the following problem, presented by Manià in 1934:
formula_108
formula_109

Clearly, formula_110minimizes the functional, but we find any function formula_111 gives a value bounded away from the infimum.

Examples (in one-dimension) are traditionally manifested across formula_112 and formula_113 but Ball and Mizel procured the first functional that displayed Lavrentiev&#x27;s Phenomenon across formula_114 and formula_115 for formula_116 There are several results that gives criteria under which the phenomenon does not occur - for instance &#x27;standard growth&#x27;, a Lagrangian with no dependence on the second variable, or an approximating sequence satisfying Cesari&#x27;s Condition (D) - but results are often particular, and applicable to a small class of functionals. 

Connected with the Lavrentiev Phenomenon is the repulsion property: any functional displaying Lavrentiev&#x27;s Phenomenon will display the weak repulsion property.

== Functions of several variables ==

For example, if formula_117 denotes the displacement of a membrane above the domain formula_118 in the formula_119 plane, then its potential energy is proportional to its surface area:
formula_120
Plateau&#x27;s problem consists of finding a function that minimizes the surface area while assuming prescribed values on the boundary of formula_118; the solutions are called minimal surfaces. The Euler–Lagrange equation for this problem is nonlinear:
formula_122
See Courant (1950) for details.

=== Dirichlet&#x27;s principle ===
It is often sufficient to consider only small displacements of the membrane, whose energy difference from no displacement is approximated by
formula_123
The functional formula_124 is to be minimized among all trial functions formula_125 that assume prescribed values on the boundary of formula_126 If formula_127 is the minimizing function and formula_128 is an arbitrary smooth function that vanishes on the boundary of formula_129 then the first variation of formula_130 must vanish:
formula_131
Provided that u has two derivatives, we may apply the divergence theorem to obtain
formula_132
where formula_94 is the boundary of formula_129 formula_135 is arclength along formula_94 and formula_137 is the normal derivative of formula_127 on formula_139 Since formula_128 vanishes on formula_94 and the first variation vanishes, the result is
formula_142
for all smooth functions formula_128 that vanish on the boundary of formula_126 The proof for the case of one dimensional integrals may be adapted to this case to show that
formula_145in formula_126

The difficulty with this reasoning is the assumption that the minimizing function formula_127 must have two derivatives. Riemann argued that the existence of a smooth minimizing function was assured by the connection with the physical problem: membranes do indeed assume configurations with minimal potential energy. Riemann named this idea the Dirichlet principle in honor of his teacher Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet. However Weierstrass gave an example of a variational problem with no solution: minimize
formula_148
among all functions formula_125 that satisfy formula_150 and formula_151
formula_152 can be made arbitrarily small by choosing piecewise linear functions that make a transition between −1 and 1 in a small neighborhood of the origin. However, there is no function that makes formula_153 Eventually it was shown that Dirichlet&#x27;s principle is valid, but it requires a sophisticated application of the regularity theory for elliptic partial differential equations; see Jost and Li–Jost (1998).

=== Generalization to other boundary value problems ===
A more general expression for the potential energy of a membrane is
formula_154
This corresponds to an external force density formula_155 in formula_129 an external force formula_157 on the boundary formula_158 and elastic forces with modulus formula_159acting on formula_139 The function that minimizes the potential energy with no restriction on its boundary values will be denoted by formula_161 Provided that formula_3 and formula_163 are continuous, regularity theory implies that the minimizing function formula_127 will have two derivatives. In taking the first variation, no boundary condition need be imposed on the increment formula_165 The first variation of formula_130 is given by
formula_167
If we apply the divergence theorem, the result is
formula_168
If we first set formula_169 on formula_158 the boundary integral vanishes, and we conclude as before that
formula_171
in formula_126 Then if we allow formula_128 to assume arbitrary boundary values, this implies that formula_127 must satisfy the boundary condition
formula_175
on formula_139 This boundary condition is a consequence of the minimizing property of formula_127: it is not imposed beforehand. Such conditions are called natural boundary conditions.

The preceding reasoning is not valid if formula_178 vanishes identically on formula_139 In such a case, we could allow a trial function formula_180 where formula_181 is a constant. For such a trial function,
formula_182
By appropriate choice of formula_183 formula_124 can assume any value unless the quantity inside the brackets vanishes. Therefore, the variational problem is meaningless unless
formula_185
This condition implies that net external forces on the system are in equilibrium. If these forces are in equilibrium, then the variational problem has a solution, but it is not unique, since an arbitrary constant may be added. Further details and examples are in Courant and Hilbert (1953).

== Eigenvalue problems ==

Both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional eigenvalue problems can be formulated as variational problems.
=== Sturm–Liouville problems ===

The Sturm–Liouville eigenvalue problem involves a general quadratic form
formula_186
where formula_1 is restricted to functions that satisfy the boundary conditions
formula_188
Let formula_189 be a normalization integral
formula_190
The functions formula_191 and formula_192 are required to be everywhere positive and bounded away from zero. The primary variational problem is to minimize the ratio formula_193 among all formula_1 satisfying the endpoint conditions, which is equivalent to minimizing formula_195 under the constraint that formula_196 is constant. It is shown below that the Euler–Lagrange equation for the minimizing formula_127 is
formula_198
where formula_199 is the quotient
formula_200
It can be shown (see Gelfand and Fomin 1963) that the minimizing formula_127 has two derivatives and satisfies the Euler–Lagrange equation. The associated formula_199 will be denoted by formula_203; it is the lowest eigenvalue for this equation and boundary conditions. The associated minimizing function will be denoted by formula_204 This variational characterization of eigenvalues leads to the Rayleigh–Ritz method: choose an approximating formula_127 as a linear combination of basis functions (for example trigonometric functions) and carry out a finite-dimensional minimization among such linear combinations. This method is often surprisingly accurate.

The next smallest eigenvalue and eigenfunction can be obtained by minimizing formula_206 under the additional constraint
formula_207
This procedure can be extended to obtain the complete sequence of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the problem.

The variational problem also applies to more general boundary conditions. Instead of requiring that formula_1 vanish at the endpoints, we may not impose any condition at the endpoints, and set
formula_209
where formula_210 and formula_211 are arbitrary. If we set formula_212, the first variation for the ratio formula_193 is
formula_214
where λ is given by the ratio formula_215 as previously.
After integration by parts,
formula_216
If we first require that formula_128 vanish at the endpoints, the first variation will vanish for all such formula_128 only if
formula_219
If formula_127 satisfies this condition, then the first variation will vanish for arbitrary formula_128 only if
formula_222
These latter conditions are the natural boundary conditions for this problem, since they are not imposed on trial functions for the minimization, but are instead a consequence of the minimization.

=== Eigenvalue problems in several dimensions ===
Eigenvalue problems in higher dimensions are defined in analogy with the one-dimensional case. For example, given a domain formula_118 with boundary formula_224 in three dimensions we may define
formula_225
and
formula_226
Let formula_127 be the function that minimizes the quotient formula_228
with no condition prescribed on the boundary formula_229 The Euler–Lagrange equation satisfied by formula_127 is
formula_231
where
formula_232
The minimizing formula_127 must also satisfy the natural boundary condition
formula_234
on the boundary formula_229 This result depends upon the regularity theory for elliptic partial differential equations; see Jost and Li–Jost (1998) for details. Many extensions, including completeness results, asymptotic properties of the eigenvalues and results concerning the nodes of the eigenfunctions are in Courant and Hilbert (1953).

== Applications ==

=== Optics ===
Fermat&#x27;s principle states that light takes a path that (locally) minimizes the optical length between its endpoints. If the formula_92-coordinate is chosen as the parameter along the path, and formula_237 along the path, then the optical length is given by
formula_238
where the refractive index formula_239 depends upon the material.
If we try formula_240 then the first variation of formula_241 (the derivative of formula_241 with respect to ε) is
formula_243

After integration by parts of the first term within brackets, we obtain the Euler–Lagrange equation
formula_244

The light rays may be determined by integrating this equation. This formalism is used in the context of Lagrangian optics and Hamiltonian optics.

==== Snell&#x27;s law ====
There is a discontinuity of the refractive index when light enters or leaves a lens. Let
formula_245
where formula_246 and formula_247 are constants. Then the Euler–Lagrange equation holds as before in the region where formula_248 or formula_249 and in fact the path is a straight line there, since the refractive index is constant. At the formula_250 formula_3 must be continuous, but formula_252 may be discontinuous. After integration by parts in the separate regions and using the Euler–Lagrange equations, the first variation takes the form
formula_253

The factor multiplying formula_246 is the sine of angle of the incident ray with the formula_92 axis, and the factor multiplying formula_247 is the sine of angle of the refracted ray with the formula_92 axis. Snell&#x27;s law for refraction requires that these terms be equal. As this calculation demonstrates, Snell&#x27;s law is equivalent to vanishing of the first variation of the optical path length.

==== Fermat&#x27;s principle in three dimensions ====
It is expedient to use vector notation: let formula_258 let formula_259 be a parameter, let formula_260 be the parametric representation of a curve formula_158 and let formula_262 be its tangent vector. The optical length of the curve is given by
formula_263

Note that this integral is invariant with respect to changes in the parametric representation of formula_139 The Euler–Lagrange equations for a minimizing curve have the symmetric form
formula_265
where
formula_266

It follows from the definition that formula_267 satisfies
formula_268

Therefore, the integral may also be written as
formula_269

This form suggests that if we can find a function formula_270 whose gradient is given by formula_271 then the integral formula_241 is given by the difference of formula_270 at the endpoints of the interval of integration. Thus the problem of studying the curves that make the integral stationary can be related to the study of the level surfaces of formula_274In order to find such a function, we turn to the wave equation, which governs the propagation of light. This formalism is used in the context of Lagrangian optics and Hamiltonian optics.

===== Connection with the wave equation =====
The wave equation for an inhomogeneous medium is
formula_275
where formula_181 is the velocity, which generally depends upon formula_277 Wave fronts for light are characteristic surfaces for this partial differential equation: they satisfy
formula_278

We may look for solutions in the form
formula_279

In that case, formula_270 satisfies
formula_281
where formula_282 According to the theory of first-order partial differential equations, if formula_283 then formula_267 satisfies
formula_285
along a system of curves (the light rays) that are given by
formula_286

These equations for solution of a first-order partial differential equation are identical to the Euler–Lagrange equations if we make the identification
formula_287

We conclude that the function formula_270 is the value of the minimizing integral formula_241 as a function of the upper end point. That is, when a family of minimizing curves is constructed, the values of the optical length satisfy the characteristic equation corresponding the wave equation. Hence, solving the associated partial differential equation of first order is equivalent to finding families of solutions of the variational problem. This is the essential content of the Hamilton–Jacobi theory, which applies to more general variational problems.

=== Mechanics ===

In classical mechanics, the action, formula_290 is defined as the time integral of the Lagrangian, formula_291 The Lagrangian is the difference of energies,
formula_292
where formula_293 is the kinetic energy of a mechanical system and formula_294 its potential energy. Hamilton&#x27;s principle (or the action principle) states that the motion of a conservative holonomic (integrable constraints) mechanical system is such that the action integral
formula_295
is stationary with respect to variations in the path formula_296
The Euler–Lagrange equations for this system are known as Lagrange&#x27;s equations:
formula_297
and they are equivalent to Newton&#x27;s equations of motion (for such systems).

The conjugate momenta formula_267 are defined by
formula_299
For example, if
formula_300
then formula_301
Hamiltonian mechanics results if the conjugate momenta are introduced in place of formula_302 by a Legendre transformation of the Lagrangian formula_74 into the Hamiltonian formula_304 defined by
formula_305
The Hamiltonian is the total energy of the system: formula_306
Analogy with Fermat&#x27;s principle suggests that solutions of Lagrange&#x27;s equations (the particle trajectories) may be described in terms of level surfaces of some function of formula_277 This function is a solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation:
formula_308

== Variations and sufficient condition for a minimum ==

Calculus of variations is concerned with variations of functionals, which are small changes in the functional&#x27;s value due to small changes in the function that is its argument. The first variation is defined as the linear part of the change in the functional, and the second variation is defined as the quadratic part.

For example, if formula_2 is a functional with the function formula_310 as its argument, and there is a small change in its argument from formula_1 to formula_312 where formula_313 is a function in the same function space as formula_314 then the corresponding change in the functional is
formula_315

The functional formula_2 is said to be differentiable if
formula_317
where formula_318 is a linear functional, formula_319 is the norm of formula_320 and formula_321 as formula_322 The linear functional formula_318 is the first variation of formula_2 and is denoted by,
formula_325

The functional formula_2 is said to be twice differentiable if
formula_327
where formula_328 is a linear functional (the first variation), formula_329 is a quadratic functional, and formula_321 as formula_322 The quadratic functional formula_329 is the second variation of formula_2 and is denoted by,
formula_334

The second variation formula_335 is said to be strongly positive if
formula_336
for all formula_337 and for some constant formula_338.

Using the above definitions, especially the definitions of first variation, second variation, and strongly positive, the following sufficient condition for a minimum of a functional can be stated.

<text>Eduard Gottlob Zeller (; ; 22 January 181419 March 1908) was a German philosopher and Protestant theologian of the Tübingen School of theology. He was well known for his writings on Ancient Greek philosophy, especially Pre-Socratic Philosophy, and most of all for his celebrated, multi-volume historical treatise &quot;The Philosophy of Greeks in their Historical Development&quot; (1844–52). Zeller was also a central figure in the revival of neo-Kantianism.

==Life==
Eduard Zeller was born at Kleinbottwar in Württemberg, the son of a government official. He was educated first at the Evangelical Seminaries of Maulbronn and Blaubeuren starting in 1831, and later at the University of Tübingen (the Tübinger Stift), then much under the influence of Hegel. He received his doctorate in 1836 with a thesis on Plato&#x27;s Laws. In 1840 he was &quot;Privatdozent&quot; of theology at Tübingen, in 1847 professor of theology at Berne, and in 1849 professor of theology at Marburg, where he soon shifted to the philosophy faculty as the result of disputes with the Clerical party. He became professor of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg in 1862, moved to Berlin in 1872, and retired around 1895. He remained best known for his &quot;The Philosophy of Greeks in their Historical Development&quot; (1844–52). He continued to expand and improve this work to reflect new research, and the last edition appeared in 1902. It was translated into most European languages and became the standard textbook on Greek philosophy.

Zeller also published many works on theology and three volumes of philosophical essays. He was also one of the founders of the &quot;Theologische Jahrbücher&quot; (Theological Yearbooks), a periodical which became well known as the exponent of the historical method of David Strauss and Christian Baur. He wrote much on the debate about whether theology was a kind of science (&quot;Wissenschaft&quot;). Like most of his contemporaries, including Friedrich Theodor Vischer, he began with Hegelianism, but subsequently developed a system of his own. He felt the necessity of going back to Kant and critically reconsidering the epistemological problems which, he believed, Kant had only partially resolved.

He died in Stuttgart.

==Philosophical work==
Nonetheless, his accomplishments in the history of philosophy were far more influential than his contributions as an original thinker. Zeller&#x27;s conception of the history of Greek thought was influenced by the dialectical philosophy of Hegel. Some critics maintain that Zeller was not alive enough to cultural context and to the idiosyncrasies of individual thinkers. Some hold that he laid too much stress upon Hegel&#x27;s notion of &quot;concept&quot;, and relied too much on the Hegelian antithesis of subject and object, though his history of Greek philosophy was nonetheless influential and highly regarded. He received the highest recognition, not only from philosophers and learned societies all over the world, but also from the German emperor and German people. In 1894 the Emperor Wilhelm II made him a &quot;&quot;Wirklicher Geheimrat&quot; with the title of &quot;Excellenz&quot;,&quot; and his bust, along with that of Helmholtz, was set up at the Brandenburg Gate near the statues erected to the Emperor and Empress Frederick.

The &quot;Philosophie der Griechen&quot; has been translated into English by S. F. Alleyne (2 vols, 1881) in sections: S. F. Alleyne, &quot;History of Greek Philosophy to the time of Socrates&quot; (1881) &quot;Volume 1&quot; and &quot;Volume 2&quot;; O. J. Reichel, &quot;Socrates and the Socratic Schools&quot; (1868; 2nd ed. 1877; 3rd ed. 1885); S. F. Alleyne and A. Goodwin, &quot;Plato and the Older Academy&quot; (1876); Benjamin Francis Conn Costelloe and J. H. Muirhead, &quot;Aristotle and the Earlier Peripatetics&quot; (1897)&quot;Volume 1&quot; and &quot;Volume 2&quot;; O. J. Reichel, &quot;Stoics, Epicureans and Sceptics&quot; (1870 and 1880); S. F. Alleyne, &quot;History of Eclecticism in Greek Philosophy&quot; (1883).

Zeller was also, in his &quot;Philosophie der Griechen&quot;, one of the first to use the word &#x27;Superhuman&#x27; (&quot;übermensch&quot;), later central in Nietzsche and the propaganda of the Nazi Party, in adjectival form as a technical term in philosophy. He said &quot;... thus the happiness in her can be designated superhuman (&quot;übermenschliche&quot;) while in contrast the happiness flowing from ethical virtues is merely a characteristic human good.&#x27;

== Works ==
The &quot;Philosophie&quot; appeared in an abbreviated form as &quot;Grundriss der Geschichte der Griechischen Philosophie&quot; (1883; 5th ed. 1898); English transl. by Alleyne and Evelyn Abbott (1886), under the title, &quot;Outlines of the History of Greek Philosophy&quot;.

<text>A family farm is generally understood to be a farm owned and/or operated by a family. It is sometimes considered to be an estate passed down by inheritance.

Although a recurring conceptual and archetypal distinction is that of a family farm as a smallholding versus corporate farming as large-scale agribusiness, that notion does not accurately describe the realities of farm ownership in many countries. Family farm businesses can take many forms, from smallholder farms to larger farms operated under intensive farming practices. In various countries, most farm families have structured their farm businesses as corporations (such as limited liability companies) or trusts, for liability, tax, and business purposes. Thus, the idea of a family farm as a unitary concept or definition does not easily translate across languages, cultures, or centuries, as there are substantial differences in agricultural traditions and histories between countries and between centuries within a country. For example, in U.S. agriculture, a family farm can be of any size, as long as the ownership is held within a family. A 2014 USDA report shows that family farms operate 90 percent of the nation&#x27;s farmland, and account for 85 percent of the country&#x27;s agricultural production value. However, that does not at all imply that corporate farming is a small presence in U.S. agriculture; rather, it simply reflects the fact that many corporations are closely held. In contrast, in Brazilian agriculture, the official definition of a family farm (&quot;agricultura familiar&quot;) is limited to small farms worked primarily by members of a single family; but again, this fact does not imply that corporate farming is a small presence in Brazilian agriculture; rather, it simply reflects the fact that large farms with many workers cannot be legally classified under the &quot;family farm&quot; label because that label is legally reserved for smallholdings in that country.

Farms that would not be considered family farms would be those operated as collectives, non-family corporations, or in other institutionalised forms. At least 500 million of the world&#x27;s [estimated] 570 million farms are managed by families, making family farms predominant in global agriculture.

==Definitions==
An &quot;informal discussion of the concepts and definitions&quot; in a working paper published by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 2014 reviewed English, Spanish and French definitions of the concept of &quot;family farm&quot;. 
Definitions referred to one or more of labor, management, size, provision of family livelihood, residence, family ties and generational aspects, community and social networks, subsistence orientation, patrimony, land ownership and family investment. The disparity of definitions reflects national and geographical differences in cultures, rural land tenure, and rural economies, as well as the different purposes for which definitions are coined.

The 2012 United States Census of Agriculture defines a family farm as &quot;any farm where the majority of the business is owned by the operator and individuals related to the operator, including relatives who do not live in the operator’s household&quot;; it defines a farm as &quot;any place from which $1,000 or more of agricultural products were produced and sold, or normally would have been sold, during a given year.&quot;

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations defines a &quot;family farm&quot; as one that relies primarily on family members for labour and management.

In some usages, &quot;family farm&quot; implies that the farm remains within the ownership of a family over a number of generations.

Being special-purpose definitions, the definitions found in laws or regulations may differ substantially from commonly understood meanings of &quot;family farm&quot;. For example, In the United States, under federal Farm Ownership loan regulations, the definition of a &quot;family farm&quot; does not specify the nature of farm ownership, and management of the farm is either by the borrower, or by members operating the farm when a loan is made to a corporation, co-operative or other entity. The complete definition can be found in the US Code of Federal Regulations 7 CFR 1943.4.

==History==
In the Roman Republic, &quot;latifundia&quot;, great landed estates, specialised in agriculture destined for export, producing grain, olive oil, or wine, corresponding largely to modern industrialized agriculture but depending on slave labour instead of mechanization, developed after the Second Punic War and increasingly replaced the former system of family-owned small or intermediate farms in the Roman Empire period. The basis of the latifundia in Spain and Sicily was the &quot;ager publicus&quot; that fell to the dispensation of the state through Rome&#x27;s policy of war in the 1st century BC and the 1st century AD.

In the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the largely self-sufficient villa-system of the latifundia remained among the few political-cultural centres of a fragmented Europe. These latifundia had been of great importance economically, until the long-distance shipping of wine and oil, grain and &quot;garum&quot; disintegrated, but extensive lands controlled in a single pair of hands still constituted &quot;power&quot;: it can be argued that the latifundia formed part of the economic basis of the European social feudal system, taking the form of Manorialism, the essential element of feudal society, and the organizing principle of rural economy in medieval Europe.
Manorialism was characterised by the vesting of legal and economic power in a Lord of the Manor, supported economically from his own direct landholding in a manor (sometimes called a fief), and from the obligatory contributions of a legally subject part of the peasant population under the jurisdiction of himself and his manorial court. 
Manorialism died slowly and piecemeal, along with its most vivid feature in the landscape, the open field system. 
It outlasted serfdom as it outlasted feudalism: &quot;primarily an economic organization, it could maintain a warrior, but it could equally well maintain a capitalist landlord. It could be self-sufficient, yield produce for the market, or it could yield a money rent.&quot; The last feudal dues in France were abolished at the French Revolution. In parts of eastern Germany, the &quot;Rittergut&quot; manors of Junkers remained until World War II.
The common law of the leasehold estate relation evolved in medieval England. That law still retains many archaic terms and principles pertinent to a feudal social order. Under the tenant system, a farm may be worked by the same family over many generations, but what is inherited is not the farm&#x27;s estate itself but the lease on the estate.
In much of Europe, serfdom was abolished only in the modern period, in Western Europe after the French Revolution, in Russia as late as in 1861.

In contrast to the Roman system of &quot;latifundia&quot; and the derived system of manoralism, the Germanic peoples had a system based on heritable estates owned by individual families or clans. 
The Germanic term for &quot;heritable estate, allodium&quot; was &quot;*ōþalan&quot; (Old English &quot;ēþel&quot;), which incidentally was also used as a rune name; the gnomic verse on this term in the Anglo-Saxon rune poem reads:
:&quot;[An estate] is very dear to every man, if he can enjoy there in his house whatever is right and proper in constant prosperity.&quot;

In the inheritance system known as Salic patrimony (also &quot;gavelkind&quot; in its exceptional survival in medieval Kent)
refers to this clan-based possession of real estate property, particularly in Germanic context. &quot;Terra salica&quot; could not be sold or otherwise disposed; it was not alienable. 
Much of Germanic Europe has a history of overlap or conflict between the feudal system of manoralism, where the estate is owned by noblemen and leased to the tenants or worked by serfs, and the Germanic system of free farmers working landed estates heritable within their clan or family. Historical prevalence of the Germanic system of independent estates or &quot;Höfe&quot; resulted in dispersed settlement (&quot;Streusiedlung&quot;) structure, as opposed to the village-centered settlements of manoralism.
In German-speaking Europe, a farmyard is known as a &quot;Hof&quot;; in modern German this word designates the area enclosed by the farm buildings, not the fields around them, and it is also used in other everyday situations for courtyards of any type (&quot;Hinterhof&quot; = &#x27;back yard&#x27;, etc.). The recharacterized compound &quot;Bauernhof&quot; was formed in the early modern period to designate family farming estates and today is the most common word for &#x27;farm&#x27;, while the archaic &quot;Meierhof&quot; designated a manorial estate. Historically, the unmarked term &quot;Hof&quot; was increasingly used for the royal or noble court.
The estate as a whole is referred to by the collective &quot;Gehöft&quot; (15th century); the corresponding Slavic concept being &quot;Khutor&quot;.
&quot;Höfeordnung&quot; is the German legal term for the inheritance laws regarding family farms, deriving from inheritance under medieval Saxon law. 
In England, the title of yeoman was applied to such land-owning commoners from the 15th century.

In the early modern and modern period, the dissolution of manoralism went parallel to the development of intensive farming parallel to the Industrial Revolution. Mechanization enabled the cultivation of much larger areas than what was typical for the traditional estates aimed at subsistence farming, resulting in the emergence of a smaller number of large farms, with the displaced population partly contributing to the new class of industrial wage-labourers and partly emigrating to the New World or the Russian Empire (following the 1861 emancipation of the serfs). The family farms established in Imperial Russia were again collectivized under the Soviet Union, but the emigration of European farmers displaced by the Industrial Revolution contributed to the emergence of a system of family estates in the Americas (Homestead Act of 1862).

Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s argument that a large number of family estates are a factor in ensuring the stability of democracy was repeatedly used in support of subsidies.

==Developed world==

===Perceptions of the family farm===
In developed countries the family farm is viewed sentimentally, as a lifestyle to be preserved for tradition&#x27;s sake, or as a . It is in these nations very often a political rallying cry against change in agricultural policy, most commonly in France, Japan, and the United States, where rural lifestyles are often regarded as desirable. In these countries, strange bedfellows can often be found arguing for similar measures despite otherwise vast differences in political ideology. For example, Pat Buchanan and Ralph Nader, both candidates for the office of President of the United States, held rural rallies together and spoke for measures to preserve the so-called family farm. On other economic matters they were seen as generally opposed, but found common ground on this one.

The social roles of family farms are much changed today. Until recently, staying in line with traditional and conservative sociology, the heads of the household were usually the oldest man followed closely by his oldest sons. The wife generally took care of the housework, child rearing, and financial matters pertaining to the farm. However, agricultural activities have taken on many forms and change over time. Agronomy, horticulture, aquaculture, silviculture, and apiculture, along with traditional plants and animals, all make up aspects of today&#x27;s family farm. Farm wives often need to find work away from the farm to supplement farm income and children sometimes have no interest in farming as their chosen field of work.

Bolder promoters argue that as agriculture has become more efficient with the application of modern management and new technologies in each generation, the idealized classic family farm is now simply obsolete, or more often, unable to compete without the economies of scale available to larger and more modern farms. Advocates argue that family farms in all nations need to be protected, as the basis of rural society and social stability.

===Viability===

According to the United States Department of Agriculture, ninety-eight percent of all farms in the U.S. are family farms. Two percent of farms are not family farms, and those two percent make up fourteen percent of total agricultural output in the United States, although half of them have total sales of less than $50,000 per year. Overall, ninety-one percent of farms in the United States are considered &quot;small family farms&quot; (with sales of less than $250,000 per year), and those farms produce twenty-seven percent of U.S. agricultural output.

Depending on the type and size of independently owned operation, some limiting factors are:
* Economies of scale: Larger farms are able to bargain more competitively, purchase more competitively, profit from economic highs, and weather lows more readily through monetary inertia than smaller farms.
* Cost of inputs: fertilizer and other agrichemicals can fluctuate dramatically from season to season, partially based on oil prices, a range of 25% to 200% is common over a period of a few years.
* oil prices: Directly (for farm machinery) and somewhat less directly (long-distance transport; production cost of agrichemicals), the cost of oil significantly impacts the year-to-year viability of all mechanized conventional farms.
* commodity futures: the predicted price of commodity crops, hogs, grain, etc., can determine ahead of a season what seems economically viable to grow.
* technology user agreements: a less publicly known factor, patented GE seed that is widely used for many crops, like cotton and soy, comes with restrictions on use, which can even include who the crop can be sold to.
* wholesale infrastructure: A farmer growing larger quantities of a crop than can be sold directly to consumers has to meet a range of criteria for sale into the wholesale market, which include harvest timing and graded quality, and may also include variety, therefore, the market channel really determines most aspects of the farm decisionmaking.
* availability of financing: Larger farms today often rely on lines of credit, typically from banks, to purchase the agrichemicals, and other supplies needed for each growing year. These lines are heavily affected by almost all of the other constraining factors.
* government economic intervention: In some countries, notably the US and EU, government subsidies to farmers, intended to mitigate the impact on domestic farmers of economic and political activities in other areas of the economy, can be a significant source of farm income. Bailouts, when crises such as drought or the &quot;mad cow disease&quot; problems hit agricultural sectors, are also relied on. To some large degree, this situation is a result of the large-scale global markets farms have no alternative but to participate in.
* government and industry regulation: A wide range of quotas, marketing boards and legislation governing agriculture impose complicated limits, and often require significant resources to navigate. For example, on the small farming end, in many jurisdictions, there are severe limits or prohibitions on the sale of livestock, dairy and eggs. These have arisen from pressures from all sides: food safety, environmental, industry marketing.
* real estate prices: The growth of urban centers around the world, and the resulting urban sprawl have caused the price of centrally located farmland to skyrocket, while reducing the local infrastructure necessary to support farming, putting effectively intense pressure on many farmers to sell out.

Over the 20th century, the people of developed nations have collectively taken most of the steps down the path to this situation. Individual farmers opted for successive waves of new technology, happily &quot;trading in their horses for a tractor&quot;, increasing their debt and their production capacity. This in turn required larger, more distant markets, and heavier and more complex financing. The public willingly purchased increasingly commoditized, processed, shipped and relatively inexpensive food. The availability of an increasingly diverse supply of fresh, uncured, unpreserved produce and meat in all seasons of the year (oranges in January, freshly killed steers in July, fresh pork rather than salted, smoked, or potassium-impregnated ham) opened an entirely new cuisine and an unprecedented healthy diet to millions of consumers who had never enjoyed such produce before. These abilities also brought to market an unprecedented variety of processed foods, such as corn syrup and bleached flour. For the family farm this new technology and increasingly complex marketing strategy has presented new and unprecedented challenges, and not all family farmers have been able to effectively cope with the changing market conditions.

===Local food and the organic movement===

In the last few decades there has been a resurgence of interest in organic and free range foods. A percentage of consumers have begun to question the viability of industrial agriculture practices and have turned to organic groceries that sell products produced on family farms including not only meat and produce but also such things as wheat germ breads and natural lye soaps (as opposed to bleached white breads and petroleum based detergent bars). Others buy these products direct from family farms. The &quot;new family farm&quot; provides an alternative market in some localities with an array of traditionally and naturally produced products.

Such &quot;organic&quot; and &quot;free-range&quot; farming is attainable where a significant number of affluent urban and suburban consumers willingly pay a premium for the ideals of &quot;locally produced produce&quot; and &quot;humane treatment of animals&quot;. Sometimes, these farms are hobby or part-time ventures, or supported by wealth from other sources. Viable farms on a scale sufficient to support modern families at an income level commensurate with urban and suburban upper-middle-class families are often large scale operations, both in area and capital requirements. These farms, family owned and operated in a technologically and economically conventional manner, produce crops and animal products oriented to national and international markets, rather than to local markets. In assessing this complex economic situation, it is important to consider all sources of income available to these farms; for instance, the millions of dollars in farm subsidies which the United States government offers each year. As fuel prices rise, foods shipped to national and international markets are already rising in price.

===United States===

In 2012, the United States had 2,039,093 family farms (as defined by USDA), accounting for 97 percent of all farms and 89 percent of census farm area in the United States. In 1988 Mark Friedberger warned, &quot;The farm family is a unique institution, perhaps the last remnant, in an increasingly complex world, of a simpler social order in which economic and domestic activities were inextricably bound together. In the past few years, however, American agriculture has suffered huge losses, and family farmers have seen their way of life threatened by economic forces beyond their control.&quot; However, by 1981 Ingolf Vogeler argued it was too late—the American family farm had been replaced by large agribusiness corporations pretending to be family operated.

A USDA survey conducted in 2011 estimated that family farms account for 85 percent of US farm production and 85 percent of US gross farm income. Mid-size and larger family farms account for 60 percent of US farm production and dominate US production of cotton, cash grain and hogs. Small family farms account for 26 percent of US farm production overall, and higher percentages of production of poultry, beef cattle, some other livestock and hay.

Several kinds of US family farms are recognized in USDA farm typology:

Small family farms are defined as those with annual gross cash farm income (GCFI) of less than $350,000; in 2011, these accounted for 90 percent of all US farms. Because low net farm incomes tend to predominate on such farms, most farm families on small family farms are extremely dependent on off-farm income. 
Small family farms in which the principal operator was mostly employed off-farm accounted for 42 percent of all farms and 15 percent of total US farm area; median net farm income was $788. 
Retirement family farms were small farms accounting for 16 percent of all farms and 7 percent of total US farm area; median net farm income was $5,002.

The other small family farm categories are those in which farming occupies at least 50 percent of the principal operator&#x27;s working time. These are:

Low-sales small family farms (with GCFI less than $150,000); 26 percent of all US farms, 18 percent of total US farm area, median net farm income $3,579.

Moderate-sales small family farms (with GCFI of $150,000 to $349,999); 5.44 percent of all US farms, 13 percent of total US farm area, median net farm income $67,986.

Mid-size family farms (GCFI of $350,000 to $999,999); 6 percent of all US farms, 22 percent of total US farm area; median net farm income $154,538.

Large family farms (GCFI $1,000,000 to $4,999,999); 2 percent of all US farms, 14 percent of total US farm area; median net farm income $476,234.

Very large family farms (GCFI over $5,000,000); &lt;1 percent of all US farms, 2 percent of total US farm area; median net farm income $1,910,454.

Family farms include not only sole proprietorships and family partnerships, but also family corporations. Family-owned corporations account for 5 percent of all farms and 89 percent of corporate farms in the United States. About 98 percent of US family corporations owning farms are small, with no more than 10 shareholders; average net farm income of family corporate farms was $189,400 in 2012. (In contrast, 90 percent of US non-family corporations owning farms are small, having no more than 10 shareholders; average net cash farm income for US non-family corporate farms was $270,670 in 2012.)

===Canada===

In Canada, the number of &quot;family farms&quot; cannot be inferred closely, because of the nature of census data, which do not distinguish family and non-family farm partnerships. In 2011, of Canada&#x27;s 205,730 farms, 55 percent were sole proprietorships, 25 percent were partnerships, 17 percent were family corporations, 2 percent were non-family corporations and &lt;1 percent were other categories. Because some but not all partnerships involve family members, these data suggest that family farms account for between about 73 and 97 percent of Canadian farms. The family farm percentage is likely to be near the high end of this range, for two reasons. The partners in a [Canadian] farm partnership are typically spouses, often forming the farm partnership for tax reasons. Also, as in the US, family farm succession planning can use a partnership as a means of apportioning family farm tenure among family members when a sole proprietor is ready to transfer some or all of ownership and operation of a farm to offspring. Conversion of a sole proprietorship family farm to a family corporation may also be influenced by legal and financial, e.g. tax, considerations. The Canadian Encyclopedia estimates that more than 90 percent of Canadian farms are family operations. In 2006, of Canadian farms with more than one million dollars in annual gross farm receipts, about 63 percent were family corporations and 13 percent were non-family corporations.

===Europe===
Analysis of data for 59,000 farms in the 12 member states of the European Community found that in 1989, about three-quarters of the farms were family farms, producing just over half of total agricultural output.

As of 2010, there were approximately 139,900 family farms in Ireland, with an average size of 35.7 hectares per holding. (Nearly all farms in Ireland are family farms.) In Ireland, average family farm income was 25,483 euros in 2012. Analysis by Teagasc (Ireland&#x27;s Agriculture and Food Development Authority) estimates that 37 percent of Irish farms are economically viable and an additional 30 percent are sustainable due to income from off-farm sources; 33 percent meet neither criterion and are considered economically vulnerable.

==Newly industrialized countries==

In Brazil, there are about 4.37 million family farms. These account for 84.4 percent of farms, 24.3 percent of farmland area and 37.5 percent of the value of agricultural production.

==Developing countries==
In sub-Saharan Africa, 80% of the farms were family owned and worked by 2014.

Sub-Saharan agriculture was mostly defined by slash-and-burn subsistence farming, historically spread by the Bantu expansion. 
Permanent farming estates were established during colonialism, in the 19th to 20th century. 
After decolonisation, white farmers in some African countries have tended to be attacked, killed or evicted, notably in South Africa and Zimbabwe.

In southern Africa, &quot;On peasant family farms ..., cash input costs are very low, non‐household labour is sourced largely from communal work groups through kinship ties, and support services needed to sustain production are minimal.&quot; On commercial family farms, &quot;cash input costs are high, little non‐family labour is used and strong support services are necessary.&quot;

== International Year of Family Farming ==

At the 66th session of the United Nations General Assembly, 2014 was formally declared to be the &quot;International Year of Family Farming&quot; (IYFF). The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations was invited to facilitate its implementation, in collaboration with Governments, International Development Agencies, farmers&#x27; organizations and other relevant organizations of the United Nations system as well as relevant non-governmental organizations.

The goal of the 2014 IYFF is to reposition family farming at the centre of agricultural, environmental and social policies in the national agendas by identifying gaps and opportunities to promote a shift towards a more equal and balanced development. The 2014 IYFF will promote broad discussion and cooperation at the national, regional and global levels to increase awareness and understanding of the challenges faced by smallholders and help identify efficient ways to support family farmers.

<text>Elizabeth Mary Landreaux (March 31, 1895 – March 17, 1963), known by the stage name Lizzie Miles, was an Afro-Creole blues singer in the United States.

==Biography==
Miles was born in the Faubourg Marigny neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana, in an Afro-Creole Kouri-Vini (Louisiana Creole) speaking family. As a child, she sang in her Catholic church and performed at parties and dances. She worked with Joe Oliver, Kid Ory, Bunk Johnson, and A.J. Piron from 1909 to 1911. She then toured the South, performing in theaters, circuses, and with minstrel shows owned/managed by J. Augustus Jones, Elmer H. Jones and their family. In 1917 she sang in Chicago with Manuel Manetta, and then, in 1921 with Freddie Keppard, Charlie Elgar, and again with Oliver. She moved to New York and made her first phonograph recordings in 1922. They were blues songs, but she did not like to be referred to as a blues singer since she sang a wide repertoire.

Miles toured Europe in 1924 and 1925 and then returned to New York and worked in clubs from 1926 to 1931. During this time she worked with her half-brother, Herb Morand. Miles recorded as leader of a trio with Oliver, and in a duo with Jelly Roll Morton. There is uncertainty in that some sources suggest that several of the Miss Frankie recordings were the work of Lizzie Miles. This particularly applies to the tracks &quot;When You Get Tired of Your New Sweetie&quot;, and &quot;Shooting Star Blues&quot;, issued on Conqueror Records (January 1928).

She suffered a serious illness and retired from the music industry in the 1930s, not before she recorded &quot;My Man o&#x27; War&quot;, described by one music journalist as &quot;a composition stuffed with rococo suggestiveness&quot;. Despite her illness, Miles appeared in two films in the early 1930s. She began working regularly again in 1935, performing with Paul Barbarin at the Strollers Club in New York. She sang with Fats Waller in 1938 and then worked in Chicago until she left music in 1942.

In 1950, Miles lived in California where she sang with George Lewis in 1953 and 1954. She performed and spent time with Bob Scobey in Las Vegas, Nevada, from 1955 to 1957. She sang with Joe Darensbourg in Chicago in 1958 and 1959. She returned to New Orleans, where she appeared with Freddie Kohlman and Paul Barbarin. She recorded with several Dixieland and traditional jazz bands, appeared at the Monterey Jazz Festival in 1958, and made regular radio broadcasts before retiring in 1959.

In 1959 she quit singing, except for gospel music. She began working closely with the Sisters of the Holy Family, an order of Black religious in the city, declaring that she had decided &quot;to live the life of a nun&quot;. She died of a heart attack, in March 1963, at the sisters&#x27; Lafon Nursing Home in New Orleans and was buried in the city at Saint Louis Cemetery No. 3.

Woody Allen included her version of &quot;A Good Man Is Hard to Find&quot; on the soundtrack of his 2013 film &quot;Blue Jasmine&quot;.

Her half-sister, Edna Hicks, was also a blues singer.

==Personal life==
She married August Pajaud in New Orleans, Louisiana on May 9, 1912. The marriage certificate indicates that she was 19 [&quot;sic&quot;].

She married John C. Miles, from whom she took her stage name, in Norfolk, Virginia in 1914. He was a bandleader also working for the Jones brothers. J.C. Miles died of Spanish flu in Shreveport, Louisiana on October 19, 1918 while on tour and was buried in Crown Hill Cemetery, Indianapolis, Indiana.

<doc id="171891" wikidata="Q744090" url="?curid=171891" title="List of trees native to New Zealand">
<text>New Zealand&#x27;s long geological isolation means that most of its flora is unique, with many durable hard woods. There is a wide variety of native trees, adapted to all the various micro-climates in New Zealand. The native bush (forest) ranges from the subtropical kauri forests of the northern North Island, temperate rainforests of the West Coast, the alpine forests of the Southern Alps and Fiordland to the coastal forests of the Abel Tasman National Park and the Catlins.

In the early period of British colonisation, many New Zealand trees were known by names derived from the names of unrelated European trees, but more recently the trend has been to adopt the native Māori language names into English. For a listing in order of Māori name, with species names for most, see the &quot;Flora of New Zealand&quot; list of vernacular names.

The New Zealand Plant Conservation Network has published a list of New Zealand indigenous vascular plants including all 574 native trees and shrubs. This list also identifies which trees are endemic to New Zealand and which are threatened with extinction.

<text>The peso is the currency of Chile. The current peso has circulated since 1975, with a previous version circulating between 1817 and 1960. Its symbol is defined as a letter S with either one or two vertical bars superimposed prefixing the amount, $ or ; the single-bar symbol, available in most modern text systems, is almost always used. Both of these symbols are used by many currencies, most notably the United States dollar, and may be ambiguous without clarification, such as CLP$ or . The ISO 4217 code for the present peso is CLP. It was divided into 100 &quot;centavos&quot; until 31 May 1996, when the subdivision was formally eliminated (requiring payments to be made in whole pesos). In July 2024, the exchange rate was around CLP940 to US$1.

The current peso was introduced on 29 September 1975 by decree 1,123, replacing the escudo at a rate of 1 peso for 1,000 escudos. This peso was subdivided into 100 centavos until 1984.

==Coins==
In 1975, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, and 50 centavos and 1 peso. The 1, 5, and 10 centavo coins were very similar to the 10, 50, and 100 escudo coins they replaced. Since 1983, inflation has left the centavo coins obsolete. 5 and 10 peso coins were introduced in 1976, followed by 50 and 100 peso coins in 1981 and by a bi-metallic 500 peso coin in 2000. Coins currently in circulation are in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, and 500 pesos; however, the value of the peso has depreciated enough that most retailers and others tend to use prices that are multiples of 10 pesos, ignoring smaller amounts. The 1 peso coin is rare. On 26 October 2017 the Mint stopped producing 1 and 5 peso coins, and started accepting those coins directly at the mint to exchange for larger denomination. On 1 November 2017 commercial entities began rounding off amounts for payment in cash, rounding down for amounts ending in 1 through 5 pesos, rounding up for amounts ending in 6 through 9 pesos. Electronic transactions and cheques are not affected. This change has affected various charities which had programs to accept donations at the cash register.
Shortly after the military dictatorship in Chile (1973–1990) ended, the obverse designs of the 5 and 10 peso coins were changed. Those coins had borne the image of a winged female figure wearing a classical robe and portrayed as if she had just broken a chain binding her two hands together (a length of chain could be seen hanging from each of her wrists); beside her appear the date of the coup d&#x27;état Roman numerals and the word &quot;&quot; (Spanish for &quot;liberty&quot;). After the return of democracy, a design with the portrait of Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins was adopted.

In 2001, a newly redesigned 100-peso coin bearing the image of a Mapuche woman began to circulate. In February, 2010, it was discovered that on the 2008 series of the 50 peso coins the country name &#x27; had been misspelled as &#x27;. The national mint said that it did not plan to recall the coins. Worth about US$0.09 each at the time, the faulty coins became collectors&#x27; items.

==Banknotes==

In 1976, banknotes were introduced in denominations of 5, 10, 50, and 100 pesos with the reverses of the two lowest denominations resembling those of the 5000- and 10,000-escudo notes they replaced. Inflation has since led to the issue of much higher denominations. Five-hundred-peso notes were introduced in May, 1977, followed by the 1000-peso (in June, 1978), 5000-peso (June, 1981), 10,000-peso (June, 1989), 2000-peso (December, 1997), and 20,000-peso (December, 1998) notes. The 5, 10, 50, 100, and 500-peso banknotes have been replaced by coins, leaving only the 1000, 2000, 5000, 10,000, and 20,000 peso notes in circulation. Redesigned versions of the four highest denominations were issued in 2009 and 2010. The popular new 1000-peso banknote was issued on 11 May 2011.

Since September 2004, the 2000-peso note has been issued only as a polymer banknote; the 5000-peso note began emission in polymer in September 2009; and the 1000-peso note was switched to polymer in May, 2011. This was the first time in Chilean history that a new family of banknotes was put into circulation for other cause than the effects of inflation. , only the 10,000 and 20,000 peso notes are still printed on cotton paper. All new notes have the same height, while their length varies in steps according to their face values: the shortest is the 1000-peso note and the longest is the 20,000-pesos. The new notes are substantially more difficult to falsify because of new security measures.

The design and production of the whole new family of banknotes was assigned to the Australian company Note Printing Australia Ltd for the 1000, 2000 and 5000 peso notes, and the Swedish company Crane AB for the 10,000 and 20,000 peso notes

==In popular culture==
Colloquial Chilean Spanish has informal names for some banknotes and coins. These include &quot;luca&quot; for a thousand pesos, &quot;quina&quot; for five hundred pesos (&quot;quinientos&quot; is Spanish for &quot;five hundred&quot;),&quot;gamba&quot; (&quot;prawn&quot;) for one hundred pesos (or more recently 100,000 pesos) and &quot;palo&quot;, for one million pesos. These names are old: For example, gamba and luca applied to 100 and 1000 escudos before 1975. The term &quot;gamba&quot; is a reference to the color of one hundred pesos banknote issued between 1933 and 1959.

Depending on context, a &quot;gamba&quot; might mean one hundred pesos or one hundred thousand pesos. For instance a new computer might be said to cost two &quot;gambas&quot;. This means two hundred thousand pesos. Less commonly, this applies to &quot;luca&quot;, taken to mean one million, usually referred to as &quot;palo&quot;.

The cover of the 2007 Velvet Revolver album &quot;Libertad&quot; features a stylized version of the angel from the Pinochet-era 10 pesos coin. Guitarist Slash, who personally chose the image, claimed he had no idea of the significance of it at the time.

==Value of the peso against the United States dollar==


Between 1974 and 1979, the Chilean peso was allowed to float within a crawling band. From June 1979 to 1982 the peso was pegged to the United States dollar at a fixed exchange rate. In June 1982, during that year&#x27;s economic crisis, the peso was devalued and different exchange rate regimes were used. In August 1984 the peso returned to a system of crawling bands, which were periodically adjusted to reflect differences between external and internal inflation.

Starting in September 1999, the Chilean peso was allowed to float freely against the United States dollar for the first time. Chile&#x27;s Central Bank, however, reserved the right to intervene, which it did on two occasions to counter excessive depreciation: the first, in August and September 2001, coincided with Argentina&#x27;s convertibility crisis and with the September 11 attacks in the United States. The second, in October 2002, was during Brazil&#x27;s presidential election.

During the first months of the Presidency of Gabriel Boric, the US dollar began to have a strong appreciation against the Chilean peso, among the reasons was the very strong drop in the raw material of Copper, in addition to political and economic instability due to the rise of the cost of living reaching its highest level in 20 years of 2-digit inflation of 14.1%, also due to uncertainty about the arrival of the 2022 Chilean constitutional referendum that would take place a few months later between approval and rejection and the discouraging economic figures in China led the dollar to exceed the figure of 1000 pesos for the first time in its history, reaching a price of more than 1050 pesos per dollar; after that, the Central Bank of Chile carried out its largest exchange intervention in the market, intervening on Thursday, July 14, 2022, for an amount of up to US$25,000 million starting on Monday, July 18, 2022 and until September 30. of 2022.

During 2023, the dollar has had a strong devaluation that was quoted at approximately 780 Pesos per dollar. On Friday, July 28, 2023, the Central Bank of Chile announced the strongest drop since 2009 in the monetary policy rate with a drop substantial 100 basic points from 11.25% to 10.25%, which led the dollar to have a strong rise as there began to be greater access to loans and as time deposits were not profitable, they led to reaching 860 pesos per dollar.

<doc id="171899" wikidata="Q955413" url="?curid=171899" title="Agathis australis">
<text>Agathis australis, or kauri, is a coniferous tree in the family Araucariaceae, found north of 38°S in the northern regions of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island.

It is the largest (by volume) but not tallest species of tree in New Zealand, standing up to tall in the emergent layer above the forest&#x27;s main canopy. The tree has smooth bark and small narrow leaves. Other common names to distinguish &quot;A. australis&quot; from other members of &quot;Agathis&quot; are southern kauri and New Zealand kauri.

With its podsolization capability and regeneration pattern it can compete with faster growing angiosperms. Because it is such a conspicuous species, forest containing kauri is generally known as kauri forest, although kauri need not be the most abundant tree. In the warmer northern climate, kauri forests have a higher species richness than those found further south. Kauri even act as a foundation species that modify the soil under their canopy to create unique plant communities.

==Taxonomy==
Scottish botanist David Don described the species as &quot;Dammara australis&quot;. &quot;Agathis&quot; is derived from Greek and means &#x27;ball of twine&#x27;, a reference to the shape of the male cones, which are also known by the botanical term strobili. &quot;Australis&quot; translates in English to &#x27;southern&#x27;.

==Etymology==
The Māori name is descended from Proto-Polynesian &quot;*kauquli&quot;, Samoan ebony or &quot;Diospyros samoensis&quot;.

==Description==

The young plant grows straight upwards and has the form of a narrow cone with branches going out along the length of the trunk. However, as it gains in height, the lowest branches are shed, preventing vines from climbing. By maturity, the top branches form an imposing crown that stands out over all other native trees, dominating the forest canopy.

The flaking bark of the kauri tree defends it from parasitic plants, and accumulates around the base of the trunk. On large trees it may pile up to a height of or more. The kauri has a habit of forming small clumps or patches scattered through mixed forests.

Kauri leaves are long and broad, tough and leathery in texture, with no midrib; they are arranged in opposite pairs or whorls of three on the stem. The seed cones are globose, diameter, and mature 18 to 20 months after pollination; the seed cones disintegrate at maturity to release winged seeds, which are then dispersed by the wind. A single tree produces both male and female seed cones. Fertilisation of the seeds occurs by pollination, which may be driven by the same or another tree&#x27;s pollen.

===Size===
&quot;Agathis australis&quot; can attain heights of and trunk diameters big enough to rival Californian sequoias at over . The largest kauri trees did not attain as much height or girth at ground level but contain more timber in their cylindrical trunks than comparable Sequoias with their tapering stems.

The largest recorded specimen was known as &quot;The Great Ghost&quot; and grew in the mountains at the head of the Tararu Creek, which drains into the Hauraki Gulf just north of the mouth of the Waihou River (Thames). Thames Historian Alastair Isdale says the tree was in diameter, and in girth. It was consumed by fire in .

A kauri tree at Mill Creek, Mercury Bay, known as &quot;Father of the Forests&quot; was measured in the early 1840s as in circumference and to the first branches. It was recorded as being killed by lightning in that period.

Another huge tree, &quot;Kairaru&quot;, had a girth of and a columnar trunk free of branches for as measured by a Crown Lands ranger, Henry Wilson, in 1860. It was on a spur of Mt Tutamoe about south of Waipoua Forest near Kaihau. It was destroyed in the 1880s or 1890s when a series of huge fires swept the area.

Other trees far larger than living kauri have been noted in other areas. Rumors of stumps up to are sometimes suggested in areas such as the Billygoat Track above the Kauaeranga Valley near Thames. However, there is no good evidence for these (e.g., a documented measurement or a photograph with a person for scale).

Given that over 90 per cent of the area of kauri forest standing before 1000AD was destroyed by about 1900, it is not surprising that recent records are of smaller, but still very large trees. Two large kauri fell during tropical storms in the 1970s. One of these was &quot;Toronui&quot;, in Waipoua Forest. Its diameter was larger than that of &quot;Tāne Mahuta&quot; and its clean bole larger than that of Te Matua Ngahere, and by forestry measurements was the largest standing. Another tree, Kopi, in Omahuta Forest near the standing Hokianga kauri, was the third largest with a height of and a diameter of . It fell in 1973. Like many ancient kauri both trees were partly hollow.

==Growth rate and age==
In general over the lifetime of the tree the growth rate tends to increase, reach a maximum, then decline. A 1987 study measured mean annual diameter increments ranging from per year with an overall average of per year. This is equivalent to 8.7 annual rings per centimetre of core, said to be half the commonly quoted figure for growth rate. The same study found only a weak relationship between age and diameter. The growth of kauri in planted and second-growth natural forests has been reviewed and compared during the development of growth and yield models for the species. Kauri in planted forests were found to have up to 12 times the volume productivity than those in natural stands at the same age.

Individuals in the same diameter class may vary in age by 300 years, and the largest individual on any particular site is often not the oldest. Trees can normally live longer than 600 years. Many individuals probably exceed 1000 years, but there is no conclusive evidence that trees can exceed 2000 years in age. By combining tree ring samples from living kauri, wooden buildings, and preserved swamp wood, a dendrochronology has been created which reaches back 4,500 years, the longest tree ring record of past climate change in the southern hemisphere. One 1700 year old swamp wood kauri that dates to approximately 42,000 years ago contains fine-scale carbon-14 fluctuations in its rings that may be reflective of the most recent magnetic field flip of the earth.

==Root structure and soil interaction==
Much like podocarps, it feeds in the organic litter near the surface of the soil through fine root hairs. This layer of the soil is composed of organic matter derived from falling leaves and branches as well as dead trees, and is constantly undergoing decomposition. On the other hand, broadleaf trees such as māhoe derive a good fraction of their nutrition in the deeper mineral layer of the soil. Although its feeding root system is very shallow, it also has several downwardly directed &quot;peg roots&quot; which anchor it firmly in the soil. Such a solid foundation is necessary to prevent a tree the size of a kauri from blowing over in storms and cyclones.

The litter left by kauri is much more acidic than most trees, and as it decays similarly acidic compounds are liberated. In a process known as leaching, these acidic molecules pass through the soil layers with the help of rainfall, and release other nutrients trapped in clay such as nitrogen and phosphorus. This leaves these important nutrients unavailable to other trees, as they are washed down into deeper layers. This process is known as podsolization, and changes the soil colour to a dull grey. For a single tree, this leaves an area of leached soil beneath known as a cup podsol (). This leaching process is important for kauri&#x27;s survival as it competes with other species for space.

Leaf litter and other decaying parts of a kauri decompose much more slowly than those of most other species. Besides its acidity, the plant also bears substances such as waxes and phenols, most notably tannins, that are harmful to microorganisms. This results in a large buildup of litter around the base of a mature tree in which its own roots feed. As with most perennials, these feeding roots also house a symbiotic fungi known as mycorrhiza which increase the plant&#x27;s efficiency in taking up nutrients. In this mutualistic relationship, the fungus derives its own nutrition from the roots. In its interactions with the soil, kauri is thus able to starve its competitors of much needed nutrients and compete with much younger lineages. 

The fungi on kauri are a food source for the larvae of the New Zealand giraffe weevil, &quot;Lasiorhynchus barbicornis&quot;. The larvae of &quot;L. barbicornis&quot; burrow into the wood of a tree for up to two years. Then &quot;L. barbicornis&quot; exit the bark of the tree as a fully formed adult beetle. These adult &quot;L. barbicornis&quot; exit from trees in Spring and Summer and months. After emerging from the tree, these adult &quot;L. barbicornis&quot; only live for a few weeks.

==Distribution==
===Local spatial distribution===

In terms of local topography, kauri is far from randomly dispersed. As mentioned above, kauri relies on depriving its competitors of nutrition in order to survive. However, one important consideration not discussed thus far is the slope of the land. Water on hills flows downward by the action of gravity, taking with it the nutrients in the soil. This results in a gradient from nutrient poor soil at the top of slopes to nutrient rich soils below. As nutrients leached are replaced by aqueous nitrates and phosphates from above, the kauri tree is less able to inhibit the growth of strong competitors such as angiosperms. In contrast, the leaching process is only enhanced on higher elevation. In Waipoua Forest this is reflected in higher abundances of kauri on ridge crests, and greater concentrations of its main competitors, such as tarairi, at low elevations. This pattern is known as niche partitioning, and allows more than one species to occupy the same area. Those species which live alongside kauri include tawari, a montane broadleaf tree which is normally found in higher altitudes, where nutrient cycling is naturally slow.

===Changes over recent geological time===
Kauri is found growing in its natural ecosystem north of 38°S latitude. Its southern limit stretches from the Kawhia Harbour in the west to the eastern Kaimai Range.
However, its distribution has changed greatly over geological time because of climate change. This is shown in the recent Holocene epoch by its migration southwards after the peak of the last ice age. During this time when frozen ice sheets covered much of the world&#x27;s continents, kauri was able to survive only in isolated pockets, its main refuge being in the very far north. Radiocarbon dating is one technique used by scientists to uncover the history of the tree&#x27;s distribution, with stump kauri from peat swamps used for measurement. The coldest period in recent times occurred about 15,000 to 20,000 years ago, during which time kauri was apparently confined north of Kaitaia, near the northernmost point of the North Island, North Cape. Kauri requires a mean temperature of or more for most of the year. The tree&#x27;s retreat can be used as a proxy for temperature changes during this period. While not present in modern days, the Aupōuri Peninsula in the far north was a refuge for kauri, as large quantities of kauri gum were present in the soils.

It remains unclear whether kauri recolonised the North Island from a single refuge in the far north or from scattered pockets of isolated stands that managed to survive despite climatic conditions. It spread south through Whangārei, past Dargaville and as far south as Waikato, attaining its peak distribution during the years 3000 BP to 2000 BP. There is some suggestion that it has receded somewhat since then, which may indicate temperatures have declined slightly. During the peak of its movement southwards, it was travelling as fast as per year. Its southward spread seems relatively rapid for a tree that can take a millennium to reach complete maturity. This can be explained by its life history pattern.

Kauri relies on wind for pollination and seed dispersal, while many other native trees have their seeds carried large distances by frugivores (animals which eat fruit) such as the kererū (native pigeon). However, kauri trees can produce seeds while relatively young, taking only 50 years or so before giving rise to their own offspring. This trait makes them somewhat like a pioneer species, despite the fact that their long lifespan is characteristic of K-selected species. In good conditions, where access to water and sunlight are above average, diameters in excess of and seed production can occur inside 15 years.

==Regeneration and life history==

Just as the niche of kauri is differentiated through its interactions with the soil, it also has a separate regeneration &#x27;strategy&#x27; compared to its broadleaf neighbours. The relationship is very similar to the podocarp-broadleaf forests further south. Kauri demand much more light and require larger gaps to regenerate than such broadleaf trees as pūriri and kohekohe that show far more shade tolerance. Unlike kauri, these broadleaf species can regenerate in areas where lower levels of light reach ground level, for example from a single branch falling off. Kauri trees must therefore remain alive long enough for a large disturbance to occur, allowing them sufficient light to regenerate. In areas where large amounts of forest are destroyed, such as by logging, kauri seedlings are able to regenerate much more easily due not only to increased sunlight, but their relatively strong resistance to wind and frosts. Kauri occupy the emergent layer of the forest, where they are exposed to the effects of the weather; however, the smaller trees that dominate the main canopy are sheltered both by the emergent trees above and by each other. Left in open areas without protection, these smaller trees are far less capable of regenerating.

When there is a disturbance severe enough to favour their regeneration, kauri trees regenerate en masse, producing a generation of trees of similar age after each disturbance. The distribution of kauri allows researchers to deduce when and where disturbances have occurred, and how large they may have been; the presence of abundant kauri may indicate that an area is prone to disturbance. Kauri seedlings can still occur in areas with low light but mortality rates increase for such seedlings, and those that survive self-thinning and grow to sapling stage tend to be found in higher light environments.

During periods with less disturbance kauri tends to lose ground to broadleaf competitors which can better tolerate shaded environments. In the complete absence of disturbance, kauri tends to become rare as it is excluded by its competitors. Kauri biomass tends to decrease during such times, as more biomass becomes concentrated in angiosperm species like tōwai. Kauri trees also tend to become more randomly distributed in age, with each tree dying at a different point in time, and regeneration gaps becoming rare and sporadic. Over thousands of years these varying regeneration strategies produce a tug of war effect where kauri retreats uphill during periods of calm, then takes over lower areas briefly during mass disturbances. Although such trends cannot be observed in a human lifetime, research into current patterns of distribution, behaviour of species in experimental conditions, and study of pollen sediments (see palynology) have helped shed light on the life history of kauri.

Kauri seeds may generally be taken from mature cones in late March. Each scale on a cone contains a single winged seed approximately and attached to a thin wing perhaps half as large again. The cone is fully open and dispersed within only two to three days of starting.

Studies show that kauri develop root grafts through which they share water and nutrients with neighbours of the same species.

==Ethnobotany==
===Deforestation===

Heavy logging, which began around 1820 and continued for a century, has considerably decreased the number of kauri trees. It has been estimated that before 1840, the kauri forests of northern New Zealand occupied at least . The British Royal Navy sent four vessels, HMS &quot;Coromandel&quot; (1821), HMS &quot;Dromedary&quot; (1821), (1840), and HMS &quot;Tortoise&quot; (1841) to gather kauri-wood spars.

By 1900, less than 10 per cent of the original kauri survived. By the 1950s this area had decreased to about in 47 forests depleted of their best kauri. It is estimated that today, there is 4 per cent of uncut forest left in small pockets.

Estimates are that around half of the timber was accidentally or deliberately burnt. More than half of the remainder had been exported to Australia, Britain, and other countries, while the balance was used locally to build houses and ships. Much of the timber was sold for a return sufficient only to cover wages and expenses. From 1871 to 1895 the receipts indicate a rate of about 8 shillings (around NZ$20 in 2003) per 100 superficial feet (34 shillings/m3).

The Government continued to sell large areas of kauri forests to sawmillers who, under no restrictions, took the most effective and economical steps to secure the timber, resulting in much waste and destruction. At a sale in 1908 more than 5,000 standing kauri trees, totalling about 20,000,000 superficial feet (47,000 m3), were sold for less than £2 per tree (£2 in 1908 equates to around NZ$100 in 2003). It is said that in 1890 the royalty on standing timber fell in some cases to as low as twopence (NZ$0.45 in 2003) per 100 superficial feet (8 pence/m3), though the expense of cutting and removing it to the mills was typically great due to the difficult terrain where they were located.

Probably the most controversial kauri logging decision in the last century was that of the National Government to initiate clear fell logging of the Warawara state forest (North of the Hokianga) in the late 1960s. This created a national outcry as this forest contains the second largest volume of kauri after the Waipoua forest and was until that time, essentially unlogged (Adams, 1980). The plan also involved considerable cost, requiring a long road to be driven up a steep high plateau into the heart of the protected area. Because the stands of kauri were dense, the ecological destruction in the affected plateau area (approximately a fifth of the forest by area, and a quarter by volume of timber) was essentially complete (as of the early 1990s most of the affected area contained a thick covering of native grasses with little or no kauri regeneration). Logging was stopped in fulfillment of an election pledge by the Labour Government of 1972. When the National Party was reelected in 1975, the ban on kauri logging in the Warawara remained in place, but was soon replaced by policies encouraging the logging of giant tōtara and other podocarps in the central North Island. The outcry over the Warawara was an important stepping stone towards the legal protection of the small percentage of remaining virgin kauri-podocarp forest in New Zealand&#x27;s Government-owned forests.

===Uses===

Although today its use is far more restricted, in the past the size and strength of kauri timber made it a popular wood for construction and ship building, particularly for masts of sailing ships because of its parallel grain and the absence of branches for much of its height. Kauri crown and stump wood was much appreciated for its beauty, and was sought after for ornamental wood panelling as well as high-end furniture. Although not as highly prized, the light colour of kauri trunk wood made it also well-suited for more utilitarian furniture construction, as well as for use in the fabrication of cisterns, barrels, bridge construction material, fences, moulds for metal forges, large rollers for the textile industry, railway sleepers and cross bracing for mines and tunnels.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries Kauri gum (semi-fossilised kauri resin) was a valuable commodity, particularly for varnish, spurring the development of a gum-digger industry.

Today, the kauri is being considered as a long-term carbon sink. This is because estimates of the total carbon content in living above ground biomass and dead biomass of mature kauri forest are the second highest of any forest type recorded anywhere in the world. The estimated total carbon capture is up to nearly 1000 tonnes per hectare. In this capacity, kauri are bettered only by mature &quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot; forest, and are far higher than any tropical or boreal forest type yet recorded. It is also conjectured that the process of carbon capture does not reach equilibrium, which along with no need of direct maintenance, makes kauri forests a potentially attractive alternative to short rotation forestry options such as &quot;Pinus radiata&quot;.

====Timber====
;Technical specifications
* Moisture content of dried wood: 12 per cent
* Density of wood: 560 kg/m3
* Tensile strength: 88 MPa
* Modulus of elasticity: 9.1 GPa
* After felled kauri wood dries to a 12 per cent moisture content, the tangential contraction is 4.1 per cent and the radial contraction is 2.3 per cent.
Kauri is considered a first rate timber. The whiter sapwood is generally slightly lighter in weight. Kauri is not highly resistant to rot and when used in boatbuilding must be protected from the elements with paint, varnish or epoxy to avoid rot. Its popularity with boatbuilders is due to its very long, clear lengths, its relatively light weight and its beautiful sheen when oiled or varnished. Kauri wood planes and saws easily. Its wood holds screws and nails very well and does not readily split, crack, or warp. Kauri wood darkens with age to a richer golden brown colour. Very little New Zealand kauri is now sold, and the most commonly available kauri in New Zealand is Fiji kauri, which is very similar in appearance but lighter in weight.

====Swamp kauri====
Prehistoric kauri forests have been preserved in waterlogged soils as swamp kauri. A considerable number of kauri have been found buried in salt marshes, resulting from ancient natural changes such as volcanic eruptions, sea-level changes and floods. Such trees have been radiocarbon dated to 50,000 years ago or older. The bark and the seed cones of the trees often survive together with the trunk, although when excavated and exposed to the air, these parts undergo rapid deterioration. The quality of the disinterred wood varies. Some is in good shape, comparable to that of newly felled kauri, although often lighter in colour. The colour can be improved by the use of natural wood stains to heighten the details of the grain. After a drying process, such ancient kauri can be used for furniture, but not for construction.

===Conservation===

The small remaining pockets of kauri forest in New Zealand have survived in areas that were not subjected to burning by Māori and were too inaccessible for European loggers. The largest area of mature kauri forest is Waipoua Forest in Northland. Mature and regenerating kauri can also be found in other national and regional parks such as Puketi and Omahuta Forests in Northland, the Waitākere Ranges near Auckland, and Coromandel Forest Park on the Coromandel Peninsula.

The importance of Waipoua Forest was that it is the only kauri forest retaining its former virgin condition, and that it was extensive enough to give reasonable promise of permanent survival. On 2 July 1952 an area of over of Waipoua was proclaimed a forest sanctuary after a petition to the Government.
The zoologist William Roy McGregor was one of the driving forces in this movement, writing an 80-page illustrated pamphlet on the subject, which proved an effective manifesto for conservation.
Waipoua Forest, together with the Warawara to the north, contains three quarters of New Zealand&#x27;s remaining kauri. Kauri Grove on the Coromandel Peninsula is another area with a remaining cluster of kauri, and includes the Siamese Kauri, two trees with a conjoined lower trunk.

In 1921 philanthropic Cornishman James Trounson sold to the Government for £40,000 a large area adjacent to a few acres of Crown land and said to contain at least 4,000 kauri trees. From time to time Trounson gifted additional land, until what is known as Trounson Park comprised a total of .

The most famous specimens are &quot;Tāne Mahuta&quot; and &quot;Te Matua Ngahere&quot; in Waipoua Forest. These two trees have become tourist attractions because of their size and accessibility. Tane Mahuta, named after the Māori forest god, is the biggest existing kauri with a girth of , a trunk height of , a total height of and a total volume including the crown of . Te Matua Ngahere, which means &#x27;Father of the Forest&#x27;, is smaller but stouter than Tane Mahuta, with a girth (circumference) of . Important note: all the measurements above were taken in 1971.

Kauri is common as a specimen tree in parks and gardens throughout New Zealand, prized for the distinctive look of young trees, its low maintenance once established (although seedlings are frost tender).

==Kauri dieback==

Kauri dieback was observed in the Waitākere Ranges caused by &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot; in the 1950s, again on Great Barrier Island in 1972 linked to a different pathogen, &quot;Phytophthora agathidicida&quot; and subsequently spread to kauri forest on the mainland. The disease, known as kauri dieback or kauri collar rot, is believed to be over 300 years old and causes yellowing leaves, thinning canopy, dead branches, lesions that bleed resin, and tree death.

&quot;Phytophthora agathidicida&quot; was identified as a new species in April 2008. Its closest known relative is &quot;Phytophthora katsurae&quot;. The pathogen is believed to be spread on people&#x27;s shoes or by mammals, particularly feral pigs. A collaborative response team has been formed to work on the disease. The team includes MAF Biosecurity, the Conservation Department, Auckland and Northland regional councils, Waikato Regional Council, and Bay of Plenty Regional Council. The team is charged with assessing the risk, determining methods and their feasibility to limit the spread, collecting more information (e.g. how widespread), and ensuring a coordinated response. The Department of Conservation has issued guidelines to prevent the spread of the disease, including keeping to defined tracks, cleaning footwear before and after entering kauri forest areas, and staying away from kauri roots.

<doc id="171900" wikidata="Q311747" url="?curid=171900" title="Pōhutukawa">
<text>Pōhutukawa (Metrosideros excelsa), also known as the New Zealand Christmas tree, or iron tree, is a coastal evergreen tree in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae, that produces a brilliant display of red (or occasionally orange, yellow or white) flowers, each consisting of a mass of stamens. The pōhutukawa is one of twelve &quot;Metrosideros&quot; species endemic to New Zealand. Renowned for its vibrant colour and its ability to survive even perched on rocky, precarious cliffs, it has found an important place in New Zealand culture for its strength and beauty, and is regarded as a chiefly tree (&quot;&quot;) by Māori.

==Etymology==
The generic name &quot;Metrosideros&quot; derives from the Ancient Greek &#x27; or &#x27;heartwood&#x27; and &#x27; or &#x27;iron&#x27;. The species name &quot;excelsa&quot; is from Latin &#x27;, &#x27;highest, sublime&#x27;. &#x27; is a Māori word. Its closest equivalent in other Polynesian languages is the Cook Island Māori word &#x27;, referring to a coastal shrub with white berries, &quot;Sophora tomentosa&quot;. The &quot;-hutu-&quot; part of the word comes from &#x27;, the Polynesian name for the fish-poison tree (&quot;Barringtonia asiatica&quot;; compare with and ), which has flowers similar to those of the pōhutukawa.

==Description==

Pōhutukawa grow up to high, with a spreading, dome-like form. They usually grow as a multi-trunked spreading tree. Their trunks and branches are sometimes festooned with matted, fibrous aerial roots. The oblong, leathery leaves are covered in dense white hairs underneath.

The tree flowers from November to January with a peak in early summer (mid to late December), with brilliant crimson flowers covering the tree, hence the nickname New Zealand Christmas tree. The first published reference to pōhutakawa as a Christmas tree was in 1857, in a newspaper report of a feast held by Eruera Patuone. There is variation between individual trees in the timing of flowering, and in the shade and brightness of the flowers. In isolated populations genetic drift has resulted in local variation: many of the trees growing around the Rotorua lakes produce pink-shaded flowers, and the yellow-flowered cultivar &#x27;Aurea&#x27; descends from a pair discovered in 1940 on Mōtītī Island in the Bay of Plenty. 

==Distribution==

The pōhutukawa&#x27;s natural range is the coastal regions of the North Island of New Zealand, north of a line stretching from New Plymouth (39° S) to Gisborne (38° S), where it once formed a continuous coastal fringe. By the 1990s, pastoral farming and introduced pests had reduced pōhutukawa forests by over 90%. It also occurs naturally on the shores of lakes in the Rotorua area and in Abel Tasman National Park at the top of South Island.

The tree is renowned as a cliff-dweller, able to maintain a hold in precarious, near-vertical situations. Like its Hawaiian relative the &quot;&quot; (&quot;M. polymorpha&quot;), the pōhutukawa has been shown to be efficient in the colonisation of lava plains – notably on Rangitoto, a volcanic island in the Hauraki Gulf.

==Conservation==

In New Zealand, pōhutukawa are under threat from browsing by the introduced common brushtail possum which strips the tree of its leaves. A charitable conservation trust, Project Crimson, has the aim of reversing the decline of the pōhutukawa and other &quot;Metrosideros&quot; species – its mission statement is &quot;to enable pōhutukawa and rata to flourish again in their natural habitat as icons in the hearts and minds of all New Zealanders&quot;.

== Uses ==
Pōhutukawa wood is dense, strong and highly figured. Māori used it for beaters and other small, heavy items. It was frequently used in shipbuilding, since the naturally curvy shapes made strong knees. Extracts are used in traditional Māori healing for the treatment of diarrhoea, dysentery, sore throat and wounds.

==Cultivation==
Pōhutukawa are popular in cultivation, and there are fine examples in most North Island coastal cities. Vigorous and easy to grow, the tree flourishes well south of its natural range, and has naturalised in the Wellington area and in the north of the South Island. It has also naturalised on Norfolk Island to the north. Pōhutukawa have been introduced to other countries with mild-to-warm climates, including south-eastern Australia, where it is naturalising on coastal cliffs near Sydney. In coastal California, it is a popular street and lawn tree, but has caused concern in San Francisco where its root systems are blamed for destroying sewer lines and sidewalks. In parts of South Africa, pōhutukawa grow so well that they are regarded as an invasive species. The Spanish city of A Coruña has adopted the pōhutukawa as a floral emblem.

At least 39 cultivars of pōhutukawa have been released. Duncan &amp; Davies nurseries were a leading force in the mid-20th century, while the late Graeme Platt has been responsible for 16 different cultivars so far, including a rare white-flowering tree. Cultivars include:

==Iconic pōhutukawa==
A giant pōhutukawa at Te Araroa on the East Coast is reputed to be the largest in the country, with a height of 20 metres and a spread of .

A pōhutukawa tree with an estimated age of 180 years known as &#x27;Te Hā&#x27; is fully established at an Auckland City park. &#x27;Te Hā&#x27; is the largest urban specimen in the country. Plans to build a monument in honour of victims of the Erebus Disaster in proximity to the tree activated significant local opposition in 2021.

<doc id="171902" wikidata="Q3241720" url="?curid=171902" title="Kōwhai">
<text>Kōwhai ( or ) are small woody legume trees within the genus &quot;Sophora&quot;, in the family Fabaceae, that are native to New Zealand. There are eight species, with &quot;Sophora microphylla&quot; and &quot;S. tetraptera&quot; being large trees. Their natural habitat is beside streams and on the edges of forest, in lowland or mountain open areas. Kōwhai trees grow throughout the country and are a common feature in New Zealand gardens. Outside of New Zealand, kōwhai tend to be restricted to mild temperate maritime climates.

The blooms of the kōwhai are widely regarded as being New Zealand&#x27;s unofficial national flower. As such, it is often incorporated as a visual shorthand for the country, such as in Meghan Markle&#x27;s wedding veil, which included distinctive flora representing all Commonwealth nations.

The Māori word &quot;kōwhai&quot; is related to words in some other Polynesian languages that refer to different species that look superficially similar, such as (&quot;Sesbania tomentosa&quot;), (&quot;Sesbania grandiflora&quot;) and Marquesan &quot;kohai&quot; (&quot;Caesalpinia pulcherrima&quot;). &quot;Kōwhai&quot; is also the Māori word for the colour yellow. The spelling &quot;kowhai&quot; (without a macron) is common in New Zealand English.

==Species==

The eight species of kōwhai are:
* &quot;Sophora chathamica&quot;, coastal kōwhai
* &quot;Sophora fulvida&quot;, Waitakere kōwhai
* &quot;Sophora godleyi&quot;, Godley&#x27;s kōwhai
* &quot;Sophora longicarinata&quot;, limestone kōwhai
* &quot;Sophora microphylla&quot;, small-leaved kōwhai
* &quot;Sophora molloyi&quot;, Cook Strait kōwhai
* &quot;Sophora prostrata&quot;, prostrate kōwhai
* &quot;Sophora tetraptera&quot;, large-leaved kōwhai

==Description and ecology==
Most species of kōwhai grow to around 8 m high and have fairly smooth bark with small leaves. &quot;S. microphylla&quot; has smaller leaves (0.5–0.7 cm long by 0.3–0.4 cm wide) and flowers (2.5–3.5 cm long) than &quot;S. tetraptera&quot;, which has leaves of 1–2 cm long and flowers that are 3–5 cm long.

The very distinctive seed pods that appear after flowering are almost segmented, and each contains six or more smooth, hard seeds. Most species have yellow seeds, but &quot;Sophora prostrata&quot; has black ones. The seeds of &quot;Sophora microphylla&quot; can be very numerous and the presence of many hundreds of these distinctively yellow seeds on the ground quickly identifies the presence of a nearby kōwhai tree. Many species of kōwhai are semi-deciduous and lose most of their leaves immediately after flowering in October or November, but quickly produce new leaves. Flowering of kōwhai is staggered from July through to November, meaning each tree will get attention from birds such as tūī, kererū and bellbird. Tūī are very attracted to kōwhai and will fly long distances to get a sip of its nectar.

The wood of kōwhai is dense and strong and has been used in the past for tools and machinery.

&quot;Sophora&quot; is one of the four genera of native legumes in New Zealand; the other three are &quot;Carmichaelia&quot;, &quot;Clianthus&quot;, and &quot;Montigena&quot;.

Studies of accumulated dried vegetation in the pre-human mid-late Holocene period suggests a low &quot;Sophora microphylla&quot; forest ecosystem in Central Otago that was used and perhaps maintained by giant moa birds, for both nesting material and food. The forests and moa no longer existed when European settlers came to the area in the 1850s.

==Cultivation==
Kōwhai can be grown from seed or tip cuttings in spring and autumn. The dark or bright yellow seeds germinate best after chitting and being soaked in water for several hours. They can also benefit from a several minute submersion in boiling water to soften the hard shell and then being kept in the same water, taken off boil, for several hours to soak up the water. Young kōwhai are quite frost tender, so cuttings or seedlings should be planted in their second year when they are 30 cm or higher.

If grown from seed, kōwhai can take many years to flower, the number of years varies depending on the species.

&quot;S. prostrata&quot;, sometimes called &quot;little baby&quot;, is used as a bonsai tree. It grows up to two metres high, has divaricating stems, and sparse smallish leaves.

==Toxicity==
All parts of the kōwhai, particularly the seeds, are poisonous to humans. However, there do not appear to have been any confirmed cases in humans of severe poisoning following ingestion of kōwhai in New Zealand.

==Traditional Māori use==
Traditionally the Māori used the flexible branches as a construction material in their houses and to snare birds. The kōwhai flowers were a source of yellow dye. Also, when the kōwhai flowers bloom, in late winter and early spring, it is time to plant kumara (sweet potato).

Māori also used the kōwhai tree as medicine. Wedges made of kōwhai stem were used to split wood, it was used for fences and in whare (Māori hut) construction, implements and weapons. The bark was heated in a calabash with hot stones, and made into a poultice to treat wounds or rubbed on a sore back or made into an infusion to treat bruising or muscular pains. If someone was bitten by a seal, an infusion (&quot;wai kōwhai&quot;) was prepared from kōwhai and applied to the wounds and the patient was said to recover within days.

<text>Chicago blues is a form of blues music that developed in Chicago, Illinois. It is based on earlier blues idioms, such as Delta blues, but is performed in an urban style. It developed alongside the Great Migration of African Americans of the first half of the twentieth century. Key features that distinguish Chicago blues from the earlier traditions, such as Delta blues, are the prominent use of electrified instruments (especially the electric guitar), and especially the use of electronic effects such as distortion and overdrive.

Muddy Waters, a colleague of Delta blues musicians Son House and Robert Johnson, migrated to Chicago in 1943, joining the established Big Bill Broonzy, where they developed a distinctive style of blues music. Joined by artists such as Willie Dixon, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, and John Lee Hooker, Chicago blues reached an international audience by the late 1950s and early 1960s, directly influencing not only the development of early rock and roll musicians such as Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, but also reaching across the Atlantic to influence both British blues and early hard rock acts such as Eric Clapton, the Rolling Stones, and Led Zeppelin. Prominent record labels such as Vee-Jay Records and Chess Records helped promote and spread the style. The Chicago Blues Festival has been held annually since 1984, on the anniversary of Muddy Waters&#x27; death, as a means of preserving and promoting Chicago blues.

== History ==
Urban blues evolved from classic blues following the Great Migration, or the Great Northern Drive, which was both forced and voluntary at times, of African Americans from the southern U.S. to the industrial cities of the north, such as Chicago. Big Bill Broonzy and Muddy Waters directly joined that migration, like many others, escaping the harsher southern Jim Crow laws. Bruce Iglauer, founder of Alligator Records stated that, &quot;Chicago blues is the music of the industrial city, and has an industrial sense about it.&quot; Additionally, recognizing the shift in blues, Chicago blues singer and guitarist Kevin Moore expressed the blues transition stating, &quot;You have to put some new life into it, new blood, new perspectives. You can&#x27;t keep talking about mules, workin&#x27; on the levee.&quot;
Chicago blues was heavily influenced by Mississippi bluesmen who traveled to Chicago in the early 1940s. Chicago blues is based on the sound of the electric guitar and the harmonica, with the harmonica played through a PA system or guitar amplifier, both heavily amplified and often to the point of distortion, and a rhythm section of drums and bass (double bass at first, and later electric bass guitar) with piano depending on the song or performer.

Urban blues started in Chicago and St. Louis, as music created by part-time musicians playing as street musicians, at rent parties, and other events in the black community. For example, bottleneck guitarist Kokomo Arnold was a steelworker and had a moonshine business that was far more profitable than his music.
An early incubator for Chicago blues was the open-air market on Maxwell Street, one of the largest open-air markets in the nation. Residents of the black community would frequent it to buy and sell just about anything. It was a natural location for blues musicians to perform, earn tips, and jam with other musicians. The standard path for blues musicians was to start out as street musicians and at house parties and eventually make their way to blues clubs. The first blues clubs in Chicago were mostly in predominantly black neighborhoods on the South Side, with a few in the smaller black neighborhoods on the West Side. New trends in technology, chaotic streets and bars adding drums to an electric mix, gave birth to a new club culture. One of the most famous was Ruby Lee Gatewood&#x27;s Tavern, known by patrons as &quot;The Gates&quot;. During the 1930s virtually every big-name artist played there.

What drove the blues to international influence was the promotion of record companies such as Paramount Records, RCA Victor, and Columbia Records. Through such record companies Chicago blues became a commercial enterprise. The new style of music eventually reached Europe and the United Kingdom. In the 1960s, young British musicians were highly influenced by Chicago blues resulting in the British blues movement.

According to &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Chicago blues saw its best documentation during the 1970s thanks in part to Alligator Records and its owner Bruce Iglauer, described by Robert Christgau as a &quot;folkie Leonard Chess&quot;.

==Influence of Chicago blues==
Chicago blues was one of the most significant influences on early rock music. Chuck Berry originally signed with Chess Records—one of the most significant Chicago blues record labels. Berry met and was influenced by Muddy Waters in Chicago and Waters suggested he audition for Chess. Willie Dixon and other blues musicians played on some of Berry&#x27;s early records. In the UK in the early 1960s, beat groups, such as the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, and the Animals (dubbed the British invasion in the US), were heavily influenced by Chicago blues artists. The last two served as backing musicians for Sonny Boy Williamson II and made their first recordings with him when he toured England in 1963 and 1964. At the same time, American artists, such as the Paul Butterfield Blues Band (who included two members of Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s band), John P. Hammond, and Charlie Musselwhite performed in the style of Chicago blues. Later, Cream, Rory Gallagher, and the Allman Brothers Band also pursued their own interpretations of Chicago blues songs and helped popularize blues rock.

<text>The Memory Stick is a removable flash memory card format, originally launched by Sony in late 1998. In addition to the original Memory Stick, this family includes the Memory Stick PRO, a revision that allows greater maximum storage capacity and faster file transfer speeds; Memory Stick Duo, a small-form-factor version of the Memory Stick (including the PRO Duo); the even smaller Memory Stick Micro (M2), and the Memory Stick PRO-HG, a high speed variant of the PRO to be used in high-definition video and still cameras.

As a proprietary format, Sony exclusively used Memory Stick on its products in the 2000s such as Cyber-shot digital cameras, Handycam digital camcorders, Sony Ericsson mobile phones, WEGA and Bravia TV sets, VAIO PCs, digital audio players, and the PlayStation Portable game console, with the format being licensed to a few other companies early in its lifetime. With the increasing popularity of Secure Digital around 2010, Sony started to include SD in their devices, marking a surrender by Sony of its format war in the memory-card business and the end to further serious development of the format. Despite this, Sony continues to support Memory Stick on certain newer devices through the use of adaptors.

== History ==
The original Memory Stick, which was launched in October 1998, was available in capacities up to 128 MB.

In October 1999, Sony licensed the technology to Fujitsu, Aiwa, Sanyo, Sharp, Pioneer and Kenwood, in a bid to avoid a repetition of the Betamax failure. Other companies were also licensees to the format. Some early examples of Memory Stick usage by third-party companies include Sharp&#x27;s MP3 players, Alpine&#x27;s in-dash players, and Epson&#x27;s printers.

Initially the format had a lukewarm reception, but it soon increased in popularity, especially after the licensing deal. In spring 2001, Memory Stick attained 25% market share (against CompactFlash&#x27;s 40% and SmartMedia&#x27;s 32%), up from 7% a year earlier. By May 2001, total shipment of Memory Stick units surpassed 10 million.

However the SD card, jointly developed by Toshiba, Panasonic and SanDisk, became widely popular among companies and soon became the most popular flash format by November 2003 it held 42% market share in the United States, ahead of CompactFlash&#x27;s 26% and Memory Stick with 16%. Eventually Sony itself became the only company to support the format. Sony was often criticized for the Memory Stick, as they were deemed to be expensive compared to other formats.

, it appeared that Sony had begun to combine support for SD/SDHC and Memory Stick formats in their products. All digital cameras and camcorders announced by Sony at the 2010 Consumer Electronics Show could use SD and SDHC cards as well as Memory Sticks. Furthermore, Sony announced the release of its own line of SD cards. Many claimed this development as the end of the format war between Memory Stick and SD card. However, Sony did not abandon the format at this time, and indicated that it would continue development of the format for the foreseeable future. A prime example was the development of WiFi transfers through a special Memory Stick PRO-Duo which was still in development . 

Sony&#x27;s first significant migration away from Memory Stick did not come until 2019, when it introduced the α7R IV full-frame mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera without Memory Stick support, opting instead for dual SDXC slots.

== Applications ==
Typically, Memory Sticks are used as storage media for a portable device, in a form that can easily be removed for access by a personal computer. For example, Sony digital compact cameras use Memory Stick for storing image files. With a Memory Stick-capable memory card reader a user can copy the pictures taken with the Sony digital camera to a computer. Sony typically included Memory Stick reader hardware in its first-party consumer electronics, such as digital cameras, digital music players, PDAs, cellular phones, the VAIO line of laptop computers, TV sets under the WEGA and Bravia names, and Sony&#x27;s handheld gaming device, the PlayStation Portable.

A special Memory Stick can be inserted in the hindquarters of Sony&#x27;s AIBO robot pet, to enable the use of Aiboware—software intended for use on AIBOs. The Sticks include a copy protection mechanism used by the robot, allowing users to write programs. These are referred to as &quot;programmable&quot; or &quot;programming&quot;. Only 8 MB and 16 MB versions are available.

An adapter was made for the original Memory Stick that allowed them to be used in later Sony Mavica models. This adapter, which took CR2016 cells for power, served a dual purpose of expanding storage capacity of the Mavica and giving those who did not have an existing Memory Stick drive a means of computer interfacing. With the Mavica FD92 and FD97 dedicated Memory Stick slots were added.

== Formats and form factors ==
Memory Sticks include a wide range of actual formats, including three different form factors.

=== Memory Stick ===
Introduced in July 1998. The original Memory Stick is approximately the size and thickness of a stick of chewing gum. It was available in capacities from 4 MB to 128 MB (1 MB = one million bytes). It was available both with and without MagicGate support. The MagicGate-capable memory sticks were white-colored, while the standard version was purple. The original Memory Stick is no longer manufactured.

=== Memory Stick Select ===

In response to the storage limitations of the original Memory Stick, Sony introduced the Memory Stick Select at CES 2003 on January 9. The Memory Stick Select contained two separate 128 MB partitions which the user could switch between using a physical switch on the card. This solution was fairly unpopular, but it did give users of older Memory Stick devices more capacity. Its physical size remained the same as the original Memory Stick.

=== Memory Stick PRO ===
The Memory Stick PRO, introduced on January 9, 2003, as a joint effort between Sony and SanDisk, would be the longer-lasting solution to the space problem. Most devices that use the original Memory Sticks support both the original and PRO sticks since both formats have identical form factors. Some readers that were not compatible could be upgraded to Memory Stick PRO support via a firmware update. Memory Stick PROs have a marginally higher transfer speed and a maximum &quot;theoretical&quot; capacity of 32 GB, although GB-sized capacities of more than 2GB are only available in the PRO Duo form factor. &quot;High Speed&quot; Memory Stick PROs are available, and newer devices support this high-speed mode, allowing for faster file transfers. All Memory Stick PROs larger than 1 GB support this high-speed mode, and High Speed Memory Stick PROs are backwards-compatible with devices that don&#x27;t support the high-speed mode. High-capacity Memory Sticks such as the 4 GB versions are expensive compared to other types of flash memory such as SD cards and CompactFlash. , 512 MB Memory Stick PRO can be bought.

=== Memory Stick Duo ===
Introduced in July 2002. The Memory Stick Duo was developed in response to Sony&#x27;s need for a smaller flash memory card for pocket-sized digital cameras, cell phones and the PlayStation Portable (the latter of which supported the Memory Stick PRO Duo variant). It is slightly smaller than the competing Secure Digital (SD) format and roughly two thirds the length of the standard Memory Stick form factor, but costs more. Memory Stick Duos are available with the same features as the larger standard Memory Stick, available with and without high speed mode, and with and without MagicGate support. The Memory Stick PRO Duo has replaced the Memory Stick Duo due to its 128 MB size limitation, but has kept the same form factor as the Duo.
A simple adapter allows Memory Stick Duo to be used in devices designed to accept the original Memory Stick form factor.

=== Memory Stick PRO Duo ===

The Memory Stick PRO Duo (MSPD) quickly replaced the Memory Stick Duo due to the Duo&#x27;s size limitation of 128 MB and slow transfer speed. Memory Stick PRO Duos are available in all the same variants as the larger Memory Stick PRO, with and without High Speed mode, and with and without MagicGate support.

Sony has released different versions of Memory Stick PRO Duo. A Memory Stick PRO Duo with MagicGate was released as a 512 MB stick. Additionally, a 16 GB version in March 2008 and another a 32 GB version on August 21, 2009. In 2009, Sony and SanDisk also announced the joint development of an expanded Memory Stick PRO format tentatively named &quot;Memory Stick PRO Format for Extended High Capacity&quot;. Sony has since finalized the format and released its specification under the new name, &quot;Memory Stick XC&quot; (see below).

There exist adapters for those who want to use microSD cards, on devices that only support Memory Stick PRO Duo cards, that allows those to use the storage on a microSD for files on the device in question.

=== Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo ===

On December 11, 2006, Sony, together with SanDisk, announced the Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo. While only serial and 4-bit parallel interfaces are supported in the Memory Stick PRO format, an 8-bit parallel interface was added to the Memory Stick PRO-HG format. Also, the maximum interface clock frequency was increased from 40 MHz to 60 MHz. With these enhancements, a theoretical transfer rate of 480 Mbit/s (60 MB/s) is achieved, which is three times faster than the Memory Stick PRO format.

=== Memory Stick Micro (M2) ===
In a joint venture with SanDisk, Sony released a new Memory Stick format on February 6, 2006. The Memory Stick Micro (M2) measures 15 × 12.5 × 1.2 mm (roughly one-quarter the size of the Duo) with 64 MB, 128 MB, 256 MB, 512 MB, 1 GB, 2 GB, 4 GB, 8 GB, and 16 GB capacities available. The format has a theoretical limit of 32 GB and maximum transfer speed of 160 Mbit/s. However, as with the &quot;PRO Duo&quot; format, it has been expanded through the &quot;XC&quot; series as &quot;Memory Stick XC Micro&quot; and &quot;Memory Stick XC-HG Micro&quot;, both with the &quot;theoretical&quot; maximum capacity of 2 TB.

The M2 comes with an adapter, much like the Duo Sticks, to ensure physical compatibility with Memory Stick PRO devices. However, not all devices with a PRO slot are compatible with the M2/Adapter combination, as the firmware of older devices don&#x27;t support the higher capacity of some M2 cards. One example is certain Sony CLIÉ PDAs which don&#x27;t support cards larger than 2 GB.

Sony announced on June 1, 2009, that M2 support in Sony Ericsson phones would be dropped in favor of microSD.

The Sony DSC-RX0 Mark II made a revived usage of M2 slots.

=== Memory Stick XC ===
On January 7, 2009, SanDisk and Sony announced the Memory Stick XC format (tentatively named &quot;Memory Stick Format Series for Extended High Capacity&quot; at the time). The Memory Stick XC has a maximum &quot;theoretical&quot; 2 TB capacity, 64 times larger than that of the Memory Stick PRO Duo which is limited to 32 GB. XC series has the same form factors as PRO series, and supports MagicGate content protection technology as well as Access Control function as PRO series does. In line with the rest of the industry, the XC series uses the newer exFAT file system due to size and formatting limitations of FAT/FAT16/FAT32 filesystems used in the PRO series. A maximum transfer speed of 480 Mbit/s (60 Mbyte/s) is achieved through 8-bit parallel data transfer. No Memory Stick XC cards were released to the market, likely due to domination of SD cards; its equivalent here is named SDXC and eventually became more successful than any other exFAT-based memory card format.

=== Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo HX ===
Sony announced the release of the Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo HX on May 17, 2011, which was considered the fastest card ever made by the manufacturer. It measures 20 × 31 × 1.6 mm, with 8 GB, 16 GB, or 32 GB versions available. Also, the format offers a maximum transfer speed of 50 MB/s.

== Mark 2 certification ==

As of early 2008, Mark 2-certified versions of the Memory Stick PRO Duo became available. The Mark 2 designation indicates the Memory Stick is suitable for use with AVCHD recording products or other faster Memory Stick enabled devices by providing appropriate minimum write performance.

<doc id="171905" wikidata="Q1393253" url="?curid=171905" title="Langlands program">
<text>In mathematics, the Langlands program is a set of conjectures about connections between number theory and geometry. It was proposed by . It seeks to relate Galois groups in algebraic number theory to automorphic forms and representation theory of algebraic groups over local fields and adeles. It was described by Edward Frenkel as &quot;grand unified theory of mathematics.&quot;

As an explanation to a non-specialist: the program provides constructs for a generalised and somewhat unified framework, to characterise the structures that underpin numbers and their abstractions; thus the invariants which base them through analytical methods.

The Langlands program consists of theoretical abstractions, which challenge even specialist mathematicians. Basically, the fundamental lemma of the project links the generalized fundamental representation of a finite field with its group extension to the automorphic forms under which it is invariant. This is accomplished through abstraction to higher dimensional integration, by an equivalence to a certain analytical group as an absolute extension of its algebra. This allows an analytical functional construction of powerful invariance transformations for a number field to its own algebraic structure.

The meaning of such a construction is nuanced, but its specific solutions and generalizations are far-reaching. The consequence for proof of existence to such theoretical objects, implies an analytical method for constructing the categoric mapping of fundamental structures for virtually any number field. As an analogue to the possible exact distribution of primes; the Langlands program allows a potential general tool for the resolution of invariance at the level of generalized algebraic structures. This in turn permits a somewhat unified analysis of arithmetic objects through their automorphic functions... The Langlands view allows a general analysis of structuring number-abstractions. This description is at once a reduction and over-generalization of the program&#x27;s proper theorems – although these mathematical concepts illustrate its basic ideas.

==Background==
The Langlands program is built on existing ideas: the &quot;philosophy of cusp forms&quot; formulated a few years earlier by Harish-Chandra and , the work and Harish-Chandra&#x27;s approach on semisimple Lie groups, and in technical terms the trace formula of Selberg and others.

What was new in Langlands&#x27; work, besides technical depth, was the proposed connection to number theory, together with its rich organisational structure hypothesised (so-called &quot;functoriality&quot;).

Harish-Chandra&#x27;s work exploited the principle that what can be done for one semisimple (or reductive) Lie group, can be done for all. Therefore, once the role of some low-dimensional Lie groups such as GL(2) in the theory of modular forms had been recognised, and with hindsight GL(1) in class field theory, the way was open to speculation about GL(&quot;n&quot;) for general &quot;n&quot; &gt; 2.

The &quot;cusp form&quot; idea came out of the cusps on modular curves but also had a meaning visible in spectral theory as &quot;discrete spectrum&quot;, contrasted with the &quot;continuous spectrum&quot; from Eisenstein series. It becomes much more technical for bigger Lie groups, because the parabolic subgroups are more numerous.

In all these approaches technical methods were available, often inductive in nature and based on Levi decompositions amongst other matters, but the field remained demanding.

From the perspective of modular forms, examples such as Hilbert modular forms, Siegel modular forms, and theta-series had been developed.

== Objects==
The conjectures have evolved since Langlands first stated them. Langlands conjectures apply across many different groups over many different fields for which they can be stated, and each field offers several versions of the conjectures. Some versions are vague, or depend on objects such as Langlands groups, whose existence is unproven, or on the &quot;L&quot;-group that has several non-equivalent definitions.

Objects for which Langlands conjectures can be stated:
*Representations of reductive groups over local fields (with different subcases corresponding to archimedean local fields, &quot;p&quot;-adic local fields, and completions of function fields)
*Automorphic forms on reductive groups over global fields (with subcases corresponding to number fields or function fields).
*Analogues for finite fields.
*More general fields, such as function fields over the complex numbers.

==Conjectures==
The conjectures can be stated variously in ways that are closely related but not obviously equivalent.

===Reciprocity===
The starting point of the program was Emil Artin&#x27;s reciprocity law, which generalizes quadratic reciprocity. The Artin reciprocity law applies to a Galois extension of an algebraic number field whose Galois group is abelian; it assigns &quot;L&quot;-functions to the one-dimensional representations of this Galois group, and states that these &quot;L&quot;-functions are identical to certain Dirichlet &quot;L&quot;-series or more general series (that is, certain analogues of the Riemann zeta function) constructed from Hecke characters. The precise correspondence between these different kinds of &quot;L&quot;-functions constitutes Artin&#x27;s reciprocity law.

For non-abelian Galois groups and higher-dimensional representations of them, &quot;L&quot;-functions can be defined in a natural way: Artin &quot;L&quot;-functions.

Langlands&#x27; insight was to find the proper generalization of Dirichlet &quot;L&quot;-functions, which would allow the formulation of Artin&#x27;s statement in Langland&#x27;s more general setting. Hecke had earlier related Dirichlet &quot;L&quot;-functions with automorphic forms (holomorphic functions on the upper half plane of the complex number plane formula_1 that satisfy certain functional equations). Langlands then generalized these to automorphic cuspidal representations, which are certain infinite dimensional irreducible representations of the general linear group GL(&quot;n&quot;) over the adele ring of formula_2 (the rational numbers). (This ring tracks all the completions of formula_3 see &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers.)

Langlands attached automorphic &quot;L&quot;-functions to these automorphic representations, and conjectured that every Artin &quot;L&quot;-function arising from a finite-dimensional representation of the Galois group of a number field is equal to one arising from an automorphic cuspidal representation. This is known as his reciprocity conjecture.

Roughly speaking, this conjecture gives a correspondence between automorphic representations of a reductive group and homomorphisms from a Langlands group to an &quot;L&quot;-group. This offers numerous variations, in part because the definitions of Langlands group and &quot;L&quot;-group are not fixed.

Over local fields this is expected to give a parameterization of &quot;L&quot;-packets of admissible irreducible representations of a reductive group over the local field. For example, over the real numbers, this correspondence is the Langlands classification of representations of real reductive groups. Over global fields, it should give a parameterization of automorphic forms.

===Functoriality===
The functoriality conjecture states that a suitable homomorphism of &quot;L&quot;-groups is expected to give a correspondence between automorphic forms (in the global case) or representations (in the local case). Roughly speaking, the Langlands reciprocity conjecture is the special case of the functoriality conjecture when one of the reductive groups is trivial.

====Generalized functoriality====
Langlands generalized the idea of functoriality: instead of using the general linear group GL(&quot;n&quot;), other connected reductive groups can be used. Furthermore, given such a group &quot;G&quot;, Langlands constructs the Langlands dual group &quot;LG&quot;, and then, for every automorphic cuspidal representation of &quot;G&quot; and every finite-dimensional representation of &quot;LG&quot;, he defines an &quot;L&quot;-function. One of his conjectures states that these &quot;L&quot;-functions satisfy a certain functional equation generalizing those of other known &quot;L&quot;-functions.

He then goes on to formulate a very general &quot;Functoriality Principle&quot;. Given two reductive groups and a (well behaved) morphism between their corresponding &quot;L&quot;-groups, this conjecture relates their automorphic representations in a way that is compatible with their &quot;L&quot;-functions. This functoriality conjecture implies all the other conjectures presented so far. It is of the nature of an induced representation construction—what in the more traditional theory of automorphic forms had been called a &#x27;lifting&#x27;, known in special cases, and so is covariant (whereas a restricted representation is contravariant). Attempts to specify a direct construction have only produced some conditional results.

All these conjectures can be formulated for more general fields in place of formula_2: algebraic number fields (the original and most important case), local fields, and function fields (finite extensions of F&quot;p&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) where &quot;p&quot; is a prime and F&quot;p&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the field of rational functions over the finite field with &quot;p&quot; elements).

===Geometric conjectures===
The geometric Langlands program, suggested by Gérard Laumon following ideas of Vladimir Drinfeld, arises from a geometric reformulation of the usual Langlands program that attempts to relate more than just irreducible representations. In simple cases, it relates -adic representations of the étale fundamental group of an algebraic curve to objects of the derived category of -adic sheaves on the moduli stack of vector bundles over the curve.

A 9-person collaborative project led by Dennis Gaitsgory announced a proof of the (categorical, unramified) geometric Langlands conjecture leveraging Hecke eigensheaf as part of the proof.

==Status==
The Langlands conjectures for GL(1, &quot;K&quot;) follow from (and are essentially equivalent to) class field theory.

Langlands proved the Langlands conjectures for groups over the archimedean local fields formula_5 (the real numbers) and formula_1 (the complex numbers) by giving the Langlands classification of their irreducible representations.

Lusztig&#x27;s classification of the irreducible representations of groups of Lie type over finite fields can be considered an analogue of the Langlands conjectures for finite fields.

Andrew Wiles&#x27; proof of modularity of semistable elliptic curves over rationals can be viewed as an instance of the Langlands reciprocity conjecture, since the main idea is to relate the Galois representations arising from elliptic curves to modular forms. Although Wiles&#x27; results have been substantially generalized, in many different directions, the full Langlands conjecture for formula_7 remains unproved.

In 1998, Laurent Lafforgue proved Lafforgue&#x27;s theorem verifying the Langlands conjectures for the general linear group GL(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;K&quot;) for function fields &quot;K&quot;. This work continued earlier investigations by Drinfeld, who proved the case GL(2, &quot;K&quot;) in the 1980s.

In 2018, Vincent Lafforgue established the global Langlands correspondence (the direction from automorphic forms to Galois representations) for connected reductive groups over global function fields.

===Local Langlands conjectures===
 proved the local Langlands conjectures for the general linear group GL(2, &quot;K&quot;) over local fields.

 proved the local Langlands conjectures for the general linear group GL(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;K&quot;) for positive characteristic local fields &quot;K&quot;. Their proof uses a global argument.

 proved the local Langlands conjectures for the general linear group GL(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;K&quot;) for characteristic 0 local fields &quot;K&quot;. gave another proof. Both proofs use a global argument. gave another proof.

===Fundamental lemma===
In 2008, Ngô Bảo Châu proved the &quot;fundamental lemma&quot;, which was originally conjectured by Langlands and Shelstad in 1983 and being required in the proof of some important conjectures in the Langlands program.

===Implications===
To a lay reader or even nonspecialist mathematician, abstractions within the Langlands program can be somewhat impenetrable. However, there are some strong and clear implications for proof or disproof of the fundamental Langlands conjectures. 

As the program posits a powerful connection between analytic number theory and generalizations of algebraic geometry, the idea of &#x27;Functoriality&#x27; between abstract algebraic representations of number fields and their analytical prime constructions results in powerful functional tools allowing an exact quantification of prime distributions. This, in turn, yields the capacity for classification of diophantine equations and further abstractions of algebraic functions.
Furthermore, if the reciprocity of such generalized algebras for the posited objects exists, and if their analytical functions can be shown to be well-defined, some very deep results in mathematics could be within reach of proof. Examples include: rational solutions of elliptic curves, topological construction of algebraic varieties, and the famous Riemann hypothesis. Such proofs would be expected to utilize abstract solutions in objects of generalized analytical series, each of which relates to the invariance within structures of number fields. 

Additionally, some connections between the Langlands program and M theory have been posited, as their dualities connect in nontrivial ways, providing potential exact solutions in superstring theory (as was similarly done in group theory through monstrous moonshine).

Simply put, the Langlands project implies a deep and powerful framework of solutions, which touches the most fundamental areas of mathematics, through high-order generalizations in exact solutions of algebraic equations, with analytical functions, as embedded in geometric forms. It allows a unification of many distant mathematical fields into a formalism of powerful analytical methods.

<text>Mānuka (, Leptospermum scoparium), also known as mānuka myrtle, New Zealand teatree, broom tea-tree, or just tea tree, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family Myrtaceae, native to New Zealand (including the Chatham Islands) and south-east Australia. Bees produce mānuka honey from its nectar.

==Description==
Mānuka is a prolific shrub-type tree and is often one of the first species to regenerate on cleared land. It is typically a shrub growing to tall, but can grow into a moderately sized tree, up to or so in height. It is evergreen, with dense branching and small leaves long and broad, with a short spine tip. The flowers are white, occasionally pink, – rarely up to – in diameter, with five petals. The wood is tough and hard.

Mānuka is often confused with the related species kānuka (&quot;Kunzea ericoides&quot;) – the easiest way to tell the difference between the two species in the field is to feel their foliage – mānuka leaves are prickly, while kānuka leaves are soft. Alternatively, the seed capsules of mānuka are large ( in diameter) and often remain on the plant year round, whereas the seed capsules of kānuka are much smaller ( in diameter) and are not present for much of the year.

The Latin specific epithet &quot;scoparium&quot; means &#x27;like broom&#x27;, referring to Northern Hemisphere genera such as &quot;Genista&quot; and &quot;Cytisus&quot; which it superficially resembles, but to which it is only distantly related.

==History and habitat==
Evidence suggests that &quot;L. scoparium&quot; originated in Australia before the onset of the Miocene aridity, and moved as a result of long-distance dispersal events to New Zealand from eastern Australia sometime during the last 20 million years. Cyclones and other wind activity are most likely responsible for transporting seeds long distances. Supporters of this claim cite evidence that the genus &quot;Leptospermum&quot; arose under conditions where frequent forest fires were common (i.e. in Australia, and not temperate New Zealand), because they possess fire-adaptive traits like serotiny and storage lignotubers. It has been postulated that on arrival in New Zealand, &quot;L. scoparium&quot; became established in limited edaphically suitable areas until the arrival of the Polynesian people, whose fire and forest-clearing brought about the low-nutrient-status soils for which it was preadapted in its homeland. It is now more common in New Zealand than it is in Australia. It is found throughout New Zealand, but is particularly common on the drier east coasts of the North and South Islands, and in Australia in Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales.

== Ecology ==

=== Pests and diseases ===
The adult mānuka beetle (&quot;Pyronota festiva&quot;) and its larvae feed on &quot;L. scoparium&quot; in New Zealand. The scale insect, &quot;Eriococcus orariensis&quot;, is a sap-sucking insect that feeds on &quot;L. scoparium&quot;.

=== Pollinators ===
Pollinators that visit &quot;L. scoparium&quot; include &quot;Melangyna novaezelandiae&quot;, &quot;Hylaeus&quot;, and honeybees.

=== Continued evolution ===
&quot;Leptospermum scoparium&quot; is in the process of evolutionary differentiation as a result of its isolation from fellow members of the &quot;Leptospermum&quot; genus. New studies demonstrate a loss of lignotubers among populations of &quot;Leptospermum scoparium&quot; located in relatively fire-free zones of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, while Australian and Tasmanian populations retain their lignotubers along with stronger manifestations of serotiny. Australian populations of &quot;Leptospermum scoparium&quot; are shown to be chemically distinct from their New Zealand counterparts, with significantly higher levels of cinteole and monoterpines. Chemotypical variations also exist between different populations within New Zealand, leading some to suggest that &quot;L. scoparium&quot; be divided into three subspecies: those with high pinenes, high triketones, and high sesquiterpenes. Recently, however, new research suggests that plant-to-plant variation far outstrips the variation seen between geographically isolated manuka sites, at least with regard to nectar chemistry.

==Names==
Mānuka, tea tree and &quot;&quot; are common names for this species. &quot;Jelly bush&quot; is also used in Australia to describe similar honey from &quot;Leptospermum polygalifolium&quot;. Captain Cook assigned the name tea tree, as his men would use the leaves to make a &#x27;tea&#x27; drink.

The name &quot;mānuka&quot; is from Māori spoken in New Zealand. It comes from Proto-Polynesian *&quot;nukanuka&quot; or *&quot;nuka&quot; which refers to &quot;Decaspermum fructicosum&quot; due to its similar small white flowers; it is a doublet of the aforementioned &quot;kānuka&quot; (referring to not only &quot;Kunzea ericoides&quot; but also &quot;K. robusta&quot;).

==Cultivation==
Numerous cultivars have been developed for garden use, of which the following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit: 
*(Nanum Group) &#x27;Kiwi&#x27; 
*&#x27;Nichollsii Nanum&#x27; 
*&#x27;Red Damask&#x27; 
*&#x27;Silver Sheen&#x27;

Many more cultivars are available in New Zealand but often the plant performs better in cultivation overseas. This is because in its homeland it is subject to attack by scale insects that secrete a honeydew on which grows a sooty mould that eventually debilitates the plant. Because of this, attempts have been made, with limited commercial success, to cross the showy New Zealand cultivars with mould-resistant Australian &quot;Leptospermum&quot; species.

==Uses==
The wood was often used for tool handles. Mānuka sawdust imparts a distinctive flavour when used for smoking meats and fish. It is cultivated in Australia and New Zealand for mānuka honey, produced when honeybees gather the nectar from its flowers, and for the pharmaceutical industry. It is also used for carving. An essential oil, for which many medicinal claims are made, is produced by steam distillation of its leaves. Mānuka, as it is called by most New Zealanders, was used in pre-European times by Māori, and still is. A decoction of the leaves was drunk for urinary complaints and as a febrifuge (an agent for reducing fever). The steam from leaves boiled in water was inhaled for head colds. A decoction was prepared from the leaves and bark and the warm liquid was rubbed on stiff muscles and aching joints. The emollient white gum, called &quot;pai mānuka&quot;, was given to nursing babies and also used to treat scalds and burns. Chewing the bark is said to have a relaxing effect and it enhances sleep.

==Parakeets and parasites==
Kākāriki parakeets (&quot;Cyanoramphus&quot;) use the leaves and bark of mānuka and kānuka to rid themselves of parasites. Apart from ingesting the material, they also chew it, mix it with preen gland oil and apply it to their feathers.

<text>Delta blues is one of the earliest-known styles of blues. It originated in the Mississippi Delta and is regarded as a regional variant of country blues. Guitar and harmonica are its dominant instruments; slide guitar is a hallmark of the style. Vocal styles in Delta blues range from introspective and soulful to passionate and fiery.

== Origin ==
Although Delta blues certainly existed in some form or another at the turn of the twentieth century, it was first recorded in the late 1920s, when record companies realized the potential African-American market for &quot;race records&quot;. The major labels produced the earliest recordings, consisting mostly of one person singing and playing an instrument. Live performances, however, more commonly involved a group of musicians. Record company talent scouts made some of the early recordings on field trips to the South, and some performers were invited to travel to northern cities to record. Current research suggests that Freddie Spruell is the first Delta blues artist to have been recorded; his &quot;Milk Cow Blues&quot; was recorded in Chicago in June 1926. According to Dixon and Godrich (1981), Tommy Johnson and Ishmon Bracey were recorded by Victor on that company&#x27;s second field trip to Memphis, in 1928. Robert Wilkins was first recorded by Victor in Memphis in 1928, and Big Joe Williams and Garfield Akers by Brunswick/Vocalion, also in Memphis, in 1929.

Charley Patton recorded for Paramount in Grafton, in June 1929 and May 1930. He also traveled to New York City for recording sessions in January and February 1934.

Son House first recorded in Grafton, Wisconsin, in 1930 for Paramount Records.

Robert Johnson recorded his only sessions, in San Antonio in 1936 and in Dallas in 1937, for ARC. Many other artists were recorded during this period.

Subsequently, the early Delta blues (as well as other genres) were extensively recorded by John Lomax and his son Alan Lomax, who crisscrossed the southern U.S. recording music played and sung by ordinary people, helping establish the canon of genres known today as American folk music. Their recordings, numbering in the thousands, now reside in the Smithsonian Institution. According to Dixon and Godrich (1981) and Leadbitter and Slaven (1968), Alan Lomax and the Library of Congress researchers did not record any Delta bluesmen or blueswomen prior to 1941, when he recorded Son House and Willie Brown near Lake Cormorant, Mississippi, and Muddy Waters at Stovall, Mississippi. However, among others, John and Alan Lomax recorded Lead Belly in 1933, and Bukka White in 1939.

== Female performers ==
In big-city blues, female singers such as Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, and Mamie Smith dominated the recordings of the 1920s. Although very few women were recorded playing Delta blues and other rural or folk-style blues, many performers did not get professionally recorded.

Geeshie Wiley was a blues singer and guitar player who recorded six songs for Paramount Records that were issued on three records in April 1930. According to the blues historian Don Kent, Wiley &quot;may well have been the rural South&#x27;s greatest female blues singer and musician&quot;.

L. V. Thomas, better known as Elvie Thomas, was a blues singer and guitarist from Houston, Texas, who recorded with Geeshie Wiley.

Memphis Minnie was a blues guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter whose recording career lasted for more than three decades. She recorded approximately 200 songs, some of the best known being &quot;Bumble Bee&quot;, &quot;Nothing in Rambling&quot;, and &quot;Me and My Chauffeur Blues&quot;.

Bertha Lee was a blues singer, active in the 1920s and 1930s. She recorded with and was the common-law wife of, Charley Patton.

Rosa Lee Hill, daughter of Sid Hemphill, learned guitar from her father and by the time she was ten, was playing at dances with him. Several of her songs, such as &quot;Rolled and Tumbled&quot;, were recorded by Alan Lomax between 1959 and 1960. In the late 1960s, Jo Ann Kelly (UK) started her recording career. In the 1970s, Bonnie Raitt and Phoebe Snow performed blues. 

Bonnie Raitt, Susan Tedeschi and Rory Block are contemporary female blues artists, who were influenced by Delta blues and learned from some of the most notable of the original artists still living. Sue Foley and Shannon Curfman also performed blues music.

== Influence ==

Many Delta blues artists, such as Big Joe Williams, moved to Detroit and Chicago, creating a pop-influenced city blues style. This was displaced by the new Chicago blues sound in the early 1950s, pioneered by Delta bluesmen Muddy Waters, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, and Little Walter, that was harking back to a Delta-influenced sound, but with amplified instruments.

Delta blues was also an inspiration for the creation of British skiffle music, from which eventually came the British invasion bands, while simultaneously influencing British blues that led to the birth of early hard rock and heavy metal.

<doc id="171908" wikidata="Q1054975" url="?curid=171908" title="Battle of Preveza">
<text>The Battle of Preveza (also known as Prevesa) was a naval engagement that took place on 28 September 1538 near Preveza in the Ionian Sea in northwestern Greece between an Ottoman fleet and that of a Holy League. The battle was an Ottoman victory which occurred in the same area in the Ionian Sea as the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. It was one of the three largest sea battles that took place in the sixteenth century Mediterranean, along with the Battle of Djerba and the Battle of Lepanto.

==Background==
In 1537, commanding a large Ottoman fleet, Hayreddin Barbarossa captured a number of Aegean and Ionian islands belonging to the Republic of Venice, namely Syros, Aegina, Ios, Paros, Tinos, Karpathos, Kasos, and Naxos, thus annexing the Duchy of Naxos to the Ottoman Empire. He then unsuccessfully besieged the Venetian stronghold of Corfu and ravaged the Spanish-held Calabrian coast in southern Italy.

In the face of this threat, Pope Paul III in February 1538 in assembled a ’’Holy League’’, comprising the Papal States, Habsburg Spain, the Republic of Genoa, the Republic of Venice, and the Knights of Malta, to confront Ottoman fleet under Barbarossa. Andrea Doria, the Genoese admiral in the service of Emperor Charles V was in overall command. The Papal fleet under Admiral Marco Grimani, Patriarch of Aquileia and the Venetian fleet under Vincenzo Cappello arrived first. Andrea Doria joined them with the Spanish-Genoese fleet on 22 September 1538.

Prior to Doria&#x27;s arrival, Grimani attempted to land troops near the Fortress of Preveza, but he retreated to Corfu after suffering a number of casualties in the ensuing encounter with Ottoman forces under Murat Reis. The Holy League assembled its fleet near the island of Corfu. Barbarossa was still at the island of Kos in the Aegean Sea at that time, but he soon arrived at Preveza with the rest of the Ottoman fleet, after capturing the island of Kefalonia on the way. Sinan Reis, one of his lieutenants, suggested landing troops at Actium on the Gulf of Arta near Preveza, an idea that Barbarossa initially opposed, but which later proved to be important in securing the Ottoman victory.

==Previous movements==
After locating Barbarroja, Doria stationed his armada on September 25 in front of the mouth of the gulf, where the two fleets observed each other. The situation of both armadas was a stalemate. Barbarossa could not come out of the gulf, as he would have been overwhelmed, but as the surrounding land was under Ottoman control, the Turk armada could wait comfortably. For his part, Doria would prevail in a direct battle, but he could not assault the gulf, whose mouth would have turned into a bottleneck for his ships. Also, the Genoese could not menuver freely with his sailing ships, in which artillery he trusted to, as increasingly adverse winds threatened to drive the ships into the hostile coast if they approached too much.

The only viable option for the Christians was to disembark their landing forces, eliminate the Ottoman artillery and install their own, turning the gulf against the Ottomans. They considered a plan, which would execute the Spanish Marine Infantry under the command of Francisco de Sarmiento and Álvaro de Sande, but it was ultimately discarded due to Grimani&#x27;s previous failure and because their explorers found no ideal orography and weather to safely disembark. The Ottomans attempted to built additional fortifications, which was rejected by the Christian ships&#x27; artillery fire from the coast. This composed the only exchange for the next day, as both admirals were aware of their advantages and did not dare to commit a mistake.

During the night of 27 September, Doria ordered his fleet to sail off and head 30 miles south towards Sessola, near Leucade, where they would start raiding Lepanto and the nearby Turkish positions in order to force Barbarossa to come out. The Turk admiral did so immediately, bursting out of Arta and forming his fleet in Y-shaped formation. Barbarossa was in the center with Sinan Reis, Cafer Reis, Şaban Reis and his son Hasan Reis (later Hasan Pasha). Seydi Ali Reis commanded the left wing and Salih Reis commanded the right wing. Turgut Reis, accompanied by Murat Reis, Güzelce Mehmet Reis and Sadık Reis, commanded the rear wing. Turgut Reis was with 6 large galliots and the left wing was close to the shore.

==Battle==
Christian sources give out mutually incompatible accounts about the movements and intentions of Doria, Grimani and Cappello during the battle. Venetian sources, which became the mainstream version due to their primacy and color, portray Doria as causing the defeat by his inaction, while Hispano-Genoese accounts blame Grimani and Cappello for refusing to follow his battle plan.

===Venetian account===

According to the Venetian accounts, the surprised Doria considered Barbarossa was still too close to the Ottoman-controlled shore and refrained from ordering to attack. Cappello and Grimani disagreed and pressed to capitalize on the chance as swiftly as possible, and after three hours of parliament, Doria relented and ordered the galleys to turn north, where they would reunite with sailing ships. However, weather disrupted his strategy, as a lack of wind had caused the sailing ships to lag behind, giving Barbarossa the perfect chance to reach and envelope them without leaving himself the protection of the Ottoman shore. The captains urged to make haste and help the ships, which were being surrounded and boarded by more mobile Ottoman galleys.

Doria headed with the Christian galleys towards Barbarossa, intending to intrude between the Ottomans and the coast so the enemies would be trapped between the Christian galleys and the sailing ships. However, upon reaching the battle, he turned away from the action, apparently believing Barbarossa was still too close to the coast, and hoping to make himself a bait for Barbarossa to turn towards. The Turkish admiral understood his strategy and did not give chase. The excess of tactical maneuvering exasperated Cappello and Grimani, who came to the extent of personally boarding Doria&#x27;s flagship to beg him to give battle. However, the night fell without an attempt to engage by Doria, who repeated his feint twice without success before ordering all Christian vessels to escape next morning.

===Spanish-Genoese account===

According to imperial sources, Doria ordered the fleet to be ready upon sighting Barbarossa finally leaving Arta. The Genoese admiral sent a messenger on a brigantine to call Grimani and Cappello, communicating them his intention to attack and wanting to know their readiness, which they both confirmed. Grimani considered risky to engage Barbarossa frontally, but he claimed to be willing to do it. Doria then ordered the sailing ships to head for the Ottoman left wing, intending to cut them from the coast, and then the Venetian and Papal galleys to follow them even closer to the coast envelope any Ottoman attempt to do the same to the sailing ships. However, the Christian galleys did not move, despite Doria repeated his message thrice.

As the Ottoman galleys were already surrounding the sailing ships, the Genoese admiral dispatched the Spanish Viceroy of Sicily, Ferrante Gonzaga, in another brigantine to urge Cappello and Grimani to follow his strategy. However, the allied captains replied evasively. Grimani had changed his mind and claimed he did not have superior orders from the Republic of Venice to engage in direct combat. Doria found himself only followed by nine allied galleys. He sailed around the formation calling the rest to reagroup, but many of them became entangled in the attempt to scramble, which would made them an easy prey had the sailing ships not been between Barbarossa and them. Rain started falling on them, and Doria ordered to retreat upon nightfall.

===Fights===

One way or another, the sailing ships were under attack. The huge Venetian flagship &quot;Candia&quot; or &quot;Galeone di Venezia&quot;, captained by Alessandro Condalmiero, had been left stranded 4 miles off the coast and 10 miles off Sessola. Condalmiero was surrounded by dozens of Ottoman galleys, which he initially fended off with the ship&#x27;s heavy artillery, but Barbarossa&#x27;s ships managed to position themselves on his ship&#x27;s blind spots and pepper the Venetian ship, which Condalmiero attempted to turn around in order to present broadsides. The ship fought fiercely for the entire day waiting for galleys that never came, ending up damaged in the process, although ultimately managing to avoid being captured, even after Barbarossa&#x27;s flagship joined the frey.

The Spanish and Genoese sailing ships also fought back by sheer firepower. The two main flagship, captained by Francisco Sarmiento and Juan Villegas de Figueroa, repulsed multiple Ottoman attacks. Figueroa was eventually boarded and overwhelmed, forcing his marine infantry to fight in a last stand, until the vessel received so much damage that it sank. Another ship captained by Machín de Munguía with another marine company faced another batch of dozens of Turkish galleys, becoming dismasted and severely damaged in the process, although ultimately escaping unboarded. In the rest of the sailing fleet, several ships fired back to the attackers, while in others, the crews lost hope of being helped and abandoned the ships.

By the end of the day, the Turks had sunk, destroyed or captured 128 ships and taken approximately 3,000 prisoners. The Turks did not lose any ships, but they suffered 400 dead and 800 wounded.

==Aftermath==
Dissension exploded within the Holy League due to their actions during the battle. Due to the long-standing enmity between Venice and Genoa, Cappello accused Doria of sabotaging the battle in order not to risk the Hispano-Genoese ships and preserve them for future operations outside the League, while leaving the ships of Venice, his home city&#x27;s fierce rival and the primary target of Ottoman aggression at that time, to be destroyed. Chroniclers echoed especially that Doria had inexplicably not attacked despite having a superior fleet. Sephardic scholar Joseph ha-Kohen even proposed that God had confounded Doria&#x27;s mind as a punishment for mistreating Jewish prisoners in his campaigns.

Nicolò Zen the Younger wrote his &quot;History of the War between Venice and the Turks&quot; which primarily consisted of an invective against those who had called for the war against the Ottomans in which they had behaved so ingloriously. The text was not published but a manuscript of it was circulated in his household and survived and is now held by the Biblioteca Marciana.

By Doria&#x27;s insistence, the Holy League continued the campaign and captured the fortress of Castelnuovo, present day Herceg Novi, Montenegro, hoping for it to become the beach head of an invasion of the Ottoman Balkans. However, Spaniards and Venetians quarreled again about who would garrison Castelnuovo. To ease tensions, Charles V offered Venice the fortress permanently, but the Venetians rejected the offer, claiming to lack means to defend it. The Republic had already started negotiations with the Ottomans. Barbarossa would launch an expedition to recover the fortress the following year, leading to the famed Siege of Castelnuovo. He captured almost all the remaining Christian outposts in the Ionian and Aegean Seas.

In October 1540, a peace treaty was signed between Venice and the Ottoman Empire, under which the Turks gained control of the Venetian possessions in the Peloponnese and Dalmatia and the former Venetian islands in the Aegean, Ionian and Eastern Mediterranean sea. Venice also had to pay a war compensation of 300,000 ducats in gold to the Ottoman Empire.

With the victory at Preveza and the subsequent victory at the Battle of Djerba in 1560, the Ottomans were able to repel the efforts of Venice and Spain, the two main rival powers in the Mediterranean. Ottoman superiority in large-scale fleet battles in the Mediterranean remained unchallenged until the Battle of Lepanto in 1571.

<doc id="171910" wikidata="Q164276" url="?curid=171910" title="Podocarpus totara">
<text>Podocarpus totara (), commonly known as the , is a species of podocarp tree endemic to New Zealand. It grows throughout the North Island, South Island and rarely on Stewart Island / Rakiura in lowland, montane and lower subalpine forest at elevations of up to 600 m.

Tōtara is commonly found in lowland areas where the soil is fertile and well drained. Its Māori name comes from the Proto-Polynesian word *&quot;tootara&quot; (related to the word &quot;tara&quot; lit. &#x27;thorn&#x27;) which when passed down to descendant languages refer to spiny creatures, especially the porcupinefish (&quot;Diodon hystrix&quot;) due to its spiky leaves. The spelling &quot;totara&quot; without the &quot;tohutō&quot; is also common in English.

==Description==
The tōtara is a medium to large tree, which grows slowly to around 20 to 25 m, exceptionally to 35 m; it is noted for its longevity and the great girth of its trunk. The bark peels off in papery flakes, with a purplish to golden brown hue. The sharp, dull-green, needle-like leaves are stiff and leathery, 2 cm long. This plant produces highly modified cones with two to four fused, fleshy, berry-like, juicy scales, bright red when mature. The cone contains one or two rounded seeds at the apex of the scales.
The largest known living tōtara, the Pouakani Tree, near Pureora in the central North Island, is over 35 m tall and nearly 4 m in trunk diameter at breast height. Bushmen discovered it in 1950. Other large trees are known in this area, while Whirinaki Forest, to the east, but also on deep recent volcanic soils, has groves of very tall tōtara (over 40 m in height).

Tōtara is often found regenerating on farmland, as it is not eaten by livestock.

== Varieties ==
The two varieties of tōtara are:

* &quot;P. t.&quot; var. &quot;totara&quot;
* &quot;P. t.&quot; var. &quot;waihoensis&quot;

==Related trees==
In a classic example of Antarctic flora species-pair the tōtara is very closely related to &quot;Podocarpus nubigenus&quot; from South America, to the extent that if planted together, they are very difficult to distinguish. The best distinction is the grey-green tone of the leaves, compared to the slightly brighter green of &quot;P. nubigenus&quot;.

==Cultivation==

Tōtara grows easily from fresh seed and cuttings. It has been planted in the United Kingdom as far north as Inverewe, Scotland.

Several cultivars for garden use have been introduced. These include &#x27;Albany Gold&#x27; and &#x27;Aurea&#x27;, both have yellow &#x27;gold&#x27; foliage that darkens in winter; &#x27;Pendula&#x27;, which has a weeping growth habit that is especially pronounced in young plants; &#x27;Silver Falls&#x27;, also pendulous but with cream-edged foliage; and &#x27;Matapouri Blue&#x27;, which has a conical form and glaucous foliage.

==Human use==
The wood is hard, straight-grained, and very resistant to rot, especially its heartwood. Due to its durability, tōtara wood was often used for fence posts, floor pilings, and railway sleepers. It is also prized for its carving properties, and was the primary wood used in Māori carving. It was the primary wood used to make &quot;waka&quot; (canoes) in traditional Māori boat building due to its relatively light weight (about 25% lighter than kauri), long, straight lengths, and natural oils in the wood that help prevent rotting. Tōtara could be drilled with chert points to make holes near the edges of the timber without splitting. In larger tōtara &quot;waka&quot;, three or more sections were laced together with flax rope. A tōtara &quot;waka&quot; took at least a year to make using stone adzes.

Bark from tōtara is used to cover and protect traditional pōhā bags.
