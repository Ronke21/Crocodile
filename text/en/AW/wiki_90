<text>Great Bookham is a village in the Mole Valley district, in Surrey, England, one of six semi-urban spring line settlements between the towns of Leatherhead and Guildford. With the narrow strip parish of Little Bookham, it forms part of the Saxon settlement of &quot;Bocham&quot; (&quot;the village by the beeches&quot;). The Bookhams are surrounded by common land, and Bookham railway station in Church Road, Great Bookham, serves both settlements.

The villages are astride the A246, which is the and direct route between the two towns. Once two distinct villages, the Bookhams have long been interconnected with residential roads which give the impression of one large village.

On the southern edge of the village is Polesden Lacey, a country house surrounded by more than of grounds. It is owned by the National Trust and open to the public.

==History==
According to a charter c.675, the original of which is lost but which exists in a later form, there were granted to the Abbey &quot;twenty dwellings at Bocham cum Effingham&quot;. This was confirmed by four Saxon kings; King Offa of Mercia and of the nations roundabout in 787; King Æthelstan who was &quot;King and ruler of the whole island of Britain&quot; in 933 confirmed the privileges to the monastery; King Edgar, &quot;Emperor of all Britain&quot; in 967 confirmed &quot;twelve mansiones&quot; in Bocham, and King Edward the Confessor, King of the English, in 1062 confirmed twenty mansae at Bocham cum Effingham, Driteham and Pechingeorde.

Great Bookham lay within the Anglo-Saxon administrative district of Effingham half hundred.

The Domesday Book of 1086, which was a survey for taxation purposes, makes the first known distinction between the parishes of Great and Little Bookham, if it is assumed that there was no separate parish at the time of the charter of Edward the Confessor in 1062. Driteham and Pechingeorde are both referred to in the Domesday Book and appear to have been absorbed into the manors of Effingham and Effingham East Court. Great Bookham appears in the Domesday Book in the ancient hundred of Effingham as &quot;Bocheham&quot;. It was held by St Peter&#x27;s Abbey, Chertsey. Its Domesday Assets were: 13 hides; 1 church, 1 mill worth 10s, 20 ploughs, of meadow, woodland and herbage worth 110 hogs. It rendered (in total): £15.

It seems probable, as the number of cottages in Bookham and Effingham remained constant, that the later charters must have been copies of earlier charters which were not revised to accord with the actual number of cottages at any one time.

In 1951 the civil parish had a population of 7885. On 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished.

==Polesden Lacey==

A regency villa on the southern edge of the village, Polesden Lacey has been the site of a house since at least 1336. The current house dates from the 17th century, and was bequeathed by its last owner, the Hon. Mrs. Greville, a legendary Edwardian hostess, to the National Trust in 1942. When the Grevilles purchased the property in 1906, they extensively remodelled the house with the help of Mewes and Davis, architects of the Ritz Hotel, London. There are large walled and formal gardens, an orchard and croquet lawn, as well as extensive farmland.

The property and its estate are open to the public, and is one of the National Trust&#x27;s most visited properties. The house is also the National Trust&#x27;s Southern Region head office.

The future King George VI and his bride spent part of their honeymoon at Polesden Lacey, as guests of Mrs. Greville.

The poet and playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan was a previous owner of the property from 1804.

==Bookham Grove==
To the south side of the High Street stands Bookham Grove Manor, built in the early 18th century, once owned by the Dawnay family. It is now converted into apartments, with coach houses built in its now grounds. The manor&#x27;s original large estate covered the surrounding roads up to Dorking Road, and Groveside, and had grounds to the front, running down to the Guildford Road. When the land was sold for development in 1947, the shops and car park were built in the grounds to the front of the house. Another surviving part of the estate is the stables, on the corner of Dorking Road.

==Eastwick Park==
Eastwick Park, a beautiful manor in the village, was lost in 1958. The house stood within the area of roads now known as the &#x27;Eastwick area&#x27;, and its very large private estate included Great Bookham Commons, which were saved by the village and given to the National Trust. After ceasing to be used as a private house, the manor was used by the Canadian military in World War II, and was also a school called Southey Hall, before being demolished for redevelopment. The original gates to the house stand just west of Eastwick Park Avenue on Lower Road.

==Geography==
To the west of the Bookhams lies the village of Effingham; further west on the road to Guildford lie the similar villages of East and West Horsley and East and West Clandon. To the north-east lie Fetcham and Leatherhead, north of which the area becomes increasingly urban heading towards central London, which is only away. To the south-east, across the North Downs, are the village of Westhumble and the market town of Dorking.
==Today==

The village has a short high street at its centre, which has a butcher, a family-run fishmongers, one bakery, a greengrocer and two small supermarkets.
Rayleigh House, at the top of the high street, originally built as the Victoria Temperance Hotel by Mary Chrystie, now contains an estate agents.

There are two public houses in Great Bookham: The Anchor, The Royal Oak and one in Little Bookham, Ye Olde Windsor Castle. 
Currently the Crown pub is closed.
A loose association with the latter is that the Ranger of Windsor Great Park was often appointed from the area by King Henry VIII. The Old Barn Hall is the main community centre, regularly used for staging amateur dramatics productions and hosting parties and receptions.

There are two primary schools in the village: Eastwick Junior School in Eastwick Drive and Great Bookham School (formerly The Dawnay School) in Griffin Way. There are three infant schools in Great Bookham: Polesden Lacey Infant School in Oakfield Close, Eastwick Infant School in Eastwick Drive, and Great Bookham Infant School in Griffin Way.

==Sport and leisure==

Great Bookham has a Non-League football club Bookham F.C. who play at the Chrystie Recreation Ground in the Surrey Elite Intermediate Football League. The club was founded before the First World War.

==Bookham Commons==
Bookham Commons includes the two commons in Great Bookham and Little Bookham. Great Bookham Common was bought by local residents in 1923 to save the oak woodlands, then given to the National Trust. Little Bookham Common was given to the Trust in 1924 by Mr H. Willock-Pollen, then Banks Common in 1925 by Mr R. Calburn.

The London Natural History Society has been surveying Bookham Commons for more than fifty years, making it one of the best recorded sites for wildlife in southeast England.

The common land consist of grassland (wet, low-lying meadows), woodland, scrub and twelve ponds. The ponds are home to all three British species of newt, including the rare Great Crested Newt. The five largest ponds are man-made, formed for fish production in the 17th century.

==Emergency services==
Great Bookham is served by these emergency services:
* Surrey Police (nearest police counter is at Epsom Town Hall)
* South East Coast Ambulance Service as of 1 July 2006, is the local NHS Ambulance Services Trust. The Surrey, Sussex, and Kent Ambulance services have all merged, and have now ceased to exist.
* Surrey Fire &amp; Rescue Service, Actually in Fetcham, but called Leatherhead Fire Station. 
** 1 x Water tender ladder
** 1 x Water carrier

==Notable people==
*Jane Austen, whose godfather and cousin Rev. Samuel Cooke was vicar of Great Bookham (1769-1820), is said to have spent time in Bookham whilst writing several of her novels in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Its location is consistent with the geographical details in &quot;Emma&quot;.
* Lilian Elkington, composer and pianist, lived at Ridge House, 11 Groveside, from 1948 to 1954.

<doc id="174511" wikidata="Q259132" url="?curid=174511" title="Robert Burton">
<text>Robert Burton (8 February 1577 – 25 January 1640) was an English author and fellow of Oxford University, known for his encyclopedic &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot;.

Born in 1577 to a comfortably well-off family of the landed gentry, Burton attended two grammar schools and matriculated  at Brasenose College, Oxford in 1593, age 15. Burton&#x27;s education at Oxford was unusually lengthy, possibly drawn out by an affliction of melancholy, and saw an early transfer to Christ Church. Burton received an MA and BD, and by 1607 was qualified as a tutor. As early as 1603, Burton indulged in some early literary creations at Oxford, including Latin poems, a now-lost play performed before and panned by King James I himself, and his only surviving play: an academic satire called &quot;Philosophaster&quot;. This work, though less well regarded than Burton&#x27;s masterpiece, has &quot;received more attention than most of the other surviving examples of university drama&quot;.

Sometime after obtaining his MA in 1605, Burton made some attempts to leave the university. Though he never fully succeeded, he managed to obtain the living of St Thomas the Martyr&#x27;s Church, Oxford through the university, and external patronage for the benefice of Walesby and the rectorship of Seagrave. As a fellow of Oxford, he served in many minor administrative roles and as the librarian of Christ Church Library from 1624 until his death. Over time he came to accept his &quot;sequestered&quot; existence in the libraries of Oxford, speaking highly of his alma mater throughout the &quot;Anatomy&quot;.

Burton&#x27;s most famous work and greatest achievement was &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot;. First published in 1621, it was reprinted with additions from Burton no fewer than five times. A digressive and labyrinthine work, Burton wrote as much to alleviate his own melancholy as to help others. The final edition totalled more than 500,000 words. The book is permeated by quotations from and paraphrases of many authorities, both classical and contemporary, the culmination of a lifetime of erudition.

Burton died in 1640. Within the university, his death was (probably falsely) rumoured to have been a suicide. His large personal library was divided between the Bodleian and Christ Church. The &quot;Anatomy&quot; was perused and plagiarised by many authors during his lifetime and after his death, but entered a lull in popularity through the 18th century. It was only the revelation of Laurence Sterne&#x27;s plagiarism that revived interest in Burton&#x27;s work into the 19th century, especially among the Romantics. The &quot;Anatomy&quot; received more academic attention in the 20th and 21st centuries. Whatever his popularity, Burton has always attracted distinguished readers, including Samuel Johnson, Benjamin Franklin, John Keats, William Osler, and Samuel Beckett.

==Early life and education==
===Family and grammar school===

Robert Burton was born on 8 February 1577, to Ralph Burton (1547–1619) and his wife, Dorothy (; 1560–1629), in Lindley, Leicestershire. Burton believed himself to have been conceived on 9 PM on 25 May 1576, a fact he often used in his astrological calculations. He was the second of four sons and fourth of ten children; his elder brother, William, is the only other member of the family for whom we know more than minor biographical details, as he later became a noted antiquarian and topographer. Both his parents&#x27; families were members of the landed gentry, with the Burtons from an old, if undistinguished, pedigree. Robert may have inherited his medical interest; in the &quot;Anatomy&quot;, he writes of his mother&#x27;s &quot;excellent skill in &quot;. William states a member of their mother&#x27;s family, Anthony Faunt, was said to have died from &quot;the passion of melancholy&quot;, and speaks fondly the family&#x27;s maternal relation to Arthur Faunt, a Jesuit controversialist and uncle to William and Robert.

Burton probably attended two grammar schools, the King Edward VI Grammar School, Nuneaton and Bishop Vesey&#x27;s Grammar School, Sutton Coldfield. Burton wrote in the &quot;Anatomy&quot; that students &quot;think no slavery in the world (as once I did myself) like to that of a Grammar Scholar&quot;, which some writers have taken as suggestion that he was an unhappy schoolboy. More modern biographers, such as R. L. Nochimson and Michael O&#x27;Connell, have regarded it as Burton merely presenting what was a popular sentiment, rather than hinting at any personal dislike or source of childhood melancholy.

===Oxford education===

In July 1593, aged 15, Burton matriculated into Brasenose College, Oxford, where his elder brother was already attending. Burton did not receive his Bachelor&#x27;s until 30 June 1602, and only after he migrated to Christ Church College in 1599. For the time between his matriculation and his transfer, almost nothing is known of Burton. According to Anthony à Wood, Burton &quot;made considerable progress in logic and philosophy&quot; at Brasenose, though the college left an impression sufficiently weak that Burton himself made no mention of Brasenose in his corpus. Most Oxford students would have completed their education at nineteen, but by 1602, Burton was twenty-six. Some biographers, such as Michael O&#x27;Connell and J. B. Bamborough, have cited this as evidence Burton suffered some lengthy illness while a student, possibly melancholy. Record has been found of one &quot;Robart Burton of 20 yeres&quot;, a patient of London doctor and astrologist Simon Forman, who was treated for melancholy over a period of five months in 1597. Indeed, 1596 and 1597 are the only years of Burton&#x27;s maturity in which he seems to have purchased no new books.

When he entered Christ Church in 1599, Wood reports Burton was assigned as tutor John Bancroft, &quot;for form sake, tho&#x27; he wanted not a tutor&quot;; though Bancroft was only three years his senior, he was six or seven years ahead of Burton in his studies, and was well-connected within the church, later becoming the Bishop of Oxford. It seems some friendship developed between the two; Burton praised Bancroft&#x27;s construction at Cuddesdon in the &quot;Anatomy&quot;, implying he was a frequent visitor. At Christ Church, Burton proceeded to an MA on 9 June 1605, and a BD in May 1614. Simultaneously, Burton rose through the college ranks, attaining &quot;disciplus&quot; in 1599, &quot;philosophus secundi vicenarii&quot; in 1603, and &quot;philosophus primi vicenarii&quot; in 1607, the last of which qualified him as a tutor. Sometime after he obtained his MA, Bamborough considers it likely Burton was attempting to leave the university. The college statutes required Burton to take a BD after his MA, but Burton chose not to proceed to DD.

===Early writings and plays===
While at Oxford, Burton indulged his literary interests alongside these academic ones. In 1603, on the accession of James I, Burton contributed a short Latin verse celebrating the event to a commemorative Oxford volume; he made similar offering of twenty-one poems upon James&#x27;s royal Oxford visit in 1605. On this visit, Burton took active part in the &quot;praeparation for the Kinges cominge&quot;, including a play he composed for the occasion. This play, since lost, has been identified with &quot;Alba&quot;, a pastoral comedy with a mythological subject matter, probably written in Latin. The play was performed before James I on 27 August 1605. According to a witness of the events, Philip Stringer, Burton&#x27;s play was poorly received by James and his court. The queen consort and her ladies took offence at several &quot;almost naked&quot; male actors, probably portraying satyrs, and the king was so displeased by the production that the chancellors of both Oxford and Cambridge had to plead for him to stay, as otherwise he &quot;would have gone before half the Comedy had been ended&quot;.

However Burton reacted to this royal pan, he was already at work on another play by 1606. This play, &quot;Philosophaster&quot;—which is fully extant across three manuscripts—was finished by 1615, by which time Burton was revising and correcting it. Burton speaks briefly of &quot;Philosophaster&quot; in the &quot;Anatomy&quot;, mentioning that it was performed at Christ Church on 16 February 1617, during the Shrovetide festivities. The play was acted by the students alongside three local townsmen. Burton likely took a view towards pleasing the administration in this production. The play cast the son of John King, then Dean of Christ Church, in a leading role, and departed from &quot;Alba&quot; controversial mythological themes for the less contentious ones of an academic satire.

==Appointments and the &quot;Anatomy&quot;==
===Offices at St Thomas&#x27;s, Walesby, and Seagrave===

Burton initially struggled to find any patrons for promotion out of the university, but after some time, he managed to obtain an ecclesiastical office in the living of St Thomas the Martyr&#x27;s Church, Oxford, located in the western suburb of Oxford. He was nominated to this by the of Christ Church on 29 November 1616. He was licensed to preach on 3 December 1618. Burton held this vicarage at St Thomas&#x27;s, until his death; he was responsible for the building or rebuilding of the church&#x27;s south porch in 1621, where his arms were placed on the gable.

In 1624, Lady Frances Cecil, dowager Countess of Exeter presented Burton to the Lincolnshire benefice of Walesby. Burton was perhaps the tutor of Frances&#x27; son, Robert Smith. Burton chose not to reside in Walesby, though he probably visited it at some point. He took little interest in the daily affairs of the parish—all the parish records were signed by his curate, Thomas Benson—but did win for it nine acres of land which had been taken by Frances&#x27;s predecessor. Burton resigned from this post in 1631. In the 1632 edition of the &quot;Anatomy&quot;, appended below a mention of his Walesby appointment, Burton tersely added: &quot;Lately resigned for some special reasons&quot;. After his resignation, Lady Frances temporarily turned over the duty to appoint Burton&#x27;s successor to her friend, the first Earl of Middlesex, suggesting that Burton resigned over Middlesex&#x27;s pressure to appoint his own favourite.

In 1632, shortly after this resignation from Walesby, Burton was presented to a much more valuable office by his patron, Lord Berkeley: the rectorship of Seagrave. Berkeley had been a patron of Burton since at least 1621, when Burton dedicated the &quot;Anatomy&quot; to Lord Berkeley. Their relationship may have begun even earlier, in 1619, when Berkeley matriculated from Christ Church, and perhaps entered the tutelage of Burton. In any case, on 3 September 1624, Lord Berkeley granted Burton the advowson (i.e. the right to decide the next occupant) of the wealthy living of Seagrave. This right necessitated that the holder of the advowson pick a candidate other than himself, but three days later Burton assigned three of his family members to this position, so he could procure his own future appointment. On 15 June 1632, promptly after the previous incumbent was buried, the relatives presented him to the office. Burton did not cultivate much of a reputation as a preacher while at Seagrave, choosing not to publish any of his sermons, but discharged the pastoral and charitable roles of the rectory dutifully and punctually. Burton probably visited Lindley often while at Seagrave, as the villages were only 20 miles apart. The office was the most valuable Burton ever held; in 1650, the rectory was valued at £100.

===University life===
Other than that afforded to him by the Countess of Exeter and Lord Berkeley, Burton received little preferment. Because of this, even as he received appointments outside the university, Burton remained an Oxford student for the rest of his life. Burton seems to have been, at first, unhappy with this situation; in the 1621 edition of the &quot;Anatomy&quot;, Burton wrote that his &quot;hopes were still frustrate, and I left behind, as a Dolphin on shore, confined to my Colledge, as Diogenes to his tubbe&quot;. This exasperation seems to have been passing; by the &quot;Anatomy&quot; final edition, he had revised the passage in praise of his &quot;monastick life [...] sequestered from those tumults &amp; troubles of the world&quot;, unindebted for his lack of preferment. Bamborough has gone as far as to claim it is unlikely Burton ever truly wanted to leave the college he spoke so highly of as the &quot;most flourishing College of Europe&quot;, one which &quot;can brag with Jovius, almost, in that splendor of Vaticanish retirement, confined to the company of the distinguished&quot;. The 1602 reopening of the Bodleian Library at Oxford, which by 1620 held over 16,000 volumes, gave some truth to Burton&#x27;s proud comparison of the scholarship at Oxford to that of Jovius&#x27;s Vatican.

Burton did not spend all his time in this &quot;Vaticanish retirement&quot; as a scholar. He held various minor offices in Oxford. On three occasions–in 1615, 1617, and 1618–Burton was chosen to be the clerk of the Market, one of two MA students tasked with regulating the various goods of Oxford&#x27;s markets. Now a sinecure, the office was an important institution in Burton&#x27;s time. This occupation has been cited by two biographers, O&#x27;Connell and Nochimson, to suggest, contrary to the bookish image given by his &quot;Anatomy&quot;, Burton had some knowledge of the day-to-day affairs of Oxford. Perhaps more befitting his image, on 27 August 1624, Burton became the librarian of Christ Church Library. The office was a recent creation—the first librarian was appointed in 1599, and library had been founded only a half-century earlier—but a recent donation by an Otho Nicholson had ensured it was a profitable one, tripling the incumbent&#x27;s wages to 10s a term. The duties, however, were sparse—limited to enforcing the loose regulations of the institution, and opening and closing it at the appropriate times—probably allowing Burton more than enough time to accumulate the erudition exhibited in the &quot;Anatomy&quot;. Burton held this position until his death. In 1635, painter Gilbert Jackson produced an oil portrait of Burton; this painting is now held at Brasenose College, with a copy at Christ Church.

===Publication of the &quot;Anatomy&quot;===
Whatever other activities he engaged in, composing the &quot;Anatomy&quot; was the most important pursuit and accomplishment of Burton&#x27;s life. Burton, as he claims in the preface, was &quot;as desirous to suppress my labours in this kind, as others have been to press and publish theirs&quot;, but admits that melancholy is the subject upon which he is &quot;fatally driven&quot;, and so he was compelled to compose the work. Burton left no record of when he began his work on the &quot;Anatomy&quot;. O&#x27;Connell speculates the project grew piecemeal, with research begun in his twenties, and the work well on its way by his thirties. Burton explicitly states that the study of melancholy was a lifelong fascination of his, and regularly &quot;deducted from the main channel of my studies&quot;. However long the work took, he had certainly concluded it by 5 December 1620, aged 43, when he signed the &quot;Conclusion to the Reader&quot;.

The book was printed in 1621 and, despite Burton&#x27;s indication in the &quot;Anatomy&quot; of troubles finding a publisher, it quickly sold well. Wood wrote that the publisher, Henry Cripps, made such a &quot;great profit&quot; off the book that he &quot;got an estate by it&quot;. Burton&#x27;s subject was well chosen; similar treatises by Timothie Bright and Thomas Wright had gone through several editions soon after their publication. Though Burton never divulged the extent of his profits, the size of his estate and library at death suggests they were considerable. Burton printed the Anatomy under the pseudonym of &quot;Democritus Junior&quot;, alluding to the Greek pre-Socratic philosopher, Democritus, sometimes known as the Laughing Philosopher. The use of an established classical figure in a pseudonym was common practice in Burton&#x27;s time, used to ensure the reader held no negative preconceptions about the author. Burton did not resolutely stick to this pseudonymity; the first edition betrayed it as he signed the &quot;Conclusion to the Reader&quot; with his real name, and though this was removed in later editions, the portrait of Burton added from the third edition onwards hardly preserved his anonymity.

Burton did not rest on his laurels after the first printing, continually editing and improving the work throughout his life. The first edition of Burton&#x27;s &quot;Anatomy&quot; was, with marginalia, over 350,000 words long; by his final edition this count came to over 500,000. The additions were largest for the second and third editions; the original quarto volume had to be expanded to a folio for the second edition (1624) to accommodate the expansions. For the third edition (1628), an allegorical frontispiece was added, engraved by Christian Le Blon, with a portrait of Burton atop his moniker &quot;Democritus Junior&quot;. After these two additions, Burton vowed: &quot; [do not do too much]. I will not hereafter add, alter, or retract; I have done.&quot; However, once again, Burton returned to the &quot;Anatomy&quot;, producing two more editions in 1634 and 1638. Shortly before his death in 1640, Burton entrusted an annotated copy of the &quot;Anatomy&quot; to his publisher, which was published posthumously in 1651. In total, Burton made contributions to six editions. Two more reprints of the &quot;Anatomy&quot; were made before the end of the century.

==Death==

Burton drew up his will on 15 August 1639. Five months later, aged 62 and on 25 January 1640, he was dead. The will divided his inherited estates up amongst his elder brother, William, and William&#x27;s heirs. Outside of his family, his largest bequests went, unsurprisingly, to the Bodleian and Christ Church libraries, with gifts of £100 each, and Burton&#x27;s large library split between the institutions. He also laid out several smaller monetary donations: those to his servants; the servants at Christ Church; the poor in Seagrave, Nuneaton, and Higham; the library at Brasenose; and various friends and colleagues, including John Bancroft. Burton was buried in the north aisle of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, on 27 January. William erected a monument to Robert Burton in the cathedral: a coloured effigy of Robert, flanked by an astrological representation of his nativity and geometric instruments, with a short Latin epitaph below, said to have been composed by Burton.

Writing near the close of the 17th century, John Aubrey records a rumour circulated among Oxford students, asserting that Burton took his own life. The students, according to the testimony of Wood, embellished the story to the point that Burton was supposed to have &quot;sent up his soul to heaven thro&#x27; a slip about his neck&quot; in order that the date of his death would fit his exact astrological calculations. This rumour is dubious, and has been largely rejected by biographers as far back as Wood. Angus Gowland, in his 2006 study of Burton, is among the few who take the allegation seriously, though he admits it is &quot;no more than a melancholy rumour&quot;. The story about the astrological calculation was told of astrologers before Burton, Burton rejected the endorsements of suicide by classical authors in the &quot;Anatomy&quot;, and if the rumours were taken to have had any substance at the time of his death, Burton would not have been buried in the cathedral. Gowland counters this evidence, citing the charity shown by Burton in the &quot;Anatomy&quot; for those tempted by suicide, and conjecturing a conspiracy of the &quot;notoriously close-knit College&quot; to keep Burton&#x27;s suicide secret.

== &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot; ==
Though Burton wrote elsewhere, Bamborough regards Burton&#x27;s one truly great work as &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot;. Ostensibly a three-part treatise on depression and its treatment, the book consists of quotations from, paraphrases of and commentary on numerous authors, from many fields of learning, and ranging from classical times to his contemporaries, in a &quot;tangled web of opinion and authority&quot;. According to Wood, Burton was apparently famed at Oxford employing this prose style in his speech, effortlessly recalling passages as he spoke. The &quot;Anatomy&quot; is digressive and confusing in its structure; Burton himself apologetically admitted to &quot;bring[ing] forth this confused lump&quot;, excusing himself over a shortage of time. Over the five editions, he did little to amend this confusion, preferring to append more to the labyrinthine text. The book is the fruit of a lifetime&#x27;s worth of learning, though Burton makes a point throughout the &quot;Anatomy&quot; to claim that erudition is ultimately pointless, and that it is perhaps better to remain ignorant. Nonetheless, he was of the opinion that if one had knowledge, one better display it. And he was not able to resist his impulse &quot;to have an Oare in every mans Boat&quot;, that is, to know something of every topic.

Burton wrote &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot; largely to write himself out of being a lifelong sufferer from depression. As he described his condition in the preface &quot;Democritus Junior to the Reader&quot;, &quot;a kind of imposthume in my head, which I was very desirous to be unladen of and could imagine no fitter evacuation than this ... I write of melancholy, by being busy to avoid melancholy. There is no greater cause of melancholy than idleness, no better cure than business&quot;. In his view, melancholy was &quot;a disease so frequent ... in our miserable times, as few there are that feele not the smart of it&quot;, and he said he compiled his book &quot;to prescribe means how to prevent and cure so universall a malady, an Epidemicall disease, that so often, so much crucifies the body and mind&quot;. For Burton, &quot;melancholy&quot; describes a range of mental abnormalities, from obsession to delusion to what we would now call clinical depression. Burton at once gives a multitude of remedies for melancholy, and warns they are all ultimately useless, in characteristic self-contradiction.

==&quot;Philosophaster&quot;==
&quot;Philosophaster&quot; is a play, satirising on the 17th-century university, composed in Latin during Burton&#x27;s time as an Oxford student. The plot of &quot;Philosophaster&quot; follows the university of Osuna in Andalusia, recently founded by one Desiderius, Duke of Osuna, in hope of attracting scholars. However, the university actually attracts a crowd of —pseudo-philosophers, Jesuits, and prostitutes—who con the Duke and townspeople into believing their disguises, capitalising on their naivete in a series of farcical scenes. Amidst this chaos, two true philosophers, Polumathes and Philobiblos (their names literally meaning &quot;Much-Learned&quot; and &quot;Lover of Books&quot;) appear and unmask the philosophasters. The resultant controversy among the townspeople nearly causes the Duke to close the university, but he is persuaded otherwise by Polumathes. In the comic climax, the fraudsters are branded and exiled, two characters marry, and the play concludes with a &quot;hymn in praise of philosophy [...] to the tune of Bonny Nell&quot;.

As Connie McQuillen has put it, the distinguishing quality &quot;Philosophaster&quot; is the &quot;patchwork of borrowings&quot; with which it was written. Stylistically, &quot;Philosophaster&quot; is declared on the title page to be a &quot;Comoedia Nova&quot; (or New Comedy) a satirical genre Kathryn Murphy describes as &quot;in the tradition of Plautus and Terence.&quot; Burton borrowed many elements from these Roman comedies: the tendency of characters to burst into song; the character of the clever slave; the love between a high-born man and low-born girl, who is later revealed to be of noble birth. Burton also borrows episodes from contemporary academic satires—dealing with the perennial feuds between town and gown, the distinction between &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; scholars, the ridicule of pedants—and characters from humanist satirists, chiefly Erasmus and Giovanni Pontano. The play&#x27;s depiction of alchemy bears some passing resemblance to Ben Jonson&#x27;s play &quot;The Alchemist&quot;, but Burton takes strains to point out in the introduction to a manuscript that his play was written before the first staging of Jonson&#x27;s play, in 1610.

In interpreting the &quot;Philosophaster&quot;, many authors have understood it solely in relation to the &quot;Anatomy&quot;, as an academic satire on the excesses of university life, especially that of Oxford. Angus Gowland, describing the University of Osuna as a &quot;thinly disguised Oxford&quot;, asserts that &quot;the purpose of the play was to ridicule contemporary scholarship and provoke reform&quot;, in anticipation of the &quot;Anatomy&quot; satirical themes. As O&#x27;Connell put it more succinctly, the play&#x27;s &quot;main satiric thrust, that pseudolearned charlatans find a ready haven in a university, is meant to find its general target in Oxford&quot;. This much is obvious in certain characters—such as Theanus, an elderly college administrator who has forgotten all his scholarship, but still earns an exorbitant salary tutoring the sons of the gentry—whom the audience were expected to be familiar with within academia. However, critic Kathryn Murphy has pointed out that &quot;Philosophaster&quot; contains a significant, and often underappreciated, undercurrent of anti-Catholicism. Burton&#x27;s philosophasters are joined by the representatives of Roman Catholicism, including scholastics and Jesuits, in their mockery of philosophy and the university. Murphy has suggested these themes reflect the pervading cultural influence of the Gunpowder Plot in Burton&#x27;s lifetime, which took place a year before the play was set.

==Personal life==
===Character===

Burton has often been portrayed as something of a recluse, especially by those authors influenced by the Romantic view of Burton. Early 20th-century critic Floyd Dell imagined Burton &quot;hedged within his cloister, his heart yearn[ing] after the romance of adventure&quot;. Later biographers have been keen to dispel this image, and emphasise that Burton had a life outside of his books. He was no doubt an active part in the non-academic daily life of Oxford, through his university-appointed roles in its church and market life, and Bamborough adds that in his day he &quot;was known as a mathematician and as both an astrologer and an astronomer, and even had some reputation as a surveyor&quot;. Wood also notes that Burton&#x27;s unsurpassed skill at including &quot;verses from the poets or sentences from classical authors&quot; in his everyday speech, &quot;then all the fashion in the university&quot;, allowed him some popularity. However, Burton&#x27;s &quot;most significant occupations during his life were reading and writing&quot;, and his large library is evidence enough of this prodigious bookishness.

Burton&#x27;s melancholy is the most widely acknowledged feature of his life and character. Wood reported that &quot;he was by many accounted a severe student, a devourer of authors, a melancholy and humorous [i.e., moody] person&quot;, yet his peers found his company &quot;very merry&quot;. He wrote the &quot;Anatomy&quot; in part to relieve this melancholy, but this enterprise was not wholly successful. Bishop Kennett, writing somewhat later in the 18th century, recorded that Burton could flit between &quot;interval[s] of vapours&quot;, in which he was lively and social, and periods of isolation in his college chambers where his peers worried he was suicidal. Kennett hands down that later in his life Burton could arouse himself from these periods of depression only by &quot;going down to the Bridge-foot in Oxford, and hearing the barge-men scold and storm and swear at one another, at which he would set his hands to his sides, and laugh most profusely.&quot;

===Religious views===
Gowland has suggested the Burton family had some Catholic sympathies, because of their close relation to Jesuit Arthur Faunt. Faunt&#x27;s godson and Burton&#x27;s brother, William, spoke admiringly of Faunt as &quot;a man of great learning, gravity and wisdome&quot;; William was a vigorous supporter of Laudian reforms in his home county, siding with High Church Anglicanism, which was sometimes seen as Catholic-sympathising and at St Thomas&#x27;s, Burton was apparently one of the last 17th-century Church of England priests to use unleavened wafers in the Communion, an outmoded Laudian practice. However, as an Oxford scholar, Burton could have taken a personal dislike to Archbishop Laud; as the Chancellor there from 1630 to 1641, Laud was in perpetual squabbles with its body of scholars.

Burton was an apparent supporter of James I&#x27;s anti-Catholic measures, listed among those at Christ Church who took his Oath of Allegiance. The anti-Catholic portions of &quot;Philosophaster&quot; were revised shortly after James released the Oath, possibly to satirise the ensuing Catholic backlash. As Adam Kitzes put it, Burton &quot;makes no bones about his allegiance to the king and the Church of England&quot;. Burton also claimed part of his reasoning in not proceeding to a DD (Doctor of Divinity) was his reluctance to participate in the endless argument surrounding religion, for which he &quot;saw no such great neede&quot;.

===Library===

According to Bamborough, &quot;to describe Burton as &#x27;bookish&#x27; can only be called ridiculous understatement&quot;. Burton owned 1738 books in total, tenfold the library of a typical Oxford don, though not as vast as those of some other contemporary humanist scholars. He accumulated the collection over a forty-six year period, from 1594 to 1640. The profits from the &quot;Anatomy&quot; probably funded most of the library, larger than his modest academic and ecclesiastical income would have been able to cover. The majority of the library&#x27;s contents was in Latin, but the number of English volumes was untypically large. Burton seems to have been uncomfortable reading outside these two primary languages; he owned only a handful of titles in Italian, German, Spanish, and Hebrew, and none in Greek, the last despite his humanist reputation and the recurring Grecian references in the &quot;Anatomy&quot;. Again despite this reputation, the majority of Burton&#x27;s library was contemporary. He owned hundreds of cheap pamphlets, satires, and popular plays: all works which had been excluded from the recently founded Bodleian Library, perhaps why Burton felt the need to purchase them. Though religious works composed the largest category in his library (about one quarter), the remaining three quarters were made up by an eclectic collection of literary, historical, medical, and geographical volumes, testifying to Burton&#x27;s broad scholarship. Burton was an avid annotator of books, with marginal notes in around one-fifth of his books, from the tangential to the bluntly hostile.

Burton&#x27;s library was divided between the Bodleian and Christ Church libraries after his death. In the early 20th century, Oxford Regius Professor of Medicine William Osler, an enthusiast for Burton, found Burton&#x27;s bequests &quot;scattered indiscriminately&quot; throughout the two libraries, and, from 1907 to 1908, set about having them gathered together in one collection, rediscovering over a thousand of Burton&#x27;s volumes. In Christ Church Library, Osler set up an elaborate display of these books surrounding a copy of the Brasenose Portrait of Burton. Osler delivered an address on the contents of Burton&#x27;s library the following year. In 1964, Christ Church Library disassembled Osler&#x27;s Burton collection, moving the books to the Archiva Superiora on the second floor. This collection comprises 1530 of the 1738 books and two manuscripts owned by Burton. The remaining 210 were distributed to either various acquaintances of Burton; gifted or traded to other libraries or bookshops; or by selling duplicates, some of which are unrecorded. Of the 140 books yet to be located, it is thought that around half of these are extant. Christ Church Library has referred to Burton&#x27;s library as &quot;one of the most important surviving English private libraries from the period before the Civil War&quot;.

==Reputation and legacy==

Burton&#x27;s &quot;Anatomy&quot; was an extremely popular work in Burton&#x27;s lifetime, and throughout the 17th century, going through eight editions from 1621 to 1676. As early as 1662, Thomas Fuller was awed that &quot;any book of philology in our land hath in so short a time passed so many editions&quot;. Its readers interpreted and employed it to varied, personal ends. Wood wrote that the &quot;Anatomy&quot;, as &quot;a Book so full of variety of reading&quot;, prompted hack authors to borrow shamelessly from the work. Some authors, &quot;who have lost their time and are put to a push for invention&quot; poached his numerous classical quotations. In the 18th century, George Steevens retrospectively noted it as &quot;a book once the favourite of the learned and witty, and a source of surreptitious learning&quot;. Certainly, scholars copied and emulated the &quot;Anatomy&quot; to their own ends: William Vaughan repurposed Burton&#x27;s critique of court patronage towards an anti-Catholic end in &quot;The Golden Fleece&quot; (1626); Nathanael Carpenter imitated Burton&#x27;s intimate articulation of his own melancholy and defence of scholarship for his &quot;Geography delineated forth&quot; (1625); and Richard Whitlock, in his &quot;Zootomia&quot; (1654), plagiarised Burton&#x27;s defence of scholarship wholesale in defending the university from contemporary Puritan attacks. For the dramatists such as John Ford, Burton&#x27;s treatise &quot;was virtually an authoritative psychiatric textbook&quot;, used as a reference work for their depictions of melancholy. Richard Holdsworth, when Master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge (1637–43), recommended it as a comprehensive digest to &quot;serve for [the] delight and ornament&quot; of young gentlemen, bestowing that learning expected of a gentleman rather than that of a serious scholar. The earliest biography of Burton appeared in 1662, as part of Fuller&#x27;s &quot;Worthies of England&quot;; this was followed by Anthony à Wood in his 1692 volume of &quot;Athenae Oxonienses&quot;. 

Into the 18th century, Burton experienced something of a lull in popularity. The &quot;Anatomy&quot; did still obtain a few distinguished readers in this period. Samuel Johnson, himself a melancholic, was an avid reader of Burton; Boswell&#x27;s &quot;Life of Johnson&quot; reports that Johnson remarked the &quot;Anatomy&quot; was &quot;the only book that ever took him out of bed two hours sooner than he wished to rise&quot;. Though no American edition was published until 1836, Burton&#x27;s work procured a few prominent readers in early America. One such reader was American Founding Father Benjamin Franklin, who marvelled to a friend &quot;that, in the last Century, a Folio, Burton on Melancholy, went through six Editions in about twenty years. We have, I believe, more Readers now, but not such huge Books.&quot; Burton&#x27;s influence during this period was chiefly as reservoir of quotes and anecdotes for less sophisticated authors to borrow from. One such borrower was Laurence Sterne, who shamelessly incorporated passages of Burton throughout his &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; (1759), an act of plagiarism which was not revealed for nearly thirty years, until the publication of John Ferriar&#x27;s &quot;Illustrations of Sterne&quot; (1798).

After Ferriar made this influence known, Burton and his work experienced a revival of interest. A new edition, the first in over a century, was published in 1800; more than forty were published throughout the 19th century. The Romantics, especially Charles Lamb and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, admired the work as an erudite curiosity. Lamb illustrated Burton in his &quot;Detached Thoughts on Books and Reading&quot; (1833) as &quot;that fantastic great old man&quot;, creating the image of Burton as an eccentric and erudite academic which has since stuck, for whatever truth it possessed. The &quot;Anatomy&quot; was among John Keats&#x27;s favourite books, and was used as a major source for the plot of his poem &quot;Lamia&quot; (1820). Burton&#x27;s prose style wasn&#x27;t universally appreciated, appearing pedantic and pretentious to some 19th-century critics. The Victorian poet and literary critic T. E. Brown disparaged the &quot;Anatomy&quot; as &quot;the sweepings of the medieval dustbin&quot; or some &quot;enormous labyrinthine joke&quot;.

Into the early 20th century, this romantic view transitioned into the more academic study of Burton&#x27;s masterpiece. William Osler—widely regarded as the father of modern medicine—was a lifelong devotee of Burton and described the &quot;Anatomy&quot; as &quot;the greatest medical treatise written by a layman&quot;. According to one scholar, &quot;the revival of critical interest in &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot; owes not a little to Osler&#x27;s direct influence&quot;. Following Osler&#x27;s influence, Burtonian studies were primarily bibliographical in the early 20th century, with the exception of an influential essay by critic Morris Croll on the &quot;Senecan style&quot; in Burton&#x27;s late Renaissance prose. By the middle of the 20th century, psychoanalytic critics of the &quot;Anatomy&quot; emerged, regarding Burton&#x27;s masterpiece as a work of psychological autobiography. In &quot;The Psychiatry of Robert Burton&quot; (1944), for instance, critic Bergen Evans and psychiatrist George Mohr combed the &quot;Anatomy&quot; for references to mothers in an attempt to reconstruct Burton&#x27;s own relationship with his mother. This psychoanalytic tendency has been criticised by more modern biographers of Burton, especially by R. L. Nochimson, who dedicated an article to amending the &quot;amazing carelessness&quot; with which Burton&#x27;s literary and real personae have been confused. Stanley Fish&#x27;s 1972 monograph &quot;Self-Consuming Artifacts&quot; inaugurated the postmodern interpretation of Burton&#x27;s &quot;Anatomy&quot;, which alternatingly saw it as a satirical indictment of humanistic encyclopedism, or a desperate suppression of Burton&#x27;s anxiety over the immensity of his subject matter. However, in total, Burton&#x27;s &quot;Anatomy&quot; only accrued a small handful of monographs in the second half of the 20th century. The most detailed study of this period was a French monograph by Jean Robert Simon, a fact which, according to one scholar, &quot;speaks volumes about the marginalization of the &quot;Anatomy&quot; in Anglophone early modern studies [of that period].&quot;

Burton earned a new generation of enthusiasts in the 20th and 21st centuries. As journalist Nick Lezard observed in 2000, though not often reprinted, &quot;Robert Burton&#x27;s &quot;Anatomy of Melancholy&quot; survives among the &quot;. Samuel Beckett drew influence from Burton&#x27;s &quot;Anatomy&quot;, both in the misogynistic depiction of women in his early fiction, and the Latin quotations (via Burton) found throughout in his work. The eminent literary critic Northrop Frye was an admirer of the &quot;Anatomy&quot;; he characterized it as &quot;an enormous survey of human life&quot; which &quot;ranks with Chaucer and Dickens, except the characters are books rather than people&quot;. Psychiatrist and historian of ideas Jacques Barzun held up Burton as &quot;the first systematic psychiatrist&quot;, praising him for the collection of &quot;widely scattered case histories&quot; of melancholia for his &quot;Anatomy&quot;, and treating the mentally ill with a &quot;tender sympathy&quot; uncharacteristic of subsequent psychiatrists. American writer Alexander Theroux has named Burton as one of his influences, and sometimes imitates his style. English novelist Philip Pullman praised the work in a 2005 article for &quot;The Telegraph&quot; as a &quot;glorious and intoxicating and endlessly refreshing reward for reading&quot;. For Pullman, it is &quot;one of the indispensable books; for my money, it is the best of all.&quot; Australian singer/songwriter Nick Cave listed Burton&#x27;s &quot;Anatomy&quot; as one of his favourite books.

Though Burton&#x27;s legacy lies almost exclusively in his authorship of the &quot;Anatomy&quot;, his &quot;Philosophaster&quot; has increasingly been examined alongside it. As Murphy observed, &quot;Philosophaster&quot; &quot;has received more attention than most of the other surviving examples of university drama.&quot; Since its first, mid-19th-century publication in Latin, it has been published three more times, twice with original translations into English. In 1930, it was even performed at the University of California. The play has received a mixed reception from modern scholars. Literary critic Martin Spevack dismissed it as &quot;an obvious and elementary string of transparent sketches&quot;. O&#x27;Connell has, however, described it as &quot;perhaps the most appealing of Burton&#x27;s Latin works&quot;, he notes that the &quot;liveliness in its representation of university life&quot; redeems the &quot;weak plotting and flat characterization.&quot; The 19th-century critic of Elizabethan drama Arthur Henry Bullen wrote of it that the philosophasters &quot;are portrayed with considerable humour and skill, and the lyrical portions of the play are written with a light hand&quot;. Bamborough summed it up as &quot;not without genuine merit, particularly in the satirical portraits of pretenders to learning.&quot;

<text>Uaxactun (pronounced ) is an ancient sacred place of the Maya civilization, located in the Petén Basin region of the Maya lowlands, in the present-day department of Petén, Guatemala. The site lies some north of the major center of Tikal. The name is sometimes spelled as Waxaktun.

==History of discovery==
With recent achievements in the decipherment of the ancient Maya hieroglyphic writing system, it has been determined that the ancient name for this site translates roughly as Siaan K&#x27;aan or &quot;Born in Heaven&quot;. The name &quot;Uaxactun&quot; was given to the site by its rediscoverer, archaeologist Sylvanus Morley, in May 1916. He coined the name from Maya words &quot;Waxac&quot; and &quot;Tun&quot;, to mean &quot;Eight Stones&quot;. The name has two meanings; Morley&#x27;s stated reason for the name was to commemorate it as the first site where an inscription dating from the 8th Baktún of the Maya calendar was discovered (making it then the earliest known Maya date). The other meaning is a pun, since &quot;Uaxactun&quot; sounds like &quot;Washington&quot;, the U.S. capital and home of the Carnegie Institute which funded Morley&#x27;s explorations.

Morley&#x27;s initial investigation of the site mostly focused on the hieroglyphic inscriptions; after that Uaxactun was not visited again until 1924, when Frans Blom made a more detailed investigation of the structures and mapped the site. The Carnegie Institution conducted archeological excavations there from 1926 through 1937, led by Oliver Ricketson. The excavations added greatly to knowledge of the early Classic and pre-Classic Maya. The remains of several badly ruined late Classic era temple-pyramids were removed, revealing well-preserved earlier temples underneath them.
For most of the Carnegie team&#x27;s time at Uaxactun, communication with the outside world was via a four-day mule convoy to El Cayo, British Honduras. Towards the end of the time an airstrip was opened. Flights to Uaxactun continued and a small village grew there, as it became a center for gathering of chicle sap from the Petén jungle. In 1940 A. L. Smith and Ed Shook of the Carnegie project returned to make some additional excavations. In the late 1970s a rough road was opened, connecting Uaxactun to Tikal and thence to Flores, Guatemala. Air flights were discontinued. In 1984 the road was much improved. Shook returned again in 1974 to oversee consolidation and restoration of some architecture excavated earlier. In 1982 Guatemala&#x27;s &quot;Tikal National Park&quot; was expanded to include the ruins of Uaxactun within its protected area. In 1990 the Maya Biosphere Reserve (MBR) was created, including Uaxactun as a part of the reserve&#x27;s Multiple Use Zone.

In 2009 an excavation project of Slovak Archaeological and Historical Institute (SAHI) was started by professor Milan Kováč.

== Conquest of Uaxactun by Siyaj K&#x27;ak&#x27; ==
Linda Schele, in &quot;A Forest of Kings&quot;, devotes an entire chapter to a war between Tikal and Uaxactun, in which Uaxactun was defeated by forces led by Fire is Born (Siyaj K&#x27;ak&#x27;, formerly identified as Smoking Frog) of Tikal. In this chapter, she also gives a brief overview of the known history of Uaxactun up to the final year of the war (378 AD) and of the Uaxactun kings who claimed descent from Fire is Born. The combined political entity of Tikal-Uaxactun dominated the Guatemalan Petén for the following 180 years.

Siyaj K&#x27;ak&#x27; might have come from Teotihuacán, been the general of the Teotihuacano ruler Spearthrower Owl, and conquered Tikal earlier the same year. This was a watershed moment of the Classic Maya. Some scholars suggested that new kings were installed at Tikal, Uaxactun, Rio Azul, El Peru, El Zapote and Bejucal during the Teotihuacan intrusions, new rituals and images were introduced, and a new order was established in the Maya Lowlands, while others suggested a less hegemonic role of Teotihuacan in its relationship with the Maya.

== After 378 AD ==

After the conquest by Siyaj K&#x27;ak&#x27; in 378 AD, Uaxactun was still able to keep elite prerogatives of monument carving, temple erection, and rich burials during most of the Early Classic era. During the Hiatus period (about 600 AD) between Early Classic and Late Classic, Uaxactun experienced a lack of architectural activity and ceramic production, which coincided with the decline of the power of Teotihuacán and Tikal. There was no erection of dedicatory monuments between 554 AD and 711 AD. By the middle of Late Classic, Uaxactun showed evidences of population increase, new construction, remodeling of old structures, and appearance of new residential areas, plaza groups, and buildings. There was a time of distinctive population decrease towards the end of Late Classic. The last inscribed monument in Uaxactun is dated to 889. By the end of Terminal Classic, Uaxactun and Tikal were virtually abandoned.

== References in popular culture ==

The Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi composed a piece in 1966 entitled &quot;Uaxuctum&quot;. It is subtitled: &quot;The legend of the Maya city, destroyed by themselves for religious reasons&quot;.

Uaxactun was the location mentioned in the opening scene of the 1994 video game &quot;&quot;. The game was released on various platforms from 1994 until 2009.

<text>The River Mole is a tributary of the River Thames in southern England. It rises in West Sussex near Gatwick Airport and flows north-west through Surrey for to the Thames at Hampton Court Palace. The river gives its name to the Surrey district of Mole Valley.

The Mole crosses the North Downs between Dorking and Leatherhead, where it cuts a steep-sided valley, known as the Mole Gap, through the chalk. Much of the catchment area lies on impermeable rock (including Weald Clay and London Clay), meaning that the river level responds rapidly to heavy rainfall.

During the second half of the 20th century, pollution levels in the river were high; however, since 1995 the water quality has improved dramatically and the Mole now boasts the greatest diversity of fish species of any river in England. Twelve Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) that include wetland habitats are located within the Mole catchment area, and the stretch of river through Leatherhead has been designated a Local Nature Reserve. The Mole Gap forms part of a Special Area of Conservation and is an SSSI of European importance.

The river has captured the imagination of several authors and poets, particularly since in very hot summers the river channel can become dry between Dorking and Leatherhead, most recently in 2022. In John Speed&#x27;s 1611 map of Surrey, this stretch of the river is denoted by a series of hills accompanied by the legend &quot;The river runneth under&quot;. However the river&#x27;s name is unlikely to have derived from this behaviour: The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names&quot; suggests that &quot;Mole&quot; either comes from the Latin (a mill) or is a back-formation from &quot;Molesey&quot; (Mul&#x27;s island). Domesday Book lists twenty mills on the river in 1086, of which Sidlow Mill was the oldest, dating from Saxon times.

==Catchment area==
The drainage area of the Mole is and forms 5% of the River Thames&#x27;s catchment area above Teddington. The catchment area receives of rain each year; the greatest average level of rainfall is around Crawley. The Mole catchment reaches a maximum elevation of above Ordnance Datum at Leith Hill to the southwest of Dorking. There is only one aquifer in the drainage basin, at Fetcham, which means that the majority of the water in the river is from surface drainage, particularly from Gatwick Airport and the urban areas of Horley and Crawley, and that the flow rate responds rapidly to rainfall.

==Course==
===Upper Mole===
The Mole rises in Baldhorns Copse to the south of the village of Rusper in West Sussex. It flows initially southwards for to a small lake at Baldhorns Park, before running eastwards through a largely rural area towards Crawley. The first tributaries to join the young river drain the northernmost part of St Leonard&#x27;s Forest, between Horsham and Crawley, although much of the forest is in the catchment area of the River Arun. The Mole skirts the northern suburbs of Crawley where it is joined by its first major tributary, Ifield Brook, which drains Ifield Mill Pond.

The first gauging station on the Mole is south of Gatwick Airport ( above OD). The mean flow is and the river ran dry at this point for the first time in the summer of 1995. The Mole runs under the airport runway in a culvert completed in 1985. The course of the Mole within the airport perimeter has been altered several times since commercial flights began in 1945; however the meanders visible on the 1839 tithe map in the stretch immediately north of the runway were reinstated in 1999, in a £1.2 million project to facilitate airport expansion.

The Mole enters Surrey to the south of Horley, where it meets the Gatwick Stream, a tributary draining Worth Forest to the southeast of Crawley. The second-largest Sewage Treatment Works (STW) in the Mole catchment is located on the Gatwick Stream upstream of the confluence with the Mole: Crawley STW discharges of water per day, and in prolonged dry periods it accounts for up to 75% of the flow of the Mole downstream of the confluence. The mean flow measured at Horley gauging station ( above OD) is .

The Mole passes Horley to the west, flowing north towards Sidlow and entering a largely rural area. south of Sidlow the mean flow is measured as at Kinnersley Manor gauging station ( above OD). The Earlswood Brook, a tributary draining the urban area of Reigate and Redhill, joins the Mole at Sidlow. The largest STW in the Mole catchment (Reigate STW) discharges up to per day into the Earlswood Brook.

From Sidlow, the Mole turns northwest towards Brockham. A number of minor tributaries join the river from the west and are typically second order streams draining the woodland and arable land between Horsham and Dorking. The 18th-century weir at Betchworth was modified in 2004 to facilitate the installation of two 27.5 kW low-head hydro turbines. About 90% of the energy generated is fed into the regional electricity grid, while the remainder is used to supply the Betchworth Park Estate, where the weir is situated. The river leaves the Weald Clay at Brockham, passing Betchworth Castle and flowing briefly across greensand and Gault Clay to Pixham, northeast of Dorking. A mean flow of is measured at a fourth gauging station, located at Castle Mill ( above OD). At Pixham the Mole meets the Pipp Brook, a tributary draining the northeastern slopes of Leith Hill.

===Mole Gap===
Between Dorking and Leatherhead the Mole cuts a steep-sided valley (the Mole Gap) though the North Downs, carving a river cliff on the western flank of Box Hill and a smaller cliff at Ham Bank in Norbury Park. The sudden change from impermeable Weald Clay to permeable chalk and the increased gradient of the river, allow the water table to drop below the bed of the river. Water is therefore able to flow out of the river through swallow holes in the bed and banks, decreasing the volume of water carried in the main channel.

The course of the river through Norbury Park was partially straightened when the Epsom to Horsham railway was built in 1837, with the removal of a small meander north of Westhumble. The meander was reinstated in 1997, in an attempt to enhance this area of the Park, although it has since become blocked by silt. The entirety of the Mole Gap lies within the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

===Lower Mole===

At Leatherhead, the Mole leaves the chalk and turns northwestwards to flow across impermeable London Clay, winding towards Cobham. The water table rises at this point and much of the water which drained out of the channel through the chalk returns through springs in the riverbed. The aquifer at Fetcham is the only one in the entire catchment area. The next major tributary, The Rye, (which drains Ashtead) joins to the north of Leatherhead, before the river is crossed by the M25 motorway. At Cobham the river swings round in a pronounced axehead meander skirting Painshill Landscape Garden, where a diameter waterwheel raises water from the river to feed the ornamental lake in the park.

From Painshill Park the river flows northeastwards to the Thames, passing to the west of Esher Commons and then forming the boundary between Hersham and Esher, where the mean flow of the river is . In response to heavy flooding of East Molesey and Thames Ditton in September 1968, the river was modified downstream of Albany Bridge to the Thames and new flood defences were constructed. Finally the Mole splits into two branches at the Island Barn Reservoir near Molesey: the northern (and smaller) branch continues as the River Mole and the southern branch is known as the River Ember. The two rivers flow either side of the reservoir, before running side by side in a northeasterly direction, merging before the confluence with the River Thames, on the reach above Teddington Lock. (For the purposes of the remainder of this article, the River Mole and the River Ember are treated as a single entity.)

Prior to the last ice age, the River Thames followed a more northerly route to the North Sea, from Reading via Marlow, Chorleywood, St Albans, Hertford and along the present Suffolk–Essex border. During this period, the Mole is thought to have merged with the River Wey near Byfleet and then flowed in a north-easterly direction via Richmond to meet the proto-Thames near Ware in Hertfordshire. Today the Mole and Wey are less than apart at their closest point near Painshill Park. During the Middle Pleistocene period, a large ice sheet built up across much of the East of England, reaching as far south as St Albans and Chelmsford, blocking the path of the proto-Thames. Glacial meltwater from the Anglian ice sheet caused the Thames to divert southwards and flood the valley of the Mole–Wey river, thus adopting its present route through London.

==Ecology==

===Water quality===
Standard water quality of Mole and its tributaries has improved markedly since the 1990s. In 1990 the Environment Agency assessed 23% of the watercourses as Grade B (good) or better. In 2002 this figure was 60%. Investment in the Sewage Treatment Works in the catchment area has improved the quality of the discharges into the river, and modifications to the runway and apron drainage systems at Gatwick Airport mean that surface water is diverted to aerated pollution control lagoons and balancing ponds for treatments, including acid/alkali neutralisation, before release into the river.

In 1972 a sub-debate on the future cleanliness of the Mole was had by the House of Lords, involving a member of the South-East Strategic Committee of the Thames Conservancy (succeeded by the Environment Agency) and four others. In this it was said, &quot;...I can see no future for [The Mole]. The Mole Valley has been polluted. The Mole where I used to tickle trout in my youth is a drain, and it will remain a drain.&quot; Rebuttals included that the Mole is a &quot;charming Surrey steam&quot; and &quot;If Lord Lytton went to fish in the River Mole – and there are still angling clubs there – he would find that he would still be able to catch a trout&quot;.

Highly polluting discharges have become less common but have taken place since 2000. In 2003, Gatwick Airport Ltd pleaded guilty to charges of allowing chemical pollution to enter the River Mole after a detergent, used to clean rubber and oil from the runway, was washed into Crawters Brook by airport workers. The Environment Agency estimated that up to 5200 fish of 14 different species were killed as the pollution drained downstream. The airport was fined £30,000 by Lewes Crown Court. In May 2003, sewage leaking from a pump operated by Thames Water leaked into the Stanford Brook, killing coarse fish in the Gatwick stream.

Water quality of the River Mole in 2019:
===Biodiversity===
The marsh frog (&quot;Pelophylax ridibundus&quot;, a non-native species introduced from Europe in the 1930s) is now commonly found in the upper Mole and its tributaries around Newdigate and Gatwick. There is no evidence that the presence of the frogs has had a deleterious effect on indigenous amphibians. A second non-native species, the edible frog (&quot;Pelophylax&quot; kl. &quot;esculentus&quot;) was introduced to a site at Newdigate in the early 1900s. It has in 2008 been recorded in tributaries of the River Mole at Capel and Brockham.
The River Mole has the most diverse fish population of any river in England. The Gatwick Stream is dominated by coarse fish such as brown trout, brook lamprey, and eel. In 2003, the upper River Mole near Meath Green Lane, Horley, was enhanced to create a gravel spawning area to encourage chub and dace in addition to roach. In 1974 zander, a non-indigenous coarse fish native to Europe, were introduced legally to Old Bury Hill Lake which supplies the Pipp Brook. Zander have been caught in the Lower Mole below Dorking since the 1980s.

In the Mole Gap between Dorking and Leatherhead the river supports populations of chub, dace, barbel, and brown trout. Both barbel and brown trout are extremely sensitive to water quality and pollution. Below Leatherhead the river has historically supported larger predatory fish including chub, perch, pike, and eels, however in recent years chub and eel numbers have begun to decline. North of Esher the old river channel is dominated by floating pennywort, a highly invasive weed, which cuts off all light to the river bed, reducing oxygen levels and resulting in a poor habitat for fish. The Ember flood relief channel has a diverse fish population, including chub, dace, roach, bleak, large pike and barbel. At the confluence of the Mole and the River Thames at Hampton Court Palace it is possible to catch a wide variety of coarse fish species.

The geographical distribution of many species of invertebrate in the river reflects the geology of the catchment area. Viviparid snails and water scorpions (of the genus &quot;Nepidae&quot;) are commonly found where the river runs over the London Clay. Crayfish are common in areas associated with high alkalinity, particularly around Brockham, and the tributaries which run over the Weald Clay provide an excellent habitat for stoneflies, caddisflies, fast swimming mayflies and riffle beetles.
The beautiful demoiselle (&quot;Calopteryx virgo&quot;) disappeared from the River Mole during the 1960s owing to deteriorating water quality, but has since recolonised. The white-legged damselfly (&quot;Platycnemis pennipes&quot;) is also found along the river, and the downy emerald (&quot;Cordulia aenea&quot;) is found between Box Hill and Leatherhead. The Mole is one of only three locations in England where the river shingle beetle (&quot;Meotica anglica&quot;) is found.

A nationally scarce species which is locally common on the River Mole is the greater dodder (&quot;Cuscuta europaea&quot;), a parasitic plant.

===Conservation===
The Mole catchment area includes twelve Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) that include wetland habitats, The Mole Gap forms part of a Special Area of Conservation and is an SSSI of European importance.

The stretch of river between Thorncroft Manor ( south of Leatherhead) and River Lane in Fetcham has been designated a Local Nature Reserve. Although much of the surrounding land has been taken by residential and commercial development, this section of the Mole supports 20 different mammal species, 20 butterfly species and 15 species of dragonfly. The geology of the local area is complex, since the river leaves the chalk of the Mole Gap at this point and flows over gravel and clay, creating a patchwork of different habitats including scrub, woodland, hedges, banks, and meadows as well as the water itself. The river also provides a corridor for wildlife through the centre of Leatherhead.

The West End Common forms part of the Esher Commons, owned and managed by Elmbridge Borough Council. The River Mole forms the western boundary of the common, flowing past a steep sandy area known locally as &quot;The Ledges&quot;. Plant species typical of ancient woodland are found in this area, including bluebells (&quot;Hyacinthoides non-scriptus&quot;), marsh marigolds (&quot;Caltha palustris&quot;) and golden saxifrages (&quot;Chrysosplenium&quot; sp.). large bittercress (&quot;Cardamine amara&quot;) and the non-native Himalayan balsam (&quot;Impatiens glandulifera&quot;).

Molesey Heath Local Nature Reserve lies on the west bank of the Mole, west of the Island Barn Reservoir. The Heath is an area of rough scrubland and, despite its name, is a reclaimed landfill site hence its large but artificial mound and small plateau. The site is a rich habitat for birds including the redshank and little ringed plover.

==Geology==

===Upper Mole (geology)===

The Mole rises south of Rusper in West Sussex, where an outcrop of the Hastings Beds sandstone dips below the impermeable Weald Clay. From the source to Dorking, the river drains an area of , of which approximately 60% is on Wealden or Atherfield Clay, 20% is on Tunbridge Wells Sand and 20% is on greensand. Brickearth deposits are common in the valley around Betchworth and east of Dorking.

The upper Mole catchment is dominated by a single broad terrace, which runs continuously from Tilgate Forest to the entry to the Mole Gap. Above Meath Green (near Horley), the terrace corresponds to the flood plain of the river, however from this point downstream to Brockham, the river cuts a narrow trench no more than wide. A similar trench is runs up several of the Mole&#x27;s tributaries, notably along Deanoak Brook which follows a local strike. The presence of the trench protects the land from flooding, rendering it suitable for agriculture.

===Mole Gap (geology)===

Between Dorking and Leatherhead the Mole cuts a steep-sided valley through the North Downs, creating a river cliff on the western flank of Box Hill. The bedrock is permeable chalk and the water table lies permanently below the level of the riverbed, allowing water to drain out of the river through swallow holes in the bed and banks. The amount of water lost from the river is significant and in very hot summers the channel can become dry between Mickleham and Thorncroft Manor; this was recorded most recently in 1949, 1976 and 2022. At Leatherhead, the river leaves the chalk and flows across impermeable London Clay. At this point, the water table rises enough for the water to flow back into the main river channel.

In a survey in 1958, the geologist C. C. Fagg identified 25 active swallow holes between Dorking and Mickleham; the majority were only a few centimetres in diameter and were located in the vertical banks of the river below the water line. Most holes were difficult to observe in times of normal or heavy flow and were susceptible to silting up as new holes were continually being formed. A few much larger swallow holes were also observed separated from the main river by a channel of about a metre. About six of these larger swallow holes were found to the west of the Burford Bridge Hotel, along the course of the A24 Mickleham Bypass during its construction in 1936. Initially the surveyors tried to fill the holes with rubble to prevent the foundations of the new road subsiding. However this proved to be impractical and they were instead covered by concrete domes, up to 18 m in diameter, each fully supported by the surrounding chalk and provided with a manhole and access shaft to allow periodic inspection. In the late 1960s the domes were reopened and inspected and the alluvium in the largest swallow hole was observed to have subsided by under the centre of one of the domes. When the Dorking to Leatherhead railway was constructed in 1859, a fossilised swallow hole was discovered in the cutting at the south end of Box Hill &amp; Westhumble railway station, suggesting that even in its early history, the river had swallow holes.

The author Daniel Defoe, who attended school in Dorking and probably grew up in the village of Westhumble, described the swallow holes in the River Mole in his book &quot;A tour thro&#x27; the Whole Island of Great Britain&quot; (first published in 1724):
Not all of the water removed from the river by the swallow holes is returned to the channel at Leatherhead. The chalk aquifer also feeds the springs at the southern end of Fetcham Mill Pond, which have never been known to run dry. A survey in March 1883 estimated that the Fetcham springs were producing about every day. A second survey in 1948 estimated that the same springs were yielding about a day. The water table in the chalk of the Wey Gap is significantly higher than might be expected from natural rainwater percolation alone. It has been suggested that a proportion of the excess water originates from the Mole Gap.

===Lower Mole (geology)===
At Leatherhead the river leaves the chalk bedrock, moving onto London Clay. The river meanders across an alluvial plain between wide towards Cobham, where it begins to descend to a lower flood plain, which broadens as the river turns in an axehead meander. At the east end of Painshill Park, the flood plain narrows into a trench about wide, in which the river runs northwards for towards Hersham, where the river enters the flood plain of the River Thames.

Between Cobham and Esher, the Mole&#x27;s historic courses have deposited gravel on top of the London Clay. The depth of the deposits generally varies from ; the lower layers are generally highly compacted and cemented together with brick-red iron oxide, whereas the upper layers are loosely packed with angular flints and sand. Remains of a further gravel terrace, containing cherts and flints to a depth of , line the east side of St George&#x27;s Hill.

==History==

===Etymology===
The river is first recorded in the &quot;Red Book of Thorney&quot; in AD 983 as &quot;Emen&quot; and in the AD 1005 &quot;Cartulary of the Abbey of Eynsham&quot; as both &quot;Emen&quot; and &quot;Æmen&quot;. Variations in the name are recorded throughout the Middle Ages and the river appears as &quot;Amele&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086, and subsequently as &quot;Emele&quot; in 12th- and 13th-century Court Rolls. This name is probably derived from the Old English word &quot;æmen&quot; meaning &quot;misty&quot; or &quot;causing mists&quot;, and the name of the River Ember probably has its origins in this name.

The name &quot;Mole&quot; does not appear until the 16th century, first occurring as &quot;Moule&quot; in Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Description of Britain&quot; of 1577. The antiquarian William Camden uses the Latinized form &quot;Molis&quot; in the 1586 edition of &quot;Britannia&quot; and Michael Drayton is the first to use &quot;Mole&quot; in his poem &quot;Poly-Olbion&quot; published in 1613. In John Speed&#x27;s 1611 map of Surrey this stretch of the river is denoted by a series of hills accompanied by the legend &quot;The river runneth under&quot;. However the river&#x27;s name is unlikely to have derived from this behaviour: The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names&quot; suggests that &quot;Mole&quot; either comes from the Latin &quot;mola&quot; (a mill) or is a back-formation from &quot;Molesey&quot; (Mul&#x27;s island). In John Rocque&#x27;s 1768 map of Surrey, the name &quot;Moulsey River&quot; is used.

===Archaeology===
In common with much of the rest of the Weald, the earliest evidence of human settlement along the Upper Mole is from the Mesolithic Period (20,000–7000 BC). Mesolithic sites at Wonham, Flanchford and Sidlow. Finds at Wonham include arrowheads and a plano-convex knife. The Lower Mole appears to have been settled during the same period and a flint axe dating from Mesolithic period found on spit of land close to River Mole in Cobham in 1965. Remains of a flat-bottomed dug-out canoe were found at the confluence of the Mole and Thames in 1877 by a local boatman. The canoe is preserved at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford.

The Mole Gap and North Downs do not appear to have been settled until the late Stone Age: A large axe, typical of a &quot;rough-out&quot; axe produced during the Neolithic period, which was discovered in 1952 during building work in Westhumble, A flint mine of the same period has been discovered at East Horsley along with Neolithic flakes of flint at Fetcham and Headley Heath.

Significant Bronze Age finds include a bronze sword found close to the river north of Amberley Farm near Charlwood and a small hoard of weaponry consisting of two palstave axes and a scabbard chape was discovered in 2003 in Norbury Park close to Ham Bank.

===Navigation===

It is not clear to what extent the Mole was used for navigation in the past: In the late 13th century, Thorncroft Manor (south of Leatherhead) purchased a &quot;shout&quot;, a type of boat up to in length used to carry produce to market and it has been suggested that stone cut from quarries in Reigate was transported to London via the river.

During the 17th century, two bills came before parliament to make sections of the river navigable. The first, in 1663, was passed by the House of Commons but was defeated in the House of Lords. During the following year (1664), an act was passed by both Houses of Parliament to make the River Mole navigable from Reigate to the River Thames, but was never executed. The only Surrey river to have been made fully navigable is the combined lower section of the River Wey.

In 1798 William Marshall advocated the canalisation of a short stretch of the River Mole between Betchworth and Dorking to facilitate the movement of chalk from quarry to market. In 1810 the engineer John Rennie proposed a canal linking the River Medway to Portsmouth which was to have a branch to London following the Mole for much of its length. Between 1825 and 1828 the architect and civil engineer Nicholas Wilcox Cundy proposed a Grand Imperial Ship Canal from Deptford to Chichester passing through the Mole Gap, however he was unable to attract sufficient financial interest in his scheme.

Today the Mole is navigable for the from the confluence with the River Thames to Molember Weir at East Molesey where there is a private mooring facility. The river may be paddled all year by canoe between Brockham and Fetcham with an appropriate licence from the British Canoe Union.

===Second World War defences===
During the Second World War several sites along the course of the Mole were fortified for the defence of London against invasion from the south. GHQ Line B ran along the North Downs from Farnham and Guildford, crossing the Mole Gap to the north of Dorking and following the river to Horley. Between Betchworth and Box Hill, the north bank of the River Mole was stabilised and made steeper to prevent wheeled vehicles from crossing. At Boxhill Farm, where access to the river from the north bank was required for the herd of dairy cows, a row of twelve concrete cylinders were cast as an anti-tank measure. Gun mounts were also installed to protect both Boxhill and Deepdene bridges and several pillboxes were installed. An anti-tank ditch was dug from the Stepping Stones eastwards across the fields belonging to Bradley Farm (now Denbies vineyard).

The river crossing at Sidlow Bridge was heavily defended and a line of pill boxes was constructed on the north bank of the river. Concrete anti-tank dragon&#x27;s teeth were built on both sides of the river, a short distance upstream of the bridge, as an obstacle to armoured vehicles.

==Crossings of the Mole==

=== Mole Gap ===

The North Downs Way crosses the river at Box Hill via seventeen hexagonal stepping stones, which are frequently submerged after heavy rainfall. The current stones were dedicated in September 1946 by the then Prime Minister Clement Attlee, replacing those destroyed during the Second World War as an anti-invasion measure. The location is popular with anglers and families, but swimming is strongly discouraged as the water is polluted in places. The stones give their name to the pub in the nearby village of Westhumble.

When the Burford Bridge was rebuilt in 1937, excavations revealed a &quot;flint-surfaced approach to [a] ford at low level having all the signs of Roman workmanship&quot; suggesting that Stane Street (which ran from London to Chichester via Dorking) crossed the river at this point. In Defoe&#x27;s time, there was a footbridge at this point, but carts and waggons had to cross the river by a ford.

=== Leatherhead ===

There are three listed bridges in Leatherhead of which the 14 arch Leatherhead Town Bridge is the oldest. The first bridge on this site was probably constructed during the late Middle Ages and was rebuilt and enlarged by the county surveyor, George Gwilt in 1782–83. The bridge is a long structure of 14 segmental arches resting on low piers, finished in red brick in Flemish bond, with some Portland stone dressing.

A few metres downstream of Leatherhead Bridge stands the Grade II listed railway viaduct which carries the Leatherhead to Dorking line over the river. The bridge was constructed in 1867 and, at the insistence of Thomas Grissell the landowner, was given lavish architectural treatment.

The single-span Shell Bridge stands in the grounds of Thorncroft Manor, to the south of the Town Centre. The bridge was constructed as an ornamental feature in parkland laid out by Capability Brown in the late 18th century. The bridge is largely composed of flint and has a large inverted scallop shell in the place of the keystone and similar shells in the spandrels at each side. The bridge was renovated and strengthened in 1999 by a group of Canadian engineers working on the Terra Nove project. The restoration project was dedicated to the memory of the Canadian servicemen who were billeted in the manor during the Second World War.

=== Cobham ===
A wooden bridge is thought to have existed on the site of Cobham Bridge since the 12th century, the upkeep of which was the responsibility of the adjacent landowners. The present bridge was constructed by George Gwilt in 1792, after responsibility for maintenance had been transferred to the county council by Act of Parliament. The bridge has nine low arches and is primarily built of red brick with stone coping. The parapets were rebuilt in 1914 and the structure was given a Grade II listing in 1953.

==Watermills==
Domesday Book listed twenty mills on the River Mole in 1086.

=== Upper Mole ===

Horley Mill was first mentioned in a deed of the early 13th century. The most recent mill was demolished in 1959, although the mill house still stands.

The first mill at Sidlow was built during Saxon times. The final mill on the site was demolished in 1790, however remains of the mill leat are still visible.

Mention is made of a mill at Brockham in 1634 and remains of the mill race are still visible.

Castle Mill at Pixham is a Grade II listed building. It was a corn mill, built in the early 19th century, and has been converted into a bed and breakfast hotel.

=== Lower Mole ===

Slyfield Mill near Stoke d&#x27;Abernon is first mentioned in Domesday Book. It was used for fulling woollen cloth and milling corn.

Five of the mills mentioned in Domesday Book were in the borough of Elmbridge.

Downside Mill, Cobham was the mill of the manor of Downe. Until the Dissolution of the Monasteries it was owned by Chertsey Abbey. It has been used for many purposes including the processing of corn, paper, iron, tinplate and flock and the generation of electricity. The present building dates from the 18th century but it is inaccessible to the public.

Cobham Mill, downstream of Leatherhead, consisted of two mills used for grinding corn. In 1953 the larger mill was demolished by Surrey County Council to allieviate traffic congestion on Mill Road. The remaining red brick mill dates from the 1822 and was in use until 1928. It was restored to full working order by the Cobham Mill Preservation Trust, and is now open to the public from 2 pm to 5 pm on the second Sunday of each month (between April and October).

Esher Mill also known as Royal Mill was at the end of Mill Road in Lower Green, where there is now an industrial estate. It was used to process corn, brass wire, iron, paper, linoleum, and books. For many years there may have been two mills on the site for corn grinding and industrial use. There were a series of fires over a century and after the last in 1978 the buildings were demolished.

East Molesey Upper Mill was associated with the manor of Molesey Matham. It was used to produce gunpowder from the time of the Commonwealth until about 1780. The island where it stood now forms part of the ornamental gardens of a housing development called &quot;The Wilderness&quot;.

East Molesey Lower Mill, also known as Sterte Mill, was associated with the manor of Molesey Prior. During the Commonwealth it was used for gunpowder manufacture, but after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 it reverted to corn milling. An old timber structure was replaced by a brick building in the 1820s which can be seen from the bridge over the Ember in Hampton Court Way.

In addition there was Ember Mill, which stood on the banks of the old course of the River Ember near Hampton Court Way.

==River Ember Flood Relief Channel and confluence with the Thames==

The River Mole originally flowed into the River Thames at the point where the present Hampton Court bridge now crosses the Thames (approximately 500 m upstream of the present confluence, on the reach above Teddington Lock).

However, during the early 1930s, when Hampton Court Way and the bridge were built, the River Mole was redirected to flow into the River Ember and both rivers now enter the Thames in a single widened and straightened channel once occupied only by the River Ember. There have been further alterations to the courses of these two rivers in a major flood prevention scheme since serious flooding in the area in 1947 and 1968.

==Literature==
The river has captured the imagination of several authors and poets, particularly since in very hot summers the river channel can become dry between Dorking and Leatherhead (most recently during the 1976 drought).
In &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; (first published in 1590) Edmund Spenser wrote of the river:

:And Mole, that like a nousling mole doth make
:His way still under ground till Thamis he overtake.

In &quot;Poly-Olbion&quot; (first published in 1612) the poet Michael Drayton described the journey taken by the River Thames to the sea:

:As still his goodly traine yet every houre increast,
:And from the &quot;Surrian&quot; shores cleer &quot;Wey&quot; came down to meet
:His Greatnes, whom the &quot;Tames&quot; so gratiously doth greet
:That with the Fearne-crown&#x27;d Flood he Minion-like doth play:
:Yet is not this the Brook, entiseth him to stay.
:But as they thus, in pompe, came sporting on the shole,
:Gainst &quot;Hampton-Court&quot; he meets the soft and gentle &quot;Mole&quot;.
:Whose eyes so pierc&#x27;t his breast, that seeming to foreslowe
:The way which he so long intended was to go,
:With trifling up and down, he wandreth here and there;
:And that he in her sight, transparent might appeare,
:Applyes himselfe to Fords, and setteth his delight,
:On that which might make him gratious in her sight.

:But &quot;Tames&quot; would hardly on: oft turning back to show,
:For his much loved &quot;Mole&quot; how loth he was to go.
:The mother of the &quot;Mole&quot;, old &quot;Holmsdale&quot;, likewise beares
:Th&#x27;affection of her childe, as ill as they do theirs:
:But &quot;Mole&quot; respects her words, as vaine and idle dreames,
:Compar&#x27;d with that high joy, to be belov&#x27;d of &quot;Tames:&quot;
:And head-long holds her course, his company to win.
:&quot;Mole&quot; digs her selfe a path, by working day and night
:(According to her name, to shew her nature right)
:And underneath the Earth, for three miles space doth creep:
:Till gotten out of sight, quite from her mothers keep,
:Her foreintended course the wanton Nymph doth run;
:As longing to imbrace old &quot;Tame&quot; and &quot;Isis&quot; son...

He writes in the appendix to Song XVII

This &quot;Mole&quot; runnes into the earth, about a mile from &quot;Darking&quot; in &quot;Surrey&quot;, and after some two miles sees the light againe, which to be certaine hath been affirmed by Inhabitants thereabout reporting triall made of it.
John Milton (–1647) described the river as

:sullen Mole that runneth underneath
In a similar vein, Alexander Pope (1688–1744) wrote in his poem &quot;Windsor Forest&quot; (first published 1713)

:And sullen Mole that hides his diving flood
Robert Bloomfield (1766–1823) writes the following lines about the Mole Valley in his 1806 poem &quot;Wild Flowers&quot;.

:Sweet Health, I seek thee! Hither bring
:Thy balm that softens human ills;
:Come on the long drawn clouds that fling
:Their shadows o&#x27;er the Surry-Hills.
:Yon green-topt hills, and far away
:Where late as now I freedom stole,
:And spent one dear delicious day
:On thy wild banks romantic Mole.

:Ay there&#x27;s the scene! Beyond the sweep
:Of London&#x27;s congregated cloud,
:The dark-brow&#x27;d wood, the headlong steep,
:And valley paths without a crowd!
:Here Thames I watch thy flowing tides,
:Thy thousand sails am proud to see;
:But where the Mole all silent glides
:Dwells Peace - and Peace is wealth to me.
Extract from &quot;The River Mole or Emlyn Stream&quot; by Mary Drinkwater Bethune, which was published in 1839.

:Who may count back that forgotten time
:When first the waters forced an outlet here:
:When the foundations of these stedfast hills
:Were shaken, and the long imprisoned stream
:Flowed through the yawning chasm? That awful day
:Yet leaves its trace. The waters find their way,
:Now laughing in the sun - now swallowed up
:In caverns pervious to their course alone,
:They leave their channel dry, and hide awhile
:Their silent flow; like bitter tears, unshed
:From the dim eye, before a careless world
:Unheeding of our grief; but swelling still
:In the full heart, which leaves unsoothed, unseen,
:And broods o&#x27;er ruined hopes, and days gone by.

<doc id="174515" wikidata="Q1063579" url="?curid=174515" title="Dirichlet character">
<text>In analytic number theory and related branches of mathematics, a complex-valued arithmetic function formula_1 is a Dirichlet character of modulus formula_2 (where formula_2 is a positive integer) if for all integers formula_4 and formula_5:
# formula_6 that is, formula_7 is completely multiplicative.
# formula_8 (gcd is the greatest common divisor)
# formula_9; that is, formula_7 is periodic with period formula_2.
The simplest possible character, called the principal character, usually denoted formula_12, (see Notation below) exists for all moduli:
:formula_13
The German mathematician Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet—for whom the character is named—introduced these functions in his 1837 paper on primes in arithmetic progressions.

== Notation ==

formula_14 is Euler&#x27;s totient function.

formula_15 is a complex primitive n-th root of unity:
:formula_16 but formula_17

formula_18 is the group of units mod formula_2. It has order formula_20

formula_21 is the group of Dirichlet characters mod formula_2.

formula_23 etc. are prime numbers.

formula_24 is a standard abbreviation for formula_25

formula_26 etc. are Dirichlet characters. (the lowercase Greek letter chi for &quot;character&quot;)

There is no standard notation for Dirichlet characters that includes the modulus. In many contexts (such as in the proof of Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem) the modulus is fixed. In other contexts, such as this article, characters of different moduli appear. Where appropriate this article employs a variation of Conrey labeling (introduced by Brian Conrey and used by the LMFDB).

In this labeling characters for modulus formula_2 are denoted formula_28 where the index formula_29 is described in the section the group of characters below. In this labeling, formula_30 denotes an unspecified character and
formula_31 denotes the principal character mod formula_2.

== Relation to group characters ==

The word &quot;character&quot; is used several ways in mathematics. In this section it refers to a homomorphism from a group formula_33 (written multiplicatively) to the multiplicative group of the field of complex numbers:
:formula_34

The set of characters is denoted formula_35 If the product of two characters is defined by pointwise multiplication formula_36 the identity by the trivial character formula_37 and the inverse by complex inversion formula_38 then formula_39 becomes an abelian group.

If formula_40 is a finite abelian group then there is an isomorphism formula_41, and the orthogonality relations:

:formula_42     and     formula_43

The elements of the finite abelian group formula_18 are the residue classes formula_45 where formula_46

A group character formula_47 can be extended to a Dirichlet character formula_48 by defining
:formula_49

and conversely, a Dirichlet character mod formula_2 defines a group character on formula_51

Paraphrasing Davenport, Dirichlet characters can be regarded as a particular case of Abelian group characters. But this article follows Dirichlet in giving a direct and constructive account of them. This is partly for historical reasons, in that Dirichlet&#x27;s work preceded by several decades the development of group theory, and partly for a mathematical reason, namely that the group in question has a simple and interesting structure which is obscured if one treats it as one treats the general Abelian group.

== Elementary facts ==

4) Since formula_52 property 2) says formula_53 so it can be canceled from both sides of formula_54:

:formula_55

5) Property 3) is equivalent to

:if formula_56   then formula_57

6) Property 1) implies that, for any positive integer formula_58
:formula_59

7) Euler&#x27;s theorem states that if formula_60 then formula_61 Therefore,
:formula_62

That is, the nonzero values of formula_63 are formula_64-th roots of unity:

:formula_65

for some integer formula_66 which depends on formula_67 and formula_4. This implies there are only a finite number of characters for a given modulus.

8) If formula_7 and formula_70 are two characters for the same modulus so is their product formula_71 defined by pointwise multiplication:
:formula_72   (formula_73 obviously satisfies 1-3).

The principal character is an identity:
:formula_74

9) Let formula_75 denote the inverse of formula_4 in formula_18.
Then
:formula_78 so formula_79 which extends 6) to all integers.

The complex conjugate of a root of unity is also its inverse (see here for details), so for formula_60
:formula_81   (formula_82 also obviously satisfies 1-3).

Thus for all integers formula_4
:formula_84   in other words formula_85. 

10) The multiplication and identity defined in 8) and the inversion defined in 9) turn the set of Dirichlet characters for a given modulus into a finite abelian group.

== The group of characters ==

There are three different cases because the groups formula_18 have different structures depending on whether formula_2 is a power of 2, a power of an odd prime, or the product of prime powers.

=== Powers of odd primes ===

If formula_88 is an odd number formula_89 is cyclic of order formula_90; a generator is called a primitive root mod formula_91.
Let formula_92 be a primitive root and for formula_93 define the function formula_94 (the index of formula_4) by
:formula_96
:formula_97
For formula_98 if and only if formula_99 Since
:formula_100   formula_7 is determined by its value at formula_102

Let formula_103 be a primitive formula_90-th root of unity. From property 7) above the possible values of formula_105 are
formula_106 These distinct values give rise to formula_90 Dirichlet characters mod formula_108 For formula_109 define formula_110 as
:formula_111

Then for formula_112 and all formula_4 and formula_5
:formula_115 showing that formula_116 is a character and
:formula_117 which gives an explicit isomorphism formula_118

==== Examples &quot;m&quot; = 3, 5, 7, 9 ====
2 is a primitive root mod 3.   (formula_119)
:formula_120
so the values of formula_121 are
:formula_122.
The nonzero values of the characters mod 3 are
:formula_123

2 is a primitive root mod 5.   (formula_124)
:formula_125
so the values of formula_126 are
:formula_127.
The nonzero values of the characters mod 5 are
:formula_128

3 is a primitive root mod 7.   (formula_129)
:formula_130
so the values of formula_131 are
:formula_132.
The nonzero values of the characters mod 7 are (formula_133)
:formula_134.

2 is a primitive root mod 9.   (formula_135)
:formula_136
so the values of formula_137 are
:formula_138.
The nonzero values of the characters mod 9 are (formula_133)
:formula_140.

=== Powers of 2 ===

formula_141 is the trivial group with one element. formula_142 is cyclic of order 2. For 8, 16, and higher powers of 2, there is no primitive root; the powers of 5 are the units formula_143 and their negatives are the units formula_144
For example
:formula_145
:formula_146
:formula_147
Let formula_148; then formula_89 is the direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 (generated by −1) and a cyclic group of order formula_150 (generated by 5).
For odd numbers formula_4 define the functions formula_152 and formula_153 by
:formula_154
:formula_155
For odd formula_4 and formula_157 if and only if formula_158 and formula_99
For odd formula_4 the value of formula_161 is determined by the values of formula_162 and formula_163

Let formula_164 be a primitive formula_150-th root of unity. The possible values of formula_166 are
formula_167 These distinct values give rise to formula_90 Dirichlet characters mod formula_108 For odd formula_170 define formula_110 by
:formula_172
Then for odd formula_66 and formula_174 and all formula_4 and formula_5
:formula_177 showing that formula_116 is a character and
:formula_179 showing that formula_180

==== Examples &quot;m&quot; = 2, 4, 8, 16 ====

The only character mod 2 is the principal character formula_181.

−1 is a primitive root mod 4 (formula_182)

:formula_183

The nonzero values of the characters mod 4 are
:formula_184

−1 is and 5 generate the units mod 8 (formula_185)

:formula_186.

The nonzero values of the characters mod 8 are
:formula_187

−1 and 5 generate the units mod 16 (formula_188)
:formula_189.

The nonzero values of the characters mod 16 are

:formula_190.

=== Products of prime powers ===
Let formula_191 where formula_192 be the factorization of formula_2 into prime powers. The group of units mod formula_2 is isomorphic to the direct product of the groups mod the formula_195:
:formula_196
This means that 1) there is a one-to-one correspondence between formula_197 and formula_198-tuples formula_199 where formula_200 
and 2) multiplication mod formula_2 corresponds to coordinate-wise multiplication of formula_198-tuples: 
:formula_203 corresponds to 
:formula_204 where formula_205

The Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) implies that the formula_206 are simply formula_207

There are subgroups formula_208 such that 
:formula_209 and
:formula_210

Then formula_211
and every formula_197 corresponds to a formula_198-tuple formula_214 where formula_215 and formula_216 
Every formula_197 can be uniquely factored as formula_218

If formula_219 is a character mod formula_220 on the subgroup formula_221 it must be identical to some formula_222 mod formula_195 Then
:formula_224
showing that every character mod formula_225 is the product of characters mod the formula_195. 

For formula_227 define
:formula_228
Then for formula_229 and all formula_4 and formula_5
:formula_232 showing that formula_233 is a character and
:formula_234 showing an isomorphism formula_235
==== Examples &quot;m&quot; = 15, 24, 40 ====

formula_236

The factorization of the characters mod 15 is
:formula_237
The nonzero values of the characters mod 15 are

:formula_238.

formula_239
The factorization of the characters mod 24 is
:formula_240

The nonzero values of the characters mod 24 are

:formula_241.

formula_242
The factorization of the characters mod 40 is
:formula_243

The nonzero values of the characters mod 40 are

:formula_244.

=== Summary ===
Let formula_245, formula_246 be the factorization of formula_2 and assume formula_248

There are formula_64 Dirichlet characters mod formula_250 They are denoted by formula_251 where formula_252 is equivalent to formula_253
The identity formula_254 is an isomorphism formula_235

Each character mod formula_2 has a unique factorization as the product of characters mod the prime powers dividing formula_2:
:formula_258

If formula_259 the product formula_260 is a character formula_261 where formula_29 is given by formula_263 and formula_264

Also,
formula_265

== Orthogonality ==

The two orthogonality relations are
:formula_266     and     formula_267

The relations can be written in the symmetric form
:formula_268     and     formula_269

The first relation is easy to prove: If formula_270 there are formula_64 non-zero summands each equal to 1. If formula_272there is some formula_273  Then
:formula_274   implying
:formula_275   Dividing by the first factor gives formula_276 QED. The identity formula_277 for formula_229 shows that the relations are equivalent to each other. 

The second relation can be proven directly in the same way, but requires a lemma
:Given formula_279 there is a formula_280

The second relation has an important corollary: if formula_281 define the function
:formula_282   Then
:formula_283
That is formula_284 the indicator function of the residue class formula_285. It is basic in the proof of Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem.

== Classification of characters ==

=== Conductor; Primitive and induced characters ===

Any character mod a prime power is also a character mod every larger power. For example, mod 16

:formula_286

formula_287 has period 16, but formula_288 has period 8 and formula_289 has period 4:   formula_290 and  formula_291

We say that a character formula_7 of modulus formula_91 has a quasiperiod of formula_294 if formula_295 for all formula_2, formula_58 coprime to formula_91 satisfying formula_299 mod formula_294. For example, formula_181, the only Dirichlet character of modulus formula_302, has a quasiperiod of formula_303, but &quot;not&quot; a period of formula_303 (it has a period of formula_302, though). The smallest positive integer for which formula_7 is quasiperiodic is the conductor of formula_7. So, for instance, formula_181 has a conductor of formula_303.

The conductor of formula_287 is 16, the conductor of formula_288 is 8 and that of formula_289 and formula_313 is 4. If the modulus and conductor are equal the character is primitive, otherwise imprimitive. An imprimitive character is induced by the character for the smallest modulus: formula_288 is induced from formula_315 and formula_289 and formula_313 are induced from formula_318.

A related phenomenon can happen with a character mod the product of primes; its &quot;nonzero values&quot; may be periodic with a smaller period.

For example, mod 15,
:formula_319.

The nonzero values of formula_320 have period 15, but those of formula_321 have period 3 and those of formula_322 have period 5. This is easier to see by juxtaposing them with characters mod 3 and 5:

:formula_323.

If a character mod formula_324 is defined as
:formula_325,   or equivalently as formula_326
its nonzero values are determined by the character mod formula_91 and have period formula_91.

The smallest period of the nonzero values is the conductor of the character. For example, the conductor of formula_320 is 15, the conductor of formula_321 is 3, and that of formula_322 is 5.

As in the prime-power case, if the conductor equals the modulus the character is primitive, otherwise imprimitive. If imprimitive it is induced from the character with the smaller modulus. For example, formula_321 is induced from formula_333 and formula_322 is induced from formula_335

The principal character is not primitive.

The character formula_258 is primitive if and only if each of the factors is primitive.

Primitive characters often simplify (or make possible) formulas in the theories of L-functions and modular forms.

=== Parity ===

formula_63 is even if formula_338 and is odd if formula_339

This distinction appears in the functional equation of the Dirichlet L-function.

=== Order ===

The order of a character is its order as an element of the group formula_21, i.e. the smallest positive integer formula_58 such that formula_342 Because of the isomorphism formula_343 the order of formula_233 is the same as the order of formula_66 in formula_346 The principal character has order 1; other real characters have order 2, and imaginary characters have order 3 or greater. By Lagrange&#x27;s theorem the order of a character divides the order of formula_21 which is formula_64

=== Real characters ===

formula_63 is real or quadratic if all of its values are real (they must be formula_350); otherwise it is complex or imaginary.

formula_7 is real if and only if formula_352; formula_353 is real if and only if formula_354; in particular, formula_355 is real and non-principal.

Dirichlet&#x27;s original proof that formula_356 (which was only valid for prime moduli) took two different forms depending on whether formula_7 was real or not. His later proof, valid for all moduli, was based on his class number formula.

Real characters are Kronecker symbols; for example, the principal character can be written
formula_358.

The real characters in the examples are:

==== Principal ====
If formula_359 the principal character is formula_360

formula_361  
formula_362  
formula_363  
formula_364  
formula_365  
formula_366  
formula_367  

==== Primitive ====

If the modulus is the absolute value of a fundamental discriminant there is a real primitive character (there are two if the modulus is a multiple of 8); otherwise if there are any primitive characters they are imaginary.

formula_368  
formula_369  
formula_370  
formula_371  
formula_372  
formula_373  
formula_374  
formula_375  
formula_376  
formula_377  
formula_378

==== Imprimitive ====

formula_379  
formula_380  
formula_381  
formula_382  
formula_383  
formula_384  
formula_385  

formula_386  
formula_387  
formula_388  
formula_389  
formula_390  

formula_391  
formula_392  
formula_393  
formula_394  
formula_395  

== Applications ==

=== L-functions ===
The Dirichlet L-series for a character formula_7 is

:formula_397

This series only converges for formula_398; it can be analytically continued to a meromorphic function.

Dirichlet introduced the formula_399-function along with the characters in his 1837 paper.

=== Modular forms and functions ===

Dirichlet characters appear several places in the theory of modular forms and functions. A typical example is

Let formula_400 and let formula_401 be primitive.

If
:formula_402
define
:formula_403,  
Then
:formula_404. If formula_405 is a cusp form so is formula_406
See theta series of a Dirichlet character for another example.

=== Gauss sum ===
The Gauss sum of a Dirichlet character modulo is
:formula_407
It appears in the functional equation of the Dirichlet L-function.

=== Jacobi sum ===
If formula_408 and formula_409 are Dirichlet characters mod a prime formula_410 their Jacobi sum is

: formula_411
Jacobi sums can be factored into products of Gauss sums.

=== Kloosterman sum ===
If formula_7 is a Dirichlet character mod formula_91 and formula_414 the Kloosterman sum formula_415 is defined as

:formula_416

If formula_417 it is a Gauss sum.

== Sufficient conditions ==
It is not necessary to establish the defining properties 1) – 3) to show that a function is a Dirichlet character.

=== From Davenport&#x27;s book ===

If formula_418 such that
:1)   formula_419
:2)   formula_420,
:3)   If formula_421 then formula_422, but
:4)   formula_423 is not always 0,
then formula_423 is one of the formula_64 characters mod formula_2

=== Sárközy&#x27;s Condition ===
A Dirichlet character is a completely multiplicative function formula_427 that satisfies a linear recurrence relation: that is, if formula_428

for all positive integers formula_58, where formula_430 are not all zero and formula_431 are distinct then formula_405 is a Dirichlet character.

=== Chudakov&#x27;s Condition ===
A Dirichlet character is a completely multiplicative function formula_427 satisfying the following three properties: a) formula_405 takes only finitely many values; b) formula_405 vanishes at only finitely many primes; c) there is an formula_436 for which the remainder

formula_437

is uniformly bounded, as formula_438. This equivalent definition of Dirichlet characters was conjectured by Chudakov in 1956, and proved in 2017 by Klurman and Mangerel.

<text>Infrastructure is the set of facilities and systems that serve a country, city, or other area, and encompasses the services and facilities necessary for its economy, households and firms to function. Infrastructure is composed of public and private physical structures such as roads, railways, bridges, airports, public transit systems, tunnels, water supply, sewers, electrical grids, and telecommunications (including Internet connectivity and broadband access). In general, infrastructure has been defined as &quot;the physical components of interrelated systems providing commodities and services essential to enable, sustain, or enhance societal living conditions&quot; and maintain the surrounding environment.

Especially in light of the massive societal transformations needed to mitigate and adapt to climate change, contemporary infrastructure conversations frequently focus on sustainable development and green infrastructure. Acknowledging this importance, the international community has created policy focused on sustainable infrastructure through the Sustainable Development Goals, especially Sustainable Development Goal 9 &quot;Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure&quot;.

One way to describe different types of infrastructure is to classify them as two distinct kinds: hard infrastructure and soft infrastructure. Hard infrastructure is the physical networks necessary for the functioning of a modern industrial society or industry. This includes roads, bridges, and railways. Soft infrastructure is all the institutions that maintain the economic, health, social, environmental, and cultural standards of a country. This includes educational programs, official statistics, parks and recreational facilities, law enforcement agencies, and emergency services.

==Classifications==
A 1987 US National Research Council panel adopted the term &quot;public works infrastructure&quot;, referring to:

&quot;... both specific functional modes – highways, streets, roads, and bridges; mass transit; airports and airways; water supply and water resources; wastewater management; solid-waste treatment and disposal; electric power generation and transmission; telecommunications; and hazardous waste management – and the combined system these modal elements comprise. A comprehension of infrastructure spans not only these public works facilities, but also the operating procedures, management practices, and development policies that interact together with societal demand and the physical world to facilitate the transport of people and goods, provision of water for drinking and a variety of other uses, safe disposal of society&#x27;s waste products, provision of energy where it is needed, and transmission of information within and between communities.&quot;
The American Society of Civil Engineers publishes an &quot;Infrastructure Report Card&quot; which represents the organization&#x27;s opinion on the condition of various infrastructure every 2–4 years. they grade 16 categories, namely aviation, bridges, dams, drinking water, energy, hazardous waste, inland waterways, levees, parks and recreation, ports, rail, roads, schools, solid waste, transit and wastewater. The United States has received a rating of &quot;D+&quot; on its infrastructure. This aging infrastructure is a result of governmental neglect and inadequate funding. As the United States presumably looks to upgrade its existing infrastructure, sustainable measures could be a consideration of the design, build, and operation plans.

===Public===
Public infrastructure is that owned or available for use by the public (represented by the government). It includes:
* Transport infrastructure – vehicles, road, rail, cable and financing of transport
** Aviation infrastructure – air traffic control technology in aviation
** Rail transport – trackage, signals, electrification of rails
** Road transport – roads, bridges, tunnels
* Critical infrastructure – assets required to sustain human life
* Energy infrastructure – transmission and storage of fossil fuels and renewable sources
* Information and communication infrastructure – systems of information storage and distribution
* Public capital – government-owned assets
* Public works – municipal infrastructure, maintenance functions and agencies
* Municipal solid waste – generation, collection, management of trash/garbage
* Sustainable urban infrastructure – technology, architecture, policy for sustainable living
* Water supply network – the distribution and maintenance of water supply
* Wastewater infrastructure – disposal and treatment of wastewater
* Infrastructure-based development

=== Personal ===
A way to embody personal infrastructure is to think of it in terms of human capital. Human capital is defined by the Encyclopædia Britannica as &quot;intangible collective resources possessed by individuals and groups within a given population&quot;. The goal of personal infrastructure is to determine the quality of the economic agents&#x27; values. This results in three major tasks: the task of economic proxies in the economic process (teachers, unskilled and qualified labor, etc.); the importance of personal infrastructure for an individual (short and long-term consumption of education); and the social relevance of personal infrastructure. Essentially, personal infrastructure maps the human impact on infrastructure as it is related to the economy, individual growth, and social impact.

=== Institutional ===
Institutional infrastructure branches from the term &quot;economic constitution&quot;. According to Gianpiero Torrisi, institutional infrastructure is the object of economic and legal policy. It compromises the growth and sets norms. It refers to the degree of fair treatment of equal economic data and determines the framework within which economic agents may formulate their own economic plans and carry them out in co-operation with others.

=== Sustainable ===
Sustainable infrastructure refers to the processes of design and construction that take into consideration their environmental, economic, and social impact. Included in this section are several elements of sustainable schemes, including materials, water, energy, transportation, and waste management infrastructure. Although there are endless other factors of consideration, those will not be covered in this section.

===Material===
Material infrastructure is defined as &quot;those immobile, non-circulating capital goods that essentially contribute to the production of infrastructure goods and services needed to satisfy basic physical and social requirements of economic agents&quot;. There are two distinct qualities of material infrastructures: 1) fulfillment of social needs and 2) mass production. The first characteristic deals with the basic needs of human life. The second characteristic is the non-availability of infrastructure goods and services. Today, there are various materials that can be used to build infrastructure. The most prevalent ones are asphalt, concrete, steel, masonry, wood, polymers and composites.

=== Economic ===
According to the business dictionary, economic infrastructure can be defined as &quot;internal facilities of a country that make business activity possible, such as communication, transportation and distribution networks, financial institutions and related international markets, and energy supply systems&quot;. Economic infrastructure support productive activities and events. This includes roads, highways, bridges, airports, cycling infrastructure, water distribution networks, sewer systems, and irrigation plants.

=== Social ===

Social infrastructure can be broadly defined as the construction and maintenance of facilities that support social services. Social infrastructures are created to increase social comfort and promote economic activity. These include schools, parks and playgrounds, structures for public safety, waste disposal plants, hospitals, and sports areas.

=== Core ===

Core assets provide essential services and have monopolistic characteristics. Investors seeking core infrastructure look for five different characteristics: income, low volatility of returns, diversification, inflation protection, and long-term liability matching. Core infrastructure incorporates all the main types of infrastructure, such as roads, highways, railways, public transportation, water, and gas supply.

=== Basic ===
Basic infrastructure refers to main railways, roads, canals, harbors and docks, the electromagnetic telegraph, drainage, dikes, and land reclamation. It consist of the more well-known and common features of infrastructure that we come across in our daily lives (buildings, roads, docks).

=== Complementary ===
Complementary infrastructure refers to things like light railways, tramways, and gas/electricity/water supply. To complement something means to bring it to perfection or complete it. Complementary infrastructure deals with the little parts of the engineering world that make life more convenient and efficient. They are needed to ensure successful usage and marketing of an already finished product, like in the case of road bridges. Other examples are lights on sidewalks, landscaping around buildings, and benches where pedestrians can rest.

==Applications==

===Engineering and construction===
Engineers generally limit the term &quot;infrastructure&quot; to describe fixed assets that are in the form of a large network; in other words, hard infrastructure. Efforts to devise more generic definitions of infrastructures have typically referred to the network aspects of most of the structures, and to the accumulated value of investments in the networks as assets. One such definition from 1998 defined infrastructure as the network of assets &quot;where the system as a whole is intended to be maintained indefinitely at a specified standard of service by the continuing replacement and refurbishment of its components&quot;.

===Civil defense and economic development===

Civil defense planners and developmental economists generally refer to both hard and soft infrastructure, including public services such as schools and hospitals, emergency services such as police and fire fighting, and basic services in the economic sector. The notion of infrastructure-based development combining long-term infrastructure investments by government agencies at central and regional levels with public private partnerships has proven popular among economists in Asia (notably Singapore and China), mainland Europe, and Latin America.

===Military===
Military infrastructure is the buildings and permanent installations necessary for the support of military forces, whether they are stationed in bases, being deployed or engaged in operations. Examples include barracks, headquarters, airfields, communications facilities, stores of military equipment, port installations, and maintenance stations.

===Communications===
Communications infrastructure is the informal and formal channels of communication, political and social networks, or beliefs held by members of particular groups, as well as information technology, software development tools. Still underlying these more conceptual uses is the idea that infrastructure provides organizing structure and support for the system or organization it serves, whether it is a city, a nation, a corporation, or a collection of people with common interests. Examples include IT infrastructure, research infrastructure, terrorist infrastructure, employment infrastructure, and tourism infrastructure.

==Related concepts==
The term &quot;infrastructure&quot; may be confused with the following overlapping or related concepts.

Land improvement and land development are general terms that in some contexts may include infrastructure, but in the context of a discussion of infrastructure would refer only to smaller-scale systems or works that are not included in infrastructure, because they are typically limited to a single parcel of land, and are owned and operated by the landowner. For example, an irrigation canal that serves a region or district would be included with infrastructure, but the private irrigation systems on individual land parcels would be considered land improvements, not infrastructure. Service connections to municipal service and public utility networks would also be considered land improvements, not infrastructure.

The term &quot;public works&quot; includes government-owned and operated infrastructure as well as public buildings, such as schools and courthouses. Public works generally refers to physical assets needed to deliver public services. Public services include both infrastructure and services generally provided by the government.

==Ownership and financing==

Infrastructure may be owned and managed by governments or by privately held companies, such as sole public utility or railway companies. Generally, most roads, major airports and other ports, water distribution systems, and sewage networks are publicly owned, whereas most energy and telecommunications networks are privately owned. Publicly owned infrastructure may be paid for from taxes, tolls, or metered user fees, whereas private infrastructure is generally paid for by metered user fees. Major investment projects are generally financed by the issuance of long-term bonds.

Government-owned and operated infrastructure may be developed and operated in the private sector or in public-private partnerships, in addition to in the public sector. in the United States for example, public spending on infrastructure has varied between 2.3% and 3.6% of GDP since 1950. Many financial institutions invest in infrastructure.

==In the developing world==
According to researchers at the Overseas Development Institute, the lack of infrastructure in many developing countries represents one of the most significant limitations to economic growth and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Infrastructure investments and maintenance can be very expensive, especially in such areas as landlocked, rural and sparsely populated countries in Africa. It has been argued that infrastructure investments contributed to more than half of Africa&#x27;s improved growth performance between 1990 and 2005, and increased investment is necessary to maintain growth and tackle poverty. The returns to investment in infrastructure are very significant, with on average thirty to forty percent returns for telecommunications (ICT) investments, over forty percent for electricity generation, and eighty percent for roads.

===Regional differences===
The demand for infrastructure both by consumers and by companies is much higher than the amount invested. There are severe constraints on the supply side of the provision of infrastructure in Asia. The infrastructure financing gap between what is invested in Asia-Pacific (around US$48 billion) and what is needed (US$228 billion) is around US$180 billion every year.

In Latin America, three percent of GDP (around US$71 billion) would need to be invested in infrastructure in order to satisfy demand, yet in 2005, for example, only around two percent was invested leaving a financing gap of approximately US$24 billion.

In Africa, in order to reach the seven percent annual growth calculated to be required to meet the MDGs by 2015 would require infrastructure investments of about fifteen percent of GDP, or around US$93 billion a year. In fragile states, over thirty-seven percent of GDP would be required.

===Sources of funding for infrastructure===
The source of financing for infrastructure varies significantly across sectors. Some sectors are dominated by government spending, others by overseas development aid (ODA), and yet others by private investors. In California, infrastructure financing districts are established by local governments to pay for physical facilities and services within a specified area by using property tax increases. In order to facilitate investment of the private sector in developing countries&#x27; infrastructure markets, it is necessary to design risk-allocation mechanisms more carefully, given the higher risks of their markets.

The spending money that comes from the government is less than it used to be. From the 1930s to 2019, the United States went from spending 4.2% of GDP to 2.5% of GDP on infrastructure. These under investments have accrued, in fact, according to the 2017 ASCE Infrastructure Report Card, from 2016 to 2025, infrastructure will be underinvested by $2 trillion. Compared to the global GDP percentages, The United States is tied for second-to-last place, with an average percentage of 2.4%. This means that the government spends less money on repairing old infrastructure and or on infrastructure as a whole.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, governments spend around US$9.4 billion out of a total of US$24.9 billion. In irrigation, governments represent almost all spending. In transport and energy a majority of investment is government spending. In ICT and water supply and sanitation, the private sector represents the majority of capital expenditure. Overall, between them aid, the private sector, and non-OECD financiers exceed government spending. The private sector spending alone equals state capital expenditure, though the majority is focused on ICT infrastructure investments. External financing increased in the 2000s (decade) and in Africa alone external infrastructure investments increased from US$7 billion in 2002 to US$27 billion in 2009. China, in particular, has emerged as an important investor.

== Coronavirus implications ==
The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated the underfunding of infrastructure globally that has been accumulating for decades. The pandemic has increased unemployment and has widely disrupted the economy. This has serious impacts on households, businesses, and federal, state and local governments. This is especially detrimental to infrastructure because it is so dependent on funding from government agencieswith state and local governments accounting for approximately 75% of spending on public infrastructure in the United States.

Governments are facing enormous decreases in revenue, economic downturns, overworked health systems, and hesitant workforces, resulting in huge budget deficits across the board. However, they must also scale up public investment to ensure successful reopening, boost growth and employment, and green their economies. The unusually large scale of the packages needed for COVID-19 was accompanied by widespread calls for &quot;greening&quot; them to meet the dual goals of economic recovery and environmental sustainability. However, as of March 2021, only a small fraction of the G20 COVID-19 related fiscal measures was found to be climate friendly.

== Sustainable infrastructure ==

Although it is readily apparent that much effort is needed to repair the economic damage inflicted by the Coronavirus epidemic, an immediate return to business as usual could be environmentally harmful, as shown by the 2007-08 financial crisis in the United States. While the ensuing economic slowdown reduced global greenhouse gas emissions in 2009, emissions reached a record high in 2010, partially due to governments&#x27; implemented economic stimulus measures with minimal consideration of the environmental consequences. The concern is whether this same pattern will repeat itself. The post-COVID-19 period could determine whether the world meets or misses the emissions goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement and limits global warming to 1.5 degrees C to 2 degrees C.

As a result of the COVID-19 epidemic, a host of factors could jeopardize a low-carbon recovery plan: this includes reduced attention on the global political stage (2020 UN Climate Summit has been postponed to 2021), the relaxing of environmental regulations in pursuit of economic growth, decreased oil prices preventing low-carbon technologies from being competitive, and finally, stimulus programs that take away funds that could have been used to further the process of decarbonization. Research suggests that a recovery plan based on lower-carbon emissions could not only make significant emissions reductions needed to battle climate change, but also create more economic growth and jobs than a high-carbon recovery plan would. A study published in the Oxford Review of Economic Policy, more than 200 economists and economic officials reported that &quot;green&quot; economic-recovery initiatives performed at least as well as less &quot;green&quot; initiatives. There have also been calls for an independent body could provide a comparable assessment of countries&#x27; fiscal policies, promoting transparency and accountability at the international level.

In addition, in an econometric study published in the Economic Modelling journal, an analysis on government energy technology spending showed that spending on the renewable energy sector created five more jobs per million dollars invested than spending on fossil fuels. Since sustainable infrastructure is more beneficial in both an economic and environmental context, it represents the future of infrastructure. Especially with increasing pressure from climate change and diminishing natural resources, infrastructure not only needs to maintain economic development and job development, and a high quality of life for residents, but also protect the environment and its natural resources.

=== Sustainable energy ===
Sustainable energy infrastructure includes types of renewable energy power plants as well as the means of exchange from the plant to the homes and businesses that use that energy. Renewable energy includes well researched and widely implemented methods such as wind, solar, and hydraulic power, as well as newer and less commonly used types of power creation such as fusion energy. Sustainable energy infrastructure must maintain a strong supply relative to demand, and must also maintain sufficiently low prices for consumers so as not to decrease demand. Any type of renewable energy infrastructure that fails to meet these consumption and price requirements will ultimately be forced out of the market by prevailing non renewable energy sources.

=== Sustainable water ===
Sustainable water infrastructure is focused on a community&#x27;s sufficient access to clean, safe drinking water. Water is a public good along with electricity, which means that sustainable water catchment and distribution systems must remain affordable to all members of a population. &quot;Sustainable Water&quot; may refer to a nation or community&#x27;s ability to be self-sustainable, with enough water to meet multiple needs including agriculture, industry, sanitation, and drinking water. It can also refer to the holistic and effective management of water resources. Increasingly, policy makers and regulators are incorporating Nature-based solutions (NBS or NbS) into attempts to achieve sustainable water infrastructure.

=== Sustainable waste management ===
Sustainable waste management systems aim to minimize the amount of waste products produced by individuals and corporations. Commercial waste management plans have transitioned from simple waste removal plans into comprehensive plans focused on reducing the total amount of waste produced before removal. Sustainable waste management is beneficial environmentally, and can also cut costs for businesses that reduce their amount of disposed goods.

=== Sustainable transportation ===

Sustainable transportation includes a shift away from private, greenhouse gas emitting cars in favor of adopting methods of transportation that are either carbon neutral or reduce carbon emissions such as bikes or electric bus systems. Additionally, cities must invest in the appropriate built environments for these ecologically preferable modes of transportation. Cities will need to invest in public transportation networks, as well as bike path networks among other sustainable solutions that incentivize citizens to use these alternate transit options. Reducing the urban dependency on cars is a fundamental goal of developing sustainable transportation, and this cannot be accomplished without a coordinated focus on both creating the methods of transportation themselves and providing them with networks that are equally or more efficient than existing car networks such as aging highway systems.

=== Sustainable materials ===
Another solution to transition into a more sustainable infrastructure is using more sustainable materials. A material is sustainable if the needed amount can be produced without depleting non-renewable resources. It also should have low environmental impacts by not disrupting the established steady-state equilibrium of it. The materials should also be resilient, renewable, reusable, and recyclable.

Today, concrete is one of the most common materials used in infrastructure. There is twice as much concrete used in construction than all other building materials combined. It is the backbone of industrialization, as it is used in bridges, piers, pipelines, pavements, and buildings. However, while they do serve as a connection between cities, transportation for people and goods, and protection for land against flooding and erosion, they only last for 50 to 100 years. Many were built within the last 50 years, which means many infrastructures need substantial maintenance to continue functioning.

However, concrete is not sustainable. The production of concrete contributes up to 8% of the world&#x27;s greenhouse gas emissions. A tenth of the world&#x27;s industrial water usage is from producing concrete. Even transporting the raw materials to concrete production sites adds to airborne pollution. Furthermore, the production sites and the infrastructures themselves all strip away agricultural land that could have been fertile soil or habitats vital to the ecosystem.

== Green infrastructure ==

Green infrastructure is a type of sustainable infrastructure. Green infrastructure uses plant or soil systems to restore some of the natural processes needed to manage water, reduce the effects of disasters such as flooding, and create healthier urban environments. In a more practical sense, it refers to a decentralized network of stormwater management practices, which includes green roofs, trees, bioretention and infiltration, and permeable pavement. Green infrastructure has become an increasingly popular strategy in recent years due to its effectiveness in providing ecological, economic, and social benefitsincluding positively impacting energy consumption, air quality, and carbon reduction and sequestration.

=== Green roofs ===

A green roof is a rooftop that is partially or completely covered with growing vegetation planted over a membrane. It also includes additional layers, including a root barrier and drainage and irrigation systems. There are several categories of green roofs, including extensive (have a growing media depth ranging from two to six inches) and intensive (have a growing media with a depth greater than six inches). One benefit of green roofs is that they reduce stormwater runoff because of its ability to store water in its growing media, reducing the runoff entering the sewer system and waterways, which also decreases the risk of combined sewer overflows. They reduce energy usage since the growing media provides additional insulation, reduces the amount of solar radiation on the roof&#x27;s surface, and provides evaporative cooling from water in the plants, which reduce the roof surface temperatures and heat influx. Green roofs also reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide since the vegetation sequesters carbon and, since they reduce energy usage and the urban heat island by reducing the roof temperature, they also lower carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation.

=== Tree planting ===
Tree planting provides a host of ecological, social, and economic benefits. Trees can intercept rain, support infiltration and water storage in soil, diminish the impact of raindrops on barren surfaces, minimize soil moisture through transpiration, and they help reduce stormwater runoff. Additionally, trees contribute to recharging local aquifers and improve the health of watershed systems. Trees also reduce energy usage by providing shade and releasing water into the atmosphere which cools the air and reduces the amount of heat absorbed by buildings. Finally, trees improve air quality by absorbing harmful air pollutants reducing the amount of greenhouse gases.

=== Bioretention and infiltration practices ===
There are a variety of types of bioretention and infiltration practices, including rain gardens and bioswales. A rain garden is planted in a small depression or natural slope and includes native shrubs and flowers. They temporarily hold and absorb rain water and are effective in removing up to 90% of nutrients and chemicals and up to 80% of sediments from the runoff. As a result, they soak 30% more water than conventional gardens. Bioswales are planted in paved areas like parking lots or sidewalks and are made to allow for overflow into the sewer system by trapping silt and other pollutants, which are normally left over from impermeable surfaces. Both rain gardens and bioswales mitigate flood impacts and prevent stormwater from polluting local waterways; increase the usable water supply by reducing the amount of water needed for outdoor irrigation; improve air quality by minimizing the amount of water going into treatment facilities, which also reduces energy usage and, as a result, reduces air pollution since less greenhouse gases are emitted.

== Smart cities ==

Smart cities use innovative methods of design and implementation in various sectors of infrastructure and planning to create communities that operate at a higher level of relative sustainability than their traditional counterparts. In a sustainable city, urban resilience as well as infrastructure reliability must both be present. Urban resilience is defined by a city&#x27;s capacity to quickly adapt or recover from infrastructure defects, and infrastructure reliability means that systems must work efficiently while continuing to maximize their output. When urban resilience and infrastructure reliability interact, cities are able to produce the same level of output at similarly reasonable costs as compared to other non sustainable communities, while still maintaining ease of operation and usage.

=== Masdar City ===

Masdar City is a proposed zero emission smart city that will be contracted in the United Arab Emirates. Some individuals have referred to this planned settlement as &quot;utopia-like&quot;, due to the fact that it will feature multiple sustainable infrastructure elements, including energy, water, waste management, and transportation. Masdar City will have a power infrastructure containing renewable energy methods including solar energy.

Masdar City is located in a desert region, meaning that sustainable collection and distribution of water is dependent on the city&#x27;s ability to use water at innovative stages of the water cycle. The city will use groundwater, greywater, seawater, blackwater, and other water resources to obtain both drinking and landscaping water.

Initially, Masdar City will be waste-free. Recycling and other waste management and waste reduction methods will be encouraged. Additionally, the city will implement a system to convert waste into fertilizer, which will decrease the amount of space needed for waste accumulation as well as provide an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional fertilizer production methods.

No cars will be allowed in Masdar City, contributing to low carbon emissions within the city boundaries. Instead, alternative transportation options will be prioritized during infrastructure development. This means that a bike lane network will be accessible and comprehensive, and other options will also be available.

<text>The Anatomy of Melancholy (full title: The Anatomy of Melancholy, What it is: With all the Kinds, Causes, Symptomes, Prognostickes, and Several Cures of it. In Three Maine Partitions with their several Sections, Members, and Subsections. Philosophically, Medicinally, Historically, Opened and Cut Up) is a book by Robert Burton, first published in 1621, but republished five more times over the next seventeen years with massive alterations and expansions.

== Overview ==
On its surface, the book is presented as a medical textbook in which Burton applies his vast and varied learning, in the scholastic manner, to the subject of melancholia (or clinical depression). Although presented as a medical text, &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot; is as much a &quot;sui generis&quot; (unique) work of literature as it is a scientific or philosophical text, as Burton covers far more than the titular subject. &quot;Anatomy&quot; uses melancholy as a lens through which all human emotion and thought may be scrutinized, and virtually the entire contents of a 17th-century library are marshalled into service of this goal. It is encyclopedic in its range and reference.

In his satirical preface to the reader, Burton&#x27;s persona and pseudonym &quot;Democritus Junior&quot; explains, &quot;I write of melancholy by being busy to avoid melancholy.&quot; This is characteristic of the author&#x27;s style, which often supersedes the book&#x27;s strengths as a medical text or historical document as its main source of appeal to admirers. Both satirical and serious in tone, the &quot;Anatomy&quot; is &quot;vitalized by [Burton&#x27;s] pervading humour&quot;, and Burton&#x27;s digressive and inclusive style, often verging on a stream of consciousness, consistently informs and animates the text. In addition to the author&#x27;s techniques, the &quot;Anatomy&quot;″s vast breadth – addressing topics such as digestion, goblins, the geography of America, and others – make it a valuable contribution to multiple disciplines.

== Publication ==
Burton was an obsessive editor of his own work, publishing five revised and expanded editions of &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot; during his lifetime. It has often been out of print, particularly between 1676 and 1800. Because no original manuscript of the &quot;Anatomy&quot; has survived, later reprints have drawn more or less faithfully from the editions published during Burton&#x27;s life. Early editions have entered the public domain, with several available from online sources such as Project Gutenberg. In recent decades, increased interest in the book, combined with its public domain status, has resulted in new print editions, most recently a 2001 reprinting of the 1932 edition by &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; under its &quot;NYRB Classics&quot; imprint (), and a new edition in 2023 under the Penguin Classics imprint, edited by Angus Gowland ().

== Synopsis ==
Burton defined his subject as:

In expounding on his subject, Burton drew from nearly every science of his day, including psychology and physiology, but also astronomy, meteorology, theology, and even astrology and demonology.

Much of the book quotes ancient and medieval medical authorities, beginning with Hippocrates, Aristotle, and Galen. Hence the &quot;Anatomy&quot; is filled with more or less pertinent references to the works of others. A competent Latinist, Burton included a great deal of Latin poetry in the &quot;Anatomy&quot;, much of it from ancient sources left untranslated. Although his &quot;citations&quot; sound convincing, many are incorrect, taken out of context, or simply fabricated.

&quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot; is especially lengthy, the first edition being a single quarto volume nearly 900 pages long; subsequent editions were even longer. The text has three major sections plus an introduction, written in Burton&#x27;s sprawling style. Characteristically, the introduction includes not only an author&#x27;s note (titled &quot;Democritus Junior to the Reader&quot;), but also a Latin poem (&quot;Democritus Junior to His Book&quot;), a warning to &quot;The Reader Who Employs His Leisure Ill&quot;, an abstract of the following text, and another poem explaining the frontispiece. The following three sections proceed in a similarly exhaustive fashion: the first section focuses on the causes and symptoms of &quot;common&quot; melancholies, the second section deals with cures for melancholy, and the third section explores more complex and esoteric melancholies, including the melancholy of lovers and all manner of religious melancholies. The &quot;Anatomy&quot; concludes with an extensive index (which &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; called &quot;a readerly pleasure in itself&quot;). Most modern editions add explanatory notes and translate most of the Latin.

== Critical reception ==
Admirers of &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot; range from Samuel Johnson, Holbrook Jackson (whose &quot;Anatomy of Bibliomania&quot; [1930] was based on the style and presentation), George Armstrong Custer, Charles Lamb and John Keats (who said it was his favourite book) to Northrop Frye, Stanley Fish, Anthony Powell, Philip Pullman, Cy Twombly, Jorge Luis Borges (who used a quote as an epigraph to his story &quot;The Library of Babel&quot;), O. Henry (William Sidney Porter), William Gass (who wrote the Introduction to the NYRB Classics 2001 reprint), Nick Cave, Samuel Beckett, Ansgar Allen (whose &quot;Burton&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; was produced by deleting more than half a million words from Burton&#x27;s manuscript), and Jacques Barzun (who sees it anticipating 20th-century psychiatry). According to &quot;The Guardian&quot; literary critic Nick Lezard, the &quot;Anatomy&quot; &quot;survives among the cognoscenti&quot;. Washington Irving quotes from it on the title page of &quot;The Sketch Book&quot;.

Burton&#x27;s solemn tone and his endeavour to prove indisputable facts by weighty quotations were ridiculed by Laurence Sterne in &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;. Sterne also mocked Burton&#x27;s divisions in the titles of his chapters, and parodied his grave and sober account of Cicero&#x27;s grief for the death of his daughter Tullia.

<doc id="174527" wikidata="Q318591" url="?curid=174527" title="J. Paul Getty">
<text>Jean Paul Getty Sr. (; December 15, 1892 – June 6, 1976) was an American-born British petroleum industrialist who founded the Getty Oil Company in 1942 and was the patriarch of the Getty family. A native of Minneapolis, Minnesota, he was the son of pioneer oilman George Getty. In 1957, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine named J. Paul Getty the wealthiest living American, while the 1966 &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; declared him to be the world&#x27;s wealthiest private citizen, worth an estimated $1.2 billion (approximately $ billion in ). At the time of his death, he was worth more than $6 billion (approximately $ billion in ). A book published in 1996 ranked him as the 67th wealthiest American who ever lived (based on his wealth as a percentage of the concurrent gross national product).
Getty is considered to have been frugal, notably negotiating his grandson&#x27;s kidnapping ransom in 1973. He had five children and divorced five times. Getty was an avid collector of art and antiquities. His collection formed the basis of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles; more than $661 million of his estate was left to the museum after his death. He established the J. Paul Getty Trust in 1953. The trust, which is the world&#x27;s wealthiest art institution, operates the J. Paul Getty Museum Complexes: the Getty Center, the Getty Villa and the Getty Foundation, the Getty Research Institute, and the Getty Conservation Institute.

== Background ==
Getty was born in Minneapolis to Sarah Catherine McPherson (Risher) and George Franklin Getty, who was an attorney in the insurance industry. He grew up as a Methodist; his father was a devout Christian Scientist and both his father and mother were strict teetotalers. Jean was of part Scottish descent. In 1903, when Jean was 10 years old, his father traveled to Bartlesville, Oklahoma and bought the mineral rights for 1,100 acres of land. The Getty family then moved to Bartlesville, where J. Paul Getty attended the Garfield School. Within a few years Getty had established wells on the land which produced 100,000 barrels of crude oil a month.

As newly minted millionaires, the family moved to Los Angeles, but J. Paul Getty later returned to Oklahoma. At age 14, he attended the Harvard Military School for a year, followed by Polytechnic High School in Sun Valley, Los Angeles studying reading. He became fluent in French, German and Italian, and conversational in Spanish, Greek, Arabic, and Russian. A love of the classics led Getty to acquire reading proficiency in ancient Greek and Latin.

Getty enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley but did not complete a degree. Enamored of Europe after traveling abroad with his parents in 1910, he enrolled at the University of Oxford in Oxford, England on November 28, 1912. A letter of introduction by President of the United States William Howard Taft enabled him to gain independent instruction from tutors at Magdalen College. Although he was not registered at Magdalen, he claimed the aristocratic students &quot;accepted me as one of their own&quot; and he fondly boasted of the friends he made, including the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VIII of the United Kingdom. He obtained a diploma in economics and political science from Oxford in June 1913, then spent months traveling throughout Europe and Egypt before meeting his parents in Paris and returning with them to the U.S. in June 1914.

==Career==

In the autumn of 1914, George Getty gave his son $10,000 () to invest in expanding the family&#x27;s oil field holdings in Oklahoma. The first lot he bought, the Nancy Taylor No. 1 Oil Well Site near Haskell, Oklahoma, was crucial to his early financial success. The well struck oil in August 1915 and by the next summer the 40 percent net production royalty he accrued from it had made him a millionaire.

In 1919, Getty returned to business in Oklahoma. During the 1920s, he added about $3 million to his already sizable estate. His succession of marriages and divorces so distressed his father that Getty inherited only $500,000 of the $10 million fortune his father left at the time of his death in 1930. Getty was left with one-third of the stock from George Getty Inc., while his mother received the remaining two-thirds, giving her a controlling interest. In 1936, Getty&#x27;s mother convinced him to contribute to the establishment of a $3.3 million investment trust, called the Sarah C. Getty Trust, to ensure the family&#x27;s ever-growing wealth could be channeled into tax-free, secure income for future generations of the Getty family. The trust enabled Getty to have easy access to ready capital, which he was funneling into the purchase of Tidewater Petroleum stock.

During the Great Depression, Getty acquired Pacific Western Oil Corporation and began the acquisition (completed in 1953) of the Mission Corporation which included Tidewater Oil and Skelly Oil. In 1967, Getty merged these holdings into Getty Oil. In 1948–49, Getty paid Ibn Saud $9.5 million in cash, guaranteed $1 million a year, and a royalty of 55 cents a barrel for the Saudi Arabian Neutral Zone concession, which was 2.5 times more than what other major oil companies were paying in the Middle East at the time. Oil was finally discovered in March 1953. Since 1953, Getty&#x27;s gamble produced 16 million barrels a year, which contributed greatly to the fortune responsible for making him one of the richest people in the world.
Getty&#x27;s wealth and ability to speak Arabic enabled his unparalleled expansion into the Middle East. He owned the controlling interest in about 200 businesses, including Getty Oil. Getty owned Getty Oil, Getty Inc., George F. Getty Inc., Pacific Western Oil Corporation, Mission Corporation, Mission Development Company, Tidewater Oil, Skelly Oil, Mexican Seaboard Oil, Petroleum Corporation of America, Spartan Aircraft Company, Spartan Cafeteria Company, Minnehoma Insurance Company, Minnehoma Financial Company, Pierre Hotel, Pierre Marques Hotel, a 15th-century palace and nearby castle at Ladispoli on the coast northwest of Rome, a Malibu ranch home, and Sutton Place, a 72-room mansion near Guildford, Surrey.

===Art collection===
Getty&#x27;s first forays into collecting began in the late 1930s, when he was inspired by the collection of 18th-century French paintings and furniture of the landlord of his New York City penthouse, Amy Guest, a relation of Sir Winston Churchill. A fan of 18th-century France, Getty began buying furniture from the period at reduced prices because of the depressed art market. He wrote several books on collecting, including &quot;Europe and the 18th Century&quot; (1949), &quot;Collector&#x27;s Choice: The Chronicle of an Artistic Odyssey through Europe&quot; (1955) and &quot;The Joys of Collecting&quot; (1965). His stinginess limited the range of his collecting because he refused to pay full price. Getty&#x27;s companion in later life, Penelope Kitson, said, &quot;Paul was really too mean ever to allow himself to buy a great painting.&quot; Nonetheless, at the time of his death he owned more than 600 works valued at more than $4 million, including paintings by Rubens, Titian, Gainsborough, Renoir, Tintoretto, Degas, and Monet. Getty&#x27;s reluctance to donate any more artworks to Los Angeles County after he realized how his first donations had been shabbily presented at the Los Angeles Museum of History, Science and Art caused Edward W. Carter to orchestrate the fundraising effort for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. During the 1950s, Getty&#x27;s interests shifted to Greco-Roman sculpture, which led to the building of the Getty Villa in the 1970s to house the collection. These items were transferred to the Getty Museum and the Getty Villa in Los Angeles after his death.

==Marriages, divorces and children==
Getty was a notorious womanizer from the time of his youth, which horrified his conservative parents. His lawyer, Robina Lund, once said, &quot;Paul could hardly ever say &#x27;no&#x27; to a woman, or &#x27;yes&#x27; to a man.&quot; Lord Beaverbrook called him &quot;priapic&quot; and &quot;ever-ready&quot; in his sexual habits. In 1917, when he was 25, Elsie Eckstrom filed a paternity suit against Getty in Los Angeles, claiming he was the father of her daughter, Paula. Eckstrom said that Getty had taken her virginity while she was drunk and fathered the child. His legal team tried to undermine her credibility by claiming that she had a history of promiscuity. Getty agreed to a settlement of $10,000, upon which Eckstrom left town with the baby.

Getty was married and divorced five times. He had five sons with four of his wives:
# Jeanette Demont (married 1923 – divorced 1926); one son, George F. Getty II (1924–1973).
# Allene Ashby (1926–1928); no children. Getty met 17-year-old Ashby, the daughter of a Texas rancher, in Mexico City while he was studying Spanish and overseeing his family&#x27;s business interests. They eloped to Cuernavaca, Mexico, but the marriage was bigamous as he was not yet divorced from Jeanette. The two quickly decided to dissolve the union while still in Mexico.
# Adolphine Helmle (1928–1932); one son, Jean Ronald Getty (1929–2009), whose son, Christopher Ronald Getty, married Pia Miller, sister of Marie-Chantal, Crown Princess of Greece. Like his first and second wives, Adolphine was 17 when Getty met her in Vienna. She was the daughter of a prominent German doctor who opposed her marriage to the twice-divorced, 36-year-old Getty. The two eloped to Cuernavaca, where he had married Ashby, then settled in Los Angeles. After their son was born, Getty lost interest in her and her father convinced her to return to Germany with their son in 1929. After a protracted and contentious battle, their divorce was finalized in August 1932, with Adolphine receiving a huge sum for punitive damages and full custody of Ronald.
# Ann Rork (1932–1936); two sons, John Paul Getty Jr. (1932–2003) and Gordon Peter Getty (born 1933). Getty was introduced to Rork when she was 14, but she did not become his romantic partner until she was 21 in 1930. Because he was in the midst of his divorce from Adolphine, the couple had to wait two years to marry. He was largely absent during their marriage, staying for long stretches of time in Europe. She sued him for divorce in 1936, alleging emotional abuse and neglect. She described an incident while the two were abroad in Italy in which she claimed Getty forced her to climb to view the crater of Mount Vesuvius while she was pregnant with their first son. The court ruled in her favor and she was awarded $2,500 per month in alimony plus $1,000 each in child support for her sons.
# Louise Dudley &quot;Teddy&quot; Lynch (1939–1958); one son, Timothy Ware Getty (1946–1958).

In 2013, at age 99, Getty&#x27;s fifth wife, Louise, known as Teddy Getty Gaston, published a memoir recounting how Getty had scolded her for spending money too freely in the 1950s on the treatment of their six-year-old son, Timmy, who had become blind from a brain tumor. Timmy died at age 12, and Getty, living in England apart from his family, who were in the U.S., did not attend the funeral. Gaston divorced Getty that year. She died in 2017 at the age of 103.

Getty was quoted as saying &quot;A lasting relationship with a woman is only possible if you are a business failure&quot; and &quot;I hate to be a failure. I hate and regret the failure of my marriages. I would gladly give all my millions for just one lasting marital success.&quot;

==Kidnapping of grandson John Paul Getty III==
In Rome on July 10, 1973, &#x27;Ndrangheta kidnappers abducted Getty&#x27;s 16-year-old grandson, John Paul Getty III, and demanded $17 million (equivalent to $ in ) for his safe return. The family suspected a ploy by the rebellious teenager to extract money from his miserly grandfather. John Paul Getty Jr. asked his father for the money, but was refused, arguing that his 13 other grandchildren could also become kidnapping targets if he paid. In November 1973, an envelope containing a lock of hair and a human ear arrived at a daily newspaper. The second demand had been delayed three weeks by an Italian postal strike. The demand threatened that Paul would be further mutilated unless the victims paid $3.2 million. The demand stated: &quot;This is Paul&#x27;s ear. If we don&#x27;t get some money within 10 days, then the other ear will arrive. In other words, he will arrive in little bits.&quot;

When the kidnappers reduced their demand to $3 million, Getty agreed to pay no more than $2.2 million (equivalent to $ in ), the maximum that would be tax-deductible. He lent his son the remaining $800,000 at four percent interest. Getty&#x27;s grandson was found alive on December 15, 1973, in a Lauria filling station, in the province of Potenza, shortly after the ransom was paid. After his release, the younger Getty called his grandfather to thank him for paying the ransom but Getty refused to come to the phone. Nine people associated with &#x27;Ndrangheta were later arrested for the kidnapping, but only two were convicted. Getty III was permanently affected by the trauma and became a drug addict. After a stroke brought on by a cocktail of drugs and alcohol in 1981, he was rendered speechless, nearly blind, and partially paralyzed for the rest of his life. He died on February 5, 2011, at age 54.

Getty defended his initial refusal to pay the ransom on two grounds. He argued that his 13 other grandchildren could also become kidnapping targets if he paid and said: &quot;The second reason for my refusal was much broader-based. I contend that acceding to the demands of criminals and terrorists merely guarantees the continuing increase and spread of lawlessness, violence and such outrages as terror-bombings, &quot;skyjackings&quot; and the slaughter of hostages that plague our present-day world.&quot; Nine of the kidnappers were apprehended, including Girolamo Piromalli and Saverio Mammoliti, high-ranking members of the &#x27;Ndrangheta, a Mafia organization in Calabria. Two of the kidnappers were convicted and sent to prison; the others were acquitted for lack of evidence, including the &#x27;Ndrangheta bosses. Most of the ransom money was never recovered.

==Reputation for frugality==
Many anecdotal stories exist of Getty&#x27;s thriftiness and parsimony, which struck observers as comical, even perverse, because of his extreme wealth. The two best-known examples are his reluctance to pay his grandson&#x27;s kidnapping ransom and a pay phone he had installed at Sutton Place. A darker incident was his fifth wife&#x27;s claim that Getty had scolded her for spending too much on their terminally ill son&#x27;s medical treatment, though he was worth tens of millions of dollars at the time. He was well known for bargaining on almost everything to obtain the lowest possible price, including suites at luxury hotels and virtually all purchases of artwork and real estate. In 1959, Sutton Place, a 72-room mansion, was purchased from George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 5th Duke of Sutherland, for £60,000, about half of what the duke paid for it 40 years earlier.

*Getty&#x27;s secretary claimed that Getty did his laundry by hand because he did not want to pay for his clothes to be laundered. When his shirts became frayed at the cuffs, he would trim the frayed parts rather than buy new shirts.
*Reusing stationery was another obsession of Getty&#x27;s. He had a habit of writing responses to letters on the margins or back sides and mailing them back, rather than using a new sheet of paper. He also carefully saved and reused manila envelopes, rubber bands, and other office supplies.
*When Getty took a group of friends to a dog show in London, he made them walk around the block for 10 minutes until the tickets became half-priced at 5 pm, because he did not want to pay the full 5 shillings per head.
*Getty moved to Sutton Place in part because the cost of living was cheaper than in London, where he had resided at the Ritz. He once boasted to American columnist Art Buchwald that it cost 10 cents for a rum and coke at Sutton Place, whereas at the Ritz it was more than a dollar.
*Getty drove his own car to work every day.

Author John Pearson attributed part of Getty&#x27;s extreme penny-pinching to the Methodist sensibility of his upbringing, which emphasized modest living and personal economy. His business acumen was also a major factor in Getty&#x27;s thriftiness. &quot;He would allow himself no self-indulgence in the purchase of a place to live, a work of art, even a piece of furniture, unless he could convince himself that it would appreciate in value.&quot; Getty claimed his frugality toward others was a response to having been taken advantage of. &quot;It&#x27;s not the money I object to, it&#x27;s the principle of the thing that bothers me&quot;, he said.

===Coin-box telephone===
Getty famously had a pay phone installed at Sutton Place, helping to seal his reputation as a miser. He placed dial locks on all the regular telephones, limiting their use to authorized staff, and the coin-box telephone was installed for others. In his autobiography, he described his reasons:

In a 1963 televised interview with Alan Whicker, Getty said that he thought guests would want to use a pay phone. After 18 months, he said, &quot;the in-and-out traffic flow at Sutton subsided. Management and operation of the house settled into a reasonable routine. With that, the pay telephone [was] removed, and the dial locks were taken off the telephones in the house.&quot;

==Later years and death==
On June 30, 1960, Getty threw a 21st birthday party for a relative of his friend, the 16th Duke of Norfolk, which served as a housewarming party for the newly purchased Sutton Place. Partygoers were irritated by Getty&#x27;s stinginess, such as not providing cigarettes and relegating everyone to using creosote portable toilets outside. At about 10 p.m. the party descended into pandemonium as party crashers arrived from London, swelling the already overcrowded halls and causing an estimated £20,000 in damage. A valuable silver ewer by the 18th century silversmith Paul de Lamerie was stolen, but returned anonymously when the London newspapers began covering the theft. The event&#x27;s failure made Getty the object of ridicule and he never threw another large party. He remained an inveterate hard worker, boasting at age 74 that he often worked 16 to 18 hours per day overseeing his operations across the world. The value of Getty Oil shares quadrupled during the Arab-Israeli Yom Kippur War of 1973, which caused a worldwide oil shortage for years. Getty&#x27;s earnings topped $25.8 million in 1975.

Getty met the English interior designer Penelope Kitson in the 1950s and entrusted her with decorating his homes and the public rooms of the oil tankers he was launching. From 1960, Kitson resided in a cottage on the grounds of Sutton Place. Getty and Kitson maintained a platonic relationship and Getty held her in high respect and trust.

Getty&#x27;s insatiable appetite for sex also continued into his 80s. He used an experimental drug, &quot;H3&quot;, to maintain his potency. Mistresses who resided at Sutton Place included Mary Teissier, a distant cousin of the last Tsar of Russia; Lady Ursula d&#x27;Abo, who had close connections to the British Royal Family; and Nicaraguan-born Rosabella Burch. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of Getty&#x27;s domestic arrangement saying that he &quot;ended his life with a collection of desperately hopeful women, all living together in his Tudor mansion in England, none of them aware that his favorite pastime was rewriting his will, changing his insultingly small bequests: $209 a month to one, $1,167 to another.&quot; Only Kitson received a significant bequest upon Getty&#x27;s death: 5,000 shares of Getty Oil, which doubled in value during the 1980s, and a $1,167 monthly income.

On June 6, 1976, Getty died of heart failure at age 83 in Sutton Place.

==Media portrayals==
Rudy De Luca portrayed Getty in the 1991 Mel Brooks film &quot;Life Stinks&quot;, in which Brooks plays a real estate tycoon who takes a bet that he can&#x27;t live in the streets as a derelict for a month. Several times in the film he runs into a homeless man who claims to be Getty in a similar situation, but neither believes the other. It is never confirmed whether this character was supposed to actually be Getty or just a homeless person with a personality disorder, but he is credited as &quot;J. Paul Getty&quot;.

Christopher Plummer portrayed Getty in the 2017 film &quot;All the Money in the World,&quot; which dramatizes his grandson&#x27;s kidnapping. Getty was originally portrayed by Kevin Spacey, but after sexual misconduct allegations surfaced against Spacey before the film premiered, Plummer refilmed Spacey&#x27;s scenes. For his performance, Plummer received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The kidnapping is dramatized in the first season of the American anthology drama series &quot;Trust&quot;, in which Donald Sutherland portrays Getty.

==Quotations==
J. Paul Getty has one entry in the 8th Edition of The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations: &quot;If you can actually count your money, then you are not really a rich man.&quot;

<text>Saṃsāra (Devanagari: संसार) is a Sanskrit word that means &quot;wandering&quot; as well as &quot;world,&quot; wherein the term connotes &quot;cyclic change&quot; or, less formally, &quot;running around in circles.&quot; &quot;Saṃsāra&quot; is referred to with terms or phrases such as transmigration/reincarnation, karmic cycle, or Punarjanman, and &quot;cycle of aimless drifting, wandering or mundane existence&quot;. When related to the theory of karma, it is the cycle of death and rebirth.

The &quot;cyclicity of all life, matter, and existence&quot; is a fundamental belief of most Indian religions. The concept of &quot;saṃsāra&quot; has roots in the post-Vedic literature; the theory is not discussed in the Vedas themselves. It appears in developed form, but without mechanistic details, in the early Upanishads. The full exposition of the &quot;saṃsāra&quot; doctrine is found in early Buddhism and Jainism, as well as in various schools of Hindu philosophy. The &quot;saṃsāra&quot; doctrine is tied to the karma theory of Hinduism, and the liberation from &quot;saṃsāra&quot; has been at the core of the spiritual quest of Indian traditions, as well as their internal disagreements. The liberation from &quot;saṃsāra&quot; is called Moksha, Nirvāṇa, Mukti, or Kaivalya.

==the Etymology and terminology of Samsara==
&quot;Saṃsāra&quot; (Devanagari: संसार) means &quot;wandering&quot;, as well as &quot;world&quot; wherein the term connotes &quot;cyclic change&quot;. S&quot;aṃsāra&quot;, a fundamental concept in all Indian religions, is linked to the karma theory and refers to the belief that all living beings cyclically go through births and rebirths. The term is related to phrases such as &quot;the cycle of successive existence&quot;, &quot;transmigration&quot;, &quot;karmic cycle&quot;, &quot;the wheel of life&quot;, and &quot;cyclicality of all life, matter, existence&quot;. Many scholarly texts spell &quot;saṃsāra&quot; as &quot;samsara&quot;.

According to Monier-Williams, &quot;saṃsāra&quot; is derived from the verbal root &quot;sṛ&quot; with the prefix &quot;saṃ&quot;, &quot;Saṃsṛ&quot; (संसृ), meaning &quot;to go round, revolve, pass through a succession of states, to go towards or obtain, moving in a circuit&quot;. A nominal derivative formed from this root appears in ancient texts as &quot;saṃsaraṇa&quot;, which means &quot;going around through a succession of states, birth, rebirth of living beings and the world&quot;, without obstruction. Another nominal derivative from the same root is &quot;saṃsāra&quot;, referring to the same concept: a &quot;passage through successive states of mundane existence&quot;, transmigration, metempsychosis, a circuit of living where one repeats previous states, from one body to another, a worldly life of constant change, that is rebirth, growth, decay and redeath. &quot;Saṃsāra&quot; is understood as opposite of moksha, also known as &quot;mukti&quot;, &quot;nirvāṇa&quot;, &quot;nibbāna&quot; or &quot;kaivalya&quot;, which refers to liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

The concept of &quot;saṃsāra&quot; developed in the post-Vedic times, and is traceable in the Samhita layers such as in sections 1.164, 4.55, 6.70 and 10.14 of the Rigveda. While the idea is mentioned in the Samhita layers of the Vedas, there is lack of clear exposition there, and the idea fully develops in the early Upanishads. Damien Keown states that the notion of &quot;cyclic birth and death&quot; appears around 800 BC. The word &quot;saṃsāra&quot; appears, along with Moksha, in several Principal Upanishads such as in verse 1.3.7 of the Katha Upanishad, verse 6.16 of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, verses 1.4 and 6.34 of the Maitri Upanishad.

The word &quot;saṃsāra&quot; is related to &quot;Saṃsṛti&quot;, the latter referring to the &quot;course of mundane existence, transmigration, flow, circuit or stream&quot;.

==Definition and rationale==
The word literally means &quot;wandering through, flowing on&quot;, states Stephen J. Laumakis, in the sense of &quot;aimless and directionless wandering&quot;. The concept of &quot;saṃsāra&quot; is closely associated with the belief that the person continues to be born and reborn in various realms and forms.

The earliest layers of Vedic text incorporate the concept of life, followed by an afterlife in heaven and hell based on cumulative virtues (merit) or vices (demerit). However, the ancient Vedic Rishis challenged this idea of afterlife as simplistic, because people do not live an equally moral or immoral life. Between generally virtuous lives, some are more virtuous; while evil too has degrees, and the texts assert that it would be unfair for god Yama to judge and reward people with varying degrees of virtue or vices, in an &quot;either or,” and disproportionate manner. They introduced the idea of an afterlife in heaven or hell in proportion to one&#x27;s merit, and when this runs out, one returns and is reborn. This idea appears in ancient and medieval texts, as the cycle of life, death, rebirth and redeath, such as section 6:31 of the Mahabharata and section 6.10 of the Devi Bhagavata Purana.

==History==
The historical origins of the concept of reincarnation, or Punarjanman, are obscure, but the idea appears in texts of both India and ancient Greece during the first millennium BCE. The idea of &quot;saṃsāra&quot; is hinted in the late Vedic texts such as the Rigveda, but the theory is absent. According to Sayers, the earliest layers of the Vedic literature show ancestor worship and rites such as sraddha (offering food to the ancestors). The later Vedic texts such as the Aranyakas and the Upanishads show a different soteriology based on reincarnation, they show little concern with ancestor rites, and they begin to philosophically interpret the earlier rituals, although the idea is not fully developed yet. It is in the early Upanishads where these ideas are more fully developed, but there too the discussion does not provide specific mechanistic details. The detailed doctrines flower with unique characteristics, starting around the mid 1st millennium BCE, in diverse traditions such as in Buddhism, Jainism and various schools of Hindu philosophy. The evidence for who influenced whom in the ancient times, is slim and speculative, and the odds are the historic development of the &quot;Saṃsāra&quot; theories likely happened in parallel with mutual influences.

=== Punarmrityu: redeath ===
While &quot;saṃsāra&quot; is usually described as rebirth and reincarnation (Punarjanman) of living beings (Jiva), the chronological development of the idea over its history began with the questions on what is the true nature of human existence and whether people die only once. This led first to the concepts of &quot;Punarmṛtyu&quot; (&quot;redeath&quot;) and &quot;Punaravṛtti&quot; (&quot;return&quot;). These early theories asserted that the nature of human existence involves two realities, one unchanging absolute Atman (Self) which is somehow connected to the ultimate unchanging immortal reality and bliss called Brahman, and that the rest is the always-changing subject (body) in a phenomenal world (&quot;Maya&quot;). Redeath, in the Vedic theosophical speculations, reflected the end of &quot;blissful years spent in &quot;svarga&quot; or heaven&quot;, and it was followed by rebirth back in the phenomenal world. &quot;Saṃsāra&quot; developed into a foundational theory of the nature of existence, shared by all Indian religions.

Rebirth as a human being, states John Bowker, was then presented as a &quot;rare opportunity to break the sequence of rebirth, thus attaining Moksha, release&quot;. Each Indian spiritual tradition developed its own assumptions and paths (&quot;marga&quot; or &quot;yoga&quot;) for this spiritual release, with some developing the ideas of &quot;Jivanmukti&quot; (liberation and freedom in this life), while the others content with &quot;Videhamukti&quot; (liberation and freedom in after-life).

The Sramanas traditions (Buddhism and Jainism) added novel ideas, starting about the 6th century BC. They emphasized human suffering in the larger context, placing rebirth, redeath and truth of pain at the center and the start of religious life. Sramanas view s&quot;aṃsāra&quot; as a beginningless cyclical process with each birth and death as punctuations in that process, and spiritual liberation as freedom from rebirth and redeath. The saṃsāric rebirth and redeath ideas are discussed in these religions with various terms, such as &quot;Āgatigati&quot; in many early Pali Suttas of Buddhism.

=== Evolution of ideas ===
Across different religions, different soteriology were emphasized as the &quot;saṃsāra&quot; theories evolved in respective Indian traditions. For example, in their &quot;saṃsāra&quot; theories, states Obeyesekere, the Hindu traditions accepted Ātman or &quot;Self&quot; exists and asserted it to be the unchanging essence of each living being, while Buddhist traditions denied such a soul exists and developed the concept of &quot;Anattā&quot;. Salvation (moksha, mukti) in the Hindu traditions was described using the concepts of Ātman (self) and Brahman (universal reality), while in Buddhism it (nirvāṇa, nibbāna) was described through the concept of Anattā (no self) and Śūnyatā (emptiness).

The Ajivika tradition combined &quot;saṃsāra&quot; with the premise that there is no free will, while the Jainism tradition accepted the concept of soul (calling it &quot;jiva&quot;) with free will, but emphasized asceticism and cessation of action as a means of liberation from &quot;saṃsāra&quot; it calls bondage. The various sub-traditions of Hinduism, and of Buddhism, accepted free will, avoided asceticism, accepted renunciation and monastic life, and developed their own ideas on liberation through realization of the true nature of existence.

==In Hinduism==
In Hinduism, &quot;saṃsāra&quot; is a journey of the &quot;Ātman&quot;. The body dies but not the &quot;Ātman&quot;, which is eternal reality, indestructible, and bliss. Everything and all existence is connected, cyclical, and composed of two things: the Self, or &quot;Ātman&quot;, and the body, or matter. This eternal Self called &quot;Ātman&quot; never reincarnates, it does not change and cannot change in the Hindu belief. In contrast, the body and personality, can change, constantly changes, is born and dies. Current &quot;karma&quot; impacts the future circumstances in this life, as well as the future forms and realms of lives. Good intent and actions lead to good future, bad intent and actions lead to bad future, in the Hindu view of life. The journey of samsara allows the atman the opportunity to perform positive or negative karmas throughout each birth and make spiritual efforts to attain moksha.

A virtuous life, actions consistent with dharma, are believed by Hindus to contribute to a better future, whether in this life or future lives. The aim of spiritual pursuits, whether it be through the path of bhakti (devotion), karma (work), jñāna (knowledge), or raja (meditation) is self-liberation (moksha) from &quot;saṃsāra&quot;.

The Upanishads, part of the scriptures of the Hindu traditions, primarily focus on self-liberation from &quot;saṃsāra&quot;. The Bhagavad Gita discusses various paths to liberation. The Upanishads, states Harold Coward, offer a &quot;very optimistic view regarding the perfectibility of human nature&quot;, and the goal of human effort in these texts is a continuous journey to self-perfection and self-knowledge so as to end &quot;saṃsāra&quot;. The aim of spiritual quest in the Upanishadic traditions is to find the true self within and to know one&#x27;s Self, a state that it believes leads to blissful state of freedom, &quot;moksha&quot;.

===Differences within the Hindu traditions===
All Hindu traditions share the concept of &quot;saṃsāra&quot;, but they differ in details and what they describe the state of liberation from &quot;saṃsāra&quot; to be. The saṃsāra is viewed as the cycle of rebirth in a temporal world of always changing reality or &quot;Maya&quot; (appearance, illusive), Brahman is defined as that which never changes or Sat (eternal truth, reality), and moksha as the realization of Brahman and freedom from &quot;saṃsāra&quot;.

The dualistic devotional traditions such as Madhvacharya&#x27;s Dvaita Vedanta tradition of Hinduism champion a theistic premise, assert the individual human Self and Brahman (Vishnu, Krishna) are two different realities, loving devotion to Vishnu is the means to release from &quot;saṃsāra&quot;, it is the grace of Vishnu which leads to moksha, and spiritual liberation is achievable only in after-life (&quot;videhamukti&quot;). The nondualistic traditions such as Adi Shankara&#x27;s Advaita Vedanta tradition of Hinduism champion a monistic premise, asserting that the individual Atman and Brahman are identical, and only ignorance, impulsiveness and inertia leads to suffering through &quot;saṃsāra&quot;. In reality they are no dualities, meditation and self-knowledge is the path to liberation, the realization that one&#x27;s Ātman is identical to Brahman is &quot;moksha&quot;, and spiritual liberation is achievable in this life (&quot;jivanmukti&quot;).

==In Jainism==
In Jainism, the &quot;saṃsāra&quot; and karma doctrine are central to its theological foundations, as evidenced by the extensive literature on it in the major sects of Jainism, and their pioneering ideas on karma and &quot;saṃsāra&quot; from the earliest times of the Jaina tradition. &quot;Saṃsāra&quot; in Jainism represents the worldly life characterized by continuous rebirths and suffering in various realms of existence.

The conceptual framework of the saṃsāra doctrine differs between the Jainism traditions and other Indian religions. For instance, in Jaina traditions, soul (&quot;jiva&quot;) is accepted as a truth, as is assumed in the Hindu traditions, but not assumed in the Buddhist traditions. However, saṃsāra or the cycle of rebirths, has a definite beginning and end in Jainism.

Souls begin their journey in a primordial state, and exist in a state of consciousness continuum that is constantly evolving through &quot;saṃsāra&quot;. Some evolve to a higher state, while some regress, a movement that is driven by karma. Further, Jaina traditions believe that there exist &quot;Ābhāvya&quot; (incapable), or a class of souls that can never attain moksha (liberation). The &quot;Ābhāvya&quot; state of soul is entered after an intentional and shockingly evil act. Jainism considers souls as pluralistic each in a karma-&quot;saṃsāra&quot; cycle, and does not subscribe to Advaita style nondualism of Hinduism, or Advaya style nondualism of Buddhism.

The Jaina theosophy, like ancient Ajivika, but unlike Hindu and Buddhist theosophies, asserts that each soul passes through 8,400,000 birth-situations, as they circle through &quot;saṃsāra&quot;. As the soul cycles, states Padmanabh Jaini, Jainism traditions believe that it goes through five types of bodies: earth bodies, water bodies, fire bodies, air bodies and vegetable lives. With all human and non-human activities, such as rainfall, agriculture, eating and even breathing, minuscule living beings are taking birth or dying, their souls are believed to be constantly changing bodies. Perturbing, harming or killing any life form, including any human being, is considered a sin in Jainism, with negative karmic effects.

A liberated soul in Jainism is one who has gone beyond &quot;saṃsāra&quot;, is at the apex, is omniscient, remains there eternally, and is known as a &quot;Siddha&quot;. A male human being is considered closest to the apex with the potential to achieve liberation, particularly through asceticism. Women must gain karmic merit, to be reborn as man, and only then can they achieve spiritual liberation in Jainism, particularly in the Digambara sect of Jainism; however, this view has been historically debated within Jainism and different Jaina sects have expressed different views, particularly the Shvetambara sect that believes that women too can achieve liberation from &quot;saṃsāra&quot;.

In contrast to Buddhist texts which do not expressly or unambiguously condemn injuring or killing plants and minor life forms, Jaina texts do. Jainism considers it a bad karma to injure plants and minor life forms with negative impact on a soul&#x27;s . However, some texts in Buddhism and Hinduism do caution a person from injuring all life forms, including plants and seeds.

==In Buddhism==
&quot;Saṃsāra&quot; in Buddhism, states Jeff Wilson, is the &quot;suffering-laden cycle of life, death, and rebirth, without beginning or end&quot;. Also referred to as the wheel of existence (&quot;Bhavacakra&quot;), it is often mentioned in Buddhist texts with the term &quot;punarbhava&quot; (rebirth, re-becoming); the liberation from this cycle of existence, &quot;Nirvāṇa&quot;, is the foundation and the most important purpose of Buddhism.

&quot;Saṃsāra&quot; is considered permanent in Buddhism, just like other Indian religions. Karma drives this permanent &quot;saṃsāra&quot; in Buddhist thought, states Paul Williams, and &quot;short of attaining enlightenment, in each rebirth one is born and dies, to be reborn elsewhere in accordance with the completely impersonal causal nature of one&#x27;s own karma; This endless cycle of birth, rebirth, and redeath is &quot;saṃsāra&quot;&quot;. The Four Noble Truths, accepted by all Buddhist traditions, are aimed at ending this saṃsāra-related re-becoming (rebirth) and associated cycles of suffering.

Like Jainism, Buddhism developed its own &quot;saṃsāra&quot; theory, that evolved over time the mechanistic details on how the wheel of mundane existence works over the endless cycles of rebirth and redeath. In early Buddhist traditions, &quot;saṃsāra&quot; cosmology consisted of five realms through which wheel of existence recycled. This included hells (&quot;niraya&quot;), hungry ghosts (&quot;pretas&quot;), animals (&quot;tiryak&quot;), humans (&quot;manushya&quot;), and gods (&quot;devas&quot;, heavenly). In latter traditions, this list grew to a list of six realms of rebirth, adding demi-gods (&quot;asuras&quot;), which were included in gods realm in earlier traditions. The &quot;hungry ghost, heavenly, hellish realms&quot; respectively formulate the ritual, literary and moral spheres of many contemporary Buddhist traditions.

The &quot;saṃsāra&quot; concept, in Buddhism, envisions that these six realms are interconnected, and everyone cycles life after life, and death is just a state for an afterlife, through these realms, because of a combination of ignorance, desires and purposeful karma, or ethical and unethical actions. &quot;Nirvāṇa&quot; is typically described as the freedom from rebirth and the only alternative to suffering of &quot;saṃsāra&quot;, in Buddhism. However, the Buddhist texts developed a more comprehensive theory of rebirth, states Steven Collins, from fears of redeath, called &quot;amata&quot; (death-free), a state which is considered synonymous with &quot;Nirvāṇa&quot;.

==In Sikhism==
Sikhism incorporates the concepts of &quot;saṃsāra&quot; (sometimes spelled as &quot;Saṅsāra&quot; in Sikh texts), karma and cyclical nature of time and existence. Founded in the 15th century, its founder Guru Nanak incorporated the cyclical concept of ancient Indian religions and the cyclical concept of time, state Cole and Sambhi. However, states Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair, there are important differences between the &quot;Saṅsāra&quot; concept in Sikhism from the &quot;saṃsāra&quot; concept in many traditions within Hinduism. The difference is that Sikhism firmly believes in the grace of God as the means to salvation, and its precepts encourage the bhakti of One Lord for &quot;mukti&quot; (salvation).

Sikhism, like the three ancient Indian traditions, believes that body is perishable, that there is a cycle of rebirth, and that there is suffering with each cycle of rebirth. These features of Sikhism, along with its belief in &quot;Saṅsāra&quot; and the grace of God, are similar to some bhakti-oriented sub-traditions within Hinduism such as those found in Vaishnavism. Sikhism does not believe that ascetic life, as recommended in Jainism, is the path to liberation. Rather, it cherishes social engagement and householder&#x27;s life combined with devotion to the One God as Guru, to be the path of liberation from &quot;saṅsāra&quot;.

<text>Haroldson Lafayette Hunt Jr. (February 17, 1889 – November 29, 1974) was an American oil tycoon. By trading poker winnings for oil rights according to legend, but more likely through money he gained from successful speculation in oil leases, he ultimately secured title to much of the East Texas Oil Field, one of the world&#x27;s largest oil deposits. He acquired rights to East Texas oil lands initially through a $30,000 land purchase from oil speculator Dad Joiner, and founded Hunt Oil in 1936. From that acquisition and others including diverse interests in publishing, cosmetics, pecan farming, and health food producers, he accrued a fortune which was among the world&#x27;s largest. In the 1950s, his Facts Forum Foundation supported highly conservative newspaper columns and radio programs, some of which he authored and produced himself, and for which he became known. At the time of his death he was reputed to have one of the highest net worths of any individual in the world, a fortune estimated between $2–3 billion.

==Life==
Hunt was born near Ramsey in Carson Township, Illinois, the youngest of eight children. He was named after his father, Haroldson Lafayette Hunt, who was a prosperous farmer-entrepreneur. His mother was Ella Rose (Myers) Hunt.

H.L. Hunt Jr. was homeschooled. He did not go to elementary school or to high school. Later, he said that education is an obstacle to making money. As a teenager, Hunt traveled to different places before he settled in Arkansas, where he was running a cotton plantation by 1912. He had a reputation as a math prodigy and was a gambler. Hunt is reported in internal FBI memoranda to have run prostitution activities in Arkansas and, later in the 1950s, a private horse racing and gambling bookmaking operation from his office in Dallas.

It was said that after his cotton plantation was flooded, he turned his last $100 into more than $100,000 after he had gambled in New Orleans. With his winnings, he purchased oil properties in El Dorado southeast of Texarkana, Arkansas. He was generous to his employees, who in turn were loyal to him by informing him of rumors of a massive oil field to the south, in East Texas. In negotiations over cheese and crackers, at the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas, with the wild-catter who discovered the East Texas Oil Field, Columbus Marion &quot;Dad&quot; Joiner, Hunt secured title to what was the largest known oil deposit in the world. Hunt had agreed to pay Joiner $1,000,000 and to protect him from liability for his many fraudulent transactions surrounding the property. 

In 1957, &quot;Fortune&quot; estimated that Hunt had a fortune of $400–700 million, and was one of the eight richest people in the United States. J. Paul Getty, who was considered to be the richest private citizen in the world, said of Hunt, &quot;In terms of extraordinary, independent wealth, there is only one man—H. L. Hunt.&quot;

==Personal life==

H.L. Hunt had fifteen children by three wives.

He and Lyda Bunker of Lake Village, southeast of Pine Bluff, Arkansas were married in November 1914 and remained married until her death in 1955. His seven children by her were: Margaret (1915–2007), Haroldson (&quot;Hassie&quot;, 1917–2005), Caroline (1923–2018), Lyda (born and died in 1925), Nelson Bunker (1926–2014), William Herbert (1929–2024), and Lamar (1932–2006). Their home on White Rock Lake in Dallas was styled after Mount Vernon though much larger.

His first son, Hassie, who was expected to succeed him in control of the family business, was lobotomized in response to increasingly erratic behavior. He outlived his father. Lamar founded the American Football League and created the Super Bowl, drawing on the assistance of his children in selecting the game&#x27;s name. Two other children, Herbert and Bunker, are famous for their purchasing much of the world&#x27;s silver, in an attempt to corner the market. They ultimately owned more silver than any government in the world before their scheme was discovered and undone. Bunker Hunt was briefly one of the wealthiest men in the world, having discovered and taken title to the Libyan oil fields, before Muammar Gaddafi nationalized the properties.

While still married to Lyda, H. L. Hunt is said to have married Frania Tye of Tampa, Florida, 
in November 1925 by using the name Franklin Hunt. Frania claimed to have discovered the bigamous nature of her marriage in 1934, and in a legal settlement in 1941, Hunt created trust funds for each of their four children, and she signed a document stipulating that no legal marriage between them had ever existed. About the same time, she briefly married then divorced Hunt&#x27;s employee, John Lee, taking the last name Lee for herself and her four children. Her four children by Hunt were: Howard (born 1926), Haroldina (1928), Helen (1930), and Hugh (&quot;Hue&quot;, 1934). Frania Tye Lee died in 2002.

Hunt supported and had children by Ruth Ray of Shreveport to the northwest of Alexandria, Louisiana, whom he had met when she was a secretary in his Shreveport office. They married in 1957 after the death of Hunt&#x27;s wife Lyda. His four children by her were Ray Lee (born 1943), June (1944), Helen (1949), and Swanee (1950). His youngest son, Ray Lee, inherited the business and was a major supporter of President George W. Bush.

A scandal emerged in 1975, after his death, when it was discovered that he had a hidden bigamous relationship with his second wife living in New York.
After his marriage to Ruth Ray, Hunt became a Baptist and was a member of the First Baptist Church of Dallas. He was a major financial contributor toward the establishment of the conservative Christian evangelical Criswell College in Dallas.

After several months at Baylor Hospital in Dallas, Hunt died at age 85, and was buried in Sparkman-Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetery in Dallas. Haela Hunt-Hendrix, who began Liturgy, a transcendental black metal band Liturgy is his grandchild. H.L. Hunt served as inspiration behind the character J. R. Ewing from the television show &quot;Dallas&quot;.

==Connection to white supremacy==
Multiple sources, including American civil rights icon Malcolm X, implicate Hunt as a lifelong racist who provided major financial assistance to several far-right organizations, such as the Minutemen and the John Birch Society. Hunt considered African Americans a political threat and made this clear in his radio interviews and broadcasts. One of Hunt&#x27;s chief allies, Allen Zoll, said that since 1936 Hunt advocated deporting all African Americans to Africa. For this reason, Hunt supplied Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad continuous financial support due to the latter&#x27;s belief in racial separation from whites.

In 1965, Hunt encouraged Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace, a white supremacist, to use the scheme of running his wife, Lurleen Wallace, for election as governor in a bold effort to evade the state&#x27;s constitutional rule that a governor could not succeed himself.

==JFK conspiracy allegations==
Madeleine Duncan Brown, an advertising executive who claimed to have had both an extended love affair and a son with President Lyndon B. Johnson, said that she was present at a party at the Dallas home of Clint Murchison Sr. (another oil tycoon), on the evening prior to the assassination of John F. Kennedy which was attended by Johnson as well as other famous, wealthy, and powerful individuals including Hunt, Murchison, J. Edgar Hoover, and Richard Nixon.

According to Brown, Johnson had a meeting with several of the men after which he told her: &quot;After tomorrow, those goddamn Kennedys will never embarrass me again. That&#x27;s no threat. That&#x27;s a promise.&quot; Brown&#x27;s story received national attention and became part of at least a dozen John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories. Kennedy assassination investigator Dave Perry refuted this theory with evidence showing neither President Johnson nor Hoover were in Dallas at the time of the alleged party and Murchison had not lived in his Dallas home for a number of years. Witnesses place Murchison at his East Texas ranch.

<text>The Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra (, ) is a Dutch symphony orchestra, established in 1888 at the Amsterdam Royal Concertgebouw (concert hall). It is considered one of the world&#x27;s leading orchestras. It was known as the Concertgebouw Orchestra until Queen Beatrix conferred the &quot;Royal&quot; prefix upon it in celebration of its centenary in 1988; the prefix was also granted to the concert hall in 2013.

==History==
The Concertgebouw opened on 11 April 1888. The Concertgebouw Orchestra was established several months later and gave its first concert in the Concertgebouw on 3 November 1888. This performance was conducted by the orchestra&#x27;s first chief conductor, Willem Kes.

===1888–1945: Kes and Mengelberg===
Willem Kes served as the orchestra&#x27;s chief conductor from its 1888 founding to 1895. In 1895, Willem Mengelberg became chief conductor and remained in this position for fifty years, an unusually long tenure for a music director. He is generally regarded as having brought the orchestra to a level of major international significance, with a particular championing of such then-contemporary composers as Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss.

For approximately its first 75 years, the Concertgebouw Orchestra had a somewhat complicated roster of conductors. In addition to the chief conductor, the orchestra had conductor positions titled &quot;eerste dirigent&quot; (&quot;first conductor&quot;), who assisted the chief conductor with programming, and &quot;tweede dirigent&quot; (&quot;second conductor&quot;), who did &quot;what he was told.&quot; During Mengelberg&#x27;s time as chief conductor, several of these first conductors included Karl Muck (1921–1925), Pierre Monteux (1924–1934), Bruno Walter (1934–1939), and Eugen Jochum (1941–1943), each of them internationally respected and holding positions at other orchestras as well. Musicians who served as &quot;second conductor&quot; were all Dutch and included the composer Cornelis Dopper, Evert Cornelis and Eduard van Beinum.

In 1945, because of the controversy over his relationship with the Nazi occupying forces during the German occupation of the Netherlands during World War II, Mengelberg was removed as chief conductor and subsequently banned from conducting in The Netherlands. The ban was initially imposed for the remainder of his life, but after an appeal, reduced to six years, applied retroactively from 1945. Mengelberg died in 1951 just before the end of his sentence, and thus never conducted the orchestra again after 1945.

===1945–1988: Van Beinum and Haitink===
From 1945 to 1959, the orchestra&#x27;s principal conductor was Eduard van Beinum, who had debuted with the orchestra in 1929. He had become the second conductor of the orchestra in 1931, and co-principal conductor in 1938. One of his specialties was the symphonies of Anton Bruckner, and Van Beinum made commercial recordings with the orchestra of Bruckner&#x27;s Eighth and Ninth Symphonies for the Philips Records label. Van Beinum served as sole chief conductor of the orchestra after World War II until his sudden death on the Concertgebouw podium from a heart attack in April 1959.

Bernard Haitink made his debut with the Concertgebouw Orchestra on 7 November 1956. After Van Beinum&#x27;s death, from 1961 to 1963, Haitink and Eugen Jochum shared the post of chief conductor of the orchestra. Haitink became sole chief conductor in 1963, and served in this post until 1988. At some point during Haitink&#x27;s time, the conductor system was simplified to have an assistant conductor instead of first and second conductors. Conductors who served in this capacity included Edo de Waart and Hans Vonk. The recording profile of the orchestra increased most dramatically under Haitink, with many recordings for Philips Records, as well as EMI and Columbia Records. In the early 1980s, the Dutch government threatened the orchestra with reductions in its government subsidy that could potentially have led to the dismissal of 23 musicians from the orchestra. Haitink threatened to resign in protest, and the financial situation was eventually settled. In 1999, Haitink was named the orchestra&#x27;s conductor laureate (&quot;eredirigent&quot;), following a rapprochement negotiated by the then-new managing director of the orchestra, Jan Willem Loot. In March 2014, Haitink suggested to the Dutch newspaper &quot;Het Parool&quot; that he wished to renounce the title of RCO conductor laureate and no longer to guest-conduct the orchestra, in protest at the orchestra&#x27;s current administrative management. In September 2015, the orchestra announced a rapprochement with Haitink, with a scheduled guest-conducting engagement with the RCO in the 2016–2017 season. Haitink retained the title of &quot;eredirigent&quot; with the orchestra through his 2019 retirement and until his death in October 2021.

===1988–2018: Chailly, Jansons and Gatti===
Riccardo Chailly made his debut with the Concertgebouw Orchestra in 1985, and was elected that year as their next chief conductor to succeed Haitink. As the first non-Dutchman to hold the post, Chailly served as chief conductor from 1988 to 2004. His recordings with the orchestra include complete Mahler and Brahms symphony cycles and several Bruckner symphonies. He is a strong advocate of modern music and recorded shorter works of Shostakovich, the complete &quot;Kammermusiken&quot; of Paul Hindemith, and the orchestral works of Igor Stravinsky, Olivier Messiaen and Edgard Varèse. After his departure in 2004, Chailly was named Conductor Emeritus of the RCO.

Mariss Jansons made his RCO debut in 1988. On 22 October 2002, the RCO elected Jansons as its next chief conductor. His tenure officially began on 1 September 2004, with an initial contract of three years. Premières during Janson&#x27;s tenure have included Hans Werner Henze&#x27;s &quot;Sebastian im Traum&quot;, a RCO co-commission. In April 2014, the orchestra announced the scheduled conclusion of Jansons&#x27; tenure as chief conductor after the 2014–15 season. Jansons subsequently held the title of conductor emeritus of the RCO until his death in 2019.

Daniele Gatti first guest-conducted the RCO in 2004. In October 2014, the RCO announced the appointment of Gatti as its seventh chief conductor, effective in 2016. On 2 August 2018, the orchestra dismissed Gatti as chief conductor with immediate effect, following complaints of &quot;inappropriate&quot; behaviour with female musicians.

===2020–present===
In October 2020, the RCO announced the appointment of Iván Fischer as its honorary guest conductor (&quot;honorair gastdirigent&quot;), effective with the 2021–2022 season.

In September 2020, Klaus Mäkelä first guest-conducted the RCO. The RCO re-engaged Mäkelä twice in the 2020–2021 season, and subsequently in the 2021–2022 season for further guest-conducting appearances, including tours to Hamburg and Reykjavík. In June 2022, the RCO announced the appointment of Mäkelä as an artistic partner for the period of 2022–2027, and subsequently as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2027–2028 season, with an initial contract of 5 years.

In March 2024, the RCO announced the establishment of the &quot;Bernard Haitink Associate Conductorship&quot;, through a donation from Patricia Haitink and the Haitink family, and the appointment of Aurel Dawidiuk as the orchestra&#x27;s inaugural associate conductor under this programme.

==Character==
The orchestra enjoyed a close relationship with Gustav Mahler and championed many of his symphonies, with an especially worthy festival of his music being the 1920 Mahler Festival. Other conductors who worked closely with the Concertgebouw Orchestra included Pierre Monteux, Eugen Jochum, George Szell and Kirill Kondrashin, who was principal guest conductor from 1978, following his defection from the USSR, until his death in 1981. More recently, Nikolaus Harnoncourt served as Honorary Guest Conductor of the RCO, beginning in 2000, and leading his final performance with the RCO in October 2013.

Another factor in creating the orchestra&#x27;s distinct character is that the Concertgebouw Orchestra has had only eight chief conductors, setting it apart from orchestras of similar age and caliber. The nearly one thousand recordings that the orchestra has to its credit have also contributed to this reputation. The orchestra also serves as one of the opera orchestras for productions of the Dutch National Opera.

Jan Raes served as executive director of the orchestra from December 2008 to December 2019. Prior executive directors included Jan Willem Loot. In January 2020, the orchestra announced David Bazen as its interim managing director, with immediate effect. In August 2020, the orchestra announced the appointment of a new three-person managing board, naming Dominik Winterling as Chairman.

Past artistic directors of the Concertgebouw Orchestra have included Rudolf Mengelberg (1925–1955), Marius Flothuis (1955–1974), Hein van Royen (1974–1991) and Peter Ruzicka, and more recently as head of artistic administration, Joel Ethan Fried. In August 2020, the orchestra announced the appointment of Ulrike Niehoff as its new artistic director, effective 1 January 2021. Niehoff stood down from the post at the close of the 2022–2023 season.

The RCO has issued CDs on its own label, RCO Live, as conducted by Jansons and Haitink among others.

<text>A seraph (; : seraphim ; Hebrew: שְׂרָפִים &quot;sərāp̄īm, pl. שָׂרָף sārāp̄&quot;) is a celestial or heavenly being originating in Ancient Judaism. The term plays a role in subsequent Judaism, and Islam.

Tradition places seraphim in the highest rank in Christian angelology and in the fifth rank of ten in the Jewish angelic hierarchy. A seminal passage in the Book of Isaiah () used the term to describe six-winged beings that fly around the Throne of God crying &quot;holy, holy, holy&quot;. This throne scene, with its triple invocation of holiness, profoundly influenced subsequent theology, literature and art. Its influence is frequently seen in works depicting angels, heaven and apotheosis. Seraphim are mentioned as celestial beings in the semi-canonical Book of Enoch and the canonical Book of Revelation.

==Origins and development==
In Hebrew, the word &quot;saraph&quot; means &quot;burning&quot;, and is used seven times throughout the text of the Hebrew Bible as a noun, usually to denote &quot;serpent&quot;, twice in the Book of Numbers, once in the Book of Deuteronomy, and four times in the Book of Isaiah. The reason why the word for &quot;burning&quot; was also used to denote a serpent is not universally agreed upon; it may be due to a certain snake species&#x27; fiery colors, or perhaps the burning sensation left by its venomous bite. Regardless, its plural form, &quot;seraphim&quot;, occurs in both Numbers and Isaiah, but only in Isaiah is it used to denote an angelic being; likewise, these angels are referred to &quot;only&quot; as the plural &quot;seraphim&quot; – Isaiah later uses the singular &quot;saraph&quot; to describe a &quot;fiery flying &quot;serpent&quot;&quot;, in line with the other uses of the term throughout the Tanakh.

There is emerging consensus that the motifs used to display seraphs in Hyksos-era Canaan had their original sources in Egyptian uraeus iconography. In Egyptian iconography, the uraeus was used as a symbol of sovereignty, royalty, divinity and divine authority, and later iconography often showed uraei with wings. In the early monarchic period of Israel and Judah, Egyptian motifs were evidently borrowed by the Israelites &quot;en masse&quot;, as a plethora of personal seals belonging to classes ranging from commonfolk to royalty have been discovered, which incorporate several pieces of ancient Egyptian iconography, including the winged sun, ankh, the &quot;hedjet&quot; and &quot;deshret&quot; crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt, scarabs, and the uraeus cobra. These uraei often had four wings, as opposed to the Egyptian standard which only gave them two. These images have been connected with the &quot;seraphim&quot; angels associated with Isaiah&#x27;s visions, or perhaps more directly to the aforementioned &quot;fiery flying serpent&quot;, but this continues to be debated – and an image of serpentine &quot;seraphim&quot; clashes with Isaiah&#x27;s own vision, which clearly envisioned &quot;seraphim&quot; with heads, legs, and arms – although, on the second matter, some scholars have proposed that the covered &quot;feet&quot; of the seraphim should be identified as genitals, as &quot;feet&quot; are often used in the Hebrew Bible as a euphemism for the penis.

The vision in Isaiah Chapter 6 of seraphim in an idealized version of Solomon&#x27;s Temple represents the sole instance in the Hebrew Bible of this word being used to describe celestial beings. &quot;... I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. Above it stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.&quot; (Isaiah 6:1–3) And one cried to another, &quot;Holy, holy, holy, is YHWH of hosts: the whole earth is full of His glory.&quot; (verses 2–3) One seraph carries out an act of ritual purification for the prophet by touching his lips with a live coal from the altar (verses 6–7) &quot;And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.&quot;

The text describes the &quot;seraphim&quot; as winged celestial beings with a fiery passion for doing God&#x27;s good work. Notwithstanding the wording of the text itself, at least one Hebrew scholar claims that in the Hebrew Bible the seraphim do not have the status of angels, and that it is only in later sources (like &quot;De Coelesti Hierarchia&quot; or &quot;Summa Theologiae&quot;) that they are considered to be a division of the divine messengers. 

Seraphim appear in the 2nd-century BC Book of Enoch, where they are mentioned, in conjunction with cherubim, as the heavenly creatures standing nearest to the throne of God. In non-biblical sources they are sometimes called the &quot;Akyəst&quot; ( &quot;serpents&quot;, &quot;dragons&quot;; an alternate term for Hell).

In the Second Book of Enoch, two classes of celestial beings are mentioned alongside the seraphim and cherubim, known as the &quot;phoenixes&quot; and the &quot;chalkydri&quot; ( &quot;khalkýdrai&quot;, compound of &quot;khalkós&quot; &quot;brass, copper&quot; + &quot;hýdra&quot; &quot;hydra&quot;, &quot;water-serpent&quot;—lit. &quot;brazen hydras&quot;, &quot;copper serpents&quot;). Both are described as &quot;flying elements of the sun&quot; that reside in either the 4th or 7th heaven, who have twelve wings and burst into song at sunrise.

In the Book of Revelation (4:4–8), the beasts are described as being forever in God&#x27;s presence and praising him: &quot;[A]nd they rest not day and night, saying, &#x27;Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.&#x27;&quot; This account differs slightly from the account of Isaiah, stating in the eighth verse, &quot;And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within&quot;. They appear also in the Gnostic text, &quot;On the Origin of the World&quot;.

==In Judaism==
The 12th-century scholar Maimonides placed the seraphim in the fifth of ten ranks of angels in his exposition of the Jewish angelic hierarchy. In Kabbalah, the seraphim are the higher angels of the World of Beriah (&quot;Creation&quot;, first created realm, divine understanding), whose understanding of their distance from the absolute divinity of Atziluth causes their continual &quot;burning up&quot; in self-nullification. Through this they ascend to God, and return to their place. Below them in the World of Yetzirah (&quot;Formation&quot;, archetypal creation, divine emotions) are the Hayot angels of Ezekiel&#x27;s vision, who serve God with self-aware instinctive emotions (&quot;face of a lion, ox, eagle&quot;). Seraphim are part of the angelarchy of modern Orthodox Judaism. Isaiah&#x27;s vision is repeated several times in daily Jewish services, including at Kedushah prayer as part of the repetition of the Amidah, and in several other prayers as well. Conservative Judaism retains the traditional doctrines regarding angels and includes references to them in the liturgy, although a literal belief in angels is by no means universal among adherents. Adherents of Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism generally take images of angels as symbolic.

A Judean seal from the 8th century BCE depicts them as flying asp (snake), yet having human characteristics, as encountered by Isaiah in his commissioning as a prophet.

==In Christianity==

Medieval Christian theology places seraphim in the highest choir of the angelic hierarchy. They are the caretakers of God&#x27;s throne, continuously singing &quot;holy, holy, holy&quot;. Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite in his &quot;Celestial Hierarchy&quot; (vii), drew upon the Book of Isaiah in fixing the fiery nature of seraphim in the medieval imagination. Seraphim in his view helped God maintain perfect order and are not limited to chanting the &quot;trisagion&quot;. Taking his cue as well from writings in the Rabbinic tradition, the author gave an etymology for the &quot;Seraphim&quot; as &quot;those who kindle or make hot&quot;

The name seraphim clearly indicates their ceaseless and eternal revolution about Divine Principles, their heat and keenness, the exuberance of their intense, perpetual, tireless activity, and their elevative and energetic assimilation of those below, kindling them and firing them to their own heat, and wholly purifying them by a burning and all-consuming flame; and by the unhidden, unquenchable, changeless, radiant and enlightening power, dispelling and destroying the shadows of darkness

Origen wrote in &quot;On First Principles&quot; that the Seraphim, in the Book of Isaiah, are the physical representation of the Christ and the Holy Spirit. His rationale comes from the idea that nothing &quot;can wholly know the beginnings of all things and the ends of the universe&quot; aside from God. Origen concludes this section in writing about the Seraphim as beings that have the knowledge of God revealed to them which elevates the role of the Seraphim to divine levels:

Nevertheless whatever it is that these powers may have learned through the revelation of the Son of God and of the Holy Spirit-and they will certainly be able to acquire a great deal of knowledge, and the higher ones much more than the lower-still it is impossible for them to comprehend everything; for it is written, &#x27;The more part of God&#x27;s works are secret. This quote suggests that Origen believed the Seraphim are revealed this knowledge because of their anointed status as Son of God and the Holy Spirit. He was later criticized for making such claims and labeled a heretic by the Christian church. However, his theory about the Seraphim, as referred to in Isaiah, would be reflected in other early Christian literature, as well as early Christian belief through the second century.

Thomas Aquinas in his &quot;Summa Theologiae&quot; offers a description of the nature of seraphim:


The seraphim took on a mystic role in Giovanni Pico della Mirandola&#x27;s &quot;Oration on the Dignity of Man&quot; (1487), the epitome of Renaissance humanism. Pico took the fiery Seraphim—&quot;they burn with the fire of charity&quot;—as the highest models of human aspiration: &quot;impatient of any second place, let us emulate dignity and glory. And, if we will it, we shall be inferior to them in nothing&quot;, the young Pico announced, in the first flush of optimistic confidence in the human capacity that is the coinage of the Renaissance. &quot;In the light of intelligence, meditating upon the Creator in His work, and the work in its Creator, we shall be resplendent with the light of the Cherubim. If we burn with love for the Creator only, his consuming fire will quickly transform us into the flaming likeness of the Seraphim.&quot;

Bonaventure, a Franciscan theologian who was a contemporary of Aquinas, uses the six wings of the seraph as an important analogical construct in his mystical work &quot;The Journey of the Mind to God&quot;.

Christian theology developed an idea of seraphim as beings of pure light who enjoy direct communication with God.

The plural form of the word, &quot;seraphim&quot;, was given to Seraphim of Sarov upon his reception into the Sarov monastery. This later inspired Eugene Dennis Rose, a former student of Alan Watts, to adopt the name when he also entered Orthodox monasticism, later becoming known as Fr Seraphim Rose.

== In Islam ==

The Bearers of the Throne (&quot;ḥamlat al-arsh&quot;) are comparable to seraphim, described with six wings and four faces according to tradition. No description of their features is given in the Quran, only that their number is eight in . 

Their affiliation is not always clear and sometimes their role is swapped with the cherubim. In a book called &quot;Book of the Wonders of Creation and the peculiarities of Existing Things&quot;, these angels rank the highest, followed by &quot;the spirit&quot;, the archangels and then the cherubim. The Bearers of the Throne are entrusted with continuously worshipping God. Unlike the messenger angels, they remain in the heavenly realm and do not enter the world.

Seraphim (&quot;Sarufiyyun&quot; or &quot;Musharifin&quot;) are directly mentioned in a hadith from Al-Tirmidhi about a conversation between Muhammad and God, during the Night Journey, concerning what is between the Heavens and the Earth, often interpreted as a reference to the &quot;Exalted assembly&quot; disputing the creation of Adam in Surah Ṣād .

In Islamic traditions, they are often portrayed in zoomorphic forms. They are described as resembling different creatures: An eagle, a bull, a lion and a human. Other hadiths describes them with six wings and four faces. While according to a hadith transmitted from At-Targhib wat-Tarhib authored by ʻAbd al-ʻAẓīm ibn ʻAbd al-Qawī al-Mundhirī, the bearers of the throne were angels who were shaped like a rooster, with their feet on the earth and their nape supporting the Throne of God in the highest sky. a number modern Islamic scholars from Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University, and other institutes of Yemen and Mauritania also agreed the soundness of this hadith by quoting the commentary from Ibn Abi al-Izz who supported this narrative.

Al-Razi identifies the seraphim with the angels around God&#x27;s throne, next to the cherubim. They circulate the throne and keep praising God. Ibn Kathir, on the other hand, identifies the seraphim with those who carry the throne, the highest order of angels.

<text>Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory is a 1971 American musical fantasy film directed by Mel Stuart from a screenplay by Roald Dahl, based on his 1964 novel &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;. It stars Gene Wilder as chocolatier Willy Wonka. The film tells the story of a poor child named Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) who, upon finding a Golden Ticket in a chocolate bar, wins the chance to visit Willy Wonka&#x27;s chocolate factory along with four other children from around the world.

Filming took place in Munich from August to November 1970. Dahl was credited with writing the film&#x27;s screenplay; however, David Seltzer was brought in to do an uncredited rewrite. Against Dahl&#x27;s wishes, changes were made to the story, and other decisions made by the director led Dahl to disown the film. The musical numbers were written by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley while Walter Scharf arranged and conducted the orchestral score.

&quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; was released in the United States on June 30, 1971, by Paramount Pictures. With a budget of $3 million, the film received generally positive reviews from critics, but was not a big financial success, only earning $4 million by the end of its original run. It received a nomination for Best Original Score at the 44th Academy Awards and Wilder was nominated for Best Performance in a Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical at the 29th Golden Globe Awards. The film also introduced the song &quot;The Candy Man&quot;, which went on to be recorded by Sammy Davis Jr. and become a popular hit. &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; has since become highly popular on repeated television airings and home video sales. In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Plot ==
Charlie Bucket, a poor paperboy, passes Willy Wonka&#x27;s chocolate factory, where a tinker tells him that nobody ever enters or leaves the building. Charlie&#x27;s Grandpa Joe reveals that Wonka had shut down the factory due to espionage from rival confectioners; production resumed three years later, but the factory remained closed to the public and the new workers are unknown.

Wonka announces that he has hidden five Golden Tickets in Wonka Bars; the finders of the tickets will receive a tour of the factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate. The first four tickets are found by gluttonous Augustus Gloop, spoiled Veruca Salt, gum-chewer Violet Beauregarde, and television-addicted Mike Teevee. A mysterious man is seen whispering to each winner. Charlie opens a Wonka Bar for a ticket, but nothing is found. That night, the news states that the fifth ticket has been found by a millionaire in Paraguay, causing Charlie to lose hope.

On the day before the factory tour, Charlie finds money in a gutter and uses it to buy a Wonka Bar. Outside, it was revealed on newspapers that the fifth ticket was a hoax. He then opens the bars, which reveals the fifth ticket. On his way home, he encounters the man who spoke to the other winners. Introducing himself as Arthur Slugworth, one of Wonka&#x27;s competitors, the man offers Charlie a substantial monetary reward in exchange for a sample of Wonka&#x27;s new invention, the Everlasting Gobstopper. Arriving home with the Golden Ticket, Charlie chooses Grandpa Joe as his chaperone. 

The next day, Wonka greets the children at the front gates of the factory and leads them inside, where they are made to sign a contract. The tour begins in the Chocolate Room, where the visitors meet Wonka&#x27;s workforce: little people known as Oompa-Loompas. The children receive Everlasting Gobstoppers in the Inventing Room. One by one, each child is expelled from the tour except for Charlie: Augustus is sucked up a pipe after falling into the Chocolate River, Violet chews an experimental gum and swells into a giant human blueberry, Veruca falls down a garbage chute in the Egg Room, and Mike is shrunk to the size of a chocolate bar after misusing the Wonkavision teleporter. At one point, Charlie and Grandpa Joe sample Fizzy Lifting Drinks, causing them to float dangerously close to a large fan; they descend safely by burping.

When the tour is over, Wonka refuses to give Charlie and Grandpa Joe their chocolate prize on the grounds that they violated the contract by taking the Fizzy Lifting Drinks. Grandpa Joe plans to give the Gobstopper to Slugworth out of spite, but Charlie chooses to return it instead. Wonka declares Charlie the winner of the contest, revealing that &quot;Slugworth&quot; is actually one of his employees, and that the offer to buy the Gobstopper from the kids was a test of character. As the three fly over the town in the Wonkavator, a multi-directional glass elevator, Wonka explains that he created the contest to find a worthy successor and invites Charlie and his family to come and live in the factory.

=== Development ===
The idea for adapting the book into a film came about when director Mel Stuart&#x27;s 10-year-old daughter, Madeline, read the book and asked her father to make a film out of it, with &quot;Uncle Dave&quot; (producer David L. Wolper, who was not related to the Stuarts) producing. Stuart showed the book to Wolper, who happened to be in the midst of talks with the Quaker Oats Company regarding a vehicle to introduce a new candy bar from its Chicago-based Breaker Confections subsidiary (subsequently renamed The Willy Wonka Candy Company and sold to Nestlé). Wolper persuaded the company, which had no previous experience in the film industry, to buy the rights to the book and finance the picture for the purpose of promoting a new Quaker Oats &quot;Wonka Bar&quot;.

==== Writing ====
Wolper and Roald Dahl agreed that Dahl would also write the screenplay. Though credited for the film, Dahl had not delivered a completed screenplay at the start of production and only gave an outline pointing to sections of the book. Wolper called in David Seltzer for an uncredited rewrite after Dahl left over creative differences. Wolper promised to produce Seltzer&#x27;s next film for his lack of a credit as they needed to maintain credibility by keeping Dahl&#x27;s name attached to the production. Also uncredited were several short humorous scenes by screenwriter Robert Kaufman about the Golden Ticket hysteria. Changes to the story included Wonka&#x27;s character given more emphasis over Charlie; Slugworth, originally a minor character who was a Wonka industry rival in the book, was reworked into a spy so that the film could have a villain for intrigue; a belching scene was added with Grandpa and Charlie having &quot;fizzy lifting drinks&quot;; the walnut-shelling squirrels changed to golden-egg-laying geese; and the ending dialogue.

Seltzer also created a recurring theme that had Wonka quote from various literary sources, such as Arthur O&#x27;Shaughnessy&#x27;s &quot;Ode&quot;, Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; and William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. After completing the screenplay, Seltzer was exhausted and went on vacation to a remote cabin in Maine. However, while filming the final scene, Stuart was unhappy with the ending having Dahl&#x27;s version of Grandpa Joe just exclaiming &quot;Yippee!&quot; The director tracked down the writer to the only phone in the area which was attached to a tree. By chance, Seltzer was passing and answered the call. Stuart told him to think up an ending quickly as the production was waiting at great expense. Seltzer could only recall the overused phrase to fairytale endings therefore reworked Wonka&#x27;s final line to Charlie: &quot;Don&#x27;t forget what happened to the man who suddenly got everything he always wanted? ... He lived happily ever after.&quot;

==== Songwriting ====
Wolper decided with Stuart that the film would be a musical and approached composers Richard Rodgers and Henry Mancini, but both declined. Eventually, they secured the songwriting team Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley.

==== Title change ====
Different explanations have been given for the title change to &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;. In the United States during the 1960s, the term &quot;Mister Charlie&quot; had been used as a pejorative expression in the African-American community for a &quot;white man in power&quot; (historically plantation slave owners) and press reports claimed the change was due to &quot;pressure from black groups&quot;. During the same period, US soldiers in the Vietnam War used the derisive term &quot;Charlie&quot; for the Viet Cong, originating from the acronym VC using the callsign &quot;Victor Charlie&quot;. The studio publicity stated that the title &quot;was changed to put emphasis on the eccentric central character of Willy Wonka&quot;. However, Wolper said he changed the title to make the product placement for the Wonka Bar have a closer association. Stuart confirmed the matter was brought to his attention by some African-American actors and he also claimed to have changed the title, saying, &quot;If people say, &#x27;I saw &quot;Willy Wonka&quot;,&#x27; people would know what they were talking about. If they say, &#x27;I saw &quot;Charlie&quot;,&#x27; it doesn&#x27;t mean anything&quot;.

The book was also in the midst of a controversy when the film was announced. Protest groups including the NAACP had taken issue with the original Oompa-Loompas depicted as African pygmies and compared them to slavery. Stuart addressed the concerns for the film and suggested making them the distinctive green-and-orange characters.

==== Costume ====
Gene Wilder wanted specific changes to Wonka&#x27;s costume, including what type of trousers the character should wear, &quot;the color and cut&quot; of his jacket and the placement of pockets. Wilder&#x27;s attention to detail also requested, &quot;The hat is terrific, but making it shorter would make it more special&quot;.

=== Casting ===

Before Wilder was officially cast as Willy Wonka, producers considered many actors. Spike Milligan was Roald Dahl&#x27;s original choice. Peter Sellers reportedly begged Dahl for the role. Joel Grey was the front runner for the part but director Mel Stuart decided he was not physically imposing enough as the actor&#x27;s height was five-foot-five. The producers learned that Fred Astaire wanted the part, but the 72-year-old may have considered himself too old.

Actors were auditioned for the role of Willy Wonka in a suite at the Plaza Hotel in New York and by the end of the week Wilder had walked in. It was then Stuart and producer Wolper realised that they could stop looking. Wolper remarked, &quot;The role fit him tighter than one of Jacques Cousteau&#x27;s wetsuits.&quot; Stuart was captivated by Wilder&#x27;s &quot;humor in his eyes&quot; and said, &quot;His inflection was perfect. He had the sardonic, demonic edge that we were looking for.&quot; Wolper tried to suppress Stuart&#x27;s eagerness for Wilder as he wanted to negotiate the salary. Regardless, Stuart ran out into the hall as Wilder was leaving and offered him the part of Wonka.

When Wilder was cast as Wonka, he accepted the role on one condition: Stuart responded, &quot;What do you want to do that for?&quot; Wilder answered, &quot;From that time on, no one will know if I&#x27;m lying or telling the truth.&quot; Wilder was adamant that he would decline the role otherwise.

Jean Stapleton turned down the role of Mrs. Teevee. Jim Backus was considered for the role of Sam Beauregarde. Sammy Davis Jr. wanted to play Bill, the owner of Bill&#x27;s Candy Shop, but Stuart did not like the idea because he felt that the presence of a big star in the candy store scene would break the reality; however, Davis would make Bill&#x27;s signature song, &quot;The Candy Man&quot;, into a big hit. Anthony Newley also wanted to play Bill, but Stuart also dissuaded him for the same reason.

Ten actors of short stature were the Oompa Loompas, including one woman and nine men, and were cast internationally from France, Germany, Malta, Persia (now Iran), Turkey and the United Kingdom. They were portrayed by Rudy Borgstaller, George Claydon, Malcolm Dixon, Rusty Goffe, Ismed Hassan, Norman McGlen, Angelo Muscat, Pepe Poupee, Marcus Powell, and Albert Wilkinson.

The child actors who were auditioned from hundreds, Julie Dawn Cole, Denise Nickerson, Peter Ostrum, and Paris Themmen, all had acting experience from stage, school, theatre, television or commercials. Michael Böllner had the primary attribute of being rotund and was discovered in Germany when Stuart was location scouting. Stuart asked him to imagine being stuck in a tube and then &quot;squeezed him like a roll of putty&quot;.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography commenced on August 31, 1970, and ended on November 19, 1970. After location scouting in Europe, including the Guinness brewery in Ireland and a real-life chocolate factory in Spain, production designer Harper Goff decided to house the factory sets and the massive Chocolate Room at Bavaria Studios. It was also significantly cheaper than filming in the United States, and the primary shooting locations in Munich, Bavaria, West Germany were conducive to the desired atmosphere for Wonka&#x27;s factory. Stuart also liked the ambiguity and unfamiliarity of the location.

==== Locations ====
External shots of the factory were filmed at the gasworks of Stadtwerke München (Emmy-Noether-Straße 10); the entrance and side buildings still exist. The exterior of Charlie Bucket&#x27;s house, a set constructed solely for the film, was filmed at Quellenstraße in Munich. Charlie&#x27;s school was filmed at Katholisches Pfarramt St. Sylvester, Biedersteiner Straße 1 in Munich. Bill&#x27;s Candy Shop was filmed at Lilienstraße, Munich. The closing sequence, in which the Wonkavator is flying above the factory, is footage of Nördlingen, Bavaria, and the elevator rising shot showing that it shoots out of the factory was from Bößeneckerstraße 4, 86720 Nördlingen, Germany, now the location of a CAP-Märkte.

==== Production design ====
The construction of the original Inventing Room was meant to be an industrial room with steel tubes. Stuart envisioned it differently as a wacky inventor&#x27;s laboratory, with Rube Goldberg type mechanisms and unusual contraptions, and wanted it redesigned to be like Wonka&#x27;s personality. Goff sent his construction crew into Munich searching junkyards, bakeries, and car dealers for discarded machinery, tin funnels, and any other raw materials. This included building Wonka&#x27;s three-course gum machine, which was originally a solid state device, but Stuart requested an appliance whose operations had a visual experience for the audience. Stuart also instructed Goff to have all the props, furniture and fittings, excluding the light bulbs, in Wonka&#x27;s original office to be cut in half, to reflect the character&#x27;s eccentricity. Stuart stated, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t face the thought of ending the journey through this fabulous factory in an ordinary-looking office.&quot;

About a third of the props in the Chocolate Room set were edible. Veruca Salt had a chocolate watermelon; Mike Teevee had gum balls from a tree; Violet Beauregarde&#x27;s &quot;three-course gum&quot; was actually a toffee-based candy, and marzipan was freely available on set; also there were giant mushrooms filled with whipped cream; and the trees had edible leaves. The inedible items included giant gummy bears that were plastic (the ears were edible, however); the flavored wallpaper was not actually flavored; and Wonka&#x27;s flower cup was made of wax which Gene Wilder would chew on camera and spit out after each take.

According to Paris Themmen, who played Mike Teevee, &quot;The river was made of water with food coloring. At one point, they poured some cocoa powder into it to try to thicken it but it didn&#x27;t really work. When asked [what the river was made of], Michael Böllner, who played Augustus Gloop, answers, &#x27;It vas dirty, stinking vater. A combination of salt conditioner and some chemicals eventually removed the stink problem but it remained cold, dirty water.

In the scene at Mr. Salt&#x27;s peanut factory, where thousands of Wonka bars were being unwrapped to find a Golden Ticket, the bars were actually made of wood, which was a cheaper solution than rewrapping thousands of bars of real chocolate.

==== Performances ====
For the performances, Stuart used a recurring &quot;method&quot; tactic in a few scenes. When Wonka makes his entrance at the factory gates, nobody was aware of Wilder&#x27;s approach as he limped then somersaulted; the reaction was of real surprise. The director gave explicit instructions not to allow the child actors to see the Chocolate Room set until the day of the shoot as he wanted their reactions to be genuine. The exception was Julie Dawn Cole, as Goff gave her a sneak preview. Also, the actors were not warned about the tunnel boat ride scene. Similarly, when Wilder rehearsed the Wonka office scene, with Peter Ostrum as Charlie and Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe, it was in a much calmer tone. When filming started, he increasingly became angry. When he shouted, &quot;So you get nothing!&quot;, it was so that the reactions would be authentic.

==== Other issues ====
Stuart had issues with the large size of the Chocolate Room set with difficulties lighting the background. Julie Dawn Cole&#x27;s performance of &quot;I Want It Now&quot; as Veruca Salt required 36 takes and was filmed on her thirteenth birthday. Director-choreographer Bob Fosse came in every afternoon to complain because the filming was overrunning towards the end and stopping him from shooting &quot;Cabaret&quot; on the same stage.

==== Retrospective ====
In addition to the main scenes set in town and at the factory, several comic interludes were also shot. Stuart lamented in his book &quot;Pure Imagination: The Making of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, that his favorite scene was cut after poor test screenings. In the scene, which took a lot of preparation and money to film, an English explorer climbs a holy mountain to ask a guru the meaning of life. The guru requests a Wonka Bar. Finding no golden ticket, he says, &quot;Life is a disappointment.&quot; Stuart loved the scene, but few laughed. He invited a psychologist friend to a preview, where the audience reaction was again muted. The psychologist told him, &quot;You don&#x27;t understand, Mel. For a great many people, life &quot;is&quot; a disappointment.&quot;

When interviewed for the 30th anniversary special edition in 2001, Wilder stated that he enjoyed working with most of the child actors, but said that he and the film crew had some problems with Paris Themmen. Wilder recalled, &quot;Oh, he was a little brat!&quot; He then addressed Themmen directly, &quot;Now if you&#x27;re watching this, you know that I love you now, but you were a troublemaker then.&quot; An example of Themmen&#x27;s misbehaviour was releasing bees from a beehive on Wonka&#x27;s three-course gum machine. &quot;As life mirrored one of the morals of the movie,&quot; Stuart remembers, &quot;one of the bees stung him.&quot;

== Release ==
=== Theatrical ===
&quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; was released by Paramount Pictures on June 30, 1971. The film was not a big success, eventually earning $4 million worldwide on a budget of $3 million, and was the 24th highest-grossing film of the year in North America.

For the promotion before its release, the film received advance publicity through TV commercials offering a &quot;Willy Wonka candy factory kit&quot; for sending $1.00 and two seals from boxes of Quaker cereals such as King Vitaman, Life and any of the Cap&#x27;n Crunch brands.

=== Television ===
The film made its television debut on Thanksgiving night, November 28, 1974, on NBC.

The film was repeated the following year on November 23, 1975, on NBC. There was some controversy with the broadcast, as a football game between the Oakland Raiders and Washington Redskins went into overtime, and the first 40 minutes of the film were cut. The film placed 19th in the television ratings for the week ending November 23, beating out &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot; and &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;. The next television showing of the film was on May 2, 1976, when it placed 46th in the ratings. Some television listings indicate the showing was part of &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; time slot.

=== Home media ===
In December 1984, the film became available on VHS and Betamax in the United Kingdom and was released in the United States on VHS the same year.

In 1996, the film was released on LaserDisc as a &quot;25th anniversary edition&quot;. Additional features included the original and reissue theatrical trailers and music minus vocals for &quot;sing-alongs&quot;. Notes explain the letterboxed version as &quot;presented in a &quot;matted&quot; widescreen format preserving the 1.85:1 aspect ratio of its original theatrical presentation. The black bars at the top and bottom of the screen are normal for this format&quot;. VHS copies were also available, but only containing the &quot;standard&quot; full screen version. The &quot;standard&quot; version is an open matte print, in which the mattes used to make the image &quot;widescreen&quot; are removed, revealing more picture at the top and bottom that was masked off from viewers.

In 1997, the film was first released on DVD in a &quot;25th anniversary edition&quot; as a double sided disc containing a &quot;widescreen&quot; and &quot;standard&quot; version.

On August 28, 2001, a remastered special edition DVD was released, celebrating the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary, but in &quot;standard&quot; full screen only. Because there was no &quot;widescreen&quot; release, fans&#x27; petitions eventually led Warner Home Video to issue a letterboxed version on November 13, 2001. Several original cast members reunited to film a &quot;making-of&quot; documentary titled &quot;Pure Imagination: The Story of &#x27;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&quot;&#x27;. The two format editions featured restored sound and better picture quality. In addition to the &quot;Pure Imagination&quot; feature, the DVD included a trailer, a gallery and audio commentary by the cast. It was also released on VHS, with only one of the special features (the &quot;Pure Imagination&quot; documentary).

In 2007, Warner Home Video released the film on HD DVD with all the bonus features from the 2001 DVD. On October 20, 2009, the film was released on Blu-ray. It included all the bonus features from the 2001 DVD and 2007 HD DVD as well as a 38-page book.

On November 1, 2011, a deluxe edition set was released for the film&#x27;s 40th anniversary. The set included the film on Blu-ray and DVD, a bonus disc and a number of collectible items including a Wonka Bar tin, four scented pencils, a scented eraser, a book about the making of the film, original production notes and a &quot;Golden Ticket&quot; for the chance to win a trip to Los Angeles.

On June 29, 2021, a 4K Blu-ray was released by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment to coincide with the film&#x27;s 50th anniversary. This edition restored the original Paramount logo at the beginning of the film. The film would also be available to stream and download digitally in 4K high definition, including standard definition, on devices from various online video platforms.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, calling it:

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the film as &quot;lively and enjoyable&quot; and called Wilder&#x27;s performance &quot;a real star turn&quot;, but thought the songs were &quot;instantly forgettable&quot; and that the factory looked &quot;a lot more literal and industrial and less empathic than it might have&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;an okay family musical fantasy&quot; that had &quot;good&quot; performances but lacked any tunes that were &quot;especially rousing or memorable&quot;. Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; panned it as &quot;tedious and stagy with little sparkle and precious little humor&quot;. Gene Siskel gave the film two stars out of four, writing, &quot;Anticipation of what Wonka&#x27;s factory is like is so well developed that its eventual appearance is a terrible letdown. Sure enough there is a chocolate river, but it looks too much like the Chicago River to be appealing. The quality of the color photography is flat. The other items in Wonka&#x27;s factory—bubblegum trees and lollypop flowers—also look cheap. Nothing in the factory is appealing.&quot; Jan Dawson of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that after a slow start the second half of the film was &quot;an unqualified delight—one of those rare, genuinely imaginative children&#x27;s entertainments at which no adult need be embarrassed to be seen&quot;.

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 92% approval rating and an average rating of 8/10 based on 61 reviews. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;&quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; is strange yet comforting, full of narrative detours that don&#x27;t always work but express the film&#x27;s uniqueness.&quot;

=== Roald Dahl&#x27;s reaction ===
Dahl disowned the film and was &quot;infuriated&quot; by the plot deviations and considered the music to be &quot;saccharine, sappy and sentimental&quot;. He was also disappointed because the film &quot;placed too much emphasis on Willy Wonka and not enough on Charlie&quot; and because Gene Wilder was cast as Wonka instead of Spike Milligan. In 1996, Dahl&#x27;s second wife, Felicity, commented on her husband&#x27;s objections toward film adaptations of his works, saying, &quot;They always want to change a book&#x27;s storyline. What makes Hollywood think children want the endings changed for a film, when they accept it in a book?&quot;

== Legacy ==
&quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; remained in obscurity in the years immediately following its original release. When the distribution rights lapsed in 1977, Paramount declined to renew, considering it not viable. The rights defaulted back to the Quaker Oats Company, which was no longer involved in the film business, and therefore sold them to Warner Bros. for $500,000. Wolper engineered the rights sale to Warner Bros., where he became a corporate director after selling his production company to it the previous year.

By the 1980s, the film had experienced an increase in popularity due to repeated television broadcasts; it also gained cult status with a new audience in home video sales. In 1996, there was a 25th anniversary theatrical re-release which grossed the film a further $21 million. In 2003, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked it 25th in the &quot;Top 50 Cult Movies&quot; of all time. The tunnel scene during the boat ride has been cited as one of the scariest in a film for children, for its surreal visuals, and was ranked No. 74 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Scariest Movie Moments&quot;. The scene has also been interpreted as a psychedelic trip, though director Stuart denied that was his intention.

In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

=== Awards and nominations ===
== Music ==
The original score and songs were composed by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley, and musical direction was by Walter Scharf. The soundtrack was first released by Paramount Records in 1971.

Sammy Davis Jr. recorded the song &quot;The Candy Man&quot;, which became his only number-one hit. It would spend three weeks at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart starting June 10, 1972, and two weeks at the top of the easy-listening chart.

On October 8, 1996, Hip-O Records (in conjunction with MCA Records, which owned the Paramount catalog by then), released the soundtrack on CD as a &quot;25th Anniversary Edition&quot;. In 2016, UMe and Geffen Records released a 45th Anniversary Edition LP.

====Footnotes====
== In popular culture ==
Various comedy TV series have referenced the film, mainly as a parody. They include &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, &quot;My Wife and Kids&quot;, the American version of &quot;The Office&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;. Animated TV series have also done parodies respectively, &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; (&quot;Golden Diskette&quot; in 1997); &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (&quot;Trash of the Titans&quot; in 1998 and &quot;Eeny Teeny Maya Moe&quot; in 2009); &quot;Futurama&quot; (&quot;Fry and the Slurm Factory&quot; in 1999); &quot;Family Guy&quot; (&quot;Wasted Talent&quot; in 2000); &quot;Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi&quot; (&quot;Taffy Trouble&quot; in 2004); &quot;South Park&quot; (&quot;Le Petit Tourette&quot; in 2007); &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; (&quot;Tales from the Citadel&quot; in 2017); and &quot;American Dad!&quot; (&quot;Jeff and the Dank Ass Weed Factory&quot; in 2019).

Marilyn Manson&#x27;s 1995 music video for their song &quot;Dope Hat&quot; was influenced by the boat ride scene. In 2001, the music video of Alien Ant Farm&#x27;s song &quot;Movies&quot; paid homage to various Hollywood films and included a scene in which the band members were dressed as Oompa-Loompas.

In the 2010s, a still from the movie became a popular Internet meme known as Condescending Wonka. In 2017, in an episode of the TV series &quot;Pawn Stars&quot; a combination of the original Everlasting Gobstopper and Wonka Bar props sold for $105,000, and an animated adaptation of the film with Tom and Jerry was released as &quot;Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&quot;. In 2023, elements from the film, including the Oompa-Loompa design and the song &quot;Pure Imagination&quot;, were used in the origin story film &quot;Wonka&quot;.

The trail mostly follows the edge of the Niagara Escarpment, one of the nineteen UNESCO World Biosphere Reserves in Canada. The land the trail traverses is owned by the Government of Ontario, local municipalities, local conservation authorities, private landowners, and the Bruce Trail Conservancy (BTC). The Bruce Trail is the oldest and longest marked hiking trail in Canada. Its name is linked to the Bruce Peninsula and Bruce County, through which the trail runs. The trail is named after the county, which was named after James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin who was the Governor General of the Province of Canada from 1847 to 1854.

==History==
The idea for creating the Bruce Trail came about in 1959 out of a meeting between Ray Lowes and Robert Bateman, of the Federation of Ontario Naturalists. Ray Lowes&#x27; vision was of a public footpath that would span the entire Niagara Escarpment.

On September 23, 1960, the first meeting of the Bruce Trail Committee took place, consisting of four attending members—Ray Lowes, Philip Gosling, Norman Pearson, and Dr. Robert McLaren. Each member became instrumental in building the Bruce Trail.

Trail Director Philip Gosling was responsible for gaining access to the Niagara Escarpment. With a team of volunteers, he visited major towns along the proposed route to discuss their vision of the trail and to solicit help from landowners. Their efforts were successful, and by 1963 regional clubs were established along the length of the Trail. Each club was responsible for obtaining landowner approvals, organizing trail construction, and maintenance efforts within their region of the trail.

On March 13, 1963, the Bruce Trail Association was incorporated in Ontario, and the first edition of the Association&#x27;s newsletter, Bruce Trail News, was published that same year. Membership grew to 200. Dr. Aubrey Diem, an assistant professor of Geography at the University of Waterloo, compiled the first guidebook in 1965. The cairn at the northern terminus of the Bruce Trail in Tobermory was unveiled in 1967 to coincide with Canada&#x27;s Centennial Year.

In August 2021, the Bruce Trail Conservancy purchased nearly 400 acres of land known as the Maple Cross Nature Reserve, its largest acquisition to date. The new protected area allowed the Bruce Trail to be extended an additional 1.8 kilometers in the Cape Chin area on the Saugeen (Bruce) Peninsula.

==Natural features==

There are many waterfalls along the Bruce trail, where streams or rivers flow over the Niagara Escarpment. Niagara Falls, by far the most famous water feature in the area, can be reached by a side trail of the Bruce Trail proper. There is also a wide range of plant and wildlife along the trail, including slow-growing centuries-old coniferous trees right on the limestone lip of the escarpment itself. The Cheltenham Badlands is a natural feature exposed by human activity, namely farming.

The Bruce Trail and the escarpment run through some of the most populated areas of Ontario, with an estimated 7 million people living within . Golf courses, housing, and quarries are all examples of the threatening impact that this many people have on the natural environment. The popularity of the trail itself, especially near urban areas, and the careless attitude of some of its users also paradoxically threaten the quality and viability of the trail.

==Route==

The trail begins in the Niagara Peninsula of Southern Ontario in Queenston, Ontario, on the Niagara River, not far from Niagara Falls. The cairn marking its southern terminus is in a parking lot, about from General Brock&#x27;s Monument on the easterly side of the monument&#x27;s park grounds. From there, it travels through St. Catharines, where it passes through wine country near the Short Hills Bench. It continues due north through the major towns or cities of Hamilton, Burlington, Milton, Halton Hills, Walters Falls, Owen Sound, Wiarton, and finally Tobermory.

It passes through parks operated by various levels of government, including Woodend Conservation Area in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Battlefield Park in Stoney Creek, Dundas Valley Conservation Area in Dundas, the Hamilton-Brantford Rail Trail, Mount Nemo Conservation Area, Rattlesnake Point Conservation Area, Crawford Lake Conservation Area, Mono Cliffs Provincial Park, and the Bruce Peninsula National Park, which is located between Georgian Bay and Lake Huron near the northern tip of Bruce Peninsula. Its northern terminus is in Tobermory, the jumping off point for Fathom Five National Marine Park.

Approximately half of the trail runs through public land. In order to make a complete connection, the trail runs partly on private property and partly on road allowances. When going through private property, the BTC has made agreements with landowners to allow trail users to pass through. Using roads is not the best route for the trail. In these sections, the BTC is involved in acquiring land along what it calls the &quot;optimum route.&quot;

==Maintenance==

The Federation of Ontario Naturalists surveyed the route in the early 1960s, and the responsibility for maintaining the trail was assumed by the nascent Bruce Trail Association; as of 2007, it is called the Bruce Trail Conservancy.

Currently headquartered at 55 Head Street in Dundas, the BTC marks and maintains the main trail as well as many side trails. Trail maintenance includes building bridges over streams and gullies, building stairs and switchbacks to climb slopes, building stiles over fences, and rerouting portions of the trail that have become worn through overuse.

The trail is subdivided into nine sections, each with a subsidiary club:

Volunteers inspect, repair, and build footbridges, retaining walls, stiles, and handholds along their section of the route. The BTC and subsidiary clubs offer badges for those hikers who complete the whole trail or any of its sections under prescribed conditions.

The main trail is marked with the BTC logo, a white lozenge with black text and drawings for the Bruce Trail and an upward pointing arrow, which does not act as a part of a navigational marker. The actual blazes for the main trail are white markings, approximately wide by high, with turns indicated by stacking two blazes off centre to indicate the direction to take. The blazes for the of associated side trails are similar, except they are blue.

==Long distance activities==
The BTC regularly holds events called &quot;end to end&quot; hikes. These events, which are sometimes held over two to three days, challenge hikers to walk over long sections of the trail daily in order to hike the entire length of the trail within one of the Bruce Trail clubs.

The Bruce Trail has also attracted long-distance runners who attempt to run its entire length. The first Fastest Known Time (FKT) was set in 1995. During the COVID19 pandemic, a number of runners broke the FKT from 2017. 
The Highlands Trailblazers Nordic Ski Team completed a relay-style run of the entire trail in 8 days, starting in Tobermory on June 24, 2008, and finishing in Queenston on July 1, 2008. This run was both a training event as well as a fundraiser for the team. In 2009, two 10-person teams running continuously in an event called the Blaze Race set a new end-to-end relay record of 3 days, 23 hours, and 10 minutes.

In 2012, adventure seekers Fred Losani, Peter Turkstra, Mark Maclennan, and Teemu Lakkasuo went on a quest to raise funds and awareness for inner-city food and nutrition programs in Hamilton, as well as the Bruce Trail Conservancy as they celebrate 50 years. The adventure began on September 24, 2012, in Queenston, in the Niagara region, and ended approximately one month later in Tobermory. Along the way the hikers had the opportunity to walk with students, interact via live webcam and satellite phone transmissions, and educate students about the importance of proper nutrition, healthy living, and maintaining the Bruce Trail.

<text>A posset (, also historically spelled poshote, poshotte, poosay) was originally a popular British hot drink made of milk curdled with wine or ale, often spiced, which was often used as a remedy.

The original drink became extinct and the name was revived in the 19th century and applied to a cream, sugar and citrus-based confection, which is consumed today as a cold set dessert nearly indistinguishable from syllabub.

== Introduction ==
To make the drink, milk was heated to a boil, then mixed with wine or ale, which curdled it, and spiced with nutmeg and cinnamon.

It was considered a specific remedy for some minor illnesses, such as a cold, and a general remedy for others, as even today people drink hot milk to help them sleep.

== History ==

The OED traces the word to the 15th century: various Latin vocabularies translate &quot;balducta&quot;, &quot;bedulta&quot;, or &quot;casius&quot; as &quot;poshet&quot;, &quot;poshoote&quot;, &quot;possyt&quot;, or &quot;possot&quot;. Russell&#x27;s &quot;Boke of Nurture&quot; (c. 1460) lists various dishes and ingredients that &quot;close a mannes stomak&quot;, including &quot;þe possate&quot;. Posset is frequently used as a starting point for other recipes (e.g. &quot;Make a styf Poshote of Milke an Ale&quot;, and &quot;Take cowe Mylke, &amp; set it ouer þe fyre, &amp; þrow þer-on Saunderys, &amp; make a styf poshotte of Ale&quot;, each of which is the first sentence of a longer recipe). Recipes for it appear in other 15th-century sources: boil milk, add either wine or ale &quot;and no salt&quot;, let it cool, gather the curds and discard the whey, and season with ginger, sugar, and possibly &quot;sweet wine&quot; and candied anise. Certain monks would make a posset including eggs and figs, a possible precursor to eggnog.

In 14th and 15th century cookery manuals, a possibly-related word, spelled variously &quot;possenet&quot;, &quot;postnet&quot;, or &quot;posnet&quot;, is used to mean a small pot or saucepan. In 16th-century and later sources, possets are generally made from lemon or other citrus juice, cream and sugar. Eggs are often added. Some recipes used breadcrumbs to thicken the beverage.

&quot;Posset sets&quot; for mixing and serving possets were popular gifts, and valuable ones (often made of silver) were heirlooms. Such sets contained a posset &quot;pot&quot;, or &quot;bowl&quot;, or &quot;cup&quot; to serve it in, a container for mixing it in, and usually various containers for the ingredients, as well as spoons. The posset set that the Spanish ambassador gave Queen Mary I of England and King Philip II of Spain when they became betrothed in 1554 is believed to have been made by Benvenuto Cellini and is of crystal, gold, precious gems, and enamel. It is on display at Hatfield House in England and consists of a large, stemmed, covered bowl; two open, stemmed vessels; a covered container; three spoons; and two forks.

The word &quot;posset&quot; is mostly used nowadays for a cold set dessert invented in the late 19th c., containing cream and lemon, similar to syllabub. It is also used to refer to the semi-digested milk brought up by babies after a feed.

<doc id="174568" wikidata="Q1723650" url="?curid=174568" title="Caudle">
<text>A caudle (or caudel) was a hot drink that recurred in various guises throughout British cuisine from the Middle Ages into Victorian times. It was thick and sweet, and seen as particularly suitable and sustaining for invalids and new mothers. At some periods of history, caudle recipes were based on milk and eggs, like eggnog. Later variants were more similar to a gruel, a sort of drinkable oatmeal porridge. Like the original forms of posset (a drink of wine and milk, rather than a set dessert), a caudle was usually alcoholic.

There were special caudle cups, larger than teacups, often with a cover, and perhaps two handles. These were either in pottery or metal, and might be given as presents. 

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;caudle&quot; came into Middle English via the Old North French word &quot;caudel&quot;, ultimately derived from Latin , &quot;warm&quot;. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, the word derived from Medieval Latin , a diminutive of , a warm drink, from , hot. The Oxford English Dictionary cites the use of the word to 1297. The word&#x27;s etymological connection to heat makes it cognate with &quot;cauldron&quot;.

== Recipes ==
A related recipe for skyr, a cultured dairy product, appears in the early 13th century. The earliest surviving recipe for caudle, from 1300 to 1325, is simply a list of ingredients: wine, wheat starch, raisins, and sugar to &quot;abate the strength of the wine&quot;.

Another recipe from the late 14th century has more ingredients and more details on the cooking procedure: mix breadcrumbs, wine, sugar or honey, and saffron, bring to a boil, then thicken with egg yolks, and sprinkle with salt, sugar, and ginger. A 15th-century English cookbook includes three caudle recipes: ale or wine is heated and thickened with egg yolks and/or ground almonds, then optionally spiced with sugar, honey, saffron, and/or ginger (one recipe specifically says &quot;no salt&quot;). In a description of an initiation ceremony at Merton College, Oxford in 1647, caudle is described as a &quot;syrupy gruel with spices and wine or ale added&quot;. William Carew Hazlitt provides a number of recipes for caudles and possets in his 1886 book, &quot;Old Cookery Books and Ancient Cuisine&quot;.

The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition describes it as &quot;a drink of warm gruel, mixed with spice and wine, formerly given to women in childbed&quot;, i.e. as a restorative food during her postpartum confinement.

Emily Post&#x27;s 1922 &quot;Etiquette in Society, in Business, in Politics, and at Home&quot;, the classic guide to American manners, states that &quot;although according to cook-books caudle is a gruel, the actual &quot;caudle&quot; invariably served at christenings is a hot eggnog, drunk out of little punch cups&quot; (see Punch bowl).

== &quot;For the sick and lying-in&quot;==

Aside from the initiation ceremony mentioned above, caudle was often served to people who were seen to need strengthening, especially invalids and new mothers. A historian of Georgian England says that maternity hospitals always served a &quot;traditional postlabor fortified caudle&quot; to women who had just given birth. The British Lying-In Hospital had &quot;Laws, Orders, and Regulations&quot; printed to be displayed on the wards, detailing among other things, the menu. Mothers on the &quot;low diet&quot; had caudle; when they graduated to the &quot;common diet&quot; it was beer caudle; and the &quot;full diet&quot; had no need of the invalid liquid anymore.

Maria Rundell included a &quot;caudle for the sick and lying-in&quot; in her best-selling &quot;A New System of Domestic Cookery&quot; (1806). (&quot;Lying-in&quot; is an obsolete term for childbirth, referring to the extended period of bed rest that marked the traditional recuperation time.) Judith Montefiore likewise included caudle with the &quot;recipes for invalids&quot; in her &quot;The Jewish Manual&quot; (1846), the first exposition of Jewish cuisine in English. Five years later, &quot;The English Housekeeper&quot; by Anne Cobbett (daughter of William Cobbett) gives variants of caudles, of either gruel (oatmeal) or rice, with different types of alcohol, and seasonings, including . She devotes a chapter to invalid food, making the point that &quot;Often when the Doctor&#x27;s skill has saved the life of his patient [...] it remains for the diligent nurse to prepare the cooling drinks and restorative foods [...]. Everything which is prepared for a sick person should be delicately clean, served quickly, in the nicest order; and in a small quantity at a time.&quot;

==Caudle parties==

As caudel was served to new mothers to build up their strength, so it was offered to their visitors, to share in the happy occasion. &quot;Cake and caudel&quot; or &quot;taking caudle&quot; became the accepted phrases for a &quot;lying-in visit&quot;, when women went to see their friends&#x27; new babies. These were all-female occasions, as more than one man noted. The American playwright Royall Tyler has one of the female characters in the comedy of manners &quot;The Contrast&quot; (1787) decline the offer of a man&#x27;s escorting her by claiming that &quot;half [her] visits are cake and caudel&quot; and therefore unsuitable for him. A generation later in 1821, Thomas Gaspey wrote of these visits (with the italics in the original):

Offering caudel, or cake and caudel, to all lying-in visitors is referred to as an old British custom. Queen Charlotte, consort of George III, bore him 15 princes and princesses. After the christening of the youngest, Princess Amelia in 1783, &quot;the greater part of the company then paid a visit to the nursery, where they were entertained (as usual on such occasions) with cake and caudel.&quot; This continued into Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign: the day after she gave birth to the Prince of Wales, &quot;many of the female Nobility called at Buckingham Palace, and were received by Lady Charlemont, the Lady in waiting, and after taking caudle were taken to the north wing to see the infant Prince.&quot;

But it was not just nobles who came. &quot;The Court Magazine and Belle Assemblée&quot; reported that the aftermath of a royal birth was &quot;a usual reception of the public to cake and caudel&quot;. The &quot;London Chronicle&quot; reported in 1765 that &quot;The resort of different ranks of people at St. James&#x27;s to receive the Queen&#x27;s Caudle is now very great.&quot;
After the birth of Princess Augusta Sophia, the sixth child of George III and Queen Charlotte:

In England, the custom had died out by around 1850, but the birth of the current King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands in Utrecht in 1967 was celebrated there a few days later by an apparently all-male caudle (&quot;candeel&quot; in Dutch) party including his father, the Prime Minister, and other dignitaries, who wore morning dress to eat caudle with teaspoons from highly decorated handleless cups with saucers, held up near the mouth, as the photos in the state archives show. The event was held in the Utrecht city hall, where after the caudle the new prince&#x27;s birth was registered by the mayor. The birth of the prince&#x27;s mother, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, in 1938 had also been celebrated with a caudle party.

==Caudle cups==

There was a vessel particular to the drink, the caudle cup, a traditional gift, either for a pregnant woman, or on visits by female friends to the mother lying-in. Late 17th and early 18th-century examples in silver are low bulbous bowls with two handles, and often a cover. These were passed around among the company.

Poorer people used small bulbous and handleless earthenware cups, often painted with the monarch. In the early 18th century lidded &quot;spout pots&quot; were used; these were two-handled with a teapot-style spout on one of the other sides. As European porcelain developed in the 18th century, the two-handled cup with a cover, similar to the shape called a &quot;chocolate cup&quot; in continental examples, but often more bulbous, became the usual form of caudle cup, now with a saucer. These were typically highly decorated with overglaze enamel painting, and presented by the wealthy in pairs to new mothers. They were now smaller, and probably for individual use. Other than their use when lying-in, they functioned as cabinet cups, too ornate and expensive for regular use, and displayed in a china cabinet. In a London auction of Chelsea porcelain and Derby porcelain in 1771 the most expensive examples were sold for £12 for a pair, a considerable sum. They continued to be made through the 19th century as cabinet pieces, after the custom of consuming caudle largely died away.

At lower levels of society, an alternative pottery gift to bring to a lying-in caudle party was a model cradle complete with baby, into which coins or a small gift were added. These were rarely of fine porcelain.

==Other uses==
A caudle formed part of the Beltane (May Day) fire festival celebrations collated by James Frazier in &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;. He quotes at length Thomas Pennant, &quot;who traveled in Perthshire in the year 1769&quot;: on the first of May, the herdsmen of every village hold their Bel-tien, a rural sacrifice. They cut a square trench on the ground, leaving the turf in the middle; on that they make a fire of wood, on which they dress a large caudle of eggs, butter, oatmeal and milk; and bring besides the ingredients of the caudle, plenty of beer and whisky; for each of the company must contribute something. The rites begin with spilling some of the caudle on the ground, by way of libation: on that everyone takes a cake of oatmeal, upon which are raised nine square knobs, each dedicated to some particular being, the supposed preserver of their flocks and herds, or to some particular animal, the real destroyer of them: each person then turns his face to the fire, breaks off a knob, and flinging it over his shoulders, says, &#x27;This I give to thee, preserve thou my horses; this to thee, preserve thou my sheep; and so on.&#x27; After that, they use the same ceremony to the noxious animals: &#x27;This I give to thee, O fox! spare thou my lambs; this to thee, O hooded crow! this to thee, O eagle!&#x27; When the ceremony is over, they dine on the caudle; and after the feast is finished, what is left is hid by two persons deputed for that purpose; but on the next Sunday they reassemble, and finish the reliques of the first entertainment.

Frazier notes other Scottish May Day celebrations with similar dishes, &quot;a repast of eggs and milk in the consistence of a custard&quot;.

Apparently it was &quot;a custom in France to bring the bridegroom a caudle in the middle of the night on his wedding-night&quot;, according to an explanatory note in an 1877 edition of &quot;The Essays of Montaigne&quot;, presumably inserted by the English editor, William Carew Hazlitt.

<text>The Niagara Escarpment is a long escarpment, or cuesta, in Canada and the United States that starts from the south shore of Lake Ontario westward, circumscribes the top of the Great Lakes Basin running from New York through Ontario, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The escarpment is the cliff over which the Niagara River plunges at Niagara Falls, for which it is named. 
The escarpment is a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve. The reserve has the oldest forest ecosystem and trees in eastern North America.

The escarpment is not a fault line but the result of unequal erosion. It is composed of an outcrop belt of the Lockport Formation of Silurian age, and is similar to the Onondaga Formation, which runs in a parallel outcrop belt just to the south, through western New York and southern Ontario. The escarpment is the most prominent of several escarpments formed in the bedrock of the Great Lakes Basin. From its easternmost point just south of Lake Ontario, the escarpment shapes in part the individual basins and landforms of Lake Ontario, Lake Huron, and Lake Michigan.

In Rochester, New York, the Genesee River flows through the city in three waterfalls over the scarp face. The escarpment thence runs westward to the Niagara River, forming a deep gorge north of Niagara Falls, which itself cascades over the scarp face. In Southern Ontario, it spans the Niagara Peninsula, closely following the Lake Ontario shore through the cities of St. Catharines and Hamilton, where it takes a sharp turn north in the town of Milton toward Georgian Bay. It then follows the Georgian Bay shore northwestwards to form the spine of the Bruce Peninsula and Manitoulin Island, as well as several smaller islands in northern Lake Huron, where it turns westwards into the Upper Peninsula of northern Michigan, south of Sault Ste. Marie. It extends down the Garden Peninsula and Potawatomi Islands into Wisconsin following the Door Peninsula and then continues more inland from the western coast of Lake Michigan until ending in the southeastern corner of Dodge County.

==Formation==
Study of rock exposures and drillholes demonstrates that no displacement of the rock layers occurs at the escarpment, which is not a fault line but the result of unequal erosion. The escarpment&#x27;s caprock is dolomitic limestone, also known as dolostone, which is more resistant and overlies weaker, more easily eroded shale as a weathering-resistant &quot;cap&quot;. The escarpment formed over millions of years through a process of differential erosion of these rocks of different hardnesses. Through time the soft rocks weather away or erode by the action of streams. The gradual removal of the soft rocks undercuts the resistant caprock, leaving a cliff or escarpment. The erosional process is most readily seen at Niagara Falls, where the river has quickened the process. It can also be seen at the three waterfalls of the Genesee River at Rochester (additional resistant rock layers make more than one escarpment in some places). Also, in some places thick glacial deposits, such as the Oak Ridges Moraine, conceal the Niagara Escarpment, such as north of Georgetown, Ontario, where it actually continues under glacial till and reappears farther north.

The dolomite cap was laid down as sediment on the floor of a marine environment. In Michigan, behind (south of) the escarpment, the &quot;cuesta&quot; capstone slopes gently to form a wide basin, the floor of an Ordovician-Silurian-age tropical sea. (The escarpment is essentially the remnant shoreline of that sea.) There the constant deposition of minute shells and fragments of biologically-generated calcium carbonate, mixed with sediment washed in by erosion of the virtually lifeless landmasses, eventually formed a limestone layer. During the Silurian period, some magnesium substituted for some of the calcium in the carbonates, slowly forming harder dolomite layers in the same fashion. This dolomite basin contains Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Erie. Worldwide sea levels were at their all-time maximum in the Ordovician; as the sea retreated, erosion inevitably began.

==Human geography==

The escarpment was a major obstacle in the construction of the Erie Canal in New York and was traversed by a series of locks; the community which grew up at the site thus became known as Lockport, New York.

The Welland Canal allows ships to traverse the escarpment between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario on the Niagara Peninsula of Ontario. The canal also allowed Sea Lamprey, an invasive species native to Northern Atlantic Ocean, to enter Lake Erie and became a concern for the lake&#x27;s ecosystem. 

In southern Ontario, the Bruce Trail runs the length of the escarpment from Queenston on the Niagara River to Tobermory on the Bruce Peninsula. Highway 401, Canada&#x27;s busiest, also crosses the Niagara Escarpment, beginning its long descent through rolling hills, farmland, and towns west of Milton. Rock exposed on the face of the escarpment can be seen along Highway 26 from Owen Sound eastwards towards Meaford, Ontario.

Hamilton, Ontario is on the escarpment in such a way that the north end of the city is below and the south part above. Commonly referred to as &quot;The Mountain&quot; by its residents, many roads or &quot;mountain accesses&quot; join the urban core below with the suburban expansion above. From 1892 to 1936, the Hamilton Incline Railway transported people up and down &quot;The Mountain.&quot;

High Cliff State Park in Wisconsin shows how modern and prehistoric humans used the escarpment for not only cultural reasons, but economic gains, as well. A number of different animal and geometric effigy mounds and the remains of an early 20th-century limestone quarry and kiln are within the park.

The relief and exposed edge are used by several wind farms stretching from Pipe to Brownsville in Wisconsin. Wind speeds average 18 mph (about 29 km/h) along this stretch.

The Niagara Escarpment is a prominent Wisconsin feature in Dodge County, southwest of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin; it is known there as &quot;The Ledge&quot; and is in Ledge County Park between Horicon and Mayville, Wisconsin. Some local organizations take their name from it, including The Ledgers, the sports teams at St. Mary&#x27;s Springs Academy, which is perched on the side of the escarpment.

Many resorts and ski areas in Ontario, Michigan, Wisconsin, and New York are along the escarpment.

==Vineyard land==
Niagara County, New York, near the eastern end of the escarpment, is the site of the Niagara Escarpment AVA (American Viticultural Area). Wines produced in this region include traditional grape varieties such as Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, and Riesling, and fruit wines.

Ontario&#x27;s Niagara Peninsula is the site of the largest wine-producing appellation (region) in Canada. Cool-climate varieties such as Riesling, Chardonnay, Gamay Noir, Pinot Noir, and Cabernet Franc are among the more than 30 varietals produced across . Three subappellations lie along the benchlands of the Niagara Escarpment: Short Hills Bench, Twenty Mile Bench, and Beamsville Bench.

Northeastern Wisconsin, at the western end of the escarpment, is the site of the Wisconsin Ledge AVA. Most of the region&#x27;s vineyards lie upon the escarpment&#x27;s eastern-facing slope that rises gently upward from the shores of Lake Michigan to the top of the Ledge, before dropping sharply off into Green Bay, and benefit greatly from constant air movement from Lake Michigan, which stores warmth during the summer. The presence of the lake produces a vacuum of sorts during the growing season: warm air over the lake rises, sucking colder air off the land and creating offshore breezes. Cold air cannot settle over the vineyards and a constant flow of warmer air makes the growing season here longer than in other parts of the state. The escarpment&#x27;s glacial soils are made up of gravel, sand, and clay over limestone bedrock. An aquifer provides mineral-rich ground water to the vines, encouraging deep root growth.

==World Biosphere Reserve==

In February 1990, the Niagara Escarpment was a designated World Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO, making it one of 12 in Canada. Development and land use on and adjacent to the escarpment is regulated by the Niagara Escarpment Commission, an agency of the Ontario government.

Cliffs along the scarp face have the oldest forest ecosystem in eastern North America. The oldest tree in Ontario is an eastern white cedar from 688 C.E. The oldest known tree in Wisconsin, a 1,300 year-old eastern white cedar, was found in Brown County.

<text>A transform fault or transform boundary, is a fault along a plate boundary where the motion is predominantly horizontal. It ends abruptly where it connects to another plate boundary, either another transform, a spreading ridge, or a subduction zone. A transform fault is a special case of a &quot;strike-slip fault&quot; that also forms a plate boundary.

Most such faults are found in oceanic crust, where they accommodate the lateral offset between segments of divergent boundaries, forming a zigzag pattern. This results from oblique seafloor spreading where the direction of motion is not perpendicular to the trend of the overall divergent boundary. A smaller number of such faults are found on land, although these are generally better-known, such as the San Andreas Fault and North Anatolian Fault.

==Nomenclature==
Transform boundaries are also known as conservative plate boundaries because they involve no addition or loss of lithosphere at the Earth&#x27;s surface.

== Background ==
Geophysicist and geologist John Tuzo Wilson recognized that the offsets of oceanic ridges by faults do not follow the classical pattern of an offset fence or geological marker in Reid&#x27;s rebound theory of faulting, from which the sense of slip is derived. The new class of faults, called transform faults, produce slip in the opposite direction from what one would surmise from the standard interpretation of an offset geological feature. Slip along transform faults does not increase the distance between the ridges it separates; the distance remains constant in earthquakes because the ridges are spreading centers. This hypothesis was confirmed in a study of the fault plane solutions that showed the slip on transform faults points in the opposite direction than classical interpretation would suggest.

==Difference between transform and transcurrent faults==
Transform faults are closely related to transcurrent faults and are commonly confused. Both types of fault are strike-slip or side-to-side in movement; nevertheless, transform faults always end at a junction with another plate boundary, while transcurrent faults may die out without a junction with another fault. Finally, transform faults form a tectonic plate boundary, while transcurrent faults do not.

==Mechanics==
Faults in general are focused areas of deformation or strain, which are the response of built-up stresses in the form of compression, tension, or shear stress in rock at the surface or deep in the Earth&#x27;s subsurface. Transform faults specifically accommodate lateral strain by transferring displacement between mid-ocean ridges or subduction zones. They also act as the plane of weakness, which may result in splitting in rift zones.

==Transform faults and divergent boundaries==
Transform faults are commonly found linking segments of divergent boundaries (mid-oceanic ridges or spreading centres). These mid-oceanic ridges are where new seafloor is constantly created through the upwelling of new basaltic magma. With new seafloor being pushed and pulled out, the older seafloor slowly slides away from the mid-oceanic ridges toward the continents. Although separated only by tens of kilometers, this separation between segments of the ridges causes portions of the seafloor to push past each other in opposing directions. This lateral movement of seafloors past each other is where transform faults are currently active. 
Transform faults move differently from a strike-slip fault at the mid-oceanic ridge. Instead of the ridges moving away from each other, as they do in other strike-slip faults, transform-fault ridges remain in the same, fixed locations, and the new ocean seafloor created at the ridges is pushed away from the ridge. Evidence of this motion can be found in paleomagnetic striping on the seafloor.

A paper written by geophysicist Taras Gerya theorizes that the creation of the transform faults between the ridges of the mid-oceanic ridge is attributed to rotated and stretched sections of the mid-oceanic ridge. This occurs over a long period of time with the spreading center or ridge slowly deforming from a straight line to a curved line. Finally, fracturing along these planes forms transform faults. As this takes place, the fault changes from a normal fault with extensional stress to a strike-slip fault with lateral stress. In the study done by Bonatti and Crane, peridotite and gabbro rocks were discovered in the edges of the transform ridges. These rocks are created deep inside the Earth&#x27;s mantle and then rapidly exhumed to the surface. This evidence helps to prove that new seafloor is being created at the mid-oceanic ridges and further supports the theory of plate tectonics.

Active transform faults are between two tectonic structures or faults. Fracture zones represent the previously active transform-fault lines, which have since passed the active transform zone and are being pushed toward the continents. These elevated ridges on the ocean floor can be traced for hundreds of miles and in some cases even from one continent across an ocean to the other continent.

==Types==
In his work on transform-fault systems, geologist Tuzo Wilson said that transform faults must be connected to other faults or tectonic-plate boundaries on both ends; because of that requirement, transform faults can grow in length, keep a constant length, or decrease in length. These length changes are dependent on which type of fault or tectonic structure connect with the transform fault. Wilson described six types of transform faults:

&quot;Growing length:&quot; In situations where a transform fault links a spreading center and the upper block of a subduction zone or where two upper blocks of subduction zones are linked, the transform fault itself will grow in length.

&quot;Constant length:&quot; In other cases, transform faults will remain at a constant length. This steadiness can be attributed to many different causes. In the case of ridge-to-ridge transforms, the constancy is caused by the continuous growth by both ridges outward, canceling any change in length. The opposite occurs when a ridge linked to a subducting plate, where all the lithosphere (new seafloor) being created by the ridge is subducted, or swallowed up, by the subduction zone. Finally, when two upper subduction plates are linked there is no change in length. This is due to the plates moving parallel with each other and no new lithosphere is being created to change that length.

Decreasing length faults: In rare cases, transform faults can shrink in length. These occur when two descending subduction plates are linked by a transform fault. In time as the plates are subducted, the transform fault will decrease in length until the transform fault disappears completely, leaving only two subduction zones facing in opposite directions.

== Examples ==

The most prominent examples of the mid-oceanic ridge transform zones are in the Atlantic Ocean between South America and Africa. Known as the St. Paul, Romanche, Chain, and Ascension fracture zones, these areas have deep, easily identifiable transform faults and ridges. Other locations include: the East Pacific Ridge located in the South Eastern Pacific Ocean, which meets up with San Andreas Fault to the North.

Transform faults are not limited to oceanic crust and spreading centers; many of them are on continental margins. The best example is the San Andreas Fault on the Pacific coast of the United States. The San Andreas Fault links the East Pacific Rise off the West coast of Mexico (Gulf of California) to the Mendocino triple junction (Part of the Juan de Fuca plate) off the coast of the Northwestern United States, making it a ridge-to-transform-style fault. The formation of the San Andreas Fault system occurred fairly recently during the Oligocene Period between 34 million and 24 million years ago. During this period, the Farallon plate, followed by the Pacific plate, collided into the North American plate. The collision led to the subduction of the Farallon plate underneath the North American plate. Once the spreading center separating the Pacific and the Farallon plates was subducted beneath the North American plate, the San Andreas Continental Transform-Fault system was created.
In New Zealand, the South Island&#x27;s Alpine Fault is a transform fault for much of its length. This has resulted in the folded land of the Southland Syncline being split into an eastern and western section several hundred kilometres apart. The majority of the syncline is found in Southland and The Catlins in the island&#x27;s southeast, but a smaller section is also present in the Tasman District in the island&#x27;s northwest.

Another example is the Húsavík‐Flatey fault. This oceanic transform fault is nearly completely submerged, but ~10 km is exposed in northern Iceland, near the town of Húsavík. There, it manifests as a series of half-grabens and sharp fault scarps. Since oceanic transform faults are often difficult to research because of their submerged nature, this fault represents a rare opportunity for research. Scientists inspected Holocene earthquake activity by looking cross sections of the fault, and found the approximate earthquake frequency in the region to be 600 ± 200 years. 

Other examples include:
* Middle East&#x27;s Dead Sea Transform Fault
* Pakistan&#x27;s Chaman Fault
* Turkey&#x27;s North Anatolian Fault
* North America&#x27;s Queen Charlotte Fault
* Myanmar&#x27;s Sagaing Fault

<text>The West Coast of the United States, also known as the Pacific Coast and the Western Seaboard, is the coastline along which the Western United States meets the North Pacific Ocean. The term typically refers to the contiguous U.S. states of California, Oregon, and Washington, but it occasionally includes Alaska and Hawaii in bureaucratic usage. For example, the U.S. Census Bureau considers both states to be part of a larger U.S. geographic division.

There are conflicting definitions of which states comprise the West Coast of the United States, but the West Coast always includes California, Oregon, and Washington as part of that definition. Under most circumstances, however, the term encompasses the three contiguous states and Alaska, as they are all located in North America. For census purposes, Hawaii is part of the West Coast, along with the other four states. &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; refers to the North American region as part of the Pacific Coast, including Alaska and British Columbia. Although the encyclopedia acknowledges the inclusion of Hawaii in some capacity as part of the region, the editors wrote that &quot;it has little in common geologically with the mainland states.&quot;

Several dictionaries offer different definitions of the West Coast. Lexico restricts the West Coast&#x27;s definition to &quot;the western seaboard of the U.S. from Washington to California.&quot; However, Macmillan Dictionary provides a less specific definition as &quot;the western coast of the U.S., along the Pacific Ocean.&quot; As for the Cambridge Dictionary, the West Coast is &quot;the area of the Pacific coast in the U.S. that includes California.&quot;

==History==

The history of the West Coast begins with the arrival of the earliest known humans of the Americas, Paleo-Indians, crossing the Bering Strait from Eurasia into North America over a land bridge, Beringia, that existed between 45,000 BCE and 12,000 BCE (47,000–14,000 years ago). Small isolated groups of hunter-gatherers migrated alongside herds of large herbivores far into Alaska. Between 16,500 BCE and 13,500 BCE (18,500–15,500 years ago), ice-free corridors developed along the Pacific coast and valleys of North America and possibly by sea.

Alaska Natives, Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, and California indigenous peoples eventually descended from the Paleo-Indians. They developed various languages and established trade routes.

Later, Spanish, British, French, Russian, and American explorers and settlers began colonizing the area.

On May 10, 1869, the first transcontinental railroad was completed joining the West Coast to the East of the United States.

==Climate==

The West Coast of the United States has an oceanic climate in its Northwestern, Northern, and Eastern edge towards the U.S.-Canada border, but from Northern California, towards the U.S.-Mexico border the climate is Mediterranean. While the northern half of the west coast, particularly coastal Washington and Oregon has moderate rainfall, particularly during the winter months, much of coastal California is drier year-round.

The coastline sees significantly milder temperatures compared to inland areas during summer. In far Northern California there is a difference of 17 °C (30 °F) between Eureka and Willow Creek in spite of only 25 miles (40 km) separating the locations and Willow Creek being located at a elevation. Slightly narrower fluctuations can be seen all through the coastline, and could partially be explained by the cold currents in the Pacific Ocean moderating coastal temperatures and the mountain ranges blocking the maritime air from moving farther inland than its foothills during summer. 

Coastal fog is also prevalent in keeping shoreline temperatures cool. While famous in the San Francisco Bay Area, coastal fog also affects Santa Monica in Los Angeles, Southern California, leading to May gray and June gloom conditions. Coastal California has very little yearly temperature differences with cool summers similar to those expected in parts of Northern Europe in San Francisco but warmer temperatures year-round further south. A short journey inland and summer temperatures are comparable with the rest of the United States on the same latitudes, sometimes warmer due to prevailing winds from the Nevada and Arizona hot desert climate.

==Government and politics==
With the exception of Alaska, the Democratic Party has dominated West Coast politics in contemporary history, with the states consistently voting for Democrats in elections at various levels. Four out of five West Coast states have voted for Democrats in presidential elections since 1992, three of which have done so since 1988.

===Ideology and party strength===
In politics, the West Coast usually refers to the contiguous coastal states of California, Oregon, and Washington because of their similar political leanings. In 2017, &quot;The Oregonian&quot; columnist David Sarasohn described the West Coast as a &quot;blue wall&quot; of shared values on immigration, abortion, climate change, and civil liberties. By 2016, the West Coast states legalized marijuana after California voted to do so. According to a 2019 Pew Research Center poll, 72% of adults in Pacific states said that &quot;climate change is affecting their local community at least some&quot;, higher than in any other region in the country.

Since 1992, the three states have voted for Democrats in presidential elections without interruption, but Oregon and Washington also voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in 1988. 

In the 2010s, Democrats strengthened their political power along the West Coast. After winning a special election for a seat in the Washington state senate in 2017, Democrats built a government trifecta in all three West Coast states. After the 2022 U.S. House of Representatives elections, Democrats controlled all congressional districts touching the Pacific.

Hawaii is not usually considered part of the West Coast in the political definition, though it is considered a Democratic stronghold. Before achieving statehood in 1959, Hawaii became a state favorable to Democrats to the point that they sought statehood for the territory. Southern Democrats opposed the move because it would mean additional votes against their region on several issues. Since achieving statehood, Hawaii consistently voted for Democrats in presidential elections, except in 1972 and 1984.

Unlike the other West Coast states, Alaska has been a reliable state for Republicans in presidential elections. Since achieving statehood, Alaska has voted for the Democratic presidential candidate only once in 1964. In 1960, the state narrowly voted for Republican Richard Nixon over Democrat John F. Kennedy and had voted for Republicans uninterrupted since 1968.
All five West Coast states united in voting for Johnson in his 1964 landslide, while in 1972 and 1984, this occurred again as Nixon and Reagan got support from all 5.

==Demographics==
According to the results of the 2020 United States Census, 16 of the 20 largest cities on the West Coast exist in California. Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Jose, all among the top 10 most populous cities in the country, lead the West Coast in population with more than a million people in each city, with Los Angeles being nearly three times the size of San Diego&#x27;s population. Behind these three cities, San Francisco, Seattle and Portland are respectively fourth, fifth and sixth in population. Hawaii&#x27;s capital and largest city, Honolulu, is the 13th largest city, and Alaska&#x27;s largest city, Anchorage, is 17th on the West Coast.

==Culture==
California&#x27;s history first as a major Spanish colony, and later Mexican territory, has given the lower West Coast a distinctive Hispanic American tone, which it also shares with the rest of the Southwest. Similarly, two of the three cities in which Asian Americans have concentrated, San Francisco and Los Angeles, are located on the West Coast, with significant populations in other West Coast cities. San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown, the oldest in North America, is a noted cultural center.

The West Coast also has a proportionally large share of green cities within the United States, which manifests itself in different cultural practices such as bicycling and organic gardening.

Greater Los Angeles, in particular, has immense global influence due to the presence of the Hollywood film industry, and is considered the creative capital of the world due to the proportion of its population involved in the entertainment industry. Meanwhile, parts of the San Francisco Bay Area are also known as Silicon Valley, due to the tremendous presence of software companies in the area, including tech giants like Apple, Meta, and Alphabet Inc.

In the Pacific Northwest, Portland and Seattle are both considered among the coffee capitals of the world. While Starbucks originated in Seattle, both cities are known for small-scale coffee roasters and independent coffeeshops. The culture has also been significantly shaped by the environment, especially by its forests, mountains, and rain. This may account for the fact that the Northwest has many high-quality libraries and bookshops (most notably Powell&#x27;s Books and the Seattle Central Library) and a &quot;bibliophile soul&quot;. The region also has a marginal, but growing independence movement based on bioregionalism and a Cascadian identity. The Cascadian flag has become a popular image at Seattle Sounders FC and Portland Timbers games.

Alaska is widely known for its outdoors and its inhabitants engage in a range of activities that are unique to the state. Some of these activities can be experienced through the state&#x27;s annual events, such as the Iron Dog snowmobile race from Anchorage to Nome and on to Fairbanks. Other events include the World Ice Art Championships (Fairbanks) and the Sitka Whalefest (Sitka).

==Transportation==

The &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; is the main interstate passenger railroad route provided by Amtrak along the coast. BNSF Railway and the Union Pacific Railroad own and operate railroads that connect cities on the coast. Interstate travel is also served by roads such as Interstate 5, the main high-speed north–south freeway along the West Coast. 

Interstate 5 follows the coast only as far north as Dana Point, California, before turning inland for much of its route. The main coastal scenic route throughout most of California is California State Route 1. From the end of SR 1 at Leggett, California, U.S. Route 101 serves as the main scenic route along the coast in far Northern California, Oregon, and Washington state. Sierra High Route is a popular trekking route.

Several of the most important international airports in the United States are located along the West Coast, including Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, San Francisco International Airport, and Los Angeles International Airport. Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles all connect numerous destinations around the Pacific Ocean to points throughout North America, and are often described as gateways to the Pacific Rim.

<text>Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., 240 U.S. 1 (1916), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld the validity of a tax statute called the Revenue Act of 1913, also known as the Tariff Act, Ch. 16, 38 Stat. 166 (October 3, 1913), enacted pursuant to Article I, section 8, clause 1 of, and the Sixteenth Amendment to, the United States Constitution, allowing a federal income tax. The Sixteenth Amendment had been ratified earlier in 1913. The Revenue Act of 1913 imposed income taxes that were not apportioned among the states according to each state&#x27;s population.

==Background==

Prior to 1895, all income taxes had been considered indirect taxes (not required to be apportioned among the states according to the population of each state). In the controversial 1895 case of &quot;Pollock v. Farmers&#x27; Loan &amp; Trust Co.&quot;, however, the Court had overturned longstanding precedent and ruled that while a tax on income from labor was an excise, or indirect tax (which was not required to be apportioned), a tax on &quot;income derived from property&quot; such as interest, dividends, or rents was or should be treated as a direct tax.

==Facts in the Brushaber case==

The plaintiff in this case, Frank R. Brushaber, was a shareholder in the defendant Union Pacific Railroad company. The Sixteenth Amendment had recently been passed, and the U.S. Congress had enacted legislation pursuant to the amendment assessing taxes to the wealthiest of income earners, including the railroad company in this case. Brushaber brought a lawsuit against the railroad company for an injunction to stop the company from paying the tax. Brushaber&#x27;s contention was that statute enacting the tax violated the Fifth Amendment&#x27;s prohibition on the government taking property without due process of law and that the statute also violated due process by exempting certain kinds of income. He also argued because the tax was not apportioned among the states according to population, it was unconstitutional. The U.S. government filed a brief supporting the validity of the tax.

==Holdings==

In an 8–0 decision (Justice James Clark McReynolds did not participate in the decision), the Court held, in an opinion written by Chief Justice Edward Douglass White, that the Sixteenth Amendment removes the requirement that income taxes be apportioned among the states according to population (Article I, Section 9, clause 4 of the U.S. Constitution). The Revenue Act of 1913, imposing income taxes that are not apportioned among the states according to each state&#x27;s population, is constitutional. The Court stated: &quot;...there can be no dispute that there was power by virtue of the Amendment during that period to levy the tax, without apportionment, and so far as the limitations of the Constitution in other respects are concerned, the contention is not open...&quot;

The Court also held that the Revenue Act does not violate the Fifth Amendment&#x27;s prohibition against the government taking property without due process of law. The Court stated: &quot;So far as the due process clause of the 5th Amendment is relied upon [by Mr. Frank Brushaber], it suffices to say that there is no basis for such reliance, since it is equally well settled that such clause is not a limitation upon the taxing power conferred upon Congress by the Constitution...&quot;

The Court further held that the Revenue Act does not violate the uniformity clause of Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution. The Court stated: &quot;So far as these numerous and minute, not to say in many respects hypercritical, contentions [by Mr. Frank Brushaber] are based upon an assumed violation of the uniformity clause, their want of legal merit is at once apparent, since it is settled that that clause exacts only a geographical uniformity, and there is not a semblance of ground in any of the propositions [by Mr. Brushaber] for assuming that a violation of such uniformity is complained of.&quot;

==Discussion==

In &quot;Brushaber&quot; the Court noted that even before the Sixteenth Amendment was passed, the Congress had authority to tax income. If a particular income tax was a direct tax or was &quot;treated&quot; as a direct tax in the constitutional sense, that tax could be imposed (after &quot;Pollock&quot; but before the passage of the Amendment) only by apportionment among the states, according to their census populations.

In &quot;Brushaber&quot;, the Court held that the Sixteenth Amendment eliminated the requirement of apportionment as it relates to &quot;taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived.&quot;

==Subsequent interpretation==

Tax law professor Boris Bittker and his co-authors have stated:

As construed by the Supreme Court in the &quot;Brushaber&quot; case, the power of Congress to tax income derives from Article I, Section 8, Clause 1, of the original Constitution rather than from the Sixteenth Amendment; the latter simply eliminated the requirement (Article I, section 9, clause 4 of the US Constitution) that an income tax, to the extent that it is a direct tax, must be apportioned among the states.

No income tax enacted by the US Congress (either before or after the Sixteenth Amendment) has ever been apportioned among the states by population. All income taxes enacted after the Amendment have been treated as excises (they have been imposed with geographic uniformity but have not been required to be apportioned).

Since the income tax may be imposed on income from whatever source and without regard to any apportionment requirement (by virtue of the wording of the 16th Amendment), an income tax cannot be treated as a direct tax (as income taxes on income from property were so treated in the &quot;Pollock&quot; case). Essentially, all income taxes after the Sixteenth Amendment are again treated as indirect taxes. Subsequent lower court cases have interpreted the &quot;Brushaber&quot; decision (&quot;the confusion is not inherent, but rather arises from the conclusion ... this erroneous assumption&quot;) and the Sixteenth Amendment as standing for the rule that the Amendment allows a direct tax on &quot;wages, salaries, commissions, etc. without apportionment.&quot;

==Geographical uniformity==

The Court in &quot;Brushaber&quot; noted that income taxes inherently belonged in the &quot;category&quot; of indirect tax (or excise). The court stated that incomes taxes are indirect excise taxes by reinforcing the &quot;Pollock&quot; decision:

As this conclusion but enforced a regulation as to the mode of exercising power under particular circumstances, it did not in any way dispute the all-embracing taxing authority possessed by Congress, including necessarily therein the power to impose income taxes if only they conformed to the constitutional regulations which were applicable to them. Moreover, in addition, the conclusion reached in the Pollock Case did not in any degree involve holding that income taxes generically and necessarily came within the class of direct taxes on property, but, on the contrary, recognized the fact that taxation on income was in its nature an excise...

Indeed, that had been the understanding with respect to all income taxes until the &quot;Pollock&quot; decision. The Sixteenth Amendment removed the need imposed by the &quot;Pollock&quot; decision to determine whether an income tax in any particular case was required to be apportioned, as the Congress could again (after 1913) tax income from any source without having to apportion the tax according to population.

==Property taxes and capitations==

Nothing in the Sixteenth Amendment or in &quot;Brushaber&quot; (and the other cases interpreting the tax provisions of the U.S. Constitution) changes the general rule that direct taxes are still required to be apportioned among the states by population. For example, if the US Congress were to enact a national property tax (a property tax or other tax &quot;by reason of its ownership&quot;) or a national capitation (a poll tax or head tax), such taxes would be required to be apportioned.

<doc id="174593" wikidata="Q848929" url="?curid=174593" title="Socinianism">
<text>Socinianism ( ) is a Nontrinitarian Christian belief system developed and co-founded during the Protestant Reformation by the Italian Renaissance humanists and theologians Lelio Sozzini (&quot;Laelius Socinus&quot;) and Fausto Sozzini (&quot;Faustus Socinus&quot;), uncle and nephew, respectively.

It was developed among the Polish Brethren in the Polish Reformed Church between the 16th and 17th centuries, and embraced by the Unitarian Church of Transylvania during the same period. Socinianism is most famous for its Nontrinitarian Christian beliefs about the nature of God and the human nature of Jesus but contains a number of other distinctive theological doctrines, such as the denial of divine foreknowledge regarding the actions of free agents and rejection of the pre-existence of Christ.

==Origins==
The beliefs of Socinianism date from the wing of the Protestant Reformation known as the Radical Reformation and have their root in the Italian Anabaptist movement of the 1540s, such as the anti-trinitarian Council of Venice in 1550. Lelio Sozzini was the first of the Italian anti-trinitarians to go beyond Arian beliefs in print and deny the pre-existence of Christ in his &quot;Brevis explicatio in primum Johannis caput&quot; – a commentary on the meaning of the Logos in John 1:1–15 (1562). Lelio Sozzini considered that the &quot;beginning&quot; of was the same as and referred to the new creation, not the Genesis creation. His nephew Fausto Sozzini published his own longer &quot;Brevis explicatio&quot; later, developing his uncle&#x27;s arguments. Many years after the death of his uncle in Switzerland, Fausto Sozzini was consulted by the Unitarian Church in Transylvania, attempting to mediate in the dispute between Giorgio Biandrata and Ferenc Dávid.

He moved to Poland, where he married the daughter of a leading member of the Polish Brethren, the anti-trinitarian minority, or &quot;ecclesia minor&quot;. In 1565, it had split from the Calvinist Reformed Church in Poland. Sozzini never joined the &quot;ecclesia minor&quot;, but he was influential in reconciling several controversies among the Brethren: on conscientious objection, on prayer to Christ, and on the virgin birth. Fausto persuaded many in the Polish Brethren who were formerly Arian, such as Marcin Czechowic, to adopt his uncle Lelio&#x27;s views.

Fausto Sozzini furthered his influence through his Racovian Catechism, published posthumously, which set out his uncle Lelio&#x27;s views on Christology and replaced earlier catechisms of the &quot;Ecclesia Minor&quot;. His influence continued after his death through the writings of his students published in Polish and Latin from the press of the Racovian Academy at Raków, Kielce County.

The term &quot;Socinian&quot; started to be used in the Dutch Republic and the Kingdom of England from the 1610s onward, as the Latin publications were circulated among early Arminians, Remonstrants, Dissenters, and early English Unitarians. In the late 1660s, Fausto Sozzini&#x27;s grandson Andreas Wiszowaty and great-grandson Benedykt Wiszowaty published the nine-volume &quot;Biblioteca Fratrum Polonorum quos Unitarios vocant&quot; (1668) in Amsterdam, along with the works of F. Sozzini, the Austrian Johann Ludwig von Wolzogen, and the Poles Johannes Crellius, Jonasz Szlichtyng, and Samuel Przypkowski. These books circulated among English and French thinkers, including Isaac Newton, John Locke, Voltaire, and Pierre Bayle.

In Great Britain and North America, Socinianism later became a catch-all term for any kind of dissenting belief. Sources in the 18th and 19th centuries frequently attributed the term &quot;Socinian&quot; anachronistically, using it to refer to ideas that embraced a much wider range than the narrowly defined position of the Racovian catechisms and library.

==Beliefs==
Socinian theology, as summarised in the Racovian Catechism, rejected the views of orthodox Christian theology on God&#x27;s knowledge, on the doctrine of the Trinity and the divinity of Christ, and on soteriology.

===Christology===

The Racovian publications, like the Sozzinis, rejected the pre-existence of Christ and held that Jesus did not exist until he was conceived as a human being. This view had been put forward before by the 4th-century bishop Photinus, but it conflicts with the mainline Protestant, Eastern Orthodox, and Catholic views, which hold that the Logos referred to in the Gospel of John was Jesus.

===Human nature===

The Socinians held that humans were created mortal in the beginning and would have died naturally whether Adam and Eve had eaten from the tree or not. They also rejected the doctrine of original sin.

===Atonement===
Socinianism also rejected the propitiatory view of atonement.

===Predestination and omniscience===
The Socinians believed that God&#x27;s omniscience was limited to what was a necessary truth in the future (what would &quot;definitely&quot; happen) and did not apply to what was a contingent truth (what &quot;might&quot; happen). They believed that, if God knew every possible future, human free will was impossible and as such rejected the &quot;hard&quot; view of omniscience. Modern process theology and open theism advance a similar viewpoint.

==Skepticism==
Later writers such as Archibald Alexander Hodge (1823–1886) asserted that Socinian theology was rooted in skepticism. However, the original Polish Socinians were believers in miracles and the virgin birth, although there were a few radicals, such as Symon Budny and Jacobus Palaeologus, who denied these.

==Conscientious objection==
Although not directly a doctrinal belief, the principle of conscientious objection and the obedient relation of the believer to the state became a distinct position of Socinianism as it was formalized in the Racovian publications. Before F. Sozzini&#x27;s arrival in Poland, there had been a wide range of positions from the total otherworldliness, common property, and withdrawal from the state of Marcin Czechowic of Lublin through to the advocacy of military service by Symon Budny. The next generation of Polish Brethren stabilized between these two positions, carrying wooden swords to follow the letter of the law and allowing senior Socinians such as Hieronim Moskorzowski to vote in the Sejm.

==Offshoots==
The direct doctrinal descendants of the original Socinians are the Unitarian Christians of Transylvania and England. Although the Polish Brethren never adopted the name &quot;Unitarian&quot; while in Poland, when they were disbanded in 1658, those who fled to Holland eventually embraced the term &quot;Unitarian&quot; (which they got from the Transylvanians), as they preferred not to be called Socinians. The term had been used by the Unitarian Church of Transylvania as early as 1600. Socinian theology continued in Transylvania, where Polish exiles such as Andrzej Wiszowaty Jr., taught in the Unitarian College (1726–1740), as evidenced in the &quot;Summa Universae Theologiae Christianae secundum Unitarios&quot; of Mihály Lombard de Szentábrahám, recognized as the statement of faith of the Unitarian Church of Transylvania by Emperor Joseph II in 1782. Early English Unitarians such as Henry Hedworth and John Biddle retroactively applied the term &quot;Unitarian&quot; to the Polish Brethren. By 1676 there were at least three Socinian meeting houses in London, even if the Act of Toleration of 1689 saw Socinians and Catholics excluded from official recognition. Socinian ideas continued to have significant influence on Unitarians in England throughout the entire period of their development.

Modern Socinians (in Christological terms) include the small number of &quot;Biblical Unitarian&quot; churches such as the Christadelphians, the Church of God General Conference and the Church of the Blessed Hope, though these churches are not direct descendants of the Polish Brethren.

===Related beliefs===
At the time of Fausto Sozzini, Symon Budny held a variant of unitarianism including denial of the virgin birth of Jesus and arguing that Jesus was the son of Joseph, for which he was excluded from the Racovian community.

<text>Tamworth is a city and administrative centre of the north-eastern region of New South Wales, Australia. Situated on the Peel River within the local government area of the Tamworth Regional Council, it is the largest and most populated city in the region, with a population of 43,874 in 2021, making it the third largest inland city in New South Wales (after Wagga Wagga and Albury). Tamworth is from the Queensland border and is located almost midway between Brisbane and Sydney.

The city is known as the &quot;First Town of Lights&quot;, being the first place in Australia to use electric street lights in 1888. Tamworth is also famous as the &quot;Country Music Capital of Australia&quot; and &quot;Australia&#x27;s answer to Nashville&quot;, annually hosting the Tamworth Country Music Festival in late January; the second-biggest country music festival in the world after Nashville. The city is recognised as the National Equine Capital of Australia because of the high number of equine events held in the city and the construction of the world-class Australian Equine and Livestock Events Centre, the biggest of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere.

==History==
The Kamilaroi or Gamilaroi (&#x27;G&#x27; and &#x27;K&#x27; can be pronounced the same) people, from whose language comes the word &quot;budgerigar&quot;, inhabited the area before European contact. In 1818, John Oxley passed through the Peel Valley and commented, &quot;it would be impossible to find a finer or more luxuriant country than its waters...No place in this world can afford more advantages to the industrious settler than this extensive vale&quot;.
In 1831, the first sheep stations and cattle stations were formed, and in the same year, the Australian Agricultural Company was granted a lease of of land at Goonoo Goonoo, south of the present location of Tamworth, extending to present-day Calala.

In the 1830s, a company town began to develop on the Peel&#x27;s southwest bank, the present site of West Tamworth. In 1850, a public town was gazetted on the opposite side of the river from the existing settlement. This town became the main town, called &quot;Tamworth&quot; after Tamworth, Staffordshire, represented at the time in parliament by Robert Peel. The town prospered, and was reached by the railway in 1878. The first streetlights used in Australia were commercially owned in Waratah Tasmania in 1886, but on 9 November 1888, Tamworth became the first location in Australia to have electric street lighting powered by a municipally owned power station, giving the town the title of &quot;First Town of Light&quot;.

===Gaol history===
The first record of correctional facilities being established in Tamworth was on 17 December 1864 when the local Police Magistrate was appointed as the Visiting Justice at the Tamworth Gaol. A gaoler and sheriff were appointed in 1868. At the commencement of 1920, there were 11 prisoners detained. During that year, 201 prisoners were received with 183 discharged leaving 29 in prison by 31 December 1920. Almost 20 per cent of the prisoners were aged under 21 years. The Tamworth Gaol ceased to exist on 25 March 1943, and this was ratified by a proclamation from 8 April 1943.

Prior to its opening as an adult male correctional centre in 1991, the facility (known variously as the Tamworth Institution for Boys, the Tamworth Boys&#x27; Home, and Endeavour House) was a male juvenile justice centre that pre–dated the establishment of the Kariong Youth Correctional Centre which opened in September 1991.

<text>The Río Cuarto craters are a purported group of impact craters located in Córdoba Province, Argentina. Research published in 2002 indicates that they are more likely a result of aeolian processes.

== Discovery ==
In 1990, Captain Ruben Lianza of the Argentine Air Force, an amateur astronomer, provided a report to an astronomy publication that included aerial pictures of a set of odd teardrop-shaped depressions near the city of Río Cuarto, Córdoba in north-central Argentina. The depressions seemed very similar to the sets of craters produced in laboratory simulations of impacts taking place at low angles. Such features exist on the Moon, Mars, and Venus, but had not been seen on Earth up to that time.

The depressions had long been known to Argentine geologists, but until Lianza, nobody had seriously investigated them. Samples of materials obtained from the depressions indicated the presence of shocked materials, as well as pebbles that were clearly of meteoritic origin . A team of American researchers went to Argentina to investigate, collaborating with Captain Lianza and Argentine academics to study the strange depressions.

There were ten depressions, four of them of substantial size. One depression, named the &quot;Drop&quot;, was about wide and long. Two more large depressions, the &quot;Eastern Twin&quot; and &quot;Western Twin&quot;, both about wide and long, were located northeast. Another major depression, the &quot;Northern Basin&quot;, about half and again as big as one of the Twins, was sited 11 kilometers further to the northeast. The long axes of the depressions all point to the northeast.

== Impact origin theory ==
The depressions were thought to be due to a grazing impact of a set of objects at a very low angle, which calculations show to be a rare occurrence. Most impacts will strike at an angle of 45 degrees to the horizontal or greater, and the impact craters will always be close to circular, since the shock wave that results from the impact propagates symmetrically.

A grazing impact, however, will form an elliptical crater, with sprays of debris that look like butterfly wings. This has been confirmed by high-velocity guns used for impact experiments, and more recently by computer simulations. On impact, the object may shed chunks of itself that fly further downrange to perform secondary impacts.

Based upon physical and numerical modeling, proponents of the Río Cuarto event suggest that the object struck at an angle of no more than 15 degrees from the horizontal, with the impact itself having 10 times more explosive energy than the Barringer Crater event and 30 times more than the Tunguska event. Although the age of the depressions has not yet been determined precisely, it is believed by some researchers they are about 10,000 years old, placing them at the start of the Holocene, though the EID gives a broader age of less than 100,000 years old.

== Aeolian origin theory ==
Satellite surveys of the area have found more than 400 similar oval features in the area, and studies of the layers of rock show no evidence of raised rims. These studies point to the oval features as being dune formations, aligned to the prevailing northeast wind.

There is no doubt that there is impact material in the form of glassy impactite and shocked quartz in the Río Cuarto structures. The age of this material has been questioned, and estimated to more than 500,000 BP, from an unknown source crater. There may have been a second, more recent event at around 10,000 BP which produced a second layer of impactite glass.

<text>Demonology is the study of demons within religious belief and myth. Depending on context, it can refer to studies within theology, religious doctrine, or occultism. In many faiths, it concerns the study of a hierarchy of demons. Demons may be nonhuman separable souls, or discarnate spirits which have never inhabited a body. A sharp distinction is often drawn between these two classes, notably by the Melanesians, several African groups, and others. The Islamic jinn, for example, are not reducible to modified human souls. At the same time these classes are frequently conceived as producing identical results, e.g. diseases.

== Prevalence of demons ==
According to some religions, all the affairs of the universe are supposed to be under the control of spirits, each ruling a certain &quot;element&quot; or even object, and themselves in subjection to a greater spirit. For example, the Inuit are said to believe in spirits of the sea, earth and sky, the winds, the clouds, and everything in nature. Every cove of the seashore, every point, every island and prominent rock has its guardian spirit. Some are potentially of the malignant type, to be propitiated by an appeal to knowledge of the supernatural. Traditional Korean belief posits that countless demons inhabit the natural world; they fill household objects and are present in all locations. By the thousands, they accompany travellers, seeking them out from their places in the elements.

Greek philosophers such as Porphyry of Tyre (who claimed influence from Platonism), as well as the fathers of the Christian Church, held that the world was pervaded with spirits, the latter of whom advanced the belief that demons received the worship directed at pagan gods.

==Characterization of spirits==
Not all spirits across all cultures are considered malevolent. In Central Africa, the Mpongwe believe in local spirits, just as the Inuit do; but they are regarded as inoffensive in the main. Passers-by must make some nominal offering as they near the spirits&#x27; residence. The occasional mischievous act, such as the throwing down of a tree on a passer-by, is believed by the natives to be perpetuated by the class of spirits known as &quot;Ombuiri&quot;.

Many spirits, especially those regarding natural processes, are often considered neutral or benevolent; ancient European peasant fears of the corn-spirit would crop up during irritation, as a result of the farmer infringing on the domain of said spirit, and taking his property by cutting the corn; similarly, there is no reason why the less significant pantheon should be regarded as malevolent, and historical evidence has shown that the Petara of the Dyaks are viewed as invisible guardians of mankind rather than hostile malefactors.

==Types==

Demons are generally classified as spirits which are believed to enter into relations with the human race. As such the term includes:
# angels in the Christian tradition that fell from grace,
# malevolent genii or familiars,
# such as receive a cult (e.g., ancestor worship),
# ghosts or other malevolent revenants.

Excluded are souls conceived as inhabiting another world. Yet just as gods are not necessarily spiritual, demons may also be regarded as corporeal; vampires for example are sometimes described as human heads with appended entrails, which issue from the tomb to attack the living during the night watches. The incubi and succubi of the Middle Ages are sometimes regarded as spiritual beings; but they were held to give proof of their bodily existence, such as offspring (though often deformed). Belief in demons goes back many millennia. The Zoroastrian faith teaches that there are 3,333 Demons, some with specific dark responsibilities such as war, starvation, sickness, etc.

===Ancient Mesopotamian religion===


The ancient Mesopotamians believed that the underworld (Kur) was home to many demons, which are sometimes referred to as &quot;offspring of &quot;arali&quot;&quot;. These demons could sometimes leave the underworld and terrorize mortals on earth. One class of demons that were believed to reside in the underworld were known as &quot;galla&quot;; their primary purpose appears to have been to drag unfortunate mortals back to Kur. They are frequently referenced in magical texts, and some texts describe them as being seven in number. Several extant poems describe the &quot;galla&quot; dragging the god Dumuzid into the underworld. Like other demons, however, &quot;galla&quot; could also be benevolent and, in a hymn from King Gudea of Lagash ( 2144 – 2124 BC), a minor god named Ig-alima is described as &quot;the great &quot;galla&quot; of Girsu&quot;. Demons had no cult in Mesopotamian religious practice since demons &quot;know no food, know no drink, eat no flour offering and drink no libation.&quot;

===Abrahamic religions===

====Judaism====
Judaism does not have a demonology or any set of doctrines about demons.
Use of the name &quot;Lucifer&quot; stems from , a passage which does speak of the defeat of a particular Babylonian King, to whom it gives a title which refers to what in English is called the Day Star or Morning Star (in Latin, &quot;lucifer&quot;, meaning &quot;light-bearer&quot;, from the words &quot;lucem ferre&quot;).

There is more than one instance in Jewish medieval myth and lore where demons are said to have come to be, as seen by the Grigori angels, of Lilith leaving Adam, of demons such as vampires, unrest spirits in Jewish folklore such as the dybbuk.

====Christianity====


Christian demonology is the study of demons from a Christian point of view. It is primarily based on the Bible (Old Testament and New Testament), the exegesis of scriptures, the writings of early Christian philosophers and hermits, tradition, and legends incorporated from other beliefs.

Some scholars suggest that the origins of early Greek Old Testament demonology can be traced to two distinctive and often competing mythologies of evil— Adamic and Enochic.

The first tradition — the Adamic tradition — ties demons to the fall of man caused by the serpent who beguiled Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Thus, the Adamic story traces the source of evil to Satan&#x27;s transgression and the fall of man, a trend reflected in the Books of Adam and Eve which explains the reason for Satan&#x27;s demotion by his refusal to worship and submit to God.

The other tradition — the early Enochic tradition — ties demons to the fall of angels in the antediluvian period. This tradition bases its understanding of the origin of demons on the story of the fallen Watchers led by Azazel. Scholars believe these two enigmatic figures—Azazel and Satan—exercised formative influence on early Jewish demonology. While in the beginning of their conceptual journeys Azazel and Satan are posited as representatives of two distinctive and often rival trends tied to the distinctive etiologies of corruption, in later Jewish and Christian demonological lore both antagonists are able to enter each other&#x27;s respective stories in new conceptual capacities. In these later traditions Satanael is often depicted as the leader of the fallen angels while his conceptual rival Azazel is portrayed as a seducer of Adam and Eve. While historical Judaism never recognized any set of doctrines about demons, scholars believe its post-exilic concepts of eschatology, angelology, and demonology were influenced by Zoroastrianism. Some, however, believe these concepts were received as part of the Kabbalistic tradition. While many people believe today Lucifer and Satan are different names for the same being, not all scholars subscribe to this view.

A number of authors throughout Christian history have written about demons for a variety of purposes. Theologians like Thomas Aquinas wrote concerning the behaviors of which Christians should be aware, while witch hunters like Heinrich Kramer wrote about how to find and what to do with people they believed were involved with demons. Some texts such as the Lesser Key of Solomon or The Grimoire of Pope Honorius (although these, the earliest manuscripts, were from well after these individuals had died) are written with instructions on how to summon demons in the name of God and often were claimed to have been written by individuals respected within the Church. These latter texts were usually more detailed, giving names, ranks, and descriptions of demons individually and categorically. Most Christians commonly reject these texts as either diabolical or fictitious. Catholics accused Lutherans of believing in diabolatry or that the devil had unlimited powers.

In modern times, some demonological texts have been written by Christians, usually in a similar vein of Thomas Aquinas, explaining their effects in the world and how faith may lessen or eliminate damage by them. A few Christian authors, such as Jack Chick and John Todd, write with intentions similar to Kramer, proclaiming that demons and their human agents are active in the world. These claims can stray from mainstream ideology, and may include such beliefs as that Christian rock is a means through which demons influence people.

Not all Christians believe that demons exist in the literal sense. Some believe that the New Testament&#x27;s exorcism language was originally part of curing ceremonies for what we now recognize as epilepsy, mental illness, etc.

====Islam====

Many demonic or demon-like entities are not purely spiritual, but physical in nature and related to animals. Julius Wellhausen states, that Islamic &quot;demonology&quot; is always zoology as well. One prominent classification is given by al-Jahiz, who classifies jinn as:
* &quot;&quot;, jinn who live among humans.
*Angels, benevolent and good jinn&quot;.&quot;
* Devils, malicious and evil jinn.
* &quot;Marid&quot;, strong jinn who steal information from Heaven.
*&quot;Ifrit&quot;, the most powerful jinn.

Zakariya al-Qazwini&#x27;s &quot;Aja&#x27;ib al-Makhluqat&quot; mentions seven types of animals. The &quot;jinn&quot; are classified as an animal composed of fire and can appear in many forms. Among them, the angels are created from the light of fire, the jinn from a blaze of fire, and the devils from the smoke of fire. Satan is counted among these animals. They inhabited the earth before mankind.

The German orientalist Almut Wieland-Karimi classified the Jinn in the ten most common categories mentioned in folklore literature:

* Jinn or Jann: ordinary jinn, a class apart from other jinn types, but also used as a collective to refer to invisible beings in general
* Shaitan: Malevolent jinni, who causes illness and madness
* Ifrit: delimitation to ordinary jinn remains unclear. Can be either a powerful cunning Jinn or a strong Shaitan. Ifrits are generally bad.
* Marid: a haughty and powerful Shaitan or very malevolent Ifrit.
* Bu&#x27;bu: a jinn that frightens children.
* Si&#x27;lah: a female demon who seduces men.
* : spirits dwelling in houses.
* Ghul: generally evil, lives in the desert.
* Qarînah: name for a specific demon or doppelgänger, a type of spirit that follows every human.
* Hatif: a mysterious phenomenon, which can only be heard but never seen.

===Buddhism===
Traditionally, Buddhism affirms the existence of hells populated by demons who torment sinners and tempt mortals to sin, or who seek to thwart their enlightenment, with a demon named Mara as chief tempter, &quot;prince of darkness&quot;, or &quot;Evil One&quot; in Sanskrit sources.

The followers of Mara were also called &quot;mara&quot;, the devils, and are frequently cited as a cause of disease or representations of mental obstructions.
The &quot;mara&quot; became fully assimilated into the Chinese worldview, and were called &quot;mo&quot;.

The idea of the imminent decline and collapse of the Buddhist religion amid a &quot;great cacophony of demonic influences&quot; was already a significant component of Buddhism when it reached China in the first century A.D., according to Michel Strickmann. Demonic forces had attained enormous power in the world. For some writers of the time, this state of affairs had been ordained to serve the higher purpose of effecting a &quot;preliminary cleansing&quot; that would purge and purify humanity in preparation for an ultimate, messianic renewal.

Medieval Chinese Buddhist demonology was heavily influenced by Indian Buddhism. Indian demonology is also fully and systematically described in written sources, though during Buddhism&#x27;s centuries of direct influence in China, &quot;Chinese demonology was whipped into respectable shape,&quot; with a number of Indian demons finding permanent niches even in Taoist ritual texts. In the Kṣitigarbha Sūtra it states that heaven and hell change as the world changes and that many new hells with different demons can be created to fit the different ways that the human realm changes.

Chinese Buddhism also influenced Taoism with beliefs of hell and the Taoists eventually came up with their own demonology lore which in turn created folk beliefs about spirits in hell which was a combination of beliefs from the two religions. However, the demons in hell are viewed differently than Abrahamic faiths who instead of being pure evil are more of guards of hell although they are still viewed as malicious beings. They are ruled over by Yama which came from Buddhism&#x27;s Hindu influences but certain scriptures and beliefs also state that there are 18 different Yamas in hell which have an army of demons and undead at their side.

Also, the Śūraṅgama Sūtra, a major Mahayana Buddhist text, describes fifty demonic states: the so-called fifty skandha maras, which are &quot;negative&quot; mirror-like reflections of or deviations from correct samādhi (meditative absorption) states. In this context demons are considered by Buddhists to be beings possessing some supernatural powers, who, in the past, might have practiced Dharma, the Buddha&#x27;s teaching, but due to practicing it incorrectly failed to develop true wisdom and true compassion, which are inseparable attributes of an enlightened being such as a Buddha or a Bodhisattva. In his autobiography, The Blazing Splendor, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, a prominent Tibetan Buddhist master of the 20th century describes encounters with such beings. Therefore, depending on the context, in Buddhism demons may refer to both disturbed mind states and actual beings.

===Hinduism===

Vedic scriptures include a range of spirits (Vetalas, Rakshasas, Bhutas, and Pishachas) that might be classified as demons. These spirits are souls of beings that have committed certain specific sins. As a purging punishment, they are condemned to roam without a physical form for a length of time, until a rebirth. Beings that died with unfulfilled desires or anger are also said to &quot;linger&quot; until those issues are resolved. Hindu text Atharvaveda gives an account of nature and habitats of such spirits including how to persuade / control them. There are occult traditions in Hinduism that seek to control such spirits to do their bidding. The Hindu text Garuda Purana details other kinds of punishments and judgments given out in Hell; it also gives an account of how spirits travel to various nether worlds.

===Zoroastrianism===
In the Zoroastrian tradition, Ahura Mazda, as the force of good Spenta Mainyu, will eventually be victorious in a cosmic battle with an evil force known as Angra Mainyu or Ahriman.

<text>The Wabar craters are impact craters located in Saudi Arabia first brought to the attention of Western scholars by British Arabist, explorer, writer and Colonial Office intelligence officer St John Philby, who discovered them while searching for the legendary city of Ubar in Arabia&#x27;s Rub&#x27; al Khali (&quot;Empty Quarter&quot;) in 1932.

==The expeditions==
===1932 Philby===
The vast desert wasteland of southern Saudi Arabia known as the Empty Quarter, or &quot;Rub&#x27; al Khali&quot; in Arabic, is one of the most desolate places on Earth. In 1932, Harry St John &quot;Jack&quot; Philby was hunting for a city named Ubar, that the Quran describes being destroyed by God for defying the Prophet Hud. Philby transliterated the name of the city as Wabar.

Philby had heard of Bedouin legends of an area called &quot;Al Hadida&quot; (&quot;place of iron&quot; in Arabic) with ruins of ancient habitations, and also an area where a piece of iron the size of a camel had been found, and so organized an expedition to visit the site. After a month&#x27;s journey through wastes so harsh that even some of the camels died, on 2 February 1932 Philby arrived at a patch of ground about a half a square kilometre in size, littered with chunks of white sandstone, black glass, and chunks of iron meteorite. Philby identified two large circular depressions partially filled with sand, and three other features that he identified as possible &quot;submerged craters&quot;. He also mapped the area where the large iron block was reputed to have been found. Philby thought that the area was a volcano, and it was only after bringing back samples to the UK that the site was identified as that of a meteorite impact by Leonard James Spencer of the British Museum.

A volcano in the midst of the Rub&#x27; al Khali! And below me, as I stood on that hill-top transfixed, lay the twin craters, whose black walls stood up gauntly above the encroaching sand like the battlements and bastions of some great castle. These craters were respectively about 100 and 50 yards in diameter, sunken in the middle but half choked with sand, while inside and outside their walls lay what I took to be lava in great circles where it seemed to have flowed out from the fiery furnace. Further examination revealed the fact that there were three similar craters close by, though these were surmounted by hills of sand and recognizable only by reason of the fringe of blackened slag round their edges.

Amongst the samples of iron, cindery material and silica glass that Philby brought back from the site was a 25 lb (11.3 kg) chunk of iron. Analysis showed it to be about 90% iron and 5% nickel, with the rest consisting of various elements, including copper, cobalt, and an unusually high concentration of iridium, at 6 ppm. This siderophile element implied that the Wabar site was a meteorite impact area.

===1937 Aramco===
In 1937, Aramco geologists T. F. Harriss and Walton Hoag, Jr. also investigated the site, but, like Philby, were unable to locate the large block of iron.

===1966 National Geographic and Aramco===
In 1966 reports came that the sands had shifted and the large iron block was again visible. &quot;National Geographic&quot; journalist Thomas J. Abercrombie visited the site and found the large meteorite: &quot;rumor has become a reality; the biggest iron meteorite ever found in Arabia lay at our feet ... shaped roughly like a saucer, it measured about four feet in diameter and two feet thick at center. A little quick geometry puts its weight at almost two and a half tons.&quot;

Later in October 1966, a group headed by Aramco employee James Mandaville visited the site with heavy lifting equipment. They found two large uncovered meteorites. The largest, weighing 2,045 kilograms, had a pitted, but roughly level top surface about a metre (3.5 feet) in diameter with one end formed into a cone shape when the meteorite penetrated the atmosphere like a bullet; it was imbedded in sand, which had drifted over the top. It was photographed &quot;in situ&quot;, then overturned by a bulldozer and lifted on board a trailer where it and another, smaller meteorite were taken to Dhahran.

===1982 Aramco===
Mandaville visited the site twice after his 1966 visit. On his last visit, in 1982, he noted that the desert winds and resultant movement of the dune system were covering the site: &quot;instead of two thirds of the crater rim (visible as before [in 1966, 16 years earlier]), less than a quarter of it showed.&quot;

===1994–1995 Zahid Tractors===
In 1994 and 1995 a total of three expeditions were undertaken, sponsored by Zahid Tractor Corporation. A United States Geological Survey scientist, Jeffrey C. Wynn joined all three expeditions, and astronomer and geologist Gene Shoemaker joined at least one. These expeditions were made with modern offroad vehicles into the Empty Quarter, but even with modern technology, the trips were difficult ones. Not only were conditions harsh, but the Wabar site was tricky to find, as it sits in the midst of an enormous dune field that has no fixed landmarks.

==The site==
The Wabar site covers about , and the most recent mapping shows three prominent, roughly circular craters. Five were reported by Philby in 1932, the largest of which measured and wide. Another was described by the second Zahid expedition and is 11 metres wide: this may be one of the other three originally described by Philby. They are all underlain by a hemispherical rim of &quot;insta-Rock,&quot; so called because it was created from local sand by the impact shock wave, and all three are nearly full of sand.

The surface of the area partly consisted of &quot;Insta-Rock&quot; or &quot;impactite&quot;, a bleached-white, coarsely-laminar sandstone-look-alike, and was littered with black glass slag and pellets. The impactite featured a form of shocked quartz known as &quot;coesite&quot;, and is thus clearly the product of an impact event. The impact did not penetrate to bedrock, but was confined to local sand, making it particularly valuable as a research site.
The presence of iron fragments at the site also pointed to a meteorite impact, as there are no iron deposits in the region. The iron was in the form of buried fist-sized cracked balls and smooth, sand-blasted fragments found on the surface. The largest fragment was recovered in a 1966 visit to Wabar and weighs 2.2 tonnes. It is known as the &quot;Camel&#x27;s Hump&quot; and was on display at the King Saud University in Riyadh until it was moved to the new National Museum of Saudi Arabia in Riyadh, where it is displayed in the entrance foyer.

The sand was turned into black glass near the craters, and pellets of the glass are scattered all over the area, decreasing in size with distance from the craters due to wind-sorting. The glass is about 90% local sand and 10% meteoritic iron and nickel.

The layout of the impact area suggests that the body fell at a shallow angle, and was moving at typical (although slightly slow) meteorite entry speeds of 11–17 km/s. Its total mass was more than 3,500 tonnes (which would give it a diameter of 16 meters at a density of 1.5 g/cm3). The shallow angle presented the body with more air resistance than it would have encountered at a steeper angle, and it broke up in the air into at least four pieces before impact. The biggest piece struck with an explosion roughly equivalent to the atom bomb that levelled Hiroshima.

==Dating the impact event==
Fission-track analysis of glass fragments by Storzer (1965) suggested the Wabar impact took place thousands of years ago, but delicate glass filigree, and the fact that the craters have been filled in considerably since Philby&#x27;s 1932 visit, suggests their origin is much more recent. Thermoluminescence dating by Prescott &quot;et al.&quot; (2004) suggests the impact site is less than 250 years old. This is consistent with Arab reports of a fireball passing over Riyadh, variously reported as occurring in 1863 or 1891 and heading southeast, reported in Philby&#x27;s book &quot;Empty Quarter&quot; (1933). Fragments scattered from the path of this fireball at the Umm al-Hadidah site 25 kilometers northwest of Wabar, which contained fragments of a Type IIIA octahedrite identical to Wabar fragments, support this northwestern direction of arrival. Moreover, mapping done in 1995 show that there is an asymmetric distribution of &quot;Insta-Rock&quot;, the coarsely-laminar sandstone created by the impact shock-wave, in the down-range (southeast) direction of the three main craters mapped.

<doc id="174604" wikidata="Q4924541" url="?curid=174604" title="List of University of Oxford people">
<text>This page serves as a central navigational point for lists of more than 2,350 members of the [[University of Oxford]], divided into relevant groupings for ease of use. The vast majority were students at the university, although they did not necessarily take a degree; others have held fellowships at one of the university&#x27;s colleges; many fall into both categories. This page does not include people whose only connection with the university consists in the award of an honorary degree or an honorary fellowship.

The list has been divided into categories indicating the field of activity in which people have become well known. Many of the university&#x27;s alumni/ae, or old members, as they are more traditionally known, have attained a level of distinction in more than one field. These appear only in the category with which it is felt they are most often associated, or in which they have been more recently involved. Hence Jeffrey Archer (Brasenose), a novelist, is listed as a life peer; Imran Khan (Keble), a former captain of the Pakistani cricket team, is listed as a Pakistani politician. Some academic disciplines are more difficult to define than others. In particular, many theologians, lawyers, and sociologists work in areas that might be thought to be encompassed by philosophy.

Oxonians (a term for members, students or alumni of the university derived from its Latin name, &quot;Academia Oxoniensis&quot;) have included two British kings and at least fifteen monarchs of eleven other sovereign states (including five reigning monarchs), twenty-eight British prime ministers, and thirty-five presidents and prime ministers of nineteen other countries. there are seven Oxonians in the Cabinet of the United Kingdom and two in the Shadow Cabinet. The university lays claim to thirteen saints, ten blesseds, an antipope, nineteen cardinals, and eighty-nine archbishops (including thirty-two of Canterbury and twenty-two of York). The university claims forty-seven Nobel Laureates and three Fields Medallists. The university&#x27;s oldest student was Gertrud Seidmann, who was awarded a Certificate of Graduate Attainment aged 91.

This list also includes twenty-five princes and princesses (among them the heirs apparent of Belgium and Brunei), thirty-four dukes, nineteen marquesses, eighty-two earls and countesses, forty-six viscounts and viscountesses, and 188 barons and baronesses; 246 bishops (Anglican and Catholic); 291 Members of Parliament (excluding MPs who were subsequently peers), eleven Members of the European Parliament (excluding MEPs also serving at Westminster), twelve Lord Chancellors, nine Lord Chief Justices and twenty-two law lords; ten US Senators, ten US Representatives (including a Speaker of the House), three state governors, and four associate justices of the US Supreme Court; as well as six puisne justices of the Supreme Court of Canada and a chief justice of the now defunct Federal Court of Canada.

<text>Supply-side economics is a macroeconomic theory postulating that economic growth can be most effectively fostered by lowering taxes, decreasing regulation, and allowing free trade. According to supply-side economics theory, consumers will benefit from greater supply of goods and services at lower prices, and employment will increase. Supply-side fiscal policies are designed to increase aggregate supply, as opposed to aggregate demand, thereby expanding output and employment while lowering prices. Such policies are of several general varieties:
#Investments in human capital, such as education, healthcare, and encouraging the transfer of technologies and business processes, to improve productivity (output per worker). Encouraging globalized free trade via containerization is a major recent example.
#Tax reduction, to provide incentives to work, invest and take risks. Lowering income tax rates and eliminating or lowering tariffs are examples of such policies.
#Investments in new capital equipment and research and development (R&amp;D), to further improve productivity. Allowing businesses to depreciate capital equipment more rapidly (e.g., over one year as opposed to 10) gives them an immediate financial incentive to invest in such equipment.
#Reduction in government regulations, to encourage business formation and expansion.

A basis of supply-side economics is the Laffer curve, a theoretical relationship between rates of taxation and government revenue. The Laffer curve suggests that when the tax level is too high, lowering tax rates will boost government revenue through higher economic growth, though the level at which rates are deemed &quot;too high&quot; is disputed. A 2012 poll of leading economists found none agreed that reducing the US federal income tax rate would result in higher annual tax revenue within five years. Critics also argue that several large tax cuts in the United States over the last 40 years have not increased revenue.

The term &quot;supply-side economics&quot; was thought for some time to have been coined by the journalist Jude Wanniski in 1975; according to Robert D. Atkinson, the term &quot;supply side&quot; was first used in 1976 by Herbert Stein (a former economic adviser to President Richard Nixon) and only later that year was this term repeated by Jude Wanniski. The term alludes to ideas of the economists Robert Mundell and Arthur Laffer. The term is contrasted with demand-side economics.

== Historical origins ==

Supply-side economics developed in response to the stagflation of the 1970s. It drew on a range of non-Keynesian economic thought, including the Chicago School and New Classical School. Bruce Bartlett, an advocate of supply-side economics, traced the school of thought&#x27;s intellectual descent from the philosophers Ibn Khaldun and David Hume, satirist Jonathan Swift, political economist Adam Smith and United States Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton. In 2007, Bartlett stated:

Current day advocates of supply-side economic policies claim that lower tax rates produce macroeconomic benefits and emphasize this benefit rather than their traditional ideological Classical liberals opposition to taxation because they opposed government in general. Their traditional claim was that each man had a right to himself and his property and therefore taxation was immoral and of questionable legal grounding. On the other hand, supply-side economists argued that the alleged collective benefit (i.e. increased economic output and efficiency) provided the main impetus for tax cuts. As in classical economics, supply-side economics proposed that production or supply is the key to economic prosperity and that consumption or demand is merely a secondary consequence. Early on, this idea had been summarized in Say&#x27;s law of markets, which states: &quot;A product is no sooner created, than it, from that instant, affords a market for other products to the full extent of its own value.&quot; or, in other words, production (supply) must first occur to enable economic activity or trade.

Supply-side economics rose in popularity among Republican Party politicians from 1977 onwards. Prior to 1977, Republicans were more split on tax reduction, with some worrying that tax cuts would fuel inflation and exacerbate deficits. In 1978, Jude Wanniski published &quot;The Way the World Works&quot; in which he laid out the central thesis of supply-side economics and detailed the failure of high tax rate progressive income tax systems and United States monetary policy under Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter in the 1970s. Wanniski advocated lower tax rates and a return to some kind of gold standard, similar to the 1944–1971 Bretton Woods System that Nixon abandoned.

== Definition and principles ==
James D. Gwartney and Richard L. Stroup provide a definition of supply-side economics as the belief that adjustments in marginal tax rates have significant effects on the total supply. Gwartney and Stroup said &quot;that the supply-side argument provided the foundation for the Reagan tax policy, which led to significant reductions in marginal tax rates in the United States during the 1980s&quot;.

Barry P. Bosworth has provided another definition by presenting the supply-side economics from two perspectives:

# &quot;A broad interest in the determinants of aggregate supply – the volume and quality of the capital and labor inputs and the efficiency with which they are used&quot;
# &quot;A narrower focus on tax reductions as a means of increasing the supply of savings, investment, and labor.&quot;

=== Supply-side vs. previous approaches to economic policy ===
Supply-side economics has originated as an alternative to Keynesian economics, which focused macroeconomic policy on management of final demand. Demand-side economics relies on a fixed-price view of the economy, where the demand plays a key role in defining the future supply growth, which also allows for incentive implications of investment.

The Keynesian policy approaches focus on demand management as a major instrument to affect aggregate production and GNP, while Monetarism focuses on management of monetary aggregates and credit. Unlike supply-side economics, demand-side economics is based on the assumption that increases in GNP result from increased spending.

Traditional policy approaches were challenged by the theory of supply-side economics in the Reagan Administration of the 1980s. It claims that fiscal policy may lead to changes in supply as well as in demand. So, when marginal tax rates are high, consumers pursue additional leisure and current consumption instead of pursuing current income and extra income in the future. Therefore, there is a decline in work effort and investment, which in turn causes a decrease of production and GNP, regardless of the total demand levels.

On these assumptions, supply side economists formulate the idea that a cut in marginal tax rates has a positive effect on economic growth.

=== Role of the marginal tax rates ===
The main focus of supply-side economics is promotion of economic growth. In this regard, some studies have suggested to consider two relative prices.

The first one influences decisions of individuals on the distribution of their income between consumption and savings. The cost of individual&#x27;s decision to assign a unit of income to either consumption or savings is a future value of the unit, which has been given up by choosing either to consume or to save. The unit of income value is defined by the marginal tax rates. Therefore, higher tax rates would decrease the cost of consumption, which would cause a fall in investment and savings. At the same time, lower tax rates would cause the investment and savings levels to rise, while the consumption levels would fall.

The second price influences decisions of individuals on the distribution of their time between work and leisure. The cost of individual&#x27;s decision to allocate a unit of time either to work or leisure stands for current income, which was given up by choosing either work or leisure. The cost also includes the future income, which was given up for leisure instead of enhancing the professional skills. The value of lost income is defined by the tax rate assigned to the additional income. Therefore, the increase in marginal tax rates leads to a decrease in the price of leisure. However, if the marginal tax rate decline, the cost of leisure increases.

Both the amount of retained and taxed income is determined by the marginal tax rate. That is why, from a supply-side economist&#x27;s standpoint, marginal tax rates play a significant role in determining the development of the economy. Due to crucial role in determining how much time workers will spend on work and leisure or how much income will be spent on consumption and for savings, supply-side economists insist on decreasing tax rates as they believe it could improve the growth rates of the economy.

=== Laffer curve ===
Laffer curve illustrates a mathematical relationship between tax revenues and tax rates, which was popularized by economist Arthur B. Laffer in 1974. The Laffer Curve posits the existence of a maximum point when tax revenue is maximized at a specific (unknown) tax rate. Many interpret the Laffer Curve as higher tax rates can sometimes decrease the tax base, which will lead to the decrease in tax revenues even if the tax rates are high. Due to the effect exerted by taxes on the taxed income, the adjustment of tax rates may not lead to proportional changes in tax revenues. That is why, some supply-side economists insist decreasing high tax rates can result in an increase of tax revenues.

The Laffer curve embodies a postulate of supply-side economics: that tax rates and tax revenues are distinct, with government tax revenues the same at a 100% tax rate as they are at a 0% tax rate and maximum revenue somewhere in between these two values. Supply-siders argued that in a high tax rate environment lowering tax rates would result in either increased revenues or smaller revenue losses than one would expect relying on only static estimates of the previous tax base.

This led supply-siders to advocate large reductions in marginal income and capital gains tax rates to encourage greater investment, which would produce more supply. Jude Wanniski and many others advocate a zero capital gains rate.

== History ==
=== Reaganomics ===
In the United States, commentators frequently equate supply-side economics with Reaganomics. The administration of Republican president Ronald Reagan promoted its fiscal policies as being based on supply-side economics. Reagan made supply-side economics a household phrase and promised an across-the-board reduction in income tax rates and an even larger reduction in capital gains tax rates. During Reagan&#x27;s 1980 presidential campaign, the key economic concern was double digit inflation, which Reagan described as &quot;[t]oo many dollars chasing too few goods&quot;, but rather than the usual dose of tight money, recession and layoffs, with their consequent loss of production and wealth, he promised a gradual and painless way to fight inflation by &quot;producing our way out of it&quot;.

Switching from earlier monetary policy, Federal Reserve chair Paul Volcker implemented tighter monetary policies including lower money supply growth to break the inflationary psychology and squeeze inflationary expectations out of the economic system. Therefore, supply-side supporters argue that Reaganomics was only partially based on supply-side economics.

Congress under Reagan passed a plan that would slash taxes by $749 billion over five years. Critics claim that the tax cuts increased budget deficits while Reagan supporters credit them with helping the 1980s economic expansion and argued that the budget deficit would have decreased if not for massive increases in military spending. As a result, Jason Hymowitz cited Reagan—along with Jack Kemp—as a great advocate for supply-side economics in politics and repeatedly praised his leadership.

Critics of Reaganomics claim it failed to produce much of the exaggerated gains some supply-siders had promised. Paul Krugman later summarized the situation: &quot;When Ronald Reagan was elected, the supply-siders got a chance to try out their ideas. Unfortunately, they failed.&quot; Although he credited supply-side economics for being more successful than monetarism which he claimed &quot;left the economy in ruins&quot;, he stated that supply-side economics produced results which fell &quot;so far short of what it promised&quot;, describing the supply-side theory as &quot;free lunches&quot;.

=== Clinton years ===

Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 into law, which raised income taxes rates on incomes above $115,000, created additional higher tax brackets for corporate income over $335,000, removed the cap on Medicare taxes, raised fuel taxes and increased the portion of Social Security income subject to tax, among other tax increases. Frankel and Orszag described the &quot;progressive fiscal conservatism&quot; of the 1993 package: &quot;Such progressive fiscal conservatism combines modest attempts at redistribution (the progressive component) and budget discipline (the fiscal conservative component). Thus the 1993 package included significant spending reductions and tax increases. But it concentrated the tax increases on upper-income taxpayers, while substantially expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit, Head Start, and other government programs aimed at lower earners.&quot; The tax increases led to greater revenue (relative to a baseline without a tax increase).

The bill was strongly opposed by Republicans, vigorously attacked by John Kasich and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich as destined to cause job losses and lower revenue.

Economist Paul Krugman wrote in 2017 that Clinton&#x27;s tax increases on the rich provided counter-example to the supply-side tax cut doctrine: &quot;Bill Clinton provided a clear test, by raising taxes on the rich. Republicans predicted disaster, but instead the economy boomed, creating more jobs than under Reagan.&quot;

Supply-side economist Alan Reynolds argued that the Clinton era represented a continuation of a low tax policy (from the 1980s):

===Kansas experiment===

In May 2012, Sam Brownback, Governor of the state of Kansas, signed into law the &quot;Kansas Senate Bill Substitute HB 2117&quot;, which cut the number of individual income tax brackets from three to two, and cut the top income tax rates from 6.45% and 6.25% to 4.9% and the bottom rate from 3.5% to 3%. It also eliminated the 7% tax on &quot;pass-through&quot; income, income that businesses — such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, limited liability companies, and subchapter S corporations — pass on to their owners instead of paying corporate income tax on, for the owners of almost 200,000 businesses The law cut taxes by 231 million in its first year, and cuts were projected to increase to 934 million annually after six years.

The cuts were based on model legislation published by the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), and were supported by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, supply-side economist Arthur Laffer, economics commentator Stephen Moore and anti-tax leader Grover Norquist. The tax cuts have been called the &quot;Kansas experiment&quot;, and was described by the Brookings Institution as &quot;one of the cleanest experiments for how tax cuts affect economic growth in the U.S.&quot;

Brownback compared his tax cut policies with those of Ronald Reagan, but also described them as &quot;a real live experiment ... We&#x27;ll see how it works.&quot;, Brownback forecast his cuts would create an additional 23,000 jobs in Kansas by 2020, and was intended to generate rapid economic growth, which he said would be &quot;like a shot of adrenaline into the heart of the Kansas economy.&quot; On the other hand, the Kansas Legislature&#x27;s research staff warned of the possibility of a deficit of nearly 2.5 billion by July 2018.

By 2017, state revenues had fallen by hundreds of millions of dollars 
causing spending on roads, bridges, and education to be slashed, but instead of boosting economic growth, growth in Kansas remained consistently below average. A working paper by two economists at Oklahoma State University (Dan Rickman and Hongbo Wang) using historical data from several other states with economies structured similarly to Kansas found that the Kansas economy grew about 7.8% less and employment about 2.6% less than it would have had Brownback not cut taxes.
In 2017, the Republican Legislature of Kansas voted to roll back the cuts, and after Brownback vetoed the repeal, overrode his veto.

According to Max Ehrenfreund, economists generally agree that an explanation for the reduction instead of increase in economic growth from the tax cuts is that &quot;any&quot; benefits from tax cuts come over the long, not short run, but what does come in the short run is a major decline in demand for goods and services. In the Kansas economy cuts in state government expenditures cut incomes of state government &quot;employees, suppliers and contractors&quot; who spent much or most of their incomes locally. In addition, concern over the state&#x27;s large budget deficits &quot;might have deterred businesses from making major new investments&quot;.

One problem Kansas encountered is that while studies have shown that tax cuts increase economic growth, the increased revenue from that growth at the new lower tax rates are only enough to make up for 10-30% of the tax cuts, meaning that to avoid deficits, spending cuts must also be made.

=== Trump years ===
Supply-side advocates Laffer and economics commentators Stephen Moore and Larry Kudlow played prominent roles in formulating Trump&#x27;s economic policies by advising him on his tax cut, as well as encouraging him to lower trade barriers. Laffer and Moore wrote a 2018 book about the policy, &quot;Trumponomics&quot;, with a foreword by Kudlow. Economist Gregory Mankiw reviewed the book in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, and characterized the statements around Trump&#x27;s policies as &quot;snake-oil economics&quot;. He criticized the authors for un-apologetically parroting the president&#x27;s claimed annual growth rates spawned by his tax cut to be 1–4%, when the highest reasonable estimates were around 0.5%, but also credits them for continuing to support the consensus view that free trade is good for all, against the president&#x27;s mercantilist views. He also criticized them for following a simplistic &quot;economic growth will solve all problems&quot; approach, when previous presidential economic advisors had been more nuanced, recognizing the unavoidable tradeoff between equity and efficiency in their approaches to managing the economy. Trump implemented individual and corporate income tax cuts which took effect in 2018. Rutgers economics professor Farrokh Langdana argued that the Trump tax cuts were an example of supply-side tax policy, citing a letter from economists long-associated with the supply-side theory describing them as such.

== Fiscal policy theory ==
One benefit of a supply-side policy is that shifting the aggregate supply curve outward means prices can be lowered along with expanding output and employment. This is in contrast to demand-side policies (e.g., higher government spending), which even if successful tend to create inflationary pressures (i.e., raise the aggregate price level) as the aggregate demand curve shifts outward. Infrastructure investment is an example of a policy that has both demand-side and supply-side elements.

Supply-side economics holds that increased taxation steadily reduces economic activity within a nation and discourages investment. Taxes act as a type of trade barrier or tariff that causes economic participants to revert to less efficient means of satisfying their needs. As such, higher taxation leads to lower levels of specialization and lower economic efficiency. The idea is said to be illustrated by the Laffer curve.

Supply-side economists have less to say on the effects of deficits and sometimes cite Robert Barro&#x27;s work that states that rational economic actors will buy bonds in sufficient quantities to reduce long-term interest rates.

== Effect on economic growth and tax revenues ==
Bruce Bartlett stated in 2007 that &quot;The original supply-siders suggested that some tax cuts, under very special circumstances, might actually raise federal revenues. ... But today it is common to hear tax cutters claim, implausibly, that all tax cuts raise revenue.&quot;

Some contemporary economists do not consider supply-side economics a tenable economic theory, with Alan Blinder calling it an &quot;ill-fated&quot; and perhaps &quot;silly&quot; school on the pages of a 2006 textbook. Greg Mankiw, former chairman of President President George W. Bush&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers, offered similarly sharp criticism of the school in the early editions of his introductory economics textbook. &quot;Tax cuts rarely pay for themselves. My reading of the academic literature leads me to believe that about one-third of the cost of a typical tax cut is recouped with faster economic growth.&quot;

In a 1992 article for the &quot;Harvard International Review&quot;, James Tobin wrote: &quot;The &#x27;Laffer curve&#x27; idea that tax cuts would actually increase revenues turned out to deserve the ridicule.&quot;

Karl Case and Ray Fair wrote in &quot;Principles of Economics&quot;, &quot;The extreme promises of supply-side economics did not materialize. President Reagan argued that because of the effect depicted in the Laffer curve, the government could maintain expenditures, cut tax rates, and balance the budget. This was not the case. Government revenues fell sharply from levels that would have been realized without the tax cuts.&quot;

Supply side proponents Trabandt and Uhlig argue that &quot;static scoring overestimates the revenue loss for labor and capital tax cuts&quot; and that &quot;dynamic scoring&quot; is a better predictor for the effects of tax cuts.

A 1999 study by University of Chicago economist Austan Goolsbee examined major changes in high-income tax rates in the United States from the 1920s onwards. It concluded that there were only modest changes in the reported income of high-income individuals, indicating that the tax changes had little effect on how much people work. He concluded that the notion that governments could raise more money by cutting rates &quot;is unlikely to be true at anything like today&#x27;s marginal tax rates.&quot; In 2015, one study found that in the past several decades, tax cuts in the U.S. seldom recouped revenue losses and had minimal impact on GDP growth.

A 2008 working paper found that in the case of Russia, &quot;tax rate cuts can increase revenues by improving tax compliance.&quot;

&quot;The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics&quot; reports that estimates of revenue-maximizing tax rates have varied widely, with a mid-range of around 70%. According to a 2012 study, &quot;the U.S. marginal top [tax] rate is far from the top of the Laffer curve.&quot; A 2012 survey found a consensus among leading economists that reducing the US federal income tax rate would raise GDP but would not increase tax revenue.

John Quiggin distinguishes between the Laffer curve and Laffer&#x27;s analysis of tax rates. The Laffer curve was &quot;correct but unoriginal&quot;, but Laffer&#x27;s analysis that the United States was on the wrong side of the Laffer curve &quot;was original but incorrect.&quot;

=== 1920s tax cuts ===

Proponents of supply-side economics have sometimes cited tax cuts enacted in the 1920s as evidence that tax cuts can increase tax revenue. After World War I, the highest tax bracket, which was for those earning over $100,000 a year (worth at least $1 million a year now), was over 70 percent. According to The Heritage Foundation, revenue acts of 1921, 1924 and 1926 reduced this tax rate to less than 25 percent, yet tax revenues actually went up significantly. Tax historian Joseph Thorndike argues that the tax cuts helped &quot;bolster&quot; growth but did not &quot;cover the full cost of those tax cuts&quot;.

=== Revenue Act of 1964 ===

Proponents of supply-side economics sometimes cite tax cuts enacted by President Lyndon B. Johnson with the Revenue Act of 1964. John F. Kennedy had the year prior advocated a drastic tax-rate cut in 1963 when the top income tax rate was 91%, arguing that &quot;[t]ax rates are too high today and tax revenues too low, and the soundest way to raise revenues in the long run is to cut rates now&quot;. The CBO concluded in 1978 that the tax cuts reduced tax revenue by $12 billion and that only between $3 billion to $9 billion were recaptured due to bolstered economic growth. According to the CBO, &quot;most of this rise [in revenues] was due to economic growth that would have taken place even without the tax cut.&quot;

At the same time, some studies have found a relatively robust response to tax cuts from the top 5% of tax returns. There has been identified an increase of 7.7% in revenues from the top 5%, from $17.17 billion US in 1963 to $18.49 billion in 1965. Hereby, the data have provided evidence that the group has been in the prohibitive part of the Laffer curve, because its input to total tax revenues have increased despite the tax rates decreasing significantly.

=== Reaganomics ===
Supply-siders justified Reagan&#x27;s tax cuts during the 1980s by claiming they would result in net increases in tax revenue, yet tax revenues declined (relative to a baseline without the cuts) due to Reagan&#x27;s tax cuts, and the deficit ballooned during Reagan&#x27;s term in office. The Treasury Department studied the Reagan tax cuts and concluded they significantly reduced tax revenues relative to a baseline without them. The 1990 budget by the Reagan administration concluded that the 1981 tax cuts had caused a reduction in tax revenue.

Both CBO and the Reagan Administration forecast that individual and business income tax revenues would be lower if the Reagan tax cut proposals were implemented, relative to a policy baseline without those cuts, by about $50 billion in 1982 and $210 billion by 1986. FICA tax revenue increased because in 1983 FICA tax rates were increased from 6.7% to 7% and the ceiling was raised by $2,100. For the self-employed, the FICA tax rate went from 9.35% to 14%. The FICA tax rate increased throughout Reagan&#x27;s term and rose to 7.51% in 1988 and the ceiling was raised by 61% through Reagan&#x27;s two terms. Those tax hikes on wage earners, along with inflation, were the source of revenue gains in the early 1980s.

It has been contended by some supply-side critics that the argument to lower taxes to increase revenues was a smokescreen for &quot;starving&quot; the government of revenues in the hope that the tax cuts would lead to a corresponding drop in government spending, but this did not turn out to be the case. Paul Samuelson called this notion &quot;the tape worm theory—the idea that the way to get rid of a tape worm is [to] stab your patient in the stomach&quot;.

There is frequent confusion on the meaning of the term &quot;supply-side economics&quot; between the related ideas of the existence of the Laffer Curve and the belief that decreasing tax rates can increase tax revenues. Many supply-side economists doubt the latter claim while still supporting the general policy of tax cuts. Economist Gregory Mankiw used the term &quot;fad economics&quot; to describe the notion of tax rate cuts increasing revenue in the third edition of his 2007 &quot;Principles of Macroeconomics&quot; textbook in a section entitled &quot;Charlatans and Cranks&quot;: 

In 1986, Martin Feldstein — a self-described &quot;traditional supply sider&quot; who served as Reagan&#x27;s chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors from 1982 to 1984 — characterized the &quot;new supply siders&quot; who emerged circa 1980:

What distinguished the new supply siders from the traditional supply siders as the 1980s began was not the policies they advocated but the claims that they made for those policies ... The &quot;new&quot; supply siders were much more extravagant in their claims. They projected rapid growth, dramatic increases in tax revenue, a sharp rise in saving, and a relatively painless reduction in inflation. The height of supply side hyperbole was the &quot;Laffer curve&quot; proposition that the tax cut would actually increase tax revenue because it would unleash an enormously depressed supply of effort. Another remarkable proposition was the claim that even if the tax cuts did lead to an increased budget deficit, that would not reduce the funds available for investment in plant and equipment because tax changes would raise the saving rate by enough to finance the increased deficit ... Nevertheless, I have no doubt that the loose talk of the supply side extremists gave fundamentally good policies a bad name and led to quantitative mistakes that not only contributed to subsequent budget deficits but that also made it more difficult to modify policy when those deficits became apparent.

=== Bush tax cuts ===

During his presidency, President Bush signed the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, which entailed significant tax cuts. In 2003, the Congressional Budget Office conducted a dynamic scoring analysis of tax cuts advocated by supply advocates, and found that the Bush tax cuts would not pay for themselves. Two of the nine models used in the study predicted a large improvement in the deficit over the next ten years resulting from tax cuts, but only by making the assumption that people would work harder from 2004 to 2014 because they believed that tax rates would increase again in 2014, and they wanted to make more money before the tax cuts expired.

In 2006, the CBO released a study titled &quot;A Dynamic Analysis of Permanent Extension of the President&#x27;s Tax Relief&quot;. This study found that under the best possible scenario making tax cuts permanent would increase the economy &quot;over the long run&quot; by 0.7%. This study was criticized by many economists, including Harvard Economics Professor Greg Mankiw, who pointed out that the CBO used a very low value for the earnings-weighted compensated labor supply elasticity of 0.14. In a paper published in the Journal of Public Economics, Mankiw and Matthew Weinzierl noted that the current economics research would place an appropriate value for labor supply elasticity at around 0.5.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that extending the Bush tax cuts beyond their 2010 expiration would increase the deficit by $1.8 trillion over 10 years. The CBO also completed a study in 2005 analyzing a hypothetical 10% income tax cut and concluded that under various scenarios there would be minimal offsets to the loss of revenue. In other words, deficits would increase by nearly the same amount as the tax cut in the first five years with limited feedback revenue thereafter.

Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman agreed the tax cuts would reduce tax revenues and result in intolerable deficits, though he supported them as a means to restrain federal spending. Friedman characterized the reduced government tax revenue as &quot;cutting their allowance&quot;.

Douglas Holtz-Eakin was a Bush administration economist who was appointed director of the Congressional Budget Office in 2003. Under his leadership, the CBO undertook a study of income tax rates which found that any new revenue from tax cuts paled in comparison to their cost.

Dartmouth economics professor Andrew Samwick was the chief staff economist for the Bush Council of Economic Advisers from July 2003 to July 2004. Writing on his blog in 2007, Samwick urged his former colleagues in the Bush administration to avoid asserting that the Bush tax cuts paid for themselves, because &quot;No thoughtful person believes it...Not a single one.&quot;

=== Trump tax cuts ===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in November 2018 that the Trump tax overhaul &quot;has fattened the paychecks of most American workers, padded the profits of large corporations and sped economic growth.&quot; Cautioning that &quot;its still early but ten months after the law took effect, the promised &#x27;supply side&#x27; bump is harder to find than the sugar-high stimulus.&quot; The writers explained that &quot;It&#x27;s highly unusual for deficits...to grow this much during periods of prosperity&quot; and that &quot;the fiscal health of the U.S. is deteriorating fast, as revenues have declined sharply&quot; (nearly $200 billion or about 6%) relative to the CBO forecast prior to the tax cuts. Results for 2018 included:
*Contrary to claims the tax cuts would pay for themselves, the budget deficit rose to $779 billion in fiscal year 2018, up 17% versus the prior year.
*Corporate tax revenues were down by one-third in fiscal year 2018.
*Stock buyback activity increased significantly.
*GDP growth, business investment and corporate profits increased.
*A typical worker in a large company got a $225 raise or one-time bonus, due to the law.
*Real wage growth (adjusted for inflation) was slightly slower in 2018 than 2017.

Analysis conducted by the Congressional Research Service on the first-year effect of the tax cut found that little if any economic growth in 2018 could be attributed to it. Growth in GDP, employment, worker compensation and business investment slowed during the second year following enactment of the tax cut, prior to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Following the Trump tax cut, top White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow falsely asserted that federal revenues had increased about 10% since the tax cut, though they had actually declined. He also falsely asserted that the CBO had found the &quot;entire $1.5 trillion tax cut is virtually paid for by higher revenues and better nominal GDP.&quot;

=== China&#x27;s Supply-side Structural Reform ===
Beginning in 2012, China&#x27;s economic performance entered a &quot;new normal,&quot; in which the growth of the economy slowed to a medium pace for the first time since the broad economic reforms of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. In response, Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, announced supply-side structural reforms (SSSR) in 2015 in an effort to combat the slowing economic growth, moving away from the export-oriented economy and toward supply and production driven growth. The focus of the reforms correspond to increase in total factor productivity (TFP) through an increase in investment in technological improvements as a replacement for the labor and capital-intensive emphasis of the previous growth model.
China&#x27;s supply-side structural reforms focus on the reduction of excess capacity across various economic sectors. The reform plan centers around four key areas: cutting excess industrial capacity, reducing leverage in the corporate sector, reducing stock of property inventories, and lowering costs for new enterprises. The former two areas corresponds to short-term initiatives related to the state-owned sectors, while the former initiatives correspond to longer-term solutions within the private sector. Cutting excess industrial capacity focuses heavily on sectors like coal, steel, and electricity generation. The targets for coal production reductions implemented by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) amounted to 250 million tonnes per annum (Mta) in 2016 as well as a 100-150 Mta reduction in steel production capacity over a five-year period. The result in the steel industry was more pricing power for the remaining large firms, as well as higher profits due to the increase in price. The increase in profits due to excess capacity reductions has also led to an increased capacity of firms to settle outstanding debts and reduce leverage, part of the second pillar of China&#x27;s SSSR. As part of the deleveraging initiative, the government also encouraged mergers and acquisitions, direct financing, and debt-to-equity swaps, resulting in the stabilization of corporate debt to GDP ratio. Additional reforms include increased incentives for private sector investment, development of modern service industries, and increasing public goods and services supply. The longer-term initiatives have also been accompanied by large-scale tax cuts as well as a transition from business tax to value-added tax (VAT) which produced positive results for service industry growth. Policies targeted toward new growth engine creation include Made in China 2025 and the Internet Plus agenda, both of which have been attributed in part to the rapid growth of China&#x27;s industrial and innovation competitiveness.
China&#x27;s supply-side structural reforms are ongoing and oriented toward the long term. The adjustments to the industrial sector as a result of the early reform policies have been attributed to a nominal increase in GDP growth. However, the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic impacted demand growth in China&#x27;s domestic consumer market, which has slowed the effects of continued supply-side reforms.

== Housing supply and prices ==
Increasing the supply of housing is a way to drive down prices, in contrast to demand-side economics which believes in subsidizing buyers or reducing demand with tight monetary policy.

== Criticism ==

Critics of supply-side policies emphasize the growing federal deficits, increased income inequality and lack of growth. They argue that the Laffer curve only measures the rate of taxation, not tax incidence, which may be a stronger predictor of whether a tax code change is stimulative or dampening.

Writing in 2010, John Quiggin said, &quot;To the extent that there was an economic response to the Reagan tax cuts, and to those of George W. Bush twenty years later, it seems largely to have been a Keynesian demand-side response, to be expected when governments provide households with additional net income in the context of a depressed economy.&quot;

Cutting marginal tax rates can also be perceived as primarily beneficial to the wealthy, which some see as politically rather than economically motivated:

Studies, which have analysed the tax cuts in 2001 (EGTRRA), provided controversial conclusions: the decrease in taxes have provided a generally positive impact on the future output from the effect of the lower tax rates on human capital accumulation, private saving and investment, labor supply; however, the tax cuts have produced adverse effects such as higher deficits and reduced national savings. Thus, Gale and Potter (2002) concluded that these tax cuts could not affect the GDP levels in any significant way in the next 10 years.

<doc id="174609" wikidata="Q55816" url="?curid=174609" title="Chicxulub crater">
<text>The Chicxulub crater ( ) is an impact crater buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. Its center is offshore, but the crater is named after the onshore community of Chicxulub Pueblo (not the larger coastal town of Chicxulub Puerto). It was formed slightly over 66 million years ago when an asteroid, about in diameter, struck Earth. The crater is estimated to be in diameter and in depth. It is believed to be the second largest impact structure on Earth, and the only one whose peak ring is intact and directly accessible for scientific research.

The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucatán Peninsula during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan R. Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the crater&#x27;s impact origin includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas.

The date of the impact coincides with the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (commonly known as the K–Pg or K–T boundary). It is now widely accepted that the devastation and climate disruption resulting from the impact was the primary cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, a mass extinction of 75% of plant and animal species on Earth, including all non-avian dinosaurs.

==Discovery==
In the late 1970s, geologist Walter Alvarez and his father, Nobel Prize-winning scientist Luis Walter Alvarez, put forth their theory that the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction was caused by an impact event. The main evidence of such an impact was contained in a thin layer of clay present in the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary) in Gubbio, Italy. The Alvarezes and colleagues reported that it contained an abnormally high concentration of iridium, a chemical element rare on Earth but common in asteroids. Iridium levels in this layer were as much as 160 times above the background level. It was hypothesized that the iridium was spread into the atmosphere when the impactor was vaporized and settled across Earth&#x27;s surface among other material thrown up by the impact, producing the layer of iridium-enriched clay. At the time, there was no consensus on what caused the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction and the boundary layer, with theories including a nearby supernova, climate change, or a geomagnetic reversal. The Alvarezes&#x27; impact hypothesis was rejected by many paleontologists, who believed that the lack of fossils found close to the K–Pg boundary—the &quot;three-meter problem&quot;—suggested a more gradual die-off of fossil species.

The Alvarezes, joined by Frank Asaro and Helen Michel from University of California, Berkeley, published their paper on the iridium anomaly in &quot;Science&quot; in June 1980. Almost simultaneously Jan Smit and Jan Hertogen published their iridium findings from Caravaca, Spain, in &quot;Nature&quot; in May 1980. These papers were followed by other reports of similar iridium spikes at the K–Pg boundary across the globe, and sparked wide interest in the cause of the K–Pg extinction; over 2,000 papers were published in the 1980s on the topic. There were no known impact craters that were the right age and size, spurring a search for a suitable candidate. Recognizing the scope of the work, Lee Hunt and Lee Silver organized a cross-discipline meeting in Snowbird, Utah, in 1981. Unknown to them, evidence of the crater they were looking for was being presented the same week, and would be largely missed by the scientific community.
In 1978, geophysicists Glen Penfield and Antonio Camargo were working for the Mexican state-owned oil company Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) as part of an airborne magnetic survey of the Gulf of Mexico north of the Yucatán Peninsula. Penfield&#x27;s job was to use geophysical data to scout possible locations for oil drilling. In the offshore magnetic data, Penfield noted anomalies whose depth he estimated and mapped. He then obtained onshore gravity data from the 1940s. When the gravity maps and magnetic anomalies were compared, Penfield described a shallow &quot;bullseye&quot;, in diameter, appearing on the otherwise non-magnetic and uniform surroundings—clear evidence to him of an impact feature. A decade earlier, the same map had suggested a crater to contractor Robert Baltosser, but Pemex corporate policy prevented him from publicizing his conclusion.

Penfield presented his findings to Pemex, who rejected the crater theory, instead deferring to findings that ascribed the feature to volcanic activity. Pemex disallowed release of specific data, but let Penfield and Camargo present the results at the 1981 Society of Exploration Geophysicists conference. That year&#x27;s conference was under-attended and their report attracted little attention, with many experts on impact craters and the K–Pg boundary attending the Snowbird conference instead. Carlos Byars, a &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; journalist who was familiar with Penfield and had seen the gravitational and magnetic data himself, wrote a front-page story on Penfield and Camargo&#x27;s claim, but the news did not propagate widely.

Although Penfield had plenty of geophysical data sets, he had no rock cores or other physical evidence of an impact. He knew Pemex had drilled exploratory wells in the region. In 1951, one well bored into what was described as a thick layer of andesite about down. This layer could have resulted from the intense heat and pressure of an Earth impact, but at the time of the borings it was dismissed as a lava dome—a feature uncharacteristic of the region&#x27;s geology. Penfield was encouraged by William C. Phinney, curator of lunar rocks at the Johnson Space Center, to find these samples to support his hypothesis. Penfield tried to secure site samples, but was told they had been lost or destroyed. When attempts to return to the drill sites to look for corroborating rocks proved fruitless, Penfield abandoned his search, published his findings and returned to his Pemex work. Seeing the 1980 &quot;Science&quot; paper, Penfield wrote to Walter Alvarez about the Yucatán structure, but received no response.

Alvarez and other scientists continued their search for the crater, although they were searching in oceans based on incorrect analysis of glassy spherules from the K–Pg boundary that suggested the impactor had landed in open water. Unaware of Penfield&#x27;s discovery, University of Arizona graduate student Alan R. Hildebrand and faculty adviser William V. Boynton looked for a crater near the Brazos River in Texas. Their evidence included greenish-brown clay with surplus iridium, containing shocked quartz grains and small weathered glass beads that looked to be tektites. Thick, jumbled deposits of coarse rock fragments were also present, thought to have been scoured from one place and deposited elsewhere by an impact event. Such deposits occur in many locations but seemed concentrated in the Caribbean Basin at the K–Pg boundary. When Haitian professor Florentine Morás discovered what he thought to be evidence of an ancient volcano on Haiti, Hildebrand suggested it could be a telltale feature of a nearby impact. Tests on samples retrieved from the K–Pg boundary revealed more tektite glass, formed only in the heat of asteroid impacts and high-yield nuclear detonations.

In 1990, Carlos Byars told Hildebrand of Penfield&#x27;s earlier discovery of a possible impact crater. Hildebrand contacted Penfield and the pair soon secured two drill samples from the Pemex wells, which had been stored in New Orleans for decades. Hildebrand&#x27;s team tested the samples, which clearly showed shock-metamorphic materials. A team of California researchers surveying satellite images found a cenote (sinkhole) ring centered on the town of Chicxulub Pueblo that matched the one Penfield saw earlier; the cenotes were thought to be caused by subsidence of bolide-weakened lithostratigraphy around the impact crater wall. More recent evidence suggests the crater is wide, and the ring observed is an inner wall of the larger crater. Hildebrand, Penfield, Boynton, Camargo, and others published their paper identifying the crater in 1991. The crater was named for the nearby town of Chicxulub Pueblo. Penfield also recalled that part of the motivation for the name was &quot;to give the academics and NASA naysayers a challenging time pronouncing it&quot; after years of dismissing its existence.

In March 2010, forty-one experts from many countries reviewed the available evidence: twenty years&#x27; worth of data spanning a variety of fields. They concluded that the impact at Chicxulub triggered the mass extinctions at the K–Pg boundary. Dissenters, notably Gerta Keller of Princeton University, have proposed an alternate culprit: the eruption of the Deccan Traps in what is now the Indian subcontinent. This period of intense volcanism occurred before and after the Chicxulub impact; dissenting studies argue that the worst of the volcanic activity occurred &quot;before&quot; the impact, and the role of the Deccan Traps was instead shaping the evolution of surviving species post-impact. A 2013 study compared isotopes in impact glass from the Chicxulub impact with isotopes in ash from the K–Pg boundary, concluding that they were dated almost exactly the same, and within experimental error.

==Impact specifics==
A 2013 study published in &quot;Science&quot; estimated the age of the impact as 66,043,000 ± 11,000 years ago (± 43,000 years ago considering systematic error), based on multiple lines of evidence, including argon–argon dating of tektites from Haiti and bentonite horizons overlying the impact horizon in northeastern Montana. This date was supported by a 2015 study based on argon–argon dating of tephra found in lignite beds in the Hell Creek and overlying Fort Union formations in northeastern Montana. A 2018 study based on argon–argon dating of spherules from Gorgonilla Island, Colombia, obtained a slightly different result of 66,051,000 ± 31,000 years ago. The impact has been interpreted to have occurred in the Northern Hemisphere&#x27;s spring season based on annual isotope curves in sturgeon and paddlefish bones found in an ejecta-bearing sedimentary unit at the Tanis site in southwestern North Dakota. This sedimentary unit is thought to have formed within hours of impact. A 2020 study concluded that the Chicxulub crater was formed by an inclined (45–60° to horizontal) impact from the northeast. The site of the crater at the time of impact was a marine carbonate platform. The water depth at the impact site varied from on the western edge of the crater to over on the northeastern edge, with an estimated depth at the centre of the impact of approximately . The seafloor rocks consisted of a sequence of Jurassic–Cretaceous marine sediments thick. They were predominantly carbonate rock, including dolomite (35–40% of total sequence) and limestone (25–30%), along with evaporites (anhydrite 25–30%) and minor amounts of shale and sandstone (3–4%) underlain by approximately of continental crust, composed of igneous crystalline basement including granite.

The impactor was around in diameter—large enough that, if set at sea level, it would have reached taller than Mount Everest.

===Effects===

The impactor&#x27;s velocity was estimated at . The kinetic energy of the impact was estimated at . The impact generated winds in excess of near the blast&#x27;s center, and produced a transient cavity wide and deep that later collapsed. This formed a crater mainly under the sea and currently covered by ~ of sediment. The impact, expansion of water after filling the crater, and related seismic activity spawned megatsunamis over tall, with one simulation suggesting the immediate waves from the impact may have reached up to high. The waves scoured the sea floor, leaving ripples underneath what is now Louisiana with average wavelengths of and average wave heights of , the largest ripples documented. Material shifted by subsequent earthquakes and the waves reached to what are now Texas and Florida, and may have disturbed sediments as far as from the impact site. The impact triggered a seismic event with an estimated moment magnitude of 9–11 .

A cloud of hot dust, ash and steam would have spread from the crater, with as much as 25 trillion metric tons of excavated material being ejected into the atmosphere by the blast. Some of this material escaped orbit, dispersing throughout the Solar System, while some of it fell back to Earth, vaporizing upon re-entry. The rock heated Earth&#x27;s surface and ignited wildfires, estimated to have enveloped nearly 70% of the planet&#x27;s forests. The effect on living creatures even hundreds of kilometers away was immense, and much of present-day Mexico and the United States would have been devastated. Fossil evidence for an instantaneous extinction of diverse animals was found in a soil layer only thick in New Jersey, away from the impact site, indicating that death and burial under debris occurred suddenly and quickly over wide distances on nearby land. Field research from the Hell Creek Formation in North Dakota published in 2019 shows the simultaneous mass extinction of myriad species, combined with geological and atmospheric features that are consistent with the impact event.

Due to the relatively shallow water at the impact site, the rock that was vaporized included sulfur-rich gypsum from the lower part of the Cretaceous sequence, and this was injected into the atmosphere. This global dispersal of dust and sulfates would have led to a sudden and catastrophic effect on the climate worldwide, instigating large temperature drops and devastating the food chain. Researchers stated that the impact generated an environmental calamity that extinguished life, but it also induced a vast subsurface hydrothermal system that became an oasis for the recovery of life. Using seismic images of the crater in 2008, scientists determined that the impactor landed in deeper water than previously assumed, which may have resulted in increased sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere as a result of more water vapor being available to react with the vaporized anhydrite. This could have made the impact even deadlier by rapidly cooling the climate and generating acid rain.

The emission of dust and particles could have covered the entire surface of Earth for several years, possibly up to a decade, creating a harsh environment for biological life. Production of carbon dioxide caused by the destruction of carbonate rocks would have led to a sudden greenhouse effect. For over a decade or longer, sunlight would have been blocked from reaching the surface of Earth by the dust particles in the atmosphere, cooling the surface dramatically. Photosynthesis by plants would also have been interrupted, affecting the entire food chain. A model of the event developed by Lomax et al (2001) suggests that net primary productivity rates may have increased to higher than pre-impact levels over the long term because of the high carbon dioxide concentrations.

A long-term local effect of the impact was the creation of the Yucatán sedimentary basin which &quot;ultimately produced favorable conditions for human settlement in a region where surface water is scarce&quot;.

==Post-discovery investigations==
===Geophysical data===
Two seismic reflection datasets have been acquired over the offshore parts of the crater since its discovery. Older 2D seismic datasets have also been used that were originally acquired for hydrocarbon exploration. A set of three long-record 2D lines was acquired in October 1996, with a total length of , by the BIRPS group. The longest of the lines, &quot;Chicx-A&quot;, was shot parallel to the coast, while &quot;Chicx-B&quot; and &quot;Chicx-C&quot; were shot NW–SE and SSW–NNE respectively. In addition to the conventional seismic reflection imaging, data was recorded onshore to allow for wide-angle refraction imaging.

In 2005, another set of profiles was acquired, bringing the total length of the 2D deep-penetration seismic data up to . This survey also used ocean bottom seismometers and land stations to allow 3D travel time inversion to improve the understanding of the velocity structure of the crater. The data was concentrated around the interpreted offshore peak ring to help identify possible drilling locations. At the same time, gravity data was acquired along of profiles. The acquisition was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) with logistical assistance from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and the Centro de Investigación Científica de Yucatán (CICY – Yucatán Center for Scientific Investigation).

===Borehole drilling===
Intermittent core samples from hydrocarbon exploration boreholes drilled by Pemex on the Yucatán peninsula have provided some useful data. UNAM drilled a series of eight fully-cored boreholes in 1995, three of which penetrated deep enough to reach the ejecta deposits outside the main crater rim (UNAM-5, 6, and 7). Between 2001 and 2002, a scientific borehole was drilled near the Hacienda Yaxcopoil, known as &quot;Yaxcopoil-1&quot; (or more commonly Yax-1), to a depth of below the surface, as part of the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program. The borehole was cored continuously, passing through of impactites. Three fully-cored boreholes were also drilled by the Comisión Federal de Electricidad (Federal Electricity Commission) with UNAM. One of them, (BEV-4), was deep enough to reach the ejecta deposits.

In 2016, a joint United Kingdom–United States team obtained the first offshore core samples from the peak ring in the central zone of the crater with the drilling of the borehole known as M0077A, part of Expedition 364 of the International Ocean Discovery Program. The borehole reached below the seafloor.

==Morphology==

The form and structure (geomorphology) of the Chicxulub crater is known mainly from geophysical data. It has a well-defined concentric multi-ring structure. The outermost ring was identified using seismic reflection data. It is up to from the crater center, and is a ring of normal faults, throwing down towards the crater center, marking the outer limit of significant crustal deformation. This makes it one of the three largest impact structures on Earth. Moving toward the center, the next ring is the main crater rim, also known as the &quot;inner rim,&quot; which correlates with a ring of cenotes onshore and a major circular Bouguer gravity gradient anomaly. This ring has a radius that varies between . The next inner ring structure is the peak ring. The area between the inner rim and peak ring is described as the &quot;terrace zone&quot;, characterized by a series of fault blocks defined by normal faults dipping towards the crater center, sometimes referred to as &quot;slump blocks&quot;. The peak ring is about 80 km in diameter and of variable height, above the base of the crater in the west and northwest and in the north, northeast, and east. The central part of the crater lies above a zone where the mantle was uplifted such that the Mohorovičić discontinuity is shallower by about compared to regional values.

The ring structures are best developed to the south, west and northwest, becoming more indistinct towards the north and northeast of the structure. This is interpreted to be a result of variable water depth at the time of impact, with less well-defined rings resulting from the areas with water depths significantly deeper than .

==Geology==

===Pre-impact geology===
Before the impact, the geology of the Yucatán area, sometimes referred to as the &quot;target rocks&quot;, consisted of a sequence of mainly Cretaceous limestones, overlying red beds of uncertain age above an unconformity with the dominantly granitic basement. The basement forms part of the Maya Block and information about its makeup and age in the Yucatán area has come only from drilling results around the Chicxulub crater and the analysis of basement material found as part of the ejecta at more distant K–Pg boundary sites. The Maya block is one of a group of crustal blocks found at the edge of the Gondwana continent. Zircon ages are consistent with the presence of an underlying Grenville age crust, with large amounts of late Ediacaran arc-related igneous rocks, interpreted to have formed in the Pan-African orogeny. Late Paleozoic granitoids (the distinctive &quot;pink granite&quot;) were found in the peak ring borehole M0077A, with an estimated age of 326 ± 5 million years ago (Carboniferous). These have an adakitic composition and are interpreted to represent the effects of slab detachment during the Marathon-Ouachita orogeny, part of the collision between Laurentia and Gondwana that created the Pangaea supercontinent.

Red beds of variable thickness, up to , overlay the granitic basement, particularly in the southern part of the area. These continental clastic rocks are thought to be of Triassic-to-Jurassic age, although they may extend into the Lower Cretaceous. The lower part of the Lower Cretaceous sequence consists of dolomite with interbedded anhydrite and gypsum, with the upper part being limestone, with dolomite and anhydrite in part. The thickness of the Lower Cretaceous varies from up to in the boreholes. The Upper Cretaceous sequence is mainly platform limestone, with marl and interbedded anhydrite. It varies in thickness from up to . There is evidence for a Cretaceous basin within the Yucatán area that has been named the Yucatán Trough, running approximately south–north, widening northwards, explaining the observed thickness variations.

===Impact rocks===
The most common observed impact rocks are suevites, found in many of the boreholes drilled around the Chicxulub crater. Most of the suevites were resedimented soon after the impact by the resurgence of oceanic water into the crater. This gave rise to a layer of suevite extending from the inner part of the crater out as far as the outer rim.

Impact melt rocks are thought to fill the central part of the crater, with a maximum thickness of . The samples of melt rock that have been studied have overall compositions similar to that of the basement rocks, with some indications of mixing with carbonate source, presumed to be derived from the Cretaceous carbonates. An analysis of melt rocks sampled by the M0077A borehole indicates two types of melt rock, an upper impact melt (UIM), which has a clear carbonate component as shown by its overall chemistry and the presence of rare limestone clasts and a lower impact melt-bearing unit (LIMB) that lacks any carbonate component. The difference between the two impact melts is interpreted to be a result of the upper part of the initial impact melt, represented by the LIMB in the borehole, becoming mixed with materials from the shallow part of the crust either falling back into the crater or being brought back by the resurgence forming the UIM.

The &quot;pink granite&quot;, a granitoid rich in alkali feldspar found in the peak ring borehole shows many deformation features that record the extreme strains associated with the formation of the crater and the subsequent development of the peak ring. The granitoid has an unusually low density and P-wave velocity compared to typical granitic basement rocks. Study of the core from M0077A shows the following deformation features in apparent order of development: pervasive fracturing along and through grain boundaries, a high density of shear faults, bands of cataclasite and ultra-cataclasite and some ductile shear structures. This deformation sequence is interpreted to result from initial crater formation involving acoustic fluidization followed by shear faulting with the development of cataclasites with fault zones containing impact melts.

The peak ring drilling below the sea floor also discovered evidence of a massive hydrothermal system, which modified approximately of Earth&#x27;s crust and lasted for hundreds of thousands of years. These hydrothermal systems may provide support for the impact origin of life hypothesis for the Hadean eon, when the entire surface of Earth was affected by impactors much larger than the Chicxulub impactor.

===Post-impact geology===
After the immediate effects of the impact had stopped, sedimentation in the Chicxulub area returned to the shallow water platform carbonate depositional environment that characterised it before the impact. The sequence, which dates back as far as the Paleocene, consists of marl and limestone, reaching a thickness of about . The K–Pg boundary inside the crater is significantly deeper than in the surrounding area.

On the Yucatán peninsula, the inner rim of the crater is marked by clusters of cenotes, which are the surface expression of a zone of preferential groundwater flow, moving water from a recharge zone in the south to the coast through a karstic aquifer system. From the cenote locations, the karstic aquifer is clearly related to the underlying crater rim, possibly through higher levels of fracturing,
caused by differential compaction.

==Astronomical origin and type of impactor==
There is broad consensus that the Chicxulub impactor was a C-type asteroid with a carbonaceous chondrite-like composition, rather than a comet. These types of asteroids originally formed in the outer Solar System, beyond the orbit of Jupiter. In 1998, a meteorite, approximately across, was described from a deep sea sediment core from the North Pacific, from a sediment sequence spanning the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (when the site was located in the central Pacific), with the meteorite being found at the base of the K-Pg boundary iridium anomaly within the sediment core. The meteorite was suggested to represent a fragment of the Chicxulub impactor. Analysis suggested that it best fitted the criteria of the CV, CO and CR groups of carbonaceous chondrites. A 2021 paper suggested, based on geochemical evidence including the excess of chromium isotope 54Cr and the ratios of platinum group metals found in marine impact layers, that the impactor matched the characteristics of CM or CR carbonaceous chondrites. Ruthenium isotope ratios found in impact layers also support a carbonaceous chondrite composition for the impactor.

A 2007 &quot;Nature&quot; report proposed a specific astronomical origin for the Chicxulub asteroid. The authors, William F. Bottke, David Vokrouhlický, and David Nesvorný, argued that a collision in the asteroid belt 160 million years ago between a diameter parent body and another diameter body resulted in the Baptistina family of asteroids, the largest surviving member of which is 298 Baptistina. They proposed that the Chicxulub asteroid was also a member of this group. Subsequent evidence has disproven this theory. A 2009 spectrographic analysis revealed that 298 Baptistina has a different composition more typical of an S-type asteroid than the presumed carbonaceous chondrite composition of the Chicxulub impactor. In 2011, data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer revised the date of the collision which created the Baptistina family to about 80 million years ago, allowing only 15 million years for the process of resonance and collision, which takes many tens of millions of years. In 2010, another hypothesis implicated the newly discovered asteroid 354P/LINEAR, a member of the Flora family, as a possible remnant cohort of the K–Pg impactor. In 2021, a numerical simulation study argued that the impactor likely originated in the outer main part of the asteroid belt.

Some scholars have argued that the impactor was a comet, not an asteroid. Two papers in 1984 proposed it to be a comet originating from the Oort cloud, and it was proposed in 1992 that tidal disruption of comets could potentially increase impact rates. In 2021, Avi Loeb and a colleague suggested in &quot;Scientific Reports&quot; that the impactor was a fragment from a disrupted comet. A rebuttal in &quot;Astronomy &amp; Geophysics&quot; countered that Loeb &quot;et al&quot;. had ignored that the amount of iridium deposited around the globe, , was too large for a comet of the size implied by the crater, and that they had overestimated likely comet impact rates. They concluded that all available evidence strongly favors an asteroid impactor, effectively ruling out a comet. Ruthenium isotope ratios in impact layers also strongly support an asteroid rather than a comet nature for the impactor.

<text>Unterwalden, translated from the Latin &quot;inter silvas&quot; (&quot;between the forests&quot;), is the old name of a forest-canton of the Old Swiss Confederacy in central Switzerland, south of Lake Lucerne, consisting of two valleys or &quot;Talschaften&quot;, now two separate Swiss cantons (or two half-cantons), Obwalden and Nidwalden.

The name &quot;Unterwalden&quot; is first recorded in 1304, as the translation of Latin &quot;inter silvas&quot;, which together with &quot;in intramontanis&quot; was the name for monastery possessions in the area. 
In 1291, Rudolf I of Germany purchased the estates at Stans, Alpnach and Giswil. From 1304, the local bailiffs used their own seal.
In 1309, Henry VII confirmed the imperial immediacy of the territory of Unterwalden as part of the imperial bailiwick of &quot;Waldstätte&quot; (but not as a political entity in its own right). The Federal Charter, internally dated 1291, is thought to originate at this time. In the text, Unterwalden figures as &quot;communitas hominum Intramontanorum Vallis Inferioris&quot; &quot;community of the men between the mountains of the Lower Valley&quot;; this is usually rendered as &quot;the community of the Lower Valley of Unterwalden&quot; in modern translations, and interpreted as Nidwalden or &quot;Unterwalden proper&quot;. Unterwalden was one of the three participants in the foundation of the Old Swiss Confederacy, named in the Pact of Brunnen of 1315 with Uri and Schwyz.

The division of Unterwalden into two separate territories, Obwalden and Nidwalden, in the early period is less than clear. Their status as two independent &quot;Talschaften&quot; appears to develop over the course of the 14th and 15th centuries, while they retain a single vote in the Confederacy. 

The flag of Unterwalden in the 14th and 15th centuries was divided horizontally into equal parts red over white, identical with the flag of Solothurn. After the accession of Solothurn to the Confederacy in 1481, there were two cantons with identical flags, sometimes disambiguated by modifying the design of Solothurn&#x27;s flag. By 1600, Nidwalden was known as Unterwalden proper or &quot;Subsylvania&quot;, while Obwalden was known as &quot;Unterwalden ob dem Wald&quot;, strictly speaking an oxymoron, as it were &quot;Subsylvania super silva&quot;. From this time, there are also two separate coats of arms for the two half-cantons, the red-and-white flag for Unterwalden proper or Nidwalden, while Obwalden had a silver key in a red field.

By the 1640s, these two designs were re-combined in a white-and-red key on a red-and-white field (&quot;per fess gules and argent, a key paleways with double wards counterchanged&quot;) as the coat of arms of the united canton.

In Early Modern Switzerland, Unterwalden counted as a single state in &quot;foreign relations&quot; with the other member states of the Swiss Confederacy, but it consisted of two separate states internally, with separate governments, jurisdictions and separate flags.

Martin Zeiller in 1642 reports Unterwalden as divided in two separate Talschaften the inhabitants of which were derived from separate races, those of Obwalden from the &quot;Romans&quot;, those in Nidwalden from the &quot;Cimbri&quot; (viz. Germans).

Unterwalden was restored in the Act of Mediation (1803) with a single constitution, but with two separate capitals, Sarnen and Stans, and two separate cantonal assemblies with equal sovereignty.

Unterwalden was a canton of the Restored Swiss Confederacy of 1815, and it was listed as a canton in the constitution of 1848, as &quot;Unterwalden (ob und nid dem Wald)&quot;. The name of Unterwalden has been omitted in the 1999 constitution, with &quot;Obwalden und Nidwalden&quot; named as two separate cantons.

John Acton was born on 3 June 1736 at Besançon in France, the son of Edward Acton, an English-born physician who had settled in that town, the great-grandson of Sir Walter Acton, 2nd Baronet (1623–1665) of Aldenham Park, Morville, in Shropshire, England. In 1791, aged 55, John succeeded his second cousin once removed as 6th Baronet.

==Career==
===Service in Tuscany===
He served under his uncle in the navy of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. In 1773, while serving as Captain of the Tuscan frigate &quot;Austria&quot;, he destroyed several vessels in the Gulf of Tunis. While cruising off Tetouan he was informed that two Algerine xebecs and five Salé Rovers were about to enter the Mediterranean. On 14 October he observed off Cape Spartel, two vessels making for the straits; one hove to under the Cape, apparently awaiting her consort with whom she was exchanging signals, but a thick fog concealed her for three hours: when it cleared off she was nearly within gun-shot, the Salé flag flying, a signal up, and everything ready for action. Acton immediately ran her within half musket-shot and poured in a fire of all arms; she struck her colours and was taken after a feeble resistance without aid from her consort. She mounted 24 guns, and the remains of her crew, amounting to 80 prisoners, were sent to the &quot;Austria&quot;.

After securing this prize Acton gave chase to the second frigate and ran her ashore near Algiers, but in waiting for a favourable moment to complete his work another Salé frigate and two xebecs bore down on him. After a short chase the frigate was driven ashore by the &quot;Austria&quot; and destroyed with two broadsides. Acton then chased one xebec off the port of Larache and opened fire, but under cover of the batteries she got safely in. The second frigate was also of 24 guns, the xebecs of 23 and 16 guns each, but the second escaped while the other was engaged with Acton. He afterwards discovered that they formed one squadron, and had left Larache to capture the &quot;Austria&quot;, but not a single Tuscan seaman was killed or wounded throughout the campaign.

In 1775 he commanded the Tuscan frigates in the Spanish-Tuscan Invasion of Algiers along with Irish general Alejandro O&#x27;Reilly. Concerning the calamitous disembarkation in which the Spanish were drawn into a trap by the feigned retreat of the Algerines, the travel writer Henry Swinburne wrote that the Spaniards would have been &quot;broken and slaughtered to a man ... had not Mr. Acton, the Tuscan commander, cut his cables and let his ships drive in to shore just as the enemy was coming on us full gallop. The incessant fire of his great guns, loaded with grape-shot, not only stop&#x27;t them in their career but obliged them to retire with great loss.&quot;

===Service in Naples===
In 1779 Queen Maria Carolina of Naples persuaded her brother the Grand-Duke Leopold of Tuscany to allow Acton, who had been recommended to her by Prince Caramanico, to undertake the reorganisation of the Neapolitan navy. The ability displayed by him in this led to his rapid advancement. He became commander-in-chief of both the army and the navy of the Kingdom of Naples, minister of finance, and finally prime minister.

His policy, devised in concert with Sir William Hamilton, the English ambassador to Naples, aimed at removing Spanish influence from Naples and replacing it with that of Britain and Austria. The policy led to open opposition to France and the French party in Italy.

The Neapolitan fleet, which when Acton entered the service of Naples had been practically non-existent, he had built up by 1798 to 120 ships with 1,200 cannon, while the land forces had increased fourfold from 15 to 60 thousand. Unfortunately in no degree were the interests of Naples promoted by the vainglorious policy thus inaugurated, which speedily resulted in disaster. Although Acton had aimed to extend the commerce of the country by increasing the facilities of internal communication and restoring some of the principal ports, the increased taxation required to support the army and navy more than counter-balanced these efforts and caused acute distress and general discontent. The introduction of foreign officers into the services, which had aroused the resentment of the upper classes, was further augmented when the fleet was placed under the orders of the British Admiral Horatio Nelson.

Although Nelson and the British fleet had extinguished French naval power in the Mediterranean by his victory at the Battle of the Nile in August 1798, thereby saving the Kingdom of Naples from naval conquest by Revolutionary France, the French armies entered the north of Italy, where they met successes. In response in December 1798 the King and Queen, together with Acton, Hamilton (and his wife Lady Emma Hamilton), by order of Nelson were evacuated from Naples on board &quot;HMS Vanguard&quot; to the King&#x27;s Sicilian capital of Palermo. Thereupon, freed of the royal presence, the Neapolitan citizens and nobles sympathetic to the ideals of the French Revolution promptly established the short-lived Parthenopean Republic, with the aid of the French. However the monarchy was restored in Naples five months later with the help of a Calabrian army, called the &quot;Sanfedisti&quot;, led by Cardinal Ruffo. To re-establish order and with the consent of the Queen and the help of Ruffo, Acton established at Naples the &quot;Junta of State&quot;, a reign of terror during which many prominent citizens were thrown into prison or executed. 

In 1804 Acton was removed from power, on the demand of France, but nevertheless advised the king, who had agreed to an alliance with Napoleon, to permit British and Russian troops to land at Naples. Acton was granted a pension of 3000 ducats and was created Duke of Modica, which he later renounced. Shortly afterwards the minister was recalled, but when the French entered Naples in 1806, he together with the royal family again took refuge in Sicily.

A letter of 25 July 1809 reported that Acton had &quot;returned a few days since from the baths of Termina, not in the least benefited by their waters. The painful effects of a paralytic stroke, and a severe fall last year, are now aggravated by a nearly total deprivation of sight.&quot;

==Succession to baronetcy==
In 1791, aged 55, he succeeded to the Acton baronetcy and estates on the death of his second cousin once removed, Sir Richard Acton, 5th Baronet of Aldenham Park in Shropshire.

==Marriage and issue==

On 2 February 1800, at the age of 63, he married his 13 year-old niece Mary Ann Acton (1786-1873), the eldest daughter of his younger brother General Joseph Edward Acton (1737-1830) and his wife, Marie Eleonore Berghe von Trips (1769-1848), sister-in-law of Louis, Landgrave of Hesse-Philippsthal. The marriage appears to have been made for dynastic purposes to keep control of the family&#x27;s wealth and required papal dispensation due to consanguinity. On hearing the news Nelson commented &quot;it is never too late to do well&quot; and following his arrival in Naples threw a party for the newlyweds aboard his flagship, the &quot;Foudroyant&quot;. &quot;By raising the awning twenty feet, removing the guns, and robing the masts in silk, two spacious rooms were given, and these were most splendidly decorated; and when lighted up in the evening, really presented a fairy-like appearance, while the music that floated over the calm waters of this beautiful bay was softened. All the nobles of the court, with the exception of the king and queen, were there&quot;. The festivities were somewhat marred when a drunk English Lieutenant accidentally knocked an Italian princess into the water (on emerging she furiously demanded he be hanged from the foreyard arm).

By his wife he had three children:
*Sir Ferdinand Richard Edward Dalberg-Acton, 7th Baronet (1801–1837), eldest son and heir, whose son was John Emerich Edward Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton, 13th Marquess of Groppoli.
*Charles Januarius Edward Cardinal Acton (1803–1847)
*Elizabeth Acton (1806–1850), who married Sir Robert Throckmorton, 8th Baronet, of Coughton Court, Warwickshire, and had issue.

==Death, burial &amp; monument==

He died at Palermo on 12 August 1811, aged 75, and a &quot;magnificent funeral was prepared for him; but during the procession, so tremendous a shower of rain came on, that the body remained abandoned in the street for a long time.&quot;

Acton was buried in the church of Santa Ninfa dei Crociferi, where survives his wall monument, displaying sculpted (all in relief) his bust within a laurel circlet and antique trophy of arms above a pedimented sarcophagus in the form of a double-bodied winged Sphinx, inscribed in Latin as follows:
:&quot;DOM hic jacet Joannes Acton Angliae dynasta vere egenorum pater. Obiit pridie idus sextilis Anno Domini MDCCCXI aetatis suae LXXV&quot; (&quot;To the greatest and best God. Here lies John Acton, from a dynasty of England, truly the father of the needy. He died on the first day of the Ides of the Sixth Month (i.e of the Roman year commencing in March, thus August) in the year of our Lord 1811, (in the year) of his age 75&quot;).

It opened on 2 July 2017 as part of the Waterview Connection, carrying three lanes of northbound and southbound traffic as part of Auckland&#x27;s Western Ring Route. 
;On other roads
*Okaihau, a short tunnel north of Okaihau constructed for the Okaihau Branch railway, which is now part of the Opua to Horeke Cycleway.

==Proposed or planned ==

===Road===
*Kaimai road tunnel – A tunnel through the Kaimai Range in order to provide a better roading connection between the Waikato and Bay of Plenty regions has been proposed. One option for this tunnel includes building it near the existing Kaimai Rail Tunnel. 
* Wainuiomata Tunnel, part of a proposed road link between the Hutt Valley, north of Wellington, and Wainuiomata. Eventually completed as a utility tunnel.

===Rail===
*Auckland City Rail Link, Auckland. These are paired 3.5 km rail tunnels under construction beneath the Auckland CBD between Britomart and Mt Eden. Construction began in 2016 and is scheduled to be completed in 2025.

===Mixed Use===
*Second Harbour Crossing in Auckland, likely to be a tunnel option that could incorporate the Victoria Park Tunnel. While historically a road tunnel was seen as a priority, the present plans are likely to prioritise rail first due to capacity issues of the Northern Busway.

<doc id="174637" wikidata="Q1509726" url="?curid=174637" title="Ger (Hasidic dynasty)">
<text>Ger (Yiddish: , also Gur, adj. Gerrer) is a Polish Hasidic dynasty originating from the town of Góra Kalwaria, Poland, where it was founded by Yitzchak Meir Alter (1798–1866), known as the &quot;Chiddushei HaRim&quot;. Ger is a branch of Peshischa Hasidism, as Yitzchak Meir Alter was a leading disciple of Simcha Bunim of Peshischa (1765–1827). Before the Holocaust, followers of Ger were estimated to number in excess of 100,000, making it the largest and most influential Hasidic group in Poland. Today, the movement is based in Jerusalem, and its membership is estimated at 11,859 families, as of 2016, most of whom live in Israel, making Ger the largest Hasidic dynasty in Israel. However, there are also well-established Ger communities in the United States and in Europe. In 2019, some 300 families of followers led by Shaul Alter, split off from the dynasty led by his cousin Yaakov Aryeh Alter. 

== History ==

In his early years, Yitzchak Meir Alter became a close disciple of Simcha Bunim of Peshischa, who preached the ideals of Talmudic rationalism and the pursuit of personal authenticity—later foundational tenets of Ger Hasidism. After Simcha Bunim died in 1827, Yitzchak Meir Alter was among his more radical supporters who followed Menachem Mendel of Kotzk (the &quot;Kotzker Rebbe&quot;) rather than Simcha Bunim&#x27;s son, Avraham Moshe. The Kotzker Rebbe continued in the ideological tradition of Peshischa, and after he died in 1859, most of his followers accepted Yitzchak Meir Alter as his successor rather than his son, Dovid. Yitzchak Meir Alter was living in Warsaw at the time and operated a Kotzker &quot;shtiebel&quot;. Shortly after accepting the role of Rebbe, Yitzchak Meir was appointed as the &quot;Av Beit Din&quot; of Góra Kalwaria (), where he established his own Hasidic court. After his death in 1866, his followers wanted his eighteen-year-old grandson, Yehudah Aryeh Leib Alter, to succeed him. When Yehuda Aryeh Leib refused to accept this position, most of the Hasidim became followers of the elderly Hasid Chanokh Heynekh HaKohen Levin, after whose death Yehudah Aryeh Leib acceded to the request of the Hasidim to become their next rebbe. The Gerrer movement flourished under the leadership of Yehudah Aryeh Leib and his eldest son and successor, Avraham Mordechai Alter, known as the &quot;Imrei Emes&quot;. In 1926, in a bold departure for Polish Hasidim, Avraham Mordechai established a yeshiva in Jerusalem, naming it for his father, the &quot;Sfas Emes&quot;. The first &quot;rosh yeshiva&quot; was Rabbi Nechemiah Alter, a brother of the Imrei Emes. Today, the yeshiva remains the flagship of the Ger yeshivas. Under the leadership of the fifth Gerrer Rebbe, Yisrael Alter, known as the &quot;Beis Yisrael&quot;, the &quot;Ichud Mosdos Gur&quot; (or Union of Gerrer Institutions) was established as the responsible body for funding all the educational institutions affiliated with Ger in Israel. There are about 100 such institutions. The Beis Yisrael helped rebuild the Ger movement after its virtual destruction in World War II. 
== Distribution of Gerrer Hasidim ==
Almost all Ger Hasidim living in pre-war Europe (approximately 100,000 Hasidim) were murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust. Avraham Mordechai Alter, who managed to escape, set about the task of rebuilding the movement in the British Mandate of Palestine. Under its post-war leaders, the movement began to flourish again. With approximately 12,000 families, Ger is the third-largest Hasidic dynasty in the world today, comprising 9.2% of the world population of Hasidim. Large communities of Gerrer Hasidim exist in Israel, in Bnei Brak (2294 families / 19% of the Hasidic population), Ashdod (2218 families / 45%), and Jerusalem (1921 families / 12%), and a slightly smaller community of 1,027 families (6% of the Hasidic population) exists in the Borough Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. Smaller communities with hundreds of families have also been established in Israel, such as Arad, Beit Shemesh, Kiryat Gat, Hatzor HaGlilit, Haifa, Dimona, Tel Aviv, and Petah Tikva. Internationally, hundreds of families reside in London, Antwerp, Zürich (where they are the largest Hasidic group), Manchester, Monsey, and Lakewood, with tens more living in Los Angeles, Queens, Montreal, Melbourne, and Chicago. Ger maintains a well-developed educational network of Talmud Torahs, yeshivas, and kollels, as well as Beis Yaakov schools for girls. The dynasty is the wealthiest in Israel, and its leaders dominate the Agudat Israel political party.

== Center ==

The group&#x27;s headquarters is located in Jerusalem. During and after the British Mandate, the group&#x27;s beth midrash was at the Sfas Emes Yeshiva, near Mahane Yehuda. Later on, the synagogue moved to Ralbach Street in the Geula neighborhood, and in the late 1990s, the Great Beth Midrash Gur was inaugurated on Yirmeyahu Street, near the Schneller Orphanage complex. In 2015, an extension to the building was begun, and on Rosh Hashanah 2018 (5779), the second wing of the Beth Medrash was inaugurated. In 2022, the building was finished when the two wings were joined, making it the largest synagogue in the world, with the main sanctuary seating up to 20,000, and having an area of approximately . 

Beginning with the emigration of Avraham Mordechai Alter to Israel, the rebbes of Ger lived in Jerusalem, with the exception of the current Rebbe Yaakov Aryeh Alter, who moved to Jerusalem only in 2012. The group has &quot;shtibelekh&quot; in most ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods in the city. As other Hasidic courts, Ger also expanded in Jerusalem following the immigration of young couples from Europe and the United States.

== Identifying features of Ger ==

The men are distinguished by their dark Hasidic garb, and by their pants tucked into their socks, called &quot;hoyzn-zokn&quot; (not to be confused with the breeches, called &quot;halber-hoyzn&quot;, worn by men in some other Hasidic groups). They wear a round felt hat, and a high, almost-pointed kapel. They raise their sidelocks from the temples, and tuck them under the yarmulke, nearly hiding them. On Shabbos and Jewish holidays, married men wear the high circular fur hat of the Polish Hasidim, called a &quot;spodik&quot; by Galicianers (not to be confused with the much flatter shtreimel worn by married men in Hasidic groups which do not hail from Congress Poland). Ger has produced some of the most prolific composers of Jewish liturgical music of all time, such as Yankel Talmud (1885–1965), who was known as &quot;the Beethoven of the Gerrer Rebbes&quot;.

==Kehilas Pnei Menachem==
In October 2019, a group of Gerrer Hasidim under the leadership of Shaul Alter split from the main hassidic court, forming a new kehilla: &quot;Kehilas Pnei Menachem&quot;. The split, the first in Ger&#x27;s history, followed two decades of repeated tensions between Alter, son of the former Gerrer Rebbe, and his cousin, the current one—tensions which only increased when the latter closed the prestigious yeshiva where Alter was Rosh Yeshiva in 2016, then failed to invite him to his grandson&#x27;s wedding in 2019. On 22 October 2019, Alter held a public Sukkot event, where donations and school enrollment forms for the new group were passed out, marking the split. 

On November 8, 2021, the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot; reported that Kehilas Pnei Menachem numbers some 500 families in Israel, with another 300 in the USA, while the mainstream Gur community in Israel is thought to number as many as 100,000 people (the equivalent of 11,494 families, according to a November 2021 report by Israel&#x27;s National Economic Council which averages 6.7 children per Haredi family).

In May 2022 violent clashes erupted between Hasidim of both communities in Ashdod, Bnei Brak and Jerusalem. Hundreds of men stormed Alter&#x27;s yeshiva, and he had to be escorted home by police.

== &quot;Takanot&quot; ==
Ger is known as having the strictest views among Orthodox Jews regarding sexual relations. In 1948, Rabbi Yisrael Alter established the &quot;Ordinances on Holiness&quot;, known as the &quot;takanot&quot; (called &quot;takunes&quot; in the vernacular of Yiddish used by Ger Hasidim), which regulate daily living. The rules were passed on verbally, and were never written down until 2016, when a former member of the Ger Hasidic sect published them on Facebook. The &quot;takanot&quot; prescribe, for example, that a couple should not have sex more than twice a month, should do so silently and quickly, and the man should always be on top. 

In 2009, a Gerrer woman, Sarah Einfeld, appeared in a short documentary film, titled in English &quot;Shrew&quot; (in Hebrew, &quot;Soreret&quot;). During the filming, she decided to desert Ger, and to adopt a secular way of life. In her blog, she reported on the &quot;repression&quot; of women in Ger, highlighting the suppression of sexuality under the regime of these rules.

<text>Skull and Bones (also known as The Order, Order 322 or The Brotherhood of Death) is an undergraduate senior secret student society at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. The oldest senior-class society at the university, Skull and Bones has become a cultural institution known for its powerful alumni and conspiracy theories.

Skull and Bones is considered one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; societies at Yale University; the other are Scroll and Key and Wolf&#x27;s Head. The society is known informally as &quot;Bones&quot;, and members are known as &quot;Bonesmen&quot;, &quot;Members of The Order&quot; or &quot;Initiated to The Order&quot;.

== History ==
===19th century===
Skull and Bones was founded in 1832 after a dispute among Yale debating societies Linonia, Brothers in Unity, and the Calliopean Society over that season&#x27;s Phi Beta Kappa awards. William Huntington Russell and Alphonso Taft co-founded &quot;The Order of the Skull and Bones&quot;. The first senior members included Russell, Taft, and thirteen other members. Alternative names for Skull and Bones are The Order, Order 322 and The Brotherhood of Death.

The first extended description of Skull and Bones, published in 1871 by Lyman Bagg in his book &quot;Four Years at Yale&quot;, noted that &quot;the mystery now attending its existence forms the one great enigma which college gossip never tires of discussing.&quot;

In a 1974 book, Brooks Mather Kelley attributed the interest in Yale senior societies to the fact that underclassmen members of then freshman, sophomore, and junior class societies returned to campus the following years and could share information about society rituals, while graduating seniors were, with their knowledge of such, at least a step removed from campus life.

Since its founding, Skull and Bones annually selects 15 members of the junior class to join the society. Skull and Bones selects new members among students every spring as part of Yale University&#x27;s &quot;Tap Day&quot;, and has done so since 1879. It taps those that it views as campus leaders and other notable figures for its membership.

===20th century===
In the 1960s, secret societies adapted in response to criticism for elitism and discrimination. Skull and Bones admitted its first black member in 1965, and the president of Yale&#x27;s gay student organization in 1975.

Yale became coeducational in 1969, prompting some other secret societies such as St. Anthony Hall to transition to co-ed membership, yet Skull and Bones remained fully male until 1992. The Bones class of 1971&#x27;s attempt to tap women for membership was opposed by Bones alumni, who dubbed them the &quot;bad club&quot; and quashed their attempt. &quot;The issue&quot;, as it came to be called by Bonesmen, was debated for decades.

The class of 1991 tapped seven female members for membership in the next year&#x27;s class, causing conflict with the alumni association. The trust changed the locks on the Tomb and the Bonesmen instead met in the Manuscript Society building. A mail-in vote by members decided 368–320 to permit women in the society, but a group of alumni led by William F. Buckley obtained a temporary restraining order to block the move, arguing that a formal change in bylaws was needed. Other alumni, such as John Kerry and R. Inslee Clark, Jr., spoke out in favor of admitting women. The dispute was highlighted on an editorial page of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. A second alumni vote, in October 1991, agreed to accept the Class of 1992, and the lawsuit was dropped.

===21st century===
In recent years, Skull and Bones, like other elite Yale institutions, &quot;utterly transformed&quot;, according to &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. The society tapped its first entirely non-white class in 2020. Few descendants of alumni get in, and progressive activism is an asset. The class of 2021 admitted no conservatives.

== Symbols and traditions ==
The society&#x27;s badge is gold and consists of a skull that is supported by crossed bones, with the number 322 on the lower jaw. Its members worshipped Eulogia, a fictional goddess of eloquence.

The number &quot;322&quot; appears in Skull and Bones&#x27; insignia and is widely reported to be significant as the year of Greek orator Demosthenes&#x27; death. A letter between early society members in Yale&#x27;s archives suggests that 322 is a reference to the year 322 BC and that members measure dates from this year instead of from the anno domini. In 322 BC, the Lamian War ended with the death of Demosthenes and Athenians were made to dissolve their government and establish a plutocratic system in its stead, whereby only those possessing 2,000 drachmas or more could remain citizens. Documents in the Tomb have purportedly been found dated to &quot;Anno-Demostheni.&quot;

One legend is that the number represents &quot;founded in &#x27;32, 2nd corps&quot;, referring to a first Corps in an unknown German university. Another possible reference of 322 is the Freemasonic Lodge of Virtue and Silence no. 322, in Suffolk, UK, signaling a fraternal but unspoken sponsorship between the two &quot;secret society&quot; organizations, regarding which silence is considered virtuous. Lodge 322 was founded in 1811, 21 years before the creation of the Skull and Bones association in 1832.

===Crooking===

Skull and Bones has a reputation for stealing keepsakes from other Yale societies or campus buildings; society members reportedly call the practice &quot;crooking&quot; and strive to outdo each other&#x27;s &quot;crooks&quot;. The society has been accused of possessing the stolen skulls of Martin Van Buren, Geronimo, and Pancho Villa. In January 2010, Christie&#x27;s canceled a planned auction for a human skull with links to Skull and Bones.
== Facilities ==

===Tomb===
The Skull and Bones Hall, located at 64 High St. in New Haven, Connecticut, is otherwise known as the &quot;Tomb&quot;. The building was built in three phases: the first wing was built in 1856, the second wing in 1903, and Davis-designed Neo-Gothic towers were added to the rear garden in 1912. The front and side facades are of Portland brownstone in an Egypto-Doric style. The 1912 tower additions created a small enclosed courtyard in the rear of the building, designed by Evarts Tracy and Edgerton Swartwout of Tracy and Swartwout, New York. Evarts Tracy was an 1890 Bonesman, and his paternal grandmother, Martha Sherman Evarts, and maternal grandmother, Mary Evarts, were the sisters of William Maxwell Evarts, an 1837 Bonesman.

The architect was possibly Alexander Jackson Davis or Henry Austin. Architectural historian Patrick Pinnell includes an in-depth discussion of the dispute over the identity of the original architect in his 1999 Yale campus history. Pinnell speculates that the re-use of the Davis towers in 1911 suggests Davis&#x27;s role in the original building and, conversely, Austin was responsible for the architecturally similar brownstone Egyptian Revival Grove Street Cemetery gates, built-in 1845. Pinnell also discusses the Tomb&#x27;s esthetic place about its neighbors, including the Yale University Art Gallery. In the late 1990s, New Hampshire landscape architects Saucier and Flynn designed the wrought iron fence that surrounds a portion of the complex.

===Deer Island===

The society owns and manages Deer Island, an island retreat on the St. Lawrence River (). Alexandra Robbins, author of a book on Yale secret societies, wrote:

Bonesmen spend a week in the late summer getting to know each other at Deer Island.

== Russell Trust Association ==
The Russell Trust Association is the business name of Skull and Bones Society. It was incorporated in 1856 by William Huntington Russell as president and Daniel Coit Gilman as treasurer. The association holds the society&#x27;s assets, including its endowment and property, and oversees property upkeep.

According to its 2016 filing with the IRS, the Russell Trust Association, filing as RTA Incorporated, has assets of $3,906,458, including Deer Island and the Skull and Bones Hall.

As of 2024, the organization had an endowment of $17 million.

==Notable members==
Skull and Bones&#x27; membership developed a reputation in association with the &quot;power elite&quot;. Regarding the qualifications for membership, Lanny Davis wrote in the 1968 Yale yearbook:
Like other Yale senior societies, Skull and Bones&#x27;s membership was almost exclusively limited to white Protestant men for much of its history. While Yale had exclusionary policies directed at particular ethnic and religious groups, the senior societies were even more exclusionary. While some Catholics were able to join such groups, Jews were more often not. Some of these excluded groups eventually entered Skull and Bones using sports, through the society&#x27;s practice of tapping standout athletes. Star football players tapped for Skull and Bones included the first Jewish player (Al Hessberg, class of 1938) and African-American player (Levi Jackson, class of 1950), although Jackson declined the tap, instead electing to join Berzelius.

Judith Ann Schiff, Chief Research Archivist at the Yale University Library, has written: &quot;The names of its members weren&#x27;t kept secretthat was an innovation of the 1970sbut its meetings and practices were.&quot; While resourceful researchers could assemble member data from these sources, in 1985, Charlotte Thomson Iserbyt provided Antony C. Sutton with rosters and records that had belonged to her father, a member of the organization. This membership information was kept privately for over fifteenyears, as Sutton feared that the photocopied pages could somehow identify the member who leaked it. He wrote a book on the group, &quot;America&#x27;s Secret Establishment: An Introduction to the Order of Skull and Bones&quot;. The information was finally reformatted as an appendix in the book &quot;Fleshing out Skull and Bones&quot;, a compilation edited by Kris Millegan and published in 2003.

Among prominent alumni are former presidents William Howard Taft (a founder&#x27;s son), George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush. In the 2004 U.S. Presidential election, both the Democratic and Republican nominees were members of Skull and Bones. When asked what it meant that he and George W. Bush were both Bonesmen, former presidential candidate John Kerry said, &quot;Not much, because it&#x27;s a secret.&quot;

Members are assigned nicknames. Examples include &quot;Long Devil&quot;, the tallest member, &quot;Boaz&quot;, a varsity football captain, or &quot;Sherrife&quot;, prince of the future. Many of the chosen names are drawn from literature (e.g., &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Uncle Remus&quot;) religion, and myth. The banker Lewis Lapham passed on his nickname, &quot;Sancho Panza&quot;, to the political adviser Tex McCrary. Averell Harriman was &quot;Thor&quot;, Henry Luce was &quot;Baal&quot;, McGeorge Bundy was &quot;Odin&quot;, and George H. W. Bush was &quot;Magog&quot;.

==Popular culture==
=== Literature and print ===
* Tom Wolfe mentions Skull and Bones in his 1976 book, &quot;The Me Decade&quot;, writing, &quot;At Yale the students on the outside wondered for 80 years what went on inside the fabled secret senior societies, such as Skull and Bones. On Thursday nights one would see the secret society members walking silently and single file, in black flannel suits, white shirts, and black knit ties with gold pins on them, toward their great Greek Revival temples on the campus, buildings whose mystery was doubled by the fact that they had no windows.&quot;
* Skull and Bones have been satirized from time to time in the &quot;Doonesbury&quot; comic strips by Garry Trudeau, Yale graduate and Scroll and Key member. There are overt references, especially in 1980 and December 1988, concerning George H. W. Bush, and again when the society first admitted women.
* George W. Bush wrote in his autobiography, &quot;[In my] senior year I joined Skull and Bones, a secret society; so secret, I can&#x27;t say anything more.&quot;
* Leigh Bardugo explores the secret societies of Yale, including Skull and Bones, in her dark fantasy horror novel Ninth House.

=== Film ===
* &quot;The Skulls&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Skulls II&quot; (2002) films are based on the conspiracy theories surrounding Skull and Bones. A third film, &quot;The Skulls III&quot; (2004), is based on the first woman to be &quot;tapped&quot; to join the society.
* In &quot;The Good Shepherd&quot; (2006) the protagonist becomes a member of Skull and Bones while studying at Yale.
* In Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s 2013 film version of F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, Nick Carraway calls Tom Buchanan &quot;Boaz&quot;. Tom in turn calls Nick &quot;Shakespeare&quot;. Nick said earlier that he met Tom at Yale. It is thereby implied that they were in Skull and Bones together. In the novel, Yale is not explicitly mentioned (rather, they were at college in New Haven together) and it is only stated that they were in the same senior society.

=== Television ===
* In Season 1, Episode 33 of the 1966 &quot;Batman&quot; TV series, &quot;Fine Finny Fiends&quot; there is a gathering at Wayne Manor during which one guest points out a portrait of Bruce Wayne&#x27;s great-grandfather wearing a Yale sweater. He asks if it is true that Bruce&#x27;s ancestor was tapped for Skull and Bones, to which Aunt Harriet replies that he was not tapped for it, but &quot;he &quot;founded&quot; Skull and Bones!&quot;
* In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; season 8 episode &quot;The Canine Mutiny&quot; (1997), after doing a secret handshake with a dog, Mr. Burns says: &quot;I believe this dog was in Skull and Bones&quot;.
* In &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode, &quot;No Chris Left Behind&quot;, (2007) when Chris Griffin is being bullied by the richer students at Morningwood Academy, Lois Griffin asks her father, Carter Pewterschmidt, to help Chris. So Carter invites Chris to join Skull and Bones with the other students, who begin to accept him. As part of his initiation, Carter and Chris adopt an orphan and lock him out of the car, which is filled with toys and a puppy, and then drive away when he is unable to get in. At the initiation ceremony, Carter tells Chris that he must spend &quot;Seven minutes in heaven&quot; with their most senior member, Herbert. Chris feels uncomfortable about joining and convinces Carter to help him get back into his old school.
* On &quot;Meet The Press&quot;, Tim Russert asked both President George W. Bush and John Kerry about their memberships to Skull and Bones, to which the president replied, &quot;It&#x27;s so secret we can&#x27;t talk about it.&quot; Kerry replied, &quot;You trying to get rid of me here?&quot;
* In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; season 28 episode &quot;The Caper Chase&quot; (2017), Mr. Burns visits the Skull and Bones society to meet with Bourbon Verlander about for-profit universities.
* In &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; season 2 episode &quot;New Heaven Can Wait&quot; (2008), Chuck Bass is kidnapped by Skull and Bones members while visiting Yale. They make him pass a series of tests to assess his loyalty as they think Chuck is the ideal Skull and Bones candidate. Chuck eventually declines the offer and tricks them into performing illegal acts while filming them in order to have blackmail leverage in case he ever needs something from them in the future.

<text>Samael (; , &quot;Sammāʾēl&quot;, &quot;Venom of God&quot;; , &quot;Samsama&#x27;il&quot; or , &quot;Samail&quot;; alternatively Smal, Smil, Samil, or Samiel) is an archangel in Talmudic and post-Talmudic tradition; a figure who is the accuser or adversary (Satan in the Book of Job), seducer, and destroying angel (in the Book of Exodus).

Although many of his functions resemble the Christian notion of Satan, to the point of being sometimes identified as a fallen angel, he is not necessarily evil, since his functions are also regarded as resulting in good, such as destroying sinners.

He is considered in Midrashic texts to be a member of the heavenly host with often grim and destructive duties. One of Samael&#x27;s most significant roles in Jewish lore is that of the main angel of death and the head of &quot;satans&quot;. Although he condemns man&#x27;s sins, he remains one of God&#x27;s servants. He appears frequently in the story of the Garden of Eden and engineered the fall of Adam and Eve with a snake in writings during the Second Temple period. However, the serpent is not a form of Samael, but a beast he rode like a camel. In a single account he is also believed to be the father of Cain, as well as the partner of Lilith. In early Talmudic and Midrashic literature, he has not yet been identified with Satan. Only in later Midrashim is he entitled &quot;head of satans.&quot;

As guardian angel and prince of Rome, he is the archenemy of Israel. By the beginning of Jewish culture in Europe, Samael had been established as a representative of Christianity due to his identification with Rome.

In some Gnostic cosmologies, Samael&#x27;s role as a source of evil became identified with the Demiurge, the creator of the material world. Although probably both accounts originate from the same source, the Gnostic development of Samael differs from the Jewish development of Samael, in which Samael is merely an angel and messenger of God.

== Judaism ==
=== Second Temple period and posteriority ===

Samael was first mentioned during the Second Temple period and immediately after its destruction. He is first mentioned in the Book of Enoch, which is a part of the Jewish apocrypha, along with other rebellious angels. In Enoch 1, he is one of the Watchers who descended to Earth to copulate with human women, although he is not their leader, this being Samyaza.

In the Greek Apocalypse of Baruch, he is the dominant evil figure. Samael plants the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thereupon he is banished and cursed by God. To take revenge, he tempts Adam and Eve into sin by taking the form of the serpent.

He appears further as the embodiment of evil in the &quot;Ascension of Isaiah&quot; and is called by various names:
* &quot;Melkira&quot; , &quot;king of evil/wicked&quot;
* &quot;Malkira&quot; / &quot;Malchira&quot; , &quot;Messenger of evil&quot;
* &quot;Belkira&quot; prob. , &quot;lord of the wall&quot;
* &quot;Bechira&quot; , &quot;elect/chosen of evil
The names Belial and Satan are also applied to him, and he gains control of King Manasseh to accuse Isaiah of treason.

===Talmudic-Midrashic literature===
In Talmudic and midrash, Samael&#x27;s role as an agent of evil is relatively marginal. However, from the fifth or sixth century onward, he becomes one of the most prominent among the demonic entities. Samael has not been identified with the angel of death in the Talmud.

In the Exodus Rabbah, Samael is depicted as the accuser in the heavenly court and tempter to sin, while Michael defends Israel&#x27;s actions. Here, Samael is identified with Satan. While &quot;Satan&quot; describes his function as an &quot;accuser,&quot; Samael is considered his proper name. He also fulfills the role of the Angel of Death when he comes to take the body of Moses and is called the leader of Satan.

The title of &quot;satan&quot; is also applied to him in the midrash &quot;Pirkei De-Rabbi Eliezer&quot;, where he is the chief of the fallen angels, and a twelve-winged seraph. According to the text, Samael opposed the creation of Adam and descended to Earth to tempt him into evil. Riding the serpent, he convinces Eve to eat the forbidden fruit. His role here might be similar to the Islamic idea of Iblis, who refused to prostrate himself before Adam because he consists of fire and Adam merely from dust. The midrash also reveals Samael fathered Cain with Eve.

In the smaller midrashim, he is the ruler of hell. Several sources, such as &quot;Yalkut Shimoni&quot; (I, 110) describe him as the guardian angel of Esau relating him to Rome, the one who wrestled with Jacob, the angel who ordered Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, and a patron of Edom.

===Kabbalah===
In Kabbalah, Samael is described as the &quot;severity of God&quot; and is listed as fifth of the archangels of the world of Beri&#x27;ah. Among his portions are Esau, the people who inherit the sword and bring war; the goats and se&#x27;irim (demons); and the destroyer angels.

Although both Samael and Lilith are major demons in earlier Jewish traditions, they do not appear paired until the second half of the thirteenth century, when they are introduced together. Lilith is a demon created alongside Adam, originally created for the role Eve would fill, who then becomes Samael&#x27;s bride. With her, Samael created a host of demon children, including a son, the &quot;Sword of Samael&quot; (or of Asmodai).

In the Kabbalistic work &quot;Treatise on the Left Emanation&quot;, Samael is part of the qlippoth, prince of all demons, and spouse of Lilith. The two are said to parallel Adam and Eve, being emanated together from the Throne of Glory as a counterpart. Asmodeus is also mentioned to be subservient to Samael and married to a younger or alternate, lesser Lilith. According to the treatise (secondary source) which is unconfirmed, God castrated Samael in order not to fill the world with their demonic offspring.

In the Zohar, one of Kabbalah&#x27;s principal works, Samael is described as a leader of the divine forces of destruction, part of the qlippoth. He is mentioned again as the serpent&#x27;s rider, and is described as having mated with Eisheth Zenunim, Na&#x27;amah, and Agrat bat Mahlat, all being &quot;angels&quot; of sacred prostitution. Notably, the same work later calls him Azazel, which might be a case of mistaken identity, as Azazel may be himself in Zoharistic lore a combination of the angels Ouza and Azrael.

It is also said that the Baal Shem Tov summoned Samael to make him do his bidding.

===Other traditions===

Samael is also depicted as the angel of death and one of the seven archangels, the ruler over the Fifth Heaven and commander of two million angels such as the chief of all the destroying angels.

According to the apocryphal &quot;Gedulat Moshe&quot; (&quot;The Apocalypse of Moses&quot;, &quot;The Ascension of Moses&quot; in &quot;The Legends of the Jews&quot; by Louis Ginzberg) Samael is also mentioned as being in 7th Heaven:

== Gnosticism ==
In the &quot;Apocryphon of John&quot;, &quot;On the Origin of the World&quot;, and &quot;Hypostasis of the Archons&quot;, found in the Nag Hammadi library, &quot;Samael&quot; is one of three names of the demiurge, whose other names are &quot;Yaldabaoth&quot; and &quot;Saklas&quot;.

After Yaldabaoth claims sole divinity for himself, the voice of Sophia comes forth calling him &quot;Samael&quot;, due to his ignorance. In &quot;On the Origin of the World&quot;, his name is explained as &quot;blind god&quot; and his fellow Archons are said to be blind, too. This reflecting the characteristics of the Christian devil, making people blind, as does the devil in 2 Corinthians 4. Also Samael is the first sinner in the &quot;Hypostasis of the Archons&quot; and the First Epistle of John calls the devil as sinner from the beginning. These characteristics combined with his boasting conflates the Jewish god with the devil. His appearance is that of a lion-faced serpent. Although the Gnostics and Jewish originally used the same source, both depictions of Samael developed independently.

Samael is sometimes confused in some books with Camael, who appears in the Coptic Gospel of the Egyptians also as an evil power, whose name is similar to words meaning &quot;like God&quot; (but Camael with a waw missing). The name might be explained, because in Jewish traditions, the snake had the form of a camel, before it was banished by God.

== Anthroposophy ==
To anthroposophists, Samael is known as one of the seven archangels: Saint Gregory gives the seven archangels as Anael, Gabriel, Michael, Oriphiel, Raphael, Samael, and Zerachiel. They are all imagined to have a special assignment to act as a global &quot;zeitgeist&quot; (&#x27;time-spirit&#x27;), each for periods of about 360 years.

<doc id="174640" wikidata="Q541468" url="?curid=174640" title="West Coast Region">
<text>The West Coast () is a region of New Zealand on the west coast of the South Island. It is administered by the West Coast Regional Council, and is known co-officially as Te Tai Poutini. It comprises the territorial authorities of Buller District, Grey District and Westland District. The principal towns are Westport, Greymouth and Hokitika. The region, one of the more remote areas of the country, is also the most sparsely populated. With a population of just 32,900 people, the West Coast is the least populous region in New Zealand. The population in the region grew by 0.4% over the year to July 2023.

The region has a rich and important history. The land itself is ancient, stretching back to the Carboniferous period; this is evident by the amount of carboniferous materials naturally found there, especially coal. First settled by Kāi Tahu in approximately 1200 AD, the area was famous across New Zealand for its richness in pounamu greenstone. Kāi Tahu traded millions of modern New Zealand dollars&#x27; worth of the stone across New Zealand, making Te Tai Poutini one of the wealthiest regions in the country.

After the arrival of Europeans, the region became famed for its vast and mostly untapped gold reserves, which historically had not been highly valued. The region was subsequently settled by thousands of Irish Catholics after the Irish Famine, who constitute the majority of the population, alongside the indigenous Kāi Tahu and those who come from admixing between the two populations. The region was also heavily sought after by nuclear weapons states in the 1950s for its abundant resources of uranium, which many West Coasters found objectionable. The West Coast is the only region of New Zealand where coal mining is still widely practiced.

==Naming==
The name &quot;Westland&quot; is used by some New Zealanders to refer to the whole of the West Coast, including Grey District, Buller District and Fiordland, and can also refer to the short-lived Westland Province of 1873–76.

Fiordland is on the west coast, but is in the Southland region rather than the West Coast region.

Inhabitants of the West Coast are colloquially known as &quot;Coasters&quot;.

==Geography==
The region reaches from Kahurangi Point in the north to Awarua Point in the south, a distance of 600 km. It has an area of 23,246 km2. To the west is the Tasman Sea (which like the Southern Ocean can be very rough, with four-metre swells common), and to the east are the Southern Alps. Much of the land is rugged, with a coastal plain where much of the population resides. It is divided into the three local government districts of (from north to south) Buller, Grey and Westland.
The land is very scenic, with wild coastlines, mountains and a very high proportion of native bush, much of it native temperate rain forest. It is the only part of New Zealand where significant tracts of lowland forest remain: elsewhere, for instance on the Canterbury Plains and in the Firth of Thames, they have been almost completely destroyed for settlement and agriculture.

Scenic areas include the Haast Pass, Fox and Franz Josef Glaciers, Hokitika Gorge, Lake Brunner, the Pancake Rocks at Punakaiki, the Oparara Arches and the Heaphy Track.

The region has very high rainfall due to the prevailing northwesterly wind pattern and the location of the Southern Alps, which give rise to heavy orographic precipitation. The rain shadow effect is responsible for the relatively arid climate of the Canterbury Plains on the other side of the Southern Alps.


==History==
The region is home to Ngāi Tahu, who value it for the greenstone (pounamu) found there in abundance.

The region was only occasionally visited by Europeans until the discovery of gold near the Taramakau River in 1864 by two Māori, Ihaia Tainui and Haimona Taukau. By the end of the year there were an estimated 1800 prospectors, many of them around the Hokitika area, which in 1866 was briefly the most populous settlement in New Zealand.

The region was divided between Nelson Province and Canterbury Province from 1853: in 1873 the Canterbury portion of the region formed its own province, the Westland Province, until the abolition of the provincial system in 1876.

The West Coast gold rush between 1864 and 1867 created numerous gold rush towns such as Ōkārito, which at one time was the largest town on the West Coast but quickly almost vanished as miners moved on. After that time, the population dwindled, but the main towns that still exist had become established.

Following greenstone and gold, the next valuable mineral was coal. Discovered near the Buller River in the mid-1840s, mining began in earnest during the 1860s. By the 1880s coal had become the region&#x27;s main industry, with mines throughout the northern half of the region, especially around Westport. Many of these continued in operation until the mid-20th century, and several survive.

Timber has also long been a major industry, although in recent years there has been an uneasy balance between forestry for wood and forestry for conservation. Much of the region is public land administered by the Department of Conservation and the region has some of the best remaining stands of native forest, along with a wealth of rare wildlife. Ecotourism is now an important industry, and this goes hand in hand with the conservation efforts.

==Population==
The West Coast region covers and has an estimated population of as of , % of New Zealand&#x27;s population. It is the least populous of New Zealand&#x27;s sixteen regions. The West Coast is also the most sparsely populated region, with just people per square kilometre ( per square mile).

West Coast region had a population of 33,390 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 1,815 people (5.7%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 1,242 people (3.9%) since the 2013 census. There were 17,031 males, 16,245 females and 117 people of other genders in 14,793 dwellings. 2.7% of people identified as LGBTIQ+. The median age was 48.1 years (compared with 38.1 years nationally). There were 5,448 people (16.3%) aged under 15 years, 4,518 (13.5%) aged 15 to 29, 15,861 (47.5%) aged 30 to 64, and 7,563 (22.7%) aged 65 or older.

People could identify as more than one ethnicity. The results were 89.7% European (Pākehā); 13.5% Māori; 1.6% Pasifika; 4.0% Asian; 0.5% Middle Eastern, Latin American and African New Zealanders (MELAA); and 4.3% other, which includes people giving their ethnicity as &quot;New Zealander&quot;. English was spoken by 98.0%, Māori language by 2.3%, Samoan by 0.2% and other languages by 5.6%. No language could be spoken by 1.5% (e.g. too young to talk). New Zealand Sign Language was known by 0.5%. The percentage of people born overseas was 13.2, compared with 28.8% nationally.

Religious affiliations were 29.8% Christian, 0.6% Hindu, 0.2% Islam, 0.3% Māori religious beliefs, 0.4% Buddhist, 0.7% New Age, 0.1% Jewish, and 1.2% other religions. People who answered that they had no religion were 57.8%, and 9.0% of people did not answer the census question.

Of those at least 15 years old, 2,658 (9.5%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, 15,825 (56.6%) had a post-high school certificate or diploma, and 8,490 (30.4%) people exclusively held high school qualifications. The median income was $32,700, compared with $41,500 nationally. 1,956 people (7.0%) earned over $100,000 compared to 12.1% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 12,819 (45.9%) people were employed full-time, 4,101 (14.7%) were part-time, and 687 (2.5%) were unemployed.

=== Cities and towns ===

There are only four towns with a population over 1,000: Greymouth, Westport, Hokitika and Runanga. These four towns, plus Reefton (population ), are recognised as urban areas by Statistics New Zealand.

During the gold rush days, Hokitika had a population of more than 25,000 with more than 100 pubs. A recreation of an early New Zealand settlement is at Shantytown.

Other towns and settlements include:

* Ahaura
* Blackball
* Fox Glacier
* Granity
* Haast
* Hari Hari
* Kaniere
* Kumara
* Ngakawau
* Ross

The West Coast region is governed by the West Coast Regional Council. Currently, it is chaired by Peter Haddock.

=== Councillors ===
* Brett Cummings
* Allan Birchfield
* Andy Campbell
* Frank Dooley
* Mark McIntyre
* Peter Ewen

== Economy ==
The subnational gross domestic product (GDP) of the West Coast was estimated at NZ$2,373 million in the year to March 2022, 0.7% of New Zealand&#x27;s national GDP. The regional GDP per capita was estimated at $72,127 in the same period.

The region had one of the strongest growing regional economies of New Zealand in 2022, though from a rather small base.

Industries include mining for coal and alluvial gold, forestry and wood processing, fishing (including whitebaiting), tourism and farming.

Dairy farming has grown strongly – the local dairy co-operative Westland Milk Products remained independent when most others merged to form Fonterra in 2001. In the 2019–2020 season, there were 150,000 milking cows on the West Coast, 3.0% of the country&#x27;s total herd. The cows produced 50,700 tonnes of milk solids, worth $365 million at the national average farmgate price ($7.20 per kg).

Other industries are the manufacturing and sales of greenstone jewellery, sphagnum moss gathering and stone-collection for garden landscaping. Monteith&#x27;s brewery is in Greymouth. 

The region has been included in the &quot;Top 10 Coastal Drives of the World&quot; by &quot;Lonely Planet&quot;.

== Flora and fauna ==
The region has the only New Zealand nesting place of the kōtuku (white heron), at the Waitangiroto Nature Reserve, visited by tours from the small farming township of Whataroa. This rare bird appears on the $2 coin.

Over 80% of West Coast land is administered by the Department of Conservation, much of this being in National Parks. These include from north to south, parts of Kahurangi NP, Paparoa NP, parts of Arthurs Pass NP, Westland NP, parts of Aspiring NP plus the South Westland World Heritage Area. Each of these parks have flora and fauna common to all areas, as well as species, like kiwi, particular to those areas.

== Transport ==
Four roads run into the West Coast region. The main road running the length of the region is State Highway 6. It connects to the Tasman District in the north through the Buller Gorge, and to Otago in the south via Haast Pass. Two roads connect to Canterbury to the east, State Highway 7 through Lewis Pass to North Canterbury and State Highway 73 via Arthur&#x27;s Pass to Christchurch.

The Midland railway line is the only railway line into the region. It links to Christchurch via Arthur&#x27;s Pass. The TranzAlpine train service runs return between Christchurch and Greymouth daily and freight lines extend to Ngākawau and Hokitika.

Daily passenger flights operate into the region. Air New Zealand flies between Christchurch and Hokitika and Sounds Air between Wellington and Westport.
