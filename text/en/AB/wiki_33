<text>Cloning is the process of producing individual organisms with identical genomes, either by natural or artificial means. In nature, some organisms produce clones through asexual reproduction; this reproduction of an organism by itself without a mate is known as parthenogenesis. In the field of biotechnology, cloning is the process of creating cloned organisms of cells and of DNA fragments.

The artificial cloning of organisms, sometimes known as reproductive cloning, is often accomplished via somatic-cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), a cloning method in which a viable embryo is created from a somatic cell and an egg cell. In 1996, Dolly the sheep achieved notoriety for being the first mammal cloned from a somatic cell. Another example of artificial cloning is molecular cloning, a technique in molecular biology in which a single living cell is used to clone a large population of cells that contain identical DNA molecules.

In bioethics, there are a variety of ethical positions regarding the practice and possibilities of cloning. The use of embryonic stem cells, which can be produced through SCNT, in some stem cell research has attracted controversy. Cloning has been proposed as a means of reviving extinct species. In popular culture, the concept of cloning—particularly human cloning—is often depicted in science fiction; depictions commonly involve themes related to identity, the recreation of historical figures or extinct species, or cloning for exploitation (e.g. cloning soldiers for warfare).

==Etymology==
Coined by Herbert J. Webber, the term clone derives from the Ancient Greek word (), &quot;twig&quot;, which is the process whereby a new plant is created from a twig. In botany, the term lusus was used. In horticulture, the spelling &quot;clon&quot; was used until the early twentieth century; the final &quot;e&quot; came into use to indicate the vowel is a &quot;long o&quot; instead of a &quot;short o&quot;. Since the term entered the popular lexicon in a more general context, the spelling &quot;clone&quot; has been used exclusively.

==Natural cloning==
Natural cloning is the production of clones without the involvement of genetic engineering techniques or human intervention (i.e. artificial cloning). Natural cloning occurs through a variety of natural mechanisms, from single-celled organisms to complex multicellular organisms, and has allowed life forms to spread for hundreds of millions of years. Versions of this reproduction method are used by plants, fungi, and bacteria, and is also the way that clonal colonies reproduce themselves. Some of the mechanisms are explored and used in plants and animals are binary fission, budding, fragmentation, and parthenogenesis. It can also occur during some forms of asexual reproduction, when a single parent organism produces genetically identical offspring by itself.

Many plants are well known for natural cloning ability, including blueberry plants, Hazel trees, the Pando trees, the Kentucky coffeetree, &quot;Myrica&quot;, and the American sweetgum.

It also occurs accidentally in the case of identical twins, which are formed when a fertilized egg splits, creating two or more embryos that carry identical DNA.

==Molecular cloning==

Molecular cloning refers to the process of making multiple molecules. Cloning is commonly used to amplify DNA fragments containing whole genes, but it can also be used to amplify any DNA sequence such as promoters, non-coding sequences and randomly fragmented DNA. It is used in a wide array of biological experiments and practical applications ranging from genetic fingerprinting to large scale protein production. Occasionally, the term cloning is misleadingly used to refer to the identification of the chromosomal location of a gene associated with a particular phenotype of interest, such as in positional cloning. In practice, localization of the gene to a chromosome or genomic region does not necessarily enable one to isolate or amplify the relevant genomic sequence. To amplify any DNA sequence in a living organism, that sequence must be linked to an origin of replication, which is a sequence of DNA capable of directing the propagation of itself and any linked sequence. However, a number of other features are needed, and a variety of specialised cloning vectors (small piece of DNA into which a foreign DNA fragment can be inserted) exist that allow protein production, affinity tagging, single-stranded RNA or DNA production and a host of other molecular biology tools.

Cloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves four steps
# fragmentation - breaking apart a strand of DNA
# ligation – gluing together pieces of DNA in a desired sequence
# transfection – inserting the newly formed pieces of DNA into cells
# screening/selection – selecting out the cells that were successfully transfected with the new DNA

Although these steps are invariable among cloning procedures a number of alternative routes can be selected; these are summarized as a &quot;cloning strategy&quot;.

Initially, the DNA of interest needs to be isolated to provide a DNA segment of suitable size. Subsequently, a ligation procedure is used where the amplified fragment is inserted into a vector (piece of DNA). The vector (which is frequently circular) is linearised using restriction enzymes, and incubated with the fragment of interest under appropriate conditions with an enzyme called DNA ligase. Following ligation, the vector with the insert of interest is transfected into cells. A number of alternative techniques are available, such as chemical sensitisation of cells, electroporation, optical injection and biolistics. Finally, the transfected cells are cultured. As the aforementioned procedures are of particularly low efficiency, there is a need to identify the cells that have been successfully transfected with the vector construct containing the desired insertion sequence in the required orientation. Modern cloning vectors include selectable antibiotic resistance markers, which allow only cells in which the vector has been transfected, to grow. Additionally, the cloning vectors may contain colour selection markers, which provide blue/white screening (alpha-factor complementation) on X-gal medium. Nevertheless, these selection steps do not absolutely guarantee that the DNA insert is present in the cells obtained. Further investigation of the resulting colonies must be required to confirm that cloning was successful. This may be accomplished by means of PCR, restriction fragment analysis and/or DNA sequencing.

== Cell cloning==

===Cloning unicellular organisms===

Cloning a cell means to derive a population of cells from a single cell. In the case of unicellular organisms such as bacteria and yeast, this process is remarkably simple and essentially only requires the inoculation of the appropriate medium. However, in the case of cell cultures from multi-cellular organisms, cell cloning is an arduous task as these cells will not readily grow in standard media.

A useful tissue culture technique used to clone distinct lineages of cell lines involves the use of cloning rings (cylinders). In this technique a single-cell suspension of cells that have been exposed to a mutagenic agent or drug used to drive selection is plated at high dilution to create isolated colonies, each arising from a single and potentially clonal distinct cell. At an early growth stage when colonies consist of only a few cells, sterile polystyrene rings (cloning rings), which have been dipped in grease, are placed over an individual colony and a small amount of trypsin is added. Cloned cells are collected from inside the ring and transferred to a new vessel for further growth.

=== Cloning stem cells ===

Somatic-cell nuclear transfer, popularly known as SCNT, can also be used to create embryos for research or therapeutic purposes. The most likely purpose for this is to produce embryos for use in stem cell research. This process is also called &quot;research cloning&quot; or &quot;therapeutic cloning&quot;. The goal is not to create cloned human beings (called &quot;reproductive cloning&quot;), but rather to harvest stem cells that can be used to study human development and to potentially treat disease. While a clonal human blastocyst has been created, stem cell lines are yet to be isolated from a clonal source.

Therapeutic cloning is achieved by creating embryonic stem cells in the hopes of treating diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer&#x27;s. The process begins by removing the nucleus (containing the DNA) from an egg cell and inserting a nucleus from the adult cell to be cloned. In the case of someone with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, the nucleus from a skin cell of that patient is placed into an empty egg. The reprogrammed cell begins to develop into an embryo because the egg reacts with the transferred nucleus. The embryo will become genetically identical to the patient. The embryo will then form a blastocyst which has the potential to form/become any cell in the body.

The reason why SCNT is used for cloning is because somatic cells can be easily acquired and cultured in the lab. This process can either add or delete specific genomes of farm animals. A key point to remember is that cloning is achieved when the oocyte maintains its normal functions and instead of using sperm and egg genomes to replicate, the donor&#x27;s somatic cell nucleus is inserted into the oocyte. The oocyte will react to the somatic cell nucleus, the same way it would to a sperm cell&#x27;s nucleus.

The process of cloning a particular farm animal using SCNT is relatively the same for all animals. The first step is to collect the somatic cells from the animal that will be cloned. The somatic cells could be used immediately or stored in the laboratory for later use. The hardest part of SCNT is removing maternal DNA from an oocyte at metaphase II. Once this has been done, the somatic nucleus can be inserted into an egg cytoplasm. This creates a one-cell embryo. The grouped somatic cell and egg cytoplasm are then introduced to an electrical current. This energy will hopefully allow the cloned embryo to begin development. The successfully developed embryos are then placed in surrogate recipients, such as a cow or sheep in the case of farm animals.

SCNT is seen as a good method for producing agriculture animals for food consumption. It successfully cloned sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs. Another benefit is SCNT is seen as a solution to clone endangered species that are on the verge of going extinct. However, stresses placed on both the egg cell and the introduced nucleus can be enormous, which led to a high loss in resulting cells in early research. For example, the cloned sheep Dolly was born after 277 eggs were used for SCNT, which created 29 viable embryos. Only three of these embryos survived until birth, and only one survived to adulthood. As the procedure could not be automated, and had to be performed manually under a microscope, SCNT was very resource intensive. The biochemistry involved in reprogramming the differentiated somatic cell nucleus and activating the recipient egg was also far from being well understood. However, by 2014 researchers were reporting cloning success rates of seven to eight out of ten and in 2016, a Korean Company Sooam Biotech was reported to be producing 500 cloned embryos per day.

In SCNT, not all of the donor cell&#x27;s genetic information is transferred, as the donor cell&#x27;s mitochondria that contain their own mitochondrial DNA are left behind. The resulting hybrid cells retain those mitochondrial structures which originally belonged to the egg. As a consequence, clones such as Dolly that are born from SCNT are not perfect copies of the donor of the nucleus.

== Organism cloning ==

Organism cloning (also called reproductive cloning) refers to the procedure of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another. In essence this form of cloning is an asexual method of reproduction, where fertilization or inter-gamete contact does not take place. Asexual reproduction is a naturally occurring phenomenon in many species, including most plants and some insects. Scientists have made some major achievements with cloning, including the asexual reproduction of sheep and cows. There is a lot of ethical debate over whether or not cloning should be used. However, cloning, or asexual propagation, has been common practice in the horticultural world for hundreds of years.

=== Horticultural ===

The term &quot;clone&quot; is used in horticulture to refer to descendants of a single plant which were produced by vegetative reproduction or apomixis. Many horticultural plant cultivars are clones, having been derived from a single individual, multiplied by some process other than sexual reproduction. As an example, some European cultivars of grapes represent clones that have been propagated for over two millennia. Other examples are potatoes and bananas.

Grafting can be regarded as cloning, since all the shoots and branches coming from the graft are genetically a clone of a single individual, but this particular kind of cloning has not come under ethical scrutiny and is generally treated as an entirely different kind of operation.

Many trees, shrubs, vines, ferns and other herbaceous perennials form clonal colonies naturally. Parts of an individual plant may become detached by fragmentation and grow on to become separate clonal individuals. A common example is in the vegetative reproduction of moss and liverwort gametophyte clones by means of gemmae. Some vascular plants e.g. dandelion and certain viviparous grasses also form seeds asexually, termed apomixis, resulting in clonal populations of genetically identical individuals.

=== Parthenogenesis ===
Clonal derivation exists in nature in some animal species and is referred to as parthenogenesis (reproduction of an organism by itself without a mate). This is an asexual form of reproduction that is only found in females of some insects, crustaceans, nematodes, fish (for example the hammerhead shark), Cape honeybees, and lizards including the Komodo dragon and several whiptails. The growth and development occurs without fertilization by a male. In plants, parthenogenesis means the development of an embryo from an unfertilized egg cell, and is a component process of apomixis. In species that use the XY sex-determination system, the offspring will always be female. An example is the little fire ant (&quot;Wasmannia auropunctata&quot;), which is native to Central and South America but has spread throughout many tropical environments.

=== Artificial cloning of organisms ===
Artificial cloning of organisms may also be called &quot;reproductive cloning&quot;.

==== First steps ====
Hans Spemann, a German embryologist was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1935 for his discovery of the effect now known as embryonic induction, exercised by various parts of the embryo, that directs the development of groups of cells into particular tissues and organs. In 1924 he and his student, Hilde Mangold, were the first to perform somatic-cell nuclear transfer using amphibian embryos – one of the first steps towards cloning.

==== Methods ====
Reproductive cloning generally uses &quot;somatic cell nuclear transfer&quot; (SCNT) to create animals that are genetically identical. This process entails the transfer of a nucleus from a donor adult cell (somatic cell) to an egg from which the nucleus has been removed, or to a cell from a blastocyst from which the nucleus has been removed. If the egg begins to divide normally it is transferred into the uterus of the surrogate mother. Such clones are not strictly identical since the somatic cells may contain mutations in their nuclear DNA. Additionally, the mitochondria in the cytoplasm also contains DNA and during SCNT this mitochondrial DNA is wholly from the cytoplasmic donor&#x27;s egg, thus the mitochondrial genome is not the same as that of the nucleus donor cell from which it was produced. This may have important implications for cross-species nuclear transfer in which nuclear-mitochondrial incompatibilities may lead to death.

Artificial &quot;embryo splitting&quot; or &quot;embryo twinning&quot;, a technique that creates monozygotic twins from a single embryo, is not considered in the same fashion as other methods of cloning. During that procedure, a donor embryo is split in two distinct embryos, that can then be transferred via embryo transfer. It is optimally performed at the 6- to 8-cell stage, where it can be used as an expansion of IVF to increase the number of available embryos. If both embryos are successful, it gives rise to monozygotic (identical) twins.

==== Dolly the sheep ====


Dolly, a Finn-Dorset ewe, was the first mammal to have been successfully cloned from an adult somatic cell. Dolly was formed by taking a cell from the udder of her 6-year-old biological mother. Dolly&#x27;s embryo was created by taking the cell and inserting it into a sheep ovum. It took 435 attempts before an embryo was successful. The embryo was then placed inside a female sheep that went through a normal pregnancy. She was cloned at the Roslin Institute in Scotland by British scientists Sir Ian Wilmut and Keith Campbell and lived there from her birth in 1996 until her death in 2003 when she was six. She was born on 5 July 1996 but not announced to the world until 22 February 1997. Her stuffed remains were placed at Edinburgh&#x27;s Royal Museum, part of the National Museums of Scotland.

Dolly was publicly significant because the effort showed that genetic material from a specific adult cell, designed to express only a distinct subset of its genes, can be redesigned to grow an entirely new organism. Before this demonstration, it had been shown by John Gurdon that nuclei from differentiated cells could give rise to an entire organism after transplantation into an enucleated egg. However, this concept was not yet demonstrated in a mammalian system.

The first mammalian cloning (resulting in Dolly) had a success rate of 29 embryos per 277 fertilized eggs, which produced three lambs at birth, one of which lived. In a bovine experiment involving 70 cloned calves, one-third of the calves died quite young. The first successfully cloned horse, Prometea, took 814 attempts. Notably, although the first clones were frogs, no adult cloned frog has yet been produced from a somatic adult nucleus donor cell.

There were early claims that Dolly had pathologies resembling accelerated aging. Scientists speculated that Dolly&#x27;s death in 2003 was related to the shortening of telomeres, DNA-protein complexes that protect the end of linear chromosomes. However, other researchers, including Ian Wilmut who led the team that successfully cloned Dolly, argue that Dolly&#x27;s early death due to respiratory infection was unrelated to problems with the cloning process. This idea that the nuclei have not irreversibly aged was shown in 2013 to be true for mice.

Dolly was named after performer Dolly Parton because the cells cloned to make her were from a mammary gland cell, and Parton is known for her ample cleavage.

==== Species cloned and applications ====
The modern cloning techniques involving nuclear transfer have been successfully performed on several species. Notable experiments include:
* Tadpole: (1952) Robert Briggs and Thomas J. King successfully cloned northern leopard frogs: thirty-five complete embryos and twenty-seven tadpoles from one-hundred and four successful nuclear transfers.

* Przewalksi&#x27;s Horse: An ongoing cloning program by the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance and Revive &amp; Restore attempts to reintroduce genetic diversity to this endangered species.
** Kurt, the first cloned Przewalski&#x27;s horse, was born in 2020. He was cloned from the skin tissue of a stallion which was preserved in 1980.
** &quot;Trey&quot; was born in 2023. He was cloned from the same stallion&#x27;s tissue as Kurt.
* Dog:
**Snuppy, a male Afghan hound was the first cloned dog (2005). In 2017, the world&#x27;s first gene-editing clone dog, Apple, was created by Sinogene Biotechnology. Sooam Biotech, South Korea, was reported in 2015 to have cloned 700 dogs to date for their owners, including two Yakutian Laika hunting dogs, which are seriously endangered due to crossbreeding.
**Cloning of super sniffer dogs was reported in 2011, four years afterwards when the dogs started working. Cloning of a successful rescue dog was also reported in 2009 and of a similar police dog in 2019. Cancer-sniffing dogs have also been cloned. A review concluded that &quot;qualified elite working dogs can be produced by cloning a working dog that exhibits both an appropriate temperament and good health.&quot;
* Wolf: Snuwolf and Snuwolffy, the first two cloned female wolves (2005).
* Water buffalo: Samrupa was the first cloned water buffalo. It was born on 6 February 2009, at India&#x27;s Karnal National Dairy Research Institute but died five days later due to lung infection.

* Macaque monkey: (2017) First successful cloning of a primate species using nuclear transfer, with the birth of two live clones named Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua. Conducted in China in 2017, and reported in January 2018. In January 2019, scientists in China reported the creation of five identical cloned gene-edited monkeys, using the same cloning technique that was used with Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua and Dolly the sheep, and the gene-editing Crispr-Cas9 technique allegedly used by He Jiankui in creating the first ever gene-modified human babies Lulu and Nana. The monkey clones were made to study several medical diseases.
*Black-footed ferret: (2020) A team of scientists cloned a female named Willa, who died in the mid-1980s and left no living descendants. Her clone, a female named Elizabeth Ann, was born on 10 December. Scientists hope that the contribution of this individual will alleviate the effects of inbreeding and help black-footed ferrets better cope with plague. Experts estimate that this female&#x27;s genome contains three times as much genetic diversity as any of the modern black-footed ferrets.
*First artificial parthenogenesis in mammals: (2022) Viable mice offspring was born from unfertilized eggs via targeted DNA methylation editing of seven imprinting control regions.

==== Human cloning ====

Human cloning is the creation of a genetically identical copy of a human. The term is generally used to refer to artificial human cloning, which is the reproduction of human cells and tissues. It does not refer to the natural conception and delivery of identical twins. The possibility of human cloning has raised controversies. These ethical concerns have prompted several nations to pass legislation regarding human cloning and its legality. As of right now, scientists have no intention of trying to clone people and they believe their results should spark a wider discussion about the laws and regulations the world needs to regulate cloning.

Two commonly discussed types of theoretical human cloning are &quot;therapeutic cloning&quot; and &quot;reproductive cloning&quot;. Therapeutic cloning would involve cloning cells from a human for use in medicine and transplants, and is an active area of research, but is not in medical practice anywhere in the world, . Two common methods of therapeutic cloning that are being researched are somatic-cell nuclear transfer and, more recently, pluripotent stem cell induction. Reproductive cloning would involve making an entire cloned human, instead of just specific cells or tissues.

==== Ethical issues of cloning ====
There are a variety of ethical positions regarding the possibilities of cloning, especially human cloning. While many of these views are religious in origin, the questions raised by cloning are faced by secular perspectives as well. Perspectives on human cloning are theoretical, as human therapeutic and reproductive cloning are not commercially used; animals are currently cloned in laboratories and in livestock production.

Advocates support development of therapeutic cloning to generate tissues and whole organs to treat patients who otherwise cannot obtain transplants, to avoid the need for immunosuppressive drugs, and to stave off the effects of aging. Advocates for reproductive cloning believe that parents who cannot otherwise procreate should have access to the technology.

Opponents of cloning have concerns that technology is not yet developed enough to be safe and that it could be prone to abuse (leading to the generation of humans from whom organs and tissues would be harvested), as well as concerns about how cloned individuals could integrate with families and with society at large. Cloning humans could lead to serious violations of human rights.

Religious groups are divided, with some opposing the technology as usurping &quot;God&#x27;s place&quot; and, to the extent embryos are used, destroying a human life; others support therapeutic cloning&#x27;s potential life-saving benefits. There is at least one religion, Raëlism, in which cloning plays a major role.

Contemporary work on this topic is concerned with the ethics, adequate regulation and issues of any cloning carried out by humans, not potentially by extraterrestrials (including in the future), and largely also not replication – also described as mind cloning – of potential whole brain emulations.

Cloning of animals is opposed by animal-groups due to the number of cloned animals that suffer from malformations before they die, and while food from cloned animals has been approved as safe by the US FDA, its use is opposed by groups concerned about food safety.

In practical terms, the inclusion of &quot;licensing requirements for embryo research projects and fertility clinics, restrictions on the commodification of eggs and sperm, and measures to prevent proprietary interests from monopolizing access to stem cell lines&quot; in international cloning regulations has been proposed, albeit e.g. effective oversight mechanisms or cloning requirements have not been described.

==== Cloning extinct and endangered species ====

Cloning, or more precisely, the reconstruction of functional DNA from extinct species has, for decades, been a dream. Possible implications of this were dramatized in the 1984 novel &quot;Carnosaur&quot; and the 1990 novel &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. The best current cloning techniques have an average success rate of 9.4 percent (and as high as 25 percent) when working with familiar species such as mice, while cloning wild animals is usually less than 1 percent successful.

===== Conservation cloning =====
Several tissue banks have come into existence, including the &quot;Frozen zoo&quot; at the San Diego Zoo, to store frozen tissue from the world&#x27;s rarest and most endangered species. This is also referred to as &quot;Conservation cloning&quot;.

Engineers have proposed a &quot;lunar ark&quot; in 2021 – storing millions of seed, spore, sperm and egg samples from Earth&#x27;s contemporary species in a network of lava tubes on the Moon as a genetic backup. Similar proposals have been made since at least 2008. These also include sending human customer DNA, and a proposal for &quot;a lunar backup record of humanity&quot; that includes genetic information by Avi Loeb et al.

In 2020, the San Diego Zoo began a number of projects in partnership with the conservation organization Revive &amp; Restore and the ViaGen Pets and Equine Company to clone individuals of genetically-impoverished endangered species. A Przewalski&#x27;s horse was cloned from preserved tissue of a stallion whose genes are absent in the surviving populations of the species, which descend from twenty individuals. The clone, named Kurt, had been born to a domestic surrogate mother, and was partnered with a natural-born Przewalski&#x27;s mare in order to socialize him with the species&#x27; natural behavior before being introduced to the Zoo&#x27;s breeding herd. In 2023, a second clone of the original stallion, named Ollie, was born; this marked the first instance of multiple living clones of a single individual of an endangered species being alive at the same time. Also in 2020, a clone named Elizabeth Ann was produced of a female black-footed ferret that had no living descendants. While Elizabeth Ann became sterile due to secondary health complications, a pair of additional clones of the same individual, named Antonia and Noreen, were born to distinct surrogate mothers, and Antonia successfully reproduced later in the year.

===== De-extinction =====
One of the most anticipated targets for cloning was once the woolly mammoth, but attempts to extract DNA from frozen mammoths have been unsuccessful, though a joint Russo-Japanese team is currently working toward this goal. In January 2011, it was reported by Yomiuri Shimbun that a team of scientists headed by Akira Iritani of Kyoto University had built upon research by Dr. Wakayama, saying that they will extract DNA from a mammoth carcass that had been preserved in a Russian laboratory and insert it into the egg cells of an Asian elephant in hopes of producing a mammoth embryo. The researchers said they hoped to produce a baby mammoth within six years. The challenges are formidable. Extensively degraded DNA that may be suitable for sequencing may not be suitable for cloning; it would have to be synthetically reconstituted. In any case, with currently available technology, DNA alone is not suitable for mammalian cloning; intact viable cell nuclei are required. Patching pieces of reconstituted mammoth DNA into an Asian elephant cell nucleus would result in an elephant-mammoth hybrid rather than a true mammoth. Moreover, true de-extinction of the wooly mammoth species would require a breeding population, which would require cloning of multiple genetically distinct but reproductively compatible individuals, multiplying both the amount of work and the uncertainties involved in the project. There are potentially other post-cloning problems associated with the survival of a reconstructed mammoth, such as the requirement of ruminants for specific symbiotic microbiota in their stomachs for digestion.

Scientists at the University of Newcastle and University of New South Wales announced in March 2013 that the very recently extinct gastric-brooding frog would be the subject of a cloning attempt to resurrect the species.

Many such &quot;de-extinction&quot; projects are being championed by the non-profit Revive &amp; Restore.

In 2022, scientists showed major limitations and the scale of challenge of genetic-editing-based de-extinction, suggesting resources spent on more comprehensive de-extinction projects such as of the woolly mammoth may currently not be well allocated and substantially limited. Their analyses &quot;show that even when the extremely high-quality Norway brown rat (R. norvegicus) is used as a reference, nearly 5% of the genome sequence is unrecoverable, with 1,661 genes recovered at lower than 90% completeness, and 26 completely absent&quot;, complicated further by that &quot;distribution of regions affected is not random, but for example, if 90% completeness is used as the cutoff, genes related to immune response and olfaction are excessively affected&quot; due to which &quot;a reconstructed Christmas Island rat would lack attributes likely critical to surviving in its natural or natural-like environment&quot;.

In a 2021 online session of the Russian Geographical Society, Russia&#x27;s defense minister Sergei Shoigu mentioned using the DNA of 3,000-year-old Scythian warriors to potentially bring them back to life. The idea was described as absurd at least at this point in news reports and it was noted that Scythians likely weren&#x27;t skilled warriors by default.

The idea of cloning Neanderthals or bringing them back to life in general is controversial but some scientists have stated that it may be possible in the future and have outlined several issues or problems with such as well as broad rationales for doing so.

====== Unsuccessful attempts ======
In 2001, a cow named Bessie gave birth to a cloned Asian gaur, an endangered species, but the calf died after two days. In 2003, a banteng was successfully cloned, followed by three African wildcats from a thawed frozen embryo. These successes provided hope that similar techniques (using surrogate mothers of another species) might be used to clone extinct species. Anticipating this possibility, tissue samples from the last &quot;bucardo&quot; (Pyrenean ibex) were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after it died in 2000. Researchers are also considering cloning endangered species such as the Giant panda and Cheetah.

In 2002, geneticists at the Australian Museum announced that they had replicated DNA of the thylacine (Tasmanian tiger), at the time extinct for about 65 years, using polymerase chain reaction. However, on 15 February 2005 the museum announced that it was stopping the project after tests showed the specimens&#x27; DNA had been too badly degraded by the (ethanol) preservative. On 15 May 2005 it was announced that the thylacine project would be revived, with new participation from researchers in New South Wales and Victoria.

In 2003, for the first time, an extinct animal, the Pyrenean ibex mentioned above was cloned, at the Centre of Food Technology and Research of Aragon, using the preserved frozen cell nucleus of the skin samples from 2001 and domestic goat egg-cells. The ibex died shortly after birth due to physical defects in its lungs.

After an eight-year project involving the use of a pioneering cloning technique, Japanese researchers created 25 generations of healthy cloned mice with normal lifespans, demonstrating that clones are not intrinsically shorter-lived than naturally born animals. Other sources have noted that the offspring of clones tend to be healthier than the original clones and indistinguishable from animals produced naturally.

Some posited that Dolly the sheep may have aged more quickly than naturally born animals, as she died relatively early for a sheep at the age of six. Ultimately, her death was attributed to a respiratory illness, and the &quot;advanced aging&quot; theory is disputed.

A 2016 study indicated that once cloned animals survive the first month or two of life they are generally healthy. However, early pregnancy loss and neonatal losses are still greater with cloning than natural conception or assisted reproduction (IVF). Current research is attempting to overcome these problems.

==In popular culture==
Discussion of cloning in the popular media often presents the subject negatively. In an article in the 8 November 1993 article of &quot;Time&quot;, cloning was portrayed in a negative way, modifying Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Creation of Adam&quot; to depict Adam with five identical hands. &quot;Newsweek&quot; 10 March 1997 issue also critiqued the ethics of human cloning, and included a graphic depicting identical babies in beakers.

The concept of cloning, particularly human cloning, has featured a wide variety of science fiction works. An early fictional depiction of cloning is Bokanovsky&#x27;s Process which features in Aldous Huxley&#x27;s 1931 dystopian novel &quot;Brave New World&quot;. The process is applied to fertilized human eggs &quot;in vitro&quot;, causing them to split into identical genetic copies of the original. Following renewed interest in cloning in the 1950s, the subject was explored further in works such as Poul Anderson&#x27;s 1953 story &quot;UN-Man&quot;, which describes a technology called &quot;exogenesis&quot;, and Gordon Rattray Taylor&#x27;s book &quot;The Biological Time Bomb&quot;, which popularised the term &quot;cloning&quot; in 1963.

Cloning is a recurring theme in a number of contemporary science fiction films, ranging from action films such as &quot;Anna to the Infinite Power&quot;, &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot;, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993), &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; (1997), &quot;The 6th Day&quot; (2000), &quot;Resident Evil&quot; (2002), &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002), &quot;The Island&quot; (2005), &quot;Tales of the Abyss&quot; (2006), and &quot;Moon&quot; (2009) to comedies such as Woody Allen&#x27;s 1973 film &quot;Sleeper&quot;.

The process of cloning is represented variously in fiction. Many works depict the artificial creation of humans by a method of growing cells from a tissue or DNA sample; the replication may be instantaneous, or take place through slow growth of human embryos in artificial wombs. In the long-running British television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the Fourth Doctor and his companion Leela were cloned in a matter of seconds from DNA samples (&quot;The Invisible Enemy&quot;, 1977) and then – in an apparent homage to the 1966 film &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; – shrunk to microscopic size to enter the Doctor&#x27;s body to combat an alien virus. The clones in this story are short-lived, and can only survive a matter of minutes before they expire. Science fiction films such as &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; have featured scenes of human foetuses being cultured on an industrial scale in mechanical tanks.

Cloning humans from body parts is also a common theme in science fiction. Cloning features strongly among the science fiction conventions parodied in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Sleeper&quot;, the plot of which centres around an attempt to clone an assassinated dictator from his disembodied nose. In the 2008 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;, a duplicate version of the Tenth Doctor spontaneously grows from his severed hand, which had been cut off in a sword fight during an earlier episode.

After the death of her beloved 14-year-old Coton de Tulear named Samantha in late 2017, Barbra Streisand announced that she had cloned the dog, and was now &quot;waiting for [the two cloned pups] to get older so [she] can see if they have [Samantha&#x27;s] brown eyes and her seriousness&quot;. The operation cost $50,000 through the pet cloning company ViaGen.

In films such as Roger Spottiswoode&#x27;s 2000 &quot;The 6th Day&quot;, which makes use of the trope of a &quot;vast clandestine laboratory ... filled with row upon row of &#x27;blank&#x27; human bodies kept floating in tanks of nutrient liquid or in suspended animation&quot;, clearly fear is to be incited. In Clark&#x27;s view, the biotechnology is typically &quot;given fantastic but visually arresting forms&quot; while the science is either relegated to the background or fictionalised to suit a young audience. Genetic engineering methods are weakly represented in film; Michael Clark, writing for The Wellcome Trust, calls the portrayal of genetic engineering and biotechnology &quot;seriously distorted&quot;

===Cloning and identity===
Science fiction has used cloning, most commonly and specifically human cloning, to raise questions of identity. &quot;A Number&quot; is a 2002 play by English playwright Caryl Churchill which addresses the subject of human cloning and identity, especially nature and nurture. The story, set in the near future, is structured around the conflict between a father (Salter) and his sons (Bernard 1, Bernard 2, and Michael Black) – two of whom are clones of the first one. &quot;A Number&quot; was adapted by Caryl Churchill for television, in a co-production between the BBC and HBO Films.

In 2012, a Japanese television series named &quot;Bunshin&quot; was created. The story&#x27;s main character, Mariko, is a woman studying child welfare in Hokkaido. She grew up always doubtful about the love from her mother, who looked nothing like her and who died nine years before. One day, she finds some of her mother&#x27;s belongings at a relative&#x27;s house, and heads to Tokyo to seek out the truth behind her birth. She later discovered that she was a clone.

In the 2013 television series &quot;Orphan Black&quot;, cloning is used as a scientific study on the behavioral adaptation of the clones. In a similar vein, the book &quot;The Double&quot; by Nobel Prize winner José Saramago explores the emotional experience of a man who discovers that he is a clone.

===Cloning as resurrection===
Cloning has been used in fiction as a way of recreating historical figures. In the 1976 Ira Levin novel &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot; and its 1978 film adaptation, Josef Mengele uses cloning to create copies of Adolf Hitler.

In Michael Crichton&#x27;s 1990 novel &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, which spawned a series of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; feature films, the bioengineering company InGen develops a technique to resurrect extinct species of dinosaurs by creating cloned creatures using DNA extracted from fossils. The cloned dinosaurs are used to populate the Jurassic Park wildlife park for the entertainment of visitors. The scheme goes disastrously wrong when the dinosaurs escape their enclosures. Despite being selectively cloned as females to prevent them from breeding, the dinosaurs develop the ability to reproduce through parthenogenesis.

===Cloning for warfare===
The use of cloning for military purposes has also been explored in several fictional works. In &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, an alien race of armour-clad, warlike beings called Sontarans was introduced in the 1973 serial &quot;The Time Warrior&quot;. Sontarans are depicted as squat, bald creatures who have been genetically engineered for combat. Their weak spot is a &quot;probic vent&quot;, a small socket at the back of their neck which is associated with the cloning process. The concept of cloned soldiers being bred for combat was revisited in &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2008), when the Doctor&#x27;s DNA is used to create a female warrior called Jenny.

The 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot; was set against the backdrop of a historical conflict called the Clone Wars. The events of this war were not fully explored until the prequel films &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002) and &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005), which depict a space war waged by a massive army of heavily armoured clone troopers that leads to the foundation of the Galactic Empire. Cloned soldiers are &quot;manufactured&quot; on an industrial scale, genetically conditioned for obedience and combat effectiveness. It is also revealed that the popular character Boba Fett originated as a clone of Jango Fett, a mercenary who served as the genetic template for the clone troopers.

===Cloning for exploitation===
A recurring sub-theme of cloning fiction is the use of clones as a supply of organs for transplantation. The 2005 Kazuo Ishiguro novel &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; and the 2010 film adaption are set in an alternate history in which cloned humans are created for the sole purpose of providing organ donations to naturally born humans, despite the fact that they are fully sentient and self-aware. The 2005 film &quot;The Island&quot; revolves around a similar plot, with the exception that the clones are unaware of the reason for their existence.

The exploitation of human clones for dangerous and undesirable work was examined in the 2009 British science fiction film &quot;Moon&quot;. In the futuristic novel &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot; and subsequent film, one of the story lines focuses on a genetically engineered fabricant clone named Sonmi~451, one of millions raised in an artificial &quot;wombtank&quot;, destined to serve from birth. She is one of thousands created for manual and emotional labor; Sonmi herself works as a server in a restaurant. She later discovers that the sole source of food for clones, called &#x27;Soap&#x27;, is manufactured from the clones themselves.

In the film &quot;Us&quot;, at some point prior to the 1980s, the US Government creates clones of every citizen of the United States with the intention of using them to control their original counterparts, akin to voodoo dolls. This fails, as they were able to copy bodies, but unable to copy the souls of those they cloned. The project is abandoned and the clones are trapped exactly mirroring their above-ground counterparts&#x27; actions for generations. In the present day, the clones launch a surprise attack and manage to complete a mass-genocide of their unaware counterparts.

<text>Cellulose is an organic compound with the formula , a polysaccharide consisting of a linear chain of several hundred to many thousands of β(1→4) linked -glucose units. Cellulose is an important structural component of the primary cell wall of green plants, many forms of algae and the oomycetes. Some species of bacteria secrete it to form biofilms. Cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer on Earth. The cellulose content of cotton fibre is 90%, that of wood is 40–50%, and that of dried hemp is approximately 57%.

Cellulose is mainly used to produce paperboard and paper. Smaller quantities are converted into a wide variety of derivative products such as cellophane and rayon. Conversion of cellulose from energy crops into biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol is under development as a renewable fuel source. Cellulose for industrial use is mainly obtained from wood pulp and cotton. Cellulose is also greatly affected by direct interaction with several organic liquids.

Some animals, particularly ruminants and termites, can digest cellulose with the help of symbiotic micro-organisms that live in their guts, such as &quot;Trichonympha&quot;. In human nutrition, cellulose is a non-digestible constituent of insoluble dietary fiber, acting as a hydrophilic bulking agent for feces and potentially aiding in defecation.

== History ==

Cellulose was discovered in 1838 by the French chemist Anselme Payen, who isolated it from plant matter and determined its chemical formula. Cellulose was used to produce the first successful thermoplastic polymer, celluloid, by Hyatt Manufacturing Company in 1870. Production of rayon (&quot;artificial silk&quot;) from cellulose began in the 1890s and cellophane was invented in 1912. Hermann Staudinger determined the polymer structure of cellulose in 1920. The compound was first chemically synthesized (without the use of any biologically derived enzymes) in 1992, by Kobayashi and Shoda.

== Structure and properties ==

Cellulose has no taste, is odorless, is hydrophilic with the contact angle of 20–30 degrees, is insoluble in water and most organic solvents, is chiral and is biodegradable. It was shown to melt at 467 °C in pulse tests made by Dauenhauer &quot;et al.&quot; (2016). It can be broken down chemically into its glucose units by treating it with concentrated mineral acids at high temperature.

Cellulose is derived from -glucose units, which condense through β(1→4)-glycosidic bonds. This linkage motif contrasts with that for α(1→4)-glycosidic bonds present in starch and glycogen. Cellulose is a straight chain polymer. Unlike starch, no coiling or branching occurs and the molecule adopts an extended and rather stiff rod-like conformation, aided by the equatorial conformation of the glucose residues. The multiple hydroxyl groups on the glucose from one chain form hydrogen bonds with oxygen atoms on the same or on a neighbour chain, holding the chains firmly together side-by-side and forming &quot;microfibrils&quot; with high tensile strength. This confers tensile strength in cell walls where cellulose microfibrils are meshed into a polysaccharide &quot;matrix&quot;. The high tensile strength of plant stems and of the tree wood also arises from the arrangement of cellulose fibers intimately distributed into the lignin matrix. The mechanical role of cellulose fibers in the wood matrix responsible for its strong structural resistance, can somewhat be compared to that of the reinforcement bars in concrete, lignin playing here the role of the hardened cement paste acting as the &quot;glue&quot; in between the cellulose fibres. Mechanical properties of cellulose in primary plant cell wall are correlated with growth and expansion of plant cells. Live fluorescence microscopy techniques are promising in investigation of the role of cellulose in growing plant cells.

Compared to starch, cellulose is also much more crystalline. Whereas starch undergoes a crystalline to amorphous transition when heated beyond 60–70 °C in water (as in cooking), cellulose requires a temperature of 320 °C and pressure of 25 MPa to become amorphous in water.

Several types of cellulose are known. These forms are distinguished according to the location of hydrogen bonds between and within strands. Natural cellulose is cellulose I, with structures Iα and Iβ. Cellulose produced by bacteria and algae is enriched in Iα while cellulose of higher plants consists mainly of Iβ. Cellulose in regenerated cellulose fibers is cellulose II. The conversion of cellulose I to cellulose II is irreversible, suggesting that cellulose I is metastable and cellulose II is stable. With various chemical treatments it is possible to produce the structures cellulose III and cellulose IV.

Many properties of cellulose depend on its chain length or degree of polymerization, the number of glucose units that make up one polymer molecule. Cellulose from wood pulp has typical chain lengths between 300 and 1700 units; cotton and other plant fibers as well as bacterial cellulose have chain lengths ranging from 800 to 10,000 units. Molecules with very small chain length resulting from the breakdown of cellulose are known as cellodextrins; in contrast to long-chain cellulose, cellodextrins are typically soluble in water and organic solvents.

The chemical formula of cellulose is (C6H10O5)n where n is the degree of polymerization and represents the number of glucose groups.

Plant-derived cellulose is usually found in a mixture with hemicellulose, lignin, pectin and other substances, while bacterial cellulose is quite pure, has a much higher water content and higher tensile strength due to higher chain lengths.

Cellulose consists of fibrils with crystalline and amorphous regions. These cellulose fibrils may be individualized by mechanical treatment of cellulose pulp, often assisted by chemical oxidation or enzymatic treatment, yielding semi-flexible cellulose nanofibrils generally 200 nm to 1 μm in length depending on the treatment intensity. Cellulose pulp may also be treated with strong acid to hydrolyze the amorphous fibril regions, thereby producing short rigid cellulose nanocrystals a few 100 nm in length. These nanocelluloses are of high technological interest due to their self-assembly into cholesteric liquid crystals, production of hydrogels or aerogels, use in nanocomposites with superior thermal and mechanical properties, and use as Pickering stabilizers for emulsions.

==Processing==

=== Biosynthesis ===

In plants cellulose is synthesized at the plasma membrane by rosette terminal complexes (RTCs). The RTCs are hexameric protein structures, approximately 25 nm in diameter, that contain the cellulose synthase enzymes that synthesise the individual cellulose chains. Each RTC floats in the cell&#x27;s plasma membrane and &quot;spins&quot; a microfibril into the cell wall.

RTCs contain at least three different cellulose synthases, encoded by &quot;CesA&quot; (&quot;Ces&quot; is short for &quot;cellulose synthase&quot;) genes, in an unknown stoichiometry. Separate sets of &quot;CesA&quot; genes are involved in primary and secondary cell wall biosynthesis. There are known to be about seven subfamilies in the plant &quot;CesA&quot; superfamily, some of which include the more cryptic, tentatively-named &quot;Csl&quot; (cellulose synthase-like) enzymes. These cellulose syntheses use UDP-glucose to form the β(1→4)-linked cellulose.

Bacterial cellulose is produced using the same family of proteins, although the gene is called &quot;BcsA&quot; for &quot;bacterial cellulose synthase&quot; or &quot;CelA&quot; for &quot;cellulose&quot; in many instances. In fact, plants acquired &quot;CesA&quot; from the endosymbiosis event that produced the chloroplast. All cellulose synthases known belongs to glucosyltransferase family 2 (GT2).

Cellulose synthesis requires chain initiation and elongation, and the two processes are separate.
Cellulose synthase (&quot;CesA&quot;) initiates cellulose polymerization using a steroid primer, sitosterol-beta-glucoside, and UDP-glucose. It then utilises UDP-D-glucose precursors to elongate the growing cellulose chain. A cellulase may function to cleave the primer from the mature chain.

Cellulose is also synthesised by tunicate animals, particularly in the tests of ascidians (where the cellulose was historically termed &quot;tunicine&quot; (tunicin)).

=== Breakdown (cellulolysis) ===

Cellulolysis is the process of breaking down cellulose into smaller polysaccharides called cellodextrins or completely into glucose units; this is a hydrolysis reaction. Because cellulose molecules bind strongly to each other, cellulolysis is relatively difficult compared to the breakdown of other polysaccharides. However, this process can be significantly intensified in a proper solvent, e.g. in an ionic liquid.

Most mammals have limited ability to digest dietary fibre such as cellulose. Some ruminants like cows and sheep contain certain symbiotic anaerobic bacteria (such as &quot;Cellulomonas&quot; and &quot;Ruminococcus&quot; spp.) in the flora of the rumen, and these bacteria produce enzymes called cellulases that hydrolyze cellulose. The breakdown products are then used by the bacteria for proliferation. The bacterial mass is later digested by the ruminant in its digestive system (stomach and small intestine). Horses use cellulose in their diet by fermentation in their hindgut. Some termites contain in their hindguts certain flagellate protozoa producing such enzymes, whereas others contain bacteria or may produce cellulase.

The enzymes used to the glycosidic linkage in cellulose are glycoside hydrolases including endo-acting cellulases and exo-acting glucosidases. Such enzymes are usually secreted as part of multienzyme complexes that may include dockerins and carbohydrate-binding modules.

=== Breakdown (thermolysis) ===

At temperatures above 350 °C, cellulose undergoes thermolysis (also called &#x27;pyrolysis&#x27;), decomposing into solid char, vapors, aerosols, and gases such as carbon dioxide. Maximum yield of vapors which condense to a liquid called &quot;bio-oil&quot; is obtained at 500 °C.

Semi-crystalline cellulose polymers react at pyrolysis temperatures (350–600 °C) in a few seconds; this transformation has been shown to occur via a solid-to-liquid-to-vapor transition, with the liquid (called &quot;intermediate liquid cellulose&quot; or &quot;molten cellulose&quot;) existing for only a fraction of a second. Glycosidic bond cleavage produces short cellulose chains of two-to-seven monomers comprising the melt. Vapor bubbling of intermediate liquid cellulose produces aerosols, which consist of short chain anhydro-oligomers derived from the melt.

Continuing decomposition of molten cellulose produces volatile compounds including levoglucosan, furans, pyrans, light oxygenates, and gases via primary reactions. Within thick cellulose samples, volatile compounds such as levoglucosan undergo &#x27;secondary reactions&#x27; to volatile products including pyrans and light oxygenates such as glycolaldehyde.

== Hemicellulose ==

Hemicelluloses are polysaccharides related to cellulose that comprises about 20% of the biomass of land plants. In contrast to cellulose, hemicelluloses are derived from several sugars in addition to glucose, especially xylose but also including mannose, galactose, rhamnose, and arabinose. Hemicelluloses consist of shorter chains – between 500 and 3000 sugar units. Furthermore, hemicelluloses are branched, whereas cellulose is unbranched.

==Regenerated cellulose==

Cellulose is soluble in several kinds of media, several of which are the basis of commercial technologies. These dissolution processes are reversible and are used in the production of regenerated celluloses (such as viscose and cellophane) from dissolving pulp.

The most important solubilizing agent is carbon disulfide in the presence of alkali. Other agents include Schweizer&#x27;s reagent, &quot;N&quot;-methylmorpholine &quot;N&quot;-oxide, and lithium chloride in dimethylacetamide. In general, these agents modify the cellulose, rendering it soluble. The agents are then removed concomitant with the formation of fibers. Cellulose is also soluble in many kinds of ionic liquids.

The history of regenerated cellulose is often cited as beginning with George Audemars, who first manufactured regenerated nitrocellulose fibers in 1855. Although these fibers were soft and strong -resembling silk- they had the drawback of being highly flammable. Hilaire de Chardonnet perfected production of nitrocellulose fibers, but manufacturing of these fibers by his process was relatively uneconomical. In 1890, L.H. Despeissis invented the cuprammonium process – which uses a cuprammonium solution to solubilize cellulose – a method still used today for production of artificial silk. In 1891, it was discovered that treatment of cellulose with alkali and carbon disulfide generated a soluble cellulose derivative known as viscose. This process, patented by the founders of the Viscose Development Company, is the most widely used method for manufacturing regenerated cellulose products. Courtaulds purchased the patents for this process in 1904, leading to significant growth of viscose fiber production. By 1931, expiration of patents for the viscose process led to its adoption worldwide. Global production of regenerated cellulose fiber peaked in 1973 at 3,856,000 tons.

Regenerated cellulose can be used to manufacture a wide variety of products. While the first application of regenerated cellulose was as a clothing textile, this class of materials is also used in the production of disposable medical devices as well as fabrication of artificial membranes.

==Cellulose esters and ethers==
The hydroxyl groups (−OH) of cellulose can be partially or fully reacted with various reagents to afford derivatives with useful properties like mainly cellulose esters and cellulose ethers (−OR). In principle, although not always in current industrial practice, cellulosic polymers are renewable resources.

Ester derivatives include:

Cellulose acetate and cellulose triacetate are film- and fiber-forming materials that find a variety of uses. Nitrocellulose was initially used as an explosive and was an early film forming material. When plasticized with camphor, nitrocellulose gives celluloid.

Cellulose Ether derivatives include:

The sodium carboxymethyl cellulose can be cross-linked to give the croscarmellose sodium (E468) for use as a disintegrant in pharmaceutical formulations. Furthermore, by the covalent attachment of thiol groups to cellulose ethers such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose or hydroxyethyl cellulose mucoadhesive and permeation enhancing properties can be introduced. Thiolated cellulose derivatives (see thiomers) exhibit also high binding properties for metal ions.

==Commercial applications==
Cellulose for industrial use is mainly obtained from wood pulp and from cotton.
* Paper products: Cellulose is the major constituent of paper, paperboard, and card stock. Electrical insulation paper: Cellulose is used in diverse forms as insulation in transformers, cables, and other electrical equipment.
* Fibres: Cellulose is the main ingredient of textiles. Cotton and synthetics (nylons) each have about 40% market by volume. Other plant fibres (jute, sisal, hemp) represent about 20% of the market. Rayon, cellophane and other &quot;regenerated cellulose fibres&quot; are a small portion (5%).
* Consumables: Microcrystalline cellulose (E460i) and powdered cellulose (E460ii) are used as inactive fillers in drug tablets and a wide range of soluble cellulose derivatives, E numbers E461 to E469, are used as emulsifiers, thickeners and stabilizers in processed foods. Cellulose powder is, for example, used in processed cheese to prevent caking inside the package. Cellulose occurs naturally in some foods and is an additive in manufactured foods, contributing an indigestible component used for texture and bulk, potentially aiding in defecation.
* Building material: Hydroxyl bonding of cellulose in water produces a sprayable, moldable material as an alternative to the use of plastics and resins. The recyclable material can be made water- and fire-resistant. It provides sufficient strength for use as a building material. Cellulose insulation made from recycled paper is becoming popular as an environmentally preferable material for building insulation. It can be treated with boric acid as a fire retardant.
* Miscellaneous: Cellulose can be converted into cellophane, a thin transparent film. It is the base material for the celluloid that was used for photographic and movie films until the mid-1930s. Cellulose is used to make water-soluble adhesives and binders such as methyl cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose which are used in wallpaper paste. Cellulose is further used to make hydrophilic and highly absorbent sponges. Cellulose is the raw material in the manufacture of nitrocellulose (cellulose nitrate) which is used in smokeless gunpowder.
* Pharmaceuticals: Cellulose derivatives, such as microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), have the advantages of retaining water, being a stabilizer and thickening agent, and in reinforcement of drug tablets.

===Aspirational===
Energy crops: The major combustible component of non-food energy crops is cellulose, with lignin second. Non-food energy crops produce more usable energy than edible energy crops (which have a large starch component), but still compete with food crops for agricultural land and water resources. Typical non-food energy crops include industrial hemp, switchgrass, &quot;Miscanthus&quot;, &quot;Salix&quot; (willow), and &quot;Populus&quot; (poplar) species. A strain of &quot;Clostridium&quot; bacteria found in zebra dung, can convert nearly any form of cellulose into butanol fuel.

Another possible application is as Insect repellents.

<text>A colony is a territory subject to a form of foreign rule, which rules the territory and its indigenous peoples separated from the foreign rulers, the colonizer, and their &quot;metropole&quot; (or &quot;mother country&quot;). This separated rule was often organized into colonial empires, with their metropoles at their centers, making colonies neither annexed or even integrated territories, nor client states. Particularly new imperialism and its colonialism advanced this separated rule and its lasting coloniality. Colonies were most often set up and colonized for exploitation and possibly settlement by colonists.

The term colony originates from the ancient Roman , a type of Roman settlement. Derived from &quot;colonus&quot; (farmer, cultivator, planter, or settler), it carries with it the sense of &#x27;farm&#x27; and &#x27;landed estate&#x27;.
Furthermore, the term was used to refer to the older Greek &quot;apoikia&quot; (), which were overseas settlements by ancient Greek city-states. The city that founded such a settlement became known as its &quot;&quot; (&quot;mother-city&quot;). Since early-modern times, historians, administrators, and political scientists have generally used the term &quot;colony&quot; to refer mainly to the many different overseas territories of particularly European states between the 15th and 20th centuries CE, with colonialism and decolonization as corresponding phenomena.

While colonies often developed from trading outposts or territorial claims, such areas do not need to be a product of colonization, nor become colonially organized territories. Territories furthermore do not need to have been militarily conquered and occupied to come under colonial rule and to be considered de facto colonies, instead neocolonial exploitation of dependency or imperialist use of power to intervene to force policy, might make a territory be considered a colony, which broadens the concept, including indirect rule or puppet states (contrasted by more independent types of client states such as vassal states). Subsequently, some historians have used the term &quot;informal colony&quot; to refer to a country under a &quot;de facto&quot; control of another state. Though the broadening of the concept is often contentious.

Contemporarily colonies are identified and organized as not sufficiently self-governed dependent territories. Other past colonies have become either sufficiently incorporated and self-governed, or independent, with some to a varying degree dominated by remaining colonial settler societies or neocolonialism.

==Concept==
The word &quot;colony&quot; comes from the Latin word , used for ancient Roman outposts and eventually for cities. This in turn derives from the word , which referred to a Roman tenant farmer.

Settlements that began as Roman include cities from Cologne (which retains this history in its name) to Belgrade to York. A telltale sign of a settlement within the Roman sphere of influence once being a Roman colony is a city centre with a grid pattern.

With a long and changing history of use colonies have been distinguished from &quot;settler colonies&quot;, which are the more particular type of a settlement or community and not so much territorial.

The federation lasted until 1954. In the four protectorates, the French formally left the local rulers in power, who were the Emperors of Vietnam, Kings of Cambodia, and Kings of Luang Prabang, but gathered all powers in their hands, the local rulers acting only as figureheads.
* : Contact between Europe and Ghana (known as the Gold Coast) began in the 15th century with the arrival of the Portuguese. This soon led to the establishment of several colonies by European powers: Portuguese Gold Coast (1482–1642), Dutch Gold Coast (1598–1872), Swedish Gold Coast (1650–1663), Danish Gold Coast (1658–1850), Brandenburger and Prussian Gold Coast (1685–1721) and British Gold Coast (1821–1957). In 1957, Ghana was the first African colony south of the Sahara to become independent.

* was a colony of Spain from 1493 to 1898, when it passed to be a colonial possession of the United States, classified by the United States as &quot;an unincorporated territory&quot;. In 1914, the Puerto Rican House of Delegates voted unanimously in favor of independence from the United States, but this was rejected by the U.S. Congress as &quot;unconstitutional&quot; and in violation of the U.S. 1900 Foraker Act. In 1952, after the US Congress approved Puerto Rico&#x27;s constitution, its formal name became &quot;Commonwealth of Puerto Rico&quot;, but its new name &quot;did not change Puerto Rico&#x27;s political, social, and economic relationship to the United States.&quot; That year, the United States advised the United Nations (UN) that the island was a self-governing territory. The United States has been &quot;unwilling to play in public the imperial role... it has no appetite for acknowledging in a public way the contradictions implicit in frankly colonial rule.&quot; The island has been called a colony by many, including US Federal judges, US Congresspeople, the Chief Justice of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, and numerous scholars. 
* consisted of territories and colonies by various African and European powers, including the Dutch and the British, and the Nguni. The territory consisting of the modern nation was ruled directly by the British from 1806 to 1910; became a self-governing dominion of Union of South Africa in 1910.
* : a British colony from 1815 to 1948. Known as Ceylon. Was a British Dominion until 1972. Also a Portuguese colony in the 16th–17th centuries, and a Dutch colony in the 17th–18th centuries.
* was a colony of Japan from 1910 to 1945. North Korea and South Korea were established in 1948. 
* has a complex history of colonial rule under various powers, including the Dutch (1624–1662), Spanish (1626–1642), Chinese (1683–1895) and Japanese (1895–1945). The precolonial (pre-1624) inhabitants of Taiwan are the ethno-linguistically Austronesian Taiwanese indigenous peoples, rather than the vast majority of present-day Taiwanese people, who are mostly ethno-linguistically Han Chinese. Twice throughout history, Taiwan has served as a &quot;quasi&quot; rump state for Chinese governments, the first instance being the Ming-loyalist Kingdom of Tungning (1662–1683) and the second instance being the present-day Republic of China (ROC), which officially claims continuity or succession from the Republic of China (1912–1949), having retreated from mainland China to Taiwan in 1949 during the final years of the Chinese Civil War (1927–1949). The ROC, whose &quot;de facto&quot; territory consists almost entirely of the island of Taiwan and its minor satellite islands, continues to rule Taiwan as if it were a separate country from the People&#x27;s Republic of China (consisting of mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau).
* The was formed from a union of thirteen British colonies. The Colony of Virginia was the first of the thirteen colonies. All thirteen declared independence in July 1776 and expelled the British governors.

==Current colonies==

The Special Committee on Decolonization maintains the United Nations list of non-self-governing territories, which identifies areas the United Nations (though not without controversy) believes are colonies. Given that dependent territories have varying degrees of autonomy and political power in the affairs of the controlling state, there is disagreement over the classification of &quot;colony&quot;.

<text>In cryptozoology and ufology, &quot;rods&quot; (also known as &quot;skyfish&quot;, &quot;air rods&quot;, or &quot;solar entities&quot;) are elongated visual artifacts appearing in photographic images and video recordings.

Most optical analyses to date have concluded that the images are insects moving across the frame as the photo is being captured, although cryptozoologists and ufologists claim that they are paranormal in nature.

==Optical analysis==
Robert Todd Carroll (2003), having consulted an entomologist (Doug Yanega), identified rods as images of flying insects recorded over several cycles of wing-beating on video recording devices. The insect captured on image a number of times, while propelling itself forward, gives the illusion of a single elongated rod-like body, with bulges.

A 2000 report by staff at &quot;The Straight Dope&quot; also explained rods as such phenomena, namely tricks of light which result from how (primarily video) images of flying insects are recorded and played back, adding that investigators have shown the rod-like bodies to be a result of motion blur, if the camera is shooting with relatively long exposure times.

The claims of these being extraordinary creatures, possibly alien, have been advanced by either people with active imaginations, or hoaxers.

In August 2005, China Central Television (CCTV) aired a two-part documentary about flying rods in China. It reported the events from May to June of the same year at Tonghua Zhenguo Pharmaceutical Company in Tonghua City, Jilin Province, which debunked the flying rods. Surveillance cameras in the facility&#x27;s compound captured video footage of flying rods identical to those shown in Jose Escamilla&#x27;s video. Getting no satisfactory answer to the phenomenon, curious scientists at the facility decided that they would try to solve the mystery by attempting to catch these airborne creatures. Huge nets were set up and the same surveillance cameras then captured images of rods flying into the trap. When the nets were inspected, the &quot;rods&quot; were no more than regular moths and other ordinary flying insects. Subsequent investigations proved that the appearance of flying rods on video was an optical illusion created by the slower recording speed of the camera.

After attending a lecture by Jose Escamilla, UFO investigator Robert Sheaffer wrote that &quot;some of his &#x27;rods&#x27; were obviously insects zipping across the field at a high angular rate&quot; and others appeared to be &quot;appendages&quot; which were birds&#x27; wings blurred by the camera exposure.

==Paranormal claims==
Various paranormal interpretations of this phenomenon appear in popular culture. One of the more outspoken proponents of rods as alien life forms was Jose Escamilla, who claimed to have been the first to film them on March 19, 1994, in Roswell, New Mexico, while attempting to film a UFO. Escamilla later made additional videos and embarked on lecture tours to promote his claims.

<text>A column or pillar in architecture and structural engineering is a structural element that transmits, through compression, the weight of the structure above to other structural elements below. In other words, a column is a compression member. The term &quot;column&quot; applies especially to a large round support (the shaft of the column) with a capital and a base or pedestal, which is made of stone, or appearing to be so. A small wooden or metal support is typically called a &quot;post&quot;. Supports with a rectangular or other non-round section are usually called &quot;piers&quot;.

For the purpose of wind or earthquake engineering, columns may be designed to resist lateral forces. Other compression members are often termed &quot;columns&quot; because of the similar stress conditions. Columns are frequently used to support beams or arches on which the upper parts of walls or ceilings rest. In architecture, &quot;column&quot; refers to such a structural element that also has certain proportional and decorative features. These beautiful columns are available in a broad selection of styles and designs in round tapered, round straight, or square shaft styles. A column might also be a decorative element not needed for structural purposes; many columns are engaged, that is to say form part of a wall. A long sequence of columns joined by an entablature is known as a colonnade.

==History==

=== Antiquity ===
All significant Iron Age civilizations of the Near East and Mediterranean made some use of columns.

==== Egyptian ====

In ancient Egyptian architecture as early as 2600 BC, the architect Imhotep made use of stone columns whose surface was carved to reflect the organic form of bundled reeds, like papyrus, lotus and palm. In later Egyptian architecture faceted cylinders were also common. Their form is thought to derive from archaic reed-built shrines. Carved from stone, the columns were highly decorated with carved and painted hieroglyphs, texts, ritual imagery and natural motifs. Egyptian columns are famously present in the Great Hypostyle Hall of Karnak (), where 134 columns are lined up in sixteen rows, with some columns reaching heights of 24 metres.

One of the most important type are the papyriform columns. The origin of these columns goes back to the 5th Dynasty. They are composed of lotus (papyrus) stems which are drawn together into a bundle decorated with bands: the capital, instead of opening out into the shape of a bellflower, swells out and then narrows again like a flower in bud. The base, which tapers to take the shape of a half-sphere like the stem of the lotus, has a continuously recurring decoration of stipules.

==== Greek and Roman ====

The Minoans used whole tree-trunks, usually turned upside down in order to prevent re-growth, stood on a base set in the stylobate (floor base) and topped by a simple round capital. These were then painted as in the most famous Minoan palace of Knossos. The Minoans employed columns to create large open-plan spaces, light-wells and as a focal point for religious rituals.

These traditions were continued by the later Mycenaean civilization, particularly in the megaron or hall at the heart of their palaces. The importance of columns and their reference to palaces and therefore authority is evidenced in their use in heraldic motifs such as the famous lion-gate of Mycenae where two lions stand each side of a column. Being made of wood these early columns have not survived, but their stone bases have and through these we may see their use and arrangement in these palace buildings.

The Egyptians, Persians and other civilizations mostly used columns for the practical purpose of holding up the roof inside a building, preferring outside walls to be decorated with reliefs or painting, but the Ancient Greeks, followed by the Romans, loved to use them on the outside as well, and the extensive use of columns on the interior and exterior of buildings is one of the most characteristic features of classical architecture, in buildings like the Parthenon. The Greeks developed the classical orders of architecture, which are most easily distinguished by the form of the column and its various elements. Their Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders were expanded by the Romans to include the Tuscan and Composite orders.

==== Persian ====
Some of the most elaborate columns in the ancient world were those of the Persians, especially the massive stone columns erected in Persepolis. They included double-bull structures in their capitals. The Hall of Hundred Columns at Persepolis, measuring 70 × 70 metres, was built by the Achaemenid king Darius I (524–486 BC). Many of the ancient Persian columns are standing, some being more than 30 metres tall. Tall columns with bull&#x27;s head capitals were used for porticoes and to support the roofs of the hypostylehall, partly inspired by the ancient Egyptian precedent. Since the columns carried timber beams rather than stone, they could be taller, slimmer and more widely spaced than Egyptian ones.

===Middle Ages===

Columns, or at least large structural exterior ones, became much less significant in the architecture of the Middle Ages. The classical forms were abandoned in both Byzantine and Romanesque architecture in favour of more flexible forms, with capitals often using various types of foliage decoration, and in the West scenes with figures carved in relief.

During the Romanesque period, builders continued to reuse and imitate ancient Roman columns wherever possible; where new, the emphasis was on elegance and beauty, as illustrated by twisted columns. Often they were decorated with mosaics.

===Renaissance and later styles===
Renaissance architecture was keen to revive the classical vocabulary and styles, and the informed use and variation of the classical orders remained fundamental to the training of architects throughout Baroque, Rococo and Neo-classical architecture.

==Structure==

Early columns were constructed of stone, some out of a single piece of stone. Monolithic columns are among the heaviest stones used in architecture. Other stone columns are created out of multiple sections of stone, mortared or dry-fit together. In many classical sites, sectioned columns were carved with a centre hole or depression so that they could be pegged together, using stone or metal pins. The design of most classical columns incorporates entasis (the inclusion of a slight outward curve in the sides) plus a reduction in diameter along the height of the column, so that the top is as little as 83% of the bottom diameter. This reduction mimics the parallax effects which the eye expects to see, and tends to make columns look taller and straighter than they are while entasis adds to that effect.

There are flutes and fillets that run up the shaft of columns. The flute is the part of the column that is indented in with a semi circular shape. The fillet of the column is the part between each of the flutes on the Ionic order columns. The flute width changes on all tapered columns as it goes up the shaft and stays the same on all non tapered columns. This was done to the columns to add visual interest to them. The Ionic and the Corinthian are the only orders that have fillets and flutes. The Doric style has flutes but not fillets. Doric flutes are connected at a sharp point where the fillets are located on Ionic and Corinthian order columns.

===Nomenclature===
Most classical columns arise from a basis, or base, that rests on the stylobate, or foundation, except for those of the Doric order, which usually rest directly on the stylobate. The basis may consist of several elements, beginning with a wide, square slab known as a plinth. The simplest bases consist of the plinth alone, sometimes separated from the column by a convex circular cushion known as a torus. More elaborate bases include two toruses, separated by a concave section or channel known as a scotia or trochilus. Scotiae could also occur in pairs, separated by a convex section called an astragal, or bead, narrower than a torus. Sometimes these sections were accompanied by still narrower convex sections, known as annulets or fillets.

At the top of the shaft is a capital, upon which the roof or other architectural elements rest. In the case of Doric columns, the capital usually consists of a round, tapering cushion, or echinus, supporting a square slab, known as an abax or abacus. Ionic capitals feature a pair of volutes, or scrolls, while Corinthian capitals are decorated with reliefs in the form of acanthus leaves. Either type of capital could be accompanied by the same moldings as the base. In the case of free-standing columns, the decorative elements atop the shaft are known as a finial.

Modern columns may be constructed out of steel, poured or precast concrete, or brick, left bare or clad in an architectural covering, or veneer. Used to support an arch, an impost, or pier, is the topmost member of a column. The bottom-most part of the arch, called the springing, rests on the impost.

===Equilibrium, instability, and loads===

As the axial load on a perfectly straight slender column with elastic material properties is increased in magnitude, this ideal column passes through three states: stable equilibrium, neutral equilibrium, and instability. The straight column under load is in stable equilibrium if a lateral force, applied between the two ends of the column, produces a small lateral deflection which disappears and the column returns to its straight form when the lateral force is removed. If the column load is gradually increased, a condition is reached in which the straight form of equilibrium becomes so-called neutral equilibrium, and a small lateral force will produce a deflection that does not disappear and the column remains in this slightly bent form when the lateral force is removed. The load at which neutral equilibrium of a column is reached is called the critical or buckling load. The state of instability is reached when a slight increase of the column load causes uncontrollably growing lateral deflections leading to complete collapse.

For an axially loaded straight column with any end support conditions, the equation of static equilibrium, in the form of a differential equation, can be solved for the deflected shape and critical load of the column. With hinged, fixed or free end support conditions the deflected shape in neutral equilibrium of an initially straight column with uniform cross section throughout its length always follows a partial or composite sinusoidal curve shape, and the critical load is given by

formula_1

where &quot;r&quot; = radius of gyration of column cross-section which is equal to the square root of (I/A), &quot;K&quot; = ratio of the longest half sine wave to the actual column length, &quot;E&quot;&quot;t&quot; = tangent modulus at the stress &quot;F&quot;cr, and &quot;KL&quot; = effective length (length of an equivalent hinged-hinged column). From Equation (2) it can be noted that the buckling strength of a column is inversely proportional to the square of its length.

When the critical stress, &quot;F&quot;cr (&quot;F&quot;cr =&quot;P&quot;cr/&quot;A&quot;, where &quot;A&quot; = cross-sectional area of the column), is greater than the proportional limit of the material, the column is experiencing inelastic buckling. Since at this stress the slope of the material&#x27;s stress-strain curve, &quot;E&quot;&quot;t&quot; (called the tangent modulus), is smaller than that below the proportional limit, the critical load at inelastic buckling is reduced. More complex formulas and procedures apply for such cases, but in its simplest form the critical buckling load formula is given as Equation (3),

formula_2

A column with a cross section that lacks symmetry may suffer torsional buckling (sudden twisting) before, or in combination with, lateral buckling. The presence of the twisting deformations renders both theoretical analyses and practical designs rather complex.

Eccentricity of the load, or imperfections such as initial crookedness, decreases column strength. If the axial load on the column is not concentric, that is, its line of action is not precisely coincident with the centroidal axis of the column, the column is characterized as eccentrically loaded. The eccentricity of the load, or an initial curvature, subjects the column to immediate bending. The increased stresses due to the combined axial-plus-flexural stresses result in a reduced load-carrying ability.

Column elements are considered to be massive if their smallest side dimension is equal to or more than 400 mm. Massive columns have the ability to increase in carrying strength over long time periods (even during periods of heavy load). Taking into account the fact, that possible structural loads may increase over time as well (and also the threat of progressive failure), massive columns have an advantage compared to non-massive ones.

===Extensions===
When a column is too long to be built or transported in one piece, it has to be extended or spliced at the construction site. A reinforced concrete column is extended by having the steel reinforcing bars protrude a few inches or feet above the top of the concrete, then placing the next level of reinforcing bars to overlap, and pouring the concrete of the next level. A steel column is extended by welding or bolting splice plates on the flanges and webs or walls of the columns to provide a few inches or feet of load transfer from the upper to the lower column section. A timber column is usually extended by the use of a steel tube or wrapped-around sheet-metal plate bolted onto the two connecting timber sections.

===Foundations===
A column that carries the load down to a foundation must have means to transfer the load without overstressing the foundation material. Reinforced concrete and masonry columns are generally built directly on top of concrete foundations. When seated on a concrete foundation, a steel column must have a base plate to spread the load over a larger area, and thereby reduce the bearing pressure. The base plate is a thick, rectangular steel plate usually welded to the bottom end of the column.

==Orders==
The Roman author Vitruvius, relying on the writings (now lost) of Greek authors, tells us that the ancient Greeks believed that their Doric order developed from techniques for building in wood. The earlier smoothed tree-trunk was replaced by a stone cylinder.

===Doric order===
The Doric order is the oldest and simplest of the classical orders. It is composed of a vertical cylinder that is wider at the bottom. It generally has neither a base nor a detailed capital. It is instead often topped with an inverted frustum of a shallow cone or a cylindrical band of carvings. It is often referred to as the masculine order because it is represented in the bottom level of the Colosseum and the Parthenon, and was therefore considered to be able to hold more weight. The height-to-thickness ratio is about 8:1. The shaft of a Doric Column is almost always fluted.

The Greek Doric, developed in the western Dorian region of Greece, is the heaviest and most massive of the orders. It rises from the stylobate without any base; it is from four to six times as tall as its diameter; it has twenty broad flutes; the capital consists simply of a banded necking swelling out into a smooth echinus, which carries a flat square abacus; the Doric entablature is also the heaviest, being about one-fourth the height column. The Greek Doric order was not used after c. 100 B.C. until its “rediscovery” in the mid-eighteenth century.

===Tuscan order===
The Tuscan order, also known as Roman Doric, is also a simple design, the base and capital both being series of cylindrical disks of alternating diameter. The shaft is almost never fluted. The proportions vary, but are generally similar to Doric columns. Height to width ratio is about 7:1.

===Ionic order===

The Ionic column is considerably more complex than the Doric or Tuscan. It usually has a base and the shaft is often fluted (it has grooves carved up its length). The capital features a volute, an ornament shaped like a scroll, at the four corners. The height-to-thickness ratio is around 9:1. Due to the more refined proportions and scroll capitals, the Ionic column is sometimes associated with academic buildings. Ionic style columns were used on the second level of the Colosseum.

===Corinthian order===
The Corinthian order is named for the Greek city-state of Corinth, to which it was connected in the period. However, according to the architectural historian Vitruvius, the column was created by the sculptor Callimachus, probably an Athenian, who drew acanthus leaves growing around a votive basket. In fact, the oldest known Corinthian capital was found in Bassae, dated at 427 BC. It is sometimes called the feminine order because it is on the top level of the Colosseum and holding up the least weight, and also has the slenderest ratio of thickness to height. Height to width ratio is about 10:1.

===Composite order===
The Composite order draws its name from the capital being a composite of the Ionic and Corinthian capitals. The acanthus of the Corinthian column already has a scroll-like element, so the distinction is sometimes subtle. Generally the Composite is similar to the Corinthian in proportion and employment, often in the upper tiers of colonnades. Height to width ratio is about 11:1 or 12:1.

===Solomonic===
A Solomonic column, sometimes called &quot;barley sugar&quot;, begins on a base and ends in a capital, which may be of any order, but the shaft twists in a tight spiral, producing a dramatic, serpentine effect of movement. Solomonic columns were developed in the ancient world, but remained rare there. A famous marble set, probably 2nd century, was brought to Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica by Constantine I, and placed round the saint&#x27;s shrine, and was thus familiar throughout the Middle Ages, by which time they were thought to have been removed from the Temple of Jerusalem. The style was used in bronze by Bernini for his spectacular St. Peter&#x27;s baldachin, actually a ciborium (which displaced Constantine&#x27;s columns), and thereafter became very popular with Baroque and Rococo church architects, above all in Latin America, where they were very often used, especially on a small scale, as they are easy to produce in wood by turning on a lathe (hence also the style&#x27;s popularity for spindles on furniture and stairs).

=== Caryatid ===

A Caryatid is a sculpted female figure serving as an architectural support taking the place of a column or a pillar supporting an entablature on her head. The Greek term literally means &quot;maidens of Karyai&quot;, an ancient town of Peloponnese.

===Engaged columns===

In architecture, an engaged column is a column embedded in a wall and partly projecting from the surface of the wall, sometimes defined as semi or three-quarter detached. Engaged columns are rarely found in classical Greek architecture, and then only in exceptional cases, but in Roman architecture they exist in abundance, most commonly embedded in the cella walls of pseudoperipteral buildings.

==Pillar tombs==
Pillar tombs are monumental graves, which typically feature a single, prominent pillar or column, often made of stone. A number of world cultures incorporated pillars into tomb structures. In the ancient Greek colony of Lycia in Anatolia, one of these edifices is located at the tomb of Xanthos. In the town of Hannassa in southern Somalia, ruins of houses with archways and courtyards have also been found along with other pillar tombs, including a rare octagonal tomb.

<text>Carmilla is an 1872 Gothic novella by Irish author Sheridan Le Fanu. It is one of the earliest works of vampire fiction, predating Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; (1897) by 25 years. First published as a serial in &quot;The Dark Blue&quot; (1871–72), the story is narrated by a young woman who is preyed upon by a female vampire named &quot;Carmilla&quot;. The lead character is the original prototypical example of the lesbian vampire, expressing romantic desires toward the protagonist. The story is popularly anthologised, and has been adapted extensively for films, movies, operas, games, comics, television, and other media.

==Publication==
&quot;Carmilla&quot;, serialised in the literary magazine &quot;The Dark Blue&quot; in late 1871 and early 1872, was reprinted in Le Fanu&#x27;s short-story collection &quot;In a Glass Darkly&quot; (1872). Comparing the work of two illustrators of the story, David Henry Friston and Michael Fitzgerald—whose work appears in the magazine article but not in modern printings of the book—reveals inconsistencies in the characters&#x27; depictions. Consequently, confusion has arisen relating the pictures to the plot. Isabella Mazzanti illustrated the book&#x27;s 2014 edition, published by Editions Soleil and translated by Gaid Girard.

==Plot summary==
Le Fanu presents the story as part of the casebook of Dr. Hesselius, whose departures from medical orthodoxy rank him as the first occult detective in literature.

Laura, the teenaged protagonist, narrates, beginning with her childhood in a &quot;picturesque and solitary&quot; castle amid an extensive forest in Styria, where she lives with her father, a wealthy English widower retired from service to the Austrian Empire. When she was six, Laura had a vision of a very beautiful visitor in her bedchamber. She later claims to have been punctured in her breast, although no wound was found. All the household assure Laura that it was just a dream, but they step up security as well and there is no subsequent vision or visitation.

Twelve years later, Laura and her father are admiring the sunset in front of the castle when her father tells her of a letter from his friend, General Spielsdorf. The General was supposed to visit them with his niece, Bertha Rheinfeldt, but Bertha suddenly died under mysterious circumstances. The General ambiguously concludes that he will discuss the circumstances in detail when they meet later.

Laura, saddened by the loss of a potential friend, longs for a companion. A carriage accident outside Laura&#x27;s home unexpectedly brings a girl of Laura&#x27;s age into the family&#x27;s care. Her name is Carmilla. Both girls instantly recognise each other from the &quot;dream&quot; they both had when they were young.

Carmilla appears injured after her carriage accident, but her mysterious mother informs Laura&#x27;s father that her journey is urgent and cannot be delayed. She arranges to leave her daughter with Laura and her father until she can return in three months. Before she leaves, she sternly notes that her daughter will not disclose any information whatsoever about her family, her past, or herself, and that Carmilla is of sound mind. Laura comments that this information seems needless to say, and her father laughs it off.

Carmilla and Laura grow to be very close friends, but occasionally Carmilla&#x27;s mood abruptly changes. She sometimes makes romantic advances towards Laura. Carmilla refuses to tell anything about herself, despite questioning by Laura. Her secrecy is not the only mysterious thing about Carmilla; she never joins the household in its prayers, she sleeps much of the day, and she seems to sleepwalk outside at night.

Meanwhile, young women and girls in the nearby towns have begun dying from an unknown malady. When the funeral procession of one such victim passes by the two girls, Laura joins in the funeral hymn. Carmilla bursts out in rage and scolds Laura, complaining that the hymn hurts her ears.

When a shipment of restored heirloom paintings arrives, Laura finds a portrait of her ancestor, Countess Mircalla Karnstein, dated 1698. The portrait resembles Carmilla exactly, down to the mole on her neck. Carmilla suggests that she might be descended from the Karnsteins, though the family died out centuries before.

During Carmilla&#x27;s stay, Laura has nightmares of a large, cat-like beast entering her room. The beast springs onto the bed and Laura feels something like two needles, an inch or two apart, darting deep into her breast. The beast then takes the form of a female figure and disappears through the door without opening it. In another nightmare, Laura hears a voice say, &quot;Your mother warns you to beware of the assassin,&quot; and a sudden light reveals Carmilla standing at the foot of her bed, her nightdress drenched in blood. Laura&#x27;s health declines, and her father has a doctor examine her. He finds a small, blue spot, an inch or two below her collar, where the creature in her dream bit her, and speaks privately with her father, only asking that Laura never be unattended.

Her father sets out with Laura, in a carriage, for the ruined village of Karnstein, three miles distant. They leave a message behind asking Carmilla and one of the governesses to follow once the perpetually late-sleeping Carmilla awakes. En route to Karnstein, Laura and her father encounter General Spielsdorf. He tells them his own ghastly story.

At a costume ball, Spielsdorf and his niece Bertha had met a very beautiful young woman named Millarca and her enigmatic mother. Bertha was immediately taken with Millarca. The mother convinced the General that she was an old friend of his and asked that Millarca be allowed to stay with them for three weeks while she attended to a secret matter of great importance.

Bertha fell mysteriously ill, suffering the same symptoms as Laura. After consulting with a specially ordered priestly doctor, the General realised that Bertha was being visited by a vampire. He hid with a sword and waited until a large, black creature of undefined shape crawled onto his niece&#x27;s bed and spread itself onto her throat. He leapt from his hiding place and attacked the creature, which had then taken the form of Millarca. She fled through the locked door, unharmed. Bertha died before the morning dawned.

Upon arriving at Karnstein, the General asks a woodman where he can find the tomb of Mircalla Karnstein. The woodman says the tomb was relocated long ago by a Moravian nobleman who vanquished the vampires haunting the region.

While the General and Laura are alone in the ruined chapel, Carmilla appears. The General and Carmilla both fly into a rage upon seeing each other, and the General attacks her with an axe. Carmilla disarms the General and disappears. The General explains that Carmilla is also Millarca, both anagrams for the original name of the vampire Mircalla, Countess Karnstein.

The party is joined by Baron Vordenburg, the descendant of the hero who rid the area of vampires long ago. Vordenburg, an authority on vampires, has discovered that his ancestor was romantically involved with the Countess Karnstein before she died. Using his forefather&#x27;s notes, he locates Mircalla&#x27;s hidden tomb. An imperial commission exhumes the body of Mircalla. Immersed in blood, it seems to be breathing faintly, its heart beating, its eyes open. A stake is driven through its heart, and it gives a corresponding shriek; then, the head is struck off. The body and head are burned to ashes, which are thrown into a river.

Afterwards, Laura&#x27;s father takes his daughter on a year-long tour through Italy to regain her health and recover from the trauma, but she never fully does.

==Motifs==

“Carmilla” exhibits the primary characteristics of Gothic fiction. It includes a supernatural figure, a dark setting of an old castle, a mysterious atmosphere, and ominous or superstitious elements.

In the novella, Le Fanu abolishes the Victorian view of women as merely useful possessions of men, relying on them and needing their constant guardianship. The male characters of the story, such as Laura&#x27;s father and General Spielsdorf, are exposed as being the opposite of the putative Victorian males – helpless and unproductive. The nameless father reaches an agreement with Carmilla&#x27;s mother, whereas Spielsdorf cannot control the faith of his niece, Bertha. Both of these scenes portray women as equal, if not superior to men. This female empowerment is even more clear if we consider Carmilla&#x27;s vampiric predecessors and their relationship with their prey. Carmilla is the opposite of those male vampires – she is actually involved with her victims both emotionally and (theoretically) sexually. Moreover, she is able to exceed even more limitations by dominating death. In the end, her immortality is suggested to be sustained by the river where her ashes had been scattered.

Le Fanu also departs from the negative idea of female parasitism and lesbianism by depicting a mutual and irresistible connection between Carmilla and Laura. The latter, along with other female characters, becomes a symbol of all Victorian women – restrained and judged for their emotional reflexes. The ambiguity of Laura&#x27;s speech and behaviour reveals her struggles with being fully expressive of her concerns and desires.

Another important element of “Carmilla” is the concept of dualism presented through the juxtaposition of vampire and human, as well as lesbian and heterosexual. It is also vivid in Laura&#x27;s irresolution, since she &quot;feels both attraction and repulsion&quot; towards Carmilla. The duality of Carmilla&#x27;s character is suggested by her human attributes, the lack of predatory demeanour, and her shared experience with Laura. According to Gabriella Jönsson, Carmilla can be seen as a representation of the dark side of all mankind.

==Sources==

As with &quot;Dracula&quot;, critics have looked for the sources used in the writing of &quot;Carmilla&quot;. One source used was from a dissertation on magic, vampires, and the apparitions of spirits written by Dom Augustin Calmet entitled &quot;Traité sur les apparitions des esprits et sur les vampires ou les revenants de Hongrie, de Moravie, &amp;c.&quot; (1751). This is evidenced by a report analysed by Calmet, from a priest who learned information of a town being tormented by a vampiric entity three years earlier. Having travelled to the town to investigate and collecting information of the various inhabitants there, the priest learned that a vampire had tormented many of the inhabitants at night by coming from the nearby cemetery and would haunt many of the residents on their beds. An unknown Hungarian traveller came to the town during this period and helped the town by setting a trap at the cemetery and decapitating the vampire that resided there, curing the town of their torment. This story was retold by Le Fanu and adapted into the thirteenth chapter of &quot;Carmilla&quot;.

According to Matthew Gibson, the Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Were-wolves&quot; (1863) and his account of Elizabeth Báthory, Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Christabel&quot; (Part 1, 1797 and Part 2, 1800), and Captain Basil Hall&#x27;s &quot;Schloss Hainfeld; or a Winter in Lower Styria&quot; (London and Edinburgh, 1836) are other sources for Le Fanu&#x27;s &quot;Carmilla&quot;. Hall&#x27;s account provides much of the Styrian background and, in particular, a model for both Carmilla and Laura in the figure of Jane Anne Cranstoun, Countess Purgstall.

==Influence==
Carmilla, the title character, is the original prototype for a legion of female and lesbian vampires. Although Le Fanu portrays his vampire&#x27;s sexuality with the circumspection that one would expect for his time, lesbian attraction evidently is the main dynamic between Carmilla and the narrator of the story:

When compared to other literary vampires of the 19th century, Carmilla is a similar product of a culture with strict sexual mores and tangible religious fear. While Carmilla selected exclusively female victims, she only becomes emotionally involved with a few. Carmilla had nocturnal habits, but was not confined to the darkness. She had unearthly beauty, and was able to change her form and to pass through solid walls. Her animal alter ego was a monstrous black cat, not a large dog as in &quot;Dracula&quot;. She did, however, sleep in a coffin. &quot;Carmilla&quot; works as a Gothic horror story because her victims are portrayed as succumbing to a perverse and unholy temptation that has severe metaphysical consequences for them.

Some critics, among them William Veeder, suggest that &quot;Carmilla&quot;, notably in its outlandish use of narrative frames, was an important influence on Henry James&#x27; &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; (1898).

===Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;===
Le Fanu&#x27;s work has been noted as an influence on Bram Stoker&#x27;s masterwork of the genre, &quot;Dracula&quot;: 
* Both stories are told in the first person. &quot;Dracula&quot; expands on the idea of a first person account by creating a series of journal entries and logs of different persons and creating a plausible background story for their having been compiled. 
* Both authors indulge the air of mystery, though Stoker takes it further than Le Fanu by allowing the characters to solve the enigma of the vampire along with the reader.
* The descriptions of the title character in &quot;Carmilla&quot; and of Lucy in &quot;Dracula&quot; are similar. Additionally, both women sleepwalk.
* Stoker&#x27;s Dr. Abraham Van Helsing is similar to Le Fanu&#x27;s vampire expert Baron Vordenburg: both characters investigate and catalyze actions in opposition to the vampire.
* The symptoms described in &quot;Carmilla&quot; and &quot;Dracula&quot; are highly comparable.
* Both the titular antagonists - Carmilla and Dracula, respectively, pretend to be the descendants of much older nobles bearing the same names, but are eventually revealed to have the same identities. However, with Dracula, this is left ambiguous. Although it is stated by Van Helsing (a character with a slightly awkward grasp of the English language) that he &quot;must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of Turkey-land&quot;, the next statement begins with &quot;If it be so&quot;, thereby leaving a thin margin of ambiguity.
* &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Guest&quot;, a short story by Stoker believed to have been a deleted prologue to &quot;Dracula&quot;, is also set in Styria, where an unnamed Englishman takes shelter in a mausoleum from a storm. There, he meets a female vampire, named Countess Dolingen von Gratz.

==In popular culture==

===Comics===
* In 1991, Aircel Comics published a six-issue black and white miniseries of &quot;Carmilla&quot; by Steven Jones and John Ross. It was based on Le Fanu&#x27;s story and billed as &quot;The Erotic Horror Classic of Female Vampirism&quot;. The first issue was printed in February 1991. The first three issues adapted the original story, while the latter three were a sequel set in the 1930s.
* In March 2021, Warrant Publishing Company launched a nationally distributed newsstand magazine titled &quot;Vampiress Carmilla&quot; which is a bi-monthly black and white illustrated horror comic anthology hosted by the character &quot;Vampiress Carmilla&quot; who introduces each individual horror tale, in the style of the early 1950s E.C.

The collected edition went on to win the Bram Stoker Award for Superior Achievement in a Graphic Novel

===Film===
* Danish director Carl Dreyer loosely adapted &quot;Carmilla&quot; for his film &quot;Vampyr&quot; (1932) but deleted any references to lesbian sexuality. The credits of the original film say that the film is based on &quot;In a Glass Darkly&quot;. This collection contains five tales, one of which is &quot;Carmilla&quot;. Actually the film draws its central character, Allan Gray, from Le Fanu&#x27;s Dr. Hesselius; and the scene in which Gray is buried alive is drawn from &quot;The Room in the Dragon Volant&quot;.
* &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1936), Universal Pictures&#x27; sequel to 1931 Dracula film, was loosely based on &quot;Carmilla&quot;.
* French director Roger Vadim&#x27;s &quot;Et mourir de plaisir&quot; (shown in the UK and US as &quot;Blood and Roses&quot;, 1960) is based on &quot;Carmilla&quot;. The Vadim film thoroughly explores the lesbian implications behind Carmilla&#x27;s selection of victims, and boasts cinematography by Claude Renoir. The film&#x27;s lesbian eroticism was, however, significantly cut for its US release. Annette Stroyberg, Elsa Martinelli and Mel Ferrer star in the film.
* A more-or-less faithful adaptation starring Christopher Lee was produced in Italy in 1963 under the title &quot;La cripta e l&#x27;incubo&quot; (&quot;Crypt of the Vampire&quot; in English). The character of Laura, played by Adriana Ambesi, fears herself possessed by the spirit of a dead ancestor, played by Ursula Davis (also known as Pier Anna Quaglia).
* &quot;The Vampire Lovers&quot; (1970), the first of film in &quot;The Karnstein Trilogy&quot; was based on the novel and featured Ingrid Pitt as Carmilla.
* &quot;The Blood Spattered Bride&quot; (1972) (&quot;La novia ensangrentada&quot;) is a 1972 Spanish horror film written and directed by Vicente Aranda, is based on the text. The film has reached cult status for its mix of horror, vampirism and seduction with lesbian overtones. British actress Alexandra Bastedo plays Mircalla Karnstein, and Maribel Martín is her victim.
* The 2000 Japanese anime film &quot;Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust&quot; features Carmilla &quot;the Bloody Countess&quot; as its primary antagonist. Having been slain by Dracula for her vain and gluttonous tyranny, Carmilla&#x27;s ghost attempts to use the blood of a virgin to bring about her own resurrection. She was voiced by Julia Fletcher in English and Beverly Maeda in Japanese. 
* In the direct-to-video movie &quot;The Batman vs. Dracula&quot; (2005), Carmilla Karnstein is mentioned as Count Dracula&#x27;s bride, who had been incinerated by sunlight years ago. Dracula hoped to revive her by sacrificing Vicki Vale&#x27;s soul, but the ritual was stopped by the Batman.
* Carmilla is featured as the main antagonist in the movie &quot;Lesbian Vampire Killers&quot; (2009), a comedy starring Paul McGann and James Corden, with Silvia Colloca as Carmilla.
* The book is directly referenced several times in the 2011 film, &quot;The Moth Diaries&quot;, the film version of Rachel Klein&#x27;s novel. There are conspicuous similarities between the characters in &quot;Carmilla&quot; and those in the film, and the book figures into the film&#x27;s plot.
* &quot;The Unwanted&quot; (2014) from writer/director Brent Wood relocates the story to the contemporary southern United States, with Hannah Fierman as Laura, Christen Orr as Carmilla, and Kylie Brown as Millarca.
* &quot;The Curse of Styria&quot; (2014), alternately titled &quot;Angels of Darkness&quot; is an adaptation of the novel set in late 1980s with Julia Pietrucha as Carmilla and Eleanor Tomlinson as Lara.
* In 2017 &quot;The Carmilla Movie&quot;, based on the 2015 web series of the same name was released. Directed by Spencer Maybee and produced by Steph Ouaknine, the movie follows up the web series 5 years after the finale.
*&quot;Carmilla&quot; (2019), written and directed by Emily Harris, was inspired by the novella. Fifteen-year-old Lara (Hannah Rae) develops feelings for Carmilla (Devrim Lingnau), but her strict governess believes their strange houseguest is a vampire. Harris says she &quot;stripped back&quot; the supernatural layers to consider the story as a &quot;derailed love story&quot; and &quot;a story about our tendency as humans to demonize the other&quot;.

===Music===

====Opera====
* A chamber opera version of &quot;Carmilla&quot; appeared in &quot;Carmilla: A Vampire Tale&quot; (1970), music by Ben Johnston, script by Wilford Leach. Seated on a sofa, Laura and Carmilla recount the story retrospectively in song.

====Rock music====

<text>Clitoridectomy or clitorectomy is the surgical removal, reduction, or partial removal of the clitoris. It is rarely used as a therapeutic medical procedure, such as when cancer has developed in or spread to the clitoris. Commonly, non-medical removal of the clitoris is performed during female genital mutilation.
==Medical uses==

===Malignancies===
A clitoridectomy is often done to remove malignancy or necrosis of the clitoris. This is sometimes done along with a radical complete vulvectomy. Surgery may also become necessary due to therapeutic radiation treatments to the pelvic area.

Removal of the clitoris may be due to malignancy or trauma.

=== Clitoromegaly and other conditions ===
Female infants born with a 46,XX genotype but have a clitoris size affected by congenital adrenal hyperplasia and are treated surgically with vaginoplasty that often reduces the size of the clitoris without its total removal. The atypical size of the clitoris is due to an endocrine imbalance in utero. Other reasons for the surgery include issues involving microphallism and those who have Müllerian agenesis. Treatments on children raise human rights concerns.

==Technique==
Clitoridectomy surgical techniques are used to remove an invasive malignancy that extends to the clitoris. Standard surgical procedures are followed in these cases. This includes evaluation and biopsy. Other factors that will affect the technique selected are age, other existing medical conditions, and obesity. Other considerations are the probability of extended hospital care and the development of infection at the surgical site.

The surgery proceeds with the use of general anesthesia, and prior to the vulvectomy/clitoridectomy an inguinal lymphadenectomy is first done. The extent of the surgical site extends beyond the boundaries of malignancy. Superficial lymph nodes may also need to be removed. If the malignancy is present in any muscles in the region, then the affected muscle tissue is also removed. In some cases, the surgeon is able to preserve the clitoris despite extensive malignancy. The cancerous tissue is removed and the incision is closed.

Post-operative care may employ the use of suction drainage to allow the deeper tissues to heal toward the surface. Follow-up after surgery includes the stripping of the drainage device to prevent blockage. A typical hospital stay can last up to two weeks. The site of the surgery is left unbandaged to allow for frequent examination.

Complications can include the development of lymphedema; not removing the saphenous vein during the surgery can help prevent this. In some instances, the buildup of fluid can be reduced through methods such as foot elevation, diuretic medication, and wearing compression stockings.

In a clitoridectomy for infants with a clitoromegaly, the clitoris is often reduced instead of removed. The surgeon cuts the shaft of the elongated phallus and sews the glans and preserved nerves back onto the stump. In a less common surgery called clitoral recession, the surgeon hides the clitoral shaft under a fold of skin so only the glans remains visible.

==Society and culture==
===General===
While much feminist scholarship has described clitoridectomy as a practice aimed at controlling women&#x27;s sexuality, the historic emergence of the practice in ancient European and Middle Eastern cultures may also have derived from ideas about what a normal female genitalia should look like and the policing of boundaries between the sexes.

In the seventeenth century, anatomists remained divided on whether a clitoris was a normal female organ, with some arguing that it was an abnormality in female development and, if large enough to be visible, it should always be removed at birth. In the 19th century, a clitoridectomy was thought by some to curb female masturbation; until the late 19th century, masturbation was thought by many to be unhealthy or immoral. Isaac Baker Brown (1812–1873), an English gynaecologist who was president of the Medical Society of London believed that the &quot;unnatural irritation&quot; of the clitoris caused epilepsy, hysteria, and mania, and he worked &quot;to remove [it] whenever he had the opportunity of doing so&quot;, according to his obituary in the &quot;Medical Times and Gazette&quot;. Peter Lewis Allen writes that Brown&#x27;s views caused outrage, and he died penniless after being expelled from the Obstetrical Society.

Occasionally, in American and English medicine of the nineteenth century, circumcision was done as a cure for insanity. Some believed that mental and emotional disorders were related to female reproductive organs and that removing the clitoris would cure the neurosis. This treatment was discontinued in 1867.

Aesthetics may determine clitoral norms. A lack of ambiguity of the genitalia is seen as necessary in the assignment of a sex to infants and therefore whether a child&#x27;s genitalia is normal, but what is considered ambiguous or normal can vary from person to person.

Sexual behavior is another reason for clitoridectomies. Author Sarah Rodriguez stated that the history of medical textbooks has indirectly created accepted ideas about the female body. Medical and gynecological textbooks are also at fault in the way that the clitoris is described in comparison to a male&#x27;s penis. The importance and originality of a female&#x27;s clitoris is underscored because it is seen as &quot;a less significant organ, since anatomy texts compared the penis and the clitoris in only one direction.&quot; Rodriguez said that a male&#x27;s penis created the framework of the sexual organ.
Not all historical examples of clitoral surgeries should be assumed to be clitoridectomy (removal of the clitoris). In the nineteen thirties, the French psychoanalyst Marie Bonaparte studied African clitoral surgical practices and showed that these often involved removal of the clitoral hood, not the clitoris. She also had a surgery done to her own clitoris by the Viennese surgeon Dr Halban, which entailed cutting the suspensory ligament of the clitoris to permit it to sit closer to her vaginal opening. These sorts of clitoral surgeries, contrary to reducing women&#x27;s sexual pleasure, actually appear aimed at making coitus more pleasurable for women, though it is unclear if that is ever their actual outcome.

===Human rights concerns===

Clitoridectomies are the most common form of female genital mutilation. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that clitoridectomies have been performed on 200 million girls and women that are currently alive. The regions that most clitoridectomies take place are Asia, the Middle East and west, north and east Africa. The practice also exists in migrants originating from these regions. Most of the surgeries are for cultural or religious reasons.

Clitoridectomy of people with conditions such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia that cause a clitoromegaly is controversial when it takes place during childhood or under duress. Many women who were exposed to such treatment have reported loss of physical sensation in the affected area, and loss of autonomy. In recent years, multiple human rights institutions have criticized early surgical management of such characteristics.

In 2013, it was disclosed in a medical journal that four unnamed elite female athletes from developing countries were subjected to gonadectomies and partial clitoridectomies after testosterone testing revealed that they had an intersex variation or disorder of sex development. In April 2016, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on health, Dainius Pūras, condemned this treatment as a form of genital mutilation &quot;in the absence of symptoms or health issues warranting those procedures.&quot;

<doc id="6924" wikidata="Q1416414" url="?curid=6924" title="Cabal">
<text>A cabal is a group of people who are united in some close design, usually to promote their private views or interests in an ideology, a state, or another community, often by and usually without the knowledge of those who are outside their group. The use of this term usually carries negative connotations of political purpose, conspiracy and secrecy. It can also refer to a secret plot or a clique, or it may be used as a verb (to form a cabal or secretly conspire).

== Etymology ==

The term &quot;cabal&quot; is derived from Kabbalah (a word that has numerous spelling variations), the Jewish mystical interpretation of the Hebrew scripture (קַבָּלָה). In Hebrew, it means &quot;received doctrine&quot; or &quot;tradition&quot;, while in European culture (Christian Cabala, Hermetic Qabalah) it became associated with occult doctrine or a secret.

It came into English via the French &quot;cabale&quot; from the medieval Latin &quot;cabbala&quot;, and was known early in the 17th century through usages linked to Charles II and Oliver Cromwell. By the middle of the 17th century, it had developed further to mean some intrigue entered into by a small group and also referred to the group of people so involved, i.e. a semi-secret political clique.

There is a theory that the term took on its present meaning from a group of ministers formed in 1668 – the &quot;Cabal ministry&quot; of King Charles II of England. Members included Sir Thomas Clifford, Lord Arlington, the Duke of Buckingham, Lord Ashley and Lord Lauderdale, whose initial letters coincidentally spelled CABAL, and who were the signatories of the public Treaty of Dover that allied England to France in a prospective war against the Netherlands, and served as a cover for the Secret Treaty of Dover. The theory that the word originated as an acronym from the names of the group of ministers is a folk etymology, although the coincidence was noted at the time and could possibly have popularized its use.

== Usage in the Netherlands ==

In Dutch, the word &quot;kabaal&quot;, also &quot;kabale&quot; or &quot;cabale,&quot; was used during the 18th century in the same way. The &quot;Friesche Kabaal&quot; (Frisian Cabal) denoted the Frisian pro-Orange nobility which supported the &quot;stadholderate&quot;, but also had great influence on &quot;stadtholders&quot; Willem IV and Willem V and their regents, and therefore on the matters of state in the Dutch Republic. This influence came to an end when the major Frisian nobles at the court fell out of favor. The word nowadays has the meaning of noise, uproar, racket. It was derived as such from French and mentioned for the first time in 1845.

==Conspiratorial discourse==
Followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory use &quot;The Cabal&quot; to refer to what is perceived as a secret worldwide elite organization who, according to proponents, wish to undermine democracy and freedom, and implement their own globalist agendas.

Some anti-government movements in Australia, particularly those that emerged during Canberra&#x27;s response to the pandemic, that Scott Morrison’s secret ministerial appointments were evidence of what they said was happening all along – a &quot;secret cabal&quot;.

The term is sometimes employed as an antisemitic dog whistle due to its evocation of centuries-old antisemitic tropes.

<doc id="6925" wikidata="Q408068" url="?curid=6925" title="Cytochrome">
<text>Cytochromes are redox-active proteins containing a heme, with a central iron (Fe) atom at its core, as a cofactor. They are involved in the electron transport chain and redox catalysis. They are classified according to the type of heme and its mode of binding. Four varieties are recognized by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB), cytochromes a, cytochromes b, cytochromes c and cytochrome d. 

Cytochrome function is linked to the reversible redox change from ferrous (Fe(II)) to the ferric (Fe(III)) oxidation state of the iron found in the heme core. In addition to the classification by the IUBMB into four cytochrome classes, several additional classifications such as cytochrome o and cytochrome P450 can be found in biochemical literature.

==History==
Cytochromes were initially described in 1884 by Charles Alexander MacMunn as respiratory pigments (myohematin or histohematin). In the 1920s, Keilin rediscovered these respiratory pigments and named them the cytochromes, or “cellular pigments”. He classified these heme proteins on the basis of the position of their lowest energy absorption band in their reduced state, as
cytochromes &quot;a&quot; (605 nm), &quot;b&quot; (≈565 nm), and &quot;c&quot; (550 nm). The ultra-violet (UV) to visible spectroscopic signatures of hemes are still used to identify heme type from the reduced bis-pyridine-ligated state, i.e., the pyridine hemochrome method. Within each class, cytochrome &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, or &quot;c&quot;, early cytochromes are numbered consecutively, e.g. cyt &quot;c&quot;, cyt &quot;c1&quot;, and cyt &quot;c2&quot;, with more recent examples designated by their reduced state R-band maximum, e.g. cyt &quot;c559&quot;.

==Structure and function==
The heme group is a highly conjugated ring system (which allows its electrons to be very mobile) surrounding an iron ion. The iron in cytochromes usually exists in a ferrous (Fe2+) and a ferric (Fe3+) state with a ferroxo (Fe4+) state found in catalytic intermediates. Cytochromes are, thus, capable of performing electron transfer reactions and catalysis by reduction or oxidation of their heme iron. The cellular location of cytochromes depends on their function. They can be found as globular proteins and membrane proteins.

In the process of oxidative phosphorylation, a globular cytochrome cc protein is involved in the electron transfer from the membrane-bound complex III to complex IV. Complex III itself is composed of several subunits, one of which is a b-type cytochrome while another one is a c-type cytochrome. Both domains are involved in electron transfer within the complex. Complex IV contains a cytochrome a/a3-domain that transfers electrons and catalyzes the reaction of oxygen to water. Photosystem II, the first protein complex in the light-dependent reactions of oxygenic photosynthesis, contains a cytochrome b subunit. Cyclooxygenase 2, an enzyme involved in inflammation, is a cytochrome b protein.

In the early 1960s, a linear evolution of cytochromes was suggested by Emanuel Margoliash that led to the molecular clock hypothesis. The apparently constant evolution rate of cytochromes can be a helpful tool in trying to determine when various organisms may have diverged from a common ancestor.

==Types==
Several kinds of cytochrome exist and can be distinguished by spectroscopy, exact structure of the heme group, inhibitor sensitivity, and reduction potential.

Four types of cytochromes are distinguished by their prosthetic groups:

There is no &quot;cytochrome e,&quot; but cytochrome f, found in the cytochrome b6f complex of plants is a c-type cytochrome.

In mitochondria and chloroplasts, these cytochromes are often combined in electron transport and related metabolic pathways:

A distinct family of cytochromes is the cytochrome P450 family, so named for the characteristic Soret peak formed by absorbance of light at wavelengths near 450 nm when the heme iron is reduced (with sodium dithionite) and complexed to carbon monoxide. These enzymes are primarily involved in steroidogenesis and detoxification.

<text>Crowded House are an Australian and New Zealand rock band, formed in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, in 1985. Its founding members were Neil Finn (vocalist, guitarist, primary songwriter) and Paul Hester (drums), who were both former members of Split Enz, and Nick Seymour (bass). Later band members included Finn&#x27;s brother Tim, who was in their former band Split Enz; sons Liam and Elroy; as well as Americans Mark Hart and Matt Sherrod. Neil Finn and Seymour are the sole constant members.

Originally active from 1985 to 1996, Crowded House had consistent commercial and critical success in Australia and New Zealand. They achieved success in the United States with their self-titled debut album, which provided the Top Ten hits &quot;Don&#x27;t Dream It&#x27;s Over&quot; and &quot;Something So Strong&quot;. Further international success came in the UK, Europe, and South Africa in the early 1990s with their third and fourth albums (&quot;Woodface&quot; and &quot;Together Alone&quot;) and the compilation album &quot;Recurring Dream&quot;, which included the hits &quot;Fall at Your Feet&quot;, &quot;Weather with You&quot;, &quot;Distant Sun&quot;, &quot;Locked Out&quot;, &quot;Instinct&quot;, and &quot;Not the Girl You Think You Are&quot;. Neil and Tim Finn were each awarded an OBE in June 1993 for their contributions to the music of New Zealand.

Crowded House disbanded in 1996 following several farewell concerts that year, including the &quot;Farewell to the World&quot; concerts in Melbourne and Sydney. Hester died by suicide in 2005. A year later, the group re-formed with drummer Matt Sherrod and released two further albums (&quot;Time on Earth&quot; and &quot;Intriguer&quot;), each of which reached number one in Australia. The band went on another hiatus, and reunited in 2020 with a new line-up featuring Neil Finn, Nick Seymour, Mitchell Froom, and Finn&#x27;s sons Liam and Elroy. Their most recent album, &quot;Gravity Stairs&quot;, was released in 2024.

As of 2021, Crowded House have sold over 15 million albums worldwide. In November 2016, the band was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame.

==History==
Neil Finn (vocals, guitar, piano) and drummer Paul Hester (the Cheks, Deckchairs Overboard) were former members of New Zealand band Split Enz, which spent part of 1975–6 in Australia and several years in England. Neil Finn is the younger brother of Split Enz founding member Tim Finn, who joined Crowded House in 1990 on vocals, guitars, and keyboards for the album &quot;Woodface&quot;. Bassist Nick Seymour (Plays with Marionettes, Bang, The Horla) is the younger brother of singer-songwriter and guitarist Mark Seymour of Australian rock group Hunters &amp; Collectors.

===Formation and name change (1984–1986)===

Finn and Hester decided to form a new band during the first Split Enz farewell tour, &quot;Enz with a Bang&quot;, in late 1984. Seymour approached Finn during the after party for the Melbourne show and asked if he could audition for the new band. The Mullanes formed in Melbourne in early 1985 with Finn, Hester, Seymour, and guitarist Craig Hooper (the Reels) and first performed on 11 June. They secured a record contract with Capitol Records, but Hooper left the band before the remaining trio moved to Los Angeles to record their debut album.

At Capitol&#x27;s behest, the band&#x27;s name was changed to Crowded House, which alluded to the lack of space at the small Hollywood Hills house they shared during the recording of the album &quot;Crowded House&quot;. Former Split Enz keyboardist Eddie Rayner produced the track &quot;Can&#x27;t Carry On&quot; and was asked to join the band. He toured with them in 1988, but was unable to become a full member due to family commitments.

===Early albums (1986–1990)===
Thanks to their Split Enz connection, the newly formed Crowded House had an established Australasian fanbase. They began by playing at festivals in Australia and New Zealand and released their debut album, &quot;Crowded House&quot;, in August 1986. Capitol Records initially failed to see the band&#x27;s potential and gave them only low-key promotion, forcing the band to play at small venues to try to gain attention. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Mean to Me&quot;, reached the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart top 30 in June. It failed to chart in the US, but moderate American airplay introduced US listeners to the group.

The next single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Dream It&#x27;s Over&quot;, was released in October 1986 and proved an international hit, reaching number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number one in Canada. New Zealand radio stations initially gave the song little support until months later when it became internationally successful. Ultimately, the song reached number one on the New Zealand singles chart and number eight in Australia. It remains the group&#x27;s most commercially successful song.

In March 1987 the group were awarded &quot;Best New Talent&quot;, along with &quot;Song of the Year&quot; and &quot;Best Video&quot; awards for &quot;Don&#x27;t Dream It&#x27;s Over&quot;, at the inaugural ARIA Music Awards. The video also earned the group the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist that year. The song has often been covered by other artists and gave Paul Young a hit single in 1991. It was also used for a New Zealand Tourism Board advertisement in its &quot;100% Pure New Zealand&quot; worldwide promotion from October 2005. In May 2001, &quot;Don&#x27;t Dream it&#x27;s Over&quot; was voted seventh in a poll of the best Australian songs of all time by the Australasian Performing Right Association.

In June 1987, nearly a year after its release, &quot;Crowded House&quot; finally reached number one on the Kent Music Report Album Charts. It also reached number three in New Zealand and number twelve in the US. The follow-up to &quot;Don&#x27;t Dream it&#x27;s Over&quot;, &quot;Something So Strong&quot;, was another global smash, reaching the Top 10 in New Zealand America, and Canada. &quot;World Where You Live&quot; and &quot;Now We&#x27;re Getting Somewhere&quot; were also released as singles with chart success.

As the band&#x27;s primary songwriter, Neil Finn was under pressure to create a second album to match their debut and the band joked that one potential title for the new release was &quot;Mediocre Follow-Up&quot;. Eventually titled &quot;Temple of Low Men&quot;, their second album was released in July 1988 with strong promotion by Capitol Records. The album did not fare as well as their debut in the US, only reaching number 40 and selling around 200,000 copies, but it achieved Australasian success, reaching number one in Australia and number two in New Zealand. The first single &quot;Better Be Home Soon&quot; peaked at number two on both Australian and New Zealand singles charts and reached top 50 in the US, though the following four singles were less successful.

Crowded House undertook a short tour of Australia and Canada to promote the album, with Eddie Rayner on keyboards. Multi-instrumentalist Mark Hart, who would eventually become a full band member, replaced Rayner in January 1989. After the tour, Finn fired Seymour from the band. Music journalist Ed Nimmervoll claimed that Seymour&#x27;s temporary departure was because Finn blamed him for causing his writer&#x27;s block; however, Finn cited &quot;artistic differences&quot; as the reason. Seymour said that after a month he contacted Finn and they agreed that he would return to the band.

===Early 1990s (1991–1994)===
Crowded House took a break after the Canadian leg of the &quot;Temple of Low Men&quot; tour. Neil Finn and his brother Tim recorded songs they had co-written for their own album, &quot;Finn&quot;. Following the recording sessions with Tim, Neil began writing and recording a third Crowded House album with Hester and Seymour, but these tracks were rejected by the record company, so Neil asked Tim if Crowded House could use the &quot;Finn&quot; songs. Tim jokingly agreed on the proviso that he become a member, which Neil apparently took literally. With Tim as an official member, the band returned to the studio.

The new tracks, as well as some from the previously rejected recordings were combined to make &quot;Woodface&quot;, which was released in July 1991. The album features eight tracks co-written by Neil and Tim, which feature the brothers harmonising on lead vocals, except on the sombre &quot;All I Ask&quot; on which Tim sang lead. The track was later used on AIDS awareness commercials in Australia. Five of the album&#x27;s tracks were Neil&#x27;s solo compositions and two were by Hester, the exuberant &quot;Italian Plastic&quot;, which became a crowd favourite at concerts and the hidden track &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot;.

&quot;Chocolate Cake&quot;, a humorous comment on American excesses that was not taken well by some US critics and sections of the American public was released in June 1991 as the first single. It failed to chart in the US; however, it reached number two on Billboard&#x27;s Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song peaked at number seven in New Zealand and reached the top 20 in Australia. The second single, &quot;Fall at Your Feet&quot;, was less successful in Australia and New Zealand but did at least reach the US Hot 100. The album reached number one in New Zealand, number two in Australia, number six in the UK and made the top 20 in several European countries. The third single from &quot;Woodface&quot;, &quot;Weather With You&quot;, peaked at No. 7 in early 1992 giving the band their highest UK chart placement. By contrast, the album had limited success in the US, only reaching number 83 on the Billboard 200 Album Chart and selling 225,000 copies.

Despite the success of the album, Tim Finn left Crowded House suddenly part-way through the UK leg of the &quot;Woodface&quot; tour, a few hours before the band were due to play at King Tut&#x27;s Club in Glasgow on 1 November 1991. Neil Finn noted that &quot;on stage, it just didn&#x27;t feel right for us or him. We&#x27;re very off-the-cuff and conversational, whereas Tim is into creating a spectacle and the two approaches don&#x27;t gel all that well... We&#x27;d all open our mouths at the same time and then stop and go, Oh, after you. From Tim&#x27;s point of view it was quite a relief to put it all on the table, I think. For half the set he was standing there with his acoustic guitar, not really feeling part of it.&quot; Paul Hester commented that &quot;both sides felt good about parting before it could get ugly.&quot;

Performances on the UK tour, at the Town and Country Club in London, were recorded live and given a limited release in Australia, while individual songs from those shows were released as B-sides of singles in some countries. In June 1993 the New Zealand Government recommended that the Queen award an OBE to Neil and Tim Finn for their contribution to the music of New Zealand.

For their fourth album, &quot;Together Alone&quot;, Crowded House used producer Martin Glover (aka &quot;Youth&quot;) and invited touring musician Mark Hart (guitar and keyboards) to become a permanent band member. The album was recorded at Karekare Beach, New Zealand, which gave its name to the opening track, &quot;Kare Kare&quot;. The album was released in October 1993 and sold well internationally on the strength of lead single &quot;Distant Sun&quot; and followup &quot;Private Universe&quot;. It topped the New Zealand Album Chart, reached number 2 in Australia and number 4 in the UK. &quot;Locked Out&quot; was the album&#x27;s first US single and received airplay on MTV and VH1. This track and &quot;My Sharona&quot; by the Knack, which were both included on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Reality Bites&quot;, were bundled together on a jukebox single to promote the film soundtrack.

===Saying farewell (1994–1996)===
Crowded House were midway through a US tour when Paul Hester quit the band on 15 April 1994. He flew home to Melbourne to await the birth of his first child and indicated that he required more time with his family. Wally Ingram, drummer for support act Sheryl Crow, temporarily filled in until a replacement, Peter Jones (ex-Harem Scarem, Vince Jones, Kate Ceberano&#x27;s Septet) was found. After the tour, the Finn Brothers released their album &quot;Finn&quot; in November 1995. In June 1996, at a press conference to announce the release of their greatest hits album &quot;Recurring Dream&quot;, Neil revealed that Crowded House were to disband. The June 1996 concerts in Europe and Canada were to be their final performances.

&quot;Recurring Dream&quot; contained four songs from each of the band&#x27;s studio albums, along with three new songs. The album debuted at number one in Australia, New Zealand and the UK in July 1996. Early copies included a bonus CD of live material. The album&#x27;s three new songs, which were released as singles, were &quot;Instinct&quot;, &quot;Not the Girl You Think You Are&quot; and &quot;Everything Is Good for You&quot;, which featured backing vocals from Pearl Jam&#x27;s Eddie Vedder. Paul Hester returned to the band to play drums on the three new tracks.

Worried that their goodbye had been too low-key and had disregarded their home fans, the band performed the &quot;Farewell to the World&quot; concert on the steps of the Sydney Opera House on 24 November 1996, which raised funds for the Sydney Children&#x27;s Hospital. The concert featured the line-up of Neil Finn, Nick Seymour, Mark Hart and Paul Hester. Tim Finn and Peter Jones both made guest appearances. Support bands on the day were Custard, Powderfinger and You Am I. The concert had one of the highest live audiences in Australian history with the crowd being estimated at between 120,000 and 250,000 people. &quot;Farewell to the World&quot; was released on VHS in December 1996. In 2007, a double CD and a DVD were issued to commemorate the concert&#x27;s tenth anniversary. The DVD featured newly recorded audio commentary by Finn, Hart and Seymour and other new bonus material.

===Between farewell and reunion (1996–2006)===

Following the 1996 break-up of Crowded House, the members embarked upon a variety of projects. Neil Finn released two solo studio albums, &quot;Try Whistling This&quot; (1998) and &quot;One Nil&quot; (2001), as well as two live albums, &quot;Sessions at West 54th&quot; (2000) and &quot;7 Worlds Collide&quot; (2001). &quot;7 Worlds Collide&quot; saw him performing with guest musicians including Eddie Vedder, Johnny Marr, Ed O&#x27;Brien and Phil Selway of Radiohead, Tim Finn, Sebastian Steinberg, Lisa Germano and Betchadupa (featuring his son Liam Finn). A double CD and DVD of the shows were released in November 2001.

Tim Finn had resumed his solo career after leaving the group in 1992 and he also worked with Neil on a second Finn Brothers album, &quot;Everyone Is Here&quot;, which was released in 2004. Paul Hester joined The Finn Brothers on stage for three songs at their Palais Theatre show in Melbourne at the end of 2004. Nick Seymour also joined them on stage in Dublin, where he was living, in 2004. Peter Jones and Nick Seymour joined Australian group Deadstar for their second album, &quot;Milk&quot;, in 1997. Seymour later worked as a record producer in Dublin, producing Irish group Bell X1&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Neither Am I&quot; in 2000. Mark Hart rejoined Supertramp in the late 1990s and later toured with Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band. In 2001 he released a solo album, &quot;Nada Sonata&quot;.

Paul Hester worked with children&#x27;s entertainers the Wiggles, playing &quot;Paul the Cook&quot;. He also had his own ABC show &quot;Hessie&#x27;s Shed&quot; in Australia from late 1997. He formed the band Largest Living Things, which was the name rejected by Capitol Records in favour of Crowded House. It was on &quot;Hessie&#x27;s Shed&quot; that Finn, Hester and Seymour last shared a stage, on an episode filmed as part of Finn&#x27;s promotion for his solo album &quot;Try Whistling This&quot; in 1998. Finn and Hester performed &quot;Not the Girl You Think You Are&quot; with Largest Living Things, before being joined by Seymour for &quot;Sister Madly&quot; and a version of Paul Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Leaps and Bounds&quot;, which also featured Kelly on vocals. In late 2003, Hester hosted the series &quot;Music Max&#x27;s Sessions&quot;. Hester and Seymour were reunited when they both joined singer-songwriter Matt O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s Melbourne-based group Tarmac Adam. The band released one album, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Handheld Torch&quot;, which was produced by Seymour.

In May 1999 Crowded House issued a compilation of unreleased songs, &quot;Afterglow&quot;, which included the track &quot;Recurring Dream&quot;, recorded when the group were still called The Mullanes and included Craig Hooper on guitar. The album&#x27;s liner notes included information about the songs, written by music journalist David Hepworth. Some limited-release versions included a second CD with songwriting commentary by Finn. The liner notes confirmed that Crowded House had no plans to reunite at that time. A 2003 compilation album, &quot;Classic Masters&quot;, was released only in the US, while 2005 saw the release of the album &quot;She Will Have Her Way&quot;, a collection of cover versions of Crowded House, Split Enz, Tim Finn and Finn Brothers songs by Australasian female artists. The album reached the top 5 in Australia and New Zealand.

On 26 March 2005 Paul Hester was found dead. He had committed suicide by hanging himself from a tree in a park near his home in Melbourne. He was 46 years old. His obituary in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; stated that he had fought &quot;a long battle with depression.&quot; Following the news of Hester&#x27;s death, Nick Seymour joined The Finn Brothers on stage at the Royal Albert Hall in London, where the three played in memory of Hester. A snare drum with a top hat on it stood at the front of the stage as a tribute. Writing in 2010 Neil Finn said, &quot;When we lost Paul it was like someone pulled the rug out from underneath everything, a terrible jolt out of the dark blue. He was the best drummer I had ever played with and for many years, my closest friend.&quot;

===Reunion and &quot;Time on Earth&quot; (2006–2009)===

In 2006 Neil Finn asked Nick Seymour to play bass on his third solo album. Seymour agreed and the two joined up with producer and multi-instrumentalist Ethan Johns to begin recording. As the recording sessions progressed it was decided that the album would be issued under the Crowded House band name, rather than as a Neil Finn solo album. In January 2007, the group publicly announced their reformation and on 23 February, after 20 days of auditions, former Beck drummer Matt Sherrod joined Finn, Seymour and Mark Hart to complete the new line up. As Sherrod and Hart had not participated in the initial sessions, four new tracks were recorded with producer Steve Lillywhite including the album&#x27;s first single &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Now&quot;.

On 17 March 2007 the band played a live show at their rehearsal studio in front of around fifty fans, friends and family. The performance was streamed live as a webcast. The two-and-a-half-hour set included some new tracks, including &quot;Silent House&quot; co-written by Finn with the Dixie Chicks. A concert onboard &quot;The Thekla&quot;, moored in Bristol, followed on 19 March. Crowded House played at the Marquee Theatre in Tempe, Arizona on 26 April as a warm-up for their appearance at the Coachella Festival on 29 April in Indio, California. They played at the Australian Live Earth concert in Sydney on 7 July. The next day, Finn and Seymour were interviewed on &quot;Rove Live&quot; and the band, with Hart and Sherrod, performed &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Now&quot; to promote the new album, which was titled &quot;Time on Earth&quot;. The single was a minor hit in Australia and the UK. The album was released worldwide in June and July. It topped the album chart in New Zealand and made number 2 in Australia and number 3 in the UK.

On 6 December 2008 Crowded House played the Homebake festival in Sydney, with warm up gigs at small venues in Hobart, Melbourne and Sydney. For these shows the band were augmented by multi-instrumentalist Don McGlashan and Neil&#x27;s younger son, Elroy Finn, on guitar. On 14 March 2009 the band joined Neil&#x27;s older son, Liam Finn, on stage for three songs at the Sound Relief concert in Melbourne.

===&quot;Intriguer&quot;, second split and Sydney Opera House shows (2009–2018)===
Crowded House began recording their follow-up to &quot;Time on Earth&quot; in April 2009, at Finn&#x27;s own Roundhead Studios. The album, &quot;Intriguer&quot;, was produced by Jim Scott who had worked on &quot;The Sun Came Out&quot; by Neil&#x27;s 7 Worlds Collide project. In August 2009, Finn travelled to Los Angeles to record some overdubs at Jim Scott&#x27;s Los Angeles studio before they began mixing tracks. The album was released in June 2010, in time for the band&#x27;s appearance at the West Coast Blues &amp; Roots Festival near Perth. Finn stated that the album contains some, &quot;Unexpected twists and turns&quot; and some songs that, &quot;Sound like nothing we&#x27;ve done before.&quot; &quot;Intriguer&quot; topped the Australian album chart, reached number 3 in New Zealand and number 12 in the UK.

Crowded House undertook an extensive world tour in 2010 in support of &quot;Intriguer&quot;. This was the first album where the band regularly interacted with fans via the internet on their own re-launched website. The band sold recordings of the shows on the &quot;Intriguer&quot; tour on USB flash drives and made individual live tracks available for free download.

A new compilation album, &quot;The Very Very Best of Crowded House&quot;, was released in October 2010 to celebrate the band&#x27;s 25th anniversary. It includes 19 of the band&#x27;s greatest hits and is also available in a box set with a 25 track DVD of their music videos. A deluxe digital version, available for download only, has 32 tracks including a rare 1987 live recording of the band&#x27;s version of the Hunters &amp; Collectors song &quot;Throw Your Arms Around Me&quot;. No mention of this album has been made on the band&#x27;s official website or Twitter page, which suggests that they are not involved with its release.

Following the success of the album &quot;She Will Have Her Way&quot; in 2005, a second album of cover versions of Finn Brothers songs (including Crowded House songs) was released on 12 November 2010. Entitled &quot;He Will Have His Way&quot;, all tracks are performed by Australasian male artists.

In November 2011 an Australian tour featured artists involved with the &quot;She Will Have Her Way&quot; and &quot;He Will Have His Way&quot; projects, including Paul Dempsey, Clare Bowditch, Seeker Lover Keeper (Sarah Blasko, Sally Seltmann and Holly Throsby), Alexander Gow (Oh Mercy) and Lior. The band played what would be their last concert for over five years at the A Day on the Green festival in Auckland on 27 February 2011.

Former Crowded House drummer Peter Jones died from brain cancer on 18 May 2012, aged 49. A statement issued by the band described him as, &quot;A warm-hearted, funny and talented man, who was a valuable member of Crowded House.&quot;

In September 2015, the song &quot;Help is Coming&quot; from the &quot;Afterglow&quot; album, was released as a download and limited edition 7&quot; single to raise money for the charity Save the Children. The B-side, &quot;Anthem&quot;, was a previously unreleased track, recorded at the same demo session as &quot;Help is Coming&quot; in 1995, with vocals added in 2015. Peter Jones plays drums on both songs. The money will be used to provide shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene for refugees in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq. Neil Finn said of &quot;Help Is Coming&quot;...&quot;It was always a song about refugees, even if at the time I was thinking about the immigrants setting off on ships from Europe to America, looking for a better life for their families. There is such a huge scale and urgency to the current refugee crises that barely a day goes by without some crushing image or news account to confront us. We can&#x27;t be silent any more.&quot;

Neil Finn confirmed in a 2016 interview with the Dutch newspaper &quot;Volkskrant&quot; that Crowded House had been on indefinite hiatus since the end of the &quot;Intriguer&quot; tour. Later that year, however, he and Seymour announced a series of concerts at the Sydney Opera House to mark the 20th anniversary of the &quot;Farewell to the World&quot; show (24 November 1996). The band, with the same lineup as its initial reunion and Tim Finn as guest, performed four shows between 24 and 27 November 2016. Around the same time, each of the band&#x27;s 7 studio albums (including the rarities collection &quot;Afterglow&quot;) was reissued in deluxe 2-CD format with bonus tracks including demos, live recordings, alternate mixes, b-sides and outtakes.

In April 2018, Neil Finn joined Fleetwood Mac, along with Mike Campbell of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, as a full-time member in the wake of Lindsey Buckingham&#x27;s departure from the band.

===Reformation, new line-up and &quot;Dreamers Are Waiting&quot; (2019–2023)===
In August 2019, Crowded House announced a reunion show at the 2020 Byron Bay Bluesfest. Shortly afterwards, Mark Hart announced that he would not be involved in the group&#x27;s reunion. Finn confirmed Hart&#x27;s departure on his podcast Fangradio, noting that he &quot;love[s] Hart dearly as a friend, as a contributor and a collaborator&quot; and that &quot;all will be revealed... trust that good thought and good heart gets put into all of these decisions.&quot; In December 2019, Neil Finn announced that the new Crowded House line-up would consist of himself, Seymour, the band&#x27;s original producer Mitchell Froom and his sons Liam and Elroy. He added that they were making a new studio album, the first since 2010&#x27;s &quot;Intriguer&quot;. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the band&#x27;s planned 2020 concerts have had to be rescheduled to 2021, and later again to 2022.

On 15 October 2020, the band released &quot;Whatever You Want&quot;, the first single from the band in over a decade. The band also shared an accompanying music video, starring Mac DeMarco.

On 17 February 2021, the band shared another single, &quot;To the Island.&quot; The track serves as the second single to the band&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Dreamers Are Waiting&quot;, which was announced on the same day for release on 4 June 2021. The band supported the single with a national tour of New Zealand in March 2021.

On 19 August 2021, the band performed their single &quot;To the Island&quot; on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;. On 2 December 2021, the band announced that it will be touring Australia in 2022, with 6 shows around the country, including the 2022 Bluesfest lineup. On 24 June 2022, the band played at Glastonbury Festival. In May 2023, Crowded House tour North America for the promotion of the album &quot;Dreamers Are Waiting&quot;.

===&quot;Gravity Stairs&quot; (2024–present)===
In February 2024, Crowded House released &quot;Oh Hi&quot; from their eighth album &quot;Gravity Stairs&quot;, which in turn was released on 31 May 2024. They also announced a New Zealand and Australian tour beginning in November that year.

==Style==
===Songwriting and musical influences===
As the primary songwriter for the band, Neil Finn has always set the tone for the band&#x27;s sound. AllMusic said that Finn &quot;has consistently proven his knack for crafting high-quality songs that combine irresistible melodies with meticulous lyrical detail.&quot; Neil&#x27;s brother Tim was an early and important musical influence. Neil first saw Tim play with Split Enz in 1972, and said &quot;that performance and those first songs made a lasting impression on me.&quot; His mother was another significant musical influence, encouraging him to listen to a variety of genres, including Irish folk music and Māori music. She would play piano at family parties and encourage Neil and Tim to accompany her.

===Album covers, costumes and set design===
Bassist Nick Seymour, who is also an artist, designed or co-designed all of the band&#x27;s album covers and interior artwork. He also designed some of the costumes worn by the group, notably those from the cover of the group&#x27;s debut album &quot;Crowded House&quot;. Seymour collaborated with Finn and Hester on the set design of some of their early music videos, including &quot;Don&#x27;t Dream It&#x27;s Over&quot; and &quot;Better Be Home Soon&quot;. Since the band reunited, Seymour has again designed their album covers.

The majority of the covers for the band&#x27;s singles were not designed by Seymour. The artwork for &quot;Pineapple Head&quot; was created by Reg Mombassa of Mental As Anything. For the first four albums Mombassa and Noel Crombie, who had been the main designer of Split Enz&#x27;s artwork, assisted Seymour in creating sets and costumes. For the &quot;Farewell to the World&quot; concerts Crombie designed the set, while Mombassa and Seymour designed promotional materials and artwork.

Crowded House has won several national and international awards. In Australia, the group has won 13 ARIA Awards from 36 nominations, including the inaugural Best New Talent in 1987. The majority of their wins were for their first two albums, &quot;Crowded House&quot; and &quot;Temple of Low Men&quot;.

<text>Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette (; 28 January 1873 – 3 August 1954), known mononymously as Colette, was a French author and woman of letters. She was also a mime, actress, and journalist. Colette is best known in the English-speaking world for her 1944 novella &quot;Gigi&quot;, which was the basis for the 1958 film and the 1973 stage production of the same name. Her short story collection &quot;The Tendrils of the Vine&quot; is also famous in France.

==Early life==

Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette was born on 28 January 1873 in the village of Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye in the department of Yonne, Burgundy. 
Her father, Captain Jules-Joseph Colette (1829–1905) was a war hero. He was a Zouave of the Saint-Cyr military school, who had lost a leg at Melegnano in the Second Italian War of Independence. He was awarded a post as tax collector in the village of Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye where his children were born. His wife, Adèle Eugénie Sidonie, &quot;née&quot; Landoy (1835–1912) was nicknamed &quot;Sido&quot;. Colette&#x27;s great-grandfather, Robert Landois, was a wealthy Martinican mulatto, who settled in Charleville in 1787. In an arranged first marriage to Jules Robineau Duclos, Colette&#x27;s mother had two children: Juliette (1860–1908) and Achille (1863–1913). After she remarried Captain Colette, she had two other children: Leopold (1866–1940) and Sidonie-Gabrielle. Colette attended a public school from the ages of 6 to 17. The family was initially well off, but poor financial management substantially reduced their income.

==Career==

In 1893, Colette married Henry Gauthier-Villars (1859–1931), an author and publisher 14 years her senior, who used the pen name &quot;Willy&quot;. Her first four novels – the four Claudine stories: &quot;Claudine à l&#x27;école&quot; (1900), &quot;Claudine à Paris&quot; (1901), &quot;Claudine en ménage&quot; (1902), and &quot;Claudine s&#x27;en va&quot; (1903) – appeared under his name. (The four are published in English as &quot;Claudine at School&quot;, &quot;Claudine in Paris&quot;, &quot;Claudine Married&quot;, and &quot;Claudine and Annie&quot;.)

The novels chart the coming of age and young adulthood of their titular heroine, Claudine, from an unconventional 15-year old in a Burgundian village to a doyenne of the literary salons of turn-of-the-century Paris. The story they tell is semi-autobiographical, although Claudine, unlike Colette, is motherless.

The marriage to Gauthier-Villars allowed Colette to devote her time to writing. She later said she would never have become a writer if it had not been for Willy. Fourteen years older than his wife and one of the most notorious libertines in Paris, he introduced his wife into avant-garde intellectual and artistic circles and encouraged her lesbian dalliances. And it was he who chose the titillating subject matter of the Claudine novels: &quot;the secondary myth of Sappho... the girls&#x27; school or convent ruled by a seductive female teacher.&quot; Willy &quot;locked her [Colette] in her room until she produced enough pages to suit him.&quot;
==Post divorce==
Colette and Willy separated in 1906, although their divorce was not final until 1910. Colette had no access to the sizable earnings of the Claudine books – the copyright belonged to Willy – and until 1912 she conducted a stage career in music halls across France, sometimes playing Claudine in sketches from her own novels, earning barely enough to survive and often hungry and ill. To make ends meet, she turned more seriously to journalism in the 1910s. Around this time she also became an avid amateur photographer. This period of her life is recalled in &quot;La Vagabonde&quot; (1910), which deals with women&#x27;s independence in a male society, a theme to which she would regularly return in future works.

During these years she embarked on a series of relationships with other women, notably with Natalie Clifford Barney and with Mathilde de Morny, the Marquise de Belbeuf (&quot;Max&quot;), with whom she sometimes shared the stage. On 3 January 1907, an onstage kiss between Max and Colette in a pantomime entitled &quot;Rêve d&#x27;Égypte&quot; caused a near-riot, and as a result, they were no longer able to live together openly, although their relationship continued for another five years.

In 1912, Colette married Henry de Jouvenel, the editor of &quot;Le Matin&quot;. A daughter, Colette de Jouvenel, nicknamed &quot;Bel-Gazou&quot;, was born to them in 1913.

==1920s and 1930s==
In 1920, Colette published &quot;Chéri&quot;, portraying love between an older woman and a much younger man. Chéri is the lover of Léa, a wealthy courtesan; Léa is devastated when Chéri marries a girl his own age and delighted when he returns to her, but after one final night together, she sends him away again.

Colette&#x27;s marriage to Jouvenel ended in divorce in 1924, due partly to his infidelities and partly to her affair with her 16-year-old stepson, Bertrand de Jouvenel. In 1925, she met Maurice Goudeket, who became her final husband; the couple stayed together until her death.

Colette was by then an established writer (&quot;The Vagabond&quot; had received three votes for the prestigious &quot;Prix Goncourt&quot;). The decades of the 1920s and 1930s were her most productive and innovative period. Set mostly in Burgundy or Paris during the Belle Époque, her work focused on married life and sexuality. It was frequently quasi-autobiographical: &quot;Chéri&quot; (1920) and &quot;Le Blé en Herbe&quot; (1923) both deal with love between an aging woman and a very young man, a situation reflecting her relationship with Bertrand de Jouvenel and with her third husband, Goudeket, who was 16 years her junior. &quot;La Naissance du Jour&quot; (1928) is her explicit criticism of the conventional lives of women, expressed through a meditation on age and the renunciation of love by the character of her mother, Sido.

By this time Colette was frequently acclaimed as France&#x27;s greatest woman writer. &quot;It... has no plot, and yet tells of three lives all that should be known&quot;, wrote Janet Flanner of &quot;&quot; (1929). &quot;Once again, and at greater length than usual, she has been hailed for her genius, humanities and perfect prose by those literary journals which years ago... lifted nothing at all in her direction except the finger of scorn.&quot;

During the 1920s she was associated with the Jewish-Algerian writer Elissa Rhaïs, who adopted a Muslim persona to market her novels.

==Last years, 1940–1954==
Colette was 67 years old when France was occupied by the Germans. She remained in Paris, in her apartment in the Palais-Royal. Her husband Maurice Goudeket, who was Jewish, was arrested by the Gestapo in December 1941, and although he was released after seven weeks through the intervention of the French wife of the German ambassador, Colette lived through the rest of the war years with the anxiety of a possible second arrest. During the Occupation she produced two volumes of memoirs, &quot;Journal à Rebours&quot; (1941) and &quot;De ma Fenêtre&quot; (1942); the two were issued in English in 1975 as &quot;Looking Backwards&quot;. She wrote lifestyle articles for several pro-Nazi newspapers. These, and her novel &quot;Julie de Carneilhan&quot; (1941), contain many anti-Semitic slurs.

In 1944, Colette published what became her most famous work, &quot;Gigi&quot;, which tells the story of the 16-year-old Gilberte (&quot;Gigi&quot;) Alvar. Born into a family of demimondaines, Gigi is trained as a courtesan to captivate a wealthy lover but defies the tradition by marrying him instead. In 1949 it was made into a French film starring Danièle Delorme and Gaby Morlay, then in 1951 adapted for the stage with the then-unknown Audrey Hepburn (picked by Colette personally) in the title role. The 1958 Hollywood musical movie, starring Leslie Caron and Louis Jourdan, with a screenplay by Alan Jay Lerner and a score by Lerner and Frederick Loewe, won the Academy Award for Best Picture.

In the postwar years, Colette became a famous public figure. She had become crippled by arthritis and was cared for by Goudeket, who supervised the preparation of her &quot;Œuvres Complètes&quot; (1948–1950). She continued to write during those years and published &quot;L&#x27;Etoile Vesper&quot; (1946) and &quot;Le Fanal Bleu&quot; (1949), in which she reflected on the problems of a writer whose inspiration is primarily autobiographical. She was nominated by Claude Farrère for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1948.

==Journalism==
Colette&#x27;s first pieces of journalism (1895–1900) were written in collaboration with her husband, Gauthier-Villars—music reviews for &quot;La Cocarde&quot;, a daily founded by Maurice Barres and a series of pieces for La Fronde. Following her divorce from Gauthier-Villars in 1910, she wrote independently for a wide variety of publications, gaining considerable renown for her articles covering social trends, theater, fashion, and film, as well as crime reporting. In December 1910, Colette agreed to write a regular column in the Paris daily, Le Matin—at first under a pseudonym, then as &quot;Colette Willy.&quot; One of her editors was Henry de Jouvenel, whom she married in 1912. By 1912, Colette had taught herself to be a reporter: &quot;You have to see and not invent, you have to touch, not imagine .. because, when you see the sheets [at a crime scene] drenched in fresh blood, they are a color you could never invent.&quot; In 1914, Colette was named Le Matin&#x27;s literary editor. Colette&#x27;s separation from Jouvenel in 1923 forced her to sever ties with Le Matin. Over the next three decades her articles appeared in over two dozen publications, including Vogue, Le Figaro, and Paris-Soir. During the German Occupation of France, Colette continued contributing to daily and weekly publications, a number of them collaborationist and pro-Nazi, including Le Petit Parisien, which became pro-Vichy after January 1941, and La Gerbe, a pro-Nazi weekly. Though her articles were not political in nature, Colette was sharply criticized at the time for lending her prestige to these publications and implicitly accommodating herself to the Vichy regime. Her 26 November 1942 article, &quot;Ma Bourgogne Pauvre&quot; (&quot;My Poor Burgundy&quot;), has been singled out by some historians as tacitly accepting some ultra-nationalist goals that hardline Vichyist writers espoused. After 1945, her journalism was sporadic, and her final pieces were more personal essays than reported stories. Over the course of her writing career, Colette published over 1200 articles for newspapers, magazines, and journals.

==Death and legacy==
Upon her death, on 3 August 1954, she was refused a religious funeral by the Catholic Church on account of her divorces, but given a state funeral, the first French woman of letters to be granted the honour, and interred in Père-Lachaise cemetery.
Colette was elected to the Belgian Royal Academy (1935), the Académie Goncourt (1945, and President in 1949), and a Chevalier (1920) and Grand Officer (1953) of the Légion d&#x27;honneur.

Colette&#x27;s numerous biographers have proposed widely differing interpretations of her life and work over the decades. Initially considered a limited if talented novelist (despite the outspoken admiration in her lifetime of figures such as André Gide and Henry de Montherlant), she has been increasingly recognised as an important voice in women&#x27;s writing. Before Colette&#x27;s death, Katherine Anne Porter wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Colette &quot;is the greatest living French writer of fiction; and that she was while Gide and Proust still lived.&quot;

Singer-songwriter Rosanne Cash paid tribute to the writer in the song, &quot;The Summer I Read Colette&quot;, on her 1996 album &quot;10 Song Demo&quot;.

Truman Capote wrote an essay in 1970 about meeting her, called &quot;The White Rose&quot;. It tells how, when she saw him admiring a paperweight on a table (the &quot;white rose&quot; of the title), she insisted he take it; Capote initially refused the gift, but “…when I protested that I couldn’t accept as a present something she so clearly adored, [she replied] &#x27;My dear, really there is no point in giving a gift unless one also treasures it oneself.&#x27;”

&quot;Womanhouse&quot; (30 January – 28 February 1972) was a feminist art installation and performance space organized by Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro, co-founders of the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) Feminist Art Program, and was the first public exhibition of art centered upon female empowerment. One of the rooms in it, Leah&#x27;s Room by Karen LeCocq and Nancy Youdelman, was based on Colette’s &quot;Chéri&quot;. Karen and Nancy borrowed an antique dressing table and rug, made lace curtains and covered the bed with satin and lace to create the effect of a boudoir. They filled the closet with old-looking clothes and veiled hats, and wallpapered the walls to add a feeling of nostalgia. LeCocq sat at the dressing table dressed in a nineteenth-century-style costume as Léa, studiously applying make-up over and over and then removing it, replicating the character’s attempts to save her fading beauty.

&quot;Lucette Stranded on the Island&quot; by Julia Holter, from her 2015 album &quot;Have You in My Wilderness&quot;, is based on a minor character from Colette&#x27;s short story &quot;Chance Acquaintances&quot;.

In the 1991 film &quot;Becoming Colette&quot;, Colette is played by the French actress Mathilda May. In the 2018 film &quot;Colette&quot;, the title character is played by Keira Knightley. Both films focus on Colette&#x27;s life in her twenties, her marriage to her first husband, and the publication of her first novels under his name.

<text>Charles Henry Alston (November 28, 1907 – April 27, 1977) was an American painter, sculptor, illustrator, muralist and teacher who lived and worked in the New York City neighborhood of Harlem. Alston was active in the Harlem Renaissance; Alston was the first African-American supervisor for the Works Progress Administration&#x27;s Federal Art Project. Alston designed and painted murals at the Harlem Hospital and the Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Building. In 1990, Alston&#x27;s bust of Martin Luther King Jr. became the first image of an African American displayed at the White House.

==Personal life==
===Early life===
Charles Henry Alston was born on November 28, 1907, in Charlotte, North Carolina, to Reverend Primus Priss Alston and Anna Elizabeth (Miller) Alston, as the youngest of five children. Three survived past infancy: Charles, his older sister Rousmaniere and his older brother Wendell. His father had been born into slavery in 1851 in Pittsboro, North Carolina. After the Civil War, he gained an education and graduated from St. Augustine&#x27;s College in Raleigh. He became a prominent minister and founder of St. Michael&#x27;s Episcopal Church, with an African-American congregation. The senior Alston was described as a &quot;race man&quot;: an African American who dedicated his skills to the furtherance of the Black race. Reverend Alston met his wife when she was a student at his school. Charles was nicknamed &quot;Spinky&quot; by his father, and kept the nickname as an adult. In 1910, when Charles was three, his father died suddenly of a cerebral hemorrhage. Locals described his father as the &quot;Booker T. Washington of Charlotte&quot;.

In 1913, Anna Alston married Harry Bearden, Romare Bearden&#x27;s uncle, making Charles and Romare cousins. The two Bearden families lived across the street from each other; the friendship between Romare and Charles would last a lifetime.

As a child, Alston was inspired by his older brother Wendell&#x27;s drawings of trains and cars, which the young artist copied. Alston also played with clay, creating a sculpture of North Carolina. As an adult he reflected on his memories of sculpting with clay as a child: &quot;I&#x27;d get buckets of it and put it through strainers and make things out of it. I think that&#x27;s the first art experience I remember, making things.&quot; His mother was a skilled embroiderer and took up painting at the age of 75. His father was also good at drawing, having wooed Alston&#x27;s mother Anna with small sketches in the medians of letters he wrote her.

In 1915, the Bearden/Alston family moved to New York, as many African-American families did during the Great Migration. Alston&#x27;s step-father, Henry Bearden, left before his wife and children in order to get work. He secured a job overseeing elevator operations and the newsstand staff at the Bretton Hotel in the Upper West Side. The family lived in Harlem and was considered middle-class. During the Great Depression, the people of Harlem suffered economically. The &quot;stoic strength&quot; seen within the community was later expressed in Charles’ fine art. At Public School 179 in Manhattan, the boy&#x27;s artistic abilities were recognized and he was asked to draw all of the school posters during his years there.

In 1917, Harry and Anna Bearden had a daughter together, Aida C. Bearden, who would later marry operatic baritone Lawrence Whisonant.

===Higher education===
Alston graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School, where he was nominated for academic excellence and was the art editor of the school&#x27;s magazine, &quot;The Magpie&quot;. He was a member of the Arista - National Honor Society and also studied drawing and anatomy at the Saturday school of the National Academy of Art. In high school he was given his first oil paints and learned about his aunt Bessye Bearden&#x27;s art salons, which stars like Duke Ellington and Langston Hughes attended. After graduating in 1925, he attended Columbia University, turning down a scholarship to the Yale School of Fine Arts.
Alston entered the pre-architectural program but lost interest after realizing what difficulties many African-American architects had in the field. After also taking classes in pre-med, he decided that math, physics and chemistry &quot;was not just my bag&quot;, and he entered the fine arts program. During his time at Columbia, Alston joined Alpha Phi Alpha, worked on the university&#x27;s &quot;Columbia Daily Spectator&quot;, and drew cartoons for the school&#x27;s magazine &quot;Jester&quot;. He also explored Harlem restaurants and clubs, where his love for jazz and black music would be fostered. In 1929, he graduated and received the Arthur Wesley Dow fellowship to study at Teachers College, where he obtained his Master&#x27;s in 1931.

===Later life===
For the years 1942 and 1943 Alston was stationed in the army at Fort Huachuca in Arizona. While working on a mural project at Harlem Hospital, he met Myra Adele Logan, then an surgical intern at the hospital. They were married on April 8, 1944. Their home, which included his studio, was on Edgecombe Avenue near Highbridge Park. The couple lived close to family; at their frequent gatherings Alston enjoyed cooking and Myra played piano. During the 1940s Alston also took occasional art classes, studying under Alexander Kostellow.

On April 27, 1977, Alston died after a long bout with cancer, just months after his wife died from lung cancer. His memorial service was held at St. Martins Episcopal Church in New York City, on May 21, 1977.

==Professional career==

While obtaining his master&#x27;s degree, Alston was the boys’ work director at the Utopia Children&#x27;s House, started by James Lesesne Wells. He also began teaching at the Harlem Community Art Center, founded by Augusta Savage in the basement of what is now the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. Alston&#x27;s teaching style was influenced by the work of John Dewey, Arthur Wesley Dow, and Thomas Munro. During this period, Alston began to teach the 10-year-old Jacob Lawrence, whom he strongly influenced. Alston was introduced to African art by the poet Alain Locke. In the late 1920s, Alston joined Bearden and other black artists who refused to exhibit in William E. Harmon Foundation shows, which featured all-black artists in their traveling exhibits. Alston and his friends thought the exhibits were curated for a white audience, a form of segregation which the men protested. They did not want to be set aside but exhibited on the same level as art peers of every skin color.

In 1938, the Rosenwald Fund provided money for Alston to travel to the South, which was his first return there since leaving as a child. His travel with Giles Hubert, an inspector for the Farm Security Administration, gave him access to certain situations and he photographed many aspects of rural life. These photographs served as the basis for a series of genre portraits depicting southern black life. In 1940, he completed &quot;Tobacco Farmer&quot;, the portrait of a young black farmer in white overalls and a blue shirt with a youthful yet serious look upon his face, sitting in front of the landscape and buildings he works on and in. That same year Alston received a second round of funding from the Rosenwald Fund to travel South, and he spent extended time at Atlanta University.

During the 1930s and early 1940s, Alston created illustrations for magazines such as &quot;Fortune&quot;, &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and others. He also designed album covers for artists such as Duke Ellington and Coleman Hawkins, as well as book covers for Eudora Welty and Langston Hughes. Alston became staff artist at the Office of War Information and Public Relations in 1940, creating drawings of notable African Americans. These images were used in over 200 black newspapers across the country by the government to &quot;foster goodwill with the black citizenry.&quot;

Alston left commercial work to focus on his own artwork, and 1950 he became the first African-American instructor at the Art Students League, where he remained on faculty until 1971. In 1950, his &quot;Painting&quot; was exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and his artwork was one of the few pieces purchased by the museum. He landed his first solo exhibition in 1953 at the John Heller Gallery, which represented artists such as Roy Lichtenstein. He exhibited there five times from 1953 to 1958.

In 1956, Alston became the first African-American instructor at the Museum of Modern Art, where he taught for a year before going to Belgium on behalf of MoMA and the United States Department of State. He coordinated the children&#x27;s community center at Expo 58. In 1958, he was awarded a grant from and was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

In 1963, Alston co-founded Spiral with his cousin Romare Bearden and Hale Woodruff. Spiral served as a collective of conversation and artistic exploration for a large group of artists who &quot;addressed how black artists should relate to American society in a time of segregation.&quot; Artists and arts supporters gathered for Spiral, such as Emma Amos, Perry Ferguson and Merton Simpson. 
 This group served as the 1960s version of the 306 Group. Alston was described as an &quot;intellectual activist&quot;, and in 1968 he spoke at Columbia about his activism. In the mid-1960s, Spiral organized an exhibition of black and white artworks, but the exhibition was never officially sponsored by the group, due to internal disagreements.

In 1968, Alston received a presidential appointment from Lyndon Johnson to the National Council of Culture and the Arts. Mayor John Lindsay appointed him to the New York City Art Commission in 1969.

In 1973, he was made full professor at City College of New York, where he had taught since 1968. In 1975, he was awarded the first Distinguished Alumni Award from Teachers College. The Art Student&#x27;s League created a 21-year merit scholarship in 1977 under Alston&#x27;s name to commemorate each year of his tenure.

===Painting a person and a culture===
Alston shared studio space with Henry Bannarn at 306 W. 141st Street, which served as an open space for artists, photographers, musicians, writers and the like. Other artists held studio space at 306, such as Jacob Lawrence, Addison Bates and his brother Leon. During this time Alston founded the Harlem Artists Guild with Savage and Elba Lightfoot to work toward equality in Works Progress Administration art programs in New York. During the early years of 306, Alston focused on mastering portraiture. His early works such as &quot;Portrait of a Man&quot; (1929) show Alston&#x27;s detailed and realistic style depicted through pastels and charcoals, inspired by the style of Winold Reiss. In his &quot;Girl in a Red Dress&quot; (1934) and &quot;The Blue Shirt&quot; (1935), Alston used modern and innovative techniques for his portraits of young individuals in Harlem. &quot;Blue Shirt&quot; is thought to be a portrait of Jacob Lawrence. During this time he also created &quot;Man Seated with Travel Bag&quot; (c. 1938–40), showing the seedy and bleak environment, contrasting with work like the racially charged &quot;Vaudeville&quot; (c. 1930) and its caricature style of a man in blackface.

Inspired by his trip south, Alston began his &quot;family series&quot; in the 1940s. Intensity and angularity come through in the faces of the youth in his portraits &quot;Untitled (Portrait of a Girl)&quot; and &quot;Untitled (Portrait of a Boy)&quot;. These works also show the influence that African sculpture had on his portraiture, with &quot;Portrait of a Boy&quot; showing more cubist features. Later family portraits show Alston&#x27;s exploration of religious symbolism, color, form and space. His family group portraits are often faceless, which Alston states is the way that white America views blacks. Paintings such as &quot;Family&quot; (1955) show a woman seated and a man standing with two children – the parents seem almost solemn while the children are described as hopeful and with a use of color made famous by Cézanne. In &quot;Family Group&quot; (c. 1950) Alston&#x27;s use of gray and ochre tones brings together the parents and son as if one with geometric patterns connecting them together as if a puzzle. The simplicity of the look, style and emotion upon the family is reflective and probably inspired by Alston&#x27;s trip south. His work during this time has been described as being &quot;characterized by his reductive use of form combined with a sun-hued&quot; palette. During this time he also started to experiment with ink and wash painting, which is seen in work such as &quot;Portrait of a Woman&quot; (1955), as well as creating portraits to illustrate the music surrounding him in Harlem. &quot;Blues Singer #4&quot; shows a female singer on stage with a white flower on her shoulder and a bold red dress. &quot;Girl in a Red Dress&quot; is thought to be Bessie Smith, whom he drew many times when she was recording and performing. Jazz was an important influence in Alston&#x27;s work and social life, which he expressed in such works as &quot;Jazz&quot; (1950) and &quot;Harlem at Night&quot;.

The 1960s civil rights movement influenced his work deeply, and he made artworks expressing feelings related to inequality and race relations in the United States. One of his few religious artworks was &quot;Christ Head&quot; (1960), which had an angular &quot;Modiglianiesque&quot; portrait of Jesus Christ. Seven years later he created &quot;You never really meant it, did you, Mr. Charlie?&quot; which, in a similar style as &quot;Christ Head&quot;, shows a black man standing against a red sky &quot;looking as frustrated as any individual can look&quot;, according to Alston.

====Modernism====
Experimenting with the use of negative space and organic forms in the late 1940s, by the mid-1950s Alston began creating notably modernist style paintings. &quot;Woman with Flowers&quot; (1949) has been described as a tribute to Modigliani. &quot;Ceremonial&quot; (1950) shows that he was influenced by African art. Untitled works during this era show his use of color overlay, using muted colors to create simple layered abstracts of still lifes. &quot;Symbol&quot; (1953) relates to Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Guernica&quot;, which was a favorite work of Alston&#x27;s.

His final work of the 1950s, &quot;Walking&quot;, was inspired by the Montgomery bus boycott. It is taken to represent &quot;the surge of energy among African Americans to organize in their struggle for full equality.&quot; Alston is quoted as saying, &quot;The idea of a march was growing...It was in the air...and this painting just came. I called it &quot;Walking&quot; on purpose. It wasn&#x27;t the militancy that you saw later. It was a very definite walk-not going back, no hesitation.&quot;

====Black and white====
The civil rights movement of the 1960s was a major influence on Alston. In the late 1950s, he began working in black and white, which he continued up until the mid-1960s, and the period is considered one of his most powerful. Some of the works are simple abstracts of black ink on white paper, similar to a Rorschach test. &quot;Untitled&quot; (c. 1960s) shows a boxing match, with an attempt to express the drama of the fight through few brushstrokes. Alston worked with oil-on-Masonite during this period as well, using impasto, cream, and ochre to create a moody cave-like artwork. &quot;Black and White #1&quot; (1959) is one of Alston&#x27;s more &quot;monumental&quot; works. Gray, white and black come together to fight for space on an abstract canvas, in a softer form than the more harsh Franz Kline. Alston continued to explore the relationship between monochromatic hues throughout the series which Wardlaw describes as &quot;some of the most profoundly beautiful works of twentieth-century American art.&quot;

===Murals===
Charles Alston&#x27;s early mural work was inspired by the work of Aaron Douglas, Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco. He met Orozco when they did mural work in New York. In 1943, Alston was elected to the board of directors of the National Society of Mural Painters. He created murals for the Harlem Hospital, Golden State Mutual, American Museum of Natural History, Public School 154, the Bronx Family and Criminal Court, and the Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn, New York.

====Harlem Hospital Murals====

Originally hired as an easel painter, in 1935 Alston became the first African-American supervisor to work for the Works Progress Administration&#x27;s Federal Art Project (FAP) in New York. This was his first mural. At this time he was awarded Works Progress Administration Project Number 1262 – an opportunity to oversee a group of artists creating murals and to supervise their painting for the Harlem Hospital. It was the first government commission ever awarded to African-American artists, who included Beauford Delaney, Seabrook Powell and Vertis Hayes. He also had the chance to create and paint his own contribution to the collection: &quot;Magic in Medicine&quot; and &quot;Modern Medicine&quot;. These paintings were part of a diptych completed in 1936 depicting the history of medicine in the African-American community and Beauford Delaney served as assistant. When creating the murals, Alston was inspired by the work of Aaron Douglas, who a year earlier had created the public art piece &quot;Aspects of Negro Life&quot; for the New York Public Library. He had researched traditional African culture, including traditional African medicine. &quot;Magic in Medicine&quot;, which depicts African culture and holistic healing, is considered one of &quot;America&#x27;s first public scenes of Africa&quot;. All of the mural sketches submitted were accepted by the FAP; however, hospital superintendent Lawrence T. Dermody and commissioner of hospitals S.S. Goldwater rejected four proposals, due to what they said was an excessive amount of African-American representation in the works. The artists fought their response, writing letters to gain support. Four years later they succeeded in gaining the right to complete the murals. The sketches for &quot;Magic in Medicine&quot; and &quot;Modern Medicine&quot; were exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s &quot;New Horizons in American Art&quot;.

=====Condition=====
Alston&#x27;s murals were hung in the Women&#x27;s Pavilion of the hospital over uncapped radiators, which caused the paintings to deteriorate from the steam. Plans failed to recap the radiators. In 1959, Alston estimated, in a letter to the New York State Department of Public Works, that the conservation would cost $1,500 but the funds were never acquired. In 1968, after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Alston was asked to create another mural for the hospital, to be placed in a pavilion named after the slain civil rights movement leader. It was to be titled &quot;Man Emerging from the Darkness of Poverty and Ignorance into the Light of a Better World.&quot;

One year after Alston&#x27;s death in 1977, a group of artists and historians, including the renowned painter and collagist Romare Bearden and art historian Greta Berman, together with administrators from the hospital, and from the New York City Art Commission, examined the murals, and presented a proposal for their restoration to then-mayor Ed Koch. The request was approved, and conservator Alan Farancz set to work in 1979, rescuing the murals from further decay. Many years passed, and the murals began to deteriorate again – especially the Alston works, which continued to suffer effects from the radiators. In 1991, the Municipal Art Society&#x27;s Adopt-a-Mural program was launched, and the Harlem Hospital murals were chosen for further restoration (Greta Berman. Personal experience). A grant from Alston&#x27;s sister Rousmaniere Wilson and step-sister Aida Bearden Winters assisted in completing a restoration of the works in 1993. In 2005, Harlem Hospital announced a $2 million project to conserve Alston&#x27;s murals and three other pieces in the original commissioned project as part of a $225 million hospital expansion.

====Golden State Mutual murals====
In the late 1940s, Alston became involved in a mural project commissioned by Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company, which asked the artists to create work related to African-American contributions to the settling of California. Alston worked with Hale Woodruff on the murals in a large studio space in New York; they used ladders to reach the upper parts of the canvas. The artworks, which are considered &quot;priceless contributions to American narrative art&quot;, consist of two panels: &quot;Exploration and Colonization&quot; by Alston and &quot;Settlement and Development&quot; by Woodruff. Alston&#x27;s piece covers the period of 1527 to 1850. Images of mountain man James Beckwourth, Biddy Mason, and William Leidesdorff are portrayed in the well-detailed historical mural. Both artists kept in contact with African Americans on the West Coast during creation of the murals, which influenced their content and depictions. The murals were unveiled in 1949, and have been on display in the lobby of the Golden State Mutual Headquarters.

Due to economic downturn in the early 21st century, Golden State was forced to sell their entire art collection to ward off its mounting debts. As of spring 2011 the National Museum of African American History and Culture had offered $750,000 to purchase the artworks. This generated controversy, as the artworks have been estimated to be worth at least $5 million. Supporters tried to protect the murals by gaining city landmark protections by the Los Angeles Conservancy. The state of California had declined philanthropic proposals to keep the murals in their original location, and the Smithsonian Institution withdrew their offer. The disposition of the murals are subject to a court case over jurisdiction, which was unresolved in the spring of 2011. This was resolved later in 2011 when the Golden State Mutual Life Insurance building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The building was purchased by Community Impact Development, a partnership formed to provide a new home for the South Central Los Angeles Regional Center, an agency that provides services to people with developmental disabilities. The building was renovated in 2015. The murals remain in the lobby.

===Sculpture===

Alston also created sculptures. &quot;Head of a Woman&quot; (1957) shows his shift toward a &quot;reductive and modern approach to sculpture...where facial features were suggested rather than fully formulated in three dimensions,&quot;. In 1970, Alston was commissioned by the Community Church of New York to create a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. for $5,000, with only five copies produced. In 1990, Alston&#x27;s bronze bust of Martin Luther King Jr. (1970), became the first image of an African American to be displayed in the White House. When Barack Obama became the first black president in 2009, he brought the bust of Martin Luther King Jr. into the Oval Office, replacing a bust of Winston Churchill. This marked the first time an image of an African American was displayed in the president&#x27;s work quarters. Furthermore, the bust became a predominant work seen in official portraits of visiting dignitaries. Now, a second copy of the famous Martin Luther King Jr. bust is displayed in Washington for the public to view up close.

===World War II propaganda===

During World War II, scholars have theorized that the black press strived to appeal to the black readers, while also appeasing the U.S. government by supporting the war. Alston produced over one hundred government propagandistic illustrations that supported the national position on the war for the U.S. Office of War Information. Simultaneously, the cartoons were targeted to a black audience, designed exclusively for publication in the weekly black newspapers to address specific, controversial issues in the black community.

===Reception===
Art critic Emily Genauer stated that Alston &quot;refused to be pigeonholed&quot;, regarding his varied exploration in his artwork. Patron Lemoine Deleaver Pierce said of Alston&#x27;s work: &quot;Never thought of as an innovative artist, Alston generally ignored popular art trends and violated many mainstream art conventions; he produced abstract and figurative paintings often simultaneously, refusing to be stylistically consistent, and during his 40-year career he worked prolifically and unapologetically in both commercial and fine art.&quot; Romare Bearden described Alston as &quot;...one of the most versatile artists whose enormous skill led him to a diversity of styles...&quot; Bearden also describes the professionalism and impact that Alston had on Harlem and the African-American community: &quot;&#x27;was a consummate artist and a voice in the development of African American art who never doubted the excellence of all people&#x27;s sensitivity and creative ability. During his long professional career, Alston significantly enriched the cultural life of Harlem. In a profound sense, he was a man who built bridges between Black artists in varying fields, and between other Americans.&quot; Writer June Jordan described Alston as &quot;an American artist of first magnitude, and he is a Black American artist of undisturbed integrity.&quot;

<doc id="6933" wikidata="Q180951" url="?curid=6933" title="Chromatin">
<text>Chromatin is a complex of DNA and protein found in eukaryotic cells. The primary function is to package long DNA molecules into more compact, denser structures. This prevents the strands from becoming tangled and also plays important roles in reinforcing the DNA during cell division, preventing DNA damage, and regulating gene expression and DNA replication. During mitosis and meiosis, chromatin facilitates proper segregation of the chromosomes in anaphase; the characteristic shapes of chromosomes visible during this stage are the result of DNA being coiled into highly condensed chromatin.

The primary protein components of chromatin are histones. An octamer of two sets of four histone cores (Histone H2A, Histone H2B, Histone H3, and Histone H4) bind to DNA and function as &quot;anchors&quot; around which the strands are wound. In general, there are three levels of chromatin organization:

# DNA wraps around histone proteins, forming nucleosomes and the so-called beads on a string structure (euchromatin).
# Multiple histones wrap into a 30-nanometer fiber consisting of nucleosome arrays in their most compact form (heterochromatin).
# Higher-level DNA supercoiling of the 30 nm fiber produces the metaphase chromosome (during mitosis and meiosis).

Many organisms, however, do not follow this organization scheme. For example, spermatozoa and avian red blood cells have more tightly packed chromatin than most eukaryotic cells, and trypanosomatid protozoa do not condense their chromatin into visible chromosomes at all. Prokaryotic cells have entirely different structures for organizing their DNA (the prokaryotic chromosome equivalent is called a genophore and is localized within the nucleoid region).

The overall structure of the chromatin network further depends on the stage of the cell cycle. During interphase, the chromatin is structurally loose to allow access to RNA and DNA polymerases that transcribe and replicate the DNA. The local structure of chromatin during interphase depends on the specific genes present in the DNA. Regions of DNA containing genes which are actively transcribed (&quot;turned on&quot;) are less tightly compacted and closely associated with RNA polymerases in a structure known as euchromatin, while regions containing inactive genes (&quot;turned off&quot;) are generally more condensed and associated with structural proteins in heterochromatin. Epigenetic modification of the structural proteins in chromatin via methylation and acetylation also alters local chromatin structure and therefore gene expression. There is limited understanding of chromatin structure and it is active area of research in molecular biology.

==Dynamic chromatin structure and hierarchy==
Chromatin undergoes various structural changes during a cell cycle. Histone proteins are the basic packers and arrangers of chromatin and can be modified by various post-translational modifications to alter chromatin packing (histone modification). Most modifications occur on histone tails. The positively charged histone cores only partially counteract the negative charge of the DNA phosphate backbone resulting in a negative net charge of the overall structure. An imbalance of charge within the polymer causes electrostatic repulsion between neighboring chromatin regions that promote interactions with positively charged proteins, molecules, and cations. As these modifications occur, the electrostatic environment surrounding the chromatin will flux and the level of chromatin compaction will alter. The consequences in terms of chromatin accessibility and compaction depend both on the modified amino acid and the type of modification. For example, histone acetylation results in loosening and increased accessibility of chromatin for replication and transcription. Lysine trimethylation can either lead to increased transcriptional activity (trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4) or transcriptional repression and chromatin compaction (trimethylation of histone H3, lysine 9 or lysine 27). Several studies suggested that different modifications could occur simultaneously. For example, it was proposed that a bivalent structure (with trimethylation of both lysine 4 and 27 on histone H3) is involved in early mammalian development. Another study tested the role of acetylation of histone 4 on lysine 16 on chromatin structure and found that homogeneous acetylation inhibited 30 nm chromatin formation and blocked adenosine triphosphate remodeling. This singular modification changed the dynamics of the chromatin which shows that acetylation of H4 at K16 is vital for proper intra- and inter- functionality of chromatin structure.
Polycomb-group proteins play a role in regulating genes through modulation of chromatin structure.

For additional information, see Chromatin variant, Histone modifications in chromatin regulation and RNA polymerase control by chromatin structure.

===Structure of DNA===
In nature, DNA can form three structures, A-, B-, and Z-DNA. A- and B-DNA are very similar, forming right-handed helices, whereas Z-DNA is a left-handed helix with a zig-zag phosphate backbone. Z-DNA is thought to play a specific role in chromatin structure and transcription because of the properties of the junction between B- and Z-DNA.

At the junction of B- and Z-DNA, one pair of bases is flipped out from normal bonding. These play a dual role of a site of recognition by many proteins and as a sink for torsional stress from RNA polymerase or nucleosome binding. DNA bases are stored as a code structure with four chemical bases such as &quot;“Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T)”&quot;. The order and sequences of these chemical structures of DNA are reflected as information available for the creation and control of human organisms. &quot;“A with T and C with G”&quot; pairing up to build the DNA base pair. &quot;Sugar and phosphate&quot; molecules are also paired with these bases, making DNA nucleotides arrange 2 long spiral strands unitedly called &quot;“double helix”&quot;. In eukaryotes, DNA consists of a cell nucleus and the DNA is providing strength and direction to the mechanism of heredity. Moreover, between the nitrogenous bonds of the 2 DNA, homogenous bonds are forming.

===Nucleosomes and beads-on-a-string===
The basic repeat element of chromatin is the nucleosome, interconnected by sections of linker DNA, a far shorter arrangement than pure DNA in solution.

In addition to core histones, a linker histone H1 exists that contacts the exit/entry of the DNA strand on the nucleosome. The nucleosome core particle, together with histone H1, is known as a chromatosome. Nucleosomes, with about 20 to 60 base pairs of linker DNA, can form, under non-physiological conditions, an approximately 11 nm beads on a string fibre.

The nucleosomes bind DNA non-specifically, as required by their function in general DNA packaging. There are, however, large DNA sequence preferences that govern nucleosome positioning. This is due primarily to the varying physical properties of different DNA sequences: For instance, adenine (A), and thymine (T) is more favorably compressed into the inner minor grooves. This means nucleosomes can bind preferentially at one position approximately every 10 base pairs (the helical repeat of DNA)- where the DNA is rotated to maximise the number of A and T bases that will lie in the inner minor groove. (See nucleic acid structure.)

===30-nm chromatin fiber in mitosis===

With addition of H1, during mitosis the beads-on-a-string structure can coil into a 30 nm-diameter helical structure known as the 30 nm fibre or filament. The precise structure of the chromatin fiber in the cell is not known in detail.

This level of chromatin structure is thought to be the form of heterochromatin, which contains mostly transcriptionally silent genes. Electron microscopy studies have demonstrated that the 30 nm fiber is highly dynamic such that it unfolds into a 10 nm fiber beads-on-a-string structure when transversed by an RNA polymerase engaged in transcription.
The existing models commonly accept that the nucleosomes lie perpendicular to the axis of the fibre, with linker histones arranged internally.
A stable 30 nm fibre relies on the regular positioning of nucleosomes along DNA. Linker DNA is relatively resistant to bending and rotation. This makes the length of linker DNA critical to the stability of the fibre, requiring nucleosomes to be separated by lengths that permit rotation and folding into the required orientation without excessive stress to the DNA.
In this view, different lengths of the linker DNA should produce different folding topologies of the chromatin fiber. Recent theoretical work, based on electron-microscopy images
of reconstituted fibers supports this view.

===DNA loops===

The beads-on-a-string chromatin structure has a tendency to form loops. These loops allow interactions between different regions of DNA by bringing them closer to each other, which increases the efficiency of gene interactions. This process is dynamic, with loops forming and disappearing. The loops are regulated by two main elements:
* Cohesins, protein complexes that generate loops by extrusion of the DNA fiber through the ring-like structure of the complex itself.
* CTCF, a transcription factor that limits the frontier of the DNA loop. To stop the growth of a loop, two CTCF molecules must be positioned in opposite directions to block the movement of the cohesin ring (&quot;see video&quot;).
There are many other elements involved. For example, Jpx regulates the binding sites of CTCF molecules along the DNA fiber.

===Spatial organization of chromatin in the cell nucleus===
The spatial arrangement of the chromatin within the nucleus is not random - specific regions of the chromatin can be found in certain territories. Territories are, for example, the lamina-associated domains (LADs), and the topologically associating domains (TADs), which are bound together by protein complexes. Currently, polymer models such as the Strings &amp; Binders Switch (SBS) model and the Dynamic Loop (DL) model are used to describe the folding of chromatin within the nucleus. The arrangement of chromatin within the nucleus may also play a role in nuclear stress and restoring nuclear membrane deformation by mechanical stress. When chromatin is condensed, the nucleus becomes more rigid. When chromatin is decondensed, the nucleus becomes more elastic with less force exerted on the inner nuclear membrane. This observation sheds light on other possible cellular functions of chromatin organization outside of genomic regulation.

===Cell-cycle dependent structural organization===

# Interphase: The structure of chromatin during interphase of mitosis is optimized to allow simple access of transcription and DNA repair factors to the DNA while compacting the DNA into the nucleus. The structure varies depending on the access required to the DNA. Genes that require regular access by RNA polymerase require the looser structure provided by euchromatin.
# Metaphase: The metaphase structure of chromatin differs vastly to that of interphase. It is optimised for physical strength and manageability, forming the classic chromosome structure seen in karyotypes. The structure of the condensed chromatin is thought to be loops of 30 nm fibre to a central scaffold of proteins. It is, however, not well-characterised. Chromosome scaffolds play an important role to hold the chromatin into compact chromosomes. Loops of 30 nm structure further condense with scaffold, into higher order structures. Chromosome scaffolds are made of proteins including condensin, type IIA topoisomerase and kinesin family member 4 (KIF4). The physical strength of chromatin is vital for this stage of division to prevent shear damage to the DNA as the daughter chromosomes are separated. To maximise strength the composition of the chromatin changes as it approaches the centromere, primarily through alternative histone H1 analogues. During mitosis, although most of the chromatin is tightly compacted, there are small regions that are not as tightly compacted. These regions often correspond to promoter regions of genes that were active in that cell type prior to chromatin formation. The lack of compaction of these regions is called bookmarking, which is an epigenetic mechanism believed to be important for transmitting to daughter cells the &quot;memory&quot; of which genes were active prior to entry into mitosis. This bookmarking mechanism is needed to help transmit this memory because transcription ceases during mitosis.

==Chromatin and bursts of transcription==

Chromatin and its interaction with enzymes has been researched, and a conclusion being made is that it is relevant and an important factor in gene expression. Vincent G. Allfrey, a professor at Rockefeller University, stated that RNA synthesis is related to histone acetylation. The lysine amino acid attached to the end of the histones is positively charged. The acetylation of these tails would make the chromatin ends neutral, allowing for DNA access.

When the chromatin decondenses, the DNA is open to entry of molecular machinery. Fluctuations between open and closed chromatin may contribute to the discontinuity of transcription, or transcriptional bursting. Other factors are probably involved, such as the association and dissociation of transcription factor complexes with chromatin. Specifically, RNA polymerase and transcriptional proteins have been shown to congregate into droplets via phase separation, and recent studies have suggested that 10 nm chromatin demonstrates liquid-like behavior increasing the targetability of genomic DNA. The interactions between linker histones and disordered tail regions act as an electrostatic glue organizing large-scale chromatin into a dynamic, liquid-like domain. Decreased chromatin compaction comes with increased chromatin mobility and easier transcriptional access to DNA. The phenomenon, as opposed to simple probabilistic models of transcription, can account for the high variability in gene expression occurring between cells in isogenic populations.

===Alternative chromatin organizations===

During metazoan spermiogenesis, the spermatid&#x27;s chromatin is remodeled into a more spaced-packaged, widened, almost crystal-like structure. This process is associated with the cessation of transcription and involves nuclear protein exchange. The histones are mostly displaced, and replaced by protamines (small, arginine-rich proteins). It is proposed that in yeast, regions devoid of histones become very fragile after transcription; HMO1, an HMG-box protein, helps in stabilizing nucleosomes-free chromatin.

==Chromatin and DNA repair==

A variety of internal and external agents can cause DNA damage in cells. Many factors influence how the repair route is selected, including the cell cycle phase and chromatin segment where the break occurred. In terms of initiating 5’ end DNA repair, the p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) and BRCA1 are important protein components that influence double-strand break repair pathway selection. The 53BP1 complex attaches to chromatin near DNA breaks and activates downstream factors such as Rap1-Interacting Factor 1 (RIF1) and shieldin, which protects DNA ends against nucleolytic destruction. DNA damage process occurs within the condition of chromatin, and the constantly changing chromatin environment has a large effect on it. Accessing and repairing the damaged cell of DNA, the genome condenses into chromatin and repairing it through modifying the histone residues. Through altering the chromatin structure, histones residues are adding chemical groups namely phosphate, acetyl and one or more methyl groups and these control the expressions of gene building by proteins to acquire DNA. Moreover, resynthesis of the delighted zone, DNA will be repaired by processing and restructuring the damaged bases. In order to maintain genomic integrity, “homologous recombination and classical non-homologous end joining process” has been followed by DNA to be repaired.

The packaging of eukaryotic DNA into chromatin presents a barrier to all DNA-based processes that require recruitment of enzymes to their sites of action. To allow the critical cellular process of DNA repair, the chromatin must be remodeled. In eukaryotes, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes and histone-modifying enzymes are two predominant factors employed to accomplish this remodeling process.

Chromatin relaxation occurs rapidly at the site of DNA damage. This process is initiated by PARP1 protein that starts to appear at DNA damage in less than a second, with half maximum accumulation within 1.6 seconds after the damage occurs. Next the chromatin remodeler Alc1 quickly attaches to the product of PARP1, and completes arrival at the DNA damage within 10 seconds of the damage. About half of the maximum chromatin relaxation, presumably due to action of Alc1, occurs by 10 seconds. This then allows recruitment of the DNA repair enzyme MRE11, to initiate DNA repair, within 13 seconds.

γH2AX, the phosphorylated form of H2AX is also involved in the early steps leading to chromatin decondensation after DNA damage occurrence. The histone variant H2AX constitutes about 10% of the H2A histones in human chromatin. γH2AX (H2AX phosphorylated on serine 139) can be detected as soon as 20 seconds after irradiation of cells (with DNA double-strand break formation), and half maximum accumulation of γH2AX occurs in one minute. The extent of chromatin with phosphorylated γH2AX is about two million base pairs at the site of a DNA double-strand break. γH2AX does not, itself, cause chromatin decondensation, but within 30 seconds of irradiation, RNF8 protein can be detected in association with γH2AX. RNF8 mediates extensive chromatin decondensation, through its subsequent interaction with CHD4, a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex NuRD.

After undergoing relaxation subsequent to DNA damage, followed by DNA repair, chromatin recovers to a compaction state close to its pre-damage level after about 20 min.

==Methods to investigate chromatin==

# ChIP-seq (Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) is recognized as the vastly utilized chromatin identification method it has been using the antibodies that actively selected, identify and combine with proteins including &quot;histones, histone restructuring, transaction factors and cofactors&quot;. This has been providing data about the state of chromatin and the transaction of a gene by trimming &quot;oligonucleotides&quot; that are unbound. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing aimed against different histone modifications, can be used to identify chromatin states throughout the genome. Different modifications have been linked to various states of chromatin. 
# DNase-seq (DNase I hypersensitive sites Sequencing) uses the sensitivity of accessible regions in the genome to the DNase I enzyme to map open or accessible regions in the genome. 
# FAIRE-seq (Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements sequencing) uses the chemical properties of protein-bound DNA in a two-phase separation method to extract nucleosome depleted regions from the genome.
# ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposable Accessible Chromatin sequencing) uses the Tn5 transposase to integrate (synthetic) transposons into accessible regions of the genome consequentially highlighting the localisation of nucleosomes and transcription factors across the genome.
# DNA footprinting is a method aimed at identifying protein-bound DNA. It uses labeling and fragmentation coupled to gel electrophoresis to identify areas of the genome that have been bound by proteins. 
# MNase-seq (Micrococcal Nuclease sequencing) uses the micrococcal nuclease enzyme to identify nucleosome positioning throughout the genome.
# Chromosome conformation capture determines the spatial organization of chromatin in the nucleus, by inferring genomic locations that physically interact.
# MACC profiling (Micrococcal nuclease ACCessibility profiling) uses titration series of chromatin digests with micrococcal nuclease to identify chromatin accessibility as well as to map nucleosomes and non-histone DNA-binding proteins in both open and closed regions of the genome.

==Chromatin and knots==

It has been a puzzle how decondensed interphase chromosomes remain essentially unknotted. The natural expectation is that in the presence of type II DNA topoisomerases that permit passages of double-stranded DNA regions through each other, all chromosomes should reach the state of topological equilibrium. The topological equilibrium in highly crowded interphase chromosomes forming chromosome territories would result in formation of highly knotted chromatin fibres. However, Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) methods revealed that the decay of contacts with the genomic distance in interphase chromosomes is practically the same as in the crumpled globule state that is formed when long polymers condense without formation of any knots. To remove knots from highly crowded chromatin, one would need an active process that should not only provide the energy to move the system from the state of topological equilibrium but also guide topoisomerase-mediated passages in such a way that knots would be efficiently unknotted instead of making the knots even more complex. It has been shown that the process of chromatin-loop extrusion is ideally suited to actively unknot chromatin fibres in interphase chromosomes.

==Chromatin: alternative definitions==

The term, introduced by Walther Flemming, has multiple meanings:
# Simple and concise definition: Chromatin is a macromolecular complex of a DNA macromolecule and protein macromolecules (and RNA). The proteins package and arrange the DNA and control its functions within the cell nucleus.
# A biochemists&#x27; operational definition: Chromatin is the DNA/protein/RNA complex extracted from eukaryotic lysed interphase nuclei. Just which of the multitudinous substances present in a nucleus will constitute a part of the extracted material partly depends on the technique each researcher uses. Furthermore, the composition and properties of chromatin vary from one cell type to another, during the development of a specific cell type, and at different stages in the cell cycle.
# The &quot;DNA + histone = chromatin&quot; definition: The DNA double helix in the cell nucleus is packaged by special proteins termed histones. The formed protein/DNA complex is called chromatin. The basic structural unit of chromatin is the nucleosome.

The first definition allows for &quot;chromatins&quot; to be defined in other domains of life like bacteria and archaea, using any DNA-binding proteins that condenses the molecule. These proteins are usually referred to nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs); examples include AsnC/LrpC with HU. In addition, some archaea do produce nucleosomes from proteins homologous to eukaryotic histones.

Chromatin Remodeling:

Chromatin remodeling can result from covalent modification of histones that physically remodel, move or remove nucleosomes. Studies of Sanosaka et al. 2022, says that Chromatin remodeler CHD7 regulate cell type-specific gene expression in human neural crest cells.

<doc id="6934" wikidata="Q1147936" url="?curid=6934" title="Condition number">
<text>In numerical analysis, the condition number of a function measures how much the output value of the function can change for a small change in the input argument. This is used to measure how sensitive a function is to changes or errors in the input, and how much error in the output results from an error in the input. Very frequently, one is solving the inverse problem: given formula_1 one is solving for &quot;x,&quot; and thus the condition number of the (local) inverse must be used.

The condition number is derived from the theory of propagation of uncertainty, and is formally defined as the value of the asymptotic worst-case relative change in output for a relative change in input. The &quot;function&quot; is the solution of a problem and the &quot;arguments&quot; are the data in the problem. The condition number is frequently applied to questions in linear algebra, in which case the derivative is straightforward but the error could be in many different directions, and is thus computed from the geometry of the matrix. More generally, condition numbers can be defined for non-linear functions in several variables.

A problem with a low condition number is said to be well-conditioned, while a problem with a high condition number is said to be ill-conditioned. In non-mathematical terms, an ill-conditioned problem is one where, for a small change in the inputs (the independent variables) there is a large change in the answer or dependent variable. This means that the correct solution/answer to the equation becomes hard to find. The condition number is a property of the problem. Paired with the problem are any number of algorithms that can be used to solve the problem, that is, to calculate the solution. Some algorithms have a property called &quot;backward stability&quot;; in general, a backward stable algorithm can be expected to accurately solve well-conditioned problems. Numerical analysis textbooks give formulas for the condition numbers of problems and identify known backward stable algorithms.

As a rule of thumb, if the condition number formula_2, then you may lose up to formula_3 digits of accuracy on top of what would be lost to the numerical method due to loss of precision from arithmetic methods. However, the condition number does not give the exact value of the maximum inaccuracy that may occur in the algorithm. It generally just bounds it with an estimate (whose computed value depends on the choice of the norm to measure the inaccuracy).

== General definition in the context of error analysis ==

Given a problem formula_4 and an algorithm formula_5 with an input formula_6 and output formula_7 the &quot;error&quot; is formula_8 the &quot;absolute&quot; error is formula_9 and the &quot;relative&quot; error is formula_10

In this context, the &quot;absolute&quot; condition number of a problem formula_4 is

: formula_12

and the &quot;relative&quot; condition number is

: formula_13

== Matrices ==

For example, the condition number associated with the linear equation
&quot;Ax&quot; = &quot;b&quot; gives a bound on how inaccurate the solution &quot;x&quot; will be after approximation. Note that this is before the effects of round-off error are taken into account; conditioning is a property of the matrix, not the algorithm or floating-point accuracy of the computer used to solve the corresponding system. In particular, one should think of the condition number as being (very roughly) the rate at which the solution &quot;x&quot; will change with respect to a change in &quot;b&quot;. Thus, if the condition number is large, even a small error in &quot;b&quot; may cause a large error in &quot;x&quot;. On the other hand, if the condition number is small, then the error in &quot;x&quot; will not be much bigger than the error in &quot;b&quot;.

The condition number is defined more precisely to be the maximum ratio of the relative error in &quot;x&quot; to the relative error in &quot;b&quot;.

Let &quot;e&quot; be the error in &quot;b&quot;. Assuming that &quot;A&quot; is a nonsingular matrix, the error in the solution &quot;A&quot;−1&quot;b&quot; is &quot;A&quot;−1&quot;e&quot;. The ratio of the relative error in the solution to the relative error in &quot;b&quot; is

: formula_14

The maximum value (for nonzero &quot;b&quot; and &quot;e&quot;) is then seen to be the product of the two operator norms as follows:

:formula_15

The same definition is used for any consistent norm, i.e. one that satisfies

: formula_16

When the condition number is exactly one (which can only happen if &quot;A&quot; is a scalar multiple of a linear isometry), then a solution algorithm can find (in principle, meaning if the algorithm introduces no errors of its own) an approximation of the solution whose precision is no worse than that of the data.

However, it does not mean that the algorithm will converge rapidly to this solution, just that it will not diverge arbitrarily because of inaccuracy on the source data (backward error), provided that the forward error introduced by the algorithm does not diverge as well because of accumulating intermediate rounding errors.

The condition number may also be infinite, but this implies that the problem is ill-posed (does not possess a unique, well-defined solution for each choice of data; that is, the matrix is not invertible), and no algorithm can be expected to reliably find a solution.

The definition of the condition number depends on the choice of norm, as can be illustrated by two examples.

If formula_17 is the matrix norm induced by the (vector) Euclidean norm (sometimes known as the &quot;L&quot;2 norm and typically denoted as formula_18), then

: formula_19

where formula_20 and formula_21 are maximal and minimal singular values of formula_22 respectively. Hence:

* If formula_22 is normal, then formula_24 where formula_25 and formula_26 are maximal and minimal (by moduli) eigenvalues of formula_22 respectively.
* If formula_22 is unitary, then formula_29

The condition number with respect to &quot;L&quot;2 arises so often in numerical linear algebra that it is given a name, the condition number of a matrix.

If formula_17 is the matrix norm induced by the formula_31 (vector) norm and formula_22 is lower triangular non-singular (i.e. formula_33 for all formula_34), then

: formula_35

recalling that the eigenvalues of any triangular matrix are simply the diagonal entries.

The condition number computed with this norm is generally larger than the condition number computed relative to the Euclidean norm, but it can be evaluated more easily (and this is often the only practicably computable condition number, when the problem to solve involves a &quot;non-linear algebra&quot;, for example when approximating irrational and transcendental functions or numbers with numerical methods).

If the condition number is not significantly larger than one, the matrix is well-conditioned, which means that its inverse can be computed with good accuracy. If the condition number is very large, then the matrix is said to be ill-conditioned. Practically, such a matrix is almost singular, and the computation of its inverse, or solution of a linear system of equations is prone to large numerical errors. 

A matrix that is not invertible is often said to have a condition number equal to infinity. Alternatively, it can be defined as formula_36, where formula_37 is the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse. For square matrices, this unfortunately makes the condition number discontinuous, but it is a useful definition for rectangular matrices, which are never invertible but are still used to define systems of equations.

== Nonlinear ==
Condition numbers can also be defined for nonlinear functions, and can be computed using calculus. The condition number varies with the point; in some cases one can use the maximum (or supremum) condition number over the domain of the function or domain of the question as an overall condition number, while in other cases the condition number at a particular point is of more interest.

=== One variable ===

The &quot;absolute&quot; condition number of a differentiable function formula_4 in one variable is the absolute value of the derivative of the function:

: formula_39

The &quot;relative&quot; condition number of formula_4 as a function is formula_41. Evaluated at a point formula_6, this is

: formula_43

Note that this is the absolute value of the elasticity of a function in economics.

Most elegantly, this can be understood as (the absolute value of) the ratio of the logarithmic derivative of formula_4, which is formula_45, and the logarithmic derivative of formula_6, which is formula_47, yielding a ratio of formula_48. This is because the logarithmic derivative is the infinitesimal rate of relative change in a function: it is the derivative formula_49 scaled by the value of formula_4. Note that if a function has a zero at a point, its condition number at the point is infinite, as infinitesimal changes in the input can change the output from zero to positive or negative, yielding a ratio with zero in the denominator, hence infinite relative change.

More directly, given a small change formula_51 in formula_6, the relative change in formula_6 is formula_54, while the relative change in formula_55 is formula_56. Taking the ratio yields

: formula_57

The last term is the difference quotient (the slope of the secant line), and taking the limit yields the derivative.

Condition numbers of common elementary functions are particularly important in computing significant figures and can be computed immediately from the derivative. A few important ones are given below:
=== Several variables ===

Condition numbers can be defined for any function formula_4 mapping its data from some domain (e.g. an formula_59-tuple of real numbers formula_6) into some codomain (e.g. an formula_61-tuple of real numbers formula_55), where both the domain and codomain are Banach spaces. They express how sensitive that function is to small changes (or small errors) in its arguments. This is crucial in assessing the sensitivity and potential accuracy difficulties of numerous computational problems, for example, polynomial root finding or computing eigenvalues.

The condition number of formula_4 at a point formula_6 (specifically, its relative condition number) is then defined to be the maximum ratio of the fractional change in formula_55 to any fractional change in formula_6, in the limit where the change formula_67 in formula_6 becomes infinitesimally small:

: formula_69

where formula_17 is a norm on the domain/codomain of formula_4.

If formula_4 is differentiable, this is equivalent to:

: formula_73

where denotes the Jacobian matrix of partial derivatives of formula_4 at formula_6, and formula_76 is the induced norm on the matrix.

<doc id="6936" wikidata="Q217525" url="?curid=6936" title="Cheddar cheese">
<text>Cheddar cheese (or simply cheddar) is a natural cheese that is relatively hard, off-white (or orange if colourings such as annatto are added), and sometimes sharp-tasting. It originates from the English village of Cheddar in Somerset, South West England.

Cheddar is produced all over the world, and &quot;cheddar cheese&quot; has no Protected Designation of Origin (PDO). In 2007, the name West Country Farmhouse Cheddar was registered in the European Union and (after Brexit) the United Kingdom, defined as cheddar produced from local milk within Somerset, Dorset, Devon and Cornwall and manufactured using traditional methods. Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) was registered for Orkney Scottish Island Cheddar in 2013 in the EU, which also applies under UK law.

Globally, the style and quality of cheeses labelled as cheddar varies greatly, with some processed cheeses packaged as &quot;cheddar&quot;. Cheeses similar to Red Leicester are sometimes marketed as &quot;red cheddar&quot;.

Cheddar is the most popular cheese in the UK, accounting for 51% of the country&#x27;s £1.9 billion annual cheese market. It is the second-most popular cheese in the United States behind mozzarella, with an average annual consumption of per capita. The United States produced approximately of cheddar in 2014, and the UK produced in 2008.

==History==

Cheddar cheese originates from the village of Cheddar in Somerset, southwest England. Cheddar Gorge on the edge of the village contains a number of caves, which provided the ideal humidity and steady temperature for maturing the cheese. Cheddar traditionally had to be made within of Wells Cathedral.

The 19th-century Somerset dairyman Joseph Harding was central to the modernisation and standardisation of cheddar. For his technical innovations, promotion of dairy hygiene, and volunteer dissemination of modern cheese-making techniques, Harding has been dubbed &quot;the father of cheddar&quot;. Harding introduced new equipment to the process of cheese-making, including his &quot;revolving breaker&quot; for curd cutting; the revolving breaker saved much manual effort in the cheese-making process. The &quot;Joseph Harding method&quot; was the first modern system for cheddar production based upon scientific principles. Harding stated that cheddar cheese is &quot;not made in the field, nor in the byre, nor even in the cow, it is made in the dairy&quot;. Together, Joseph Harding and his wife introduced cheddar in Scotland and North America, while his sons Henry and William Harding were responsible for introducing cheddar cheese production to Australia and facilitating the establishment of the cheese industry in New Zealand, respectively.

During the Second World War and for nearly a decade thereafter, most of the milk in Britain was used to make a single kind of cheese nicknamed &quot;government cheddar&quot; as part of the war economy and rationing. As a result, almost all other cheese production in the country was wiped out. Before the First World War, more than 3,500 cheese producers were in Britain; fewer than 100 remained after the Second World War.

According to a United States Department of Agriculture researcher, cheddar is the world&#x27;s most popular cheese and is the most studied type of cheese in scientific publications.

==Process==
During the manufacture of cheddar, the curds and whey are separated using rennet, an enzyme complex normally produced from the stomachs of newborn calves, while in vegetarian or kosher cheeses, bacterial, yeast or mould-derived chymosin is used.

&quot;Cheddaring&quot; refers to an additional step in the production of cheddar cheese where, after heating, the curd is kneaded with salt, cut into cubes to drain the whey, and then stacked and turned. Strong, extra-mature cheddar, sometimes called vintage, needs to be matured for 15 months or more. The cheese is kept at a constant temperature, often requiring special facilities. As with other hard cheese varieties produced worldwide, caves provide an ideal environment for maturing cheese; still, today, some cheddar is matured in the caves at Wookey Hole and Cheddar Gorge. Additionally, some versions of cheddar are smoked.
==Character==

The ideal quality of the original Somerset cheddar was described by Joseph Harding in 1864 as &quot;close and firm in texture, yet mellow in character or quality; it is rich with a tendency to melt in the mouth, the flavour full and fine, approaching to that of a hazelnut&quot;.

Cheddar made in the classical way tends to have a sharp, pungent flavour, often slightly earthy. The &quot;sharpness&quot; of cheddar is associated with the levels of bitter peptides in the cheese. This bitterness has been found to be significant to the overall perception of the aged cheddar flavour. The texture is firm, with farmhouse traditional cheddar being slightly crumbly; it should also, if mature, contain large cheese crystals consisting of calcium lactate – often precipitated when matured for times longer than six months.

Cheddar can be a deep to pale yellow (off-white) colour, or a yellow-orange colour when certain plant extracts are added, such as beet juice. One commonly used spice is annatto, extracted from seeds of the tropical achiote tree. Originally added to simulate the colour of high-quality milk from grass-fed Jersey and Guernsey cows, annatto may also impart a sweet, nutty flavour. The largest producer of cheddar cheese in the United States, Kraft, uses a combination of annatto and oleoresin paprika, an extract of the lipophilic (oily) portion of paprika.

Cheddar was sometimes (and still can be found) packaged in black wax, but was more commonly packaged in larded cloth, which was impermeable to contaminants, but still allowed the cheese to &quot;breathe&quot;.

=== Original-cheddar designation ===
The Slow Food Movement has created a cheddar presidium, arguing that only three cheeses should be called &quot;original cheddar&quot;. Their specifications, which go further than the &quot;West Country Farmhouse Cheddar&quot; PDO, require that cheddar be made in Somerset and with traditional methods, such as using raw milk, traditional animal rennet, and a cloth wrapping.

==International production==
The &quot;cheddar cheese&quot; name is used internationally; its name does not have a protected designation of origin, but the use of the name &quot;West Country Farmhouse Cheddar&quot; does. In addition to the United Kingdom, cheddar is also made in Australia, Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden, Finland, Uruguay and the United States. Cheddars can be either industrial or artisan cheeses. The flavour, colour, and quality of industrial cheese varies significantly, and food packaging will usually indicate a strength, such as mild, medium, strong, tasty, sharp, extra sharp, mature, old, or vintage; this may indicate the maturation period, or food additives used to enhance the flavour. Artisan varieties develop strong and diverse flavours over time.

===Australia===
As of 2013, cheddar accounts for over 55% of the Australian cheese market, with average annual consumption around per person. Cheddar is so commonly found that the name is rarely used: instead, cheddar is sold by strength alone as e.g. &quot;mild&quot;, &quot;tasty&quot; or &quot;sharp&quot;.

===Canada===
Following a wheat midge outbreak in Canada in the mid-19th century, farmers in Ontario began to convert to dairy farming in large numbers, and cheddar cheese became their main exportable product, even being exported to England. By the turn of the 20th century, 1,242 cheddar factories were in Ontario, and cheddar had become Canada&#x27;s second-largest export after timber. Cheddar exports totalled in 1904, but by 2012, Canada was a net importer of cheese. James L. Kraft grew up on a dairy farm in Ontario, before moving to Chicago. According to the writer Sarah Champman, &quot;Although we cannot wholly lay the decline of cheese craft in Canada at the feet of James Lewis Kraft, it did correspond with the rise of Kraft’s processed cheese empire.&quot; Most Canadian cheddar is produced in the provinces of Québec (40.8%) and Ontario (36%), though other provinces produce some and some smaller artisanal producers exist. The annual production is 120,000 tons. It is aged a minimum of three months, but much of it is held for much longer, up to 10 years.

Canadian cheddar cheese soup is a featured dish at the Canada Pavilion at Epcot in Walt Disney World.

Percentage of butterfat or milk fat must be labelled by the words &quot;milk fat&quot; or abbreviations &quot;B.F.&quot; or &quot;M.F.&quot;

===New Zealand===
Most of the cheddar produced in New Zealand is factory-made, although some are handmade by artisan cheesemakers. Factory-made cheddar is generally sold relatively young within New Zealand, but the Anchor dairy company ships New Zealand cheddars to the UK, where the blocks mature for another year or so.

===United Kingdom===

Only one producer of the cheese is now based in the village of Cheddar, the Cheddar Gorge Cheese Co. The name &quot;cheddar&quot; is not protected under European Union or UK law, though the name &quot;West Country Farmhouse Cheddar&quot; has an EU and (following Brexit) a UK protected designation of origin (PDO) registration, and may only be produced in Somerset, Devon, Dorset and Cornwall, using milk sourced from those counties. Cheddar is usually sold as mild, medium, mature, extra mature or vintage. Cheddar produced in Orkney is registered as an EU protected geographical indication under the name &quot;Orkney Scottish Island Cheddar&quot;. This protection highlights the use of traditional methods, passed down through generations since 1946 and its uniqueness in comparison to other cheddar cheeses. &quot;West Country Farmhouse Cheddar&quot; is protected outside the UK and the EU as a Geographical Indication also in China, Georgia, Iceland, Japan, Moldova, Montenegro, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland and Ukraine.

Furthermore, a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) was registered for &quot;Orkney Scottish Island Cheddar&quot; in 2013 in the EU, which also applies under UK law. It is protected as a geographical indication in Iceland, Montenegro, Norway and Serbia.

=== United States ===

The state of Wisconsin produces the most cheddar cheese in the United States; other centres of production include California, Idaho, New York, Vermont, Oregon, Texas, and Oklahoma. It is sold in several varieties, namely mild, medium, sharp, extra sharp, New York style, white, and Vermont. New York–style cheddar is particularly sharp/acidic, but tends to be somewhat softer than the milder-tasting varieties. Cheddar that does not contain annatto is frequently labelled &quot;white cheddar&quot; or &quot;Vermont cheddar&quot;, regardless of whether it was actually produced there. Vermont&#x27;s three creameries produce cheddar cheeses – Cabot Creamery, which produces the 16-month-old &quot;Private Stock Cheddar&quot;; the Grafton Village Cheese Company; and Shelburne Farms.

Some processed cheeses or &quot;cheese foods&quot; are called &quot;cheddar flavored&quot;. Examples include Easy Cheese, a cheese-food packaged in a pressurised spray can; also, as packs of square, sliced, individually-wrapped &quot;process cheese&quot;, which is sometimes also pasteurised.

Cheddar is one of several products used by the United States Department of Agriculture to track the status of America&#x27;s overall dairy industry; reports are issued weekly detailing prices and production quantities.
==Records==
U.S. President Andrew Jackson once held an open house party at the White House at which he served a block of cheddar. The White House is said to have smelled of cheese for weeks.

A cheese of was produced in Ingersoll, Ontario, in 1866 and exhibited in New York and Britain; it was described in the poem &quot;Ode on the Mammoth Cheese Weighing over 7,000 Pounds&quot; by Canadian poet James McIntyre.

In 1893, farmers from the town of Perth, Ontario, produced the &quot;mammoth cheese&quot;, which weighed for the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair. It was to be exhibited at the Canadian display, but the mammoth cheese fell through the floor and was placed on a reinforced concrete floor in the Agricultural Building. It received the most journalistic attention at the fair and was awarded the bronze medal. A larger, Wisconsin cheese of was made for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. A cheese this size would use the equivalent of the daily milk production of 16,000 cows.

Oregon members of the Federation of American Cheese-makers created the largest cheddar in 1989. The cheese weighed .

In 2012, Wisconsin cheese shop owner Edward Zahn discovered and sold a batch of unintentionally aged cheddar up to 40 years old, possibly &quot;the oldest collection of cheese ever assembled and sold to the public&quot;. The old cheese has extensive crystallization on the outside and is &quot;creamier and overwhelmingly sharp&quot; on the inside.

<text>An order in architecture is a certain assemblage of parts subject to uniform established proportions, regulated by the office that each part has to perform.
Coming down to the present from Ancient Greek and Ancient Roman civilization, the architectural orders are the styles of classical architecture, each distinguished by its proportions and characteristic profiles and details, and most readily recognizable by the type of column employed. The three orders of architecture—the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian—originated in Greece. To these the Romans added, in practice if not in name, the Tuscan, which they made simpler than Doric, and the Composite, which was more ornamental than the Corinthian. The architectural order of a classical building is akin to the mode or key of classical music; the grammar or rhetoric of a written composition. It is established by certain &quot;modules&quot; like the intervals of music, and it raises certain expectations in an audience attuned to its language.

Whereas the orders were essentially structural in Ancient Greek architecture, which made little use of the arch until its late period, in Roman architecture where the arch was often dominant, the orders became increasingly decorative elements except in porticos and similar uses. Columns shrank into half-columns emerging from walls or turned into pilasters. This treatment continued after the conscious and &quot;correct&quot; use of the orders, initially following exclusively Roman models, returned in the Italian Renaissance. Greek Revival architecture, inspired by increasing knowledge of Greek originals, returned to more authentic models, including ones from relatively early periods.

== Elements ==

Each style has distinctive capitals at the top of columns and horizontal entablatures which it supports, while the rest of the building does not in itself vary between the orders. The column shaft and base also varies with the order, and is sometimes articulated with vertical concave grooves known as fluting. The shaft is wider at the bottom than at the top, because its entasis, beginning a third of the way up, imperceptibly makes the column slightly more slender at the top, although some Doric columns, especially early Greek ones, are visibly &quot;flared&quot;, with straight profiles that narrow going up the shaft.

The capital rests on the shaft. It has a load-bearing function, which concentrates the weight of the entablature on the supportive column, but it primarily serves an aesthetic purpose. The necking is the continuation of the shaft, but is visually separated by one or many grooves. The echinus lies atop the necking. It is a circular block that bulges outwards towards the top to support the abacus, which is a square or shaped block that in turn supports the entablature. The entablature consists of three horizontal layers, all of which are visually separated from each other using moldings or bands. In Roman and post-Renaissance work, the entablature may be carried from column to column in the form of an arch that springs from the column that bears its weight, retaining its divisions and sculptural enrichment, if any. There are names for all the many parts of the orders.

== Measurement ==
The heights of columns are calculated in terms of a ratio between the diameter of the shaft at its base and the height of the column. A Doric column can be described as seven diameters high, an Ionic column as eight diameters high, and a Corinthian column nine diameters high, although the actual ratios used vary considerably in both ancient and revived examples, but still keeping to the trend of increasing slimness between the orders. Sometimes this is phrased as &quot;lower diameters high&quot;, to establish which part of the shaft has been measured.

== Greek orders ==
There are three distinct orders in Ancient Greek architecture: Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. These three were adopted by the Romans, who modified their capitals. The Roman adoption of the Greek orders took place in the 1st century BC. The three ancient Greek orders have since been consistently used in European Neoclassical architecture.

Sometimes the Doric order is considered the earliest order, but there is no evidence to support this. Rather, the Doric and Ionic orders seem to have appeared at around the same time, the Ionic in eastern Greece and the Doric in the west and mainland.

Both the Doric and the Ionic order appear to have originated in wood. The Temple of Hera in Olympia is the oldest well-preserved temple of Doric architecture. It was built just after 600 BC. The Doric order later spread across Greece and into Sicily, where it was the chief order for monumental architecture for 800 years. Early Greeks were no doubt aware of the use of stone columns with bases and capitals in ancient Egyptian architecture, and that of other Near Eastern cultures, although there they were mostly used in interiors, rather than as a dominant feature of all or part of exteriors, in the Greek style. 
=== Doric order===

The Doric order originated on the mainland and western Greece. It is the simplest of the orders, characterized by short, organized, heavy columns with plain, round capitals (tops) and no base. With a height that is only four to eight times its diameter, the columns are the most squat of all orders. The shaft of the Doric order is channeled with 20 flutes. The capital consists of a necking or annulet, which is a simple ring. The echinus is convex, or circular cushion like stone, and the abacus is a square slab of stone.

Above the capital is a square abacus connecting the capital to the entablature. The entablature is divided into three horizontal registers, the lower part of which is either smooth or divided by horizontal lines. The upper half is distinctive for the Doric order. The frieze of the Doric entablature is divided into triglyphs and metopes. A triglyph is a unit consisting of three vertical bands which are separated by grooves. Metopes are the plain or carved reliefs between two triglyphs.

The Greek forms of the Doric order come without an individual base. They instead are placed directly on the stylobate. Later forms, however, came with the conventional base consisting of a plinth and a torus. The Roman versions of the Doric order have smaller proportions. As a result, they appear lighter than the Greek orders.

=== Ionic order ===

The Ionic order came from eastern Greece, where its origins are entwined with the similar but little known Aeolic order. It is distinguished by slender, fluted pillars with a large base and two opposed volutes (also called &quot;scrolls&quot;) in the echinus of the capital. The echinus itself is decorated with an egg-and-dart motif. The Ionic shaft comes with four more flutes than the Doric counterpart (totalling 24). The Ionic base has two convex moldings called &quot;tori&quot;, which are separated by a scotia.

The Ionic order is also marked by an entasis, a curved tapering in the column shaft. A column of the Ionic order is nine times more tall than its lower diameter. The shaft itself is eight diameters high. The architrave of the entablature commonly consists of three stepped bands (&quot;fasciae&quot;). The frieze comes without the Doric triglyph and metope. The frieze sometimes comes with a continuous ornament such as carved figures instead.

=== Corinthian order ===

The Corinthian order is the most elaborated of the Greek orders, characterized by a slender fluted column having an ornate capital decorated with two rows of acanthus leaves and four scrolls. The shaft of the Corinthian order has 24 flutes. The column is commonly ten diameters high.

The Roman writer Vitruvius credited the invention of the Corinthian order to Callimachus, a Greek sculptor of the 5th century BC. The oldest known building built according to this order is the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates in Athens, constructed from 335 to 334 BC. The Corinthian order was raised to rank by the writings of Vitruvius in the 1st century BC.

== Roman orders ==
The Romans adapted all the Greek orders and also developed two orders of their own, basically modifications of Greek orders. However, it was not until the Renaissance that these were named and formalized as the Tuscan and Composite, respectively the plainest and most ornate of the orders. The Romans also invented the Superposed order. A superposed order is when successive stories of a building have different orders. The heaviest orders were at the bottom, whilst the lightest came at the top. This means that the Doric order was the order of the ground floor, the Ionic order was used for the middle story, while the Corinthian or the Composite order was used for the top story.

The Giant order was invented by architects in the Renaissance. The Giant order is characterized by columns that extend the height of two or more stories.

=== Tuscan order ===
The Tuscan order has a very plain design, with a plain shaft, and a simple capital, base, and frieze. It is a simplified adaptation of the Greeks&#x27; Doric order. The Tuscan order is characterized by an unfluted shaft and a capital that consists of only an echinus and an abacus. In proportions it is similar to the Doric order, but overall it is significantly plainer. The column is normally seven diameters high. Compared to the other orders, the Tuscan order looks the most solid.

=== Composite order ===

The Composite order is a mixed order, combining the volutes of the Ionic with the leaves of the Corinthian order. Until the Renaissance it was not ranked as a separate order. Instead it was considered as a late Roman form of the Corinthian order. The column of the Composite order is typically ten diameters high.

== Historical development ==
The Renaissance period saw renewed interest in the literary sources of the ancient cultures of Greece and Rome, and the fertile development of a new architecture based on classical principles. The treatise by Roman theoretician, architect and engineer Vitruvius, is the only architectural writing that survived from Antiquity. Effectively rediscovered in the 15th century, Vitruvius came to be regarded as the ultimate authority on architecture. However, in his text the word &quot;order&quot; is not to be found. To describe the four species of columns (he only mentions: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic and Corinthian) he uses, in fact, various words such as: &quot;genus&quot; (gender), &quot;mos&quot; (habit, fashion, manner), &quot;opera&quot; (work).
The term &quot;order&quot;, as well as the idea of redefining the &quot;canon&quot; started circulating in Rome, at the beginning of the 16th century, probably during the studies of Vitruvius&#x27; text conducted and shared by Peruzzi, Raphael, and Sangallo.
Ever since, the definition of the &quot;canon&quot; has been a collective endeavor that involved several generations of European architects, from Renaissance and Baroque periods, basing their theories both on the study of Vitruvius&#x27; writings and the observation of Roman ruins (the Greek ruins became available only after Greek Independence, 1821–1823). What was added were rules for the use of the Architectural Orders, and the exact proportions of them in minute detail. Commentary on the appropriateness of the orders for temples devoted to particular deities (Vitruvius I.2.5) were elaborated by Renaissance theorists, with Doric characterized as bold and manly, Ionic as matronly, and Corinthian as maidenly.
== Vignola defining the concept of &quot;order&quot; ==
 
Following the examples of Vitruvius and the five books of the &quot;Regole generali di architettura sopra le cinque maniere de gli edifici&quot; by Sebastiano Serlio published from 1537 onwards, Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola produced an architecture rule book that was not only more practical than the previous two treatises, but also was systematically and consistently adopting, for the first time, the term &#x27;order&#x27; to define each of the five different species of columns inherited from antiquity. A first publication of the various plates, as separate sheets, appeared in Rome in 1562, with the title: &quot;Regola delli cinque ordini d&#x27;architettura&quot; (&quot;Canon of the Five Orders of Architecture&quot;). As David Watkin has pointed out, Vignola&#x27;s book &quot;was to have an astonishing publishing history of over 500 editions in 400 years in ten languages, Italian, Dutch, English, Flemish, French, German, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, during which it became perhaps the most influential book of all times&quot;.

The book consisted simply of an introduction followed by 32 annotated plates, highlighting the proportional system with all the minute details of the Five Architectural Orders. According to Christof Thoenes, the main expert of Renaissance architectural treatises, &quot;in accordance with Vitruvius&#x27;s example, Vignola chose a &quot;module&quot; equal to a half-diameter which is the base of the system. All the other measurements are expressed in fractions or in multiples of this module. The result is an arithmetical model, and with its help each order, harmoniously proportioned, can easily be adapted to any given height, of a façade or an interior. From this point of view, Vignola&#x27;s Regola is a remarkable intellectual achievement&quot;.

In America, &quot;The American Builder&#x27;s Companion&quot;, written in the early 19th century by the architect Asher Benjamin, influenced many builders in the eastern states, particularly those who developed what became known as the Federal style. The last American re-interpretation of Vignola&#x27;s &quot;Regola&quot;, was edited in 1904 by William Robert Ware.

The break from the classical mode came first with the Gothic Revival architecture, then the development of modernism during the 19th century. The Bauhaus promoted pure functionalism, stripped of superfluous ornament, and that has become one of the defining characteristics of modern architecture. There are some exceptions. Postmodernism introduced an ironic use of the orders as a cultural reference, divorced from the strict rules of composition. On the other hand, a number of practitioners such as Quinlan Terry in England, and Michael Dwyer, Richard Sammons, and Duncan Stroik in the United States, continue the classical tradition, and use the classical orders in their work.

== Nonce orders ==
Several orders, usually based upon the composite order and only varying in the design of the capitals, have been invented under the inspiration of specific occasions, but have not been used again. They are termed &quot;nonce orders&quot; by analogy to &quot;nonce words&quot;; several examples follow below.

These nonce orders all express the &quot;speaking architecture&quot; (&quot;architecture parlante&quot;) that was taught in the Paris courses, most explicitly by Étienne-Louis Boullée, in which sculptural details of classical architecture could be enlisted to speak symbolically, the better to express the purpose of the structure and enrich its visual meaning with specific appropriateness. This idea was taken up strongly in the training of Beaux-Arts architecture, .

===French order===
The Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles contains pilasters with bronze capitals in the &quot;French order&quot;. Designed by Charles Le Brun, the capitals display the national emblems of the Kingdom of France: the royal sun between two Gallic roosters above a fleur-de-lis.

===British orders===
Robert Adam&#x27;s brother James was in Rome in 1762, drawing antiquities under the direction of Clérisseau; he invented a &quot;British order&quot; and published an engraving of it. Its capital the heraldic lion and unicorn take the place of the Composite&#x27;s volutes, a Byzantine or Romanesque conception, but expressed in terms of neoclassical realism. Adam&#x27;s ink-and-wash rendering with red highlighting is at the Avery Library, Columbia University.

In 1789 George Dance invented an Ammonite order, a variant of Ionic, substituting volutes in the form of fossil ammonites for John Boydell&#x27;s Shakespeare Gallery in Pall Mall, London.

An adaptation of the Corinthian order by William Donthorne that used turnip leaves and mangelwurzel is termed the Agricultural order.

Sir Edwin Lutyens, who from 1912 laid out New Delhi as the new seat of government for the British Empire in India, designed a Delhi order having a capital displaying a band of vertical ridges, and with bells hanging at each corner as a replacement for volutes. His design for the new city&#x27;s central palace, Viceroy&#x27;s House, now the Presidential residence Rashtrapati Bhavan, was a thorough integration of elements of Indian architecture into a building of classical forms and proportions, and made use of the order throughout. The Delhi Order reappears in some later Lutyens buildings including Campion Hall, Oxford.

===American orders===

In the United States Benjamin Latrobe, the architect of the Capitol building in Washington, DC, designed a series of botanical American orders. Most famous is the Corinthian order substituting ears of corn and their husks for the acanthus leaves, which was executed by Giuseppe Franzoni and used in the small domed vestibule of the Senate. Only this vestibule survived the Burning of Washington in 1814, nearly intact.

With peace restored, Latrobe designed an American order that substituted tobacco leaves for the acanthus, of which he sent a sketch to Thomas Jefferson in a letter, 5 November 1816. He was encouraged to send a model of it, which remains at Monticello. In the 1830s Alexander Jackson Davis admired it enough to make a drawing of it. In 1809 Latrobe invented a second American order, employing magnolia flowers constrained within the profile of classical mouldings, as his drawing demonstrates. It was intended for &quot;the Upper Columns in the Gallery of the Entrance of the Chamber of the Senate&quot;.

<doc id="6942" wikidata="Q162819" url="?curid=6942" title="Catherine of Aragon">
<text>Catherine of Aragon (also spelt as Katherine,
historical Spanish: , now: ; 16 December 1485 – 7 January 1536) was Queen of England as the first wife of King Henry VIII from their marriage on 11 June 1509 until its annulment on 23 May 1533. She was Princess of Wales while married to Henry&#x27;s elder brother, Arthur, Prince of Wales, for a short period before his death.

Catherine was born at the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace of Alcalá de Henares, and was the youngest child of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon. She was three years old when she was betrothed to Arthur, heir apparent to the English throne. They married in 1501, but Arthur died five months later. Catherine spent years in limbo, and during this time, she held the position of ambassador of the Aragonese crown to England in 1507, the first known female ambassador in European history. She married her former brother-in-law, Henry VIII, shortly after his accession in 1509. For six months in 1513, she served as regent of England while Henry was in France. During that time the English defeated a Scottish invasion at the Battle of Flodden, an event in which Catherine played an important part with an emotional speech about courage and patriotism.

By 1526, Henry was infatuated with Anne Boleyn and dissatisfied that his marriage to Catherine had produced no surviving sons, leaving their daughter Mary as heir presumptive at a time when there was no established precedent for a woman on the throne. He sought to have their marriage annulled, setting in motion a chain of events that led to England&#x27;s schism with the Catholic Church. When Pope Clement VII refused to annul the marriage, Henry defied him by assuming supremacy over religious matters in England. In 1533, their marriage was consequently declared invalid and Henry married Anne on the judgement of clergy in England, without reference to the pope. Catherine refused to accept Henry as supreme head of the Church in England and considered herself the King&#x27;s rightful wife and queen, attracting much popular sympathy. Despite this, Henry acknowledged her only as dowager princess of Wales. After being banished from court by Henry, Catherine lived out the remainder of her life at Kimbolton Castle, dying there in January 1536 of cancer. The English people held Catherine in high esteem, and her death set off tremendous mourning. Her daughter Mary became the first undisputed English queen regnant in 1553.

Catherine commissioned &quot;The Education of a Christian Woman&quot; by Juan Luis Vives, who dedicated the book, controversial at the time, to the Queen in 1523. Such was Catherine&#x27;s impression on people that even her adversary Thomas Cromwell said of her, &quot;If not for her sex, she could have defied all the heroes of History.&quot; She successfully appealed for the lives of the rebels involved in the Evil May Day, for the sake of their families, and also won widespread admiration by starting an extensive programme for the relief of the poor. Catherine was a patron of Renaissance humanism and a friend of the great scholars Erasmus of Rotterdam and Thomas More.

==Early life==

Catherine was born at the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace of Alcalá de Henares near Madrid, in the early hours of 16 December 1485. She was the youngest surviving child of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile. Her siblings were Joanna, Queen of Castile and of Aragon, Isabella, Queen of Portugal, John, Prince of Asturias, and Maria, Queen of Portugal.

Catherine was quite short in stature with long red hair, wide blue eyes, a round face, and a fair complexion. She was descended, on her maternal side, from the House of Lancaster, an English royal house; her great-grandmother Catherine of Lancaster, after whom she was named, and her great-great-grandmother Philippa of Lancaster were both daughters of John of Gaunt and granddaughters of Edward III of England. Consequently, she was third cousin of her father-in-law, Henry VII of England, and fourth cousin of her mother-in-law Elizabeth of York.

Catherine was educated by a tutor, Alessandro Geraldini, who was a clerk in Holy Orders. She studied arithmetic, canon and civil law, classical literature, genealogy and heraldry, history, philosophy, religion, and theology. She had a strong religious upbringing and developed her Roman Catholic faith that would play a major role in later life. She learned to speak, read and write in Castilian Spanish and Latin, and spoke French and Greek. Erasmus later said that Catherine &quot;loved good literature which she had studied with success since childhood&quot;. She had been given lessons in domestic skills, such as cooking, embroidery, lace-making, needlepoint, sewing, spinning, and weaving and was also taught music, dancing, drawing, as well as being carefully educated in good manners and court etiquette.

At an early age, Catherine was considered a suitable wife for Arthur, Prince of Wales, heir apparent to the English throne, due to the English ancestry she inherited from her mother. Theoretically, by means of her mother, Catherine had a stronger legitimate claim to the English throne than King Henry VII himself through the first two wives of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster: Blanche of Lancaster and Constance of Castile. In contrast, Henry VII was the descendant of Gaunt&#x27;s third marriage to Katherine Swynford, whose children were born out of wedlock and only legitimised after the death of Constance and the marriage of John to Katherine. The children of John and Katherine, while legitimised, were barred from inheriting the English throne, a stricture that was ignored in later generations. Because of Henry&#x27;s descent through illegitimate children barred from succession to the English throne, the Tudor monarchy was not accepted by all European kingdoms. At the time, the House of Trastámara was the most prestigious in Europe, due to the rule of the Catholic Monarchs, so the alliance of Catherine and Arthur validated the House of Tudor in the eyes of European royalty and strengthened the Tudor claim to the English throne via Catherine of Aragon&#x27;s ancestry. It would have given a male heir an indisputable claim to the throne. The two were married by proxy on 19 May 1499 and corresponded in Latin until Arthur turned fifteen, when it was decided that they were old enough to begin their conjugal life.

Catherine was accompanied to England by the following ambassadors: Diego Fernández de Córdoba y Mendoza, 3rd Count of Cabra; Alonso de Fonseca y Acevedo, Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela; and Antonio de Rojas Manrique, Bishop of Mallorca. Her Spanish retinue, including Francisco Felipe, was supervised by her duenna, Elvira Manuel.

At first it was thought Catherine&#x27;s ship would arrive at Gravesend. A number of English gentlewomen were appointed to be ready to welcome her on arrival in October 1501. They were to escort Catherine in a flotilla of barges on the Thames to the Tower of London.

==As wife and widow of Arthur==
Then-15-year-old Catherine departed from A Coruña on 17 August 1501 and met Arthur on 4 November at Dogmersfield in Hampshire. Little is known about their first impressions of each other, but Arthur did write to his parents-in-law that he would be &quot;a true and loving husband&quot; and told his parents that he was immensely happy to &quot;behold the face of his lovely bride&quot;. The couple had corresponded in Latin, but found that they could not understand each other&#x27;s spoken conversation, because they had learned different Latin pronunciations. Ten days later, on 14 November 1501, they were married at Old St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, both 15 years old. A dowry of 200,000 ducats had been agreed, and half was paid shortly after the marriage. It was noted that Catherine and her Spanish ladies in waiting were dressed in Spanish style at her arrival and at the wedding.

Once married, Arthur was sent to Ludlow Castle on the borders of Wales to preside over the Council of Wales and the Marches, as was his duty as Prince of Wales, and his bride accompanied him. A few months later, they both became ill, possibly with the sweating sickness, which was sweeping the area. Arthur died on 2 April 1502; 16-year-old Catherine recovered to find herself a widow.

At this point, Henry VII faced the challenge of avoiding the obligation to return her 200,000-ducat dowry, half of which he had not yet received, to her father, as required by her marriage contract should she return home. Following the death of Queen Elizabeth in February 1503, there were rumours of a potential marriage between Catherine and King Henry; such rumours were, however, unsubstantiated. It was agreed that Catherine would marry Henry VII&#x27;s second son, Henry, Duke of York, who was five years younger than she was. The death of Catherine&#x27;s mother, however, meant that her &quot;value&quot; in the marriage market decreased. Castile was a much larger kingdom than Aragon, and it was inherited by Catherine&#x27;s elder sister, Joanna. Ostensibly, the marriage was delayed until Henry was old enough, but Ferdinand II procrastinated so much over payment of the remainder of Catherine&#x27;s dowry that it became doubtful that the marriage would take place. She lived as a virtual prisoner at Durham House in London. Some of the letters she wrote to her father complaining of her treatment have survived. In one of these letters she tells him that &quot;I choose what I believe, and say nothing. For I am not as simple as I may seem.&quot; She had little money and struggled to cope, as she had to support her ladies-in-waiting as well as herself. In 1507 she served as the Spanish ambassador to England, the first female ambassador in European history. While Henry VII and his counsellors expected her to be easily manipulated, Catherine went on to prove them wrong.

Marriage to Arthur&#x27;s brother depended on the Pope granting a dispensation because canon law forbade a man to marry his brother&#x27;s widow. Catherine testified that her marriage to Arthur was never consummated as, also according to canon law, a marriage could be dissolved if it was not consummated.

==Queen of England==
===Wedding===
Catherine&#x27;s second wedding took place on 11 June 1509, seven years after Prince Arthur&#x27;s death. She married Henry VIII, who had only just acceded to the throne, in a private ceremony in the church of the Observant Friars outside Greenwich Palace. She was 23 years of age.

===Coronation===

On Saturday 23 June 1509, the traditional eve-of-coronation procession to Westminster Abbey was greeted by a large and enthusiastic crowd. As was the custom, the couple spent the night before their coronation at the Tower of London. On Midsummer&#x27;s Day, Sunday, 1509, Henry VIII and Catherine were anointed and crowned together by the Archbishop of Canterbury at a lavish ceremony at Westminster Abbey. The coronation was followed by a banquet in Westminster Hall. Many new Knights of the Bath were created in honour of the coronation. In that month that followed, many social occasions presented the new Queen to the English public. She made a fine impression and was well received by the people of England.

===Influence===
On 11 June 1513, Henry appointed Catherine Regent in England with the titles &quot;Governor of the Realm and Captain General&quot;, while he went to France on a military campaign. When Louis d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Longueville, was captured at Thérouanne, Henry sent him to stay in Catherine&#x27;s household. She wrote to Wolsey that she and her council would prefer the Duke to stay in the Tower of London as the Scots were &quot;so busy as they now be&quot; and she added her prayers for &quot;God to sende us as good lukke against the Scotts, as the King hath ther.&quot; The war with Scotland occupied her subjects, and she was &quot;horrible busy with making standards, banners, and badges&quot; at Richmond Palace. Catherine wrote to towns, including Gloucester, asking them to send muster lists of men able to serve as soldiers. The Scots invaded and on 3 September 1513, she ordered Thomas Lovell to raise an army in the midland counties.

Catherine was issued with banners at Richmond on 8 September, and rode north in full armour to address the troops, despite being heavily pregnant at the time. Her fine speech was reported to the historian Peter Martyr d&#x27;Anghiera in Valladolid within a fortnight. Although an Italian newsletter said she was north of London when news of the victory at Battle of Flodden Field reached her, she was near Buckingham. From Woburn Abbey, she sent a letter to Henry along with a piece of the bloodied coat of King James IV of Scotland, who died in the battle, for Henry to use as a banner at the siege of Tournai.

Catherine&#x27;s religious dedication increased as she became older, as did her interest in academics. She continued to broaden her knowledge and provide training for her daughter, Mary. Education among women became fashionable, partly because of Catherine&#x27;s influence, and she donated large sums of money to several colleges. Henry, however, still considered a male heir essential. The Tudor dynasty was new, and its legitimacy might still be tested.

In 1520, Catherine&#x27;s nephew, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, paid a state visit to England, and she urged Henry to enter an alliance with Charles rather than with France. Immediately after his departure, she accompanied Henry to France on the celebrated visit to Francis I, the Field of the Cloth of Gold. Within two years, war was declared against France and the Emperor was once again welcome in England, where plans were afoot to betroth him to Catherine&#x27;s daughter Mary.
===Pregnancies and children===

==The King&#x27;s great matter==
In 1525, Henry VIII became enamoured of Anne Boleyn, a lady-in-waiting to Queen Catherine; Anne was between ten and seventeen years younger than Henry, being born between 1501 and 1507. Henry began pursuing her; Catherine was no longer able to bear children by this time. Henry began to believe that his marriage was cursed and sought confirmation from the Bible, which he interpreted to say that if a man marries his brother&#x27;s wife, the couple will be childless. Even if her marriage to Arthur had not been consummated (and Catherine would insist to her dying day that she had come to Henry&#x27;s bed a virgin), Henry&#x27;s interpretation of that biblical passage meant that their marriage had been wrong in the eyes of God. Whether the pope at the time of Henry and Catherine&#x27;s marriage had the right to overrule Henry&#x27;s claimed scriptural impediment would become a hot topic in Henry&#x27;s campaign to wrest an annulment from the present Pope. It is possible that the idea of annulment had been suggested to Henry much earlier than this, and is highly probable that it was motivated by his desire for a son. Before Henry&#x27;s father ascended the throne, England was beset by civil warfare over rival claims to the English crown, and Henry may have wanted to avoid a similar uncertainty over the succession.

It soon became the one absorbing object of Henry&#x27;s desires to secure an annulment. Catherine was defiant when it was suggested that she quietly retire to a nunnery, saying: &quot;God never called me to a nunnery. I am the King&#x27;s true and legitimate wife.&quot; He set his hopes upon an appeal to the Holy See, acting independently of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, whom he told nothing of his plans. William Knight, the King&#x27;s secretary, was sent to Pope Clement VII to sue for an annulment, on the grounds that the dispensing bull of Pope Julius II was obtained by false pretenses.

As the pope was, at that time, the prisoner of Catherine&#x27;s nephew Emperor Charles V following the Sack of Rome in May 1527, Knight had difficulty in obtaining access to him. In the end, Henry&#x27;s envoy had to return without accomplishing much. Henry now had no choice but to put this great matter into the hands of Wolsey, who did all he could to secure a decision in Henry&#x27;s favour.

Both the Pope and Martin Luther raised the possibility that Henry have two wives, not to re-introduce polygamy generally, but &quot;to preserve the royal dignity of Catherine and Mary&quot;.
Wolsey went so far as to convene an ecclesiastical court in England with a representative of the Pope presiding, and Henry and Catherine herself in attendance. The Pope had no intention of allowing a decision to be reached in England, and his legate was recalled. (How far the Pope was influenced by Charles V is difficult to say, but it is clear Henry saw that the Pope was unlikely to annul his marriage to the Emperor&#x27;s aunt.) The Pope forbade Henry to marry again before a decision was given in Rome. Wolsey had failed and was dismissed from public office in 1529. Wolsey then began a secret plot to have Anne Boleyn forced into exile and began communicating with the Pope to that end. When this was discovered, Henry ordered Wolsey&#x27;s arrest and, had he not been terminally ill and died in 1530, he might have been executed for treason.

A year later, Catherine was banished from court, and her old rooms were given to Anne Boleyn. Catherine wrote in a letter to Charles V in 1531:

My tribulations are so great, my life so disturbed by the plans daily invented to further the King&#x27;s wicked intention, the surprises which the King gives me, with certain persons of his council, are so mortal, and my treatment is what God knows, that it is enough to shorten ten lives, much more mine.

When Archbishop of Canterbury William Warham died, the Boleyn family&#x27;s chaplain, Thomas Cranmer, was appointed to the vacant position.

When Henry decided to annul his marriage to Catherine, John Fisher became her most trusted counsellor and one of her chief supporters. He appeared in the legates&#x27; court on her behalf, where he shocked people with the directness of his language, and by declaring that, like John the Baptist, he was ready to die on behalf of the indissolubility of marriage. Henry was so enraged by this that he wrote a long Latin address to the legates in answer to Fisher&#x27;s speech. Fisher&#x27;s copy of this still exists, with his manuscript annotations in the margin which show how little he feared Henry&#x27;s anger. The removal of the cause to Rome ended Fisher&#x27;s role in the matter, but Henry never forgave him. Other people who supported Catherine&#x27;s case included Thomas More; Henry&#x27;s own sister Mary Tudor, Queen of France; María de Salinas; Holy Roman Emperor Charles V; Pope Paul III; and Protestant Reformers Martin Luther and William Tyndale.
==Banishment and death==
Upon returning to Dover from a meeting with King Francis I of France in Calais, Henry married Anne Boleyn in a secret ceremony. Some sources speculate that Anne was already pregnant at the time (and Henry did not want to risk a son being born illegitimate) but others testify that Anne (who had seen her sister Mary Boleyn taken up as the King&#x27;s mistress and summarily cast aside) refused to sleep with Henry until they were married. Henry defended the lawfulness of their union by pointing out that Catherine had previously been married. If she and Arthur had consummated their marriage, Henry by canon law had the right to remarry. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer, sitting in judgement at a special court convened at Dunstable Priory to rule on the validity of Henry&#x27;s marriage to Catherine, declared the marriage unlawful, even though Catherine had testified that she and Arthur had never had physical relations. Five days later, on 28 May 1533, Cranmer ruled that Henry and Anne&#x27;s marriage was valid.

Until the end of her life, Catherine would refer to herself as Henry&#x27;s only lawful wedded wife and England&#x27;s only rightful queen, and her servants continued to address her as such. Henry refused her the right to any title but &quot;Dowager Princess of Wales&quot; in recognition of her position as his brother&#x27;s widow.

Catherine went to live at The More Castle, Hertfordshire, late in 1531. After that, she was successively moved to the Royal Palace of Hatfield, Hertfordshire (May to September 1532), Elsyng Palace, Enfield (September 1532 to February 1533), Ampthill Castle, Bedfordshire (February to July 1533) and Buckden Towers, Cambridgeshire (July 1533 to May 1534). She was then finally transferred to Kimbolton Castle, Cambridgeshire where she confined herself to one room, which she left only to attend Mass, dressed only in the hair shirt of the Franciscans, and fasted continuously. While she was permitted to receive occasional visitors, she was forbidden to see her daughter Mary. They were also forbidden to communicate in writing, but sympathisers discreetly conveyed letters between the two. Henry offered both mother and daughter better quarters and permission to see each other if they would acknowledge Anne Boleyn as the new queen; both refused.

In late December 1535, sensing her death was near, Catherine made her will, and wrote to her nephew, the Emperor Charles V, asking him to protect her daughter. It has been claimed that she then penned one final letter to Henry:

The authenticity of the letter itself has been questioned, but not Catherine&#x27;s attitude in its wording, which has been reported with variations in different sources.

Catherine died at Kimbolton Castle on 1536. The following day, news of her death reached the King. At the time there were rumours that she was poisoned, possibly by Gregory di Casale. According to the chronicler Edward Hall, Anne Boleyn wore yellow for the mourning, which has been interpreted in various ways; Polydore Vergil interpreted this to mean that Anne did not mourn. Chapuys reported that it was King Henry who decked himself in yellow, celebrating the news and making a great show of his and Anne&#x27;s daughter, Elizabeth, to his courtiers. This was seen as distasteful and vulgar by many. Another theory is that the dressing in yellow was out of respect for Catherine as yellow was said to be the Spanish colour of mourning. Certainly, later in the day it is reported that Henry and Anne both individually and privately wept for her death. On the day of Catherine&#x27;s funeral, Anne Boleyn miscarried a male child. Rumours then circulated that Catherine had been poisoned by Anne or Henry, or both. The rumours were born after the apparent discovery during her embalming that there was a black growth on her heart that might have been caused by poisoning. Modern medical experts are in agreement that her heart&#x27;s discolouration was due not to poisoning, but to cancer, something which was not understood at the time.

Catherine was buried in Peterborough Cathedral with the ceremony due to her position as a Dowager Princess of Wales, and not a queen. Henry did not attend the funeral and forbade Mary to attend.

==Faith==
Catherine was a member of the Third Order of Saint Francis and she was punctilious in her religious obligations in the Order, integrating without demur her necessary duties as queen with her personal piety. After the annulment, she was quoted &quot;I would rather be a poor beggar&#x27;s wife and be sure of heaven, than queen of all the world and stand in doubt thereof by reason of my own consent.&quot;

The outward celebration of saints and holy relics formed no major part of her personal devotions, which she rather expressed in the Mass, prayer, confession and penance. Privately, however, she was aware of what she identified as the shortcomings of the papacy and church officialdom. Her doubts about church improprieties certainly did not extend so far as to support the allegations of corruption made public by Martin Luther in Wittenberg in 1517, which were soon to have such far-reaching consequences in initiating the Protestant Reformation.

In 1523 Alfonso de Villa Sancta, a learned friar of the Observant (reform) branch of the Friars Minor and friend of the King&#x27;s old advisor Erasmus, dedicated to the queen his book &quot;De Liberio Arbitrio adversus Melanchthonem&quot;. The book denounced Philip Melanchthon, a supporter of Luther. Acting as her confessor, he was able to nominate her for the title of &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot; for denying Luther&#x27;s arguments.

==Appearance==
In her youth, Catherine was described as &quot;the most beautiful creature in the world&quot; and that there was &quot;nothing lacking in her that the most beautiful girl should have&quot;. Thomas More and Lord Herbert would reflect later in her lifetime that in regard to her appearance &quot;there were few women who could compete with the Queen [Catherine] in her prime.&quot;

==Legacy, memory and historiography==
The controversial book &quot;The Education of a Christian Woman&quot; by Juan Luis Vives, which claimed women have the right to an education, was dedicated to and commissioned by her. Such was Catherine&#x27;s impression on people, that even her enemy, Thomas Cromwell, said of her &quot;If not for her sex, she could have defied all the heroes of History.&quot; She successfully appealed for the lives of the rebels involved in the Evil May Day for the sake of their families. Furthermore, Catherine won widespread admiration by starting an extensive programme for the relief of the poor. She was also a patron of Renaissance humanism, and a friend of the great scholars Erasmus of Rotterdam and Saint Thomas More. Some saw her as a martyr.

In the reign of her daughter Mary I of England, her marriage to Henry VIII was declared &quot;good and valid&quot;. Her daughter Queen Mary also had several portraits commissioned of Catherine, and it would not by any means be the last time she was painted. After her death, numerous portraits were painted of her, particularly of her speech at the Legatine Trial, a moment accurately rendered in Shakespeare&#x27;s play about Henry VIII.

Her tomb in Peterborough Cathedral can be seen and there is hardly ever a time when it is not decorated with flowers or pomegranates, her heraldic symbol. It bears the title &quot;Katharine Queen of England&quot;.

In the 20th century, George V&#x27;s wife, Mary of Teck, had her grave upgraded and there are now banners there denoting Catherine as a queen of England. Every year at Peterborough Cathedral there is a service in her memory. There are processions, prayers and various events in the Cathedral including processions to Catherine&#x27;s grave in which candles, pomegranates, flowers and other offerings are placed on her grave. On the service commemorating the 470th anniversary of her death, the Spanish Ambassador to the United Kingdom attended. During the 2010 service a rendition of Catherine of Aragon&#x27;s speech before the Legatine court was read by Jane Lapotaire. There is a statue of her in her birthplace of Alcalá de Henares, as a young woman holding a book and a rose.

Catherine has remained a popular biographical subject to the present day. The American historian Garrett Mattingly was the author of a popular biography &quot;Katherine of Aragon&quot; in 1942. In 1966, Catherine and her many supporters at court were the subjects of &quot;Catherine of Aragon and her Friends&quot;, a biography by John E. Paul. In 1967, Mary M. Luke wrote the first book of her Tudor trilogy, &quot;Catherine the Queen&quot; which portrayed her and the tumultuous era of English history through which she lived.
 In recent years, the historian Alison Weir covered her life extensively in her biography &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot;, first published in 1991. Antonia Fraser did the same in her own 1992 biography of the same title; as did the British historian David Starkey in his 2003 book &quot;Six Wives: The Queens of Henry VIII&quot;. Giles Tremlett&#x27;s biography, &quot;Catherine of Aragon: The Spanish Queen of Henry VIII&quot;, came out in 2010, and Julia Fox&#x27;s dual biography, &quot;Sister Queens: The Noble, Tragic Lives of Katherine of Aragon and Juana, Queen of Castile&quot;, came out in 2011.

===Places and statues===
* In Alcalá de Henares, the place of Catherine&#x27;s birth, a statue of Catherine as a young woman holding a rose and a book can be seen in the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace.
* Peterborough is twinned with the Spanish city of Alcalá de Henares, located in the wider Community of Madrid. Children from schools in the two places have learned about each other as part of the twinning venture, and artists have even come over from Alcalá de Henares to paint Catherine&#x27;s tombstone.
* Many places in Ampthill are named after Catherine. Also in Ampthill there is a cross in Ampthill Great Park named &quot;Queen Catherine&#x27;s Cross&quot; in her honour. It is on the site of the castle where she was sent during her divorce from the King.
* Kimbolton School&#x27;s science and mathematics block is called the QKB, or Queen Katherine Building.

===Spelling of her name===

Her baptismal name was &quot;Catalina&quot;, but &quot;Katherine&quot; was soon the accepted form in England after her marriage to Arthur. Catherine herself signed her name &quot;Katherine&quot;, &quot;Katherina&quot;, &quot;Katharine&quot; and sometimes &quot;Katharina&quot;. In a letter to her, Arthur, her husband, addressed her as &quot;Princess Katerine&quot;. Her daughter Queen Mary I called her &quot;Quene Kateryn&quot;, in her will. Rarely were names, particularly first names, written in an exact manner during the sixteenth century and it is evident from Catherine&#x27;s own letters that different variations were used.
Loveknots built into his various palaces by her husband, Henry VIII, display the initials &quot;H &amp; K&quot;, as do other items belonging to Henry and Catherine, including gold goblets, a gold salt cellar, basins of gold, and candlesticks. Her tomb in Peterborough Cathedral is marked &quot;Katharine Queen of England&quot;.

<doc id="6943" wikidata="Q207340" url="?curid=6943" title="Cathode ray">
<text>Cathode rays or electron beams (e-beam) are streams of electrons observed in discharge tubes. If an evacuated glass tube is equipped with two electrodes and a voltage is applied, glass behind the positive electrode is observed to glow, due to electrons emitted from the cathode (the electrode connected to the negative terminal of the voltage supply). They were first observed in 1859 by German physicist Julius Plücker and Johann Wilhelm Hittorf, and were named in 1876 by Eugen Goldstein &quot;Kathodenstrahlen&quot;, or cathode rays. In 1897, British physicist J. J. Thomson showed that cathode rays were composed of a previously unknown negatively charged particle, which was later named the &quot;electron&quot;. Cathode-ray tubes (CRTs) use a focused beam of electrons deflected by electric or magnetic fields to render an image on a screen.

==Description==
Cathode rays are so named because they are emitted by the negative electrode, or cathode, in a vacuum tube. To release electrons into the tube, they first must be detached from the atoms of the cathode. In the early experimental cold cathode vacuum tubes in which cathode rays were discovered, called Crookes tubes, this was done by using a high electrical potential of thousands of volts between the anode and the cathode to ionize the residual gas atoms in the tube. The positive ions were accelerated by the electric field toward the cathode, and when they collided with it they knocked electrons out of its surface; these were the cathode rays. Modern vacuum tubes use thermionic emission, in which the cathode is made of a thin wire filament which is heated by a separate electric current passing through it. The increased random heat motion of the filament knocks electrons out of the surface of the filament, into the evacuated space of the tube.

Since the electrons have a negative charge, they are repelled by the negative cathode and attracted to the positive anode. They travel in parallel lines through the empty tube. The voltage applied between the electrodes accelerates these low mass particles to high velocities. Cathode rays are invisible, but their presence was first detected in these Crookes tubes when they struck the glass wall of the tube, exciting the atoms of the glass and causing them to emit light, a glow called fluorescence. Researchers noticed that objects placed in the tube in front of the cathode could cast a shadow on the glowing wall, and realized that something must be traveling in straight lines from the cathode. After the electrons strike the back of the tube they make their way to the anode, then travel through the anode wire through the power supply and back through the cathode wire to the cathode, so cathode rays carry electric current through the tube.

The current in a beam of cathode rays through a vacuum tube can be controlled by passing it through a metal screen of wires (a grid) between cathode and anode, to which a small negative voltage is applied. The electric field of the wires deflects some of the electrons, preventing them from reaching the anode. The amount of current that gets through to the anode depends on the voltage on the grid. Thus, a small voltage on the grid can be made to control a much larger voltage on the anode. This is the principle used in vacuum tubes to amplify electrical signals. The triode vacuum tube developed between 1907 and 1914 was the first electronic device that could amplify, and is still used in some applications such as radio transmitters. High speed beams of cathode rays can also be steered and manipulated by electric fields created by additional metal plates in the tube to which voltage is applied, or magnetic fields created by coils of wire (electromagnets). These are used in cathode-ray tubes, found in televisions and computer monitors, and in electron microscopes.

==History==
After the invention of the vacuum pump in 1654 by Otto von Guericke, physicists began to experiment with passing high voltage electricity through rarefied air. In 1705, it was noted that electrostatic generator sparks travel a longer distance through low pressure air than through atmospheric pressure air.

===Gas discharge tubes===

In 1838, Michael Faraday applied a high voltage between two metal electrodes at either end of a glass tube that had been partially evacuated of air, and noticed a strange light arc with its beginning at the cathode (negative electrode) and its end at the anode (positive electrode). In 1857, German physicist and glassblower Heinrich Geissler sucked even more air out with an improved pump, to a pressure of around 10−3 atm and found that, instead of an arc, a glow filled the tube. The voltage applied between the two electrodes of the tubes, generated by an induction coil, was anywhere between a few kilovolts and 100 kV. These were called Geissler tubes, similar to today&#x27;s neon signs.

The explanation of these effects was that the high voltage accelerated free electrons and electrically charged atoms (ions) naturally present in the air of the tube. At low pressure, there was enough space between the gas atoms that the electrons could accelerate to high enough speeds that when they struck an atom they knocked electrons off of it, creating more positive ions and free electrons, which went on to create more ions and electrons in a chain reaction, known as a glow discharge. The positive ions were attracted to the cathode and when they struck it knocked more electrons out of it, which were attracted toward the anode. Thus the ionized air was electrically conductive and an electric current flowed through the tube.

Geissler tubes had enough air in them that the electrons could only travel a tiny distance before colliding with an atom. The electrons in these tubes moved in a slow diffusion process, never gaining much speed, so these tubes didn&#x27;t produce cathode rays. Instead, they produced a colorful glow discharge (as in a modern neon light), caused when the electrons struck gas atoms, exciting their orbital electrons to higher energy levels. The electrons released this energy as light. This process is called fluorescence.

===Cathode rays===
By the 1870s, British physicist William Crookes and others were able to evacuate tubes to a lower pressure, below 10−6 atm. These were called Crookes tubes. Faraday had been the first to notice a dark space just in front of the cathode, where there was no luminescence. This came to be called the &quot;cathode dark space&quot;, &quot;Faraday dark space&quot; or &quot;Crookes dark space&quot;. Crookes found that as he pumped more air out of the tubes, the Faraday dark space spread down the tube from the cathode toward the anode, until the tube was totally dark. But at the anode (positive) end of the tube, the glass of the tube itself began to glow.

What was happening was that as more air was pumped from the tube, the electrons knocked out of the cathode when positive ions struck it could travel farther, on average, before they struck a gas atom. By the time the tube was dark, most of the electrons could travel in straight lines from the cathode to the anode end of the tube without a collision. With no obstructions, these low mass particles were accelerated to high velocities by the voltage between the electrodes. These were the cathode rays.

When they reached the anode end of the tube, they were traveling so fast that, although they were attracted to it, they often flew past the anode and struck the back wall of the tube. When they struck atoms in the glass wall, they excited their orbital electrons to higher energy levels. When the electrons returned to their original energy level, they released the energy as light, causing the glass to fluoresce, usually a greenish or bluish color. Later researchers painted the inside back wall with fluorescent chemicals such as zinc sulfide, to make the glow more visible.

Cathode rays themselves are invisible, but this accidental fluorescence allowed researchers to notice that objects in the tube in front of the cathode, such as the anode, cast sharp-edged shadows on the glowing back wall. In 1869, German physicist Johann Hittorf was first to realize that something must be traveling in straight lines from the cathode to cast the shadows. Eugen Goldstein named them &quot;cathode rays&quot; (German &quot;Kathodenstrahlen&quot;).

===Discovery of the electron===
At this time, atoms were the smallest particles known, and were believed to be indivisible. What carried electric currents was a mystery. During the last quarter of the 19th century, many historic experiments were done with Crookes tubes to determine what cathode rays were. There were two theories. Crookes and Arthur Schuster believed they were particles of &quot;radiant matter,&quot; that is, electrically charged atoms. German scientists Eilhard Wiedemann, Heinrich Hertz and Goldstein believed they were &quot;aether waves&quot;, some new form of electromagnetic radiation, and were separate from what carried the electric current through the tube.

The debate was resolved in 1897 when J. J. Thomson measured the mass of cathode rays, showing they were made of particles, but were around 1800 times lighter than the lightest atom, hydrogen. Therefore, they were not atoms, but a new particle, the first &quot;subatomic&quot; particle to be discovered, which he originally called &quot;corpuscle&quot; but was later named &quot;electron&quot;, after particles postulated by George Johnstone Stoney in 1874. He also showed they were identical with particles given off by photoelectric and radioactive materials. It was quickly recognized that they are the particles that carry electric currents in metal wires, and carry the negative electric charge of the atom.

Thomson was given the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physics for this work. Philipp Lenard also contributed a great deal to cathode-ray theory, winning the Nobel Prize in 1905 for his research on cathode rays and their properties.

===Vacuum tubes===
The gas ionization (or cold cathode) method of producing cathode rays used in Crookes tubes was unreliable, because it depended on the pressure of the residual air in the tube. Over time, the air was absorbed by the walls of the tube, and it stopped working.

A more reliable and controllable method of producing cathode rays was investigated by Hittorf and Goldstein, and rediscovered by Thomas Edison in 1880. A cathode made of a wire filament heated red hot by a separate current passing through it would release electrons into the tube by a process called thermionic emission. The first true electronic vacuum tubes, invented in 1904 by John Ambrose Fleming, used this hot cathode technique, and they superseded Crookes tubes. These tubes didn&#x27;t need gas in them to work, so they were evacuated to a lower pressure, around 10−9 atm (10−4 Pa). The ionization method of creating cathode rays used in Crookes tubes is today only used in a few specialized gas discharge tubes such as krytrons.

In 1906, Lee De Forest found that a small voltage on a grid of metal wires between the cathode and anode could control a current in a beam of cathode rays passing through a vacuum tube. His invention, called the triode, was the first device that could amplify electric signals, and revolutionized electrical technology, creating the new field of &quot;electronics&quot;. Vacuum tubes made radio and television broadcasting possible, as well as radar, talking movies, audio recording, and long-distance telephone service, and were the foundation of consumer electronic devices until the 1960s, when the transistor brought the era of vacuum tubes to a close.

Cathode rays are now usually called electron beams. The technology of manipulating electron beams pioneered in these early tubes was applied practically in the design of vacuum tubes, particularly in the invention of the cathode-ray tube (CRT) by Ferdinand Braun in 1897, which was used in television sets and oscilloscopes. Today, electron beams are employed in sophisticated devices such as electron microscopes, electron beam lithography and particle accelerators.

==Properties==
Like a wave, cathode rays travel in straight lines, and produce a shadow when obstructed by objects. Ernest Rutherford demonstrated that rays could pass through thin metal foils, behavior expected of a particle. These conflicting properties caused disruptions when trying to classify it as a wave or particle. Crookes insisted it was a particle, while Hertz maintained it was a wave. The debate was resolved when an electric field was used to deflect the rays by J. J. Thomson. This was evidence that the beams were composed of particles because scientists knew it was impossible to deflect electromagnetic waves with an electric field. These can also create mechanical effects, fluorescence, etc.

Louis de Broglie later (1924) suggested in his doctoral dissertation that electrons are like photons and can act as waves. The wave-like behaviour of cathode rays was later directly demonstrated using reflection from a nickel surface by Davisson and Germer, and transmission through celluloid thin films and later metal films by George Paget Thomson and Alexander Reid in 1927. (Alexander Reid, who was Thomson&#x27;s graduate student, performed the first experiments but he died soon after in a motorcycle accident and is rarely mentioned.)

<doc id="6944" wikidata="Q175233" url="?curid=6944" title="Cathode">
<text>A cathode is the electrode from which a conventional current leaves a polarized electrical device such as a lead-acid battery. This definition can be recalled by using the mnemonic &quot;CCD&quot; for &quot;Cathode Current Departs&quot;. A conventional current describes the direction in which positive charges move. Electrons have a negative electrical charge, so the movement of electrons is opposite to that of the conventional current flow. Consequently, the mnemonic &quot;cathode current departs&quot; also means that electrons flow &quot;into&quot; the device&#x27;s cathode from the external circuit. For example, the end of a household battery marked with a + (plus) is the cathode.

The electrode through which conventional current flows the other way, into the device, is termed an anode.

==Charge flow==
Conventional current flows from cathode to anode outside the cell or device (with electrons moving in the opposite direction), regardless of the cell or device type and operating mode.

Cathode polarity with respect to the anode can be positive or negative depending on how the device is being operated. Inside a device or a cell, positively charged cations always move towards the cathode and negatively charged anions move towards the anode, although cathode polarity depends on the device type, and can even vary according to the operating mode. Whether the cathode is negatively polarized (such as recharging a battery) or positively polarized (such as a battery in use), the cathode will draw electrons into it from outside, as well as attract positively charged cations from inside.

A battery or galvanic cell in use has a cathode that is the positive terminal since that is where conventional current flows out of the device. This outward current is carried internally by positive ions moving from the electrolyte to the positive cathode (chemical energy is responsible for this &quot;uphill&quot; motion). It is continued externally by electrons moving into the battery which constitutes positive current flowing outwards. For example, the Daniell galvanic cell&#x27;s copper electrode is the positive terminal and the cathode.

A battery that is recharging or an electrolytic cell performing electrolysis has its cathode as the negative terminal, from which current exits the device and returns to the external generator as charge enters the battery/ cell. For example, reversing the current direction in a Daniell galvanic cell converts it into an electrolytic cell where the copper electrode is the positive terminal and also the anode.

In a diode, the cathode is the negative terminal at the pointed end of the arrow symbol, where current flows out of the device. Note: electrode naming for diodes is always based on the direction of the forward current (that of the arrow, in which the current flows &quot;most easily&quot;), even for types such as Zener diodes or solar cells where the current of interest is the reverse current. In vacuum tubes (including cathode-ray tubes) it is the negative terminal where electrons enter the device from the external circuit and proceed into the tube&#x27;s near-vacuum, constituting a positive current flowing out of the device.

==Etymology==
The word was coined in 1834 from the Greek κάθοδος (&quot;kathodos&quot;), &#x27;descent&#x27; or &#x27;way down&#x27;, by William Whewell, who had been consulted by Michael Faraday over some new names needed to complete a paper on the recently discovered process of electrolysis. In that paper Faraday explained that when an electrolytic cell is oriented so that electric current traverses the &quot;decomposing body&quot; (electrolyte) in a direction &quot;from East to West, or, which will strengthen this help to the memory, that in which the sun appears to move&quot;, the cathode is where the current leaves the electrolyte, on the West side: &quot;&quot;kata&quot; downwards, &quot;&#x27;odos&quot; a way; the way which the sun sets&quot;.

The use of &#x27;West&#x27; to mean the &#x27;out&#x27; direction (actually &#x27;out&#x27; → &#x27;West&#x27; → &#x27;sunset&#x27; → &#x27;down&#x27;, i.e. &#x27;out of view&#x27;) may appear unnecessarily contrived. Previously, as related in the first reference cited above, Faraday had used the more straightforward term &quot;exode&quot; (the doorway where the current exits). His motivation for changing it to something meaning &#x27;the West electrode&#x27; (other candidates had been &quot;westode&quot;, &quot;occiode&quot; and &quot;dysiode&quot;) was to make it immune to a possible later change in the direction convention for current, whose exact nature was not known at the time. The reference he used to this effect was the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field direction, which at that time was believed to be invariant. He fundamentally defined his arbitrary orientation for the cell as being that in which the internal current would run parallel to and in the same direction as a hypothetical magnetizing current loop around the local line of latitude which would induce a magnetic dipole field oriented like the Earth&#x27;s. This made the internal current East to West as previously mentioned, but in the event of a later convention change it would have become West to East, so that the West electrode would not have been the &#x27;way out&#x27; any more. Therefore, &quot;exode&quot; would have become inappropriate, whereas &quot;cathode&quot; meaning &#x27;West electrode&#x27; would have remained correct with respect to the unchanged direction of the actual phenomenon underlying the current, then unknown but, he thought, unambiguously defined by the magnetic reference. In retrospect the name change was unfortunate, not only because the Greek roots alone do not reveal the cathode&#x27;s function any more, but more importantly because, as we now know, the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field direction on which the &quot;cathode&quot; term is based is subject to reversals whereas the current direction convention on which the &quot;exode&quot; term was based has no reason to change in the future.

Since the later discovery of the electron, an easier to remember, and more durably technically correct (although historically false), etymology has been suggested: cathode, from the Greek &quot;kathodos&quot;, &#x27;way down&#x27;, &#x27;the way (down) into the cell (or other device) for electrons&#x27;.

==In chemistry==
In chemistry, a cathode is the electrode of an electrochemical cell at which reduction occurs. The cathode can be negative like when the cell is electrolytic (where electrical energy provided to the cell is being used for decomposing chemical compounds); or positive as when the cell is galvanic (where chemical reactions are used for generating electrical energy). The cathode supplies electrons to the positively charged cations which flow to it from the electrolyte (even if the cell is galvanic, i.e., when the cathode is positive and therefore would be expected to repel the positively charged cations; this is due to electrode potential relative to the electrolyte solution being different for the anode and cathode metal/electrolyte systems in a galvanic cell).

The cathodic current, in electrochemistry, is the flow of electrons from the cathode interface to a species in solution. The anodic current is the flow of electrons into the anode from a species in solution.

===Electrolytic cell===
In an electrolytic cell, the cathode is where the negative polarity is applied to drive the cell. Common results of reduction at the cathode are hydrogen gas or pure metal from metal ions. When discussing the relative reducing power of two redox agents, the couple for generating the more reducing species is said to be more &quot;cathodic&quot; with respect to the more easily reduced reagent.

===Galvanic cell===
In a galvanic cell, the cathode is where the positive pole is connected to allow the circuit to be completed: as the anode of the galvanic cell gives off electrons, they return from the circuit into the cell through the cathode.

===Electroplating metal cathode (electrolysis)===
When metal ions are reduced from ionic solution, they form a pure metal surface on the cathode. Items to be plated with pure metal are attached to and become part of the cathode in the electrolytic solution.

==In electronics==
===Vacuum tubes===
In a vacuum tube or electronic vacuum system, the cathode is usually a metal surface with an oxide coating that much improves electron emission, heated by a filament, which emits free electrons into the evacuated space. In some cases the bare filament acts as the cathode. Since the electrons are attracted to the positive nuclei of the metal atoms, they normally stay inside the metal and require energy to leave it; this is called the &quot;work function&quot; of the metal. Cathodes are induced to emit electrons by several mechanisms:
* &quot;Thermionic emission&quot;: The cathode can be heated. The increased thermal motion of the metal atoms &quot;knocks&quot; electrons out of the surface, an effect called thermionic emission. This technique is used in most vacuum tubes.
* &quot;Field electron emission&quot;: A strong electric field can be applied to the surface by placing an electrode with a high positive voltage near the cathode. The positively charged electrode attracts the electrons, causing some electrons to leave the cathode&#x27;s surface. This process is used in cold cathodes in some electron microscopes, and in microelectronics fabrication,
* &quot;Secondary emission&quot;: An electron, atom or molecule colliding with the surface of the cathode with enough energy can knock electrons out of the surface. These electrons are called &quot;secondary electrons&quot;. This mechanism is used in gas-discharge lamps such as neon lamps.
* &quot;Photoelectric emission&quot;: Electrons can also be emitted from the electrodes of certain metals when light of frequency greater than the threshold frequency falls on it. This effect is called photoelectric emission, and the electrons produced are called &quot;photoelectrons&quot;. This effect is used in phototubes and image intensifier tubes.

Cathodes can be divided into two types:

====Hot cathode====


A hot cathode is a cathode that is heated by a filament to produce electrons by thermionic emission. The filament is a thin wire of a refractory metal like tungsten heated red-hot by an electric current passing through it. Before the advent of transistors in the 1960s, virtually all electronic equipment used hot-cathode vacuum tubes. Today hot cathodes are used in vacuum tubes in radio transmitters and microwave ovens, to produce the electron beams in older cathode-ray tube (CRT) type televisions and computer monitors, in x-ray generators, electron microscopes, and fluorescent tubes.

There are two types of hot cathodes:
* Directly heated cathode: In this type, the filament itself is the cathode and emits the electrons directly. Directly heated cathodes were used in the first vacuum tubes, but today they are only used in fluorescent tubes, some large transmitting vacuum tubes, and all X-ray tubes.
* Indirectly heated cathode: In this type, the filament is not the cathode but rather heats the cathode which then emits electrons. Indirectly heated cathodes are used in most devices today. For example, in most vacuum tubes the cathode is a nickel tube with the filament inside it, and the heat from the filament causes the outside surface of the tube to emit electrons. The filament of an indirectly heated cathode is usually called the &quot;heater&quot;. The main reason for using an indirectly heated cathode is to isolate the rest of the vacuum tube from the electric potential across the filament. Many vacuum tubes use alternating current to heat the filament. In a tube in which the filament itself was the cathode, the alternating electric field from the filament surface would affect the movement of the electrons and introduce hum into the tube output. It also allows the filaments in all the tubes in an electronic device to be tied together and supplied from the same current source, even though the cathodes they heat may be at different potentials.

In order to improve electron emission, cathodes are treated with chemicals, usually compounds of metals with a low work function. Treated cathodes require less surface area, lower temperatures and less power to supply the same cathode current. The untreated tungsten filaments used in early tubes (called &quot;bright emitters&quot;) had to be heated to , white-hot, to produce sufficient thermionic emission for use, while modern coated cathodes produce far more electrons at a given temperature so they only have to be heated to There are two main types of treated cathodes:
* Coated cathode – In these the cathode is covered with a coating of alkali metal oxides, often barium and strontium oxide. These are used in low-power tubes.
* Thoriated tungsten – In high-power tubes, ion bombardment can destroy the coating on a coated cathode. In these tubes a directly heated cathode consisting of a filament made of tungsten incorporating a small amount of thorium is used. The layer of thorium on the surface which reduces the work function of the cathode is continually replenished as it is lost by diffusion of thorium from the interior of the metal.

====Cold cathode====

This is a cathode that is not heated by a filament. They may emit electrons by field electron emission, and in gas-filled tubes by secondary emission. Some examples are electrodes in neon lights, cold-cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) used as backlights in laptops, thyratron tubes, and Crookes tubes. They do not necessarily operate at room temperature; in some devices the cathode is heated by the electron current flowing through it to a temperature at which thermionic emission occurs. For example, in some fluorescent tubes a momentary high voltage is applied to the electrodes to start the current through the tube; after starting the electrodes are heated enough by the current to keep emitting electrons to sustain the discharge.

Cold cathodes may also emit electrons by photoelectric emission. These are often called &quot;photocathodes&quot; and are used in phototubes used in scientific instruments and image intensifier tubes used in night vision goggles.

===Diodes===

In a semiconductor diode, the cathode is the N–doped layer of the p–n junction with a high density of free electrons due to doping, and an equal density of fixed positive charges, which are the dopants that have been thermally ionized. In the anode, the converse applies: It features a high density of free &quot;holes&quot; and consequently fixed negative dopants which have captured an electron (hence the origin of the holes).

When P and N-doped layers are created adjacent to each other, diffusion ensures that electrons flow from high to low density areas: That is, from the N to the P side. They leave behind the fixed positively charged dopants near the junction. Similarly, holes diffuse from P to N leaving behind fixed negative ionised dopants near the junction. These layers of fixed positive and negative charges are collectively known as the depletion layer because they are depleted of free electrons and holes. The depletion layer at the junction is at the origin of the diode&#x27;s rectifying properties. This is due to the resulting internal field and corresponding potential barrier which inhibit current flow in reverse applied bias which increases the internal depletion layer field. Conversely, they allow it in forwards applied bias where the applied bias reduces the built in potential barrier.

Electrons which diffuse from the cathode into the P-doped layer, or anode, become what are termed &quot;minority carriers&quot; and tend to recombine there with the majority carriers, which are holes, on a timescale characteristic of the material which is the p-type minority carrier lifetime. Similarly, holes diffusing into the N-doped layer become minority carriers and tend to recombine with electrons. In equilibrium, with no applied bias, thermally assisted diffusion of electrons and holes in opposite directions across the depletion layer ensure a zero net current with electrons flowing from cathode to anode and recombining, and holes flowing from anode to cathode across the junction or depletion layer and recombining.

Like a typical diode, there is a fixed anode and cathode in a Zener diode, but it will conduct current in the reverse direction (electrons flow from anode to cathode) if its breakdown voltage or &quot;Zener voltage&quot; is exceeded.

<doc id="6945" wikidata="Q355263" url="?curid=6945" title="Chrominance">
<text>Chrominance (&quot;chroma&quot; or &quot;C&quot; for short) is the signal used in video systems to convey the color information of the picture (see YUV color model), separately from the accompanying luma signal (or Y&#x27; for short). Chrominance is usually represented as two color-difference components: U = B′ − Y′ (blue − luma) and V = R′ − Y′ (red − luma). Each of these different components may have scale factors and offsets applied to it, as specified by the applicable video standard. 

In composite video signals, the U and V signals modulate a color subcarrier signal, and the result is referred to as the chrominance signal; the phase and amplitude of this modulated chrominance signal correspond approximately to the hue and saturation of the color. In digital-video and still-image color spaces such as Y′CbCr, the luma and chrominance components are digital sample values.

Separating RGB color signals into luma and chrominance allows the bandwidth of each to be determined separately. Typically, the chrominance bandwidth is reduced in analog composite video by reducing the bandwidth of a modulated color subcarrier, and in digital systems by chroma subsampling.

==History==
The idea of transmitting a color television signal with distinct luma and chrominance components originated with Georges Valensi, who patented the idea in 1938. Valensi&#x27;s patent application described:
The use of two channels, one transmitting the predominating color (signal T), and the other the mean brilliance (signal t) output from a single television transmitter to be received not only by color television receivers provided with the necessary more expensive equipment, but also by the ordinary type of television receiver which is more numerous and less expensive and which reproduces the pictures in black and white only.
Previous schemes for color television systems, which were incompatible with existing monochrome receivers, transmitted RGB signals in various ways.

==Television standards==
In analog television, chrominance is encoded into a video signal using a subcarrier frequency. Depending on the video standard, the chrominance subcarrier may be either quadrature-amplitude-modulated (NTSC and PAL) or frequency-modulated (SECAM).

In the PAL system, the color subcarrier is 4.43 MHz above the video carrier, while in the NTSC system it is 3.58 MHz above the video carrier. The NTSC and PAL standards are the most commonly used, although there are other video standards that employ different subcarrier frequencies. For example, PAL-M (Brazil) uses a 3.58 MHz subcarrier, and SECAM uses two different frequencies, 4.250 MHz and 4.40625 MHz above the video carrier.

The presence of chrominance in a video signal is indicated by a color burst signal transmitted on the back porch, just after horizontal synchronization and before each line of video starts. If the color burst signal were visible on a television screen, it would appear as a vertical strip of a very dark olive color. In NTSC and PAL, hue is represented by a phase shift of the chrominance signal relative to the color burst, while saturation is determined by the amplitude of the subcarrier. In SECAM (R′ − Y′) and (B′ − Y′) signals are transmitted alternately and phase does not matter.

Chrominance is represented by the U-V color plane in PAL and SECAM video signals, and by the I-Q color plane in NTSC.

==Digital systems==
Digital video and digital still photography systems sometimes use a luma/chroma decomposition for improved compression. For example, when an ordinary RGB digital image is compressed via the JPEG standard, the RGB color space is first converted (by a rotation matrix) to a YCbCr color space, because the three components in that space have less correlation redundancy and because the chrominance components can then be subsampled by a factor of 2 or 4 to further compress the image. On decompression, the Y′CbCr space is rotated back to RGB.

<text>A campus traditionally refers to the land and buildings of a college or university. This will often include libraries, lecture halls, student centers and, for residential universities, residence halls and dining halls.

By extension, a corporate campus is a collection of buildings and grounds that belong to a company, particularly in the technology sector. Examples include Bell Labs, the Googleplex and Apple Park.

==Etymology==
Campus comes from the , meaning &quot;field&quot;, and was first used in the academic sense at Princeton University in 1774. At Princeton, the word referred to a large open space on the college grounds; similarly at the University of South Carolina it was used by 1826 to describe the open square (of around 10 acres) between the college buildings. By the end of the 19th century, the term was used widely at US colleges to refer to the grounds of the college, but it was not until the 20th century that it expanded to include the buildings as well.

==History==
The tradition of a campus began with the medieval European universities where the students and teachers lived and worked together in a cloistered environment. The notion of the importance of the setting to academic life later migrated to America, and early colonial educational institutions were based on the Scottish and English collegiate system.

The campus evolved from the cloistered model in Europe to a diverse set of independent styles in the United States. Early colonial colleges were all built in proprietary styles, with some contained in single buildings, such as the campus of Princeton University or arranged in a version of the cloister reflecting American values, such as Harvard&#x27;s. Both the campus designs and the architecture of colleges throughout the country have evolved in response to trends in the broader world, with most representing several different contemporary and historical styles and arrangements.

In 1922, a lecture by Patrick Abercrombie at the British Town Planning Institute contrasted the American campus to the style of Oxbridge colleges, saying: &quot;generally with us the park-like garden and trees are to one side of the college buildings, in contrast with the formally enclosed quad with its clipt grass. In the Campus method the departments of the university are scattered about a park and are actually among the trees.&quot; However, he did also note that Trinity College Dublin had &quot;what is called elsewhere a Campus&quot; on its site in central Dublin, and that William Wilkins had &quot;attempt[ed] an English Campus&quot; on the site of Downing College, Cambridge.

The first true campus universities in Britain were not established until the late 1940s, with the University of Reading moving to its Whiteknights campus in 1947, University College Swansea (now Swansea University) moving to its Singleton Park campus in 1948 and the University College of North Staffordshire (now the University of Keele) being established on the Keele Hall estate in 1949.

==Uses==
===Office buildings===

In the early 1990s the term began to be used to describe a company&#x27;s office building complex, most notably when Apple&#x27;s Infinite Loop campus was first built, which at the time was exclusively for research and development. The Microsoft Campus in Redmond, Washington, is another example of this usage, although it was built in the 1980s, before the term was applied to company property. In the 21st century, hospitals and even airports sometimes use the term to describe the territory of their respective facilities.

===Universities===

The word &quot;campus&quot; has also been applied to European universities, although some such institutions (in particular, &quot;ancient&quot; universities such as Bologna, Padua, Oxford and Cambridge) are characterized by ownership of individual buildings in university town-like urban settings rather than sprawling park-like lawns in which buildings are placed.

==World Heritage campuses==

A number of university campuses or parts of campuses have been recognised as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO for their outstanding universal value. These include: 

* Botanical Garden, University of Padua, Italy – the world&#x27;s oldest botanical garden (inscribed 1997)
* Central University City Campus of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico (inscribed 2007)
* Durham Castle and Cathedral, UK – including University College, Durham (Durham Castle) and the historic centre of Durham University around Palace Green (inscribed 1986; modified 2008)
* Medina of Fez, Morocco – including the University of al-Qarawiyyin (inscribed 1981)
* Monticello and the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, USA – including the Rotunda and the historic centre of the university around the Lawn (inscribed 1987; modified 2015)
* University City of Caracas, Venezuela – the main campus of the Central University of Venezuela (inscribed 2000)
* University of Alcalá de Henares, Spain – the world&#x27;s first planned university city (inscribed 1998)
* University of Coimbra, Portugal (inscribed 2013; modified 2019)

<doc id="6948" wikidata="Q181947" url="?curid=6948" title="Crossbow">
<text>A crossbow is a ranged weapon using an elastic launching device consisting of a bow-like assembly called a &quot;prod&quot;, mounted horizontally on a main frame called a &quot;tiller&quot;, which is hand-held in a similar fashion to the stock of a long gun. Crossbows shoot arrow-like projectiles called &quot;bolts&quot; or &quot;quarrels&quot;. A person who shoots crossbow is called a &quot;crossbowman&quot;, an &quot;arbalister&quot; or an &quot;arbalist&quot; (after the arbalest, a European crossbow variant used during the 12th century).

Crossbows and bows use the same elastic launch principles, but differ in that an archer using a bow must draw-and-shoot in a quick and smooth motion with limited or no time for aiming, while a crossbow&#x27;s design allows it to be spanned and cocked ready for use at a later time and thus affording them unlimited time to aim. When shooting bows, the archer must fully perform the draw, holding the string and arrow using various techniques while pulling it back with arm and back muscles, and then either immediately shooting instinctively without a period of aiming, or holding that form while aiming. Both demand some physical strength to do so using bows suitable for warfare, though this is easier using lighter draw-weight hunting bows. As such, their accurate and sustained use in warfare takes much practice.

Crossbows avoid these potential problems by having trigger-released cocking mechanisms to maintain the tension on the string once it has been spanned – drawn – into its ready-to-shoot position, allowing these weapons to be carried cocked and ready and affording their users time to aim them. This also allows them to be readied by someone assisting their users, so multiple crossbows can be used one after the other while others reload and ready them. Crossbows are spanned into their cocked positions using a number of techniques and devices, some of which are mechanical and employ gear and pulley arrangements – levers, belt hooks, pulleys, windlasses and cranequins – to overcome very high draw weight. These potentially achieve better precision and enable their effective use by less familiarised and trained personnel, whereas the simple and composite warbows of, for example, the English and the steppe nomads require years of training, practice and familiarisation.

These advantages for the crossbow are somewhat offset by the longer time needed to reload a crossbow for further shots, with the crossbows with high draw weights requiring sophisticated systems of gears and pulleys to overcome their huge draw weights that are very slow and rather awkward to employ on the battlefield. Medieval crossbows were also very inefficient, with short shot stroke lengths from the string lock to the release point of their bolts, along with the slower speeds of their steel prods and heavy strings, despite their massive draw weights compared to bows, though modern materials and crossbow designs overcome these shortcomings.

The earliest known crossbows were made in the first millennium BC, as early as the 7th century BC in ancient China and as early as the 1st century AD in Greece (known as gastraphetes). Crossbows brought about a major shift in the role of projectile weaponry in wars, such as during Qin&#x27;s unification wars and later Han campaigns against northern nomads and western states. The medieval European crossbow was called by many names, including &quot;crossbow&quot; itself; most of these names derived from the word &quot;ballista&quot;, an ancient Greek torsion siege engine similar in appearance but different in design principle.

In modern times, firearms have largely supplanted bows and crossbows as weapons of war, but crossbows remain widely used for competitive shooting sports and hunting, and for relatively silent shooting.

== Terminology ==

A crossbowman is sometimes called an &quot;arbalist&quot;, or historically an &quot;.

&quot;Arrow&quot;, &quot;bolt&quot; and &quot;quarrel&quot; are all suitable terms for crossbow projectiles, as was &quot;&quot; historically.

The &quot;lath&quot;, also called the &quot;prod&quot;, is the bow of the crossbow. According to W. F. Peterson, &quot;prod&quot; came into usage in the 19th century as a result of mistranslating &quot;rodd&quot; in a 16th-century list of crossbow effects.

The &quot;stock&quot; (a modern term derived from the equivalent concept in firearms) is the wooden body on which the bow is mounted, although the medieval &quot;tiller&quot; is also used.

The &quot;lock&quot; refers to the release mechanism, including the string, sears, trigger lever, and housing.

==Construction==


A crossbow is essentially a bow mounted on an elongated frame (called a tiller or stock) with a built-in mechanism that holds the drawn bow string, as well as a trigger mechanism, which is used to release the string.

=== Chinese vertical trigger lock ===

The Chinese trigger was a mechanism typically composed of three cast bronze pieces housed inside a hollow bronze enclosure. The entire mechanism is then dropped into a carved slot within the tiller and secured together by two bronze rods. The string catch (nut) is shaped like a &quot;J&quot; because it usually has a tall erect rear spine that protrudes above the housing, which serves the function of both a cocking lever (by pushing the drawn string onto it) and a primitive rear sight. It is held stationary against tension by the second piece, which is shaped like a flattened &quot;C&quot; and acts as the sear. The sear cannot move as it is trapped by the third piece, i.e. the actual trigger blade, which hangs vertically below the enclosure and catches the sear via a notch. The two bearing surfaces between the three trigger pieces each offers a mechanical advantage, which allow for handling significant draw weights with a much smaller pull weight. During shooting, the user will hold the crossbow at eye level by a vertical handle and aim along the arrow using the sighting spine for elevation, similar to how a modern rifleman shoots with iron sights. When the trigger blade is pulled, its notch disengages from the sear and allows the latter to drop downwards, which in turn frees up the nuts to pivot forward and release the bowstring.

=== European rolling nut lock ===

The earliest European designs featured a transverse slot in the top surface of the frame, down into which the string was placed. To shoot this design, a vertical rod is thrust up through a hole in the bottom of the notch, forcing the string out. This rod is usually attached perpendicular to a rear-facing lever called a &quot;tickler&quot;. A later design implemented a rolling cylindrical pawl called a &quot;nut&quot; to retain the string. This nut has a perpendicular centre slot for the bolt, and an intersecting axial slot for the string, along with a lower face or slot against which the internal trigger sits. They often also have some form of strengthening internal &quot;sear&quot; or trigger face, usually of metal. These &quot;roller nuts&quot; were either free-floating in their close-fitting hole across the stock, tied in with a binding of sinew or other strong cording; or mounted on a metal axle or pins. Removable or integral plates of wood, ivory, or metal on the sides of the stock kept the nut in place laterally. Nuts were made of antler, bone, or metal. Bows could be kept taut and ready to shoot for some time with little physical straining, allowing crossbowmen to aim better without fatiguing.

=== Bow ===

Chinese crossbow bows were made of composite material from the start.

European crossbows from the 10th to 12th centuries used wood for the bow, also called the &quot;prod&quot; or &quot;lath&quot;, which tended to be ash or yew.

Composite bows started appearing in Europe during the 13th century and could be made from layers of different material, often wood, horn, and sinew glued together and bound with animal tendon. These composite bows made of several layers are much stronger and more efficient in releasing energy than simple wooden bows.

As steel became more widely available in Europe around the 14th century, steel prods came into use.

Traditionally, the prod was often lashed to the stock with rope, whipcord, or other strong cording. This is called the &quot;bridle&quot;.

=== Spanning mechanism ===

The Chinese used winches for large crossbows mounted on fortifications or wagons, known as &quot;bedded crossbows&quot; (床弩). Winches may have been used for handheld crossbows during the Han dynasty (202 BC – 9 AD, 25–220 AD), but there is only one known depiction of it. The 11th century Chinese military text &quot;Wujing Zongyao&quot; mentions types of crossbows using winch mechanisms, but it is not known if these were actually handheld crossbows or mounted crossbows. Another drawing method involved the shooters sitting on the ground, and using the combined strength of leg, waist, back and arm muscles to help span much heavier crossbows, which were aptly called &quot;waist-spun crossbows&quot; (腰張弩).

During the medieval era, both Chinese and European crossbows used stirrups as well as belt hooks. In the 13th century, European crossbows started using winches, and from the 14th century an assortment of spanning mechanisms such as winch pulleys, cord pulleys, gaffles (such as gaffe levers, goat&#x27;s foot levers, and rarer internal lever-action mechanisms), cranequins, and even screws.

=== Variants ===


The smallest crossbows are pistol crossbows. Others are simple long stocks with the crossbow mounted on them. These could be shot from under the arm. The next step in development was stocks of the shape that would later be used for firearms, which allowed better aiming. The arbalest was a heavy crossbow that required special systems for pulling the sinew via windlasses. For siege warfare, the size of crossbows was further increased to hurl large projectiles, such as rocks, at fortifications. The required crossbows needed a massive base frame and powerful windlass devices.

=== Projectiles ===
The arrow-like projectiles of a crossbow are called bolts or quarrels. These are usually much shorter than arrows but can be several times heavier. There is an optimum weight for bolts to achieve maximum kinetic energy, which varies depending on the strength and characteristics of the crossbow, but most could pass through common mail. Crossbow bolts can be fitted with a variety of heads, some with sickle-shaped heads to cut rope or rigging; but the most common today is a four-sided point called a quarrel. A highly specialized type of bolt is employed to collect blubber biopsy samples used in biology research.

Even relatively small differences in arrow weight can have a considerable impact on its flight trajectory and drop.

Bullet-shooting crossbows are modified crossbows that use bullets or stones as projectiles.

=== Accessories ===
The ancient Chinese crossbow often included a metal (i.e. bronze or steel) grid serving as iron sights. Modern crossbow sights often use similar technology to modern firearm sights, such as red dot sights and telescopic sights. Many crossbow scopes feature multiple crosshairs to compensate for the significant effects of gravity over different ranges. In most cases, a newly bought crossbow will need to be sighted for accurate shooting.

A major cause of the sound of shooting a crossbow is vibration of various components. Crossbow silencers are multiple components placed on high vibration parts, such as the string and limbs, to dampen vibration and suppress the sound of loosing the bolt.

== History ==
=== China ===

In terms of archaeological evidence, crossbow locks dated made of cast bronze have been found in China . They have also been found in Tombs 3 and 12 at Qufu, Shandong, previously the capital of Lu, and date to the 6th century BC. Bronze crossbow bolts dating from the mid-5th century BC have been found at a Chu burial site in Yutaishan, Jiangling County, Hubei Province. Other early finds of crossbows were discovered in Tomb 138 at Saobatang, Hunan Province, and date to the mid-4th century BC. It is possible that these early crossbows used spherical pellets for ammunition. A Western Han mathematician and music theorist, Jing Fang (78–37 BC), compared the moon to the shape of a round crossbow bullet. The &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; also mentions crossbow bullets.

The earliest Chinese documents mentioning a crossbow were texts from the 4th to 3rd centuries BC attributed to the followers of Mozi. This source refers to the use of a giant crossbow between the 6th and 5th centuries BC, corresponding to the late Spring and Autumn period. Sun Tzu&#x27;s &quot;The Art of War&quot; (first appearance dated between 500 BC to 300 BC) refers to the characteristics and use of crossbows in chapters 5 and 12 respectively, and compares a drawn crossbow to &quot;might&quot;. The &quot;Huainanzi&quot; advises its readers not to use crossbows in marshland where the surface is soft and it is hard to arm the crossbow with the foot. The &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, completed in 94 BC, mentions that Sun Bin defeated Pang Juan by ambushing him with a battalion of crossbowmen at the Battle of Maling in 342 BC. The &quot;Book of Han&quot;, finished 111 AD, lists two military treatises on crossbows.

Handheld crossbows with complex bronze trigger mechanisms have also been found with the Terracotta Army in the tomb of Qin Shi Huang (r. 221–210 BC) that are similar to specimens from the subsequent Han dynasty (202 BC–220 AD), while crossbowmen described in the Qin and Han dynasty learned drill formations, some were even mounted as charioteers and cavalry units, and Han dynasty writers attributed the success of numerous battles against the Xiongnu and Western Regions city-states to massed crossbow volleys. The bronze triggers were designed in such a way that they were able to store a large amount of energy within the bow when drawn but was easily shot with little resistance and recoil when the trigger was pulled. The trigger nut also had a long vertical spine that could be used like a primitive rear sight for elevation adjustment, which allowed precision shooting over longer distances. The Qin and Han dynasty-era crossbow was also an early example of a modular design, as the bronze trigger components were also mass-produced with relative precise tolerances so that the parts were interchangeable between different crossbows. The trigger mechanism from one crossbow can be installed into another simply by dropping into a tiller slot of the same specifications and secured with dowel pins. Some crossbow designs were also found to be fitted with bronze buttplates and trigger guard.

It is clear from surviving inventory lists in Gansu and Xinjiang that the crossbow was greatly favored by the Han dynasty. For example, in one batch of slips there are only two mentions of bows, but thirty mentions of crossbows. Crossbows were mass-produced in state armories with designs improving as time went on, such as the use of a mulberry wood stock and brass. Such crossbows during the Song Dynasty in 1068 AD could pierce a tree at 140 paces. Crossbows were used in numbers as large as 50,000 starting from the Qin dynasty and upwards of several hundred thousand during the Han. According to one authority, the crossbow had become &quot;nothing less than the standard weapon of the Han armies&quot;, by the second century BC. Han soldiers were required to arm a crossbow with a draw weight equivalent of to qualify as an entry-level crossbowman, while it was claimed that a few elite troops were capable of arming crossbows with a draw-weight in excess of by the hands-and-feet method.

After the Han dynasty, the crossbow lost favor during the Six Dynasties, until it experienced a mild resurgence during the Tang dynasty, under which the ideal expeditionary army of 20,000 included 2,200 archers and 2,000 crossbowmen. Li Jing and Li Quan prescribed 20 percent of the infantry to be armed with crossbows.

During the Song dynasty, the crossbow received a huge upsurge in military usage, and often overshadowed the bow 2 to 1 in numbers. During this time period, a stirrup was added for ease of loading. The Song government attempted to restrict the public use of crossbows and sought ways to keep both body armor and crossbows out of civilian ownership. Despite the ban on certain types of crossbows, the weapon experienced an upsurge in civilian usage as both a hunting weapon and pastime. The &quot;romantic young people from rich families, and others who had nothing particular to do&quot; formed crossbow-shooting clubs as a way to pass time.

Military crossbows were armed by treading, or basically placing the feet on the bow stave and drawing it using one&#x27;s arms and back muscles. During the Song dynasty, stirrups were added for ease of drawing and to mitigate damage to the bow. Alternatively, the bow could also be drawn by a belt claw attached to the waist, but this was done lying down, as was the case for all large crossbows. Winch-drawing was used for the large mounted crossbows as seen below, but evidence for its use in Chinese hand-crossbows is scant.

=== Southeast Asia ===

Around the third century BC, King An Dương of Âu Lạc (modern-day northern Vietnam) and (modern-day southern China) commissioned a man named Cao Lỗ (or Cao Thông) to construct a crossbow and christened it &quot;Saintly Crossbow of the Supernaturally Luminous Golden Claw&quot; &quot;(nỏ thần)&quot;, which could kill 300 men in one shot. According to historian Keith Taylor, the crossbow, along with the word for it, seems to have been introduced into China from Austroasiatic peoples in the south around the fourth century BC. However, this is contradicted by crossbow locks found in ancient Chinese Zhou dynasty tombs dating to the 600s BC.

In 315 AD, Nu Wen taught the Chams how to build fortifications and use crossbows. The Chams would later give the Chinese crossbows as presents on at least one occasion.

Crossbow technology for crossbows with more than one prod was transferred from the Chinese to Champa, which Champa used in its invasion of the Khmer Empire&#x27;s Angkor in 1177. When the Chams sacked Angkor they used the Chinese siege crossbow. The Chinese taught the Chams how to use crossbows and mounted archery Crossbows and archery in 1171. The Khmer also had double-bow crossbows mounted on elephants, which Michel Jacq-Hergoualc&#x27;h suggests were elements of Cham mercenaries in Jayavarman VII&#x27;s army.

The native Montagnards of Vietnam&#x27;s Central Highlands were also known to have used crossbows, as both a tool for hunting, and later an effective weapon against the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War. Montagnard fighters armed with crossbows proved a highly valuable asset to the US Special Forces operating in Vietnam, and it was not uncommon for the Green Berets to integrate Montagnard crossbowmen into their strike teams.

=== Ancient Greece ===
The earliest crossbow-like weapons in Europe probably emerged around the late 5th century BC when the &quot;gastraphetes&quot;, an ancient Greek crossbow, appeared. The name means &quot;belly-bow&quot;; the concave withdrawal rest at one end of the stock was placed against the belly of the operator, and he could press it to withdraw the slider before attaching a string to the trigger and loading the bolt; this could store more energy than Greek bows. The device was described by the Greek author Heron of Alexandria in his &quot;Belopoeica&quot; (&quot;On Catapult-making&quot;), which draws on an earlier account of his compatriot engineer Ctesibius (fl. 285–222 BC). According to Heron, the &quot;gastraphetes&quot; was the forerunner of the later catapult, which places its invention some unknown time prior to 399 BC. The &quot;gastraphetes&quot; was a crossbow mounted on a stock divided into a lower and upper section. The lower was a case fixed to the bow, and the upper was a slider which had the same dimensions as the case. It was used in the Siege of Motya in 397 BC. This was a key Carthaginian stronghold in Sicily, as described in the 1st century AD by Heron of Alexandria in his book &quot;Belopoeica&quot;.

A crossbow machine, the oxybeles was in use from 375 BC to around 340 BC, when the torsion principle replaced the tension crossbow mechanism. Other arrow-shooting machines such as the larger ballista and smaller scorpio from around 338 BC are torsion catapults and are not considered crossbows. Arrow-shooting machines (&quot;katapeltai&quot;) are briefly mentioned by Aeneas Tacticus in his treatise on siegecraft written around 350 BC. An Athenian inventory from 330 to 329 BC includes catapults bolts with heads and flights. Arrow-shooting machines in action are reported from Philip II&#x27;s siege of Perinthos in Thrace in 340 BC. At the same time, Greek fortifications began to feature high towers with shuttered windows in the top, presumably to house anti-personnel arrow shooters, as in Aigosthena.

=== Ancient Rome ===
The late 4th century author Vegetius, in his &quot;De Re Militari&quot;, describes &quot;arcubalistarii&quot; (crossbowmen) working together with archers and artillerymen. However it is disputed whether arcuballistas were crossbows or torsion-powered weapons. The idea that the arcuballista was a crossbow is due to Vegetius referring separately to it and the &quot;manuballista&quot;, which was torsion powered. Therefore, if the arcuballista was not like the manuballista, it may have been a crossbow. According to Vegetius these were well-known devices and hence he did not describe them in depth. Joseph Needham argues against the existence of Roman crossbowmen:

On the other hand Arrian&#x27;s earlier &quot;Ars Tactica&quot;, from about 136 AD, also mentions &#x27;missiles shot not from a bow but from a machine&#x27; and that this machine was used on horseback while in full gallop. It is presumed that this was a crossbow.

The only pictorial evidence of Roman arcuballistas comes from sculptural reliefs in Roman Gaul depicting them in hunting scenes. These are aesthetically similar to both the Greek and Chinese crossbow but it is not clear what kind of release mechanism they used. Archaeological evidence suggests they were similar to the rolling nut mechanism of medieval Europe.

=== Medieval Europe ===
There are essentially no references to the crossbow in Europe from the 5th until the 10th century. There is however a depiction of a crossbow as a hunting weapon on four Pictish stones from early medieval Scotland (6th to 9th centuries): St. Vigeans no. 1, Glenferness, Shandwick, and Meigle.

The crossbow reappeared again in 947 as a French weapon during the siege of Senlis and again in 984 at the siege of Verdun. Crossbows were used at the battle of Hastings in 1066, and by the 12th century they had become common battlefield weapons. The earliest extant European crossbow remains were found at Lake Paladru, dated to the 11th century.

The crossbow superseded hand bows in many European armies during the 12th century, except in England, where the longbow was more popular. Later crossbows (sometimes referred to as arbalests), utilizing all-steel prods, were able to achieve power close (and sometime superior) to longbows but were more expensive to produce and slower to reload because they required the aid of mechanical devices such as the cranequin or windlass to draw back their extremely heavy bows. Usually these could shoot only two bolts per minute versus twelve or more with a skilled archer, often necessitating the use of a pavise (shield) to protect the operator from enemy fire. Along with polearm weapons made from farming equipment, the crossbow was also a weapon of choice for insurgent peasants such as the Taborites. Genoese crossbowmen were famous mercenaries hired throughout medieval Europe, whilst the crossbow also played an important role in anti-personnel defense of ships.

Crossbows were eventually replaced in warfare by gunpowder weapons. Early hand cannons had slower rates of fire and much worse accuracy than contemporary crossbows, but the arquebus (which proliferated in the mid to late 15th century) matched crossbows&#x27; rate of fire while being far more powerful. The Battle of Cerignola in 1503 was won by Spain largely through the use of matchlock arquebuses, marking the first time a major battle had been won through the use of hand-held firearms. Later, similar competing tactics would feature harquebusiers or musketeers in formation with pikemen, pitted against cavalry firing pistols or carbines. While the military crossbow had largely been supplanted by firearms on the battlefield by 1525, the sporting crossbow in various forms remained a popular hunting weapon in Europe until the eighteenth century. The accuracy of late 15th century crossbows compares well with modern handguns, based on records of shooting competitions in German cities. Crossbows saw irregular use throughout the rest of the 16th century; for example, Maria Pita&#x27;s husband was killed by a crossbowman of the English Armada in 1589.

=== Islamic world ===

There are no references to crossbows in Islamic texts earlier than the 14th century. Arabs in general were averse to the crossbow and considered it a foreign weapon. They called it &quot;qaus al-rijl&quot; (foot-drawn bow), &quot;qaus al-zanbūrak&quot; (bolt bow) and &quot;qaus al-faranjīyah&quot; (Frankish bow). Although Muslims did have crossbows, there seems to be a split between eastern and western types. Muslims in Spain used the typical European trigger, while eastern Muslim crossbows had a more complex trigger mechanism.

Mamluk cavalry used crossbows.

=== Elsewhere and later ===

Oyumi were ancient Japanese artillery pieces that first appeared in the seventh century (during the Asuka period). According to Japanese records, the Oyumi was different from the handheld crossbow also in use during the same time period. A quote from a seventh-century source seems to suggest that the Oyumi may have able to fire multiple arrows at once: &quot;the Oyumi were lined up and fired at random, the arrows fell like rain&quot;. A ninth-century Japanese artisan named Shimaki no Fubito claimed to have improved on a version of the weapon used by the Chinese; his version could rotate and fire projectiles in multiple directions. The last recorded use of the Oyumi was in 1189.

In West and Central Africa, crossbows served as a scouting weapon and for hunting, with African slaves bringing this technology to natives in America. In the Southern United States, the crossbow was used for hunting and warfare when firearms or gunpowder were unavailable because of economic hardships or isolation. In the north of Northern America, light hunting crossbows were traditionally used by the Inuit. These are technologically similar to the African-derived crossbows, but have a different route of influence.

Spanish conquistadors continued to use crossbows in the Americas long after they were replaced in European battlefields by firearms. Only in the 1570s, did firearms become completely dominant among the Spanish in the Americas.

The French and the British used a crossbow-like Sauterelle (French for grasshopper) in World War I. It was lighter and more portable than the Leach Trench Catapult, but less powerful. It weighed and could throw an F1 grenade or Mills bomb . The Sauterelle replaced the Leach Catapult in British service and was in turn replaced in 1916 by the 2-inch Medium Trench Mortar and Stokes mortar. Early in the war, actual crossbows were pressed into service in small numbers by both French and German troops to launch grenades.

A range of crossbows were developed by the Allied powers during the Second World War for assassinations and covert operations, but none appear to have ever been used in the field. A small number of crossbows were built and used by Australian forces in the New Guinea campaign.

== Modern use ==
=== Hunting, leisure, and science ===
Crossbows are used for shooting sports and bowhunting in modern archery and for blubber biopsy samples in scientific research. In some countries such as Canada, they may be less heavily regulated than firearms, and thus more popular for hunting; some jurisdictions have bow and/or crossbow only seasons.

=== Military and paramilitary ===

Crossbows are no longer used in battles, but they are still used in some military applications. For example, there is an undated photograph of Peruvian soldiers equipped with crossbows and rope to establish a zip-line in difficult terrain. In Brazil, the CIGS (Jungle Warfare Training Center) also trains soldiers in the use of crossbows.

In the United States, SAA International Ltd manufacture a crossbow-launched version of the U.S. Army type classified Launched Grapnel Hook (LGH), among other mine countermeasure solutions designed for the Middle Eastern theatre. It was evaluated as successful in Cambodia and Bosnia. It is used to probe for and detonate tripwire-initiated mines and booby traps at up to . The concept is similar to the LGH device originally fired from a rifle, as a plastic retrieval line is attached. Reusable up to 20 times, the line can be reeled back in without exposing the user. The device is of particular use in tactical situations where noise discipline is important.

In Europe, Barnett International sold crossbows to Serbian forces which, according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, were later used &quot;in ambushes and as a counter-sniper weapon&quot; against the Kosovo Liberation Army during the Kosovo War in the areas of Pec and Djakovica, south west of Kosovo. Whitehall launched an investigation, though the Department of Trade and Industry established that not being &quot;on the military list&quot;, crossbows were not covered by export restrictions. Paul Beaver of Jane&#x27;s Defence Publications commented that, &quot;They are not only a silent killer, they also have a psychological effect&quot;. On 15 February 2008, Serbian Minister of Defence Dragan Sutanovac was pictured testing a Barnett crossbow during a public exercise of the Serbian Army&#x27;s Special Forces in Nis, south of Belgrade. Special forces in both Greece and Turkey also continue to employ the crossbow. Spain&#x27;s Green Berets still use the crossbow as well.

In Asia, some Chinese armed forces use crossbows, including the special force Snow Leopard Commando Unit of the People&#x27;s Armed Police and the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. One reason for this is the crossbow&#x27;s ability to stop persons carrying explosives without risk of causing detonation. During the Xinjiang riots of July 2009, Crossbows were used by security forces to suppress rioters. The Indian Navy&#x27;s Marine Commando Force were equipped until the late 1980s with crossbows with cyanide-tipped bolts, as an alternative to suppressed handguns.

== Comparison to conventional bows ==

With a crossbow, archers could release a draw force far in excess of what they could have handled with a bow. Furthermore, the crossbow could hold the tension indefinitely, whereas even the strongest longbowman could only hold a drawn bow for a short time. The ease of use of a crossbow allows it to be used effectively with little training, while other types of bows take far more skill to shoot accurately. The disadvantage is the greater weight and clumsiness to reload compared to a bow, as well as the slower rate of shooting and the lower efficiency of the acceleration system, but there would be reduced elastic hysteresis, making the crossbow a more accurate weapon.

Medieval European crossbows had a much smaller draw length than bows, so that for the same energy to be imparted to the projectile the crossbow had to have a much higher draw weight.

A direct comparison between a fast hand-drawn replica crossbow and a longbow shows a 6:10 rate of shooting or a 4:9 rate within 30 seconds and comparable weapons.

== Legislation ==

Today, the crossbow often has a complicated legal status due to the possibility of lethal use and its similarities to both firearms and bows. While some jurisdictions treat crossbows in the same way as firearms, many others do not require any sort of license to own a crossbow. The legality of using a crossbow for hunting varies widely in different jurisdictions.

<doc id="6949" wikidata="Q410412" url="?curid=6949" title="Carbamazepine">
<text>Carbamazepine, sold under the brand name Tegretol among others, is an anticonvulsant medication used in the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain. It is used as an adjunctive treatment in schizophrenia along with other medications and as a second-line agent in bipolar disorder. Carbamazepine appears to work as well as phenytoin and valproate for focal and generalized seizures. It is not effective for absence or myoclonic seizures.
Carbamazepine was discovered in 1953 by Swiss chemist Walter Schindler. It was first marketed in 1962. It is available as a generic medication. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2020, it was the 185th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2million prescriptions.

Photoswitchable analogues of carbamazepine have been developed to control its pharmacological activity locally and on demand using light (photopharmacology), with the purpose of reducing the adverse systemic effects of the drug. One of these light-regulated compounds (carbadiazocine, based on a bridged azobenzene or ) has been shown to produce analgesia with noninvasive illumination &quot;in vivo&quot; in a rat model of neuropathic pain.

== Medical uses ==

Carbamazepine is typically used for the treatment of seizure disorders and neuropathic pain. It is used off-label as a second-line treatment for bipolar disorder and in combination with an antipsychotic in some cases of schizophrenia when treatment with a conventional antipsychotic alone has failed. However, evidence does not support its usage for schizophrenia. It is not effective for absence seizures or myoclonic seizures. Although carbamazepine may have a similar effectiveness (as measured by people continuing to use a medication) and efficacy (as measured by the medicine reducing seizure recurrence and improving remission) when compared to phenytoin and valproate, choice of medication should be evaluated on an individual basis as further research is needed to determine which medication is most helpful for people with newly-onset seizures.

In the United States, carbamazepine is indicated for the treatment of epilepsy (including partial seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures and mixed seizures), and trigeminal neuralgia. Carbamazepine is the only medication that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia.

As of 2014, a controlled release formulation was available for which there is tentative evidence showing fewer side effects and unclear evidence with regard to whether there is a difference in efficacy.

It has also been shown to improve symptoms of &quot;typewriter tinnitus&quot;, a type of tinnitus caused by the neurovascular compression of the cochleovestibular nerve. 

== Adverse effects ==
In the US, the label for carbamazepine contains warnings concerning:
* effects on the body&#x27;s production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets: rarely, there are major effects of aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis reported and more commonly, there are minor changes such as decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, but these do not progress to more serious problems.
* increased risks of suicide
* increased risks of hyponatremia and SIADH
* risk of seizures, if the person stops taking the drug abruptly
* risks to the fetus in women who are pregnant, specifically congenital malformations like spina bifida, and developmental disorders.
* Pancreatitis
* Hepatitis
* Dizziness
* Bone marrow suppression
* Stevens–Johnson syndrome

Common adverse effects may include drowsiness, dizziness, headaches and migraines, ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and/or constipation. Alcohol use while taking carbamazepine may lead to enhanced depression of the central nervous system. Less common side effects may include increased risk of seizures in people with mixed seizure disorders, abnormal heart rhythms, blurry or double vision. Also, rare case reports of an auditory side effect have been made, whereby patients perceive sounds about a semitone lower than previously; this unusual side effect is usually not noticed by most people, and disappears after the person stops taking carbamazepine.

=== Pharmacogenetics ===
Serious skin reactions such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) due to carbamazepine therapy are more common in people with a particular human leukocyte antigen gene-variant (allele), HLA-B*1502. Odds ratios for the development of SJS or TEN in people who carry the allele can be in the double, triple or even quadruple digits, depending on the population studied. HLA-B*1502 occurs almost exclusively in people with ancestry across broad areas of Asia, but has a very low or absent frequency in European, Japanese, Korean and African populations. However, the HLA-A*31:01 allele has been shown to be a strong predictor of both mild and severe adverse reactions, such as the DRESS form of severe cutaneous reactions, to carbamazepine among Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Europeans. It is suggested that carbamazepine acts as a potent antigen that binds to the antigen-presenting area of HLA-B*1502 alike, triggering an everlasting activation signal on immature CD8-T cells, thus resulting in widespread cytotoxic reactions like SJS/TEN.

== Interactions ==
Carbamazepine has a potential for drug interactions. Drugs that decrease breaking down of carbamazepine or otherwise increase its levels include erythromycin, cimetidine, propoxyphene, and calcium channel blockers. Grapefruit juice raises the bioavailability of carbamazepine by inhibiting the enzyme CYP3A4 in the gut wall and in the liver. Lower levels of carbamazepine are seen when administered with phenobarbital, phenytoin, or primidone, which can result in breakthrough seizure activity.

Valproic acid and valnoctamide both inhibit microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH), the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of the active metabolite carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide into inactive metabolites. By inhibiting mEH, valproic acid and valnoctamide cause a build-up of the active metabolite, prolonging the effects of carbamazepine and delaying its excretion.

Carbamazepine, as an inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes, may increase clearance of many drugs, decreasing their concentration in the blood to subtherapeutic levels and reducing their desired effects. Drugs that are more rapidly metabolized with carbamazepine include warfarin, lamotrigine, phenytoin, theophylline, valproic acid, many benzodiazepines, and methadone. Carbamazepine also increases the metabolism of the hormones in birth control pills and can reduce their effectiveness, potentially leading to unexpected pregnancies.

== Pharmacology ==
=== Mechanism of action ===
Carbamazepine is a sodium channel blocker. It binds preferentially to voltage-gated sodium channels in their inactive conformation, which prevents repetitive and sustained firing of an action potential. Carbamazepine has effects on serotonin systems but the relevance to its antiseizure effects is uncertain. There is evidence that it is a serotonin releasing agent and possibly even a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. It has been suggested that carbamazepine can also block voltage-gated calcium channels, which will reduce neurotransmitter release.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Carbamazepine is relatively slowly but practically completely absorbed after administration by mouth. Highest concentrations in the blood plasma are reached after 4 to 24 hours depending on the dosage form. Slow release tablets result in about 15% lower absorption and 25% lower peak plasma concentrations than ordinary tablets, as well as in less fluctuation of the concentration, but not in significantly lower minimum concentrations.

In the circulation, carbamazepine itself comprises 20 to 30% of total residues. The remainder is in the form of metabolites; 70 to 80% of residues is bound to plasma proteins. Concentrations in breast milk are 25 to 60% of those in the blood plasma.

Carbamazepine itself is not pharmacologically active. It is activated, mainly by CYP3A4, to carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, which is solely responsible for the drug&#x27;s anticonvulsant effects. The epoxide is then inactivated by microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) to carbamazepine-&quot;trans&quot;-10,11-diol and further to its glucuronides. Other metabolites include various hydroxyl derivatives and carbamazepine-&quot;N&quot;-glucuronide.

The plasma half-life is about 35 to 40 hours when carbamazepine is given as single dose, but it is a strong inducer of liver enzymes, and the plasma half-life shortens to about 12 to 17 hours when it is given repeatedly. The half-life can be further shortened to 9–10 hours by other enzyme inducers such as phenytoin or phenobarbital. About 70% are excreted via the urine, almost exclusively in form of its metabolites, and 30% via the faeces.

== History ==
Carbamazepine was discovered by chemist Walter Schindler at J.R. Geigy AG (now part of Novartis) in Basel, Switzerland, in 1953. It was first marketed as a drug to treat epilepsy in Switzerland in 1963 under the brand name Tegretol; its use for trigeminal neuralgia (formerly known as tic douloureux) was introduced at the same time. It has been used as an anticonvulsant and antiepileptic in the United Kingdom since 1965, and has been approved in the United States since 1968.

Carbamazepine was studied for bipolar disorder throughout the 1970s.

== Society and culture ==
=== Environmental impact ===
Carbamazepine and its bio-transformation products have been detected in wastewater treatment plant effluent and in streams receiving treated wastewater. Field and laboratory studies have been conducted to understand the accumulation of carbamazepine in food plants grown in soil treated with sludge, which vary with respect to the concentrations of carbamazepine present in sludge and in the concentrations of sludge in the soil. Taking into account only studies that used concentrations commonly found in the environment, a 2014 review concluded that &quot;the accumulation of carbamazepine into plants grown in soil amended with biosolids poses a &quot;de minimis&quot; risk to human health according to the approach.&quot;

=== Brand names ===
Carbamazepine is available worldwide under many brand names including Tegretol.

<doc id="6955" wikidata="Q2037472" url="?curid=6955" title="Chalcedonian Definition">
<text>The Chalcedonian Definition (also called the Chalcedonian Creed or the Definition of Chalcedon) is the declaration of the dyophysitism of Christ&#x27;s nature, adopted at the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451. Chalcedon was an early centre of Christianity located in Asia Minor. The council was the fourth of the ecumenical councils that are accepted by Chalcedonian churches which include the Catholic and Orthodox churches.
It was the first council not to be recognised by any Oriental Orthodox church; for this reason these churches may be classified as Non-Chalcedonian.

==Context==
The Council of Chalcedon was summoned to consider the Christological question in light of the &quot;one-nature&quot; view of Christ proposed by Eutyches, archimandrite at Constantinople, which prevailed at the Second Council of Ephesus in 449, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Robber Synod&quot;.

The Council first solemnly ratified the Nicene Creed adopted in 325 and that creed as amended by the First Council of Constantinople in 381. It also confirmed the authority of two synodical letters of Cyril of Alexandria and the letter of Pope Leo I to Flavian of Constantinople.

==Content==
The full text of the definition reaffirms the decisions of the Council of Ephesus, the pre-eminence of the Creed of Nicaea (325) and the further definitions of the Council of Constantinople (381).

In one of the translations into English, the key section, emphasizing the double nature of Christ (human and divine), runs:
The Definition implicitly addressed a number of popular heretical beliefs. The reference to &quot;co-essential with the Father&quot; was directed at Arianism; &quot;co-essential with us&quot; is directed at Apollinarianism; &quot;Two Natures unconfusedly, unchangeably&quot; refutes Eutychianism; and &quot;indivisibly, inseparably&quot; and &quot;Theotokos&quot; are against Nestorianism.

==Oriental Orthodox dissent==
The Chalcedonian Definition was written amid controversy between the Western and Eastern churches over the meaning of the Incarnation (see Christology). The Western church readily accepted the creed, but some Eastern churches did not. Political disturbances prevented the Armenian bishops from attending. Even though Chalcedon reaffirmed the Third Council&#x27;s condemnation of Nestorius, the Non-Chalcedonians always suspected that the Chalcedonian Definition tended towards Nestorianism. This was in part because of the restoration of a number of bishops deposed at the Second Council of Ephesus, bishops who had previously indicated what appeared to be support of Nestorian positions.

The Coptic Church of Alexandria dissented, holding to Cyril of Alexandria&#x27;s preferred formula for the oneness of Christ&#x27;s nature in the incarnation of God the Word as &quot;out of two natures&quot;. Cyril&#x27;s language is not consistent and he may have countenanced the view that it is possible to contemplate in theory two natures after the incarnation, but the Church of Alexandria felt that the Definition should have stated that Christ be acknowledged &quot;out of two natures&quot; rather than &quot;in two natures&quot;.

The definition defines that Christ is &quot;acknowledged in two natures&quot;, which &quot;come together into one person and one hypostasis&quot;. The formal definition of &quot;two natures&quot; in Christ was understood by the critics of the council at the time, and is understood by many historians and theologians today, to side with western and Antiochene Christology and to diverge from the teaching of Cyril of Alexandria, who always stressed that Christ is &quot;one&quot;. However, a modern analysis of the sources of the creed (by A. de Halleux, in &quot;Revue Theologique de Louvain&quot; 7, 1976) and a reading of the acts, or proceedings, of the council show that the bishops considered Cyril the great authority and that even the language of &quot;two natures&quot; derives from him.

This miaphysite position, historically characterised by Chalcedonian followers as &quot;monophysitism&quot;, though this is denied by the dissenters, formed the basis for the distinction of the Coptic Church of Egypt and Ethiopia and the &quot;Jacobite&quot; churches of Syria, and the Armenian Apostolic Church (see Oriental Orthodoxy) from other churches.

<text>In physics, a conservation law states that a particular measurable property of an isolated physical system does not change as the system evolves over time. Exact conservation laws include conservation of mass-energy, conservation of linear momentum, conservation of angular momentum, and conservation of electric charge. There are also many approximate conservation laws, which apply to such quantities as mass, parity, lepton number, baryon number, strangeness, hypercharge, etc. These quantities are conserved in certain classes of physics processes, but not in all.

A local conservation law is usually expressed mathematically as a continuity equation, a partial differential equation which gives a relation between the amount of the quantity and the &quot;transport&quot; of that quantity. It states that the amount of the conserved quantity at a point or within a volume can only change by the amount of the quantity which flows in or out of the volume.

From Noether&#x27;s theorem, every differentiable symmetry leads to a conservation law. Other conserved quantities can exist as well.

==Conservation laws as fundamental laws of nature==
Conservation laws are fundamental to our understanding of the physical world, in that they describe which processes can or cannot occur in nature. For example, the conservation law of energy states that the total quantity of energy in an isolated system does not change, though it may change form. In general, the total quantity of the property governed by that law remains unchanged during physical processes. With respect to classical physics, conservation laws include conservation of energy, mass (or matter), linear momentum, angular momentum, and electric charge. With respect to particle physics, particles cannot be created or destroyed except in pairs, where one is ordinary and the other is an antiparticle. With respect to symmetries and invariance principles, three special conservation laws have been described, associated with inversion or reversal of space, time, and charge.

Conservation laws are considered to be fundamental laws of nature, with broad application in physics, as well as in other fields such as chemistry, biology, geology, and engineering.

Most conservation laws are exact, or absolute, in the sense that they apply to all possible processes. Some conservation laws are partial, in that they hold for some processes but not for others.

One particularly important result concerning conservation laws is Noether&#x27;s theorem, which states that there is a one-to-one correspondence between each one of them and a differentiable symmetry of the Universe. For example, the conservation of energy follows from the uniformity of time and the conservation of angular momentum arises from the isotropy of space, i.e. because there is no preferred direction of space. Notably, there is no conservation law associated with time-reversal, although more complex conservation laws combining time-reversal with other symmetries are known.

==Exact laws==

A partial listing of physical conservation equations due to symmetry that are said to be exact laws, or more precisely &quot;have never been proven to be violated:&quot;
Another exact symmetry is CPT symmetry, the simultaneous inversion of space and time coordinates, together with swapping all particles with their antiparticles; however being a discrete symmetry Noether&#x27;s theorem does not apply to it. Accordingly, the conserved quantity, CPT parity, can usually not be meaningfully calculated or determined.

==Approximate laws==

There are also approximate conservation laws. These are approximately true in particular situations, such as low speeds, short time scales, or certain interactions.

* Conservation of mechanical energy
* Conservation of mass (approximately true for nonrelativistic speeds)
* Conservation of baryon number (See chiral anomaly and sphaleron)
* Conservation of lepton number (In the Standard Model)
* Conservation of flavor (violated by the weak interaction)
* Conservation of strangeness (violated by the weak interaction)
* Conservation of space-parity (violated by the weak interaction)
* Conservation of charge-parity (violated by the weak interaction)
* Conservation of time-parity (violated by the weak interaction)
* Conservation of CP parity (violated by the weak interaction); in the Standard Model, this is equivalent to conservation of time-parity.

==Global and local conservation laws==
The total amount of some conserved quantity in the universe could remain unchanged if an equal amount were to appear at one point &quot;A&quot; and simultaneously disappear from another separate point &quot;B&quot;. For example, an amount of energy could appear on Earth without changing the total amount in the Universe if the same amount of energy were to disappear from some other region of the Universe. This weak form of &quot;global&quot; conservation is really not a conservation law because it is not Lorentz invariant, so phenomena like the above do not occur in nature. Due to special relativity, if the appearance of the energy at &quot;A&quot; and disappearance of the energy at &quot;B&quot; are simultaneous in one inertial reference frame, they will not be simultaneous in other inertial reference frames moving with respect to the first. In a moving frame one will occur before the other; either the energy at &quot;A&quot; will appear &quot;before&quot; or &quot;after&quot; the energy at &quot;B&quot; disappears. In both cases, during the interval energy will not be conserved.

A stronger form of conservation law requires that, for the amount of a conserved quantity at a point to change, there must be a flow, or &quot;flux&quot; of the quantity into or out of the point. For example, the amount of electric charge at a point is never found to change without an electric current into or out of the point that carries the difference in charge. Since it only involves continuous &quot;local&quot; changes, this stronger type of conservation law is Lorentz invariant; a quantity conserved in one reference frame is conserved in all moving reference frames. This is called a &quot;local conservation&quot; law. Local conservation also implies global conservation; that the total amount of the conserved quantity in the Universe remains constant. All of the conservation laws listed above are local conservation laws. A local conservation law is expressed mathematically by a &quot;continuity equation&quot;, which states that the change in the quantity in a volume is equal to the total net &quot;flux&quot; of the quantity through the surface of the volume. The following sections discuss continuity equations in general.

==Differential forms==

In continuum mechanics, the most general form of an exact conservation law is given by a continuity equation. For example, conservation of electric charge is
formula_1
where is the divergence operator, is the density of (amount per unit volume), is the flux of (amount crossing a unit area in unit time), and is time.

If we assume that the motion u of the charge is a continuous function of position and time, then
formula_2

In one space dimension this can be put into the form of a homogeneous first-order quasilinear hyperbolic equation:
formula_3
where the dependent variable is called the &quot;density&quot; of a &quot;conserved quantity&quot;, and is called the &quot;current Jacobian&quot;, and the subscript notation for partial derivatives has been employed. The more general inhomogeneous case:
formula_4
is not a conservation equation but the general kind of balance equation describing a dissipative system. The dependent variable is called a &quot;nonconserved quantity&quot;, and the inhomogeneous term is the-&quot;source&quot;, or dissipation. For example, balance equations of this kind are the momentum and energy Navier-Stokes equations, or the entropy balance for a general isolated system.

In the one-dimensional space a conservation equation is a first-order quasilinear hyperbolic equation that can be put into the &quot;advection&quot; form:
formula_5
where the dependent variable is called the density of the &quot;conserved&quot; (scalar) quantity, and is called the current coefficient, usually corresponding to the partial derivative in the conserved quantity of a current density of the conserved quantity :
formula_6

In this case since the chain rule applies:
formula_7
the conservation equation can be put into the current density form:
formula_8

In a space with more than one dimension the former definition can be extended to an equation that can be put into the form:
formula_9

where the &quot;conserved quantity&quot; is , denotes the scalar product, is the nabla operator, here indicating a gradient, and is a vector of current coefficients, analogously corresponding to the divergence of a vector current density associated to the conserved quantity :
formula_10

This is the case for the continuity equation:
formula_11

Here the conserved quantity is the mass, with density and current density , identical to the momentum density, while is the flow velocity.

In the general case a conservation equation can be also a system of this kind of equations (a vector equation) in the form:
formula_12
where is called the &quot;conserved&quot; (vector) quantity, is its gradient, is the zero vector, and is called the Jacobian of the current density. In fact as in the former scalar case, also in the vector case A(y) usually corresponding to the Jacobian of a current density matrix :
formula_13
and the conservation equation can be put into the form:
formula_14

For example, this the case for Euler equations (fluid dynamics). In the simple incompressible case they are:
formula_15

where:
* is the flow velocity vector, with components in a N-dimensional space ,
* is the specific pressure (pressure per unit density) giving the source term,

It can be shown that the conserved (vector) quantity and the current density matrix for these equations are respectively:

formula_16

where formula_17 denotes the outer product.

==Integral and weak forms==
Conservation equations can usually also be expressed in integral form: the advantage of the latter is substantially that it requires less smoothness of the solution, which paves the way to weak form, extending the class of admissible solutions to include discontinuous solutions. By integrating in any space-time domain the current density form in 1-D space:
formula_18
and by using Green&#x27;s theorem, the integral form is:
formula_19

In a similar fashion, for the scalar multidimensional space, the integral form is:
formula_20
where the line integration is performed along the boundary of the domain, in an anticlockwise manner.

Moreover, by defining a test function &quot;φ&quot;(r,&quot;t&quot;) continuously differentiable both in time and space with compact support, the weak form can be obtained pivoting on the initial condition. In 1-D space it is:
formula_21

In the weak form all the partial derivatives of the density and current density have been passed on to the test function, which with the former hypothesis is sufficiently smooth to admit these derivatives.

<text>Car Talk is a metonym for the humorous work of &quot;Click and Clack, the Tappet Brothers&quot;, Tom and Ray Magliozzi on automobile repair. Originally, &quot;Car Talk&quot; was a radio show that ran on National Public Radio (NPR) from 1977 until October 2012, when the Magliozzi brothers retired. Since their retirement, the oeuvre now includes a website, and a podcast of reruns that is currently hosted by Apple Podcasts, NPR Podcasts, and Sticher. The &quot;Car Talk&quot; radio show was honored with a Peabody Award in 1992, and the Magliozzis were both inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2014 and the Automotive Hall of Fame in 2018.

==Premise==
&quot;Car Talk&quot; was presented in the form of a call-in radio show: listeners called in with questions related to motor vehicle maintenance and repair. Most of the advice sought was diagnostic, with callers describing symptoms and demonstrating sounds of an ailing vehicle while the Magliozzis made an attempt to identify the malfunction over the telephone and give advice on how to fix it. While the hosts peppered their call-in sessions with jokes directed at both the caller and at themselves, the Magliozzis were usually able to arrive at a diagnosis. However, when they were stumped, they attempted anyway with an answer they claimed was &quot;unencumbered by the thought process&quot;, the official motto of the show.

Edited reruns are carried on XM Satellite Radio (now Sirius XM) via both the Public Radio and NPR Now channels. 

The &quot;Car Talk&quot; theme music is &quot;Dawggy Mountain Breakdown&quot; by bluegrass artist David Grisman.

===Call-in procedure===
Throughout the program, listeners were encouraged to dial the toll-free telephone number, 1-888-CAR-TALK (1-888-227-8255), which connected to a 24-hour answering service. Although the approximately 2,000 queries received each week were screened by the &quot;Car Talk&quot; staff, the questions were unknown to the Magliozzis in advance as &quot;that would entail researching the right answer, which is what? ... Work.&quot;

=== Features===
The show originally consisted of two segments with a break in between but was changed to three segments. After the shift to the three-segment format, it became a running joke to refer to the last segment as &quot;the third half&quot; of the program.

The show opened with a short comedy segment, typically jokes sent in by listeners, followed by eight call-in sessions. The hosts ran a contest called the &quot;Puzzler&quot;, in which a riddle, sometimes car-related, was presented. The answer to the previous week&#x27;s &quot;Puzzler&quot; was given at the beginning of the &quot;second half&quot; of the show, and a new &quot;Puzzler&quot; was given at the start of the &quot;third half&quot;. The hosts gave instructions to listeners to write answers addressed to &quot;Puzzler Tower&quot; on some non-existent or expensive object, such as a &quot;$26 bill&quot; or an advanced digital SLR camera. This gag initially started as suggestions that the answers be written &quot;on the back of a $20 bill&quot;. A running gag concerned Tom&#x27;s inability to remember the previous week&#x27;s &quot;Puzzler&quot; without heavy prompting from Ray. During a tribute show following Tom&#x27;s death in 2014 due to complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Ray joked, &quot;I guess he wasn&#x27;t joking about not being able to remember the puzzler all those years.&quot; For each puzzler, one correct answer was chosen at random, with the winner receiving a $26 gift certificate to the &quot;Car Talk&quot; store, referred to as the &quot;Shameless Commerce Division&quot;. It was originally $25, but was increased for inflation after a few years. Originally, the winner received a specific item from the store, but it soon changed to a gift certificate to allow the winner to choose the item they wanted (though Tom often made an item suggestion).

A recurring feature was &quot;Stump the Chumps,&quot; in which the hosts revisited a caller from a previous show to determine the accuracy and the effect, if any, of their advice. A similar feature began in May 2001, &quot;Where Are They Now, Tommy?&quot; It began with a comical musical theme with a sputtering, backfiring car engine and a horn as a backdrop. Tom then announced who the previous caller was, followed by a short replay of the essence of the previous call, preceded and followed by harp music often used in other audiovisual media to indicate recalling and returning from a dream. The hosts then greeted the previous caller, confirmed that they had not spoken since their previous appearance and asked them if there had been any influences on the answer they were about to relate, such as arcane bribes by the NPR staff. The repair story was then discussed, followed by a fanfare and applause if the Tappet Brothers&#x27; diagnosis was correct, or a wah-wah-wah music piece mixed with a car starter operated by a weak battery (an engine which wouldn&#x27;t start) if the diagnosis was wrong. The hosts then thanked the caller for their return appearance.

The brothers also had an official Animal-Vehicle Biologist and Wildlife Guru named Kieran Lindsey. She answered questions like &quot;How do I remove a snake from my car?&quot; and offered advice on how those living in cities and suburbs could reconnect with wildlife. They also would sometimes rely on Harvard University professors Wolfgang Rueckner and Jim E. Davis for questions concerning physics and chemistry, respectively.

 There were numerous appearances from NPR personalities, including Bob Edwards, Susan Stamberg, Scott Simon, Ray Suarez, Will Shortz, Sylvia Poggioli, and commentator and author Daniel Pinkwater. On one occasion, the show featured Martha Stewart as an in-studio guest, whom the Magliozzis twice during the segment referred to as &quot;Margaret&quot;. Celebrities and public figures were featured as &quot;callers&quot; as well, including Geena Davis, Ashley Judd, Morley Safer, Gordon Elliott, former Major League Baseball pitcher Bill Lee, journalist Farhad Manjoo, and astronaut John M. Grunsfeld.

====Space program calls====
Astronaut and engineer John Grunsfeld called into the show during Space Shuttle mission STS-81 in January 1997, in which &quot;Atlantis&quot; docked to the Mir space station. In this call he complained about the performance of his serial-numbered, Rockwell-manufactured &quot;government van&quot;. To wit, it would run very loud and rough for about two minutes, quieter and smoother for another six and a half, and then the engine would stop with a jolt. He went on to state that the brakes of the vehicle, when applied, would glow red-hot, and that the vehicle&#x27;s odometer displayed &quot;about 60 million miles&quot;. This created some consternation for the hosts, until they noticed the audio of Grunsfeld&#x27;s voice, being relayed from Mir via TDRS satellite, sounded similar to that of Tom Hanks in the then-recent film Apollo 13, after which they realized the call was from space and the government van in question was, in fact, the Space Shuttle.

In addition to the on-orbit call, the Brothers once received a call asking advice on winterizing an electric car. When they asked what kind of car, the caller stated it was a &quot;kit car&quot;, a $400 million &quot;kit car&quot;. It was a joke call from NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory concerning the preparation of the Mars &quot;Opportunity&quot; rover for the oncoming Martian winter, during which temperatures drop to several hundred degrees below freezing.

Click and Clack have also been featured in editorial cartoons, including one where a befuddled NASA engineer called them to ask how to fix the Space Shuttle.

===Humor===
Humor and wisecracking pervaded the program. Tom and Ray are known for their self-deprecating humor, often joking about the supposedly poor quality of their advice and the show in general. They also commented at the end of each show: &quot;Well, it&#x27;s happened again—you&#x27;ve wasted another perfectly good hour listening to &quot;Car Talk&quot;.&quot;

The phrase &quot;our fair city&quot; was introduced during a puzzler segment on the radio show. Ray presented a puzzler involving a well-dressed man who referred to a city as &quot;your fair city.&quot; Tom found the phrase amusing and began using it humorously to refer to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where the show was based. This playful reference quickly became a running joke on the show, with the hosts frequently referring to Cambridge as &quot;our fair city&quot; in subsequent episodes. In another episode Ray mentioned Cambridge, Massachusetts, at which point Tom reverently interjected with a tone of civic pride, &quot;Our fair city&quot;. Ray invariably mocked Cambridge, MA&#x27;, the United States Postal Service&#x27;s two-letter abbreviation for &#x27;Massachusetts, by pronouncing the &quot;MA&quot; as a word.. This also became a running gag. 

Preceding each break in the show, one of the hosts led up to the network identification with a humorous take on a disgusted reaction of some usually famous person to hearing that identification. The full line went along the pattern of, for example, &quot;And even though Roger Clemens stabs his radio with a syringe whenever he hears &quot;us&quot; say it, this is NPR: National Public Radio&quot; (later just &quot;... this is NPR&quot;).

At one point in the show, often after the break, Ray usually stated that: &quot;Support for this show is provided by,&quot; followed by an absurd fundraiser.

The ending credits of the show started with thanks to the colorfully nicknamed actual staffers: producer Doug &quot;the subway fugitive, not a slave to fashion, bongo boy frogman&quot; Berman; &quot;John &#x27;Bugsy&#x27; Lawlor, just back from the ...&quot; every week a different eating event with rhyming foodstuff names; David &quot;Calves of Belleville&quot; Greene; Catherine &quot;Frau Blücher&quot; Fenollosa, whose name caused a horse to neigh and gallop (an allusion to a running gag in the movie &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot;); and Carly &quot;High Voltage&quot; Nix, among others. Following the real staff was a lengthy list of pun-filled fictional staffers and sponsors such as statistician Marge Innovera (&quot;margin of error&quot;), customer care representative Haywood Jabuzoff (&quot;Hey, would ya buzz off&quot;), meteorologist Claudio Vernight (&quot;cloudy overnight&quot;), optometric firm C. F. Eye Care (&quot;see if I care&quot;), Russian chauffeur Picov Andropov (&quot;pick up and drop off&quot;), Leo Tolstoy biographer Warren Peace (&quot;War and Peace&quot;), hygiene officer and chief of the Tokyo office Oteka Shawa (&quot;oh, take a shower&quot;), Swedish snowboard instructor Soren Derkeister (&quot;sore in the keister&quot;), law firm Dewey, Cheetham &amp; Howe (&quot;Do we cheat &#x27;em? And how!&quot;), Greek tailor Euripides Eumenades (&quot;You rip-a these, you mend-a these&quot;), cloakroom attendant Mahatma Coate (&quot;My hat, my coat&quot;), seat cushion tester Mike Easter (my keister) and many, many others, usually concluding with Erasmus B. Dragon (&quot;Her ass must be draggin), whose job title varied, but who was often said to be head of the show&#x27;s working mothers&#x27; support group. They sometimes advised that &quot;our chief counsel from the law firm of Dewey, Cheetham, &amp; Howe is Hugh Louis Dewey, known to a group of people in Harvard Square as Huey Louie Dewey.&quot; (Huey, Louie, and Dewey were the juvenile nephews being raised by Donald Duck in &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;.) Guest accommodations were provided by The Horseshoe Road Inn (&quot;the horse you rode in&quot;).

At the end of the show, Ray warns the audience, &quot;Don&#x27;t drive like my brother!&quot; to which Tom replies, &quot;And don&#x27;t drive like &quot;my&quot; brother!&quot; The original tag line was &quot;Don&#x27;t drive like a knucklehead!&quot; There were variations such as, &quot;Don&#x27;t drive like my brother ...&quot; &quot;And don&#x27;t drive like his brother!&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t drive like my sister ...&quot; &quot;And don&#x27;t drive like &quot;my&quot; sister!&quot; The tagline was heard in the Pixar film &quot;Cars&quot;, in which Tom and Ray voiced anthropomorphized vehicles (Rusty and Dusty Rust-eze, respectively a 1963 Dodge Dart and 1963 Dodge A100 van, as Lightning McQueen&#x27;s racing sponsors) with personalities similar to their own on-air personae. Tom notoriously once owned a &quot;convertible, green with large areas of rust!&quot; Dodge Dart, known jokingly on the program by the faux-elegant name &quot;Dartre&quot;.

==History==
In 1977, radio station WBUR-FM in Boston scheduled a panel of local car mechanics to discuss car repairs on one of its programs, but only Tom Magliozzi showed up. He did so well that he was asked to return as a guest, and he invited his younger brother Ray (who was actually more of a car repair expert) to join him. The brothers were soon asked to host their own radio show on WBUR, which they continued to do every week. In 1986, NPR decided to distribute their show nationally.

In 1989, the brothers started a newspaper column &quot;Click and Clack Talk Cars&quot; which, like the radio show, mixed serious advice with humor. King Features distributes the column. Ray Magliozzi continues to write the column, retitled &quot;Car Talk&quot;, after his brother&#x27;s death in 2014, knowing he would have wanted the advice and humor to continue.

In 1992, &quot;Car Talk&quot; won a Peabody Award, saying &quot;Each week, master mechanics Tom and Ray Magliozzi provide useful information about preserving and protecting our cars. But the real core of this program is what it tells us about human mechanics ... The insight and laughter provided by Messrs. Magliozzi, in conjunction with their producer Doug Berman, provide a weekly mental tune-up for a vast and ever-growing public radio audience.&quot;

In 2005, Tom and Ray Magliozzi founded the Car Talk Vehicle Donation Program, &quot;as a way to give back to the stations that were our friends and partners for decades — and whose programs we listen to every day.&quot; Since the Car Talk Vehicle Donation Program was founded, over 40,000 vehicles have been donated to support local NPR stations and programs, with over $40 million donated. Approximately 70% of the proceeds generated go directly toward funding local NPR affiliates and programs.

As of 2012, it had 3.3 million listeners each week, on about 660 stations. On June 8, 2012, the brothers announced that they would no longer broadcast new episodes as of October. Executive producer Doug Berman said the best material from 25 years of past shows would be used to put together &quot;repurposed&quot; shows for NPR to broadcast. Berman estimated the archives contain enough for eight years&#x27; worth of material before anything would have to be repeated. Ray Magliozzi, however, would occasionally record new taglines and sponsor announcements that were aired at the end of the show.

The show was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2014.

Ray Magliozzi hosted a special &quot;Car Talk&quot; memorial episode for his brother Tom after he died in November 2014.

The &quot;Best of Car Talk&quot; episodes ended their weekly broadcast on NPR on September 30, 2017, although past episodes would continue availability online and via podcasts. 120 of the 400 stations intended to continue airing the show. NPR announced one option for the time slot would be their new news-talk program &quot;It&#x27;s Been a Minute&quot;.

On June 11, 2021, it was announced that radio distribution of &quot;Car Talk&quot; would officially end on October 1, 2021, and that NPR would begin distribution of a twice-weekly podcast that will be 35–40 minutes in length and include early versions of every show, in sequential order.

==Hosts==
The Magliozzis were long-time auto mechanics. Ray Magliozzi has a Bachelor of Science degree in humanities and science from MIT, while Tom had a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from MIT, an MBA from Northeastern University, and a DBA from the Boston University School of Management.

The Magliozzis operated a do-it-yourself garage together in the 1970s which became more of a conventional repair shop in the 1980s. Ray continued to have a hand in the day-to-day operations of the shop for years, while his brother Tom semi-retired, often joking on &quot;Car Talk&quot; about his distaste for doing &quot;actual work&quot;. The show&#x27;s offices were located near their shop at the corner of JFK Street and Brattle Street in Harvard Square, marked as &quot;Dewey, Cheetham &amp; Howe&quot;, the imaginary law firm to which they referred on-air. DC&amp;H doubled as the business name of Tappet Brothers Associates, the corporation established to manage the business end of &quot;Car Talk&quot;. Initially a joke, the company was incorporated after the show expanded from a single station to national syndication.

The two were commencement speakers at MIT in 1999.

Executive producer Doug Berman said in 2012, &quot;The guys are culturally right up there with Mark Twain and the Marx Brothers. They will stand the test of time. People will still be enjoying them years from now. They&#x27;re that good.&quot;

Tom Magliozzi died on November 3, 2014, at age 77, due to complications from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==Adaptations==
The show was the inspiration for the short-lived &quot;The George Wendt Show&quot;, which briefly aired on CBS in the 1994–1995 season as a mid-season replacement.

In July 2007, PBS announced that it had green-lit an animated adaptation of &quot;Car Talk&quot;, to air on prime-time in 2008. The show, titled &quot;Click and Clack&#x27;s As the Wrench Turns&quot;, is based on the adventures of the fictional &quot;Click and Clack&quot; brothers&#x27; garage at &quot;Car Talk Plaza&quot;. The ten episodes aired in July and August 2008.

&quot;Car Talk: The Musical!!!&quot; was written and directed by Wesley Savick, and composed by Michael Wartofsky. The adaptation was presented by Suffolk University, and opened on March 31, 2011, at the Modern Theatre in Boston, Massachusetts. The play was not officially endorsed by the Magliozzis, but they participated in the production, lending their voices to a central puppet character named &quot;The Wizard of Cahs&quot;.

<doc id="6962" wikidata="Q170531" url="?curid=6962" title="Council of Chalcedon">
<text>The Council of Chalcedon (; ) was the fourth ecumenical council of the Christian Church. It was convoked by the Roman emperor Marcian. The council convened in the city of Chalcedon, Bithynia (modern-day Kadıköy, Istanbul, Turkey) from 8 October to 1 November 451. The council was attended by over 520 bishops or their representatives, making it the largest and best-documented of the first seven ecumenical councils. The principal purpose of the council was to re-assert the teachings of the ecumenical Council of Ephesus against the teachings of Eutyches and Nestorius. Such doctrines viewed Christ&#x27;s divine and human natures as separate (Nestorianism) or viewed Christ as solely divine (monophysitism).

== Agenda ==

The ruling of the council stated:

Whilst this judgment marked a significant turning point in the Christological debates, it also generated heated disagreements between the council and the Oriental Orthodox Church, who did not agree with such conduct or proceedings. This disagreement would later inform the separation of the Oriental Orthodox Churches from the rest of Christianity, and led to the council being regarded as &quot;Chalcedon, the Ominous&quot;.

The council&#x27;s other responsibilities included addressing controversy, dealing with issues such as ecclesiastical discipline and jurisdiction, and approving statements of belief such as the Creed of Nicaea (325), the Creed of Constantinople (381, subsequently known as the Nicene Creed), two letters of St. Cyril of Alexandria against Nestorius, and the Tome of Pope Leo I. The Christology of the Church of the East may be called &quot;non-Ephesine&quot; for not accepting the Council of Ephesus, but did finally gather to ratify the Council of Chalcedon at the Synod of Mar Aba I in 544. Through the 1994 Common Christological Declaration between the Catholic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East, the Assyrian Church of the East and the Catholic Church each accepted and confessed the same doctrine of Christology.

==Background==
In 325, the first ecumenical council (First Council of Nicaea) determined that Jesus Christ was God, &quot;consubstantial&quot; with the Father, and rejected the Arian contention that Jesus was a created being. This was reaffirmed at the First Council of Constantinople (381) and the First Council of Ephesus (431).

===Eutychian controversy===

About two years after Cyril of Alexandria&#x27;s death in 444, an aged monk from Constantinople named Eutyches began teaching a subtle variation on the traditional Christology in an attempt to stop what he saw as a new outbreak of Nestorianism. He claimed to be a faithful follower of Cyril&#x27;s teaching, which was declared orthodox in the Union of 433.

Cyril had taught that &quot;There is only one &quot;physis&quot;, since it is the Incarnation, of God the Word.&quot; Cyril apparently thought that the Greek word &quot;physis&quot; meant approximately what the Latin word &quot;persona&quot; (person) means, while most Greek theologians would have interpreted that word to mean &quot;natura&quot; (nature). The energy and imprudence with which Eutyches asserted his opinions led to his being misunderstood. Thus, many believed that Eutyches was advocating Docetism, a sort of reversal of Arianism – where Arius had denied the consubstantial divinity of Jesus, Eutyches seemed to be denying that Jesus was fully human. Pope Leo I wrote that Eutyches&#x27; error seemed to be more from a lack of skill than from malice.

Eutyches had been accusing various personages of covert Nestorianism. In November 448, Flavian, Bishop of Constantinople held a local synod regarding a point of discipline connected with the province of Sardis. At the end of the session of this synod one of those inculpated, Eusebius, Bishop of Dorylaeum, brought a counter charge of heresy against the archimandrite. Eusebius demanded that Eutyches be removed from office. Flavian preferred that the bishop and the archimandrite sort out their differences, but as his suggestion went unheeded, Eutyches was summoned to clarify his position regarding the nature of Christ. Eventually Eutyches reluctantly appeared, but his position was considered to be theologically unsophisticated, and the synod finding his answers unresponsive condemned and exiled him. Flavian sent a full account to Pope Leo I. Although it had been accidentally delayed, Leo wrote a compendious explanation of the whole doctrine involved, and sent it to Flavian as a formal and authoritative decision of the question.

Eutyches appealed against the decision, labeling Flavian a Nestorian, and received the support of Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria. John Anthony McGuckin sees an &quot;innate rivalry&quot; between the Sees of Alexandria and Constantinople. Dioscurus, imitating his predecessors in assuming a primacy over Constantinople, held his own synod which annulled the sentence of Flavian, and absolved Eutyches.

===Latrocinium of Ephesus===
Through the influence of the court official Chrysaphius, godson of Eutyches, in 449, the competing claims between the Patriarchs of Constantinople and Alexandria led Emperor Theodosius II to call a council which was held in Ephesus in 449, with Dioscorus presiding.

Pope Leo sent four legates to represent him and expressed his regret that the shortness of the notice must prevent the presence of any other bishop of the West. He provided his legates, one of whom died en route, with a letter addressed to Flavian explaining Rome&#x27;s position in the controversy. Leo&#x27;s letter, now known as Leo&#x27;s Tome, confessed that Christ had two natures, and was not of or from two natures.

On August 8, 449 the Second Council of Ephesus began its first session. The Acts of the first session of this synod were read at the Council of Chalcedon, 451, and are thus preserved. The remainder of the Acts (the first session being wanting) are known through a Syriac translation by a Miaphysite monk, written in the year 535 and published from a manuscript in the British Museum. Nonetheless, there are somewhat different interpretations as to what actually transpired. The question before the council by order of the emperor was whether Flavian, in a synod held by him at Constantinople in November, 448, had justly deposed and excommunicated the Archimandrite Eutyches for refusing to admit two natures in Christ.

Dioscorus began the council by banning all members of the November 448 synod which had deposed Eutyches from sitting as judges. He then introduced Eutyches who publicly professed that while Christ had two natures before the incarnation, the two natures had merged to form a single nature after the incarnation. Of the 130 assembled bishops, 111 voted to rehabilitate Eutyches.

Throughout these proceedings, Hilary (one of the papal legates) repeatedly called for the reading of Leo&#x27;s Tome, but was ignored. The Eastern Orthodox Church has very different accounts of The Second Council of Ephesus. Pope Dioscorus requested deferring reading of Leo&#x27;s Tome, as it was not seen as necessary to start with, and could be read later. This was seen as a rebuke to the representatives from the Church of Rome not reading the Tome from the start.

Dioscorus then moved to depose Flavian of Constantinople and Eusebius of Dorylaeum on the grounds that they taught the Word had been made flesh and not just assumed flesh from the Virgin and that Christ had two natures. When Flavian and Hilary objected, Dioscorus called for a pro-monophysite mob to enter the church which assaulted Flavian as he clung to the altar. Flavian died three days later. Dioscorus then placed Eusebius of Dorylaeum under arrest and demanded the assembled bishops approve his actions. Fearing the mob, they all did. The papal legates refused to attend the second session at which several more orthodox bishops were deposed, including Ibas of Edessa, Irenaeus of Tyre, Domnus of Antioch, and Theodoret. Dioscorus then had Cyril of Alexandria&#x27;s Twelve Anathemas declared orthodox with the intent of condemning any confession other than one nature in Christ.

According to a letter to the Empress Pulcheria collected among the letters of Leo I, Hilary apologized for not delivering to her the pope&#x27;s letter after the synod, but owing to Dioscurus, who tried to hinder his going either to Rome or to Constantinople, he had great difficulty in making his escape in order to bring to the pontiff the news of the result of the council. Hilary, who later became pope and dedicated an oratory in the Lateran Basilica in thanks for his life, managed to escape from Constantinople and brought news of the council to Leo who immediately dubbed it a &quot;synod of robbers&quot;Latrociniumand refused to accept its pronouncements. The decisions of this council now threatened schism between the East and the West.

The claims that bishops being forced to approve actions, were challenged by Pope Dioscorus and the Egyptian Bishops at Chalcedon.

==Convocation and session==
The situation continued to deteriorate, with Leo demanding the convocation of a new council and Emperor Theodosius II refusing to budge, all the while appointing bishops in agreement with Dioscorus. All this changed dramatically with the Emperor&#x27;s death and the elevation of Marcian to the imperial throne. To resolve the simmering tensions, Marcian announced his intention to hold a new council to set aside the 449 Second Council of Ephesus which was named the &quot;Latrocinium&quot; or &quot;Robber Council&quot; by Pope Leo. Pulcheria, the sister of Theodosius, may have influenced this decision, or even made the convention of a council a requirement during her negotiations with Aspar, the magister militum, to marry Marcian.

Leo had pressed for it to take place in Italy, but Emperor Marcian instead called for it to convene at Chalcedon, because it was closer to Constantinople, and would thus allow him to respond quickly to any events along the Danube, which was being raided by the Huns under Attila.

The council opened on 8 October 451. Marcian had the bishops deposed by Dioscorus returned to their dioceses and had the body of Flavian brought to the capital to be buried honorably. The Emperor asked Leo to preside over the council, but Leo again chose to send legates in his place. This time, Bishops Paschasinus of Lilybaeum and Julian of Cos and two priests Boniface and Basil represented the western church at the council. The council was attended by about 520 bishops or their representatives and was the largest and best-documented of the first seven ecumenical councils. All the sessions were held in the church of St. Euphemia, Martyr, outside the city and directly opposite Constantinople. As to the number of sessions held by the Council of Chalcedon there is a great discrepancy in the various texts of the Acts, also in the ancient historians of the council. Either the respective manuscripts must have been incomplete; or the historians passed over in silence several sessions held for secondary purposes. According to the deacon Rusticus, there were in all sixteen sessions; this division is commonly accepted by scholars, including Karl Josef von Hefele, historian of the councils. If all the separate meetings were counted, there would be twenty-one sessions; several of these meetings, however, are considered as supplementary to preceding sessions.

Paschasinus refused to give Dioscorus (who had excommunicated Leo leading up to the council) a seat at the council. As a result, he was moved to the nave of the church. Paschasinus further ordered the reinstatement of Theodoret and that he be given a seat, but this move caused such an uproar among the council fathers, that Theodoret also sat in the nave, though he was given a vote in the proceedings, which began with a trial of Dioscorus.

Marcian wished to bring proceedings to a speedy end, and asked the council to make a pronouncement on the doctrine of the Incarnation before continuing the trial. The council fathers, however, felt that no new creed was necessary, and that the doctrine had been laid out clearly in Leo&#x27;s Tome. They were also hesitant to write a new creed as the First Council of Ephesus had forbidden the composition or use of any new creed. Aetius, deacon of Constantinople then read Cyril&#x27;s letter to Nestorius, and a second letter to John of Antioch. The bishops responded, &quot;We all so believe: Pope Leo thus believes ... we all thus believe. As Cyril so believe we, all of us: eternal be the memory of Cyril: as the epistles of Cyril teach such is our mind, such has been our faith: such is our faith: this is the mind of Archbishop Leo, so he believes, so he has written.&quot;

Beronician, clerk of the consistory, then read from a book handed him by Aetius, the synodical letter of Leo to Flavian (Leo&#x27;s Tome). After the reading of the letter, the bishops cried out: &quot;This is the faith of the fathers, this is the faith of the Apostles. So we all believe, thus the orthodox believe. ... Peter has spoken thus through Leo. So taught the Apostles. Piously and truly did Leo teach, so taught Cyril. Everlasting be the memory of Cyril. Leo and Cyril taught the same thing, ... This is the true faith ... This is the faith of the fathers. Why were not these things read at Ephesus?&quot;

However, during the reading of Leo&#x27;s Tome, three passages were challenged as being potentially Nestorian, and their orthodoxy was defended by using the writings of Cyril. Due to such concerns, the council decided to adjourn and appoint a special committee to investigate the orthodoxy of Leo&#x27;s Tome, judging it by the standard of Cyril&#x27;s Twelve Chapters, as some of the bishops present raised concerns about their compatibility. This committee was headed by Anatolius, Patriarch of Constantinople, and was given five days to carefully study the matter. The committee unanimously decided in favor of the orthodoxy of Leo, determining that what he said was compatible with the teaching of Cyril. A number of other bishops also entered statements to the effect that they believed that Leo&#x27;s Tome was not in contradiction with the teaching of Cyril as well.

The council continued with Dioscorus&#x27; trial, but he refused to appear before the assembly. However, historical accounts from the Eastern Orthodox Church note that Dioscorus was put under solitary arrest. As a result, he was condemned, but by an underwhelming amount (more than half the bishops present for the previous sessions did not attend his condemnation), and all of his decrees were declared null. Empress Pulcheria (Marcian&#x27;s wife) told Dioscorus &quot;In my father&#x27;s time, there was a man who was stubborn (referring to St. John Chrysostom) and you are aware of what was made of him&quot;, to which Dioscorus famously responded &quot;And you may recall that your mother prayed at his tomb, as she was bleeding of sickness&quot;. Pulcheria is said to have slapped Dioscorus in the face, breaking some of his teeth, and ordered the guards to confine him, which they did pulling his beard hair. Dioscorus is said to have put these in a box and sent them back to his Church in Alexandria noting &quot;this is the fruit of my faith.&quot; Marcian responded by exiling Dioscorus.

All of the bishops were then asked to sign their assent to the Tome, but a group of thirteen Egyptians refused, saying that they would assent to &quot;the traditional faith&quot;. As a result, the Emperor&#x27;s commissioners decided that a &quot;credo&quot; would indeed be necessary and presented a text to the fathers. No consensus was reached. Paschasinus threatened to return to Rome to reassemble the council in Italy. Marcian agreed, saying that if a clause were not added to the &quot;credo&quot;, the bishops would have to relocate. The Committee then sat in the oratory of the most holy martyr Euphemis and afterwards reported a definition of faith which while teaching the same doctrine was not the Tome of Leo.

Although it could be reconciled with Cyril&#x27;s Formula of Reunion, it was not compatible in its wording with Cyril&#x27;s Twelve Anathemas. In particular, the third anathema reads: &quot;If anyone divides in the one Christ the hypostases after the union, joining them only by a conjunction of dignity or authority or power, and not rather by a coming together in a union by nature, let him be anathema.&quot; This appeared to some to be incompatible with Leo&#x27;s definition of two natures hypostatically joined. However, the council would determine (with the exception of 13 Egyptian bishops) that this was an issue of wording and not of doctrine; a committee of bishops appointed to study the orthodoxy of the Tome using Cyril&#x27;s letters (which included the twelve anathemas) as their criteria unanimously determined it to be orthodox, and the council, with few exceptions, supported this.

It approved the creed of Nicaea (325), the creed of Constantinople (381; subsequently known as the Nicene Creed), two letters of Cyril against Nestorius, which insisted on the unity of divine and human persons in Christ, and the Tome of Pope Leo I confirming two distinct natures in Christ.

==Acceptance==

The dogmatic definitions of the council are recognized as normative by the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic Churches, as well by certain other Western Churches; also, most Protestants agree that the council&#x27;s teachings regarding the Trinity and the Incarnation are orthodox doctrine which must be adhered to. The council, however, is rejected by the Oriental Orthodox Churches, the latter teaching rather that &quot;The Lord Jesus Christ is God the Incarnate Word. He possesses the perfect Godhead and the perfect manhood. His fully divine nature is united with His fully human nature yet without mixing, blending or alteration.&quot; The Oriental Orthodox contend that this latter teaching has been misunderstood as monophysitism, an appellation with which they strongly disagree but, nevertheless, refuse to accept the decrees of the council.

Many Anglicans and most Protestants consider it to be the last authoritative ecumenical council. These churches, along with Martin Luther, hold that both conscience and scripture preempt doctrinal councils and generally agree that the conclusions of later councils were unsupported by or contradictory to scripture.

===Results===
The Council of Chalcedon issued the Chalcedonian Definition, which repudiated the notion of a single nature in Christ, and declared that he has two natures in one person and hypostasis. It also insisted on the completeness of his two natures: Godhead and manhood. The council also issued 27 disciplinary canons governing church administration and authority. In a further decree, later known as canon 28, the bishops declared that the See of Constantinople (New Rome) had the patriarchal status with &quot;equal privileges&quot; ( in Greek, in Latin) to the See of Rome. No reference was made in Canon 28 to the bishops of Rome or Constantinople having their authority from being successors to Peter or Andrew respectively. Instead, the stated reasons in the actual text of the Canon that the episcopacy of these cities had been granted their status was the importance of these cities as major cities of the empire of the time.

===Confession of Chalcedon===
The Confession of Chalcedon provides a clear statement on the two natures of Christ, human and divine:

The full text of the definition reaffirms the decisions of the Council of Ephesus and the pre-eminence of the Creed of Nicea (325). It also canonises as authoritative two of Cyril of Alexandria&#x27;s letters and the Tome of Leo written against Eutyches and sent to Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople in 449.

===Canons===
The work of the council was completed by a series of 30 disciplinary canons, the Ancient Epitomes of which are:
# The canons of every Synod of the holy Fathers shall be observed.
# Whoso buys or sells an ordination, down to a Prosmonarius, shall be in danger of losing his grade. Such shall also be the case with go-betweens, if they be clerics they shall be cut off from their rank, if laymen or monks, they shall be anathematized.
# Those who assume the care of secular houses should be corrected, unless perchance the law called them to the administration of those not yet come of age, from which there is no exemption. Unless further their Bishop permits them to take care of orphans and widows.
# Domestic oratories and monasteries are not to be erected contrary to the judgment of the bishop. Every monk must be subject to his bishop, and must not leave his house except at his suggestion. A slave, however, can not enter the monastic life without the consent of his master.
# Those who go from city to city shall be subject to the canon law on the subject.
# In Martyries and Monasteries ordinations are strictly forbidden. Should any one be ordained therein, his ordination shall be reputed of no effect.
# If any cleric or monk arrogantly affects the military or any other dignity, let him be cursed.
# Any clergyman in an almshouse or monastery must submit himself to the authority of the bishop of the city. But he who rebels against this let him pay the penalty.
# Litigious clerics shall be punished according to canon, if they despise the episcopal and resort to the secular tribunal. When a cleric has a contention with a bishop let him wait till the synod sits, and if a bishop have a contention with his metropolitan let him carry the case to Constantinople.
# No cleric shall be recorded on the clergy-list of the churches of two cities. But if he shall have strayed forth, let him be returned to his former place. But if he has been transferred, let him have no share in the affairs of his former church.
# Let the poor who stand in need of help make their journey with letters pacificatory and not commendatory: for letters commendatory should only be given to those who are open to suspicion.
# One province shall not be cut into two. Whoever shall do this shall be cast out of the episcopate. Such cities as are cut off by imperial rescript shall enjoy only the honour of having a bishop settled in them: but all the rights pertaining to the true metropolis shall be preserved.
# No cleric shall be received to communion in another city without a letter commendatory.
# A Cantor or Lector alien to the sound faith, if being then married, he shall have begotten children let him bring them to communion, if they had there been baptized. But if they had not yet been baptized they shall not be baptized afterwards by the heretics.
# No person shall be ordained deaconess except she be forty years of age. If she shall dishonour her ministry by contracting a marriage, let her be anathema.
# Monks or nuns shall not contract marriage, and if they do so let them be excommunicated.
# Village and rural parishes if they have been possessed for thirty years, they shall so continue. But if within that time, the matter shall be subject to adjudication. But if by the command of the Emperor a city be renewed, the order of ecclesiastical parishes shall follow the civil and public forms.
# Clerics and Monks, if they shall have dared to hold conventicles and to conspire against the bishop, shall be cast out of their rank.
# Twice each year the Synod shall be held wherever the bishop of the Metropolis shall designate, and all matters of pressing interest shall be determined.
# A clergyman of one city shall not be given a cure in another. But if he has been driven from his native place and shall go into another he shall be without blame. If any bishop receives clergymen from without his diocese he shall be excommunicated as well as the cleric he receives.
# A cleric or layman making charges rashly against his bishop shall not be received.
# Whoever seizes the goods of his deceased bishop shall be cast forth from his rank.
# Clerics or monks who spend much time at Constantinople contrary to the will of their bishop, and stir up seditions, shall be cast out of the city.
# A monastery erected with the consent of the bishop shall be immovable. And whatever pertains to it shall not be alienated. Whoever shall take upon him to do otherwise, shall not be held guiltless.
# Let the ordination of bishops be within three months: necessity however may make the time longer. But if anyone shall ordain counter to this decree, he shall be liable to punishment. The revenue shall remain with the œconomus.
# The œconomus in all churches must be chosen from the clergy. And the bishop who neglects to do this is not without blame.
# If a clergyman elope with a woman, let him be expelled from the Church. If a layman, let him be anathema. The same shall be the lot of any that assist him.
# The bishop of New Rome (Constantinople) shall enjoy the same privileges as the bishop of Old Rome, on account of the removal of the Empire. For this reason the [metropolitans] of Pontus, of Asia, and of Thrace, as well as the Barbarian bishops shall be ordained by the bishop of Constantinople.
# He is sacrilegious who degrades a bishop to the rank of a presbyter. For he that is guilty of crime is unworthy of the priesthood. But he that was deposed without cause, let him be [still] bishop.
# It is the custom of the Egyptians that none subscribe without the permission of their archbishop. Wherefore they are not to be blamed who did not subscribe the Epistle of the holy Leo until an archbishop had been appointed for them.

Canon 28 grants equal privileges () to Constantinople as of Rome because Constantinople is the New Rome as renewed by canon 36 of the Quinisext Council. Pope Leo declared the canon 28 null and void and only approved the canons of the council which were pertaining to faith. Initially, the council indicated their understanding that Pope Leo&#x27;s ratification was necessary for the canon to be binding, writing, &quot;we have made still another enactment which we have deemed necessary for the maintenance of good order and discipline, and we are persuaded that your Holiness will approve and confirm our decree. ... We are confident you will shed upon the Church of Constantinople a ray of that Apostolic splendor which you possess, for you have ever cherished this church, and you are not at all niggardly in imparting your riches to your children. ... Vouchsafe then, most Holy and most Blessed Father, to accept what we have done in your name, and in a friendly spirit (). For your legates have made a violent stand against it, desiring, no doubt, that this good deed should proceed, in the first instance, from your provident hand. But we, wishing to gratify the pious Christian emperors, and the illustrious Senate, and the capital of the empire, have judged that an Ecumenical Council was the fittest occasion for effecting this measure. Hence we have made bold to confirm the privileges of the aforementioned city (tharresantes ekurosamen) as if your holiness had taken the initiative, for we know how tenderly you love your children, and we feel that in honoring the child we have honored its parent. ... We have informed you of everything with a view of proving our sincerity, and of obtaining for our labors your confirmation and consent.&quot; Following Leo&#x27;s rejection of the canon, Bishop Anatolius of Constantinople conceded, &quot;Even so, the whole force of confirmation of the acts was reserved for the authority of Your Blessedness. Therefore, let Your Holiness know for certain that I did nothing to further the matter, knowing always that I held myself bound to avoid the lusts of pride and covetousness.&quot; However, the Canon has since been viewed as valid by the Eastern Orthodox Church.

According to some ancient Greek collections, canons 29 and 30 are attributed to the council: canon 29, which states that an unworthy bishop cannot be demoted but can be removed, is an extract from the minutes of the 19th session; canon 30, which grants the Egyptians time to consider their rejection of Leo&#x27;s &quot;Tome&quot;, is an extract from the minutes of the fourth session.

In all likelihood an official record of the proceedings was made either during the council itself or shortly afterwards. The assembled bishops informed the pope that a copy of all the &quot;Acta&quot; would be transmitted to him; in March 453, Pope Leo commissioned Julian of Cos, then at Constantinople, to make a collection of all the Acts and translate them into Latin. Most of the documents, chiefly the minutes of the sessions, were written in Greek; others, e.g. the imperial letters, were issued in both languages; others, again, e.g. the papal letters, were written in Latin. Eventually nearly all of them were translated into both languages.

==The status of the sees of Constantinople and Jerusalem==

===The status of Jerusalem===

The metropolitan of Jerusalem was given independence from the metropolitan of Antioch and from any other higher-ranking bishop, given what is now known as autocephaly, in the council&#x27;s seventh session whose &quot;Decree on the Jurisdiction of Jerusalem and Antioch&quot; contains: &quot;the bishop of Jerusalem, or rather the most holy Church which is under him, shall have under his own power the three Palestines&quot;. This led to Jerusalem becoming a patriarchate, one of the five patriarchates known as the pentarchy, when the title of &quot;patriarch&quot; was created in 531 by Justinian. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, s.v. &quot;patriarch (ecclesiastical)&quot;, also calls it &quot;a title dating from the 6th century, for the bishops of the five great sees of Christendom&quot;. Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Encyclopedia of World Religions, says: &quot;Five patriarchates, collectively called the pentarchy, were the first to be recognized by the legislation of the emperor Justinian (reigned 527–565)&quot;.

===The status of Constantinople===
In a canon of disputed validity, the Council of Chalcedon also elevated the See of Constantinople to a position &quot;second in eminence and power to the Bishop of Rome&quot;.

The Council of Nicaea in 325 had noted that the Sees of Rome, Alexandria and Antioch should have primacy over other, lesser dioceses. At the time, the See of Constantinople was not yet of ecclesiastical prominence, but its proximity to the Imperial court gave rise to its importance. The Council of Constantinople in 381 modified the situation somewhat by placing Constantinople second in honor, above Alexandria and Antioch, stating in Canon III, that &quot;the bishop of Constantinople ... shall have the prerogative of honor after the bishop of Rome; because Constantinople is New Rome&quot;. In the early 5th century, this status was challenged by the bishops of Alexandria, but the Council of Chalcedon confirmed in Canon XXVIII:
In making their case, the council fathers argued that tradition had accorded &quot;honor&quot; to the see of older Rome because it was the first imperial city. Accordingly, &quot;moved by the same purposes&quot; the fathers &quot;apportioned equal prerogatives to the most holy see of new Rome&quot; because &quot;the city which is honored by the imperial power and senate and enjoying privileges equaling older imperial Rome should also be elevated to her level in ecclesiastical affairs and take second place after her&quot;. The framework for allocating ecclesiastical authority advocated by the council fathers mirrored the allocation of imperial authority in the later period of the Roman Empire. The Eastern position could be characterized as being political in nature, as opposed to a doctrinal view. In practice, all Christians East and West addressed the papacy as the See of Peter and Paul or the Apostolic See rather than the See of the Imperial Capital. Rome understands this to indicate that its precedence has always come from its direct lineage from the apostles Peter and Paul rather than its association with Imperial authority.

After the passage of the Canon 28, Rome filed a protest against the reduction of honor given to Antioch and Alexandria. However, fearing that withholding Rome&#x27;s approval would be interpreted as a rejection of the entire council, in 453 the pope confirmed the council&#x27;s canons while declaring the 28th null and void. This position would change and later be accepted in 1215 at the Fourth Council of the Lateran.

==Consequences: Chalcedonian Schism==

The near-immediate result of the council was a major schism. The bishops who were uneasy with the language of Pope Leo&#x27;s Tome repudiated the council, saying that the acceptance of two &quot;physes&quot; was tantamount to Nestorianism. Dioscorus of Alexandria advocated miaphysitism and had dominated the Council of Ephesus. Churches that rejected Chalcedon in favor of Ephesus broke off from the rest of the Eastern Church in a schism, the most significant among these being the Church of Alexandria, today known as the Coptic Orthodox Church. The rise of the &quot;so-called&quot; monophysitism in the East (as branded by the West) was incorrectly believed to lead by the Copts of Egypt. This must be regarded as the outward expression of the growing nationalist trends in that province against the gradual intensification of Byzantine imperialism, soon to reach its consummation during the reign of Emperor Justinian. However, the Coptic Orthodox Church is miaphysite, which means they believe that Jesus Christ is both 100% human and 100% divine but in one person without mingling, confusion or alteration. In every liturgy till this day, the Copts recite “Christ&#x27;s divinity parted not from His humanity, not for a single moment nor a twinkling of an eye&quot;.

In Egypt, opponents starkly outnumbered adherents, as 30,000 Greeks of Chalcedonian persuasion were ranged against some five million Coptic non-Chalcedonians. A significant effect on the Orthodox Christians in Egypt, was a series of persecutions by the Roman (later, Byzantine) empire forcing followers of the Oriental Orthodox Church to claim allegiance to Leo&#x27;s Tome, or Chalcedon. This led to the martyrdom, persecution and death of thousands of Egyptian saints and bishops till the Arab Conquest of Egypt. As a result, The Council of Chalcedon is referred to as &quot;Chalcedon, the Ominous&quot; among Coptic Egyptians given how it led to Christians persecuting other Christians for the first time in history. Coptic Orthodox Christians continue to distinguish themselves from followers of Chalcedon to this day. Although the theological differences are seen as limited (if non-existent), it is politics, the subsequent persecutions and the power struggles in the Roman Empire, that may have led to the Great Schism, or at least contributed significantly to amplifying it through the centuries.

The divisions in the Church weakened the Byzantine Empire&#x27;s eastern provinces and helped ease the subsequent Sassanian and Arab invasions.

Justinian I attempted to bring those monks who still rejected the decision of the Council of Chalcedon into communion with the greater church. The exact time of this event is unknown, but it is believed to have been between 535 and 548. Abraham of Farshut was summoned to Constantinople and chose to bring with him four monks. Upon arrival, Justinian summoned them and informed them that they could either accept the decision of the council or lose their positions. Abraham refused to entertain the idea. Theodora tried to persuade Justinian to change his mind, seemingly to no avail. Abraham himself stated in a letter to his monks that he preferred to remain in exile rather than subscribe to a faith contrary to that of Athanasius. They were not alone, and the non-Chalcedon churches compose Oriental Orthodoxy, with the Church of Alexandria as their primus inter pares. Only in recent years has a degree of rapprochement between Chalcedonian Christians and the Oriental Orthodox been seen.

==Oriental Orthodox view==
Several Oriental Orthodox Church historians have viewed the council as a dispute with the Church of Rome over precedence among the various patriarchal sees. Coptic sources, both in Coptic and in Arabic, suggest that questions of political and ecclesiastical authority exaggerated differences between the two professions of faith. Modern Coptic Orthodox Christians profess to be Miaphysites. This is reflected in the daily liturgical prayer “Christ&#x27;s divinity parted not from His humanity, not for a single moment nor a twinkling of an eye&quot;.

==Liturgical commemorations==
The Eastern Orthodox Church commemorates the &quot;Holy Fathers of the 4th Ecumenical Council, who assembled in Chalcedon&quot; on the Sunday on or after July 13; however, in some places (e.g., Russia) on that date is rather a feast of the Fathers of the First Six Ecumenical Councils.

For both of the above complete propers have been composed and are found in the Menaion.

For the former &quot;The Office of the 630 Holy and God-bearing Fathers of the 4th ... Summoned against the Monophysites Eftyches and Dioskoros&quot; was composed in the middle of the 14th century by Patriarch Philotheus I of Constantinople. This contains numerous hymns exposing the council&#x27;s teaching, commemorating its leaders whom it praises and whose prayers it implores, and naming its opponents pejoratively, e.g., &quot;Come let us clearly reject the errors of ... but praise in divine songs the fourth council of pious fathers.&quot;

For the latter the propers are titled &quot;We Commemorate Six Holy Ecumenical Councils&quot;. This repeatedly damns those anathematized by the councils with such rhetoric as &quot;Christ-smashing deception enslaved Nestorius&quot; and &quot;mindless Arius and ... is tormented in the fires of Gehenna&quot; while the fathers of the councils are praised and the dogmas of the councils are expounded in the hymns therein.

<text>Canadian football, or simply football, is a sport in Canada in which two teams of 12 players each compete on a field long and wide, attempting to advance a pointed oval-shaped ball into the opposing team&#x27;s end zone.

Canadian and American football have shared origins and are closely related, but have some major differences. 

Rugby football, from which Canadian football developed, was first recorded in Canada in the early 1860s, taken there by British immigrants, possibly in 1824. Both the Canadian Football League (CFL), the sport&#x27;s top professional league, and Football Canada, the governing body for amateur play, trace their roots to 1880 and the founding of the Canadian Rugby Football Union.

The CFL is the most popular and only major professional Canadian football league. Its championship game, the Grey Cup, is one of Canada&#x27;s biggest sporting events, attracting a large television audience.

Canadian football is also played at high school, junior, collegiate, and semi-professional levels: the Canadian Junior Football League and Quebec Junior Football League are for players aged 18–22,
post-secondary institutions compete in U Sports football for the Vanier Cup, and seniors in the Alberta Football League. The Canadian Football Hall of Fame is in Hamilton, Ontario.

== History ==
The first documented football match was a practice game played on November 9, 1861, at University College, University of Toronto (approximately west of Queen&#x27;s Park). One of the participants in the game involving University of Toronto students was Sir William Mulock, later chancellor of the school. A football club was formed at the university soon afterward, although its rules of play at this stage are unclear.

The first written account of a game played was on October 15, 1862, on the Montreal Cricket Grounds. It was between the First Battalion Grenadier Guards and the Second Battalion Scots Fusilier Guards resulting in a win by the Grenadier Guards 3 goals, 2 rouges to nothing. In 1864, at Trinity College, Toronto, F. Barlow Cumberland, Frederick A. Bethune, and Christopher Gwynn, one of the founders of Milton, Massachusetts, devised rules based on rugby football. The game gradually gained a following, with the Hamilton Football Club (later the Hamilton Tiger-Cats) formed on November 3, 1869. Montreal Football Club was formed on April 8, 1872. Toronto Argonaut Football Club was formed on October 4, 1873, and the Ottawa Football Club (later the Ottawa Rough Riders) on September 20, 1876. Of those clubs, only the Toronto club is still in continuous operation today.

This rugby-football soon became popular at Montreal&#x27;s McGill University. McGill challenged Harvard University to a two-game series in 1874, using a hybrid game of English rugby devised by the University of McGill.

The first attempt to establish a proper governing body and to adopt the current set of Rugby rules was the Foot Ball Association of Canada, organized on March 24, 1873, followed by the Canadian Rugby Football Union (CRFU) founded June 12, 1880, which included teams from Ontario and Quebec. Later both the Ontario Rugby Football Union and Quebec Rugby Football Union (ORFU and QRFU respectively) were formed (January 1883), and then the Interprovincial (1907) and Western Interprovincial Football Union (1936) (IRFU and WIFU). The CRFU reorganized into an umbrella organization forming the Canadian Rugby Union (CRU) in 1891. The immediate forerunner to the current Canadian Football League was established in 1956 when the IRFU and WIFU formed an umbrella organization, the Canadian Football Council (CFC). In 1958, the CFC left the CRU to become the &quot;Canadian Football League&quot; (CFL).

The Burnside rules closely resembling American football (which are similar rules developed by Walter Camp for that sport) that were incorporated in 1903 by the ORFU, were an effort to distinguish it from a more rugby-oriented game. The Burnside Rules had teams reduced to 12 men per side, introduced the snap-back system, required the offensive team to gain 10 yards on three downs, eliminated the throw-in from the sidelines, allowed only six men on the line, stated that all goals by kicking were to be worth two points and the opposition was to line up 10 yards from the defenders on all kicks. The rules were an attempt to standardize the rules throughout the country. The CIRFU, QRFU, and CRU refused to adopt the new rules at first. Forward passes were not allowed in the Canadian game until 1929, and touchdowns, which had been five points, were increased to six points in 1956, in both cases several decades after the Americans had adopted the same changes. The primary differences between the Canadian and American games stem from rule changes that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side did not (originally, both sides had three downs, goal posts on the goal lines, and unlimited forward motion, but the American side modified these rules and the Canadians did not). The Canadian field width was one rule that was not based on American rules, as the Canadian game was played in wider fields and stadiums that were not as narrow as the American stadiums.

The Grey Cup was established in 1909, after being donated by Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey, Governor General of Canada, as the championship of teams under the CRU for the Rugby Football Championship of Canada. Initially an amateur competition, it eventually became dominated by professional teams in the 1940s and early 1950s. The ORFU, the last amateur organization to compete for the trophy, withdrew from competition after the 1954 season. The move ushered in the modern era of Canadian professional football, culminating in the formation of the present-day Canadian Football League in 1958.

Canadian football has mostly been confined to Canada, with the United States being the only other country to have hosted high-level Canadian football games. The CFL&#x27;s controversial &quot;South Division&quot; as it would come to be officially known attempted to put CFL teams in the United States playing under Canadian rules in 1995. The Expansion was aborted after three years; the Baltimore Stallions were the most successful of the numerous Americans teams to play in the CFL, winning the 83rd Grey Cup. Continuing financial losses, a lack of proper Canadian football venues, a pervasive belief that the American teams were simply pawns to provide the struggling Canadian teams with expansion fee revenue, and the return of the NFL to Baltimore prompted the end of Canadian football on the American side of the border.

The CFL hosted the Touchdown Atlantic regular season game in Nova Scotia in 2005 and New Brunswick in 2010, 2011, and 2013. In 2013, Newfoundland and Labrador became the last province to establish football at the minor league level, with teams playing on the Avalon Peninsula and in Labrador City. The province however has yet to host a college or CFL game. Prince Edward Island, the smallest of the provinces, has also never hosted a CFL game.

On 13 February 2023, the International Federation of American Football (IFAF) and Football Canada announced in a joint statement that the Canadian Amateur Football Rulebook would be an accepted rules code for international play, but would not be a substitute for world championships or world championship qualification.

&quot;As Football Canada continues to work with IFAF, I believe this opens the door for international friendlies and tournaments to be staged in Canada employing the infrastructure communities have invested in for our sport from coast to coast,&quot; Football Canada president and IFAF General Secretary Jim Mullin said in the joint statement.

== League play ==

Canadian football is played at several levels in Canada; the top league is the professional nine-team Canadian Football League (CFL). The CFL regular season begins in June, and playoffs for the Grey Cup are completed by late November. In cities with outdoor stadiums such as Edmonton, Winnipeg, Calgary, and Regina, low temperatures and icy field conditions can seriously affect the outcome of a game.

Amateur football is governed by Football Canada. At the university level, 27 teams play in four conferences under the auspices of U Sports; the U Sports champion is awarded the Vanier Cup. Junior football is played by many after high school before joining the university ranks. There are 19 junior teams in three conferences in the Canadian Junior Football League competing for the Canadian Bowl. The Quebec Junior Football League includes teams from Ontario and Quebec who battle for the Manson Cup.

Semi-professional leagues have grown in popularity in recent years, with the Alberta Football League becoming especially popular. The Northern Football Conference formed in Ontario in 1954 has also surged in popularity for former college players who do not continue to professional football. The Ontario champion plays against the Alberta champion for the &quot;National Championship&quot;. The Canadian Major Football League is the governing body for the semi-professional game.

Women&#x27;s football has gained attention in recent years in Canada. The first Canadian women&#x27;s league to begin operations was the Maritime Women&#x27;s Football League in 2004. The largest women&#x27;s league is the Western Women&#x27;s Canadian Football League.

== Field ==

The Canadian football field is long and wide, within which the goal areas are deep, and the goal lines are apart. Weighted pylons are placed on the inside corner of the intersections of the goal lines and end lines. Including the end zones, the total area of the field is .

At each goal line is a set of goalposts, which consist of two &quot;uprights&quot; joined by an crossbar which is above the goal line. The goalposts may be H-shaped (both posts fixed in the ground) although in the higher-calibre competitions the tuning-fork design (supported by a single curved post behind the goal line, so that each post starts above the ground) is preferred.
The sides of the field are marked by white sidelines, the goal line is marked in white or yellow, and white lines are drawn laterally across the field every from the goal line. These lateral lines are called &quot;yard lines&quot; and often marked with the distance in yards from and an arrow pointed toward the nearest goal line. Prior to the early 1980s, arrows were not used and all yard lines (in both multiples of 5 and 10) were usually marked with the distance to the goal line, including the goal line itself which was marked with either a &quot;0&quot; or &quot;00&quot;; in most stadiums today, only the yard markers in multiples of 10 are marked with numbers, with the goal line sometimes being marked with a &quot;G&quot;. The centre (55-yard) line usually is marked with a &quot;C&quot; (or, more rarely, with a &quot;55&quot;). &quot;Hash marks&quot; are painted in white, parallel to the yardage lines, at intervals, from the sidelines under amateur rules, but in the CFL.

On fields that have a surrounding running track, such as Molson Stadium and many universities, the end zones are often cut off in the corners to accommodate the track. Until 1986, the end zones were deep, giving the field an overall length of , and a correspondingly larger cutoff could be required at the corners. The first field to feature the shorter 20-yard end zone was Vancouver&#x27;s BC Place (home of the BC Lions), which opened in 1983. This was particularly common among U.S.-based teams during the CFL&#x27;s American expansion, where few American stadiums were able to accommodate the much longer and noticeably wider CFL field. The end zones in Toronto&#x27;s BMO Field are only 18 yards instead of 20 yards.

== Gameplay ==

Teams advance across the field through the execution of quick, distinct plays, which involve the possession of a brown, prolate spheroid ball with ends tapered to a point. The ball has two one-inch-wide white stripes.

=== Start of play ===
At the beginning of a match, an official tosses a coin and allows the captain of the visiting team to call heads or tails. The captain of the team winning the coin toss is given the option of having first choice, or of deferring first choice to the other captain. The captain making first choice may either choose a) to kick off or receive the kick at the beginning of the half, or b) which direction of the field to play in. The remaining choice is given to the opposing captain. Before the resumption of play in the second half, the captain that did not have first choice in the first half is given first choice. Teams usually choose to defer, so it is typical for the team that wins the coin toss to kick to begin the first half and receive to begin the second.

Play begins at the start of each half with one team place-kicking the ball from its own end of the field: the 35-yard line in the CFL, the 45-yard line in amateur play. Both teams then attempt to catch the ball. The player who recovers the ball may run while holding the ball, or lateral throw the ball to a teammate.

=== Stoppage of play ===
Play stops when the ball carrier&#x27;s knee, elbow, or any other body part aside from the feet and hands, is forced to the ground (a &quot;tackle&quot;); when a forward pass is not caught on the fly (during a scrimmage); when a touchdown (see below) or a field goal is scored; when the ball leaves the playing area by any means (being carried, thrown, or fumbled out of bounds); or when the ball carrier is in a standing position but can no longer move forwards (called forward progress). If no score has been made, the next play starts from &quot;scrimmage&quot;.

=== Scrimmage ===
Before scrimmage, an official places the ball at the spot it was at the stop of clock, but no nearer than 24 yards from the sideline or 1 yard from the goal line. The line parallel to the goal line passing through the ball (line from sideline to sideline for the length of the ball) is referred to as the line of scrimmage. This line is similar to &quot;no-man&#x27;s land&quot;; players must stay on their respective sides of this line until the play has begun again. For a scrimmage to be valid the team in possession of the football must have seven players, excluding the quarterback, within one yard of the line of scrimmage. The defending team must stay a yard or more back from the line of scrimmage.
On the field at the beginning of a play are two teams of 12 (and not 11 as in American football). The team in possession of the ball is the offence and the team defending is referred to as the defence. Play begins with a backwards pass through the legs (the snap) by a member of the offensive team, to another member of the offensive team. This is usually the quarterback or punter, but a &quot;direct snap&quot; to a running back is also not uncommon. If the quarterback or punter receives the ball, he may then do any of the following:
* Run with the ball, attempting to run farther down field (gaining yardage). The ball-carrier may run in any direction he sees fit (including backwards).
* &quot;Drop-kick&quot; the ball, dropping it onto the ground and kicking it on the bounce. (This play is now quite rare in both Canadian and American football.)
* Pass the ball laterally or backwards to a teammate. This play is known as a &quot;lateral&quot;, and may come at any time on the play. A pass which has any amount of forward momentum is a &quot;forward pass&quot; (see below); forward passes are subject to many restrictions which do not apply to laterals.
* &quot;Hand-off&quot;—hand the ball off to a teammate, typically a halfback or the fullback.
* &quot;Punt&quot; the ball; dropping it in the air and kicking it &quot;before&quot; it touches the ground. When the ball is punted, only opposing players (the receiving team), the kicker, and anyone behind the kicker when he punted the ball are able to touch the ball, or even go within five yards of the ball until it is touched by an eligible player (the no-yards rule, which is applied to all kicking plays).
* Place the ball on the ground for a &quot;place kick&quot;
* Throw a &quot;forward pass&quot;, where the ball is thrown to a receiver located farther down field (closer to the opponent&#x27;s goal) than the thrower is. Forward passes are subject to the following restrictions:
** They must be made from &quot;behind&quot; the line of scrimmage
** Only one forward pass may be made on a play
** The pass must be made in the direction of an eligible receiver or pass 10 yards after the line of scrimmage

Each play constitutes a &quot;down&quot;. The offence must advance the ball at least ten yards towards the opponents&#x27; goal line within three downs or forfeit the ball to their opponents. Once ten yards have been gained the offence gains a new set of three downs (rather than the four downs given in American football). Downs do not accumulate. If the offensive team completes 10 yards on their first play, they lose the other two downs and are granted another set of three. If a team fails to gain ten yards in two downs they usually punt the ball on third down or try to kick a field goal (see below), depending on their position on the field. The team may, however use its third down in an attempt to advance the ball and gain a cumulative 10 yards.

=== Change in possession ===
The ball changes possession in the following instances:
* If the offence scores a field goal, the scored-against team can either scrimmage from its 35-yard line or have the scoring team kickoff from its 35-yard line.
* If a team scores a touchdown, the scoring team must kickoff from their own 35-yard line.
* If the defence scores on a safety (bringing the ball down in the offence&#x27;s own end zone), they have the right to claim possession.
* If one team kicks the ball; the other team has the right to recover the ball and attempt a return. If a kicked ball goes out of bounds, or the kicking team scores a single or field goal as a result of the kick, the other team likewise gets possession.
* If the offence fails to make ten yards in three plays, the defence &quot;takes over on downs&quot;.
* If the offence attempts a forward pass and it is &quot;intercepted&quot; by the defence, the defence takes possession immediately (and may try to advance the ball on the play). Incomplete forward passes (those which go out of bounds, or which touch the ground without being first cleanly caught by a player) result in the end of the play, and are not returnable by either team.
* If the offence &quot;fumbles&quot; (a ball carrier drops the football, or has it dislodged by an opponent, or if the intended player fails to catch a lateral pass or a snap from centre, or a kick attempt is blocked by an opponent), the ball may be recovered (and advanced) by either team. If a fumbled ball goes out of bounds, the team whose player last touched it is awarded possession at the spot where it went out of bounds. A fumble by the offence in their own end zone, which goes out of bounds, results in a safety.
* When the first half ends, the team which kicked to start the first half will receive a kickoff to start the second half.
* After the three-minute warning near the end of each half, the offence can lose possession for a time count violation (failure to legally put the ball into play within the 20-second duration of the play clock). However, this can only occur if three specific criteria are met:
** The offence committed a time count violation on its last attempted scrimmage play.
** This prior violation took place on third down.
** The referee deemed said violation to be deliberate, and warned the offence that it had to legally place the ball into play within the 20-second clock or lose possession. Such a loss of possession is statistically treated as the defence taking over on downs.

=== Rules of contact ===
There are many rules to contact in this type of football. The only player on the field who may be legally tackled is the player currently in possession of the football (the ball carrier). On a passing play a receiver, that is to say, an offensive player sent down the field to receive a pass, may not be interfered with (have his motion impeded, be blocked, etc.) unless he is within five yards of the line of scrimmage. Prior to a pass that goes beyond the line of scrimmage, a defender may not be impeded more than one yard past that line. Otherwise, any player may block another player&#x27;s passage, so long as he does not hold or trip the player he intends to block. The kicker may not be contacted after the kick but before his kicking leg returns to the ground (this rule is not enforced upon a player who has blocked a kick). The quarterback may not be hit or tackled after throwing the ball, nor may he be hit while in the pocket (i.e. behind the offensive line) prior to that point below the knees or above the shoulders.

=== Infractions and penalties ===
Infractions of the rules are punished with &quot;penalties&quot;, typically a loss of yardage of 5, 10 or 15 yards against the penalized team. Minor violations such as &quot;offside&quot; (a player from either side encroaching into scrimmage zone before the play starts) are penalized five yards, more serious penalties (such as holding) are penalized 10 yards, and severe violations of the rules (such as face-masking [grabbing the face mask attached to a player&#x27;s helmet]) are typically penalized 15 yards. Depending on the penalty, the penalty yardage may be assessed from the original line of scrimmage, from where the violation occurred (for example, for a pass interference infraction), or from where the ball ended after the play. Penalties on the offence may, or may not, result in a loss of down; penalties on the defence may result in a first down being automatically awarded to the offence. For particularly severe conduct, the game official(s) may eject players (ejected players may be substituted for), or in exceptional cases, declare the game over and award victory to one side or the other. Penalties do not affect the yard line which the offence must reach to gain a first down (unless the penalty results in a first down being awarded); if a penalty against the defence results in the first down yardage being attained, then the offence is awarded a first down.

If the defence is penalized on a two-point convert attempt and the offence chooses to attempt the play again, the offence must attempt another two-point convert; it cannot change to a one-point attempt. Conversely, the offence can attempt a two-point convert following a defensive penalty on a one-point attempt.

Penalties may occur before a play starts (such as offside), during the play (such as holding), or in a dead-ball situation (such as unsportsmanlike conduct).

Penalties never result in a score for the offence. For example, a point-of-foul infraction committed by the defence in their end zone is not ruled a touchdown, but instead advances the ball to the one-yard line with an automatic first down. For a distance penalty, if the yardage is greater than half the distance to the goal line, then the ball is advanced half the distance to the goal line, though only up to the one-yard line (unlike American football, in Canadian football no scrimmage may start inside either one-yard line). If the original penalty yardage would have resulted in a first down or moving the ball past the goal line, a first down is awarded.

In most cases, the non-penalized team will have the option of &quot;declining&quot; the penalty; in which case the results of the previous play stand as if the penalty had not been called. One notable exception to this rule is if the kicking team on a 3rd down punt play is penalized before the kick occurs: the receiving team may not decline the penalty and take over on downs. After the kick is made, change of possession occurs and subsequent penalties are assessed against either the spot where the ball is caught, or the runback.

=== Kicking ===
Canadian football distinguishes four ways of kicking the ball:

; Place kick: Kicking a ball held on the ground by a teammate, or, on a kickoff, optionally placed on a tee (two different tees are used for kickoffs and convert/field goal attempts).
; Drop kick: Kicking a ball after bouncing it on the ground. Although rarely used today, it has the same status in scoring as a place kick. This play is part of the game&#x27;s rugby heritage, and was largely made obsolete when the ball with pointed ends was adopted. Unlike the American game, Canadian rules allow a drop kick to be attempted at any time by any player, but the move is very rare.
; Punt: Kicking the ball after it has been released from the kicker&#x27;s hand and before it hits the ground. Punts may not score a field goal, even if one should travel through the uprights. As with drop kicks, players may punt at any time.
; Dribbled ball: A dribbled ball is one that has been kicked while not in possession of a player, for example, a loose ball following a fumble, a blocked kick, a kickoff, or a kick from scrimmage. The kicker of the dribbled ball and any player onside when the ball was kicked may legally recover the ball.

On any kicking play, all onside players (the kicker, and teammates behind the kicker at the time of the kick) may recover and advance the ball. Players on the kicking team who are not onside may not approach within five yards of the ball until it has been touched by the receiving team, or by an onside teammate.

=== Scoring ===
The methods of scoring are:

; Touchdown : Achieved when the ball is in possession of a player in the opponent&#x27;s end zone, or when the ball in the possession of a player crosses or touches the plane of the opponent&#x27;s goal-line, worth 6 points (5 points until 1956). A touchdown in Canadian football is often referred to as a &quot;major score&quot; or simply a &quot;major&quot;.
; Conversion (or convert) : After a touchdown, the team that scored gets one scrimmage play to attempt to add one or two more points. If they make what would normally be a field goal, they score one point (a &quot;point-after&quot;); what would normally be a touchdown scores two points (a &quot;two-point conversion&quot;). In amateur games, this scrimmage is taken at the opponents&#x27; 5-yard line. The CFL formerly ran all conversion attempts from the 5-yard line as well (for a 12-yard kick), but starting in 2015 the line of scrimmage for one-point kick attempts became the 25-yard line (for a 32-yard kick), while two-point attempts are scrimmaged at the 3-yard line. No matter what happens on the convert attempt, play then continues with a kickoff (see below).
; Field goal : Scored by a drop kick or place kick (except on a kickoff) when the ball, after being kicked and without again touching the ground, goes over the cross bar and between the goal posts (or between lines extended from the top of the goal posts) of the opponent&#x27;s goal, worth three points. If the ball hits the upright above the cross-bar before going through, it is not considered a dead ball, and the points are scored. (Rule 5, Sect 4, Art 4(d)) If the field goal is missed, but the ball is not returnable after crossing the dead-ball-line, then it constitutes a &quot;rouge&quot; (see below).
; Safety : Scored when the ball becomes dead in the possession of a team in its own goal area, or when the ball touches or crosses the dead-line, or side-line-in-goal and touches the ground, a player, or some object beyond these lines as a result of the team scored against making a play. It is worth two points. This is different from a &quot;single&quot; (see below) in that the team scored against begins with possession of the ball. The most common safety is on a third down punt from the end zone, in which the kicker decides not to punt and keeps the ball in his team&#x27;s own goal area. The ball is then turned over to the receiving team (who gained the two points), by way of a kickoff from the 25-yard line or scrimmaging from the line on their side of the field.
; Single (rouge) : Scored when the ball becomes dead in the possession of a team in its own goal area, or when the ball touches or crosses the dead-line, or side-line-in-goal, and touches the ground, a player, or some object beyond these lines as a result of the ball having been kicked from the field of play into the goal area by the scoring team. It is worth one point. This is different from a Safety (see above) in that team scored against receives possession of the ball after the score.
:Officially, the single is called a &quot;rouge&quot; (French for &quot;red&quot;) but is often referred to as a single. The exact derivation of the term is unknown, but it has been thought that in early Canadian football, the scoring of a single was signalled with a red flag. A &quot;rouge&quot; is also a method of scoring in the Eton field game, which dates from at least 1815.

==== Resumption of play ====
Resumption of play following a score is conducted under procedures which vary with the type of score.
* Following a touchdown and convert attempt (successful or not), play resumes with the scoring team kicking off from its own 35-yard line (45-yard line in amateur leagues).
* Following a field goal, the non-scoring team may choose for play to resume either with a kickoff as above, or by scrimmaging the ball from its own 35-yard line.
* Following a safety, the scoring team may choose for play to resume in either of the above ways, or it may choose to kick off from its own 35-yard line.
* Following a single/rouge, play resumes with the non-scoring team scrimmaging from its own 35-yard line (Football Canada rules) or 40-yard line (CFL rules). If the single is awarded on a missed field goal, the non-scoring team has the option to scrimmage from the yard line from which the field goal was attempted.

=== Game timing ===
The game consists of two 30-minute halves, each of which is divided into two 15-minute quarters. The clock counts down from 15:00 in each quarter. Timing rules change when there are three minutes remaining in a half.
A short break interval of 2 minutes occurs after the end of each quarter (a longer break of 15 minutes at halftime), and the two teams then change goals.

In the first 27 minutes of a half, the clock stops when:
* Points are scored,
* The ball goes out of bounds,
* A forward pass is incomplete,
* The ball is dead and a penalty flag has been thrown,
* The ball is dead and teams are making substitutions (e.g., possession has changed, punting situation, short yardage situation),
* The ball is dead and a player is injured, or
* The ball is dead and a captain or a coach calls a time-out.

The clock starts again when the referee determines the ball is ready for scrimmage, except for team time-outs (where the clock starts at the snap), after a time count foul (at the snap) and kickoffs (where the clock starts not at the kick but when the ball is first touched after the kick).

In the last three minutes of a half, the clock stops whenever the ball becomes dead. On kickoffs, the clock starts when the ball is first touched after the kick. On scrimmages, when it starts depends on what ended the previous play. The clock starts when the ball is ready for scrimmage except that it starts on the snap when on the previous play:
* The ball was kicked off,
* The ball was punted,
* The ball changed possession,
* The ball went out of bounds,
* There were points scored,
* There was an incomplete forward pass,
* There was a penalty applied (not declined), or
* There was a team time-out.

During the last three minutes of a half, the penalty for failure to place the ball in play within the 20-second play clock, known as a &quot;time count violation&quot; (this foul is known as &quot;delay of game&quot; in American football), is dramatically different from during the first 27 minutes. Instead of the penalty being 5 yards with the down repeated, the base penalty (except during convert attempts) becomes loss of down on first or second down, and 10 yards on third down with the down repeated. In addition, as noted previously, the referee can give possession to the defence for repeated deliberate time count violations on third down.

The clock does not run during convert attempts in the last three minutes of a half. If the 15 minutes of a quarter expire while the ball is live, the quarter is extended until the ball becomes dead. If a quarter&#x27;s time expires while the ball is dead, the quarter is extended for one more scrimmage. A quarter cannot end while a penalty is pending: after the penalty yardage is applied, the quarter is extended one scrimmage. The non-penalized team has the option to &quot;decline&quot; any penalty it considers disadvantageous, so a losing team cannot indefinitely prolong a game by repeatedly committing infractions.

=== Overtime ===
In the CFL, if the game is tied at the end of regulation play, then each team is given an equal number of offensive possessions to break the tie. A coin toss is held to determine which team will take possession first; the first team scrimmages the ball at the opponent&#x27;s 35-yard line and conducts a series of downs until it scores or loses possession. If the team scores a touchdown, starting with the 2010 season, it is required to attempt a two-point conversion. The other team then scrimmages the ball at the opponent&#x27;s 35-yard line and has the same opportunity to score. After the teams have completed their possessions, if one team is ahead, then it is declared the winner; otherwise, the two teams each get another chance to score, scrimmaging from the other 35-yard line. After this second round, if there is still no winner, during the regular season the game ends as a tie. In a playoff game, the teams continue to attempt to score from alternating 35-yard lines, until one team is leading after both have had an equal number of possessions.

In U Sports football, for the Uteck Bowl, Mitchell Bowl, and Vanier Cup, the same overtime procedure is followed until there is a winner.

===Officials and fouls===
Officials are responsible for enforcing game rules and monitoring the clock. All officials carry a whistle and wear black-and-white striped shirts and black caps except for the referee, whose cap is white. Each carries a weighted orange flag that is thrown to the ground to signal that a foul has been called. An official who spots multiple fouls will throw their cap as a secondary signal. The seven officials (of a standard seven-man crew; lower levels of play up to the university level use fewer officials) on the field are each tasked with a different set of responsibilities:

* The referee is positioned behind and to the side of the offensive backs. The referee is charged with oversight and control of the game and is the authority on the score, the down number, and any rule interpretations in discussions among the other officials. The referee announces all penalties and discusses the infraction with the offending team&#x27;s captain, monitors for illegal hits against the quarterback, makes requests for first-down measurements, and notifies the head coach whenever a player is ejected. The referee positions themselves to the passing arm side of the quarterback. In most games, the referee is responsible for spotting the football prior to a play from scrimmage.
* The umpire is positioned in the defensive backfield. The umpire watches play along the line of scrimmage to make sure that no more than 12 offensive players are on the field before the snap. The umpire monitors contact between offensive and defensive linemen and calls most of the holding penalties. The umpire records the number of timeouts taken and the winner of the coin toss and the game score, assists the referee in situations involving possession of the ball close to the line of scrimmage, determines whether player equipment is legal, and dries wet balls prior to the snap if a game is played in rain.
* The back judge is positioned deep in the defensive backfield, behind the umpire. The back judge ensures that the defensive team has no more than 12 players on the field and determines whether catches are legal, whether field goal or extra point attempts are good, and whether a pass interference violation occurred. The back judge is also responsible for the play clock, the time between each play, when a visible play clock is not used.
* The head linesman/down judge is positioned on one end of the line of scrimmage. The head linesman/down judge watches for any line-of-scrimmage and holding violations and assists the line judge with illegal procedure calls. The head linesman/down judge also rules on out-of-bounds calls that happen on their side of the field, oversees the chain crew and marks the forward progress of a runner when a play has been whistled dead.

* The side judge is positioned 20 yards downfield of the head linesman. The side judge mainly duplicates the functions of the field judge. On field goal and extra point attempts, the side judge is positioned lateral to the umpire.
* The line judge is positioned on the end of the line of scrimmage, opposite the head linesman. They supervise player substitutions, the line of scrimmage during punts, and game timing. The line judge notifies the referee when time has expired at the end of a quarter and notifies the head coach of the home team when five minutes remain for halftime. In the CFL, the line judge also alerts the referee when three minutes remain in the half. If the clock malfunctions or becomes inoperable, the line judge becomes the official timekeeper.
* The field judge is positioned 20 yards downfield from the line judge. The field judge monitors and controls the play clock, counts the number of defensive players on the field and watches for offensive pass interference and holding violations by offensive players. The field judge also makes decisions regarding catches, recoveries and the ball spot when a player goes out of bounds. On field goal and extra-point attempts, the field judge is stationed under the upright opposite the back judge.

Another set of officials, the chain crew, is responsible for moving the chains. The chains, consisting of two large sticks with a 10-yard-long chain between them, are used to measure for a first down. The chain crew stays on the sidelines during the game, but if requested by the officials they will briefly bring the chains on to the field to measure. A typical chain crew will have at least three people—two members of the chain crew will hold either of the two sticks, while a third will hold the down marker. The down marker, a large stick with a dial on it, is flipped after each play to indicate the current down and is typically moved to the approximate spot of the ball. The chain crew system has been used for over 100 years and is considered to be an accurate measure of distance, rarely subject to criticism from either side.

=== Severe weather ===
In the CFL, a game must be delayed if lightning strikes within of the stadium or for other severe weather conditions, or if dangerous weather is anticipated. In the regular season, if play has not resumed after 1 hour and at least half of the third quarter has been completed, the score stands as final; this happened for the first time on August 9, 2019, when a Saskatchewan–Montreal game was stopped late in the third quarter.

If the stoppage is earlier in the game, or if it is a playoff or Grey Cup game, play may be stopped for up to 3 hours and then resume. After 3 hours of stoppage, play is terminated at least for the day. A playoff or Grey Cup game must then be resumed the following day at the point where it left off.

In the regular season, if a game is stopped for 3 hours and one team is leading by at least a certain amount, then that team is awarded a win. The size of lead required is 21, 17, or 13 depending on whether the stoppage is in the first, second, or third quarter respectively. If neither team is leading by that much and they are not scheduled to play again in the season, the game is declared a tie.

If a regular-season game is stopped for 3 hours and neither team is leading by the required amount to be awarded a win, but the two teams are scheduled to play again later in the season, then the stopped game is decided by a &quot;two-possession shootout&quot; procedure held before the later game is started. The procedure is generally similar to overtime in the CFL, with two major exceptions: each team must play exactly two possessions regardless of what happens; and while the score from the stopped game is not added to the shootout score, it is used instead to determine the yard line where each team starts its possessions, so the team that was leading still has an advantage.

== Positions ==
The positions in Canadian football have evolved throughout the years, and are not officially defined in the rules. However, there are still several standard positions, as outlined below.

=== Offence ===
The offence must have at least seven players lined up along the line of scrimmage on every play. The players on either end (usually the wide receivers) are eligible to receive forward passes, and may be in motion along the line of scrimmage prior to the snap. The other players on the line of scrimmage (usually the offensive linemen) are ineligible to receive forward passes, and once they are in position, they may not move until the play begins.

Offensive positions fit into three general categories:

==== Offensive linemen ====
The primary roles of the offensive linemen (or &quot;down linemen&quot;) are to protect the quarterback so that he can pass, and to help block on running plays. Offensive linemen generally do not run with the ball (unless they recover it on a fumble) or receive a handoff or lateral pass, but there is no rule against it.

Offensive linemen include the following positions:
: Centre: Snaps the ball to the quarterback to initiate play. The most important pass blocker on pass plays. Calls offensive line plays.
: Left/right guards: Stand to the left and right of the centre. Helps protect the quarterback. Usually very good run blockers, opening holes up the middle for runners.
: Left/right tackles: Stand on the ends of the offensive line. These are the biggest players on the line, usually well over . Usually very good pass blockers.

==== Backs ====
Backs are behind the linemen at the start of play. They may run with the ball, and receive handoffs, laterals, and forward passes. They may also be in motion before the play starts.

Backs include the following positions:
: Quarterback: Generally, the leader of the offence. Calls all plays to teammates, receives the ball from the snap, and initiates the offensive play, usually by passing the ball to a receiver, handing the ball off to another back, or running the ball himself.
: Fullback: Has multiple roles including pass protection, receiving, and blocking for the running back. Sometimes carries the ball, usually on short yardage situations.
: Running back (or &quot;tailback&quot;): As the name implies, the main runner on the team. Also receives passes sometimes, and blocks on pass plays.

==== Receivers ====
Receivers may start the play either on or behind the line of scrimmage. They may run with the ball, and receive handoffs, laterals, and forward passes.

Receivers include the following positions:
: Wide receiver: Lines up on the line of scrimmage, usually at a distance from the centre. Runs a given route to catch a pass and gain yardage.
: Slotback: Lines up behind the line of scrimmage, between the wide receiver and the tackle. May begin running towards the line of scrimmage before the snap. Runs a given route to catch a pass and gain yardage.

=== Defence ===
The rules do not constrain how the defence may arrange itself, other than the requirement that they must remain one yard behind the line of scrimmage until the play starts.

Defensive positions fit into three general categories:

==== Defensive linemen ====
: Left/right defensive tackles: Try to get past the offensive line, or to open holes in the offensive line for linebackers to rush the quarterback.
: Nose tackle: A defensive tackle that lines up directly across from the centre.
: Left/right defensive ends: The main rushing linemen. Rush the quarterback and try to stop runners behind the line of scrimmage.

==== Linebackers ====
: Middle linebacker: Starts the play across from the centre, about 3–4 yards away. Generally, the leader of the defence. Calls plays for linemen and linebackers.
: Weak-side linebacker: Lines up on the short side of the field, and can drop back into pass coverage, or contain a run.
: Strong-side linebacker: Lines up on the long side of the field, and usually focuses on stopping the runner.

==== Defensive backs ====
: Cornerback: Covers one of the wide receivers on most plays.
: Defensive halfback: Covers one of the slotbacks and helps contain the run from going to the side of the field.
: Safety: Covers the back of the field, usually in the centre, and as the last line of defence. Occasionally rushes the quarterback or stops the runner.

=== Special teams ===
Special teams are generally used on kicking plays, which include kickoffs, punts, field goal attempts, and extra point attempts. Special teams include the following positions:

: Long snapper: Snaps the ball for a punt, field goal attempt, or extra point attempt.
: Holder: Receives the snap on field goal attempts and extra point attempts. Places the ball in position and holds it for the kicker. This position is generally filled by a reserve quarterback, but occasionally the starting quarterback or punter will fill in as holder.
: Kicker: Performs kickoffs. Kicks field goal attempts and extra point attempts.
: Punter: Punts the ball, usually on third down.
: Returner: On kickoffs, punts, and missed field goals, returns the ball as far down the field as possible. Typically, a fast, agile runner.

<text>The traditional Chinese calendar, dating back to the Han dynasty, is a lunisolar calendar that blends solar, lunar, and other cycles for social and agricultural purposes. While modern China primarily uses the Gregorian calendar for official purposes, the traditional calendar remains culturally significant. It determines the timing of Chinese New Year with traditions like the twelve animals of the Chinese Zodiac still widely observed.

The traditional Chinese calendar uses the sexagenary cycle, a repeating system of Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches, to mark years, months, and days. This system, along with astronomical observations and mathematical calculations, was developed to align solar and lunar cycles, though some approximations are necessary due to the natural differences between these cycles. Over centuries, the calendar was refined through advancements in astronomy and horology, with dynasties introducing variations to improve accuracy and meet cultural or political needs.

While the Gregorian calendar has become now standard for civic daily use in China, the traditional lunisolar calendar continues to influence festivals, cultural practices, and zodiac-based customs. Beyond China, it has shaped other East Asian calendars, including the Korean, Vietnamese, and Japanese lunar systems, each adapting the same lunisolar principles while integrating local customs and terminology.

Epochs, or fixed starting points for year counting, have played an essential role in the Chinese calendar&#x27;s structure. Some epochs are based on historical figures, such as the inauguration of the Yellow Emperor (Huangdi), while others marked the rise of dynasties or significant political shifts. This system allowed for the numbering of years based on regnal eras, with the start of a ruler&#x27;s reign often resetting the count.

The Chinese calendar also tracks time in smaller units, including months, days, and double-hour periods called shichen. These timekeeping methods have influenced broader fields of horology, with some principles, such as precise time subdivisions, still evident in modern scientific timekeeping. The continued use of the calendar today highlights its enduring cultural, historical, and scientific significance.

==Etymology==
The name of calendar is in , and was represented in earlier character forms variants (), and ultimately derived from an ancient form (). The ancient form of the character consists of two stalks of rice plant (), arranged in parallel. This character represents the order in space and also the order in time. As its meaning became complex, the modern dedicated character () was created to represent the meaning of calendar.

Maintaining the correctness of calendars was an important task to maintain the authority of rulers, being perceived as a way to measure the ability of a ruler. For example, someone seen as a competent ruler would foresee the coming of seasons and prepare accordingly. This understanding was also relevant in predicting abnormalities of the Earth and celestial bodies, such as lunar and solar eclipses. The significant relationship between authority and timekeeping helps to explain why there are 102 calendars in Chinese history, trying to predict the correct courses of sun, moon and stars, and marking good time and bad time. Each calendar is named as and recorded in a dedicated calendar section in history books of different eras. The last one in imperial era was . A ruler would issue an almanac before the commencement of each year. There were private almanac issuers, usually illegal, when a ruler lost his control of some territories.

There are various Chinese terms for the calendar including:

* Nongli Calendar ()
* Jiuli Calendar ()
* Laoli Calendar ()
* Zhongli Calendar ()
* Huali Calendar () 

Various modern Chinese calendar names resulted from the struggle between the introduction of Gregorian calendar by government and the preservation of customs by the public in the era of Republic of China. The government wanted to abolish the Chinese calendar to force everyone to use the Gregorian calendar, and even abolished the Chinese New Year, but faced great opposition. The public needed the astronomical Chinese calendar to do things at a proper time, for example farming and fishing; also, a wide spectrum of festivals and customs observations have been based on the calendar. The government finally compromised and rebranded it as the agricultural calendar in 1947, depreciating the calendar to merely agricultural use.

After the end of the imperial era, there are some almanacs based upon the algorithm of the last Imperial calendar with longitude of Peking. Such almanacs were under the name of &quot;universal book&quot; , or under Cantonese name , transcribed as Tung Shing. Later these almanacs moved to new calculation based on the location of Purple Mountain Observatory, with longitude of 120°E.

== Year-numbering systems ==
===Eras===

Ancient China numbered years from an emperor&#x27;s ascension to the throne or his declaration of a new era name. The first recorded reign title was , from 140 BCE; the last reign title was , from 1908 CE. The era system was abolished in 1912, after which the current or Republican era was used.

===Epochs===
An epoch is a point in time chosen as the origin of a particular calendar era, thus serving as a reference point from which subsequent time or dates are measured. The use of epochs in Chinese calendar system allow for a chronological starting point from whence to begin point continuously numbering subsequent dates. Various epochs have been used. Similarly, nomenclature similar to that of the Christian era has occasionally been used:

No reference date is universally accepted. The most popular is the Gregorian calendar ().

During the 17th century, the Jesuit missionaries tried to determine the epochal year of the Chinese calendar. In his (published in Munich in 1658), Martino Martini (1614–1661) dated the Yellow Emperor&#x27;s ascension at 2697 BCE and began the Chinese calendar with the reign of Fuxi (which, according to Martini, began in 2952 BCE).
Philippe Couplet&#x27;s 1686 &quot;Chronological table of Chinese monarchs&quot; () gave the same date for the Yellow Emperor. The Jesuits&#x27; dates provoked interest in Europe, where they were used for comparison with Biblical chronology. Modern Chinese chronology has generally accepted Martini&#x27;s dates, except that it usually places the reign of the Yellow Emperor at 2698 BCE and omits his predecessors Fuxi and Shennong as &quot;too legendary to include&quot;.

Publications began using the estimated birth date of the Yellow Emperor as the first year of the Han calendar in 1903, with newspapers and magazines proposing different dates. Jiangsu province counted 1905 as the year 4396 (using a year 1 of 2491 BCE, and implying that 2025 CE is 4516), and the newspaper &quot;Ming Pao&quot; () reckoned 1905 as 4603 (using a year 1 of 2698 BCE, and implying that 2025 CE is 4723). Liu Shipei (, 1884–1919) created the Yellow Emperor Calendar (), with year 1 as the birth of the emperor (which he determined as 2711 BCE, implying that 2025 CE is 4736). There is no evidence that this calendar was used before the 20th century. Liu calculated that the 1900 international expedition sent by the Eight-Nation Alliance to suppress the Boxer Rebellion entered Beijing in the 4611th year of the Yellow Emperor.

Taoists later adopted Yellow Emperor Calendar and named it Tao Calendar ().

On 2 January 1912, Sun Yat-sen announced changes to the official calendar and era. 1 January was 14 4609 year, assuming a year 1 of 2698 BCE, making 2025 CE year 4723. Many overseas Chinese communities like San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown adopted the change.

The modern Chinese standard calendar uses the epoch of the Gregorian calendar, which is on 1 January of the year 1 CE.

==History==
The Chinese calendar system has a long history, which has traditionally been associated with specific dynastic periods. Various individual calendar types have been developed with different names. In terms of historical development, some of the calendar variations are associated with dynastic changes along a spectrum beginning with a prehistorical/mythological time to and through well attested historical dynastic periods. Many individuals have been associated with the development of the Chinese calendar, including researchers into underlying astronomy; and, furthermore, the development of instruments of observation are historically important. Influences from India, Islam, and Jesuits also became significant.

===Solar calendars===

The traditional Chinese lunisolar calendar was developed between 771 BCE and 476 BCE, during the Spring and Autumn period of the Eastern Zhou dynasty. Solar calendars were used before the Zhou dynasty period, along with the basic sexagenary system.

One version of the solar calendar is the five-elements calendar (), which derives from the Wu Xing. A 365-day year was divided into five phases of 73 days, with each phase corresponding to a Day 1 Wu Xing element. A phase began with a governing-element day (), followed by six 12-day weeks. Each phase consisted of two three-week months, making each year ten months long. Years began on a day and a 72-day wood phase, followed by a day and a 72-day fire phase; a day and a 72-day earth phase; a day and a 72-day metal phase, and a day followed by a water phase. Other days were tracked using the Yellow River Map (&quot;He Tu&quot;).

Another version is a four-quarters calendar (, or ). The weeks were ten days long, with one month consisting of three weeks. A year had 12 months, with a ten-day week intercalated in summer as needed to keep up with the tropical year. The 10 Heavenly Stems and 12 Earthly Branches were used to mark days.

A third version is the balanced calendar (). A year was 365.25 days, and a month was 29.5 days. After every 16th month, a half-month was intercalated. According to oracle bone records, the Shang dynasty calendar ( BCE) was a balanced calendar with 12 to 14 months in a year; the month after the winter solstice was .

A solar calendar called the Tung Shing, the &quot;Yellow Calendar&quot; or &quot;Imperial Calendar&quot; (both alluding to Yellow Emperor) continued to see use as an almanac and agricultural guide throughout Chinese history.

===Lunisolar calendars by dynasty===

Lunisolar calendars involve correlations of the cycles of the sun (solar) and the moon (lunar). 
====Zhou dynasty====
From the Warring States period (ending in 221 BCE), six especially significant calendar systems are known to have begun to be developed. Later on, during their future course in history, the modern names for the ancient six calendars were also developed: Huangdi, Yin, Zhou, Xia, Zhuanxu, and Lu.

Modern historical knowledge and records are limited for the earlier calendars. These calendars are known as the six ancient calendars (), or quarter-remainder calendars, (), since all calculate a year as days long. Months begin on the day of the new moon, and a year has 12 or 13 months. Intercalary months (a 13th month) are added to the end of the year. The Qiang and Dai calendars are modern versions of the Zhuanxu calendar, used by highland peoples.

The first lunisolar calendar was the Zhou calendar (), introduced under the Zhou dynasty (1046 BCE – 256 BCE). This calendar sets the beginning of the year at the day of the new moon before the winter solstice.

====Competing Warring states calendars====
Several competing lunisolar calendars were also introduced as Zhou devolved into the Warring States, especially by states fighting Zhou control during the Warring States period (perhaps 475 BCE - 221 BCE). The state of Lu issued its own Lu calendar(). The state of Jin issued the Xia calendar () with a year beginning on the day of the new moon nearest the March equinox. The state of Qin issued the Zhuanxu calendar (), with a year beginning on the day of the new moon nearest the winter solstice. The Song state&#x27;s Yin calendar () began its year on the day of the new moon after the winter solstice.

====Qin and early Han dynasties====

After Qin Shi Huang unified China under the Qin dynasty in 221 BCE, the Qin calendar () was introduced. It followed most of the rules governing the Zhuanxu calendar, but the month order was that of the Xia calendar; the year began with month 10 and ended with month 9, analogous to a Gregorian calendar beginning in October and ending in September. The intercalary month, known as the second , was placed at the end of the year. The Qin calendar was used going into the Han dynasty.

====Han dynasty Tàichū calendar====

Emperor Wu of Han introduced reforms in the seventh of the eleven named eras of his reign, , 104 BCE – 101 BCE. His Calendar () defined a solar year as days (365;06:00:14.035), and the lunar month had days (29;12:44:44.444). 
Since formula_1 the 19 years cycle used for the 7 additional months was taken as an exact one, and not as an approximation.

This calendar introduced the 24 solar terms, dividing the year into 24 equal parts of 15° each. Solar terms were paired, with the 12 combined periods known as climate terms. The first solar term of the period was known as a pre-climate (), and the second was a mid-climate (). Months were named for the mid-climate to which they were closest, and a month without a mid-climate was an intercalary month.

The Taichu calendar established a framework for traditional calendars, with later calendars adding to the basic formula.

====Northern and Southern Dynasties Dàmíng calendar====

The Dàmíng Calendar (), created in the Northern and Southern Dynasties by Zu Chongzhi (429 CE – 500 CE), introduced the equinoxes.

====Tang dynasty Wùyín Yuán calendar====

The use of syzygy to determine the lunar month was first described in the Tang dynasty Calendar ().

====Yuan dynasty Shòushí calendar====

The Yuan dynasty Shòushí calendar () used spherical trigonometry to find the length of the tropical year. The calendar had a 365.2425-day year, identical to the Gregorian calendar.

==== Ming and Qing Shíxiàn calendar ====

From 1645 to 1913 the or Chongzhen was developed. During the late Ming dynasty, the Chinese Emperor appointed Xu Guangqi in 1629 to be the leader of the ShiXian calendar reform. Assisted by Jesuits, he translated Western astronomical works and introduced new concepts, such as those of Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei, and Tycho Brahe; however, the new calendar was not released before the end of the dynasty. In the early Qing dynasty, Johann Adam Schall von Bell submitted the calendar which was edited by the lead of Xu Guangqi to the Shunzhi Emperor. The Qing government issued it as the (seasonal) calendar. In this calendar, the solar terms are 15° each along the ecliptic and it can be used as a solar calendar. However, the length of the climate term near the perihelion is less than 30 days and there may be two mid-climate terms. The calendar changed the mid-climate-term rule to &quot;decide the month in sequence, except the intercalary month.&quot; The present traditional calendar follows the Shíxiàn calendar, except:
# The baseline is Chinese Standard Time, rather than Beijing local time.
# (Modern) astronomical data, rather than mathematical calculations, is used.

====Modern Chinese calendar====

The Chinese calendar lost its place as the country&#x27;s official calendar at the beginning of the 20th century, its use has continued. The &quot;Republic of China Calendar&quot; published by the Beiyang government of the Republic of China still listed the dates of the Chinese calendar in addition to the Gregorian calendar. In 1929, the Nationalist government tried to ban the traditional Chinese calendar. The Calendar published by the government no longer listed the dates of the Chinese calendar. However, Chinese people were used to the traditional calendar and many traditional customs were based on the Chinese calendar. The ban failed and was lifted in 1934. The latest Chinese calendar was &quot;New Edition of , revised edition&quot;, edited by Beijing Purple Mountain Observatory, People&#x27;s Republic of China.

In China, the modern calendar is defined by the Chinese national standard GB/T 33661–2017, &quot;Calculation and Promulgation of the Chinese Calendar&quot;, issued by the Standardization Administration of China on 12 May 2017.

Although modern-day China uses the Gregorian calendar, the traditional Chinese calendar governs holidays, such as the Chinese New Year and Lantern Festival, in both China and overseas Chinese communities. It also provides the traditional Chinese nomenclature of dates within a year which people use to select auspicious days for weddings, funerals, moving or starting a business. The evening state-run news program &quot;Xinwen Lianbo&quot; in the People&#x27;s Republic of China continues to announce the months and dates in both the Gregorian and the traditional lunisolar calendar.

To optimize the Chinese calendar, astronomers have proposed a number of changes. Kao Ping-tse (; 1888–1970), a Chinese astronomer who co-founded the Purple Mountain Observatory, proposed that month numbers be calculated before the new moon and solar terms to be rounded to the day. Since the intercalary month is determined by the first month without a mid-climate and the mid-climate time varies by time zone, countries that adopted the calendar but calculate with their own time could vary from the time in China.

===Contributions from Chinese astronomy===
The Chinese calendar has been a development involving much observation and calculation of the apparent movements of the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars, as observed from Earth.

Many Chinese astronomers have contributed to the development of the Chinese calendar. Many were of the scholarly or &quot;shi&quot; class (), including writers of history, such as Sima Qian.

Notable Chinese astronomers who have contributed to the development of the calendar include Gan De, Shi Shen, and Zu Chongzhi
Early technological developments aiding in calendar development include the development of the gnomon. Later technological developments useful to the calendar system include naming, numbering and mapping of the sky, the development of analog computational devices such as the armillary sphere and the water clock, and the establishment of observatories.

==Phenology==

Early calendar systems, including the Chinese calendar, often were closely tied to natural phenomena. Phenology is the study of periodic events in biological life cycles and how these are influenced by seasonal and interannual variations in climate, as well as habitat factors (such as elevation). The plum-rains season (), the rainy season in late spring and early summer, begins on the first day after &quot;Mangzhong&quot; () and ends on the first day after Xiaoshu (). The Three Fu () are three periods of hot weather, counted from the first day after the summer solstice. The first () is 10 days long. The mid- () is 10 or 20 days long. The last () is 10 days from the first day after the beginning of autumn. The Shujiu cold days () are the 81 days after the winter solstice (divided into nine sets of nine days), and are considered the coldest days of the year. Each nine-day unit is known by its order in the set, followed by &quot;nine&quot; (). In traditional Chinese culture, &quot;nine&quot; represents the infinity, which is also the number of &quot;Yang&quot;. According to one belief nine times accumulation of &quot;Yang&quot; gradually reduces the &quot;Yin&quot;, and finally the weather becomes warm.

=== Names of months ===
Lunar months were originally named according to natural phenomena. Current naming conventions use numbers as the month names. Every month is also associated with one of the twelve Earthly Branches.
*Gregorian dates are approximate and should be used with caution. Many years have intercalary months.

Though the numbered month names are often used for the corresponding month number in the Gregorian calendar, it is important to realize that the numbered month names are not interchangeable with the Gregorian months when talking about lunar dates.

== Horology ==

Horology, or chronometry, refers to the measurement of time. In the context of the Chinese calendar, horology involves the definition and mathematical measurement of terms or elements such observable astronomic movements or events such as are associated with days, months, years, hours, and so on. These measurements are based upon objective, observable phenomena. Calendar accuracy is based upon accuracy and precision of measurements.

The Chinese calendar is lunisolar, similar to the Hindu, Hebrew and ancient Babylonian calendars. In this case the calendar is in part based in objective, observable phenomena and in part by mathematical analysis to correlate the observed phenomena. Lunisolar calendars especially attempt to correlate the solar and lunar cycles, but other considerations can be agricultural and seasonal or phenological, or religious, or even political.

Basic horologic definitions include that days begin and end at midnight, and months begin on the day of the new moon. Years start on the second (or third) new moon after the winter solstice. Solar terms govern the beginning, middle, and end of each month. A sexagenary cycle, comprising the heavenly stems () and the earthly branches (), is used as identification alongside each year and month, including intercalary months or leap months. Months are also annotated as either long ( for months with 30 days) or short ( for months with 29 days). There are also other elements of the traditional Chinese calendar.

===Day===
Days are Sun oriented, based upon divisions of the solar year. A day () is considered both traditionally and currently to be the time from one midnight to the next. Traditionally days (including the night-time portion) were divided into 12 double-hours, and in modern times the 24 hour system has become more standard.

===Week===

As early as the Bronze Age Xia dynasty, days were grouped into nine- or ten-day weeks known as . Months consisted of three . The first 10 days were the early (), the middle 10 the mid (), and the last nine (or 10) days were the late (). Japan adopted this pattern, with 10-day-weeks known as . In Korea, they were known as &quot;sun&quot; (,).

The structure of led to public holidays every five or ten days. Officials of the Han dynasty were legally required to rest every five days (twice a , or 5–6 times a month). The name of these breaks became .

Grouping days into sets of ten is still used today in referring to specific natural events. &quot;Three Fu&quot; (), a 29–30-day period which is the hottest of the year, reflects its three- length. After the winter solstice, nine sets of nine days were counted to calculate the end of winter.

The seven-day week was adopted from the Hellenistic system by the 4th century CE, although its method of transmission into China is unclear. It was again transmitted to China in the 8th century by Manichaeans via Kangju (a Central Asian kingdom near Samarkand), and is the most-used system in modern China.

===Month===

Months are Moon oriented. &quot;Month&quot; (), the time from one new moon to the next. These synodic months are about days long. This includes the &quot;Date&quot; (), when a day occurs in the month. Days are numbered in sequence from 1 to 29 (or 30). And, a &quot;Calendar month&quot; (), is when a month occurs within a year. Some months may be repeated.

Months are defined by the time between new moons, which averages approximately days. There is no specified length of any particular Chinese month, so the first month could have 29 days (short month, ) in some years and 30 days (long month, ) in other years.

Since the beginning of the month is determined by when the new moon occurs, other countries using this calendar use their own time standards to calculate it; this results in deviations. The first new moon in 1968 was at 16:29 UTC on 29 January. Since North Vietnam used UTC+07:00 to calculate their Vietnamese calendar and South Vietnam used UTC+08:00 (Beijing time) to calculate theirs, North Vietnam began the Tết holiday at 29 January at 23:29 while South Vietnam began it on 30 January at 00:15. The time difference allowed asynchronous attacks in the Tet Offensive.

Because astronomical observation determines month length, dates on the calendar correspond to moon phases. The first day of each month is the new moon. On the seventh or eighth day of each month, the first-quarter moon is visible in the afternoon and early evening. On the 15th or 16th day of each month, the full moon is visible all night. On the 22nd or 23rd day of each month, the last-quarter moon is visible late at night and in the morning.

Different eras used different systems to determine the length of each month. The synodic month of the Taichu calendar was days long. The 7th-century, Tang-dynasty Wùyín Yuán Calendar was the first to determine month length by synodic month instead of the cycling method. Since then, month lengths have primarily been determined by observation and prediction.

The days of the month are always written with two characters and numbered beginning with 1. Days one to 10 are written with the day&#x27;s numeral, preceded by the character &quot;Chū&quot; (); &quot;Chūyī&quot; () is the first day of the month, and &quot;Chūshí&quot; () the 10th. Days 11 to 20 are written as regular Chinese numerals; &quot;Shíwǔ&quot; () is the 15th day of the month, and &quot;Èrshí&quot; () the 20th. Days 21 to 29 are written with the character &quot;Niàn&quot; () before the characters one through nine; &quot;Niànsān&quot; (), for example, is the 23rd day of the month. Day 30 (when applicable) is written as the numeral &quot;Sānshí&quot; ().

===Year===
A year () is based upon the time of one revolution of Earth around the Sun, rounded to whole days. Traditionally, the year is measured from the first day of spring (lunisolar year) or the winter solstice (solar year).

A 12-month-year using this system has 354 days, which would drift significantly from the tropical year. To fix this, traditional Chinese years have a 13-month year approximately once every three years. The 13-month version has the same long and short months alternating, but adds a 30-day leap month (). Years with 12 months are called common years, and 13-month years are known as long years.

A solar year is astronomically about days. A lunisolar calendar year is either 353–355 or 383–385 days long. The lunisolar calendar () year usually begins on the new moon closest to Lichun, the first day of spring. This is typically the second and sometimes third new moon after the winter solstice.

The lunisolar year begins with the first spring month, (), and ends with the last winter month, (). All other months are named for their number in the month order. See below on the timing of the Chinese New Year.

==== Solar year and solar terms ====

The solar year (), the time between winter solstices, is divided into 24 solar terms known as jié qì (). Each term is a 15° portion of the ecliptic. These solar terms mark both Western and Chinese seasons, as well as equinoxes, solstices, and other Chinese events. The even-numbered solar terms (, &quot;Zhongqi&quot; or &quot;mid-climate&quot;) are considered &quot;major terms&quot;, while the odd solar terms (, &quot;Jieqi&quot;) are deemed &quot;minor terms&quot;. The solar terms qīng míng () on 5 April and dōng zhì () on 22 December are both celebrated events in China. Pairs of solar terms are referred to as climate terms. The first solar term in a pair is the &quot;pre-climate&quot; (), and the second is the &quot;mid-climate&quot; (). 

The solar year (&quot;suì&quot;, ) begins on the December solstice and proceeds through the 24 solar terms. Since the speed of the Sun&#x27;s apparent motion in the elliptical is variable, the time between major terms/mid-climates is not fixed. This variation in time between major terms results in different solar year lengths. There are generally 11 or 12 complete lunar months, plus two incomplete lunar months around the winter solstice, in a solar year. The complete lunar months are numbered from 0 to 10, and the incomplete lunar month is considered the 11th month. If there are 12 complete (and one incomplete) lunar months within a solar year, it is known as a leap year (a year possessing an intercalary month).

Different versions of the traditional calendar might have different average solar year lengths. For example, one solar year of the 1st century BCE Tàichū calendar is (365.25016) days. A solar year of the 13th-century Shòushí calendar is (365.2425) days, identical to the Gregorian calendar. The additional .00766 day from the Tàichū calendar leads to a one-day shift every 130.5 years.

If there are 12 complete lunar months within a solar year, the first lunar month that does not contain any mid-climate is designated the leap, or intercalary, month. Leap months are numbered with , the character for &quot;intercalary&quot;, plus the name of the month they follow. In 2017, the intercalary month after month six was called , or &quot;intercalary sixth month&quot; () and written as &quot;6i&quot; or &quot;6+&quot;. The next intercalary month (in 2020, after month four) will be called () and written &quot;4i&quot; or &quot;4+&quot;.

===Planets===
The movements of the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn (sometimes known as the seven luminaries) are the references for calendar calculations. 
* The distance between Mercury and the sun is less than 30° (the sun&#x27;s height at &quot;chénshí&quot;:, 8:00 to 10:00 am), so Mercury was sometimes called the &quot;chen star&quot; (); it is more commonly known as the &quot;water star&quot; ().
* Venus appears at dawn and dusk and is known as the &quot;bright star&quot; () or &quot;long star&quot; ().
* Mars looks like fire and occurs irregularly, and is known as the &quot;fire star&quot; ( or ). Mars is the punisher in Chinese mythology. When Mars is near Antares (), it is a bad omen and can forecast an emperor&#x27;s death or a chancellor&#x27;s removal ().
* Jupiter&#x27;s revolution period is 11.86 years, so Jupiter is called the &quot;age star&quot; (); 30° of Jupiter&#x27;s revolution is about a year on earth.
* Saturn&#x27;s revolution period is about 28 years. Known as the &quot;guard star&quot; (), Saturn guards one of the 28 Mansions every year.

===Stars===
====Big Dipper====

The Big Dipper is the celestial compass, and its handle&#x27;s direction indicates the season and month.

====3 Enclosures and 28 Mansions====

The stars are divided into Three Enclosures and 28 Mansions according to their location in the sky relative to Ursa Minor, at the center. Each mansion is named with a character describing the shape of its principal asterism. The Three Enclosures are Purple Forbidden, (), Supreme Palace (), and Heavenly Market (). The eastern mansions are . Southern mansions are . Western mansions are . Northern mansions are . The moon moves through about one lunar mansion per day, so the 28 mansions were also used to count days. In the Tang dynasty, Yuan Tiangang () matched the 28 mansions, seven luminaries and yearly animal signs to yield combinations such as &quot;horn-wood-flood dragon&quot; ().

===== List of lunar mansions =====

The names and determinative stars of the mansions are:
== Sexagenary system==
Several coding systems are used to avoid ambiguity. The Heavenly Stems is a decimal system. The Earthly Branches, a duodecimal system, mark dual hours ( or ) and climatic terms. The 12 characters progress from the first day with the same branch as the month (first day () of ; first day () of ), and count the days of the month.
Years, months, days of the month and hours could traditionally numbered by the terminology of the Chinese sexagenary cycle.

The stem-branches is a sexagesimal system. The Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches make up 60 stem-branches. The stem branches mark days and years. The five Wu Xing elements are assigned to each stem, branch, or stem branch.

For example, the year from 12 February 2021 to 31 January 2022 was a year () of 12 months or 354 days. The 60 stem-branches have been used to mark the year since the Shang dynasty (1600 BCE – 1046 BCE). Astrologers knew that the orbital period of Jupiter is about 12×361 = 4332 days, which they divided into 12 years () of 361 days each. The stem-branches system solved the era system&#x27;s problem of unequal reign lengths.

Current naming conventions use numbers as the month names, although each month is also associated with one of the twelve Earthly Branches. Correspondences with Gregorian dates are approximate and should be used with caution. Many years have intercalary months.

Historically, Chinese had days of the month numbered with the 60 stem-branches: 

Fortune-tellers identify the heavenly stem and earthly branch corresponding to a particular day in the month, and those corresponding to its month, and those to its year, to determine the Four Pillars of Destiny associated with it, for which the Tung Shing, also referred to as the Chinese Almanac of the year, or the Huangli, and containing the essential information concerning Chinese astrology, is the most convenient publication to consult. Days rotate through a sexagenary cycle marked by coordination between heavenly stems and earthly branches, hence the referral to the Four Pillars of Destiny as, &quot;Bazi&quot;, or &quot;Birth Time Eight Characters&quot;, with each pillar consisting of a character for its corresponding heavenly stem, and another for its earthly branch. Since Huangli days are sexagenaric, their order is quite independent of their numeric order in each month, and of their numeric order within a week (referred to as True Animals in relation to the Chinese zodiac). Therefore, it does require painstaking calculation for one to arrive at the Four Pillars of Destiny of a particular given date, which rarely outpaces the convenience of simply consulting the Huangli by looking up its Gregorian date.

The Tang dynasty used the Earthly Branches to mark the months from December 761 to May 762. Over this period, the year began with the winter solstice.

China has used the Western hour-minute-second system to divide the day since the Qing dynasty. Several systems were in use historically; systems using multiples of twelve and ten were popular, since they could be easily counted and aligned with the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches.

== Age reckoning ==

In modern China, a person&#x27;s official age is based on the Gregorian calendar. For traditional use, age is based on the Chinese &quot;Sui&quot; calendar. A child is considered one year old at birth. After each Chinese New Year, one year is added to their traditional age. Their age therefore is the number of Chinese calendar years in which they have lived. Due to the potential for confusion, the age of infants is often given in months instead of years.

After the Gregorian calendar was introduced in China, the Chinese traditional-age was referred to as the &quot;nominal age&quot; () and the Gregorian age was known as the &quot;real age&quot; ().

==Holidays==
Various traditional and religious holidays shared by communities throughout the world use the Chinese (Lunisolar) calendar:

=== Chinese New Year ===

The date of the Chinese New Year accords with the patterns of the lunisolar calendar and hence is variable from year to year.

The invariant between years is that the winter solstice, Dongzhi is required to be in the eleventh month of the year This means that Chinese New Year will be on the second new moon after the previous winter solstice, unless there is a leap month 11 or 12 in the previous year.

This rule is accurate, however there are two other mostly (but not completely) accurate rules that are commonly stated:

* The new year is on the new moon closest to Lichun (typically 4 February).
* The new year is on the first new moon after Dahan (typically 20 January)

It has been found that Chinese New Year moves back by either 10, 11, or 12 days in most years. If it falls on or before 31 January, then it moves forward in the next year by either 18, 19, or 20 days.

===Holidays with the same day and same month===
The Chinese New Year (known as the Spring Festival/ in China) is on the first day of the first month and was traditionally called the Yuan Dan () or Zheng Ri (). In Vietnam it is known as Tết Nguyên Đán (). Traditionally it was the most important holiday of the year. It is an official holiday in China including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan regions,and, Vietnam, Korea, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and Mauritius. It is also a public holiday in Thailand&#x27;s Narathiwat, Pattani, Yala and Satun provinces, and is an official public school holiday in New York City.

The Double Third Festival is on the third day of the third month.
The Dragon Boat Festival, or the Duanwu Festival (), is on the fifth day of the fifth month and is an official holiday in China including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan regions. 

The Qixi Festival () is celebrated in the evening of the seventh day of the seventh month.

The Double Ninth Festival () is celebrated on the ninth day of the ninth month.

===Full moon holidays (holidays on the fifteenth day)===
The Lantern Festival is celebrated on the fifteenth day of the first month and was traditionally called the Yuan Xiao () or Shang Yuan Festival (). 

The Zhong Yuan Festival is celebrated on the fifteenth day of the seventh month.

The Mid-Autumn Festival is celebrated on the fifteenth day of the eighth month. 

The Xia Yuan Festival is celebrated on the fifteenth day of the tenth month.

===Celebrations of the twelfth month===
The Laba Festival is on the eighth day of the twelfth month. It is the enlightenment day of Sakyamuni Buddha and in Vietnam is known as .

The Kitchen God Festival is celebrated on the twenty-third day of the twelfth month in northern regions of China and on the twenty-fourth day of the twelfth month in southern regions of China.

Chinese New Year&#x27;s Eve is also known as the Chuxi Festival and is celebrated on the evening of the last day of the lunar calendar. It is celebrated wherever the lunar calendar is observed.

===Celebrations of solar-term holidays===
The Qingming Festival () is celebrated on the fifteenth day after the Spring Equinox.

The Dongzhi Festival () or the Winter Solstice is celebrated.

===Religious holidays based on the lunar calendar===
East Asian Mahayana, Daoist, and some Cao Dai holidays and/or vegetarian observances are based on the Lunar Calendar.

===Celebrations in Japan===
Many of the above holidays of the lunar calendar are also celebrated in Japan, but since the Meiji era on the similarly numbered dates of the Gregorian calendar.

===Double celebrations due to intercalary months===
In the case when there is a corresponding intercalary month, the holidays may be celebrated twice. For example, in the hypothetical situation in which there is an additional intercalary seventh month, the Zhong Yuan Festival will be celebrated in the seventh month followed by another celebration in the intercalary seventh month. The next such occasion will be 2033, the first such since the calendar reform of 1645.

==Similar calendars==
Like Chinese characters, variants of the Chinese calendar have been used in different parts of the Sinosphere throughout history: this includes Vietnam, Korea, Singapore, Japan and Ryukyu, Mongolia, and elsewhere.

=== Outlying areas of China===
Calendars of ethnic groups in mountains and plateaus of southwestern China and grasslands of northern China are based on their phenology and algorithms of traditional calendars of different periods, particularly the Tang and pre-Qin dynasties.

===Non-Chinese areas===
Korea, Vietnam, and the Ryukyu Islands adopted the Chinese calendar. In the respective regions, the Chinese calendar has been adapted into the Korean, Vietnamese, and Ryukyuan calendars, with the main difference from the Chinese calendar being the use of different meridians due to geography, leading to some astronomical events — and calendar events based on them — falling on different dates. The traditional Japanese calendar was also derived from the Chinese calendar (based on a Japanese meridian), but Japan abolished its official use in 1873 after Meiji Restoration reforms. Calendars in Mongolia and Tibet have absorbed elements of the traditional Chinese calendar but are not direct descendants of it.
